If you don't ban the player rather than just the account, then players can trade all their RWT stuff to an alt, RWT on the alt, and not care if it gets banned.

Like what?

Gang banging on the corner like a real young bull

Exactly. For my first cape, I logged into tourney worlds for 6 Jads right before the triple jad waves and it guaranteed a pass. GL on cape dude, if you got to Zuk three times you‚Äôre pretty much there

I agree. I think Settled's concern is that the original person is only asking because of Swampletics, with no other motive. The request wasn't because it makes sense to be there, it wasn't because it fits thematically, it was just so that Swamp Daddy can more easily acquire a certain item.

If it shouldn't be *not* added because of a single UIM, then it also shouldn't be added because of a single UIM.

i went to almost 60 Mining south east of Varrock and banked it all in varrock east bank just to get some starting gp...
---
yea a little bit, desert treasure will do that to a man.
---
&gt;suiciding gear
---
I did the food on my trips but that's the first time I heard of gear suicide. How does that work? Wouldn't you be risking it to suicide it in the first place?
---
I just had a cute noob friend scout to see if there were pkers in his budget gear before I TP'd in or three itemed on solo trips
---
And what a pair of cheeky that chipmunk looking ass has
---
I suggested this the other day. Support.
---
damn you're paying 36 cents an hour to play this game? just pay a Venezuelan $1/hr and you'll get far
---
I wonder if legal action could be taken? RS gold isnt "allowed" to be sold but it isn't illegal to do so. She basically robbed the guy for like 8 grand ( prolly a bit less )
---
If I'm going to be burnt out by how little I'm getting paid off, and become a bored zombie of a player waiting for new content...Shouldn't I just avoid the gameplay that is too intense to socialize and relieve my boredom?   
---
Pretty sure the answer is yes. 
---
I'm not personally in need of convincing on the matter because just killing KBD for enough time to get my colored slayer helmet was time enough for me to get my fill of bossing. Any further down the rabbit hole would just be gratuitous waste of efforts. I managed to get a 180m bank without any boss killing at 108 combat and 80 slayer with some other non-combat stats and some bonds bought. If I'm somehow missing out on elite content, it's failed to strike me as important.  
---
I actually run in to more ironmen playing at the spawn locations I frequent than standard accounts. It seems like ironmen and skillers are the only people who aren't caught up in the rat race of doing bosses/raids until they're exhausted and pass out without even being able to do anything with their loot. Some of that group might make it to the end of the day, by means of a prescription of adderall or ritalin probably, with enough energy to go pitch it at the sand casino.   
---
I don't really find the appeal in trying to live so fast while playing a video game though, I'm doing this because of the polarity in appeal to the lifestyle of something like that...I don't really care for the influence the fast paced raiding/boss fighting players hold over the development team either, but I generally don't complain unless I see other people mentioning they're tired of the tedium themselves. Which I have in the top comments. Lots of people responding sarcastically or flippantly who just don't give a shit yet because the gear their mind is in operation with doesn't recognize emotions very well.  
---
It's to be expected when you're having these difficulties with a game that you'd want a solution or to quit and people should just recognize there are a lot of things you can do while you chat with people and enjoy the company of the community where there are members willing to chat and step out of the sphere of influence of people who just want to burn daylight at a fast pace.

This community can be toxic.  It's very sad.  Hope you feel better op.
---
Removing out of your control rng doesn‚Äôt make the game ‚Äúeasy‚Äù lol. Find a way to implement dc protection and I‚Äôd be all for it. You likely don‚Äôt even do any endgame pvm content if you think there is risk other than dc. Any unsafe pvm is piss easy and next to no risk besides dc.
---
I still use runehq

If you are doing slayer task then a slayer helm is your best in slot helm. It will be better than a zerk helm and SS.

It‚Äôs so bad

Well they have service **period**, so yes.

I mean I agree 100%, but on the other hand, it's not like adding it would be gamebreaking for the 99.9%. So I'm happy if it's added, I'm not upset if it isn't.

I think the $70k in btc donation was because the dude who donated was getting a divorce and didn‚Äôt want his wife to get more alimony so he gave it sick nerd lol, but that‚Äôs just a rumor

Get account banned, start new one.

Whats sad is someone made up this story
---
No, but something made you go out of your way to create this drawn out post, and that is what I and the person I replied to are curious about.

that would honestly be so fucking cool, ive thought about this before.

No

Lol, fuck off mate. You‚Äôre comparing a terrorist to a fucking OSRS RWT. Don‚Äôt be so ignorant, the guy RWT, it‚Äôs as simple as that. Look at all the garnered evidence so far and tell me it was all coincidental.
---
Why do you reply on multiple comments only about wondering if she's female or not, maybe it's time to try to talk to more girls dude. . 
---
Because this just gives sad vibes to me
---
There‚Äôs lots of ways to prove it. They could have provided any screenshots of the texts, both rsns, even log onto the ex‚Äôs account and show screenshots of the bank, or the new bank with 8b+ in gear that was transferred. They‚Äôre deliberately ignoring the accusations that the story is likely entirely fabricated because they‚Äôve already gotten the attention they wanted

From what I have heard the most that the client does is record in something like 5 minute intervals every hour or something. There is no way that the client constantly feeds back every single input that the player makes.
---
And you can‚Äôt read, now we both know that üòÇü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I feel like it is fine to have it locked behind elite

Also, there is a lot more minigames and endgame content.

Me too brother. I got so hype when I got two rune mediums in one trip.

&gt;impossible to get the levels he needs

I mean I wouldn‚Äôt put it past that dude.

I see people alching while doing agility, and it blows my mind. So much clicking
---
He found the net before he knew it was added. Its also kind of the only thing keeping the tob dream alive at this point so he sort of has to.
---
He just doesn't want new content coming in specifically to make his life easier
---
Depends. Sometimes you get the boats where everyone just afks after their portal dies and expects everyone else to quickly wrap up the last one. Which is fine with 5 people, unless there's also 6 spinners and nobody dealing with them.
---
Exactly, I've raided in top ten guilds in the US, I know how it is at those higher levels and I can absolutely see why clans on RS demand applications, boss experience, etc at the high levels when they demand efficiency. It's the same in WoW.
---
Being able to join a random guild if you're competent and show up is great from time to time, it's great for the average player. Those guilds love finding new people because they struggle with attendance most of the time. I do wish it were the same way with RS though, I play RS casually, I like to afk things and boss occasionally. I do not want to go through an application process to do trivial stuff like bandos etc. Sadly, unless you've got friends that's impossible to find in RS these days I find.

That's not how it works my dude. Wtf is an artist or game content developer going to be able to do about account security? It's different people who would be responible

This shit brings me back

Except for the night before he left!

no mmk, sadface.

I had the same issue, and this has been my solution completely.

I'd recommend doing a few boss kills every task but don't think it's worth grinding 5 hours of it on a single task.

I'm a pmod, It is literally 1 hour long

Hiring someone to deal with account security vs another for the art team are how these things work.

Correctional Officer here. I don't know about other areas but where I'm located inmates can buy tablets for $150. However they are locked down and can only download a small selection of games and movies. Anything where you can communicate with other people would not be permitted.
---
Have you PKed much yet with your current stats? If you have, you must be aware of the other builds people are using in F2P worlds. To create an effective PK build for P2P and to PK well on P2P you really need a lot of in depth advice. You‚Äôll need to google and YouTube guides.
---
&gt; And then when someone happens to show up and kill them, and they accuse you of luring them, **even though secretly it was their own alt.**
---
many players got gassed to death before they could reach the final area because the fog was too strong + some couldn't make it past the al-kharid gate because they couldn't bring gp
---
the final area was also locked down by RoT who won overwhelmingly by ice barraging + chinning a single tile chokepoint into the final safe zone
---
when jed was exposed, some retroactively speculated that RoT may have had insider info leak on the final area
---
Reminds me on planet of apes that black guy got brain surgery lul
---
What's the point of a Self-Imposed Challenge account if you kill a part of the challenge?
---
Is that actually true?
---
ardy 1 is prob all around the best. cape with pray bonus, stab bonus, unlimited equipable teles to an altar/pclose to bank/ pclose to fairy ring.
---
mory 3 is great for double runes from barrows and unlimited teles and a v close bank tele thats v close to barrows. makes runs easy and more valuable.
---
alot of people like varrock for the staves, but if youre an ironman they pile up and making the orbs/charging them is a huge chore which is why i stopped doing them.
---
lumby/dray3 is comparatively easy and gives unlimited teles to a herb patch. Plus run energy restores are fantastic.
---
Karamja 3 for access and teleports to gem mines. Plus if you need to buy things with tokkul it gives a good discount.
---
Kandarin 3 for the teleport moved to the bank makes agility alot easier to train (im 70ish agile with graceful and i never run out of run energy, no stams or restores used)
---
fally, wildy, kourend, western prov, fremmy, and desert are *pretty useless, except for the free herblore xp.

they know the integer maxes at 2.1b. what logical jump are you making where they know that 8.5b is 4 stacks of gold but not that each stack is 2.1b?

Glad you dont have to agree with it then asshole! Btw nothing looks more uneducated then trying to make someone else feel that way for stating their opinion. And not even leaving a shred of actual input. Fuck off.

What's better DPS wise between these two options at 70 attack and 70 strength?

* Full obsidian + berserker necklace + obsidian sword + dragon defender

She plays rs3 I‚Äôm pretty sure you can have 1 stack in your invy, 1 in the bank and 1 in the coin purse and I think it‚Äôs possible to have more than max cash in the purse. Otherwise I‚Äôm guessing platinum tokens or something similar is a thing
---
Did you try the other door. Only 1 of the 2 works
---
used to run air runes to people with like 50 rc because the 99 rc people were busy
---
Lol
---
But then someone could just RWT from a throw-away account to preserve the main.
---
I believe he intends to use future content added to Morytania, though.  It just needs to have been added organically, incidentally, not as some sort of boon given to him to 'help' the series.
---
Thanks for the input man. I was actually about to unblock greater demons for dragons so I‚Äôm glad I asked.
---
You need to find a way to start loving yourself again, man! Definitely try to be there for your kids, you don‚Äôt want them to be in the position you‚Äôre in at the moment later on do you? Just try to be there for them. As for you S.O. Tell her how you‚Äôve been feeling lately and ask her how she feels about the relationship and see if there‚Äôs a way to make it work. After you‚Äôve put the time into those things use what time you have left to maybe clean up your appearance a tad? Maybe get a new haircut and maybe a new pair of shorts/pants and shirt that make you feel good! And then get back in that gym and knock it out of the park! Get swole haha. Find your favorite music and just go all out when possible! You matter buddy! Whether you know it or not, people count on you. It might feel like a lot of pressure but just do what you can, but mainly work on that self esteem first and the rest will come easy!
---
Holy....shit. Thank you. I was just clicking in the center
---
Lmao. I was just being an ass. It's a horrible idea. But no one argued with me.
---
You deserve it for being impatient
---
That‚Äôs what I was trying to imply lol.
---
He's saying it would make sense regardless of a single UIM account..
---
Ok
---
Dang dude congrats

gargoyles drop rune ore

Bought bcp and tassets over the weekend, should my next upgrades that I save up for be arma skirt and chestplate? I mainly just do slayer pvm-wise, so I don't really need any boss-specific gear. Other than arma, the only things I can think of getting next are maybe rigour, getting one more construction level to get the max portal nexus, or maybe there's some weapon that I should get first (I have an abby dagger, tent whip, bgs, blowpipe, and toxic trident)
---
As it is with 99% of the games content that isn't a part of any given optimal workflow
---
I‚Äôve yet to see the fabled anglers fishing rod still holding out hope
---
If you put the noted item under the high alch symbol, you just have to click it twice without moving the mouse location to alch something. Makes it very easily to do other activities as well.
---
Thanks for the advice

fair

How the hell did this guy find ANOTHER woman?

I wear alright clothes tbh just neglected myself alot, i would post a picture but this is reddit and i know what could happen with it so i wont. you response means a great deal. going out probably isnt an option due to the jealously thing and tbh thats probably all because of me from the beginning. regardless thank you alot for responding to me.

happens to me too let me know if a fix is found

Time to run around f2p giving out money.
---
Some of us are just looking out for his sanity
---
&gt; why do so many people seem to think that RWTing is selling directly to a buyer?
---
Because it often is. You sell to your friends, you sell to your clanmates, etc. Just because you RWT purely to a goldselling site doesn't means that's all that exists. 
---
&gt; they're not going to risk their reputation
---
They're reputation as a sketchy semi-illegal third-world-country goldselling site? Oh no, what would they ever do without that /s
---
Don‚Äôt care for ur biased race realist white washed funded data. Just look at how mad u got when u got exposed for being a racist.

Did ur sister/gf get some big black cock and that‚Äôs why ur so angry at the world?

I'll drop rune armor sets in f2p worlds sometimes.  I dont know how many people pick them up actually need them, but oh well

Settled doesn't pump a constant amount of content over time, only when theres specific milestones. All this would do would further increase the gap between episodes
---
Is there a specific place to stand when doing these? They hardly attack me without me having to click them.

Ge or not, Varrock is home. Maybe you don't live there, maybe you spend the years on the beach in Catherby or seasons in bustling Ardougne, Varrock is home.

The server doesn't need to know your mouse position or when you click only what you click. Only the client needs that information, sending that information constantly would be a massive waste.

I agree with this as well. You'll probably get better advice from people there. This reddit may have more children than adults that are useful.

I just want to say, that I'm a super noob. I now have 67 quest points, no lvl 99 stats, 60cb stats, etc. I don't know the world well beyond the f2p area. 
---
But, if you use the quick quest guides on the wiki that allows you to check boxes next to the steps, you'll get everything done insanely quickly. Some people here are mentioning "talk to thurgo" but on the knights sword quest, the quick guide already told you where he was, southeast of rimmington or Southwest of port whatever. In 2 days, having never done the quests, I did plague city, underground pass, and regicide with no prior knowledge. The quick guide was amazing, from an easy list of items to bring to simple steps of how to get through the underground pass (all steps can be checked off making them darker to read) I didn't once fail in the pass and have to restart it, any of the 3 times I went through it. Underground pass took the longest, but that's because I was being cautious and scared, it was easy. Now I'm going to continue with the quest line, and do the quests for the fairy rings. Not to mention that the entire time I was doing these quests, I was able to watch (unrelated) videos from YouTubers I like because I could quickly switch tabs on my second monitor to and from the guide. ------------ I would never presume to tell someone else how to do something, but in my opinion, I think I was able to finish these quests a lot faster than if I had to watch, pause, and rewatch videos on it, but that's just me. Just wanted to clear up the mistake about the quick guides supposedly not telling you where NPCs are, when they do.
---
In the name of the father, the son and the holy Pmod, I declare this post upvoted
---
&gt; in exchange they received a power and status.
---
That's not really consideration, as far as I understand it, because all they're offering is a duty. It's been a while since I took contracts, but I'm fairly certain you need to have something of tangible worth in common law countries for the agreement to be contractual.
---
&gt;I also believe they have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement in regards to specific processes and such, so this is definitely a legal agreement.
---
I really doubt they would hold up in court, that's all I'm saying, but I'm neither a lawyer nor from the UK, so that's all I'll say about it.

"if it ain't broke why fletch"

Thank you dude, i contacted suicide prevention just for someone o talk to real time, and when i finished there my 2nd thought was here on 2007scape, i know there are some idiots however i know alot of us are in our 20s and grown up doing what we love and maybe others possibly are in a similar situation idk but i just needed to air my shit and i thought this would be a good place without feeling judged. your replying means alot to me.
---
Lol the top right frame looks like a blue Charizard
---
you run after your xp drop during 4:1. you do not wait at all after your 4th hit.
---
Even if they add it he can just choose to not use it. which I hope he does
---
Yeah I agree, if he wanted to stream or whatever than having the account would be the correct financial decision, but that's a different situation from comparing hours to profit
---
What law is being broken?

So I have UIM skiller account, I got my money from agility pyramid and pickpocketing ardy knights with 99 thieving. For but since you train combat, Pvm is king(especially slayer) I think getting 99 thieving, you can make about 300k an hour for an Ironman, which is pretty good, but you don‚Äôt need too much cash as an Ironman either. I use my cash stack for construction.
---
Or just make every bank an exchange.  We can already collect our exchange stuff why not let us put up offers too.
---
Turn off hardware acceleration. You can google how to do it via runelite wiki.

?
---
Treasure Hunter would be considered gambling in some countries.
---
It‚Äôs kinda an art. Creating an account is building something and seeing progression. Even if it is just pixels and numbers. I love it
---
Most people using this method were f2p so they didn‚Äôt have the option to port to draynor
---
This is an actual question and he needs help. Don't be a dick.
---
It was asked for by someone else months before settled even maxes.
---
fyi mage/range only affect your combat level if its more than 2/3 of your combined atk/str lvl, so you can train range or mage to ~58 before you gain a combat level. Training range in f2p will increase your hp tho, which you might want to avoid.
---
Yeah they've had years and years yet they still make the game in a way that incentivises botting.
---
I'm no lawyer but I know they have sued people before lol quit arguing. It's a fact and I'm not saying it's right just that it's happened
---
That would be an option
---
Doesn't really seem like a update that would be in the spirit of what the rings are for though - one ring that provides a straight boost to a single combat style
---
Fire and nature runes in high demand over here aswell i see
---
i‚Äôm like 99% sure that mod ash was being facetious. the guy who asked the question probably was as well. so you probably don‚Äôt have to worry about stuff like this. 
---
if it actually makes it to the polls, though then we‚Äôll riot, lol
---
I don‚Äôt believe it was really you. What was my username?
---
I found the fruit stall in hos much better than the silk stall.  You aggro the guard dogs and trap them on the stall and it‚Äôs basically smooth sailing from there.  You bring some baskets and you can make a small amount of money to boot.  Nothing spectacular bu better than nothing
---
Whats a spinning wheel?
---
i did this
---
I mean not using Linux would probably solve the problem...
---
Well... what if seers gave A + 5% magic accuracy or something like that for example.
---
Construction is the very reason I want a fat cash stack. My plan now is quest like crazy then start the slayer grind to gargs then camp there for days on end for the drops and gp. I've never tried any bossing so I'm anxious about that. Long term I want to go for a quest cape and push for a nice house with all the bells and whistles.
---
Basically the community got away from having fun and wants best xp(gp)/hr or bis gear. If the game offers neither its only played by the dedicated communities which are hard to find for some. Caste Wars does have a very dedicated group though
---
I'd love to add you in game.

Yeah for sure he didn't make much from it in comparison, but that isn't the point.  RWTing 1M, 5M, 10M, and all the way up to 3B are both perm bans.  The point stands imo
---
People can edit that, I've seen a guy with 2 billion goblin kills.
---
Two others actually. One in Hosidius and one on Fossil Island
---
Hey same with me! Everyone's always raving on about how amazing GPU was, but every time I used it my laptop just crashed. Figured it just wasn't able to handle it idk
---
Imagine playing the game how you like
---
Sounds like an awesome plan, good luck!
---
yea i basically came back to lvl up high and play those modes just to come back and see that they dead
---
I use 2 factor auth on email and game so I can happily continue to buy gold : )
---
How about ring of grace buyable with marks of grace?
---
Yeah agreed. It's pretty absurd he can't get hay anywhere in the region if it's needed for the diary.
---
I jg wentworthed that shit man I need cash now
---
q
---
Not going to lie I did this same shit until diaries were added and then I did hard in f2p and used the cabbage teleport to bank in draynor. Lmao good times.
---
ah mb
---
mb
---
Of course I am ignorant, the fuck do I know about your life. Bad parents create fucked up kids that make bad parents that create fucked up kids. Break that cycle.
---
you can already do this tbh, if you get banned for botting on a pure they typically don't chain ban the main unless you're being really over the top and running multiple bots
---
You could have 4 different coin stacks on as little as two accounts if you count platinum
---
Its time.
---
Yes I agree with that, but then Kemp's ironman should've been banned because he was using it to kill players, and would loot on his main.  He then eventually sold gold from his main, the accounts were linked
---
Redwood is the slowest way in the game to get beaver pet
---
Bonfires are my favorite...
---
I mean no having to time perfectly... you just sorta let it chill

And then you can rest by it to gain run
---
Jordan/Macca/Luke is that you ?
---
Now read the comment by 'Abram367'.
---
If you still need it im sure my group is gonna start raiding in a bit
---
Maybe not 6. I kind of like the hussle-and-bussle of the exchange.
---
Maybe like...2? One far to the west, and one where we've got it.
---
I guess 6 would be more convenient, but it'd also be way empier...
---
It hurts the most when you pop it before its ready to burst on its own. It tends to scab and just keep bleeding randomly. As more herpes lesions build on top it gets itchy and hurts. Just let the puss drip and you'll start to enjoy the feeling.
---
I was absolutely on board until leveling his def. Then I fucking *lost* it.
---
The south revs cave spot is better though cause its multi
---
You use it to make string. Including bowstring and crossbow string
---
My fondest memory of Runescape is when I had a bunch of people over to my (real) house for a sleepover LAN party, and then I invited everyone to my Runescape house for a dope house party. Good times!
---
Fashionscape with blue graceful
---
honestly giving me goosebumps man, we'd do this shit and all bring our laptops to one house... We'd have these gay boxing matches in the houses arena and shit....
---
Considering a large chunk of my OSRS playing happens on the shitter, I try to stay well versed in Runescape‚Äôs fecal lore
---
Where else?
---
Das cool
---
Fuck. Feel sorry for his co worker tbh
---
I got lucky and could use my friends max pure I believe those are gmaulers and this may sound stupid but the account has no gear is there a setup you could recommend for it?
---
Nothing wrong with this kind of content that is good for everyone. This is how old content used to be designed.
---
No guide &gt; all other methods
---
I mean even if they did add it, he just wouldn't use it. Clearly it became a thing just for him and he doesn't want it.
---
And every time you use it you have a 50% chance to be teleported to an in progress castle wars game.
---
Well take a second to think about where jagex is located and what time it is. And you clearly dont know what your issue is since you say it isnt a password issue but you locked yourself out after failing your password 10 times. The customer support is actually fine if you have half a brain and can use common sense but instead you turn to a random website in no way connected to the game in the middle of the night to yell for the jmods to help you. As I said this will actually get you no where unlike actually following the support pages.
---
Yeah me too it was always wc for money but mainly in edgeville or ge. (I'm an '08 folk so I had GE)
---
My enterprise was cowhides, get like 100 and then run down to al karid, sell them for 100-200gp each.  Sometimes you could get noobs to sell them to you for 10gp each
---
youre just trolling now you asshole. all that does it send an email out to reset password, read what I wrote
---
i mean the mage hand is not hard compared to the other stuff you do. most people i see who get into solos either pick it up in a few raids super ezpz or theyre trying to do it on longrange and cant figure out why they keep gettin hit.
---
HAHA this is the comment that brought back memories
---
I made this to celebrate my (almost) quest cape!
---
For those wanting to replicate:
---
Models out of clay and finished with acrylics.
---
Lava is enamel paint diffused in epoxy resin.
---
Ground is sand and rocks painted with acrylics.
---
Pot is... a pot submerged swirl painted with enamel paint. :)
---
The reason for upgrading would be to get to 50 stats faster, much faster, than he could on f2p
---
I did read it. Did you click the link sent to you via email?
---
rock solid analogy man. A+
---
You get pked at all?
---
It would be sick if you could see how much people were staking.
---
no one gives a shit bud. no one with half a life has time to kill zulrah 3k times for gp lol. 6$ is 10m and i and many others will continue to buy gp because if your password gets hacked, it is your own dumbass fault
---
Damn, I got mine at 66 https://imgur.com/a/UfZjlnQ
---
Better yet, add a broken one with an examine option stating "When everything is settled we will get around to repairing this."
---
Dude, this was always my go to. Super low combat requirements. Old mate has well over the stats required. He wouldn‚Äôt even need supplies
---
Why would he follow the actual steps to unlock his account when he can just post angry shit on redit about how bad they are? Clearly posting here bashing them is much simpler than actually following the steps
---
Turtletale is fucking crazy

I got the same feeling lol. :)

Exactly. Super easy to make a few bucks. I remember doing this for sure!

Including the buyers.
---
Wat. Is this really a thing???
---
Just a heads up you used a double negative in your statement at the end there. It makes it a little hard to read.
---
&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt consider that interacting
---
Thats like me drop trading to an alt to rwt and saying it wasnt really interacting
---
Sad not chad
---
With a loom, like normal people.
---
One in each kingdom would make sense. Or each continent
---
There could be, though I imagine most people would spacebar through it like any tutorial. Especially something that would need to be that long to explain all the different ways you can get scammed, phished, or lured. Something like that would I think work better outside a tutorial in a longer form, which already exists in stronghold of security.
---
I mean, you can only really be so sure since it's based off circumstantial evidence and none of us really know, but from my what i've read over time that seems to be how it goes. Granted, if the pure is botting a lot and moving resources/money to the main that is probably going to be a different story, because they do ban peoples mains who have gold farming bots funneling gold to them.
---
But as far as say, botting your combat/mage up or something, they're probably not going to touch the main account.
---
Im no lawyer but heres 0 evidence and a fact about the law.
---
Gj man
---
Where‚Äôd the update bro, I wanna see the firecape post
---
I've seen this before, and I think the guy fixed it by disabling MSAA in the RuneLite GPU plugin
---
Absolutely, supply and demand of gold require each other
---
See you next month
---
Via bonds yes
---
Maybe he just really hated goblins
---
That entertainment directly benefits the developers by drawing interest.
---
Rsn or fake
---
Mom said it's my turn to post it this week
---
Real-world trading, buying or selling gold for real money. Bot farms exist to generate a ton of gold to sell to players I believe. The more people that buy gold the stronger incentive for bots to be created

Tbh, I think kemp‚Äôs tweet is more important than settled‚Äôs was (even though it‚Äôs about him): 
---
‚ÄúThe purpose of Swampletics is to have an experience full of unique obstacles nobody has ever overcome before. The best way to sabotage his series is to hand him everything he needs through updates. People that want to 'support' him this way do not understand his videos.‚Äù

what is not hard compared to running the mage hand on Olm? To me that seems like the hardest part so hard, although i avoid tekton and vasa completely.
---
Today I realized that not only is there a deposit box in port sarim, but that draynor bank is closer than fally bank and young me was an idiot but worse, 23 year old me still didn‚Äôt notice it.

I‚Äôve heard there is a big group of bots in world Xfinity on demand

On a related note, I would recommend point boosting until you have enough to make your block list and a good bit of points for blocks.

Real world trading. Buying gp for $

---
If only 20 people would have posted this on reddit first..
---
Thank you, The_Bopjick, very cool.
---
all mage hand is attack and move timing. lot of other rooms require you to juggle more than just attacking on the right tick.
---
like 4:1 melee hand is the same, requires you to not miss ticks. but you also have to deal with acid trail, flame wall and actually setting up 4:1.
---
Mory hard for bonecrusher
---
Yeah no worries I have no life anyways I just play RS all day when I‚Äôm not at work :)
---
As other's have said this only happens with beginner clues. The reason for this is that beginner clues are f2p while birdnests are not.
---
Because its a water genie
---
I had black (g) legs and body with black beret, obby cape, dragon mace, zammy book (no pages, couldn‚Äôt afford any). I looked like a beast
---
I would for sure use the infernal pickaxe if you have the varrok armor because it makes your life way easier. Its not mandatory but helps a lot and makes it way less click intensive.
---
hell yeah, exactly shit like that.
---
This is so fucking fallacious lol
---
Found this while scrolling through reddit. Man advertising is on point today
---
&gt;you make so much gp raiding efficiently 
---
Which equates to roughly 4 dollars an hour. Complete shit and not even worth your time unless you live in a 3rd world country.
---
If you‚Äôre actually serious about making good money off this game you need to set up a large bot farm.
---
Hmmm, wondering if you're trying to do that specifically as at 1893, 97 slayer my ranged has a mil more exp than hp.
---
Presumably a human imports his clothes to him from Varrock. He's able to sell them because there is no flax or wool within Morytania so there is no other option other than buying imports.
---
That said, we should be careful with how we apply logic to RS. Generally speaking the majority of the world doesn't make sense.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Angler%27s_outfit
---
seems that 66kc is about 96-97% chance, happens all the time
---
Don't forget the 5 hour long quest to unlock it
---
That could be an option. My goal is kind of just don't burn out, don't necessarily need to get the most efficent exp rate all day. Was doing zmi today and didn't hate it, threw on a podcast and just went into autopilot and listened to the podcast lol. Screen markers make it brainless.
---
I'd lean more towards Cadmus than Nazis tbh.
---
You are allowed to buy trans with go but not with cash. Buying in game stuff with gp is not rwt
---
Well I have 2 skills at 98 but I‚Äôm not purposely leaving them there for the sake of getting higher hp xp. I got 98 range and str from chinning and nmz so I‚Äôve been saving the last levels for raids and zulrah, switched over to attack now
---
Everyone grew up, we aren‚Äôt 10 years old with 8 hours to kill after school every day, those carefree days are over, I gotta do this demonic gorilla task and hopefully put a drop in the tbow bucket so I can do inferno before I die of old age.
---
Probably at least one, they have everything there
---
It's not a real world trade OR SERVICE. A real world service would be paying somebody 100m gp to take an online school exam for them or some other type of shit. Buying fire capes with rsgp is not RWT, if you want to call it account trading, go ahead. Not even replying to your bait anymore.
---
Farming emblems
---
It is posted in /r/prorevenge?
---
It's not in geforce experience my guy, you have to right click on the nvidia settings on your toolbar, that should bring up the option to select either.
---
Yes it is I only have one overall account... however I see them when I log into rs3 but not in osrs
---
I did but I cannot see them in osrs only rs3
---
I mean, that's partly it but I mean shit, there's still kids playing now but they aren't about it like that.
---
compared to other spinning wheel locations it would be p irrelevant
---
The Genie is the master teleporter, he can be everywhere.
---
Perhaps they're sheep in wolves' clothing?
---
maybe 3-5 daily teleports to any agility course (not rooftops)? so that's gnome stronghold, brimhaven, agility pyramid, penguin iceberg (fast travel back to relleka), barb outpost, wildy course, canifis for skullball, ape atoll, and dorgesh-kaan.
---
Thanks I might give it a go again. Also how do you like 3 ticking versus volcanic mine?
---
But that also implies that you lower the profit of gold farmers by raising the supply.
---
I thought I heard that you're allowed to remap keys 1 for 1 but I think i heard somewhere else regarding mouse keys that you're not allowed to. Which is the case?
---
Most people rejected his message.
---
They hated u/cat_killr because he told them the truth.
---
I used the Wiki quest guides before they were cool.
---
Well, I switched back and forth between it and Rune HQ admittedly, because sometimes Rune HQ had better pictures and focus on small details. Not to mention Sal's Realm ;)
---
Yeah I went into the nvidia control panel, 3D settings, program settings, and added runelite. I‚Äôm not seeing where to turn on the shadowplay thing for it since I thought that was included in experience
---
Bots are what makes it feel authentic
---
F
---
Honestly i think you are out of your mind. Bro she threatned to hurt your kids. Get the police involved asap.
---
He can't max because he can't train runecrafting
---
ü§î Now that‚Äôs thinking outside the box!
---
Just did this quest on my im. You can tele out. I recommend fighting it in melee range protecting mage like the guides say. It‚Äôs overall pretty easy if you have a couple prayer potions and stay in melee range.
---
Sober up. Get dressed. Go to the police station and get you and your kids away from her.
---
Get a job. Get help. Get healthy. 
---
You cant help your kids if you cant help yourself.
---
It was actually 20 year olds and above that made up over 80% of the cases of the tide pod meme
---
I don't think that individual accounts should ever be considered when making content. If you guys want to add a spinning wheel (not implying you do), then Swampletics or anyone else for that matter should not be considered.
---
Community relations are important, but not if they diverge content priorities.
---
yh and swampletics already got his rune c bow just saw him in canifis ok sorry to spoil this shit lol
---
I don't feel it does. For beating everything first try or first couple tries, yes. 
---
All skills have guides, they may only show the levels at which you unlock things, so it depends on how you want to play to get to your goal level. 
---
The quests themselves have guides and aren't terrible if you read what is being said; yes some would be super difficult without outside help though. 
---
There is no goals aside from what you set yourself and can do almost anything in anyway you want. I like to think the no set goals from the start (aside from Tutorial Island) is what gets newer players confused. They want the best strats and guides to unlock things quickly, when the journey and playing the game the way you find fun is what makes this game special.
---
i dont get it? pmods are allowed to pk. he's not breaking any rules. spamming trades is abuse? macing people is abuse?
---
macing was broken when you could guarantee a smite if someone was skulled in multi. now it's impossible to get smited for more than 1.25x current hp worth of prayer if your accept aid is off. if he got smited from 52 that meant he had &gt;62 hp when he got speared.
---
A thieving bot
---
There‚Äôs a Mod called noodles? I need to meet this person
---
Even though I love Settled‚Äôs series, I don‚Äôt think any possible update should be withhold for one specific account build. If one does get released he can choose not to use it but being illogical for the sake of one account isn‚Äôt the way to go.
---
So maybe morytania could use an unusable spinning wheel too
---
Based on your comments, you definitely deserved that RNG. Hope you get another pet before anything else.
---
&gt; Of course most people would really disagree with me but stuff like prayer ticking/3ticking doesn't take skill it's just tedious mechanics that bots excel at
---
Ofc people would really disagree with you because it's not true. Bots never prayer flick/3 tick because the more actions and the more intense those actions are, the easier it is to catch bots.
---
Ummm.... I'm so sorry https://imgur.com/GHiBNoQ.jpg
---
Yeah, basically.. I just wanted to word it in a less embarrassing way lol
---
I don't know of a programthatdoesthisbut osrs wiki optimal quest guide might help
---
!remindme 12hrs
---
Can you say ok to me too?
---
Usually yes you can always teleport or teletab out of any old quest area, such as swan song, recipe for disaster, etc
---
I know there's a site that shows what quests you can do with your stats but I can't seem to find it right now. The wiki has an optimal quest guide for getting a quest cape can be found [here.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide)
---
If you're looking for quests with good unlocks, a few main ones you should aim for as follows.
---
- Ava's accumulator (Animal Magnetism)
---
- Barrows Gloves (various, minimum 175 qp)
---
- Dragon Scimitar (Monkey Madness)
---
- Fairy Rings (Fairytale Pt 1 and started Pt 2)
---
- Zulrah (boss, Regicide)
---
- Lunar Spellbook (Lunar Diplomacy)
---
- Ancient Spellbook (Desert Treasure)
---
- Neitiznot Helm (Fremenik Isles)
---
- Ava's assembler and Vorkath (Dragon Slayer II)
---
- Heavy ballista and Demonic Gorillas (Monkey Madness II)
---
These are not in order and some of them are fairly late game content. Most of them require other quests as well as higher stats. I'd recommend setting a goal of an item/area/boss you want to unlock and then working towards it. You'll notice to get to the content you want you'll have to work through a lot of other quests and requirements leading you to doing useful content.
---
i do
---
&gt; we won‚Äôt stop updating areas because of singular accounts, even if they‚Äôre incredibly popular.
---
This is how it should be. Those accounts chose to restrict themselves knowing that updates may happen to their area. They can chose wether to use or not to use the update to their advantage if it happens to be advantageous. 
---
The other 99,99999999% of players would like the updates (if voted for and passed). There is no reason to cater to a few accounts because they wanted some specific challenge to make content. It would actually defeat their purpose.
---
West, we all know what is the real reason and please don't pretend it is opposite. Nobody would ever ask for it if Swampletics series weren't a thing. If you have ideas to refresh Morytania either if these are new or pretty old ones, go on, this is what we were asking for a years but please remember a single person should not be reason to either put or do not put something to the game.
---
I think it's less about him wanting a better accomplishment and more because he doesn't want to feel like his influence on the OSRS community got something changed in game to make his challenge easier.
---
If it were you or me, we wouldn't have the influence to get something added to the area.
---
What game are you talking about? If OSRS then no shit its a grind smh. Pick another game if ur not up to it
---
fuck yeah 16k! lol
---
I wipe my hands of this!
---
Dissappinted mod ash didnt just sign across the whole middle
---
Anyone can tell me how Xzact's shortbow Inferno ended? Fell asleep during single jad.
---
I think the point is as long as it's not just for him, he wouldn't care. He just doesn't want content added with the only purpose to be benefiting him.
---
I think It's cool to see all these area restricted accounts finding little bits of the game that "should" be changed, a higher purpose for it all I guess.
---
but it definitely shouldn't be selective like this. perhaps every clothing shop can get a spinning wheel/loom upstairs or downstairs or something eventually, to fill in the world of RuneScape
---
Go on iPlayer and you should be able to go back
---
Sweet! Thanks&lt;3
---
Warrior is useful for cannoning dags
---
of course they do lol
---
Varrock. Home. At least it was before I fucked everything up.
---
Youd literally have to get some paper and map it out. No way you can yolo it, i wonder how long it took the first person to figure it all out.
---
I can't watch the video right now, but I'm guessing that it wasn't his account based on the title. If so, then yeah what do you expect?
---
This isn‚Äôt as common of knowledge as you think
---
Wow 400 mediums done here no boots :(
---
You can watch it on iPlayer if you go on live BBC 1 and rewind back
---
I wouldve probably done that quest without a guide if it didnt have those damn shades...
---
The puzzle looked really fun but not "Ill do it in 15 trips as I keep running out of prayer pots" fun
---
That's the point of Daft3n's comment. They ignored it for 7 years. MMK is not on it because he recently left
---
Little too quick on the insults. You can correct someone without calling them names you know. Imagine if teachers ripped on you at school, as well as everyone else
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point of having mini game worlds? So that the community can condense into it so it‚Äôs more active?
---
Well I guess you could say that recently, I've been wanting to join a clan or find someone/a couple of people to do some of the content I previously didn't have interest in, like bossing, group slayer, more communication-focused minigames like, uh... something, I'm sure.
---
When I was a teenager, I played runescape more like a single-player game. Now that I'm older, I wanna experience this "muhl-tee-play-yerr" thing I hear so much about

He literally just got out of debt from that stake..ouch
---
correct it was his "friend"
---
Double runes at barrows, extra experience for slayer in slayer tower
---
Just some context: Hyphonix has been using long time viewer Darkdave's account to stake for past few months.  This guy is a mod in his chat and cc.  He's lent Hyphonix billions over the years to stake.  I believe this is the most Hyphonix has had at once on this account.  Anyways, after winning a bunch of stakes in a row he suddenly gets logged out and can't log back in.
---
Gold buyers are future whales for when MTX is added to OSRS.
---
Can‚Äôt help but think you completely missed the point... Of course you shouldn‚Äôt design content to fit around restricted accounts but this idea was suggested in response to swampletics, hence why he doesn‚Äôt want it added. He does not want to impact additions to the game.
---
Good. Nice post history lol
---
She‚Äôs right tho..
---
Found the botter. God this community is so negative. Why are you the way you are?
---
&gt;but I will never ever understand the logic behind the puzzle in Elemental Workshop III
---
How embarrassing
---
I play less than 5 hours a week, sometimes not logging in for over a week. I know i could buy a bond from the time i spend online every 2 weeks, but i wouldnt enjoy the game like that. I sometimes feel like im wasting my money staying subbed but it is what it is. Would rather keep my gold than spending it on mempership at the moment.
---
I mostly just skill now when i get on. Occassional cox. If i was playing alot more, id be buying bonds with gold.
---
Knights of pvm and hero are pretty chill by no means top tier but they have advanced pvm players
---
Oh no not a red box around a ground item! My childhood is ruined OMG.
---
Shiiit, why was it removed?
---
The streak was unreal
---
This is awesome!
---
A ghost there would let you use it, but only if you give them something that isn't found in Morytania (since the ghost can't leave).
---
No. Didn't disagree = agreed.
---
I just turned around and saw someone running round on RS3 i was wondering what it's for too
---
It honestly depends on the quest and it's also a bit of a relic of the time. The wiki quick guides were not always there or there with the quality they currently have. Even now there are still certain quests that are below average in quality that could use some cleaning up (if I knew more about how the wiki worked I would fix them myself, but I am idiot)
---
If you really don't know anything about the quest and are doing it for the first time the quick guides aren't always the best to follow and they can take a little more mental energy to follow through on. Slayermusiq walks you through everything with a lot of attention to detail and accuracy and he's made the vast majority of his videos error free with a flow that allows you to just turn your brain off and mindlessly follow instruction to get the quest done. Certain quests like MEP2 I literally never would have gotten done without him. You can also pick a faster speed on the video, pause/skip ahead, etc to cut down on the time with his videos as well.
---
For quests you have experience with the current quick guides are great though just as little reminders for certain things. I've made a lot of pures and pk accounts over the years so a vast majority of the quests I can breeze through with ease and they are a lifesaver just to make sure I don't forget any steps. 
---
Honestly though, sometimes you've been grinding quests on an account literally all day and your brain is mush and you just want to tune out and get them done. My boy slayermusiq comes in clutch there.
---
As a guy working on 99 agility for his first 99 I fully support any improvements to the cape. This one especially...
---
You are trolling

I'm 15 and have noticed everyone that plays the game except me is 20+. I know 1 (one) person that is 19 and plays but that's it. So you're really not too old for it, never too late to buy gfs!
---
The uniques have all crashed and will continue to drop in price over time while alchables only devalue the value of gp over time.
---
Also CoX is 6m/h? Lmao found the dude who has never raided before - even with a Tbow drop in the long-term CoX was 3m/h before ancestral etc crashed. 
---
ToB is probably approaching that figure but then again, ToB can't be botted like Vorkath.
---
Nah dude. I‚Äôm 27 and just got back into it since a 10 year break and I enjoy it now more than ever.
---
I can't wait to finish my 99 FM so I can start playing my ironman. Want it out of the way cause it's sooo much better with 18hp and cakes.
---
This
---
You're in for a treat, s3 is airing now and it has only gotten better in my opinion
---
Oh, right. I can't fathom those negatives working with different logic tho, I'd imagine is just the fact they use them as opposed to not.
---
There‚Äôs a streamer who is doing everything in runescape without guides. She completed ME 1&amp;2 her twitch is Jillyfish. It‚Äôs a pretty fun watch.
---
Woah woah, you can't just pigeonhole 'monsters' into what you think they should be like.
---
Get that HAM shit outta here :\^)
---
Settled has a bit of an ego. He restricts himself to one area of the map and, what, suddenly he decides what content is or isn't added? Fuck him. Add spinning wheels in every single house, every single room, and one in the bank for good measure.
---
Then turn off the fucking authenticator until you can get in, you said you can get in the website.
---
Obor is a slut bitch who only gives me the 10k drops.
---
https://twitter.com/songofalchemy/status/1137731277610737665
---
he wasn't being facetious
---
Would honestly make more sense if they added a loom to the shop, rather than a spinning wheel.
---
As someone who hates quests with such a firey passion I have 68 quest points on an account from 2003, I agree with OP. It's much less painful to use the wiki quick guides.
---
They may need way more then 8. I used like 15 for +5 rc for a master clue a few days ago.
---
adding sugar to a pile of shit doesnt make it taste good
---
It‚Äôs a phishing email. Don‚Äôt click any of the links, if you, have you should change your passwords ASAP.
---
I use this account in BH, so I have 1 def to PvP, it's def not a statement, lol.
---
Back in like 2004-06 though, 10 def, all black with ruby str and rune scim... now that was a statement haha
---
That's a phishing email.
---
fucking weebs man
---
That's just cruel....vote it in!
---
These dishonest stakers are repulsive. Nuke the entire area once and for all.
---
D
---
It force swaps ur world
---
Yeah, I get that. It's just really intense. I personally can't focus on something this repetitive and click intensive for very long.
---
Pmods can mute....? Like they have the ability to mute for 1 hour
---
Chances are that the email you received is a phishing email. 
---
In terms of finding out what accounts you have linked to an email, you can receive an email which will list the logins for accounts linked to an email [through this channel](https://secure.runescape.com/m=email-register/forgot-login).
---
I am out of the loop here. Please explain?
---
Without love
---
That's good to know that I can level a new one quickly, especially now that I have cannon, GP, and all the supplies I would need.
---
I def have this idea in my head that it would take a long time to make a pure, but that's because on this acct I got like 99QP and used a lot of time doing stuff like that and skilling.
---
Its why mobile sucks. F dude.
---
You can't see already dropped items when you log in.
---
Genuine congratulations!
---
Yeah and I realize now in hindsight that a lot of the stuff I got for my pure (bear-mask, zammy book, etc.) were really unnecessary for my build and style of playing. Would be a lot easier to make a pure without having to do all those extra quests.
---
Make sure you‚Äôre using preserve, just Incase. If you aren‚Äôt an Ironman, use someone‚Äôs house as it makes it much easier and more money efficient to stew to +5, just make sure to look at the timer. It does not reset after each stew, so be mindful. Drink when you‚Äôre ~60+ seconds, otherwise there‚Äôs a chance you won‚Äôt make it in time. You don‚Äôt want that 5 to be all for nothing :)
---
Man that dudes infuriating. Settled literally says he doesn't want it, the dude still argues that "it'll be okay if it passes a poll" and shit. Like hes saying no no no dude, you don't know what you want settled, if it passes a poll it means you do.
---
A friend of mine has found posting on the official forum got him a bit more traction.
---
Also dont mine gold, powermine iron all the way.
---
Arbeit macht frei, mein Freund.
---
What is each sofa-sitters favorite location ingame? Why?
---
Not unless paid for by real world currency or sexual favours.
---
Entrana also makes it impossible to get armor as a drop.
---
Legends üòâ , guess I‚Äôll be back tonight to begin the grind
---
I use quick guides but, I would here and there take a look at the video guide if there‚Äòs a hard boss fight in the quest for the gear guide and to see the boss tactic.
---
Seeing your friend say he‚Äôs close to max at 2068 total is the saddest thing. Poor little guy doesn‚Äôt even know...
---
Run diagonally away and towards the center to give yourself more time to line yourself up with the gap.
---
It works both ways, its also against the rules to pay for real world services with ingame currency.
---
Wholesome content, I'm happy for you!
---
If f2p want more content than what they've already gotten then there is always the option to pay for membership.
---
Yeah wily cap is the mvp.
---
When will the official client get HD graphics like in 06/07? Or do you see no need of improving the old school client?
---
Is there any plan to make the official client more competitive or even to buy a 3rd party team/ create an officially managed open source client?
---
If all wealth in osrs was distributed equally, how much would everyone have?
---
Would you accept content that is beneficial towards your swampletics account if added, or attribute it towards only being added to assist your UIM?
---
In this scenario of a spinning wheel it's blatantly obvious that it's easy mode for the rune crossbow- but what about other suggestions that may benefit you but aren't so blatant? What is your opinion on that?
---
Genuinely curious.
---
Jesus yes, I got 3 pieces in 30 minutes then spent 10 hours to get the last 1 ffs
---
Yeah but what about zulu
---
Could you explain us the current botting situation? 
---
What are the current plans and is SOMETHING going to change anytime soon? Its been years now and it feels like its stagnating/ not helping at all.
---
Are you going to implement some restrictions on newer accounts?
---
Ah, must've missed that update, thanks
---
Got a link to where I can see the proposed stats?
---
Sure thing! Iron ore could still be better money/hr if you have a high mining level or a good pickaxe, but I imagine cows would probably be better gold per hour unless your mining level is substantially higher than your combat level. I still recommend trying both though; if nothing else you'll learn a bit more about the game and you'll get to train both mining and combat a bit.
---
Once your combat level gets a bit higher, you might also want to consider training on [minotaurs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Minotaur) and later [hill giants](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hill_Giant). Those are both pretty popular F2P training spots that have decent drops.
---
Are you for real? If yes I need more info, no need to write everything, just link me
---
Just pretend you‚Äôre a girl and ask people to be your BF. They will give you gp. No one will know your age or gender.
---
Agreed. The free 2 play is just a "taste of the main course". They dont need more content. The content is what it is. Definitely agree with this man.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
You can do the same with jugs of wine now
---
The one that needs to stop posting is you, buddy.
---
Thanks, yeah i didnt click any of the links. just going to not use this email anymore for runescape accounts
---
Oh don't worry, the OSRS team is equally dreadful at delivering prizes to contest winners. Smfh.
---
1. Can we make a more reasonable buy limit that limits a merchant/merchant clan from buying out certain items very quickly. (Eg. Skilling items such as gold ores (13k - 10k), weapons and armour (8-10, to 1-2 every 4 hours) )
---
2. I would suggest adding sell limits to Grand Exchange to protect the market from price crash caused by mass, irresponsible dumping. 
---
3. G.E tax that is between 1-5% is a good gp sink in exchange of the grand exchange‚Äôs convenience it provides. With a cap on certain items will help to retain the popularity of automated trading
---
My brother did the same thing! He is a little younger than me. I‚Äôd buy his lobsters and use them to fight the dragon under hero‚Äôs guild. 
---
Bought my first piece of dragon armor that way. Got scammed for it later. Those were the days...
---
If your using blowpipe and confident in your prayer switching you should try killing one at a time. I found this much easier than stacking them like every guide recommends. If using the blowpipe and potted up you‚Äôll kill them all before Jad gets to full health again so you don‚Äôt have to worry about more healers.
---
shhhhh
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-poll-blog-ii?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=i959bd
---
Entirely depends on what tier of gear you want to PK in. Sometimes I use a salad robes set with rune gloves and I'm worth 250k if they kill me while I still have all of my potions on me. Other times I go in a basic mystics set worth anywhere from 500k-1M depending on what type of peripherals you want to carry.
---
Enough to make Karl Marx smile
---
Considering I‚Äôve seen multiple instances of osrs j mods correcting the past negligence of old contest winners, and the chaos and confusion of running a contest with most likely thousands upon thousands of applicants I‚Äôd say they‚Äôve done a pretty good job compared to the history of rs devs/mods
---
That's what happens when you think you can play Apex at the same time, just end up screwing yourself on both sides. Ah well have to do some stupid quests while it's growing, god I hate questing
---
That‚Äôs just catering to a single account again, which they don‚Äôt want to do. Honestly they should just add it if they want.
---
Uh, the second paragraph under "trading names" says that supplying gold to a RWTer (e.g. buying a name with gp) runs the risk of all involved accounts -- including yours -- being banned.
---
Ig if you know the seller isn't hoarding names you're ok, but if you go on an rsn selling website to find an open name you're risking your account.
---
Exactly. Plus they've already had a lot of updates which is more than can be said for most free games.
---
Amylase crystals can be bought for marks of grace and sold.
---
Can we make it so untradeable items like Beacon ring from Zaff and Lunar ring are stackable?
---
The dude obviously only asked because of settled, and it would benefit literally no one else.
---
I know I'm there and why I'm there because he fucking told me to teleport there. No need to tell me that I'm there after I teleported there because I literally teleported there so I know I'm there. 
---
I'm not talking shit, the fuck are you on about? It's called criticism, he isn't perfect. As I mentioned in one of my earlier posts I appreciate what he does because he does it for the community, for free. Doesn't mean I can't criticize his flaws.
---
It's fine, you rarely get it so preplanting always gives you one ready. And if you don't downgrade.
---
Runelite kinda solves that problem. More reasons to punk those noobs using the offishit client l.
---
We‚Äôve allowed you the privilege to stop posting forever
---
You're still not getting my point. Doing the fight caves for someone can be considered a real world service, which was my point. Selling infernal capes is also illegal and a bannable offence while account sharing isnt. You're not paying someone for the cape, you're paying someone for their skillset of acquiring the cape hence it could be considered a real life service. That was my point.
---
Intermediate boat wasn‚Äôt too bad for me. Couple stretches of losing a few matches but if you just zone out and work on some combat skills it isn‚Äôt the worst grind.
---
Hey that's actually pretty creative, obviously not the best method but good thinking
---
Maybe they should pay better
---
What a fucking sad life lmao
---
I wouldn't say that this is unpopular opinion. This is regular discussion in my discord.
---
We all want engine work, bots to vanish, and RWT to stop most of all.
---
Instead we get quests and in game expansions.
---
Not that these are inherently bad, would just like to see less  "content" and more development along the lines of...
---
Account security...
---
PVP's ghost town...
---
Consistent/Major engine upgrade(s)...
---
World Hop timeout...
---
Bot Management...
---
RWT punishment...
---
Just my $0.02
---
The only thing I hear from the people you're referring to is "baaaa"
---
I agree with u btw
---
This makes it to the front page like every week. I know not everyone browses Reddit daily but damn
---
Why were the pmods in the wrong
---
Every single expensive and useful item (almost) has crashed lmao... That's not raids/vorkath etc fault is it..
---
Instead of nerfing or changing bosses, bots should be killed off quicker and more efficiently.
---
They don't have to revert back to old death mechanics. They can address each point together or separately. Currently death mechanics has no punishment for death and does need to change
---
Would mean players world hopping at the GE and reporting all the rngbots, then jagex would need a more active team to deal with all the reports and bans etc
---
You mean poh owners aren't opening their houses 24/7 just out of the good of their heart? *surprised pikachu*
---
I always suspected something dodgy with them (who even gives them donations?). Well done on you for finding this out though.
---
Why would they reset?
---
Wait there's a deposit box there?
---
Hey dickhead if you think you‚Äôre so fucking great then do the quests without the guide pussy, if you‚Äôre watching the video you want a step by literal fucking step guide. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that and if you get annoyed with the timing of the video then don‚Äôt use it. It‚Äôs not like every video he makes is titled ‚Äúperfect no tick wasted osrs quest guide blah blah blah‚Äù 
---
If you look up a guide then you shouldn‚Äôt mind spending a bit more time following instructions to help you through. Anyone who is talking shit is honestly just a elitist asshole who apparently is disgusted by new players trying to do a quest anything less than perfect efficiency. SMFH.
---
Make it look like subzero
---
This is actually the Jagex gaming cave which they have in house.
---
Spoken like someone without a fucking clue about the account recovery process
---
Lmao what's next a Venezuelan server?
---
Bot detection/banning update.
---
No Ayiza and MMK. So sad
---
ok, so jagex just kicked me out while I was playing and locked my account because they thought it had been "stolen". So my question is twofold:
---
1) what does Jagex look for, exactly? All I've done today are finishing off Heroes' quest and done a few slayer tasks, the one I was doing just before getting kicked was blue dragons, which I mostly AFK'd (poorly) and banked the d'hide drops. So, is heroes' quest just so poor that Jagex thinks that anyone who actually does it is a bot, or does slayer need a redesign so it actually engages players?
---
2) Is there anything else I should do besides resetting my password? I have an authenticator and a bank pin already.
---
Should the elder maul be considered an obsidian weapon?
---
I don't think they deserve anything. They are getting a free product. They do need better bot detection however.
---
She said she had 4 stacks of coins, but with an 8b bank I'm sure the account had some in platinum tokens. If she found out what plat tokens were and how they work, there is absolutely no need to keep all the coins in 4 different max cash stacks and all the effort that takes. 
---
The 4 max cash stacks is why I'm sure the story is fake. 
---
OP does not know how max cash stacks work. And thought it is easy to have 4 at the same time. In reality it would be a real struggle. 
---
If OP would know how to deal with 4 max cash stacks, she would probably also know about platinum tokens.
---
That's unfortunate.
---
if you can‚Äôt pick a title you probably will struggle to create an entire series
---
Settled is the guy behind Swampletics, a series in which he documents his progress on his Ultimate Ironman account on which he self-imposed the restriction that he can't leave Morytania. His end goal is to beat the Theatre of Blood. 
---
To do this, he needs the best setup possible. His best in slot range is a rune crossbow. However, the only way to obtain it is to make it, and there are no crossbow strings in Morytania. Currently, his plan is to grind Hunter to 99 and catch a Lucky Impling, as they drop crossbow strings at a rate of 1/300. Adding a spinning wheel to Morytania would completely ruin this plan. The guy asking the question originally is clearly asking on Settled's behalf as his newest video just came out in which he is about to start the Hunter grind.
---
The point of an area restricted ironman is to challenge yourself and play within the restrictions of the game. Getting the mods to just add everything that's missing defeats the whole purpose. You'll see some people say that that shouldn't matter if there's actual content that could affect the game, but the spinning wheel would only ever affect Settled as no one really ever uses them. 
---
Also, there was a similar situation with an added small net spawn earlier, which he did use. But that was different for a couple of reasons: it unlocked training Hunter on the account, and it wasn't added because someone just asked the Jmods for him. If a spinning wheel does get added, Settled most likely just won't use it.
---
I sold my fish to the general store in Karamja. Was about 20k a day I think...
---
&gt;do I sound like someone whose life is a fairy tale

You sure are acting like it yeah. You sound like the type of person who'd go homeless instead of selling some Runescape gp.
---
24 here... was thieving with with like 20 people people in ardougne last night and 90% of us were 24. It was weird we all typed it at once
---
Nice way of diving into personal unwarranted degradation but okay my dude. I really don‚Äôt give literally a single flying fuck about anything to do with rs3, I‚Äôve been a player since 05 and I quit with eoc. My interest with anything rs3 ENDs at eoc. And I refuse to believe in any single fuckin way that osrs is more corrupt than rs3 but alright my dude keep enjoying your p2w SOF xp lamps and afk every single skill. Also it‚Äôs too, not ‚Äúto‚Äù but ‚Äúyour‚Äù too dumb to look past that. Huh?
---
? Ok
---
What about extreme reduced run depletion when wearing the agility cape?
---
im 23 here, been playing since i was 12. all good.

I think you should change your e-mail password  immediately and delete any bank card info from it .
---
Meleeing bandos in 2019 smh, I wouldn't trust this guy to take care of me
---
Sorry to hear about that man, that's really frustrating. I don't really have much advice, but have you tried the account management section of the website? Presumably that would tell you what you can/should do.
---
anyone who says they did this are lying, if there is no 24/7 footage of the  player and the account its guarenteed bs
---
While that is true, I think the free game is already pretty damn good and the only updates that would likely make a difference are really for people who play it long term.
---
It took me about a week, but I only picked at it in my free time. There was also some trial and error involved. I bet I could make another in five continuous hours.
---
A moment of silence to all the boys reading this that got it past 99.
---
Macca what
---
Which devalues the elite. Clown.
---
From the last ballista shot to the next ballista shot is the only delay the axes would be thrown same tick as the ballista shot or 1t later if you are abit slow the axes don‚Äôt delay the next attack of the ballista or maul at all they would hit the same time they would with or without the axes

A ranger spawned when he didn't expect it, and it may have been on the same tick as the mages. Either way, he got shredded by it.

---
&gt; 1) what does Jagex look for, exactly?
---
Any changes in address/IP is what they'd look at.  Obviously no one knows exactly as they keep their security practices air-tight, but in terms of locking an account, the activity in-game is irrelevant.
---
&gt; Is there anything else I should do besides resetting my password? I have an authenticator and a bank pin already.
---
Make sure your email is 2FA protected and your recovery questions are secure. If you have clicked on any dodgy links, it's worth doing a virus/malware scan on your computer as well. After that, then it's not a bad idea to change your password. If you use your email for other things, make sure the password is not the same as other sites.

For anybody who watched rs2 YouTube in the day, "top 10 signs the rs economy is tanking: the grand exchange gets renamed to the extra medium exchange"
---
We love mod gee, so hot
---
I guess it‚Äôs true what they say.. achieving 99 agility changes a man.
---
I'm fairly certain that Settled just said to not add one because he doesn't want Jagex to take his account into considerarion when adding content. If Jagex didn't add something because of his account that would be the same problem.
---
Are you on a VPN or something? They're allowed, but might confuse the detector.
---
Meme post to drive up price of rapier
---
Mm, well I never did understand why people wanted to push past 99 if there was no real benefit to it. And even after hearing about this 'blue symbol' crap I still don't see why it's worth it. I just figured people wanted to max out for the sake of maxing out
---
Think bad attempt at a merch post joke
---
Yes you should turn it to main, you are wasting your time in game and there is no point of getting money when you cant enjoy the full experience of the game . My advice for you is that you should start new account and use it only for PK.
---
Tbh, I‚Äôm surprised they even send messages in other languages than English.
---
I actually was about to suggest a slightly improved untradeable upgrade to the dragon dagger. nice
---
Age is actually a word
---
So just like me, you can only PK on PvP worlds every 2 weeks. Instead of being able to log on whenever you want and PK. The UK PvP worlds would be less active at US times when the US PvP worlds would be more active, and vice versa. I don't see the problem.
---
I was just about to say if she's in singles ur damage will be capped to 6 or 8 or something. If she's in multi I can hit up to 45s with craws bow. And like others said there are methods so Vene is in multi and you are not.
---
I just his from the mage phase and fought on the range phase :)
---
Right, that may be true, but all it takes is a bit of imagination to tell you that there are possibilities outside your assumptions
---
Oh, that was what I thought it just seemed really bad so I thought I might be missing something.
---
Are you a btw? If so, what axe did you use to do wintertodt?
---
Right, my bad. I realized it as I was in the car earlier and just got back, hehe.
---
100% yes you have a decent base of skills for questing which was pointless to have on a pure anyways so turn this into a main and make a new pure and just do combat and bare minimum quests.
---
What's your main's total level
---
We're all entitled to our opinions :)
---
I'm good bro thanks for asking. But really you should calm down, you seem really really REALLY angry and distraught over a post by some random dude on reddit. Please do yourself a favor, take a step back, reflect back on your life and perhaps reevaluate your priorities, because it simply is not healthy to get that angry over a post on reddit. Please. I care about you, I don't want to see you die of a massive coronary over this.

Gotcha. That's a Runelite problem or the victims problem though. 
---
Preparing and stopping other players from interacting with you (turning off accept aid to stop a tele-other notification or a gnomeball or any other player to player interaction...) is something that is well beyond the Pmod trading someone.
---
Has the team ever considered a way to combine Ancient Shards with a lesser known/niche ranged weapon (such as the Seercull or Bone Crossbow) to create a new ranged Demonbane weapon?
---
  The obvious choice here would be to suggest adding them to the Blowpipe but that already has high enough DPS, so maybe using them to revitalise an older piece of content would be cool.
---
short version: don't worry be happy :)

1. Port sarim is good to get to your tree with the cabbage tele

TBH he needed to be scammed, maybe in the future he will be less naive. you even told him what was going on and he did jack about it, dont get why you would feel bad about a kid learning that perhaps he needs to use his brain once in awhile, this is important life experience :)
---
Yeah you're right, sorry :\[
---
Can we get the nice normal spellbook teleport animation
---
&gt;**kinda good**
---
That's not me

I mean you can message Jagex about that.  I've seen them unban people when that happens, to them it just looks like RWT.  Idk if they always unban or how to prove it to them though.

Back in my day we used to have to run the lobbys to draynor to be certed.

what if i told you i didn't want sympathy... I wanted angry responses?!!

dont worry, you just got bad luck, the drop rate is 1/2 which means 50%, you are still under the drop. If you dont get in 2 kill you can get mad.

wow I'm stupid as fuck. until I read your comment I thought the spinning wheel was a reference to the link ocarina and rargh challenges where they spin the wheel that decides things for them lmao

May I join said chat?

You know that security system on highschool computers that keeps you from looking at porn? You know the one everyone had a buddy that could get by it? Yeah that's better secured.

At the risk of being wooshed, one is Pope Francis and one is actor Jonathan Pryce.

Awesome! Thanks :)

To be honest I'd love it on my HCIM... That would be a wheel super close to bank w/o having to deal with stairs every load.
---
Can you look and rework some of the skillcape perks? Some are very useful and some have almost no use at all. At the moment some skillcapes like herblore, smithing, runecrafting, and woodcutting aren't really useful for most regular accounts.. The attack skillcape also not very useful for everyone that will have it. i believe all non combat skillcapes should have a teleport to be consistent with other capes' teleports. only these few capes need a few upgrades. thoughts?
---
That chaos rune is perfect.

Swampletics isn't a permanent series for him. He wants the ToB. The grand Master quest or similar content probably isn't close enough to finish to impact settled before he has completed his goal.

Can herb sacks be filled with both cleaned and grimy herbs? The limit would still be 30 per herb, for example 10 grimy guams and 20 cleaned guams or 30 grimy guams.

Gotta get your runelite word filters guys, do you have any idea how much calmer ge chat is with it on
---
Might consider dragon cbow and dragonstone bolts (e), max hit will drop a fair bit but the total stack potential is pretty huge as it is.
---
Hahaha, got me.
---
Look at you flexing your membership.
---
It really isn't that bad, at all. Start when you can get on the veteran boat and it's a breeze. I never had one game lose and it was relatively afk. You get your points and then alt tab, yeah maybe it's not the most efficient cause you can help everyone win a bit faster but there are plenty of people playing it all the way through.
---
Western provinces*
---
i totally agree. sunday i saw a zulrah bot with 20 million mage experience :-/
---
at 99 you get the cape which gives you a 10% chance of getting the same task again, but other than that i don't think there's any difference.
---
Oh mb
---
try to complete all the quests
---
the arceus plugin from runelite falls into that category aswell... makes the minigame way too easy

\- Suck their dick whenever required.

I did this. You have to follow a guide to get the play store installed, but after that it works great.
---
If bank standing was a skill, you‚Äôd never get 99, because it would be considered training. 
---
It‚Äôs like humans and flying.

Reminds me of when I grinded out 1.5k bowstrings for my first full rune (with battleaxe because who cared back then). Took one step into varrock wildy thinking I was gonna pwn some noobs and instantly died from about 4486504582 fire blasts flying at me.

I have a cc mate, 'petrol enema' if you're interested, got some good fellas in there, it's for shooting the shit and organising playing the game together, feel free to check it out.

Good content
---
72 kc for my rune kite drop :(
---
It‚Äôs like the build on top of their issues instead of just taking responsibility. I mean the game has come a far far way, but its to the point I‚Äôve played solo for 3.5 years now, haven‚Äôt said a thing in game cause I‚Äôm afraid anything will get you hacked. Jagex support has always been a joke. Back in OG RS I got perma muted by a Pmod for calling him on Bs, I was Perma muted for 4 years before they reviewed my case and dropped it. I was active that entire time too. Got very proficient in quick chat.
---
I occasionally got German whilst I was in the UK too, depending on what device I was on. I never really figured how they decided it.
---
Good on Maiden too and certain times on P3 Verzik as well.
---
Definitely niche but it has its uses for efficiency. Blowpipe 100x better tho for ToB overall in terms of use cases
---
wont work, even on osrs release no one used it.
---
I have literally never understood the complaints. It's a social minigame that also gives combat xp and guarantees you BIS armour. It doesn't even take that long. One of the easier grinds in this game.
---
Sad part is you would probably make more working at McDs
---
Why/how do shitty people like this get any sort of following on twitch?
---
You're a very professional person.
---
battlestaffs are usually cheap and good xp, about 3 gp/xp iirc and 300k/hr
---
blowing glass is slow but afk
---
dhide bodies are fastest but also expensive
---
amethyst arrowtips are currently 2.7 gp/xp, whereas javelin heads are almost break even - you probably wanna do those instead
---
that focus! 
---
that guy knows how to fish - and he has not even begun to 3tick yet!

If you clone it through GitHub and compile it with IntelliJ, you do not receive updates unless you pull the most recent copy. If it is currently safe (I have no idea if it is even good to go in its current state) and they commit something harmful to your account or machine, it won't enact those changes until you update the branch you checked out. Same goes for Official Runelite as well. The only difference is you don't get a pretty RL icon you get a file named Runelite\*version-number\*SHADED.jar. That is the locally compiled version of whatever copy of Runelite you used (plus or not).

Runescape is a very grindy game... We shouldnt give new player false hope that its an easy game where we hold their hands like in runescape 3
---
I did demon heads for the last 15 levels or so after getting tired of being PKed at chaos altar. It was a little slower, but still great XP and super easy. I set up a cannon and just left it running while I banked in Edgeville with a glory and used the fairy ring to get back.
---
Except the big 3rd party clients literally follow the rules the people who made the game maintain.  Quite unlike what this is doing.

No the item you were getting drop on the ground and the pet take its place. Pets have an extremely high priority
---
It's hard at first until you remember shit
---
Oh I mean that‚Äôs 100% true, the spinning wheel debate is really because of swamp daddy, but that‚Äôs a different  conversation from ‚Äòshould Jagex add features that aren‚Äôt really useful‚Äô. 
---
I‚Äôm on the fence about it, settled is definitely bringing in more players, I‚Äôm sure at least a few people have seen his vids on YouTube/reddit and decided to start an account, so I can see why Jagex would support his content, but they also don‚Äôt want to give special attention to specific people
---
Sums it all up
---
Not using Runelite gpu plugin @ ZMI in 2019? Yikes.

Just make it that you don't fail any obstacle while wearing it.

---
Nice
---
Yes, I meant the optimal route for doing the runs. Thank you!
---
Fuck you. Zulrah is waste of time for fags lile you
---
Jagex absolutely do detect and ban players for certain obvious cheat 3rd party clients.
---
Jammer joh.
---
It was added (or at least asked for) because of the same restricted account, though. It just happened to not be Swampletics who was begging for it.
---
I thought the pen was silver and had to commit once I'd started ):
---
That‚Äôs for skilling pets only.
---
I have a Software Engineering degree, and my wife reallllly wants a reason for us to move to the UK...  Maybe I should apply :P
---
Seeing as how runelite plus (and exilent to a lesser extent) contains plugins that Jagex has asked the official runelite to remove, the client has already crossed the line.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion but all the rewards for prif mini games sound lackluster.
---
The sword drop itself is cool, but getting ‚Äòseeds‚Äô seems kind of off putting.
---
SUGGESTION: Instead of skilling seeds, why not drop a ‚Äòhusk‚Äô of the crystal equipment that you have to charge with shards as well fix it using the dragon pick,harpoon, and axe as previously mentioned. The lore can be something in the realm of that it‚Äôs high level equipment so you have to break down equipment of the same caliber to fix it.
---
I think it would be awesome to see a ‚Äòbroken‚Äô crystal pickaxe, harpoon, and axe on the floor/chest rather than a seed.
---
It fits the theme because people with agility capes are soulless husks barely resembling a human
---
Trading isn't against the rules, and using third party clients isn't Jagex's responsibility to monitor. You should instead be contacting whichever client's feedback group and let them know so they can do something such as limiting how often a notification can appear etc. Sucks to suck
---
If you just have a week of membership, I'd spend it doing some members quests and seeing the rest of the world. Get some rewards/XP bumps; if you're only going to be a member for a week, there's not much reason to level up members' only stats.

Are the green boxes supposed to act as targets/guides so that OP knows where he should be clicking?

What‚Äôs up with the tar and the herbs? Does he use the herb at the top because it‚Äôs less distance for the cursor to travel from that space in his inventory to the top-most ore node?

It got nerfed too lol, effectively ruining it for the purpose it was intended for

How do you even get caught for RWT? Is trading away large amounts of gold enough for a ban? I guess I just don't understand how people are actually banned

Censor is only for profanity. The game will always censor what it thinks is a website. Therefore thing like ‚Äú, gn‚Äù ‚Äú, ba‚Äù get censored.

For some reason though ‚Äú,uk‚Äù ‚Äú,ca‚Äù ‚Äú,us‚Äù dont get censored though

I recently sold my bank for dhcb and it was super worth it, would be even more so if I could afford a ward and rigour. now I'm \~350 kills in and the rebuild feels amazing. just play on the house party world and restore at someone elses' pool/nexus.

Polar kebbit fur was really valuable when I started playing for some reason. That's how I made my first 100k and it took 1 trip. I had been playing for months with no trying to sell and save all my month. After the seeing a single polar kebbit fur was worth 40k I thought I had won the lottery.

Hey, I just wanted to say thank you. Your advice to get a Rune Scimitar was very helpful. I didn't realize how easy it would be to safespot. Because I went after it my mage level is now 32 and I have a rune scimitar for when I get up to that attack level. You ended up giving me quite a few levels towards my total level goal and convince me to get the rune scimitar before I go back to free to play.
---
So uh... Thanks

Very Impressive, how long did it take you to make may I ask?

Never, I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôll give all high levelled characters (specifically Ironman) an unfair advantage as they‚Äôve had time to grind high level bosses risk free, if they reverted it now people would need to consider only bringing certain items as opposed to bis
---
I wish people would stop acting like you have to do any optional things In this game, it‚Äôs the worst part of the community hands down. If you don‚Äôt want to grind something don‚Äôt do it, it turns out its significantly more fun if you play YOUR game the way YOU want to instead of what someone at the ge tells you what you should have or do.

If Jagex actually banned the alt purely because he tweeted out the name, then it'll be plain stupid since he can just mention any person RSN that he hates as their alt so they get banned.

He probably RWTed on the alt too.

I remember having to have about 40 people added to sell leather to before the GE.

im not saying they should choose 1 and go after it , just that since that guys video half of this subreddit has completely fixated themselves on emblem farming bots like they are the worst kind of bot ever in the history of the world. 
---
i agree with you completely

Yeah I'm QA for just general software and applied for Jagex QA, seemed like a normal full contract offer to me. Either way re-allocating all that resource is mental

Its interesting /u/GorudenNeko that you say its been happening for years. If you, or anyone else could PM me reproduction steps (to the level of detail... 1) Click my bookmark tab for [https://www.runescape.com/community](https://www.runescape.com/community) 2) Press Account etc. etc. ) we would very much appreciate it. Also helpful if you could mention when it first started because the first I heard was \~a few weeks ago.
---
Well yeah, but this is back when guthans spears were over 10m, an iron man in wizard robes at level 50 isnt insulting me because I'm level 97 and dont have BiS with a tbow yet, and streamers with questionable morality dont rule the game
---
Lol I do think ‚Äúdevaluing‚Äù skills is fine because the game is played for personal achievement not to flex on others. Devaluing is also dumb because you got to use the higher levels for longer than the people who get it with the new methods. You‚Äôre probably some elitist who makes fun of noobs for not achieving max EHP when playing.
---
Props for staying classy

Switch out the platebody/legs for dhide and you'll be good to go.

I'd quit playing if I couldn't use Runelite tbh

Any reason why it took 7 years?

A pmod broke the pmod tos and then was shocked he lost status

I think hasta in general deserve a buff. 
---
Currently hasta have a negative Defence bonus when equipped making them pointless to equip/use. If they could offer some Defence or no negative Defence I would consider using them. 
---
As far as I can tell most weapons in the game do not give such a negative defense bonuses such as hasta‚Äôs do.! I mean the dragon hasta gives -15  on some stats. If the hasta purpose is just for fashion then fine but it doesn‚Äôt make since if you compare it to the majority of weapons.

Who is the most special OSRS streamer?

Yeah 60 attack is a lot better but if you want to go 75 it‚Äôll be fine, just not quite as optimal

That's not selfish. Take a look at when osrs first came out. Not adding ge would have killed the game
---
Lol if you hate everything about the game so much, then quit. You honestly are the most annoying type of person because you only wanna bitch about the game sucking.

Cya at the bottom

the only barrows item I got in the original RS2 before quitting was torag hammers and I loved them. Used them constantly to get to 87 str lol

Not everyone plays to make max gp/hr

No, I am a practising lawyer in a country with a common law almost identical to that of the UK. 
---
&gt;Breach of tos is almost never held up in court when said activity isnt against the law.
---
Absolute nonsense. "Breach of tos" is breach of contract and it is not, in any way, dependant upon whether the conduct in question is criminal. Subject to statutory modification (e.g some specific consumer law that might modify the common law) the law of contract is almost identical in the UK, USA, Australia, NZ etc. Your statement is entirely inaccurate. 
---
&gt;It is not copyright infringement either as long as u dont claim to own or to sell ownership of said virtual item
---
This is absolute nonsense. Profiting from the unauthorised use of someone else's intellectual property is a civil wrong. Yes, defences might apply but none have anything to do with "whether someone claimed to own or to sell ownership of said virtual item." What you said is barely even coherent, much less accurate in any possible way.

Indeed, come to think of it selling gold might even be tortious interference.
---
&gt;people sell gp as account progression which is a service.
---
Entirely irrelevant to any of the points being discussed.
---
why? wiki says this boss has a magic attack but doesnt explain when its used or how bad it is. 
---
should i be using prayer against it? is monkfish good enough of a food? would red dragonhide be good enough? i could level it up to 60 to unlock it. i also typod in OP, its not 85 its 58 right now.
---
Oh I'm sorry I'm trying to keep my game legit and fun for all, rather than have some mr moneybags buy his way into it.
---
Ah man I remember being 6 years old
---
You mean you set up the anti-bot protection?
---
Goblins confirmed 413k/kill

Just stand outside of nmz for a while to see proof
---
Yeah I think it would make sense to add it, but since no one has ever cared about one being there until it posed a problem for Settled, it would feel wrong to do it. I mean, there is already a mystery net spawn to let him train hunter. Settled is happy with the notariety he's gained already, he doesn't want any special treatment
---
For me ground items, idle notifier, loot tracker, menu entry swapper, tile markers. 
---
I don‚Äôt like the gpu one personally
---
This is completely wrong, I would suggest reading up on law.
---
How did it differ from the current system?
---
&gt; Lol I do think ‚Äúdevaluing‚Äù skills is fine because the game is played for personal achievement not to flex on others. Devaluing is also dumb because you got to use the higher levels for longer than the people who get it with the new methods.
---
Holy shit we found one in the wild. Imagine actually thinking this.
---
I would assume if you're buying like 100+mil then you might raise some red flags, but as the other guy said they are probably more worried about sellers than buyers
---
Interesting verse choice
---
Why does mod Ash look so exhausted after his coffee drink loooooool
---
Lol imagine playing the game for the purpose of fun and not just flexing on others.
---
If you have the ability to get Arclight, do so. It trivializes the fight so much. Not only does it hit the boss itself harder, but it allows you to one shot the orbs he summons that raise his defense. 
---
That said, I have similar combat stats to yours and I never really had a problem killing him (w/Arclight). Just remember to bring a stamina pot since you have to do a lot of running around to the orbs!
---
Daddydaut
---
I'm pretty sure basically everyone plays this game for the purpose of fun mate, literally the only people who want skills to be easier are the people who want to personally benefit from that (e.g the people wanting to flex on others.)
---
I agree, but I'm also not trying to pretend like I've always felt something was wrong with Canafis because it lacked a spinning wheel. And you probably haven't thought of it before this podt either.
---
Exactly because Runescape is a fantasy world, we don't need to apply a whole lot of unnecessary logic. I mean, should we add toilets or dung heaps to every city, because the npcs supposedly eat and digest? I personally think not.
---
thank goodness.
---
As much as I use to hate the fact the dev team was serious whenever they were considering to make the Swamp man's life easier just for visual satisfaction, it's a perspective that should have been brought earlier. Devs shouldn't working if they have a very logocal reason to add content just for a one-off ironman.
---
Glad I saw that response.
---
Using melee you are going to struggle without arclight man range with ruby bolts is what I use on my 60 att but your range is low
---
Imagine thinking those existed back in the day
---
1600kc never seen one btw
---
German was the second most popular language on the internet for many years. It's the second largest language in Europe too.
---
You're stats are fine, equipment not so much. You should be using an arclight if you can, arclight will one shot the eye balls around the room. I personally use a blessed dhide top and Verac's skirt, you're going to want some more mage defence in there. When in melee distance of him, play melee and he will hit you with magic, and when running around the room to get the eye all spawns pray mage.
---
And as a side note, work on torso and barrows gloves :p
---
it hits hard
---
No, I would want the skill to be faster so that I can get to the more fun content faster. I honestly don‚Äôt see how you‚Äôre getting to the logic you‚Äôre using, but idk what I expect from someone like you.
---
It is weird that the zamorakian hasta gives positive defence bonuses but all other hastas give negative defence bonuses.
---
Hyphonix talked for 2 hours at the start of that stream about how tired he is of OSRS. He wants to be out of debt and wants to quit staking. It definitely wasn't a case of them splitting, unless you're saying that it's fair that the account got recovered. I don't know how you can possibly defend account theft unless you're someone who steals accounts
---
This is still how I do it
---
So many people on this sub will just blindly defend everything Jagex does. Happens all the time.
---
The wiki uses that placement for links to strongly related articles (money making methods, strategy guides, quick guides for quests, etc) so I'd avoid tuning it out there
---
to be fair they didn't say when they started playing the game.
---
The crazy thing is, It was because of the "Newness" of video games to most of us that made it so. Now they're are 13 year old pro Fortnite players.  
---
If Runescape released and only 8-14 year olds played it again. It would still be effiencyscape. Younger players are so much better, So no matter what that magic will never be recaptured by a game. 
---
But man was it fun. 6 years and my account has half the overall Xp this account has in like 11 months
---
Hahahaha you're still a madman! That's so much grinding lol. But yeah that must have been nice!

well if you're not going to bother to read my reply then no i won't give one, especially when you end your comment showing anger and emotion.

i read your first point, about people not leaving morytania.. which is completely irrelevant as outsiders can enter morytania and they would be bringing their wares with them, is the rest of your comment as bad as the first point? i guess we will never find out unless you get your emotion under control and learn how to communicate without letting it overflow

No they shouldn't. Jagex states in their rules, in the stronghold of security, or somewhere, that you are welcome to make a new account and start again if you get banned. This guy shouldn't have been banned on his Ros account unless they found him RWT on that one as well.

This is a lie.

It‚Äôs not like the adults commenting would care. They u defat and Jagex is a company with regulation and real world law to adhere to. Tsuggestion is just not  realistic without Jagex having to re-market the game, most likely pay some sort of fees and just change shit to comply with modern laws.

I think you entirely missed the point of my comment, but alright.
---
To everyone saying ‚Äúdifferent teams‚Äù or whatever Jagex could still dedicate a month or so to game fixing in general. Like have content devs work on dead or broken content instead of designing new things. Have graphical artists fix super ugly or broken items / animations. Also obviously have security and botting be repaired on the side too.
---
But that will never happen because it‚Äôs not as hype and marketable as adding a new massive quest or something, even if it‚Äôs ultimately better for the game.
---
Honestly, I think this is all made up, why are you replying to me?
---
I totally agree with ranged being super strong atm, but I still feel adding in a Demonbane ranged weapon (that isn't total crap ie Holy Water) shouldn't be hindered by the face that range is super strong.  I can't think of too many instances where ranged is used vs demons over say an Arclight.  But you are right, a balance pass to bring ranged down a couple pegs is also needed.
---
They look mouldy and old, but I'd give it a try. Gotta respect the rs reference
---
I always thought he looked familiar
---
Name change, then delete from friends. Maybe give him the gold back if you really care
---
Interesting, I didn't think about that. I've just watched a lot of pk streams where people will splash on meleers when they have max mage gear (Amenity streams pretty much). The only reason I could think of is because the base accuracy of mage is low and the base defense is high. I guess putting more accuracy on the weapons would solve that problem too in a different way.

Players can get support without posting on reddit, it's just that you see so many people post fake stories on here after they were rightfully turned down due to their own breaking of the rules in game. A very small percentage of the posts on reddit are actually genuine and deserving of help from Jagex, so when people say "Players can only get support by surpassing 100 upvotes on reddit", it's just an extreme over-exaggeration. I'm not saying their system is perfect, but most people who need customer support do get it from the right place, it's an extremely small minority of players who end up needing to reach out on social media for help, so if you're going to discuss the issue, at least be truthful about the problem.
---
Authenticator delay would be nice though, that's really the biggest problem right now I'd say.

If Ash believes the change should be implemented, it shouldn't then *not* be implimented due to the simple fact that your account exists.
---
The Small Fishing Net for instance was specifically asked for because a Morty locked ironman wanted to be able to use it. No one was suggesting it outside of that context, yet Ash agreed that a fishing net spawn would be apt and adding it in.

I remember legit thinking the anti was the strongest shield you could get when I was little, my logic being "if it can defend against the strongest monsters in the game it's gotta be the best."

There's also the guy in the fued who goes on a poop break

Settled is playing on an account with self-restrictions.
---
If Settled doesn't want to take advantage of an update, it's his choice to do so or not.
---
I'm just saying, if Settled thinks that the update will ruin something for his self-restricted account, then he can choose to not make use of that update by self-restricting himself more. He could restrict himself from using updates that didn't exist before he created his account, or something along those lines.
---
But if other players want it, and jmods believe it's a reasonable idea, I think self-restricted accounts shouldn't try to stop reasonable updates from happening because it would affect their self imposed ruleset.
---
tried it and its not doable at all. i can survive him but not for long, in 4 minutes i had to eat 15 sharks out of the 20 i brought with me, he hits me with magic when i'm meleeing him and its just not doable.
---
Where has he admitted this? This just isn't true.
---
Depends on slayer level but people usually cannon squah, trolls, hellhounds, dags, black demons, really anything with a high count of monsters to kill. Really you should cannon every task you can for truly efficient slayer but my point was more that blue drags arent good xp for ranged or slayer. Better to get through a task like that quickly by doing babies so you can move on to a better task.
---
Or not pay them through a middleman?
---
None of us liked the summoning part which is why we would vote no to it... you realize the warding blog wasnt an all or nothing type deal right

---
You can prolly manage but with your gear it‚Äôs going to be an unnecessarily tough fight. I really recommend doing the quests for arclight before fighting skotizo. And you 100% do not want to wear your rune and dragon armor, you will protect from melee and be tanking mage hits so any slot that doesn‚Äôt have offensive bonus should have mage defense bonus.
---
When will we hear more about the future plans for Slepe?

---
The delay of your next hit is based on the last attack you did. Which is why shortbow to 2h works so well. Maple shortbow hits every 3 ticks. Mage is 5t. 2hander is 7t. Switch to a r2h from a shortbow and it'll hit one more time at 3t speed, but after that you have to wait the 7 tick 2h delay until you attack again. If you stood far away you might be able to get a magic to melee stack.

If you level slayer with combat you'll probably be around the 100m range by the time you're 100 even without skilling. Add in things like bird house and herb runs and getting 100m by 100cb is a no brainer.

iPhone has a built in feature for that. Settings -&gt; controlpanel and it‚Äôs somewhere there to put it in your controlpanel.
---
&gt;the plugins or features that are integrated would be maintained through updates. 
---
Right and that's exactly the problem. For an actual company to publish code it needs to be maintained to ensure that it continues to work and cannot just break stuff. That means that it isn't as simple as just "buy osbuddy, make it the main client" cuz now the standards of quality required of the things osbuddy offer have to be brought up to (and maintained at) full release standards all the time.

I'm an ironman who has started again recently, I finished ds2 a while ago and I'm going to camp vorkath for a while. What's my best options for for the most kills per hour? I don't have super antifires so I'm not sure if that takes blowpipe off of the table? RCB is my best crossbow, I'm 99 range and I have fremmy elite done if that factors into what weapon I should use. Cheers
---
The odds shit actually breaks retroactively is tiny. Either way I don't see why they wouldn't keep the plugins open source, because people would still write them for free
---
The story isn't even real... this whole story was basically a big lie. That's pretty evident now.
---
You are not making 1.5m/hour at barrows, $100% lol. You might be at zulrah depending on skill. Vorkath can jump you quite a bit, if you have the gear and skills to kill it effectively. Idk what to tell you man, it should not come as a surprise that with worse stats and gear you would make worse money lol

You have to drink a dose every 2-3 minutes. With absorbs you need to flick rapid heal or lower your hp every 1 minute. It‚Äôs quite a difference

You can completely negate any prayer potions/food once you get the spec restore pool. Blast him with a double spec from the blowpipe and you end up with more hp than you started the fight with.

The highest level armor you can wield and afford. If you click on Attack and Defense (sometime strength bu it's rare) in the skill page you should see what armor and weapons you can wield.

If you're talking about the special version of armor, like gilded rune armor or trimmed armors, you should avoid those since they offer nothing but fashion. Just buy the armor with no parentheses at the end.

Lol this entire post was a fucking gigantic lie. The fact that there are that many morons that think this is LEGIT need to have some skepticism, honestly. And you are spot on too btw.

When I press the f keys it changes my volume, brightness etc unless I hold fn, then it changes my inventory, prayer menu, etc. is there a way to switch it so that it changes my menus by default and changes my brightness and volume when I hold fn?

man I started playing around a Christmas event and I swear I was stuck in Lumby/Draynor/Al Kharid for the first month I played because I couldn't figure out how to go anywhere. Friend took me to Varrock through the east gate from lumby (on a journey that felt like it took 10 minutes, when in reality it was probably 3), I grabbed a yo yo from Santa, banked it and got sniped by the dark wizards. I don't think I found Varrock again for a few more weeks. I was a dumb 8 year old.
---
Imagine if they were mandatory...
---
Eh I was definitely in the same camp as you not too long ago regarding degradable armor. But there‚Äôs a few barrows pieces that you really want to have if you want to do higher level bossing. And I also don‚Äôt use barrows gear for general pvm/slayer. Pretty much exclusively used for bossing. And 15 hours of bossing (the time in combat it takes for a piece to fully degrade) will net you plenty of profit to not even think twice about the repair cost.
---
But by all means play how you wanna play, it‚Äôs about have fun and making your own goals.  And if you‚Äôre not keeping the armor that‚Äôs just more profit from barrows anyways. That‚Äôs great you have ibans staff, it‚Äôs great for leveling mage from 50 (when you unlock ibans blast) until 75 or when you can afford a trident. Plus doing ibans staff at barrows is great because you make back more than enough death runes to sustain it.
---
Right, idk what I was thinking. Wonder how bad it would be if you didn't use rapid heal and never re asborbed
---
Okay thankyou man
---
I was just in that world and saw that! Weird.
---
No. Just like lots of other games it's played by everyone so happens to have kids on it sometimes. Specially since it was one of the few decent F2P back then.
---
Spec does not matter when using DHCB. You're already going to get 4-6 kill trips consistently even without moonwalking.
---
Prayer is standard for pures to have on p2p so if you are choosing between def and prayer train prayer. A lot of p2p builds do get defence, but it gets complicated and you need to know what you are doing and aim for a specific account build.
---
If you want you can bring a bp for healing, but other than that I don't think anything is worth it.
---
Well Jagex shouldn't care about 1 single player's opinion or progress
---
Lmao fair I somehow didn't read the tag so that ones my bad, you don't have to be so defensive. I'm not offended at all, not sure where you're getting that from, I just wanted to explain my point of view. All I was trying to say is that the barriers to entry really aren't comparable.
---
Spec weapons are unnecessary when using the DHCB imo

aren't we all just mindlessly grinding stats?

Rigour not piety ;)
---
Theres heavy deflation in osrs because of the arena tax. No need for any extra goldsinks.
---
I could see it if they added a location where you pay a set amount of gold to stay a set amount of time, and have a chance at a set amount of loot.  This way it isn't really "gambling" in the traditional sense - but just another pvm feature
---
Lol he put it on the internet, it's as good as true now
---
Agreed.
---
ü¶ÄCRAWDADü¶Ä
---
This is great üòÅ
---
I want to join them because they cleared my team using WATER STICKS and less opts, while my team had +1's and more people. A team that can do that earns my respect. And how do you know they RWT? No proof = false accusation my friend.
---
TIL suncream is a thing nice
---
Upstairs is faster
---
I think it looks more like a bunny
---
that was my initial thought, perhaps it was ash first or else it defaulted to thinking you were making a restore pot
---
This has been suggested many times but requires an age limit to be added to the game for gambling content.
---
Awesome, I appreciate the information. I like the idea of 70,75,80,99. Thanks for taking the time to write that out
---
Nah, you use piety so you can pistol whip Vorky with the DHCB.
---
But Barkindoggo, you work at Jagex.
---
ü¶ÄSteven Mctowelie is a towel ü¶Ä
---
I feel like that's an exception since it was an issue caused by jagex, but I guess you're right the infrastructure is technically there. I guess more my point is that it's a case by case basis so it's inefficient if not impossible to return items to players who submit requests based on being scammed as that happens literally all the time. Also just a separate thought, I've heard WoW has a pretty good item return system for situations like this but I'm not an expert.
---
You said *probably* an now implying I'm wrong when you didnt even 100% know.
---
What a dick /s

Scrub. If you cut right of the wheat field. You can avoid the fence around the cart guy.
---
Man getting to cwars before i found out about duel rings was the fkn worst
---
Probably cause Elvarg is a fucking green dragon, look up elvarg on the wiki and look at the small associations and similarities
---
Crossbow is more profit
---
Ok, but you literally can do combat completely AFK. PC is a little hard to do true AFK, but there are tons of things in this game that allow AFK training. Maybe you just don't know about them?
---
Sand crabs, smithing runs, NMZ... The list goes on. All AFK training but with varying durations of afk periods
---
800m to 2b is Nice
---
This is actually really well done. Goodjob
---
Theyll just level their bots past aggro. Go to varrock west mine. There's a mugger there, but all the bots are level 13, so they don't get attacked.
---
Hahaha same!
---
In all honesty in UK you will make the same annual salary collecting rubbish/recycling as the high end of what Jagex might pay you and be a lot less stressed, have a lot more free time and still be able to play OSRS for fun.
---
You could pre-right-click the fishing spots to make it easier to follow them. You can always reach every spot from either of the spots either side of Zul-Onan and if you're one of the edge spots and you can't follow the fishing spot, you know it'll be on the far side so it's not too hard to find again.
---
3rd age armour, elysian shield, etc
---
The fight caves doesn't even require prayer flicking.
---
I work in data security that leverages block chain, this is very true. Anything that requires an immutable ledger (like runescape transactions) could in theory be written to chain, that‚Äôs just an expensive operation for a game. But it would be an interesting use case, especially because there is real world value to rsgp. Some lite blockchain that isn‚Äôt decentralized (not needed here) could work really well for tracking gold going through the game
---
Cocaine is a helluva drug
---
One in Morytania
---
i got pked at the wildy altar for 20 dragon bones, teled back out in same world because i cba to hop and they showed up under me while i was doing the inv. thought that was pretty funny.
---
You can minigame teleport to cwars every 20 minutes.
---
Upstairs bank is quicker than basement bank
---
Yeah that didnt exist 15 years ago pal
---
Wear full armor, no ammy dragon hide vambraces and you should have under -65 and then just attack with fire strike as the cheapest. Its about 13k xp per hour and not to expensive.
---
Same hahaha
---
When hitting the limit for the world hopping too much in a short space of time, could we get a game message to tell us how long until we can hop again?
---
How does the world hop timer work anyway, and why is there even a limit?
---
that's honestly the bigger problem. if randoms worked more like pets as far as being clicked, it'd be less annoying to manage
---
I'm only 73 def with Ibans and a Dragon C Bow to clear, so unless Dharok is in the tunnels, only one dose per run. It takes about 6 seconds to break a tab, recharge prayer, and break another tab back, so you really arent losing much time.
---
Karils bow has a longer range and faster speed, it made my first cape a joke tbh.
---
You admitted to breaking a different rule...greg
---
Soooo good LMAO
---
When enchanting rings of wealth, do we always have to enchant them at the fountain of rune or just the first time?
---
Even then legal action means nothing depending on the disturbers geographical location, if their in Russia or Middle East, nothing will happen.
---
7*
---
so many memes in one post
---
Apparently it‚Äôs on the wiki for compost potion as another user pointed out
---
The difference is that walking more doesn‚Äôt actually make anything more difficult, just more time consuming. UIM have to train and boss differently then a main or Ironman would, and with a lot more risk too.
---
Maples go for 7....
---
[Oh boy, am I learning!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese-eating_surrender_monkeys)

Trust me that's how I fell about the situation. I was literally watching somebody stream lastnight doing the same thing I did.
---
In all reality gaining 100% in any house doesn‚Äôt take much time or effort at all, so I would recommend knocking them out now so you don‚Äôt have to later.
---
It doesnt make sense considering the size of the bones though.
---
Sweet baby Jesus
---
This is literally the best idea ever.
---
reeepost
---
don't you just have to wear the bracelet when the monster dies? it would be slightly less afk but it would still extend the task
---
Lol sad but true.
---
You can enchant them anywhere but you can only *charge* them at the fountain of rune
---
Can we have the ability to put nature ales in our poh?
---
just a technical question:
---
is brute forcing even possible? i always thought proxy ips are limited and expensive.
---
can't imagine the bots to have 1million+ ips to sustain this.
---
genuinly curious :)
---
Not sure but open rsc is an open source rsc game
---
Hey! I've done about 3k BBD kills until I farmed up enough money to buy Dragon Hunter Crossbow. I've pretty much tested every method I could think of to see the most profit. TLDR: Use crossbow and D'hide.
---
You'll want to use Armadyl Crossbow, hopefully with Anguish, and Blessed D'Hide for your gear. Ammo would be Diamond Bolt (e) though Amethyst Broad Bolts are really close.  Once you get DHCB, you should switch to Elite Void.   
---
Due to the price of darts and scales, the speed of a Blowpipe will get you on average an extra 2 trips per hour, which is also similar to the speed of the DHCB. But Blowpipe is also about double the cost per hour compared to using a crossbow. Double the cost isn't really worth the average 2 trips per hour honestly. Besides, using crossbow will allow you to afk more.   
---
Though this data is also catered towards my prayer level, which was around early to mid 70s the whole time I did this. The primary costs come from ammo with secondary costs from prayer pots. Maybe with a lower prayer level and high range, blowpipe might win out, but I wouldn't even bother.
---
thanks a lot &lt;3
---
wtf  was't it 14
---
If group Ironman comes into the game, will players in the same group be able to attack a monster together? It would be really cool to have team pvm be a part of the mode.
---
No I recieved the pet like any regular pet. But when you try and take it underwater it gives a message that says your pet doesnt wanna go down there. I think I have a screenshot of me getting the pet if I find it I'll post it
---
You can get 8 patches (2 troll, one hosidius, farm guild, draynor/fally, ardougne, morytania, and catherby). The one on Harmony is the 9th. I buy a buttload of seeds. If you don't want to do snapdragon or are pretty low in farming I'd suggest sticking to avantoe with ultracompost. The bottomless bucket is expensive but a worthwhile investment since you get 2 uses out of 1 ultracompost.
---
Ali the traitor lol, he never shows back up because he cant find a toilet.
---
I suggest another GE be put into Argounge back in like 2008. 11 years later here we are.
---
No problem man, he makes good vids.
---
I don't mean password brute forcing, I'm talking about the method that bots use to make money now.
---
Traditionally, they did it subtly and tried to go months or years in little bites and played like a real human.
---
Now, they don't bother to even look like a human. They just log in, powerplay without pause, and do everything as quickly as possible. They know the detection will catch them and boot them out in x amount of days no matter how they try to look, so they just stopped caring about resembling humans.
---
Maybe he's a range pure
---
What does the team plan to do with Nightmare Zone if warding fails? Will it still get a little visual makeover?
---
Huh, neat. You found an oversight. ;D
---
I've never seen them that high
---
You cant rely on staking because it's a losing game. Unless you can find an edge, which I'm sure 1 isnt available at max main staking, the 2% tax will be unbeatable
---

Dude you need to take some deep breathes and calm down. I get that you‚Äôre an adult, and because of that you shouldn‚Äôt be getting this tilited.

Thanks thieving host! LOL I‚Äôve never been this lucky
---
How can you even afford a PoH, but not have blowpipe or 75 magic for trident?
---
Normal void and dragon crossbow. Either OP is &lt; 75 range, an ironman, or doesn't know that a bp is better
---
Runelite is actually better than OSbuddy. Thank you fam

In 2007 I was 10 years old and compared to my classmates then I wasn't very good, I somehow went from bronze armour straight to black and then after a couple months of playing I finally got to mithril while my friends already had full Zamorak. Then again, I always enjoyed questing and skilling more than combat.
---
It's cause they're afk
---
Lol everyone wants stuff for free, I‚Äôm fine with grinding, but having a life makes 400 hour grinds for a single skill unrealistic.

But barrows is just 0-1 dose per run depending on who is in the tunnels.
---
If you wear pants, you won‚Äôt need suncream to protect your meat
---
I think they should just max everyone out like in LMS. All of the useful CW rewards are Pure focused and Purea suck ass in CW (especially Obby Maulers). Makes people grinding for the rewards have a bad time because they can barely contribute and also sours the game for all the people just playing for fun.
---
Nothing gets by you
---
Herb and Birdhouse runs are the best ways to maintain a bond early on. Having only a week probably won't be realistic, but once you get them started then you can easily maintain a bond with just them.   
---
As for your first bond... You could probably get a few runecrafting levels and run lavas/astrals, not sure how much you'd be getting paid an hour without 75 RC but you should be able to still get enough for a bond in a few hours. That'd probably be your best low requirement bet to get a bond in a week off fresh account.
---
Also... It's definitely worth getting members ASAP. Everything is much quicker as a member, and there are a lot of quests to catapult you through the early levels (Take combat for instance... You can spend hours and hours getting 40 atk/str, or you can do like 3 quests that take about an hour in total.)
---
Plot twist: Your main account actually responded positively to this post
---
So i can cast in dhide? Nice.
---
Well, I think you won - nothing tops this.

could we see some sort of in game gambling to deter player run games of chance? perhaps you could restricted access until a later level as well to deter new player from losing they few gp's they have as well? ex. CL 60

Most of them are hip to this now and just leave with your 50k lol
---
This ruins my spinning wheel-combat-locked ultimate iron man.

Do you think anyone is playing the minigame to have fun? No. If it weren't for the void equipment it would be dead content.

Do most OSRS players take more than one attempt to get their fire capes?

Smallexplamp is pretty far along in his from f2p to main series. Started on a brand new account, now up to a 1750 total main that has made like 250m or so. Goes through a lot of stuff that helps do what he did.

oh my god what the fuck
---
Nobody would want it if not for Swampletics
---
I support this idea much more than OP's.  OP's suggestion doesn't address any of the problems with castle wars.  You should be supplied with all ammo and runes you need in game because otherwise the winning team is the team with the most or better maxed mains throwing money.
---
What quests are those??? I already farmed up to 23 atk/str/def but haven‚Äôt done like any quests
---
It's neither. You just need the unfinished potion first
---
I got my first head at 156 and the pet at 1106

They don't have to know that they're going to the deepweb. I think you overestimate both the difficulty and the opaqueness of the process.

Hes using a dragon crossbow, and it doesnt seem like he has a spec weapon. A 64 BGS spec brings kill time from 5 minutes to 2.

My original idea was to have 5+50% of current prayer points, but if that was the case, a prayer pot that restores 29 points per dose, you can use redemption like 3 times before you run out of points. You‚Äôd literally be able to have a ridiculous amount of HP, and it would make it a massive buff to the prayer. That is why I suggested 20+50%, to avoid this.

You have three ways of going about this.
---
One- take the moral high ground and stop getting gp from him. Whether ghosting or whatever, as long as you stop taking his money
---
Two- keep digging yourself deeper and flirt back. He might be more willing to give you more or even share items with you, but its kind of gay. This is the path you are headed down now.
---
Three- tell him you just see him as a friend and you don't like when he flirts, but act flirty and extra nice ONLY when we gives you money. Eventually this could go as far as "if you get me a twisted bow, I'll be your girlfriend." Play it slowly. This is pretty evil but it will manipulate him into giving you more, you'll be creating a link in his mind between giving you money and getting affection. Don't do this if you have a soul lol
---
There was a time when this would be ban worthy but now $ &gt; integrity.
---
But as far as mobile goes you could try a stylus just for general things if your fingers are a problem.
---
Down there by the fire is where home base was for my old f2p clan years and years ago. I remember the leader cooking fish on that fire and trading it to my friend and I after we dutifully held back the zombie horde.
---
people act like you need break up with runescape just stop playing you dont need a sob story if you want to play again when you got some time go ahead i dont get these kind of posts lol
---
I had a nooby clan come crash me. Lv 100 something enters the room wearing regular void melee (I‚Äôm trio with maxed range, maxed melee with claws, and tank). Stays for a few kills, his clanmate/friend enters and tells him to hop to a diff world. Clanmate logs, I tp out to force him to tank, he was DC‚Äôd and dies. I re-enter room and continue, he never comes back so he lost his items.

What‚Äôs the fun if you don‚Äôt take risks?

Come join 'Relax CC', friendly people, always willing to help, many clan event like skilling, bossing, pking, raids (also teaching raids). Been in the cc for over a year now, all toxic people usually leave or get kicked fast because nobody likes them. The cc reqs are 100cb, barrows gloves and fire cape but if you're not too far away from that you'll be more than welcome.
---
I exclusively go the first way. Always have since childhood

What def you at because at around 70 def i was only parying against dharok karil and guthan and could comfortably tank the rest. Occasionally would have to use a single does when id get either karil or dharok tuns.

Be careful, sandcrabs exist irl

10% is really small, only 1/4 of the time. Plug it into the dps Calc

What is the little icon below the spec orb?

Do remember that legit players do camp master farmers as well, some lvl 70s with non suspicious stats could just be grinding Desert treasure requirements for example
---
Yes
---
&gt; I've done this (not for RWT, obviously).
---
Drop trading? No shit, that has literally nothing to do with a secondary party scamming you, because you decided to do a convoluted trading method that opens you up to ambiguity. 
---
If you're really so naive to believe that someone on the internet wouldn't try to scam you, I have to ask if you've ever actually played this game before?
---
Will there be a sequel to the of life. That makes it useful. Like adding blue dragon scales with a feather to make a chragon(chicken. Dragon) that can drop noted scales etc.

Osrs is becoming a God damn joke! Fire your bots up! You wont be banned anyways..

I saw a comment voicing concerns about new content being used much. My thought was that it could be interesting to see unique rewards from skilling bosses that are used for those skills
---
You‚Äôre so right. It‚Äôs the only place where ramen serials cost more than the finished product
---
It applies to both Ive seen normal people first hand get banned for using dice bots.
---
It, just like every other rule, is applied so haphazardly that people dont feel the rules exist at all.
---
Yep! I made 10m by the time I got the pet
---
That‚Äôs why I said skills lol. If 99.99% of the time you‚Äôre spending on the game is just a time grind, that means the time commitment is what makes it hard. Obviously the single piece of hard PVM content is the exception.
---
You use the  attack style "aim and fire" not by clicking the red dot in middle of arrows.
---
Popes are battlepopes
---
oh.. so basically the more prayer points you have the more it heals you... ya that would be more reasonable. have it scale with your prayer.

tru, but thats a different brand of player design

So once I start my membership should I head right to a member and start things like the tree gnome village? Or just work my way through the nap?

This is a discussion about historical methods of killing barrows when it first released in 2005.

Fuck I‚Äôve been back and forth between conversations about Barrows I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to which ones I was still in. Oops. I was even less efficient back in 2005, fuck ancients my magic level back in the day was uselessly low

&gt;I'm not saying it wasn't rwt though.

You're arguing with no one.

What would you estimate the GP/h for trident+bp Zulrah to be at for a maxed account with only Zenytes as BiS upgrades? I find myself making a consistent ~2.4m/h blowpiping Vork, I'm wondering if it's worth putting the time in to learning Zulrah. I should really just be learning CoX, but Olm's been super stressful the last few times I've gone and I hate having to make other people put up with how awful I am

---
You know, I feel like I've had a conversation about this before and I can't quite remember why we didn't fix it at that point.
---
I've done some Unsolved mysteries level detective work and backtracked to how this happened:
---
Originally, in [this blog post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/dev-blog-fossil-island?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=huljrw), we stated the compost potion would be level 17 to make (likely to fill in a bigger gap).
---
From [feedback on this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/64yysb/dev_blog_fossil_island), specifically from [GentleTractor seen here](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/64yysb/dev_blog_fossil_island/dg653xl/), it looks as though his feedback identified that Harralander needing level 20 to be **cleaned**. Early level potions (the first 2 herbs, not Harralander) only require the cleaning level to create the unf's the next 2 herbs in level order to my previous knowledge only required +1 to the cleaning level and we either likely given it an extra level req than the cleaning because we wanted to fill an empty gap (it's empty for a reason I now see!) **or** by the looks of the things, the [wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Herblore) (which I likely used during the time of Fossil Island) indicated the unf pot requires 21 to create (+1 from the cleaning) and we may have taken that verbatim.
---
Anyway, now that's over, onto fixing it... we'll likely up the level required to make the compost potion as opposed to dropping the level required to make unfs.
---
Thanks!
---
Feel free to use runelite or osbuddy however keep in mind it is a  use at your own risk thing. Any updates that the clients put out do have the possibility of triggering bot detection software and in turn get ur account a temp or perm ban. Also some plug ins are notable for trigging this software such as the old zulrah plugin.

Yes that is kinda my problem with the game.. it has gone too far and the worst part is everyone is okay with it, jagex included. I remember the times where 1m was a sick amount of money that couldn't be achieved with just launching a software for a couple of hours. Do you have any idea of how many people left the game because of this.. the game has become a complete joke but since wow is launching their vanilla servers again I will go over there but still I want to log on and actually enjoy the game and not be trying to talk to computers 70% of the time playing..
