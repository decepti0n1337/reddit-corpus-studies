Jagex is british, owned by chinese

---
So i wanted to convert before giving it to him to sort of have a good indication of where my work ends and his starts. He is just gonna play as a normal ironman and try to go for pets mainly. As for the clue stashes i didnt dip into any of them cause i figured normal irons use it so why bother.

Not a thing
---
I’ve only ever seen this pic on this sub, any one know the context or origin?  Hands down a classic
---
why tho lmao 1 vorkath alt probably beats this in terms of value.
---
My point is that if they want to be an edge lord and spite vote that is pretty much as valid as anyone else’s reason. These kind of flaws are present in all polling systems
---
I mean gosh i maxed the account back in highschool 2 years back. Its been sitting for a long ass time and i dont care about the game much anymore.
---
Will it be f2p? Also when is agility becoming f2p?
---
You do it like this.

You forgot the part where he knocked her up and moved back to Lithuania
---
Well what the fuck, I spent like 2 months grinding that character from fresh, to get obby armor and high construction level, it can't just disappear..
---
And if I didn’t :)
---
I like the idea but surely this will only lead to fixed matches and clans betting against themselves... You wouldn't be able to have spectators gamble on it
---
It’s bullshit. Would be cool if they could integrate runelite. Sucks about your items, how much did you lose?
---
Happy Leif erikkson day
---
K. And I'll file that under "not a good or convincing argument." Especially in this case where the drop rate isn't going to change, only the effective drop rate for players that kill monsters both in P2P and F2P. Do I not deserve the cape as much as you because a few thousand of my imp and hill giant kills happened to be on an F2P server?
---
Well it sounds like you made more than one account and just made the character look the same on them all because the only way your skills get reset to 1(not 0 btw) is if you were caught cheating and jagex reset the skills you botted. Also not sure if osrs does this but rs3 in f2p worlds your members skills show level 1-5 even if you leveled them in,members back then
---
Good to know others think this way when doing polls.
---
Ranged in f2p is fine. they are tinkering with the f2p spellbook though.
---
No i meant the guys hyping him up, im from denmark myself so i know what a scandinavian accent sounds like
---
So the one little poll that’s important for integrity and pushing the future of OSRS is just 1 of hundreds of others that do the same thing voted by the ones who just want content whether it’s good or not, but won’t vote for that 1.
---
Art of the deal
---
Gonna be such a let down when it is added to the game, no way in hell devs would put in all that time to just scrap it, easy to say it passed the poll.
---
Revs
---
I get that tech/security isn't your thing so bear with me.
---
&gt; People stealing runescape accounts from fake private servers for ages 
---
Not via keyloggers/malware. People getting hacked by playing on private servers usually get hacked because they use their official RS username/password to register with the private server. A lot of time it's not even the server owners hacking them, it's just that private servers tend to have pretty poor security standards.
---
If this is a **fake** private server, as you're now saying, then the server does not exist. The entire thing is a ruse to trick people into installing malware. Runescape accounts are the last of people's worries at this point as the entire phone is now compromised. That being said, even malware on rooted phones is still pretty limited in what it's able to do. This has nothing to do with a Runescape private server and 100% to do with running untrusted code on your device.
---
If this is a **real** (but still malicious) private server, then all they're probably doing is what I mentioned above. They go through the list of players on the private server and just try entering their credentials in to the official website.
---
dsword is better than dlong, and you might want to put granite hammer just before that
---
I am part of the problem with this country because I voted for someone I believe in? How about the 60% of the population that doesnt even bother to vote?
---
Where the fuck is that logic
---
At first I was really upset the community was so split and arguing, but at this point I’m just laughing at all the memes.
---
It does set a precedent to keep adding new skills, which some of us DONT WANT
---
I'm not concerned about being scammed, I'm just really curious what their motive is.
---
a
---
And you really think adding a total req will remove more bots than players?
---
Not meant to be an argument, take a chill pill, and Sorry to break it to you a few thousand is a drop in the bucket. So get over it and get to killing.
---
Personally I didn’t like raising past lvl 126 and getting the charms on every drop. Super “no change is good change.”
---
but what will he vote on them :^)
---
I have heard continuous rumors that devs are going to stop developing new skills if this one doesn’t pass. I really want new skills so I’m voting yes for that alone.
---
Is there a way to get the dps calculator to check cannon accuracy?
---
I know I didnt make another account with the same email / name, it cant be done, and I didnt do any botting, all done on mobile.. 
---
Also, a few other member skills like thieving are at like 3 or 4, so i have some progress, but not nearly what i had. Although I did get emails saying the account was compromised, so i put an authenticator and changed all my passwords.. do you think they botted on my account and Jagex reset a bunch of it?!
---
If you use a private server like this you deserve it tbh
---
There's no way gary would have gotten enough electoral votes to win if he got any and in that case Congress would have probably voted trump in anyway.
---
I skipped the actual question on warding and then voted yes or no for all the possible perks/add-ons that would come with the skill. I don’t care whether it gets added or not. But if it does get added, then I’ll say what I’d want it to come along with.
---
Efficiency scape or die... if you can’t do this skill in 30hours or less your a cheap noob and should quit the game.
---
holy fuck i had to come back and look at these
---
After no success with my previous setup, I decided to get 75 ranged and use a blowpipe.
---
Holy cringe.
---
Add another green pixel and I’ll do it.
---
I did ds2 yesterday and I have 10 kc with two heads xd
---
I have 3 99s and my total level is less then 1250. I feel like it should be based on xp
---
Do DS2 if you haven't, the ava's upgrade is real nice
---
There's ourania, then simple altars. 
---
You're just wrong, crybaby.
---
Nope, the game is broken it seems
---
i thought people did them for xp not profit
---
Gotta say his name three times to summon him. Or sacrifice two hcim.
---
What I would give for a girlfriend who doesn’t get pissed when I play lol
---
&gt;Although I did get emails saying the account was compromised
---
Those emails are fake. They are the phishing emails.
---
anyways, post a screenshot of your account, stats don't get reset, you are making a mistake somewhere
---
Well isn't the whole purpose of the wilderness to fight other players/risk?  The whole 'not fighting in the wilderness' thing seems to line up pretty well with the word 'integrity'.

Is this the barcrawl miniquest?

Uh. Dont hang me up on it. It might be yeah.

How does anyone not know this method at this point?

he just said its 4m per hour lol

what a waste of effort

I hope not.  That quest line sucks
---
Most redditors on the contrary pay more attention to collapsed comments because human beings are drama whores.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, you mean like my top comment in this chain? Maybe that's another reason no voters are mocked - you bitch about how downvotes are censoring you but do the same exact shit when you can.
---
That's the thing - you're not bitching that it's happening, you're bitching that it's happening to you.
---
Omg 3m, don't spend it all at one place
---
Wrong thread, JMods don't read this one. Try the Q&amp;A thread posted weekly on Mondays/Tuesdays depending on your timezone.
---
Holy tl;dr
---
I literally would've quit runescape if it weren't the skill ceiling prayer flicking presents
---
It's *barely* an exploit to begin with because the effort put into doing it really only opens the doors for bringing less food on slayer trips, doing quest bosses, doing PvM without matching the required level but having insane skill, and PvP. It's not CRAZY useful for how much effort you need to put in. If it were totally broken no one would ever buy ppots, but hey it's still valued pretty damn high.
---
Not sure where you're pulling this "weren't supposed to get 99s" from, even Runite Smithing has 90+ requirements and that's as OG as it gets. 85+ represents the end-game for every skill. You weren't supposed to get 200m exp.
---
70 is "pretty high" but it isn't an impossibility. If you're entering the med-game with maybe only a few non combat stats 60+ then I guess it looks daunting. Tough shit there's a whole bunch of content between you and the quest that has that requirement. 70 is where as a new player you begin so see a bit more grind between the levels. That's just how levelling is designed.
---
As a counterpoint to all the doom and gloom being spread around. What if Warding ends up being unexpectedly fun to train? What if Warding ends up having the best questline in the game? What if Warding ends up being the most useful skill to level up for your account. What if Warding revamps PvM so you don't get the same old setups when bossing.
---
I think Warding has more potential than pretty much every other skill.
---
His real names Clarence, and his parents have a real good marriage
---
Except for warding to be relevant it needs to be tied to other skills and quest req
---
Spongebob has the most and most versatile meme formats
---
Bots aren’t the problem. it’s the shitty bank standers that sit around memeing a skill that could be good for the game.
---
I voted no because I don't agree with Warding being a fun skill
---
Preach it!
---
If you're doing slayer, just train defence by bursting slayer tasks, and do 85 str first, then atk. Otherwise do str -&gt; atk -&gt; def
---
No you didnt you r-word

Imagine being in a relationship where you can't do the things you want to do because your partner doesn't want you to.
---
Also ya. Skills dont reset and jagex doesnt reset them anymore. They just outright ban accounts now. Dont trust emails and never click links. Go to the website your self

None like rs3’s home tele system

I remembered hearing about A Friend but never knew what their deal was.

Also, I just realised what the title meant. I literally thought it meant some friend of OP/OSRS community and not A Friend.
---
Should be absolutely fine. If you're really worried you can add some purple sweets maybe like 50-100 to eat up between waves.
---
Make sure to checkout the wave prediction spreadsheet and get a 'good' Jad spawn spot.
---
What's in the BP tho, addy?
---
Lol bro there were both max cash stack spawns and free twisted bows, if you think the economy isn’t already fucked you are naive or ignorant
---
No shit. But if I want to play for an hour I don't have to ask my wife first. Just like she doesn't have to ask me if she can watch a movie on netflix. We just do as we please unless we have plans already
---
I would recommend finding something you enjoy and do that for awhile.  One of the nice things about OSRS is that most things you train are useful.  You need to level skills for quest requirements, and lots of them are good moneymakers.  Most of all, have fun!
---
It's a bad skill. Its just a bankstanding skill. At least construction has you build and design your house. Not everything needs to be fletching.
---
I do that already?
---
Ive had people in their first fight staff bash me more than actually barraging me
---
"ranged only" option is when you use a tbow for the whole fight.
---
Now can we get ja rules thoughts on warding?
---
It's been a while since I've played and when I did all I was doing was grinding. Is this a hard clue scroll or some sort of minigame?
---
Oof. I confused you with Verf. My bad ..
---
That i dont have.. so magic only i guess
---
Never played either
---
Now i wanna see you do 42 inferno’s at the same time
---
So I want to get a stylus for playing on my iphone as ive been training a lot of agility and construction lately on my phone and I cant take using my fingers for that anymore.
---
Can anyone recommend a good stylus for iphone that would work well with osrs as well?
---
Make sure your barrows pieces are fully repaired and you've got enough darts and scales in your bp. Then you'll be good :)
---
Cause it's a pita to get and it degrades
---
I thought he was guessing that she'd have lumpy nipples for some reason, what you said seems to make more sense though.
---
The entire point of bosses being hard is that they have a learning curve, accompanied by using supplies. Trust me, your first tob kc is about 20 times more satisfying when it's in the real game without max everything
---
Thin ice
---
So get void, it takes awhile but is well worth
---
Just busting your balls man. Lol
---
Eh, it depends. I used to get completely trashed by my friends in halo 3 back in the day. It made me learn good map awareness, movement, and strafing so that I wouldn't die constantly. I very rarely killed them, but I easily learned what could be done to kill. I used those techniques to get better very quickly.
---
If you're dying with no chance, reflect on *why* you died (not just "they were way better") and learn from it.
---
I've seen quite a few maxed players say they have quit due to not feeling like they have anything to do and warding seems well thought out enough for them to want to come back.
---
You have the same chance of winning that they do
---
All foam my friend. Scouts honor&lt;3
---
I'm taking the 5 bucks to the sand casino
---
Lmao imagine unironically believing this. Imagine thinking a skill for crafting mage gear is going to ruin the game.
---
Idk what skill gives you the idea that they will implement a “fun” skill. Describe what you think would be a fun but useful skill. One that doesn’t sound like it’d be a mini game like sailing
---
No problem friend have a good weekend!
---
Which god d'hide set looks the best ?
---
Yes. Basically max mage + Ely (Ely is for damage reduction chance) and Sang for passive heals. Basically mage the cunt, SGS spec on small Kalphite after kill, and stay as long as you can. Stand in melee distance, pray range or mage (doesn’t matter). Good way to get long trips vs melee/range. If you don’t have an Ely, Arcane &gt; Mage book &gt; whatever else.
---
yes, having dozens of comments every day throwing a hissy fit about anti-warding people is *absolutely* more "get a life" material than one comment complaining about upvote ratio, sorry if you seriously don't see that, but I'm sure anyone else would
---
????? don't think I've ever deleted comments in an argument against you or argued against you at all, maybe you're thinking of someone else? I mean, I guess you're bound to get people confused when you've argued with so many people recently lol
---
I've made my argument a dozen times, check my post history is you really care. But this sub is just circle jerking "warding gud" posts right now so sometimes it's just not worth typing everything out again.
---
The fucking entitlement. If you don't play the game, why do you think you deserve to decide its future? Fuck off.
---
Checkmate atheists.
---
Whats barrows?
---
So someone with base 75's and 1725 total can't vote? Yeah that makes sense. 
---
I don't believe votingg should have any restriction beyond membership. Hell even f2pers should be allowed to vote on something that affects f2p.
---
Marry her.
---
That makes sense
---
&gt;jad is by no means easy
---
Debatable. Jad is 100% nerves, next to no skill required. My first fire cape took me 6 attempts, I've never taken a Kad hit after that excep on triple jads and zuk. I imagine 99% of the people have similar experiences.
---
Also side note, spending 3 mil to learn hydra is completely negligible. Even with just a 10m setup you make that back in an hour.
---
Nah i just basically afked everything till this point and now im ready to quest and grab some gear and i just really know nothing about the game
---
This is a combination of memes if Im not mistaken.  it all started with the suggestion of a fire making guild. The idea was to just make a long bridge with 28 tiles between banking spots. So some dude made that stupid bridge between Zeah and the Mainland.
---
Then a second meme was that people wanted to either move the GE around to other places of the map. Or move other features to the location og GE, like the idea of the Falador party room next to the GE. 
---
And Well people started placing stupid shit out on the bridge between Zeah and the Mainland, you see the result yourself.
---
You have a pretty skewed perception of things if you think people only vote for someone like Bernie Sander or Andrew Yang  (or any other candidate that is never taken seriously because of the main stream media and the DNC that tries to fix elections for the person they have their money behind) because they want to be "cool". Some people actually hope for a better future for this country instead of the same stagnant and corrupt country we have right now. I wouldn't doubt that's why a lot of folks actually voted for that bigot Trump. People are fed up on both sides and just want to shit in the well at this point.
---
For some reason I can't bring my cannon into LMS so I can get free afk wins? Also I lose items when I die someone help please :c
---
It needs 70 def sadly im 60
---
You're a dickhead and part of the reason why this community is perceived as toxic. I can only hope there's dickheads who vote yes on 10 alts to balance it out and preserve the point of the polls.
---
Eat a dick you sad virgin.
---
At minimum this skill will help stabilize the game economy due to dissolving.
---
Oh shit you’re right,
---
My man these people think vorkath has complicated mechanics. Just ignore it.
---
armadyl.
---
I still do that
---
Add me in game - "ThisMuchDad"

1500 yes, 1250 no.

I was walking back from coffee shop AYYY I was walking back from coffee shop AYYY
---
This is the runescape version of corporate donations to politicians
---
But f2p votes can be easyily manipulated due to account making being easy
---
It's an open world, there's no real direction. You could decide to get 99 in mining and never touch your other skills or focus on all the quests littered throughout the game. You could level up your combat and kill bosses. The fun of it is just setting your own goals and working toward them. 
---
Recommendation wise I would say start out by doing all the f2p quests in the game. They are a good introduction to different skills and aspects of the game.
---
Don't shame, explain.
---
An easy minigame with profit. Mostly you'll be using magic.
---
Yes ironman is actually really fun and rewarding, especially the early levels. It also teaches you a lot about the game.
---
You'd still be part of the problem. The issue isn't with yes or no, it's that you're defeating the whole purpose of the system because you think your opinion is worth more than everyone else's. That's selfish and arrogant at the very least, and genuinely harmful to the game at the worst.
---
God those were the good old days lol. I'd walk into 7/11 with 8$ and some change for tax and boom was out of there
---
yea they’re wonderful tank gear but the full set effect is what im talking about specifically.
---
I was at the poll booth near the GE and a P Mod named Anatamize told everyone to not just vote no, and to read the blog. I messaged him and asked him why he supports it and he repeated the basic warding arguments and told me to read the blog, and when I argued back he just said "Did you even read what I said" and  blocked me.
---
Level 80-90 courses are more easier than others imo
---
10,iq move
---
Now that I read that, I think it might have something to do with what you said.
---
I just picked one up off the ground.
---
Look up barrows minigame on the wiki. It's where all the tier 70 armor like Dharoks/karils/ahrims etc comes from
---
Lmao... being downvoted for not insuring. Fuck you idiots.
---
Sraracha on sriracha (it's the pet)
---
That’s fine and all guy. I’m just saying, if we in the general election and you still giving your vote to irrelevant candidates with not even 2% then you’re only giving the bigots more of a chance cause you’re “too cool” for the mainstream.
---
Exactly the gear I’d expect of someone who wants this skill in game
---
Cut wood at draynor, or fish at barb village id say!
---
that's the weed numeber!
---
Make it a main and just play LMS.
---
? Construction is 300k+ XP per hour and fishing is click once every fifteen minutes
---
Diamond dragon. I figured that's what was used for Zuk since you can't really bring a switch. Ruby dragon bolts are 5.5 DPS when Zuk is at max health and goes down to 3.3 by the end
---
I absolutely adore this art style.
---
That doubling gold is *perfect*.
---
monkfish
---
Yeah but you have to come up with an argument as to why you're against warding if you're not against all the other bankstanding skills like herblore, crafting, smithing and fletching. You also have to argue why bankstanding skills are worse than other repetetive skills like WC, mining and runecrafting.
---
What arguments are there other than "it feels different" and then why does it feel different and why is different bad? Why is it bad if it isn't from the base game that just happens to be the closest backup from before eoc?
---
If you're simple against all of the skills then it could easily be solved by making an ironman, turning bankstanding skills into skills that requires you to actively play thw game to gather the resources in the first place.
---
I want it in the game, skill or not. It'd be much better suited as additions to other skills though
---
D
---
No, I don't support the fundamental concept of democracy. And you shouldn't either, at least not without taking at least a few minutes to ponder why it is that you believe so strongly that it's as fair and perfect as you are portraying it to be.
---
What is the purpose of the polls? Can we agree that it is to help Jagex bring updates into the game that bring the most value to the player base? If you will also agree that different players do not all value the outcome of any given poll question the same then it follows that giving every vote the same weight will not perfectly produce an outcome that brings the most value to the most players. 5 people vote, two will be drastically affected and vote yes, three will be minimally affected and vote no. What would be the preferable solution, the poll passing or not passing?
---
How is it not?  It's observing how Johnson wasn't an irrelevant candidate.  For voters like myself in a state that has a clear party favorite, he wasn't meant to win, he's meant to draw in enough voters to legitimize his party.  Which he almost did, but unfortunately flurb'd up on the Syrian interview.
---
I see the swamp man hiding
---
I remember my first time back in the day full rune and d long with lobsters didn't get very far lol
---
All I did was log in with the same credentials on this new private server and next thing I know my main got hacked. Fix your game Jamflex this is unacceptable!!! 
---
/s
---
Unfortunately not yet. 4th times a charm tho.
---
Show us on the doll where Runelite touched you..
---
I dont want future content to require levelling yet another skill. I already had to level miserable things like agility/rc and boring bankstand skills (like what warding will be) so that i can complete quests and diaries. 
---
If i have the option to vote to minimize future requirements and future boring grinds gating me from content i actually want to participate in, i will.
---
🚨 u/jagex_wolf abort warding I repeat abort warding. Reports coming in that u/P33pp0 voted no... This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. 🚨
---
How many darts did it take
---
Zamorak all the wat
---
Just for you mr truck.
---
Finally, an authoritative stance.
---
There isn’t a defensive milestone I can hit that wont put me behind with other stats?
---
Yeah I mean darts lol
---
Not when you’re demanding yourself be allowed to the front of the line.
---
It will come my bwana.

It was -22 points when I first saw it a couple days ago. Reddit is fickle.

If you want to mid level hybrid PK then make a new account
---
nice
---
if you think about it, all normal accounts are basically playing group ironman mode with each other
---
Sure. IGN?
---
:) i like to think I'm probably like 87 or 88 drinking. Did most  of my training in college
---
Thinking about trying some GWD for the first time soon. Do the preliminary kills you need to access the various general rooms reset on world hop?
---
I only play OSRS in Runelite and I had no clue that's what those arrows were for FML
---
I want to hybrid whenever I can. I’m not saying mid level or anything, from these stats moving forward what is the optimal stats to begin hybriding that wont fuck me over. At this point maxing combat stats with like 45 defense? Or what
---
Yes we know it will be a buyable and expensive there are a bunch of buyables like crafting, pray, herb, con, that have slower methods that are cheaper yet many people still cant even afford those are my point. 
---
I read the the blog and I know the stats and effects of the armors which is exactly why im saying they arent of much use considering mystics is better than over half of the proposed ones and ahrims is better than pretty much everyone of them, not to mention ancest.
---
Im saying in terms of development time, if a skill that leaves much to be desired is released with not much interest in training it, that time is better spent somewhere else.
---
Wait really, there's more than one ge?
---
No it's not, you motherfuckers just want it to be boring. Try PvP.
---
Nice
---
I just got my second claw tonight:)
---
And yeah, if you want to get political, I actually do believe that "voting with your wallet" as it is said tends to produce better outcomes than one person one vote at no cost. No, it isn't perfect, because, like you mentioned, not everyone values money the same (I'm sure I would value $100 more than Bill Gates). In the current case, I actually think that my vote should matter less than the ballet stuffers. I play Runescape when I have some free time and nothing better to do on a single account that I occasional subscribe on but I doubt I care about it nearly as much as the daily players with multiple subscribed accounts, ergo it would make sense that I have less of a say in the game's future than they do.
---
And vast knowledge of the game.
---
What were your stats?
---
Those are the rewards, yes. The idea is to provide a change of scenery and monster types. That's why a lot of people really like the skill.
---
Why would you vote yes to a skill while voting no to whats added?  I like warding i'm just saying it isn't fleshed out or interesting.
---
He couldn't escape the oompa loompa.
---
I just didn't vote. Not even surprised Trump won though. If I had to put money on it he's going to win 2020 too.
---
“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mr. Mueller said
---
God I hope not.
---
no drops, its just for fun
---
Awesome, im gonna redeem a bond and go farm gold in it
---
So are you saying everything besides PVP is boring? Because that would then make the majority of the game boring
---
Because they should balance bosses dropping skilling items instead of going hey here's a way to get double gathering resource drops.
---
Nope
---
Why do people not mine the same vein as me on second level of MLM? 2 people can't deplete the vein before the timer.

It’s not a bug, nor is it outdated. Slagilith has a special mechanic where he only takes full damage from a pickaxe, but gives the exp of the intended attack before reduction
---
S
---
I hope they do too, but let's be real it's not going to pass. I'll be making sure I vote no on every account I can. It's a shitty idea, and has been from the start. I hope you whiny fucks get some pussy once in a while.

Sailing has so much potential. I would love it if sailing gave us procedurally generated islands similar to dungeoneering.

 You would start out on the surface of the island with lots of exotic animals, herbs, trees, minerals, and dangerous wild animals. You use almost every skill to make armour, weapons, potions, and food while avoiding and later on fighting the dangerous animals. Once you think you have enough, you go underground which could be a cave full of beasts or an ancient temple. You must solve puzzles and fight enemies before reaching a treasure room guarded by a boss.
---
If you win, you can give the treasure to various factions and people around the world in exchange for different rewards. Giving it to pirates has a chance to reward you with blueprints for ship upgrades, you can give it to the sailing guild in order to hire a better crew for your ship, or donate it to the Varrock Museum in exchange for valuables or unique items.
---
But i liked the blast mine :(
---
What's the exp/hr and gp/hr for this amazing method.
---
It would be pretty annoying to know that someone, out there on RS of all places, thinks that macroing sentences about Jews being bad, let alone any group of people, for seemingly no reason, and does it for over a month.  
---
Like it's so stupid. There are literal services and websites made so you can pit your brain and your facts against like-minded or rational thinkers. But he chooses osrs.   
---
If I went into a coffee shop and started preaching about Jesus or a marketing strategy, something completely obscure and irrelevant to the present situation, people would be taken out of the atmosphere and put into an odd situation that really, shouldn't be occuring.  
---
I don't want to think about religion. I want to think about finishing that quest/task and getting mad gp gains.
---
*upvote for autistic awareness*
---
I'm genuinely curious here, but what makes this skill any different than the other production skills in the game? Do you not like those either or is there maybe something different about this one that I'm missing?
---
How does that work? (Quite new to the game and haven’t worked out fletching just yet).
---
Like Sailing or Artisan, both failed polls. Let this fail too, and the next, and the one after that because no matter what they bring up there will be whining. Skill suggestions are going to become more and more lackluster and everyone will just start to point back at previous suggestions how they failed but should have passed and so on.
---
This skill has been revised by listening to the community's feedback 3 times, it's as good as it gets at this point in time. If you wanted them overpowered robes and battlewards you should have defended them better when it was brought up, or maybe you'll get them when the skill has matured, who knows? 
---
If you want my opinion, a new skill can't be "good" or "bad", as long as it serves the purpose that it has. Firemaking has been in the game since release, we all know it's broken and useless, but it has it's place where it belongs. You still see people burn rows of fire everywhere. Wouldn't you get it to 99 too at some point? Warding makes robes. It has a clear purpose.
---
So all the content gets put in other places where it belongs and not just a weird advertisement ploy for Jagex?
---
Sounds good to me.
---
two rune plateskirts... this changes everything
---
They are balancing boss drops, but even if they do Gathering skills are not and have never been good money. Even if you remove all Logs from PvM, Woodcutting will still be terrible profit compared to other skills. The Rings weren't just double resources; you had a rare c chance to get an untradeable item while skilling that you could turn into a ring for a chance (dependent on what you are harvesting) for an additional item with no exp. That is a pretty reasonable way to give skilling profit a small boost. But if you reject even that, then I don't know how you expect the existing gathering methods to ever be worthwhile.
---
Awwww. It's a cute noob.
---
Kill the boy
---
Not at all, well sort of! 
---
You see. I made this in: Paint.net with the help of this tutorial here: https://www.reddit.com/r/notncartography/comments/56j5y9/how_to_make_overworld_maps/
---
Hope that solves your answer!
---
Woo pig
---
That doesn't change the fact that if I vote yes now, and they change it for the worse, they can still add it to the game because the poll passed.
---
Woah we got a badass here. You softer than cottonelle homie.
---
Oh damn totally forgot that
---

That’s not framed lmao
---
woodcutting is just tree slayer
---
having only 94 mage would make it pretty difficult as ur mage can get reduced by the bats, if u had an imbued heart maybe thatd be ok but id reccommend especially if ur gunna do it with arma cbow get 96-99 mage gl brother
---
c ya in 6 months
---
Well fletching is the skill related to creating ranged equipment, in this case bows. Only issue is the decent profit per action is unlocked at 55 fletching.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fletching#Bows_2
---
Exactly, that's the whole point of warding. But stuff like being able to imbue rings feel like it fits RC better than this new skill.
---
What do you mean its not Framed its literally his verified twitch
---
Not sure if you're being serious or making one of those posts where the joke is that you pretend to be a huge noob lol
---
Yeah in Varrock, Mehpanos and Priff which are respectively the low level, mid level and high level hubs. It makes sense.
---
I only catch shrimp! No one can tell me what to catch when I train MY favorite skill!

Ooohh, I gotcha. That's a relief

We can keep going back and forth throwing insults but it won' t prove anything unless you and I meet face you face in real life and throw hands. Unless that happens the only thing I can do is claim that im not soft and that you are in fact soft
---
Showing interests in your hobbies is an important part of any relationship, this is nice. 
---
The other day I spent time explaining to my gf about the Venezuelan economy and how they make money on Runescape and how it affects the rs economy etc. I'm not sure if she actually cared but it was nice regardless
---
Same haha. Like where are we sailing? Just back and forth, is it not just a charter ship?
---
Damn they should make Runelite mobile if their skilled enough for rsps on mobile.
---
Thanks for the info, I have a question tho. Won't I be able to kill the nibs before I get attacked by bats? This isn't a big problem cuz mage is really fast xp and 96-99 would only take few days.
---
Most definitely. When I say it kills the fun, that’s just based on how Ive experienced the game mode which was a lot of trial and error and discovery that I really enjoyed. But some might just find that frustrating and I totally get that. All about what you’re looking for.
---
The same reason I don't want to do the other production skills. It's not something I really want to do. It sounds like inventions little brother from RS3. Just because it's like the other production skills, doesn't mean I wanna do it ya know?
---
He's a troll or downright retarded.
---
She wasn't good enough for you mate.
---
ChEsTbRaH
---
The code is what it is, if the devs cared that much about this happening they'd've examined edge cases more carefully
---
This would obsolete a lot of medium tier equipment as people would just rent the top tier equipment and use it to farm their own copies of the equipment that they're renting, or do something more profitable.
---
If I wanted my own abyssal whip, instead of participating in the economy and gearing up as much as I could, I'd just rent a whip each day because the odds me me getting my own whip in the next 10 days is fairly probably.
---
Not to mention how wrong the GE price is on a lot of high end gear.
---
Do strength first attack second and defence third
---
That's proof the poll was failing. It's clear how desperately they want warding to pass.
---
ok whats the acceptable and soy approved way for leddit to respond to someone writing bullshit meme comments to you?
---
Thank you gentlekindsir for telling me to uninstall life. Hahah witty joke and comment you almost r/whoosh me hahaha, I love superhero movies haha
---
Do you think based on your income you should get more votes in the election?
---
There is 0% chance this would be abused where people would throw. 0% chance
---
yes, but it only works if both are the same. Introducing a skill that won't change power balances much is not nearly the same as introducing a near weapon that would outclass ever other item in the game.
---
woah hes alive
---
so str 30&gt;70, then att 30&gt;70, and defence 30&gt;70?
---
Yeah and then after that got posted on reddit Jagex changed my name for me and locked it for a year lol
---
Okay, that’s epic.
---
Me?

My gf when any game I play comes between me paying attention to her 😂

Can confirm that this is a great CC. Have not officially joined yet because my introverted self likes to play alone so I tend to leave and be cc-less. But just wanted to say thank you for being such a welcoming clan when I have popped in. I really appreciate your organization and guides you have put together in discord.  Also Christian thank you for being patient and teaching noobs like me how to raid.
---
Was that to me?
---
a skip vote is neither for nor against the question
---
This old but you're full of shit. You didn't make 3m in an hour with a BP ever without unique. End of. You bank after every kill also shows you're a fucking nub cos you cant get atleast 2 with BP in which case you would be more believable but still full of shit.
---
Tldr: This guy is exaggerating alot and BP at vork sucks. Just go Zul and learn to boss abit till you can afford DHCB for max profit at vork.
---
No the other dude lol

The sub's been getting some godly effort posts recently

Was actually pretty amusing, in a random/copypasta sort of way.

---
OP you don't need to lie to us, we're all friends here.
---
You texted yourself
---
you're not gonna be hybridding until at least 94 mage anyway. 70 def is the best def for hybridding, but you'll then need 90+ range and str. or just get maxed combat since most hybrid fights are in deep wild
---
Q
---
Too true, too true.
---
Suspicious with that sword. Hmmm
---
It's possible that they would but maybe it would raise revenue. I have never paid for two members accounts because of the price. But if I could add an alt for 6 dollars or so, I might. Or if I could pay 20 dollars and get unlimited alts.
---
This is like the weirdest war ever lol
---
LITERALLY!
---
Interesting.
---
I remember doing it for a bit in pre eoc, but the exp rates were horid.
---
Also better xp to mine your own vein: the runelite idle notifier goes off as soon as it's finished instead of like 10 seconds later. That's why I always went to empty worlds at least.
---
Sure, but you said that a skip implies that you don't care. If they aren't interested in doing it then it implies that they don't care about it. No, on the other hand, implies there is something wrong with it, not that you're simply uninterested
---
Fucking lol
---
I think you are confused the straw poll posted like a day ago with 14k votes does not need anything
---
Finally found it, but it’s old and not up to date [(two years maybe)](https://imgur.com/a/OjvAimY)
---
The starting supplies are worth way more early game.
---
Sure, the rewards are better with high stats, but they don't matter anywhere near as much.

It depends on what you're fighting.

Honestly, I think it depends on the thread. There are threads where people have reasonable explanations in comments for voting no that get downvoted, and then there are threads where people have reasonable explanations in comments for voting no that get upvoted.
---
It’s Reddit. Post for karma purposes or get downvoted and disappear.
---
I am at 76 mage and I don't notice much of a difference in dps personally. So I still use Ibans because of the cost.
---
What the hell did you think the comment was saying

My bwana&lt;3

Like I said, I know next to nothing about the inferno. I was just giving stats

Wait isn't zanik a she?

Dog was judging you for going outside 🤦‍♂️

You'd be far better off getting seeds from Farmers, and doing wintertodt with higher levels.

I think it just would be better off as an extension to existing skills rather than its own skill.

No I'm saying he likely doesn't care about OSRS anymore

Lmao. I had just let him out like 5 minutes before and he was pawing at the door to come back in

They think it's infringing on men's rights if a girl doesn't let you play 10 hours a day
---
Wait, why is the previous reply +25 and this one -18? Same poster, arguing the same point.

Most irons I know don't follow a guide. They either play how they want or loosely use a guide as a general guideline -- instead of following it to a T.

Well I've been grinding slayer for awhile so it's always something different

Some of your speculation is misinformed, the imbues to warding is being polled still

Also the use of dev time is never really a good argument. Dev times will always go-to something so

This is only if you retrade them after using gp. If you buy a bond with irl money and sell it there is no tax iirc.

It's definitely completely illogical, stupid reasoning, yeah.

first of all , these arent my acounts , there are from my friend, second
---
 it would be \`unfair, i know that there are only 36 votes, but still unfair
---
There's still a few quests but not as much as a normal pure build. Since you're not going for high lvls.

I absolutely can and will complain about being extorted and having the money to fund drone strikes, drug wars, etc.

I never asked for any of these morons to rule over me and I do not consent to the system.

Saaaame. I called it tho, I said Hardy by 1st round knockout. I didn't specify TKO tho. Was hoping I'd be wrong but....
---
Anyway how about the big ticket?! jheeeez man UFC is packed with 1st round knockouts these last few events :O
---
&gt;it's far more worth doing at high levels, even on a UIM. Literally no downside.
---
Disagree. The starting rewards at WT are great compared to your alternatives.
---
At late-game iron, the rewards may be better, but they mean nothing. Your alternatives are all way better.
---
Except crafting and magic are completely fine... and the fact that having runecrafting be the name of a skill then focus almost entirely on making armor and dissolving? I mean if you wanna rename runecrafting to magic craft or maybe warding.... it might make sense. Mainly replying to the part about you wanting to paste everything into other skills. I personally think this is the weakest of the arguments cause it means you like the content but just hate the idea of a new skill because... what?
---
I'll keep upvoting these posts until Jagex finally does it.
---
LOL what are the chances of that
---
duel arena?
---
you realize that these private server owners come from a reputable community that revolves around rsps development (mostly for fun not for profit) and wouldn't risk their 2-year + endeavor on taking rsgp from kids when they can make thousands by hosting their own server for profit.
---
Yeah, impressive by Walt Harris, Oleinik’s an old, old man, but still very dangerous as a grappler
---
I really like these. They feel almost cozy

Yeah its fine.  It is a bit slower, but overall mostly the same and once you have the mechanics down you can do it with an arma xbow

when will the poll results come out, cant check rn so ill ask here
---
Not wrong though
---
Ur blessed fam, eskettit
---
Nor will a majority of the players voting yes
---
I can not think of any company in any scenario that would start development on a project that hasn't even been approved and has a significant chance of getting scrapped. If it was for approval internally it would make sense, but when you are relying on the community to approve it as opposed to the rest of your team, it would be flat out moronic to even start and there is no way doing that would ever be approved. If them developing first is what it takes to get you to vote for it, don't hold your breath because you are never going to be satisfied. You might as well just admit you are against them adding a new skill.
---
But before that you implied that you didn't dislike the idea of a new skill or warding in general, you just didn't like that it wasn't fleshed out. That is why I said you should have voted yes. If you are against warding, vote no. But voting no because it isn't fleshed out enough is, once again, completely moronic and shows a complete lack of understanding of how both game development and the polling system works. Unless you just hate warding and nothing will ever change your mind on that, you are just voting against your own interests for no reason other than thinking you are entitled to jmods wasting their time developing a new skill for the game that probably won't pass a poll. Voting no until they develop a skill before even polling it is peak entitlement. 
---
After watching how people reacted to warding and how entitled they are, this point I would rather put faith in the team getting it right than this community. But, luckily, we have a polling system so I don't have to put faith in either one because they rely on each other to get things added to the game, something you seem to fail to understand since you seem to think as soon as it passes everything is set in stone and the skill will be exactly how it is right now.

He doesn't go to any events because he's 5"5' and everyone teases him

Having to patch in all kinds of exceptions on items, times, values, etc to make it almost reasonable should kind of be a red flag in the first place

when i say worth it i mean for the normal player. anything is worth it for a bot to do as they dont have to do anything or pay attention to it until its done running
---
That is a difficult question. You can use 15 of the 23 skills, and can still reach the max level of 99 in each of them, that being said the world is significantly smaller and there are many many more training options, as well as gear in P2P.
---
I would encourage you to start up and play, the game is going strong and will continue doing so - even with how chaotic it may seem right now on the subreddit.
---
If you do play but aren't such if the game is for you, I recommend trying to get all F2P skills (aside from runecrafting) to at least level 50 before starting members. It will test you to see if you are up for the grind that RuneScape can be.
---
Awesome! Thank you for the reply, answered my question completely
---
Zeah has gotten so much better with the inclusion of Kebos as well as rework of Hosidius. I would love to see Favor removed and maybe a little more use out of Shayzien/Piscarilius but overall pretty good.
---
Just do yourself a favour and spend 3.99 on a bond for 2 weeks
---
I remember when I thought 200k was a lot back then. lol
---
There's a lot of bots on f2p, I wouldn't say its a fair assessment of the game. Most resource spots are flooded with bots and players trying to compete with the bots. 
---
You can get **much** more out of the game in p2p.

ahahahahaha

Speaking of bots, the other day on my iron I found a world that was some sort of bot communication base. There were a couple accs saying worlds out loud that had lucky/ninja/d imps that spawned. I kept an alt there and was able to beat the bots to most of them for a solid 20 mins, got around 10 d imps. Then they changed worlds and I couldn't find them again. 
---
Weird experience.

I remember people using this argument for the Grand Exchange. It's just silly.

Is that even a real expression...? But maybe you're right, I do play ironman mode.

He's the poster above. /u/Dedicat3d
---
Free Parking, if used to collect money, if you play the game that way, only extends the length of the game and doesn't actually help win... The real game involves auctioning and trading properties between players, it's a communication game and involves fair exchange between players.
---
I got discouraged because I had graceful cape and gloves and lost both doing a clue in high wildy as a noob (thought it didn't get lost and had no idea 20+ was different) so I basically had to start over getting it. I'll try getting back into it now that I'm 70 (had to grind that for SotE)

well, they are a slayer task after all

Oooo I saw this the other day about Thorin Oakenshield still funny
---
Even runecrafting
---
Competing scam bots?
---
Spectre task. Slayer helm (I) + torture or nose peg+salve(is). Will be praying in prolly amour. Just thought about this
---
What does that mean
---
thats not true.
---
This is a game where people buy and quit, and that make items evaluate more, so tbow for example worth 100m.
---
If lend system goes on, tbow will worth way less because people that once quit the game will come back just to lend to someone
---
Time to max
---
&gt;The skill itself was just runecrafting 
---
It's almost like every skill is just a series of clicks
---
i voted yes for warding and the warding guild but skipped all the other questions
---
&gt;:^(
---
It’s a straw man bc you have generalized an entire side of an argument into one stupid meme as if every single one of them is a purist with stupid, illegitimate opinions on the game. I support warding btw but this is ridiculous. They have a right to an opinion.
---
The biggest loss from my perspective is not in content but efficiency. You will spend much more time getting around in F2P, many of the most efficient methods of gaining experience or currency won't be available to you. That being said, there are a multitude of other benefits to being a member, chiefly the massive reduction in bots. Membership gives you a lot more options.
---
The ideal strategy IMO is to try out the f2p skills and do most of the quests with a grain of salt, knowing there is more to the game that the taste they give you. If you don't at all enjoy F2P then you likely won't enjoy members.
---
Nice.
---
I'm lucky. My wife and I take turns picking shows to binge watch after the kids go to bed. This is usually when I get a couple hours of gaming in. It works great. I play Runescape, she looks at pinterest and designs stuff for her Cricut.

---
Right?! And if anything, maxed players are the people this new content should appeal to, because they're the ones who have little left to do in the game.. the rest of us still have heeeeaps of content to keep us busy.

Unless you're rooted the amount of damage that a rogue APK can do is extremely minimal unless the developer uses a zero-day to get root privilege(and if they had the knowledge to do that, they wouldn't be stealing RS accounts).
---
Tis is the only reason I can think of for voting yes
---
Comrade, while I appreciate your celebration via ceremonial canned liquid consumption, let me inform you of a deadly account security mistake you have just committed. Occasionally players will make this mistake unwittingly and return to all of their account’s hard work undone. No one suspects a thing until it’s too late. Going outside to celebrate your achievement may seem like a good idea at the time, but you left your account logged in and unattended. Runescape has warned players for years that leaving their accounts unattended can have devastating consequences. All it could take is your dog accidentally mashing your mouse and keys in such a fashion as to go to the bank and withdraw all of your items then trade them to some random person, or perhaps type your password in chat for all to see. Though you may think this post is ludicrous, strange events are known to occur from time to time. Such examples of events like this include a monkey typing an entire Shakespearean play on a typewriter, a baby scoring perfectly on an IQ test, the average gamer writing a grammatically correct sentence, or a coded message being hidden behind the first letter of each sentence in an otherwise long, wordy, and meaningless message about an extremely improbable event occurring simultaneously to one person’s recorded ingestion of an alcoholic beverage.
---
I'd imagine that RS3 is a harder task to get on mobile and working well.
---
Same thing with underground pass though, once you’ve done the quest and gotten graceful + high agility it’s really easy.
---
My only gripe is that the bridge should stay down after you shoot the rope the first time (I mean like wtf, Kotfik is right there, I doubt those zammy bastards can re-tie the rope to it without him doing something about it), there should be a way to keep the rope on that one rock over the gap, and there should be a way to leave the logs over the flat rocks permanently.
---
Another thing, Kotfik should remember which way you went over the spike trap too and should tell you if you ask him.
---
Unfortunately I’ve just finished Regicide so even if these changes went live tomorrow I already had to deal with that shit.
---
*Same*.... I don't have my QC though yet
---
Splitbark has never been in crafting. You have to give the mats to a wizard who makes the armor pieces for you.
---
I see a lot of that on lunar isle and and castle wars
---
Preach 🙌
---
Gz
---
I'd vote for Black Ibis before I'd vote for Summoning. For context, I hate Black Ibis with a burning passion. Animal Lore perhaps, but Summoning has no chance unless they majorly overhaul it from the RS2 version and even then it is not favorable.
---
Depends if you’re hardcore or not. On a grey helm I’d personally rather kill lava dragons and then agility and questing
---
The point was that the private servers is starting going for the mobile platforms, that may cause some problems in the future.
---
SAD!
---
Was terrible
---
I voted yes too, but I'll be happy either way. The only outcome that would upset me would be if jagex ignored the results of the poll.
---
No need to call him names.

Here's just a few. I'm pretty well versed in Psychological research methodology and it's something that's been studied for a very long time. Polls and surveys are part of that. Personally I mostly studied linguistic Neuroscience so I'm more knowledgeable about psychometric testing methodology but I certainly know a little about this as well. More than the average RuneScape player at any rate.

Lol you can kill crazy arch for rcb at like level 50

---
I got a third age bottom somewhere all the way back in 2009 or whatever, definitely didn't change the game for me haha, was barely enough to buy claws

Any post suggesting that recently has been shot down, so I wouldn't expect that to change... But you never know.

---
I really wanted Artisan, but I guess it was too early for the game to get a new skill. But I think the game is ready now for Warding.
---
U mean when it fails right? U realize the straw poll made by Reddit couldn't even achieve 75 percent yes votes right? And this sub is extremely biased toward the yes vote. This is literally the best possible environment for warding to pass a vote and it couldn't be done.

Dust devils have 0 magic defense, you're better off using proselyte or vestments
---
Manning a ship is more of a skill than being assigned to kill 30 goblins
---
Sure let’s make it minigame. 
---
How about also add progression like barbarian assault. Let’s make it really long term like say....99 levels. Yeah, sounds good. Maybe a few hundred hours to max.
---
You accumulate...sailing points to level up. Have different breakpoints give you access to different things. Seems good.
---
For maxing out the minigame level you get something prestigious....say a cape of some sort.
---
Yeah, seems good to me.
---
Dungeoneering was absolute trash, but if they redo sailing differently, it would feel like a common skill.
---
They already polled reducing the pass threshold and it didn't pass
---
Honestly, sailing would be pretty cool, but I don’t think it really fits as a skill. Adding it as content in the game aside from being a skill seems more fun
---
Petition to have Narnode be the official sponser of r/2007scape  on account of him being able to keep apes under control
---
I wasn’t against the purple one, but this one looks noice
---
There are a couple key points where i think this skill needs to learn from dungeoneering. 1 dont be instanced. 2 have global applications and methods of training.
---
A personal 3rd one people may or may not agree with is make the ship parts buyable. I dont like skills where how effectively you train 1 is dependent on your level in the other. I think skills should be able to stand slone. This last one in particular i dont think would get much support
---
You should be able to use that little agility shortcut both ways that you can take after the path but before the well and altar. Its a 1 way agility short cut but why. But then again once i finished underground pass i went straight on to regicide and roving elves so i usually just skipped upass after the first few times!
---
I don’t have a problem with a new skill. I have a problem with warding. It’s gay
---
I think you have no grasp on the xp rates offered elsewhere and what the implications skyrocketing xp/hr for rooftop courses would be.
---
 Ad mortem, inimicus!
---
If you're ranging tasks that would usually be bursted, the special is kinda nice.
---
So, you're fine with people blindly voting yes?  
---
Highly unpopular items like MTX still get 40% yes or so.  Hightly popular items get only \~5% no.  There are clearly far more automatic yes's than no's.
---
Why not just incorporate it into already exisiting skills? Ranged equipment is a mix between fletching and crafting.
---
Definitely not, but once you start it can very quickly get addictive. There are stories floating around of people taking out irl loans to buy rs gp to stake
---
Call me all ya want, the only words out of your mouth I'm listening to are "you're right" and you've said that.

---

---
I've had to change the year on mine multiple times. :(
---
A lot of the current skills are still very shallow despite their age. Many people would like to see this amount of thought, care and effort going into expanding current skills. One of the worst of these is Runecraft, which currently consists of running to an altar or Tears of Guthix.  
---
  
---
The vast majority of Warding content being suggested could be added to Runecraft, Magic and Crafting rather naturally, and would allow for Runecraft to actually have a secondary training method other than what is often described as "the most boring skill in Runescape".
---
Just to give some examples (these are not my final suggestions, just some thoughts to give you an idea of how these things could be added in within the existing skills):
---
• ⁠Robes - The robes could be made via crafting, and enchanted using Magic or Runecrafting. Just remember, Xerican Robes are already made using crafting, adding Magic or RC to the mix isn't completely necessary but is an option if you want to make it a bit more mystic.
---
• ⁠Imbues and Skilling Rings - I personally think Imbues as a whole need to be completely rethought (but that's a tangent), but if we wanted to take them out of NMZ, we could make a more fitting/deserving minigame or consider them a high-level enchantment spell, like we already enchant other jewellery.
---
• ⁠Pouches - Essence pouches are already so closely connected to RC that these could fittingly be incorporated to the skill. Rune Pouches could be encompassed within this or the Magic skill
---
• ⁠Tomes - I like the way the Fire Tome currently works and I think the others could easily be worked into the game in a similar way. Also potential to mix this in with the Arceus Library, or to add it to drops to new bosses (especially since drops are often the hardest part of polling a new boss)
---
• ⁠Anti-Poison Lamp - Straight off the top of my head, a craftable lamp that can be topped up with Anti-Poison
---
• ⁠Redirection Scroll - Just let people make the tab locations on their lecterns, or even add the Scroll to the lectern itself
---
• ⁠Magical Sleuthing - IMO the minigame is filler for filler's sake, it wouldn't be missed if it wasn't added, but could easily be an RC/Magic minigame all the same.
---
Finally, to put it bluntly, this sounds like a boring skill. It feels like they went with the least offensive skill they could ("it's crafting/smithing for magic!") just so they could get the 75% they needed to pass a new skill for the sake of a new skill, meaning more new skills in the future won't be "the first new skill in OSRS". There are already boring skills in OSRS, but we shouldn't have to accept another boring one just because some of the skills that came before it were also boring. I, personally, loved dungeoneering and thought sailing had potential to be something interesting and different, but this is a skill for the sake of adding number 24, and I just don't think that's a good enough reason when a lot of content could be funneled into the aforementioned pre-existing boring skills.
---
Better?
---
Edit: I'd also like to add that I will be voting no to Q1, but will be voting yes and no to the following questions based on my preferences. I'm not against the content being proposed, I just don't agree it needs to come with a new skill. I also think Skilling Rings are an awful idea and I hope they fail the poll regardless.

Imagine taking reddit this seriously, yikes
---
For the rich that is
---
They won't put warding in the game if it passed. They'll make the beta and then poll again about what should be put in the game. If you'd actually do research instead of just voting without the information you'd know that.
---
Fills* and it does and that's not really a shallow reason. We have separate skills for making melee armor and range armor, there needs to be one for mage armor as well. A "crafting triangle" if you will, to complement the combat triangle.
---
They bring them back once in a while so keep your eye out for them. They don't like keeping them around for too much because people get burnt from the game and stop playing if they play on the unrestricted worlds too long.
---
God the comments are the fuckin real talk boys. I’m glad I’m the only osrs player whose gf hates this game.

would vote this over warding easy.
---
I mostly voted yes to this poll but I agree that skilling rings is a dumb idea. I voted no to that.
---
It's the warding poll. It's making everyone crazy. (also it's actually really good. Nice job friend. )
---
I’m surprised he’s still a thing tbh , haven’t followed any of his stuff since he was begging in the g.e (2011??ish)
---
We tire of the antics of one camp, then switch to the another. Repeat.
---
It creates a neat oscillating effect.
---
Yup, and know what else is logical. If all the rewards pass but not the skill, it's very likely they will show up else where like Zenyte and Sailing (Zenyte was apart of Sailing but came with Monkey Madness 2 when Sailing failed).
---
Sadly, as much as I’d love to see something like summoning / necromancy come into the game, it changes too much to be good for it. It’s cool as fuck to be able to summon various monsters to help you fight, store supplies, or even give small buffs to you, but no matter how I look at it, it changes how both PvP and PvM are done in a way that would either make things immensely easier or would require a large overhaul and balancing to both, and at that point it’s just not necessary. TL;DR great concept and a huge amount of fun, but too meta-changing even if it was made weak, for all aspects of the game
---
i think you mean 30 y/o boomers. 
---
baby boomers would be the rs players that got free handouts of phats in the early days, held onto them then just bought the fastest method of every skill when they became easily buyable and spend all day dropping ":)"'s in mod marks CC.

Yeah this is 100% right. OP mustve been straight clueless going into ironman which is not the way to go. It's definitely meant for people with a decent understanding of the game to begin with.
---
Wait how
---
Checking the wiki will usually get you a better answer, faster.
---
It took me about 15 seconds to look up and find the answer to your question.

You mention the mm2 tunnel but not the docks?
---
400 chaos runes? Nice.
---
Practicing an instrument improves your skill. Iron man mode is just making an already grindy game take even longer.
---
Was it not a minigame though? It was instanced, could only be done from one spot on the map, and had gear drops unique to the game itself.
---
Seems more like a minigame, where warding fills a gap with magic gear and sailing would offer similar benefits as agility.
---
Nerf won't go through anyway.

Never underestimate the viewership power of the child demographic

Don't do the new quest and u shouldn't get any xp.
---
youre still not getting my vote back
---
It’s actually pretty good, you just don’t like IPAs probably.
---
Hmm, transformation doesn't sound grand enough. Evolution maybe?
---
What sketchy ass plugins did u download? Inferno helper? Zulrah bot? Pk auto switcher? It's one of those.
---
you should regret wasting 24m when it's a super easy minigame that gets you a torso in around 2, MAX 3 hours even with the dumbest teammates possible lol.
---
I wasn't around when I think the first poll, if there ever was one, took place but people basically see it/want it as a dungeoneering like skill where you travel from island to island instead of doing a dungeon.
---
i personally started my ironman as a f2p as thats how i started rs2 in 04' so i wanted that same experience and i've followed no guides and its been the funnest ive had in RS in a long while. still got my hardcore BTW ;)

Mom said it was my turn to post this this week! :(
---
yeah I know there are people who aren't complete condescending douchebags about it like you, but unfortunately those douchebags outnumber you 10 to 1 easily and they have 100% turned me off of wanting the skill.
---
This is a repost.
---
You do realize that if they wanted to rig it they could show a fake vote pool right?
---
I didn't read this grammatical monster but yes I love sailing and would vote yes to it because I believe that is lighthearted fun and the game needs more of that.
---
&gt; The majority of people opposed to Warding seem to be high level players with lots of money to spend 
---
Do you have a source for this? Seems like you're pulling it out of your ass
---
I've got 86 att 85 str and 80 def so I'm fairly close. I'm not too keen on having to do a boss with another player tho.
---
I hope you enjoy short gwd trips then
---
Agreed 100% would rather have sailing than warding all day any day. And so much god damn content could be made and added to it all the time we would never feel we would need a new skill ever again.
---
I like that a lot
---
Yeah lol it was for the whole bulwark nerf pvp stuff
---
Looks like you need 99 farm irl next to improve that garden
---
It's not a vote. It's happening.
---
New continent no one would visit unless forced to? No thanks. Development time needs to be put on realistic ideas.
---
I’m not complaining about anything, just stating simple facts. If you want to gain anything from experienced players, you need to have a base set of skill to work from. Some guy who is doing mems pking for the first time ever is not going to learn much at all from a veteran pker who knows all the ins and outs and squashes newbies like bugs.
---
:(
---
If it did come in what parts did you like

Not so much a garden as just a very small backyard. My landlord has the mower locked up so I cant even mow my own yard;/

High gambles and leechers.

Did you even stop to think before making this inane post?

I forsee this applying everywhere, due to a minor bug, and causing loot to be deleted on death no matter what

---
Day one and you already can't think of a single fact about warding. You stated a "fact" about players of RuneScape, not about warding. Try again tomorrow but I advise you to start over with day #1 tomorrow.
---
After the community backlash? Nope. Just like with other proposed nerfs in the past, after community backlash they scrap it.
---
No, nothing like that. And I barely touch my runelite settings. I've recently messed with tile markers after people in my cc swore by them. I don't particularly like them. I'm wondering if I accidentally hit something. I've searched for "tile" and turned off anything that came up, yet it persists.
---
The Chinese sold it to an American company
---
Warding was announced as a F2P skill, but other than that this is a great idea!
---
Again, this is the biggest update of the game if it were to pass. There is more reason to sway this vote if we’re being logical here. No one is going to rage over less insignificant updates. Money talks.
---
Sounds fun for a week or so
---
Yea fuck I didn’t think about this either lol that’s gonna he a real boner
---
Alright buddy, have a good one.

Expected house of an rs player.
---
Super lucky. The drop rate with 88% is 1/17(i think) so you having 7 items is pretty lucky. Also most people would kill for an Ahrims skirt
---
May I ask what your total level is? You do realize that there are easily 100 times as many non-maxed players as maxed players?
---
You're talking about a 1% difference in the gold sink that only shrinks over time as new players come into the game and train skills.
---
None of the other reasons you give are absent if warding's content is used to update other skills. Crafting gets expanded to make more than just one kind of magic gear, vis splashing would still be a part of magic/rc, the armors still get into the game, hunter gets improved, and the drops are still there.
---
You see how your arguments are not arguments for warding as a skill, but rather just arguments that the content itself isn't bad? I can't speak for everyone, but I think a decent number of no-voters want warding not to pass so that we can have it's content in a better place -- updates to existing skills.

Math time, based on a few previous posts about chins. I lowered the avg xp drop since you're starting out from a pretty low level, so even this is really generous. Probably don't expect to get these rates until you hit ~80-85 ranged. 
---
**Red Chins:**
---
* Avg xp drop per Red Chin: 300xp
---
* Current Red Chin cost: 1312gp
---
* GP/XP Red Chins: ~4.4gp / xp
---
**Black Chins**
---
* Avg xp drop per Black Chin: 400
---
* Current Black Chin cost: 2686gp
---
* GP/XP Black Chins: ~6.7gp / xp
---
For 10m, you could buy **~2.72m xp** in ~7600 Red Chins, or with ~3700 Black Chins you would get **~1.5m xp**. If you use ~1200 chins an hour, you would save about 3 hours doing black chins instead of red chins. 
---
Summary:
---
* Red chins would net you ~2.7m xp in about 6-7 hours.
---
* Black chins would net you ~1.5m xp in about 3 hours.
---
If you feel like the 3-4 hours saved are worth it, and you make plenty of GP p/h, you can go ahead and do black chins. Otherwise I'd definitely recommend red chins.
---
Also, just as a side note, most people don't actually recommend chinning until ~80-85 range. Before then you won't get nearly as much xp per chin so it'll be wasting a bit of money, but if you don't care too much about that and just want to power level do whatever floats your boat.
---
You typed too much
---
Congrats man! Definitely deserve that steak!

Add it to mobile or make it purchasable on Steam, either way I'd play it. Brings back memories when I was fishing lobsters in Catherby and at same time playing Arcanists.

You’re arguing that Jagex has the integrity not to alter poll results. If that’s the case, why is your counter argument just that?
---
No...
---
He was the one recording :o
---
I believe this years runefest theme is fossil island based on the video they released. So it may be closer than you think .
---
It's funny how in every single comment you reply to in this post you just type up a totally irrelevant response and never respond to the points being made against you. I'll spell it out to you again: Jagex should not be concerned with how players will behave on a subreddit in response to the results of a player run poll. That is a job for the moderators of this subreddit.
---
Why is it such a bad thing? The people who have multiplied accounts have more money and time invested into the game than someone who just plays a single account. I think it’s pretty fair that someone who has taken the time and effort to create said account should have every right to vote on it. Their vote is probably more thought out than someone who’s level 94 combat on their first account.
---
Hahahahaha! That’s well done! Hopefully the steak wasn’t tho...
---
I don't see why people want new skills when they hate the current ones. 90% of people slay all day then bitch about not having time to get 77 rc or whatever. Why not use the good ideas from warding's content to improve existing skills so that 80% of the game doesn't get ignored in favor of releasing another 5m gp/hr slayer boss?
---
incorrect, I typed none of this
---
you are a madman
---
the iron ore triple is how a lot of people get 99, because you do some crazy stuff to manipulate the game into mining in about half the time. how you got here on your own is beyond me. you are a god among men
---
That is fine
---
Vote cap per IP? Still mitigatable, dont see what else they can do
---
&gt;The company will do all it can to sustain it's IP in one way or another until it just doesn't work economically.
---
And even then they can just sell it instead of shutting the servers and leaving it to rot. This is what happened to a game called Realm of the Mad God.
---
In 2010 RotMG was created by a two delepor team called Wild Shadow Studios. In 2012 the game was sold in a healthy state to a big game studio called Kabam inc. Kabam worked with the game until it started bleeding money for the company. They did whatever they could to milk every last penny they could. It was certain RotMG was going to die. Then in late 2015, after a long time without updates, RotMG was sold to a small game studio called DECA games. They reinvigorated the game and nowadays it's as healthy as ever. Playerbase is up and we're receiving regular updates.
---
Its not insomnia if you never *try* to sleep, is it?

yes

Hilarious, so damn funny !!

Vote no bois
---
hey guys i smoke weed
---
You're still putting all no voters into the same box when you shouldn't. I really loved the ideas of both Artisan and Sailing but I don't like Warding so I voted no for it. But according to most people here I'm against all change even though I wouldn't be playing this game if there wasn't updates lmao.
---
Beast
---
*accidentally prays range after the dangle*
---
oh no
---
Yes, they will probably lock warding behind a quest, and new magic armour behind warding
---
Shut the fuck up serene
---
Do you plan on maxing? Possibility of future quests that would require you to train Warding, not to mention certain armors or benefits that would force you to train the skill because you would be at a disadvantage. If it does pass, there are many things subject to change that isn’t common knowledge as it stands. To erase any doubt of this, voting no helps.
---
all gnomes belong on a pyre
---
No but I don’t think it’s that because when I toggle on the Integer Settings under the Stretched Mode tab in RL, my graphics look great. It’s just that when I do that, my screen won’t become full screen.
---
I️t seems as if I need to configure GPU/toggle Integer settings for my graphics to be good but with the integer settings, I can’t get any full screen action. 
---
Not sure why my new computer is being such a pain as the old one just required me to maximize the client

Quick looksie at your profile - you seem to understand the concept of having a serious conversation on reddit.  Not really sure what about me intrigues you, though I am flattered.
---
Here are the [odds](https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/700383893652955140) for making it through the handholds on MEP2 ,
---
Of course higher levels are benefical but just like before it also comes down to luck, i did MEP2 last week with 58 agility, i fell i think 8 times when climbing the handholds the first time and twice when climbing them for the second and last time. I've read here on reddit some people who fell many more times. I would recommend using Slayermusiq1's excellent youtube guide, it saves a lot of time compaired to the wiki guide.
---
yall gey

Cooking and smithing arent. If they are agility and runecraft are aswell. So how are those 3 alot when you have mage range attack strength defence hp

It took me a second to get it, but that made me lol.

&gt; If so many no-voters say Warding will be a boring bankstanding buyable skill, moving it over to crafting or rc will not make them any better.
---
Crafting simply becomes marginally more appealing overall. Slightly more variety and choices than before. Nothing revolutionary, but still better than literally only making the one best set of warding armor from level 80 to 99.
---
RC gets marginally improved by having a few pouch upgrades and the option to get some vis. Again, nothing major but that's kind of the point.
---
&gt; In fact, rc is good profit.
---
Haha yeah let me use my 99 rc to craft double deaths for 1.2m an hour, or alternatively get 85 range and mage and make more than that at zulrah, gorillas, rune drags, vorkath, cox, tob, cerb, or hydra.
---
&gt; They need to rework the whole rc and crafting training method to make it fun.
---
That's not likely to happen all at once or any time soon, which is why it's important to use content that can help make them better when we can. If RC gets neglected for 5 years its no closer to a rework than it is now. If it gets updates that make it better and people actually start training it, coming up with ideas, being interested in the skill in general, it's more likely to be updated.
---
&gt; Thematically speaking, making magic robes isn't just sewing the robes. It's also imbuing them with magically properties. Crafting only does the former.
---
Yeah except when you make xerician robes. When you *craft* something you just put stuff together to make it. Throw in some vis from rc/magic (however it gets implemented) and tada you have magical robes. Runecrafting is literally harnessing the magical essence of the world into stones. Vis is literally that same magical essence except in some other unspecified form. Same activity. It still fits just fine. Also if you wanna talk about names, 'warding' is completely misaligned with what they want the skill to be.
---
&gt; More important is the fact that integrating Warding to crafting and rc does not make sense with OSRS's existing processing skill model
---
That is *completely* irrelevant. Neither osrs nor rs3 has ever been in dire need of being able to create magical armors. We have weird skills, one-offs, misaligned stuff etc. FM-cooking, except it's always better to cook on a range than a fire and FM is basically just wintertodt training simulator. Construction that has no relation to any skill other than using logs from woodcutting. Hunter, again no relation. Agility, aka diary unlock simulator. The skills of osrs are not some masterpiece of unified game design, and allowing players to use magical essence harnessed by going to the *magical essence altars* and using magic and crafting to turn component pieces into magical armors is as typical fantasy as you get. In fact, if jagex had announced warding's content as an update to rc/magic/crafting/hunter with that exact tagline, people probably would have gushed over how well it fits the game.
---
blue on blue is not my swag, but it definitely could use a tiny bit of work with the color choices. I personally like a brown cape idea with white trim.
---
This is me and my account not sure what you’re on about, and yeah it’s meant to be a joke bro xx
---
It doesn't lock anything that already existed in game behind a level, so until theres a quest which require a Warding level to do( which will probably take a very long time) everything you could've gained before Warding came out is still gainable, even if you do want to get one of the new magic sets you could juat buy them off the g.e.
---
I thought it was the people that work the hardest irl can buy the most bonds and have the most votes...
---
There are 23 skills if you want to get all of those to 50 you need a 100k xp per skill, if you get about 33k xp/hr average per skill that is 69 hours to get 1250 total or 10 hours a day. That is pretty no life if you ask me.
---
If there is an Authenticator delay there, I don’t mind.
---
Pretty much. Minute by minute training would be like any production skill, but working towards building your ship and improving your sailing skills to be able to explore the random-generated seas with friends for training any and all skills (islands with ore deposits, precious gems, unique slayer creatures with better drop tables etc. etc. Just essentially the "dungeoneering" aspect of what people want from it, but with friends tied to a more traditional skill, with your own personal ship, similar to PoH's.
---
Thats what sailing is and could have been to me. Its why it truly excited me, it got me thinking about how awesome it could be to train that skill to play with friends.
---
Warding just bores me to death. I'll just make same old non-useful armour like i'm doing smithing, finish the skill, and forget it. Just like i did with smithing.
---
You can tell by the tone of this post that they genuinely liked the idea and had fun working on it.
---
I never said that at all, obviously more groups other than rich high levels will be voting no but that aforementioned category has the greatest potential to overrepresent their demographic.  You just assumed that was my assumption, please be more careful in the future when throwing around insults that most apply to you.
---
He just wants another crafting rip off.
---
Imagine all the other cool skills they could implement to the game! It's fucking endless!
---
Imagine finally having a skill that isn't ever AFK. That's always been my dream for runescape. To actually play rather than afk while watching movies.
---
What the fuck is this based on?
---
They are going to lock the ability to make the new magic armour behind Warding, not the ability to wear it, don't spread unaccurate information.
---
You could still wear black dhide with level 1 crafting right?
---
d
---
Imagine starting a new video game thinking it could be fun but it turns out it was heroin
---
More OSRS copies of classical art please.
---
I also mean how much it might affect the game's economy etc.
---
Black mask for around 2100 kc.
---
why u blocking the url? did u get phished?
---
this is not real
---
They are working on it soon as mobile comes out... oh wait lol.
---
Jesus this what pains me the most, people voting no to an expantion  because they don't want to be challanged in a game that is all about challanges.
---
Picture of average black person -&gt; 🐒
---
You need warding to make it not to wear it. You don't need 99 smithing to wear full rune, don't be so stupid
---
Honestly it's such a shit argument. Just because there are already skills in the game that are pointless and boring, why not add another? Well why not get a skill that's actually fun, why is that such a bad thing? I'll remember this argument next time Jagex suggest adding a boss with a broken drop table. "Well Zulrah and Vorkath already exist so why not haha xD".
---
🤔
---
Should’ve hidden your stats now im gonna hack you
---
Colour scheme as a reason lolwhat :Dddd
---
MTX poll was before the login screen. fake.
---
An rsps is much more likely to be downloaded by osrs players than some random app. Its called targeting an audience. If you want to steal mass osrs accounts, this is a good way to do it.
---
bgloves *or* firecape take 50 hours of playtime maximum for anyone actually trying to get one of them and playing casually. it just takes longer if you spend your 2 hours a day of playtime on moneymaking at yew trees to buy a granite hammer instead of doing quests or training range
---
It's great for the economy
---
all content in the game is just for fun, wealth, or artificial levels/ranks
---
Virgin
---
Nice hour fresh account and fake post.
---
1 Seems as complicated as Hunter and RC.  
---
2. Plenty of the RS skills are buyable.  
---
3. Hard work pays off.  
---
4. If it's a buyable skill, shouldn't be a problem?  
---
5. Oh no, not the same colours!  
---
6. It would be healthy for the market.  
---
7. Makes it worth even more.  
---
8. Both can exist, and if anything, it would give them a moral boost that the community does accept new skills.
---
9. To convolute these skills?
---
10. They're a 500 million dollar company, I think they know quite well where to put time into.
---
"I know"
---
yes it is, you'll find it if you know where to look, i blocked url so results don't get leaked, unless you want me to leak them lol
---
true, i just remember it taking a whole day on my main back in like 2013 because people kept leaving after wave 3
---
KARAMBWANS!!!!!
---
The only reputable source we'll be able to point towards is the subreddit polling data, and I'm sure you'll be quick to point out biases in that. If you're asking for anecdotal evidence, I would ask you to look at the OSRS twitter posts and see the accounts that reply who are saying they will vote no. From the ones I've clicked on, most were runescape oriented twitter profiles with high level accounts.   
---
Nonetheless, I don't care if I'm wrong because it would still be interesting data that would help prove or debunk the myth of rich players using their wealth for extra votes.
---
They can poll something as many times as they want as far as I'm concerned. But no changes should ever be made without it passing a poll.
---
thought it was a titie in the start ;c
---
What? Jad is the simplest boss in the entire game. A hard boss would be something like Zuk or Verzik.
---
Never understood how this was never brought up before. Most people have at least one alt these days so you’re paying $22 a month for two characters in a game where you don’t even use the vanilla client? Sure you can say WoW has a lot of third party addons too but you can be new to the game and still be perfectly fine without using them for most things. 
---
Base game price also plays a huge part because RS is technically f2p and only the membership costs you money but it just seems a little ridiculous that they wouldn’t just up the price and give you two characters, once again who isn’t playing this game with an alt already?
---
I got divorced 3 years ago. Now with a girl who is a gamer, plays games next to me whilst I scape and is way better in bed. Hope you find the same my man
---
Bro you saying "stick figure", "frog", "black squiggle", "bones in a pouch" and "cracked lava egg" are all recognizable designs that make you see what the skill is? If anything most skills feature a prominent tool / object for that skill which this icon does nicely.
---
A corporation is not going to invested weeks of manpowner (designers) into stuff that is going to be voted no at the poll.
---
Never.
---
You could take so many supplies. Back in the day yak held like 28 brews plus a uni pouch which was equal to about 13 brews so you could take over 40 brews to bosses. Plus you could bank items there. If you didnt have a yak you could take like 2-3 uni pouches which equals nearly 50 brews.
---
You can’t compare the two at all. In one scenario (your raffle one) you are buying tickets to win a prize. You either buy more tickets and have more chances or you don’t and have less chance. In the case of voting on these polls you have two options (yes or no) if your a no voter and have two accounts your votes are suddenly worth 3x as much as a yes voter . The two scenarios are VERY different
---
Yeah those could have never been added in the mainland.
---
Well that pet is like the coolest in the game, I can actually grind it efficiently now!
---
then go play rs3 
---
/s?
---
i want sailing so bad dude
---
512
---
Umm, no. It's literally the same concept.
---
there’s a runelite plugin for that (didn’t read post btw)
---
still not getting my no vote back lol
---
You choose to believe that but it simply isn’t at all.
---
Relative to almost everything else in the game, those are very large achievements.
---
Whatever you say, kid.
---
Inb4 Onyx, Claw, Jar, and pet on your next Skotizo kill
---
I never liked kids anyways.
---
No I'm against adding unnecessary inconveniences to protect dumb people. A phone can become unusable from so many reasons outside of the users control, such as theft, faulty hardware, or just old age. And besides that, dropping your phone doesn't make you a dumb person.
---
I always tried to do charter ships for molten glass supplies but there were far too many other IM doing it. Obviously it's better now with sand and seaweed much easier to mass gather.
---
I never liked how you chose to play an ironman account (which should be like playing a single player game in theory), but still have to compete for shop resources.
---
Settled punched jad to death for 99 slayer
---
Is it really insensitive though? It's not different than making a colonial themed town full of people named John, or a Vietnamese village where everyone's last name is Nguyen. 
---
Why do we have to overanalyze everything? Its just a stupid joke about a really common Arabic name. And every culture makes jokes like this about others.
---
Man just handled raw meat and didn't wash his hands before touching his phone :| yikes dude, I know you had gloves on but still amigo, grats brother!
---
This is their first go. It hasn't been polled before.
---
Nice try op alt
---
I agree with Patric
---
Yep, let's bring it down to ~60% yes votes or so. I've done my part, voted no.
---
Is that a trash can over fire? Cause warding is gonna be hot garbage?
---
what
---
I hope todt drops you some commas and paragraphs..
---
Konar is not worth it unless you are going for the Hydra Pet.
---
it was very close.
---
Some guy drank a bottle of liquid after recording himself getting 99 in a skill, and posting it on here.
---
I've been having a grand time in my current CC. I've only seen people causing trouble very rarely, and they usually get kicked right away.
---
idk man sailing felt like a poor mans dg, id rather just have dg back tbh.
---
Only like 60, so I'm not due a drop at all. Just annoying to get 4 d2h if I see the rate you got :p
---
Imagine thinking that riding a boat is a good skill
---
Elves are for lewding.
---
Dropping your phone indicates that you're careless. If you're careless with your phone you probably have no bank pin or authenticator. I'm against blocking progress to protect a few careless idiots.
---
Do your part and make sure that this game doesn't end up ruined by these gamebreaking changes.
---
Lynx doesn't play efficiently he just plays consistently. He wasn't first to a single 200m in this game so I doubt it.
---
If you can't commit to the game enough to get 75+ ranged and do a few attempts at something that takes 1-2 hours then you definitely aren't qualified to make any decisions about this game. Not to discriminate against skillers, its just that if that seems like a lot to you then this isn't the game for you.
---
RFD takes time, for sure. But its very entry level for this games end-game. Again, if this seems like too much to you than this isn't the game for you and you shouldn't be making decisions on it.
---
Sailing is only a meme which won't become reality. It's incompatible with osrs.
---
The tables are turning, the hivemind is breaking apart, a new era without warding is coming
---
Do it efficiently
---
It might be the 24 hours just clicked over on ge tracker...I'm in nz so times could be a bit whack. 
---
I'll chuck em on and see how I go. Thanks for the words of wisdom
---
you should check out his videos. you might like them.
---
OMG Double exp weekend?????
---
Its got alot bigger now, its kinda how I imagined sailing would be of they added it to osrs
---
I checked out that sub. There is a post called Temple Dungeon. It's the layout for the Forthos Dungeon, but from like a year ago. 
---
It's nice to see it made it in the game!
---
Only if they significantly change the mechanics. The last time it was proposed it was completely instanced you wouldn't come across another player while doing it. This is a multiplayer game which is already too independent IMO.
---
The latest pet count is from February 22nd, found on their Twitter here:

---
If 50 more hours make max cape unattainable goal you don't need it
---
Fair enough.  The task lengths mean the chances of a superior are way lower each task though unless you extend. Never seen them worth extending personally
---
Please shut up
---
Thank you bud, I feel like I'v done a good job providing some one chunk style content while we all wait on pookaguy to post a new vid :)  
---
I wished he would upload more frequently.

Those already rare items don't have anywhere to go
---
Lmfao
---
Fuck Sailing. It's a minigame not a skill.
---
One tip: if you get the cryptic step on a master and get this step do it as your last step. One of the last master clues I did I got this step b2b, but since I didn't do it as the last one I had to go down the dungeon 1 more time..
---
Thats not the point. Grinding skills for 3 hours a day is not fun. You have to spice it up.
---
Besides. I dont see why extremist neckbeards who are insisting on keeping fun updates from getting into the game should have any more power than other people in polls
---

getting there! keep it up dude :)

youll have it soon
---
And that is why you spend time in photoshop to make memes and suggestions. Ooooh, these "retards" sure got very angry at your suggestions. I sent a few images to my neighbour and an ambulance just arrived in front of his house; I think he got a heart attack from the overwhelming amount of anger your posts generated!  
---
If you didn't understand yet then what I'm saying is that you're a retard.
---
Grinding skills nonstop for hours is not fun. And if you go for just 1250 total level, you are going to miss out on a bunch of quests which are going to be useless/not fun to do because you are way outleveled for them
---
is that alkan in the ancestral lol

Took me 6 times in the end, I died twice during the waves because I ran out of prayer and wasn't paying attention. I was so annoyed on the last time I died at Jad because it took so long to get there just to die because you missed the switch or something stupid. 
---
Anyway I decided to get all the way to the last wave and log out, went to bed, woke up in the morning and did it first thing with no issues. For me not having that hour or so build up helped a lot with my nerves. I also took  a few high healing food just in case Jad hit me hard, I didn't want to panic and try to do a couple brews between hits or anything like that.
---
Petition to revert it back?
---
oh yea i was using the fandom one, thanks mate!
---
I love the arrogance here
---
Reddit is not as big of an influence as you think
---
That is awesome, &amp; very sweet of her.  Happy birthday mate.
---
Holy shit lmfao
---
So I recently started doing NMZ and have a few questions
---
Is it worth training range there if you're not chinning? I've just been doing a regular rune cb broad bolt set up just because I was so close to 70 range I just wanted to grind it out, but I dunno if its worth going for 75 here if I'm not chinning (prob way too expensive for me). I take it you can't cannon in there? I've never actually tried and the wiki page doesnt say.
---
Is there a way to not have to flick rapid heal every 50 seconds? I swear there was a method that was extremely hands off, like go to sleep for 6 hours kind of hands off but that doesn't seem to be the case really?
---
Bro, he was just kidding.  You seem very sensitive.  Maybe you're new around here, but this sub isn't just professional game discussion, it's mostly people antagonizing eachother for fun &amp; meme'ing.  Don't sweat it, your cake is awesome.
---
I think I want to do slayer but it's taking a really long time and I'm just killing blue drags non stop for money.
---
i kinda want to do blast furnace or whatever could make me money with like 20 or so levels more
---
Title lies :( rip 90s
---
Dark Beasts are a powerful enough creature - they have an excellent Superior and are assigned in small numbers (unless extended) so are brilliant for fast points.
---
Not every slayer creature needs to ooze raw GP and skilling supplies into the players pockets like Gargs, Dusties, Kurasks and Nechs (which I would argue are examples of bad drop tables that are hazardous to the game).
---
Enemies that boast rarer big-ticket items amongst a pool of poor drops are quintessential oldschool content. If Dark Beasts need a buff (which I would argue they definitely *don't*), we should be looking at how we can increase the value of the Dark Bow rather than flooding their drop table with Rune items, stacks of raw GP and noted supplies.
---
I literally have no memory of any of the mechanics tho. 
---
I am going for a zerker build and currently have 50 pray, so I wouldn't want to go to 60. I might not stay a zerker but I wanna try it out with cape and everything ( including 94 mage, goodness..., at least that will help with slayer )
---
If you did it with 70 def/70 pray, and it was super easy, and you almost did it with 1 def and 44 pray, seems like 75/52/45 should be doable, however it may be difficult, since you are used to doing it for than I would be.
---
I am pretty slow with changing prayers and eating on the whole lol, so maybe I will have to train or use blowpipe.

---
I have a monkey with seaweed stuffed in its ass as my icon for my junk tab. Its only obtainable when doing the tai bwo wannai quest

Key word here being some people.
---
I have at least 200 hours in OSRS, and I dont have 1250 total because I spend alot of time doing other stuff.
---
Why should I have any less voting power than some nerd who spent 3 weeks grinding skills? We played the same amount of time.
---
this is perfect
---
And citizens who know fuck all about politics can still vote in politics. Thats how democracy works.
---
I was looking at the highest because those tend to be relevant when discussing profit. But if we look at Coal, it doesn't prove your point much better. It was 138 at its earliest and 130 today... And its highest was 280.... this past December.
---
So the claim that Skilling profit is down because of PvM is largely exaggerated. It has suffered in some cases from specific bosses and oversupply of certain resources, but overall the prices aren't being hurt that much. Just a few months ago, Coal was at the highest its been in years so the viability of mining was at its best despite all the PvM monsters dropping coal.
---
As for not liking magical getting more resources from a ring, fair enough I suppose. But if that solution doesn't work for you, then I doubt we'll ever see a buff to existing skilling because anytime one is proposed, it is shut down for similar reasons. There is already room to do more new methods like Minnows or such, but then you're just replacing old content with better methods and leaving the old content to rot, which isn't great if that is the only way skilling sees updates.
---
Well, the Gauntlet will supposedly be like dungeoneering.
---
the point
---
your head
---
*Diagonally*
---
You're right there's no right or wrong way to play(sans macroing).  However, if you straight up follow a guide like that word for word(and you're not going for top high scores or something) it's akin to buying a prima strategy guide for the first playthrough of a game.  Then again... we're talking about osrs where 99% of the population has never done a single quest in this game by themselves without the help of a guide so...
---
You got me....

Bet it's an eleborate plan with an alt to gain the karma back with this comment
---
degen normies thinking their opinion is more correct that the people who actually play the game
---
Wear two gloves and don’t take the base layer off until after service (or they’re trashed). It’s 100% easier to slide a glove over another glove.
---
but at the same time, that guy whos played 5000000000 hours is less likely to vote for something that devalues their achievements, e.g. faster rc xp for cheaper, even though its good for the game.
---
i honestly have no idea what the solution is, but ive been thinking about it a lot all the shit going down from the warding poll
---
You’re also assuming he cares that much
---
Really good money making for low level skilling is making gold bars into necklaces (I think). More than doubles your money and is like 40k xp an hour too
---
Is there a good guide to trident/blowpiping barrows? I have both at 75 mage/range.
---
That is what the recovery system is for.
---
Aside from the quest lock, new skills don't give exp from Tears for the first two weeks. So you should have enough time to catch up.
---
5106 vorkath kc and No Pet, this hurts
---
I CACKLED IRL LMAO HOLY SHIT I SAY THIS TO MY CO WORKERS EVERY DAY!!! GET THAT FUCKIN THING OFF MY CUTTING BOARD

Lol if you don't like the combat system go play rs3 or wow. It's literally the most defining feature of osrs

warding was in progress, sunk costs.
---
It's different when they're making budgets for next business year and they have to make arguments for developing a new skill

Haha yeah bro what's up

Upvote for semi peaceful ending on Reddit instead of us both angrily telling the other they are garbage for days on end.

There aren’t that many naturally, they spawn while you fight the queen.

Not with one prayer point

Just try it, It is a quest item for more than 1 quest, they will sell.

How do you think they got the ely? Bet they've done this a good few times already.
---
It is literally the first lol.
---
Exactly so why should we add a new skill that’s only purpose to be an item sink? A new skill shouldn’t be an item sink. How about we make PvM risky again?
---
Kinda sounds like you want to be playing Puzzle Pirates.

Loved that game when it was busy

Yesterday, because I'm only 60s magic (lvl 89 cb, still a noob), I went to do black demons task and decided to mage for it since they're kinda weak to fire spells. I tried out death runes. Spent 1100 death runes to lvl up once

This, but makeover mage first if the character is male

We’re about to get the Gauntlet. It’s basically Dung but without the OP rewards, and it’s not a skill (as it should be, Dung should never have been a skill).
---
Yeah, you could hop on someone elses pool, that will definitely work. Pool is better than clan wars because it fills your spec too. 
---
You can kill anything to fill your % bar, but some things work quicker than others, so skeles and worms might be the most efficient. Can't say I'm sure on that though. 
---
Miths darts will work fine, but addy might be better in terms of efficiency. 
---
Best of luck.
---
I want it
---
Cool, I just didnt wanna go over and get racks.
---
Cool, ill grab some addy too
---
Thank you.
---
what youve actually gone and done there mate is gone completely away from what we were talking about, which was that someone with, for example, 3 high level accounts, might well be blind to the problems with the game (which are inevitable when its as big as ors) that are much more obvious to everyone else.
---
also, out of interest, why is cookie clicking on several different spots to do rc better than cookie clicking a smaller amount of spots to do herblore and craftin?
---
Dead :(
---
RS3 is dead. Aint much fun playing a dead game
---
Yes. I did this once but honestly don't remember the process I went through. But I was in the same situation. Got locked out of my old email and had to switch it to a new one. I remember the process being fairly painless and I'm pretty sure I did have to do an account recovery
---
This is a map expansion suggestion, not a skill suggestion. Finding new places to do quests or train your skills does not warrant a new skill at all.
---
If you'd want my vote for sailing it should solely be about getting a boat and traversing water, make the boat better as skill progresses, having great sea battles with other player boats or perhaps npcs.
---
If it was integrity changing, they wouldn't have to poll it at all. I'm half serious.
---
No thanks. Works better as a minigame
---
No

Honestly I agree with the go play RS3 sentiment. You go into Dung with no items anyways, and you can play Dung in legacy. If you miss Dung, why not play RS3? It can’t be THAT much different than it was in 2012.
---
Anyone live in Nanjing or Shanghai? I want to make an IRL runescape friend
---
I've only ever died to a pker while wearing a spade so my view is certainly limited by experience.
---
The numbers Mason, what do they mean? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Pfttt well I am. Looks like a void symbol plus its purple
---
Yeah I voted no
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Helm_of_neitiznot
---
As long as your opinion is educated, vote either way.
---
Nawh, you definitely want to relate with the white knight as much as possible. Talk how you're a \~ 25 year old guy and just started playing again, forgot old account that had party hats on it.   
---
Oh what!? Party hats are not expensive anymore?! Wow, I didn't know that! Yea bro! My girlfriend just dumped me so I'm playing Runescape. LOL so worth it bro! You got any good gear for doing Slayer?
---
Warding more like  
---
not good
---
it will prolly not give xp in warding after half a year or so.
---
that was the case with summoning/dung back in the day
---
Despite what he said I have my doubts with the genuine amount effort put in with warding and the communities toxic response that they would want to invest resources into another skill that is going to get mass voted no for no reason.
---
Sounds like you play the game a lot. As a casual player who will never max, the game is plenty fun and there will always be something for me to do. I don’t even have the time to read this blog that they reference in every poll now. The first time around, I stopped playing largely because I couldn’t keep up with updates and the game felt like it changed every time I logged in. With that aside, those like me that quit round ‘07 will always be against massive updates.
---
A new area is more exciting than a new skill. I don't think anyone knew how overpowered and physically out of proportion Zeah would turn out.
---
Goddamn Reddit is stupid sometimes. You're getting downvoted but you're right. Items on the floor do not belong to the player in any way and no ingame logic checks can detect them being tied to your account. This is why drop tricking works, why you can juggle clue scrolls, etc. All the update did is make it so that you start getting bases and such in order again if you have all 3 pieces in your bank or inventory. If there's a base on the floor and another piece rolls it'll still drop as a base because you haven't picked up the first one, so you don't own a base yet.
---
"Players may now continue to gain Dark Totem pieces in order even if they have not combined their existing pieces. If you already have an incomplete set of dark totem pieces, the game will attempt to select a piece that will complete the set. This means that the chance of completing your set has not been made harder by this update."
---
Oh, good point. Another line to use that I can think of would be "Guys I left my wife and kids to scape". Etc.
---
I’m not a man thank you, I am a pretend e girl. All jokes aside. I think sailing would. Look at the front page! Throughout all the warding shitstorm sailing ⛵️ is shining. People want it, people want something different.
---
Agreed, and not sure why so many people are comparing the two really. Completely separate ideas, both could be added and be totally unrelated to each other.
---
Casual player here. I think warding would be a good addition to the game, it is fresh new content to play.
---
I was confused until I read this. I never pk so I don’t have any concept of pk builds.
---
Kill em like brutal blacks. Antifire pot + protect from magic and you won't take any damage at a distance.
---
? It's definitely not efficient to train combat through slayer at low level. Most efficient to max is getting at least 85 melees before starting slayer
---
Lmfao I saw this other day and didn’t put two and two together. Just spit my drink out laughing
---
So mage accuracy only affects if you splash or not and if it's not a splash it rolls separate from your magic accuracy to determine damage? Just trying to understand I'm new.
---
I’m a noob that desperately wants a torso. Please help me out
---
it's a new anime title
---
Just buy a blowpipe for the caves and then sell it back once you're done if you can't afford to keep it for now.
---
Convenience is what revived RS3 for me, I got a large chunk of my skills to 99 back in the "grindy" days and now was able to return and actually progress the game without spending copious amounts of hours on it. We're not kids anymore so we don't have time to spend grinding all day. Also I initially quit over EoC but coming back to it now it's actually much more fun than OSRS basic combat system. MTX we can basically ignore so that doesn't really bother me so the only major criticism that I see is that PKing sucks ass which is a shame.
---
Both games have their pros and cons but RS3 is not dead nor does it suck.
---
wait a minute thats not base 90
---
Everything is perfect except the color of the green dhide. Its funky
---
I have one.
---
I just wanna get my cape without it.
---
I'd rather see them revise the monsters to be a better training spot. Make the monsters higher hp and lower def so they are worth training on. Then give them a small drop table with stuff like potions and food; maybe a very rare chance of anger weapons even if just cosmetic. So compared to other training monsters, they'd deal more damage to you, but they'd occasionally drop some food to make up for it.
---
Perhaps they could also get a Slayer Task after that, but I think it would be fine to just make them count for existing tasks (e.g. Anger Bears for Bear Tasks). But if they decent to train on in general, I don't think they'd really need a Slayer Task.
---
I remember when random events used to force you to go do them
---
If you want warding play RS3 the game already has it
---
If you pick it up and die, you will lose the cannon.  
---
If you leave it on the ground (built), you can retrieve it from Nulodion for free.
---
The problem right now is anti pking is completely pointless and people can literally rag you in max
---
OP is not even that muscular. He's just holding his breath and about to do over 9000 damage with the next blowpipe hit.
---
This looks way better than any purple shit
---
Shhhh guys he didn't know
---
This is Caveman Only’s main
---
What am I actually looking at
---
I think that even though we might get future skill suggestions, none of them will pass and as they dont, theyll get less frequent. It might not be instant like no new skill ever but i think itll probably come to that if we dont get one soon
---
THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!
---
Seems fine to me
---
45 def zerks aren't meta anymore since 70 def 60att med levels have access to better gear and rigour/piety/augury. If youve quested enough of your attack there's nothing stopping you from that build, even a 75 att 70/75 def med build but you will end up having to go 95+ in offensive stats.
---
Like others have said there's loads of guides on making baby pures for low level nhing and it's a lot cheaper.
---
The flip side of this is there will be some fucking bank to be made if you just spend the first few weeks selling the components and ignoring the skill itself.
---
Yeah because already voted for passing yesterday.
---
No overheads and venge doesn't work for outlast fights lol. It's just staking with extra steps
---
Well jokes on you on that one, you don't have to like rs3 but don't make up stuff, the game is far from dead
---
no voters are now gay
---
stfu neckbeard
---
yes\*
---
They're actually fixing the fact priff was a hub you'd never have to leave. The majority of the best afk methods are stil there yet if you want the best XP rates you'll have to venture outside the place. 
---
Also the closer I get to max the less time I spend in Priff as I'm usually out doing clue scrolls or travelling all over the place doing quests.
---
(e) not (i)
---
You usually range them but since you have 70 range i'd skip them. Not worth the time
---
Thanks fam I worked hard to get the coloring just right.
---
Haha thanks, i've been considering making a post outlining it, might do so this week during downtime at work.
---
&gt; Not to mention the game has 100k players and this sub has 300k subscribers..
---
100k people CURRENTLY online, OSRS has at least a million unique players a month if not more
---
What? I dont get it
---
Never actually played or heard of that, if its anything like this ^^ it sounds like it could be mad fun.
---
Wait are you complaining about brutal black dragons drops? fucking lul
---
Oh i agree skilling method wise, but i don't necessarily think sailing would be trained identical to construct (make and remove) but moreso building specific things on ships being high attention, or just standing at a bank and making inventory after inventory of "barrels" or something like that. That would be the buyable afk way.
---
Warding will be a buyable 300k an hour skill apparently so it will take them less than 2 days
---
I see. Any reason why?
---
If so, then yeah RCB+broads are cheap and will work fine. The caves will just take a while at 75 Ranged since you don't get the same damage throughput as you would at 90+. It took me 3 tries to get to Jad without knowing anything about the caves, but I did do some research after the first failure. It took me another 3 attempts to finally beat Jad without  letting my nerves get to me. I was on-task for 3 of the attempts and off-task for another 3, although it was just already throughout.
---
I recommend bringing blood spells if you think you're going to make mistakes. Blood burst/blitz helped a lot when I was still learning.
---
As someone who works in foodservices and plays mobile on the clock more than I should, I appreciate this
---
Are you in an area with monsters? It might be the marked location to place a cannon if you are.
---
Because you can literally still go do whatever the fuck you want and not train artisan every time you skill. Just like you can go bossing or any number of other PvM or PvP options without doing slayer, you don’t have train it. You’ll get 99 artisan way before you max 15 other skills since it also involved all production skills, it wasn’t just for gathering skills.
---
You’re acting like a meta change somehow alters the actual game, the meta for almost all skills in OSRS has changed rather drastically since its release, this would be no different. And meta literally isn’t “multiple methods per skill” or it would be meta, meta refers to a singular predominant preference. I’m not “surprised” that you might not care for artisan itself, but saying you’d quit over it being added is absolutely absurd and just as idiotic as the guy saying he’d quit if warding was added.
---
You got btfo
---
This but do 6 first
---
It takes like two minutes to get there
---
Bots have been doing it for years. why do you think rl+ added it?
---
... What?
---
I'm saying higher slayer SHOULD mean higher money, just like virtually any other skill.
---
It's too luck based.
---
Did you talk to oziach?
---
Imagine being in favor of gerrymandering.
---
To find the exact amount?
---
We don’t do that here.
---
To be fair, other updates like Kebos also weren't tailored to high levels. But it can be trickier to appeal to existing players than new players since not every update will appeal to everyone. They do try to give a good variety of big updates each year and they have been making more of an effort to deliver content for all levels rather than just endgame stuff (as seens with Kebos and Warding).

Magic being strong enough has nothing to do with warding. you said warding effects non magic things like imbued rings but never explained why that was bad. You mentioned crafting and smithing which again has nothing to do with warding. You said that robes were easy enough to get which again doesn’t have to do with warding. You seem to be getting very heated about my opinion. It seems you just don’t want the game to change.
---
I’ve been around long enough not to fall for that pal
---
It's going to be a part of the way you play the game, new content is going to contain warding. They can't half ass this. You're also going to enjoy the skill after angrily ignoring it for a while.
---
The best part of sailing is we probably get sea shanty 3. That alone would have it pass the polls.
---
U must have never joined "bag of ice k", it's the new ice Poseidon CC
---
Warding is more than good to be a skill. If it will not pass other skill ideas will not pass for the same reasons. Because there is no way to make skill that every one will like.
---
People that have played for a while know better than new players though. "should we have double exp weekend"
---
New player: cool, I don't see why not
---
Old player: this would kill the integrity of the game
---
Oh fuck I need to change my vote
---
It works. Talked to him before I opened my hard casket last night and got gilded platelegs.
---
Even more reason that I'm correct.
---
The better customers have more say. Ezpz.
---
If the xp rates are anything like slayer, I'd have to spend 100s of hours doing some shit skill I don't want to train, doing shit methods that I don't enjoy. It's a fucking shit skill. Thanks for calling me idiotic for having an opinion though. Good thing your retarded skill only got 58% yes when it was polled so we're never gonna have that fucking garbage in the game. Keep downvoting gamer 😎
---
You know osrs skills dont go like that? Tell me 3 skills that give the most money by getting the highest levels.
---
You are new and coming from a different mmo, i get it. It's not how osrs works though
---
Combat is a money making skill, best one in the game.

Bandit camp guarding the river gorge = top tier world building

Good for you man, I’m not going back to shamans though I’ll end up quitting again
---
I'd be fine with that, as long as I know that the voting decisions are in the hands of ppl who know what theyre doing
---
There’s no way this guy has 200 hours logged at sub 1250 total. I got above 1250 total on an Ironman at like 150 hours logged. You’d have to be wasting a ton of time to have 200 hours logged on a normal account and still be below 1250, or literally just training skills to 99 one at a time or something.
---
Why would u ever mage Karil tho? Just dds spec
---
I totally agree, but i think choosing to afk existing skills and desiring another skill we have to / want to just afk isn't the same thing.
---
Those might get returning players, but  if you want to target *new* players, you can't look at it through the lens of someone with knowledge of the game. If they want to attract new players they need to focus on accessibility and f2p content.
---
mage is faster
---
I think the voting reqs could be higher, but how high is a hard thing to decide. Personally, I'd love to see a flexible system where you need any 2 of the following: Time Played, Total Exp, Total Level, or Quest Points. That way you can set higher reqs without it being unfair to certain account types (e.g. Level 3 Skillers that can get Total Level as easily). But I'd also say it is ridiculous to expect 1500+ Total to vote; players generally only ask for this kind of stuff because they are above that req and often forget how much of a time investment those reqs can be.
---
Personally I see it as unnecessary and is fixing problems that jagex themselves created by creating a new skill when there is a million other ways they could fix these problems. To me the fact that they are pushing such a controversial update shows that they have learned nothing from rs3. What is their endgame new players arent going to come to the game because of a new skill this is only going to cause people to quit the game.
---
Runecrafting , Thieving , Fishing
---
Fuck the Aldmeri Dominion
---
Oh wait wrong elves
---
Ah yeah haha, I think I went  little overboard with the stones in the river! I will definitely make some changes to this map!
---
scummy? how so? why is tapping with a finger or hand different from a foot
---
It’s literally the house portal, has nothing to do with warding
---
Something about the 100KC which is nice.
---
My banks 80mil and I'm still far from endgame pvm
---
Lmao found the 1700 total ape whose only 99s are fletching and cooking, aka the majority of this sub.
---
But people will not play mini games in 2019. We’ve gone so far down the efficiency scape hole that there’s no chance people would still be sailing 6 months after it’s release.
---
Only runecrafting is true from those 3?
---
This pkers toxicity came out REAL fast.
---
Do you realize questing is the fastest way to level up early levels? Waterfall is 1-30 atk and str. You could do dragon slayer almost right after this for like 34 defense and 40 str. Witch’s house for 26 hp. Holy grail for like 27 prayer. Eyes of glouphrie for 23 rc. 1-34 farming is questable. The feud for 15k thieving xp. Need I go on?
---
Low key why I voted yes.
---
That's fair, I guess it's just hard to make a skill fun and engaging to train for 100s of hours, although dungeoneering did it pretty well
---
Ah shit here we go again...
---
The poll isn't even gonna be close to where this matters.. I agree with you but it's not like jagex is gonna limit votes to people with 1250+ total who played recently this month..
---
Yeah, but someone told me to post it a week later captions as me @ barrows.. So i did.
---
"There's other bad skills in the game so let's vote in a new bad skill".
---
Ha
---
like the guy too good to play casual super smash bros with his friends but isn't good enough for tournaments
---
If the skill was so good it wouldn't be that way.. It'd be passing overwhelmingly like a quest or area expansion poll. It's just obvious that not enough people want a new skill.
---
It doesn't even solve the in game problems very well
---
I used a system whose purpose is to show agreement or disagreement as evidence people agree or disagree with an opinion? Well golly gosh I guess I must be some kind of idiot, using a system the way its intended. I bet I've been using that spoon contraption wrong too when I put it in my cereal.
---
Go look at Twitter if you want more validation that people despise NMZ. Go look at the official Discord. Nobody who voices their opinion anywhere thj ms NMZ is good content. People will admit they use it or think it's useful, but the amount of people who say "yeah this content is good and healthy for the game" is a handful at most and restricted to people who either afk or go for autismal ehp training methods.
---
it's called rare drop table and it's shared between all mobs in the game, with the shitty gem drops, rune items, d spear and half shield part, etc
---
from that rare drop table one of the outcomes is a nothing roll, you literally don't get anything
---
gl rolling it cuz u deserve it
---
Looool bjorn and ice poseidons crack crew
---
LOOOL dude its not even gonna be close.. So stop acting like your getting screwed. It would of failed heavily even if people could vote on 1 account.
---
By the looks of it bois, people want sailing to be polled! What about an RSHD graphics improvement?
---
I broke my ankle similar to how this guy's snapped. I can confirm that it was no fun and an absolutely painful experience.
---
Thanks!
---
But PKers want respect and complain when no one votes yes for things that benefit them.
---
i did the same at dark crabs with wildy elite done
---
WHERE'S JA?!?!
---
&gt; Looks like they have some sort of evaluator that prompts them the risk around the area they are scouting.
---
From the other post thats been linked in here, that is exactly whats happening
---
https://i.redd.it/6ows978o47b31.png
---
I'm sub 1250 and I agree. I barely understand the game yet, so I just read the polls and don't vote.
---
but I think y'all should vote yes on warding. it's wise to regulate new content, but don't summarily  dismiss it either
---
None because it will fail without the need.. It's not that just high levels are using alts.. It's that most high levels are voting no.. I haven't seen an account over lvl 105 that has seriously said they voted yes. Every high lvl pvmer/pker i've seen are all no's.
---
I'm talking about the normal table.
---
It's on the normal table for brutals, at 1 in 512 chance of dropping.
---
Hes new to slayer, may not have to points to skip
---
Why would they look into this lol, you died to a dc, or suspected ddos. I doubt they care
---
Idk what he means about that, might have something to do with zerker.
---
What he means with MM is that if you accept the exp reward, you get def.
---
Nothing ever will, probably. New skill as an integrity change when?
---
dumb question, whats ehp?
---
Why stop there? Get rid of non-total level worlds.
---
Try “07 altar” very good clan chat
---
I’ve been going for 70 herb for like two weeks in prep for the quest. I just hate herblore :/
---
Meanwhile 400kc on iron with no Cudgel
---
I’m curious, why would double xp weekend kill the integrity?
---
You've been watching Stranger Things havn't you?
---
That averages out to just over 608 gp per kill
---
\^ indeed. While reddit which has 5-15% voters max think their opinion is law and should be in the game no matter what.. It's such a joke. These people get chubs at sandwhich lady pictures and then babyrage when skill that is not needed is voted no by a large portion of experienced players.. Still havent seen 1 streamer who said they voted Yes and those are people who literally play OSRS as a job and would use warding content for their stream.. and they still voted no. The skill just isn't strong enough, it only appeals to ironmen and low lvls
---
go blame the players at the g.e. that the price is too low in your opinion
---
im at 70 chests with no drop lol
---
being a sweaty neckbeard isn't an achievement, that's called being a disgrace
---
That's why max cape isn't an achievement
---
The same argument used to defeat warding can be used to defeat sailing. All of its features can just be added to other skills.
---
Fair enough lol that happened a lot
---
theres a grace period for new skills
---
No one uses smithing for armor because you need to be like level 99 to make rune plate bodies. It doesn't look like that'll be the case with warding and I'd be all for them lowering the level requirements for most of smithing and adding some higher level gear. Also, getting tired of random enemies dropping things they shouldn't have and being the only/best source of it.
---
Whole lotta gang shit in west Vrock.
---
Should make them into rune dragon alts if he wants money
---
I like that a lot better, much more thematic for a production skill and blends well with the other icons
---
Id like a balance with it. Not the wild west days of the past where items spawned after two minutes. We saw how that played out with DDOSers hitting off servers to get people's loot. 
---
Maybe a grave system, or something like it. I'm not sure c
---
48 fps too rip
---
I want sailing...Idk why. I already repaired a ship to fight the legendary dragon of Crandor! My ships swiftness was unparalleled!  They sing songs of my heroics! Yet when I tried to enter my ship once more...IT WAS STOLEN FROM ME! Doth he not know who I am! THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE CHAMPIONS GUILD! I'll get my ship back, then should be at least 75 Sailing when they retcon my XP from slaying Elvarg.
---
Someone has to use pures and send those scouting bots back to lumby
---
someone mentioned in chat a few days ago in world 2 someone was crashing the price of frozen whip mixes, so i tried to buy some and i ended up buying 8 for 1gp each and nobody i know can tell me why this happened
---
Did u add a green pixel
---
This is a non-issue.
---
They didn't take anything from Sailing for Fossil Island; there was only a single line in the Dev Blog saying "we could add Fossil Island with Sailing". And if you honestly think any possible island would be exactly like Fossil Island, you are not a very imaginative individual. There are serval pitches for islands, both official and unofficial, before and after Fossil Island and the majority of the mare nothing like Fossil Island. But just because one of a dozen rewards in the Sailing Dev Blog was "Discover Fossil Island", that is all you can conceive the entire skill as. Ignore the Gemstone Caverns (which they actually gave details on), mermaids of Charlotaynia, the lost island of Atlandys, and everything else discussed in the Dev Blog. Yup, just that one island is the only type of island that can ever exist in OSRS.
---
Sorry, what?
---
EXACTLY! You learn to tribrid one step at a time. First on other people who are just as bad as you and clunky, then you move up in skill. Starting from the bottom builds up skill and confidence.

Reminds me of the golden gnome video awards from like 2010 or 2011 everyone used the same song cant recall what it is though

Animal Apogee it is indeed! Cheers.

He wasn't really doing anything
---
Dude better have maxed cooking.
---
Did you even read the blog mate? Invention is about augmenting existing items, while warding is about making new items! What you basically saying is that invention is the same as smithing, crafting, fletching or any production skill, jesus!
---
Everything you've said is a brain dead one liner that brings almost nothing to the argument. Exactly the type of person to blindly follow the crowd and argue against the other side
---
Basically. People will vote out of spite. This subreddit doesn't seem to realize that.

Ummmm EZ has been closed for over a year I'm pretty sure. I was in Vengeance at that point in time, a sister/rival clan to EZ. Current clan i'm in is called Resurgence, can pm me if your interested

iirc Runelite has a plugin that alerts you when a player not on your friends list comes within detectable range of you.

Doesn't solve the problem but it's something.

Played the game over 10 years ago, and just got back into it a week and a half ago. My first time hearing about Warding was when I started browsing this subreddit last night. (Trying out F2P before committing to P2P)
---
In general, I'm in favor of new skills and greater customization. Warding seems it would give mages far more crafting options, and potentially give them similar defensive options to other character builds. (I tried playing a magic-focused character briefly, but the lack of defense was tough.) Based on the developers' statements, it seems it would also add new quests/items/areas (which all sound good to me). Dissolving items, as well, seems like an interesting mechanic and a way to recycle crafted objects.
---
In short, I don't really see any drawbacks.
---
I mean, you could say that about a lot of potential updates. I don't think that's a good enough reason to not have them.
---
The downside is it could also lead to more vote manipulation. If players could change vote at any time before the poll ends, you'd see more players trying to persuade or bribe players to change their vote. I'm not sure if positives would outweigh negatives... It was also polled before and failed and this seems more of a feature than an intregirty thing, but you could justify repolling since results are hidden now.
---
Boots like straight out of kingdom hearts 1
---
He probably has no desire to play a game, otherwise they would’ve come to a consensus
---
&gt; I personally don’t think warding sounds like the coolest or greatest skill ever but I think it has a place in the game especially since gear from the two other combat styles can be crafted while magic gear can’t be.
---
What kind of an argument is this? 
---
"Yeah, it's not great, but it doesn't contradict game lore and it kinda makes sense..." I'm giving you actual physical terms of what this would mean for the game. If all Jagex wants to do is not contradict lore, then there's a seemingly infinite amount of not so cool or great shit they can arbitrarily add to the game and waste our time with. 
---
&gt; I don’t mean to imply you would vote no to everything but a lot of people voting no absolutely feel that way. I haven’t seen a legitimate argument about warding specifically about why it’s so bad. 
---
This is really rich coming from the guy who gave us: 
---
"It's a gold sink. Oh, it's not? Well it's an item sink. Oh, it's not? Well you won't have to train it... oh, you will?"

I understand that coming up with the goofiest strawman you can like "integrity of the game", is the most reddit tier thing in the universe, but I've given you actual logistical arguments of what warding would mean for the game. It's mean you lose tens of millions of gold, you lose tens of hours, and then you never look at it again, just like you almost certainly did with smithing, crafting, cooking, and fletching. Stop acting like I haven't given you real arguments because not only have I, but you're the one who's just fucked up basic facts about the discussion we're having.

In my first 120 on my iron I had 2 guthan spears and an ahrims staff so there's that
---
How sweaty is your chair
---
Tbow is far superior for zuk. The waves are not that much harder with acb.
---
Fossil island is what they wanted sailing to be, so idk what youre trying to get at with all of this. Sailing would do even more instancescape and I certainly wouldnt want that. I dont want more of fossil island-esque content. Idk why you bring up other islands, thats exactly the problem, that sailing wouldnt just be the hot pile of garbage that is fossil island, it would be even more than that, and then it would be instancescape ontop of all this to really give the artificial feel of a private server. Yuck. Like, sailing in itself isnt a cool thing on RS, its not immersive, this game just cant do that. So the only "cool" thing that it offers is the content that it gives access to. And thats just gonna be fossil island on steroids. Everything this game doesnt need.
---
Lol I thought those were funny as hell so I guess I'm just double dipping
---
Context?
---
You’re reasonably unhappy, but probably addicted too
---
This one is so much better. The warding one is an eye sore
---
Says the guy who had 1200 total pre-eoc lmao. Summoning was great.
---
You know what? I actually like that more, too. Do you have a link?
---
The reason for the bond purse is because ironmen already can receive bonds from other players (I would never suggest such a thing if it weren't already a feature).
---
Yes
---
Maybe not sweaty, but freshly washed hands can be annoying to get into gloves for sure.
---
One of the biggest things for gloves is handling different types of food especially with raw fish and chicken. You can pretty much eat raw beef and raw pork if it’s been kept relatively clean, a lot of the bacteria in pork/beef gets dangerous when it crosses a temperature threshold and it doesn’t cooked all the way through.
---
Chicken and fish can be a lot worse and the gloves are great so you can pitch the residue of whatever you were working off your hands.  Barehanded would take so many washes that It would be mostly washing their hands!
---
So you're high, demonic, and horny?
---
The only value a level 90 slayer monster has to the game shouldn't be that it's "good points"
---
Eoc is the only reason rs3 is still alive
---
That's rough.
---
You are calling the developers kids now? Very mature and intelligent argument against warding.
---
Next!
---
Best series by far
---
You're supposed to shotgun a beer!

That sounds like runelite(+) the sketchy one that's not actually affiliated with runelite

Already voted yes on 7 alts though
---
But seriously dude, stop. Youre being an ass, along with going against your cause, in terms of people not liking you. Dont, its just unecessary
---
Yea, you're right. I put in a recovery email just in case.
---
This is old, why are you reposting this?
---
Damn! Time to upgrade my attack and prayer lol. I won't have any trouble solo pking pures etc? With the higher cbt?

Sure, it seems that it's best to choose the option that works for you.

You have to lose 50% of all your bones to pkers for it to be worse than gilded altar.

Have you tried asking the RL discord server?

is the number on the osrs total ppl playing rs then? since it says like 85k vs the 71k that site show for osrs?
---
Will you help me with laundry? = Incredible Reflexes
---
Not a cool skill when the game will die because of it
---
Very well done. I Tried to do it on a larger scale and it did not turn out so well.
---
That explains why you're so good at this.
---
Also, nerd.
---
Zulrah hasn’t been that kind to me yet
---
It's just a dragon imp..
---
Ok but do you have a better solution or are you one of the parasites
---
Okay, so we should nerf 1-2 lower level Slayer monsters and buff Dark Beasts. They're a fucking joke at present.
---
I haven’t, I’ll do that.
---
Can you lure one of the high level NPCs into that store?
---
Yes they are
---
You didn't even lose much

Thanks that’s really encouraging how long were you single til you found a new partner?

You wouldn't think social anxiety includes online anon interactions but it does. Even here on reddit seeing that little red sign pop up showing a reply raises my heart rate.

Social anxiety be like: Modern forms of social interaction requires modern forms of anxiety and it fucking sucks.

Totes relate to the peaks and troughs though, one minute i wanna join a clan/guild and shoot the shit as if i have real friends the next I'm sweaty (Unfortunately not exp related sweatiness) and ready to rope flat pack crude chair meme it.

Business "growth" is a cancer. I hate the mentality of "if you're not moving forward you're moving backward". What's so wrong with businesses maintaining millions or billions of profit without obsessing over growing it? If it's dropping, then sure be concerned, but what's so wrong with maintaining something good? Quality and the consumer always suffer from shortsighted business growth decisions.
---
That lever did not come in 2001. To begin with it obviously wouldn't teleport you to high level wilderness which didn't exist. Besides that, I am 99% sure it was only made for its current purpose, just no idea of actual date. Maybe digging thru wiki news posts could help.
---
just a group buffing skill in general seems amazing!
---
"And this is our son's room. He plays lots of videogames..."

They are super helpful with questions you may have! I had to ask them some questions because my RL was not working, and the maker of RL got on and was like "what in the world did you do...?"

Super awesome people!

If I am doing slayer solely for profit, is it better to extend skeletal wyverns and adamant dragons, or better to keep them as free point tasks?
---
This exact thread will exist in two years after we reflect upon warding being voted down.
---
That's what I keep thinking. Why does 2007scape hate dopamine XP drops so bad
---
I remember this lol
---
I want a new school and I think it sounds enjoyable to have new content. I like it. I never said you don’t have valid arguments but I have a different opinion. Deal with it. Go vote no and leave me alone. 
---
I never said those first things nice straw man just putting words in my mouth. Also you won’t have to train it. You don’t have to do new quests or diaries either.
---
Then it off
---
Also, shoutout to [Bandos Page guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/62n9eg/my_collection_of_dirty_toilet_paper/). I had a similar collection back in the day but I gave up on it.
---
/u/Michael_RS, how's it going?
---
I was thinking about going for wr(41i think) im level 71. Its cool to have other people to talk to about it. There arent many of us
---
Is it more than double in some stats? Cause that’s my main point. Soulbark rains violent apocalyptic diarrhea over Ahrims in the defense department.    
---
The level 55 armor is better than Ahrims in defense.
---
Sailing &gt; warding
---
on the list of things that wasn't asked for
---
Ye its been like that for a few days now, but the price of prayer pots will lower soon enough for sure.
---
You must not know who Zezima is

I’m guessing ZEZIMA could probably contact Jagex if he wanted

Idk man

Very cool. Proud of you.

And yet they have been?

ToB has been out so long the high level community basically has infinite money now. 650M doesn't mean anything anymore.
---
Your right, who is this 'zezima' looser anyways
---
nice Iceblock
---
That's just forcing Warding down people's throats, which completely invalidates the argument of "you don't have to train it if you don't like it so why not vote yes"
---
NMZ is shitty, but they shouldn't create a new skill just to fix issues in existing content, it should have more good aspects on its own rather than just being a big bandaid update
---
&gt;Btw: Old school* (not "oldschool").
---
Really?
---
If you must kill them then antifire pot and range/mage from a distance. Would be a hella long task, though, so I'd probably skip.
---
Why not just move on and come up with something new?
---
That or release all three Artisan, Sailing and Warding altogerher. No need to spite the players who wanted one but not the others.
---
Calls someone a dumbass. Uses phrases like "so stupid." And "literally no sense."
---
&gt;Your learning how to deal with these special creatures.
---
I don't see how killing elves teaches me how to fight abyssal demons. And why I only get to learn when killing them on task. What would make sense is having to be well trained to a certain level in the art of combat and then having a slayer master teach you how to slay said special creature and some special creatures requiring a new item, location, and/or quest to fight. As an entire skill, slayer doesn't really add anything to the game.
---
&gt;Without slayer everyone would be killing the easiest creatures with low defense because thats the best damage output and results in the greatest xp based of the combat formula.
---
Yes, slayer the activity adds variety to training combat by incentivizing the killing of different monsters. I think that makes it a good activity (I enjoy training slayer very much). But that doesn't make it a good skill. Champion's Challenge would accomplish the same thing if it hadn't been so poorly designed. Remember dungeoneering? Also a fun activity, but it did not make sense to release it as a skill.
---
&gt;There would be no reason to train attack defense and strength on difficult foes which would be completely ridiculous.
---
Drops? Slayer points? Having a max hit larger than the total hitpoints of cows/chickens/yaks? You do realize that slayer has not existing since the beginning of Runescape, right?
---
&gt;They way you learn more and master a skill whether in a game or irl, you must repeat increasingly difficult tasks until you can do them all.
---
Um. Are we playing the same game? The way that you master a skill in Runescape, typically, is to repeat the same task, usually one of the easiest ones, indefinitely.
---
I had to read it 3 times, but that's because I've only done 1 cryptic clue and had to remember how they worked. Doesn't excuse rudeness though.
---
Aw fuck
---
Yea somehow I think that no clan is sending 15 to kill a shitter like you. It’s probably like 3 max and you are just hyping it up
---
damn bro this is the content i like.
---
I disagree. I want our game to grow. Without big and great ideas we’d just be an old fart in the wind slowly fading away
---
Right but the phrasing in the post would lead you to believe this like *just* happened...

Ely always rises for new high level updates

Yeah, exactly how I feel

Looks like the House portal with the Void Knight symbol on it

I'd prefer no new skill, honestly.

Average joes like us don’t have this problem. It’s not that jagex can’t fix user related issues it’s that they can’t fix this specific issue
---
Than snape grass? Which you can farm hundreds of per run of allotments? No, might be cheaper though because snape grass seeds are kinda expensive
---
I think the game was better when the GE wasn't there. Actually gave purpose to certain towns. 
---
That and it was pretty cool to see people saying "Bank Sale" and being able to get a good deal or RIP someone the f off. Haggling was actually a thing.
---
No sir, the title of this post implies that you are unaware of how to use nouns, such as "Guthan". In a similar way that shops are not called "Tesco's" or "Walmart's".
---
If I gave it any more attention, it would chafe.
---
Stop acting like this is all pkers. The minority use these bots.

I’m sure you can gather why the dips/spikes exist. The game went from 100-200k consistent players to 15-20k in less than a year. The only reason it picked back up was the release of new bosses and PvM content. “The first time around” was not due to any updates. The lack of updates  and minimal changes. That’s why the GE/gwd was added, it’s why the games time frame is closer to 2011 than 2007.
---
Does it list bows as items you can dissolve?
---
Who said anything abt quitting?
---
You forgot the firemaking guild
---
AMD RX580, open source drivers. I'll try fiddling with them some more
---
They're a pretty big deal for ironmen
---
just wondering, why?
---
I started mlm at 30 on my main. by lvl 72 i had full prospector and just under the amount for upper. So i had both by 73
---
OP claims to want to be an ironman but doesn't want to put the work into advancing to the point where he has all of the items that he thinks he should have. I want to play the guitar but don't want to put the work into actually getting good at it. Analogy is valid. Learn2analogy, bro.
---
If you read the post you'll see pretty much everything in there got into the game and it fits way better
---
As ironman I can say they are not.
---
oh ok thanks friend
---
The skill isnt finished yet btw. This is only a concept.
---
Happy scaping haha

I work with raw meat and we go through 1/2 to a full box of gloves a day with just 3-4 people.

Gz, I got a Kodai for my first solo drop :(
---
Yeah 6m per player for a torso, takes about an hour. You have to put in a lot of time to get good enough to do it though. Those leeching clans don't take just anyone, you have to try out for them. I just happen to love ba unlike 99% of the playerbase.
---
Still my favorite set in the entire game by far. Makes me secretly wish you could glamour combat gear in OSRS so I could rock Veracs everywhere.
---
Yes, and?
---
who cares lmao
---
A vote shouldn’t be made hastily. Just like irl you take your time to consider your options and you make a personnal decision based on what you think will be best for you. 
---
Nonody is forcing you to vote the moment the poll drops.
---
So again, 13 year break. What's the deal with rs3? I see people shit on it here, but is it just a reskin or a totally different game?
---
They promised us greatness, but yet they provides us with shite. They're trying hard to fix zeah so that it doesn't look like a mess anymore but it's probably going to take millenniums before that ever happens
---
Oh you can unlock upper level only at lvl 72... lmao.. so obviously I'll go for full prospector first
---
Posting on reddit is free and easy. That's why we have posts like yours in the first place.

This occurrence isn't Jagex's fault. They offered a solution. 
---
Do you know what solution they offered? No. Did it have to be an email? You don't know that.

It is literally a solution to the problem that they aren't causing. A situation that can occur on any platform if someone knows your login name.  You sound like an ignorant shit.

---
I voted on Warding, when it first was proposed i thought it was way to complicated, but they have done a great job making it into a presentable skill, of course it gonna need aome tuning but no skill has been released perfect.
---
As for sailing , i wasn't playing OSRS at the time so i have no idea how the skill was supposed to be like.
---
As for Summoning and Dungeoneering it's a big NO for me, Summoning basically is EasyScape, it gave you waaaay to many advantages in the game.
---
Dungeoneering i hate because it was a multiplayer skill, you had to team up to train the skill (effectively) which for me personally goes against the whole idea of RuneScape.
---
Whats this a reference to?
---
Yeah you’re right, but how much nerfing/changes has been made to all these drop tables and people still don’t like it? I just don’t understand why something that would literally benefit everybody expect people who are maxed and people are not okay with it. New loot from monsters and more xp. Honestly my biggest thing here is that there’s another skill I can get xp from and I’m lowkey getting hard about it 😋🤪
---
Okay why the fuck are you bringing alch runes when you’re on ancients?
---
EOC is the only reason OSRS exists
---
Meh they are illegal in most states.

I'll keep tabs on your account to see all the cry baby posts when over a quarter of the players vote no :)

Im not sure how ate up you actually were about the soul rune/rune axe situation, but honestly I think the ways you went about it with going as close to RSC as possible still kept true to the "spirit" of doing things By Release (without bashing your head against smithing for weeks and going without any uploads). Loved Season 1, can't wait for Season 2!

---
Sure, but to never ever change anything is how you kill a game. 
---
People who got 99 the boring way might be a little peeved, but that would be offset to some degree by now having 99 in a skill that has a whole lot more utility.
---
Games like Warframe do this all of the time. There's more dead, broken, and irrelevant content in Warframe than there is content at all in most games. The dev team will spend months on an update only to ship it in a bad state and NEVER EVER come back to fix it. This is what I don't want to see in OSRS.

well i was thinking of that yes. with a small database in the background it wouldn't be hard. however the UI to keep things logged would be tedious. in addition to that I'm not every confident in my coding skills to prevent data leaks and break-ins. so rather not dive that rabbit hole \\\^\\\^;

No proof

Hm that’s odd, he logged in just yesterday. I was at Bandos at the time and told everyone on Discord.
---
They're good for alchables and elite clues.
---
What clan? That was clearly a solo trip /s
---
Another 99 that I can just buy with a small fraction of my bank, what an achievement.  
---
If it was like dungeoneering where it was actually fun and wasn't a buyable, a lot more people would vote for it.
---
Did you watch the stream? Because I did. You’re arguing based off of 50 seconds of the whole conversation he was having, which was very much pro warding. 
---
Idk why you guys are convinced that mat k is ‘one of you’ nerds defending the honor of this game, but he isn’t.

82 yes

Yes 10hp 1 pray account.
---
Bad advice, you're gonna get a better helm after fremennik trials and graceful set exists
---
Rigour is the better upgrade, especially if you do vorkath. 
---
But if your play style is heavy melee, then it sounds like avernic makes more sense. 
---
So to break it down, rigour is the better upgrade, but sounds like avernic fits your play style better.

Knowing where to stand on certain phases is crucial, I also bring a couple karams to combo eat between phases so you don't lose DPS. The karams also help you survive when the "mage" phase decides to rambo back to back range attacks on you.
---
I feel like with Zulrah offense is your best defense, I can do 3-5 kills per trip with 1def because I'm able to do a lot of damage. If you're using void I'd do a 3way switch to range with the helm, accumulator and BP with rune darts.

I really enjoyed the episode. The OC raps are really something else, I love them.

I’m going to say something unpopular but important, if you’re trying to be quick and efficient you might as well rush upper level unlock.

The mining outfit gives 2% bonus XP. It’s 260k XP total by level 99. It’s hardly worth rushing the outfit when upper level can be achieved first and then you can power mine 72 almost 2-3x as fast as sitting MLM. 
---
As you use upper level, then you can pick up the big bag upgrade / prospectors and it won’t be a hassle. Way more afk and you’re not wasting time on the lower level longer than you have to.
---
That helmet is so fucking sexy.  Ughhh
---
Do you like cats?
---
55%-65% yes.
---
That’s what I’m saying. People are voting on multiple accounts for both sides. This defeats the purpose of a polling system. It is no longer “how much of the community is for or against” its “which opinion has the most alt accounts to vote with” which is not how voting should be conducted if you want results that truly reflect the opinions of the overall community. Voting on multiple accounts should be against the rules. If 1 player votes no, and one player votes yes on 3 accounts, the opinion of the player with 3 accounts is “worth more” than the opinion of the player with one. The votes of each individual player should count equally and as of right now they do not.
---
Mind me asking which state? Palatable food? Do you mean ready-made or hot food? Even then, I'm dubious of your claim.
---
Why I go on a tirade is because I am tired of seeing this myth all over Reddit. I am in fact an expert on this topic, so I feel it's important to stop the spread of misinformation. If this truly is the case in your state, then I digress. 
---
Either way, what I have said is true
---
Can't really do anything about the bots, certain clans run them as a "service" and you rent out scouter bots that will roam hotspots and immediately report any player they find into a discord server.  The accounts themselves are infinitely renewable because they're level 3 with no stats at all. They barely have any real interaction with the game as well so they're unlikely to appear suspicious to automated bot detection systems. Jagex will have to get very creative to tackle this specific problem.
---
Thanks I'll try this
---
Definitely get Iban's Blast first
---
Change gud! You didn't even read the blog!!
---
I'll guess no. :(
---
hook me up with someone who knows how to do secure sql inquiries and i'll do it. :D

No I know that, talked ingame a few times with the guy.

I mean moreso he probably doesn't want to talk about why he refused alternatives for what is the most famous account.

F keys, have your spec wep lined up where the spec bar is in your invent, know the tics so you know when you can pull it out without a delay.
---
What a childish and immature response and reason for saying no.

ZamorrOk lmao

honestly, i just want the cabbage skill. Fuck all the others
---
this is getting too straight for me 🙅
---
ITT people realizing but not saying that growth and capitalism is unsustainable and impedes the creative wills of the developers who love the game but are forced to create content that would generate a profit.
---
I desperately want to propose my design ideas for the skill- areas locked behind arbitrary sailing levels and the idea of it being a minigame make me hate it so much when It has much better potential
---
I would love that! Feel free to do so!
---
I should have written it out multiplicitavy as *1.10-1.15 instead of a plus percent as that's what I intended (and now I'll edit my post). With the 10% boost, 50% magic accuracy would become 55%. Regardless, I don't think even an additive +10-15% is as significant as you think it is.
---
But by that argument no new content should be added because it distrupts the status quo
---
I've been trying to say sailing&gt;&gt;warding for like a week now.

Plz jagex.

There is no lack of real arguments, you are just choosing to ignore them.

They were also pretty clear on the latest QnA that if it fails but is within a percent or two of passing they probably tweak and revisit the skill later.

Those are dragonstone rings, not RoW

now how do you pin messages oof

Grey chinchompas can give 600k exp per hour? Wow that's really worth it then, I'll just go with grey. Also, noob question, I want to use rapid as the attack style for fastest exp?

Perfect example of why I don't like pure pking. The highest value item you got was a 40k bracelet of ether

Your life is a meme
---
Didn't ask you to, but i remember 2004 everyone thought he was a botter cause he was, jagex just defended him everytime, Zezimas account barely ever talked...
---
This is what will be the game's undoing. Dumbass fortnite kiddies who don't know how the game works having say in what gets added to the game.
---
The term you're looking for is overprivileged hypocrites
---
yeah what if we had combat skills on a toolbar instead
---
Fair enough, I’ve done it too
---
Excuse me, I meant to say 0 fun and excited updates to PVP made specifically for people fight other players. The bounty hunter rework, fixing  rushers, pvp armors. etc. All proposed pvp updates fail unless skillers and pvmers can take advantage of it some how. 
---
So fuck off dude.

A fix would be preventing the lockout in the first place, not a workaround.

That is a thing I hate about magic. If the enemy has any magic level, it's pretty much never worth using magic against them. Magic gear offers no melee defense so you have to either pray (no prayer bonus) or safespot (ranged is cheaper). It just all around sucks to use magic for combat, outside of the OP bursting.
---
Rigour plus hides is so much higher DPS than arma with no rigour. Hides and arma are basically the same DPS.
---
Rigour, definitely. Its damage increase in ranged is way more efficient than Avernic defender's in melee + Rigour's ridiculous defense boost makes you tankier too.

No. Those two are right, literally every “argument” is a copy/paste from another post they saw like 3 minutes before theirs. 
---
It’s either “ruining nostalgia” or “should be thrown under runecrafting” or “poorly designed” 
---
That’s literally the 3 most common arguments that’ve been challenged with better arguments for days on this sub-reddit now.
---
Its not about the bulwark in this instance, its about black dhide and the way magic def is calculated. Bulwark just accentuates the problem of exceedingly difficult to kill singles targets by giving them nutzo range+melee defenses too
---
&gt;fixing rushers

You can't spec tab anymore, so there's at least one hole. Crybaby pker lol.

I've just seen a screenshot further down this sub of Zezima speaking via in the in-game chat recent, about the Warding poll. Seems he can log in.

He’s got my account build. Strongest build in the game to do everything pvm related and pking. He’s sitting at 108/109 combat and can attack pures deep wild with the same damage as a maxed main

It has done absolutely 0 to help. *do you even pk?*
---
I know you dont have any, but could you provide evidence? And not shitty board posts back in 05 lmao or 20 second clips of him  spamming fires.

Yea honestly the only reason I don’t skip the task is because how short it is. It’s free slayer points

Lucked out on mole slippers lol
---
Adding new content to a game isn't the most important part of a game, it's increasing the player base and then adding new content.
---
With that being said I feel like warding was made to just keep current players interested.
---
It is really hard to say. Reddit had pretty high support while other platforms had much lower. But the poll is currently at 91K Votes. Reddit only got like 16K and Mod Ash's poll is only at like 10K; not sure about Facebook. So the actual number of votes is probably like 2x all three public polls combined. And it is also worth noting that strawpolls, twitter polls, and such can be voted in by non-OSRS players or players unable to vote (e.g. F2P) and some may have even been voted in multiple times by the same person... Which totally doesn't happen with the official poll using alternate accounts... So it is hard to say how well these polls and their community's results will reflect the actual poll.
---
Because of those 91K votes, I expect a lot of them are from players who play the game but don't involve themselves with social platforms for the games; a lot probably don't even keep up with Dev Blogs and only check them out when they see the poll. And part of the reason I guess 70%s was because user from Twitter or such would likely bring it down from where Reddit had it, but I'd expect those unaccounted for players to be more in favor than opposed. But I am not confident enough to say they'd push it to passing; especially with how big the voter turnout is.
---
Warding could solve this

Hahahaha

July drama: Jagex holding Zezima hostage to pass warding !!!!

Ahaha sorry for not putting thousands of hours into the game to reach the max amount of xp possible, i guess i shouldnt vote on the polls at all
---
Well, I'm definitely not a zulrah professional, cause I have only about 200+ kills, but lately I could make with my orn pool pretty often 4 kills / trip. (I think it is not that much at all).
---
My stats are:
---
99 hp
---
99 range
---
92 Mage
---
99 def
---
70 prayer
---
The gear Im using:
---
Mage switch: toxic trident / sara cape (not imbued) / malediction ward (the blue "wildy" shield / occult necklace.
---
The ranged switch: toxic blowpipe / ranged skillcape / blessed d'hide body / blessed d'hide chaps / amulet of fury.
---
Constans gear: Serpentine helm / infinity boots / ring of suffering (i) / barrows gloves. 
---
This is the gear Im using atm,  At first I had lower stats and full void, and I was happy if I could make one simple kill / trip.
---
I think its pretty important, to maximize your DPS. Try to use as many switches as you can. If you're good with only 2 switches, don't worry, with time and practice you'll be able to switch more.
---
Eat an Anglerfish before you start a kill. The plus HP means you have to eat less, so you can damage more Zulrah.
---
If there are like 5 spawns, sometimes I kill a few, so I got less damage. 
---
I hope I could help a bit, but as I see, a lot depends on your gear and on your skills as well.
---
GL.

It did plenty to help lol. Oh wait, it took away your ability to abuse things.

Maybe people would support pking updates if you weren't so toxic? 
---
And yes, I do pk. Your flair says you're a pure, so I guess you only "pk" in quotation marks

Fuck off

The hell are you talking about? Those are perfectly good reasons for not wanting a particular skill in the game
---
Yep
---
You're dumb
---
Sorry man I’m only playing, I’m just jelly i can’t do stuff like this myself.
---
Will do, thanks.
---
TBH, I kinda hope it doesn't get 70-74.9%. If it falls in that range, you'd have players calling for a revise and repoll for years to come; players still ask it for Sailing and it wasn't even near-miss range (near-pass makes more sense but they call near-miss...). So either fail in the 60%s or pass so we can move on from Warding.
---
As an adult, maybe 4 hours.
---
As a kid, 8-12 per day easily
---
"The skill looks very boring to train" is an absolutely valid reason to vote no. You obviously haven't read every argument if you think "literally" every argument is a copy paste of the same thing.
---
Me too
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I'll update if I find anything.
---
What progress do you gain inside it? What buffs do you get progressing in CoX, yeah, you can get items, but the fun of dungeoneering was grinding for the next tier of weapons and supplies inside of it, and there was a sense of achievement when youd finish floors and gain levels, theres no sense of achievement when I have 710 kc at raids, and only 6 unique at a total of about 240m. Iunno, that's just my personal opinion,  I like a sense of progress :p I get what you mean by it's like CoX though with changing room rotation, and randomized boss order. I just prefer a skill like that over warding is all I'm saying
---
Yeah, exactly
---
6 kc no pet smh jagex fix ur game
---
&gt;if Jagex can't help players like Zezima what hope do us average Joes have?
---
this problem by nature does not affect average joes, drop the pitchfork
---
It's a skill and combat based single player minigame and you start with nothing and collect resources and weapons to progress
---
He was solicited for an answer. It's not like he said this as some sort of announcement.
---
Itd be great content dont get me wrong.
---
Butttt if we based it off of KD, it would become farmable with alts.
---
Then because of that, the PK cape loses any prestige associated with it, because literally every account will have it.
---
Super Restores are currently cheaper on the GE.
---
You okay there bud? Short circuit?
---
Alright guys, we added a whole lot of BiS gear. If you don't want to use it you don't have to, but don't get involved in PKing because they are going to use it, unless you want to just do f2p.
---
Got 3 ballista parts in my last task, yet I always go back for more like an abusive relationship.
---
Back on Rs2 and Rs3, they usually prevented the new skill from being able to accept lamps and xp rewards to prevent people from doing a bunch of quests, diaries and things like penguin hide and seek to instantly boost levels and jump up the highscores.
---
I wouldn't say need but it is something I'd like to see eventually. I also don't know if I'd say Warding would be the best skill; it is an Artisan skill and there is only so much you can do to make that enjoyable. But I do agree that it would be well polished given how the OSRS Team goes about updates.
---
do you even know what graceful does? what kind of skilling are you even talking about?

&gt;Fighter helm gives 5+ stab and nezzie gives 3+ str bonus

Am I the only one that stops doing a boss after getting the pet? What's the point of continuing? Might as well switch to Zulrah/Raids at this point for GP.

Dude what the fuck gtfo out this sub man or put nsfw
---
If that’s the truth then sure, but I find it hard to believe that Jagex’s intention were for a single late game player to by bones to get membership on 10 inactive accounts that they will never use again aside from this one time to vote in the poll. It’s not like they constantly keep 10 active accounts that support the game. I think your logic here is flawed as well to say that it’s only to support ones personal interests. I voted no on multiple accounts for my own personal interests and I find it hard to make a good argument for why that’s fair and how I’m supports the game if I will never use any of those accounts when their 14 day membership from the bond is up
---
If you have 100% accuracy, then it's 1/26, however, when maging Karil without a magic setup, your accuracy will be below that, so you'll splash, making it so that hitting a 0 is morelikely than the other individual damage values, so above 1/26.
---
As a returning player who tried both styles out let me give my take. 
---
More fun is pretty subjective I'd say they have their own kinds of fun. OSRS for PVP and grind if you like the longer grind, RS3 for PVM, faster break through the more tedious parts of early-mid game due to the amount of convenience added for training/traveling/questing/etc..., and RS3 just has significantly more content. 
---
The EoC was kind of a sticking point for a lot of people as well though it's waaaay better than when it first came out, the old EoC was part of why I couldn't get back into RS after leaving it. The current EoC combat is a lot of fun now and tons of strategy to it that comes into play in the high level content. For me I don't think the more basic combat of OSRS even compares anymore. 
---
But that brings back to the PvP and PVM thing, the EoC is why PVM is so much more fun on RS3 and it's simultaneously why PvP is all but dead on RS3 as these mechanics in play just don't work when it's a player using them against another player. I play back and forth on both and mainly prefer RS3 just for the sheer convenience now I'm older and don't have as much time to dedicate. But I don't think as a whole either are more fun or superior than the other it really depends on my mood.
---
Both are IMO worth playing and great games, neither reflects the old style of RS though I will say that much. RS3 and OSRS are both evolved version of 07 in different directions and for as much as OSRS gets touted as being 07 it's really not. Visuals, lack of MTX, and the simpler combat is all it really has in common. Again not saying that's a bad thing just that you gotta go in and be ready to appreciate OSRS for what it is now verses what it was back before the community and Jagex slowly evolved it together.
---
voted yes
---
Those characters? Or those bazoongas?
---
i also voted yes
---
voted yes to for the reminder
---
hell nah
---
And what made you think posting this was a good idea??
---
In this same light, the only reason they didnt support it before is because the "popular" thing to do was hate on it.
---
Once public opinion was less skewed, the streamers were able to change their opinions.
---
Wish it had a multi-option. These things are funner witg friends. It's an MMO afterall.

Yo fr tho, hella wasn’t tryna see this

4. Enjoy the 6 lobsters

We already have sailing in the game go play fishing troller if u want to be a but pirate

It's funny because I voted no for all those items as well

Nice mustache &amp; gz on 99 HP, its one of my favorites c:

Lmao I totally did the same. xD

What kinds of plugins in Runelite+ are OP?
---
Recently just getting back into OS every now and then and have a few accounts that seem like they'd be fine to pk with but i'm so clueless on gear / set ups nowadays.
---
Here are my builds
---
74 Combat
---
60 attack
---
85 strength
---
91 range
---
86 magic
---
85 hitpoints
---
45 prayer
---
1 defense
---
 
---
&amp;
---
62 Combat
---
81 Range
---
86 Magic
---
50 Attack
---
74 Strength
---
75 Hitpoints
---
1 Defense
---
16 Prayer  
---
I would really like advice on both good set ups and also if I should just get 31-44-52 prayer, 60 attack, 75. I'm really unsure of what to do with this account as far as pking so any advice would be great. :)
---
go and play rs classic.
---
I’ll vote no to your vote no. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Why would the tutor be based in Al kharid? This doesn't seem to fit geographical themes, it would make more sense someplace like yanille with the guild of mages, or another area with a history of mages. Maybe the mages tower south of draynor!
---
no im grinding slayer now kinda a new members i might go for the iban blast if it makes that huge of a difference. was thinking i had the requirements with my range being 77 and mage being 56
---
it never matters what type of damaging magic spell you use, it all counts as a "magic" attack and every npc only has magic defence. there might be some very rare exceptions like during a specific quest.
---
As a chemist, I will say gen chem is awful lmao
---
Voting is also equal to not voting (rounded to some very large number of significant figures).
---
It's been changed since then
---
New watcher and now i have to go back and watch the rest. I love this style of video where its gameplay with cuts for comedy moments. Reminds me of the old days of watching rs vids on yt.
---
Fucking OP.
---
Nothing about warding/new skill, but let's extrapolate whatever i want for propaganda purposes. Scum.
---
is it really that bad? i would think a new skill would be better you're gonna get everything to 99 eventually and be bored and if not well then you quit the game and it doesnt matter lol
---
We stand alone.
---
I've got an account which has members which you can have if you like. I don't play anymore. Came back realised I dont actually enjoy the game and quit.
---
For once it seems like it'll pass m8. Lots of positive comments and likes on social media
---
More content
---
AND GAZE UPON THE BATTLEFIELD
---
We could also take that same wheel analogy and instead of saying it’s just a fancy new wheel, we could say the cart’s been rolling with three wheels just fine for years, and doesn’t need a fourth... but that fourth wheel might give it more support, balance out the other wheels.  
---
A lot of people are saying we don’t need another wheel...
---
"If somehow everybody decided to do the opposite of what economics and human psychology say that they should/will do..."

What the fuck

I honestly don't think people would waste resources doing that. The name has been taken for 20 years
---
You can do it just that you wont be making as much money per hour due to less kills and more supplies used, but you can still do barrows. What timezone are you in?
---
Man maybe I was just a mega casual when I was a child, or maybe it's because I was a literal child when I first tried this game (IIRC I was 9) but I would have had no clue what Desert Treasure was until I started playing again last December
---
They took classic down
---
I voted no to that content too, but cool argument.
---
Agree with dungeoneering, definitely should be a minigame. Husbandry into farming, also agree with that, farming is pretty lacking in overall content. 
---
Foraging into farming? Definitely not. Foraging could have more than enough content to be it's own skill.
---
Summoning how it was introduced in 08 would definitely be too OP, agree. But there can definitely be a summoning skill, it would just need to be balanced around OSRS.
---
If Artisan, Sailing, and Warding all does not pass I don't know if any skill will be good enough
---
OOOOOHHH MAI DAYYYSSS
---
hmm, I don't know which task you're doing but when I got the runepouch on my ironman I only got attacked by pkers 5 times. also if it takes you 15 min to get back, thats maybe a bit much
---
What’s the 92 and 73 from?
---
You know it baby.
---
Well considering English seems to be your first language, yet you're using an American-English dialect - you're not using it right either.
---
The 'Defiled', huh? _Interesting._
---
What is the harm in voting no?
---
That made no sense. Bit like your life in all honesty
---
Ahrims will definitely need a buff if warding is passed
---
next time, dont use armas as meleing, bring karils
---
It’s the most important fallacy. None of this has to do with reviving consensual player vs player fights. Where is the BH rework they promised?
---
I feel like people making the argument haven't actually worked in a kitchen, let alone have their ServSafe completed. Wash your hand regularly and it's not a problem. Wash after touching raw meat, use tongs, learn about cross contamination, and be vigilant. The only time I use a glove is in my left hand, when I'm handling and cutting steaks for a good amount of time.

---
Very savage Timmy don’t know how I’ll recover
---
I literally voted yes on warding lmao. That doesn't mean I believe it's necessary for the game for any reason.
---
Firstly, I also very much enjoy making up theories and using words I don't fully understand in an effort to make myself sound more photosynthesis. 
---
Secondly, we are not discovering or translating a new language in this case.
---
That man is smooth af down there
---
It's funny how everyone laughs at communists and at the same time is hating on how "investors are ruining the game".

I’m glad I didn’t see it tbh because I wouldn’t have posted if I did haha

I tried doing Slayer once when I was tired. Missed a few mil the next morning too.

---
Pretty sure that's just the foot pivoting as they are knocked back, doesn't really look like anything is particularly bending like it shouldn't
---
It really is how things are typically balanced. Late game monsters almost always have piss-poor standard drops and expensive uniques, or great standard drops and moderately priced uniques. 
---
It's already **microscopic** niche has been phased out with the introduction of things like ballistae and dragon thrownaxes, not to mention the nerf it (and void) received some time ago. It's dead content, used by gamblers those who don't understand the fundamentals of PvP. A ground-up rework would breathe new life into a long-dead item and slayer monster. Leaving things that are, to their core, complete shit alone for the sake of nostalgia is nonsense.
---
I hate that I know where you are by looking at the minimap. Hope you get many nuggets with you xp swag
---
What does the blackjacking plugin do
---
Given that most medium level content doesn't demand the stats that boots bring, boots don't have to be obtained at slayer levels that scale with your defence.

In addition, requiring more levels before obtaining these items than other skill counterparts initially would've created scarcity in the market on release. This would stimulate the slayer economy and making it a worthwhile skill to focus on in the early days preventing people crying about how useless boots are and why Jamflex should've just added them to smithing.
---
Up vote it lol .. i mean us zerkers with 75 attack only have the Sara sword to train with or bludgeon and there both 2 handed weapons ,
---
Ahrims would be way op if it could drain st and magic to zero.
---
Yeah that sucks :(. Or get magic secateurs not game breaking but I love farming.
---
But can you still use d scim if indont finish the quest
---
You dont need ice gloves.   
---
If you have ice gloves, picking up the cake cools it immediately. Otherwise, you can go and kill an [icefiend](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Icefiend), while wearing gloves, which functions similarly to ice gloves. Without ice gloves, you have to kill an icefiend with the rock cake in your inventory. The other option is to leave it in the bank, though you will have to wait several hours for it to cooldown, so it is not recommended to do so.

Yep 🙄 I for one was on the fence about which way to vote but the nonstop shit talking in this sub made up my mind for me
---
Wait, in osrs or rs3? Or both?
---
A
---
It's super inconsistent from key to key, but it averages out to 100k, so you can go on some really good streaks. Like I got dragonfruit seeds, torstol seeds, and dragon dart tips back to back to back, then I got 480 iron ore.
---
Well to be fair any post about warding wouldn’t make my reply unrelated. I basically confirmed and agreed what he posted only I did it with words not a picture meme.
---
dumbass
---
Ironman dummy
---
How about you? I'm pretty sure what he wrote is valid grammar. Regardless, the message came across. The only actual grammar mistake I spot is, just a dash between to-be. "to-be (x)" means someone who is soon becoming x. So in this case a soon to-be WoW developer. I'm not certain if it's valid grammar without something like "soon" beforehand but regardless who cares. People usually don't employ perfect grammar on reddit, and his message was understandable.
---
Wow that's a pretty good advice, thank you!
---
It sucks, isn't it :(?
---
Jagex aren't going to lower the cost of membership, even if their membership profits doubled, tripled and so on. They'd post the record month and continue with those same prices.
---
Does that sound like a dead game to you???? You have some high standards. You also make it sound like that drop happened from one night to the other just like, waning player base is a normal thing. Pretty sure it stabilized now too
---
I support an actual low level hub that engages new players with a variety of skills runescape has to offer. The quests around lumbridge and the tutorial lack a bit of the depth and breadth of the game.
---
This is exactly my point. His name is not "Guthan's". It's as simple as logging in and looking him in-game.
---
that's quite unlucky. I suppose you could try to kill them in the lava maze dungeon thingy but that takes even longer to get to and you would probably need to bring prayer pots. You could also try and do your wilderness tasks when the servers are the least busy and work on other goals in the meantime.
---
He looks like the Chinese president, Xi Jinping
---
They were exported
---
don’t have a bond so i cant vote, but why bwaners 180’d on warding so hard?
---
Those 3rd age druidic robes are just amazing.
---
I don’t know. There’s a strange man in taverly that has a hornless unicorn though
---
Hes not drawing nor referring to Guthan. Hes drawing Guthan's set on a player character
---
If maxed, what are you after? Xp? Pets? Gp?
---
Nah just wipe it off with a dirty towel, it’ll be fine. The night crew will clean it wink wink
---
Why would anyone ever put more than a 1 gp item in there
---
Had this same problem with top streamers a few years ago and could fix it for them. Pretty sure they could change his log in credentials if they put their mind to it too.
---
Fine, hoe about we take away the drop table from those lower lvl monsters then? Gargs also have the gmaul, which is much stronger than the dbow.
---
Outrageous. 
---
These fuckers always ruin shit in the wilderness.
---
Thank you for ignoring the former, more relevant point in place of responding to the latter
---
I do.
---
This man has big brain
---
Lmao salty pricks this is like pvp polls 2.0
---
One of my favorite bits of btw rng was finishing my zenytes in just over 400kc
---
I think it’s just time consuming but I always do them.
---
Sill doesn't really solve the ddos problem
---
Afaik the GE price is a fraction of what it actually is worth.
---
Do not sell it on the GE.
---
Necessary.
---
Stop overplaying it guys. NOTHING on these clients are NECESSARY.
---
They are a crutch.
---
Haha that's the funniest thing I've ever read gg man hahhaga
---
Honestly, I kind of get it. I was like that before warding, but the blog post changed my mind. But I understand not wanting a new skill out of principle.
---
That's a PK hotspot because it's like an intersection of a lot of different shit and it's a teleport on the spellbook. Do them in the Rev Caves instead or if you don't care about Cannoning and really want to avoid PKers, go to the Lava Maze Dungeon
---
wait why is file size relevant
---
Exactly. there's nothing necessary that these clients provide.
---
They simply boost us up.
---
I think they are just a bit to ahead of themselves. Whether adding a skill or not. Whether it be warding or something else. I just feel as though they are starting out with something that is way to intricate.
---
Exactly. Jagex preemptively surrendered long ago and now they're stuck with this bullshit the playerbase pretends they're entitled to. Fucking ridiculous imo.
---
You don't actually need a client to play the game. It's an AID, and spoiled players don't understand this simple fact.
---
Well yeah, you don't get into powerful positions by helping other people thrive to the best of your ability
---
So you're saying that 1 key is roughly 100k? That is SUCH interesting and new information.
---
Yea, there's a lot of fearmongering going on around RuneLite+. To the extent I've seen people claiming it's closed source and, as you said, harvests user info.
---
I don't know where you are looking cause both the blog on the main site has the set effect under the stats you linked...
---
But wouldn’t you still have your virginity
---
Early game farming. Trees up to maple. Limpwurt roots. Cabbage, potato, onion. Red berries.
---
Same
---
73 ropes and chairs.
---
You can stop runecrafting anytime you feel like it. You just have to make the choice.
---
That sounds fucking sick
---
I’m new here but why is this a controversy? It’s new content. Don’t like the skill then don’t do it. Why take away something that others will like
---
Yea I hate training hunter because I it wasn't in the game when I played... doesn't mean its bad for the game.
---
Sandwich lady and Niece get Ash, I'm jealous as fuck
---
Don't y'all incels have a sub? Or were they all banned?
---
blast furnace is really good for a low level money maker. I'd def get the coal bag first though. expect to make 400-500k an hour making steel bars, and you also get smithing exp even though its not alot its still a decent amount.
---
Galaxy s5 so just at the minimum.
---
I would think it's just poor specs but it's specifically only when players are around vs npcs are fine
---
What the fuck did you just say about me you little bitch?
---

---
I was just going off of this tweet to be completely honest.  You seemed to indicate here that you generally don't see a need for a new skill in osrs.  If you've changed your view since then (or actually only agree with part of that tweet) that is fine but I've been going off of the most recent information available.
---
War-ding I-con 👍
---
Prayer pots scale with prayer level
---
Dunno mate, you’re telling me
---
It’s happening with me as well. Although not as common as Zezima, I have a very old original log in as well and they tend to lock me out for hours at a time.  As long as they have your log in whether it’s a original name or a email, they can lock you out by spamming passwords.
---
why fletch?
---
Lmao 👏
---
What about the 2 other comments that were posted 30 minutes ago and 3 hours ago saying they didn't read shit but voted yes? This guy is what's wrong with the game, but not them?
---
claw on 3 kc btw AMA
---
You're such a liar. NO WHERE in that post does it say ANYTHING about what they offered him.
---
I suck at pvm on mobile, so I just skill, you can do magic trees for beaver if you don't have or afk fish like monks.
---
It’s literally a drawing of what they plan on making the final product look like, is that not exactly what concept art is? It’s not going to look exactly like that once its finished.
---
Awesome man glad you are enjoying the game! One of the great things about membership is that there are way less bots so you’ll get to meet a lot more real people. I’d recommend sticking with questing as it will open up a lot of content for you down the road. A good quest to work towards conpleting is recipe for disaster. That will give u one of the best pairs of gloves in game (barrows gloves). There is soooo much members content so have fun with it!
---
not voting is also voting.
---
it just means ur turning off brain and let other people decide for you.
---
Nah we need water pvp. I want to shoot cannonballs to other players on my sick ass boat
---
It's only recognizable because you've been playing the game for so long. This icon introduces new items which will be iconic to the skill
---
Could be super broke and hoping for a miracle
---
You will need range gear for when you need to range and you can use the staff with both range and melee gear with no issues.  
---
There aren't any safe spots in the crypts and you will need to pray against the brothers. In the crypt, you can safe spot in some of the rooms against melee opponents
---
I'm not trying to convince them just making fun of them so they'll feel bad. duh.

It 100% CAN get you banned. It is macroing using 3rd party software. (your mouse's software) I'd avoid it.
---
"Average Joes" won't have that problem though..
---
I think you will find a great journey ahead of you.
---
Gear setup?
---
F2P barely scratches the surface my friend. I’m glad you’re having fun!
---
Ohhh I thought it was Mark
---
Lmao and this is better than warding? Ok
---
^s^u^h ^d^u^d^e
---
Add the Gowers
---
I think the brimhaven color is a bit too vivid but I suppose it’s the closest lol
---
Warding good warding bad 🗿
---
Why would you need ether for lessers?
---
It also doesn't spawn unless you have a certain number of tiles next to the dark beast that died because of it's size. If it spawns but there isn't room for it, it doesn't spawn iirc
---
If you can record your fights, watching them back makes it easier to identify mistakes or things you'd do differently. Also watching other people fight (streamers/YouTube) and paying attention to the specifics of their actions can show you some things you wouldn't have otherwise considered.
---
Beyond that, just go die a bunch until it clicks.
---
It's not slash, stab, and crush that affect it, it's accurate, aggressive, controlled, and defensive. Accurate trains attack, aggressive is strength, defensive is defense, and controlled is 1/3 xp in all 3.
---
Plus they are always aggressive so great for afking
---
Uwu
---
Wait FOR BONDS?  I WOULDA NEVER GUESSED!!!!
---
It’s because of people like you that we still have this problem.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Wise Old Man is the Tom Bombadil of Runescape
---
No... if you think that we need to be paying $11 a month for this game you need to wake up
---
Bruh moment
---
cant expect a virgin to know what sex is

The Wise Old Man in Swan Song part 2 where he tracks down the asshole who stole his penis

Poke in the background
---
Accounts with 1 letter names already sell for thousands. Now imagine zezima
---
Any time someone calls the sub out over the circlejerk the whole thing just turns into a living example of that "jokes on them I was only pretending" comic.
---
I belive this was called Artisan.
---
What was the zulrah helper all about?
---
Yeah, FOR BONDS! So why do you keep acting like I am suggesting that ironmen should be allowed to trade with other players?
---
I really, really like this image
---
A game vs the real world. 
---
You probably shouldnt be allowed to vote seeing as you're more stupid than a 5 year old kid.
---
It’s like a magnet, every woman just gets pulled closer when he is near
---
Is there a single skill that isn't boring to train? Inherently the meta of training is doing the most efficient thing until you either get the level you want or manage to get access to a more efficient method. Considering the time investment of skills, it's probably impossible to make a skill that isn't boring to train.
---
Quick vote yes sailing
---
Enjoying your time spent at your job.
---
Anyone have the og Gta one? one of my all time favs
---
It's fucking laughable that Jagex are talking about nerfs to the Bulwark and black d'hide in the name of bringing back the "good old days" of wilderness PvP, when shit like this exists.
---
&gt;You're not logging in or submitting a password reset request from Zezima's home IP address? Your attempts get dropped entirely.
---
Dynamic IP's have joined the chat.
---
Is that why they changed it? Interesting.
---
You're completely disconnected from reality. No one is able to get 1k totals in 7 hours game time. Get a brain.
---
where is mod ash in this picture?
---
And you really ARE a tard.
---
votin no on this comment mfer
---
GP/H scape is exactly why I started an ironman.
---
go vote nerd
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the White Knights, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Kharid, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in monkey madness warfare and I'm the top skulltricker in the entire World 2 pvp community. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Glenior, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the wilderness and your run energy is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bronze knife (p+++). Not only am I extensively trained in knife combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Penguin Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit unstrung willow longbows all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo
---
All runelite+ does is make free a feature clans were getting for a fee.
---
RL+ isn't at fault here for taking away a paid advantage

Don't forget granite body for diary too

Luckily for me I am big sex I put pennis in lots of women 😎

You really don't know business... Businesses *always* need to aim to grow.  When a business stagnates, consumers and investors lose confidence in the business.  Then the business slowly dies over time.  Stagnation is *not* surviving, it is simply the time before dying.  That's the simplest way to explain it.
---
It really is sad that this is the top comment on the post.  Someone who has never known a thing about business in their entire life with a comment that looks good to a bunch of other people who don't know anything about business either.
---
Real glad you're having fun dude. Good luck out there in the members world!
---
Regardless, you don't have a BIS glove slot that's worth 130k.
---
Maybe, but he still can't log into either one.
---
Yum!
---
mobile games even have customer support.
---
Ya he was saying that he's had 100s of people try and no one succeed before... Haha
---
Yeah when I restarted it they tried to have me go to rs3, but the nostalgia of osrs got me lol
---
Combats, slayer, mining (vmine), wildy prayer (with friends), black chins (can be with a friend). I enjoy skilling when I can do it in a meaningful way with friends.
---
during monkey madness two i had to reject nieve
---
she was crushed
---
warding is... intricate..? 
---
lol go away brainlet.
---
Breathtaking this is true art
---
Smooth brain post
---
yea slayer staff and rcb w broad bolts for skeletons and ahrim
---
The proof is in the pudding. I love that you can be open now fully Mat, cheers for the years of great leadership too!
---
BEST KOREA
---
Well seeing as they havent done it yet or even ever mentioned it the devs seem to think its a waste of time up to this point.
---
Did you care to finish reading my comment?
---
you're right, let's remove raids 1 and 2, kebos lowlands, and literally every update they've added thus far. that'll really spike those numbers up to get a victory Royale
---
Reminds me of a Hella long time ago some people made a server that was a first person shooter runescape server. It was crazy because you could see bugged out ceilings
---
I know but it was originally not going to be
---
Edit. The whole server was essentially only edgeville and the nearby wilderness area because of the modifications it took
---
Sweet samurai top homieeewe
---
crabs
---
lol my accounts almost at 15 year cape so i know alll about it.
---
Wow, I guess people really got to you today if you're posting this
---
Exactly. That's the most sensible and obvious view to take. Hence my jokey "hot take". Of *course* this game needs content to thrive and bring new players and keep existing. That's the same thing literally every game company knows, especially a subscription based MMO.
---
It's not hard to see that, all I was joking was that MatK wasn't sitting there saying "as an ex employee I have the scoop that if warding fails player numbers will plummet and the business side of Jagex will feel obligated to do MTX in some way shape or form to increase / maintain profits.
---
That's not how it works lol... website doesn't ask for auth, game does.
---
byw slayer staff auto casts crumble undead... kinda nice
---
I renamed my character to, "WARDING GOOD"
---
Insert I'm doing my part meme
---
Awesome response, thanks for taking your time to type all this up!
---
if people were leaving rs3 to play osrs, dont you think they'd want to avoid features similar to rs3?
---
