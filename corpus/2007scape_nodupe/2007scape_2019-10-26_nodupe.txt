King, I respect your opinion and I want you to keep displaying your thoughts into words on the internet. Even though many will disagree I will not, in fact I will stand with you, never give up King
---
Ok ok..

I just find it incredibly annoying when people come at me or get pissy for saying that it‚Äôs relatively easy to tank pkers.... when I‚Äôve been pking for 12+ years and when I was a teenager was one of the best hybrids in the game if that were at all quantifiable. People are bad and can‚Äôt tank with bulwark+d‚Äôhide and 99 defense when literally the shit is busted and unless you get 70 agsed you should never die tanking 3 levels. It‚Äôs really not that hard. There‚Äôs very little even a pker who is skilled and hitting you off prayer can do unless they‚Äôre literally in max/ancestral
---
Now if you get dscim tbed and ancestral focused that‚Äôs an entirely different ballgame and you better have 20 brews if you want a chance at making it out. But people who die with bulwark and d‚Äôhide tanking to 30 are just genuinely bad at the game, and they would be better off if they took responsibility for that and got better instead of hating pkers.
---
Holy crap these keep getting better and better.
---
Meh
---
Go SeaHawks go!
---
Whenever im not 100% sure about the count i hover my mouse over the food to tick eat if it turns out to be the opposite type. Also i def recommend playing with game sounds it helps me keep track much better since the two attacks have very distinctive noises.
---
This hits home.

Are you having a stroke

I‚Äôm with you these are not funny

I have the requirements for every single Sherlock challenge except one, mine runite ore in full prospector. Have 76 mining. 25 ish possible skill challenges, I get the single one I can't do
---
Right side should just be "lol sit"

Yes, pin was set so damage was less than I thought. When I made the post I was still waiting on my recovery to go through (which it did successfully). Fortunately they only got what was equipped (which was raids alt gear, rapier torture dwh prims berserker). My fault for not banking it, w/e more worried about HOW I got hacked than losing a little gold tho.
---
No, I haven't clicked any phishing links. No sponsored links on reddit, don't even allow links in my stream chat of any kind, if people post a screenshot link in discord I either look at the preview on discord or ignore it if there's no preview. It's one of my biggest fears since starting streaming that I'd click a funky link of some kind so since I've started streaming (~ 2 months ago) I've been paranoid level careful.
---
Also, if it was something on my computer leaking information... Why would they hack my alt and not my main for one, and how would they get past the 2FA? One look at my setup on the alt and you can tell it's an alt (I mean, who does raids with rapier and prossy with no range/mage gear) and that the main probably has bank (Again... Rapier + infernal + avernic on alt? Main's probably stacked). That's what's causing me the most confusion... My main is probably less secure since the associated e-mail is my main e-mail (Tho I still use unique passwords for e-mail/rs unused anywhere else online, and email/rs password are different), yet my alt with less gear is the one that got hacked. It just has me stumped.

wow, this made me cry. not sure what else to say. guess I'll level farming

thats a typical fat cat excuse to implement MTX. Dont listen to that shit, or anything the greedy suits utter. This game, and thousands of others, survived and evolved heavily with membership
---
I did ZMI from level 1 when I first started OSRS, and I gotta say it's pretty hilarious getting 250 exp per trip. You get 2 levels per trip until you get to level 12+, when it slows down to a measly 1 level per trip. People say early game RC is bad, but I have no idea why. It's as if these people don't know you can do ZMI from level 1 for 18k xp/hr (which is enough to go from 1-33 in an hour). Even taking the safe route and not using the teleport is decent xp overall, and getting a level per trip is probably the most satisfying thing I've done in RS.

I felt obligated you know. they all took time out of there day to come and help you know.

Tutorial island even has a huge wall break when they talk about your ‚Äúaccount‚Äù. Also, talk to the bartender at the Blue Moon Inn in varrock and ask him for tips, then play dumb for a funny dialogue

Depends on the task, of course, but I was able to do the Fight Pit task with help from them.

Very true.  Max login attempts is a very simple solution against brute forcing.  With max login attempts enabled, 7 or so characters is plenty, regardless of caps sensitivity.

In this analogy, the trolls already ate you and fucked the skullhole mate.

Get off this subreddit. Beg somewhere else.

Fuck off youll just give your info away again and be back. Secure your account and go earn it.
---
In the USA entry level wages at established companies are horrible.  Most people do those jobs for a few years (resume builder), then try to get on with an indie company for way more money.    
---
The only people making big bucks at these established gaming companies are the experienced people in higher positions.  Probably mod Ash, guys like that.
---
I did secure my account and I never gave my info away I went from combat lvl 3 to 88 in two weeks why would I do so and I don‚Äôt need you negativity if your not going to help simply bypass the post!!!! WTF!!!!!

Thanks, King.

So one post here is beggin?

The  polling system is great.  It really is ...how many other games have that?

But the fact that there is literally no way to contact customer service for support can not be ignored.

ahhhh i know im such a scrub i dont have fighter or fire cape yet :(

as a kid i didnt even know those things existed haha. Fighter im annoyed with leavers and needa get to, but fc i have no idea where to start tbh

What‚Äôs the secret then!!! Give me the RNG pot.

Do some research on how to make sure your account is totally secure - I actually just made a post about the subject, go to my profile and scroll down till you see it

Lv 99 cooking?
---
An automated system is not a real support line.  These 2 guys have to hope they get their accounts restored, without ever being able to actually talk to Jagex.    
---
Including one of our mods in a maxed CC.  That will not sit well with the hundreds of players in the CC if he doesnt get his account back.

That's why making wrath tiaras is the best way to train RC.

That said, I must inquire whether you agree that simply giving away your loot does not help your brother, as much as it doesn't teach him the value of obtaining his own things through discipline?

Is it really? I never had any interest in them, but i got it on one of my first few kills way back and just ge dumped it.

Ah yes, the post raid spit trade :)

Sorry, I don't do drugs
---
OSRS is full of these references and fourth wall breaks.
---
yea dude acted all high and mighty like she was nuts but in all reality hes a PoS
---
I feel ya, mainly just a rant of my rage.. same comments and story every time and I get downvoted every time.. same noobs that die to me without switching a single prayer. Meanwhile if I‚Äôm pking revs I don‚Äôt even get on a bulwark unless I have 4+ people because if he has any idea how to tank and 90+ defense it‚Äôs a complete waste of time. I‚Äôve had maxes mains tank full tbs against me in d‚Äôhide and bulwark. 
---
As I said before, 85-105 mage bonus mystics against d‚Äôhide is pretty useless, sure there‚Äôs kill potential, but me personally I just would never die to these people unless I get dscim tbed or if they pj and tb me when I‚Äôm out. 
---
The point of my rambling is that you don‚Äôt have to be butthurt and downvote pkers because you don‚Äôt like pkers, put your time in and experience it from the other side and your frustrations will be gone.

You know you can marry people because you want to, right?  It's a free country.

Really they're both childish
---
If you go for 70 herblore and 70 woodcutting you'll have the requirements for Song of the Elves, which opens up some more content for you. Another thing you can consider is spending most of your cash stack to get 83 construction and then building an ornate pool + jewelry box, which is a fantastic QoL upgrade. Apart from that your bank looks good and I'd just use the money to help fund efficient slayer (cannonballs/prayer pots/etc) to get your combat stats up, as 80/80 range/magic is a weird spot where you're starting to outgrow mid-game moneymakers like Barrows but aren't quite strong enough to consistently do stuff like Zulrah/Vorkath yet.

runescape works best as a low-fantasy medieval parody with trademark early Jagex humor, instead of a serious high-fantasy game that's chock full of cliches.

See you all therr

I feel bad for the amount of times my friend killed you there lol gz

You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend!

Im surprised you're not mining.

I'm sorry that trying to figure out how I got hacked when being paranoid level careful pisses you off so much? Not sure where this anger is coming from dude, just wanna know wtf happened so it doesn't happen again.

Humble brag

What the unholy fuck

that would be cool too

hey  i did it after like a hour i can back and it said some of my rewards went to some guy with a d name and i dont know where to get those rewards do you where this guy is. (sorry im like soooooooo new

Your mom sounds like a woman with many capes. 
---
The part where she worked her ass off to get you everything you wanted in game because she couldn't get you everything in real life is truly touching. 
---
I'm sure because of this experience and the type of mother she was, you turned into a fine young man with plenty of ambition. You clearly know how to write exceptionally well.
---
Why would swapping be against the rules? Every streamer who streamed Deadman mode live from jagex hq swapped or had donations from ppl swapping
---
Another vote for slayer staff. I always use it on mobile. As soon as I know next attack is freeze I equip staff and have sutocast activated before spider is spawned.
---
Will look better in the dark with a candle
---
I agree with you, the +7 boost wasn't necessary because like you said, no incentive to cut anywhere else.(of course teaks are best xp but still). Having all those trees near a bank was good enough.
---
More art is always appreciated.
---
Oh shit bro thanks

It's a boring task and a bit slow but a 30m drop makes it worth it for some

Having gone on a more than 130 dry streak myself at Barrows, the advice I give you is focus on that Morytania hard dairy and doing your runs as fast and cost effective as possible and even without items you will still be making a decent amount of cash per hour (read you will care less about not getting any armour pieces)

I did some simple dynamic programming to come to the conclusion that there are 20942443932701822784334603586896616025276741 (2*10^43) possible combinations of levels that have 1154 total level, and this value is maximal. Sloppy code (note that total levels are reduced by 32 because that is the base total level): https://pastebin.com/ikcfNykb
---
It is obvious that this is a lower bound; no account can hit 1154 total level twice. 
---
I believe, but have not proven, that this is the correct answer. It is sufficient to show that there is a bijection between the stat distributions of 1154 total level and those of 1155 total level, such that two distributions can only be mapped together if one can be reached from the other by a single level up. However, this remains to be shown.
---
I'll sleep on it and see if I think of a better solution.

Paying to raid is really a bad deal. You are giving the other raiders a decent boost in points = more gp/h and more chance of a purple for them. People want to have an alt scale up their raid but not take any of the combat points. You should try a diff cc.
---
I‚Äôm glad to have read about your connection with your mom via a game. Thank you for sharing.

---
Yes
---
The RNG is not a lie as I stated in my comment, im under 10k rolls, but have 4 daxes that are 1 in 10k, and 6 pets which are 1 in 5k's. Thats well above whats to be expected. Guessing reading is not your strong suit though and that's probably why you think you got "crashed"

you know what they say, if the community wants it!

You have way more than a second to tell. When he lifts up of the bottoms of his feet are facing forward pray range. If they face the ground pray mage. You have way more time to tell what's what.

This is the most amazing post, thank you OP :) I will farm so hard on Nov. 2nd for you and your mother!

cosmic tallies are not hard to come by

I Love yours vids bro.
---
Battlestaves have buy limits of 18000, just a correction
---
So people let me in on their raid
---
Nice one dude
---
I'll go check
---
Its true that I am giving them a point boost but every raid I have been on the people in the raid already own alts they can scale with themselves
---
Question were can I find them and follow them seems interesting to watch them
---
Yea maybe not everyone but just let them know you are an iron man before the raid. There is also entire sections of the discord dedicated to fifa's and iron man raids. You just need to manually type in your raid kc and all the other info to get started. Very simple. All of my raids are done through wdr discord

Well said. Glad the upvotes reflect the post.

I think you can still stand in the one tile gap in the cage and avoid damage?
---
Nah theres 1 tile left open you click it and youll avoid it. Or just click anywhere outside the square and you should run to it automatically
---
you have alot to learn how formula's work.
---
Lol good joke
---
BEAST! Tank god.
---
Dispute the charges
---
I'm aware, I'm used to doing guardians. But the issue is that the tile left open was literally up against the wall, I was clicking outside of the cage and my character physically could not get through.
---
That's pathetic ngl.
---
Really? I'll try that out if that ever happens again
---
1,5k dry :) help pls

So long as I got my own take on the joke I don't care. If at least one person gets a laugh out of it I'll be happy.

Samsung s7, 5.1"
---
Standard as far as I know. Don't be afraid to play around with runelite options there's loads of options that aren't always auto on, like rearranging  your prayers, extending your max camera zoom, making the sky blue instead of black.
---
we were so close to having all that stack up to 5.
---
So good
---
Oh fair enough
---
Please keep these going!!!!
---
I've gotten 3 items so far at a 1/50 rate. I'd take 1/25 in a heartbeat.

Did not think about it that way at all lol and i didn it and avoided mahoganies for a long time lol never thought twice about protection/ultracompost only for herbs

Ah so it's an "eww girl streamer favoritism" thing.. Idk its kinda cute and doesn't hurt anyone and adds a little flavor to the game, but again osrs are some of the most entitled bunch I have ever seen..

It's the well chiselled jawline that gave this one away

I also thought that but haven't found any evidence of it. However it would give a resale price on buying a bond, even if the money only goes to charity.

Well said. You will miss nothing.

It's not a runelite thing it's on the official client. Back before the GE came out people got fed up of competing with auto spammers so Jagex just made it legal by adding their own option for it. You can only see the spam when you have it enabled though so other people don't see it.

if you're looking for the most afk, dfs is better. most (all?) people use dfs on their rune drag alts
---
if you just want dps, defender and str bonus armor is better. the reason people use dfs/justiciar/fury is to make it more afk

Any iron donation should be 3x the value

---
Usually if a payment failed, most likely it's because you don't have enough money on the card. But there are a bunch of other reasons that are less common that can make a payment fail that your bank / credit card issuer is responsible for. If you see that the money was deducted from your Visa account, but Jagex is sending you "failed payment" messages, it's time to call your bank / credit card issuer and see what's going on.
---
I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it, but its still a weird/unprofessional thing to do from a jmods perspective. 
---
Sure, have a duck that follows nearby people around. Its cute, and sort of realistic even. No need to personalise it after a streamer/friend.
---
Yeah that's a good point lmao, geezer here just sounds like a twat :)
---
If the payment failed and they took money that usually means that the money is reserved by your bank as a ongoing transaction. you will usually get it back in a couple of days(when the bank decides that the transaction failed). i know that i can see my reserved transaction on my bank app, check there maybe.
---
I appreciate it. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt.  Do it just for fun. I recently created an Instagram if you want to see more. Same name: normal_neighbor.

I don‚Äôt have membership for my farm runs, and money‚Äôs a little tight right now. I would love to go though OP.

Yes, but they're now old and have basically done the main part of their life, whereas you were in the most important formative period of yours.

---
Awesome work my guy. Great shading, really fun style. I'm very much enjoying it. It's really nice to just slowly gaze over and take in all the tiny details. Thank you for sharing!
---
Haha, thank you! No drugs though. Most of my drawings just get weird.
---
Dramen no, Lunar yes
---
what is it?
---
I want 2008 graphics so bad!:(
---
Cape of skulls
---
Fuck anyone who had a negative response to this beautiful addition to the game. Eat shit and die!
---
&gt;OSRS is in a unique position where preserving the game as a piece of art is actually relevant. It's important to be careful about what is changed, especially in classic areas because it meant to much to so many people, that's one of the main draws of the game.
---
Legit equating OSRS to Van Gogh. Imagine that.
---
Honestly sad how they changed to this auto renew predatory crap. I just instantly cancel membership after subscribing now so I don't forget.

Haha, thanks. It made me laugh a little when it came to my mind.
---
How surprising, she used to be on our clan leaders dicks back on the day as well to get benefits here and there.
---
I don't have a problem with that either. Hell, I never would have noticed and so would 99% of the players. If I was a Jmod I too would model a quest npc or something after someone important for me, like my best friend, grandma or something. Then I probably shouldn't tell that the community though... I don't get the outrage. I mean I understand how you think it shouldn't be done, but actually outraging and writing negative messages to mods? Na, not important enough.
---
That's an awesome drawing! Use of colors is cool.
---
It's the lack of inferno m8
---
I miss aggressive random events.
---
I remember the first time I was able to actually kill a fairly high level one when I was in the fishing guild (or maybe I was mining coal, lol). Definitely one of my fondest memories.
---
Suck my duck dick*
---
&gt; weird/unprofessional thing
---
Jagex has always been a little silly. Part of why I like so many jmods is that they don't have a stick in their arse, have fun and can act childish sometimes. Just look at how some mods embrace and are involved in the memes...
---
Has efficiency scape gone too far
---
So how does this have an impact on integrity?
---
Same!

Farming is my favorite skill and I‚Äôm level 110 now but I haven‚Äôt played in a couple months and prior to that wasn‚Äôt farming as much as I used to because the damned pet refuses to drop, but you bet that I am buying a bond and logging in to do a run for her.
---
Long bone is 1/400 chance from any monster that drops big bones, curved is 1/5000
---
Playing devils advocate here, but couldn‚Äôt you also argue that this is the BIS helm outside of slayer. Whereas the BIS inside of slayer is locked behind a 58 slayer req and similar quest line?
---
This is a prime example of what we young germans call "most german thing ever". In a negative way. I imagine old grumpy people being overly pedantic and always looking for something minor to complain about and then make trouble until they get what they want. I always had a feeling r/2007scape consisted of old grumpy "almans"...
---
Silly maxer, you need to offer 10gp.
---
I still contend the Serp is BIS - Venom, Defence, and +5 str vs a +1 str. A pretty rune helm is not BIS to me.
---
Slayer most definitely is a skill you can make faster. It is just a lot of effort. Alts can greatly increase xp/hr. However don‚Äôt expect to start getting faster consistent rates until 80+. Once smoke devils are unlocked ehp for slayer is 60k/hr which doesn‚Äôt even include the use of alts. 
---
Ehp at 1m xp is only 25k/hr. This jumps to 50k/hr at level 80.
---
\*\*on an ironman\*\* is barrows worth doing if I have only completed morytania easy? 
---
It'll be a long time until I get the requirements. What would you do? Hold off and get the legs 3, or is it not too bad without them?
---
How‚Äôs Disney? Always curious of people‚Äôs opinions as an Orlandoinian.
---
I dont understand why he emptied the potion?
---
Thank you for your reply. Yeah, I don't *need* the poison dagger, but I want a good spec weapon.
---
He has 99 range. Can‚Äôt be 42 combat lol
---
My bad.
---
Ok edgy
---
This is adorable and I'm so genuinely touched to hear this.
---
I think it would be honorable to have a farming NPC doing runs with your mom's account name, just to motivate other players to train their farming.
---
Just a friendly NPC like "Max" on RS3 that walks around randomly at farming patches and gives advice.
---
So cancel the auto renew the moment you buy membership then. This is on you for leaving it. Everyone knows that auto renew is on by default for everything.
---
Sorry, I'm in the middle of questing rn and all I have is this warm redberry pie
---
To be fair, there was always going to be a slayer master there, just slapped on the name "nieve".
---
As opposed to a completely new entity made solely for/about this person.
---
Why would I spend cash for something that's free?
---
And this is the kinda shit that makes me hate zulrah. 500 kills since I‚Äôve seen fucking anything.
---
Show me them feet girl
---
Saw a kid in this outfit last night at the Tapp Room Bar if this is the same guy.
---
You don't have to pay to regain your gear at zulrah! it's free
---
Do you want the cape faster or gp?
---
why is empty even an option

It's pretty fucking awesome even as an adult. At the new star wars place and I as a person don't really have a problem with lines I seem to have infinite patience when it comes to people not in my family. I definitely do feel that universal and Disney need more roller coasters because that's what I love as a person. Same with more water parks but other than that Disney world is way better than Disneyland and I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.
---
smh you can only buy girlfriends bro
---
One time my brother and I crashed a dude wearing full cow costume at lumby cows with 2 cannons... ahhh the memories
---
Not op but I‚Äôve been multiple times in my life. Last time was like 2 years ago. I enjoy going but typically there‚Äôs too many people for my liking. If they had a cheaper ticket that was just for walking around viewing the awesome architecture, using the shops, and seeing the shows, I would buy that instead. I‚Äôm not huge on rides and not a fan of roller coasters.  I love just walking through and thinking of all the people who have had magical experiences there over the years and how the parks have impacted the community and the world. It‚Äôs quite a site and just makes me smile every time I‚Äôm at any of the Disney stuff.
---
both, gp for next 99
---
I‚Äôd like to know as well
---
You‚Äôre in multi all the time and there‚Äôs millions of lvl 33 zombies I don‚Äôt think those stats would really matter
---
Yeah but his reason for firemaking was cooking
---
Madddd cute

Are you seriously telling me that using periods is overly formal lmfao
---
Oziach will make you a dfs for 1m if you don't have the smith level, personal experience cause I was gutted till a clan member told me üòÇ I'm not sure if he does the other 2 visages, as I've never received one. I would have thought he would do though.
---
Deviants are shit. More def, more hp, shitter loot, longer tasks.
---
Jagex told runelite to remove all the plugins they have an issue with, and runelite did. That may change with the upcoming post on the matter though.
---
Nice, with the D pick too! Grats man

True.. I should start reading more carefully.

Well.. good luck on the lifetime of shrimp you'll be eating.

The same can be said of features which might modify how you select actions in the game or change how you click on menus, players, or NPCs, especially where the feature leads to you using fewer clicks than you would when using our client.    That‚Äôs exactly what it says

Repeeeeeeeeeeeeent

Step 1: mime a inventory of rune was at the rune was mine.

Step 2: walk to fally and outside the city gates you can find the air altar, use your air talisman from rune mystery quest

Step 3: go back to varrock realize that you will never get a decent level at this skill and find another way to obtain runes
---
rip brother

Yeah ok Anakin Skywalker

Guys you have 99 in every stats by default!
---
At your stats, guthans would  be a waste of time. If you pray correctly throughout the caves, you'll get to Jad with enough supplies that you'll have plenty leftover to outeat any damage the healers might do to you, and the only wya you'll die is if you mess up and Jad one shots you. You've already got most of the gear that I would suggest (God dhide boots and top, blowpipe, Veracs skirt, and Archers ring), kid just buy a Veracs helm, and a handful of chinchompas for the healers (like 10-20 to be safe). Inventory I'd probably have 4 ranging potions, 9-12 Sara brews, your chins, and the rest super restores. 
---
A couple important tips for during the caves: the spot where the blob spawns on wave 3, is where Jad will spawn. The orange mager in the wave just before Jad also spawns there, so I would suggest killing that one last, so you can already see Jad when his wave starts.
---
Once Jad spawns, what you need to remember is to just do one thing at a time. Change your prayer, attack Jad, wait for him to attack again. Make sure that prayer is right, and then drink any potion you might need to. Using F keys to switch between your inventory and prayer book is very helpful. When the healers show up, switch to you chins and tag **one** healer, then wait for the next Jad attack to tag another one. They should be close enough to each other that it only takes a couple to get them all aggroed, at which point you switch back to your blowpipe and start attacking Jad again.
---
Yep i've had the same experience. Legitimately had 3 pages for EVERY book before finally completing one.
---
Nmz afk question: all guides recommend having 5 npcs. One of the npcs is tree spirit and she does much damage. I dont clear npcs fast enough. 
---
Can I remove tree spirit and go with 4 npcs? Or is 5 a must? Magic shortbow i, elite void, rune arrows, ava assembler , and all quests done.
---
For however many million gp is thrown in the well Jagex donates real money to charity. Forget the ratio of gp to real money, but it's a nice goldsink that actually helps out people in need.
---
HP, Defense, Strength.
---
When they finally take me I want to be the most pain in the ass zombie ever for all the people who chose skills like woodcutting, firemaking, construction or thieving.
---
It won't necessarily "crash" but it will most likely stabilize sub 10mil. Every item slowly lowers in value over time as more come into the game. Just look at the DWH price. 
---
Although the drop rate being reduced on a Slayer task will most likely slow the price deflation down a fair bit.
---
So what is bannable isn't exactly/specifically stated which plugins only the situation upon which one is eligible for a ban.  
---
Might aswell just continue using osrs native however tedious it may be. Depressing. Wish Osrs could spare time to update their client. Not asking for much just the ones where it could improve gameplay experience.
---
Hey i have a question, when i completed rune mysteries i was lvl2, by that time i was really new and don't remember how i did it, could someone explain?
---
Haha unreal.. i had dialup internet in 2004... mums all like "i need to make a phone call!! turn that internet off!!"
---
Goddamnit, just trying to powermine iron im level 84!! :(
---
What the fuck is up with his jaw?
---
So how are you taking damage then? You should rock cake down to 1 hp, and the max hit they can do on you is 1 if you're using absorptions
---
Yeah
---
Are you using Runelite, Osbuddy, vanilla client or what? Are you using GPU?
---
Lmaoo almost 75 farming and im learning this just now. Thanks dude!
---
How did u get d pick? Gz
---
Rs2 pre summoning was basically 2007scape minus wilderness
---
Took me 4. Got to Jad everytime.
---
1st attempt I died in .5 seconds
---
2nd attempt I died as the healers arrived
---
3rd attempt I died from a premature celebration I did as jad died and missed the last switch
---
And did it on my 4th
---
F
---
Don‚Äôt do that contact jagex first they can ban you if you do a chargeback
---
BUT WE STILL HAVE THAT FUCKING DOG
---
I am afking there, So I check back every 15-20minutes. The tree spirit can take 10-11 hp from by absorption potions which I feel like is alot.
---
Lol I'm just talking about putting a string to the power core in this picture so that the power core kinda has the same appearance as the salve (ei)

Can I have 92 in 6 skills instead

I'm currently using RL, but I tried it on OSB to see if I would get different results. Still the same. Yes I'm using GPU.

YAHOO!

I mean 92 is only halfway there...
---
yeah fam shits not rare when you afk for 600 hours
---
!
---
Great meme lmao
---
Bro rs2 before summoning after they killed wildy and free trade was trash wtf are you talking about lol. Sure BoB was op and a few other familiars but it along with the HD update and several minigames (FOG, SW, and SC) literally saved the game from the wildy/trade ordeal. Rs2 died with double xp weekends, power creep from chaotics/dungeoneering, and was given the death penalty by EOC.
---
At this day, something like planting trees per x amount of gp would tickle my balls enuff to dump some gp in it
---
GPU can crash it, mine crashes immediately with it open and my comps pretty good.  No solution on google or reddit. Disable that and try again.

What level and where for bridge PKing? And are there servers for edge PKing still?
---
What was her username
---
Im pretty sure it doesnt let you in without a minimum of 5. You get more points per kill with more bosses, but take more damage so 5 is the best when youre only worried about xp. 
---
The bosses that are typically recommended are so because they have little to no defense, thus increasing xp/hour. 
---
I dont see sand snake recommended a lot (probably due to its hp) but thats a nice low level boss with 0 def as well. Trapped soul is another one. 
---
I use count draynor, sand snake, king roald, me, and tree spirit personally. 
---
If none of that helps you could try looking at the boss‚Äôs stats and pick one with more def but less att/str and just try to avoid attacking that one. 
---
Goodluck!

Also I'm sure 99 HP will protect me from the eventual botulism from shady canned food.

ye it's pretty rare for it to actually be someone who really was using the world too. most people will quickly figure out that it's a very popular and high volume location so they have no real right to it if they leave. if they are noobs that bank they will just bank really fast to try and get back which also severely lowers the chance someone is gonna get there and set up. and if it does manage to happen its going to be really obvious due to how fast they'll be running back saying that after you got set up doing your task.
---
the secret to crashing well is just chuck a trade when you hop into a full world if it's busy. it'll tell you if you find an ironman and we call that free real estate. or if you want to be a dick and crash someone or you are being crashed the key is to start barraging individual mobs when they spawn in and continually doing this to keep them spread and impossible to stack up (run around refreezing them on a staggered time to keep them spread apart) make it as aids as humanly possible. realistically anyone who tries the "bro i was just here hop bro" has a very low power level when it comes to crashing and is absolutely free. people try it all the time to be slick and its a very low energy and low success rate maneuver.

Damn bro Gratzzz!!! I know how long it took me to get firecape on my mobile only account. Keep doing good man.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure mechanics are in favor of this. The more people on one tree or one fishing spot, the longer it lasts. It‚Äôs not time based or rng upon tree spawning. Think of barb fishing why everyone stacks one pool.

---
To add to this, can you roll pet when venerating the dense ess at the dark altar? It‚Äôs much less xp than actually crafting, but it is still some xp so idk if you can get the pet, and at that time your inventory will be full.
---
You are wrong, they said as much on the mythbuster stream. Every tree thereoretically has a chance to never deplete, ever (albeit the chances are of course bloody low to say the least) and every time somebody swings their axe, that tree grows ever closer to being depleted. Thus more people swinging = more chance it will deplete. And as the other person said, fishing spots are time based.

Try hard is different from fashionscape

Back in a time before Grand Exchange, rune items did not drop from literally everything and high level Smiths could make insane money from kiteshields which were not available in any shops.
---
You could even sell an addy scim for 10k in those days.
---
Pretty much the same boat. Felt kind of bad maxing after SOF though :( felt like cheating. Doing the iron man thing now and it's a blast.
---
I think you have to actually create runes to have a chance to roll the pet. In the same way you can‚Äôt get the pet from lamping a skill. Don‚Äôt have a source for this though
---
I wish there were a clue scroll reward that let you store you pets in and it randomly chooses which one is out for you.

---
That surprised me a bit too. But I believe most the rewards were close, so it isn't that unlikely there were just more reasons against the robes. There were some players who didn't want any main game rewards from leagues. There were others who might prefer upgrades to items to come from more relevant content (e.g. olm slayer helm and ancestral recolor from challenge raids for example).
---
But those would apply to more than just the robes. However, unlike the Slayer Helm and POH which already have existing recolors, the Ancestral Recolor was a new thing so there was probably some opposition to the first recolor being from leagues. And others might just dislike recoloring gear in general, especially BiS Armors, so since this would be the first Ancestral Recolor that might have been seen are more of an issue to them then the Slayer Helm or such.
---
I was at KQ one day for 4 hours straight on the same world completely undisturbed then some dude walked in and told me to hop and that he was here first. My bank trips never took longer than 2 minutes to get back to the boss room. Just hilarious.

I read this like you were saying to change where it teleports, and I was hella confused reading that sentence

It's not likely to, it's basically the same as playing with an xbox controller with more steps, and that's been allowed.  The inputs all map 1:1.
---
nope, just to change the animation, because right now it's pretty basic
---
I took a break from slayer at 89 recently and caught up on some diaries and quests. I camped Vorkath for just under 400 kills with a dhcb and it got pretty boring. I sold the crossbow yesterday and got all my slayer gear back and am enjoying the game a lot more again. Just do what you enjoy, don't worry too much about xp gains or levels or anything.
---
"Time to max the alt I guess"
---
If you aren't using a cannon on a cannon task in a cannon area you are a problem as well
---
It doesn't revive red dragons people will just get the hides from vorkath
---
Last I checked, you can't cabbage emote in f2p. Did that change?
---
jeez idk why u guys are so salty i though it was just funny...
---
Damn that's atleast 300 iq
---
Yeah I could have but I don‚Äôt care enough to do that, just a quick PSA
---
You gave up your spot when you banked. Just as you likely took someone else's when you first showed up. Welcome to a popular MMORPG.
---
I'm pretty sure it's the way it's supposed to be

Imagine caring enough about an unpolled duck that was added into a medieval children's game to actually complain about it.

This too LOL
---
How much Gp/hour is Zalcano at 75 mining?
---
We're talking about one single task here as shown in the picture.. I can read just fine, you're just being dumb :l Not sure where dps came into this as it's 100% irrelevant. Literally all I'm saying is stopping what you're doing to do something else decreases xp/hr. Your personal preference and what you pay attention to doesn't matter, so I don't see why you're bringing it up lol.
---
alright, nvm. collecting all your own materials would be an unbearable grind. gratz.
---
the journey to max is not fun at all, it's legit fucking boring and ridiculous. I'm glad I'm maxed now and can just do whatever the fuck I enjoy, such as raiding.
---
rc, magic, and prayer
---
This one goes either way imo. Decent people will hop if asked nicely for KQ or thermy.
---
Augury is 77. Rigour is 74/75
---
It's becuz the only ppl left doing this was bots so they just added it to the store
---
That‚Äôs a falador guard
---
&gt; RNG plays a massive part too, 
---
rng matters short term, not long term
---
&gt;Then on top of that a lot of people drop 10mil a month on bonds which chews into profit a ton as well.
---
on avg raids are like 3-4m an hour for mediocre team split raids, solos push 5 or 6, idk current prices.
---
&gt;Some people on this subreddit drastically undersell what goes into making 1bil gp. I think I'm far more likely to get an infernal cape using an ACB long before I even come close to having 1bil
---
well yeah, when youve spent 50 hours on raids and have one drop and thats all...
---
Lol has anyone actually been banned since their updated stance ?
---
Holy shit. YES. My PC was also so crap that I would have to lower the quality of the advertisement playing and stop the loop. Then my fps would return.
---
did u have brews? only 70 herb on my IM
---
you must have been losing your shit drawing this hahah.
---
hilarious
---
steal his look
---
whats the point of this post? You do 40min regular raids thats even more pathetic than teh way he mines.
---
I haven't played in a while and with the recent update on 3rd party clients I'm not sure if it's still safe. Can I just disable the bannable features and be fine?
---
Really don't wanna use the Jagex client, but I also don't wanna get banned. 
---
Thanks in advance!

The worst thing is dying as Zulrah dies. I'm on like 1950 kc and still hunting for pet/muta. I think i lost a fang once but thankfully i've never seen pet/muta drop on death. I'd probably cry.
---
Enjoy the journey
---
ye just let the guy play however he wants, could also say you're raiding wrong lmao
---
I was jk
---
naw
---
Yes, you can do that. As long as you aren't using features that are bannable, you're fine
---
Same. Like why even try to clean your inventory if it wastes 10k.
---
About 1 mil-ish
---
Most people that play use the Runelite client. No ones getting banned for menu entry swapper and they removed the Demonic Gorilla plug in as per what Jamflex wanted removed.
---
It really depends your mindset and how you play the game. If you're purely playing for the sake of getting the cape then yeah I can see why it's not fun at all. It took me 5 years to get max cape on my main and never really ''focused'' on getting it till I was like 2100+ total already.
---
Id say 90%
---
Going to be honest, 8 year old me did this. I would take guys money and log off, never to see my ‚Äúbf‚Äù again.
---
My 8 year old self was a con woman..
---
Actually a brilliant suggestion until you think about how some doofus will exploit this by making 1000 alternate nonmember accounts and use them to train runecrafting on his main by purposely ignoring the genie event
---
Thanks everyone!! I'll make sure to take your notes and draw more. Osrs stuff is very fun to draw :)
---
Did she taste the vengeance though
---
13 attempts gradually over time. I started when I was way under leveled :)
---
Wowee
---
New update posts that
---
fair enough i deleted my comment
---
I agree, when imps walk on water they're satirizing Jesus, get religious references out of our video games. Literally unplayable.
---
You would die IMMEDIATELY if you don't use the shield. Elvarg's fire can hit 65 without a shield, and it'll still hit 13 if you have it.
---
Those stats are going to be tough to beat Elvarg outright, but flinching is an easy way to take 0 damage. It's a method where you hit --&gt; run away --&gt; wait --&gt; hit --&gt; run away... It's quite simple, but I would suggest looking up a guide
---
Fishing, cooking, firemaking. Ez
---
Didn‚Äôt censor killcount? Gg account
---
STONKS
---
What?
---
1 of those is 3rd age but which 1
---
IIRC, there used to be one.
---
&gt; Those spectres are the same task as you cant just divide them because you want to
---
I can divide them because, by not being the same monster, they are inherently different to aberrants. They count for the task, but should not be done because they're fucking awful.
---
that would be the new meta for training slayer on a lvl 3, or runecrafting ofcourse.
---
1/10M from master clue mimic rolls only. Support
---
That makes MM2 way funnier
---
Leave the range ring. Take only 3 pray pots. And use slayer helm if on task.
---
Agreed. Streamers don't deserve different treatment.
---
Anytime, congrats on the drop!
---
It‚Äôs cheaper to use than a Blowpipe with dragon darts and extremely comparable to BP with rune - if you use blowpipe your can most likely afford scythe
---
Eyeball McCatstaff.
---
ya fair enough, my sole reason I maxed is because I want my stats to look the same level, always had all stats 70/80 and max combats, but then I just decided to get it 99 and be done with it.
---
Thank you for your help. Is it really that insignificant? I saw guides on youtube with people switching cape slot and boots as well, but since that was too much for me and I can't afford ranger boots I thought I'd at least bring the archers ring
---
O7
---
Gj without a blowpipe, whats the story behind the prayer lvl?
---
maybe? who really knows, it hasn't been fully open source for awhile now.
---
nnnnnnnnn
---
You are a good boy üòä
---
Thats literally all 3rd age
---
Lol I‚Äôve done this when I‚Äôve gotten potion drops from monsters before
---
Don't remind me. I already know I'll drop the game the moment I max and everything in game becomes pointless. I still need runescape to fill the void.
---
There are so many skills you instantly drop the moment you don't have to train them for some goal.
---
Got given gp by a friend when I started and spent the first weeks just doing prayer at gilded alter with him
---
Subtle flex right there, grats man!
---
arclight should be the priority  
---

A Chad who used his mom's credit card. Man doesnt even have barrows gloves or nezzy

I'll be doing them throughout the day and will just ask everyone farming if they're from this thread!
---
two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.
---
The Knight's Sword
---
Hopefully not this guy because this could be a real post.
---
Need to buff the drop rated of the scrolls imo
---
plus just visit a freaking armorsmith until you hit like adamant items for shields and rune items for rest? lol
---
Arclight or tentacle whip instead of whip.
---
Getting a black demons task and using a Slayer helm is almost mandatory.
---
Are you praying Piety and Rigour (or Eagle eye)?
---
If you're running out of food instead of pots with that inventory you need more practice with prayer switching. You should be protecting hits 2 and 3 from every combat style already, but you can predict the 1st hit being melee or not if the gorilla walks up to you when it switches attack style. So you should only get hit by their 1st attack after a melee attack 50% of the time, or their 1st attack against you 66% of the time.
---
Sand crabs are pretty good.
---
Unironically I think people would automate it and have xp lamp farming bots.
---
Just salty cause he can't win it. Thats awesome man, congrats!
---
Lmao then you obviously don't train slayer very much. I burn 10k cballs in a day.
---
Tyvm
---
i got aids reading this
---
f
---
Yeah thats true. Usually only matters in certain fps or games that don't have an outlined hit box, aka the hit box is the size of your body. Smaller target = harder to hit vs some huge buffed up character. Trying to think of a game people did this in..
---
&gt;iseal is not a legitimate state 
---
lmfao f2p worlds
---
Is there an old nite memorial? Pretty sure I heard the grave *and* its examine text existed as they do prior to his passing
---
Corrupt can be decent but still not great. Iirc with the sword drop factored in it can be 2m/ph. 
---
I‚Äôm also exactly average I‚Äôd say. 100kc+ in regular and only about 10 In corrupt because I‚Äôm not maxed.
---
You do
---
Hello, we haven‚Äôt heard about the GPU plugin in years at this point I think? Even just a status update or a ‚Äúwe are no longer focusing on this.‚Äù would be great, Thank you.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm currently 106.85. 77 pray would make me 107
---
I know off the top of my head in League of Legends certain skins give you an edge. Smaller hitbox, harder to see abilites and all the jazz. Similar concept if not completely the same.
---
Overwatch,  but larger characters usually have more defense
---
Worth IMO

Smite has skins that are banned from comp play too. Though mostly due to abilities not being as visible etc.

Not a website, OP is a very talented professional designer and makes them himself.
---
Nice job, king, you truly deserve an applause üëè
---
O well
---
You got hacked and someone bought bonds, and they refunded all the money but still got the bonds and probably rwt that stuff.
---
You can contact jagex here about it; https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000940597
---
Did someone hack your account and buy some bonds? Maybe they didn‚Äôt pay for them somehow and now Jagex wants there money. Iv heard stuff like that happen before didn‚Äôt still think it was a thing but maybe someone can clarify this.
---
oh, ok
---
Aight
---
Halen is my rsn I'm on right now lol
---
i maxed about 5 years ago and this resonates so well with me, i wish they released my favorite skills 2 or just  flat out removed the xp caps
---
Is there anything you can do with the d pick to store it, or did you pretty much have to get the 99 once you got the drop?
---
Whats ahk
---
uncharged obviously, should also use steel arrows with tbow.
---
Nicee
---
lmao if u actually think the 60 charges it uses makes any difference in gp/h, it probably boosts it because faster olms.
---
Might be worth mentioning that the corp one under the second section isn‚Äôt for the main cave just in case anyone gets confused
---
What is the man cave and how do I join?
---
I can kill jad with cheapest gear, but first time trying caves took me 8 attempts.  Once I finally killed him, I can kill him every time now.  On my 6th fcape gamble for jad pet :/
---
Torille
---
mfw i maxed 5+years ago but i hate raiding :(
---
Aight thx might try it tonight
---
Auto hotkeys
---
I wonder. Does runelite chat filter work at getting rid of this?
---
Auto hot key
---
Basically automatically switching for you, like prayers or gear.
---
It's the runescape equivalent to aimbotting in a shooter. Theres other AHK for things like Skilling but OP is referring to pk ahk.
---
Lol
---
this is awesom
---
Cool never knew that so thanks :) congrats on it!
---
He needs a partyhat!
---
Pretty sure they have a list of pmods too and will degear and stop spamming until they leave to avoid getting muted.
---
you to stop posting this shit
---
slayer EHP is actually like 90k xp/h so its pretty fast if you have gp to blow and good gear/blocklist etc.
---
Can u do a f2p world I don‚Äôt have members:(
---
damn 9 months for 99 woodcutting, did you only afk 30min a day or what
---
who tf cares
---
Holy fuck this is absolutely amazing writing
---
pretty shit bank ngl
---
How do you know they‚Äôre using AHK? With hotkeys you can change prayers insanely quickly
---
I wouldnt use the archer ring switch, the b-ring is good enough. I'd swap the archer ring switch for a fire cape switch if you're comfortable switching. 
---
If you wanna save a little bit of gp, try a neitznot helm over the serp helm. 
---
I personally wouldnt use divine potions, just the regular ones, due to the hp reduction. I simply use the regular ones instead. 
---
Bring restores instead of prayer potions. Its a small bonus, but if you get a sara brew drop, you can use it with the restores to extend your trip a little bit extra. 
---
If you're getting hit alot by melee hits, you could swap the k top for a dhide/blessed dhide top, as its -2 ranged def for more melee def. This would also reduce the supplies cost a little as well.  
---
Some tips for killing the demonics incase you might find them of use - after avoiding 3 hits of ranged/magic, step back one tile, and if it moves towards you, its going to use melee for its next attack style, and if it doesnt, it'll be ranged/magic. Also if it uses a boulder attack it'll be ranged or magic. 
---
hopefully some of this was of help! :)
---
I've added you :)

In case you BTW's don't understand how timezones work, the party is 4 hours from this post!

November 5th I believe is when the first part of season 4 comes out.

You have a full proof already done?

It is if you want it to be. Not everyone has the money for that.

Only xD

u need to chill lol

Go for filling the collection log

Did you kill Oziach?

Looks like you could use handouts yourself

Fuck Zezima though, he said EoC was the best update for Runescape (actually, not a lie and he prefers RS3 over OSRS).

Nonetheless you got my upvote mista.

In 2043 when rs 2027 is polled and passed, I hope they finally enable these graphics again. Hnng
---
But seriously, better graphics while maintaining the current art direction would be awesome. The fear is that they instead go for models that are too busy and produce a lot of visual clutter.
---
No. You're competing with others for each log and the more people get logs the faster the tree is cut. This applies to ores, fishing and trees. Doesn't count for barbarian fishing though.  I remember this from a mod post.
---
Same thing happens if you die right next to your respawn location
---
Nah bro, you're crazy. I started that grind months ago and I could not finish it. Got 60 crafting and just couldn't bare it any longer, I hop on mobile every once in a while do like 4 runs and log off.

Gratz enjoy the power ammy

if you can afford it, definitely use anguish brother

I've done DS2. I also havent died to Galvek. Its really not hard, but appearently it is for you reddit ppl.

The kite lmao
---
Raytracing when?
---
I mean im 10hp cant really help in raid to much
---
He initially ran away from the spot that Galveks attack would land and then ran back into the spot just in time. Yikes
---
Love it but can‚Äôt be there unfortunately  :(
---
If it wasn‚Äôt at 4 am for me I could definitely consider it
---
Most people subscribe to the dps is king philosophy, arguing that more dps = more exp/hr = better efficiency. After a certain gp/hr threshold on your money making method, food costs are pretty negligable, and faster kills are going to negate banking time. 
---
Therefore if you agree with that, i would advise against justiciar legs because they arent helping your dps at all. 
---
You can also get the same strength bonus as a bandos plate gets with a fighter torso for free, save a few hours and some def bonuses. 
---
So i would recommend the ammy, but keep in mind your strength bonus and wether or not it even fives you an extra max hit/what level you get an extra max hit. 
---
I‚Äôve had people do that shit at sand crabs. 6 hours in and never leaving longer than it takes to reset aggro and you get the dude that walks up, ‚Äúbro hop I‚Äôve been here for 2 hours, I was just resetting‚Äù lmao, okay, yeah, like that‚Äôs not just a blatant lie.
---
yeah its too bad i only really get one shot at it haha
---
that's a bad joke
---
If using runelite you can change your shift click to ‚Äòuse‚Äô so it‚Äôs easier to combine doses. Just remember you have to adjust the shift click for each dose level 1-4.
---
Ive done ge is pretty trippy
---
Combine smithing and mining, tbh. 
---
And wc and fm.
---
And rc and mage.
---
And crafting and construction
---
she said see you later boy
---
I remember I stole some guys rune axe head by standing over where it landed. I thought i was so clever
---
I could be completely wrong here as, like I said before I haven't seen the code but I do believe that menu entries are hard coded into an object, if you wanted to create a check like that you'd have to alter the code behind every object in the game to give it the ability to check properly. We've seen before how small changes can completely mess up other areas of the game that're completely unrelated, and with the spaghetti code that the game was in before 2013, we can guarantee that a change this large will lead to alot of issues relating to random objects all across the map. I could be wrong here but this is just based off of what little understanding I have of the games code.
---
This screams mom's credit card

10k cballs aint shit

Did you use a second phone to take a picture of the screen on your first phone?

They could potentially mod a random account for the sake of banning/muting these dicing bots. But you‚Äôre still going to be back at square one when dicing bots show up less than 24 hours later. 
---
And you can‚Äôt give those powers to some rando, they‚Äôd have to be a Jagex employee. So at the end of the day, are resources put towards someone manually banning bots everyday that show up 24 hours later on a new account, worth it?
---
What? I can cook food to use. 1000% more useful than being able to Smith full rune at like 98.

[With bidder names like these, I wouldn't buy this at all](https://i.imgur.com/v4DQqDT.png). Prices are inflated / seem fake. Pretty sure OP is advertising his own eBay item :)

Pretty sure dropping the skillcape in a F2P world, hopping, getting the 99, then hopping back to pick it up works.
---
That‚Äôs not how that works
