I'd love to tank with you but I'm not sure I will be able to make it.

Im Tank God was my old name lol

This post is embarrassing
---
But theyre lime 6m now so fuck that. Thats so much money to just throw in a bond
---
Fucking gz im a bit over 5 k kc
---
How satisfying was it?

Fuck man

At least he didn’t lose his virginity

Holy shit I remember when they were releasing these brand new.

Talk about a nostalgia bomb, damn....

Less brews bring range pots
---
Most definitely.

Hahaha jealous much
---
Huh, I could see it if they decided to add a wilderness ice giant boss
---
Yeah, 5 man already 2-3 hits pretty regularly :P
---
What if I just bought 1 bond on the rs3 account to change the name to whatever. Then I can change my name for free on my osrs account since it's a member and has never changed the name right?
---
 
---
I'm not worried about the name getting taken as nobody has ever taken my name before and I doubt in the short time it will be free somebody will randomly decide to make a new account and steal my name
---
Fucking stupid ass bots
---
I fell asleep doing Corp solos -.- thankfully that was only around 15m
---
I went for a nap while at a gargoyles task on my iron once, forgot I was there. When I woke up the 1 hour death timer had long run out, only lost my whip and some d legs though.
---
Don't mind these brass knuckles.
---
What are you triggered about? Did I miss some drama?
---
Interesting monkey sink... dunno if I would like that or not truthfully.
---
Prayer flicking is an unintended mechanic in the first place. If someone is good enough to be able to use it, they can do that, but it shouldn't be made any easier than it is now.
---
And no, no one is "forced" to prayer flick, you can just...not do a slayer task that requires overheads if you don't have prayer potions. 
---
Also, slayer has basically been the main focus of this game for many, many years. We don't really need updates to make slayer more enjoyable. Making anything other than slayer more enjoyable instead would be a better idea.
---
You one of the four?
---
This is a pretty average semi-late game amount. My bank is worth more than that (though not by much tbh we have similar sized banks I guess) the embarrassing part is you begging for gp on Reddit.
---
why u gotta do us like that... gz btw :)!
---
I play ironman, if you have the wildy elites done you've probably already spent countless mils of skills. 63k is laughing money. And a shit ton of people still use battle staffs. Ironmen and mains alike. If you have the varrock diaries done and aren't utalising the staffs, you're just wasting free cash thrown at you every day.
---
Use red chins on healers. It was the one thing holding me back from killing Jad. Only need like 20-30 tops.
---
Damn do I love them receptors and them numbers. Dangerous combo.
---
&gt;If someone is good enough to be able to use it, they can do that, but it shouldn't be made any easier than it is now.
---
you make it sound like it's hard to click twice within 600ms

Fuuuuck that sucks so hard

This. Changes. Everything.

How in the ever loving fuck sacks is woox going to get a lvl 4 firecape
---
d chain is the rng inventor. I got a gilded spade the same night i got d chain from ddevils

That was my line when I played wow lol, "if I'm going to play for hours on end I'd rather stare at a sexy female ass then a creepy half shemale guys ass..." lol
---
Can someone please explain what twisted league is? I’m an old OSRS player who has just picked it up again after a couple years
---
The hell is primary school ?
---
I didn’t say the game was trash. but the tutorial is really not helpful or really indicative of what the game is like and the things you need to know. Why would someone waste their time on something after being introduced to it like that.
---
Quality
---
I knew a furry once.
---
who just stares at their character?  guess dudes playing female characters.
---
Bitch please, you said basically the same thing with less background information.
---
I make 100k per herb run (8 patches torstols) and do slater in between. Roughly 2m a day net including clues.  88 Slayer.
---
If by worse you mean easily twice as good as vorkath and zulrah then sure. I don't even know why you'd be raiding if you're pulling less than 40k points an hour short of attempting to learn how
---
So is Woox going to be Space X or China when he swoops in for the lvl 3?
---
Does it use true blacks for OLED users?
---
Looks great :) he did a good job
---
Vork punishes deaths with a gold sink, this thread is about death mechanics/punishments, not how much money vorkath has brought into the game. It's better to have new content with a gold sink than no new content at all or new content with no proper consequence.
---
1. complete tutorial island
---
2. kill jad
---
You must never have played alot of wow lol

Looked at his last few posts. His girl is surprisingly cute for how much he resembles an actual twig.
---
most girls play girl characters on runescape, thats a weird myth in gaming where girls are secretly playing and could be anyone u speak to.
---
Imagine using your free time to go through someones reddit history..
---
Sounds about right, "Elon Woox"
---
Nice, I really need to go do KBD to complete my slay helm collection.
---
I lost full void in GWD back in the day and quit the game for 6 months out of anger lol
---
Lol alright I can't decide if you just popped out of a time capsule or if you're just trolling reading all of this. Since when? I think you'd have a very difficult time finding very punishing mechanics to match every mmo that lacks them these days. While there are a couple meant specifically to appeal to people like yourself they are not popular or normal in terms of the entire genre
---
any clans primarily focused on twisted league?
---
wasn't nostalgia for me at all personally, just played most other rpg, or well, most other games to death. literally no game interests me other than runescape rn. most other rpg's/mmorpg's are almost like clones of each other (mostly wow clones) too. at least osrs has it's own identity.
---
Yes you are right
---
When will there be a new bot nuke day? There are so much bots in f2p worlds, there are almost no real people in good xp areas.
---
Yeah I rock blessed d hide and v skirt there instead of arma top and bandos tassys.
---
I just recently had to block YouTube at my work and everyone is pissed
---
Lol you gotta learn code bro
---
they hated him because he told the truth...
---
Boo hoo a racist lost their bank Who Cares
---
It’s the most pain in my dick to lvl only rewards is few FEW short cuts I actually use
---
Shades of mort is entirely dead due to ammy of the damned and people making a bit of cash off of sacred oils BUUUT. . . Numerous QoL improvements could be made for uim (which seems to make up a massive chunk of those few that i see their everyday).
---
- snail trail north of haunted mine NEEDS an agi shortcut for prayer refils at the grotto
---
- people in clan chat need to learn how to fuck right off instead of just saying use bracelets in chat. If your not there to help, your of no use so keep your snarky little mouths closed. . . When im asking if 1 more is free for shades, i dont wanna hear about bracelets. Of course im aware of the bracelets. Do you realize how long it takes a uim to gather the resources? Roughly 7 times as long for 3 bracelets as it would just waiting there for 1-2 more people to show up. 
---
- loot is still way to low lvl for the effort. . . I get its supposed to just be alchables, but the only incentive to do it is literally just amulet of the damned. Its whole loot table needs an overhaul, not just a one item addition. . . 
---
I got more ideas, but again, its mainly thinking of uim, as i dont play anything but hc and uim (i fucking loath the GE, makes 90% of the game pointless in my eyes)
---
Oh is that how Jeopardy works?
---
she looks like verzik's lost twin lol
---
So we'll be losing the loot bots and level 60s running around grabbing up arrows? I support this 100%
---
Me
---
My cat was literally just watching me play RS then I opened Reddit and saw this. Hilarious.
---
Oh wow look, it’s ^virtue signaling.
---
This is crazily unfortunate, why can’t a UIM pick up their items? Don’t UIM’s use the nettles bank all the time? What am I missing here someone plz thanks
---
Stop getting so offended over something so innocuous lmao
---
Just cheat for the items black and continue where you left off.
---
Is that a pretty common thing? Id assume jamflex would flag your account if it randomly logged into a different IP address, beat the caves, then switched back to the original IP, wouldn’t it?
---
Just because the guy has more brain cells than you doesn't give you the right to talk shit about him or any retarded kids for that matter grow the fuck up man....
---
Having someone else, that you only know from the internet, lose progress on a Runescape account is the same as losing a child to you? The fuck?

I’m so on board to watch him catch more imps

If you can afford to go atleast one more level, itll make the spicy stew grind a little better, your way more likely to get a +4 than a +5 with the stew
---
&gt;Having no fear of dying whatsoever is kind of lame in an RPG.
---
Yeah lol I've been just letting myself die when I run out of food/prayer pots on twisted league because theres no reason not to
---
Another DIY member being spoon fed drops what a surprise.
---
Damn right. . . Id trade mine for uim verfs account. . .
---
Not the states
---
What I mean is yes having (1) uncut sapphire is a chance of 1 in 42.66 right?
---
But having 6 of them. Its more than 1 in 42.66 then?
---
Sorry I dont get it.
---
He won't watch me play. Says I'm a real nub.
---
Put the gp from deaths towards purchasing items from the GE and removing them from the game
---
Eg. you die with an unprotected bandos chestplate. It costs say 1% to retrieve (~200k). When 100 people have paid 200k into the bcp account, the system uses that cash to buy one from the GE and deletes it.
---
Make them stream it in addition to the codeword thing.
---
I'm only about 50 in RC and agility, and like 16 on thieving. That's the most boring skill, and I don't think I'll ever make money doing it
---
All I see is a nice stack of Death Runes. =)
---
No. Wrong. Reread what he said
---
How much in supplies does an attempt cost?
---
This might be the best thing for you if you're even relating this to losing a child. It's another man who you don't really know's video game account. It sucks for him but cool your jets.
---
Ronald Reagan fan
---
Never! I would feel the same if it occured to swampletics or tirrawyn only!
---
Hahahaha wtf do you live in 1800s during the slave trade?
---
What? Dying and having a pool of items on the floor for an hour is core UIM gameplay.
---
I don’t give a fuck about my precious karma lmao. Bring your alts, your friends, and your friends’ alts. If my post is not in the negative 100s, I’ll be very disappointed in you. 
---
Least you have a good taste in candidates, kudos to that.
---
I can back because of the nostalgia.
---
I stayed because OSRS is currently one of the best MMORPGs that isn’t being crushed by MTX and the gameplay is addictive and rewarding.
---
Deserved it for being a racist and using the N word with hard R
---
How about just auto prayer flicking feature... or just take it out completely at that point lol
---
Such dedication, such prestige. Im so proud of them.
---
The gilded portal nexus and the mounted digsite pendant, both at 82.
---
theres no way to do it short of expecting them to record all their runs, and even then if someone has a good pc+good upload they could still just buy the cape on teamviewer and record it.
---
though ofc, itd be sketchy since whoever is doing the cape is going to be really good at the cape and most first time capers are not.
---
Honestly I might've been doing runs right next to you for all we know.
---
Honestly can't wait to see the rebuild
---
Those random events were purely added to deter bots, and were very quickly circumvented. They only annoy real players. Mosto f them have been repurposed as actual monsters in the world (iron golem in Elemental Workshop, Tree Spirit in the Waterfall Glade area (forget its name), Evil Chicken in its lair for Legend's quest etc.)
---
I don't see a need or want to bring back annoying random events like this.
---
Hans get the Flammenwerfer
---
Because people don't. The lean on it and don't come off trying to justify its use
---
Learning to do multiple runs per trip will make a massive difference compared to any gear upgrades.
---
It don't think it's too harsh for the game that currently exists. I think it's too harsh for the way the game is currently *played*. Nearly every boss in this game can be killed by normal people, although at a slower and more dangerous rate, when using sub-optimal gear. It's the players choice to wear the extra 100-150m in risk because they want faster kills
---
Wait for sins of father.
---
its true because max agility xp/hr training method pales next to rune ess runners method xp/hr, making agility only skill in game that you can't brute-force into great xp rates and being an unbuyable skill
---
is your little brother the average osrs player?
---
Counterexample here: got mine just above 900 on task, not planning to go back
---
Log prices are tied to longbow high value, just as I said.
---
Yea I only watched one attempt but keep in mind that hes going for inferno with no aoe attacks
---
I thought it was a neon sign.. anyone good at making neon signs??
---
Using the extra chromosomes to help his brother upload pictures to other peoples accounts. That's awesome man
---
No RS was punishing for 7 of 18 and OSRS was punishing for 2 of 5. You can't count them as the same thing to support your argument by calling it 9 years but then not acknowledge they're two different games for the collective 23 years

People talking shit about you dying are just toxic and couldn't come close to what you've done in game, eventually everyone makes a mistake, Swamp man died too if people forgot. Goodluck man, hope you get your gear back and the lucking impling grind doesn't take too long.
---
Probably my favorite u/Legend_Arts picture ever.
---
Yes, ask them to take a selfie with the codeword during the run
---
Literally Google "splashing gear osrs"
---
This hurts, had this happen to me yesterday on my iron and lost my zammy dhid chaps. Even though it wasn’t THAT important (only affects zammy KC) it still made me sad for hours.
---
I’ve been following you since the beginning and man this hurts my soul... it feels like I lost those items too..
---
Do u even read what I am saying?
---
If you include alt scouting while you are raiding, you also have to include alt trading while you are doing vorkath. You cant use alts in comparison to scout but not have advantage on vorkath. Equal grounds.
---
:c

Can you do one for ultrawides? 3440x1440

CC "PLAY" we do daily pvm such as: GWD, Corp, Raid learns occasionally, masses. We skill, do minigames, and do holiday festives like secret santa. CC is always active at all times too.

Wow that a nice exp per hour. I should try that some day. Best of luck to you. Hope to see you in game.
---
Don't forget the guy saying, free 100m to everyone who watches this youtube...
---
Can you believe someone in the runescape community would say nono words, I am completely shocked by this. Wait no I'm not, 99% of them talk like this to their friends in discord or PMs.

&gt; able to do more than 2 raids/hour without alts

&gt;more than 2

It's words on a video game and it's runescape community, one of the most famously toxic communities in gaming. Also you think people who play RS 10 hours a day are "normal"? Lol.
---
yes it will. if you didn't know he died and opened up the next video and he was on the island with all the same items from the GE you wouldn't even know the difference. he should purchase it from the GE and continue
---
Damn that blows so hard. Just finished binge watching the whole playlist, feel so bad for him.
---
Does that assembled whip lmao
---
god that’s shit
---
Nice way to do it. Thanks for the information, i will definitely try that. But im still a newbie. Sometimes i cant see the pk come. They just hope world at the altar.
---
I think this belongs on r/wallpapers.
---
Buy a month of membership and cancel it immediately. You're out $11 for 31 days of seeing if the game is worth it.  
---
If you only play for 3 hours, you're getting the same enjoyment as going to one movie. 
---
Buying membership at a low level without an easy way to sustain a bond takes off all the pressure of having to grind money. You can play the game however you want to.
---
Easy fix to that would have been to charge significantly more for the convenience of buying the packs, but obviously its way too late for that now.
---
He's not a HC, the series isn't dead unless he quits due to the progress lost
---
For real, the old system was never a good system for an mmo tbh. Literally nobody wants to lose gear that they've spent hundreds of hours to get because of something like a dc. I'm all for having a fee on death but losing nearly everything has never been and will never be a good system.
---
He got karil's coif
---
Yea it does 😂😂 3head vocab
---
“What’s going on guys, MY names Theoatrix...”
---
Dumb suggestion. This would allow people to effortlessly pray flick while also switching gear, eating food ect.
---
The way you said it made it crystal clear! perma-skulled.
---
I know but just saying in case he decides to either take a break or just try a new challenge since it’s a long grind to get to that point again.
---
What if everyone was iron man ? (But were able to loot their kills obv)
---
I didn’t have a choice sir :( and im not a god by any means either for it I was dying constantly and getting pissed off swearing out loud etc
---
use osrs.wiki instead of the fandom wiki, new one has up to date information and a bunch of tools and calculators while the fandom one has been vandalised a bunch and is missing lots of newer stuff
---
I don't think reddit is representative of most people on online games.
---
People doing pvp talk mad shit all the time, in runescape and in many other games. Most of the people here don't really do that
---
Why is it i cant bring more than 200 ? Why also i should hop is not spamming bones ?
---
And i dont even know why, but i LOVE shades. . . Ive spent an entire week here and have yet to get bored. . . Hence the QoL rather than overhaul
---
why isn't monkey si viable? it's every 15 ticks isn't it?

so you can't even say faggot anymore, huh?

what, without refreshing stats in between? that's not advisable lol

Alright will sure check how to do volcanic mining for sure. A lot more thing's i should learn about osrs in p2p.

Oof, I guess I should get my gwd done ASAP.

&gt;using FANDOM in 2019
---
In most games, I play as female toons for fashion and shit like that cuz the work on their sprites is simply so much better than the typical "Add more muscles, make him bigger" style of male toons.   
---
That being said, the OSRS male sprite is &gt; female sprite by a landslide, so much so they don't even graphically design gear to fit females properly half the time.
---
Thanks a lot, very insightful.
---
Appreciate it!
---
Congrats, I hope I get this lucky on my way, got to 82 today, only the pants left for the full set and tome already.
---
Daily's? i dont understand what is this? was this a thing??
---
I think i should lvl up using dragon bones then. For a great exp. Right ?
---
I think you're just having shit RNG, I usually do a lot better than that. I'm 1def and I think it's worth doing, plus it's kinda fun imo and I want that pet

"osrs ba" is the official torso hunting / diary dog cc.

people dont give a shit about the minigame after they got their rewards so thats your best bet along with randoms in 306. so yes, you are forced to play with other people who have no idea how to play.
---
Not really a fan of then personally. Had enough of them from WoW and I find they end up more of a chore then actually adding something to the game

Get your cooking up to 70 so you can get barrows gloves. BIS gloves for every kind of combat and will be good to have for slayer

I know for some it’s more about the nostalgia blast of when you used to be a noob too but cmon, back when I was a lot less experienced and wore granite in osrs doing slayer I’d always get people in Bandos walking by asking if I was a bot or just dumb lmao
---
I always get downvoted but I like having instanced bosses that don't let you retrieve your items. Perhaps they can be a Hard Mode of the boss for more rewards.  idc.  i just like death having meaning again. 
---
Then people come at me with 
---
* I dont wanna lose (my whole bank) on death. Its not like I can just downgrade my gear until i get better at the boss!! 
---
* DDOSing will be a problem.   Which is bullshit cuz if people cant see whos in the instance they cant knowingly grief them.  
---
* internet DC's.  Like, bitch we had worse internet back in 2001 this is OLDSCHOOL runescape if you want that shit go to RS3.

If you use that word you are being racist and there isn't a way around that.

Seems like a really shitty thing to be a dick about. Is it impossible he can grasp the context of the game without watching the video?
---
Imagine thinking calling someone the N word is OK.

Bandos year fury and weapon are the most expensive, other than that it’s less than a mill risk easily
---
Woox is the best at pvm on this game. What are you talking about
---
profit
---
B-b-b-beast of a switch
---
When your sibling wants to wear your same clothes
---
Smithing at the blast furnace is pretty profitable and simple to do level 60 onwards although you'd need a coal bag which is a pain to get.
---
Slayer gets good at around level 70 money-wise. Hunting is pretty profitable if you hunt chins. Herb runs are also consistent money. You could also train magic with spells like humidify or tan leather but they're not too easy to get access to. Those are the most profitable ones but there's a lot of other spells that do make good profit either way.
---
oh and runecrafting but who wants to do that anyways
---
Never said it was okay, but holding a grudge for a year about what he said (especially when it was a one time thing) is silly. It was a mistake, I doubt he’s done it again. If he does it again, yeah, fuck him. But people can change, and he just lost thousands of hours.
---

---
Please bring death mechanics from rs3. They're pretty alright for osrs and avoid ddos
---
L O L
---
There is lag but it doesn't matter on a game like OSRS because of the slow ticks compared to other games with faster ticks. As long as the latency doesn't pass 600 ms and is consistent then skilled sellers can complete it over TeamViewer and other screensharing apps.
---
The faster regen speed has diminishing returns with higher agility levels. You already got most of it at lvl 50.
---
It's not wrong tho.
---
Daaaamn. I dont even want to know how much people might charge for their service but thats crazy!
---
Havin the exact same problem on iOS. I need to link my Gamecenter to an email so I can Authenticate my account so can get the security dungeon rewards but the link email button just isn’t there.

rune throwing axe special attk
---
The most well-known seller prices at 400m but many people sell for cheaper. It probably wouldn't be worth selling below 100m though for  a first cape on a maxed account because you won't have a task which will make the run significantly slower.
---
Because then it attracts jackasses like you.
---
sike treasure hunter isnt afk at all lol
---
Ok
---
Yeah, one run easily pays for the tele tab. If you're lucky, you won't even need prayer pot/stat restore.
---
doesnt matter if it’s a teamviewer cape you can still stream that lol
---
Just do slayer and don’t get any other 99s. Get into slayer right away. Lamp it. Do what you gotta do. Shouldn’t need a guide tbh.

If black chins and rigour = heavy pillar dmg i doubt rune axes are going to be much better, very likely will no pillar the late waves no?

Mobile release made it skyrocket in popularity.
---
all in all you need to find a way to cut out about 3-4m worth of hp xp before getting 99 slayer. Do it via cannons, boss tasks with minimum count, jad tasks, lamps, etc... My advice would be do do waterfall and hop right into slayer with the low hp
---
I'm dumb I was looking at the old wiki, thanks

How do you AFK thieving from fruit stalls?
---
&gt; I'm beginning to think that the people who say agility bad are the people who come to this reddit to just check the memes and don't actually play the game
---
From what i know of people here, it's mainly just mobile players and people who camp canifis for full graceful
---
As many as i want because theres safe spots were it can attack u, i did 20 each time tho just to be safe :)
---
9 is elder maul
---
It cant attck u i meant
---
Bro Rij just get the drop m8
---
Well i guess i just have it on my phone and i keep tapping the same place without looking at the screen. But no keyboard anywhere so i still claim AFK!
---
Collect red spider eggs in the edgeville wildy dungeon, if you do i recommend you get looting bag.
---
I bet it’s as disappointing as mine.
---
You ain’t special.

”By January 2020, any channels creating child-focused content such as nursery rhymes, learning games, slime stuff, gaming walkthroughs, dress-up and a thousand other topics must very clearly label any videos as being aimed at kids. The ability to enable comments and notifications will also be removed.” This is part of the move youtube made in september when they got fined $170m for targeting ads to kids and collecting data etc. They stated that towards the end of 2019 there will be drastic changes. Videos that are targeted by the algorithm as ”for kids” will not be suitable for monetising nor comments. There are also certain features disabled on the mobile version on these videos, for example you can’t use the ”miniplayer”

Struggling against tedious and unfun game mechanics is 70% of the challenge in this game but people are nostalgic for it, so don't expect it to change any time soon. When every skill except combat entails clicking a spot, waiting and repeating, people's enjoyment isn't going to come from the gameplay itself. The enjoyment comes from finishing a long grind and feeling like you did something productive, when all you've really done is watch a pixelated character do the same chopping or fishing animation for 3 hours. So if you try to make the game less tedious, you're invalidating the people who have already suffered through it. Therefore instead of improving the game, people would prefer that it stay the same forever, flaws and all.
---
Ok cool, thought I was missing out on some thieving xp. Grats on the pet.
---
i mean my total item value
---
one, two if im really lucky with prayer.
---
If you’re going to repost the same joke in 7 different templates, at least make it a funny or original one.
---
i just don't, man
---
thanks a lot
---
1 -check the humor tag
---
2 - stop being a snowflake
---
3 - let the man exercise his right to freedom of expression
---
me neither
---
That’s the thing, it isn’t humor.
---
What would restart interest better than having rebuild? ESPECIALLY doing the imp thing without having to compete with settled during it like last time
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Yes, I am aware of what is going on. Creators are given the option to say if their channel, or specific video, are made for kids or not; YouTube doesn't decide this and they are not advising on what qualifies either. It is up for the creators to decide based on COPPA whether their videos need to be marked as "made for kids" or "not made for kids". And for the reasons I already outlined, I believe most OSRS videos should be fine.
---
Gather what stuff off karamja?
---
Meanwhile I am here almost 2k kc and no pet in sight
---
He's right though, it's just old meme templates with the same unfunny "joke" attached
---
The lucky imp grind costs him so much money, I personally donated 300m to that fund from my main. Sucks to see it was all for nothing bow
---
Interesting, thought that was really weird
---
Like everyone else is doing? Lol
---
There are lots of really good pkers on YouTube that get zero recognition, just saying.  But to be fair some of the most popular osrs content on YouTube is from pkers, so you might as well go for it.  Why not?  Worst that can happen is you waste your time but you’re already doing that playing a children’s medieval online game.
---
If you do make vids message me with a link and I’ll give them a watch homie
---
im talking about how peta kills pets by the thousand and often through really rushed processes where they dont even try to relocate them
---
Hi Paul, nice hat!
---
ive done this too lol
---
Lucky impling content is like the most harmless gambling content on youtube, I like it
---
Dodian.
---
So by your numbers this gives you 63 swings per day. That's 3.15 minutes of scythe per day. Do you really think that's op for an elite diary reward?
---
Whether you're an iron or a main, this sounds like a great update tbh
---
No, I was just saying how late game gold does matter is all.
---
You should probs get barrows gloves
---
Sorry, got 2 jaws in 1 trip
---
I'm no expert but i think dhcb is the best for records. Mostly because lucky ruby bolt procs can massively speed up a kill.
---
2000 total ironman here. Never played once as a kid. Game just rocks.
---
You have issues.
---
Was wondering the same thing today. Saved the post to see if anyone has any advice haha.
---
&gt; on my ironman
---
It was a big decision moving away from adventure quest because it wasn’t deep enough in my 8 year old head to RuneScape.
---
how so?
---
Exactly, plus he was extremely close to reaching the inferno grind because he got all the gear he basically needed and now just needed to grind the last few levels
---
DHCB, bolt specs are OP (Tho you'll have to get lucky with specs)
---
Ah OK, gotcha. To an extent it does, to an extent it doesn't. There are very few places sang/scythe will actually *save* you time if you add the time it takes to get the gold. So if you only use it at those places, you're probably not gonna end up too strapped for cash. But if you insist on using it at a lot of places, yeah, your stack will drain a lot. If you only want to max and boss, fine. Can even alt for gp -&gt; get Rev protection. But if u care about xp at all you're probably better off being selective with scythe/sang, and using money making methods that also give xp + spending xp on post 99 skilling.
---
They would be called like “saradomin robe top” not “vestament robes” in the ge
---
Same bro
---
Downvote this if you’re a neck beard
---
Nice try account thief
---
It's not supposed to be but that's what it is. Fact is, people down vote stuff they don't like. They don't want it to be seen by others. People upvote stuff they like. They want it to be seen.
---
Thats how reddit has pretty much always been despite the admins trying to make it so upvotes and down votes aren't used that way.
---
If they wantes it to be a system of only showing good stuff they should have only added upvotes, no down votes. That way things get ranked and there is no way to show disagreement via a button such as downvote. Would accomplish their goal better.
---
But instead we get a button that let's us say "this is a bad thing others should not see it and agree with it" called a downvote. So that's how it's used.
---
I liked the suggestion somewhere else in this thread. New keys that also open doors but can't be alched. But that's just me, I just ran out of keys again and cba to farm more right now.
---
Geez leave some women for the rest of us.
---
You're the one talking politics here.
---
This some publicity stunt to milk the series harder?
---
Jk, gl on the rebuild
---
This would be the gold sink to save the economy... literally
---
It goes both ways. Annoying
---
RC is awesome, I don't get the hate. ZMI and bloods are chill and wraths are decent money.
---
Stealing is wrong
---
Like the guitar army from the movie Idiocracy haha
---
Still, defeats the purpose of the keys, I'm not a fan. It would kill the wild god wars dungeon after not too long which isn't great. Obviously you're going to want an easier way to obtain them, doesnt make it good game design. I was just pointing out the retarded comparison
---
I wish one of our resident artists gave us their take on experiments.  Shit would be wild.
---
The anti-staking circle jerk around here is a joke.
---
Meanwhile I have a lvl 3 tutorial island FC
---
OP is an Ironman and wouldn’t be able to buy an eternal glory or an eternal slayer ring.
---
Bit off there. Super Poison didn't exist before Farming; it was added on July 11th alongside Extra Strong Poison, which I believe was originally an X before it was P+. Also, it requires Farming ingredients to make so it couldn't predate it. You might be confusing Strong Weapon Poison with KP Poison, which ironically wasn't changed with the other poisons.
---
I did some looking to see if I could find when the suffixes were changed, but updates from that era didn't have the best posts and I couldn't find it in searches. But if they were added in July 2005, the update was probably late 08 or early 06.
---
My name in game is “mithril juul” I have a 64 combat pure I can show you the ropes and we could practice a bit at the duel arena so you do not have to risk anything. That’s how I learned! Shoot me a message on here and I’ll add you when I’m back on either tomorrow night or Sunday!
---
Thought UIMs don't keep anything on death
---
Runecrafting is the least punishing to not have, because it's useless
---
\-engine work 
---
\-invites opportunities for glitches
---
\-devalues alt only ironmen
---
It's still there, I hit it after an hour or two hopping at Wines of Zammy on the iron.
---
Maybe every 3 or 7 days.
---
It was worse..
---
I know her. She said I could do her but that I would have to do you first. There isnt enough Zammy Wine in the world to hide the memory of your thick carpet of back hair.
---
I gave it a try tonight and I can't really figure out why people hate it so bad. Kills are quick and easy, and the resource cost is really minimal if you go back and use your pool after every kill, or you can stay and get like 4-5 kills in a row instead of you care more about speed
---
I wound up deciding to go back to the regular Abby Demons to burst them since I want magic XP, but can you explain what it is that people dislike so much?
---
This is just ur way of flexing 126 combat huh
---
It is a joke, just use Malwarebytes it will clean the whole damn thing in a second, when you're all done just uninstall it's super non-invasive
---
I said this shit is bananas
---
B A N A N A S
---
This shit is bananas
---
Safespot green dragons
---
I always laugh so hard when I see a pure that is low level melee stats and range but 94 mage. Clearly auto clicked 94 first to see if they get banned lol.
---
Who is dat
---
You are correct, I was mistaken. It's been too long I guess.
---
I did much digging, and found a wiki edit conversation where somebody mentioned super weapon poison in august of 2006. Then I found someone from 2008 that said "what the fuck is a dds". Osrs comes from an august 2007 backup of the game, so we can concur the change happened between august of 06-07. 
---
With that knowledge, I just went through almost all of the update logs in that time frame and found nothing mentioning the change in name. Maybe it was not noted, or its just one of the updates I didnt check. You've got me super curious now!
---
Is that it ? I thought i need to do complete the quest. How can i ne so naive. 😅 thank you for that. It will literally save me a lot of time to complete RFD
---
There's a UIM lumbridge?
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
So glad you're keeping positive - love the series. A silly mistake that I'm sure you're kicking yourself for, but I can easily see how it happened. Fingers crossed for great rng on the rebuild.
---
90-99 firemaking is about 300 wintertodt games assuming you're doing regular runs (500-750 points), meaning to make 150mil from 90-99 you have to get a crate that averages about 500k. Now -technically- this is possible, so lets assume you were lucky and managed to get burned pages (one of the highest worth drops in Wintertodt that still remains pretty common with a 1/45 chance) to roll for every single crate slot you had.
---
In that case you were making 140k on average per crate slot rolled. Meaning you made 84mil if you rolled 2 slots for every crate with burning pages in every single one from level 90-99, considerable less than 150mil.  
---
BUT, you say, you can have 3 slots rolled! Which is true, so lets assume you had 750 points every game, and managed to get that 3 slot every single time (which is a 50% chance). You would be sitting at 126Mil. Still not 150mil.  
---
BUT! you say again, you can have a higher monetary award than pages! which is true, obviously magic seeds and yew seeds are worth a bit more, albeit rare, even with high levels in other skills and all unique pieces gathered. Plus there is the tome of fire! a whopping 1.2mil worth more than the average pages drop.  
---
So since you're 24mil short, you COULD have had 12 tome of fire drops (1/1000), meaning that you would have made 150mil!
---
But! you can have more than 3 slots on average, I had 1200+ points with every run since the chances of getting that 3rd slot every single time on 750 points worth alone is  4.9090935e-89%. And very unprobable!  
---
True, so lets assume you solo Wintertodt, you always had your 3 rolls and sometimes a 4th (which happens 40% of the time).  
---
Meaning your average roll per crate should be 147k if you factor in your 40% extra roll.
---
So let me be the first to congratulate you for your Burned Pages, Torstol, Snapdragon, Ranarr, Magic and Yew seed on pretty much every single roll you had going from 90-99 firemakin, with an occassional Fire Tome and worthless drop, you lieing piece of shit.
---
It is not a cheap game, its not a ez game.. noobs make 300k/h and vets &gt;7M/h, inflation keeps uniques very costly
---
Yes that’s literally all lol, so you can get the ingredients from the jungle. I was pissed when i figured it out right after i finished legends that it wasn’t necessary at the moment for me to finish that part of RFD. GL
---
Enabling, no. Normalizing? Maybe.

Dang it. Now i feel what you feel. I was going to training my combat stats for that lagends quest. Lol. Seems like i already know it now. It's going to save me a lot of time. Thank you fellow player.
---
Yea it was a alt i murked hill giants with and i kinda want it to do something else

MILK

Hahaha "rebuild begins" such a fkin loser

Yeah and doing it in the most attention seeking way possible lol.

Hill giant alt huh

Two big things ongoing atm would be [Twisted League](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-twisted-league?oldschool=1) and [Nightmare of Ashihama](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-nightmare-of-ashihama-poll-blog?oldschool=1)
---
You can buy the required items on GE for like 150k total and then you go and hit imps over and over. They are not hard to get.
---
I mean if it's the elite diary reward not everyone would be able to get them
---
You know what another great item sink is? Deleting every fifth bank worth more than 100m
---
How close the interfaces are to the edge of your phone screen. 
---
Helps for people with curved screens.
---
Ya but it would still be dead
---
Which is the same RNG as he needed for a first one. What's your point?
---
lol noob.
---
If anyone is wondering I haven’t seen a drop since
---
Just because someone isn't joining in on the undoubtedly boring bankstand chat doesn't make them a bot or an autoclicker.
---
Just write a check to jamflex if your desire to support is so high 😉
---
Your right, but spoiled rotton pvmers will downvote you because they fear losing their torags platelegs and possy chest.
---
I got this as my first cape. Just cannon as many tasks as you can. I used Neive/steve
---
I've bought membership multiple times, what's your damage?
---
That sounds nice yea ill do some quests for monsters and then slayer
---
Just teasing, although you did make me laugh with line. Appreciate a good “heathers” reference 😂
---
I’d criticize you for how dumb that is... super unnecessary just to do a specific elite step. But then again the dumber part is being a walker
---
failing all the time is pretty demotivating
---
Bruh 😯🤔🤦‍♂️😅😂
---
Gz!!!
---
Except untradeables
---
That's just a cover up for staring at ass all day and hearing orgasm death/yelp sounds.
---
Lol someone got killed by a gmaul and doesn't know how to properly use it themself
---
The hero nobody asked for, but we all appreciate
---
/u/jazzur big oof
---
There’s another 3 spot down in the mining guild that’s heavily trafficked by bots and it’s easy and fun to break them. I always think the same thing to myself “this guys gonna be disappointed when he gets back!”
---
Damn big F
---
Keep training! Once you get more points you can skip bad tasks and block the worst ones. Always try to burst and cannon where you can. Use bracelets of slaughter and expeditious bracelets depending on the task to maximize exp and gp per hour. As you get better gear and levels the tasks will become quicker. You’ve done a good chunk of slayer. Get to 100 tasks and you should have above level 70. Get 200 tasks and you can get to around 80. Money comes eventually :)
---
You’re the imbued heart/dwh guy?
---
Id agree with old death mechanics without allowing players to scavenge. Otherwise there is encouragement for abuse.
---
Haha
---
It's maybe 5% more concentration because you have to count the three 0 splats on you. Everything else is the same (walk away before they switch from mage/ranged, 50/50 guess after melee phase). Pretty much all the plugin did was count hitsplats so assuming you can count to 3 you'll be fine.
---
Upvote this if you are a neckbeard
---
Jeez thats brutal
---
88 combat isn't even that high anyway, even if you had high slayer, the money making wouldn't be all that fast anyway. Slayer is slow because you are leveling basically every other combat stat at the same time. Don't see it as 'I need to get 80+ slayer to get xxx unlock. See it as 'I need to get a TON of combat skills, as well as slayer' and what you're doing now is a general improvement to the account, instead of focusing on a single goal at a time.
---
Yeah it was level 57. I can't find anything lower than that.
---
I'd recommend using iban staff (is cheaper) until you can afford trident of the swamp + your magic is higher (~80). I'd recommend wearing torag's instead of graceful for increased defence, so that you don't need to pray _all the time_ and hence can save on ppots.
---
I'm just under 80 mage, use iban staff, rune cbow for ahrim, neitiznot, torags, etc and can usually pretty much no food + 0 or 1 dose of prayer pot (1 dose if the last brother is one you need to pray against, I usually don't pray against guthan or torag)
---
Got two within 60 KC on task. Made 60m at the time. Just need to be lucky, but thats the game my man.
---
Thanks alot. i was just thinking about getting this in the morning and checked youtube for guides. People said there its like 5 to 20 hours depends on luck lmao.  
---
Finished it within 15 minutes with your guide. Thanks alot.
---
don’t call people the n word, problem solved
---
Make a 1 hp dharok compilation of you just one shitting people with a quack sound over every kill. Bring in the views.
---
No
---
Might take him a while.. he has no arrows after all.
---
I remember making dragon weapons on paint when I was probably 11 or 12, gonna go see if I still have that laptop
---
Nightmare fuel. But a strange kind of sexy?
---
Honestly the spirit tree and the golem is a nice ideea too. I thought since they are agressive people might no like it. Honestly i like even the trees transformimg to ents.
---
Its a poorly executed troll account in one of the most toxic gaming communities on the planet. Made even worse recently by virtue signally bandwagoning in the past few months.
---
Bossing too, join our clan chat "Play" we are active and have some great players.
---
I’m not sure why this is a surprise to you.
---
Two weeks after it was out it was like this, but with bots.
---
Thanks captain hindsight. Wouldn't have said it if i knew i could get banned still, even after jagex implemented a profanity filter.
---
Join our clan chat in game, clan name: Play. We are active and have players all around.
---
It used to be, then they made it that you can’t get duplicates.
---
Shouldn't say it anyway regardless of ban or not.

Most pll do the boring parts first
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
IMAGINE DYING ON AN ULT IRONDOG FOR GOING AFK LMFAO
---
Nice one.
---
I died by a cow when i started runescape as a child. It was at school and all my friends laughed for years that i died by a cow. Since a few years i got a maxed runescape account and im laughing back at them
---
Why not?
---
I don’t own a 70 def account but that would be something
---
Look at me. I am the RNG now
---
stop
---
Not that I plan on going for 99 untrimmed, but why do you do 3 boss kills?
---
Cant keep getting lucky.
---
Feels bad. Jagex needs to update and trim lms like a plant. It's dead now
---
Sit kid
---
He has died multiple times already on this account so he would just run back. Swampletics has died before as well and he just ran back without touching anything. Most area locked accounts just run back, especially if the account has thousands of hours invested into it. I don't really know anyone who has just thrown away an area lockex UIM due to a death.
---
Better to melee with lance or dhcb?
---
Yes its great, join our clan chat in game, clan name "play". We have many members who can help and boss with later on.
---
lmao
---
Be careful when going outside, you might get struck by lightning while getting hit by a car at this rate.
---
Join in our clan chat, great social place and people to help. Clan chat "Play".
---
Thanks for your boring input, high utility you are.
---
Join in our clan chat, clan name: "play". We have many players who like to chat and boss.
---
Definitely faster yes, but if I remember correctly its less cost efficient until a way later lvl (about 90 magic or something)
---
Still the best cheap weapon for barrows
---
Had me in tears, quite literally 😂
---
Where does it mention kids
---
When it comes to painless good mobs that you can farm for money, it's probably Dust Devils (65 slayer), then Kurasks (70) , then Gargoyles (75) - potentially the best task for pure gp and then obviously Nechrayels (80) and Abyssal Demons (85). These are probably my favorite, but then again, these are mostly for people who just want to mindlessly melee something without much thought. I know there's plenty of bosses, krakens, cerberus etc. but I don't really care
---
So do battlestaves, yes someone had to make them, but doesn't really matter imo
---
same
---
you're talking like it just gives you the drops when you use the key, drop rates dont change. lets be honest, most people that dont do gwd now probs wont do it even if they got a free key daily.
---
also if they did most would want 2, 1 for entry, 1 for if they die.
---
Legit only done the elite diary for the fishing and the sword tele for fights at ng, the runes are just a joke lol
---
I mean, that's kind of what you should expect when you only have 74 mining.
---
I'd prefer for the armor to just be its own thing. Being able to change everything into a different color kind of takes away from the experience of owning the stuff. Ornament kits are mostly for jewellery and niche items iirc, I'd prefer it to remain so
---
And with the free key you'd still want to go and get another one from wild gwd, just in case you dc and die
---
It does matter considering u pay 7k each for them and they have a alch value of 4.2k.
---
So once again you trade them swapping money from player to player and then someone spends 1k+ to make them and alch them.
---
Yes it does matter.
---
As long as it's not time in minigame = currency. Lookup "RS3 Thaler". That and the minigame spotlight was an attempt to revive minigames but it just lead to hundreds of people AFKing a different minigame every couple of days.
---
Sometimes you get crazy xp per hour on some tasks but a lot of Slayer is 10k to 15k XP per hour, just as slow as RC.
---
Damn I thought the community might’ve turned on him for using slurs but that’s awfully silly of me
---
You’d be surprised what people will watch man. I’ve been binging balloon tower defence videos the past few days. If you’re motivated give it a shot and see what people think. No harm in sticking your neck out
---
Pretty sure this wasn't your first offence either
---
all i see screenshot of you having 5 kc, you do  know you can leech raid and still get kc lol proves  nothing
---
Someone did the math when this drama first landed and General way out classes them.
---
Yeah, there'd have to be some kind of activity thing.
---
I feel like they would be great if we didn't have so many overpowered methods.
---
 Dark crab fishing, we also got infernal and sacred eels. 
---
 Noted bones, maybe good for iron men, nobody with elite wild diary would do that over say zulrah for money. 
---
 Wild sword tele, I guess?
---
 And that's the elite diaries, they aren't really that great imo
---
Auto gear switching, auto prayer switching, resized prayers and spells with hiding and moving, marks showing who is easy pickings and hard to beat players... Just the essentials my man.
---
In my experience around that level hp was never too much of an issue considering the amount of decent food that is incredibly cheap  to take with you to barrows. I found running ice spells helped me with not wasting too much prayer such you can just freeze the melee brothers if you don't have any prayer and try to lure into safespots or just kite them. I only ever kept a pray pot on me for ahrim and karil tunnels since i was trying to be conservative at that point.
---
But tbh if you're doing barrows with mory hard done you shouldn't be too worried about using a little bit more in supplies considering how much you get back in runes alone imo:)
---
"I play OSRS 16 hours a day but you should definitely try out Raid Shadow Legends"

if ur serious then u got a virus bro

Thats basically the pure seb nowadays. His last video had 2 minutes of him recycling his earlier video followed by a 2 minute outro begging for subs with these giveaways but only if "we get a certain amount of subs". Spoilers, it never happens. Gotta hit that 10 minute mark tho amirite?
---
Jmods said it was their initial idea to have them as hard as they are now and said they won’t be changed
---
Jesus. That's so generous of you but I can't imagine donating 300m to fund ANY creator.
---
Because it hurts people and because racists like you are the lowest IQ people on earth lol
---
It works because turning 10 people off and earning 2 more people is better than turning off 1 person but only earning 1 more person.
---
okay boomer
---
I got you boy
---
Abby demons are pretty shit gp unless you get the whip drop. Gargoyle tasks are more money on average.
---
Just do mediums for chance at rangers, while doing all masters for a mimic. Really not that hard to get a mimic.
---
Okay calm down mr. Edge, we all know any of us probably can't get better than our right hand
---
I don't understand how people could think a rollback is legit for this. You foolishly AFK'ed, and died.
---
How many do you have in the bank?
---
I see what happend here.
---
He is a 15 year old kid that cries his ass off flaming everyone every time he posts something he totally deserved the mute rofl.
---
Old School Runescape is just a watered down version of Raid: Shadow Legends
---
That's because low level infernos require a great deal of rng, low level fire capes are pure skill and theory crafting. The inferno was specially made to counter tricks like tick eating.
---
I won’t ever play it either, but i don’t mind when people take the sponsorship money. All you gotta do is just skip forward a minute or so, they gotta get some money somehow tbh.
---
 I’d recommend going to NMZ and getting those stats up
---
Do you think I could add you in game?
---
For real! The marketing for that game is so damn aggressive it makes me never want to touch it out of annoyance.
---
Not sure about everyone else, but also doing Konar tasks gives you the chance to get brimstone keys as drops from every monster. You can then open the chest next to her for an average value of 99K. Ranges from like 9-700k though, so can be hit or miss. I just hit 76 slayer and have opened 80 chests or so. Makes for good money over time, on top of normal drop tables.
---
Some Youtubers make all of their money from YouTube, and if it was your livelihood at stake, you'd be putting sponsored content in your videos too. YouTube algorithms are making it harder and harder for content creators to get new viewers, let alone maintain. In addition, there are stringent monetization policies and they only are shorting YouTubers more and more. 
---
If you watch any YouTuber at all, you should step back, stop being entitled, and how about just appreciate the hard work &amp; effort that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM puts into their videos. From what I can see through hard work grinding accounts, editing videos, and publishing consistently, there's not a single OSRS content creators that makes videos purely for money (because...they wouldn't succeed...at all)
---
And if you can't skip 30/40 seconds manually of an sponsor that the YouTuber put in their video they spent countless hours on, then you're an entitled little prick. 
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
Tl;Dr - Memes are low effort, videos are high effort. People deserve to be paid for hard work, and should be encouraged for it. If you're not even paying them directly, then why the hell is it such a problem? Skip the ad in the video, and enjoy the hard work the creator put into the video. (Because no successful OSRS YouTuber/Streamer is out there purely for the money.)
---
Amen this so much
---
yes, and this is solely for magic defense bonus.
---
In PvP, if you wear this against magers you are vulnerable hit by melee/range so it's mostly for PvM.
---
Idk if it's op or not.
---
This has to stop
---
Everyone seems to forget swamp man also died and lost all his items except for a few. You got this, you'll rebuild and beat the inferno in no time. Don't let people say your content is dead now, keep grinding.
---
More like he went afk and returned to a login screen. Assuming he got log out safely after losing aggression, he closed everything for the night.
---
Melody, talking forest, vision, can't think of the name but the one for seers village.
---
theory-crafting.
---
How do you know he doesn't have a alt account to pick up the loot for safe keeping? unless ironman can't pick up dropped item or something.
---
Most of those are all because they can’t add any more bank space in OSRS, because of engine limitations. Things like wildly looting bags are actually balanced.
---
take some subscriber donations to go buy pk sets, go record 2 hours of pk footage, take the highlights and the inevitable death clip.  
---
  
---
throw a 30s intro and a 1min sponsor and then 3-4mins of actual pvp content. spice it up with some irl stuff or other ingame like getting a firecape or future updates or "hype building" as filler. then do the outro for a minute of shilling various discord social media patreon etc, then thank the sponsors and hit the music and a little blurb for another 30s and stop recording at 10:01.  
---
a lot of them deserve money but theres several who are just *lazy*. dont defend laziness.
---
Thanks for the explanation! More of a tongue in cheek question. I have a 13 prayer firecape
---
nty i like it the way it is.
---
hoooly fuck id tear up that bubble butt and really give this hot piece of ass the business even if he was squirtin hersheys kisses on me. anyone got feet pics?
---
I wonder how many young people are on this sub, how can you not respect them trying to make money? Its so easy to skip through videos, or even watch the 30 second clip, I am pretty sure your time isn’t that important
---
I do it with full bandos, defender and DH-Lance. Haven't done the math but imo it's not worth doing before DH-lance. The ranged defence on bandos also helps a lot.
---
talking forest and vision are very soothing  and enjoyable
---
Won’t help if you afk while asleep.
---
i tought they take sponsors to prevent getting copystriked or something
---
Any answer other that doesn't include Sea Shanty II is wrong
---
At the very start this has been passed a poll already. They never implemented it because all the rewards didnt pass lol
---
Why would you bot deaths with an item to get rid of it instead of buying it outright and alching it? Nobody's gonna do that.
---
Honestly I’m kinda feeling foolish for not having one. 15 years playing and I’ve never really used any in game sounds or soundtracks.
---
and 33m is not too high for what it does
---
The Rehnison House from Song of the Elves sticks out, which isn't that good considering it's a secret area of resistence...
---
straight fire  🔥
---
I'd recommend dhcb because if you finish grinding vork or get tired of it you can sell it. Rigour is a good overall upgrade but is a sunk cost once used so you can't switch.
---
Bp with rigor as rigor is op, work to towards dhcb and then use that :) gl on the grind
---
Thats why its tagged as humor
---
A def pure ?
---
Fantastic idea, that room needs an overhaul. :D
---
Ah yes, Patreon the one where even RuneLite can't get more than 500$ a month on from the RS community. The same community that complains about 11$ a month. It is 1 minute that you can skip while they manage to make some money to make their content creation worthwhile the sheer entitlement from people here is astounding.
---
That's a tough one:
---
Fight or Flight, Yesteryear, Principality, Monster Melee, and Superstition are my favorites. 
---
Song of the Elves is amazing too and I set that as my ringtone.
---
Yes more power to them, i love watching ads. Sometimes ill even stop watching runescape videos and just look up ads to watch.
---
This would be really nice
---
Haha if it was 444 then that was me! Yes it feels great to have the cape :) congrats on your achievement!
---
This is so good, this is how it needs to be done.
---
But you get your name mentioned for a half a second in a video!
---
Mad enough to downvote that comment lol
---
lol. You're assuming Runescape will somehow make it past 2021 when all the trending charts say it won't even make it past 2020
---
Its definitely not possible to grab an ip in game also impossible for somebody to know your friend would be on the account or have ur friends ip
---
The issue with that is that they're seeing money right now from RAID.  It's instant, easy money to them, and it even lengthens their videos.  Patreon is uncertain money to them.  It's going to start slow and they don't like that.
---
Most of them aren't willing to switch now.  A YouTuber needs to take the patreon route before they need the money.  Sponsorships mean it's too late.  They won't listen to the few of us asking for a patreon that we won't even donate to until they drop the sponsorships.  These people are making money now, that's what they need.  It's just frustrating that they'd rather give the middle finger to their community for money before asking their community for financial help.  We're the consumers.  We're the ones ultimately generating their money.  We're the ones who should be supporting them, not a garbage Chinese company with a massive advertisement budget.
---
What is even the point of doing KQ after getting the head? Some shortcuts need rework. IMO
---
 It's so hard to hit right arrow key 6 times. How did you ever play runescape if you couldn't do that hard task. Or idk. Go get some water god knows we all need that.
---
In terms of monsters when you unlock Wyrms you can make 500k on average per task providing you alch all the drops you get and collect the other stackables and valuable herbs/seeds. That's my experience from 7k kills btw, I have met people who hate this task but I like it.
---
As soon as you unlock Gargoyles however then the money will really feel like it's pouring in. I walk away from that task each time with at least 700k in drops and Brimstone Keys - again collect everything you see fit.
---
It's pretty unpopular to say but I want to include it, Iron and Steel Dragons have been good to me. I've gained 3 Visages as drops so I tend to always do them but I understand if you find it tedious.
---
In terms of Masters I love going to Konar simply because of the Brimstone Keys, it means any task I do even if the drop table is lacking on a particular monster I still have opportunity to make a stack of cash.
---
Seems like every suggestion made on this sub is just PvMers wanting this game, which has already been made exponentially easier than it used to be, to be made even easier.
---
&gt;1/5000 chance of getting an item similar to Ring of Suffering
---
why?
---
Why not just have it work like every other minigame? As in earn enough points then simply buy reward...
---
yesteryear is a good one, i havent unlocked superstition yet
---
I believed it was impossible as well until actually experiencing the issue first hand. And after doing research seeing that this has happened to others I believe there is a way internally.
---
They don't *need* to make money. Time invested doesn't automatically equal monetary gain. It's their choice to do YouTube as a job rather than as a hobby.
---
By the way, there's a SponsorBlock for Firefox and Chrome. It works on a community basis where folks highlight when a sponsored segment starts and ends then skips the segment automatically for everyone else. It's easily cut down the times I hear about Squarespace or Audible by about %90.
---
The only one that was iffy for me was Red Letter Media's Nerd Crew sponsors were blocked, despite those being obvious jokes.
---
Show me a semi-useful shortcut that doesn't require a diary. Excluding ge shortcut and falador to tav dungon one.
---
I make a point of not subbing to people who ask for it. If i like your shit I’ll sub but because you just asked for it, no.
---
Well the attempt to conceal the dmm lvl 3-126 pvp zone icon says otherwise and you boasting in chat says otherwise again thinking youd outsmart some dumb ass people who are the same ones who get scammed for tbows and shit cuz they're too stupid
---
Ring of suffering should stay coming from gorillas. Why would you want it in a minigame shop?
---
And that frustration is right. But nobody in their right mind would deny another source of revenue if they are thinking long term as a content creator. Having divergent income help with stable income. Putting all the money into 1 thing is just dumb. Sinner or later they will realize this. If it's too late then there isn't much we can do. It is their channel and their decision. They will be one of the hundreds or thousand channels that doesn't make it.
---
Deleting this post. 
---
Will reupload with more details tomorrow
---
Crank up your volume when you do Legends Quest!
---
Is this why Verfs video is endlessly being recommended to me regardless of me ignoring it every day?
---
Why do you not have a name?
---
will do !
---
Can you not
---
You seriously think the poh needs more teleports in it?
---
Yeah but 15% would be sweet. I already unlocked the prayer for cheap, I’m tying to get everything I can out of it. Plus rigour and piety up my max hits by a whole hell of a lot so it seems fair
---
theres enough teleports already
---
Maybe people getting back from twisted league has something to do with it.
---
All the salt in this thread is from pkers lmao
---
Just remember, YouTubers turn to sponsored content because no one chips into their patreon.
---
If you like their content, give them a tip.
---
J1mmy's byrelease series just put in a Raid sponsored ad. it made me so sad, but his patreon is barely pulling in $500.
---
I hope that raid ad gave him a good chunk of change. Don't know what type of pricing those things pay.
---
Cursed yourself with that RSN... you'll get it when the fight happens.
---
havent got most of those only homestead which i like for how it captures that feeling of melancholy
---
Definitely may have been 3! But same thing with me kinda kept goin and finally realized nothing was going up lol
---
Well you can check margins, maybe potions or herbs or rune
---
items change you gotta learn how to find em
---
I’d say this is considerably less broken than unlimited digsite pendants or the jewelry box. This isn’t actually giving you any more teleports, just freeing up some bank space.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Music has every song in-game if you wanna listen to some.
---
I get where your coming from, but from a different perspective, I believe it was Disguised Toast or something. He removed his donate button and moved exclusively to sponsorships and his streaming deal with Facebook. Why? Because he'd rather take money from the company than his viewers. I mean, it's not like you cant just fast forward the video.
---
The books reset every 2-3 hours. So the books are in new spots. Runelite wont know the new pattern until you pick up fresh books. Turn some in or drop them and you’ll find them again
---
Paying a years worth of membership goes a really long way for the sake of perpetual bond spending. But There are faster ways to make money than Cannon balls. But you do have to grind to get there.
---
in time, I kind of want to discover them, if that makes sense
---
I did the same thing. Its just the same copy and paste terrible 3v3 mobile rpg Ive played a ton of times before
---
You already have an hour. That's already more than plenty to get all of that kind of thing you could possibly really need. Losing stuff because you lost internet for an extended period of time is a far worse outcome than any bizarre corner case you're thinking of where you need more time than that to get your things back.
---
But then you feel like you're missing out because they're clearly more efficient
---
Sure even though i only ever use wilderness sword
---
If the famine random event happens then it’s GG
---
Does 🦀$11🦀 seem worth it for their account security?
---
I wanted to get back into the game after about a year or so hiatus, and when I got on I noticed my bank pin had been changed, and I had been skulled so presumably I've lost all my shit.
---
Now I am not 100% certain that I still had my 2fA activated. I thought I did but idk. But I did notice it was incredibly easy to get back into my account and now am waiting 2 more days for the bank pin to delete to make a new one, and even see what is in my bank.
---
So again, Does 🦀$11🦀 seem worth it for their account security? Is it more effective if you are a more active player?
---
Only commenting to get some rng luck
---
They definitely do, but I doubt they retain many. It's just like every other grindy Chinese pay2win game only reskinned to look more Western
---
Well maybe that's the case, but at least the would be a chance for them to shine? Perhaps even do it for a couple games at a time? A task list of 2 or 3 options so that games have some love
---
Stake it all.
---
They advertised at max efficiency using max gear and i dont think they include supply costs
---
I want to believe I've tried that already, but I'll definitely try to be more diligent about dropping or turning in new books to see if it helps!
---
Farm runs are making good money as of now, especially rannar seeds are like 40k and grimy rannaar go from 7900 to like 7600 lowest , currently or last night anyway they were going for 7900 ea.
---
Update:
---
He is Rebuilding!! so do not lose hope  :)
---
Its actually Israeli lmao
---
I do believe it was The Spiffing Brit who said in one of his videos that the company is throwing around ridiculous amounts of money, like basically the average annual minimum wage, just for advertising it with that scripted speech. 
---
They don't want you to play the game at all 'cos it's actually that bad literally you have to just read that same script we've all heard too many times. 
---
I absolutely hate how every single sponsored ad is literally identical, but at the same time it's hard for me to hate the people taking it with the state of YouTube.
---
It's just a lil sad really.
---
Slayer tower?
---
Technically in terms of efficiency you're better off with split since bursting is a way better method of training defense than melee, but it depends on what you actually want
---
you can use a cannon for shamans in the canyon. not sure if it is profitable/breaking even without a dwh drop
---
Oh wow a "possible subscription". Calm down everyone we got a big shot over here lmao. The sheer amount of entitlement in your posts is impressive, thank you for reminding me how ignorant people can be.
---
i dont know what im looking at lol, please explain.
---
Better than advertising for a shit company that doesn't give a fuck about their game and only cares about their advertising budget.  I would rather J1mmy tell us about his patreon every video than him talk about RAID every video.  At the very least, he integrated it somewhat acceptably in his video, even if the ad spot was almost as long as his song.  I didn't like the sponsor spot, but at the very minimum I can appreciate that he still made an effort despite the garbage script for it that he was clearly reading from.  He tried to make it as unintrusive as possible, considering that it's designed by whoever wrote that script to be as obnoxious and intrusive as fucking possible.  I can tell you right now, there's a number of other youtubers that don't make that effort at all, they've just entirely sold out and shove it in there in the same exact way every time.  It's almost like their videos are only made now just to fill in the rest of the void around the sponsor advertisement.
---
The quality of videos just begins to drop when youtubers get sponsorships.  It's no longer about making videos for their community, it's about making videos to put a sponsored ad in.  It's not exactly enjoyable to see a fantastic content creator go to shit because they are trying to appease their sponsors instead of their community.
---
That would barely pay for rent in my area.
---
Lol. Yeah i get that joke.
---
🦀🦀🦀 $11 🦀🦀🦀
---
Nice. I found it just now. Thank you for telling me this plug in.
---
&gt;Screw this game then, I think I'll just quit
---
There's no such thing as quitting runescape, but good luck kicking the habit!
---
Might as well get addicted to  OSRS  instead of getting addicted to meth
---
Currently have 76 mage looking to train to 85.  
---
Any suggestions? I tried lunars/ flax -&gt; Bowstring but it's so slow...   
---
All the youtube guides are outdated.   
---
I'm guessing it used to be 150/150 per cast but it's 75/75 now.
---
damn bro you got THREE pets?
---
Again, I think you're underestimating the desperation for content among creators. When a creator finds something that works they will drag it out until it dies. I'm not disputing that if this is what he's doing - he has absolutely made the wrong call on how to do it. But its naive to think that it couldn't possibly be the case.
---
Yeah chaos runes being 40% cheaper than before makes a huge difference
---
i'd do it too if i could stack some paper on the side, it's just that the company is incredibly scummy for flooding videos with their ads
---
you would get more useful responses if you posted your stats.
---
Yeah, let's spend even more time grinding at the game by locking yourself out of content on purpose
---
Kd7!!!
---
It’s a joke :(
---
This post made by north dock gang
---
Yeah the icon is what I was thinking.
---
Kd3!?
---
Lmao what kind of arguement for your suggestion is this?
---
Theres 3 useful ones for zeah RC.

Please explain what you mean in vivid detail for those who do not know

The cc I’m in “one kik rick” has a lot of TL players
---
With my wage in my country, 11$ is 4.07% of my monthly income. Whatever, I'll just play league of legends for free.
---
Forgiveness and cceptance are to seperate concepts. Tho it seems people would rather belittle one another
---
It makes me wonder why people play this game, it's designed in a way where you have to spend a lot of time on the computer else you won't make progress for a while but if you no-life it, you will end up neglecting other things in your life. It can't be healthy to be hooked up to this game.
---
Worse thing is that your skill hardly matters, most of the progression you make is more dependent on the time you are sitting down looking at a screen rather than your own ability to play the game. Is not like you are earning 10k+ Agility XP every hour because you are good at it, there is no getting good at it, you just do one lap and you are expected to do the same shit for hours.
---
Ok THANK you for HIGHLIGHTING your ARGUMENTS it makes READING THIS subreddit ALOT more convenient
---
Technically a quickness is right. The quickness is specifically 25 Buttholes quickness. A quickness is anybody's quickness.
---
You actually don't need to complete ToB for the tracks since you can spectate runs and get them. You do need to complete CoX by yourself tho
---
I'm guessing it's because you don't have 75 mining
---
It wasn’t designed to be cheaper but rather more efficient
---
Green dragons at southern rev cave entrance. Use burning amulet to get there. Up to 1m/hour profit if you get real sweaty and lucky with pkers
---
I think hes making fun of people who make threads asking for money making advice
---
Im iron but generous of u still. Happy new year and have fun!
---
Can we add a rock in the PoH too that sets all your stats to max?
---
Damn good luck man, spending the holidays at my parents I really miss my gym :(
---
Settled lost items beside he died in an instance not because he is a uim
---
What even classes as low to mid level 
---
Is it barrows ? Lol I don't do much pvm just wondering
---
2 years is more than enough time to gain that gp back tho.
---
they recently added a way to stop certain videos being recommended
---

Spending the holidays at my parents all I do is barb fishing which us quite boring however I got the pet at 85 yesterday so that's something :)
---
Gl on the jaw!
---
This is how I felt during the Zuhaar sandwich lady phase we went through.
---
Need to wait respwan and also tb can provide fast kill. Bring high alch runes also can get back the lost. Can't find any reason to waste time safespot these.
---
They need to add more rewards to LMS so that people actually see sense in playing the minigame.
---
It's shit profit and therefore a waste of time.
---
Yup, sgs, ancient mace, bone crusher, holy wrench, herb sack, gem bag, seed bag. All QOL slayer items for saving cash. Might not be efficient but I like 1 trip tasks.
---
Of course I can blame them.  
---
If someone thinks it's a good idea to quit a job and do YouTube full time then you can't hold people accountable if they get tired of the same 10 minute video every day.

I mean it won´t really change anything ,cause he was gonna catch imps passively anyway for the next half a year ,now he´s just getting the items back.

What does that have to do with putting the armour in your house?
---
&gt; but I think you’re severely underestimating the work it takes in playing the game, growing a platform, and compiling/editing clips for a video. 
---
Not really.
---
If you play a lot then the compiling of clips happens naturally.
---
From your comments your setup is good, make sure you are running the whole time (bring stams if you need to). I think 10 chests per hour is about the max with your levels/gear. So don’t sweat it you’re doing great.
---
Criiiiiiiiiinge part of Eastern Europe apparently. And it's a Latin word, it's origins are Rome.

You're being conditioned to tolerate ads in a space they don't need to be in.

Honestly dude maybe one and 2k posts make me laugh seriously all of mine are funny you and your haterade brigade are just bums tbh who can't make good memes for the community to take away the monotony of grinding the game because you don't have the nuts to be yourself just hate on other people

Rebuilds are interesting.

Source: every staking stream.

It's not selfish.

Are people selfish if they don't watch Disney movies?

Do they HAVE to get Disney+ to support them?

We're on 2007scape, everyone here says "the quickness" because guess what, 25bh is a 2007scape content creator! Wow!
---
&gt;okay....  
---
&gt;Rep
---
Give it to me, I have a total of 2 hours play time.
---
As a Vorkath professional I can tell you DHCB is by far the best upgrade you can make specifically for Vorkath. :) Next up is Rigour and then Ward.
---
Are you sure about this?
---
Idk why but this made me lol
---
Whatever they do they should make the desert heat even deadlier, put some stress back in that place
---
So you think TV shows and productions cost nothing to make? I'm not gonna lecture you on this, so perhaps you should do a quick Google search on where advertising money goes..
---
Get Ornate pool as soon as you can, it is beyond OP and well worth the 25M cost overall.
---
Do RFD, use it to speed through quests. This will lead to DS2 eventually, then begin gearing yourself for vorkath to make B R E A D.
---
Haha, I fucking hate my life....
---
get good
---
Creating content out of RuneScape is an allowed form of rwt
---
this! barb fishing is super chill imo, and the agility+strength bonus is suuuuper nice. Otherwise, maybe motherload mind is quite afk
---
Black Mask is better for slayer tasks when using melee. And if you're 70+ att/str, buy yourself an abyssal whip. You can also look at getting yourself a Fighter Torso for the extra melee strength bonus and buy yourself some barrows legs if you have 70 defence.
---
But that's the point. A lot of people camp KQ for the slayer helmet and pet once they finish the diary.
---
Big difference between being challenging and being time consuming. There is nothing challenging about clicking the same rock or the same tree or the same anything for hours on end.
---
Not all. Case in point, shortcut from Lava (then Red) Dragon Isle predated diaries by an entire year. Diary came out, they locked the shortcut behind additional requirements.
---
As someone who enjoys both gamemodes, neither is "hard". It just depends on how you play the game. You can get maxed with best gear without ever defeating a boss on regular mode, but if you want best gear on ironman u have to personally kill all those bosses and complete raids hundreds of times. That's why some might call it hard in comparison.
---
Other than that it's not much harder, just a longer grind.
---
I'm too low leveled to do them yet :s
---
I enjoy the concept, but I feel like we'll eventually have too many high end weapons and armor, we'll just keep up the power creep until it's like RS3. I just don't think the game needs more than 3 "raids", and IDK if they should put one in the desert. I guess we could use new high end range armor, and maybe a staff, and a desert aesthetic for those specific items would look really cool. I would vote for more raid dungeons, because more content is fun.
---
GZ on the pet, as a future tip if you ever decide to do vork for money again. Vorkath is actually faster with void + salve than it is with a slayer helmet and arma. Arma makes you slightly more tanky but the increased kills per hour on void easily negate this.
---
slayer 100%
---
I interpreted 6000000cookies comment as a hyberpole explaining how we shouldn't crucify people that make mistakes (not excusing verfs behaviour) so often we want to dunk on people when we should be helping them grow/change
---
You’re a grown ass man that doesn’t have a job?
---
the moneymaking methods list efficient or close to efficient rates with the highest necessary stats. for example, rcing single nats at 44 is very different from doing it at 50, which is very different from double nats with all pouches. and pvm methods scale up to your level and gear. max gear and max stats means quicker kills, meaning quicker cash.
---
if you REALLY wanna make money with in game gold, dailies are probably the best way to do it while not feeling like you're doing much extra in the game. herb runs (32 farming, must have magic secateurs and ultracompost), birdhouses (fossil island unlocked), battlestaves (at least medium varrock, hard and elite are better), and kingdom (throne of miscellania) combined make up essentially free membership with 30-45 minutes a day of 'work'. 
---
otherwise, pay the $11 and don't worry about it. if you have a job and you live with mom and dad, you won't have a problem finding the money.
---
No.
---
Mole Day was just absolutely awful, and that wasn't even very long ago
---
I refuse to watch any OSRS video that's close to 10:00 minutes. 100% of the time it's a low effort video.
---
You are free to do that but are not entitled to all of the content then lol... asking otherwise would being asking them to let you not do skills you don’t like

PLEASE JAGEX
---
It's the BIS melee gloves, if you want gloves that are good at everything use barrows

Yah, youtubers are incredibly annoying

That's what they want you to think
---
Not so sure about that. You can host for money not to mention how much money you save from the restoration pool, barrows repair, and the countless time you save from all the teleports occult altar switches. What’s overpowered is that you can host maxed houses for millions of gp a day afking and use a max house without having the construction level.
---
Do you not like balancing?
---
yeah that's runescape tho, it has been like that for like 15 years, so maybe you should just find a different game if you dont like that
---
The difference is it's actually a good game, right? Isn't that required to get people to stay and multiply the effect of that advertising?
---
I dont mind the ads. I mind the 10+ min vids with like 2 mins of actual content and 8 mins of bullshit like talking about paid sponsors and overreacting over getting some item from a monster that u were slaying and then make a huge deal about it. ”I swear if these chickens drop one more feather I will end it all  x  30 each vid”
---
Rs vids are cancerous as hell and I dont really enjoy watching them anymore after years of watching them
---
Rupert Murdoch has a net worth of 14 BILLION USD.  
---
Do you really think they need ads to show NFL games or is it just a way to make high ups even wealthier?
---
Sweet, thanks for the insight! I ended up buying the dhcb, now to quest my ass off lol
---
You didn't answer me.
---
everyone knows already. Still block them because you have to click them again or they go idle.
---
Find safespot for Drakes plz.
---
IDK. I think that having a portion of the desert be very dangerous (traps, heat, monsters etc.) but with a lot of good rewards, like runite rocks or whatever. Balanced danger is good danger. Danger for the sake of danger is bad danger.
---
I’ll save for that :) do you find it’s worth using Mahog planks?
---
That is a genuinely wholesome interpretation of it, and I can't take that from you.
---
But, from my perspective, when you're calling someone out for literally racist/homophobic slurs, and someone responds referring to it as "saying a baddy bad word," the tone is pretty blatantly condescending and demeaning to the topic. Especially since OP was just saying, "Huh, wonder if he repeated shitty action that he definitely did," and then cookies going on to just turn it into an extreme example.
---
Kurasks are a nice 60 task, 70+ really starts getting bank on good tasks. Always do ur abby demon tasks
---
I use the official client. I think all the overlays and on screen cues of unofficial clients take away from the game. I just like chilling and playing I don’t need flashing boxes and item tags to prompt where to click
---
Support because I have augury so it should be buffed.
---
Neither set fits the game style whatsoever, but individual parts like the cape/shield/boots look alright for diary gear
---
Hell ya I want to wear a cape
---
All diary rewards should be removed. Problem solved.
---
Or not get addicted to either is good
---
Still working on my KQ agil shortcut. Finally got the diary complete just need the 85 agil lvl now.
---
Dope! We're working on some more slayer guides and low level bossing guides, let us know if you've got any requests. We're always down for a challenge.
---
Because void + salve ei is BiS
---
This makes way more sense than I ever thought it could.
---
So tell me the difference between teleporting to my house to access *most* teleports in the game vs teleporting to somewhere with a bank to access *every* teleport in the game.
---
Pay to build the teleports in your house, use the teleports from your house.
---
Shut up and use your fucking bank if thats what you want to do.
---
Thanks I am. Have fun your gp per hour sim.
---
Os gwd
---
We need to turn around
---
Wasnt ely like 700m?
---
Ignore please - elvemage, darkermanz1
---
Everytime i see this AD i downvote the vid
---
They're saying they have high agility already. Locking the high level shortcut behind then something more is their qualm. I kinda agree with that the input to agility doesn't award the output by itself
---
no
---
I'm going to try my hand at vorkath I think should keep me occupied
---
You might be on to something
---
I can't be the only one that knows osrs only exists because of the people who specifically wanted that style of game, can I? It was rebooted without f2p with no plans of development or updates - exclusively for the people who begged for it after eoc/rs3. The idea of the game turning into another shitshow like rs3 is unacceptable lol.
---
dont melle if you dont have DHL, dont melle unless ur 95+ all melee stats, just use dhcb instead
---
Considering Settled paid 1m for each lucky impling as well as 1 entire bil for the lucky impling he got the rcb on, as well as the 1/161 chance of obtaining said impling but over the course of several months, combined with all the time it took to up get 99 Hunter to catch said implings which includes lamping to 27 Hunter and then catching tens of thousands of lizards, all on top of being a major focal point on content having received hundreds of thousands of YouTube views and more importantly thousands of Reddit karma, I'd say the crossbow is at least worth nineteen ninety eight when I ripped off shittymorphs signature comment because I had no idea where I was going with my own.
---
r/animemes x r/2007scape, interesting.
---
dhcb makes you crazy money at vorkath so yes its very worth
---
Giga IQ

I'd say all teleports in the POH might be a bit much... Diaries offer a lot of teleports. To list them for effect, that would be Ardougne Monastery, Ardougne Farming Patch, Nardah, Kalphite Cave, Rellekka, Sherlock, Gem Mine, Duradel, Kourend Woodland, Mount Karuulm, Falador Cabbage Patch, Slime Pit, Burgh De Rott, Piscatoris, and Fountain of Rune. That is 15 unlimited teleports all from a single hotspot, with several being pretty new teleport destinations for a POH.
---
Perhaps instead of mounting with teleports, it could go in the Costume Room? That would help with the bank space saving aspect at least. But if we did want it mounted, at least put it in the Display hotspot so it is this or the Cape Hanger.
---
But they aren't required.. They are shortcuts. You don't need them.
---
Am I the only person who hates having to use the PoH for everything. Being in constant loading screens is bad game design.
---
Good luck let me know how it goes!
---
Task is 15%+ a little from anguish
---
 void is 12.5% + 20%
---
Rip your hc status my dude 😢
---
Who really cares? I don't. He said a baddy bad word. Bad bad bad guy! Except I don't care, and people keep bringing it up for some reason.
---
Oh God, the regs are revolting and claiming dominance over ironmen! Nooo!! What will we ever do?! 
---
Guess we'll just have to keep enjoying the challenges available to us in the game. Smell ya later, normies.
---
(Btw, I'm not serious, I just wanna be a part of the banter)
---
you're choosing to completely ignore the part where they have to record, edit and post process the videos in addition to coming up with titles and thumbnails weekly/daily - which are the most important part of a yt video in 2019. all that to risk making fuckall on a video because cpm happens to be garbage again this month or youtube is in yet another clusterfuck 
---
it's not just sitting down behind your computer and playing for x hours
---
that being said, there are plenty of hobby creators aswell but the reason you don't see most of their content is because they upload so rarely that they can't climb to relevancy without sacrificing literally all of their free time on it
---
I wonder if making random conclusions about someones personality from a reddit post makes you a judgmental asshole?
---
Menaphos is hopefully coming in the next couple years along with raids 3 - really hoping for the content update then
---
The main benefit is it would save inventory space. It would add a lot more utility to the POH with 15 locations with most being pretty good. Even for something like Vorkath, it means you could tele to POH, restore, and then use the mounted boots to the dock and bring an extra food or potion. But the main benefit would likely be for things like clues since you would have access to them all before you'd know if you need them and without having to carry 9 or so items, weighing you down less and letting you bring other items.
---
Its really good, just bring range/bastion potions
---
Pretty much same story here. Before anyone says "well why are you here" it's because I still follow the game somewhat and watch some you tubers.
---
I do regret playing runescape so much, but if it wasn't runescape I probably would have just spent more time on some other game anyways so I can't blame everything solely on runescape.
---
Real talk, no ones forcing you to play the game. I didn't like the direction Black Ops 4 was heading so you know what I did? stopped playing and uninstalled the game and started playing R6:S instead.
---
slayer never really gives you a good buck for your time until your 90+ slayer and killing slayer bosses, i personally wouldnt recommend slayer for gp but rather for training combat and having fun. Bosses like zulrah and vorkath are far better money and take a lot less to unlock but you just have to get combats up before killing them.
---
If you don’t wanna pay for it go focus on slayer/bossing/ raids and you should be able to make a bond every 2 weeks if you play consistently and have mediocre luck. If you just wanna afk skills for the whole bond I hate to say it but you probably won’t make much even if you played at bot like efficiency for the majority of skills. Not saying all aren’t good but pvm is definitely the best route to go for fast and consistent money. Even w/o seeing uniques I can easily pull 2-4m within a couple hours play time just thru Pvm. Sometimes it’s not the worst idea to pay for it earlier on into an account and then just playing for bonds when you have access to some of the end game content. Best of luck man on your bond grind !
---
Do birdhouse runs. They're like minimum 15k a run, but often they're like 50k+. You can do them every 50 minutes and they take like 5 minutes. If you do them 10 times a day, that's minimum 150k a day. Over 2 weeks that's nearly 2mil. Add herb runs in there and you get close to a bond without even playing really. Plus a lot of hunter and farm xp.
---
why would u be on ancients in cox tho
---
You can't even afford $11 usd to access bonus content on an online medieval game from 2004, and you're on here complaining instead of making a living wage for yourself. 
---
Get your fucking priorities straight dude.
---
Collecting items from clues that require full sets before they can be stored can take up a lot of space. I thought 800 bank slots was little, then I started an Ironman account
---
“I really think this skill should be more useful on its own.”

Lunar spells can bring great profits
---
Still trying to get my feet wet with farming. Does anyone have a self sustaining model of payments from allotments to trees, e.g. grow strawberries for this cycle to pay for x tree and then do cabbages for the strawberries for the next cycle?
---
And when do you receive exp for trees? Do you have to dig them up?
---
&gt; Energy regen is kind of a joke on its own
---
The energy regen is actually useful in PvM, even with Staminas
---
because they're reading off a script they're provided 
---
this video explains it pretty well from a creator's standpoint https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hv3CcJYMmU
---
Just go balls deep and make a UIM
---
Once again, MELEE gloves. You would never use them with magic or range so it doesn't matter. People use Slayer staff for crumble undead at vork to be above -65 anyway
---
I found it very helpfull to shave off my fingertip to about 2mm width.
---
kq is passable loot post-shortcut and has a baller pet
---
how much harder would you cry if rooftops weren't added?
---
This would make stamina pot sink bridge too short devaluing my stamina pot sink bridge only HCIM.
---
You’ll receive exp for trees when you check their health. What’s your farm level? And are you Ironman?
---
I was thinking that they could give you something like half the xp instantly rather than having to remove one tree and planting and paying gardener and waiting 64 hours. Or trading them into rolls on some loot table. Or they could be traded in for one roll in some loot table. Maybe the npc could be in advanced tier farming guild so you need the 85 farming to access.
---
certain gear keeps you below -65 even if you have the staff
---
You should go to r/modernwarfare if you want whining. Granted, the devs are incompetent over there but still.
---
Desert Diaries are kinda shit tho, so if you don't like KQ, there's no point to actually do the diary to unlock the shortcut.
---
The whole skill could use an overhaul
---
Possibly the worst attempt at humor I've seen yet.
---
Awesome I'll check it out. Thanks sir
---
that's literally the requirement to get good at like..any game, what are you even talking about lmao.
---
Why can't you just earn $11 and buy a month of membership like a normal person? Or better yet drop like $7 on a bond and play for 2 weeks. Because you seem like someone who would get burnt out before 2 weeks is up anyways.
---
Im at 1200 and just quit it tbh.
---
You mean playing the game?
---
proof? Haha this shit was funny
---
Yeah well what if I want my own quickness to slap people with?
---
Its also useful just in general. Anyone who has played ironman without staminas would know so.
---
While winning the lottery
---
No shit, thought this was the season of giving
---
OP will never see a raid in his life. I'll be shocked if he knows what a fire cape is.
---
47, not iron man. How often can you check the health of a tree?
---
Yeah I need to be able to mount my camulet and lyre next
---
Your keyboard works in this interface btw
---
Gz. But this title really needs a comma lmfao
---
Nah fam, you may choose to do slayer when you're lower cb lvl and get tasks from Vannaka who can assign Basilisk tasks so your statement above is invalid :)
---
i mean i had one. it just became so annoying. much rather just spam raids/pvm on my main than sit there chopping a tree or fish karambwans for 300 hours but that's just me.
---
Yes, confirmed if now.
---
Make unfinished potions.  Can be done at the GE without moving
---
You can only check heath once then you clear it and replant it, wiki gives growth times idk off the top of my head
---
Pretty difficult to answer without knowing what you already have/don't have tbh
---
I will say that it's a pretty bad idea in general to just hoard a giant stack of gp for a long time. You should be buying gear along the way, then sell it back once the value of all of it equals a more expensive goal you were shooting for. For example, when I was saving up for a dragon hunter lance (80mil) I bought bandos tassets (30mil), amulet of torture (15mil), and a tormented bracelet (15mil), then once my cash stack hit 20 mil I sold those items for 60mil and used it plus my cash stack to buy the lance, and until I hit that point I got to have better gear to use in the mean time
---
The most important upgrades for any lower level will be the zenyte jewelry first then the imbued DK rings (berserker and Archer's especially). Both of those will provide a much larger boost in stats for your gp than anything else. Also fire cape and Barrows gloves or course
---
Fashionscape isn't on point. Too 2005 imo
---
I blocked wyrms simply because of the bullshit where they stop aggro-ing. I was hoping this video would show as spot where they don't do that. Everyone basically already knew the safespots.
---
OP is a coward.
---
"I want my exp straight away. I don't want to actually play the game"
---
This has nothing to do with your post but you can move the interface bars more to the side in the settings tab. This will give you more screen to scape
---
I see people with max strength bring an ancestral top for mage bonus. Try something like that
---
Just get good and do the diaries
---
Damn, that’s pretty lucky
---
Which is the point of getting kc/keys. No need to take it away.
---
Must be Kemp Q!?
---
Your way overthinking this or have some ulterior motive my dude. Region locked accounts aren't some life or death rule system. Obviously they will try there best but sometimes exceptions need to be made. The most obvious answer is the correct one. He will do the bare minimum requirements to get back to his area. Again I don't get your motive behind your thinking.
---
He could just be using up his prayer points to extend his trip by a little
---
I agree, I was saying we shouldn't do what OP suggested.
---
I like animal apogee. I know it isn't currently in 07, but that's my favorite. It makes me feel nostalgic for something I've never had if that makes sense.
---
You can sort of safe spot by setting up cannon and feeding cannonballs
---
Nah he’s been sipping ppots he’s been here a while
---
You can be 200m agility and not have all the shortcuts unlocked, that is why it is a dumb requirement. If they want to make it so you need X amount of boss kills before you can use the shortcut outside it then so be it, but locking it behind the elite diaries with basically the same concept is just not quite the type of logical thinking that should be behind game design.
---
Like who is the best rock climber in the world and is like, fuck me - I can't climb over that 2 foot boulder cause jimmy says I need to pay the pope 2 dollars, wax the king's shoes, help an old lady across the street, and kill a spider?

See, i like raids, but all my friends quit rs, and do you dare suggest i socialize with people in game!
---
Don't listen to that noob
---
That’s one skill I don’t level up
---
It may revive dead content, but we all have to be on at the same day same time for that dead content to be revived and playable. I like the idea sounds fun :)
---
Guess I'll get on runescape now
---
Does anyone actually play the game?
---
I use dhcb but I'm pretty sure tbow is bis. Not sure how dhcb compares with the dhl.
---
pretty sure it's that way because it's a quest house? and a hint for figuring out which house it is?
---
im ngl, i wish there was something worth grinding for in castle wars. so more people would bot it... so I could actually play castle wars when I felt like it :/
---
If you haven’t tried yet, realize it’ll take multiple attempts.
---
There are guides which show how to make oak dungeon doors with little mouse movement, id recommend those
---
Which is better for training melee:
---
1) Obby plate, Obby legs, Obby helmet, Berserker necklace, Obby sword, dragon defender
---
2) Obby plate, Dragon legs, Neitznot helmet, Amulet of Fury, Dragon scim, dragon defender
---
3) same as 2 but saradomin sword
---
4) another option but please also pick 1 of the above
---
Woox is gonna get even more girls when he wears his irl infernal cape now

&gt;7k each for them and they have a alch value of 4.2k.
---
&gt;**someone spends 1k+ to make them and alch them.**
---
In the second area (end of the vid) you can safespot 1 of the spawns immediately after you jump over the gap.
---
The wyrm needs to get caught on the corner, when it de-aggros it is blocked by the edge so it's harder for it to wonder off. 
---
Youre limited to 1 spawn, so it's inefficient

You don't NEED to make money from your job. Time invested doesn't automatically equal monetary gain. It's their choice to do anything as a job rather than as a hobby.
---
Skipping and blocking the right tasks is by far the most important in addition to what has already been said. For XP, you want to be doing any cannonable tasks in multi or barrage tasks as much as possible. Use a slayer spreadsheet to determine what you can block/skip while still gaining points long term. Good cannon tasks are trolls (ice trolls on jatizso/neitiznot), kalphites, dagannoths in the lighthouse, and suqah. Barrageable tasks are dust devils, nechs, and smoke devils. You want to skip or block most other tasks without losing points, so you may have to do some shitty tasks for points.
---
Good to know, wasn't sure about that one.
---
What’s is your sample size?
---
legit i already have a uim locked in desert you'd be suprised how the community has several uim desert accounts although small like 10 players but our discord is big

I blame today's office chairs. Even gaming chairs are mostly flash, and do not focus well on ergonomics. Nobody needs a fucking race car shaped seat. We need lumbar support and need our screens to more closely match the height of eye level while sitting up. Also, as a sasquatch, I've never found a chair I can fit in comfortably. I always have to cross my legs. Might as well just sit on my table.

What a thrill to smith items on different anvils, or light fire in different places. Really gives an area specific spice to it. Not to mention some genius tasks like getting house decorated stone at one estate agent, just to tear it off and have it decorated stone by another estate agent
---
T H I C C
---
Yeah it’s pretty annoying
---
Why? Because it's not a traditional office job?
---
They’re surprisingly easy, and they give you lots of tools and perks to lessen certain skilling issues. IE: Farm teleports, teleports to PVM spots, noted drops, etc. A good goal would be to get all hard requirements.
---
exactly.
---
Sweet thank you
---
That's just a ridiculous assertion, there are plenty of videomakers that consistently put out high quality content that is over 10 minutes long

Just wait for the long term scam. You think you won by logging, you think its fake cuz of the d scim question...but just wait, he’s 10 steps ahead of you!(; lol jk gg on free tele tab
---
I have done it before. And saying, “do this for 6 hours” doesn’t make it any harder. It’s like raising your arm in front of you. It’s not challenging in any way and it’s not hard. But if you keep that arm raised for 6 hours it gets extremely hard. Not because the activity in general is challenging. But because your muscles are getting weaker and weaker. Any simple activity can get difficult over and extended period of time. And that’s the point that you are missing. 
---
Take WoW or even WoW classic for example. The leveling is in no way hard or challenging. It’s simply time consuming. If you put in the time, you can get max level. The challenging part is taking that max level and doing high end raids/mythic+ dungeons that take coordination and skill in order to kill the bosses or beat a dungeon time. The old school community thinks it takes skill to get a max cape. It doesn’t. It takes time. It takes skill to get an inferno cape. And that’s what people in the community want to change.
---
They want to make the non skill required content to go by faster so they can get to the content that will actual challenge them. And I don’t mean click things faster kind of challenge.
---
It’s 2 left hands

Call Me Kevin has actually been one of my favorite Youtubers lately, so it was a nice surprise to see him playing OSRS.
---
Oof
---
You should ask RS3 how they dealt with this problem. Lol
---
I agree it could be a bit much, but what if it was restricted to only the elite diary armour piece that can be mounted? Would make it more valuable as a reward
---
I started Ironman few months ago...love the whole process and I was sooo against iron made modes
---
Then they achieved their goal
---
Since you're not an iron, it is generally not efficient to plant+harvest allotments unless you're doing so for a diary, farming contract, or are planting snape grass for experience. You're better off just buying the payments from the GE or just using ultracompost once the payments become too expensive (e.g. for maples or palm trees).
---
Link your granite 6 hour
---
Thats a valid point
---
Lol I wouldn’t be surprised tbh if something were to happen when I log back in after I’m back. People are as desperate now back to when I first started playing 🙃
---
i enjoyed it guess im scrub...
---
I don’t log my skilling lol I only log slayer tasks/drops and pvm accomplishments
---
Yup, I keep home tele/alch runes unless I'm bursting!
---
Children are 100% the target audience and it is scummy as fuck, who else would be clueless enough to see some painfully scripted advertisement and say to themselves "Wowzers, my internet celebrity friend totally loves this game, guess I'll try it out!". People gloated too hard about how they're getting away from TV advertisements by streaming all of their entertainment, now advertisers are shitting this medium up as much as they can too.
---
I haven't played that game specifically but "super rare" is just how games tend to refer to some of their units. So like there are N= normal, R=rare, SR="super rare", and SSR=idk what. In some games the SR/SSR units aren't actually that rare, its just a designation of different unit grades. Games that make "rare" units common typically make upgrading/gearing them more difficult and that is how they get you instead.
---
Wholesome

Then how do you know you've held over 130k/hr for 6 hours at 4g?

I remember last time this was brought up someone mentioned that building was actually that style before the update.

Because I can take the xp I end at subtracted by what I started at and divide that by the amount of time I did it for.
---
raiding
---
What’s your defense? I use black d hide and usually get hit with 10s when trying to trap them. I’m 70 def
---
Lmao sure buddy. Link your account then, considering that rate requires the mining cape, surely you have a fair bit of post-99 mining exp.
---
Maybe it should be do a diary or 99 agility. But you have to wear the cape for the shortcut.
---
The final phase can be irritating with lower melee stats, since Sire can take a pretty long time to kill sometimes (especially if you missed your DWH spec) and you're just getting wailed on by the spawns the entire time. I imagine the fight is also pretty terrible if you're staying in the arena the entire time and sustaining HP off of Blood spells, because then you also have to sit through the downtime between phase 1 and phase 2 every time. With the POH method and the recent QOL upgrades at Sire he's really not too bad.
---
Old School RuneScape is one of my favorite games ever and I have never played any other version of RuneScape. I feel like there aren't many people out there that didn't play it when they were younger.
---
&gt; instead of training the skill you find useless, you can allocate that time you would have wasted into other pieces of content/skills that are more worthwhile and will benefit your account more.
---
How does this relate to their comment about shortcuts being locked behind both agility and diary requirements rather than just one of them?
---
I got 76 def but my range level might be what's killing them so fast at 95.
---
Do the diary then?
---
Is it worth starting again?
---
Haha, no diary having scrubs everywhere today
---
Is he a YouTuber? I thought he was a streamer. Last time I asked who he is, I got downvoted with no replies.
---
I'm still lost on the fact people are so upset that others can get such low level firecapes, meanwhile spending a fortune on purple sweets doing so... Like it's super impressive, but idk why I'd be upset by it. I've come to terms with the fact I suck at PVM a long time ago.
---
Real shit?
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The guy with no boots? Nah jk
---
Does the max hit dummy in poh include special effects from weapons like the lance when you smack it? Trying to test melee gear setups with the lance on it and it doesn’t seem like my actual max hit against dragons.

Completionists hate you.

---
Western has zulrah revive so you can be lazy at zulrah and kandarin is great for master clues. The desert is pretty useless, nobody uses that statue over ornate pool, it wasn't hard to get to the kalphite cave before, and desert heat is so flimsy thanks to the unlimited run options the game has that it hadn't been a factor for years. Unless you tick mine granite
---
Says the guy who didn't know dragon fruits are real
---
I've definitely looked at the rates my dude. It improves majorly over the course of 1-99 but even at 99 it's like a little over 4 minutes normally. Even at 99 you need to be chugging energy pots or sipping staminas. I'm not saying that it needs to change, but I feel like 99 agility should be more useful. Just an opinion
---
Works IRL too
---
Whip can’t train strength I thought?
---
Bro wtf
---
The zulrah fight music is pretty dope!

I had no idea it was so short until I watched a guide on YT! It’s what inspired me to take a crack at it :)

Example you can mount the diary pieces, but only if it’s the elite piece. Example you can’t mount Kandarin headgear 1,2, or 3, but you can mount Kandarin headgear 4.
---
For me it was just the accomplishments I made, the feeling it gave me in my younger days. I don’t play these days but still keep up with the community and game itself etc. I maxed out and got all the things I wanted so I don’t have the same drive I used to. 
---
But, I think a big part of my personal dopamine hit in OSRS was chilling on discord with the boys doing hood rat shit in game like raids, gwd bosses and pking.
---
Thank you and u/Certcer For explaining, it is just too shocking to believe but his new video explained it fully
---
Same with the 11. It probably don’t work on iPhones with Notches.
---
Id hate to see what $350 gets you.
---
Yea all solo's, I sucked at pvm on the normal game so when I got to raiding on my Iron I wanted to learn solo's before getting carried in a team.  It sucks to learn but once you've got the rhythm even once it gets addictive very quickly.
---
 I still even on my main game iron avoid vanguards (which i know is weird, I'm a noob and get so frustrated by them) so thats been a no go on TL.  I've also avoided vespula, but probably will start doing that soon if its late enough in a raid to have a prayer enhance.   Similarly, I wont do a raid if I theres a vasa room before being able to get/make brews, it drains through the limited food I bring in, but its super easy if you have brews especially on TL with the speed+damage perks.
---
I’m not talking about what’s AFK. I’m talking about faster.

Maxed main here.

Almost the entirety of my motivation nowadays is focused around the collection log. At any given time if I'm unsure of what to do, I can skim through it and start working on a specific goal of finishing up a boss, minigame, specific drop or whatever. It'll be impossible to ever actually complete it (mostly due to the clue scroll section) but filling up a gap every now and then is always a nice feeling.
---
No way to get past this. That being said, don't grind a bond in f2p. Just pay with irl money
---
train your strength high and then train attack and lastly defense
---
I tried training my 58 rc to 77. Stopped after 2 levels of zmi. RC BAD
---
I don't have a maxed acc im about 2100 total
---
My ears! Last time I Reddit with the volume all the way up
---
It's a hypothetical.

Hey that's cool

If you ever want a team or duo for the Kings, hit me or anyone up in my CC: Twelvey12 and I’d join you!
---
You look exactly like what I would imagine a man named Greg buckingham to look like
---
Hi normal gargoyles are a thing though.
---
Hi they don't have the drop table though.

Ikr.. like wtf

Who tf uses smooth animations? You must be some kind of maniac

Nice bro

Remember when d axe was worth 2m?

I know it's just you lumped hard and elite in together when the req disparity is huge
---
Broken neck gang.
---
Fair. Even more of a reason that 5m is a fuckin steal of a deal
---
Having to bring waterskins every time is kind of a big drag on the desert, but I wouldn't remove it. Maybe you could get a camel's hump worn in the cape slot that's charged with waterskins or an inventory item that can be overfilled past 4 swigs.
---
If you’re not with any clan or have friends, join my CC: Twelvey12 and I’d love to help teach you some bossing you can do with your current levels! Atleast bossing can take a break from the usual grind with a possible GP payout in the end!
---
But make sure they’re both at the same time to increase efficiency

He doesn’t care, he’s upset that he doesn’t make bank off the arcane scrolls and that’s all that’s important right now

What happens to people like this? Do they get banned?
---
Jagex mods are all on their Christmas holidays. Probably suggests that the system isn't as automated as they led us to believe

A herman miller chair is going to be way too expensive for most people. $1400 for a chair is not a reasonable amount of money to spend on an office chair. I can understand paying more for a task chair if you are using it for work or for extended periods of time, but paying well over a grand for an office chair is absurd.
---
what's the kingdom of misc set up for ironman?
---
That’d be Wes one I’ll definitely drop by!
---
Please jagex make magic great for once
---
My eyes are up here bwana
---
That's true. But an elite diary requirement is to craft a blood rune, so I wouldn't leave it past Jagex to use that excuse for elite diary reward :p
---
Lvl 94wcing and proud. Im going for 99 fams.
---
thats pretty nice. wouldve liked to see a pet in there
---
check out my hydra luck as of maybe 6 months ago. im about 2k on hydra now with nothing much more to show for it but that first 1200 or so was mad https://imgur.com/a/TCHaL4q
---
15 years here and still no quest cape ever
---
Yup, it seems like most of the gaming channels I watch and even some non-gaming channels have it. These guys are extremely agressive in their marketing.
---
They need to change this. I was stuck like you until a friend bought me a bond and I paid him back after I sold my items
---
Good job and I wish you luck!!
---
Imagine quoting someone 3 inches below them and still managing to misquote them.  
---
Do you work for buzzfeed?
---
There’s plenty of super nice people in our CC to help teach you anything if you have questions! Always feel free to ask!
---
I set simple goals for my account and achieve them. Right now I'm going for 99 firemaking while farming, then I'm going to finish 83-90 agility.
---
Ive got 640 kc hunting for pet. When on task for black dragons i use hasta black mask bgs spec and he can die really quick to that, east to get 7 kill trips (a full inven). When off task, my melee stats arent high enough so i use range. Ranging him off task with dragon c bow and ruby/diamond bolts i get around 5 kills per trip. Basically, whatever you just read, it gets crashed ALWAYS by a dhcb user, that is the MF THANG to use on kbd. Good luck!

Correct, they do. However, accuracy makes a negligible difference to DPS in almost all situations where magic is used in PvM. Note the wording "in almost all situations". For example, in a solo raid, at olm, with raid appropriate max mage, without augury and overloaded, your dps on the mage hand is 7.98 (or 7.80 dps without arcane). With augury turned on, your DPS only increases to 8.32 (or 8.17 dps without arcane). In raid appropriate max mage, augury only adds 0.34 dps. The Arcane spirit shield, which is like 130M, makes a difference of 0.15 dps. This is a similar story, if not worse, for \*almost\* (simply because im not calculating every boss you use mage on) everywhere else magic is used in relation to augury.
---
\*Raid appropriate max mage: full ancestral, occult, tormented bracelet, god cape (i), brimstone ring, sanguinesti staff, arcane spirit shield.\*
---
Singles clans can be in max gear because they're constantly pjing the one or two people they're chasing around in singles to the point it's almost impossible for the guy to get away. If one of them does end up dying, there's also the further chance that they'll kill the guy and get their friend's stuff back anyways. Singles clans are literally cancer and Jackblax does nothing about it.
---
Its still pretty easy with coin purses. U just have to hold down f1 and position ur coin pouch over ardy knight
---
Wish granted. Completing the diary lowers the shortcut from level 99 to levels 86-90.
---
Yep, Was totally expecting something like 
---
Desert Treasure II -&gt; Opening Menaphos + Rais III.
---
I mean at least they were consistent based on the results.. way to go jamflex!
---
Maybe try out Demon Slayer? I did it last night, it’s fun!
---
At least these are difficult to obtain and aren't just a rune armor cosmetic, they all have various functions.
---
Tera IQ
---
It doesn't even increase success, probably

I agree that POH creep is a thing but, I don't know, it seems appropriate for your achievement diary gear to be placed in your achievement gallery?
---
There are lots of beginner quests. I'd suggest going to the wiki and looking through what's recommended for beginners.
---
jamfix pls
---
Cooks assistant, sheep shearer, goblin diplomacy, and pirates treasure would be a good place to start. They should help you get further acquainted with the map

I did raid on release and wanted the prayer scroll to remain just 1 item, like it was back then, as well as it being decently rare. They split the scrolls and increased the odds at getting them to counter-act very wealthy players from collecting all the scrolls and manipulating the market. Problem was, rigour was worth the 650-500M price tag back then as it's the thing that makes the range weapons strong. Augury on the other hand, is trash and not useful for anything other than in pvp situations where your numpty ass is running from a salad robe pker. In ancestral, sure augury is good for pvp. Glad they changed the entirety of a prayer scroll for pvmers but did fuck all changes when it eviscerated pvp and made pvmers almost invulnerable in 1 update with augury and bulwark. If anything, a damage boost would make magic an actual threat in pvp and would give a much needed dps meta shake up as far as pvm is concerned. Who the hell just wants magic to be niche for pvm and only allow rigour-range scape or piety-scythe scape to be the top of the food chain.

Wave 31... bro, don’t you want a fire cape?

Did this with a few of my buds with t he intro theme. Good times

Pro tip: Open your chat box after you click on the jewelry box. You can use your onscreen keyboard to press the key shortcut for whatever corresponding teleport you need.

Got both my rings and axe from zero in 200 kc &gt;:}

Sell it and refill your fucking blowpipe
---
Thank you. I strive to make the player experience as aids inducing as possible. /s
---
But really I see OP's point. But I and other players are different. Voting does take into account the time put into a game. Now I understand there are others with vastly more play time than me but I've collectively hit 2 years concurrent playtime across 2 accounts. I've invested 2 years of my life into this game. When voting I don't take that lightly. Does that mean the person voting with less playtime quit? Seems a wee bit drastic.
---
Totally agree with you on the arbitrary sword requirements, but the woodcutting and hole requirements make sense. In theory, the trees are not identical, and would require different levels of skill to chop down. Same thing with the holes, while they make look similar on the outside, they could be more narrow or more intricate on the inside
---
7.8k atm, still dry, got hydra pet at 73 tho, rng will favour us in other places my dude!
---
Fake and gay but nice story.
---
It's half the gp/hr as TOB and the drop table is already stupid as something like 48% of your drops are going to be prayer scrolls. For the power of rigour, it should not be 45M and that drop table needs a huge fucking revamp alongside some changes to some of the items on the table.
---
Monkey Madness II
---
To use an agility short cut? Make sense...
---
OP is fishing there to afk lobbies for pet for what it’s worth
---
Have you tried 3t barb fishing? Its easily 100k xp per hour. Sharks no chance you will get 25k xp hr unless your 99 fishing and using a crystal harpoon, unless your talking about minnow fishing which I personally have never tried.
---
There is an untapped market in your eyes, you should exploit this and make the videos that are missing
---
No one is perfect dude lol. Your literally ragging him for making a mistake once every 5 raids? Shit happens.
---
The bot had been repeating this motion for 30 minutes prior to my recording.
---
Thanks! We’re gonna keep content like this coming, so keep your eyes peeled.
---
I should set that to my quick prayer, correct?
---
Do you need a to Beat a elite diary to use a sword or a pick etc
