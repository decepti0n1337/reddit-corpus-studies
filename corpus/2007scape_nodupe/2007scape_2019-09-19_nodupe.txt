Negative mage, negative range, no pray bonus, 100k an hour to use, yeah it will not be used almost anywhere
---
That and Camelot castle seem to have both been developed by some nihilists.
---
There is a zulrah bot ?
---
You should suffer for not being able to recognize every single item you need for each specific activity or not having an organized bank. So if you hit up arma gwd and forget to bring mith grapple or ecu key you should have to tele all the way back and waste all that exp for not being perfect. Or if you're mid farm run and forget payment it's your fault. Otherwise it's super op. /s
---
As someone already said, i believe is replayability. Why get the players of your game to stop playing after max, etc cause they already accomplished all they wanted? Why not reset them to 0 and let them strive for something new everytime again... and again... and again?
---
Inevitable speculation

why is the rs3 guy wearing OSRS dragon stone armour ?

I'm saying that's primarily where Pvp takes place and a lot of these issues related to pvp stem from. It'd be a lot harder to get someone that only pks in a pvp world to vote for something that's meant to thrive in a deep multis scenario at like rev caves.
---

---
My point being is the devs don't know how to handle conflicting feed back about Pvp when they don't understand it like they do pvm. For each poll that failed there where a few issues I think could of been fixed by suggestions on Reddit yet they didn't ever repoll it with that idea, or try to add a clause into the poll explaining why this or that is changed about it. It's kinda like they give up on the ideas a little faster as if knowing it's a touchy area to mess with so they tend not to do it.
---
Moonlight ay, magic pray
---
Sorry I was at work but yeah I mean vork
---
Yup I totally agree. I just started again a couple months ago on OSRS and I can't think of anything I want to do less in life than grind out early RS levels again.
---
Void sucks just get some ahrims and black dhide. And its anywhere from 1-2m an hour depending on gear and skill. And yeah its predictable because it only has 3 possible rotations, and does the same exact attacks in the same order every time
---
Drop them? Have a cool collection in your bank? Why does everything have multiple uses
---
Generally yes
---
This would be hilarious. Every yellow dot would have people on edge.
---
Even a random event! Seems like it‚Äôd be perfect for a Halloween event for a week or two in october
---
Hurrah, more RoT cancer
---
Jungle hunt
---
Wrong. It is the niche. Deep nh and clanning are the bggest types of pvp now. You are right about the devs not knowing what to do. They are trying to revive something that doesnt need it and ruining major other aspects of pvp. Most integrity pvp changes have made multi pvp worse. Clanning is massive and one of the only true social aspects of this game. 
---
The problem lies in thw ideas they pitch. Also they gather feedback from burnt out edge pk streamers and fucking ironmen

---
Trick question, drop the clue, fuck the wilderness.
---
can we stop tainting all these legitimate suggestions by adding the authenticator delay meme please? it just makes everything else look bad.
---
People already do this with HCIM, literally grinding out early levels as fast as possible to get as far as they can without dying. There is a demographic for it but you‚Äôre not a part of it.
---
I may give it a try with blowpipe and BGS just to mix it up for now and keep grinding zulrah in the off time for money towards rigour. Rigour or DHCB first?
---
nah this aint it
---
I used this all the time back in the day, can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve forgot about it for this long
---
Memes aside, as a kid I seriously used to level in the tutorial island for hours, I remember there were no level restrictions for skilling nor combat, I always wanted to leave with base 10s for some reason. It's always annoyed me nowadays how you can't even kill extra chickens at the end, I think the rats have some restrictions too.

I recently did herblore and calculated that if you were to buy unfinished potions instead of herbs, stams(4) would be the more relatively attractive option. Relatively same cost for faster xp

fully support. Give it an updated drop table so people would have incentive to keep it at bay.
---
Also bring back old death mechanics
---
Slayer, skilling
---
What exactly is the effect of higher skilling levels in the Gauntlet?
---
Ya, probably because there's been about a million and a half posts complaining about botting, LMS, and botting in LMS in the last few weeks. That's what happens with spammy posts, most get downvoted right away by those who spend their time in /new and see all the spam.
---
Should get Magma anyways to use on new helm
---
It's starting to stabilize. With the other uniques and normal drops being way better than cox, and with a good team the average completion time being significantly shorter than Chambers it'll always be worth doing. Not to mention if you raid for the sole reason of getting a tbow or scythe you're gonna be really dissapointed
---
Did you think this was a classic wow post by chance? XD
---
Funny thing is that bots solve those things better than regular players
---
(299/300)^500 ‚âÉ 0.188 or 18.8%

A bit less than 1/5 players have your luck my dude, keep trying.
---
I think he was making a joke about not having friends.
---
No haha I‚Äôve never actually played wow
---
have a few extras roam the wilderness, it's too safe. all you encounter are spades &amp; salads
---
Ah you must have meant IRL age, I don't worry about that game lol
---
Vorkath is easier to learn but Zulrah is more predictable and therefore more "afk" once you learn it.
---
? that's team sweden
---
Hahaha yeah I meant IRL. Wasn‚Äôt sure if hunchback was a character in WoW or not lol
---
Maximus Black probably
---
wah, I can't make bank off of others misfortune
---
I always bring a second spade, noted.
---
Idk which one it will prioritize to keep if I die, but I hope any would-be PKers just get 4.5 prayer xp worth of bones and a spade they can't even use.
---
Pretty sure it has 4 rotations, but 2 of them start the same way so they‚Äôre pretty similar! And I‚Äôm not sure if Op is using void for money reasons or for easier equipment swapping. But I personally started with using void too just so I could ease myself into swapping multiple items between phases. I would definitely agree though that ahrims and black or blessed dhide would be a great alternative though!
---
Cant really say whether I‚Äôd recommend zul over vork or vice versa. Vork is really good consistent cash, but I do feel like zulrah has more uniques. So athough the odds of each unique isn‚Äôt high, the odss of at least receiving one of the uniques definitely feels higher than at vork!
---
Nah, the max level is 60 in classic wow which can take quite some time to get that's what I thought you were referring to
---

Wanted the plan for iron shield spike today, none in AH, best option was a 1% chance off easy to kill low level mobs. 1% chance? Easy!
---
I know bandos is best limpwurt roots per hour but I like the afkness of growing them.
---
Why not a max world population -- 2000?
---
&gt; so what's the point of asking who has a Champion's Cape?
---
Because you should try it. Go dry on earth warriors and never experience serotonin again ever. It's 50m+ if you use bp, cannon, pots.
---
Also, hit me up next time you're dhing earth warriors in the wilderness with 6 hp and 2m+ risk.
---
It‚Äôs dropped 45m in 4 days though and seems to keep dropping. Keep in mind too that you have to split those drops with 4 people, when you can easily duo CoX only having to split 2 ways
---
I kill them because they are still like 300k gp an hour and the bank chest is pretty close by.
---
Is it still popular to hate on Emily?
---
Can add to block task for 500 points, this doesn't impact your other block list. I added them to that list, cause I hate slay and wanted it over asap.
---
But imagine being able to make instanced worlds
---
What?
---
Most people just skip the task, there's a 500 point unlock to permanently block the task without using a block slot but it might not be worth getting. If you're just going for 99 Slayer, the amount of points you spend on the unlock outweighs the amount of points you'd spend just skipping the tasks.
---
Or clan worlds

mfw I'm not big brain enough for a meme
---
So I‚Äôve got my main. Only play on it really because its an OG username login. 
---
Swapped all of my RS3 gold over to it, so I‚Äôve got like 1000 total, 97 combat, but BIS melee and ranged gear looking like a total credit card warrior. Only 90 QP even though I LOVE questing. Having good gear and medium combat stats but no quests done or skill levels throws the gameplay experience so off balance for me. Much less enjoyable than my well rounded, 1700 total ironman that‚Äôs much more ‚Äúlogically‚Äù progressed. With the main, I‚Äôll play for an hour but never know what I want to do because there‚Äôs no logical place to go with it.
---
This isnt even correct, many (me included) don't update what they are playing on discord. It's actually even higher
---
I would xfer some gp over, to help with the early grind, rates are like 5.7 a Mil atm, quests and tasks are really nice.

Rs grind is nice and steady. Wow grind for items is the absolute fucking worst if you're unlucky. Grinding one dungeon so much you out level it and seeing that one item you need drop so many times but never getting it because of bad roll.
---
Okay, I hear you. So if the idea of implementing stats would negatively affect the perception of prestige with the cape, would you also the same for perks? For example, the crafting cape provides a teleport option. Would a Champion Cape exclusive perk also affect the perception of the achievement?

You're not wrong.  I think playing with friends is what makes the tediousness fun.  I think a lot of MMOs offer that same experience.  I think a common goal with a group of people is the key factor.  So far most of the talking points for Classic Wow to me have been either complete bullshit, or just rose tinted nostolgia.  Then again I've never played Vanilla, so it's all new to me.
---
Old School on the other hand; I think starting the journey over alone after maxing is a hurdle to overcome.
---
Lol then in runescape there‚Äôs ironmen with 10000+ corp kc at 4 kills/hr to get a single item.
---
That's a fair response.
---
Do you have any advice for me regarding what to bring for my first GWD boss runs if I'm gonna choose NOT to do Making Friends With My Arm first? Should I bring anything different? Just deal with walking around without any run energy and some decreased stats for a while?
---
Why spend money if you don‚Äôt have to?

The entire experience turned sour with endless cosmetics and more items than the average player can keep up with. Last I played the game was closing in on 20GB of total disk space. No thanks.

Hire the devs, you mean.
---
Runelite is free and open source. Jagex could turn it into their official client without paying a dime if they wanted to.
---
Someone mentioned that fist of guthix had this system. Nobody was confused and everyone was way younger back then. 
---
I'm sure.... if people could understand it back then, they'll be able to understand it now.
---
Asked the same question here a few weeks ago, what I came away with was that those tasks are mostly just motivation to do Vorkath and being on task is no different from being off task. If you need some gp and were thinking of farming Vorkath anyway, might as well earn some slayer XP while doing it. If you weren't planning on doing some farming for gp, then probably not worth your time so just go kill some baby blue dragons in the Taverley dungeon. 
---
What I wound up doing for my ~120 Blue Dragon task was to kill Vorkath 80 times, and then baby blue dragons to finish it off quick once I got sick of Vorkath.
---
Did little Timmy take your shovel again?
---
Weird, unless you're low agility/mining and fail a lot. What about steam runes though? I thought it was kind of a genius idea but you didn't even adress it.

Plus authenticator delay is a red herring. It's more of a meme than it is a good security measure.

Mobile bots are a thing?

Maybe an alternate PVM world. KBD doesn't spawn in his lair, he spawns randomly in the wilderness. Same for all the Wildy bosses, with the easier ones being commonly found in sub 20 Wildy but the hard ones being in 40-50+
---
Zulrah spawning in any body of water on that side of the map.
---
Hydra roaming zeah, jad and subordinate mini bosses roaming around karamja.
---
Barrows bothers showing up randomly in settled's toilet.
---
But the full random shit sounds even better, imagine, Static bosses like zuk and olm just digging out of nowhere in any place with room at random to wreak havoc.
---
I don‚Äôt know about dumb, but it‚Äôs definitely not gonna happen, that would break so many things
---
The light puzzle one is kind of OP. Everything else is easy unless you're smooth brained.
---
Do the mining gloves effect stack with varrock armor 4? So it's possible to get 4 rune ores from 1 rock? 
---
And can the mining glove effect proc more than once on a rock? So could I theoretically get even more than 4 ores per rock?
---
Yeah I wish the chat box could be dragged to change its size
---
Excuse me, but they get banned daily. 
---
Only a few accounts last, but because it's F2P they have 0 cost on making the accounts, so they're easily replaced. 
---
If you make each account buy a 5m bond, then they'll take too much of a deep hit to actually profit. 
---
Let's say they ran the bot for 12 hours (usually that's how long they last). 
---
Every hour, let's be generous and say they earn 50 points. A bond is 5m, in 12 hours at 50 points per hour, you gain 600 points. This is enough to buy 12 parchments. 
---
Let's say, the price is 500-800k, they'll earn 6-7m, which is 1m-1.5m profit. Now, let's say we banned a bunch of accounts early, before they could redeem it. For every account that gets banned early, they lose about 5 accounts worth of profit. 
---
I can tell you that this will reduce the amount of bots significantly. The only ones who will continue to farm it, will be the ones who aren't plebs.
---
Any proof you actually used the bot?
---
&gt; why are you seemingly opposed to improving the game
---
I dont think its an improvement
---
&gt; many higher-level players have 20+ of in their bank but which they otherwise can't use.
---
they can use them though, you just plant them why are you acting like that's not a use, just because YOU dont want to, doesn't mean its not a use. 20 seeds isn't even that many anyways, [i dont even have a lot](https://i.imgur.com/myKYnj2.png).
---
&gt;If you try planting them it takes a eternity to get them used up
---
you can use 5 seeds per 64 hours, that works out to 12.8 hours/seed or almost 2 seeds per day. your number of 20+ seeds takes less than 2 weeks to use up, id hardly call that an eternity
---
lol gf account cya later nerd
---
I‚Äôm not an expert on the subject but jagex could add some hidden notification that lets them know you‚Äôre using their client, and if not you get a ban
---
Oldie but a goodie
---
$11 a month, need that job.
---
To rephrase it more clearly:
---
Monsters are assigned a drop right as they're killed and that will not change AT ALL based on the player except either for clue scrolls/untradeables since those are account-based.
---
You would be correct
---
Not everyone in that raid was lvl 60. There were people from lvl 55 upwards.

The dev's pointed out that that would mean re-making every single item model in runescape for HD textures, and all future updates would require 2 models (standard and HD) meaning a huge backlog of work to "catch up" on and twice as much graphics work for all future updates.
---
So it's for a very small minority of players?
---
Why not do a gamemode that benefits all players?
---
The old blog said they were going to make movement similar to how you normally move a character (clicking on the screen and minimap).
---
Except I have like 20 on my main and like 10 on my iron. Im a cool guy
---
It should be Karambwan. I think the person who made the video misunderstood what the catch rate for minnows meant.
---
I feel like they probably already have most of the code for  GPU rendering from the Android/iOS ports. Granted, those are probably C++ not Java, so, it's probably not very portable.
---
Maybe they could take the RS3 C++ client or the mobile OSRS client and write something new from scratch that's native and extremely performant.
---
Yeah, that just occurred to me actually
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of balancing the game for min/maxers. Eventually it will become madatory to prayer flick and gear switch and all that casual exploity stuff.

Trouver parchment, the only item to pass, is being botted heavily in F2P.

Do you often try to advertise a game to the people who already play it?
---
It used to be Xeric, but Jagex retconned it out.

I don't think the client will be Xeric again, because that seems weird to retcon it just to add it back in.

You can check how many people are 99 in each skill pretty easily on highscores or on OSRS Wiki.
---
last year there was a option to buy year member whit bonds. a event.
---
Yep they used to use that model.
---
If skilling efficiency is something you're interested in, look into tick manipulation methods. "Efficiencyscape" is a bit of a contentious issue in the OSRS community and isn't to everyone's liking, but I personally find it more fun than AFKing. Tick manipulation gives better xp rates so there's the added benefit of getting grinds done faster. The trade off is more clicking and focus. 
---
Check out the options menu - we have new options that didn't exist in 2007, such as the ability to hide player attack options and shift-click drop items. I've never played RS3 so idk what cross over there is in this regard.
---
Most commonly used method is to start the herb-tar making action between actions such as fishing of placing box traps. A guide can explain better than I can.
---
Imo one of the most impressive tick manipulation methods that has been discovered is 2t teak wcing.
---
Deeply relatable
---
&gt;They don't even need to call them something else, they can just switch the points based on your world.
---
They already do exactly this. Right now, bots need to be P2P to purchase the parchment, since it is a members item.
---
&gt;I don't see why you'd not want the bots to be gone. It takes the fun completely out of the game.
---
What makes you think I don't? Just because his suggestion is ass-backwards doesn't mean I support bots.

no, you have a 33% chance of being close to the first portal, vs 66% at blue/yellow side.
---
This number is the clients open, not necessarily players online by the way.
---
Did you do amethyst from 92-99?
---
Because you aren't understanding the point. 
---
I can go and make 1000 F2P bots, all go and do LMS. The next day, weath will ban 900 of them. He will not ban all of them, so I can replace the 900 banned with 900 new ones that I made a day before that. 
---
The 100 that lived, If they have enough points to profit after the bond being paid for, I will go ahead and use that account. This can all be automated as well, so no work will need to be done by me other than click that initial start button. 
---
BUT, if I did this with P2P, then I'd be in a massive loss. Every one account banned, I will be losing around 5 accounts worth of profits. Because of the initial bond price. 
---
Read more about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d5uxsi/botters_are_mass_downvoting_these_posts_lms/f0qj9kf/ 
---
It takes less than 12 hours to get 150 total level. Even if they make it 350TL, It can easily be done and gotten around. This is the only plausible way that can actually harm them. 
---
If nothing is done about it, I think I might actually do what I said above. Just to show you how easy it really is. 
---
If you can't make change, then force it.

Many bosses in OSRS require precision as well, though moreso when soloing bosses designed for group combat, and a few challenging solo bosses such as Zuk in the inferno, or Zulrah.

Yea, pretty crazy for only 4 days in

As funny as this is, there have already been studies that show that bot scripts are much better at solving these than humans are.
---
Tbh a pumpkin version of the Easter egg armour actually sounds dope and 100x better..
---
The only assumptions I made are that they aren't going to poll this and I'll need alt membership. And judging by the way they worded the "polling of the rewards", they already have this gamemode locked in.
---
The fact that this whole thing was worked on behind the scenes, just shows perfectly how fucking lost Jagex is. They are at the point where they have start making right decisions to keep the playerbase, and this gamemode is the exact opposite of that. No one is saying the game will end the day the update comes out, I'm saying this is the decision that starts the slow roll downhill.
---
You sound like a guy who won't realize hes at the bottom of the hill until the rolling stops.

Keep going man, may the RNG gods be with you

They already communicate with the developers of runelite and have some plugins removed. The problem is the forks of runelite that add other stuff that jagex doesn't agree with.
---
He's talking about who spilt the tea in response to the "herb getting out of hand" comment

which is not a bad thing. i quit osrs a few years ago after maxing and have been playing PoE ever since. this might actually make me come back if it's implemented well.

Read your quest log must have missed a step

Give him my xp

gw2 did not, they don't have a botting problem that's making the game worse for legit players

I would be happy to take off you the burden of BIS melee and ranged gear. I'm at 1800+ total and completly broke. It kinda throw the game off balance aswell.

Damn bruh it works on reddit

Bwana please

So you have your strength level which helps you put out higher damage yes, but you also have to take into consideration the strength bonus of your weapon + gear. At 28 strength with the prayer bonus (10%), you're only "raising" your strength by 2.8 levels. Like someone else mentioned, if you don't even want to touch your attack level, the obby maul is going to be your best bet.
---
shit sucks for the average player... honestly i haven't had as much time to play recently so grinding out 5m and still having comfortable profits is like impossible when bonds are this high
---
Make flared trousers give slayer bonuses.

If you don't mind me asking, where do you work?

Mining can be pretty Afk  so you're allowed to have your phone I can totally see it. Impressive mobile effciency.
---
I like to use mobile to make sure I get my gains while walking(I walk everywhere)
---
Not sure what you mean by prayer bonus but the prayers give you bonus % depending on what you activate. The only build I can see working with what you‚Äôve got is 31prayer and 85+ strength with an obby maul/ slayer staff. 1 attack 1 defence. No higher than 63 range. But it‚Äôs a lot of time to invest for it
---
Hi, is this for a PVP build? Very specialized strength builds are definitely a thing in PVP but are very min/max and not very new player friendly.
---
Your prayers are percentage based so they will always scale with your strength level and strength bonus on equipment, your weapon and gear will matter more than your low level prayers. 
---
Your Strength level has nothing to do with the probability of the attack landing and is only used to determine your maximum possible hit, your attack landing depends on a dice roll (like DnD) which is affected by your attack level, accuracy, attack style and the opponents defensive stats (for example if they are wearing a chainbody, that is more resistant to crushing attack styles than a platebody)
---
Yeah and we do the same thing in osrs
---
Rune make bad.
---
so what do people do after that? continue to grind it as it keeps getting easier? classic is overhyped nonsense with no endgame whatsoever. even retail with its severe flaws offers more shit to do.

Anyone wanna send me their easy ways to make good money? Just got back into the game (I played back in the day when RS2 just came out). Right now I'm just killing chaos druids in the Taverly Underground.
---
wow really added to the discussion
---
Yeah while a expansion might have been a good idea, having a quest locked that most people got with like 70-90 and like 40m total exp requirements to drop a level 70 set just didn't make much sense. It was like if you had to go and do nearly every quest in the game, Ritual of the Mahahjarat, all the quest sequels up to the game at the time, while guthix sleeps, Numerous grandmasters. (basically the equiv of probably as many quests then as osrs ever has had now), for a level 70 armor that was basically ahrims but worse with a +2 prayer bonus or something with a mace that had like some janky prayer effect but no magic bonus in a time when 10-20% magic damage boosts on staffs in 2011 pre eoc was baseline on everything from ancient staff 2011 (+10%) to chaotic staffs. That, and if the same quest also rewarded a bis spell that say, hit rapid 10s-40s and actually couldn't hit below 10 with a minimum hit, thus giving it the equiv dps of a 0-60 rapid whip/dart speed spell if you had the battlestaff of armadyl

To be fair left click blackjack isn't banable as it's just menu entry swapping. If it were banable, then so would any other menu entry swap. Certain overlays are (apparently?) banable, but undetectable.  Anything that automates anything (like prayer swapping) is 100% banable and detectable though.

You contribute to the botting problem by buying their supply and increasing their demand.

Whats the approximate gp/h of the 3 fossil wyverns with medium/max stats/    melee/range? Are they roughly the same?
---
Why not add wieldable mole claws that are essentially rune claws but with a special attack?
---
how exactly is it not fine then lmfao
---
there's nothing in runelite that's 100% necessary, and when you turn off all of the useless + handholding + ezscape overlays/plugins, it's exactly the same as playing on the official client, with gpu rendering and ui scaling added.
---
Do slayer/herb runs. Slayer will build up your combat stats to start doing high level bossing. Slayer after I would say 75+ can also be very profitable. If you don't enjoy slayer you can always do things like barrows, hunter, rcing. A lot of people like herb runs because they only take about 5-10 mins and you make about 100-200k profit, you can also do them every 70 mins. If you do herb runs also plant limps and I do yanillian hops but most people skip these because they take about and extra 10 mins to harvest.
---
Just give him all of my meth

Ah, well, I wish you very the best during this difficult time

This might actually be a good reason behind thw spike
---
Relax cc is pretty solid. Raid plenty and frequent events. They also do plenty of other bosses and everyone's pretty chill.
---
lol them rookie numbers
---
Don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure there's been talk of that long time ago and they said it's not allowed
---
Nice I got my pair on 4
---
There's a building near where I live that is like this, it used to be a prison. It has half-floors and places you can only reach by u-turning and big stairwells that lead nowhere because you need to take some tiny stairwell hidden in a nook. Supposedly prisoners who tried to escape would end up lost, giving the guards enough time to notice they're gone and catch them.
---
Ok. I worded that wrong then. Is there any server that changes the entire game? Like the sleeves of a platebody looking longer? Or is that something entirely different?
---
Now kiss
---
It comes down to how you want to play the game and your other stats. It's 100m if you stick with it but the profit per hour is very low, under a mil. If you have access to end game content , it's very easy to make 1,2,3+ mil per hour. So if money is your only objective, I'd say grind out the stats to do DS2, MM2, or Zulrah, and do that instead. If you want RC exp, then do Ourania altar and used the time saved to go do better money makers. But again, it's how you want to play the game so do what you enjoy!
---
lol why? I mean. You're already on reddit, in a thread he made. Try msging him on reddit first, or tagging him asking if theres another way to contact him directly that isn't twitter.
---
The dudes pretty responsive from what ive seen.
---
Same people who thinks that grind=skill etc. shit like that. Same with runescape I guess.
---
Someone maxed out in like the first half year of OSRS launch, which is pretty sad. And that would take years "normally".
---
"any advise"? Use the fat of your bacon to bake your eggs
---
No worries, I wasn't 100% clear in my original post.
---
Thanks man, i just want the rc cape, so ourania is not a bad idea!
---
Skilling competitions are the least appealing element of this game to me, developing an aspect of the game I don‚Äôt care about seems a total waste of time BUT maybe some people may like it.
---
Honestly why touch on things like this till you can deliver group ironman and slayer COOP overhaul, thats something the community wants, and I know its awaiting engine work, but with so many projects shelved due to the engine, and the company being a rampant financial success, why not look to expand the tiny engine team that seems to be a major bottleneck?

I need to go back and look at the questions submitted. But if one of the reasons they offer to read questions and answer them is to see what we want based on upvotes, why even bother bringing it up just to say "nah we don't think we'll do that" Or "no thanks, we don't like that idea"?
---
Isn't player driven content and updates supposed to be the premise of OSRS?
---
People keep buying the MTX devs will keep doing it.
---
And there are always gonna be streamers who buy 1000 lootboxes or whatever and kids who get mum‚Äôs credit card...

Its a futile effort trying to fight it im afraid

Most of these runes are from zmi or other rc methods, and I have never purchased a pure essence from the grand exchange. It was all from slayer and raids
---
This is around a 3 month old repost
---
Gratz dude! Now you can start the diary grind!
---
It's a hefty goal. I think the most popular method is Ourania to 77, then bloods until souls, then souls to 99. Gl it's quite a grind. I personally hate Ourania so I've just been doing tears of guthix and putting my achievement diary lamps into rc.
---
Tldr: lots of bad ideas.
---
I know, it‚Äôs like a business model or something..
---
Lol he even quoted Weath explaining how bot makers will downplay/minimize the amount of their bots banned to make their product more attractive.
---
Although he skimmed over it so fast that the video does seem suspiciously close to an ad.
---
Sound advice but not a time for cracking yokes
---
Hope you feel better mate. congrats on the pets!
---
The arm thing
---
Few of these ideas could work but when you suggest a limited number of lives many of the content creators and known players would just get camped and although that is a very low number of the players it is those who get lots of new viewers looking at the game. Also when talking about selling any buying from the GE without using your inventory is engine work and won't get done.
---
god bless you! Yeah ourania is annoying and click intensive. Thanks, i will follow your advice!
---
Nice

You'll find edgeville is quite a lot quicker to bank and return, but yeah not having to pay any attention is nice too.

Thank you! I had some background app years ago but it stopped working.

Think you're confusing the osrs community with the minority groups who oppose adding new skills because they can't fathom a game that isn't 2007scape, except it already isn't and they don't understand that.

Could you name an item in the backlog that could be implemented quickly and in the lead-up to a relatively large content release?

3rd age range top and legs have raised 8m in a little under a month.
---
Nah the original tweet says "8h" so the screenshot itself is from 2016 as well
---
I imagine it as follows:
---
-A ‚ÄúGluttonous Totem‚Äù item that you hold in your inventory or equip somewhere; When you kill a player, the totem automatically converts and ‚Äòconsumes‚Äô the victim‚Äôs inventory and equipped items into GP *(based on G.E. rates)* that the totem keeps track of.
---
-The higher the GP the totem holds, the higher your chance of valuable drops from monsters in the wilderness. (Could also cause an increase in skilling stats to help with things other than PvM)
---
-Each time a player leaves the wilderness, the totem loses 25% of the coins stored inside of it.
---
-Upon death, the totem disintegrates, dropping 75% of the coins stored inside.  
---
_____
---
-Offers a good incentive for people to PK and PvM in one sitting.
---
-VERY risky to abuse, as you already start at a net loss.
---
-Offers no value to people who want to exclusively PK or exclusively PvM
---
-Intuitive design, easily patched if GP to loot % increase is too strong/weak or the GP loss from the bag is too much/little.
---
-Offers yet another item sink that Jagex was looking for ways to implement.
---
Wow, I did not expect fremmy exiles to come so quickly.
---
I guess they must've been so confident that it'd pass (like new quests always do) that they probably developed like 90% of it before even polling it.
---
Should i point out the irony in this comment, or do you see it yourself?
---
They do that for suggestions they think are too "easy scape" or aren't worth the dev time. A lot of suggestions players make usually makes something easier for them. While some of the suggestions do make it into the polls, the Devs have to draw a line to maintain the game's health since these easy scape suggestions usually pass. The suggestions they think aren't worth dev time are usually cosmetic. While the suggestion itself isn't bad, the update probably won't bring in many players so they'd rather put their artists in to other content like quests.

Runecrafting training is impossible without highlighting where the books are.

---
Yikes I'd best do my zeah quests and get my qp Cape prior so I can do lumby elite and avoid actually immersing myself in a quest without a guide
---
I rev PK a TON, and I usually only average ~1.5-2m average overall. I have a few trips that are ~3m but unless if you have some amazing strategy, 3m/hr with rags seems a tad unbelievable.
---
It's almost as if a gaming community that plays a game mostly for nostalgia doesn't care about graphics...
---
I never even considered them if I'm honest. And truth be told I did an hour of abyss and an hour of lavas and lavas are far superior. So just sucking up the cash loss.
---
Tile markers are OP as fuck, makes pre healers zuk extremely braindead. Anyone who thinks they're not OP hasn't done any PvM.
---
Why do you even force these updates every week if you dont have any updates or changes
---
HP laptops are shit. their laptops are designed to break just as warranty goes off, and the slightest thing breaks them. my laptop charger just stopped working (and has to be plugged in at all times), like a week after year warranty. theyrer pieces of shit.  a 10 year old toshiba i had went through far worse abuse and still works. my HP broke from gently spraying a tiny bit opf laptop cleaner on it

---
I pk with 2 close friends and we hold a world kill revs and kills venes who have loot on them. Usually each kills is 300k and they get 1 ticked from dds
---
This game's updates are based on popularity. The clasical or 2007 era is long gone, so if the playerbase wants the game to move in a certakn direction they just have to make suggestions and vote On the polls. You are clearly in the minority, ppl are not asking for curses but rather new challenging content and upgrades for bis since arma and bandos have been bis for too long and apart from tbow and scythe we   havent got an iconic upgrade nor a non raids group boss since corp.
---
I heard it was enough to buy a new house
---
Yes, your max hit is determined solely by your strength level, strength bonuses from gear and any strength prayers you use. Your chance to hit is a dice roll influenced by your attack level, accuracy, gear, attack prayer and the opponents gear. 
---
The comment below me claims.
---
&gt; Increasing your max hit increases your overall hits as well 
---
This is true insofar as it means you have more available numbers to roll for as opposed to just a 0 or a 1

How do bricks burn?
---
I dont really care about the leagues thing but I unironically prefer the new quest idea over fixing some of the mentioned issues because, in all honesty, I dont really feel like said issues are impacting my gameplay right now
---
Okay, so I'm just going to throw some random numbers out in a hypothetical situation.  
---
  
---
Say my max damage is 6, and after turning on a prayer, my max damage is still 6. Does this mean turning the prayer on would do nothing, since all outcomes from 0-6 are equal in either case?
---
People will try deadman but no one actually wants to play it, its stupid as hell. Main pking with harsh penalties were you can be attacked by any level. They cant even get players to do regular pvp.
---
Why are my 2 favorite games from 2007? Jesus
---
Community is divided enough. I think if Jagex did this, about half of the RS3 community would drop rs3 and only a handful of osrs players would play. End result would be dead rs3, attracting few new players and potentially forcing microtransactions on osrs or osrs2.
---
Why are you always so vitriolic to the people who run this game?
---
Salty because this is the OSRS sub, and you posted something relevant to RS3. Grats in the long time enjoyment. If my original account wasn't hijacked and banned for botting, I'd be a few months away from the big 15 too.
---
I just play my alt. It‚Äôs been helping me grind a lot of rcing levels easier. Almost 98 :)
---
Awesome, man!
---
it passed tho
---
There will be a guide on the wiki less than 10 hours after release bro, theres no reason to panic.
---
Just give me that RS without summoning and you'll not need an update for the next year or 2.
---
Good fucking times.
---
The game is hugely different even from 2015/2016 it's so much easier to do things nowadays.  For me, though it's not so much that I don't have the time but I don't play RS to be competitive.  I've just never seen or enjoyed it in that compacity.  Other games fill that niche pretty well between RL, CS or LoL.  I know this is subjective but how can people have fun 3 tick mining for multiple hours to try to get a record.
---
Make money in-game. If you use decent methods which nets you 500k an hour, you get a bond in 10 hours of playing. This means you have 2 weeks time to do money making method(s) to upkeep your membership.
---
Mod wolf hurt you didnt he?
---
I mean, isn't that what they have been doing? Marble Lecturn, POH Advertisement Board, Fremennik Exiles, LMS Rework, BH Rework, and such have all been things on the backlog. And Group Ironman is already indirectly in the works; the Engine Team is working on the back end changes needed to write a clan system which is needed for group ironman.
---
This makes the most sense, thank you!
---
Unfortunately, those brainlets dont realize you can't show 15 years in OSRS. I havent played RS3 in ages. Thanks buddy.
---
Really cool ideas but I don't like the concept of bringing valuables into the game through random events. Maybe untradable rewards?
---
hey dont diss on pokemon go lot of osrs pkayer i know play it
---
Yep. My Rs3 account solely survives cause I can make money and buy premier each year for my OSRS account lol
---
The poll passed you triggered cunt
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre literally describing Ironman mode.
---
Make America great again.
---
Fuck your kris
---
Yes.
---
Without making it to complicate think of it this way:
---
If you can hit 6 you are gettings 2 dices. One with Yes or No and one with 1-6.
---
The first one determines if you actually hit hence the yes or no there are only 2 outcomes.
---
The second one determines how much you hit and following the example you have a 1 in 6 chance you hit 1
---
So if your max hit is 40 you have a 1 in 40 chance of hitting 1 improving your odds to hit higher numbers so it improves your dps slightly by adding numbers to your dice pool.
---
Only thing to bear in mind is that once your max hit is 40 you have a 1/40 chance to hit 40 but also a 1 in 40 chance to hit 1 which is why if you are a new player and have no clue what you are doing training atleast a little attack is a good idea
---
So the mobile ground stacking bug still exists?
---
Can you read? Just because you're not interested in the tele tabs doesnt mean they should shelve them for a later update. It literally doesnt matter and you're just a crybaby.

Agreed. Then OSRS can be recognized for what it is, RS4.

I visited Finland last June and both of these are true, according to a couple guides and books. But as far as the confusingness, after some good hard looks and looks at the castles building over the centuries, I think a lot of the confusingness of castles is due to dozens of architects and rulers just doing whatever the fuck they wanted for hundreds of years.

---
It's obvious you've used cheat clients for a long time to the point where you lost braincells, I pity you
---
This has potential. Fused essences would be an alternate way to do Runecrafting where you mine your own essences and use them by yourself. You end up with same exp/h in Runecrafting (including time when you mine own essences) without relying on monster drops or buying them.
---
If you treat a laptop like shit, its probably not gonna last long. We had an hp laptop for like 6 years and it decided to die because my girlfriend would use it in bed and block the air flow with the covers like a dummy, causing the components to overheat and basically fucked the components.

But after 6 years, it was time to upgrade anyways.

You mean after filling out all the exhibits in the museum? What makes the rare fossils different in their regard compared to small/medium/large?
---
Ignore/u/Celtic_Legend, even with good hardware this happens to me. Tired of people just blaming your pc rather than the actual client. I don't know if it's specifically a runelite issue or a jagex issue but I know people with worse computers than mine in every aspect who do not have this issue. It's likely that it's just not optimized for every combination of pc hardware.
---
You could do that, but you'd also get banned for that. That's automation, which *is* against the rules.
---
You aren‚Äôt getting 40k an hour without blowpipe and especially without barraging. Most players in 2019 don‚Äôt even get that rate
---
Yes. I log on for my free keys then log off.
---
yeah lol like i just play it because its fun, its a game :/
---
Then why the fuck are you even talking lol?
---
It's largely requiring a massive technical change to the engine to make a system happen that doesn't currently exist. Once that's done.. yeh it'll be in game... And ideally will allow for a proper clan system as well.

Ah, Team Fortress 2. Back in the day I played ton of MvM with my bros and Steam pals. We did Mann Up mode on Two Cities and made quite nice money - every tour gave us pure profit when the update just came out.
---
We haven't played TF2 for a while due MvM being too easy for us and current Mann Up mode isn't profitable. But once new tour comes out, we will no-life it like old times. :P

Gz on recoloured Zammy pet
---
I just cant fathom how it's really an unpopular opinion. 
---
Its definitvely easyscape. In some cases, it essentially provides you a pack yak in terms of additional supplies being taken to bosses through the use of suiciding with full invents of food as well as the obvious 0 risk element to PvM now.
---
However, you'd likely find 10x the amount of people that would oppose summoning being brought in to the game, so I guess it is an unpopular opinion, but I agree with you. PvM death has no risk, and it shouldn't be like that.
---
You can get 300k gp/hr filling jugs of water, how is that a good benchmark for you lol
---
Wtf is RS3?

That speculation's been going around for a long time without any confirmation. Just a notice that it hasn't been forgotten would be appreciated.

Which slayer master would be recommended for a 93 cb with 74/73/70 and 78/75 range/mage with 60 slayer? I‚Äôve only done Chaeldar as of recent but was wondering if I should move onto Konar or Neive. I guess I just want to change it up (I keep getting greater demons and iron drags atm) - not specifically trying to get drops or exp

Now offense Idk how people can play so long but make such slow progress. I made my account in June and I have 1900 total level with under 600 hours played and enough pvm for a 400mish bank

This would in no way be an iron man update. It is much easier for ironmen to do get brimstone keys and get a few thousand essence from a chest than it is to mine their own. It‚Äôs easier for anyone to do that. This is a balance update that would make mining essence actually viable for anyone. The bulk of our in game essence should not be coming from monster drops.
---
I see faster runecrafting xp, I vote no.

You gotta recover your account.

I‚Äôm not dry I‚Äôm just impatient. Bout 80 kills between me and my duo partner and nada.

All I know is the song that started playing as soon as he hits Karamja fucking slaps.
---
No. Lower level players means lower level players. 
---
Also, bots will abuse anything and issues of new minimal exploits being used by botters are not unique to this update. Literally almost every gathering skill is botted, and botting routes and tactics change all the time based on updates. Botters already auto-mine/bank essence in the status quo, and adding things like option teleport locations and the clusters of essence are unlikely make a significant change in the already low rune-essence economy. 
---
A player proposed update that is simple, revitalizes old content, helps lower level players, and would add an object useful primarily for low level players (and additionally ironmemes) shouldn‚Äôt be disregarded just because bots will inevitably exploit it, especially when such exploits would give such minimal gains compared to the status quo.
---
"Cheat clients" are the reason 90% of continue to play the game as a whole.
---
That would work both ways though: it also prevents fast reinforcements where it's needed.
---
No, they are looting bots you will be competing with for drops
---
My comments was about seeing any drops at all, not about an already known about meme
---
Well you just suck

I wonder if this rope world object existed in runescape classic as port khazard and the fishing trawler along with the gnome maze existed back then. I will run through some replays of rsc and see if those things do exist. From what I rember though the trawler (in all stages) did not have anything on the floor.
---
I mean I guess it could, depends where the reinforcements are. I don't really know enough about castles and how they were managed to argue that one.
---
Back then people would only fight other fighters as that would mean you conquer territory: it's not about conquering people. People die soon anyways, and you can just proclaim breeding to be good for the god to get more people.
---
It's only the mormons and yewish people who started fighting about "people".

Lol kid, you confused?? Jagex supports 3rd party clients.

What client do you use?

they were even 650-700k my friend, you clearly didn't play back then lol.

haha yes

I bet you like splitting spades

wtf i thought these were 10m when i quit playing 2 months ago...or maybe im trippin
---
Some people just wanna bitch
---
Leagues are actually the perfect vehicle to test updates in a controlled environment before they make it to the main game. E.G if they made a league where there are world events like rs3 has, it would be a good way to see how that kind of event actually influences the old school version of the game.
---
Well what do you do while scouting other clans in the rev caves... surely bot stand around to be logged in on. Its the same reason clue scrollers die. 
---
Any way have fun banking every single time you get a drop lol... if thats fun for you.
---
I wouldnt mind if it, much like skotizo, didnt drop special gear but had a really high chance to drop a pet
---
I'm willing to take the risk ahhaa
---
Is this an irony?
---
this basically already happened, since wolf and ed did most of the quest almost 2 years ago, they just put finishing touches on it recently
---
They'd move on.
---
i just got 75-85 woodcutting for elite diaries and i was thinking the same thing, pretty unusual that you can clean the rare fossils and they show different bone parts as well as the big open area in the museum blocked off. I have a good stack of them that i refuse to use for prayer because just like using slayer heads, its not worth wasting a valuable drop on petty xp

&gt; Trust me from a long experienced botter. jagex 2018 banning system is 100&amp;#37; accurate, I'm not saying it's 100&amp;#37; accurate in detecting bots / macro's but when it does trigger its because you were definitly using a macro/bot.
---

---
Lance will be more gp/hr as it costs far far less to operate than Blowpipe. Definitely go with Torso and Obby legs, it's going to be harder to tank the melee and ranged hits than if you had Bandos. Also, if you're planning on using divine super combats, it's worth checking out the dps calculator to check if you'll want tassets or justiciar legs in the future. With maxed stats/max strength in the other slots, justiciar legs are the same dps as tassets with divines, since the tassets only gave a max hit once the super combat started wearing off
---
Should just be 30x level since genie is 10x and instant and dragon is 15x and not instant.
---
The difference is that in osrs we Cross the fingers to a boss drop a item, but in rs3 we Cross the fingers to the treasure hunter give us that same item
---
This is awesome! Any intention to do more of these?

Is there anything to do in Runefest besides listening to the JMods?
---
When you think you‚Äôre looking at r/XFL but it‚Äôs actually r/2007scape
---
I agree, they shouldn‚Äôt stack. However, this gentleman brings up a great point: mine for the fused essences and then take an inventory of them to the altar. So I have to ask, are these tradable? How many do they give when you break them down, as in, if I have 1 slot and I break it down, would it only fill the inv or would extras drop. These would then be competing with essence pouches depending on how much they give. But it does create a desire for people to mine for them, especially if they are untradable.

---
Why not make a competition all players can compete in fairly? Why isn't that ever an option with this game?
---
I don't think I'll vote for this idea. People already have a hard enough time playing this game casually as is, and this game mode doesn't cater to those players at all.

why would they ban clients like RL when it gives them an excuse not to be putting their time into client improvements. instead they can use their time to make seasonals, a game mode where i might have to restart my RC grind.
---
We rarely start development before content passes a poll. Design work and time happens, sure, but a lot of that can be reused to introduce content and ideas elsewhere. 
---
Fremennik Exiles was developed in Wolf and Ed's personal time. We were relatively confident it'd pass, because quests tend to, but if it didn't then it wouldn't necessarily have been a *waste* of time and resources. The personal project time is focused on a person's development.
---
Ok, but my point still stands. The point of a list with a bunch of different stuff on it is to illustrate that there's a lot of stuff that needs done. Of course I don't have a conclusive list.
---
And fuck off with the "That's a different department" argument. Fairly sure anyone with an IQ &gt;120 can handle two similar jobs within the already rather specific realm of game development. Not like I'm suggesting they retrain to be undersea pipeline welders by thanksgiving.
---
Absolutely!
---
I guess. It‚Äôs really strange that also the penalty on my account for the offence is only 3 days. 1 day ban and 3 day penalty. And I‚Äôm pretty sure that botting nowadays is a straight perm ban and if not a perm ban atleast a much much longer account penalty than 3 days.  If it was for using bluestacks I hope they will come with a statement regard it.

Overall, I definitely understand the complaint and in some ways it does bother me as well but clearly the community doesn't care that much because they still get so highly upvoted regardless of how terrible they look.

people play the game how they want... but i'll be honest, just doing nmz for 99 flats doesn't sound like anyone's definition of a good time. i imagine most of the people doing it (and nothing else) are doing it to prep accounts for sale.

Originally I had a SLIGHTLY different layout and the protruding bench caused a 2 tile walking reroute. I am pretty sure with this layout it no longer does, but then the west side bugs my OCD having a random bench sticking in the middle of the floor. Also because 1 bench would be in the middle of my house, and the eastern spot would be on the outskirt of my house and looks less symmetrical imo. You def could build 2 benches though, just looks off to me personally. Every other hotspot is built though besides fencing because thats obviously a huge pathing obstacle.

Honestly would be p fair if they locked it behind sote

There is literally nothing in the comment you responded to that was serious.

Using runes to teleport is much faster than running through here. Spirit tree is literally by the ge. Neither of these should become devalued.

1atk/99str/1def has a 5.5% accuracy with punch/accurate on 99def, and a Max hit of 11, about 0.1 dps. (4.2% acc with kick, same max hit, less dps)
---
99atk/1str/99def has a 95.4% accuracy with punch/accurate on 1def, and a Max hit of 1, about 0.16 dps. (Negligible difference with kick)
---
So it's pretty close but 99atk/99def &gt; 99str by a little bit. It would just be an RNGfest on a timer, where 99atk would just whittle down the hp of 99str that would be depending on the lucky 1shot.

No real updates for years is a main cause and I don't understand my no one seems to care. I didn't make this post to argue with pvmers or other pkers. I just want PvP to be busy again as it's all I play for.

slayer was more like 20k-25k xp/h, still incredibly slow but a bit better than 10-15 :P

What are the 8 rooms in order? I don‚Äôt really know what they are from this view.

Best mini game from RS2

&gt;There's just no way it was 30k xp/hr.

30k xp/h is always achievable assuming he used piety on all task in max str gear at the time and a cannon.

Thank you! That trick worked like a charm :)

---
Basically if you have hedges and place the wintumber tree in a certain spot, you path to the pool in a more efficient location for using spirit tree/ jewelry.
---
Although it is one more tile away from the portal nexus. Edit: technically it could work both ways if you swap the combat room and the nexus room, although I don't know if you can place 2 wintumber trees.
---
This is against the rules. Your ban won't be adjusted as a result of you appealing it.
---
It doesn't, it's just retarded and unconvenient that you have to complete a maze of shit unhelpful pages over at their "support center" before you reach the ticket system. Once you manage to create a support ticket then the service you get is totally fine.
---
Instead reddit thinks that reddit and twitter is the only way to get support.
---
Never used PvP worlds as all that seems to happen is you get rushed or atked by 15 cmbs higher. My own opinion but I've never enjoyed the PvP worlds

In the original game.  Not in classic wow.

I regret nothing xD
---
Wolf said "by the end of the month" like a week or 2 ago.
---
osbuddy existed since osrs launch so yes there were clients.
---
Someone recommended me to do that in this post and I haven't tried it myself tbh.
---
Yeah but even not stacking it would still increase xp/h not including mining time.
---
My main problem with this is mining the ess is highly afk and easy, where as normal RC (which this would replace a % of the time spent doing) isn't afk and takes a bit more time to learn to do efficiently.
---
I guess if the fused ess is somewhat uncommon it'd make this not as much of a problem
---
I want one of the relics to enable pvp worldwide so whoever gets furthest ahead can just massacre everybody

Are you f2p only or something?

Or are you purposely seeking out the slowest xp rates?

Or you play for like half hour a week or something?
---
Hunllef is my favorite boss. It makes you move around, keep track of prayers, and switch attack styles. Very fun and satisfying boss to kill, especially in Corrupted.
---
Fatality~
---
with blowpipe and barraging you get 80-90k+ slay xp/h, with only melee+cannon you can easily get 40k, even up to 50k in max gear.
---
My own personal experience was great so everyone elses must be!
---
I bet you were having SO much fun! I miss this kind of thing so much. I remember wearing my stupid impractical outfits. Making almost no progress ever but having the time of my life. It took me many years just to get a character over 80cb. Meanwhile I was 90cb in my first week of oldschool haha

Yeah I mean, the graphics were horrible even in their time, and it was still popular. At this point it's just RS to me.
---
I actually remember really liking the OG HD graphics when they came out. I'm not sure I still do, but now even those would be bad too. And Imo if they completely re-did the graphics to something entirely new it would feel totally wrong
---
Could you RC normally but also bring 1 fused essence for more rc xp/hr?
---
this would be such an easy minigame to develop, they don't even need to make maps since it takes place at rc altars.
---
please do this jagex, it would take like 1 week to make max

I'm confused though. Training methods have gotten easier, faster and with more afk options. I'm not a huge fan of that, but aren't faster rates and stuff more in your favour if you can't play much?

Plant the tree, in normal mode, where the bushes will be. Then go into building mode and add the bushes. You will be able to clip through the bushes this way, saving some extra running in certain routes.(Ie to your ring\tree)
---
Don't need it if the house is for efficiency only, better to train at the wildy altar imo anyway
---
Same somebody hacked me and I recovered it after I started back up from about 10m that apparently they took what I originally had off and start farming skeletal Wyverns lol but, Jagex responded to it fairly quick and I got it back within a couple days
---
so don't do hellhounds?
---
No, it's by far the worst skill in the game to train
---
Clean house! Mine looks pretty similar except I switched the workshop for a study.
---
Little suggestion: add layers of normal gardens so you can have trees all around your house!

Skotizo has the claw aswell for recoloring slayer helms purple

No worries I won't do anything I don't feel like doing haha, I've taught a bunch of people CoX so I don't mind helping some people out if I have the time

When the 'shortcut' takes longer than the regular path due to non-level dependant failure rates.

They have such a huge backlog and what do we get? Osrs leagues, something no one asked for

There's so much God damn engine work that needs done too

---
1-99 with mahogany (not realistic since you don't use them right away), is 205m
---
you win smart guy. block them then. i dont really give a fuck.
---
I just don't see the point.  I don't think Runelite is that OP to be honest...  Why do we care how other people play the game?  It's almost like we're not playing the game for enjoyment anymore, now all the sudden we're all arguing the "right way" to play runescape.  The right way to play is to log on and have fun.
---
That's a totally different suggestion but sure. I used to think Seventior Disthine Molenko should be an unlockable phrase to tele there tbh lol.
---
Nah, RC is just a very slow skill and requires tons of work comparitively. Mining has similar rates but very little running around, and you have the option to powermine iron for faster rates without banking.
---
Agility is basically nothing but running, but your stamina restores during obstacles because it counts as walking/standing so with full graceful you almost never hit 0 energy. Also doesn't require menuing or banking.
---
RC meanwhile has terrible rates (which can only really be sped up by hiring ess runners) and lots of running around with almost no stops (which requires stamina pots) and varied clicking (so you pretty much have to be paying attention 100%) for the fastest rates with lavas. It's by far the most intensive skill to train for rates that only match far more afk akills.
---
I honestly don't mind using ZMI for the less intense training but the rates there are only around 60-70% what I could be getting doing lavas.
---
I see the black background but where is the yellow text?

&gt;If you've got an authenticated client, that will resolve 3rd party clients, so reflection bots become impossible to use.
---
That's not true in the slightest.  How would this stop a reflective client from posing as the authentic client?  That's kind of the point of reflection.  To modify things at run time.
---
&gt;And if you're using osrs official client with certain runelite client features inbuilt, graphic bots won't work, if you knew what you were talking about you'd know they literally don't work for osrs?
---
Despite the fact that the official runescape client uses the CPU instead of a graphics card, there is still a graphics data being written to a buffer.  So yes.  You could still read graphical data from the original client.
---
&gt;The only recaptcha solvers are open source and work with browsers with editable text. They simply cannot work with an official client with locked coding. So no, my point stands lol
---
Not only is it patently untrue that recaptcha solvers are "only" open source, it's also untrue that they only work with browsers with editable text.  It might take a little bit of work, but I can all but guarantee you the code doesn't mystically stop working the instant you try to apply it to anything outside of a web browser.
---
did you just line it in magic trees lol? That's actually brilliant and keeps me within the 4x4 2T load still!
---
Runelite is still under active development, which means that they are continually doing work which Jagex does not have to do.  I don't see how you could ask for anything better given that resources for osrs seem to be spread pretty thin compared to back in the day when there were major updates every week.  I don't think Jagex has a choice but to allow the community to develop its own clients, which is what Runelite is -- Community members who care enough to develop a client pro-bono.  But somehow the knobheads are still complaining about it.

Was almost impressed until I seen him using AHK macros, the speed at which he withdraws is literally impossible (very noticeable at 32 secs), I'm not sure if he's doing 1:1, my guess is he isn't because he literally deposits bars and withdraws a stamina and gold ore in 1 frame.

No, it's not. They removed it for good reasons.

Your opinion. Unpopular for a reason. Not every has 100% uptime on their internet. Plus UIMs rely on the 1 hour death timer. Plus DDoS attacks are a thing. Plus once again, I don't want to lose years worth of progress because of a disconnect. Call it easyscape, I call it quality of life change.
---
Getting offed by a random Shade spawning when you bury bones used to be a thing too. They took out unfair randoms that can drop you in a tick. Why? Quality of life, unfair mechanics.
---
I'd be game for letting your inventory stay on you when you die in non-PvP areas/situations.

how is that an argument?, if getting stam pots for training RC is bad then training combat is the worst thing in the world because of the countless consumables you need to get

So before the free memb trial week thing got removed, I fooled around with an iron that I later abandoned. But stupidly forgot to cancel and now it has a full month of membs. What can I do with it? I don't pvp. Only thing that comes to mind at the moment is to de-iron it and use it to supplement my main in buying past the GE limits.
---
So you want them to be untradeable because they‚Äôre expensive and you can‚Äôt afford three of them. If they were untradeable you‚Äôd have to go grind zalcano for the seeds. Now here‚Äôs my confusion. Why can‚Äôt you just go grind zalcano for the seeds anyway?

Sorry. I failed to make my point clearly again.

I'm estimating the distance for running lavas as about twice as much as a single blast furnace run. Using that estimation, smithing is about 3x as much exp by effort as runecrafting in my hypothetical scenario. Runecrafting is poorly balanced against smithing. Which is made worse, as you point out, because smithing also offers cheap, afk methods to train, with comparable rates to max efficiency runecrafting as it is now.
---
To be fair, most things on the backlog are all engine work, so devs that dont/cant do engine have spare time to make new(sadly not always complete) things

How I see it, one fused essence is 3 ess. Go to an altar with a chisel and 2 empty inventory slots. You'd be able to do 75 ess per trip BUT you'd have to break them up individually to make inventory space. Also, won't fit into pouches.
---
I'd make fused essence untradeable but a fairly common mining drop. Also, mining ess should give a small bit of RC xp. This will motivate players to do it and keeps the bots out.

nah ferocious actually adds a substantial amount of dps over barrows gloves if you have above like 90 att and str. the thing about ferocious is if you own a scythe, your dps will be higher with full void against bosses like tob which is kinda a meme. the thing about tradeables is you can always sell them back so like you can buy whatever you want tbh if you can afford. Honestly all im saying is my bank is 150m away from a tbow rebuild opportunity and i feel dumb for buying avernic 2 months ago when i was around your value. To be fair  though i could still buy a t bow but i have about 90m or 7 more hours in mahogany planks away from my untrimmed construction cape(this untrimmed has been carefully planned with other stats around it for over a year), but to me the flex of an untirmmed construction cape is worth more than a t bow so buying avernic is compareativiely up to preference.

I'm not sure what would be bottled next, but I really don't think vorkath is a concern. Requires Dream Mentor, Legends Quest, And 200 qp? Not including stat reqs? I'd sincerely hope that a bot would be caught before it even had half the reqs. I'm not sure what money maker would be bottled next, but Zulrah is by far the path of least resistance currently by a huge margin.

Throwing knives are balanced to be center balanced. Whether you hold them by the handle or blade at the start of the throw depends on how far from your target you are.

Meanwhile Stamina potions last 8 runs.

They haven't fixed this yet?

Imo, if zulrah got quest locked right now, most hold farmers would switch to barrows.

When it comes to vorkath, you're right. The reqs are probably a little too high to consistently bot to.

OSRS is now more of another route that Runescape could have taken. Yes originally it was just a backup of the game from 2007 but that can only last for so long. People came back to check out the old game but didn't really stick to it until they started updating it. I'd also have to disagree with what you said about it basically being RS3 in a different dimension. RS3 has EoC, an entirely different combat system, and loads of MTX, both of which are not and will never be in OSRS. RS3 also has activities for each skill that give much much higher xp rates than what you can find in OSRS, and yes there have been updates buffing xp rates a bit in Old school, but not so much that its become too easy. I don't think games getting updates is unreasonable, even for a game based around an old backup. The community votes for things going in the game and most seem to enjoy the new and refreshing content, but I'm sorry if it hasn't turned out the way you expected.

On MEP2 with lv70 agility, you‚Äôll fail the handholds on average roughly ten times in total throughout the quest, which makes you lose a bit of HP directly, causes you to run through shades (HP or Prayer loss), the running drains your stamina, and saps your sanity as you fail on the final handhold AGAIN.  
---
I didn‚Äôt *struggle* with MEP2, but the shades combined with 17.7% success rate at handholds (Probably less since I think I was lower level agility at that time) caused me to need to bank once.  Not the worst thing, but it was firmly in the ‚Äúannoying‚Äù category.

She's more of a gear fight than mechanics if anything, i struggled really hard with her when i used zammy cape, zammy book, glory ammy, sea trident, mystic robes, farseer helmet, barrows gloves and beacon ring, i tried her multiple times but i could only get her down to 200 hp no matter how much i optimized the strategy with when to drink pots and such, but a friend borrowed me some ahrims and toxic staff and i got her down on first try.

It's balanced by the fact that the female HAM member only makes 75% of what the male HAM member makes, so you're stealing less GP from the female.

77 is when you start rcing bloods ? I hear its fairly afk and yields about 500k gp and upward of 35k xp per hour?

---
If you're getting 36k an hour at zmi then I'd argue it's not afk at those rates. You get maybe 15 seconds to look away from your screen before you have to focus for another 20 or so seconds to craft/tele/ladder/bank. Zmi is much more active than any of the afk mining/wc methods for slower or equal rates.

As a minigame, NOT a skill. The Gauntlet is absolutely amazing, but it's definitely an end game challenge. Maybe introduce other gauntlet type challenges through other questlines for the early and mid game.

Idea:

Lets say that the Fused Essence gives a variable amount. Say, 2-6 essence per.
---
Perhaps you could trade it with most wizards and get a guaranteed lower rate. Take it to Aubrey and you get 3 Noted for every 1 un-noted fused.
---
With this you could also make it so a higher crafting/magic/mining/runecrafting (I dunno which) level affects how much you get from it doing it yourself.
---
Along with that, you could potentially make it so NPCs in locked off areas give better guaranteed exchange rates,  such as the crafting guild or magic guild

In my book blaming someone with better hardware for being able to do what others can't sounds like blaming someone with more free time being able to skill more than others, but that's just my opinion.

That's literally impossible to deduce though. And a few false positives would create a huge backlash.

They are more akin to shortcuts though, and basically they're already there.

I would almost consider mining essence at that point lol, I like it.
---
join the soa clan chat theres always someone there that can help
---
Yeah they're ugly.
---
I don't think this is a real issue - if you're training mining by mining essence, I don't see an issue with it making your RC slightly faster. I really don't see this breaking RC if they're untradeable.
---
Can you look into ‚ÄúTRE N‚Äù please. Posted multiple appeals.
---
Good luck man. So worth it. I just played podcast and if you use a large resizable window you can even watch YouTube once you get in the rhythm. I got to where I didn't even have to look and could see everything out of the side of my vision. When I saw the brown blob (table) I knew to hold 1, when it went away I knew to hold 6. Build 2 then you see the big red blob of a Butler you barely move your mouse up and hold 1 and click.

I think what he does would be achievable with 1:1 macros. Right click on 'q', drop down on 'w', left click on 'e'. Rolling the three keys quickly is an almost instantaneous withdraw, and it's achievable with mousekeys.
---
I wish you posted this a few hours earlier haha...ha 
---
I predicted it to be worth 600m a few weeks ago before crash (check post history, got the receipt) but now that I have it I can see that it‚Äôs worth 200-300m Max. (I‚Äôm banking on new quest/boss next week to shoot up price tho)
---
it's based on things i've searched in the past
---
There's no way it's 30 hours. I'm at 45 which is about half way to 55 and that's only maybe 4-5 hours of lavas
---
Sad MF posting this on Reddit
---
Cat looks like OP
---
Hell yeah thanks for the info. Definitely easy with taking breaks for the hand every 45min-hr lol
---
Yeah I get that but prayer is such a ludicrously fast skill to train even at chaos altar.
---
Saving yourself a couple hours with poh instead of saving millions upon millions is retarded unless you're planning to go for 200m and have a giant cash stack to burn
---
He's on a 5 tick attack cycle. If youre talking about the fireball, which I think you are, you have 6 seconds if you look away the moment u see him use a non fireball attack until the fireball would land if it were the next attack after that one. So given you need 1 tick to run 2 tiles away, every attack that isn't a fireball is 5.4 ticks of afk. 
---
The same is true for the purple dragon fire. 
---
Realizing this made vork a lot easier for me to multitask at.
---
This is literally how I got banned he has an auto hotkey to make his mouse go to a certain point on screen... Even doing this manually the client picks it up as a bot since u can't see the mouse move to that point.
---
What about the guy's duty of care for his own life? It's not reasonable to make corporations act like parents if someone fucks up with their money.
---
Jagex... Also bad?
---
Most bots aren't level 3 anymore.
---
I want to personally strangle every person that makes "we're leaking" posts
---
You're fucking ignorant as hell if you think pre 75 lavas are 44k. They are 60k or so. Also zmi isnt afk, again, ignorance is insane with you.
---
That's not entirely true any more. Jagex are detecting people playing it safe, and people suicide botting. Sometimes a suicide botter will go undetected, sometimes a safe botter will go undetected. It seems like what it comes down to is the client and the quality of the script(s) used. It used to be true that you could avoid bans by botting like a player would play.
---
that can not be good for you
---
Just start adding them on Facebook and show up to their house with a 6 pack in one hand and a bottle of baby oil in the other.
---
Holy shit. I've been playing since before it was added. I never really realized how early I started.
---
I never understood why they did that and not at the handle. Were they just lazy?
---
I loved Underground Pass! I thought Monkey Madness was more of a pain.
---
That was an intentional move by jagex to make botting p ess pointless
---
You said it delays the special attacks. It doesn't
---
Hung out one day after work and he had the OSRS browser open and then we‚Äôve hung out almost everyday since then ü§ôüèª
---
That deserves meritorious promotion
---
I'm 77 rc from lavas it does take 30 hours. As much as the YouTube videos tell you that you get 70k xp h you don't. And it's such a boring grind
---
I too enjoyed it
---
That sounds *hard*
---
If I could get 60 y'all can get 55.
---
Astrals aren't that bad and you get a little money from it.
---
~48 hours is supposed to be quick for 61 rc?...
---
My rc is 77, I meant Inc for him
---
I shidded and farded and peed and camed
---
When you say personal time, does that mean they did most of the work at home, on their own time?
---
Maybe because weight reduction literally doesn't matter below 0 so wear whatever works best for you
---
Right but we're talking about 55 aren't we?
---
Ok for some reason I thought you were speaking about the present, my English is not that good.  
---
Would like to clarify that the word multiboxing and multilogging can be similar but is not the same. Multiboxing is usually considered when you replicate the mouse movements / clicks in multiple windows at once (which although not written clearly, seems to be against the rules), while multilogging is the act of having multiple windows logged in.
---
Slayer trains all of your cb stats and unlocks bosses which can be fun tho. Rc is literally working a job. No enjoyment, just mindless grind for a level you need to enjoy a part of the game
---
AND with Ibans, jesus
---
i runecracted my way to 10, then i realized how boring it is and haven't done it since
---
use arma for sure if you have it. 
---
also tbow if you have it and if you realllly want to go arma cbow...i wouldnt recommend going with a worse weapon than that
---
They're two different things? It works for the clue step but not the diary task
---
üò≠üò≠When you use bp and 2 is still a decent trip.
---
It's the client that can't handle it. When there are too many players in an area it disables idle animations for faster rendering.
---
U need the full prospector for the Falador Hard diary.
---
The Varrock 4 Armour gives only xp
---
Thats not why it was made or ehat it is mainly used for as you states, but it would work
---
Oof. 55 rc req. See you next year exiles.
---
Lol
---
I don't like the lvl requirement for using different teleports. That would ruin the enter the abyss miniquest an essential part of the early runecrafting levels if I'm correct. apart from that I like it
---
Like full body characters?
---
Eh I've doing pking and rushing for years even b4 I got pmod. I dont see whats abusive about this personally.
---
It's not, just playing the clickbait game.
---
Gz btw
---
My ass it is... Zalcano is around 2m/hr with average luck on drops. I should know since I been farming 10m a day there for the past few weeks. Consistently takes me 5 hrs/60 kills
---
I think op is asking if the varrock armour 4 can be used and still gain the bonus experience from the full outfit. To which the answer is yes, the only thing the second line is saying is that for the falador hard diary where u enter mining guild wearing the full outfit, varrock armour 4 cannot be used. So long story short you still need to buy prospector top,
---
zolcano
---
Oh fair enough lmao, thnx
---
I like the idea but would rather just have a deposit box there.  Not like p ess is worth anything for bots to farm
---
Must be hard not being able to read
---
God I've been grinding RC hard... All I see when I close my eyes now is pure essence
---
See thats where shot gets messy, i‚Äôve had an exactly similar situation to you (account hacked, botted on, perm banned), and upon submitting a recovery request, i was able to retrieve my account and the offence was quashed.... this shit doesnt make any sense.
---
Make it stackable for ez 99
---
Four numbers could have saved your bank.
---
Wait are you suggesting replace the Zulrah kill req on the diary (which has easy reqs) with something that requires 93 slayer? Am I missing something here? Besides killing a thermy is already on the elite diary for wp.
---
Over 6k slayer boss kills no friggen pets reeee
---
Yeah. Kinda sucks as I had the account since 2011, but nothing I can do about it it seems.
---
I'm glad you got your account back though.
---
This meme format is like the superior that appears after you kill 200 inferior meme formats
---
Nahh, its a tablet lol
---
Level 55 is only 166k total xp. That can be knocked out easily in a day lol and while doing nature runes which will make like 600k gp/hr
---
What part of this has anything to do with that sub?
---
The exp rates are what people actually hate.
---
There's a (maybe) future update for them that will give them additional uses. Up to you whether you want to hold onto them or not, but personally I would.
---
Jagex needs to step it up by allocating more resources for fighting botting. It is impossible to eliminate it 100%, but the amount of bots that are currently present is unreasonable.
---
Little bit of technique in there as well
---
Yes indeed, I remember there being lots of bots. But since I was younger at that time, I did not really care. For some reason, now I do.
---
I like.
---
Is fused essence going to be that frequent?
---
That's like claiming playing the lotto is ¬£500/h because after 15 years you might win the jackpot. It's slightly misleading that's all I'm saying.
---
*YOU* cant smith coins, but someone can. Anyone could smith a coin of gold, but only the bankers have the mark of Gielinor stamped on the gold to make it have real value, otherwise it would only be worth its weight in gold which apparantly isnt that high.
---
Very clean.
---
I'll copy this for when I get 99 con on my UIM with a couple more additions for a 4x4 house.
---
Yes! Nobody ever notices!
---
Figuring all that out, and taking time to read the how and why just took up all the time you could have possibly saved by doing this
---
Oh, yeah I don‚Äôt need to pray on this task
---
I don't play POE but I do follow it, and I like the way they do seasons. I think this could be fun and even though I'm not ultra efficient I think this could be fun. Gonna have to wait to see a more complete concept before I say for sure though. I don't personally feel it's a stupid concept as a lot of other people are saying, just to add my two cents
---
Hahaha my man - this made my day!
---
Yeah, but the bow is still "the same one."
---
String it &gt; Unstring it (lose the bow string) &gt; Get new string &gt; String the same bow and repeat.
---
Really it's just gold farmers making a living.
---
I‚Äôm ready
---
Pretty sure 70% bots. Dont think anyone p2p is going to have a f2p alt since every money making method is garbage
---
I was tbinking, how the fuck u kick a 57??? 
---
Then I remembered the damage number rework lol
---
outlier boomers like trump yh
---
Fat guy strength =/= swole
---
You kinda have to get good at escaping first imo. I think once you feel confident with your escape routes and doing what you normally do you can start adding on to that. But naturally that's the next step.
---
Your goal isn't to kill them, it's to keep pressure on them. You don't need to bring full on pk gear. Often I just go with d scim and rune crossbow. I like to make use of d scim spec cause I like doing venenatis a lot and sometimes you just get lucky and she stacks. Just try to stress them out, or slow them down in anyway.
---
I think people are stressing this pvper vs pvmer thing too much and not just engaging with the wilderness the way it was meant too be engaged in. They think of Pvp as this thing that exists in its own little pockets like bh, or pvp world's when it's much more organic and engaging in a different enviorment.
---
Thanks man! Appreciate the details. I‚Äôve just always thought it was sick looking so I think I‚Äôll keep grinding it out, even though it might be losing value
---
best not let me catch you in the wildy son
---
69 here, contemplating of never leveling it again.
---
haha i get it cos they're fossils
---
Well I won't provide you with proof, but you can look across the websites yourself if you so choose.
---
gottem
---
0:58 without any specs but in bis gear at 95 range
---
This just reminded me that I used to mine essence. For money. Back when I first started playing runescape 2 around the time it came out.
---
Damn. I even remember the guy who bought them all from me. C2005cobra. I think. He was a good friend and helped me a ton when I was a noob. Those essence paid for my Addy and rune armors. Him, and his buddy darkblue3 were my buddies that I talked to every day and they helped me all the time. They always came to hang out me and show me all the runescape things. 
---
Bro even bought me a new Addy armor set when I fell for the armor trim scam.
---
Damn. The nostalgia. I think ima go play some osrs. I wonder what those guys are upto these days. Maybe we've passed eachother in osrs and never knew.
---
You've got my (up)vote, unlike Justin Trudeau
---
Many people don't look at those
---
No worries, I also thought it was the same. I think in wow is allowed, hence the wider usage of multiboxing over multilogging.
---
Just got 55 for this quest I‚Äôm soo excited!!!!
---
Remember, the governor of Virginia is still in office, free pass for lefties!
---
Piece of cake. I swear a lot of y'all have never heard if Netflix before.
---
Full body or heads?
---
How many children play and have played runescape? How many have been introduced to gambling at a very young age in a game designed to be a MMORPG. He was obviously not in a fit mental state when spending $62,000 and should of never had the ability to do so.
---
Sounds like a troll
---
replace all manta ray drops with sea turtles, ez
---
I agree and I love slayer. I'm just saying people think RC is ungodly slow and tedious when really there's multiple skills that slow (agility is a great example of a skill just as slow with even more input required)
---
A lot of them still hit r/all as well so he‚Äôs not wrong, drama does the most but a lot of random shit ends up on there as well. Depends on the day honestly.
---
Yeh unfortunately at Ven it's far better to just teleport, because if there's 1 there could be more and they can spear you into multi even from the singles safespot.
---
Callisto I've definitely managed a few anti-pks :)
---
I need the cape perks :P best one for UIMs
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôve done fashionscapes If heads and stuff :) I do logo work so full body doesn‚Äôt normally work out all to well for that
---
Why do those arms in the 2nd pic look like dicks?
---
took a little more work on the 4x4 house but to anyone thats having trouble just move the exit towards the opposite side of the border that you want trimmed. If the south border is too big but the north border is good move the exit north to trim the south ect.
---
Is it weird that I oddly didn‚Äôt hate RC that much? I mean granted, I only got it to like 50 or whatever req I needed for a diary and moved on, but I didn‚Äôt really hate it that much. Everyone told me it was gonna be horrible, and I ended up making some decent money and I didn‚Äôt even hate it that much.
---
If your going to complain, hit the drop rate first.
---
I agree - it's a good point that wildy pvm/skilling is a lot about the mindset.
---
I'm both a main and a pker. Since I've been pking I know that pking is very click-intensive but very easy to kill wildy pvmers. For that reason I find it very enjoyable to actually tank and get away from a team of 3-4 ppl in deep wildy.
---
The "that's different department" argument is exactly the truth. You can tell it to fuck off but you clearly have 0 understanding of the skillset.
---
Some of these content Devs have extremely limited knowledge of the inner workings of the engine. And simply understand the RuneScript language to develop content. Make dialogue, make NPC path, award XP, create item. Etc 
---
That's like saying the artist should just "stop drawing and go and write some code". You're a moron if you seriously think development.. or in this case literally any work force operates like this.
---
If half the video isnt the subject hes talking about its way harder for it to be copystriked and or taken down, and if it does get copystriked he can deny the profits going to that company, at least thats the explanation i saw on another post
---
Go chaos ely where the drop is 1/200 and quit complaining. You‚Äôre literally 1/4 of the drop rate.
---
Ask a chubby person to push his arms against his side and lay his forearms on the belly and it will look exactly like that. It's not muscle, but fat being pushed to the side.
---
Source: am chubby but not muscular.

Runescape is akready a casino thanks to the duel arena which honestly does way more damage than mtx can ever do

Welcome to the suck, new fish. 
---
Now go out there and train
---
In that time I can manage to do a vorkath on two accounts at once. But it's so stressful and unreilable that I won't even dare to try it once again. Lmao
---
For me, that doesn't trim - it just switches where the extra grass is. I have a shit ton of grass on the SE corner, so I put the exit portal to the NW corner. After moving it back to the center of my house, the extra grass is in the NW corner rather than the SE corner. Must be different for a 3x3 house.
---
It's an easy mistake to make. Assuming that the poll results on the official game website should be accurate isn't some 3 iq move.
---
Oh okay well thank you for the insightful response my friend.
---
no you dont lmao. 90k an hour is only possible with a perfect blocklist, cancelling any non efficent task, using bis gear/camping rigour. Banking very fast, getting new tasks very fast etc etc. VERY VERY few players actually get 90k an hour. The average rates in 2019 are probably closer to 25k an hour.
---
100% get the BGS first, the spec will speed up your kills tremendously
---
Hes unfortunately right. Theres a ton of "Well ill still vote for the libs because no cons." when they could just vote ndp. Im really disappointed in the center left of canada rn for being as hypocritical as the right.
---
Except all the stuff we vote no on that gets implemented anyways
---
I would not swing as far as to say 90% of the playerbase is uninterested. Just look at DMM success. Most people know they have near 0 chance of winning the money, yet thousands flock to a time limited mode that deletes your account afterward.
---
This is the same concept, just not focused around a big final PvP battle.
---
I myself won't really be too interested. But that's because if I want a hyper entertaining game I don't play RS.. or I do things like Raids and such. RS is a game I like because of the consistent progression.
---
People who state facts?
---
I must be bad then, I'm at 99 range with rigor. Although I can't do the Woox walk yet.
---
Not worth it if he's not going for 200m all? Also, forgot that most people play bankies.
---
Neither of those is faster. Could use crafting cape for bank, or heck even a glory and run into edge bank is faster than running to find the butler/ring bell-pull. Butler doesn't render right next to your character. There might be that off chance he renders next to you but in the long run knowing exactly where the bank is to click, will more than make up for the 2T delay in using an extra tele.
---
You should be using a normal anti-fire shield. It allows you to use protect from range, which is better than protect from mage, as the range attacks occur more often, and hit harder.
---
I too need this answer because I had the same question and never got a solid answer.
---
Arma is definitely better but you‚Äôll still need Sara and zammy items, god dhide works good enough though
---
And only one sleeve at that!
---
0.005 or 0.5% then, 1/200 is more impressive.
---
BTW
---
"rc bad, rc slow" has gotten really tiring. Honestly, I'm waiting on more quests with actually decent level requirements. It's nice to see people actually have reason to train skills they might not have otherwise.
---
The gnomes captured a soldier at Port Khazard, using nearby rope to bind him. They brought him back to the village.
---
Ah gotcha. Yeah I'm using dhcb now so maybe I'll stick to range and get the blue dragon kills through there. Sucks that the slayer helm isn't able to be better utilized here at vork.
---
This is the main thing holding me back from doing this quest.
---
Does anyone know who it was that spent that $62k? For all we know it could've been some rich dude from Dubai who has "fuck you" money. I've seen a couple of news articles concentrating on that 1 dude who spent a lot of money, but I don't think that really  gives a lot of perspective on the problem.
---
He kills all the brothers and opens the chest.

Then you're not base 90s, are you?

I fucking love this subreddit

Someone asks who is Justin Trudeau, and instead of just answering the prime minister of Canada. He injects a bunch of political rhetoric and unnecessary shit into his answer ending with "because he's a liberal"

how in the world did i come to that conclusion i wonder

It‚Äôs only just half past midnight here when you posted this.  Wait until the working day?

We all gotta reply room scape now

When you‚Äôre sick of being called a runescape nerd

Bp is also much slower than dhcb unless you get really good specs
---
Boaty is quitting wtf?

Probably because he‚Äôs a staking streamer, and if he doesn‚Äôt RWT it still makes his community look bad.

Inevitably?

Memorizing the last two zulrah rotations so I can stop teleporting out. I‚Äôm way late to the game getting a blowpipe..

I‚Äôm trying to get 99 herb and I‚Äôm 82 atm and I keep seeing people say at 84 do recovery specials but what are they I can‚Äôt find any info on them, sorry for being a noob
---
It's a cool idea, but in practice it would be a very abusable item, and make the economy worse off while also not really uniting pkers/pvmers.
---
Honestly it is, but the fact that he's being such a baby about getting it wrong is highly amusing
---
Your "logic" is garbage. If the seed is "too expensive" to afford it right now, go grind the boss until you can pay one.
---
if i have an ecu key i have to waste a restore dose, yes, but ill also brew up before i get to the boss room anyway, so ill need to do that anyway. if i dont and im getting killcount, then i put on rapid restore prayer and then pot up once my stats have gone back to normal, which happens within like 2 mins. otherwise, you could just begin getting killcount and use prayer, and once you need to restore your prayer back to full, drink the restore and then pot up. dont pot up before youve fully restored stats, its almost a waste of a pot dose.
---
That's an RS3 thing
---
if you want to save money and don't mind it being more tedious, you can boost with a botanical pie at 86 up to 90, and make supercombat potions. The preserve prayer will make this a bit easier.
