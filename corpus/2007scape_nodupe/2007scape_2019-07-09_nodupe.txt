I genuinely do not like the games?
---
He makes good points, idk dude
---
Has there been any talk about that? It could be a nice tweak. There would be a lot less bots farming it...
---
Are you the same dumbass that's been making new accounts and spamming the various ironscape CCs flaming Sin? Nice edit btw, 10/10.
---
Yeah was just curious if there was a specific reason why you hated it.
---
Not only that, after shitting himself he decided to publicly post about it on twitter.
---

---
Did he think it was impressive? What did he expect peoples reactions would be?
---
I only sort by new...
---
i don‚Äôt get what you mean by in a perfect 1v1 situation, especially considering if you‚Äôre getting skull tricked that‚Äôs pretty impossible to do solo
---
it definitely does feel outdated but not doing it that way just sounds super hand holdy to me
---
and yes, if you are good at pking and staying calm, then throwing hits back at them at trying to catch a freeze is definitely better. The average pvmers are not going to meet that criteria
---
Octopus have 6 arms and 2 legs
---
The Mods working on OSRS seem pretty great, just overworked and poorly resourced for such a successful game, which is down to Jagex being stingy.
---
No excuses.

Yeah, I saw that. I'm a low level btw and reckon there's more pressing things to spend 32k on. Figured it'd be a relatively short (1/128) grind but I've been at it 4 days now in between fishing and cooking food and crafting arrows and ultimately wanting to know for curiosities sake.

Given his points and KC, hes likely a learner and you dont bring ring switches when you're learning. Zerker is best ring to bring if you arent switching

---
I'd personally be in support of that but the amount of upheaval that would cause for ironman accounts would be insane. People that may be hundred of hours from starting Zulrah-post SOTE lock already having all her uniques, etc.,
---
Yea.. Not a safe sex smasher of thots apparentlyüò¢üò≠ü§¶
---
Sheesh. Do that a couple times and that's my entire bank lol.
---
How many more posts should we expect congratulating jagex on this update?
---
Better than my team cape :)
---
I think they might've talked about adding more reqs to Zulrah before but I don't think there's been any requests/posts that gained traction talking about locking Zulrah behind Song of the Elves, especially since it's already locked behind Regicide.
---
I saw that too. I'm not worried.
---
Level up your HP through Str training. Don't keep too much cash on the account since it can always be recovered. Enjoy pking
---
I prefer rs3 art over osrs any day, I just play osrs due to eoc + mtx.

there's more in the dungeon than just the boss

I bet this is exactly what you expected when you first made the account
---
Yes real players buy GP, idk why are you so surprised by this, this is pretty common in every major mmorpg game
---
I grew up with the old (1-9) FF games. Squaresoft or enix have not put out anything worthwhile after those.

Why buy from gold sellers when u can buy the bonds and do the same?
---
Well that solves that
---
You should do the quest death to the dorg. For bone crossbow (bolts like 2gp ea) and gives you access to storerooms which is good ironman gp for low lvls.
---
I can respect that. Final Fantasy could make for a good crossover. I always thought Cloud looked awesome.
---
the gear you need for 3m/hr is basically de facto beyond t75 though
---
Can you just use English words, please?
---
Fuck instances.
---
Funny if you go 1500 world rev caves you‚Äôll see a dude named BIKER always bolt ragging
---
Would you use cudgel over leaf bladed battleaxe ?
---
??? Legends cape is only 675 coins, black dhide is a few k for each piece
---
Jagex PLEAAE MAN.
---
This is the problem.
---
Bots.
---
Yes
---
Images like these should make their way to the osrs site.  Who actually used the osrs site for anything but the occasional news update?  Account management isn't even done there.
---
Shout out all the agility bots in seers village with pets
---
A lot of that is nonsense lol. you think that giving jagex an extra dollar in membership results in benefits for the individual developers and that is laughable. ‚ÄúImplementation in jagex corporate environment because I do not know enough about their current ownership agreement‚Äù it‚Äôs a hugely popular mmo man. It‚Äôs not complicated. It‚Äôs not rev share. I didn‚Äôt expect you to write so much in response, I applaud that. But they pay really bad salaries to devs because devs are still willing to work there. It‚Äôs because fans apply. How much they pay developers is also common knowledge and you can check glass door for more info on it. 
---
Sorry if my rude attitude and differing opinion offended people. Not being sarcastic right now, I was bein an asshole.
---
You mean Myth's cape? HA value of myth's is 6k, black dhide is slightly higher. Pretty sure untradeables use their HA value to determine what drops on death
---
Looking to cox out your security questions when you're drunk. /s
---
Deep wildy pking is the only worthwhile pking to me. No one is gonna run up and spec me out after I get a kill and there's not as many clans as you might expect plus there's not many pures so you don't have to waste time killing them for 50k loot
---
Agreed, a fantastic update amidst the MTX drama.
---
What I remember from my Dominion Tower grinds were needing to do 500 bosses to partially unlock some of the rewards. Between each boss, you had a 10 second roulette wheel that served almost no purpose, had to click through multiple gates and stairs, and had an 15 second unskippable intro cutscene while health bars and taunts loaded in. Additionally, since you needed to defeat specific bosses to fully unlock some rewards, and since bosses were random, many players had struggled finding and defeating Nomad as a requirement for one of the specific glove unlocks, which was compounded by the tedious debuffs like random stuns that locked your player from all actions.
---
Based on some 2017-2018 footage (2019 footage seems non-existant from google search), the only thing they've solved is that the intro taunts are skippable (but not the roulette wheel). Conceptually, Dominion Tower is still a boss rush mode that emphasizes everything except the bosses themselves, which is 100% terrible implementation.

I was expecting there to be some huge process that I had to do to unlock the boss.

---
I am everything else though
---
I think they should give it a damage buff if its being used against the boss. That would allow it to not be a useless item without making it overpowered anywhere else. Like at the very least, people would buy it to farm the pet.

It's a marketing tactic

I had a ton of fun making a gargoyle alt with barrows gloves and fire cape. I gave up after killing a few thousand gargoyles and getting burnt out. The journey is a hell of a lot better than AFK gargoyles.
---
Never actually been to the dungeon yet and don't wanna mess it up. How do you trigger the dragonstone one?
---
I‚Äôve never bought gold but I have a few irl friends who do. But I see it happen to them everytime in this same order. They come back to Runescape, play for a few weeks with a broke ass bank, grinding for better gear and stats, get bored of the grind(amateurs), buy a bunch of gold, get bored of the game because it‚Äôs not fun when you have everything you need or want. It feels so good to earn everything yourself, and then they decide to double down at the sand casino, then they lose their bank and take another few month break.
---
ByRelease is pretty sweet by J1mmy
---
He's doing every osrs quest in the order it was released, using only the tools provided during that time of release
---
It's just some dead spiders legs bundled up, how is it suppose to do damage like a whip or a scimitar?
---
Very much want a polled redesign, at least make it not ugly. I would avoid equipping it just on the fact of how ugly it is
---
he posted a video a few days ago saying that he will come back to YouTube in about 2 weeks, has been training his new hcim and NMZ training an account called A Friend 2
---
You are right it's nearly impossible to skull trick solo and that's my point, a pvmer with 3-4 items won't fight back because it's safe to assume that it's not a perfect 1v1 situation, the other person could try to skull trick them by having their friends or alts log in. Keeping track of who has attacked you is not easy, and it's very easy to missclick when people stack on each other or have similar names/gear setups. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There is another way to do it, but it's a bit controversial. rather than let everyone keep items I think you should always lose your items when you die as if you were skulled (keep your +1 with prayer tho) and then change the skull effect to something else. I'd rather the wilderness be more risky than hand holdy overall, I agree with you.

3 snakelings in 1k Zulrah. Rip brethren

Paid instances are great. Idk what the fuck you're talling about.
---
3 claws, 9 leathers, 9 rings, begging for RNG...
---
Oh I see. I thought you were still using them. I guess it's nice to have but like the other guy mentioned, by the time you could add them to the jewellery box you could just make a fairy ring in your POH anyhow.
---
As for the eagle transport system argument, if someone could explain why this is good I would love to know. I genuinely haven't found a use for it other than those 3 diary requirements.
---
i'm not trying to make an excuse because i know it is bad behavior that people have been able to control but sometimes it just happens in the moment, it seems like the only thing you want to do is punch something  its like a sudden itch you have to scratch

AGILITY..... to level 20 or 30 at least.
---
Will only take like 30 mins.
---
Just get 75 range and buy a BP. You can always sell the BP back after you're done if needed.
---
idk when i introduced my real life friends to runescape they don't even realize they're bots and just think the game is really popular and it didn't kill their desire to play at all because they didn't know better. Once you get empty resources, you want empty resources. but if that's all you know, you can find fun out competing these level 3 players

Anything I can, for the most part, afk.

Got 99 agility pretty much all at work, and I'm at 84 runecraft doing bloods at work now.

After that 99 runecraft, I'm thinking woodcutting, then fishing.

ah, wilderness tele... no wonder i wasnt aware of that, i dont pk..... thanks.
---
Yeaaa, I have mixed feelings about that. On one hand, it takes more skill and on the other hand it‚Äôs boring af and basically comes down to brew management.

Smite fights fun af since rng is way more at play.

Am I wearing the most efficient gear for training combat at my level? I'm newish and need some help.
---
Sick take on a chaos rune. Who designed it?
---
What? You completely missed the point on instances. I never said you weren‚Äôt capable of lasting a 10hr trip, the point is you‚Äôd have people crashing you to where you likely couldn‚Äôt stick around for 10 hours because someone else is going to want in. If there‚Äôs 100 worlds, only 100 groups can fight bandos at a time and only 100 of his drops can come in over a respawn and kill cycle, instanced? Now you can have 1000 being killed at the exact same time with 10 times the drops coming into the game.
---
Adding a *cash* price does literally nothing to help the issue. The issue is *item* inflation not *gold* inflation, there‚Äôs far too many unique items from instanced bosses coming into the game and zero risk of ever losing those items, ever.
---
Who cares if you have to go back and pay 150k for dying at a boss to get back your 50m in gear you just died with, you *never* lose the items. That goes against the entire balance of how runescape was initially setup and why RS3 had to go the almost entirely unreadable/degradable route and later needed the item sink that is invention to have any semblance of an economy. The game worked from 2001 to 2010 or so with zero need for item sinks. This is because you‚Äôd lose them more times than not on a PvM death and during pvp worlds, pking items were almost never dropped for the other person causing an item sink.
---
These were the times when the economy was actually stable and flourishing, now unique item prices are smashed into the ground until they‚Äôre at minimum value, like zulrah uniques which hold their value solely on the price of scales you can convert them into which is a completely trash system. There‚Äôs few exceptions to this rule from some raid items which also breaks the instance rule, but really they‚Äôre doing the same thing only much more slowly as they come into the game less frequently and aren‚Äôt quite the same method to camp them.
---
This issue is also inflated by the fact that boss drop tables are filled to the brim with alchables which is literally the same as them just dropping straight up cash and compounds the issue.
---
I‚Äôm aware of the original issues behind removing the way deaths were handled, however it was only ever meant to be short and temporary until they managed the DDoS problem and then did a *full revert* not some half assed system that doesn‚Äôt address the actual problem.
---
That actually reminds me. They did do sponsored videos with youtubers maybe like a year ago. Trump and maybe Kripparrian did them. I think Game Grumps did one too. Idk who else, but probably a bunch of youtubers.

I'm having issues with Vorkath after the completion of DS2. My biggest issue is that my dps seems too low. 3 minutes into the kill and he's still 50% health. Should I just come back when I have higher range, elite void, and a bgs? Here's my [setup](https://imgur.com/a/wLx1cMS). My stats: 80/86/80 melee, 84 range, 70 prayer.
---
It's not really just a wilderness thing, although the rings have to be charged at the fountain of rune in the wildy. You can just buy the ring of wealth(5) off ge and use the ge tele, or any of its other teles, from anywhere. Probably easier to just do varrock med diaries if you want a grand exchange tele though. Those let you switch varrock tele to ge instead.
---
Honestly you don't even need 43 prayer. I remember one person doing it at only 9/13 magic on day 1 just for a personal challenge, using the same method that irons can use to never spend prayer pots (manual casting + running around the tombs).
---
Why the 26 att?
---
I come and go a lot. Recently just started playing again after about a year break. I enjoy picking up where I left off personally. Each time I have a fresh mindset towards the game, which helps me set new goals for my account.

Tbh the light puzzle isn't complex and is rather fun. It's the PTSD inducing handholds agility obstacle that most people remember. Because you normally do that quest at the minimum agility level, and you have 10 fail checks to pass..  twice (and that's if you do the light puzzle correctly).
---
The rest is pretty fun. It's that RNG monstrosity that is horrifying.
---
Before Jad spawns you make sure you're north of italy and he'll just be stuck south of it. When you're ready you head out and attack him, then when healers spawn you tag each one and run back north of italy. You can turn on protect from melee and kill them 1 by 1 without worrying about jad.
---
When‚Äôs the wedding

Weird. Only thing i can think of is your not clicking on thr crumble icon? Sounds like you click it but crumble isnt in becus you try ti attack it with whatever you have equipped resulting in the prompt

I am not insecure, it was meant to be a joke showing how close I am to 6 ft. I am actually shorter than 5'11" though ;)

That only gets you the melee brothers, so it hurts your chance at getting items from chest, but you should still be getting gp/hr from runes if you max your kc

Giant mole is a good beginner boss, barrows, you can try the boss version of your slayers tasks when you get higher levels. KBD is pretty good as well as the other wildly bosses like crazy archaeologist if you don't mind dying to pkers occasionally (just turn off attack player options so you don't skull). Those are good for beginners, look at the wiki for bosses and watch a YouTube video to see what you think you can do.

Pures aren‚Äôt really made to earn money, outside of pking apart from maybe the odd raid which someone actually wants to take a pure.

Back in 2007 ish I attempted Jad twice and failed. Once OSRS went live I came back I got to lvl 85 and got hacked and lost my email and RS acc right when I was about to attempt Jad again. 
---
I am now lvl 77 ironman and I am coming for Jad, this fight has been long overdue for over a decade. I am prepairing for war.
---
Everyone gonna just ignore the fact that he's driving in Park?
---
I've been exploring it with no guides. It's been so fun to randomly kill things and look around and discover what the dungeon has to offer. I came \*this close\* to dying to that demon-possessed guy (I think his name's Olbert?) because I had no idea what to expect and I recklessly just jumped into the fight. Heart was literally pounding. 10/10 would play again.

Google quick guides, hold down space bar. I hate quests but once you get the quest Cape you only need to do one quest every once in a while

listen mate, it shows you 3 weapons out of sword, halberd, greataxe, and mace. click the one that's missing. it is genuinely 5 seconds. every other room an be completed by simply following the steps here in a chronological order with no time restriction https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Recruitment_Drive

Took it a lil too far maybe?

Are you honestly insulting people for not wanting to pay money for a botting, time wasting, grindfest, boring afk mmo? Or are you not being serious.
---
  
---
This game costs almost as much as wow. Almost as much as fuckin wow. And look at the difference. It's not the money its the principal this game is awful.

Anyone know of a solid zerker guide/ quest guide?

CANT AFFORD $11 I M 12

Yes it is. I‚Äôve lived there with combined income over 150k and it wasn‚Äôt easy.

am i the only person in the world who had a normal uncle growing up?
---
That‚Äôs probably for the best because it is an important part of the game. If you think recruitment drive is hard/time consuming then you would have a blast with MM2 and ME2
---
Why do you insult the game lol, is someone holding you at gunpoint to play it, don't like it? Quitte your whining
---
For example I like the challenge that it brings.

Chill. I don't think he thinks OP is an infidel.

Combat training arena is best place to cannon. Just finish biohazard quest (does not take long)

You guys dont keep a green cash stack? I usually always keep a stack for random boss necessities .
---
Constant drops down to 7fps as well
---
so when you enter that room just look for the fucking weapon that's missing literally use your eyes and say oh theres 3 gold statues hmmm its an axe a halberd and a mace. must be a great axe thats missing. press print screen and paste it into paint then you can take your time to answer her question. i don't know why you have to quickly skip into a video guide to know what to do? do you forget each time?

I will agree that Runescapes quests are badly designed and almost purposely designed around the person following a guide.

I was 10. 2006. On DSL internet (recently acquired, as my Dad was slow to realize that the ~$30 at the time for faster than dial up internet was becoming a necessity.) I remember the first thing after tut island I did was explore the lummy castle bc I didn‚Äôt get the game and I thought I was a badass killing spiders in the basement of it. 
---
What I‚Äôd do to feel that way again..
---
guys OP post history is full of weed btw, do the quest sober dumb cunt and maybe you wont fail
---
Not loud no, laptop doesn‚Äôt feel hotter than usual

70+ Strength will do that

and it's almost as hot as sea shanty 2.

It‚Äôs a mid account that I only pay for with coins , I have about 40m in gear just can‚Äôt use it for a bond now lol.  I got the free time from twitch and just forgot to go grind out the 4mill until a day too late.

Help with getting my FPS back up to 45-50, it was running at it a week ago
---
That's what I did last time. And then when it got back to normal it was the axe that was missing. I ran to that same color statue and now there was 2 of them with an axe. I'm not even shitting it made me fail on purpose. And that was like 6 of them in deep.
---
I think the hardware is dying too

Is the hard drive full or close to full?

This shouldn‚Äôt be bannable and it‚Äôs ridiculous we even have to have this discussion.

Multi-boxing has been a thing for over a decade, with it being around in things like World of Warcraft where some people would one-man entire PVP teams. This is a feat of strength more than anything else.

If you‚Äôre capable to multi-boxing five accounts, you damn well should be able to do it.

How about we start banning the people who deserve it?

This is such a poorly educated comment. Why are they a poor idea? As long as they act as a gp/item sink by risking items on death or demanding a fee on death, its a good system. And/or you can make it a "paid" instance like Kraken. They definitely serve a good purpose and personally i wish they took the "paid instance" approach with a reclaim-item fee on death as well. That way you can just do the main room risk free and fight for spots, or buy an instance and make sure you don't die. Best of both worlds.

Yep, it's fucking stupid.

&gt; crazy archaeologist
---
You can also kill the deranged archeologist on Fossil Island. It's an easy way to get runite limbs + black d'hide (legs?) on a btw. It sure beats killing steel dragons for the limbs.
---
Iirc, dwh spec is percentage-based. So assuming they hit, letting them spec first will give you greater defense reduction overall.
---
They made bonds to combat RWT, it brings no extra money into the economy and allows people to buy a membership with in-game currency. I would agree with you if the made bonds than banned RWT, but they didn't. They're just making the best of a bad situation and i don't think anyone has a problem with bonds...

Huh, guess I don't need to watch the youtube video now.

It's a dumb statement.

Agility up to level ~70, questing. Get barrow gloves, dragon defender, fighter torso maybe... good melee gear. Start doing alot of slayer to get your combat stats up and while afking figure out what you‚Äôd like to do yourself. 
---
Enjoy osrs!
---
You smart. You loyal.
---
agreed!!!
---
Not usually but some people do if it's something they really want...deffo not just a streamer thing.
---
No... it wouldn't at all. Plenty of bosses have instanced rooms or multiple rooms. And those bosses bring in far more resources than this mid-level boss.
---
You can also balance the boss around multi rooms by changing its respawn timer / kill time to work out the kills/hr in a similar way. 
---
Instances don't just "break the economy" in fact they're tools used to help the economy...

Osrs was huge, the content creators were dead on their ass because it was like a weak version of dmm and nobody had gp to do crazy stuff, and everyone was focused on maxing. But yeah without gwd zeah and raids 1 osrs would be done for long before now.

I see. So is it still worth doing if i‚Äôm only able to single attack the monsters?

I caant believe it, I‚Äôm fuming I‚Äôm literally fuming right now
---
i disagree. you can flop a prayer on galavak and live. you miss a flick against jad and you're as good as dead. also i feel like most people who can't do jad flop on trying to deal with healers while keeping flicks going.
---
If given the option, would the team prefer to introduce old, popular minigames (such as Fist of Guthix or Soul Wars) with reworked rewards, reintroduce old minigames with reworked mechanics, or develop entirely new games?
---
I have around 20m, so not really rich.
---
 Yes I voted for threshold idk why people voted against tbh
---
Also, make sure to flick rapid heal every fairly often to make sure you don‚Äôt regenerate the health once you‚Äôre at 1hp. Every time you activate it or deactivate it, it will reset the timer for your health regen so you can stay at 1 hp. It sounds annoying and tedious, but if you do NMZ at 2 hp instead of 1 then you‚Äôll go through absorption potions twice as fast, and even faster if you continue to heal more.
---
It'll still help but not as much. It hits max 30, but only gives 2xp per damage
---
Like I said, as long as you can safe spot it'll attack everything even in single combat areas.
---
10 def build is good imo, slayer helm and salad robes ftw

Back to Spirit Seeds, can we take them to Nature Spirit in the Nature Grotto to have them release their natural spirit for a chance for a pet.

Bandos tassets are BiS strength bonus legs, and strength bonus is absurdly important in RuneScape. Why do you expect them to be cheap? OSRS playerbase is growing, so there are more people raising through the levels who want BiS gear. Compare that to RS3 where any number of people can farm bandos whenever they want with a drastically reduced respawn timer, it gets a lot if attention due to how easy the boss is and pet hunters, where the armor is 10 tiers below BiS, the playerbase is losing people everyday, and the people who stay are maxed and have no need for the armor. It's a wonder it can still keep a 1M price tag. 
---
You trying to compare an item from one game to the same item in another, and then claiming the economy of the one that is more expensive is fucked shows how little you understand about either games economy.

You can walk through any world in edgeville and see 50 cannonball bots with 80-95 smithing. Do you know how long it would take to get 90+ smithing doing cannonballs? Sure, the morons using free bot scripts are getting banned, but bot farmers and people using private scripts are thriving atm.

One time I made a fresh f2p account, picked up a bunch of salmon off the ground in lumbridge at the fishing spot, walked to GE and sold it, and went to one of those GE flipping margin sites like platinumtokens and turned it into a 500k stack within like 6 hours
---
Currently as it is the Farmer‚Äòs Outfit is **NEVER** worth obtaining, most players would use graceful for their farm runs instead. 
---
**Could we see a small buff, possibly a 1%? chance to receive your seed back when harvesting.**
---
Farmer‚Äòs outfit gives 2.5% xp and takes roughly 5 hours to obtain. 
---
Farming EHP is valued at 1.2M xp/hr. 
---
Within the 5 hours to obtain the farmers outfit you would gain 500k xp and save yourself either 325k xp (to 99) or 5M xp (to 200M). Compared to the 6M xp you‚Äôd gain from passive farming without the outfit.

Why would the Gmaul always be lost on death? Shouldn't it be able to be used as a +1 item so people can't do ags Gmaul etc. Having it always lost on death completely kills the 70-80 combat bracket as Gmaul was their only spec wep as they are 50 attack
---
It's bad practice only listening to those from authority, they are usually the most biased. You seem to have completely missed my point though, obviously people with years of PvP experience want it removed, anything that causes any kind of friction against them getting a kill they would be in favour of removing.
---
It is those with years of PvP experience that you should dismiss the opinion of first and foremost.
---
I grew up with the world's most normal as family, and if there is one thing I learned from every girlfriend I have brought to meet them, it's that is fucking weird how normal they are. Dysfunction and abuse is more common than a wholesome loving family
---
Can the attachment be kept as a +1 with the protect item prayer? Or is it always lost on death regardless?
---
Lets talk magic. in pvm and pvp scenarios (excluding ice barrage) the attack speed of spells is pretty static and there just isn't as much variety as there could be, despite magic being an expensive skill to use and train. In PVP magic is the only combat style that is never used to KO the opponent. when will we possibly see magic special attack weapons? 
---
Second, I believe the Arceus spellbook could be properly balanced to not be overpowered but putting it closer in line with the ancient, lunar, and standard books while also fitting the theme of it being a blood/soul rune reliant spellbook. There is a lot of room for unique, useful and cool spells. will we be seeing an update to this spellbook anytime soon?
---
Just don‚Äôt do it with 10 agility and you‚Äôll be fine

no, its a quite good quest if you pay attention to the story and dont just spam through dialog, the jumping part can be annoying with low agi though
---
A question regarding Warding: 
---
Why does Warding buff splashing? 
---
Splashing at Obelisks would grant the same magic xp/h as it does now plus some free vis. 
---
Why should this mechanic exist? Splashing is good enough as it is and absolutely does not need a buff.  
---
One (poor) argument was that it would get splashers out of Lumby, but that's being fixed now anyway.
---
I‚Äôm confused
---
Bulwark is limited in its uses, so let‚Äôs nerf its defense. Am I missing something?
---
theres already next to no use for dinhs in pvm it doesnt matter, it cant have different stats for pvm vs pvp though thats not how the engine works
---
please just make it a drop from grotesque guardians to make them worthwhile...

**Snare and Entangle on F2P Worlds**
---
Just like Teleblock, this is not an integrity change.
---
Jagex describes "These are classified as integrity changes as they combat rule-breaking or change elements of gameplay that are considered unfair or counterproductive to the game's long-term health."
---
1. It doesn't break any rules. 
---
2. There is nothing unfair about escaping a fight. 
---
3. This change IS counterproductive to the game's long-term health. 
---
I feel like that these changes are counterproductive. I mean, F2P has always been a reasonably safe environment with low risk to practice and learn the basics of PKing. Learning the basics will give them confidence to try out other forms of PKing. 
---
Now Jagex is slowly removing this safe environment. Making the steep learning curve of PvP even steeper. Experienced PKers will be able to effectively guarantee a kill, as their target can't escape. 
---
People have been asking Jagex to keep the Tournament World up for exactly this reason. They don't want the risk of losing their stuff. They don't care for profit. They just want to have fun and practice PvP.    
---
Unfortunately for them the Tournament World won't stay up permanently, so they have to find other suitable environments or simply won't bother at all. I fear that more and more people simply won't bother as the learning curve grows.
---
Not even close
---
Are there any plans to bring back Arcanists (best Funorb game)?   
---
I would pay a shitload to just to play this on multiplayer again :)
---
I like the idea of risk being added to pvm but breaking untradeables is the wrong way to go about it. I feel like the state of the osrs servers will never be optimal enough to justify anything resembling the old death system, but I do think items should show up to other nearby players after 30 mins.
---
And those who don't want to PKed aren't biased?
---
They could change gmauls so that they degrade to dust (but still nerf the spec cost and make it so that a degraded gmaul has no alch value) after like 4 specs and that new upgrade would "reinforce" it so it wouldn't break and decrease the spec percentage to what it is now. Maybe a dumb idea, I don't pk so I'm not really using a maul anywhere.
---
Take some speed and play 24/7
---
Did you even read my response? I didn't talk about only magic. _You can just camp mage prot and survive_. That's how broken that shit is.
---
Bulwark+doublehides tank _all_ the hits, not just magic. 
---
Altar with bulwark is pointless, because if you don't get caught in multi and get 5 man focused, you simply don't die. Just move the 700% altar to the G.E then.
---
Rc is my highest skill. Farming is my lowest
---
&gt; suggesting that one persons opinion is better than anothers is a little silly.
---
I agree with your general opinion, but peoples opinions certainly do matter more or less on specific content.  Why should a lvl 3 skillers opinion matter in regards to raids when they likely never have and never will do that content so they are not as in tune with it as someone who consistently does raids as a moneymaker.  
---
Having some experience when discussing a topic is certainly a good thing.  Both opinions matter, though I usually lean towards the guy with experience if both have solid arguments in theory because actual gameplay isnt always the same as how it is imagined.
---
The content creator cant equip any of the gloves. Only 3 ppl ever did the scry bug and theres very few accounts left that are still on the island with the right setup. Bug has been patched, so in other words you seem to be worrying about nothing.
---
Colosseum something proposed long time ago in zeah dev blog but it's probably dismissed, there is no information about it.

They can. Barbarian assault is an instance, for example.

Wait, have you gotten any other uniques? Or literally 5 jars of swamp for 7k kc?
---
Time spent afk anyways
---
Making the board cost GP would just lead to people still advertising houses with autotypers then
---
idk I'm just disappointed. It's supposed to be a rework and they just made it even more useless.
---
I agree with everything else than making F2P be able to get up to level 5 Agility. Those levels go by really fast and honestly just make any F2P player feel worse when they can't progress any further without paying for the game.
---
Umm I already had 164k exp which is shown in the picture. So that would mean it would be 10.5 hours to 99 not 11 lol

---
as long as you have 56 agility (needed for the next quest in its story) it's fine.
---
That is actually... pretty damn good tattoo. We RuneScape players know exactly that it's a Chaos rune, but those who don't recognize just sees it as a rock with skull on it. Thanks for its neutral approach, it won't be any cringy to anyone, like genuine RuneScape tattoos are like a Max cape what I've seen. This, just, THIS, is an amazing choice for it: you tattooed yourself something about RuneScape, but it also have other understandings towards others. On top of that, who knows when you no longer play RuneScape. And when that day comes, having that tattoo won't be a problem at any point of life - like tattooing your girl/boyfriend's name and later you break up with them, thus making the tattoo unappealing.
---
I'm not into tattooing myself, but this is truly amazing RuneScape themed tattoo with neutrality towards non-players. Great choice and money well-spent! \^\^

We have been listening to your feedback on things in the game that need to be improved to help make the player experience better. We would like to bring some of those small improvements to you in the coming weeks. Below is a list of suggested changes for in-game content that will fall under the "Integrity Changes", "To Be Polled", and "To Be Discussed" sections. Pending feedback to this blog, we'll make any necessary changes and poll the suggestions from the "To Be Polled" section from Friday July 12th until Monday July 15th.

Changelog:

Reworded Ecumenical key question.
---
This section displays changes we plan to make without polling. These are classified as integrity changes as they combat rule-breaking or change elements of gameplay that are considered unfair or counterproductive to the game's long-term health.
---
Granite Maul Rework
---
The Granite Maul currently uses 50% of the special attack to deal a damaging blow to a player while in PvP. The proposed change is to make the current Granite Maul use 60% of it's special attack to keep it in line with other special attack PvP weapons. We will then add a new item that can be attached to the maul (similar to a clamp) to the Bounty Hunter Reward shop for 10M BH points. This attachment when added to the Granite Maul will give it the 50% special attack back, is always lost on death and if PK'd, the pker will receive 1M coins.
---
Bulwark Rework
---
When the Bulwark was released it was looking to fill a niche in PvM to enhance a tanker's ability to help the team when group bossing. As time has gone on, it's clear that the shield has very few limited uses outside of aiding in wilderness protection. This isn't a problem in itself however, in its current format, it gives the player high invulnerability when combined with certain equipment/protection prayers. We would like to reduce its Defence bonuses by -10 in Stab, Slash, Crush, Magic, and Ranged. 
---
Avernic Defender Repair Cost and Death Drop
---
The Avernic Defender currently drops 1M on PvP death but it also costs 1M to repair at Perdu. Typically, broken objects act as a gold sink in PvP, however, this one does not. We plan to increase the repair cost to 1.25M GP so that there's a cash sink but no decrease in value to the PKer.
---
Snare and Entangle on F2P Worlds 
---
After adding Tele block to F2P, the appetite to try out F2P PKing was apparent but lacked some key components such as preventing players from moving for longer durations. As a result, we plan to add Snare and Entangle to F2P to facilitate more effective F2P PKing.

Interfaces
---
In April we released a new Goldcrafting interface that functions with left-click buttons like the bank. Following the update, there was a high demand from you that we should update our Smithing and Silvercrafting interfaces as well. 
---
Player Owned House Advertisement Board
---
Currently the meta for advertising an open player owned house is to have an account stand outside the house portal and spam the homeowner's RSN as much as possible so players can see it, type it into their chat box, and ultimately enter the house. This spam is often facilitated by bots or autotypers but also comes with issues such as being able to see that homeowner's name long enough to type it correctly and enter. We would like to propose a Player Owned House Advertisement Board. This will allow a homeowner to set their house to be advertised on a board that will sit outside every POH portal. This board will display the name of the homeowner, their Construction level, and a choice of what they are sharing the house for (i.e a gilded altar, lectern, portal nexus). When a player looks at the board, they can then click the homeowner's name and it will teleport them into the player's house. If a house is closed, the entry is removed from the board.
---
Marble Lectern
---
Players can choose to have a single lectern in their house per Study room. This results in players having to either choose between the two best lecterns or making two Study rooms to accommodate the different tablets players can make. We would like to introduce a new Marble Lectern that combines the ability to make tablets from both the Mahogany Eagle and Mahogany Demon Lecterns. This will require 77 Construction, 1 Marble Block, 1 Magic Stone, and 1 Gold Leaf to create.
---
Kill/Death Ratios
---
We recently updated the K/D Ratio to be included on HUD in PvP worlds. Since then, there's been a demand to have separate K/D ratios for PvP and BH Worlds rather than using the same one for all. due to them being combined previously and therefore not tracking which world the kill or death occurred on, if we were to make separate K/D ratios, they will have to start at 0.

In order to start a game, players must left click the Volcanic Mine and go through some dialogue to exchange numulites to enter. We propose an option to right click quick start on the entrance which will take the 30 numulite fee out of your inventory.
---
Tithe Farm
---
In order to water your plants in Tithe Farm you must click your watering can and then click the plant. We'd like to allow left-click watering of plants in Tithe Farm. 
---
In addition to the left click plant watering on Tithe Farm we would like to update Bologa's blessing to be 1 Tithe Point for 10 blessings rather than 1 Tithe point per blessing. This blessing allows players to pick Zamorak's grapes instead of grapes from the Vinery. It consumes one blessing per grape picked. 
---
Chaos Elemental Respawn Timer
---
Currently the Chaos Elemental respawns every 2.5 minutes. Since there is only 1 Chaos Elemental per world, we propose making the respawn rate faster to 1 minute for everyone instead.
---
Web Slashing
---
Only specific types of weapons are allowed to slash webs. We propose letting any weapon with a slash bonus slash webs, with a success chance dependent on the weapon's slash bonus. The Wilderness swords currently give a guaranteed web slashing chance in the Wilderness and will be kept the same.
---
Locator Orbs
---
After completing Dragon Slayer II, players can only have one locator orb at a time. Since the orbs are useful for draining health, similar to Dwarven rock cakes, it can be a pain to have to retrieve another one upon death. We propose allowing players to retrieve multiple copies of the locator orb by speaking to Ana. 
---
Shilo Village Shortcut
---
Players can directly teleport to Duradel with Karamja gloves 4 thus making the unlock to the Shilo Village river shortcut seem rather useless. We propose moving the shortcut unlock from the Elite Karamja Diary Reward to the Medium Reward instead. 
---
Ecumenical Keys
---
The drop rate of ecumenical keys is 1/60. However, once you possess a key, the drop rate decreases by 10 to 1/70 and 1/80 for your second and third keys. You are limited to a maximum of three keys; if you get more than that, you will be unable to pick up anymore until they are destroyed or used. However, upon completion of the Medium or Hard Wilderness Diary you can hold up to 4 or 5 keys at a time. We can remove all the restrictions from the keys allowing players to have more than 3 (or 5 if diary is completed) and remove the drop rate restrictions to have a flat 1/60 rate regardless of the keys a player currently holds. 
---
Clue Casket Locks
---
Since caskets are now stackable and clue scrolls have had a graphical change to be colour coded based on the various tiers, we can update the clue reward casket locks to match the colours of the clue scroll tiers so it's easier to determine which casket is which.

---
Special Attack Teleport Restriction in PvP
---
In November 2018, a previous PVP cabal suggested we make a change that prevented players from teleporting for 3 seconds after using a Special Attack whilst in the Wilderness or in a PvP/BH world. Since the change, it was proven unpopular with PvPers and is often requested we revert it. We can revert this change however, we wanted to offer this as a discussion point first, to ensure we are reaching out to as many of you as possible. If this is something you would not like removed, please provide us feedback.
---
Imbued God Capes and Other Untradeables
---
One of the most commonly questioned subjects as a result of the State of PvP blog is that Imbued God Capes are always lost on death but only in PvP. When originally polled, the capes were to be lost no matter what, however due to the way the death system works, it is overridden. We would like to discuss what we should do moving forward. This could be adding them to Perdu so they're usable in pre 20 Wilderness, or making them lost in PvM situations too so that it's fair for PvM and PvP alike (and matches what was polled). We would like to make the change to match what was polled however we want to ensure this is what the players want before proceeding.
---
While on the topic of fairness between PvP and PvM, a discussion arose about how PvPers are expected to pay to repair their untradeables for losing them below 20 wilderness, however in PvM they can't break and can just be reclaimed or are kept on death. The idea has been batted around the team and ultimately, we wanted to open up the discussion to you all on the finer details. There is little risk when PvMing outside an instance anymore so we would like to have a discussion on whether the items Perdu can repair, should be required to be repaired regardless of location (but still lost over 20 wilderness). While we can make this proposed change, we want to open up discussions on how you would expect to get your items repaired should the change go through. We can do one of the following options: require players to go to the current Perdu locations, map Perdu down at more locations such as TOB and COX, or we can offer the ability to go to a banker and have them repair your items for you (similar to Perdu). 
---
Magical Defence Calculations in PvP
---
We have the ability to make Magical defence be calculated differently for PvP and PvM. Currently it's 70% from your Magical stat and 30% from your Defence stat. Similar to what we did in Seasonal Deadman Mode, we could change these percentages to 50% for both in PvP only while leaving PvM alone. Please give us your thoughts and feedback on this proposal via the channels listed at the bottom of this newspost.
---
That's all the proposed changes for this blog. Let us know what you think about them in the usual channels listed down below. Please ensure you expand the various sections of this blog to read all of the proposed changes including poll questions. Pending feedback, we look to poll the "To Be Polled" changes from Friday July 12th
---
I just dont think a genuine new player would buy bonds because they dont really know what a bond does. Now if they were told by a friend to try playing Thats a different story. 
---
My girl wanted to try playing and without help she was clueless as to what she should do. I think the game without a doubt needs a tweak to the tutorial somehow. And yeah i know this is what happened years ago then EOC followed in suit. 
---
Lets face it the game is hard to become good at. It takes a superior race of man.
---
I got 51. What‚Äôs the next quest in the story line?
---
They should make the agility skillcape give the full set bonus on its own instead of just counting as the graceful cape. Then it would actually be a rewarding skillcape (it's worse than an explorer's ring right now) and there would be at least one way to escape needing full graceful all the time.
---
Not sure I agree with it since it has so few little uses. It's a very cool niche item
---
There have been many 1 defence accounts that have been able to access ape atoll after the quest and obtain adamant to rune gloves. Since the combat bracelet and regen bracelet exist, can we see updates to the RFD quest that can compensate for the bug I didn't abuse, that others did? it doesn't seem fair that those accounts can exclusively have them for breaking the rules.
---
I only bought 2 tubs, does that even count?
---
Just type their username into the report abuse function in game. Look through the list of options there and pick the one you feel is most relevant
---
How is splashing being fixed beyond just the 20 min timer?
---
This one looks pretty good
---
That is categorically false. Untradeables breaking happened because void rangers risked nothing other than a glory amulet and were oppressive to fight. They risked little to nothing while doing insane dps with knives + rcb or a spec weapon, which was +1‚Äôd. Because of that, the untradeables update happened which made them all break on death so that they risked something. It was the same with med levels using slayer helm + torso and f cape and ags/maul. This was changed and torso and f cape dropped cash as well as the slay helm dropping the black mask instead of being kept on death like the other untradeables.
---
So this change increased the risk in PvP, but not PvM, where all bosses are safe deaths since there is no location that takes over an hour to get to after a death.
---
Stop spreading false information to pit pvmers against PvPers.
---
Make it so be able to be sorted by number of players in the house.
---
There's one Agility shortcut to the red dragons -- it requires 75 Agility.
---
Also very unfair to ironmen for whom its harder to acquire cash.
---
why is the melfork trident +4 str? 
---
its a 2 handed weapon I am so confused. its weaker than punching due to the hit rate
---
even iron spear is 3x stronger. buff it to +12 str to match the iron spear at least it looks cool as hell.
---
You would still listen to the pker because as pker you have your fair share of tanking. It's not like pkers are untouchable. Pkers hunt pkers as well. Therefore the pker has experience on both sides so their opinion should be valued more. It's not a hard concept.
---
Thanks for the reply. I have looked over the wiki before, but I have a feeling it‚Äôs not entirely accurate. There‚Äôs a line in there about players with 70+ cooking getting mature ales about 75% of the time. I have 80 cooking and I‚Äôd say my ales only mature around 50% of the time. I used to brew Slayer‚Äôs respite, which is the highest level ale getting around a 25% mature rate with the stuff each time and then moved to chef‚Äôs delight getting around 50% or a bit less.
---
 I'm getting so sick of hearing "how hard firecape is". It's not. Anybody with even the slightest shred of skill in this game can afk their way to jad and click the correct prayer for the next two mins while jad/healers die. There are insanely more challenging things in this game and pretending like jad is still a monumental challenge is ridiculous.
---
space bar gang forever
---
Nechs, Dust Devils, Smoke Devils, Abyssal Demons, Tzharr, there's enough barrage tasks that you'll easily hit 99 before 99 slayer, and I can't speak for Tzharr but those first 4 break even or profit. When I finished slayer I was at almost 18m magic exp.
---
I‚Äôll have to look that up. You just tell out if it‚Äôs not that rotation?
---
There are none though, that's my issue
---
An overhaul to agility shortcuts would be also appreciated. Currently most shortcuts are obsolete to many players when they finally get the agility/combat level to bypass them.
---
RIP, she's gone to heaven to wait for her master. Good doggo.
---
Don‚Äôt add entangle to f2p that will actually kill any clamming that is left in f2p. Snare would be fine but f2p clan wars will be dead.
---
If someone invests a ton of gold into a shield that literally only has 1 use, you bet they shouldn‚Äôt be killed by pkers.
---
Why even try to fight someone with a bulwark, instead of complaining choose your targets effectively instead of thinking you can drop everyone easy.
---
Neitiznot for the extra range def? No blessed coif for range bonus?
---
No but they should be a part of it. If this quest was added just like this you wouldn't be able to get a quest cape on an Ironman.
---
It's not even the meta for ironmen lol
---
Is jagex ever going to address that their items kept on death tab is 100% inaccurate and misleading? Can this please be looked into and fixed?
---
Just pick something that's as close as you can get.
---
Truth be told, you should probably have done this straight away rather than make an account on Reddit just to complain about it. This is not an official support channel, the jmods won't necessarily help you here
---
It's a needed change although trying to kill the guy with dins was always more fun than 1 hitting people.
---
Yea you will know after phase one of the rotation which rotation it is... if it‚Äôs the wrong one you just log out real quick and when you log back in, you will be on the dock then you repeat. (This doesn‚Äôt work for other rotations because some are similar until phase 3 or 4 and at that point you can‚Äôt log out)
---
I'm glad you read all the details... I was on mobile and wasn't able to at the time.
---
The Chinese ones duh.
---
Sweet, a quick log out is cheaper than Zul-andra teles
---
In addition to the clue scroll lock color changes:
---
Currently when you get a mimic casket it gives you a ONE time warning that you can open the casket for immediate rewards, or fight a mimic. Can we change the warning to instead be a "Are you sure you want to open the casket without fighting the mimic?". 
---
This is to prevent accidentally clicking the casket again and losing your only opportunity to fight the mimic. Due to the rarity of this opportunity, many players (including myself) clicked on the casket again a 2nd time assuming we would be given instructions again on how to find/fight the mimic. Instead, to their surprise, wasted their only chance.
---
Vorki was my first aswell. I was honestly disappointed, I‚Äôve never liked the design of the pet, thought it was too detailed and not polygon‚Äôy enough. The pet I really want one day is the Kree‚Äôarra one :)
---
Gz!
---
I'm confused, you admit the bulwark is only useful in one area, nerf that aspect of it, and then don't even poll potential changes to make it useful? Is this the twilight zone?
---
I was already thinking to myself "huh, 8 v 1's aren't in favor of the 8 people enough. We should limit the 1 person's ability to survive more". Good thing they're going to nerf the bulwark. 
---
Rofl not even a *proposed* upgrade to counter balance the nerf? Geeze.
---
You are mostly right but it catered to Ironman so no it is certainly not.
---
It would be good, but Jagex seem to think tut island is the answer to solving botting
---
If a person is in the wilderness and isn't prepared to fight back, they should die in every scenario. ^/s
---
How the fuck
---
Thanks for the blog 
---
I think any granite maul change is gonna be very contentious with how iconic and widely used it is currently. I really like how it is currently and wouldn't change it for now, but I'm probably biased. 
---
I think the changes the bulwark should be targeted at its mage defence specifically. Similar to how 'metalic' armours have negative mage defence, I think it would make sense if this followed that idea more
---
Imbued capes breaking or dropping to floor for below 20 wild seems good to me, it's a lot of hassle otherwise
---
I hope there's some talk around removing the necessity of nmz to imbue rings. Perhaps from the new LMS shop?
---
Here are some examples of nonsense that would now be able to slash webs: Lunar Staff, Hosidius Banner (and every other banner weapon), Egg whisk, Barb-tail Harpoon, Cattleprod, Wooden Spoon, Spork,
---
&gt; it should still be counted, as varying perspectives, even uninformed ones are important.
---
Sure, everyones opinion "counts", just more experienced and knowledgeable ones "count" for more.   Its like asking 100 people who have never played DMM what they should change to fix it vs asking 100 people who actually do play DMM what to change.  You can listen to both, but I prefer listening to the ones with experience.  
---
You clearly are just here to argue so I'll stop wasting my time.  Everyone gets an opinion, but different opinions matter different amounts when it comes to actually being relevant.  I can have an opinion but that doesnt automatically mean my opinion is right or it means as much as someone like Torvesta of Abyss's opinion as they are more in tune with the actual Pk scene whether it be attacking or being attacked.
---
Closest lobster spot to bank, Ogress farming
---
Says the person calling me racist because he's too stupud to understand something.
---
Would increase the number of botters that get through tutorial island faster. The reason skippy was taken out, is to combat botting.
---
I lost my best buddy a few months back, known him since I was 3 years old,I know how much it ducking sucks üíôüíô
---
Best thing to do is probably stick with training slayer.
---
When you have a relevent task, for example greater demons, you could try doing some zamorak god wars, that way you get the damage and accuracy from the helmet.
---
Get defence above 80 if you're wanting to do any melee related bosses though.
---
Zulrah and vorkath you're all set for with those stats, I was doing zulrah on an ironman at 80 range and defence with a rune crossbow and ibans.
---
Because PvM good, PvP bad
---
The report abuse function is available on mobile too, so that's no excuse.
---
I do not have access to the game at this moment in time, so I can't spoon-feed you the answer, but try reading the options and thinking
---
üíôüíô
---
Must have made bonk aswell
---
Thanks for the reply, I'll tell him.
---
Thanks.
---
I have taken a second look, as I was in a bit of a rush this morning, and noticed an extra line which might explain it: "The chances of ale maturing depend of the type of ale being brewed rather than the player's¬†Cooking level."
---
I missed that first time around and took the note about the odds increasing with "the Stuff" as the flat maturity rate.
---
Unfortunately though, I can't find anything that specifies which ales have better odds. You could try tweeting at one of the Jagex Mods for clarification but I am unsure if they will respond. There is also a live streamed Q&amp;A tomorrow so you could try posting a question in the thread when it goes live and see if it gets answered.
---
100k is a joke. Up it to atleast 1m.
---
You're not the only one, I remembered it as a lot more than 50m profit.
---
You guys really want to kill the Gmaul pure, aka low lvl pk community huh
---
I think the only requirement(aside from having good enough stats/equipment) is just MM2.  They are pretty fun for PvMing and can be done with a slayer helm if you have a black demon task.
---
Going for smithing day record*
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
I think having more bosses in a non-instanced multi (like Sarachnis/GWD) is a good idea, but having requirements gives people incentive to actually do other things in the game. It also limits players so that they can feel they earned the right to enter the boss lair. In a lot of other video games, you need do a lot of things before you finally get to see the boss. GWD does this well with the KC system, and so does CoX. I expected the miniquest to be required for Sarachnis and somehow tie into being able to see the boss for the first time, but they did away with it for some reason. The story could have easily been rewritten to mention Sarachnis as this big scary thing in the tomes, and maybe something like Logosia hands you a battered key that she found in return for you adding to the knowledge of the Arceuus library with the three tomes. The key would open the lair permanently. There are so many possibilities!
---
Adding miniquests/skills makes for a more integrated experience with the rest of the game and I think it adds value.
---
My bad, I forgot.
---
Well, it could be broth... but more likely Andrew trying his best in 2003 to show steam.
---
If they nerf the defenses on it they should seriously look into giving it more benefits in PvM. Maybe percent damage reduction versus monsters only, an improvement to how to get aggro on enemies, or something like that.
---
Can Sarachnis get an optional instance mode so that players who want to have instances have the option of fighting it in this manner? Right now the boss caters to maxed players instead of the lower leveled and lower skilled players it was advertised as being targeted to.
---
Of erobbs streams or my ingame client?
---
Nah, you're purposefully ignoring what he's saying so you can get a shot in at a PvPer (and this is coming from someone who gave up PvP).
---
While I don't like the idea of the bulwark losing its main use, the devs need to add content where tank items are useful (and that's been needed for a long time). This is extremely OP in wildy. If a person can easily tank a group of PKers with just 3 items, that is OP. It'd be different if they were tanking people in salad robes and an ancient staff, but they're easily tanking players in close to BiS. High offensive gear should balance high defensive gear.. I'd like to think we agree on that?
---
If you think this is PvPers just asking for easy kills, you're ignoring the obvious issues with this and using your bias as a defense to your opinion.
---
Do rune dragons really need a buff?
---
Yes but report for what? I don't think you understand the fact you can't report these actions, they don't fall under any category.
---
/fit/'s leaking into osrs again
---
Because jagex knows, just like everyone with a brain has for years, that there is no way to monitor every fork of the client. 100% not possible. This was always a risk with an open source client. The notion that jagex talking to Adam on an intermittent, case by case basis to decide what is fair and isn't fair was a good system is laughable.
---
Remember a few years ago when jagex asked osbuddy to remove their farming timer and made the geomancy spell? Osbuddy complied. Flash forward to now, runelite has a farming timer. Jagex literally already decided this feature was unfair and asked for its removal, but haven't bothered to say anything about it to runelite. They shouldn't reasonably be expected to closely monitor every addition to every client anyone uses if anyone can make their own.
---
make clamp come from grotesque guardians please.
---
Yeah, I remember reading the original poll blog. I have no qualms about your decision in this case as far as lore is concerned.
---
My opinion is more geared towards future content as mentioned in my comment above; I think the integrated experience that you get even minimally at other places (for example, one has to do Priest in Peril to access Barrows) is the sort of thing to expect when seeing new mid-tier content. It just feels weird to be able to access Sarachnis with no requirements besides visiting Zeah once (although doesn't that just require talking to Veos?).
---
At least a small quest would be nice to see (most players seem to be more annoyed about things like skill requirements / diary requirements since those take a lot longer) for mid-tier content so that we get "introduced" to it appropriately. This is missing in a lot of older content like Mole/Barrows (there is no in-quest explanation as to why those are there unless you dig deep into the lore books) so I was hoping that In Search of Knowledge would have stayed for this new addition.
---
Also, every boss has a "level requirement" in the sense that you wouldn't be able to deal enough damage as a fresh level-3 account before dying or running out of food; it's just that some bosses have substantially higher DPS checks than others (e.g. KQ vs something like KBD or Mole), but I would like to point out that with Sarachnis being mid-tier content, level 80-90 combat with double black d'hides is perfectly fine for being able to handle it in duos/trios as a main account. A casual player could achieve that easily in 2 weeks, and a dedicated player in a few days. In this sense it's not really a soft-lock (whereas getting the stats/gear/money/supplies to handle KQ, Zulrah, Vorkath, etc. is substantially more expensive and time-intensive on any account, so the level requirement is actually substantive).
---
Nope, tired of people speaking like stupid children
---
The funny thing is the higher tier pkers will ofc use the new clamp and abuse everyone else. I myself will use it every time I go deep wildy. Knowing that a guy in salad robes probably wont have the clamp just means he pretty much has no chance of killing me.
---
Y'all docking?
---
 good? those changes lead ppl to quit the game , and we all saw back then how rs economy functions without strong pvp community
---
I thought they talked about making is a 20min system that you pay a percentage (there is a minimum) but the time only clocks down when you are logged in meaning DC won‚Äôt make you lose all your stuff
---
&gt; to be as hard to kill as possible
---
But a 5m item plus rags shouldn't be able to tank BiS gear in multiple attack styles. That's something people should be able to agree with, no matter where you lie on the pvm/pvp continuum.
---
Means I can't spec orb the zammy wizard
---
Unless AGS.. but in salad robes he will get shredded. No doubt.
---
Fucking awesome.
---
So Rockstar bought the studio?
---
Ya.
---
U guys bang for sure
---
Just go to clan wars, duel arena, or free for all safe to practice pvp.
---
Add npcs is fine. Moving and changing buildings that have been there for 18 years is not fine with me.
---
Oh man, saw this and wondered what was happening. Sad stuff. Great job folks.
---
ü¶Ä no natl dex btw ü¶Ä
---
ye pff, this guy doesn't even know about varibles
---
What about the houses with the most gp spent on them being at the top?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this is tracked but could be an incentive for people to drop massive amounts of cash on their houses and it nearly guarantees the host has what you require (eg. Alter/nexus)
---
ever heard of protection rackets/loan sharks? or where the mafia forces businesses to pay for their services at a ridiculous price?
---
Overall I am satisfied with most of the change coming next into the game, but since there was a lot of talk around death mechanics, I  don't think we should change the way item lost on death work in PvM before we have a clear understanding on what would be the death mechanics.
---
What is a role playing world anyway?
---
Kinda like ‚Äúoh hey I‚Äôm a fox follow me while I embark on this adventure through the underground pass. Put on your robe and wizard hat and stop looking at my ass‚Äù type shit?
---
True but it does help to understand football even if you don't like it

I knowwwwwww dude üôÑ Try to have an ounce of imagination
---
So many comments from pvmers who have never pked in their life. "Bulwark is balanced! I should be able to tank 15 people, 10 wilderness levels with my 3 items i protect!.  I swear thank god this isn't being polled.
---
Discord.
---
 
---
What are your thoughts on putting seemingly random rewards on Achievment diaries?
---
An example would be Lumbridge elite diaries allowing you to use Fairy rings without Dramen Staff. Lorewise, this doesnt make sense, and I think it would be more fun and make more sense if it was a reward for a future fairy quest, since we need to remove ogres from Zanaris also
---
Lvl 1 cant do either. You are combat lvl 3, when you start.
---
removing items from a game is functionally the opposite of a gold sink. Gold sinks reduce the number of gp in the game, thus making each gp more valuable in relation to the items you are buying. Item sinks reduce the number of items in the game, thus making each item more valuable in relation to the gp you are using to buy it.
---
It blows my mind that they didn't think to tie NMZ to Dream Mentor at all
---
Botting tutorial island is where jagex ban the most new bots apparently. So yeh they can bot it but they have a high chance of being banned there and then
---
Did you run out of members?
---
But then you have to do construction to make sure con stays ahead of rc

I actually like con, it's just expensive af lol

Oh I had no idea. Thank you! Was this in a previous blog post?
---
I don't think you've been playing the same tithe farm as everyone else.
---
they would start killing the boss, supply vs demand
---
Losing Imbued God Capes in PVM is stupid.
---
If players choose to take untradables into a PVP they‚Äôre accepting that they might lose it. There is already so much safety with untradables as it is with void, fire cape and such.
---
People stay in non PVP because they don‚Äôt want to lose their stuff. Don‚Äôt bring PVP balancing and mechanics to effect people that avoid doing anything wilderness related like the plague.
---
I say lets cool the fuck down trying to change a classic game. Just leave lumbridge alone. Nobody has problems learning the game. I learned this game when I was 7.
---
Even pve'ers were against the change.  Faust specifically didn't like it because he thought it devalues skilled players from switching tabs.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Then granite dust will rise in price making garg boss worth doing
---
If granite dust is tradable more people would do the boss, doesn't take a degree in economics to understand.
---
Stop trying to push rubbish "integrity" changes onto things like the bulwark in the wilders, its unfair to listen to a small minority of loud pkers at the expense of others who use it, sacrificing the ability to fight back for greater defence.  
---
Are these sorts of little changes really worth antagonising people who skill/boss in the wild
---
I used to use OSBuddy before and had pro, but there were always compatibility issues playing on my Mac. Same with runelite. Lots of client crashes and overheating. I‚Äôd suggest vanilla client.

This just seems like a question of why they have slash options.

Why is wooden spoon just a longsword

Hello, what the fuck?

It was confirmed in one of the q&amp;a streams that it was inspired by Stranger Things.

Why does she need to a good Pker to manage esports?

I thought bonds were introduced as a gold sink. To help get rid of some of the gold that the gold farmers bring in. Right?

Lol I knew this is where this was going. Gz

Lol bad you obviously not that smat , ppl dont kill the boss not cos its not profitable,  they dont kill it because the mechanics of it are sht and takes to long to kill.

No thanks. Skilling is already bad and that would make it worse. Too many resources coming in from chests/boss drops.

Seriously my favorite update since I started playing OSRS a few years ago. Keep this sort of content coming please.
---
Dang. I don't know much about UIM metas but I thought Pest Control was horribly slow, so this would be slightly faster if you had full Bandos + torture + DHL + DFS. But yeah if it's still slow then I guess the only thing this is good for (meta-wise) is to diffuse the blue dragon competition for those early-game HCIMs who want 70 Prayer. Regular irons would just do green dragons or get it passively via ensouled heads from Slayer.
---
and yet we get to the same point so now with the dust "low levels" can make 1.2m at GG , those "low levels" which ofc the ppl are doing it  it are more like 90 cb at cb stats , have atleast 10 methods to make more then kill this boss (which honestly none likes to kill).
---
Thing is runelite solves this issue half the time. You can set the portal to left click friend, and once you have typed it once can just hit enter. I'd be surprised if the board saves time
---
yes
---
If you watch high level PvMers they actually switch quite skillfully. It sounds dumb but menuing is one of the nuances of osrs combat.
---
It looks like cheating to me, I have a PhD in computer science I know how AHK works. This is literally botting with extra steps
---
Why the fk is gmail always lost on death now???? Its already a 3m cash sink... do you want to kill edge pvp?
---
The PvP community didn‚Äôt request this AFAIK. It‚Äôs a lot faster to spec using F keys anyways.
---
You're right people were tanking 3 people before bulwark, but now it is way easier.
---
I'm not a PKer, I've used the bulwark, and I know it is OP. Did I die occasionally? Sure, but I escape WAY more often, and 99% of the time it was due to that shield and getting splashed.
---
You only have to survive for around 30 seconds, and you're safe. This shield almost guaranteed you made it.
---
These are good suggestions, and they have done one or two sponsored videos or streams in the past in fact: If you remember Kripparrian did a sponsored stream, and a few youtube videos/series have been made that were sponsored (Such as the goblinman-mode series), for a few examples.
---
Still, you should post the idea to the subreddit, and include the examples I gave
---
After turning ~4M to ~300M like 5 times and hitting a ~10x loss streak I quit staking and will never go back. Instead I‚Äôm botting Zulrah and almost have an Elysian
---
Due to the fact we have alch value and shops, money will always have a constant value. The price of 1gp never changes, because however many gp will ALWAYS = this item you buy in the shop or can alch for. The money is infinite. There is no gold inflation in the game. Infact its the opposite.
---
Items while always having a minimum value due to alches are affected by inflation. A surplus of said items will reduce its price or a lack of will increase its price assuming there is demand. Every person could have infinite ammounts of gold in this game, and the price of items would not deflate, as people would simply sell said items for more.
---
We don‚Äôt need gold sinks, we need items sinks. Its important for the longevity of the game.
---
I didn't notice my fletching being one level below my RC yesterday and guess who got 3 fletching levels.
---
a 4m item shouldnt make you invincible vs a team in max. enjoy having a chance to actually die now üòâ
---
aspie
---
Devalues my Farmer outfit, keep it right click
---
Oh yea definitely. That's why I replied to Mod Husky's comment below saying that this content is good and I agree with why he made it the way he did. My qualm is with the "we need more of these" -- it would get really stale if every single new boss ended up being isolated like this so I was suggesting that this shouldn't be the go-to formula in the future.
---
You can just bring the arrows
---
The tip I got was to always sit on pray range and hover over pray mage. The animation for mage is longer so it's easier to react 
---
It took me 9 tries but I did it
---
I also recommend veracs helm and skirt and I recommend 100 dragon darts to be loaded into your blowpipe on the wave beforehand.  I also don't use eagle eye until jad and again as I'm killing the last mager I put it on and stand where I'm right in front of jads spawn 
---
It also helped when I used rue lite to highlight the healers so I can see them easier because I tunnel visioned and I used the scrolling features to scroll out a bit further to make jad looks smaller and less menacing.
---
I agree with that, a better alternative would be what was done with Blowpipe (Hitting a tick slower in PvP compare to PvM) maybe the defensive stats or EFFECT should only apply to PvM combat.
---
If you‚Äôre practicing in clan wars I assume its to improve your clicks/switching. I don‚Äôt think the change in mage defence is going to be that big of a deal in clan wars.
---
That's the whole point; to combat too many of the same item existing and over saturating the market.
---
Went to the boss last night when it was slower and every world was still full of max players. I did find one empty world but got crashed before the boss even got to half health.
---
I‚Äôve never seen the phishing sites copy these new player ads
---
And while we are at it why the fk is it an 80 percent gp sink???
---
Reminds me of when I was 17, my 5 year or so online buddy (that I'm still friends with years later) sent me a Christmas card. It said I love you cause he's a sentimental guy and my mom opened and read it, and then freaked out about stranger danger and 40 year old men (he is my age.)

Yea I was trying to learn rotation one and not only did I keep dying but if it was wrong rotation I was burning teles nonstop. With mage only rotation 3 you essentially hide from Zulrah mage phase and only attack range / melee phase .
---
I get where you're coming from, but consider this- what parts of runescape exactly are skill? I would argue that one of the primary elements of skill in runescape is interface navigation. Some people disagree, and think the interface should always be made as easy as possible to interact with. But my gripe with this sentiment is that there are not that many things in game which really are skill. You can smoothly and quickly navigate the interface, click gear to switch between it quickly (arguably a subset of interface navigation), you can out-think your opponent and beat them on mage/melee/range mixups, and you can run around in deceptive ways. That is for the most part the only skillful things that you can do in runescape. My opinion is that making any of those things easier is a bad idea, because it lessens the extent to which the game can reward skill.
---
Has happened to me too in the past... cant really explain it too
---
Maybe you changed your password before they got a chance. I‚Äôd reinstall windows too
---
100%
---
Too bad pvmers and skillers who started playing 2 years ago will throw the biggest fit ever if a game designed to have risk when you die actually had risk when you die. :)
---
People ask about different color soil after composting soil, especially after the bottomless bucket, this has been turned down for the amount of work each plant/stage/compost requires. Could we instead just remove the message you get after composting from the filtered game message list? Most players filter game messages and thus miss this important message. It would be a quick fix to a common problem.
---
A d hide nerf to mage defence would probably be better than the bulwark change for PvP.
---
The rat using Dclaws look so cute!
---
It already does this (sorta). When I‚Äôm ‚Äòblock‚Äô mode (20% damage reduction) the effect doesn‚Äôt kick in till you‚Äôve been wearing the shield for 5 seconds. I guess people got salty that bulwark and karils at dark crabs made you basically invulnerable
---
&gt; The cost of the clamp shows how incompetent mods are
---
The only incompetence of the mods in this case is not doing it 10 years ago.
---
Ya

Butts
---
Everything has to stay ahead of rc if that's what you want Tears of Guthix to go toward
---
A lot of people find that construction stays untrained like rc, but con is way faster/easier than rc, it's just expensive.
---
In rs you need both types of sinks
---
&gt; You're just trying hard to invent absurd scenarios.
---
because that's how things work. If new things get added, people look for obscure &amp; absurd scenarios
---
Remember boat stalling cerberus?
---
It's important to think about these scenarios because they could have big impacts
---
Also it's hard to understand what you mean by "short time" or "non disruptive"
---
does it just show a message in your chat saying "solve the captcha in the next hour or your account gets locked", if so people would be even more likely to miss it
---
non disruptive &amp; hard to miss are about polar opposites
---
also what happens if a player logs out during that period? if it removes it, bot clients would simply log out sometime after it appears to ignore it, if it's not removed it would again be even easier to miss
---
it's easy to say "MAKE THIS" and when people raise issues with it go, "WELL OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T MAKE IT LIKE THAT"
---
That‚Äôs very cool
---
Ingame client. I wanna see what it looks like.
---
I don't struggle with it, it is just extremely click intensive and the xp for the time spent is good if you want to quickly finish a level or something, but in the total time spent to get that xp, doing tree/fruit tree runs is significantly higher than tithe farm. Assuming you don't click any tiles for movement you have 200 clicks for planting all of the seeds. You need to water the plants 3 times, 2 clicks to water a plant resulting in another 600 clicks. That is 800 clicks you need to do at a bare minimum (assuming no clicks for refilling watering cans, moving, etc) for 25 points in the game.
---
Even just giving the left click water option to the plants removes 300 clicks from every round. Assuming 20 minute games that reduces the clicks/minute down from 40 to 25 which is a significant improvement.
---
It is the sheer click intensity require for tithe farm in its current state that makes me not go back to it to get the watering can and farmer's outfit.
---
Jagex talking about nerfing the hell out of an iconic weapon that has been in the game since January 2005 without a poll and this community is more upset about a 2017 uncommon tank shield getting a slight nerf...
---
OSRS doesn‚Äôt have much longer left with the ‚ÄòOS‚Äô title.
---
Spec should kill the splasher then I support. High risk high reward
---
What lol? I genuinely can't tell if you're agreeing with me or not.
---
People do tick manipulation there, but there are also a lot who don't because it's challenging and requires way more focus. There is a big difference between skilling manipulation and pvp manipulation.
---
Are you saying there isn't a no xp waste mindset in this game lol?
---
Damn I didn't know Hungrybox played rs
---
How do you have 40m but can't do jad?
---
Get runelite and it will draw a box exactly where you should dig
---
They are actually pretty useful for doing clues as there are quite a few near the Outpost and at the wizards tower.
---
No, not with the current effect anyway. It would be a big increase in smithing xp rates.
---
What are your thoughts on updating achievement diaries to include content that was added after them, such as MM2 and DS2. A healthy compromise would be to remove more generic tasks from the diary and replace them with area-specific ones. The reward for recompletion of diaries could be an exp lamp worth half the original.
---
Very deep into kc. Nice job! Got mine at 1574
---
Yes its crashable
---
I don't think so. Just honest opinion lol
---
This is how I got them on my iron.
---
Try force spawning randoms more often. There's a swampletics episode that goes over a decent amount of the strategy to spawn randoms.
---
OR...

He deserves to be banned...
---
&gt; . Overeating is the only reason mains use the G-maul. You can't nerf the G-maul and let people sit at 120 hp; people will rarely die. 
---
fwiw you haven't been able to overeat in combat with anglers for 8 months now, you need to brew to overheal
---
My wife and I had to put our 17 year old pug down last month. I feel your pain friend üíô
---
No, an idiot.
---
What is the most time consuming aspect of creating new content? Graphics, code, QA, etc.
---
I‚Äôm commenting this like a broken record but I‚Äôm at 11k Zulrah kc and dry for pet. I must be on the list by now
---
Yeah but the damage reduction doesn‚Äôt actually work in PvP
---
That little guy looks like your stereotypical Birmingham  Southern Student... private Christian college and I'm sure he touches children.
---
Just go kill steel dragons for 15 minutes and you'll have some
---
Literally the upper level cannot.
---
Yeah, God forbid a giant shield actually saves your life.
---
OP in PvP
---
Useless in PvM
---
= Easy Nerf.
---
Currently if you die in a raid and respawn nothing gets damaged so why would you think that would be made different? Weird argument
---
Start by making it mandatory for stakers at the sand casino to deposit their banks before entering the duel arena.
---
You overestimate how fast the average player learns
---
Or 45
---
i really like this idea purely cause of how fucking boring the granite maul makes pking, especially at low levels
---
My Chihuahua/Min Pin mix is 10 now. It really does suck when you know how hard it is going to hit you when the day comes. RIP sweet doggo
---
üíô much love my guy üò≠
---
bulwark is insanely op lol wtf it should be removed
---
I have a more OG account than hers. Been playing since classic, you don‚Äôt see me complaining about starting fresh. RS3 is a joke with all its MTX.
---
If one of the alternatives is an item worth 1b,thays not really a valid alternative lmao
---
Yeah I know, I should be able to gather the supplies without pvm though, nearing 60 base stats where rcbow is actually useful. There should be alternatives instead of going to 92 smithing
---
Damn that‚Äôs nuts. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve made absolute bank there though!
---
Are you F2P or P2P? I was able to train smithing at no cost/slight profit with darts.
---
Tier 50 gear that costs 30k should not be BiS in all brackets.
---
Leave the Bulwark alone
---
Is that screenshot from when the player online counter was broken?
---
There definitely isn't, like maybe 1% of players have that mindset, the other 99% want to progress their account in meaningful ways but also don't care about maximizing their XP gains 24/7.
---
I wonder if the want more of them to get into the game first before they actually do something like that
---
Yeah, every pure basically uses range to granite maul combo and its deadly
---
99 hunter barehand lucky imps. Boom rune crossbow
---
God damn, and I felt bad for my \~500 on my hcim, I pray you get one soon, and that nobody ever goes that dry again
---
You know if you use an alt acc to kill it then go in it wont attack you
---
A king must know these things
---
Me mad at intern for brake my immersion
---
It looks nice.
---
Magic rework would be huge and really impact pures (although pures are a little OP for a similarly cmb zerk). Honestly though of the combat triad, it IS the one that needs the most leveling.  Based on the likelihood of splashing, you're almost way better ranging through range prayer than switching, but of course that doesn't promote talent in switching and  praying in NH.
---
Bulhwark change is huge and something that would be welcome in PvP.  It's too OP for sure. Pvmers should not be nearly invincible in the wildy doing anything. Plus 10 point difference won't   
---
 break the shield.
---
Most of the changes look pretty good imo.
---
Not the best example. Another perk it has is that pouches never degrade.
---
What do you mean not halfway? He‚Äôs past 49 in many skills!
---
Gold bars are 250k xp/h darts are 50k.
---
but 4-2-1-1 doesnt kill the guy :/
---
If you have a weapon with a special attack bar, you can click another weapon, click the special attack bar, and click your opponent all in one tick to get the special attack out without giving your opponent time to react to you switching to the special attack weapon. 
---
Weapons without a special attack bar cannot do this, since the spec bar doesn't show up until you've already switched to the special attack weapon. 
---
Enabling the orb in pvp would change the balance of these items, and it was therefore disabled.
---
ok? idk why you are talking about only alchables as if they are the only items in the game.
---
i didnt say alchables dont alch for ge value, i said not all items alch for ge value.....not all items are alchables.
---
I'm torn on this one. Unless a clan is on you, you are basically invincible with a bulwark currently, and you expose no risk.
---
Admittedly, I'm not a great pker, but when I'm out there I usually don't even try to attack people with bulwarks. I've done it too many times - it results in a long ass chase where you use a ton of runes and even if you kill them, you get like 100-200k. It's just not worth it.
---
Maybe the bulwark should not get a stat nerf, but have it drop like 1m if you are killed with it. Then the owner has to pay 1.5m to repair it.
---
There's plenty of skill for both parties involved. You need to hit them off prayer as the pker and you need to read the pker's attacks to catch them as the victim, especially their special attack. External resources need to be played around as well, like using npcs or stairways. 
---
A skilled victim will likely always get away from a shitty pker, and a skilled pker will likely always kill a shitty victim. That's the definition of skill expression.
---
&gt; make granite dust tradable
---
Would be fucked for PvM then since it's a huge buff to Cannon. Would make more sense as a different item.
---

Thanks Nitpicky Man!
---
More like "we made this shield to be useful in PvM, but turned out to be OP in PVP, we can't fix the first but at least we can fix the second".
---
What did it cost?
---
And?  He says he wants to train smithing cheaper, I gave him an option.  I don't know how he plays. I play this game mostly AFK at work so it worked well for me.
---
Sounds overly complicated. A big thing about OSRS that people love is how simple and straight forward the combat works.
---
Disclaimer: I'm still leveling up and can't do this content yet, so there might be a few misconceptions reflected in my question.  
---
Why don't make the spider seal the entrance (only entering the chamber, not exiting it) after 10 seconds of combat, it would stop crashing in the middle of the fight, people outside the chamber would get a message saying "The entrance to the chamber seems to be sealed with spider net and you can't pass right now". Also make people hopping worlds inside the chamber tele'd outside the entrance at login. This could "simulate" an instance and people could still join for the next fight.
---
Because the autotypers are fucking annoying for one. If there‚Äôs a board I‚Äôm just gonna use the board...
---
Also I‚Äôm sure people will figure out how much money they‚Äôre making/paying and eventually bids will go down to where it‚Äôs profitable
---
I think it's good enough as it is
---
without granite maul pures that combat bracket will just be a ton of obby maulers safing against each other. It is a good change for max main pking since you wont be able to ags insta gmaul for over max hp, but its not like it will make the lower combat brackets super exciting and fun.
---
Will we ever see expansions on existing areas of the game which were obviously more or less still in construction or in the middle of some storyline at the time of OSRS' backup?
---
For example, Keldagrim is currently a huge city. And one of the more unique and interesting places in Runescape together with The elven lands. And the quests "Rise of the red Axe" was only just getting started at the time. Will we ever see new content/quests added to those places. As I feel it is more pertinent to fill out existing content before adding massive landmasses like Zeah, which feels very empty currently (its getting filled up. But my point still stands)
---
That has the same PLU as the ginger at the store where I work
---
Yeah man let me just throw away my money
---
right...like i said, removing alchables is similar to removing gold. removing non alchables is not...
---
A Friend doesn't live in the states though
---
I‚Äôm not the one who got the drops lol.
---
You're just assuming I think they're the only items in the game, I was clearly talking about alchables specifically in my comment and you chimed in with *non*-alchable talk, which is pretty irrelevant to my point, I never said alchables are the only items that would be put in there, I just said that alchables would ALSO be put in there, and let's be real here, WAY more than non-alchables.
---
we pay we gay
---
Then let them use autotyper lol. There will be others who use the board as prices dip Bc less people are using them and honestly if the board is a thing then that‚Äôs 100x more convenient than those spammy autotypers
---
I see someone has never noodled 50 specs in a day...
---
but, yeah the gmaul is broken, sad to see this, but gonna stay open minded til the meta shakes out a bit
---
Go do some quests. Ds2 will give you mythical cape. Wear it proudly while people have no clue what you are wearing.
---
I don't really get it either, it's absurd that an item that is a super rare drop for endgame content, that's completely useless in pvm is being nerfed out of pvp. I don't understand why they even released bulwark at this point.
---
I kinda get where you're coming from, but paradoxically the reason I don't support the nerf as proposed is it really isn't strong enough, but nerfing it harder takes a niche item and makes it useless.
---
I can recover 7/10 points lost...with an amulet of defence. I'll risk that all day with my shield and d'hide. Furthermore, I'm assuming people risking a neck slot to begin with use a glory; seems unlikely people would risk a fury or better when using the DB. So it's actually risking *less* GP after the nerf.
---
The real problem (I think) is wealth transfer via the wildy. We need to answer the question "how much money is being transferred by killing PvM players in the wildy?" before we talk about nerfing niche items. PvM players risk very little in the wildy, and the PvP community seeks to wish they risked more.
---
 If people were calling for something radical like automatic skulls after 30 wilderness, that might actually loosen things up. It might also beat the last inch of life out of the wilderness.
---
why though 
---
No seriously, I get that most games have this "tank" trope, but why on earth should OSRS be one of them, especially when we have incredibly powerful gear already, like justiciar and ely? 
---
Defence is already one of the more powerful builds in pvp (rigour and piety), and an absolute *must* if you want to pvm (I know you can raid with 1 def, different discussion) generally, and you want to make it even better? 
---
How would you even go about it? Boost all defensive gear? It'd just make the current itens more powerful. Make new sets like justiciar, but better? Would *completely* destroy certain content like bandos, and maybe even the inferno
---
I truly feel like people who encourage this idea has next to no knowledge on how pvm works in the later stages. How would you even inplement this without breaking the current game? I want specific solutions, otherwise you're getting zero support from me
---
Is it gonna be an alchable if it gets nerfed?
---
It's pretty much a guaranteed tank out of the wilderness in pvp if you have a brain
---
Honestly though this would make a huge difference.  It's hard to know though because in certain places freezes are OP in other places they're really needed.
---
"Takes nerves out of the equation"... to hell it does! If I died on Galvek that was half my bank gone!
---
Its late for this but when you log in it tells you the last time you logged in. Also as suggested reinstall windows to make sure its not a rat. Change your bank pin and if possible look into KeePass or LastPass. If your password is not random its not secure as you think.
---
Imagine unironically doing pvp in 2019.
---
The first season is really rough IMO, but if y'all can power through that then its definitely worth a watch.
---
What happened to the [new Death Mechanics](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/protecting-game-integrity-upcoming-changes?oldschool=1) that was proposed over a year ago as part of a 'Game Integrity' update? It was looking like it was coming in to the game relatively soon except we have not heard anything about it since.
---
&gt;the pattern should always be risk -&gt; reward
---
If most pvmers/skillers don‚Äôt attack back, there is no risk to the pker by attacking them. Therefore they aren‚Äôt entitled to a reward. 
---
I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight, I‚Äôve literally never owned a bulwark, don‚Äôt need to do wildy altar or black Chins anymore, don‚Äôt pk, etc... it just seems like from an outside perspective pkers are mad that their ‚Äúfree loot‚Äù has a viable strategy to combat them.
---
I ban elves, iron drags, steel drags, spiritual warriors
---
The next boss is gonna drop a Jar of Bathwater
---
Well they could use default chat and technically not be breaking any rules. 
---
Still makes this proposed content completely useless.
---
it's risk 10M bh points, which is more like 4-5m, so yeh rip 50 att pures lmao.
---
Yeah, I used my words poorly.. \^\^;
---
This is nothing short of fantastic. Burst out laughing at work. Thank you, OP
---
No
---
It‚Äôs comparable to the dagger, they cost about the same. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs BiS or you would see everyone using it over dagger, godsword, etc.
---
Is it cheap in comparison to a lot of weapons, sure, the price needs to be increased.
---
If someone wants to pay a ton of money to sink gold sellers gp than that's great. who cares about their üëë
---
I know no one cares :'( boohoo
---
Neopets wishing well
---
nobody would see it. default public chat ("on" setting) does not display inbuilt autotyper
---
osrs has had that as well lmao, not a new idea
---
WINNER WINNER WINNER
---
how stupid do you have to be ?
---
So basically pker‚Äôs can‚Äôt kill some one training prayer
---
WE TAKIN OVERRRRRRR
---
I failed 5 or 6 times on Jad.
---
If you are on runelite use it to select the lower ping worlds. Every ms counts.
---
Good luck!
---
Imagine a 2handed tank shield being able to tank shit. Unbelievable
---
Literally revenge because we voted no to the mtx poll that didnt pass last week
---
99 IQ
---
Yes it would pass, Jam flex would forget about blast furnace and assume rates would only come from superheating/furnace.
---
Bruv, I've got 1 mil to my name.
---
On the plus side I got my first ever whip after playing since like 2005
---
I'm totally in favour of the mage capes being protected in sub 20 wildy as well as everything that breaks in sub 20 wildy/pvp worlds and needs to be repaired becoming a PvM thing too. Not in things like raids but someone who dies at say GWD or ran out of prayer afk'ing slayer or something
---
he almost got hit
---
its literally used at every cb bracket for every build wdym
---
&gt;dude just walk I‚Äôve lost a few billion at the ge. nothing you can do but plot your revenge
---
Revenge against the GE??
---
Cherish the good times brother, all I can say.
---
If you remove 1k bandos tassets from the game, their price inflates, thus serving the same purpose as a gold sink. People only want to remove gold so that the cost of items doesn‚Äôt gradually decrease over time, right?
---
Dude their pose and just the whole vibe of this post makes them come off as a total flamers
---
As you said this is illegal money. Botters will get more irl money to set up more bots with. And that will easily result into more illegal items/money in the game.
---
That's their problem tbh, if they're not cannoning despite it being the efficient way to train Slayer, then they're just limiting themselves for no reason. Making tradeable granite dust is just another blanket Slayer buff.
---
Seems too op
---
what‚Äôs the command for that hmmmm
---
you dont have to 1t flick at jad....
---
look at my invent
---
I'm not saying I dont get it, just doesn't look right to my autistic ass. I'm halfway thinking about photoshoping it myself for some closure but I'll probably just get really high and continue living life. Dope picture though
---
D
---
99 slayer tho
---
*Jagex wants to know your location*
---
This is bad fix. Just makes bulwark even worse in pvm. And it will still be no skill way to survive in wildy
---
Bulwark is used far more in the wilderness than in PvM though. The only PvM use I can think of is tightrope.
---
I'm only talking about single in my comment. In multi the op defence can be countered by more people.
---
I‚Äôd say pking but those looting bots make that not very effective. I agree 100% we need item sinks though.
---
Good idea, it's a hard life, sometimes I feel like I'm drowning.
---
Umm what? Yeah let me just throw my gp into something that does nothing for me?
---
I'll let Jagex add EOC to osrs before I support socialism for devs
---

It's more that money making for 4 hours and smithing for 1 is way more efficient even if you're very bad at making money
---
You have to talk to the fairy godfather for a clue and he talks completely normally during the dialogue. Look at how they massacred my boy.

Just make lumby multi...

Choosing not to sell birdhouse seeds is the same thing as getting a large cash reward and buying the seeds
---
If you're worried about gp/xp you should sell your valuable seeds and buy more cost effective ones with the profits
---
Thx bro
---
I love the idea, but unfortunately the pro about no development time being needed isn't actually true.  
---
This would indeed take effort to develop and implement, especially if we're talking about individual quantities of objects instead of a running value total. They've said before, and I think this is idiotic, even altering various highscores and various tracking takes engine work.  
---
That's not to say this isn't a good idea, just that, like everything else, people drastically underestimate what goes into creating these things.
---
There's already more of those than I'd personally like within the game. Maybe a cool looking cosmetic, but I'm against chat badges as they've mostly always been known as a symbol of moderators (barring all the iron memes now)
---
I'm fine with smithing as it is tbh. Rune darts are endgame items. Rune 2h swords are like 1m/hr profit and a shit ton of gold brought into the game. Fair reward for the smithing level required. Bout all they could do is add dragon to the smithing levels, which wouldn't do shit but cause inflation.
---
This is not a gold sink, this is an item sink.
---
Yes, but automated system that would make teams or singular people fight against each other, and eventually one team would win.
---
savage
---
pair that with a new spell in Arceuus or any other spell book. Spell that draws monster aggro for something like 30 sec. And a boss that basically requires you to have a tank role or else its impossible to kill. Would be pretty neat and help with brainless max dps meta.
---
Imagine being so rich, you think 200m is chump change.
---
In Maplestory they did weekly/monthly/all time top donators I think? That could be done
---
and that's worse than running in circles or clicking the same spot repeatedly?
---
PSA: For those who haven‚Äôt tried it, Bulwark makes an awesome poor-mans Justiciar in the Inferno. In the waves where you would pray mage you can essentially run from pillar to pillar taking little to no dmg. With justiciar it makes you virtually unkillable. Super beneficial in learning mechanics or if you‚Äôre not super confident in flicking multiple monsters at once while on the move. 
---
Idk how a 6m-8m weapon deserves a nerf like that. Too many PVPers complaining about not getting enough rev/chin pks?
---
I give money to em sometimes. I know they probably dont need it and are just lazy, but maybe it makes their day 1% better and it barely affects mine (cuz I only give like 50k). So sometimes I just do it. I remember when I was younger I'd get so happy when someone gave me even 10k. Idk maybe they will be too 
---
When there are beggars and I get bothered my em I just ignore list so I cant see it. 
---
Basically I give it just cuz I feel like it and they're gonna be lazy either way so I dont super feel like it makes a difference if I do or dont
---
Pkers in general are just a giant middle finger in general and the shield just makes it hard for you to kill someone so you hate on it.
---
Deserved.
---
Rune legs and torso missing
---
&gt;Why shouldnt a team of 5 have a good chance of killing a single person?
---
A team of 5 people who are appropriately high level with strong gear can kill 1 tank 100% of the time
---
'for future bosses where tanking will be required'. Or that was the bs they said at the time anyway.
---
A rework is changing the mechanics not reducing the stats. Nice disingenuous wording.
---
I can understand it, since it ties into the general sentiment of being forced into the wilderness to do content like the chaos altar or black chins that they would normally not want anything to do with. So the shield is a huge relief in those instances. The problem is that on the other side of the coin, pkers have a huge headache to deal with of having unkillable tanks of targets.
---
"It's called hentai, and it's art"
---
I died on red dragon thrice I died on had nonce
---
Nobody in black d'hide and a bulwark would survive a teleblock against a reincarnated Manked in 500m gear unless they have other significant gear to back themselves up like a fury, imbued mage cape, serp helm or nezzy at the least, and ring of suffering imbued, alongside having a fully stocked invent of say 15 brews and 6 restores/sanfews. At that point the problem isn't the bulwark it's the brews providing 3 x the hp for tanks compared to every other piece of food available.
---
Bulwark nerf is fucking stupid. If a team is well co-ordinated you can take down a person with bulwark, do not nerf something (in its only niche area) just to cater to unskilled PKers
---
9000 clicks isn‚Äôt even that many.
---
Don't do this lol.
---
My main problem was with the healers, i got too distracted with them and missed my prayer.
---
~~No but ice barrage is~~ 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say so, it‚Äôs incredibly niche 
---
Ice barrage still hits really hard for hitting multiple targets, and the stats on the amulet are very weak compared to others 
---
Also, I can‚Äôt believe I forgot to put this, but this would work similar to the dragonbone necklace with the delay
---
You and Jamflex dont see eye to eye then. [Jiggledex has reworked the new player experience a lot of times, each time scrapping it because they don't understand what actually needed fixing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm62FB3Q6fQ)
---
Confirmation bias tells us to look around at every single one of the players who is doing just fine as proof that the new player experience works fine. But Jamtex has data that shows just how many people start and immediately quit playing. If we want to increase growth (without horrible"partnerships") we need to focus on making the new player experience something that draws new players into the world. It needs to bring new players into contact with old players, show them the huge world of runescape, and eventually encourage them to come back every so often and talk to the latest new players.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not disliking the idea. But I‚Äôll give you a con:
---
The well will get old pretty quickly, as the ante to get in on the high scores grows bigger. All items will come a point when it just isn‚Äôt reasonable to do it anymore.
---
Cu in 1-2 years
---
specific high tier 3rd age no doubt
---
I like bad luck posts more than I like good luck posts. I feel for you and I would have given up ages ago. Good Luck in the future!
---
You can get quite a few 99s with that, you're loaded tbh
---
Jesus, theres a 0.06% chance of going dry this long. Rip my dude
---
Prob a constant footer
---
Mage accuracy is the least of a pvmers issues in the wilderness. Augury + black dhides is a 20k risk setup that will make a pker splash more than a Magikarp.
---
Or they could just make new content into a money sink so it would be worth there time to do.
---
Why pay more money on something that is A hard to get and B cosmetic.
---
dude have you talked to Oziach?
---
Doooood thats bad
---
Join litteraly any clan. And then leave that clan for another till u find one u like
---
Bulwark nerf is fucking stupid. If a team is well co-ordinated they can still take down a person with bulwark, do not nerf something (in its only niche area) just to cater to unskilled PKers...lmfao shit ‚Äúrework‚Äù
---
I was enjoying the 1-hit videos tho! Jk gz
---
Make a gargoyle alt and camp them while you play your main I‚Äôm pulling down 37m a week while on the road to max
---
Forgot to put this in the post, but the amulet would also have a delay similar to the Dragonbone necklace.
---
just make an actual item sink that's part of interesting gameplay instead of having an optional incinerator for people who stake too much
---
Hydra was fun for the first 200kc
---
Yeah your right I should kill a boss for it, not use my bow making skills to make a bow. That's insanity. The point of ironman mode is that I get everything, using my skills on my own. At the combat level I am the only resource I shouldn't get from training combat is food. They put in content for normies just fine, that spider boss, a multi combat med level team boss. Soloing it is aids on a med level iron. Maxed is w/e. Just cuz u dont got an iron doesnt mean all irons need to suffer.
---
I like turtletale and by release
---
To add onto this idea: whats better than a 100 trillion gold sink? A 100 trillion gold sink gold sink. 
---
At level 97 construction, there's a new sink option added: it's the exact same model as the basic sink, but this one, my boys, is gold. And I'm not talking "uses one gold leaf in construction" gold, I'm talking pure, solid, "takes 100 gold leaves to construct" gold. This sink can obviously be packed (although if you're even remotely thinking of buying a sink that costs 13m you've got enough money to afford 97 construction), with Jagex making sure the gold sink price on the GE remains far above the material price.
---
Once you've got the sink, it functions exactly the way your gold sink does. The only difference is this one is a literal gold sink and has a 13m buy in. Also this one functions as a sink, so that's an added bonus.
---
No fuck you and fuck all pkers.
---
The only reason people are for it is because they want easy kills.
---
Fairly meh game? Why? I had a lot of fun playing through D3
---
No reason why they couldn't do both!
---
I don't usually bother woox walking with a dhcb, I didn't find it saved me much each kill time due to the reduced damage, worth it at hydra but I much prefer the chiller vorkath kills and longer trips with dhcb.
---
Definitely expected more jokes about how they're both high af
---
I already explained this:
---
\&gt;Bulwark sacrifices all ability to fight back.
---
It's a purely defensive item.
---
Hyahyahyahyahya haha. Wow.
---
Sorry lemme fix that for you. High risk low reward.
---
Literally the reason I cant stand rendi
---
I know hill giants are shit both gp and combat xp wise, I was just wondering how do they give construction xp? Maybe he thought about long bone drops
---
remember to sell your granite mauls, they'll be high alch value soon
---
Okay sure if they did that then maybe it would be OP for PVP. Then in that case they could nerf its speed everywhere. I don't think the blowpipe as it is currently in PvM is necessarily healthy for the game anyway so yeah I would prefer the consistency in game mechanics
---
Not a pker, and I use the shield. I also agree it's OP, because one item shouldn't be able to stop close-to-BiS offensive gear with such ease.
---
It's pretty pathetic of you to say they're a middle finger for attacking others in the only zone that is focused around PKing. Do you think before you post?
---
I know this, I've had rcbows on my iron before. I'm saying I should be able to bring more into the game at my skill level than I am. There's a whole skill devoted to making bows. What I'm asking is to use my bow making skills to make a fucking bow, instead of killing a damn boss.
---
Why would perdu need to repair it if you charge it with lava scales?
---
I own 8 pets. I‚Äôm not tryna pay for them like that, I grinder them out, why should be paying a monthly fee to keep what is rightfully mine.
---
Item sinks make inflation higher, gold sinks make it lower
---
If everyone had 100gp and there was 1000 items in the world, everyone could buy one for 10gp. 
---
If half the gold disappeared everyone could buy one for 5gp
---
If half the items disappeared everyone could buy one for 20gp
---
The wilderness isn't safe. There shouldn't be an item that gives you 100% chance to 'make it'. With that shield and black dhide a mid level account could tank a max account in max pk setup from the fence all the way to edgeville 9\\10 times...that's broken dude.   
---
I don't understand why nonpkers have such a hard time admitting simple things like this.
---
Void is is barely bis anywhere. I agree that it's strong, a bit too so, even, but the only immediate places I can think of where it's bis, is when ranging in tob
---
I'm all for making bosses hit heavy, but I just don't see any work around aside from just making hits rng such as at bandos. And even then, DPS will still be king. I just don't see any solutions that are "good"
---
Thanks for including your magic level in that, I was worried the 0 xp splash idea would ruin specifically your magic training.
---
Sort by construction rank / XP / level / and what they are offering as host, maybe list the features they have in their house
---
Too many hours to get the fighter torso.
---
\&gt;You should have to wear karils in order to tank ahrims, and Arma to tank ancestral. It's really that simple.
---
Not how this game was made or ever intended to work.
---
yo this guy gets it
---
I mean it's not objective that 200m isn't a lot. It's just based on how much items cost rn, 200m won't get you even half of a max gear set (obviously excluding tbow and scythe).
---
Jagex : no one brings avernic defender in the wilds because it costs 1m every death not creating the huge gold sink we want 
---
Also Jagex : increasing it to 1.25m on death should fix the problem
---
Feels arbitrary
---
It might shift the competetive in-game culture a bit in an unpredictable manner, and could seem as intrusive if a permanent well gets implemented in the nostalgic version of Runescape. That's the only objections I can come up with spontaneously.
---
Yeah, I don't think this update has much to do with niche f2p clan pking in deep wildy. They're trying to get more people to participate in general PvP in F2P, and mage has scarcely had a place in the past here.
---
That's why they aren't polling it, they are just doing it and calling it an integrity change.  Can't wait for those MTX integrity changes I am sure their accountants think are necessary.
---
Ahh thank god, thought they were getting robbed lmao, i was watching wild mudkips new vid as you replied
---
Its only 5m because its useless, its the same drop rate as ancestral.
---
Don't kill people in the dedicated kill people zone, got it.
---
&gt;currently it's the only thing they can use to have a decent shot at surviving.
---
I feel like this is the most important thing. Even if bulwark is OP it's not like there's a whole lot of counterplay outside of it
---
Attention whores contributing to money sinks? sounds alright
---
all the pvmers scared because they'll have to prayer switch when they get attacked now :(
---
In today‚Äôs episode of Wilderness Rejuvenation we will be toying with the idea of having no PvMers to target at all!
---
Have you seen Warcraft after release of Warcraft 3?
---
Don't worry, the game is boring af once you have all the max gear, if you don't intend to max and have awful pet luck then there's nothing to aim for
---
It's not that single item. It's that item, plus all other worn items, plus their magic and defence levels, plus prayer.
---
jesus christ that was sad
---
The quantities are stored on the item. There are no more bits. They could make a separate bag, though.
---
Thats not because of lag
---
Dafuqq
---
Thing is, nobody brings a real self defense set up lol. You think a whip with 7 sharks will save you from a total geared out hybrid player?
---
Everyone doing wildly chores is doing just that. Chores. Why do you think clue hunters only carry a shovel? 
---
Why do you think Jagex has to lure players to wildy (ex. Wildy slayer, wildy keys, new zam wine, bis items)  so much? They do that because nobody really pk‚Äôs. Wildy activity is dormant. On top of being dormant, you want people to keep using an invincible shield so that killing players is now even less of a thing already?
---
Sounds like they stuck to the ‚Äúme troll dumb‚Äù theme quite well!
---
prob just leather chaps
---
Again ‚Äî my point isn‚Äôt that the bulwark makes it impossible to kill people, that it makes it unjustly hard.  People who WANT it to be that broken are the ones complaining about the nerf. 
---
How are you so lost only 2 comments in.
---
Then what is it ?
---
??
---
Hi serene. I'm seeing a lot more activity from you lately. Did your parents give you your computer back?
---
I just use the official client, but from what I‚Äôve read the client doesn‚Äôt seem to make a difference. It doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any real solution other than waiting for 10.14.6 and hoping that fixes it or going back to High Sierra.
---
The only problem is that RC isn't bad, if you do it properly through lavas, nats, or zmi.
---
Welcome to MTX intrgrity changes, coming to a game near you soon!
---
Back when draining run energy was as effective as a freeze
---
I haven't! I will add that to my list! Thank you
---
Thank you so much dude!
---
Why
---
The thing is, bulwark allows people with no skill to tank far too easily. On the wrong prayers, it's massive def bonus outweighs the rng of a pker's hits most of the time resulting in 0's. This change will help a little bit. Bulwark will still be used by all the same people who currently use it. IT IS AN INTEGRITY CHANGE BECAUSE OF THIS.
---
range as a whole needs nerf, rigours way to strong and every range wep is way to accurate.
---
I remember a similar suggestion to this which proposed that players could gain cosmetic pieces (capes, hats, etc.) that showcase their wealth by donating to the gp sink
---
"I know I won't get a lot of people to do this with me" ...
---
You sir are correct. Have a nice day.
---
Motherfuck...
---
- Do you have a fire cape/fighter torso/void?
---
- Complete all Easy/Medium achievement diaries
---
- Work towards higher combat stats for bossing
---
- Work towards getting base 40/50 stats
---
Setting goals is the best way to keep motivated
---
It's not useless, it's very strong in its niches.
---
Those look good. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
EVERYONE WHO CURRENTLY USES THE BULWARK TO TANK IN THE WILDERNESS WILL STILL USE IT. THIS IS WHY IT IS AN INTEGRITY CHANGE.
---
It's amazing at the Chaos altar. Gets rid of most pkers. They better not nerf this beauty.
---
It's not useless the whole reason for the nerf is that it is incredibly overpowered in PVP scenarios and it only costs 5m.
---
Damn I can get lost in these
---
Recreating OSRS
---
Straight to bcp lad
---
please uninstall the game.
---
Tons of games have shitty WoW-like combat, too. Should we add EoC?
---
Ironman mode
---
Do they want people to throw it away with the rest of the items considered as "trash"? Wow. Don't nerf this.
---
If they're fighting someone with a bulwark they're not really risking 300m tho because they literally can't fight back
---
Which minigames? In castle wars you can't equip it when you're holding a flag.
---
Thats why i said pick a location. Im guessing i will be farther from safety. But im not opposed to starting at black chins with 6 traps and some chins. Tho chances are youll double splash before i get to the 30 line. Wont happen all 5 times but i feel that youd want all 5 chances. 
---
Its reasonable lol. I could camp a pvp world and just freeze log if we want to be 100% realistic (and this is what should be required). People solo/duo pk way more than people having 30 man teams. Im also not gunna xlog or it would be way to easy for me too.
---
Were sorry you can't participate in the only skill based thing in rs.
---
My authenticator was removed without my email being compromised, all while using unique information not related to anything.  
---
Also I never received an email from jagex stating it was removed, so gg.
---
i just run around for my clues with black dhide and the 15% magic prayer with mage protect. pikachu face when they cant land.
---
Doesnt that degrade? Or if nothing else cost a small country?
---
no you sound like a dumbass
---
On behalf of f2p, is there anything being currently in development to tone down the swarm of bots in f2p? Could anything be done at all? Like, keep banned players' IP addresses for future reference?
---
Your comment proves you know nothing about this lmao. If you did you would know, it will still be used just as much because it is by farrrrr the cheapest option to obtain the massive def bonus. The nerf is soooo minimal, it's not making it USELESS FOR THE WILDERNESS it's making it A LITTLE LESS POWERFUL BUT STILL THE STRONGEST OPTION FOR ITS PRICE.
---
I have a PhD
---
except forcing someone to use these items would make them go up exponentially, especially if the drops on this hypothetical boss are good, meaning itd only be usable to the 1%, which is dumb. power to the people, rise up
---
?
---
Is it weird that i can hear the song from reading this ?
---
Why? Why would any player who values their account willingly throw shit into it? For an arbitrary high score?
---
&gt;"Game improvements"
---
&gt;When the Bulwark was released it was looking to fill a niche in PvM to enhance a tanker's ability to help the team when group bossing. As time has gone on, it's clear that the shield has very few limited uses outside of aiding in wilderness protection. This isn't a problem in itself however, in its current format, it gives the player high invulnerability when combined with certain equipment/protection prayers. We would like to reduce its Defence bonuses by -10 in Stab, Slash, Crush, Magic, and Ranged. 
---
What a joke. They're saying that the shield has limited uses and that they're instead gonna elimate all of its uses. Ridiculous
---
What about calculating the "worth" of the house and putting the most expensive houses on top? It would give an incentive to upgrading everything all the way even when the higher level piece doesn't offer any other advantage than aesthetics, and the most expensive house will likely have everything a good host would need.  It would act as a gold sink without deincentivizing using the post board by charging to advertise directly.
---
Tbh the clamp should fall off on death and cost 1m to reattach it to Gmaul. Make it a gold sink.
---
Reduce by -10?
---
Wouldn't that be +10 then? Panic by Bulwarks.
---
Same
---
everything about your narrative is off as alch value‚â†market value, this is why your nonsense such as  
---
&gt;We don‚Äôt need gold sinks, we need items sinks.
---
doesnt make sense. youre too uneducated to reasonably dispute the need for gold sinks.
---
Next update: the dragon dagger special attack has been changed to 60% and requires a 10m upgrade to change back.
---
Is this fix PvP?
---
You don't forfeit the ability to fight back since the block option doesn't reduce damage in PvP. And it's fine and in fact the meta to gear up for tanking when going to pvm/skill in the wildy, but the point of concern is whether the gear available is balanced so that tanking with a 6m shield doesn't have a 99% success rate
---
Entangle being enabled absolutely effects the clan scene both in the wilderness and in the clan wars arena. It directly has an impact on the fights and how the clans war.
---
Air con failure in the DC is fun, open all the doors, deploy the temporary fans :)
---
as if pvpers are going to purgatory lmao
---
Yeah man I didn't have much time to play because my parents are split and my mom swore video games were a gift from satan, so I mostly spent my time that I could play at my dads, killing chickens and cows lol. I think I got to cb level 40 or so before RS2 was released. I met some good buddies on this game, one in particular I still keep in touch with through Xbox LIVE and we text back and forth quite a bit. It's crazy to think one of my longest friendships is from a video game I've played off and on for 16 years...
---
Yes but aren't we specifically talking about sinking specific items to increase their gold value?
---
well, it would have to be more damage to kill, and NPC's can't overhit unlike players in PvP, so I guess it would end up being 6-3-1-0 \~ not certain.
---
I don't do main edge fights/dh fights. I was specifically pointing out the 120hp thing. 
---
I always bring a brew on my pure, but I'm never using it to overheal.
---
Remove Nightmare zone and then I'll give a shit about splashing. Until then, pandoras box has already been opened.
---
I'm so hyped about the tithe farm changes
---
So if  I get it right, you can dump 100k feathers and ashes etc.  and become nr.1 on the highscore in no-time since the highscore is valued in items not gp?
---
Jagex: This item its useful in certain niche situations, let's eliminate its usefulness altogether
---
Lmfao.
---
It's probably going to be easier to nerf bulwark, something nobody uses (except near max combat mains hunting chins), than nerf black d hide.
---
Could it be possible to have different shaded hit splats on npcs to differentiate between your hits and other players? Also another shade for a max hit? Loved this feature in the original game.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
You could try, I had the neit so I used it
---
I did share it to a lot of places though, maybe some people refreshed or viewed comments, changing it to allow their vote.

---
I average 2 minutes/kill with rune darts, 2:30 min with Addy Darts with this set up at 97 range.
---
Fuck me the maths in this thread is beyond attrocious
---
That's not an advantage when the person they're trying to kill never had the intention of fighting back in the first place.
---
Like u said thats like trying to be the next lebron to earn more than the average person with a degree. Its not probable. 99.9% wont ever earn more than they could with zulrah.
---
The problem is not dinh's, it's black d'hide. Hides are wayy to tanky versus melee and also maybe ranged.
---
you simply risked less and it was only changed to combat ddose.  Its been stated by mods so many times that the way it is now will not stay.
---
Devil's advocate: you should have to consider getting some buddies to come along for protection
---
That's just OP in general. That would change the meta for so many bosses to be just "bring a full inventory of brews and nothing but bulwark then sit there and chug brews".
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I did it too.
---
But a DFS is a 1-handed shield. Bulwark is a massive 2h shield so it should have very good tank stats since the shield sucks for offense.
---
Is it because of the gmaul or the bulwark?
---
Don't go in the wildy if you don't want to get attacked you fuckin brainlet.
---
They have to find it though the board is what I understand, not really sure what makes it work or not tbh
---
Pkers can't stand that people are "getting good" and actually using some tactics while escaping. 
---
It's kinda dumb to nerf the shield where it's biggest use case is in the wild. Might as well just remove it from pvp if you're gonna go that route. 
---
Anyways the problem isn't in the shield itself it's just more people are just getting smarter about the wilderness. Using escape routes, flower logging, three iteming.  Nerfing the shield won't stop people from trying to figure out the best ways to escape pkers. 
---
The people that likely are complaining are not that good at pvp by themselves. Often it's why they are in deep wild instead of pvp world's or bh. So it makes sense why the people that would complain about this are complaining.
---
Make the person buy airtime for gold to advertise the altar
---
The coif barely has any atk bonus, but the neit has a big chunk of ranged defense, so it was a worthwhile trade to me. You could try a karils helm if you'd like
---
Voting is not a right, it‚Äôs a privilege that can revoked in the event that people are voting no for obviously inane reasons, such as out of spite
---
That's a lot of assuming in one comment lol, have you tried actually making an argument?
---
Please I‚Äôve always wanted to make a mage tank for pvp but everything is lacking especially the armor.
---
You‚Äôll get into a pattern and the boss will become so easy. 30-40 kill trips become standard without flicking. I only take 4 brews now and often never even use them.
---
I think your simple NA brain misunderstood
---
killing a boss with the little mechanics they have, sounds brain dead:) ps, i do 90% of bosses with no prayer, good chance im a better pvmer then you to.
---
perfect timing
---
Is there a specific reason for that? Update wise?
---
This is the problem with rare items being balanced around by pure stats. You can't balance the game based on something as general as DPS or defense of the absolute BIS items. T Bow has escaped this fate because it's high damage relies on magic levels so it's easily balanced by not giving an enemy magic levels. But imagine a boss where Bulwark is BIS for a particular phase due to the insane damage and combos. You either pray flick perfectly, or own a Bulwark, or die. Nothing in the game requires pray flicking, and it's only better to do so. A bulwark being made a near required item for the less fortunate and less skilled would make the boss a huge pain in the ass and it would be hated for its extreme difficulty which can only be stopped by a bulwark. 
---
The better option is to not balance raw stats on certain items, but but make them useful in new ways or situations. Make bulwark as a way to avoid a mechanic and speed up a boss for example. Imagine a boss where it has a wall like Zuk and while it's not as deadly as Zuk it can still easily kill you if you stray for an extended period of time. You follow this wall from A to B to C to D, unable to hit him until you've done something at each point. Instead of slowly following this wall you equip bulwark and rush to the points, taking damage but not dying because it has damage reduction and maybe special properties for this boss specifically. Speeds up the boss but not required to win and doesn't reduce the skill gap as hard as my orognnal example in first paragraph. 
---
That's how I want niche items to be balanced and how I want to slow down power creep. Introducing unique mechanics and ways to mitigate or avoid them entirely. That way we don't need to keep worrying about new BIS power game every major gear update and can instead focus on what use we can give to current and new items that will make them useful even if they are similar in power level to the current BIS.

My dog passed away two months ago. He was 15 years old and we had him for 14 years. I'm happy you found a group of people to give you support and hope that you find peace.
---
That's a pretty big issue. If anything though, I'll make my own thread with a title that will get him attention.
---
Bro you're so fuckin stupid, like how the fuck do you think of some dumb shit like this?
---
Lol Greeny you sound like a sad PvMer complaining
---
Changing my 1 key to Q isn‚Äôt boring and there is no reason it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. Literally any pc game allows for changing of keybinds. With rs being so old it doesn‚Äôt support it aside from f keys. There‚Äôs literally no reason you shouldn‚Äôt be able to play comfortably.
---
ancient staff and rune crossbow are not strong gear
---
I know right I was thinking that too lmao. This one is on hot posts now tho
---
I feel the same way. Slapping "integrity" change on something allows them to do whatever they want and this trend started in 2016.
---
Did you do any pre-log? I feel like that's the obvious question that I haven't seen any ask.
---
medicare not medicaid. medicaid is for poor people medicare is for old people.

Panic buy trimmed armour sets boys
---
lol every big pvper is telling them to do something about the g maul.
---
Matter of fact, go buy yo momma a gf. Go buy yo whole family gfs

I know people complaining about them decreasing the bis shield by less than 10% as if it will destroy their chances of surviving at chins
---
"dead" is the best status ailment to inflict

Wish pking was more about DPS like the old days(when people didn't know how to KO) and less about fast clicks and one/two tick KOs

Have you ever pked, ever in your life?

didnt get enough upvotes sadly.

oh well :)

There is a notice board of sorts right next to the rune/addy dragons that tells you your kc

If you ever reached 9b to begin with, you have no right to talk about being unlucky at the duel arena.
---
Why even post this. Not funny.
---
I mean, I literally directed it at Jagex so Idk what you're on about lmao. "I personally feel" "how THEY should" The bulwark change is one of their many attempts at addressing the "fix pvp" claims. I'm amazed you managed to make that about you!
---
Just a tip going forward, people that don't agree with your side are just as much allowed to have an opinion and understanding of a subject. Your opinion is just that, an opinion. You feeling a certain way doesn't mean everyone else doesn't understand just because they don't agree.
---
I'm willing to agree that it shouldn't be a MASSIVE success rate to tank highly equipped pkers, but should still be fairly viable, but you've placed your own views so high on a pedestal that you're not going to listen to anyone that isn't jumping heavily on your side, so this conversation is pointless.
---
idk I'm not a wildy goer, but I often see torvesta killing ppl with bulwark in his videos, so I'm inclined to believe they *are* killable
---
shh don't tell them you can just bring 28 bones and not give a fuck when you die
---
No.
---
tent is so niche, normal whip is going to be your best friend. zerk + torture. if you want to train strength, dscim is fine, leaf bladed axe is fine, abby dagger is better, bludgeon/rapier is best.
---
I rarely see pkers complain about weapons such as gmaul so it's basically a 1 sided debate where pvmers don't like getting 1 hit while wearing full black dhide so they bitch to ruin all those pure accounts people spent 100's of hours making. Gmauls are super inacurrate as def/gear is updated making is not that good at higher levels. Thanks for fucking pure pvpers once again. Since we're going to have to pay 10m bh points how about the upgrade only works in the wildy and not the rest of the game.
---
some tactics, put on shield pray run.  I guess this is the skill set of a pvmer. lol
---
"This does seem like it could be OP especially with fast hitting bosses, so possibly having a sort of equation for amount of damage, or a 'charge' that it built as you take damage and are still in combat that can then be released." 
---
I noted that, I'm just trying to brainstorm some ideas.
---
&gt; like it was originally.
---
Do you mean originally as in back in the day where you didnt lost any untradeables because you could just pick up your items from the floor after you died or "originally" as it was before eoc where you always lost your untradeables?
---
6 foot, 6 figures, 6 pack
---
To show I'm 3/4 way to 99 duh... it's in the title.
---
No we're talking about dumping anything u feel like into a well
---
they have never stepped into the wildy. they just dont get it
---
So literally the well from rs3? Without a better incentive i dont know how impactful this could be.
---
They aee great laptop dismantlers
---
You finished kraken on 218kc? That's amazing :D
---
Nowadays people would see this and think a mass shooting was about to go down
---
Oh guess that's why all godswords have equal value, oh wait...

You can but very few people actually do, and they could be killed very consistently if they were actually worth killing
---
i.e. callisto takes 11 slots of things that are not food to do efficiently (2 scb, antivenom, stam, hide top/bot, shield, row, bag, tp, claws) so you have 17 slots for brews/rests/anglers, usually 6-8 of those are rests so you have 9-11 brews if you don't bring any anglers
---
most people do not bring 9-11 brews to things like callisto and definitely not to anything in multi
---
I like skilling there too :)
---
Fuck no
---
Then congrats, you‚Äôve jumped in a poll complaining about the nerf when you agree with the nerf, which puts you just at about average redditor status, another case study in why polling is terrible because people often have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about.
---
How big is your spade collection
---
Have you ever sat in singles and tanked until your opponent runs out of runes? The shield is fuckin busted and I look forward to fuckin on some noobs who don't know about the nerf.
---
I respect your oppinion but I reallyyyy want these quest lines to finish :D
---
Nah
---
That's awesome! Thanks
---
It's a good nerf. Shut the fuck up Serene
---
I would set the very attaineable goals of desert treasure, lunar diplomacy and dream mentor, and monkey madness 2. Thats gives you a not horrible yet good chunk of stats for big rewards to grind towards which will continue to help motivate. Screw diaries and that jazz, they are no fun and barely any of them give rewards that youll take advantage of. Then afterwards unlock void and go for elite void(only diary i am in favour of completing) and get into bossing.
---
Uncut sapphire alchs for 15 gp.

holy shit did they look awful

Why doesn't Jagex own them-selves (not a financial/w/e-pro here)
---
literally just commented this on a different post saying the same thing but  
---
I feel the same way. Slapping "integrity" change on something allows  them to do whatever they want and this trend started in 2016.
---
At least tell me why?
---
Since when is ‚Äúgetting good‚Äù equipping the same mindless overpowered armor set, protecting mage, then running toward the ditch while chugging brews? ‚ÄúGetting good‚Äù is anti pking, if anything. Then again, I suppose that anything vaguely resembling a brainwave is of some awe to pvmers, since they are only used to mindlessly clicking on vorkath
---
Link please?
---
Imagine thinking fucking old school RuneScape can compare in any way to a real esport like csgo, dota, LoL, or rocket league. 
---
Like I've never seen more delusion in one place than people who actually think there is a growable market for people who will watch RuneScape tournaments
---
Lmao right? 300k isn't worth jack.
---
No no, there will be a second one in the wilds but it doubles your input score
---
Now it's going to be overpowered in PvP and only cost 3m
---
the nerf does not make it useless. I am sad as an ironman who has one, but tbh this does not kill it by any means. The issue of it being useless is more because there is no place in PvM where it is worth it to just tank and not deal any damage. Maybe if they buffed the melee stats of it or somehow made it a decent weapon when you take damage it could be used.
---
rs3 has a ring that takes onyx to charge,  You can use the ring/onyx to pay instead of the gp if u die with it
---
making me feel better, hovering at ~250 lol
---
Fair enough.
---
It would still be pretty difficult but not impossible. As it stands now, even if they used the mage cape to switch spellbooks so they can tele block and barrage, I am very confident I could tank to the border 99% of the time. With an ely or DFS I would say that goes down to 90% at best.
---
how many women you been with boy?
---
I'd say turtling is a real strat. And spending the coin on bulwark is being prepared in order to not be at a disadvantage.
---
The best way to encourage people to fight back would be to significantly lower the barrier to entry to PvP.
---
Refer to my other post, pkers risk more.
---
You shouldn't need high end gear to simply kill a player with a bulwark and black dragonhide.
---
Turn your herb runs into actual potions and you should outpace it over time.
---
Oh yeah that's definitely when people were more knowledgeable about pking mechanics
---
take a look at its stats read the runescape handbook and you will see the problem...
---
Not fighting back is a disadvantage.
---

Why is this tagged humor. This isn‚Äôt a joke and needs in the game now
---
1st button: stay 50 attack and fight people that risk 1m
---
2nd button: get 60 attack and fight people that risk 22k
---
Anyone complaining about a bulwark nerf has never tried to solo kill someone wearing it and some black dhide
---
&gt;take a look at its stats read the runescape handbook and you will see the problem...
---
You're spot on, I had a suggestion for a ToB reward to be a staff that soaks the damage dealt by heal other to make the healer class viable. The staff could be charged with vials of blood and balanced accordingly. It got a Jmod reply at the time but nothing came of it.
---
Lmao you don‚Äôt need more than a gmaul, bolts and venge to knock some shitter like you out champ.
---
What about Family Crest (and quests that require it) and Curse of the Empty Lord (just to name the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  There's no non-wildy alternatives for finishing those.
---
There is content like Castle Wars, Clan Wars, and Duel Arena that allow you to fight other players who will actually fight back.
---
 take a look at its stats read the runescape handbook and you will see the problem...
---
Haha for sure sounds like lil Willis
---
Been saying this for a while, but someone in upper management is doing a horrible job. Everyone that's getting hired is out of touch, and or doesn't even play the game.
---
I don't want people who are getting hired to use it as a stepping stone to future progress knowing the pay won't get much better. I want some nerd who only plays this game who is fine with the pay and they love the job.
---
Who ever had been in charge of hiring doesn't seem to understand the game what so ever, and has an entirely different check box list they are trying to meet. And they're weird corporate check boxes too, so the expectations and skills needed don't translate well.
---
What you're seeing is what happens to all good things. They try to take on corporate power structures and hiring changes that do nothing to help the end product, but instead give the illusion that the share holders and management care about their employees. 
---
Anything that gets enough money attracts the flies to the system and creates bloat. Money is being distributed to seniors who carved out their own spot with management and try to sell shareholders on schemes that make them look like they are being productive according to their skill set.
---
Stupid af
---
Oh dear god those scims....
---
Right bc the dude in a bulwark is the only person in the wild.
---
But bro, he straight
---
where is the grand exchange in the middle of the ocean?
---
It's to see if you have a bank pin and if you are actively playing the account.
---
I'd secure your email address and make sure 2fa is enabled on there and on the account you're playing on.
---
A better option would be to give top-tier mage gear bulwark-specific buff. This would Encourage pkers to use top-tier mage year against top-tier defense gear.
---
99% of pkers rag in mystics/dhide and still expect to stack on what is the highest-tier defensive gear in the game.
---
Or wear Din's bulwark so they can't kill you...
---
So what you're saying is, because RS3 happened or loss of free trade/wildy (around that timeframe) Jagex had to sell off shares because of loss of revenue?
---
Probably a pker
---
That feeling doesn‚Äôt come from being more developed it comes from gaining a new perspective on what happened. That happens constantly in life as you grow up, gain experiences, mature, and change.
---
If 40 years from now you think the decisions you made as a 20 year old were good, you haven‚Äôt grown as a person.
---
4m is absolutely ridiculous
---
This isn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion lol.
---
Anyways, Plenty of games that have pvp and pve have different mechanics. It‚Äôs to avoid completely changing the meta of one side because it‚Äôs an issue in the other. Blowpipe speed, bulwark def option, spec teleing, restore pool, and pid swap are just a few examples of this.
---
The footnote (Mods &lt;all mod names&gt;) is just automatically added at the end of a post, not typed out or pasted. Someone hasn't edited the file that is automatically added since MMK left.
---
What are you even arguing? The parent comment more or less stated that pkers do it for profit, otherwise why would anyone do it? I said 'fun' while taking a slight jab at pkers. And now you are here telling me they aren't there for fun, but to be the 'risk' in 'risky content'?
---
I tried sniffing both 2ci and 2ce (not at the same time, on different occasions) and they were both the worst experiences of my life and totally put me off hallucinogenics. It was like 0-100 in a few minutes. Also made me think hard about the risks of taking things you have no idea about so I never did RCs again.
---
Gmauls gunna be like 4m
---
You weren‚Äôt accounting for their possible loot though, just equipment. No one just runs around with bulwark in wild for the hell of it unless they‚Äôre really bored. But obviously that‚Äôs hard to account for but if you want the big kill gotta go big. Most go in groups anyways so it‚Äôs not even risking really
---
Dude how inconsiderate you haven't seen my deep web post of my 1x1 tile city off lumbridge swamps smh
---
Also Jagex: let's make the gmaul a 75% gold sink. That should balance things.
---
I also remember the decline of RS2.
---
In the past, in a situation where a pker was hunting somebody down in the wilderness, the more skilled player often prevailed, whether it was the killer or the escapee. This is because PvP had a good balance and both players have opportunities to outplay the other. My problem with the bulwark is that it completely breaks this balance. As a pker I can take every action available to me to maximize my chance of success and just fail almost every single time against this shield. I've killed plenty of people with bulwarks, but the success rate is so so low compared to basically everything else. Bulwark is more of a determining factor for escaping a pker than player skill is at this point, which is just sad, so I'm glad they are nerfing it and I think that it needs more than -10 off its stats to be meaningful.
---
Justi in wildy is bad though. It has shitty mag def. Dhide and bulwark is max def gear for pvp.
---
if you're risking 300m to kill someone with a bulwark maybe consider picking a target who does not have the money to pay for a bulwark
---
do you smell the hypocrisy? you want people who may be farming gold to have their defense nerfed so you can make money off them more easily, and then get upset that you also have to risk money
---
That‚Äôs not the point. Everyone is upset that it will barely have any use now. If that affects iron men and their game content then it still has a negative impact on the player base
---
This place can be sort of an angry mob about anything that they perceive as tilting the balance from PVMers to PVPers, even if it is completely reasonable. Sorry, but I shouldn't be able to laugh at someone in decent gear barraging me while I slowly pick up my traps before running. Hell, just within the past week, I've had multiple people splash a few times and then switch to range and hit a few 0's before simply getting off me and hopping. I shouldn't be able to do that while only risking 400k (only reason that isn't 200k is because I enjoy the fashionscape of barrows gloves and prayer cape).
---
Yeah, 2C's are notoriously bad for your nose. I tried it with 2CB once never again.

Sure, if that PKer was a total trash can. Although, the places where Dinhs is most useful (chaos altar, dark crabs( are exclusive to total trash can pkers so I guess you‚Äôre right ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Those are miniquests. They give you nothing.
---
True. If that's such an issue though, why not mage them?
---
A d scim alone is like 60k. You‚Äôre really dogshit bro. Save your snakeskin caps brother.
---
no one equips glory to pvm in 2019
---
cutting items for more survivability is possibly but obviously less efficient
---
10 brews is not enough to survive if you get hit by a real clan if all you have is a bulwark and hides
---
if you balance for solo pkers then you are gauranteed to die every time an actually powerful clan appears, you cannot balance for solo  pking in the current state of the game - fix that problem before nerfing a pretty much useless tank shield
---
Because a nerf to a shield that is op would be better for pkers and attract more folks to pk, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll ever learn to pk but that‚Äôs mainly cause I‚Äôm too lazy.
---
I‚Äôm having a osrs problem I want to play but I log in and don‚Äôt feel like it ughh what‚Äôs wrong with me I love this game
---
thats the point
---
If everyone who up-votes this post would part with a measly $450,000 or so, we can buy Jagex and make OSRS free! Don't expect your money back, let alone a return on investment, because that would be capitalist greed.
---
This. I cant stand con. 
---
I'll take RC any day it. 
---
Same goes with thieving, but at least you can make some money with it.
---
yeah and tanking with dinhs to wildy border, even if successful, is more of a waste of your time than just dying &amp; resetting
---
I spent quite a while at black chins &amp; I often went hours without pking and the few pkers that showed up were often solo pkers, which meant you could either run past them without having to worry about anything or you tp at 30. Pairs usually failed to kill budget gear too, only thing you had to look out for were people like monni who'd come at you in max with a bunch of his buttbudies to help catch freezes or distract monsters, at that point you're just going to save a lot of time simply dying &amp; regearing rather than waiting out your tb
---
If you imp box every few hundred, you barely risk any chins so you might as well just give them up
---
&gt; The nature of the activity
---
Back to my original point that having pve and pvm in a pvp zone is the inherent issue with the wilderness. I agree that there should be risk in the wilderness, but when the most rewarding thing in the pvp area is not pvp related, people are always going to minimize the risk of getting pked as much as possible so they can do the more beneficial content. 
---
For example, now instead of using d-hides and bulwark at the wilderness alter with 200 bones, I'm just going do the suicide method. Now pkers have a greater chance of killing me but they're going to get 26 bones at most.
---
I like a balance too, by block list is Hellhounds (im pre 91 slayer), Wryms, Drakes, Greater Demons, Black Demons and Suqahs.  I had fire giants blocked before I had unlocked Drakes.  I know some people like Suqahs but I consider them really expensive and not that great (maybe at max gear/max stats they are better i dont know)

---
Wasn't around for this time, was the screenshot tabs user submitted?
---
I actually prefer targetting the players with dinhs because even though they're harder to kill, they usually risk more, both loot &amp; gear, because they assume they're unkillable
---
I'd rather have a 50% chance to kill someone risking half a mill than 90% chance to kill someone risking 200k
---
Well, if I use say medium gear, I risk around 800k in a multi combat zone and that's while keeping my +1. It takes quite a while for someone PvMing to acquire that amount of loot ( yes there is also RNG involved ).
---
That is easily possible, looking at the writing style and the occasional swedish
---
Debatably because of the high barriers to entry. That bracket is stacked with some of the most active BH‚Äôers in the game. To compete you need to be able to compete with the best in the game. This update will only make those barriers higher.

I read this as " how do i move my mouse to another location"

I LOVE the new spell idea to go with that type of boss.
---
Pkers go to wild because it‚Äôs the only place they can kill other players. Pvm risk going to wild knowing they can die because some of the rewards of wild are so op they feel it‚Äôs worth it, like monsters and clues, not to mention places like the altar. The risk in risky content are pkers, if there were no pkers in wild the risk attributed to the content would be on par with the same risk associated with content in the non-wild areas of the world.

Right.
---
So let's nerf the only item that sort of fucks with PKers while Jigglyflex forces you to go to wildy for a clue, making PKing nonPKers easier.
---
Or fucking with Chin PKers while Jigglyflex forces you to go to wildy for the best chins in the game, making PKing nonPKers easier.
---
Nice "risk vs. reward"
---
Nice "wildy rejuvination"
---
Nice "logic"
---
The is totally OK.
---
Why the fuck is the chaos altar a thing, honestly. It's pretty much the antithesis of the wilderness. It's one of the best ways to train prayer, but to do so you must expose yourself in multi while you're full of bones. It basically begs the player to do a suicide method, since it's a faster way to bank AND makes you risk less.
---
If you had to keep control of an area (king of the hill style) to use the bones or some other mechanic like it, I'd understand it being in the wilderness since it pushes people to fight each other. But as it is, the whole point of the altar is to offer pkers a chance to kill people who absolutely don't want to fight back. It's pretty dumb.
---
\&gt;complain about pking dying
---
Jmods: ‚ÄúWell lets make some adjustments so it‚Äôs more friendly to newcomers‚Äù
---
Pkers: REEEEE FUCKING FAGMODS REEEEE EAT DICK GTFO NORMIES REEEEEEEE WE PAY WE GAY REEEEEEEE
---
What could possibly be wrong.
---
&gt;Why nerf the Bulwark and make it completely useless?
---
Because the state of wildy pking at this point is to kill people who are guaranteed to not fight back, and Bulwark was the only budget way of surviving especially against groups. If anything annoys pkers the most, it's not getting their free kill.
---
you aren't supposed to risk a lot if you are unskulled
---
to attack people you have to take on extra risk that's the entire point
---
Plus gives you a 1/1000 chance of pet for every 1m thrown in
---

---
What am I meant to be looking at
---
there's no way he's a genuine pure or a frequent pvper if he's risking 300k every time he tries to pk. part of the fun of pking on a second pure account is that funding the character is cheap as hell. money easily made in less than an hour
---
Not really. The 2008 HD era is what people are usually wanting, like myself. I don't like the  post 2009 era because of the weapon and armor updates.
---
Not really, pretty much always profit with burst and would still typically profit with barrage (especially when using Staff of Light or Kodai).
---
Wrong
---
this will actually cause massive inflation of valuable items, and will make things worse
---
Just wear high heels you'll be fine.
---
It's risk/reward but not in a good way.
---
The risk is hoping a team won't log in. The reward is good xp/gp if they don't. There's literally nothing you can do except tank a team if you want to live. There is no way one person can kill a multi team. Only survive. 
---
Wilderness content should be risk/reward based in a way that you can effectively combat the risks using PvP. You currently can't.
---
Fun fact, this is legal in more states than you‚Äôd expect.
---
Still don‚Äôt do this, it‚Äôs dangerous, and it puts a lot more lives at risk than just your own.
---
If we're talking annoying clue steps, I'd prefer the plethora of kharazi jungle ones be looked at. Even with 79 agility it's a massive pain in the ass to get to, I'd kill for an option to teleport there after the quest, maybe new scrolls from clues or have a way to charge the bull roarer to tele there.

Imagine if we had some Jagex mods that actually did pvp... And no, Archie pking 7 years ago doesn't count
---
The issue is not that people are defending themselves, it's that people have the ability to defend themselves to a level that far exceeds the risk they take on by using those items. Black dhide and dinhs by themselves is literally 0 risk and can easily tank way more than salad robes and water staves like this sub keeps parroting. Even in barrows and a staff of the dead/armadyl crossbow and BIS or near BIS in the other slots can't do anything to bulwark and dhides. Add in other good defensive items like a serp helm, glory/defense amulet, guardian boots, etc and you're still only risking dhides and an amulet and you're literally untouchable.

Well it's been a thing for a while in Runelite so even if the change wasn't made to the vanilla client people still had the orb
---
I mean no one thinks to themself "Ok I'm a pker and want to pk and hopefully profit. I know, I'll go kill abyss/clues!"
---
Yes, if someone is in the wild and see a naked player, obviously they will go and kill the person for the off chance they have bank. But no one is going out expecting to pk one of these players for bank.
---
That's far too rational. It's doomed to die to all the people who grinded 100 kills to get a head, before getting access to the shortcut
---
Question semi related to this. Why is it that when the Venezuelan blackout happened the amount of D bones bought decrease. I understand the amount sold would drop because of supply but the amount bought also halved. Just simple supply and demand? Or are these gold farms also trying to flip?
---
It is about pvp as a whole because this is again one of Jagex's attempts at fixing pvp lmao. Just keep throwing in pvm content and making non pkers weaker, the Jagex way of fixing pvp.
---
Again, you're acting like issues with attacking people who are not interested in fighting is an ACTUAL PROBLEM. Rather than the real problem being the fact that they've set up pvp areas to function like this. Without that core issue, this 'actual problem' you refer to wouldn't even exist.
---
Honestly, I picked up on the fact that you're too dense to follow any conflicting views so many comments ago, and I have no idea why I let myself get baited into continuing lmao. 
---
Have a good day.
---
People keep asking and they keep saying "Maybe after song of the elves".
---
It's not really an inconvenience if they're doing it specifically to spite you, lol. They're there for fun, if they wanted to be doing something else they wouldn't be screwing with splashers.
---
Why the fuck are you wearing a skills neck btw haha
---
If your a white dot your a thot brother
---
Sire is decent-ish xp and 2m/hr is nothing to scoff at. Scythe is approximately 10-15% better than the other methods at Sire, meaning an extra 2-3 kills per hour, in exchange for 70% of your profit. Absolutely not worth.
---
U have to balance around everything i meant. Having 1v1 be broke and teams being mildly inconvenienced is not fine. There wasnt bulwark before 2016 and people managed to tank. But now they always do, zero chance of death if u have a couple brain cells.
---
But you still "lost" because you had to leave. There are too many variables at play to consider either a "winner" or "loser". It's just an awkward and seemingly pointless PvP encounter, which arguably is the main issue with the wilderness.
---
Don't be so black and white.
---
I can empathize with where you're coming from as someone who doesn't often pk, but gets pk'd. I don't understand how bots are making fighting back a horrible decision, though.
---
In my opinion, "fixing" the wilderness is a much more complicated problem than many on this sub wish to believe. I don't agree with them nerfing Dihn's, or even really the Gmaul. I do think pkers are obnoxious in that they kill people who are obviously just clueing or holding nothing. HOWEVER, it's worth noting how many times people get pked that look innocent, who actually have huge risk.
---
The wilderness is a place where you risk what you bring (for the most part). If you don't like it, you don't have to go.
---
slayer already good, make slayer gooder
---

---
47 CAD wtf? Aren't mousemats like 5 bucks? Is this cause we voted no on MTX?
---
you've completely missed my point so let me repeat it for you
---
&gt; why should pvp be any different?
---
and well done on taking a bunch of examples and listing them the way they obviously shouldn't be changes
---
+1 for the repair idea, that sounds really fucking good actually.
---
imagine creating a shield for high level pvm but not creating a mechanic that demands a shield \*pikachu face\*
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that, my point is that the salad robe pker with a +1 is risking the same if not more than the bulwark user. The person I originally replied to is saying that the pker is risking less.
---
It's literally - 10 in the defence stats they aren't halving them no ones gonna be speccing 73s through bulwarks constantly now
---
Yeah I splash when I'm at work or busy with other tasks. Why wouldn't you? You're missing out on xp gains. I don't get why it's so bothersome for some of yall.
---
Hard to say. I'm assuming a head of esports would do neither and is rather more incharge of networking with the people that do.
---
Regardless you need to know the ins and outs to be effective at your job. This is not something where a college degree in whatever is going to help. You gotta play it like a sweaty nerd.
---
And as of recently jagex had pretty much exclusively hired people who don't play osrs, or RuneScape at all recently. The team is split up more and the management positions are micro managing the game to the point where it's impacting quality of updates we are recieving with some how less bug testing, or just otherwise incompetence.
---
"Maybe people will like the wilderness more if we make it take 20 seconds to kill them where they stand instead of 30!"
---
Jagex should just stop touching wilderness. Making it easier for predators isn't going to lure in more prey.
---
more clunky "me dumb troll" dialect?
---
so american english then?
---
WILDY REJUVENATION
---
The whole reason they added the un-noter NPC was so that people could bring noted bones, allowing them to have an inventory of food/pk supplies and leave a bit of space to have open inventory slots to train prayer as well. It's not jagex's fault that players are cheap and afraid of the wilderness lol.
---
I recently trained to 77 prayer on my med and did that exact method and anti-pked 3 people along the way. Was it the fastest way to train prayer? No. But was I prepared to fight back accordingly while also using the altar for its intended use of saving money on bones, yup.
---
All that matters in this game is DPS lol
---
doubling down on ignoring the latter, more prominent point is even classic...er? reddit.
---
Nah it just doesn't foam like beer so there isn't as much of a mess. Little underwhelming but it happens
---
That's great introspection. I'm proud of you.
---
How will you compete against the guys who are trimming for free?
---
I do remember the spell filtering fiasco, still get annoyed at those results every now again when I try to filter only teles for clues or something.
---
With that kind of attitude I don't understand how *any* quality of life changes make it through without 'devaluing' someones whatever
---
One of the final fantasy games had a system for people grinding on low level rabbits. After about a hundred or so a way higher level super rabbit would spawn in to fuck up who ever was camping the rabbits.

Whether or not nerfing the G-mail is killing the most popular bracket. Are you not going to recognize how fucking busted that weapon is in the first place?

I just watched this video yesterday. Before it I might have called this proposal harmless/good but after it I greatly dislike it. Hand holding is not good for a game like osrs

I know I‚Äôm offended...

I got the old school Tim &amp; Crunchie and love it, had it for over a 6 months now and i use it at work. Fits mouse + keyboard
---
&gt;Jagex poll removing a green pixel from an icon
---
Actually insane that this was a thing.
---
Confirmation bias is a beautiful thing
---
Who do you think are the people carrying a bulwark with them? Do you think they're risking anything? 
---
If they do risk bank, then bringing a bulwark with them reduces the number of safe items they have. If they don't risk anything though, what's the point in killing them? Taking their spade?
---
Some people use bots to scout the wilderness, which is what I meant. And I get that the wilderness is supposed to be a dangerous place, and I don't think PvP should be eliminated. But Jagex keeps removing fair ways to fight against PKers without engaging in PvP which is not the solution to reinvigorating the wilderness.
---
good advice, not having a goal of progression can be extremely demotivating, thats why i try to set daily goals for myself like gain x amount of xp in y skill
---
Farming and bird houses
---
OSRS also had this early on, for a short period of time.
---
I like that idea, thanks
---
Make the spec remove all CC.
---
Currently the meta for a lot of people doing pvm in the wilderness is to have attack options on hidden to avoid skull tricking.
---
If you attack back you have to constantly right click to check that the opponent has the same name and hasn't had someone login under him trying to skulltrick you.
---
Could it be possible to have a player 'attack' option where attacking back without getting a skull would be left click but attacking a new opponent (giving you skull) would be right click?
---
I feel like this kind of update would be welcomed by both pkers and pvmers. Pvmers would be encouraged more to fight back, while pkers would get an opponent that actually fights back.
---
Yes because instead of complaining about problems (broken game mechanics) you should just roll over and do nothing, I bet you'd let Hitler take over the world because you couldn't be arsed to bitch and moan.
---
They are crop-dependent. You can infer them from https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Template/Farming/Herbs?action=raw

You seem to be confused
---
Unpolled nerf  =bullshit
---
K thanks bye
---
Good job with the firecape.
---
I‚Äôm almost 99% of situations if I‚Äôm in the wilderness doing revs black chins etc, my gear set up and inventory has me at a disadvantage already against a pker. There is no viable way to fight back against pkers if you are in the wildy with the purpose of doing anything besides pking.
---
hell yeah brother
---
The price doesn't really matter, and it wouldn't ever go past a certain point anyways because people would just farm it too much. It's just that being able to buy +5 max hits to Cannon would be overpowered whereas currently it's meant to be a reason for efficient players to want to do the boss, if they want to stock on dust for EHP hours or wildy slayer/bossing.
---
pvm is put in the wilderness to attract people to area to make it more popular as a whole. People get better rewards, with the risk of being pk'd and this shield negates the risk extremely. No one, including jagex, is thinking this suggestion is going to do A N Y T H I N G except restore balance to the 'risk v reward' mentality that wilderness pvm has.   
---
the ONLY person too dense to follow this SIMPLE LOGIC is you, and you alone.   
---
this is coming with multiple pvp updates, and is not designed to fix anything but T H I S problem.

So getting PvMers and Skillers into the wilderness for PvM and Skiller content is good.
---
Getting PvPers into PvM for PvP content is bad?
---
Seriously. They're pouring water into a bucket filled with holes, since that's less controversial than patching the holes.
---
Stupidest idea I've heard
---
Yeah so now god sword risk fights in no arms is kinda pointless (besides ags obviously) and you have to risk an extra 4m just to use it?? Not to mention a lot of pkers when they first try pking do msb - gmaul, so now that's dead because I died about 30 times til I got my first stack. So now when I go deep wildy on my main if I don't have this 4m cash sink thats always lost on death, sitting 115 hp is near impossible to get a kill on without the AGS gmaul combo. PLUS can't wait to get teamed for having a guaranteed 1m+ risk not including the mystic set
---
Like 4m? What the fuck lmfao atleast make it worth 500k and 250k on death.
---
You think this is bad. You guys should see some of Paul Gower‚Äòs work on later RSC quests.
---
&gt; Why wouldn't you?
---
Some of us like to actually play the game?
---
So I have been insanely lucky with zenytes (3 in 450 kc) but I DC'd right as I got the third one and someone else snagged it so it balances out.
---
&gt;skull tricked
---
Forget how to read?
---
I don't understand how splashing warrants spite, I guess. It's not like it ruins the economy or really has any negative effects on the game. Some people just have other things to do but still want to train a skill so they can actually enjoy the game when they have time to play.
---
They can always change a bit of code to roll for loot when you dig for the casket, the show the specific type of casket based on the loot it rolled. Just like in CoX.

not a btw but I also have not received a single white lily seed from hespori at \~50kc. 2 buckets though.
---
Even fighting back, if you're not completely familiar with every skull trick, you're going to fall for something eventually. Because you don't just read a book to learn about them. You fall for them one by one and eventually you know all the tricks. Lemme right click and memorize the guy whos attacking me's name and 'fight back' while making sure I dont accidentally click on 'IlIIIlIIIlllI' instead of 'llIIIlIIIlllI' :D
---
Now *that* is gay
---
this episode is fucking legendary
---
a huge part of why solo pking is bad is because teams are strong, no one wants to 1v1 pk and then get jumped by a clan
---
nerfing bulwark doesn't address actual core issues of the problem and is pointless, if someone really wants you dead the bulwark is not going to keep you alive it mostly just protects you from getting harrassed by weak pkers
---
But why tf can people stack 120 to begin with, it's the only weapon you can do it with. Maybe dragon throwing axes but but not nearly as well as gmaul
---
why does it matter how many people die to gmauls if the players don't want it changed?
---
The blowpipe is overpowered in PvM.
---
Nobody asked
---
I personally agree. I figure if you're going to put in the stats and gp for a bulwark and black d'hide just to have an essentially defensive-pacifist item, then so be it.
---
If you're going to put PvM content in the wildy, then you're going to have to expect that there are players that want to do that content without risking time/resources to pkers.
---
Well, I did. That's what I'm getting at. Yes there's lots of elite rewards but if they were all super-strong and fitting of being an elite reward, I wouldn't call for them to be moved into lower tiers.
---
Without question, most of those 'elite' rewards suck. Whole diary needs be looked at imo. The amount of tasks in Easy/Med/Hard is relatively high and the lamps give the wrong xp (because the Karamja diary was made first and doesn't conform to the usual rules).
---
Do you pk?
---
Arma
---
"I suffered from shitty game design so you should too!"
---
Yes it is? look up the law you're only allowed hands free with some expectations.
---
No I meant the 100k was nearly half my bank at the time lol. 
---
I was exaggerating but it was about half my cash stack, my bank was only about 10m tho
---
Report it to the cyber police
---
I know people around here don‚Äôt like warding but this is why it would be good for the game, similar to how invention works for rs3.
---
Break down items to get other items in an irreversible process in order to make something new that requires upkeep whether it be coins or more of the broken down item, ideally.
---
Otherwise you‚Äôll soon see godswords at alch price. The only reason whips in osrs are still worth a pretty penny is because tentacle whips consume them.
---
I still think lumby basement should be multi way combat
---
yea its fine, wish the game could advance without the constant whine of power creep though, game is old now that all i have going for me is pet hunting and getting all my skills to 200m exp.
---
The logic is "don't go in the wilderness ***if you don't want to get pked***. It's not a zone exclusively for pvp, that's why there's Skilling and pvm in the wilderness
---
Thanks for sharing OP this was interesting
---
Neither the original comment or I was defending Dihns. He was saying that the nerf is just a short term 'fix' for an bigger overall problem.
---
Delay means nothing, you're dumb as hell. No company uses a delay including Google, you spouting delay just because idiots on Reddit say it all the time shows how fucking retarded you are. If all your private info is leaked than it's your fault and you can't stop them from getting into your account. Jagex should allow us to change it, but you fucked yourself dumb ass.
---
Isn‚Äôt this more of aa item sink, than a gp sink?
---
Its in single u dolt. 
---
Lmao. 
---
Pk solo, cant kill dinhers. Shit pker
---
Pk with 30 to kill dinhers. Shit pker
---
U cant win. Fuck off and reflect on yourself
---
In PA it‚Äôs completely legal to talk on the phone while driving doesn‚Äôt even have to be hands free
---
I did it in a pvp world and just used the MA2 symbol to suicide quickly. In pvp worlds you spawn literally next to a bank so just teleport back with ghorrock teleport and run south.
---
550k prayer xp/h and barely lose bones when pked since you can 1-tick them with the menu entry swapper plug-in on runelite.
---
Poll the bulwark nerf
---
thank you :D
---
Shouldn't be, but I feel like 50% of the people I see are wearing that gear and are the one's complaining it's hard to get kills.
---
He was actually streaming a bit not long ago. Basically his job takes up a lot of his free time and he doesn‚Äôt have the desire to be a full time content creator
---
Am I the only one super excited about the F2P changes lately? Entangle might be a bit much but now I kind of want to make a F2Per.
---
Directly copying imo
---
Fuck it why not
---
Might as well ask yourself why even have pvp enabled if you should never attack anyone.
---
Does Jagex just call anything they don't feel like polling because they know it will not pass "integrity changes"?
---
Not if you're afk. Smithing darts for 5 hours is better than smithing gold bars for 1
---
Lol a message should pop up when. Someone donates too so you can have beggers follow you for gp then show them you throwing like a mil in the well just as the ultimate fuck you
---
The entire point of the skills and pvm in the wild is to get  players in the wild so players can kill them. The fuck?
---
I don't understand why Jamflex would ever remove this? The economy benefits from a gold release valve and the company gets good PR year round
---
That's just an opinion. I love it, it's one of the only things I've been doing on rs for the last few days and the cw worlds are always busy there
---
Both of those are bad, jag just didn't realize the first one till after it was implemented
---
Yeah, good.  Currently your at rue drags and you die.  Then what?  You spend 2 mins running back and face absolutely no consequences?
---
Well I added through multi so the ‚Äúpk solo can‚Äôt kill dinhers‚Äù is a point I never made. So I guess I do win
---
Why do you care? Fucking dweebs
---
Hes not botting, he is the robot
---
I‚Äôd personally just bomb some speed. You can get in such a zone with that stuff...
---
What bones did ya use for 850k xp/h? I did suicide method in pvp world (spawn next to a bank) and ghorrock teleport back. With dragon bones I gained up to 550k xp/h.
---
Is this a wind up?
---
I‚Äôm gonna give ya a hard no... just because you can‚Äôt imagine playing two accounts simultaneously while reading and responding to comments doesn‚Äôt mean that jase cannnot either.
---
no the content is added with hopes of feeding pkers kills.  The food chain doesnt exist anymore because back in the day solo pkers would fight each other, people would die and form teams, teams would then fight each other and form clans and shit would repeat.  Now solo pkers run from each other and only attack pvmers, teams just sit at revs and once again run from each other, and all clans are dead so there is that.  what a joke, let it all die.
---
My original reply was to you saying it takes 30 minutes, not to the OP.
---
Wht I said implies that not everyone has the Blowpipe, either because they haven't received it as a drop or they cannot afford it, which makes the caves take lot longer than just 30 minutes.
---
I never said it isn't worth it nor that it is super difficult for me, just pointed out that saying it only takes 30 minutes is highly subjective and not at all true in many cases.
---
So tell again me how I missed the context of the discussion, when the only part I replied to is the part where you talked about the time it takes to complete the caves?
---
The condescension is not necessary, I get that you think you are the authority here. 
---
If you are having trouble killing people with Dinh's even in your maxed gear, maybe go fight someone else. If every 10th person you come across has a bulwark and gets away, is that not reasonable? Don't be frustrated over the handful of people who actually might escape you in max gear, go kill everyone else. If people are bringing a bulwark it's because they want to be left alone and planned to escape and survive. No reason to be upset when they occasionally do just that.
---
Stake me. Bring ur ahrims, sotd, and occult. U wont kill me if i use dinhs. I will stake u until ur satisfied or broke.
---
&gt;After adding Tele block to F2P, the appetite to try out F2P PKing was apparent but lacked some key components such as preventing players from moving for longer durations. As a result, we plan to add Snare and Entangle to F2P to facilitate more effective F2P PKing.
---
Most people aren't gonna know about this but this is pretty fucking detrimental for f2p multi/clan wars, I guess it's basically dead anyway so there won't be any outcry over it, but if you have any idea how large scale f2p multi works at all this is a terrible idea.
---
In Illinois even having your phone in your hand now is a ticket
---
100? If only I were so lucky! I think I got my first head at 275ish. Not that that getting the head changed anything for me, being a self imposed 77 prayer account..
---
and the maxed gear?
---
hmmm, that is a hard one to fix. I guess you can't really fix the fact that there will always be some advantage to having a team.
---
If no one is in the wilderness then clue hunters and wild boss slayers are fine and I don't understand the complaint.
---
Think it will work?
---
Why not try to actually pvp, against other pkers, rather than attack people who will never fight back.
---
You underesrimate most pkers risk my friend
---
Ah yes. He plays 2 accounts perfectly. The one account never moves the entire clip you posted?
---
Isn't that being changed too though?

---
That comment is still on this thread you absolute spastic
---
OSRS is one of the only MMOs that actually balances PvP and PvM seperately and it should stay that way.  
---
That is so not true. Nearly every MMO I have ever played has had damage, duration, and effect differences between PvP and PvE abilities.
---
More likely the granite maul. Nobody cares about the bulwark
---
That's 99 fishing.... das huge!
---
Same here! Also 31. I‚Äôll play til the day I die too. Might take a few breaks though haha.
---
because they dont want to risk jack shit and just want to kill people who dont want to fight back.  Pkers in 2019 are nothing more then a bunch of power creep whining troglodytes.
---
including east lumby goblins and the cow+chicken pens.
---
Wait. You are adding an item for BH points... that always drops on death... and instead of dropping the item, it drops 1mil coins...?

because he just finished runecrafting and was using that as an essence runner, if you watch before that he running both accounts perfectly while doing everything else I said and who knows how many other accounts off screen
---
I don‚Äôt mind the change, my issue with gmaul is its power isn‚Äôt proportional to its cost. This way the weapon can still be used, but people will be forced to risk a bit more.
---
It's not great lmao
---
Can you run one with mystic top/bottom, nezzy, ma2 cape, ancient staff, no boots, no shield and seer‚Äôs ring and b gloves? And then same setup with a charged tsotd. 99 mage for both, with augury on, no boost from imbued heart or mage potion.
---
Imagine believing they actually risk that. Do you understand how the skulling mechanic works?
---
yea i was using the amulet too but with an alt you literally never have to leave unless you get killed.  Basically my down time of gaining exp was like 5 seconds max.
---
Maybe they should nerf Black Dhide instead
---
serp helm, ahrims, tsotd, eternals, barrows gloves with kharil top/verac skirt switch, tentacle whip, ddef, ags, and arma cbow
---
Firstly, nobody planning to kill anybody with a bulwark should be using entangle. Secondly, I never suggested to nerf brews; I just suggested not to nerf bulwark. I was merely trying to explain how items designed for tanking such as sara brews are also very strong/overpowered, and that a nerf to bulwark is nothing but a scapegoat if the intention is to balance tanking.
---
Let me give you a hypothetical:
---
Setup 1: Take the bulwark away, and provide no replacement, but the player gets 15 brews and 6 restores.
---
Setup 2: Player gets to use the bulwark, but has 18 anglerfish and 3 restores.
---
A reincarnated Manked in max gear just got on you with a 5 minute TB to tank. Which set-up would you choose?
---
You're realllll worked up about this arent you??
---
Gotta go white knight because GIRRL RS

The point is there is not supposed to be any risk of getting skulled from attacking the person who is attacking you. They attacked you. You fight back without the risk of being skulled, that's how it's supposed to be.
---
No, people cry DDOS, to actually ddos someone you need one hell of a powerful pc. 
---
The real issue was jagexs shit servers.
---
"No your stupid"
---
The irony.

What if they added an account total kill count? The more people you killed the more you would be worth on a death, and it doesn‚Äôt reset so killing yourself with alts wouldn‚Äôt fix it. Maybe a weekly chest you can open based on your kill count, but if you kill someone with zero points you don‚Äôt get shit. So pvmer‚Äôs would be safe, and it would lead to wanting to actually kill pkers because they‚Äôre worth more
---
Dude I started commenting on these posts in the last few hours saying roughly the same manner of thinking on the nerf on bulwark and getting downvoted to oblivion. Just because I defended it and in turn defend the wild I got accused of being a pker.
---
Hi, funny post but please everyone, don't actually do this.
---
Xp gains aren't worth risking lives over
---
What is that like 1 raids worth of gp?
---
See, on the one hand, you have awesome luck, but on the other hand, you can't do Zulrah anymore.
---
Thats called a sink
---
Yeah Apache right??
---
I believe ive gotten more but as its not a official zulrah drop i just sold them as i got them, but i got lazy
---
Interesting. I didn't realise 94 magic for ice barrage, Tent whips and heavy ballista were level 40 gear. Outrage narrative at its finest.
---
I agree with that you should have risk in attacking someone whose attacking you. You should still have the risk of attacking the wrong person though.
---
I'm 90% sure you're talking about lootshare, which, was in the game LOOOOONG before IM mode came out
---
And wait are you saying I could actually dou bandos as an IM?
---
S
---
Yeah they should need 20m worth of gear so that there's actually an incentive to fight back. Why call it PVP when one guy is beating on a guy that doesn't want to fight back at all.
---
Dihn's bulwark is the fucking defensive weapon we need for the wildy. Before Dihn's defense was borderline useless in pvp and the 1def pure meta that's been around since before 2007 is proof of that. Dihn's is the counter to no risk pkers that bring welfare gear and then an AGS as their +1 protected item. If an attacker can bring in an item that adds no risk to them while also giving them ridiculous KO potential why shouldn't there be a weapon that gives ridiculous defensive potential to balance it? 
---
https://youtu.be/baNEorddRmE
---
At around the 9 minute mark someone wearing Dihn's bulwark gets destroyed by two people using rune cbow and dragon scimmy in a few seconds. Definitely don't need 200m+ worth of gear to kill someone with Dihn's.
---
It doesn't stack 100, it does when used with a 13m godsword or I guess 60m+ Dclaws 
---
Oh and Anchor or 13m Eldermaul
---
It's used with a lot of accounts. It's not always just 50atk gmaulers this is gonna hurt
---
more like 3 or 4 lol
---
No gonna read that novel you wrote, but if you are seriously addicted and can't fix it yourself, just go to the GE and spam your password and then logout. I'm sure someone else will happily take your account off of your hands.
---
Jagex isn't going to just ban your account because you asked.
---
I don‚Äôt pk, never have and never will. Mainly cause I‚Äôm too lazy to learn how to pk and anti-pk.
---
The way to use it is to switch between it and a godsword. Hit with godsword, then immediately change to bulwark, tank a hit and change back to godsword. Still very niche, but works great at General Graardor for example.
---
Can we add possible changes to the Blowpipe and Twisted Bow to the "to be discussed changes" outlines in the news-post. These items are far too good for the current game state and are too often the go to weapon.
---
Some community discussion on how to change the weapons to help them fall more in line with other weapons of the same tier would be a great first step to reigning them in.
---
Melee doesn't matter on zulrah, only range and mage.
---
But yeah can definitely do it with those stats. Would recommend having at least a trident and blow pipe to start it off as well.
---
The bugs were the best part
---
Nice personal attack, very constructive!
---
That advantage ends around level 75 combat. Pures get dominated by any account with 40+ defense. At level 70ish, accounts can have enough of an offense to outlast pures.
---
Neither pures or mains hardly ever use dds for there spec weapon
---
Let's say you are an interviewer, and someone applies to your job, for the position of an e-sport manager, and you ask if the person has "extensive PVP knowledge" and they ask back "I know what PvP is but I can't do it because I don't know much about it".
---
What would you tell them then? For example, if someone doesn't know why having a drivers license and he applies to become a taxi driver you could tell that one you need a driver's license because you will be driving a car which requires you knowing how to drive it. 
---
Because I can't see the relation there, two persons where one knows how the magic defense is calculated and one doesn't make them any different in the role of e-sport manager but it would be very important to know if you want to become a good PvPer.

 Hi , would you consider adding an option to boost magic for poh nexus portal teleports? You can boost on regular portals but not on nexus, seems a little odd when you can have portal nexus but can't get same teleports as you could in a regular portal, Nexus is an upgrade, so that magic boost option should remain, feels weird to have extra room just for a single portal.
---
Oh thanks for the very constructive advice! How do I give you gold?
---
Wait that's actually genius
---
Gmaul isn't really OP on a lvl50atk account
---
It's only broken when combined with things like an AGS or Eldermaul both 75atk weapons
---
Barrelchest anchor it's pretty good with too but that's 60atk
---
id assume it works for any death u lose items at
---
That's an amazing idea?

I vote this ironic content unironically gets added.

Yeah they wonder why no one wants to fight back, they're always trying to skull trick and if they do they'll abuse ancient mace and smite to guarantee they get everything.
---
wish i could give you a brain so you wouldn't fall for skull tricks anymore!
---
yeah i dont think any shop sells lower than HA value for any item in osrs.  Pre-eoc we had ruby rings in zanaris.

Thanks a lot, I'm never gonna be able to sleep tonight now!

Once your account is banned you can just make a new one to throw money at.

Thank you! Unpopular opinion I'm sure, but I feel like a lot of people on this thread don't actually venture into the wilderness enough and are acting like this would be a complete game changer anyway. 
---
Just pay attention to who you're attacking, does it look like a skull tricker name? Don't attack them. Afraid of losing items? Don't enter a PvP zone

Your stupid ass thinks a team of brids in literal max gear can't kill a single person in bulwark. There's absolutely zero chance you have ever risked above mystics you fucking clown.
---
In a thread where Pkers in support of the nerf have positive upvotes your brainlet self is sitting at the bottom at -30. Even other pkers think you're a fucking retard.
---
It was still fucking dead after 3 months?
---
Tbf the only people that like rushers are rushers
---
To be fair most anything polled to be added to f2p would get immediately voted no on just because too many people would vote out of spite. Even if it was the most useless thing
---
you can take that to anything, imagine if jagex said "we can't get partnership to pass a poll but that was because people are adverse to adding content, so we added partnership anyway because a lot of people want the morytania poh"
---
Runelite plugin incoming.
---
I think you mean "                                                      space bar gang forever".
---
I think he has to hit 2,500 before Oziach gives him the free zenyte.
---
No. What im saying is if i hit bandos a 5 and tele out, then it heals to full hp, it was updated so im get the drop. well at least tried.
---
If it were the servers except for exceptional PvPers who likely signed up to specific sites then you can keep thinking that.
---
The servers can handle thousands of players, if only a few fight in a tourny (less players than duel arena) the servers won't stress.
---
That's why it's called a skull "trick". Even if you think logically the trick could still work.
---
Think of the scam where people trade you a book or whatever it is in fally bank that makes your character run outside real quick.
---
Would anyone think that would happen? No.
---
I feel like you went to get change to take this picture lmao
---
&gt;should not of
---
???
---
Because requiring game knowledge to be accessible only out of game is bad game design.
---
You don‚Äôt see anyone in deep wildy in full ancestral lol.
---
Why not just have a script to randomly pick 50% of the player base and wipe them?
---
Maybe if you dont count uniques which would be dumb to do as that is the whole point of doing ToB.
---
Zilly
---
You enjoy your tinfoil hat then
---
Makes it a weapon for rushers and no one else. Plus it turns to 1m on death yet costs 5m to buy a new one so you have to go 5:1 KDR just to break even on it...
---
If they were that big then you wouldnt be carrying 10k of them of course.
---
I have the map one. It's really nice.
---
Yes.  I'm not disagreeing with that.  I'm disagreeing that you'd call the lower cost caused by "inflation."  Inflation is more gold in the game than the previous measurement.  An even better measurement most people don't bother to include is gp in game \*per player\*.
---
Big yikes
---
less bones for sale = less bones available to be bought lol
---
Nah, get good at the game dip shit. Skull tricking is a huge peice of osrs content that i dont want to see removed.
---
‚ÄúSmall game improvements‚Äù breaks 50% of all pvp accounts. Really sucks for the community to encourage you to Pk and rejuvenate the wilderness, just to have Jagex sweep the rug out from under you. All these people crying that pkers are too OP have NEVER PK‚Äôd. It‚Äôs not easy, don‚Äôt believe me? Go make a pure and try it. Hopefully Jagex doesn‚Äôt nuke your account before you get to enjoy it.
---
Better than nerfing the defensive stats, the only thing it has going for it.
---
Smells like engine work‚Ñ¢
---
Its because reddit is a bunch of people who think the exact same way but also want to believe they are unique and special
---
It‚Äôs a pretty obvious joke
---
Again, this is entirely pointless and I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish by repeating the same thing that I dont agree with over and over.
---
Could be a problem with amount of data that would need to be potentially stored to keep track of the amount of every single different item deposited by every single player.
---
Protect mage halves entangle to 7 secs. It‚Äôs balanced.

---
You mean like how the vote to hide the poll results failed, and a few years later people complained on reddit, and now it's supposedly an integrity issue? I wouldn't have been bothered at all if it went back to a poll, and then it was hidden as a result of the poll results, but just forcing it through like that bothered me slightly.
---
I do wildy content.
---
In the blog they have the idea of changing magic def calculation in pvp only
---
They wanted to start it as a discussion point first, before just putting it into the gsme
---
You get no karma.
---
Integrity changes are just a way of not polling things deliberately, because Jagex thinks they know better than the player base. Anything deemed an "integrity" change wouldn't ever pass a poll.
---
Not really an abuse of mechanics, more so an abuse of someone‚Äôs lack of pvp knowledge. It‚Äôs just taking advantage of someone who doesn‚Äôt know how skulling works in osrs. I anti pk all the time and know all the tricks in the books so I can avoid skulling. 
---
I still like the idea proposed by op tho, I know a lot of people are too lazy/just don‚Äôt care enough to learn all the skull tricking methods to avoid.
---
Answer to your question - I killed 700 on a non-iron without a drop, have never went back and don't regret it. They are just too much of a pain in the ass to kill. Who knows, if I had gotten a drop sooner, perhaps I wouldn't think the same way about them.
---
Yeah, as someone who use to wank on chaturbate all the time, I can confirm. You remember who donated and make an effort to engage with them in the hopes they donate again
---
Varrock
---
What happened to that big death mechanic rework we were getting?
---
They even had a big survey about what we'd want to see, and it seemed like they ere going to add an instance gold sink concept to everything else except supps so you could still suicide them.
---
There is no penalty for trying, may as well give it a shot. I'd imagine 70-80cmb stats would be able to take her down, although it'll be a fight.
---
blowpipe
---
I mean I don't know the specifics of the changes in and out. But if it means saving someone's potential years of work based on lack of knowledge of very new content versus someone having to spend a little more time on something, I'm gonna have to go with the side that doesn't completely ruin someone's experience.
---
How is that relevant here? You can‚Äôt really argue that jagex doesn‚Äôt poll the most important updates to the game. You can has an opinion on whether or not you think this is healthy for the game, but pretending that someone is a conspiracy theorist for pointing out the discrepancy between jagex claiming players control the direction of the game while simultaneously massive unpolled changes is uncalled for
---
They're getting into the position where their company is being overhauled and the incorrect people are being hired for jobs that they're not qualified for. You can tell by the whole MTX thing that they're more concerned with churning quick profit and not worrying about the health of the game. Decisions like these to outlaw the poll system and claim it as an "integrity change" are Jagex's notion that they're not interested with the trust with the playerbase and want to take the game into their own hands, completely. They'll continue to dip their feet and try to do things they know we're not okay with just to see what they can and can't get away with.

---
On this episode of hcim deaths!
---
Friggin dope dude
---
I think you should probably find a way to just quit RS entirely. 
---
hahahaha wow
---
&gt;They need to move the unique PvM content out of the wilderness, straight up. The bosses, MA2, black chins, clue steps - All of it. As long as it exists in there, it will be populated with people who have no interest in PvPing, and PvPers will essentially just be there to inconvenience everyone, not for interesting PvP encounters.
---
 And then PKers will have nobody to kill aside from other PKers... who probably wouldn't be there in the first place because the Wilderness would be 99% empty with your proposed changes.
---
 Let me preface this by saying I've never PKed a day in my life and that I don't plan to. Nothing wrong with it, it's just not my thing.  
---
 The Wilderness is composed of high-risk, high-reward activities. PKers _are_ the high-risk part of it. Don't like it? Don't participate in those activities. None of them are mandatory, you can go from 1-99 in every skill in the game without ever stepping foot in the Wilderness. You can get a quest cape without ever stepping foot in the Wilderness. The _only_ thing you can't do is complete the Achievement Diary cape, however you don't need to risk anything for that so technically it's still on the table unless you're a HCIM.
---
 So let me ask you this: Why are your needs so much more important than the people who PK? Why should you be allowed to make good GP/h or EXP/h without any risk while the PKers lose one of their prime money makers and something they clearly enjoy?
---
you can do it with 60+ stats easily with pots
---
That's an excellent idea. I'd actually start bringing claws to antipk if they implemented that
---
It's really hard to get skulltricked if you pay any attention, how babied do you need to be?
---
It's a valid comparison 
---
"Other games having something has nothing to do with our game" is a completely valid argument
---
Sure he could have been nicer, but his point still stands.
---
Chances are the people falling for skull tricks are players who have no interest in the wilderness &amp; don't want to be there in the first place. 
---
I don't see how OP's proposal will encourage people to fight back. It's possible for them to take that approach now &amp; just turn their attack options on if they are attacked by another player. 
---
If anything, I see OP's proposal just leading to people bringing full d'hide with them to do their clues or an MSB to AGS/Maul. People will be ragging before they bring an effective set-up to fight back on the odd chance they encounter another player.
---
Deep wild for the most part is largely clan based &amp; always has been. If PvP encouragement is the goal, then this is definitely not the right approach to take.
---
Everyone was having a good time with it when it was happening. Why pretend to be so bitter about it now?
---
I don't like how the big changes are "integrity changes" and the minor changes to the game no one gives a shit about slash items being able to slash webs being polled.
---
Bulwark nerf, completely not needed.  Its an item made to enhance your odds at surviving, the only 2 handed shield in the game.  If they're really going through with this, they should give it some uses outside the wilderness first.  Maybe by adding an actual tank mechanic to a boss? You know, something that would give justiciar a use as well.  They said that Justiciar would be good at raids 2, but its honestly trash and a big let down.
---
G-Maul nerf.  Wow, one of the most iconic weapons in the entire game.  This has been around since like 2005 or some shit and has stayed the same for 14 years, and now they're suddenly nerfing it without a poll?
---
But don't worry guys! We get to vote on slash weapons slashing through webs!!
---
&gt; Getting skull tricked is on par with getting lured or scammed.
---
  That's not strengthening your argument considering that Jagex has repeatedly added measures to the game to prevent luring and scamming. They've been pretty clear from the start that the wildy is supposed to be risky, but that players are supposed to be able to understand the level of risk that they're undertaking. Skull tricking is an obvious attempt to subvert the way the skulling mechanic is supposed to work. It's in the game and I'm not faulting people for using it, but nobody should be acting like Jagex would be out of line by closing a loophole in a mechanic that was clearly never intended to be there in the first place. If they wanted it to be the case that you risk all of your items in self-defense PvP then the skulling mechanic would've reflected that from the start. Players found a workaround that wasn't intended. It'll probably get closed eventually.
---
Toxic blowpipe with which darts? pls
---
No it‚Äôs just a way for pvmers to cry about something that never actually happens
---
Reducing as in usage. Lol.
---
If it had no usage anywhere else than it can‚Äôt be reduced further than that.
---
It's not scamming a fight if you're not looking to fight to begin with (hence not skulling up). If you ask me, wanting low-risk fights (being able to keep up to 4 items while the opponent is only able to maybe keep 1) isn't healthy gameplay either. This seems like an unnecessary change that removes a dynamic that's been in the game forever
---
I read that update and couldnt help but wonder why they did that.   It's a niche item that isnt being used for its function so we are nerfing it.
---
One of my all time favourite Onion articles came from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnX-D4kkPOQ
---
Lame, you almost had an argument. You seem to have given up. I would draw the line at conceivable scenarios. If your counterexample is a poll so ridiculous jagex would never even ask, why would you think that's a good starting point?
---
Just look at the name of who‚Äôs attacking you and fight only that person?
---
Edgeville
---
Not to mention they readded without a poll I believe.
---
I believe rune is meta
---
So the exact same thing rs3 has except it goes to a good cause where your idea doesnt? Lmao
---
As it should be.  I'm not looking to die, and Im using this big ass tanky fuck off shield to tank and get away.  Work for your fucking kill instead of coasting using level 40 gear while risking nothing. 
---
You're not pking for sport.  You're pking because you like being an asshole.  Skillers are never going to fight back. And when/if they do,  there's no challenge,  so you might as well kill cows.
---
[yeah](https://bl.reddit.com/r/RunescapeHentai/comments/cb8asm/konar/)
---
Pleeeeenty of non irons use the sand grinder because sandstone is some of the best mining exp in the game right now.
---
Right, but as you grow from adult to older adult, your perspective, frame of thought, and ideas change/grow. This naturally comes with experience and time. This means that when you think back as a 40 year old on things you did when you were 20, you‚Äôll think it was stupid. 
---
What I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt really debatable either. And I think you actually agree with what I‚Äôm saying. The thing is that you guys nitpicked on the 10 year old thing and instead of focusing on the point I was making and turned us on this tangent.
---
how is it personal if I call everyone a random loser
---

---
It's almost like people who aren't trying to PvP get fucking irritated and enjoy the game less when someone attacks them.  People who aren't trying to PvP usually don't have a setup to make them effective against someone who is.  Why?  Because those people aren't bringing expensive T70+ gear into the wildy when 4+ shitlords just stack up and try to spec them out.  You can't fucking compete against that, it's dumb as fuck.
---
Sure, there's the occasional asshole who says they can take that scenario, and I'm sure they could if the group of pker's has a form of collective downs syndrome and one forgot to bring a weapon.  But the vast majority of situations, there's no fucking point of even doing anything but running away.  And I gotta say, running away isn't exactly the peak of PvP content.
---
I enjoy PvP in games where PvP is even remotely balanced around the concept of people wanting to fight each other.  This shit ain't balanced around that.  It's balanced around giving one side an incentive to be harassed and giving the other side the ability to harass.  Essentially, they promote us being cunts to each other.
---
Fucking genius /s

They dont have to ruin the pure‚Äôs account by the way. Worst case scenario they cant use the altar and train on undead druids. It can also be made toggleable

How do you get skull tricked in 2019? Always right click is still an option...

Because the point is not a plausible scenario but a hyperbolic thought with an obvious answer to show you that the premise is ok
