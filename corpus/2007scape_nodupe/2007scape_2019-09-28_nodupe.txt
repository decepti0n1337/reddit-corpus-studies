Hope so, desert needs more love

I still feel like these are incredibly niche uses that hardly qualify as "freaking amazing," like I'd rather use a house tab and mounted glory for a quarter the price of a salve tab, and I don't even have my quest cape. And who dies with so many accumulators that they need to get more more than, like, once?
---
Tyrone longsword
---
Tbf offmychest is absolutely horrific, r/trueoffmychest is much better, and they're not a bunch of social justice warriors.
---

---
Also the admins of Reddit have said they're against people banning based off participating in other subs, but they can't/won't do anything about it. Imo it's pretty pathetic, as they don't differentiate between the degree of participation.
---
Doesn't the effect animation happen over your character, not the npc?? I could be wrong, I haven't played in months.
---
Why do people buy gp? Making your own money is way more fulfilling.
---
I only put 4 of each because I don't have more (their drop rate is bad, and I'm an ironman). I saw on youtube that you don't need to fill it to work though.
---
it lost weight because you removed some of heavy metal from the helmet and replaced it with tougher and lighter basilisk jaw ‚Ñ¢
---
I wanna eat monkfish on the ground too. Cause I'm just a Savage.
---
Im not. Devalues my keywork knowledge
---
Yea I can wreck 127 Dag's in like 10 minutes while alching.
---
Lumbridge castle basement
---
I have quest cape, and I'm really excited when a new quest is announced
---
Salve tab is probably 20 to 30 seconds closer to a fairy ring than edgeville.
---
PVP accounts lose accumulators a lot.
---
You're right, they are niche, but they are still incredibly useful in certain scenarios. Pretty much every non-standard spell or teleport is niche but incredibly useful.
---
There is pretty much never a reason where picking less damage for more defense is ever worth it in pvm
---
Did my part to keep them from getting new content so long as I'm forced out there.  Protip:  divide the spade into handle, rod and shovel for 3 player ambushes
---
Grind for 500 level free skills and grab wines at the altar jumping between 2 worlds, 300k/h
---
Ive had it fail a few times cuz i didnt fill both; id question how accurate that vid is
---
The only click that gets registered to Jagex in the first place is the bone being used on a altar. You clicking the bone to select it is not counted as an action in both the game or client. It‚Äôs basically a wasted click.
---
No argument there.
---
Vanaka doesnt assign a ton but its one of the highest weighted tasks from him. And chances are the task you get is fast enough that you dont have to skip it.
---
I also favor magic, and I'm also frustrated with how magic in rs is. I managed to get 99 magic anyway, but still
---
It's not
---
jokes aside that‚Äôd be pretty bomb
---
if it was near lumbridge. as a new player you‚Äôd get to see the high end players running towards raids and wonder and ask about what they‚Äôre doing.
---
Farm the herb
---
I think they might eventually dip below 2m but it'll take a long time for them to stabilize there. That might be months away.
---
I think black mask or whip are a better comparison than hydra leather or zenyte.
---
Have an offer for 3m has not sold.
---
word! Been super annoying
---
Lotta butthurt nerds in here over nothing.
---
far too high of requirements. 3 rc max!
---
Does running as a candidate exempt you from being investigated for past corruption? Maybe Trump is only having him investigated because he is an opponent. Does his motive change anything? 
---
In this case, I think if Biden isn‚Äôt guilty of anything, it will just make Trump look bad. If he is, Trump will be able to claim ‚Äúupholding justice‚Äù or something as his motive.
---
Are you going to slip an rs reference into the name?
---
This is exactly how I work when I do gwd. If someone that is looking to make money is willing to tank for me I will offer them all the drops and only split unique's. This is super beneficial for new players trying to make money.
---
*Nothingburger*
---
same! I never cared about untrimmed capes but slayer is such a prestigious one. Takes a lotta care.
---
Looks like farming will be my first 99 and im not sure how to feel about it lol.
---
Like Stat Spy, which is useful when you don't have a third-party client, or Monster Examine which is useful when a quest just came out and you want to be the first to update a wiki page
---
I don't get all the anger being caused by the possibility of it "being another mutagen hunt". The current design is sick as is and nobody is forcing you to do it. Honestly little cosmetic completionist goals like that have been and always will be one of the things that make OSRS cool
---
Yes assuming we get everything you just said along with stretched mode (seriously how the fuck is this not in the default client) I would use it. You just listed everything that I actually use runelite for
---
Other?
---
Ok, but like, does it work?
---
I have been doing sort of half and half for quests, quick guides definitely help but only use them when I‚Äôm stuck or confused, planning to get a few done over the weekend :)
---
the herb
---
You're being intentionally obtuse.
---
Tbf it‚Äôs a big heavy wooden shield, try casting spells with one of those in your hand.
---
So the shield in its entirety makes no sense.
---
Imagine trusting anybody on RS
---
It's the "I'm that ~~asshole~~ guy using a canon" tax.
---
It most definitely is not harder than monkey madness.
---
I did it in about 25 minutes with no guide.
---
MM1 takes a solid hour even with a guide.
---
That doesn't do anything to the forks that already exist, and it won't prevent those people with the source to those forks from sharing it again
---
Well, that's just this particular combination of drops. The dagger itself is 1/32k I think. Also, are you genuinely surprised that just buying bonds is faster and easier than actually playing the game to get money?
---
They could buy the physical host from the maintainer, but I have a copy of the code from the main repository (I do) that‚Äôs mine forever.
---
&gt; i think it's copy-paste adamant kiteshield stats
---
It is, and that's exactly the issue. They bothered to design and develop a new model for the shield, put it behind a quest requiring 60s, lunar diplomacy, and considered a master quest, and they give it copy-pasted 30 defense adamant shield stats. 
---
It should be a full upgrade from mirror shield, whether it has mithril stats or rune stats, it should be available to mage and range just like mirror shield is.
---
Get members, the game is so much more enjoyable as one, also far way less bots.
---
Revs.
---
There‚Äôs more people doing revs for cash. There‚Äôs a giant list of reasons but it‚Äôs a bunch of small influences leading to more people at revs but also more Pkers at revs. Buffs and nerfs to different gear and attacks, changes in PVP mechanics, etc.
---
So it‚Äôs not as safe or economical to use the Wildy weapons due to the ether risk and higher chance of dying at revs. And the other bosses in the Wildy can be done with other gear without issue or just aren‚Äôt that popular anyway.
---
So you have more rev Wildy items coming in and less demand for them.
---
They also don‚Äôt item sink, I expect the craws bow to be sub 5m in a year tops.
---
Why not both?
---
there's nothing wrong with killing animals, especially not eating them
---
You don‚Äôt have to do a bas. task though, after 3 months or so it‚Äôll be an awful task and nobody will do it.
---
What is it made of? Kind of looks like this plastic I used before that could be dyed then remoulded by putting it hot water, allowing it to liquify a little, putting it in the shape that you want and allowing it to solidify. 
---
Will have to find out what it was called, would be awesome to make one of these.
---
&gt;	with their 1750 total level

Oof

I refused to play on mobile till it is fixed

someone enjoying the game. wtf how could they?
---
I also saw a group of them picking wheat.
---
But you still need to have completed the Fremennik Isles to be able to wear it.
---
I answered the first option, becuase I don't want it to become easier to kill people after they already made it harder to not die in pvp.
---
F.
---
It use to. Back before the grand exchange was introduced, it got pretty boring though
---
How much did you pay the chinese for that infernal
---
Although it's not part of their vanilla client, an improvement to their official GE API would also be nice, rather than their current 24hr daily price

Thats a little... Farfetch'd...sir

Ah yes, the old OSB hacking accounts that are level 3 with nothing on them when they could've chosen banks with billions of GP or multiple accounts with smaller amounts to make it look less obvious. Must've been OSB and not anything else :) I'm not even an OSB user and your comment is idiotic.
---
Only thing to do now is start an Ironman and do them all again :D
---
Yeah just found out rev bots are a thing. Guess it'll collect dust forever.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_items
---
Quest items are generally items used, made, or obtained only during quests. These include:
---
Items that are used only in the quest, but not anywhere else, like the Red cog from the Clock Tower
---
Rewards from quests, like Iban's staff from the Underground Pass
---
Unofficial rewards, like the Blurite sword from The Knight's Sword
---
Items that may be kept after the quest is complete, but only have a use during the quest, like the Diary of Herbi Flax from the Shades of Mort'ton
---
Items that may be kept and used after the quest is complete, like the Dramen staff from the Lost City
---
Quest items do not include:
---
Common items, even though they are required for quests, which can be obtained and used without starting or completing any quests, like Buckets and Crushed gems
---
Items not used during quests, like the Security book
---
Food, like Lobster
---
Items that are unlocked by quests, but must be purchased, like Dragon longswords and Rune platebodies, or can only be obtained after the quest, but are not a direct reward for the quest, such as unique Temple Trekking items.
---
Nah nah
---
An item being in the game for pvp and being pvp-only are different things
---
Ive used a gmaul spec on a trash mob and its very fun
---
All that making a super strong weapon pvp-only does it keep the price hella down and make another dumb thing to worry about
---
I dont want them to release pvp weapons that have powerful special attacks AND are bis for dps in pvm. That sounds like super endgame raids content, not bounty hunter store content
---
Well it's been years for the craftsman and forgagers to be more efficient with materials, they know how to decrease the weight but increasing the durability.
---
Make one about bonds being 5 mil and CCwarriors are the black dude with sunglasses, and people that play legit are the black dude crying
---
What were some of your doosys?
---
thanks brother, 10k is crazy you as well lmao!
---
I do feel you though balancing is an important aspect. Tbh i'd just tweet (gambit I think?) about it. Maybe they could add balancing as an additional polling question.
---
My opinion is that for actual pvp(i.e. two players who intend to fight each other) offense should be prioritized, but the bulwark did nothing wrong
---
Even better if you haven‚Äôt gotten the weed perk + seed box, that‚Äôs a few k more xp. Even passively, farming is still pretty quick for the seconds put in if you can afford trees
---
Til....been getting pissed at dying snapdragons on ultracompost.

It shows when you manually drop an item but you have to click Alt

Does magic work like electricity? Wood's a good insulator I guess but then that doesn't explain metal shields

Alright rargh

It would be a good insulator but for it to be sturdy it would be pretty heavy.

In order to aid you in your search, the Chieftan appoints Fremennik Miles to accompany you. A soft-spoken, yet promising young lad that will escort you along your journey, ushering in a time-of-your life adventure as the two of you become friends and eventually lovers.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so much about hate, but more about a superiority complex people have on this game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They don‚Äôt. They have a problem with toxic PvP‚Äôers. There is a difference.
---
No you didn‚Äôt.  He asked for a source that it‚Äôs fake. You just replied with personal commentary.

For some *actual* reassurance, I think most 40 hour a week people are fine. You'll probably be exhausted by the end of the day, but I still have time for gaming. If you have a wife and kids tho, gl.
---
Wintertodt is so much fun, one of the best content updates ever released. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have it already, full graceful should be a priority above everything, it‚Äôs incredibly useful. 
---
For early content, questing and achievement diaries will be best bet. Look up theoatrix ‚Äútheoatrix beginner guide‚Äù or ‚Äútheoatrix members quests‚Äù on YouTube he has many vids on beginner guides and quests to do. Then after that, achievement diaries to unlock the rewards. Then with those rewards slayer and bossing can begin
---
You get a lot of chaos runes from barrows which are often used to buy onyxes
---
This reminds me of that picture of Christian Bale in American Psyhco where somebody made his arm really long.
---
That's a great term for extroverted people - addicts of society
---
I've thought about this before. It would absolutely destroy the economy of the game but I could finally get that trimmed music cape so it's probably worth it to implement
---
I got one of those genius pipes on a really good deal like 25 or 30 bucks and haven't really looked back. Takes 2 seconds to clean and hits smooth as fuck. Also unbreakable by normal standards. You could run it over ez.
---
/u/JagexGambit already said that the problem of pvp atm is that pvmers only want to escape from a fight. Jagex could poll ancient warrior PvP-armours and they would pass a poll.
---
The problem is that Jagex only considers the first p who attacks to be doing pvp and the other p who defend is treated like some kind of npc that needs an updated loot-table when there is not enough being risked in the wildy.
---
Seems like they have a problem with PVPers as a whole, not just toxic ones. 
---
As a PvPer myself, I dislike toxic ones, they give us a bad rep.
---
Explain.

Im in love. I want this with a blowpipe too.
---
They have no way to track what your first 99 is, so it would be impossible for people with multiple 99‚Äôs already to have an untrimmed cape. The only alternative would be to allow all capes to remain untrimmed. Feasible, yes. Worth the dev time, probably not.
---
I dont think it would get voted in because people that already have 99's dont want to show that their first was something like cooking. Also because nothing gets voted in period.
---
Sometimes. Ive only restarted the game a month ago, when I first played I skipped many story lines. Some of them I actually read now... a few of them so far have been interested but still I feel many of them have no real story. The big quests and Multi-Part quest chains are the better ones to read, most shirt quests I don't even bother tor was still
---
I haven't beat SoTE yet, still need a few more requirements. I'm looking forward to it though!
---
He‚Äôs trying to be a chad but he ends up looking like an idiot.
---
Well, 'likely' is subjective. You could reasonably argue that anything over 50% is likely.
---
Vesta's plate sword?
---
yea dude my bad!! bis only applies if u can actually get it or wear it! i forgot full mithril is bis because its in ur price range and has that juicy defense bonus! the scythe is bis? oh no it cant be because it's 700m and i cant afford it. 
---
lets just change the definition of everything just so it fits delusional kids' brains.
---
That's insane. Wow. The pain you must feel...
---
Oh very cool, ty
---
I think he forgot the part where the jaw is the bone and doesn't have the skin and everything still attached to it.
---
I thought it was going to be some kind of basilisk-type centaur
---
Because I don't really see them as microtransactions. I feel like they have the perfect cost to be decent for membership but too prohibitively expensive for someone to outright buy GP impulsively.
---
You could probably buy 100M for under $60 by now, but that's going to cost you over $130 in bonds. What player willing to buy 100M outright isn't also perfectly fine RWTing for it for a significantly lower cost? We all **know** (not guess) that the banrate for gold buyers is disgracefully low, even more so now that Jagex allows indiscriminate account interaction.
---
Seems to me like they genuinely don't give a shit, and it rubs off on the playerbase big time. There is a larger percentage of players RWTing than ever before.
---
My personal guess is that it's because we have so many more 20-somethings with full-time jobs, disposable income, and free time constraints unwilling to put in the time to make their own gold.
---
I'm a 20-something with a full-time job, disposable income, and free time constraints. I can really see where most of them are coming from. I've been playing RuneScape since 2001 and I **definitely** would have bought tons of gold on multiple occasions if I wasn't a hoarder that participated in original holiday drops. On top of that GP is a joke to make in 2019 if you have even a shred of game knowledge.
---
Some are lazy, but I think a lot of them have convinced themselves that they are unable to put in the time to do the work themselves, and they've put on blinders to the fact that they are breaking the rules and harming the game instead of finding a new game that better fits their lifestyle.
---
infinite lyre or fremmy elite boots also do the same, and lyre teleports you to waterbirth island/neitiznot and jatizso after certain tiers of diary as well

---
I see that the common denominator here is that you have no idea what BIS actually means. For one, the snide remarks aren't necessary because GP doesn't even play into what makes something a BIS item. It's about your stats, completed quests, diaries, etc. Account progression, not bank.
---
A BIS item for **you personally** is not the same thing as a BIS item **in general**. I never claimed that the Regen brace was the BIS glove slot item, I just asked if it was the BIS glove item based on my own account progression (haven't completed RFD). In essence, the best gloves that I personally can wear right now.
---
There are two distinct questions that separate 'BIS'. Someone might ask what the best helmet is for training Slayer in general. They're going to get on objective answer that doesn't leave any room for argument. Someone might instead ask what is the best helmet **that they** can wear for training Slayer before they unlock the Slayer helm, and by the way here's my stats.
---
Are you going to train melee completely naked until you hit base-75s and complete RFD? No, you're going to find your BIS items. Your dumb remake doesn't even make any sense because Mithril actually is BIS for some players. BIS for a specific person is meaningless without context.
---
I asked if the Regen brace was BIS for pre-RFD and I was deflected with the standard "git gud" response. Have you ever thought that RFD wasn't yet a top priority for me? That doesn't mean I want to completely ignore combat content until then. My current account is only 50 days old today and I just hit 90m total XP last night. Even then I still have 108 quest points, so it's not like I've been slacking off. I obviously have different priorities than combat or straight questing right now. That doesn't mean I don't want decent gloves if I'm doing a quest with a boss fight or training a bit of combat. It's obviously not laziness if I haven't tapped the brakes at all in 50 days gaining XP and getting my 6th Skillcape.
---
You can't see the forest for the trees if you don't even know what a tree looks like.
---
Lol jeez wtf is wrong with you 
---
Sure it‚Äôs not a bit acheivement but you‚Äôre pathetic
---
"other"
---
You're right that they care about rs3 first and that it's not all the OSRS teams fault by any means, but the higher ups at Jagex invest money in new content and events like Deadman mode LANs. They're absolutely doing it to turn profits rather than a passion for the game, but they don't want to lose players either way.
---
If the solution to this was complex or cost a lot of time/money like stopping mobile botting, I would be more understanding... But Jagex could've given the greenlight to the OSRS team to email OSBuddy and pull the plug on this in a couple hours without much investment. They're letting it drag on and possibly not issuing any punishments, which is just going to encourage more people to create and take part in situations like this in the future. This is just negligence, poorly handled from a game and buisness perspective.
---
Don't you dare give them any ideas
---
Considering how big coins are 500m coins would  weight roughly a megaton of gold(20g/coin) making a pile of coins aprox 7-8m tall
---
Casting spells is hard enough as is, I‚Äôve never managed so much as one yet.
---
Your lpt triggers the bot because it thinks your pedaling something
---
'Buy....'
---
Kinda unfair conparison to make, as top-tier weapons in DMM were very limited, creating a huge power spike between PvP weapons and whip as many other used. DMM had no d claws/kodai/ancestral etc., ags was very rare, not to mention how PvP weapons didn't degrade and VLS spec only required 25% energy as opposed to the proposed 35%.
---
Was VLS OP in DMM? Definitely. Will it be equally OP in live game PvP? Not at all.
---
Not like noted  dagonath bones is bad tho
---
Ranging is only better than melee off task.
---
They're generally pretty decent and are most useful at lower levels (under 70). They give a brief overview of several different options for training basically every skill, and you can choose which ones you'd like to do based on how afk it is, how much you like it, how much money you'd make/spend, etc. There are better, more in-depth guides for specific skilling methods, with a ton of resources on Youtube, Reddit, and in the skilling methods Discord.
---
Generally you'll be just fine using the wiki to figure out a method that interests you, and then doing more research on that specific method elsewhere.
---
If you're specifically looking into the reasons why certain numbers of people have certain 99s, you need more data. You can never have too much data. For instance, you have to subtract everyone with a 2277 total from that number. Maxed players weren't mining for money. They had no choice but to max the skill to max their account in general. How many people just love the mining skill or just happened to choose that to AFK train over literally any other skill? How many people just love the Mining cape and decided fuck it, I'll max it? How many people with 99 Mining are high-leveled in general and are no longer active players?
---
There are a bunch of questions you could ask, and every one of them whittles down that number. There are 12,307‚Ä¨ people with 99 Mining that have a total level under 2277. I think the most important question you have to ask is how many of those 12,307‚Ä¨ people are bots and/or goldfarmers doing all the work that most people aren't willing to?
---
It's not spite voting, I would have voted yes to all the weapons if they were limited to PvP worlds and BH worlds only. Like was suggested by a Jmod in the feedback thread. 
---
/u/JagexGambit asked it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d6vb34/polling_pvp_updates/f0w2ld1/?context=3)
---
That would have passed but instead the only thing they changed was the weapons method to degrade and drop on death, which was never something that people were concerned with. I think they should degrade to dust upon death, so that you cannot have your team pick up your PvP weapon in case you die, but it's not something people give a shit about when voting.

I disagree, I'm just proposing an alternative to forced wilderness content

You don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll fix it before coming to os. I‚Äôm there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll make the same mistake twice
---
Hahaha :)
---
Yeah that's true I guess. I wouldn't really be interested in playing an OSRS where PT has become the meta currency because GP is so inflated.
---
Well ya, those investors like money :(
---
The goals i always recommend is aim for the questcape, hard diaries and slayer.
---
The pet rock memery is beautiful and I will defend this opinion to the death
---
I meant calling it spite voting, my b for being unclear. Spite voting implies its out of active dislike and unreasonable, when for pvmers it makes sense
---
And yeah if it was just on pvp/bh worlds i dont think people who its not affecting have a real vote. If the pvp council looks at things loke that or polls like that are easier to pass(50% even is fine) im okay with that.
---
Or maybe instead of untrimmed, its given a different trim to show others this was your first. Since untrimmed only suggests that its your only 99 (unless they look up your stats of course)
---
You've hit the nail on the head mate, I'd wager these fuck heads are using the same email/pass for these gold buying sites as they are for OSRS... And probably everything else!
---
Use runelite
---
Saw this on Facebook lol
---
so air runes would be 50xp per ess at 99, or 2.65k xp/lap
---
h8
---
Yeah Lost City is about finding Zanaris, I liked that the same concept could apply to a different story arc, kind of like Dragon Slayer II.
---
&gt; It most definitely is not harder than monkey madness.
---
Difficulty /= quest length. Maybe MM1 is more tedious so to speak, but I don't know how you can compare Jormungand to something like the Jungle Demon which you can easily safespot and let the gnomes do 90% of the work. MM1 is also usually done very early on an account, and doing Exiles with base 40s would definitely be something else than doing it on their mains like everyone is now.
---
Are you hiring?
---
Well with elite diary you get unlimited teleport boots

why would u include di theyve been closed for over a year and became irrelevant in the wilderness in 2015 when they made the mistake of hopping off rots dick

Why? You're choosing to buy gold through jagex instead of playing hours of content that's a core part of the game and gives meaning to all the other parts of the game.

I'm sure this was sarcastic, but I wanted to the math and...60 to 80 is 9785 yew logs, which would be 1.957 mil (if you're selling at 200gp each, which is OVER the current ge price). With that much, he could afford the gloves, the legs, and the boots. Each other individual item is worth more than that.
---
Nah your right. Taste of hope was pretty decent although the boss was kinda whack for access to ToB.
---
My Arm pretty much exclusively existed to add another farming patch into the game in a time where Jagex thought every update needed another herb farming patch.
---
Exiles legitimately took 14 minutes for me to complete on my ironman and that was with farming the shield drop as well. No food no prayer pots needed at all through the boss fights. Just camped protection prayers and lazy flicked piety.
---
Corsair is a f2p quest that is a perfect example of Jagex's "market research" that told them they need to hand hold every new player to increase their average playtime by 15 minutes. You don't need a quest to introduce a tiny little corner of the map then show them each have the quest show the player every single resource the new area has to offer like a god damn checklist.

You'd expect an alt to know better than to use DWH tho

I was more specifically targeting the talk to the people of lunar island without a pass, unlimited teles and noted dk bones is pretty sweet.
---
VLS was the most expensive item in 2011 by far for staking wtf are you guys smoking, even with turmoil chaotic claws, VLS was basically the equivalent of a four spec AGS with double the accuracy and best staking spec weapon in the game that could singlehandedly seal duels. It has a minimum hit of 20-120% with each spec but gets basically claw accuracy and extremely high ko potential

Hold on afto pet rock??

I logged out of my account in the GE with some things in my inventory and some offers waiting to buy. I logged back in (12hrs later) and was in castle wars. I didn't have anything on or in inventory. All of my bank was there but my tabs were collapsed and all of my offers had been completed and were in my bank.... Is this a glitch?
---
I thought it was a plugin in RuneLite that showed valuable drops, not a default option. Whoops.
---
I have it turned on now for the next time a get a 1/39m drop
---
There's no evidence Jagex has ever had official contact with them over any plugin. If there was anything Adam/Runelite would've screencapped it or gotten a public post about it from Jagex or a Jagex employee.
---
I know but that teleport is entirely replaced by the boots.
---
The lore of osrs has diverged a bit from where rs3 took it, and I prefer it the way it is now. Let‚Äôs not bring in what they did to Zaros in rs3, because imo it completely ruined his character.

I really love this raunchy, medieval, simple style that Runescape used to have. It's dark, depressing fits in perfectly  with the other medieval armors. Ahrim's is my favorite example of this style of armor. Simple, bleak, depressing, but still looks great and medieval.
---
I feel like some of the newer items that OSRS introduced have been too "fantasy" and not enough "medieval". [Dragonstone armor](https://i.imgur.com/AJGhYcF.png) is one example. That really got me worried about the future direction of the art style of the game. Especially since the Jmod who made this defended his decision and thought it looked okay, even after our feedback.
---
The art team has gotten better recently though at keeping the art aligned with the spirit of OSRS. The redesigned nezzy helm looks great, and so does the new Hosidius town.

Anyway yeah this shield was sick and FOG was the fucking best

But if fewer people kill them because the drop table is terrible, then there will be fewer of them.

&gt; He literally told them in the video before this one that he has a ***secret*** Discord account in their server under a different name
---
And.... how would they know which one is his?
---
Code breaker was stupid. I had no idea what I was doing and just button mashed until it was right.
---
You can play f2p without paying but if you want p2p with more content there‚Äôs a monthly fee. You could also make money ingame to buy bonds which will give you access to p20
---
The video quality on his twitter and this reddit post are both twice baked potato
---
Nobody is investing in to jagex they are investing in to their parent company.
---
Could have just read "got my first pet" and replied
---
Fewer people kill them = fewer jaws = higher price for jaw = more people kill them. It literally has no effect on the price of the jaw.
---
Truly
---
Say he did in fact rwt, what are you going to do about it?
---
It was very clear in the interview. The botting people said something like "Yeah, the channels you can see only scratch the surface of what's in this discord", to which Pugger replied "Actually, I have a different account that can see all of those channels already in this server".
---
The simple implication in there being: that he was in VC on his regular account.

wow how did you survive that long grind?

Does anyone know what is the most efficient slayer blocklist for xp?

I hear this kind of thing a lot but truthfully Runescape has always had plenty of variety in this department, especially post-Classic. There's a quest boss that's literally a [brain piloting a mech suit](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrelchest).
---
How about the Elemental Workshop, or Pest Control? I could list examples all day but I think you get the idea.
---
Ok
---
Yea it looks super chunky. Like a Mario 64 texture.
---
Not like you can‚Äôt literally google gold prices lol
---
I did watch the video. I thought using that number was irresponsible.
---
It could be quite difficult to scale it to 1k scripts. That's about 1 terrabyte of ram that you'd need to spread across like 20 servers (or at least containers) with IPs that are spread out. Like you could use VPN but would become quite expensive.
---
That's also like 2% of active users.
---
Most of them seemed to be running 30-80 bots max. It kind of implies that it's difficult to scale above that.
---
I'm not saying that bot makers can't make money, but 200k is a fantasy number. Pug took the numbers he was told and just multiplied it by 3.
---
What so you think about Justicar?
---
Not to my knowledge. I highly doubt they did RWT because they always bragged about how their bank value was growing and it would show with the gear they wore when they weren't hosting. Although it's possible some of them have.   
---
Nobody would really know unless they said as much, and I never even heard a host so much as hint at it.
---
Yes, I think you could *potentially* "boil the frog" and make more short-term money with a slow burn on MTX, once the game is in irreversible decline like RS3 after EoC.
---
But OSRS isn't in that state yet. With the release of mobile, even though the spike is coming down, there are still more active players now than in OSRS' history.
---
MTX immediately accelerates any decline, and in OSRS in particular because of its culture, the decline will be steeper than you'd see in other games. Jagex/their parent company knows this, that's why MTX isn't in the game yet.
---
I agree that its likely inevitable, but I think we're looking at a longer time scale than a lot of people think.
---
Any chance the teleports will be added to the POH Tele rooms/nexus lists?
---
Edge dungeon, hop worlds, place self over plate body, hop back to his world.

Unwritten code is a great way to describe it. Technically, Trump could have personally fired Mueller from special counsel since it is an executive brance officer, but the unwritten code dictates that the Attorney General fires the special counsels. I believe the reason he didn‚Äôt go so far is to protect the checks &amp; balances of congress and protect himself from impeachment (what good is investigating a president for crimes if the president investigates himself).
---
In the case of talking with a foreign leader, that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs hard to accomplish without POTUS direct involvement. In the past, Presidents often speak with foreign leaders to coordinate their officials to conduct intelligence operations, or to get Americans out of prison, or collect high value targets.

It's way too strong.

1/50 from vannaka it was worse for charldar. Considering the total weight from duradel i expect it to be more common from duradel than vannaka assuming itll have (give or take) the same weighting.

Doesn‚Äôt matter.  Catapults are worse than trebuchets in every conceivable way. You can ask r/trebuchetmemes if you don‚Äôt believe me.

You know rubber chicken is a weapon too right?

This is supposed to be a holiday or possibly clue reward weapon. Why else would it use cabbage as ammo?

Olm transmorph gave me a reason to do CM solos and I enjoy them. I believe they've strayed away from RNG transmorph skins and will only add completions of a hard mode as the requirement to change a pets cosmetic appearance, like they did in the gauntlet

Literally playable.

Hypothetically, if Jagex did something that actually kills the experience of the game as we know it now, would it be possible for someone to make a client launcher that was solely local for singleplayer use? Essentially true Iron Man mode. (Of course features like the GE and PvP zones would be redundant, but I would just want to continue playing the game I grew to love.)
---
I kind of wish that Jagex would've released Classic as a standalone game after the servers got cut.
---
I would definitely, if you could make a toxic blowpipe I would buy in a heartbeat
---
I drink propane and propane accessories.

My doctor has no idea how I'm still alive but it's ok because they're Korean. They would never understand what good American propane can do for a man.

You can get it literally on your 1st kill or 1201st kill. And i got it on my 1201st kill.

According to a friend who has the diaries and is godlike at pvm, its unironically slower with boots.

&amp;#x200B;
---
Havent tested it myself since, well, not sure I wanna complete the diary.
---
\&gt; Also that single inventory slot doesn't matter with DHCB at least. 
---
True, but an irrelevant downgrade is still a downgrade.  And a downgrade as an elite reward... solid meh
---
Also, dont have a DHCB and likely will never bother, for what its worth
---
You don't have to complete mountain daughter, just kill the Kendal.
---
you don't use anguish at vork either, you use salve
---
you'll be fine if you bring the melee switch and bgs spec
---
100% agree. Too much fantasy blurs the line too much between rs and other mmorpgs. Runescape needs to stick with its roots with not just medieval designs but medieval based quests
---
Edgeville on a pvp world. It‚Äôs safe and fun and it‚Äôs a great way to stay in shape
---
They just need to determine if losing 50% of their playerbase would lose them profit compared to what theyd make through mtx. X amount of whales = how many memberships? That's what theyd need to figure out to determine how worth it mtx would be.
---
Sorry when I said I'm too poor for an anguish, I actually meant, I'm an idiot
---
Oh, I should try that. Bank skillling while people fight around me. Would be fun

shes a guy bro

It's basically used exclusively in PKing. Some DHers will do 1 defense fights just to try and get as huge hits as possible.

Do they not have a backup with fog on it? Bound to

I mainly did the diary so I can actually do DKS, personally. Never touched them before it. If Sea Boots 4 really is slower, then it's a negligible amount. Also the Lyre being able to directly take you to Jatizso and Neitiznot is nice for clues, if you're into doing those when you get them.
---
Epic
---
neither of those even have last-destination options, just left click options
---
vanaka

To be fair, if you've played long enough, you can say that about any skill. Back in the day a guy in my clan got 99 cooking and then they released cook x. He got pissed off, quit for a bit and got 99 fletching. Then they released fletch x and never came back.
---
Or the other way around, I forgot, it's been a decade and a half. Either way, all skills used to be hard 99s, there's a reason only a few people were maxed back then, and it wasn't (only) because tick manipulation methods weren't known.

Not saying rc should or shouldn't be changed, just saying I don't think this is a valid argument.

Someone has access to your account and is fucking with you.
---
Early on, ironman mode was portrayed as the 'do it your own way' 'anti-efficiencyscape' mode. Now with the rise of best order guides and ironman efficiency, normal accounts are much more like that.
---
Bud your account was accessed by someone else, no doubt about it. Definitely not a bug. Make sure to change your email password too and add two factor authentication.
---
The native client does provide you with notifications. You're notified once when your potion is about to expire and again when it does expire. You're also notified when divine potions wear off.
---
I remember visiting at my grandma's house during summer break and that was where I first got my def high enough to use it, I was so stoked. One of my fondest, most nostalgic memories of this game.
---
Someones got your account details bud
---
Nothing really depends on RC though, unlike other skills. You can easily have 60 by the time you get to Cerberus (bringing this up for the boots, which require 60 RC) just by lamping + Tears of Guthix. You can kill Zulrah and get thousands of essence to finish 65-77 at ZMI easily.
---
Then 77-99 at bloods which you can use with your ToB weapons. Some argue for souls if you want to barrage Slayer. Up to you.
---
RC is a late-game skill for ironmen. There is not much value in training it early by painfully killing banshees, killing wyverns, or doing Temple Treks. You can just kill Zulrah for a blowpipe + magic fang and bank 77 RC passively along the way. This minimizes the effort on your part towards an already slow skill and it also parallelizes multiple grinds (obtaining essence and obtaining a blowpipe).
---
People in this thread are saying it was ugly as fuck but I actually liked the design because it fits on runescape aesthetic, didn't need to be a brilliant design, also its bulkier than normal rune shield so it *did* look stronger imo
---
Like the old rewards such as Berserker shields and Gauntlets for F2Ps.
---
I used crossbow to start then once you get the healers on you switch to blowpipe

It's actually more efficient.

yuh and we've seen woox and other players kill pretty much everything with no weapons/at a mad low level. Those weapons were prolly just used for fun by the great warriors of the time and smallbrain peasants conflated the dude being great with the weapon being great

Wait current DKs require a duo or trio to do well! In my opinion. I would like to see an easier dagganoth boss come in. I'm trying to get 99 defense to make the pet grind even feasible there!
---
You little shat !

Oh idk, the combat triangle
---
"Kid"
---
Not remove it. That's abit extreme. But be able to ban yourself from staking would be perfect. And needs to be implemented in the game ASAP.
---
It‚Äôs not enjoyable because when you die, you lose items. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt enjoy it at all. You hate the fact of losing items, you hate the fact someone can come kill you. If you understand and acknowledge the risk/reward, then you have to understand it‚Äôs not going to be enjoyable. You‚Äôre going to be paranoid if someone logs in or if you get found. That‚Äôs the whole concept, if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt go into the wild so you don‚Äôt have to deal with that. Simple solution.

that would be around 195k xp a hour

The new stuff feels too smooth and new for an old school game. Just look at Zeah the Myths' Guild. Everything is so glossy and smooth, there's no cracking in the bricks or roughness to note, everything has a gloss to it.

The main thing that made Jordan hard was GH2's ridiculous hit detection. GH3 was a lot better about that. If you played Jordan in GH3's engine, it'd be much easier than in GH2's engine.

Do you want slightly faster exp by paying farmers (about 2,6% more Farming exp a day in trees since using ultracompost gives passive Farming exp) or save up money when using ultracompost and resurrection method? If you plant Iasor flower, chance to die is even lower, but Kronos is better for faster growth = faster exp.
---
But like r/bulletbrainsurgery replied to you, Farming level does not change disease chance, but Magic level increases resurrection chance. Farming level only increases your crop yield when harvesting plants which yields varying harvests like alloments, herbs and cactus, but not fruit trees.

I never understood people who got angry at pkers who killed wildy pvmers. There's a risk vs reward there - if you don't want to get pked you can choose not to go there.
---
Agility, farming, prayer(43), slayer, quests, etc.  Depends on what your goal is?  Make GP?  advance the account?  Get to endgame content?  Have *fun*?
---
Right now, my goal is to make money. My account was recently hacked and they cleared my bank, so starting from scratch!
---
Jagex have finally learnt what good gear is!
---
I want my 1 min 30 back
---
So my go to for money making is always farming.  Its how I started in this game and it is good money albeit, tedious at times.  However, do you have skills or preferences?  Like do you prefer killing monsters, training skills, bossing for money?
---
Which is also bad game design, yes. I mentioned the Occult neck as too easy to get for how good it is. I obviously think the same about the black mask. How is this a "gotcha" question, are you stupid?
---
Slayer helm is ridiculously OP, and causes people to do pretty much everything they can on task. Its the origin of slayerscape going way too far.

Can confirm rsmvs were my first introduction to music aside from the shrek soundtrack

Cause in my country they offer a ridiculous paychecks for engineers and im not willing to become a slave, so i prefer to do free lancer which i earn what they offer in 1 or 2 days. But the problem with freelance is the demand of customers.

Mobile uses absolutely no data, take it from someone who plays every single chance they get. It uses less than half of the data YouTube Facebook and my browser use, despite me using OSRS more. It does, however, make my phone very hot and kill the battery, and actually contributed to the death of my old Samsung Galaxy S6 (which was a piece of shit anyways).
---
Yes I know, but the point of this post is that OP found the dude with PID #1 on the server
---
That's like... the whole game
---
Ive heard this or ironman only worlds but the backlash is that it give unfair advantage to newer accounts who dont have to fight for the resources like people did in the past. I know skilling I almost never have an issue but I guess with bossing and PvM its more of an issue (im a skiller at heart almost never do bossing or PvM is just for slayer).

Remember, they already polled for MTX in OSRS and
---
##**ONE-THIRD**
---
of the playable said they'd be fine with it. With enough time 1/6 more players may become jaded enough and who's not to say a business would be fine with taking money from those who are loose with it.
---
What arrrows?
---
So.. full transparency. I botted in the past (less than a couple months ago) and botted for about a month before a ban on high level account. I'm not encouraging this but I'm calling you on your bullshit
---
WoW is a pretty bad example to use. The game quadruple dips on the customer by charging them for the base game, expansions, game time subscription and a fuck ton of MTX (arguably mainly cosmetic and time savers).
---
and how did you reach that conclusion?
---
Okay so i‚Äôm coming over from rs3( maxed and comped) and i just want a fresh experience. Should i just go with ironman for extra challenge or just start out as a regular account? Are there good guides/videos i can start out watching? What are good cc‚Äôs to join and ask questions if needed?

2. They haven‚Äôt made an official statement

osrs has been out for over 6 years. if u got 25k xp a day in a combat skill (aka about 20 minutes of slayer) you would be maxed combat.

not really sure what being able to kill a boss has anything to do with having or not having a life. good try though.

It's not that simple as the vast majority of game play is handled by the server. What we'll get is popular private servers attempting to imitate the game at a certain stage.

Banning 3pc won't do much more than cause an uproar on Reddit for a week or two. This game was at its most popular when they didn't even exist. You don't need them. Yes, they're way more popular than the official client but you can't assume that this means if they go the players will go. They use the 3pc to play a game they love playing and would continue to play on the official client if need be.
---
&gt; I don't understand all the construction hate in this sub
---
Because it's a skill that can't be trained by minimizing your client and ignoring the game for the majority of the time.

If they're under 20 wildy or in a pvp world, void and fcape "break". You have to pay to repair them to become usable. If you die passed 20 wildy, you lose them.

My personal favorite. The sacred clay tools were a blessing too

I am a semi-active official RS forum user, and /r/2007scape is like 10000% more active than the OSRS forums. And tbh, a lot of other unofficial forums are also probably more active. RS forums are pretty dead, discussion wise.
---
Ya more minigames and group bosses would be fun. Game's lacking group content to do with friends when you dont want to just grind.
---
Major inconvenience in game:
---
**JAAAGEEEX!**
---
yea you're right lol
---
It's still crappy
---
The text box is so huge no way to resize it , and you're spammed with every little drop worth 1k.
---
I usually have the text box closed on mobile becuz it takes up half the screen
---
/r/trees is that way üëà
---
It‚Äôs bad in terms of creating bigger divides within the community. 
---
Presently, time spent is the main limiting factor that creates subdivisions but when you add MTX, it‚Äôs usually the IRL wealthy that benefit. This can lead to new metas, less conventional play and odd breaches in lore (no explanation for purple skinned characters).  
---
Bonds work because it‚Äôs more of an alternative membership scheme (a lot of my CC benefit off of this as they can‚Äôt afford membership IRL)  and the gold conversion is typically pretty low. 
---
As others say, it can be more acceptable for cosmetics but it still creates a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what you could have if you had money‚Äù vibe. 
---
There are arguments for and against but it ultimately devalues the merit of so many achievements. I hope OSRS can resist.
---
100%, was contemplating life during the horrid grind and now the only teleports I ever need are home teleports. Your house becomes your new teleport hub and it‚Äôs fantastic.
---
Would a Dihns Bulwark be good for doing Chaos altar prayer training?
---
**My normal risk free method:**
---
* wearblack dhide chaps/chest and burning ammy
---
* bring 15 dragon bones
---
* tele into lava maze then run to chaos altar, hopping around if i see anyone
---
* suicide to the chaos dude when i run out of inv
---
with dihns I'd do the same thing, but bring full inv of dragon bones. I guess I'm wondering is how tanky does the shield make me? I would also be risking a lot more if I were to get smited
---
so if 200 million poor africans start playing runesape and fuck up the game its okay? No thanks, those countries ain't my problem.
---
Just range your other stuff dawg
---
The nezzy tele is also comparable to the crafting cape
---
It does for some tho
---
Lol even I managed to find that account. 99% sure its the correct account, because crystal math labs shows he had exactly 13,218,479 rc xp yesterday, the exact amount as he ends up on this video. Also magic xp matches.
---
There's never been confirmation that they can detect mouse movements. It's pretty unlikely though.
---
You still have to get the task to have any good chance of getting the jaw. Besides nezzy came from an even easier quest for free and was bis non-degradable already so I don‚Äôt wanna hear that dumb excuse.
---
Sounds like a good idea, I kinda wnat to get higher agility first for double cosmics but maybe i should get 59 RC first. (I'm at 50 currently)
---
Well yesterday i found a pvm brainlet telling in the ge to vot no on pvp polls cuz it will break the game
---
It will either way, it‚Äôs just prolonging the inevitable in favor of making the knights one of the worst tasks in the game lol.
---
Are you using a salve (ei)? What gear?
---
Dorgesh-kaanman mode?
---
i got one near 50, and then another one a kill later....
---
Yeah they changed it recently to be included in subscriptions man
---
I refuse doing a single herb run until i get it.
---
Clearly he didn't
---
You're right, I'm loving it so far!
---
No
---
I use Slayer Dart or Iban‚Äôs Blast against everyone, with the exception of Ahrim whom I range.  I tank damage (don‚Äôt pray) against Torag, Verac and Guthan.  I wait don‚Äôt turn on my prayer until I‚Äôve searched the tombs/until the brother in the tunnels appears.
---
I pray against Dharok, then Ahrim (might have to pot up during this fight), then Karil (if I didn‚Äôt pot up before I‚Äôm definitely having to here). Then I fight the rest of the brothers without prayer. I don‚Äôt pray against any monsters in the tunnels.
---
I‚Äôm by no means a pro, have base 70 melee stats, 80 mage and 77 range, 60 prayer. I use 1-2 prayer pots per run + a bunch of decent level food.  There are clearly more efficient methods and strategies, but this is one that I figured out myself and found easy enough.
---
Thank you!!

So what you're saying is you're a noob. And what I'm saying is I am not. And I just proved to you that a person doesnt need to no life to be maxed combat. You took it really personally for some reason. Noob isn't even a mean or offensive term.

holy fuck what a blast from the past haha

Why do you have a tampon on your camera?

Whats this now??

Ahh ok I‚Äôll keep that in mind. I saw everyone else using Ivan‚Äôs staff so I figured it would be useful then my friend told me to try and get it. I‚Äôve got a few quests to do before I can get Ibans staff. I‚Äôve got 63 magic and and 40 ranged I feel like I should raise my range a bit more before going again.

r/fashionscape may take this a little better. However, a not-unique fit wont get much attention...

---
It‚Äôs malicious and disrespectful.

Core gameplay is largely the same, but with a few new features like poison and special attacks. The majority of Membership is the new content, skills, and quests available
---
nezzy was released before they understood game design and how good gear should be introduced
---
Wonder if they‚Äôll remove the safe spots next week when they make them more difficult
---
Sorry but a BiS helm shouldn't come from an afk event. You can argue all you want that's bad game design.
---
It doesn‚Äôt really help that much. Once when I was cannoning dagannoths in the lighthouse on mobile I saw in the chatbox I got a snapdragon seed. With how slow the long press is to open the right click menu and how many items are on the ground, I never found it before it despawned.
---
How would you be risking a lot more if you got smited?
---
what the fuck

what about wheel of fortune and the treasure hunt thingy?

Not yet. They usually follow some time after release.

The Wiki drop rate project will provide an estimate shortly (if it hasn‚Äôt already). A couple of estimates have the jaw at 1/512 on task and 1/2,560 off task so far though.

Cooking is pretty fast and profitable

I don't really ever care about the lore in a game.

Why would you do that to yourself

Exactly. Just have fun playing the game lol

what the actual fuck

I normally never even get any herb drops worth putting in the sack, and any ranarrs i get I just throw in my inv cause i have a ton of space. Maybe I‚Äôll pay more attention next time though ur prob right

It's true though. Talking to oziach resets your rng. You get a new rng. Could be good could be bad.

Depends heavily on your cb stats. If your 110+ you should be able to solo them all if you know the techniques for each of them.

If your less stats you can go in a team. All you need is the drop in your name (most damage dealt).

I‚Äôd be happy to tank for you if you need help.

any goals youre working on?
---
Someone reminded me a week or two ago that I had this batch that needed to be bottled.
---
Rule of thumb for cacao nibs seems to be 2 weeks. I went ahead and waited like 120.
---
Started April 18, 2017.
---
12 pounds orange blossom  
---
12 pounds palmetto  
---
Water to 6 gallons  
---
Lalvin D47 yeast  
---
TOSNA 2.0 nutrient schedule (I believe)
---
After fermentation had stopped two weeks or so in, gravity was 1.012. Racked to secondary onto 8 ounces of cacao nibs.
---
Alright, that is the boring part out of the way. Now the interesting part of long term aging on nibs
---
- Two weeks into secondary the taste was extremely chocolatey. It also still had a bit too much alcohol burn for me to want to bottle
---
- Two months into secondary, the taste was just odd. Not much chocolate, almost all honey.
---
- Six months into secondary, the honey was completely overwhelmed by a "green" flavor. It was very much like drinking a vegetable. Carrots, specifically.
---
- 12 months into secondary, still vegetabley.
---
- 18 months into secondary, color starts changing from the yellow/light orange to a darker brown (noticable in the carboy, not so much the bottles shown)
---
- 30 months into secondary, color continued to get darker. Vegetable flavor completely gone. Flavor is heavily honey with a hint of chocolate on the exhale.
---
10/10 would make and forget about again.

I got rex pet on 135 and never even use it.
---
No worries dude either get me on here or my IGN is the same. Be happy to help
---
Commercial mead is pretty shit except Schramm's.
---
Homebrew is pretty good or pretty awful depending on about 200 different factors.
---
Just 1 kill is easy enough, you can regear for each one
---
This is literally the same shitfest from.2007 lmao, the bots spamming this spot was just as bad in F2P
---
They're not so bad, i did one for point boosting yesterday and only took me like 40 mins at most with a dhl in slash.
---
Yea maybe 2 tick. I have no clue on that. 
---
For the pools, one should go where you standing and the other 2 somewhere random near you, I guess.
---
2 and a half times over for any drop rate for pet. Oof.
---
/r/thathappened
---
The larger the sample size the closer it gets to not actually being random. That's how odds work

You had my ass till the 2017 part lmfao

why come you dont have a naem

Just wanna say if 3rd parties out and there's no immediate fix the game will never recover.

---
I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop lately, could someone explain me what lead to this controversy with 3rd party clients please?
---
Does OSRS have the threshold system like RS3?  If so shouldn't he have like a 1/1 chance of getting the pet?
---
I‚Äôve been wanting to try it for a bit of time now. I‚Äôm not an alcohol guy, so I‚Äôm asking: how‚Äôs the taste? If it tastes like wine, that‚Äôll be a no for me, but since it‚Äôs made of honey, I‚Äôm really curious. Homebrew is out for me, I don‚Äôt have the equipment, the money or the space for equipment.
---
You can. But that'll be wayyyyyy to sweaty.
---
I ducking love this community
---
I got pet on my 15th kc. Yet I'm dry of any magic fangs. Feels bad man
---
I read to 80% of the player base would quit and came to check this was a joke in the comments
---
I know, but that doesn't make it any less beautiful :D
---
I'm not a white or asian so how can I possibly be racist? Ignorant you are. Go away.
---
The warrior ring has far less drops
---
I'd vote yes just to watch the shitstorm.
---
Yes? It is the only logical conclusion to come to when you see the 1/512.
---
u tricked me hehe!
---
They will use mod ash as a false idol to push for microtransactions.

Don‚Äôt use a pc then u shitbag wtf

Thanks for the advice bud. Will grind some agility before learning money snake. Cheers.

They had me right up until 6ix9ine system haha

GZZ!!!!

Full obsidian armor is higher DPS than regular melee setups in Nightmare Zone and some other scenarios, but the whip and standard mid-level melee gear (neitiznot, torso, etc) are better for standard PvMing especially if you're doing slayer, as you'll want the black mask/slayer helm there. Full obsidian armor also requires the berserker necklace to be worth it, and you'll be spending more on all that stuff overall compared to just the whip.
---
The best way to start doing NMZ is to first do a hard rumble with an inventory full of prayer potions, in your best melee gear (whip + proselyte is very popular for this). After you get around 100-150k points, you can buy around 24 overloads and 100 absorptions and switch to the 1hp absorption method. If you have the Dream Mentor bosses enabled, you can get around 1 million points/hour doing a hard rumble with the right setup. If you don't, you can still get points quite quickly in NMZ, though you'll need to use the rock cake to stay at 1 hp as often as possible.
---
Thanks bud. Doubt I'll ever get that amulet so I'll just settle with damage increase.
---
It'd be quicker to tell you the negatives, cause there are none.
---
You need a larger sample to see the real effect.
---
Ty! :)

Thanks man!! The bots were annoying AF. I noticed alot of them have a - in thier name

So how could it be possible when some people are pet hunting and are well over the necessary kc( vorki is 1/3000 and some people are at 5000+ kills without it) with no pet.
---
Working towards 99 slayer atm I'll be there!
---
Lost me at 'enjoy themselves'.
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I think too. If you don't have those skills down, theres no way your going to be able to brute force your way through 60+ waves with mediocre skills and timing. If Jagex gave me a bulwark with the attack power of an acb I probably still wouldn't be able to beat the inferno.
---
I was going to ask what this was and then I read the comments
---
As with all good research, the best way to get started is by using [Wikipedia Super NSFW Image Alert!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futanari)
---
The way it works is every kill you have 1/512 chance to get the drop. It‚Äôs like every roll of a dice. 1/6 chance to get a 6 every roll.
---
&gt;you asshats frothing at the mouth, screeching
---
\*looks at wall of text\*  
---
Ok.  
---
I think you responded to the wrong person. It happens.
---
It would be funnier if it wasn't so true.
---
50/50 you either get one or you dont.
---
Lance is not only cheaper but recommended earlier in gear progression as far as CoX goes. If you're looking to raid to make money fast and get both this is a good option.
---
I'll be ur friend if u have discord
---
So true it‚Äôs funny, nice post you have my upvote.
---
The thing is that you are. The only waves that really rely on quick decision making and setting up flicks effectively are 60-63, the waves with mage/range/melee/blob together. You will probably get 1-2 easy spawns out of those, having 2-3 waves where you just brute force it. 
---
The other waves are much simpler as you just pray against the ranger from 17-35 and mager from 35-50, removing the biggest damage threats until 60+.
---
I've been grinding for 99 slayer since mobile came out, I'll be there.
---
same person tho
---
* MAC
---
* Full screen mode
---
* Slaying Nechryaels
---
This guy fucks.
---
Depends on the account.
---
Thanks for the detailed breakdown.
---
I have a bit of money saved up from Farming so will look into a set of Obsidian armour for NMZ. I think the imbues will make the cost worthwhile. I am not high enough combat for Dream Mentor yet, so I don't have those bosses, but will keep it in mind for when I do. I don't mind paying a bit more attention to rock cake down the HP or prayer flicking the rapid heal to reset the heal timer.
---
I'll get my dragon defender and 60 defence, then work on 70 attack for the whip in normal situations and grind out my strength at NMZ following that.
---
I appreciate your help, thanks again!
---
Trying to act elitist over seeing boss drops on the ground, which means you're still killing noob bosses rather than raids lmao.
---
How so? You just said if the drop is 1/512 it would be guaranteed
---
Torvesta shafted. feelsbadman
---
Obviously, but that was the amazing thing about it
---
Literally every menu swap is a 4:1 macro, including the dozens of RL ones. It being used for blackjacking or runecrafting changes nothing about that fact, and neither does the amount of people who use each client. If you think OSB client users are cheaters, then so are RL users, which would include yourself. 
---
We call this in the real world "being a massive, self serving hypocrite"
---
Pretty much. Don't think of it as one combined activity, think of it as doing a few things in sequence. You're first making money from daily battlestaves (around 75k with the hard diary, for example), then you're using that money to buy supplies for crafting, then you're choosing to alch air battlestaves instead of selling them on the GE. If you wouldn't normally want to train crafting, just sell the battlestaves immediately. If you don't feel like alching 60+ items, sell the air battlestaves after you make them.
---
If you aren't saying "XD" unironically, are you even *really* living the old school life though?
---
yeah but that's going to stay niche just because it's in wildy. I mean the more people flock to those supposedly good xp rate spots, the more pkers will those spots attract. Even if someone doesn't care about mild risk, they might care about having to waste time (= get less effective xp/h) running around instead of slaying
---
Imagine if it was cheap and BIS when attacking those with skulls. You could get brigades of people running around the wilderness hunting PKers.
---
Can you only kill him on tasks?
---
People in this game.
---
What content or bosses are you doing/interested in doing?
---
Yeah I think you over estimate people ability at the inferno. If you were right there would be A LOT more capes seen in game.
---
Thank you!
---
you profit bursting dust devils in catacombs
---
"So guys welcome back to my moneymaking new player f2p guide!"
---
So some requirements and recommendations, 80 herblore, 40 agility, 60 smithing and 40 fletching but you can do it with 35 fletching too.
---
So we're gonna do some boring click intensive hard focus no XP moneymakers, starting off with buying ge tracker premium and flipping which you can only do for about a day at a time, plus each flip costs 5 mil!
---
So guys I hope you enjoyed my easy and free moneymaking guide, hopefully you enjoy these now worthless moneymakers!
---
Its thanks to them I get free membership just buying bonds.
---
mate you dont need a fucking supercomputer to play runescape
---
&gt; I believe the entirety of this subreddit and the community will certainly come together to become a voice. I just hope it isn't in futility.
---
That's what r/runescape is doing right now. Surprise, surprise, it's going to be in futility.
---
We're not kids anymore. Any of us can have this game in the bag in no time.
---
Oof no thanks, bro.
---
At 100k per kill, you havent gotten anywhere near 800m profit.  Zulrah costs about 700 to 800k in supplies per hour.
---
Every menu swap is absolutely a 4:1 macro. Left click becomes a right click, nose movement down, left click, mouse movement up. That's all the blackjack plugin is doing, the same thing the ones you are comparing it to. 
---
So the 4:1 macros you use are fine, but the 4:1 macros on OSB are totally not fine? Go look like what hypocrite means buddy. You might even see your picture there as a visual aid.
---
Maybe the club gave them a bond and they are sharing the gp from selling it?
---
get this crap out of here, Le Door is that way kind gentlesirrrrrrrrr
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Lokar will really appreciate this
---
P2P feels like everyone is half iron man anyway. Some of us just get GE breaks and skip gathering. It really is that quiet.
---
Yeah, before I learned 'gal' is an English word, I figured it could be an acronym for 'Get A Life'. Needless to say, that never caught on.
---
I recall a friend of mine holding a monologue to me about how perfect the 'XD' smiley is. Some things should stay in the past lol
---
The real reson you'd be disabled then is not having alch value warnings on.
---
Did you read my post? I'm trying to do that quest rn lol
---
I meant 100k money made per kill, and i'm not even including uniques. Supply cost is far from 700-800k per hour my friend unless you are using dragon darts lol. I'll do the calc just for you but its far from that number in supply cost.
---
Jamflex
---
I have no clue either. Pls inform
---
Maxed tf out over here kid sit down.
---
Read it as ‚Äútrying to enter the abyss‚Äù. My bad aha
---
It‚Äôs a process to do now just with the extra +1 you need 120 str from the poh battle axe method why are you so confident üòÇ
---
Try tweeting a content developer on twitter
---
LUL DDS?! No wonder we cant get any content, PVMers are full fledged mouth breathers.
---
Nah, menaphos quest next please :D
---
No problem :)
---
More points doesn't really mean much, you're there for the firemaking xp which is faster with no Fletch. And you can get far faster Fletch xp other ways.
---
Another scaper in Boston??
---
ye the str bonus has increased quite a bit. New helm +3, avernic +2, Fero +2, Prim +1, cape +4 etc
---
Oh god I love this sub
---
For sure.  And even if it's 50% it only costs 7k to have a 50% chance to cure a 60k plant (if you have a decent magic level it's much higher than 50%)
---
Nice feet
---
It's just so ignorant to assume a tiny piece of game lore has been put in by "whites in the UK" for their own apparent racist views.
---
Ridiculous, what about the selection of many other types of slaves throughout Runescape; or do they go under the radar of your own deluded views.
---
You and me both, buddy.
---
"Here's my generic PvP video with 7 minutes of me showing the loot tab in my bank"
---
What Helium has to to with this?
---
Right now it‚Äôs like 25-30m risk to hit it.  
---
With turmoil it‚Äôs not as risky.
---
I‚Äôm really not though, I don‚Äôt get how you think I‚Äôm this is opinion based. 
---
Rs2 had plenty of mtx ruining it before becoming rs3. People are just leaving now because they‚Äôre finally fed up
---
I wonder what Dumbledore's fishing level is.
---
I'll give you a pet, i have 5 of each but no rings :D
---
I think a lot of their detection is within mouse movements - I assume there is a way for the ai to learn how to drag the mouse between different points in a more human way (rather than the instant clicks in the video)
---
Yeah I didn't think you had a counter argument.  you just want to ruin the game for everyone else for your definition of integrity
---
Not tried Ranged, though I found range quite competitive against others ranger because the ranging distance is very minimal. Melee'ing how ever allows you to venture out a bit.
---
Q
---
All it does is incentivize skulltricking and 3 iteming
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä FREE TORVESTA ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
i just thought melee was better all around with z hasta? btw i didn't even consider knives for some reason, i was using arma cbow with dragonstone dragon bolts (e) and after checking it on the dps calc rune knives are better AND cheaper, range doesn't matter that much unless you're competing with other people to tag but even then sometimes knives are better, so thank you man, really.
---
Hat is just too bright and doesnt work.
---
Is the power you gain from combat skill level ups linear or exponential? Like....will my damage and dps increase by the same amount from lvl 98 to 99 as it did from say 50 to 51? Or is 98 to 99 a larger increase in damage then say a lvl up at lower levels.
---
That's called being a child
---
Don't do chargeback, you will get banned
---
Had me pretty much upto jedmod. Cheers fir the lollz
---
:flushed:
---
After this many delays it would be fucking hilarious. Should do it anyway, and then release the real one after everyone loses it.
---
Windex
---
You didn't censor your godsword's bollocks, accessing you account now.
---
Your girlfriend is called iPad?
---
Well you're not getting ranger boots from hard clues rofl
---
what quest is this?
---
Not to mention they 100% can tell what client people are using
---
Can't effectively or fairly ban buyers anymore. Jagex now allows indiscriminate account interaction, and almost don't even give a shit if you account share as long as you aren't competing as two people.
---
&gt;People are just leaving now because they‚Äôre finally fed up
---
The implication here is that previous levels of MTX didn't ruin the game, but the now excessive levels did. That's the point I'm getting at.
---
I got mine around 160 kc on task (had done 60 off task as well)
---
In aid of myrque I think, or at least one of those in that questline.
---
Ok buddy
---
89 for Varrock. I did platebodies using Priff anvil. Wasn‚Äôt terrible. Great to do on mobile
---
Goodluck getting lvl 71 so you‚Äôre tears can go on rc
---
I dunno what you expect out of a master quest?
---
Go get a quest cape, and most of the quests in the game aren't as good as the ones you listed. Not to mention you neatly skipped over SotE, DS2 and MM2 which are probably the three best quests in the game.
---
It sucks for sure haha
---
definitely 1/512 - 1/1000 on task then! somewhere in that range
---
Going to one-up you here, I got it at 1 KC. I had to check the wiki to make sure it wasn't a guaranteed drop.
---
Okay Beyonc√©, relax no need for a performance!
---
I thought he would be streaming new quest, and got a clue done in nezzy
---
I save afk tasks for mobile so I can sit with my girlfriend while she plays xbox and when she‚Äôs at work I play on my pc
---
what's driven up the prices?
---
Besides pvp there is no risk. You have an hour to get back to almost any boss and that's if they don't just keep and save your items for you. It's a joke.
---
jagex remove all 3rd party clients except the communities favorite client runelite unless you're going to hire runelite devs to fix your trash official runescape client.
---
I WAS ABOUT TO SLAP SOMEONE TO NEXT WEEK
---
This is wild
---
One thing to note, if you get the Iban's staff, upgrade it to 2.5k charges and don't pay the 250k to recharge it, you can run through the pass and charge it yourself for free (took me less than 10 minutes to get through).
---
Lol its Josh Peck from the vlog squad
---
If this post gets 500 upvotes I'll giveaway a bond to the funniest joke in the replies to this comment.
---
He should always be in the wilderness just north of edgeville, even if you aren't at the right moment in the miniquest. He just refuses to talk to you. 
---
You aren't in a free world right? That's all that I can think of for him to not be there
---
Now with the demon in bondage
---
I am in a free world, I'm a f2p, is the quest members only?
---
Honestly the shit graphics we have is a circumstance of 2007. If they brought a 2008 backup instead, I‚Äôd be totally happy.
---
This is fantastic
---
Not worth much without the bank pin.  Don't worry, I triangulated it from his angler fish
---
Should have put the fishing trawler hat on him lmaol
---
I honestly thought this was a joke till I read your replies lol
---
 smittywerbenjagermanjensen  3: electronic jubilee
---
She looks like Lisa Ann
---
Don't you just about break-even from all the other loot anyway, and getting Ranger's is just the profit side of the whole thing...
---
Not sure, ive been doing solo ToB for over a month now, 25KC in decided to test my skill. This is the hardest thing ive done in any video games ever and probably ever.
---
my current total xp 21m C\_C
---
You should use Steve if you specifically want demonic gorillas on task. Steve has the highest chance of assigning them
---
What did he say, the little cunt deleted it
---
Look, just make the damn client optimized enough for me to not use another client that actually runs well.
---
jagex needs to hire you!! Don‚Äôt let negative clowns put you down this is a fantastic idea and instead of complaining you actually acted proactively! Well done !!!
---
Can't wait for Jmod smackdown.
---
NGL, with how badly Jamflex fucks up I actually thought this might be a real at first.
---
When I did 99 prayer I used Karils top, Dinh‚Äôs bulwark and enchanted symbol for suiciding. As well as tele with burning ammy. That‚Äôs what I found was fastest xp/hr with smallest risk
---
Oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm confused then I guess. How‚Äôs that related to the lumbridge tasks?
---
Edit: oh shoot. Let‚Äôs you not use the ring without a staff
---
Neat ty for putting in the effort to share this. Makes me want to try it.
---
same
---
My rng is 3.6. Not good, but not terrible.
---
lumby elite lets you use fairy rings without a dramen staff
---
I used addy arrows
---
because elite lummy lets you use fairy rings without lunar staff
---
1) he could be wearing metal ankle bracelets, not necessarily chained shackles. And standing on the edge is probably so that he can be standing but also provide details of the feet. 
---
2) you're right about the back wall. It should either be darkened all the way down or if kept light, the details of the bricks should be lightened so that it looks like fog creeping up the wall
---
Nice meme and fuck you :)
---
Yeap! I think I can slow down the mouse movements or make it more random too for future videos. But I'm not sure if there is data out there to allow us to simulate human mouse movements, it'd be pretty interesting though, maybe we'd have to feed it our own data too. 
---
As for this video, I just wanted to click on cows as fast as possible. So I guess I didn't put too much thought into getting bill banned lol
---
I was able to get 15 skills to level 99 before I got bored of RS3. All I was doing was bossing for money so I could buy supplies for skills that I hate.
---
Pureseb has already hit the 48-48 in pvp.
---
good advice. yes ill always be playing both accounts at once
---
What is the 50 con for? I'll probably throw some cash from the main to  get 70 prayer and 82/83 con eventually but not immediately
---
and what is the best way to get 70+ ranged?
---
Rs3: flies forward and normal 
---
Osrs: literally flies ass first for peak performance.
---
Yeah fuck me for playing the game the way the developers intended and not looking for every shortcut I can amirite?
---
This game is sooo sad but just like you im in it too. God help us all. Amen.
---
No, his girlfriend is an iPad.
---
Is that pose a reference to Magician from the House of the Dead games? If so then that's pretty bangin
---
&gt;nechs and dusties 
---
is clearly 2 examples
---
you can also barrage abby demons, and no one really bothers but bloodvelds too.
---
brutal black dragons are camped off task
---
In case of failure, apply memes.
---
regardless, my main concern is the overcentralization of dozens of monster types in one area. The same thing that was wrgong with Nieve‚Äôs cave. Whatever has to be done to keep the balance/sacrifice that you‚Äôre talking about can be implemented as such.
---
It literally says permanent ban ? üòÇ
