and how is a time gated bad when EVERYONE can get it for free later on?  you guys cherry pick way to much.
---
---
---
I legit cant be fucked...
---
I hate this 'gamers are entitled' attitude. You wouldn't get it in any other consumer industry. I might not own the company, but I'm a paying customer. If the game changes in a way I don't like, I will stop giving them my money. If the company says they might change in the future I have every right to express my discontent. If the company LITERALLY ASKS MY OPINION, I am not entitled for talking about how much I hate the idea of adding microtransactions. 
---

---
Of course it's in their rights to do whatever the fuck they want to the game. That doesn't mean I'm supposed to shut up and keep shoveling my 11 dollars into the fire. I get to get mad. I get to hate microtransactions. I get to be an unsatisfied customer. I get to make crab memes.
---
I don't understand what you even want. Should we just be happy with whatever Jagex allows since we don't own the game and never express an opinion? If we did that OSRS literally would not exist. This game is only here because we demanded a return to form after RS3. End of the day they might own the game. But we are the customers, and 'the customer is always right'.
---
Couple years back they had these God-themed flat brims... Some sold out in less that 48 hours and needed a double restock if the blog posts from that time are to be believed. I still rock my Zaros one. Would pay double for my boy Guthix...
---
bonds do nothing for jagex... are you serious?
---
&gt;It's that high because the proposed changes were fine themselves. It just sets a precedent. If you didn't think beyond this singular poll, you'd probably vote yes as well.
---
Exactly; if this poll was being conducted by a more trustworthy company than Jagex and/or if we didn't know what had happened with RS3, then there would be a much higher ratio of Yes votes.
---
i agree that exp lamps and eoc was bad, how does cosmetic equal that?
---
That's exactly what profit means tho. Profit=total revenue-expenses. The 41m is how much they had leftover after covering all costs
---
Question, assuming he was doing elder chaos druids, how in the hell did he manage to get pked? Its under 20 wild so surely you hover over a tele at all times or do pkers log in and insta teleblock or something?
---
Yes there is. They're like $40
---
nope it's still there
---
It's never enough for MBAs. They corrupt everything they touch.
---
dude where is the TL:DR at?
---
How about you shut the fuck up? You didnt play runescape back in 04 05, 06, 07 and onwards up until they ruined the game alot of us had sunk the better part of our youth grinding out skills and memories. It's obvious that you didnt play back then because you were fucking dumb enough to type the shit you did. This is in no way an overreaction from the LOYAL playerbase, this is us standing our ground and holding jagex to its promises that they made when we got enough votes to get our tiny fucking dev team to make OSRS a thing. Osrs wasnt given the time of day when it passed a poll, it was treated as a joke by jagex, they gave us barely enough devs to keep the bugs at bay. And now after all these years of putting our time and love into THE SAME game that they fucked up before, they try to pull the same shit, but this time we can fight back against it. 
---
So take a second before typing your MTX sympathizing bullshit, you have no idea the pride we take in our game. You probably jump between games weekly, we stay for years and years most of us logging in daily to see our friends and play this game we love. Join us in guarding this garden of eden or shut the fuck up and be thankful somone else had the balls to do it for you.
---
I think everyone just used all their memes they had saved for years. Now when the real MTX poll comes we have no OC to use against it
---
The original poll questions didn't mention that the cosmetics would be earned through partnership deals.
---
They were simply listed like "Do you want X to be in the game?"
---
I wish, I have some of the same issues? But this is the community that laughed at the idea of a ‚Äúdrop all‚Äù function in the inventory (mods even ridiculed the idea on q&amp;a) and would be upset that ‚Äúwell I had to drop a million fish 1 by 1, fucking ezscape babies ruining the game‚Äù and so on and so on.  I wouldn‚Äôt hold out much hope.
---
Not a fan of scuffed venenatis?
---
it does, everything is still mostly the same as it was 15 years ago
---
Lockheed Martin, British Petroleum, S.P.E.C.T.R.E, Peoples Republic Of China, etc.
---
Standard fare really
---
Dude my source is myself you could sign up for a Twitch Prime trial and link it to OSRS and acquire the purple skin all for paying $0, so next time instead of downvoting me because you're an idiot you should know what you're talking about.
---
How about the vanilla client? That sounds like a block on the network. Firewall settings changed?
---
Nah bro, I just don't like racists. No matter what color their skin is.
---
Oh i understand companies want to make more money at whatever the cost. Doesnt mean we should let them.
---
Facts
---
I have, you just don't like the answer. It is my opinion that partnerships are a slippery slope leading to mtx
---
Good bot.
---
They literally just tried to...
---
41million doesnt include whatever the chinese overlord take away from Jagex.
---
Mom said it‚Äôs my turn to repost this
---
Guilty by association
---
I didn't look at the figures myself, but usually they include rs3 subs, osrs subs, as well as a number for mtx. Mtx also includes bonds from osrs, so the numbers aren't completely representative of how much each makes.
---
Can we get a pol to get the EA guys fired?
---
[removed]
---
This year's report sinply split income between osrs and rs3 not anymore sub vs mtx
---
Personally I've been playing a fair amount of other games recently just because of burnout from bring dry on my dwh grind. The played time doesn't really justify 11$ but I have more than enough gold stocked up to buy a bond whenever I do feel like playing.
---
When classic wow comes out theres no way I'd play enough to sub outside of bonds.
---
Thanks. I saw in another post that its a real jagex address. Looks so fake tho.
---
ü¶Ä ü¶Ä JMODS WONT RESPOND TO THIS ü¶Ä ü¶Ä
---
I mean, the purple skin was unpolled content iirc, i see no reason why they wouldnt try something similar again.
---
"Disruptive Behavior"
---
That's a bunch of lies, now excuse me while I complain on reddit how this marks the start of MTX and will kill the game
---
I've been away for a couple months. Can someone bring me up to speed on what's going on?
---
Why the fuck would you be okay with product placement in quests in a game you PAY a monthly subscription for lmao?
---
Ya with that release looming it‚Äôs easier to leave RuneScape for another nostalgic MMO. Or I‚Äôll just go back to the games I was playing before hoping on OSRS.
---
This is when a 9 year old tries to act smart.
---
No, every question were very clear about the partnership part. See below.
---
*Question #1:
---
Should we add a new player-owned-house house style decoration, themed on the Morytania region? It would be added as described in the blog - first released with a partnership, before being released to all players at a later date.*
---
No. It's different in OSRS than in RS3. We can poll for all MTX while RS3 cannot. We can just vote no for all MTX that crosses the line instead of overreacting with a zero MTX tolerance policy.
---
100%. Almost as if they‚Äôre like ‚Äúwe know you want what we‚Äôve offered and we know better than you‚Äù. Or making out that not accepting partnerships is baffling and we‚Äôve ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù. Lmao.
---
- Prospector outfit is a requirement along with 60 mining for the Falador hard diary
---
- Gem bag is handy for slayer and mining
---
- Coal bag is handy for smithing and mining
---
That analogy doesn't make sense
---
Scrolled to bottom couldn't find one so I'll add it. TL:DR: This is a rant no one bothered to read and will probably forget about before they finish reading this comment.
---
It seems to actually be a legit email this time but I think it's safer to just literally ignore every runescape related email or atleast never click a link from one. It's always best to just check the message centre on the official site by manually going to it and logging in yourself.
---
August Drama Calendar: "We have decided that seeking parterships classifies as an integrity change, but we appreciate your input in last month's poll."
---
&gt; The original poll questions
---
Originally they were not phrased as such. It was only after people complained about how misleading they were that they were changed.
---
Yeah I feel bad for Settled not getting his referral code partnership out of this haha
---
As a way for them to accept a partnership while having an incentive for new content for us.
---
Track record of another dev team and another ceo. Actually, I think the only person that's working today on osrs that also was back then is mod ash.
---
I trust this dev team way more than the rs2 team, so I don't quite buy it, myself. I respect people wary of it though.
---
CEO's making too much doesn't mean the same thing as devs getting mistreated. And you need to realize, devs cost a company a ton more than their salary. The overhead for the benefits, office space, equipment, software, etc, can be way more than the cost of their salary. And more devs means more HR, IT, and so on.
---
Knowledge is power. Read.
---
Jagex isnt worth billion dollars. Maybe half a billion.
---
Jagex: 30% of players support MTX!
---
Investors: It's free real estate!
---
I want to earn cosmetics. I dont understand why it would be cool to get them through partnerships. Devalues cosmetics gained by clues and also makes future content harder to make due to potential rewards being taken die partnerships deals
---
That‚Äôs actually good to know, I‚Äôll try that next time.
---
Scyth is trash.
---
Release the Crabs
---
I heard one person get angry about Jsgex putting Hatius Cosaintus in Lumbridge, he basically said, "Don't ruin my childhood."
---
The wild was removed when several governments threatened to pull Jagex's right to accept credit card transactions from within their borders due to the prevalence of stolen card info being used by botters. It came back when they got better tools to fight botters.
---
HOW DOES PURPLE SKIN DEVALUE YOUR MUTAGEN
---
Remain vigliant. It's safest to send and firm and clear message, even if the osrs team don't want mtx.
---
perfectly balanced
---
So I have to walk away seems smart u must be a bigger lol
---
Source on this? I have a hard time believing the polls started out this way but if they did that is blatant bullshit.
---
Lol only cus u don‚Äôt have one syth wins every time
---
it introduced a purple skin. Nobody gave a fuck because it was basically a free month of membership for everyone, the only draw-back was the bots.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Introducing poh styles, teleport styles, emotes is a whole different beast than a purple skin promo.
---
yea no thanks, bosses are already full and crashed now you want to limit the player base and compete against up to 10k people?
---
Purple skin specifically doesn't, but if purple skins OK, then why not orange? If orange is OK why not maybe recolor other things? Like popular items? This is what one would call a slippery slope
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!!!
---
üòÇü§£ wut
---
I know im in the minority here but hear me out..
---
I honestly dont get why we are bashing Jagex so hard over this. Ive read the blogposts and theyre being very transparant on everything. They understand we dont want mtx in the game and are just trying to find ways to keep the game growing and keep the playerbase happy. 
---
I simply dont get whats so wrong about some cosmetic changes that doesnt affect gameplay in any way at all. Yet reddit is acting like they proposed buyable xp or something. 
---
I get that most people think this is the first step to bigger impacting mtx changes like in rs3. But remember that we now have the poll system and that Jagex clearly cares about our votes. So shit like what happened to rs3 will most likely never happen to osrs. Jagex knows they fucked up back then, and how I see it is that they are really trying to keep the game growing while still keeping all players happy. 
---
Maybe im missing something, but tbh i think reddit is really overreacting on this partnership thing
---
Nice repost
---
&gt; We will more than likely be down this road again because I‚Äôm sure the new owners of Jagex aren‚Äôt going to just let this go without pushing every possible option for more revenue and growth.
---
I forgot the point of buying a company is to slowly let it bleed out and die.  Partnerships dont necessarily have to involve MTX as we have seen with free membership.  But there will have to be a middleground between that and MTX because free membership isnt sustainable.
---
To add to this, I'll expand on why O voted no.
---
The mods themselves acknowledged in the blog that cosmetics work best when they show off accomplishments. If the partnership cosmetics are available to everyone after a period of time, they're worthless, and worthless cosmetics just dilute the value of good cosmetics. See RS3 for an example there - ever other person has a worthless rainbow dragon pet.
---
If the partnership cosmetics were locked behind an a genuine achievement - either a new one or an existing one like Diaries - I would have maybe been able to vote yes, even with the timed exclusivity.
---
maybe, maybe not. do the clue and find out
---
We want cool things in the game Jagex, we just don‚Äôt like umbrella terms like partnership.
---
nope
---
rcb and broads is the go-to gear for ironmen so that might be why you see it a lot, addy+ arrows are relatively hard for them to get early game
---
&gt; Too bad the old-school team doesn't get the final say on what happens. The suits do.
---
Wrong.  The community has the final say as anything like this will be polled.  That statement will only be true the day they overrule a poll but until then the community is still in charge.
---
Well it has shit drops and any decent ones are being farmed to shit by maxed mains. People are saying to just wait a few days but they‚Äôll still be there crashing people to hunt a lame ass pet.
---
The writer‚Äôs tone seemed very shitty. This is an amazing comparison
---
agreed. zulrah is mad boring. If mutagens weren't a thing I'd never do it over vorkath.
---
Both sides of this discussion are fair, imo. In game loot shouldn‚Äôt ever be locked behind a transaction elsewhere (not even temporarily), but if I‚Äôm getting a free month of membership for being subbed to something else that already costs more than the membership? Sounds fine to me.
---
Forget about the bots, that purple skin looks so fucking stupid and has no place in the game
---
Yeah its there pretty much every day
---
Of course they talk like that. Nearly every time the subreddit freaks out like this it's because the community is thick as fuck.
---
Remember how the community reacted to the pride event?
---
This is honestly embarrassing. Jagex have said multiple times they were NEVER going to add any pay to win type deals BEFORE the poll started, and then the Reddit train started. I've said it again and I'll say it again; cosmetics are simply cosmetics, they do NOT change how the game is played.
---
How embarrassing.
---
I just want to say that I do use bonds but not to sell. I buy bonds when I‚Äôm just looking to play for a short amount of time or if I‚Äôm not sure how much time I‚Äôll have to play. Saves a bit of money in the long run. That being said, no I literally wouldn‚Äôt care if they were gone.
---
They literally stated previously that squeal of fortune would never give xp and 2 months later reversed there statement. Yall are just ignorant theres literally tons of proof jagex lies about this shit. If you choose to ignore it that's on you
---
No. I do not think they‚Äôre capable of learning from their mistakes. They are still coming out with new MTX promos all the time for, and 
---
They also held f2p hostage to get bonds to pass a vote. Whether you like them or not for the good they do to the economy and availability of membership, they‚Äôre still P2W MTX items.
---
Cosmetic MTX is a big deal. It's a stepping stone to normalize the concept of MTX and get their foot into the door. It's unnecessary given the way the game is developed and funded and it's the exact model and progression that was used to force mtx back in rs2. To act as if it is not a natural red flag given we've already been through the implementation and as a result can see all of the warning signs clearly is naive and I question whether you were around for the first go round.
---
It's also problematic to the game as a whole. This is a game where cosmetics mean something and can take a seriously long time to get. That can be a serious negative to peoples experience in the game alone having that come from mommys credit card.
---
What are you trying to get at? What is it you're doing? I've gotten 87 magic with 90% done with noncombat methods (or splashing which gives no hp xp).
---
nice
---
Ew weebs
---
This. With the outrage from Jagex explaining reasoning behind partnerships, and how much support that one guy got who "was banned for killing a streamer" this sub just seems to jump on every possible reason to hate jagex. 
---
Jamflex bad, swampman good is one step away from overtaking EA bad, geraldo good in popularity
---
Not exactly, people didn‚Äôt want to see the vote BEFORE they had voted as it persuaded you just to vote with the majority. No harm done in showing results AFTER you‚Äôve voted
---
Yikes dude.  
---
He literally just said that the Purple skin was a twitch prime promo that then became free to everyone a month later. He never said it cost anything. He simply stated that it took a month before it became avaliable without any barriers.  
---
You got downvoted because your comment read as if it was avaliable to anyone, without doing anything from the start.  
---
Also, A TON OF PEOPLE already have done their twitch prime trials, so it would require a new twitch account, amazon account, and linking Runescape account again if you want it "free" from the start.
---
What are you talking about?
---
It's optional, it would only take up 5 or so worlds from our current list, in the explanation I put that as a con and you likely wouldn't want to be bossing or doing certain activities there.
---
Yeah if it were done right I'd totally have no problem paying for expansions. But like you said it would have to be good content, not what zeah turned out to be. Fuck maybe even timegating expansions, like for 6 months you can purchase it for $20, the next 6 months it drops to $10, and after a year it's free to everyone. 
---
I'd rather it not be that way, but I wouldn't be upset if this was their alternative to mtx.
---
I actually think they handled the MTX thing well. They floated the idea to the community (imo with good intentions), it got shit on in the polls and they said ‚Äúokay then we won‚Äôt do this‚Äù.
---
Yeah the having more money to hire actual customer support and add more developers to release more quest and other updates to the game is s real issue stop being such a tinfoil hat lunatic
---
This is the exact type of thread jagex should be focused on. They asked for our ideas here we are. Give a discount or free membership. Hell, offer only NEW and RETURNING players with inactive accounts a free month. Advertise other companies on the RuneScape website. Announce tournaments as being sponsored by .....
---
Have special themes minigames for one weekend brought by sponsors. 
---
But do NOT try to sell me on MTX.
---
Yeah and i dont see it as damaging to the game as long as everyone is able to get it afterwards
---
I'm sure a company that has failed once knows a lot more than random redditors...
---
You know damned right that wanted them to be a non profit would never ever happen. That's a ridiculous idea and you know it.
---
buying bonds at low levels is a terrible waste of time. You spend all your work getting GeePees and never advance
---
Yeah its pretty lame, i'd give him 10k max
---
I could see someone wanting it bad in actual 07 tho lmaoo
---
Exactly. I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre so gun-ho for in-game partnership content. Explore the more obvious avenues first. Stop being pussies about it.
---
All the new players that mobile brought in are leaving because they're realizing how awful this game and its community is.
---
&gt; devouer
---
alch yourself
---
They didn't cancel the poll, they ended it early. Which means it did fail.
---
Imagine if they got more money without having to charge us so they could hire more devs and people for customer support to improve the quality of life for the player base but rather than that this sub will complain about things that can be fixed by having money to employ more people
---
‚ÄúWe did it boys MTX is no more.‚Äù
---
Yeah I know, but they are typically used for saving a boss kill streak/saving a failed kill on rax/telos. It sounds super OP, but it's not like people are buying them in Mass to get free loot, I think you can get 1 every couple days from a traveling merchant for 5m cash
---
Hahaha, you're actually right
---
LOL you couldn't pay me to use that name
---
Why not big brawler
---
You‚Äôre right. But you should definitely care why it failed, and not just that it failed. Otherwise we‚Äôre moving the wrong direction
---
Void ranger for pking or a Zulrah or rune dragon alt
---
Maybe someone is looking for an older, "outdated" name, sort of like Mabel.
---
Why is there a stigma against making profit here? If Jagex made no profit at all there wouldn't be a game to begin with. If you have an issue with how they try to create those profits, then fine, complain about that. But let's stop making it out to be "hur dur all corporate profits are bad". It's nonsensical.
---
Idk why but I never found zulrah difficult
---
Just sell me some skillcape hoodies.
---
Can't say I know one, I haven't been too active in RSPS for a couple years. There are communities with toplists for such things though, Rune-Server being one example. But if they fuck OSRS up like they did RS3 then there's definitely going to be more interest in it and more servers popping up.
---
Wilderness
---
I disliked the part where they said the community was fine with cosmetics. Uh, no we're not?
---
I was there when they ruined rs2. But its two different things. Rs2 devs didnt require the consent of player base to make changes tot he game. Here they do.
---
I have one. Actually pretty comfortable. Tho as low as it is it's obviously not for gaming setups
---
I'm going to go ahead and ask the question everyone knows the answer to apparently. Why are partnerships bad? I, for one, don't mind free cosmetic loot.
---
Why downvote me all I did was explain the joke
---
These two pets could be obtained by exchanging points or as a random reward after successful matches.
---
You're come off really ungrateful saying that, Jagex is a one of a kind company.
---
The Devs all love their job and love their community, any other company would of filled this game with MTX from the start.
---
Oh shit I totally forgot about the chrome goggles, and they conveniently prove my point that partnered sponsored cosmetics came before SoF
---
still traumatized by rs2 turning into spins and eoc, surely the mods can understand why people didn't like the partnership idea
---
Yeah I'm at 8.5k dry pet üò≠
---
Got 900k from hard today. Considering time it took to finish yeah
---
That last part at least is why I voted no, I would have been happy with the stuff as it was polled but this is exactly how the monetisation started with rs3 and I can't trust that they won't continue down that path
---
Hilarious how they seem to think they know whats best for the game. All you need to do is look at RS3 and you can see what happens when Jagex are allowed to make their own decisions.
---
Left to their own devices, Jagex will kill this game as they did before.
---
Idk man id say that for a new and appealing game. But the problem with osrs is the old graphics and mechanics. That puts us at a big disadvantage when it comes to attracting new young players.
---
A Friend putting that gambling money to good use.
---
I‚Äôve never commented on any RuneScape community reddit post, but the fact that the entire community and company is so transparent brings me to tears üò≠ I have never felt so emotionally attached to a community and a company that has such clear conversation about the future of the game. It is so happy how both company and community can come together to decide the future of the game. This is honestly the future of every game regardless of genre, can progress. It requires both the community and the company to progress a game into the state we are now. I ask that every company that sees this shitty little post to take inspiration in what jagex offers us. Transparency in the company and transparency in the community.
---
Thank you for your service
---
30% of players wanted new content and didn't mind paying for it. They're the same people who shell outs hundreds of bucks on loot boxes. 
---
Why work for something when you can buy it? They equate real world effort with in-game effort. They worked hard for that money so why not spend it and on in-game things to show off? That's sort of the logic. At least for some. Others just have really bad spending problems. 
---
And they need to be ignored. These people don't care about the longevity of the game. They just want instant gratification. And once they have everything thing three days of paying for it they'll get bored and move on. 
---
The entire point of a monthly membership fee is to remove the need for shit like this. It's kind of insulting Jagex is even trying to pull this stunt.
---
You don't get the reference do you?
---
You should be thanking us for saving this game from your own stupid decisions once again. Have you not learnt anything from RS3?
---
Instead we get this passive aggressive ‚Äòapology‚Äô. You all need to step back and realise your higher-ups or whoever tried to push this bullshit are clueless about OSRS‚Äô population.
---
I am the girl with the love letter, and the person I want to give it to is Auenke but I am too shy and low self esteem because I have nothing of value to give to Auenke so I will now be sad instead
---
Idk, his other options are mining and wc?
---
Who writes these things? It sounds like it was written by a stakeholder or something.
---
Seung-gi aint white or rich
---
I played RS3 a little back and it completely makes sense for MMORPGS nowadays to have cosmetics but it ruined the fact for me when I couldn't see what people were wearing - that was part of the fun of the game.
---
Rs3 Player Here.....Good Job on winning the first battle.....but I hope yall OS players don't think you've won the war...They be sneaky and it'll come again MTX always comes again.......\*stares into the distances\*
---
I really do not understand why the partnership thing is a big deal. I‚Äôm seriously not being a dick, I‚Äôm just curious. Isn‚Äôt the twitch prime thing with purple skin an example of a partnership? What was wrong with that? It was just an addition to the game that was purely cosmetic
---
 Nice
---
Yeah I get you're making fun of the guy which is old news
---
range level is fine (90 plus is always better tho) but I'd get magic up to 94ish for vengeance, but obviously any range/magic level will result in faster kills so if you're looking to sesh it 90 plus range/mage is ideal
---
I don't know if it's too much to ask, but why don't they keep the game and their marketing separated?
---
Raise prices a but and allow multiple toons per account pls.
---
The Binds analogy is good and bad, good because it's exactly what it did, but bad because it ended up being fantastic for the game.
---
Ha ahrim job
---
HODL BOYS
---
MTX was not ‚Äúbeing pushed on us‚Äù. 
---
It was polled, and it massively failed. They politely asked us if we wanted it, we declined, they didn‚Äôt push the issue.
---
you are going to get downvoted to hell bringing up 1t prayer, these guys think that because the engine is dogshit that it should stay even though it does break certain bosses and activities in the game.
---
Mod Sweden commented that it's hard to justify dev time for cosmetics like that given it isn't something that draws people back to the game or draws them in.
---
Lmao
---
LMFAO
---
Deal
---
Well luckily I just completed MM2, so maybe I should spend some time bursting those monkies
---
Thanks!
---
Jagex looking good in that twitch prime jumpsuit
---
So you mean you are a failure.
---
There's really no point to partnerships. Even if all you need to do is go to a partner's website for free to get an item/cosmetic in game, those items/cosmetics should be earned, not given out.
---
That yelling was the audio equivalent to @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
---
Not anymore. Don‚Äôt have a link for you rn but OSRS recently eclipsed RS3 in revenue
---
sexart
---
I use mantas cause vorkarth drops them quite consistently and I generally don't worry about money cost of food when I'm making over 1m/hour
---
thats because you smoking the inventory
---
Was this taken before or after they kissed
---
Dont care about upvotes, just a discussion.
---
Dev cost is already included in that, they aren't taking anything away from Jagex' salaries, it's just the left overs.
---
&gt; Why is there a stigma against making profit here?
---
For me, I don't care how much money they make. I'm all for making money. Biggest free market capitalist libertarian out there. 
---
I just don't want them to sellout their game that we love for profits.
---
Whether you think it's valid or not, the sensitivity of this sub makes a lot more sense when you understand the context.  When MTX were first introduced to Runescape, Mark Gerhard (the CEO at the time) promised that the MTX would never be anything more than cosmetic only.  Over time, the MTX devolved into the squeal of fortune (later turned into treasure hunter), and more and more time and resources were allocated to MTX promotions rather than game content.  The result: a cesspool of pay-to-win MTX at the cost of the regularity of non-MTX updates.  This status quo of RS3 has cost Jagex enormous amounts of trust with the player base, and it's understandable why people are upset at the possibility of going down this road again.

This would have been so much better if it wasn't anime and you just drew your own style for hair and faces.
---
You do know Jagex was recently bought by an American company tho, right?
---
At least they are polling the end of OSRS, other companies would skip polls.
---
I found my kph increased once you got mid 90s range/mage and venged the mage form, gl my man

Rot

I mean they killed every single game they ever developed runescape included. Hell they even purchased sucessful indie games with a ton of potential and immediately killed them due to their awful decision making. Their most popular game is a decade old reboot of game they killed once already.
---
It's not even like the games are dying because of interest in the genre dying or people aging out of the game. It's always overnight changes that result in huge amounts of people quitting the game all at one time.
---
So *this* is where Dovydas has been!

"It's difficult. We know you want stuff like house styles, but purely cosmetic rewards are hard to justify in terms of developer cost. If it's part of a partnership then the dev cost is offset." - Mod Sween commenting under the original partnership poll post.
---
Well it depends on what a partnership really means.  For example, I'm fine with Jagex making efforts to advertise the game (it's necessary for healthy in-game demographics/economies), but such advertisements should not be in the form of promotions that affect in-game content in any way.
---
Like? Veracs is only good when their def is absurdly high, which isn't many places... Especially not this spider.
---
For the penalty of misusing this meme, you are condemned to only watch the final season of "The Office" and you can only be sympathetic to Andy.
---
seriously... iean come on, jagex was reporting record profits a while back iirc, yet they are suddenly pleading poverty? that is pretty absurd.
---
Ok listen 
---
Partner with *GORDON RAMSAY* to make the RFD dishes

I'll take my paycheck with the 20 zeros jagex thank you very much
---
Even though you may be right about the slippery slope fallacy, I didn't feel like the given "rewards" would really draw players to the game in the first place. The most interesting stuff they offered were player house themes, and construction is one of the last skills a new player would be concerned with.
---
Osrs will die eventually, but MTX is not what kill it. China men in black suits will.
---
Hi,
---
I've been off RS3/OSRS (I play both, more focused on RS3 recently) for a while, and recently have been hearing about this huge OSRS MTX dumpster fire. Obviously MTS in RS3 was a pain, but has it gotten a lot worse recently? That's the way it sounds, judging from what I've read. Is there MTX in OSRS now, or did polls keep that from happening? I'm really confused about the whole thing and would love some clear answers.
---
\-A fellow 'Scaper.
---
Psh, heroin is better,.. pussy.
---
OK but you do realize companies would need to want to pay for something like that for it to work right lol 
---
If 10000 people buy something that costs 10 bucks a month irl that's guaranteed 100k and potentially more if they keep their sub going. Even if it's a one time thing then it's 100k
---
If jagex gets a just half of the split it's minimum 50k which is enough to pay a entry level dev for a year and some change 
---
Sponsoring DMM finals for what a couple thousand viewers isn't worth nearly as much.
---
I did it in 2 from a fresh account with, no alts or anything. Not funded.
---
I downvoted but I support this.
---
Looks great, but I think you showily flesh out some more detail and shadows to give it that final touch
---
Sooo the story goes, I wanted to start working on cons because having a fairy ring in my house seemed like the greatest thing for my account ever and myth cape mounts was the cheapest option by far, (turns out my math was super wrong) 
---
So from that point I put ds2 as a goal after like a month, little did I know it would be one of the last things I did, but it did help because every skill I worked on was to meet that end. 
---
After 3 and a half months (the first 2 weeks were f2p) I got 211qp 1735total 104 combat. I've since stopped playing.
---
I agree with your definition of it being a microtransaction, difference is the allowance of the content without paying, just at a slightly later date. For those people who want to support the partners we approved as a community via poll, like great companies such as Discord they get the bonus of getting it a little earlier. Someone like myself would get access to new thematic content just later, completely for free which I would be more than happy with.
---
I truly believe 3 things: 
---
1. Jagex would never put MTX into OSRS. Something along these time-gated partnerships would be the closest they ever come.
---
2. The OSRS team had good intentions but their execution, explanation and handling of the polling and blogs were completely and utterly botched. 
---
3. The OSRS community is overreacting heavily to this. But, I completely sympathize with their hesitations. I have played Runescape on and off since 2007 and witnessed the death of old Runescape first hand. I understand but referring to my first point, Jagex and the OSRS team would never pull what they did with RS3.
---
Dumb
---
It's not so much setting a precedent for this community so much as it is the Discord team being able to handle the incident as per their guidelines and procedures. This is for them to investigate and deal with accordingly, our objectifications and judgements have no bearing on anything in this case, but the incident should be reported to Discord at the very least so that in may spur an investigation in the first place.
---
And regardless of the outcome, he would be on the authorities' radar. ***It was never my argument to suggest that anything groundbreaking would come out of it***, just that there can be that sliver of a chance that he would be reprimanded for his actions. At least that much we can agree on.
---
Callisto, Venanatis and occasionally KQ. I didnt say it was good for this boss, just that it wasnt bad.
---
Its nice to see something like this after seeing a bunch of people shitting out post about Jagex management being mad instead thanking the team for respecting the community
---
Now do rule34
---
This one inspires joy
---
I don't know if it's the game, or just the app itself. I mean, the app works great and all, and I'm glad we have it. But in my opinion OSRS is just inherently difficult to play on a phone. They did all they could to make the app good, which shows, but it's just an unpleasant experience due to the gameplay and restrictions of using a touch screen.
---
If you're being sarcastic, I'd like to introduce you to the magic of: Touch ups!!! It's this really mysterious magic where people can maintain their tattoos when they start to fade. I know, mind blowing.
---
&gt;content that would not have been in the game without partnerships covering the cost
---
Lmao they didn't say that you dumbass. Go read the fucking blogs.
---
same i did the same if not for the twitch promo i wouldn't have given osrs a shot after leaving rs2 back in the day but with the free month of members i could try it and was happy with what i found sponsors can build the player base which just makes it easier to release more unsponsored content.
---
They also said the exact same thing about MTX in RS3 and look where we are now.
---
Mean while twitch has been twiddling their thumbs and shoving them up jagex ass for years not dealing with the phishing problem on their platform. Not giving a shit about their users. But hey lets partner with them anyway! Zero integrity, just $$$ signs. 
---
And the twitch partnership was a good thing, for jagex parent company thats trying to bid jagex off for over $500m (and has been trying to sell jagex off for 6+months). It inflated active user/sub numbers so they could charge more for the sale.
---
What do you mean?
---
Just wanted to correct your timeline.
---
Auras (2011) -&gt; Squeal (XP Boosts and free XP) (2012) -&gt; Solomon's (Cosmetics) (2013)
---
I think the order is pretty important because the most damning stuff came out first.
---
   Mtn Dew/other brand-hosted DMM tourneys? other streamer/community involved esports events (Clan wars, streamer/clan clan wars, LMS???)? Idk just off the top of my head...donations could be read on screen like normal streams, percentage goes to the prize pool the rest to the sponsor? I really have no experience in this field i‚Äôm just spouting ideas. The cosmetic gear they just tried to get implemented could be featured in these tourneys/events. Brand-inspired color schemes, brand vs. brand clan wars events. PVP armor/weapons within these sponsored events have the color schemes. Literally just keep it all cosmetic, and again only within the event servers themselves. It would get a lot of streamers and possibly the community involved! The brands would get the advertisement they want but nothing about the gameplay changes.

This but unironically

Useless you mean a MASSIVE item sink plus new mage armors?

tf is that gay pink armor?

Hey didnt have rs3 as a reference like they do now. Redoing their mistakes would ultimately kill the game and the know this theyre only slightly dumb not fully.

When they started talking about how "disappointed' they were at the outrage, I couldn't help but laugh.

Yes.

Mith gloves are OG. It‚Äôs seen as a completionist thing for a pure. Especially since gear for pures is so limited. Combat brace is seen as a noob item, something that level 70s in full rune and d longs walk around in. 
---
You‚Äôll definitely get flamed for having a combat brace at some point along the line. Not that that‚Äôs a reason to stay away from a combat brace, but that‚Äôs how the pure community/pk community views combat brace vs rfd gloves.
---
next up on binging with babish

Because you can‚Äôt have a fucking game without the fucking company making it. This game will not grow, nor even continue to exist if they don‚Äôt increase profits. Them making more money is good for the game. More money = happier/more employees. More/happier employees = better support/updates/content. No more money = upset/quitting employees. Less/upset employees = worse support/less frequent content updates.
---
Had they not partnered with google and Apple, mobile would not have happened. Mobile took so fucking long because their team is small. Their team is small because they don‚Äôt have good profits/even sufficient profits to keep ‚Äúour beloved mods‚Äù from quitting.

Imagine hiring mercenaries with no new ideas piggybacking off perfomances that look good in the short run but they jumped ship before it ever got to the long run.

smooth brained.
---
Please bring back squeal of fortune
---
They ended the poll early because it was statistically impossible for the "Yes" votes to outweigh the "No" votes. There is no conspiracy here.
---
I think even if our game dies this year from partnerships or mtx, it has been an incredible 15 year journey that's taken me from childhood to adulthood. I wouldn't let a sour ending ruin all the hours played. Absolutely worth a tattoo.
---
I'm lv 52 and tired of it
---
The day that right click menus are phased out of this game will be the best day ever.
---
Ya
---
I‚Äôm Sorry for my wording. Point is if people don‚Äôt want what Jagex is offering, let‚Äôs come up with our own. People are already screaming that Jagex is just going to poll something else. Well of course they are, because we need something to bring people in. Let‚Äôs be part of the solution instead of just saying no to what they come up with.
---
For casual players it‚Äôs very hard to pay for a WoW Token. Most viable ways of making enough good for one is either to play the auction house very well, or be a fairly high end raider/mythic+ that can sell carry runs.
---
Think their tone was because of the way the poll itself was received, not that they are bummed they can't shove partnerships down our throats.
---
It must suck when you as a company say "We promise not to do this", and then the community feedback is that they are voting no because they will do exactly what they said they promised not to do. Regardless of how the companies reputation in the past had been. We didn't vote no on the poll as much as we just used it to express our opinion against MTX. The developers and other employees that don't dictate that will definitely feel bummed out.
---
Bonds are expensive enough. Especially for a new player
---
Lol I‚Äôd rock this in game and irl
---
It was initially going to be instanced but it was changed due to "community feedback". Should have been polled honestly.
---
Thats true but these were polled and all future ones were going to be polled
---
Well, what we know is they'd be non-tradeable (you can't have a tradeable exclusive) and fit in their traditional means of obtaining them. Such as Estate Agents for house themes and the purple skin at Makeover Mage 
---
I don't think you should really care that much about cosmetics if a few people got them without the required levels and tiny chunk of gold for a house theme for example. It doesn't detract any meaning from anyone else because it's a non-tradeable and merely a cosmetic - it means nothing. I get that overloading the game with such cosmetics and selling them on a store is different, especially with lootbox culture. While you could argue they were overloading it was just gathering a large chunk as a pool they could deploy to various partnerships.
---
You do have to understand however as the game progresses more players will quit because you can actually achieve your goals at a certain point and can easily get bored/tired/unwilling-to-dedicate at a certain point. So you do need to entice new players and if they get a comsetic or two that's actually more healthy for the game - regardless of Jagex being in the equation.
---
Of course it‚Äôs doing well, they had a partnership. But people don‚Äôt want any more of those so the growth is over. Plus the bump from mobile is over too.
---
I think either people were happy enough to get some free membership or that they didnt really think of the future and other partnerships
---
How mucj gp do u think per hr?
---
Been playing since 09
---
F
---
Yeah but you and others keep mentioning the purple skin. That it‚Äôs in the game doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre happy that it‚Äôs in-game. We didn‚Äôt really have a choice.
---
Technically I can‚Äôt really be apart of the problem if I don‚Äôt have an active sub, meaning I can never vote in the polls. I still am able to voice my opinion. 
---
Also you are making the assumption that ‚Äòthe problem‚Äô is people like me wanting to find a middle ground for an inevitable problem we are going to face as a successful (yet not successful enough for shareholders liking) game. 
---
The problem is that Jagex attempted to cleverly word things in order to get us to vote on something no one wanted, not even me. Also, adding to that the inevitable following to giving Jagex that power, aka the introduction of MTX in osrs (other than bonds ofc).
---
Literally 1m xp per hour what are you on.
---
Guardian boots
---
If you eat lobsters it‚Äôs even more profitable than praying. Also wouldn‚Äôt blowpipe if you want to maximize profit.
---
or how about just no mtx? jagex has made record profits 2 years in a row now, they dont need to add mtx its not like its a last ditch effort to save an unprofitable game
---
Give or take 3 means + or - 3. Ya know as In between 67 and 73.
---
Calls me out for logical fallacies then immediately throws out a strawman. Lmfao, this sub never ceases to amaze.  Never said anything about jumping on a p2w mmo. The vast majority of games being released, mmo or otherwise, are being shipped with optional purchases. We should be so lucky that even minor cosmetics are run by the community for approval. I've never seen that level of consideration from a multi-player game developer.
---
Nice try Jagex
---
But buyable XP bad, but buying the best items in the game is fine. /s
---
More, please.
---
I think they‚Äôre just trying to get Twitch to put them in the offers again. And to do that they need a new gimmick. But maybe you‚Äôre right and we don‚Äôt need Twitch. Maybe we find something else?
---
I joined a OSRS Facebook group the other day and  almost all of those fuckers were defending Microtransactions. Those people exist, which is scarier than the poll itself.
---
Excellent argument well said
---
You don‚Äôt seem to realise that the only reason bonds are in the game is to act as an alternative for people considering using 3rd party gold selling websites. If they were not in the game people would use 3rd party sites instead. So the ability to buy in game gold with real life money is out of Jagex‚Äôs control, hence bonds  are a justifiable form  of MTX.
---
The twitch prime promotion has brought along an endless swarm of bots which has arguably had a negative net effect on the game.
---
The majority of players want content to achieve cosmetics through in game progression and detest the idea of MTX. You cannot claim it would benefit the community, as it is evident it will cause people to drift away from, or even all out quit the game.
---
If you like the idea of MTX so much, go play rs3, they have an abundance of it over there.
---
It's not because there's 375k people subbed to /r/2007scape that there's 375k people reading the sub. A very big amount of those people dont play anymore and dont come here anymore. You honestly cant believe this is an argument.
---
Fuck Naw
---
We just don't want exclusive content that some people are excluded from, or pay to win mechanics.
---
You‚Äôd think so but it isn‚Äôt enough to hire new developers and push out completed content faster. We‚Äôll see dev blogs for stuff that won‚Äôt come out for either years or months. Yea I understand coding isn‚Äôt something that happens overnight or even over the course of a week, but if they had a partner incentivizing them / almost forcing them to do so, they would able to complete content for us for a release rather than us having to wait so long for updates to come out.
---
Because y'all flipped shit and posted nonstop memes about, as they say in the blog update, companies like Walmart and Pepsi. It wasn't productive. It was a circlejerk. Microtransactions would kill this game, absolutely, and there's a discussion to be had about slippery slopes, but the community response was obnoxious and one-sided. Photoshopped pictures of RS3-style cosmetics and verification can-esque memes aren't productive. If you have problems with partnerships as pitched - and again, I think there's a lot to criticize about them - actually talk about the issue at hand. I really have no problem with Jagex's tone of exasperation in the blog post given all of that.
---
Thanks
---
this comment gives me the heebie jeebies
---
Why is that button necessary in the first place? If it doesn't serve a gameplay function it shouldn't be there at all.
---
Can you provide an example of your first paragraph as I'm failing to think of one or misunderstanding what you wrote.
---
As for the second paragraph I think it's pointless to speculate on that stuff. The second point is interesting but I've never heard any source for that one.
---
Not at all the same thing.
---
Jagex is one of the only gaming companies still doing the right thing. They deserve respect and decorum in how we respond to them asking if an alternative method of monetizing the game so that they can continue that is acceptable.
---
Who is ‚Äúwe‚Äù the 100-200 people who make all the ‚Äújagex bad‚Äù memes and posts? Or the 300kish active player base who a majority probably doesnt even use reddit on a daily basis or even have reddit.
---
Very super rare when everyone gets one.
---
So Dragon Crossbow then?
---
Well thats a confusing stance
---
It wasn't an argument I was telling you to fuck off
---
Jagex when they rig the results.
---
Memes? There were memes? Did you say memes? Memes? Oh my god. Clearly my entire life has been a lie because someone on the internet made a meme. 
---
"you're not just actively incorrect, you're an idiot."
---
Take your pick at an objective means of judging intelligence. Education, IQ, career. Choose anything you like, I'll come out ahead.
---
for the record I don't even support them doing the partnerships beyond game time its just saying that its a slippery slope is not a logical argument and screeching it will just make jagex see us as a drooling mob instead of a community they can work with and learn from.
---
Wow, you worded my thoughts perfectly. 
---
I honestly really don't like how they handled this whole situation.
---
I'm well aware of how rs3 hit the shitter, i quit the momet rs2 got EoC and i even logged in to buy a 10 year cape in it. I'm a runescape veteran. the thing is, osrs is far more community driven than old RS ever was. they are aware that we don't ever want any form of mtx, and they aren't dumb. the memo has been sent. continuing to complain and write conspiracies about what jagex is trying to do is ridiculous
---
Thats why you lock it behing diaries or something similar that requires play time!
---
Give money to jagex, get ingame benefit: mtx
---
Give money to a company that is working with jagex to get an ingame benefit: *somehow not mtx*
---
1 Week later: Cat dead.
---
Gratz
---
Yeah, I understand.
---
It is fine to be clear when you're campaigning against it by saying things like Jagex is gonna put in MTX, I'll quit because of it...maybe even getting a bit toxic, I get all that.
---
However, after Jagex admits defeat, community makes it clear..whats the point of making posts like that? What's the point of laughing at Jagex afterwards?
---
Stop with the fearmongering, they never even suggested buy to win microtransactions, they POLLED freaking time-gated cosmetics, and even that failed. 'Very soon'? Come on.
---
&gt; dude!
---
prez is not a man.
---
Some one could literally buy bonds and sell them just to max creation skills. Gathering skills can‚Äôt be bought. But creation skills can be bought and are constantly bought. I see people dumb hundreds on bonds just to sell them for 4m and then buy all their crafting supplies and spend hours at the ge doing nothing but clicking.
---
How dare my multiplayer game be multiplayer!!!
---
To be fair the situation is quite different now. For starters they flat out said they won't be adding MTX (the fact this is *technically* mtx and that bonds are ingame makes me think they meant more aggressive forms of mtx like lamps and items), and that each and every partnership item would be polled. They also have the CEO backing, unlike back then.
---
Which is why I think they are getting a lot of undeserved flak. Sure they don't deserve a lot of faith, but the fact they polled it and recognized a failed poll makes me think they genuinely just wanted to introduce new ways to make the game grow without trying to abuse MTX crap. Which also kinda explain the tone of the update, even though it doesn't excuse it.
---
I'm slayer papa. I will say you are lucky as shit but at same time, fiance was literally trying to find pimples on my arm, i was trying to tank out last hits while I was out of food and my fiance bumped me getting me killed. I was on the way back when I got the drop notification of the cudgel and all I will say is that I'm glad it went to benefit and not gambling. What frustrated me is that I made it back in under 60 seconds and you had already picked it up. but congratz nonetheless.
---
Its an incentive and I can‚Äôt really think of any other benefit that we could offer besides membership
---
Nah I quit. Then they releases the original game again. Still havent touched rs3 since I quit, so your wrong üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
"Don't allow a precedent to be set" is not the same as a slippery slope fallacy. I'm not asserting that it will lead to that outcome, I'm just floating the possibility that it could, and the risk is not worth the payoff.
---
Idky people give a shit about stuff that literally does not change the game a single bit. Cosmetics do not change a game at all.
---
Im glad they literally had to stoop down to the reddit circle-jerkers to explain simple marketing.
---
No regerts
---
For $11 I get one character, for one month and shitty customer support. That's most definitely an issue.
---
I would literally be here until I got both I love it
---
How the fuck is that gonna bring in players?
---
I am from the future and have seen RS3 twice.
---
You played RS2. You are now playing another version of RS2. You didn't quit, you took a break.
---
I didnt even get to vote no.
---
You realize expanding playerbase = more money and more players. Its not just a cash grab
---
Just to be clear, don't have a lot of issue with toxicity when you're campaigning against it so you send a clear message.
---
However, when Jagex admits defeat...you laugh at them?  That's my issue.
---
It is the reactions AFTER the victory that I didn't like.
---
It wasn't like Jagex was all smug about putting these 'partnership' perks into the game. I'd get the reaction if they were smug about it, but that wasn't the case
---
Haha. Adamant. See what you did there.
---
The irony of this comment astonishes me.
---
But those who don‚Äôt pay a sub... and buy bonds on the ge... they all technically support mtx.
---
Whatever makes you sleep better at night champ
---
Just make the portal follow me around
---
Yeah but the memes and reddit circlejerk convinced the smallest of minds to disregard that simple fact
---
Say that to my full justciar
---
With 40k players against, and 20k for, they need another 100k players to be in favour. 
---
Or change the poll system.
---
Or integrity change.
---
Try [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f9VYWxyYz8iqi-hOr2ZWXyg2xRddmUmEu2qH8eekuvI/edit#gid=784646645). It's about a year old though.
---
No one asked for us to spend more money on membership..
---
no im just sayin
---
Its not about profits its about playerbase.......?
---
I just think y'all are overreaction based on a far out fear that they explicitly stated that they will not go towards.
---
Don‚Äôt forget: 
---
Don‚Äôt give money to Jagex, get ingame benefit: no mtx
---
How do u take yourself seriously while typing this lmfaooo
---
The polls saying no had literally nothing to do the the house cosmetics. 
---
I guarantee you if the *EXACT* same poll was ran for the exact same things except excluded the dumbass *partnership* they all would have passed.
---
Nice ideas! How do they increase our playercountn?
---
Oh yes history has *never* repeated itself. That's absurd.
---
This is quite obviously a foot in the door technique. How did they fuck up if rs3 brings in more money? Companies want money.
---
True, it was basically adding salt to the wound. This will be added to the drama calendar and people will move on to making memes of the next drama in a few weeks time.
---
It‚Äôs too small.
---
You dont HAVE to spend money at all to get the rewards.....

Do you know what director actually means?

If you get negative score it'll still bury your comment

Some activities require skill. If they have *everything*, I'd consider that person skilled. Am I wrong? Idk, you tell me (really, I think some thing are hard, if someone thinks nothing is hard, I'd honestly like to hear about it).
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
If you have some extra time I recommend reading the update blog post. The tone of voice came off as contradicting, bouncing from reassurement to unnerving multiple times.
---
yes i completely understand their frustration with this subreddit's moron hivemind.  
---
  
---
 u guys speak out of your asses with the same "slippery slope this is mtx coming aaaaaaaaaa" that you've been doing for the past 6 years against literally like a discord partnership or whatever that gives you a different house skin. this shit where you guys try to juxtapose rs2/3 and osrs is like those videos where some boomer folds a 20 dollar bill into the twin towers burning. thousands of you just unquestioningly toeing the same hysterical line.  
---
imagine you're jagex and your numerous attempts to assuage the community's fears, numerous confirmations from all levels that there will be no MTX in osrs to have to see that despite it all the top posts on reddit are still shit like "slippery slope this is why mmk left this is why the hid the polls they're doing it the chinese overlords are gonna milk the game".  
---
then imagine u have to pretend to have respect for that community
---
Directors have enormous power play.

They're basically the big boss of the games entire design from top to bottom.
---
That‚Äôs definitely not in NMZ. That‚Äôs the lobby btw
---
Wait.. so that's you?
---
People will buy bonds to sell em for GP, all win
---
With your rules tho... how would they enforce it? The only way to do that is to have the finals all on lan, which isn‚Äôt possible.
---
famous last words
---
shut up dad you're ruining my joke
---
My name is MetalDisco and ... :(.
---
Logic is a beautiful thing.
---
Honestly them saying that makes me sooppo fucking happy this didn't pass. It just shows how little they've learned, and how disconnected from the reality of the game they are. 
---
I hope this community stays smarter than them, else osrs3 is on its way.
---
Yeah but the point is that they explicitly stated WHAT the sponsored content will be. The other guy is insinuating that they‚Äôre trying to sneak it in - when it is *literally* held for judgement by the community.
---
My worry now is that they‚Äôre going to either keep polling mtx and keep changing the wording and try to confuse people into voting yes, or have a bunch more polls that all fail before they just start adding shit unpolled.
---
But they said the content (which is only cosmetic to begin with) would only be exclusive during the partnership period, what about that is MTX, hard to even classify that as ‚Äúin game benefit‚Äù
---
Read both the statements in full then and notice that they both have a very similar message... and we know one (MMG) was a false promise.
---
And yes, you can point it down even to the choice of word with *categorically* because back when this statement was released in 2012 by MMG it was generally well accepted and appeased the naive us of yesterday. Just as it is has once again somewhat appeased the majority this time. 
---
Basically what I‚Äôm saying is the choice of word dictates the same spirit of the message delivered in 2012 which ended up being a lie, so it forces one to believe that this message, written in very similarly language and tone will also yield to be a lie.
---
Seriously? I know you guys want to find every reason to shit on jagex and mtx but this is just ridiculous.
---
Nice one, Frogdog.
---
I understand that jagex wants to make more money from osrs. The thing is, and why I think the poll is so one sided, is you guys did a really bad job with rs3 monetization. I can almost guarantee you that any similar polls will be voted out in a similar way because we cant trust you anymore. I don't want to say this, but rs3 is dead. Sure you can say that some large number of people play the game, but just look at any streaming services, rs3 streamers arent watched. On most days, even the top rs3 streamers have less than 100 viewers. Blame eoc if you want, blame mtx, I don't care, but the game is dead and because of this it is really hard for people who love this game to trust you guys to make good choices when talking about big changes or additions to the game.
---
I remember when I heard in 2002 that rs2 was coming I was super stoked and when it did come out, it was awesome and fantastic, I remember hoping the same thing for when rs3 was announced and the sadness that came from most of my friends leaving the game with the issues thereafter. I don't mean to sound like a downer, and maybe I'm just saying things you already know very well. Like I said earlier, I want you guys to make good money off this game. You've done good with osrs so far. Build our trust and keep making this game great, I believe you can get that money in a smart and innovative way, but it has to be foolproof, because you should know by now how easy it is to ruin a good thing.
---
Thought so but I never have bought bonds before
---
This game was made to run on windows 95
---
Thanks. How helpful.
---
Example specific of this occurring historically no I can't off the top of my head (with research I'm sure it's there).
---
However as a discussive scenario - lets say there's a partnership with Amazon Prime. To receive the product/item you need a subscription for Amazon Prime to be able to claim it. In most cases Amazon Prime is free for the first month, and then bills accordingly (meaning you need visa debit/credit card details to be able to create an account and sign up).
---
Not only does this mean that you have to give your personal and billing information to a 3rd party company to receive an in-game product, but if you have created a free account before (e.g. Warframe ran an Amazon Prime partnership deal for a short period which I signed up for) you cannot take advantage of the first free month again (requiring the subscription to be paid or for you to create a dummy account - unless it's email specific in which case dummy accounts are null and void).  All of a sudden - there's a subscription fee, or you have to wait for this product in the future.
---
And that is how micro transactions can become 'accepted' - through the use of existing details resulting in subscription bills.
---
Fire them and hire people who actually give a shit about Runescape
---
Official skillcape hoodies purchasable only when the skillcapes are obtained in game. Basically real life micro transaction instead of ingame. I could dig that.
---
Same money with tbow
---
Son of a...BITCH
---
It probably at the very least evens out with the people who buy bonds to sell for GP, with the people who play the game via Bonds bought with GP.
---
Great idea
---
Ah yeah, there's a lot more to maxing if you get all the diaries/quests done, but yeah I think most of the skill part is bossing/raids
---
The reason people don‚Äôt have a problem with it is because it benefits them, 
---
bonds are textbook mtx.
---
Slayer EHP is 85-90k per hour. Zuk tasks aren't part of this.
---
I advise one with a video card/graphics card. Mine doesn't and I regret buying one without.
---
No jagex did not want this poll to fail, the old school runescape team however did.
---

---
WINGS OF GLORY
---
Also bonds are encouraging players to RWT. Its cheaper to buy rsgp with real money and then buy bonds to get memberships than just buying membership.
---
&gt;Oh woop de fuckin do, you can't miss any exclusive content with bonds?
---
Yes, correct, you do not miss any exclusive in-game content by not RWT'ing bonds.
---
&gt;Oh it's not like bonds are the greatest money money in the game if you work a part time job with disposable income 
---
Irrelevant. I didn't ask you to explain why bonds are bad MTX. I asked you to explain why "Paid exclusive access to in-game items" are not considered MTX in your book.
---
&gt;Technically it's not a micro transaction, it's a reward that's locked behind a 3rd party
---
More reasonable is to assume it's be similar to the twitch prime skin. Which means you would have to make a **purchase** from a 3rd party, **for an in game reward.**
---
A purchase for an in-game reward. A microtransactions with an extra step.
---
&gt;for all I know you a discord themed item for just linking your account
---
Unless Jagex *SPECIFICALLY* stated that *EVERY SINGLE PARTNERSHIP* would not require a payment to get the early access cosmetic, I would never believe this for a second.
---
&gt;It's more of a gift than a possible mtx by proxy
---
The Twitch Prime Purple Skin partnership required you to **purchase** a twitch prime sub for early access to an exclusive **in game reward**. How was that not an MTX by proxy?
---
:(
---

I use 1 sip of normal antifire and super c per 2 kills and maybe 2 doses of ppotty. So like 6k
---
What the eff, how?
---
Like what method, and is he on hyperactivity drugs?
---
The description for the system was too vague to really make sense of if I'm going to be blunt. Using the term "exclusive" probably started some fires too.
---
If Jagex really wants to get it together they should get someone that can actually communicate clearly and make more detailed poll questions that consider other possibilities that aren't just "yes/no to the whole thing." Between the wording of previous polls and the way this blog is written it's kind of telling that the people behind it are likely hiding something or just plain negligent of their wording.
---
Have we forgotten how much of a shit show DMM always is? 
---
The last thing they need is to make money off it
---
It defo looks real but seriously man this is so bad was you running on a treadmill the same time it was getting done and what's with the spacing in between you could fit another rune inbetween them
---
Yeah this kind of shit is the whole reason I stopped posting here, I barely even lurk now. There are a lot of really great, smart people here, but the hive-mind type bullshit is on a new level.
---
That's not a microtransaction.
---
I feel if they just tried polling one new partnership idea in a group of unrelated questions it probably would of had a much better chance of passing. Polling 21 new partnership ideas caused everyone to panic.
---
You're not counting bolts and food. Bolts alone are more than 6k on average.
---
&gt;Besides, you're missing the point. Jagex aren't looking for a DDM/minigame sponsor, they're looking for a way to advertise as many sponsors as possible, quickly, convinently and cheaply.
---
Where in the world did you get that idea? Everything mentioned has been about attracting new members.
---
Was visible in game apparently

Same bro, I take 100 doses in and it lasts me 4 hours. Happy with that for now. The 22k's start to add up eventually.
---
Jesus grow up dude. Partnerships are needed to keep the game at where it is and to keep it under attention. They are looking for some way to make it work for the players aswell as the partners. You cannot expect Twitch to just give OSRS money and not give them anything in return.
---
Go from getting 99attack to weird shit welcome to Reddit

That would actually require effort though. Finding a supplier, figuring out shipping, etc.

They just want to slap out some shoddy content and throw a sponsor on it.

---
Sammich and a nap haven‚Äôt heard that since I quit hahah
---
In all honestly, this sub is retarded and does not know anything about business.
---
Partnerships are a way to bring more players into the game. Let me explain.
---
Imagine: Jagex undergoes a partnership with Netflix - the promotion is that all Netflix users can get 7-day membership for free + the PoH theme of Morytania. Netflix will show some advertisements on their social-media and more - this in turn will lead to old players returning (who were playing when they were young) and perhaps OSRS players to get a Netflix subscription to get the PoH theme quicker, since all the promotions will be accessible for EVERYONE once the promotion is over. It is not intrusive nor does it carry over into the live game, unless you use W330. Otherwise you wont ever see the house themes probably.
---
I thought that this was a solid idea to bring partnerships into the game. 
---
Including the fact that the previous partnership brought many players to the game.
---
Hahaha it happens
---
Partnerships, as they were proposed, are not needed at all. In fact, you're just spewing out the same nonsense Jagex said in their blog post. Were you even around when RS2 went downhill due to MTX? Do you even know how all of that stuff went down?
---
Jagex was straight out idiotic by presenting the Partnerships as they did. You know what's needed to make the game stay where it's at? Better account security, better bot detection and how about some actual customer service? 
---
Partnerships were never needed and still are not.
---
Wtf i didnt vote for that
---
Shh, people want to be mindlessly angry about everything, you can't point out the obvious.
---
Also, come on, discord would be gray, not orange. Get it right.
---
Fkn shit tattoo
---
Would you like redberry bushes south of lumbridge castle? This would be part of a partnership and later be available for all players.
---
Hang in there, OP. I went 107 chests dry of a barrows piece. Then over the course of the next 600 chests, my drop rate slowly crept back down to 1/17, just about exactly what it's supposed to be. Keep it up and it'll even out.
---
To my knowledge, there‚Äôs no limit. A mass of zerkers showed up while I was soloing and it was probably near 10 of them. The entire room was filled tile to tile with spiders when they spawned.
---
Come by 421 one day
---
What the fuck does this even mean? Do your parents know you're on the internet?
---
You can cancel thru your registered email if you lose your device iirc
---
The given content in this case is something that the community wants. Why would they give something that they don‚Äôt want? Doesn‚Äôt make sense does it?
---
And of course, this makes it also more desirable for the current players, but they will get it for FREE. Once the promotion is done. What is the issue with waiting 2/3 weeks maybe?
---
Placing a ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù system into the game to counter gold selling is one thing, but time gating and pay walling cosmetic items in a game about expressing your progression through your characters appearance is too fucking much.
---
I'm thinking its time to dip soon.
---
Lava runes are the fastest RC XP all the way until 99, but they result in a loss of money. Mud runes make a fair profit, and they were relatively fast for me, I did them straight from like 14 RC to 44 RC over the past 4 days and made around 1 mil net profit. And it wasn‚Äôt 4 days of dedicated RC‚Äôing, I did wildy slayer, flipping, and high alching in that period as well.
---
I‚Äôd say look up a RCing calculator online and put your stats/target stats in. It‚Äôll give you estimates of how much money will be made/lost, and exactly how many inventories you‚Äôll need to do, and you can judge what‚Äôd be best for yourself.

---
Maybe the Jagex devs aren‚Äôt evil, but the company just changed hands and this weird shit started happening immediately.
---
It‚Äôs worth being vigilant over.
---
Yeah but honestly not many people give a shit. I've personally lost faith in the dev team with how some of the content is nothing like polled but if something like this was put in despite failing polls I'd imagine the shitstorm would be pretty big
---
THIS is the partnernship we want. OSRS anime when?

You‚Äôre such a unique thinker. Best in breed, definitely onto something separate from the crowd of sheep. Keep it up kiddo.

I see [this](https://m.imgur.com/a/2sYg9IL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)  guy still didn‚Äôt figure out how nmz works.
---
&gt;  Almost like they‚Äôre saying, ‚Äúyou fuckers OBVIOUSLY didn‚Äôt read the original blog . . . "
---
To be fair, that pretty much is the situation. The blog very clearly stated that the poll was *only* for these specific partnership additions and any future partnership additions would be both entirely cosmetic and polled individually. Despite that, this subreddit was **full** of people using slippery slope fallacies about how if this poll passes, Jagex were going to take it as a free license to add all the pay2win MTX they wanted without polls. Which obviously makes no sense at all, because if Jagex were going to push through pay2win MTX without a poll, why would they need this poll to pass first?
---
In other words:
---
Jagex: "Here is a poll for X. Note that this poll will not lead to Y."
---
Community: "Omfg Y is going to happen if poll X passes!"
---
Jagex: "Well no we specifically said that Y won't happen. This is *just* a poll for X."
---
Community: "Omg don't listen to Jagex, Y will definitely happen if X passes!!!"
---
You can see why this might be pretty frustrating on Jagex's end.
---
You're saying that the collective 36 cents per day, equating to 50m profit last year, is the only incentive Jagex needs to create content without trying to get any other types of monetization. I'm saying that they're not actually taking 50m profit at the end of everything, so that's not exactly an incentive to not find further things to help the company grow. If you can't understand that, you may be the one with reading comprehension issues. Every single reply of yours is throwing a tantrum, because you're unable to have a discussion without acting outraged and throwing insults. So again, you really need to grow up.
---
I want to suck on them toes.
---
&gt;I'd fully support sponsorships that aren't intrusive to content/gameplay.
---
Isn't that what they were proposing?
---
Adding a limited amount of perfectly normal in-universe themed cosmetics in an area that wouldn't affect clarity or visibility like skin colors, home teles, and PoH skins certainly felt like a sponsorship that wasn't intrustive to content or gameplay to me.
---
 Hell, what you're saying feels like it would be more intrusive to me. Seeing the words "brought to you by mountain dew" when you login to a DMM server seems like it would be way more jarring and out of place than a Dorgeshuun POH.
---
OSRS has grown over the last 6 years even before partnerships.

---
Lava runes are a combination rune made by combining a fire/earth tune and pure essence, worth around 5 gp on the Grand Exchange. This is the same price as a single fire or earth rune, meaning you‚Äôre actually losing the money you use to buy the essence for crafting. Additionally, each inventory of a combination rune requires a talisman to be consumed, which is roughly 180-250 gp every inventory, and a binding necklace is required to have a 100% success rate when making combination runes. These have 16 charges and disintegrate when they‚Äôre all used up (815 gp each). 
---
On top of all of that, any teleport methods you use will also likely require gp, resulting in a pretty substantial loss of money. 
---
Mud runes are also combination runes, so the same process is required to make them, and a similar investment is required. The difference is, where each lava rune is worth 5 gp, each mud rune is worth 220-230 gp. You‚Äôll easily recuperate the cost of your investment, while making a fair profit due to their low supply, but you‚Äôll get less xp/hour as a trade off.
---
That is the best theory I've seen so far. It was such an aggressive push, how could they think it even stood a chance of passing.
---
If the point is to bring in new players why in the fuck would you ever offer anything but X days free membership. New players don't care about POH skins, wtf? New players don't care about anything until theyve actually played the game enough to even know what those things are in the first place.
---

I think they should stick to using the account inbox for anything like this for the avoidance of all doubt. They should never be sending emails with links to login to the website because that is exactly what lets the fakes look convincing.

Wouldn't even have to lock them like that, but could add a limited time discount once you hit 99 in that skill's skillcape.
---
It's difficult to understand for a very simple reason: not everyone agrees with your stance. Mobile being released has thrown a spanner in the works for that whole community hardcore no stance, I mean that 30% of people who voted yes came from somewhere right?
---
I always hated those random weird looking outfits, especially the easter and the christmas tree outfits just look retarded
---
But just because there's already stupid cosmetics in the game doesn't mean they should add even more with these weird skin colour options
---
That‚Äôs putting it nicely, this sub acted like Jagex personally came into their house and kicked their pet dog.
---
Why does everyone make a huge deal about mtx, but not about Rwt and the gold selling sites.
---
Jagex's official position is MTX were necessary for Runescape and Jagex to survive, and without them, neither the company or the two later game versions would exist.

I see this comment a lot here, but I've yet to see any actual proof.  Links I've looked at never say anything about OSRS actually making more money than RS3, I've only seen things like "x number of installs on mobile" and "OSRS helped drive more profits"
---
This doesn't mean that OSRS eclipses RS3 in revenue, it just means it's doing well.
---
yes

maybe server ping got something to do with it? change world u trying to get in

It's not free money if it takes time to do. Age old time=money is true af. You could get much more money doing different things.
---
How the fuck was it passive aggressive lmao,I swear this community acts so victimised sometimes.
---
Then they don't get fat stacks.
---
OP does not understand JaGeX just had their most profitable year on record and still want more despite offering subpar services in many important aspects of business such as customer service.
---
I'm very aware of the point OP is making, I'm just saying I think the community was at fault here, not Jagex.
---
I think a comp cape would be nice as a cosmetic only and not a BIS. Kind of like the final trophy for being a master of the game and experiencing everything across OSRS. Could make it even better and make different versions for HCIM, Ironmen, and Ultimate Ironmen too just to give praise for people who do it alone. 
---
However, the original comp cape did have some very rediculous requirements such as 5k castle war games that could be toned down juuuust a bit lol. But hey if people still like that requirement it's up to them, really. 
---
Though another question is how to make the conp cape really stand out amongst people even more than the mad cape, since there are no particle effects in the game to make it look snazzy, or being able to customize it with colour swaps. 
---
Either way, I think it'd be fine if it was purely cosmetic. Doubt I'd ever get it but it'd be cool to see.
---
God this looks so bad. Did you really have to space the poorly drawn runes so far apart. Like rly üòÇ
---
Well, no, not really, the community is the one really at fault here.
---
Do you wooxwalk? Maybe I should start doing that to spice things up a lil bit cuz its also getting really boring.
---
No it was definitely Jagex
---
Well, RWT and gold selling sites are against the rules and Jagex actively ban accounts involved. The only reason they still exist is because there are players buying from them. At this point I‚Äôm not mad at Jagex for not being able to stamp out RWT, it‚Äôs the people buying gold that are the problem.
---
Cute!
---
Technically the meta gold farm is to just work a 9 to 5 and buy gold on gold trading sites or through bonds
---

---
Holy shit I almost took your comment seriously for a second.
---
Look, I'm not gonna rehash this argument for the 100th time, especially when I know I'm not gonna change anyone's mind, so I'll just say that I'm embarrassed by how the community acted over the last few days and be done with it.
---

---
Because you give an inch they take a mile. These companies would also want a say in how long the promotion would be up for and let be real most companies are very greedy, Lock a desired cosmetic behind a subscription service for 2 years and the number of people coming into your service would be much higher becasue people wont wait years to get it for free.
---
No it wasnt, Eventually it would be free for all but it would not be free for all day 1.
---
Wording is key here, disappointed is not the word to use if they thought they were wrong.
---
Gotta love people like you who vote without even bothering to read the entire thing lol
---
If I want the reward in a timely fashion I would have to pay. Partner company locks cosmetic reward behind 2 year time wall are you really going to say yeah ill just wait 2 years for it.
---
it ain't much but it's honest work
---
Even things as basic as a damage done total to earn additional points would improve the game IMO.  200 per point, w/e.
---
If im paying additional for content its a microtransaction even if I have to go through a third party to get it.
---
"It's totally not our marketing department writing this, honestly guys"
---
Which pets do you not like?
---
Sure free once its over, So lets set the promotion to last 2 years its still free when the promotion is over ggguuuuiisssseeee. 
---
You see how them giving 0 infomation can be fully exploited by these companies. I pay a subscription, I should not have to pay for additional content.
---
Funny thing is if these timed cosmetics came out, people wouldn't even fucking wear them.
---
Except that they started to actually update the game when the game started getting more popular than they expected and got some more staff. 
---
Don‚Äôt try and make us believe that the recoloured obby shields, crazy archeologist or nmz brought anyone into playing...

Very true, you can usually tell a Sween blog, a Gambit blog, or the little sayings of an Ash blog, this is an unhappy chappy blog
---
Yeah they voted yes to it because taking business away from bot farms and providing wider access to membership was a huge boon to the economy and player count following the release of the Grand Exchange and Free To Play
---
who knew that adding things that the players actually want could be healthy for the game??

To be honest, they already have mtx. At least this way people will secure there accounts better

Don‚Äôt pay it then, speak with your wallet instead of complaining like a little bitch all the time. Osrs community hasn‚Äôt grown up since 07.
---
At the end of the day they offer a service for a set price, you either want it enough for that price, or you don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs the former stop complaining.
---
The ironing is delicious. 
---
Brah.
---
The cosmetics aren‚Äôt the problem you dummy
---
MTX was never necessary, that‚Äôs the biggest lies I‚Äôve ever heard. MTX was added, like EOC to make RuneScape more in line with other mmorpgs. Jagex became extremely greedy and ruined their own game during it‚Äôs peak. Like they could have just implemented higher membership fees and bonds or decided on some better management considering if you look how much investment has went into rs3 even though the game is practically dead.
---
I just want you to know that this is EXACTLY how mtx first began in runescape in 2008/2009. First cosmetics ONLY.   Then the fucking fire nation attacked.
---
It's the exclusivity that sucks.
---
Want to bring new content and mention in the blogs that it was sponsored by X company? Fine. But I paid my membership fees, you're not locking me out of content that I already paid for, for any period of time. That's a huge middle finger to your loyal, paying customers, and they won't stay loyal for long if you do that.
---
I tried zulra a few times and got pretty decent and close to a kill.
---
But then i realised it was such a pain in the ass without ring of suffering. Once i can afford to blow 10m on that i will grind some zulra. Might as well get some higher stats too while im at it.
---
Hurr durr loyalty points
---
Yeah , I'll do the research before even thinking about it. I was just asking what those name meant
---
rs3 was losing players and costing more to run. idk if i agree that it was necessary, but its very understandable why theyd think that, since theyd backed themselves into a corner with so many anti-playerbase updates that wouldnt bring back players if reverted
---
Where are the girls?
---
Cosmetics and some pet from twitch prime, as well as guaranteed rare rolls on the weird gambling thing they have.
---
Yep. We. You are indeed speaking for me.
---
Literally all of them... They were all cosmetics.
---
Which is my point. So you don't think Jagex understands what makes OSRS good? And what would it take for you to trust them with things like this, when they say it would never get 'worse' than this? My point is that they fucked us over with RS3, but don't you feel like they have to understand what OSRS is all about, and they wonn't make the same mistake again.

Noticing a few comments saying it's badly done. It is! The artist is still studying! He's a childhood friend and is currently doing his training tattoos. It was free, helped him do color for the first time, and let him do a sensitive spot on a client.
---
Plus I squirmed cause I'm a lil bitch and it's my first tattoo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm sure I'll get it touched up eventually, I plan on adding the runestones behind the symbols at some point. Along with many other tats, cause it felt GOOD to be under the needle.

Lmao same thing.

Yeah who the fuck wrote this shit. Jagex tell us so we can poll on them getting fired or demoted.

Didn't pay for it, it was one of many free sessions for my friends training. He will be practicing on my free canvas for as long as he needs c:

This has very little to do with the quest as it would be even easier to just straight up buying the berries either in Port Sarim or from another player.

The point is to make early game bakery more accessible to new players.

How do you disagree with the fact that the large models scaled down condense the amount of details into one small area
---
[It gets to the point where some of these models look like they're superimposed onto the game rather than being in it](https://i.imgur.com/zgyVlyy.jpg)
---
Jad and KBD and most skilling pets dont have this problem, but bosses that are huge definitely do
---
i get it!
---
...i dont get it
---
im also not pro-mtx, i just think people are being dumb about this and noy all considering what is actually happening here compared to rs3.
---
not that it matters now anyway lmao
---
Just don't be shit at the game mate, easy.
---
you‚Äôre missing the whole point
---
something‚Äôs either cosmetic or provides benefit, if they try to release a non-cosmetic mtx there‚Äôs no fucking way people would be okay with that. If they do a cosmetic mtx then there‚Äôs a better chance people will be accepting of it as it‚Äôs not giving anybody benefit from spending irl money
---
You didn't play rs3.
---
You didn't see it happen.
---
check their revenue numbers pre 2013. 
---
they had to lay off a significant part of their staff and barely made any profit.
---
theres a trend ive recently observed: its always delusional people accusing others of being delusional. the irony
---
I agree about the holiday event outfits, but Jagex agreed too. I can't remember who said it or the exact wording but they agreed that they got a bit carried away with those outfits and regret releasing them as they didn't 'hit the mark'.
---
Not here
---
You'd be right except we've seen it before.
---
We're right to be wary.

Be On the MTX store in a matter of time dw

I'm glad I'm not the only one that noticed the vibe of that post. Us, the players are not the ones that need to expand their thoughts and feelings on the game.

for 11 dollars a month, I get access to a single character for one month on a vanilla client that cannot even utilize multi-threading let alone GPU rendering, I get customer support from social media and a playerbase heavily populated by robots and 3rd world black market gold farmers. This is not good value, $11 per month is not an insubstantial amount of money. I could buy several games per year for that, even amongst most MMOs its pretty normal to have an account with multiple characters

My criticism is valid, thank you.

I have a 2k normie, 2172 ironman and a 1775 uim and I understand that companies learn from their mistakes and that the MTX hype has ended and receives massive critique due to its immoral nature. I also don't need other people's opinion to form my own.
---
I can feel the virginity radiating from this
---
This is just an extremly biased negative interpretation of yours.
---
If you want to play multiple characters on the same account you‚Äôre in the 0.00001%, I can guarantee even if that was a thing hardly anyone would utilise it as you wouldn‚Äôt be able to multilog. Osrs doesn‚Äôt need to use GPU rendering, you do realise the main aspect of having use of the GPU is 3D vector collision calculations, which is null and void for this game (notice how GPU rending on runelite doesn‚Äôt actually do much at all). This customer support through social media thing is actually a meme, have you ever even used customer services? It‚Äôs no different to any other company I‚Äôve dealt with. 
---
Bots are a big problem that jagex evidently struggle to do anything but reactively nerfing their gp/h methods, but that makes no means to you $11 a month.
---
Even with constructive criticism it holds no value to your subscription price.
---
I will actually pay 1k each for these if you pm me
---
Do you mean it's too expensive to use?
---
But they would still need a netflix account that costs about the same a month as a runescape account.
---
Any chance you got this done in LA? Because this looks like it was done during the earthquake
---
So you only want what fits to your narrative hmmm.
---
Complaining polls only go through because of bandwagon behaviour when your in the minority, but when you‚Äôre in the majority all of a sudden it‚Äôs show the polls. This is part of the reason osrs community is a joke.
---
It is unfortunate that the most controvertial poll was released too soon with the hidden polls, that timing gave too much paranoya fuel to already traumatized players with post-RS3 PTSD
---
Pet Control?

This chick is a master of skill in the game and only uses magic and melee attacks never skill, anyone ever notice that? What pops in my head anytime I see her, not sure why haha

To add on to OPs reply, drop 2 food slots for 5-7 high alchs worth if runes. Its helped extend my trips to 5-8 instead of 3-6. You high alch any type of armor (dplate, dskirt, rune longswords, rune kites) dont bring a stack because you can always drop the natures and fire runes for bones. Also never keep unnoted blue dragonhides. Its not worth
---
Because its a fucking idiot question.  He got google like all others?
---
P2W/intrusive or flamboyant mtx or otherwise exclusive mtx content which serves no purpose but to create revenue if you want to be pedantic about it, I think everybody here knows what I mean by it.
---
Bonds area healthy way to have a safe way to buy gold with cash from reputable players and fund Jagex instead of bot farms and sweatshop mules and a way to play without paying, which is a huge roadblock for a lot of players who can justify the time but not the money.
---
Sponsorships are a way to attract new players and spread the playerbase beyond nostalgic returnees.
---
Thing is... The bonds being bought and sold supply instant gold. But this also gives money to the company. It gives someone else the chance to not spend money for membership, making more people play. On top of that, you can purchase an xp or skills to make the game easier. 
---
You could have made gear on a new account from being millions in bonds, but can't use any of it. 75 cmb stats are needed for most stuff. Even if they get th stat reqs, they would still suck at any pvm/skipping content.
---
Credits goes to Ben McInnes - Tardscape - Sorry for the late response just got on now, never knew this would blow so much up and i never intended to steal your spotlight, this video was just to good to not be shared.

So sorry just got on now, take a look at my latest reply brother!
---
The partnerships would only incentivize supporting the content creators and making money, the real pull we get from new players is already there from streamers. MTX wouldn‚Äôt make those numbers better, and...
---
You‚Äôre a fucking ding-dong.
---
Ok, BETA MALE!
---
Their company is better then yours. üòò
---
Good. We definitely need to expand the playerbase, hopefully they won‚Äôt cater to delusional idiots on reddit who care more about the memes
---
You literally made a screenshot of this shit meme, didn't even bother cropping it and reposted it. Fuck off.
---
Imagine thinking you have Jagex in the palm of your hands because their generous enough to poll updates fucking LOL
---
Private servers are probably the ‚Äúnuclear option‚Äù the community has in mind. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there are many people out there willing to offer OSOSRS for a small fee and possibly some of your personal information.
---
Good, you might enjoy using shit like "Manbabies" but because we are in our 20's we've seen the destruction that money has on the games industry. We've seen the major players shit everywhere and crush childhoods with as much pandering, money milking, soul sucking garbage for years now. Jagex did it themselves and unlike a lot of other communities willing to bend over and get fucked in the ass we're a lot more outspoken and passionate about our hobbies.
---
Fuck us though, for being entitled, manbaby children? Here let me get you a list of some of Jagex's other projects.
---
DarkScape
---
8Realms
---
Carnage Racing
---
Chronicle: RuneScape Legends
---
Ace of Spades
---
RuneScape: Idle Adventures
---

---
You want us to trust some company which has had a huge string of failures, propped up on the success of a game made by a couple of guys who have been out of the picture to years now? The one getting shuffled around in China at the moment?
---
We have *every* reason to kick and scream.
---
The chanting reminded me of Midsommar
---
And the sad thing is you get downvoted for speaking the truth. This reddit doesn‚Äôt give a shit about game integrity anymore then they enjoy the drama
---
Then it's going to be higher sub fees.
---
They also tried to cut out half of the regicide quest in preparation for SotE
---
Has warding been polled yet?
---
Meh, you can always get it touched up later. Atleast they are recognizable. Fun lil concept.
---
Get some friends
---
kk, will that be pinned to the top?
---
Ok so I take it having a few more teleport animations would ruin the game for you? You didn't mention any reasons why we shouldn't have more, you just made the rs3 bad osrs good joke basically except it wasn't a joke.
---
Personally, I like all the different teleport animations we have, maybe you do too. So why not have the option of more?
---
Keep telling yourself that bud. I‚Äôve been playing since rsclassic was just runescape. I definitely do not just care about the memes, nice try belittling people who love the game
---
You do realize the concept of these cosmetics being offered by an event irl has already been a thing for years.....
---
That sounds like some gatekeeping to me: gatekeeping here referring to the concept of ‚Äúfun‚Äù or ‚Äúa life.‚Äù
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEER post.
---
Honestly I think they are just looking at it from a different angle than I've seen posted by others here.
---
They want whales. They looked at who the biggest whales are in game, I'm sure there's a correlation between whales and construction cape.
---
The bond buyers with con cape and maxed houses will not hesitate to buy a month of twitch prime or whatever, to unlock the new house style day 1. 
---
They don't really care about new players, it would be a nice secondary effect; they just want a way to extract money from the many whales in game. They are spending too much real money on OSRS without Jagex getting a cut. If Jagex got a cut of all the RWT in game they would have so much money they wouldn't know what to do with it.
---
It should be embarrassing to be found to have bought any advantage in game. It has been normalised for people for example in the staking community to put in real cash for their rebuild after being cleaned. Or people paying vennies to train their pures up.
---
If this market dries up Jagex will stop trying to tap into it, because it won't exist.
---
If it keeps on going eventually we will have black market RWT *and* Jagex fuckery with a roundabout version of MTX in game. 
---
The runescape playerbase is very fickle and that is to our merit. Look at how quickly all of us quit the game before, and we are back paying 100 euros a year only for as long as we are getting things exactly how we want it.
---
Don't do the same thing twice and expect a different result. You have hindsight and if you fuck it up again make sure you pocket enough money you don't have to crawl back with oldschool-oldschool in 2025. Your player-base won't have just moved up an age bracket next time
---
1k my world vwest
---
i wish, i do have a good number of (i think) interesting collections but i only have 55 of these, probably still the most of anyone in the game.
---
Are you familiar with the Ship of Theseus? If you are, you can probably guess what I'm about to ask. The CEO now is different. A lot of staff at Jagex is different too. How can you say that the new Jagex is exactly the same as the old Jagex when it's fundamentally very different?
---
You're placing the sins of those in the past on those in the present, even when they've done nothing wrong.
---
Rs2 was always headed in the wrong direction since 07. Devs never catered to feedback they made the game the way they thought best.
---
If you open you‚Äôre eyes for a millisecond you‚Äôd notice osrs dev team is entirely different. When do you remember rs2 being so worried about what the players think of an update and rolling it back or changing it?
---
Generally yeah, ‚Äúwhales‚Äù really adds up when it‚Äôs a $5 nitro sub, a $12 humble bundle sub, 3 $7 twitch subs (for ya boys Settled, J1mmy, and Framed), a $17 amazon prime subscription, a netflix and hulu subscription, this shit REALLY adds up to out of normal people‚Äôs budgets. It‚Äôs like, $100-$150 a month on garbage. Consider that many people make like 1500-2000 a month, that‚Äôs a huge hitter.
---
Jagex's method of implementing updates was not locked behind a promise wall, sure.   
---
I don't quite see what that adds, or takes away, from my comment though.
---
yew longs, because of gp, just string for xp, cut + string might be better gp
---
Volume isnt logarithmic, but decibels are, except theres no real defined endpoint with which to determine what halfway is. You can keep pumping energy into higher and higher decibel sounds but after youve blown eardrums, shattered glass, and begin causing cavitation events in the open air, there isnt much around to appreciate it.
---
I gotta take a pee pee
---
Because it wouldn‚Äôt bring in players. Thats the entire fucking point lol
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Sometimes with cosmetics, less can be more; the cosmetic has more personal meaning if you actually earn it and can use it to show off that you've completed the challenge to get it, meanwhile, if it's just handed to you or given for a minuscule fee, it's just unimpressive feature bloat.
---
Like in rs3, you see someone's outfit, think "wow, that's some cool armour", examine them, and find out it's Solomon's mtx bullshit instead of an actual armour set. 
---
House skins are more mild than all this, but when the higher ups are aching so much to fill the game with mtx, the slope is almost frictionless.
---
That's not how that works lmao
---
I have no idea how to get it pinned, never done this before
---
sure, why not?
---
&gt;it will be available from master clues in game after a year or so so it‚Äôs not an mtx only exclusive!!
---
This is literally not even what was proposed for the introduction of the bonuses after the promotions ended. Bad scarecrow mate.

No it was a decision of reddit propaganda
---
In SWAMPLAND
---
And that wasn‚Äôt offered
---
nah fuck the houses lol.
---
So let me tell you about it...
---
That doesn't bring new players into the game though. Jagex just gets a check in that case. The whole point of partnerships is to be able to target a specific audience and get them to play the game with temporary rewards. Slapping mtn dew on the dmm stream won't bring in new players.
---
Halfway through I was gonna comment "Now get a green stack of them", but I guess you're already ahead of me
---
So when you max and can actually start playing game, this is the actual game? Nice.
---
What? The game already does that, every single frame. That's an extremely basic and essential function.  
---
Engine work would likely be required to allow testing for intersecting roofs, but that **shouldn't** be "a lot of extra engine work".
---
Dosen't change the fact that SoF was the first real MTX and was P2W, cheap or not.
---
This is as much a mtx as runefest events are for also unlocking cosmetics
---
Moms credit card
---
I know.
---
I do reach out but they don‚Äôt reply. They only hit me up when they need something hence why I called them ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.
---
There really is no ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù when its not an exclusive deal.
---
Honestly it took me 3 days of average play time to get full void / 1250 points. I can see where you are coming from, but seeing as it didn‚Äôt take that long, I really don‚Äôt mind the system we have in place. But then again I am not taking into account getting multiple sets/using the points for experience.
---
Pay $11
---
Just a pointer, using gay as an insult isn't really cool. It's never nice seeing something you are being used as a negative.
---
Yeah, with partnership
---
You mean when everything looked like it was was Kade from dirty clay?
---
I love you, Serene! &lt;3
---
Lonesome Road takes the cake though my guy.
---
If you think dev team for osrs is anything like the staff for rs2 you‚Äôre dumb as a rock
---
Obviously they mess up a lot in their offical posts, but forgetting to mention that the content they are polling is locked behind paying for 3rd party services does scream intentional to me. 
---
Especially when even the osrs jmods make fun of rs3 being filled with MTX.
---
what does that mean
---
&gt;that  
---

---
Anyone with 99 RC has not spoken to a single person in years
---
But its not locked. You just get it early that way.
---
You start in lumbridge
---
Yeah and if they want to do that why should it bother me? I level my account for myself and maxing in 2019 won't feel any less rewarding to me than if I did it in 2012. I'm not competing for the highscores because who the hell has time to grind this game 10+hrs a day anymore so I just take my two spins and move on.
---
Quality argument. Surely, this will convince everyone that monetizing content is okay.
---
Almost tempted to downvote for being a jammy bastard
---
Gratz :P
---
This is awesome, was smh?
---
Jagex shill? I‚Äôm almost willing to bet this is how they‚Äôre going to start partnership. It‚Äôs going to start like that then suddenly all bottles of Mountain Dew have codes for cosmetic bullshit. It‚Äôs partnership not advertising, huge difference
---
Just pray and don't mess up
---
That shits on your skin for life bro
---
Says cosmetic partnership didn't happen.
---
Proves it did happen.
---
It never happened!
---
OK yeah it never happened.
---
Aim for quest cape, all content will be unlocked and you will be avle to do every content in the game except raids, for that join a discord group wich focuses on raids learn it and enjoy the game. Sorry for English
---
Pretty good day I'd say
---
Made my poor Surface hot af, was smh
---
OP has the dum
---
You would think they would create object oriented systems for things like teleportation rings, so that you can just add item ids to the current system, but they look like they might just have a shitstorm of code all over the place
---
would suck to add existing content to stuff like that
---
Ya don‚Äôt need any brews to finish unless ya fingers get nervous.
---
How did it go?
---
4 vissies in 2k kc here hehehehuehe
---
Jagex: No, Were mad at you.
---
You‚Äôre a rapper
---
thought of one that wasnt on that list, edited it :D
---
They‚Äôre all pretty amazing in their own ways, the difficulty of dead money is what makes it the best for me especially how you start with nothing.
---
One of my favorites yet.
---
Let us smack enemies with it, as a crush weapon
---
Looking through your posts and comments you don‚Äôt even seem 16 to me..
---
They didnt have to bring back an old version. So Wreck3d went through a lot of hoops to give us a chance at osrs
---
They should also have polled it as one question not as a ton of different ones, the question of partnerships should be answered first before bringing up what rewards would be
---
Yes, OSRS does not get enough developers/artists.  Their point was partnerships would help with bringing in OSRS specific revenue that they can use to justify bringing in more resources.  
---
The OSRS is the little brother trying to get out from under RS3's shadow in the eyes of corporate.  They're treated like a side project and they don't get the resources they need.  They proposed using promotions as a tool to get those resources so they could deliver stuff like PoH skins, which consume a lot of time for just a pure cosmetic.
---
Fucking hell y'all can be dense.
---
We must dig deeper, we are onto something
---
No one offered MTX
---
And that's about the time she walked away from me

Nobody likes you when you're 23

And are still more amused by TV shows
---
What the hell is ADD?
---
My friends say I should act my age
---
What's my age again?
---
You dont have to start over with a new account but if you wanted to create a new one, it would be a refresher and allow you to explore all areas of the game old and new content alike. I feel lime doing this would make it easier for you to learn about new content on your own because when you run into new content you can look it up on the wiki or youtube. You know, like running into content instead of looking for it.
---
Yeah osrs alone makes at least 10 million a year just from membership. Plus additional bonds that people buy. It's honestly ridiculous that we have so little on the content team
---
what do they allege you did to get the mute
---
Yeah we are. Unless you have been entirely ignorant of the osrs dev team and assume its the same as rs2
---
From the very beginning I always wanted cosmetics to be unlocked from playing the game, it would have made so much more sense and would have overall been better for the integrity of the game (RS3), but sadly Jagex don't see things in the same light
---
I would play the shit out of pest control if there were pets.
---

You bring up cosmetics not bringing new players to the game, as if that has any relevancy whatsoever. Cosmetics are in game content. Whatsay Jagex decide to set a month aside to expand osrs' cosmetics range as the main content release for said month, with player contributions and polled decisions. Instantaneously you have catered to a portion of consumers who appreciate a variety of cosmetics.
---
At the end you minimise MTX as being a p2w concern, when that is but one element that composes what MTX is in games. Maybe people would just like one fucken avenue away from corporate branding.
---
Also fuck Jagex management and fuck Sween, loud and clear. Your financial reports are available for viewing, we know this is not a necessity. New players arn't going to hang around because they can have a different skin colour or hairstyle. Theres plenty enough reason to play osrs if you enjoy the style of game it is.
---
They said they were closing the poll because the results were so far skewed that leaving it open wouldn‚Äôt have changed the end result. They also said that any future partnerships (they mentioned Twitch and Discord as two they would think of doing) would be polled and that they are only going to try and poll ones that make sense for the player base and the game in general

You again... is this what post max RS is like?

You know that when you die you don‚Äôt need to get a completely new set, right?

Please answer this fucking question, but how the hell does offering a purple skin or poh theme bring in new players?? There's absolutely no logic there. If you have never heard of runescape, but you happen to have twitch prime, why would you decide to play the game after being offered a useless cosmetic item? I don't understand. It seems like they are trying to use this argument to justify the partnership and it doesn't actually make sense. 
---
I've never played world of warcraft. If they partnered with twitch prime and offered me a special in game mount, how would that motivate me to play the game?? I don't know shit about wow, and I don't even know what a mount does or why I would want one. That wouldn't at all motivate me to play a new game. I think that argument is bullshit.

---
Completely know how you feel... I think I spent near 2 years on official pvp servers before I realised that it's a huge waste of time. Not only because of the sleep-deprived inducing grind, large amount of game-breaking bugs, exploits and power creeps, but the toxic/narcissistic average player mentality. It's even worse when you be-friend a guy (or allied tribe) who you learn to trust over the weeks or months, working together and helping each other out, just for them to suddenly betray you and take all you have. Crazy game lol, but I did have some good experiences as well, to be fair.

Partnership ‚â† MTX
---
As long as they don't give any sort of in game content for the partnership or put other company's logos/links in game, I see no issue with it.
---
An example of this would be a gaming computer company sponsoring deadman mode tournaments. That or any partnership where the only reward is free membership.
---
Did you not read the blogpost? I totally get that the tone of the post was subjective, and I see why some think it was condescending while others dont. But they literally and explicitly said they will be trying again in some other way in the last paragraph. Not sure how you could think its over with unless you didn't read the blogpost

Don't worry Jagex, some of us aren't worried about MTX for cosmetics, and you should hold those ideas until you can push for MTX. Sorry the community is dumb and hive minds with their tinfoil hats.

MTX in any form were only implemented less than a year before 2013, and 2013 is the exact year bonds were introduced in RS3. Until 2015 OSRS had half RS3's concurrent player numbers and no bonds so the turnaround after 2013 is clearly owed to RS3 MTX which kept Jagex afloat and allowed OSRS to get kicking. (You're welcome!) Also the downsize in 2014-2015 was a result of Jagex shutting down Transformers Universe. You're clueless, buddy. The irony indeed.
---
Yes, every one who plays the game is perpetually stuck at 9 years old. That's the whole point of osrs.

---
I think the playerbase was dense because the vast majority of arguments I saw for voting no were either built on vague or false assumptions, and intentional misrepresentation of what was being offered.
---
a) the paywall is a false assumption (a partnership could be just "log in on mobile and get a skin color")
---
b) To the people saying "But my in game achievement", the partnership is what lets them justify spending the needed time on the cosmetic in the first place.  And the team carefully avoided equipables and pets because they know full well the value of those items as showing your achievements.  Saying PoH skins should be a diary reward is all fine and well but Jagex has repeatedly made the point its hard for them to justify allocating resources to a POH skin when the artists are needed on bigger content.  
---
c) They were extremely explicit that any promotional content would be free for all members after the promotion ended.  This is the biggest misrepresentation I saw and why I firmly believe this wasn't MTX and was okay with what Jagex was doing.  All the promotional content would come free to all members.  People immediately jumped to the conclusion that they would start making us sign up for Audible to get a house theme and threw out the window the fact that after a month or two they would get the house theme anyways.  
---
Their proposal did sound like MTX, but if you took a second to really think about what they were offering it was quite reasonable.  Nothing would actually be locked behind a paywall, we got final say on what was an acceptable cosmetic for the game and what wasnt, and everything was being done above board.  They weren't trying to be sneaky or hide MTX.  The OSRS team was well aware it sounded a lot like RS3 MTX and explicitly state their intent to never go down that road.  If you took away polling every cosmetic, or all members getting it for free then sure would've been awful for the game.  But they were quite clear that they had no intention to lock content behind a paywall, would keep additions consistent with the art style, and would give us final say in what gets added in the first place.  In return, they were promising growth for the game.  And the most prominent arguments against it deliberately ignored these facts and decided that the word "promotion" was synonymous with RS3 style MTX.  I saw posts on the front page claiming RS3 started out as "just cosmetics" and we needed to fight it, when that was a blatant lie.  RS3 started with buyable SoF spins as the very first update where you could spend extra money on the game.  But people ate up the lie that it was just cosmetics at first.  All that to say, yeah I think the playerbase is dense.
---
And this atrocious picture is also the reason I don‚Äôt want more stupid cosmetics added to the game
---
Maybe it is you who should open your eyes sweety. You are obviously completely oblivious, but still you keep commenting, when you are not to any degree, willing to listen.

That's what I'm saying, they may see other people splashing but that doesn't mean they have to splash themselves. They have choices like you've suggested. It's a bad way to train mage for sure but for people on mobile who are at work and can't pay as much attention then splashing is better than not playing at all. The journey you choose is what makes it fun, don't just follow other people's methods blindly :)
---
this comment right here officer
---
Because they said that about RS3
---
He woke himself up?
---
Cosmetic MTX is completely less damaging to the game than literally being able to buy gold.
---
But Jagex have no way of stopping RWT, so when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.
---
You must be terrible at everything you do, because you assume people are just good, when it's all about practice.
---
What's the difference dumbass? They are both locked.
---
So? The same could be said here. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm both cases the new player experience is now completely fucked by these people
---
Lmao at people saying bonds are the same thing. Having cosmetics in the game that is only obtainable by paying real money and paying real money for gold a player have obtained trough playing the game. It's not the same thing.
---
It wouldnt have been exclusive...
---
Literally just for the reason that jagex needs to FOLLOW THE RESULTS OF THE POLLS AND NOT HIDE THEM 
---
I am entirely supportive of polling this idea. 
---
We need to hold them accountable for their actions. If they poll something, and it fails, then it should fail. They shouldn't get a free pass to circumvent the democracy and player established votes that made this game what it is.
---
You forgot the 1/2 jug of wine :p
---
I am disappointed in the community as to how negatively it has responded to this. Everyone jumping on the bandwagon rather than thinking logically here.
---
I'm 106
---
Bonds are still microtransactions and grossly pay to win. They should be removed too
---
Those are all bosses. Most bosses have a minature pet version of the boss as a very rare drop. There are no bosses in pest control. You click the portal and wait. Nearly all pets are tied to a boss or a skill. The one exception is maybe the chompy chick, but I think the devs put that in with the idea that you unlock and easy pet with an elite diary idk
---
Hey, at least you were honest!
---
you dont unlock those from playing the game, theyre automatically unlocked. i think those are bad too, the runefest ones are more acceptable because at least its an event about the game though
---
It‚Äôs not zammy wine though, it‚Äôs just regular ‚Äújug of wine‚Äù that I find on them.
---
Or player is herself a girl and calls her girl friends girlfriends.
---
It was literally not polled at all
---
I find it really hard to believe they would do the same thing twice. In the long term they would be losing money, which they dont want.
---
&gt; I don't want the feeling that I need to go back and do it because I didn't get the pet.
---
It's not about the cosmetics or how they look. It's about this being a road most of us have been down before. RS3 did the same thing. First it was just a couple cosmetics here and there. Then it was auras. Then it was straight up gear and exp. 
---
It is a slippery slope and if you give Jagex the OK to add MTX cosmetics, they will keep going.
---
yo I'd love to get a pub room to make in the POH?? Maybe each tap would have a different effect and you can use it in POH only for combat ring battles, or something

For you its a horrid waste of time. It wasn't on this scale because mobile didn't exist. Your opinion on a garbage training method doesn't speak for everyone. People who afk at work can splash for some xp rather than no xp. Calling these people garbage is once again your own opinion and adds nothing to to the discussion.

---
&gt;Oh boy.. Here we go again.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Before  bonds were introduced, over half of the playerbase (according to Jagex) was at least once engaged in RWTing. Huge chunk of playerbase has bought rsgp at some point of their playtime. Jagex cant ban their entire playerbase, so they did one of the smartest moves ever when they introduced the bonds.
---
I understand the need for them, but you can not call them anything but mtx. 
---
&gt;Bonds work on supply/demand, and they dont add anything into the game. Unlike in Rs3 you get xp and materials and armor with MTX.
---
But in the end it's almost the same isn't it? No inflation, yes you're correct. However this transaction does get me increased xP rates (eg: buying bond = easy to pay for bursting) and armor. 
---
If everyone started to rwt bonds, they would crash - but it doesn't affect the principle that a new, rich player, is able to get in game currency by swiping their CC. 
---
&gt;Bonds killed 80% (Once again, according to Jagex) of all RWT businesses with driving prices down.
---
This is good - but RWT is definitely still alive, otherwise we wouldn't have the bot/Venezuelan problem as we do
---
&gt;And it never was about useless cosmetics, it was all about Jagex trying to monetize the game with cosmetics. They can add all cosmetics into the game all they want, just not ask extra noney for them. 
---
I get where people are coming from - but to Me this seemed less game impacting than bonds/rwt overall
---
You just get all your hardware/software illegally or have the game developed in your mind?
---
Neat, much obliged
---
found a splasher. there's nothing to discuss. what wizard gets better at magic by *never landing a spell*?
---
it needs removed. jagex won't remove it because they fear of backlash from removing an ezscape afk training method that they don't even honestly support. they're weening players off it. it wont be long and you'll actually have to cast spells to train again.
---
If someone can‚Äôt find 30 seconds of their day to reply to you, even just to say ‚Äòsorry been busy will reply when I get chance‚Äô then are they really someone you want around anyway?
---
We can already buy and sell bonds for gold which is way worse as a mtx than these cosmetics would have been, and everyone would have gotten it for free after a month
---
Salad robes*
---
lmfao
---
I think people are looking way too deep into the 'tone' of the message. They sounded disappointed to me. That's it. But they still listened and gave us what we asked for.
---
Diary scrub detected
---
That's surreal that was actually on TV as an ad.
---
Because jagex is one company, and companies tend to devote resources where returns are expected? How are you missing this point? 
---
RS3 make lot money, RS3 get big team.
---
Then that stupid furry mod came in and gave us a pride stole. Stupid shit head
---
This is fair - I do believe that bonds fly you through early levels though.
---
I want the Zamorak tele animation and the dramatic point emote
---
so, it was hubris?

I found it really hard to believe they could fuck up RS2
---
Go claim your mohawk grenades. I'm mr. T and I'm a night elf mohawk!

Well boys we did it, MTX is no more
---
They tell you a lot of useful information, though
---
whoooooooosh.
---
I agree
---
Hence why I called them ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. The comment I was replying to was about not having any friends.
---
After you already paid would be pretty wild
---
I literally have my windows mixer on 6 for OSRS, and on minimum it's ok. On max it drowns out everything else. 
---
At 6.
---
But one of those parties is supposed to be professional.
---
Because we saw this exact same blog post in 2011 and our criticisms were met with "slippery slope fallacy bro" and look how that turned out for rs3
---
Here's an idea. If people like house themes, then why not make it a quest series reward? Make up some kind of quest series that revolves around the Construction skill and the real estate agents. Just add a home portal and estate agent to Morytania, make up a quest for that guy, and the theme will be part of your reward. 
---
I could see it now. The agent lives in Burgh De Rot and you must have completed In Aid of the Myrque. The main goal of the quest is to help him build a home portal. Naturally, the inherent dangers of living in Morytania make that more challenging.
---
Bow, to the lord of edge.
---
&gt; If you wanted them to be diplomatic, then you guys should have been diplomatic.

I was hoping someone would set up a bot army in lumby f2p spamming not to play the game because mtx are coming
---
Hell yeah. First thing I got when I became a member.
---
I'm having flashbacks to the Fine Brothers fiasco.
---
I can't think of a single use anywhere in the game where this would be useful. I'm not bashing it completely but maybe help me out?
---
Yep, it's an MTX but it's generally not a source of outrage because you can always RWT gold anyways.
---
They have customers. You can't blame them, either.
---
Doh!
---
Yes true and they kept updating the game to make it easier, which is NICE for new players but devalues the gains of older players. Like if you had all 99‚Äôs in 2004 compared to someone who made a new account in 2013 and had all 99‚Äôs by 2014. Idk. Different points of view, but it‚Äôs still easier with Runespan and bonfires and stuff
---
It‚Äôs not overpowered it‚Äôs just cheap.
---
Heyyy zain, fancy seeing you here
---
Jagex, do it just to spite this fuckwad.
---
can you post the loot tab would be thicc
---
Lol they absolutely are. Can't really blame people for being paranoid but I feel jagex are being honest in the post
---
It is, though people could RWT to buy gold anyway.  Bonds are generally accepted since they allow people to play without paying $11, and some RWTers at least support Jagex rather than bot farms.
---
Yeah, but it was worded as "Atleast 130 a year" when in reality it cant cost anymore than $132 for membership on 1 account for a year. So why type "atleast" when that is completely untrue as there are literally 3 ways to pay for  years membership that costs less (4x3 month, 2x 6 month or 12 month all cheaper than the price he stated was minimum"
---
yeah stick morytania house theme behind morytania easy, and walk the new players through the process of doing that. Hell I bet Settled would do a walkthrough side by side on youtube to help out.
---
Personally, I thought their response to this shit show was more than diplomatic enough. 
---
But why do you feel that a bunch of anonymous neckbeards spewing hateful garbage should be coddled and praised? That's some real entitled shit right there man.
---
Yeah, but they packaged it in a poll so you had to vote for bonds + f2p, or no bonds + no f2p.
---
Since f2p was so popular, it's not hard to see why it went through even though bonds are controversial. I heard that bonds were a condition because they needed to offset the cost of free f2p servers.
---
Ok 
---
LoL = Entirely Free to play, no subscription services to buy, you can freely buy cosmetics or nothing at all, you can buy every champion solely through play. Nothing in the game is locked aside from cosmetics, you can play any game mode or champion at any time if you want to, there is no requirement to pay anything.
---
OSRS = Has a free mode which locks a majority of the game but also has a subscription service which unlocks all of the game for you. You can pay to access everything. Majority of skills are locked, majority of quests are locked, majority of the map is locked.
---
They are completely different monetization systems,  LoL was free from the get go, OSRS was subscription based for the whole game from the get go, it has a free mode which was intended as a trial mode, as it locks like 70% of the game, adding cosmetics to OSRS is mixing the two together and is being greedy. Why would i pay a subscription fee to OSRS to only then have to pay them more money for cosmetics when they should just be given to me through my original subscription.
---
Its like subscribing to the washington post to only then find out i need to pay them an additional 5 bucks to access their references for stories they do, like why am i paying a subscription in the first place?
---
I don't think i can put it any simpler, and at this point i'm not even entirely sure what you're trying to prove or point out, maybe you could elaborate on that.
---
That's true, at that level its just a couple mil for all that, so if they wanna give money to the game I play? Sure, better for me, love it. But it would still take knowledge to know to buy that stuff. So a new player would blow it on stupid stuff.
---
True, you dont want to affect the 16 people who play UIM.
---
Beyond petty of them. Funny how easy it is to break the fragile trust. Now they have to learn how to earn trust after burning the player base and attempting to do so again.
---
The mega tribes can't be wiped out realistically because their resources are too heavily diversified across different servers.  Actually bringing them down is functionally impossible
---
Tell me how I'm wrong.
---
You wish you had that much power.
---
They would all be perfectly fitting rewards for elite diaries imo. A token to show you've "mastered" any specific area.
---
isnt that c engineer?
---
It happens, there are different levels of megas, and sometimes bigger ones hunt them down. But at the least, there are server wipes relatively often
---
....which in turn makes it overpowered.
---
I had a lot of fun on w45, yeah its dead but you kind of get to know people because of it. The player base was similar in size to a high school class. You would get familiar with most other players. It's true a few top players kind of run the server, but it's kinda fun to play hide and seek with Pkers, I would add players known for pking to see when they log on, and when certain players logged on people would call it out on cc so you could get to safety. Its a weird meta but I had a good time. I also got my first 99 on that server (I know it doesn't really count, but it was a big accomplishment for me). Also when I played there was no GE and the economy felt a lot more like the old days, lots of rag gear and weird sets. If you start getting bored of OSRS I would recommend trying it.
---
Buy 3 months of members so you can get all the quests and skills done. Then focus on sustaining bonds.
---
With your stats you will likely spend most of your time working to sustain your bond which is hardly fun
---
The discussion was why it's being removed and why it bothers people so much. So yes this is a discussion. If you want to be hypothetical the wizard that practices casting the spell rather than hurting people with it. In theory he would get better as practice makes perfect. But that's irrelevant just like your argument. It won't be long and you'll have to cast high alch instead of CASTING wind strike on a rat* fixed it for you. With your mind set skills like fletching cooking mining Woodcutting Agility theiving hunter etc. Are all garbage skills for garbage people because you can afk them.
---
I don't own a spade.
---
If by ‚Äúdifferent servers‚Äù you mean ‚Äúthose Chinese fuckers‚Äù, then yes. (Anyone who plays Ark know what this means)
---
I'd like to hope that nobody on staff is unprofessional enough to take passionate negative reactions from players personally.
---
Vetoes are part of the creative process. That's okay.
---
It amazes me how Jagex has convinced everyone that bonds are a good thing. 
---
Making money is a part of the game, it determines how you train. When you can buy the fastest xp rates with real life money, it's pay to win in the one of the biggest ways it can be. Regardless of technicalities.
---
Straight outta 2007 with the anti gay bs

No worries guys, no partnerships!  In completely unrelated news, $13/mo.
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
I wouldn't say we have a right to be _excredingly_ demanding, as that's just unwarranted entitlement.  
---
OSRS is an interesting case though, this content deployment model is unprecedented on this scale so parties all around need to be patient.   
---
Make no mistake, this was a victory for the community. At the same time though, we NEED to be able to trust Jagex going forward and that's going to take work from the players and the company.  
---
Being passive aggressive is no way to go, but this was a pretty measured response based on how the community itself reacted.  
---
We may not like it, but it was completely deserved.   
---
They reiterated their stance in such a way because it's clear the community didn't understand what their goal was (which was 100% their fault still).  
---
They're salty, just like the community was salty. We can't give it and not take it, we can't ignore the way we act out of entitlement and  a sense of community justice. If we want to be respected by Jagex, we need to be constructive and respect Jagex.
---
We all do we play osrs.
---
Never forget the classic EOC poll where they classed everything above "I don't want EOC I hate it ree" as positive and said 80% of the community wanted it lol
---
I can't take anyone who uses the "muh medieval aesthetic" argument anyway because this game already has an irreverent tone. Half the lore is fucking puns lol
---
Lol, my tribe got raided at one point by a Chinese mega tribe, we had 4 people online, they had 66
---
OSRS currently brings in more than RS3 without an MTX. Why are you raging and just spewing random bullshit. Just fuck off and go play FIFA if playing osrs without pay to win is a bit too challenging for you.
---
Locked implies its unavailable indefinitely, such as your own example, membership content is locked behind membership. AKA, you can't access it unless you pay, ever.
---
Early access is again, access before everybody else, but everybody else will have access.
---
Your own example contradicts yourself.

Took me a while to realize this also got up to like 96 without knowing you can spam click herb patches for faster harvest. .. wish runescape told you things
---
Uhhhhhh.....
---
Have seen you guys do some stupid shit over the past few years this was once again top tier.
---
Finally a post about something else than MTX, kuddos to this dude :)
---
If you have Verzik experience then just grind it out and get get. Seeing a 1 instead of a 0 won‚Äôt make me take someone to ToB anyway.
---
And the only reason they put a shitton of new clue rewards was new beginner clues which was done to get new players stick with the game and to get f2p players go p2p. So it can be justified as a spending to make more money. Morytania POH theme can't and doesn't bring in money.
---
Is there a die that only rolls splashes?
---
Well to be fair. Theres a new original cintent post then 100 people copy it and 2 guys draw really bad art about it. Thats how this board functions
---
Glad others are making posts about Jagex's update. The language inside their post was sprinkled with passive aggressiveness towards the player base for their reactions to their MTX (sorry, "partnership") proposal.

Good luck playing an internet game without supporting the businesses that brought you your hardware, that sell you internet access, that made the game, and that sell you electricity to power it all.  You can say "fuck you" all you want, but you can only even say that to me thanks to a number of business that connect us here on Reddit.  It's the American way to be ignorant as fuck too.
---
Bonds are microtransactions. the point of acceptance is that the are either exchanged for gold or membership. gold can be acquired ingame and membership can be bought for real money. bonds enable players to buy membership with ingame gold. so all points together, it's fine that bonds exist, because all sides benefit. jagex gets more money off of 2 weeks of membership. the bond-seller gets gold. the bond buyer gets 2 weeks of membership for "free".
---
those proposed changes are something entirely different. they benefit jagex and those, who "buy" them. the important thing is that nobodys experience gets worse, but the experience of some few people (who pay) gets better (kind of). so not all sides benefit, which is the main issue with this one, i think.
---
and no to lootboxes or any other kind of scummy implementation of mtx.
---
Welcome to the last 14 deadman modes and the last 3.5 years of it.
---
Don‚Äôt call me Clown, Mustache!
---
That's beneficial to UIM, because PC sucks.
---
Ive been selling the loot fund 99's and also to pay for my gear.. sorry
---
It is a subscription base game, if you keep players interested in your game, they will remain subbed. It does bring money.
---
Well that was rude :(
---
Wtf I always remembered it being around 13m
---
You'd have to spend well over $4,000 to even get all the bis. It is expensive asf and no normal whale is paying that much. Only the mega turbovirign whales will pay that, and there are not many of them.
---
Still looks less retarded than people who buy vape/supreme/etc

The fuck does vault boy have to do with the Duel Arena?

He was clearly trying to turn in the steel sefender wtf are you on???
---
?? Do you understand what a partnership is? How does this promote Discord and how does it make money for both Discord and Jagex?
---
Unnecessary account security bullshit that only know-it-alls care about.
---
If the bots are dumb enough to follow you then you can lead them to the dark wizards
---
Alch your arm
---
No, you're blindly assuming more things. I said that if any payment was done, it would be from Jagex not to them, but there probably wasn't even any payment. Also, it very obviously wouldn't be 11 dollars. Do you have any concept of business deals?
---
I think I know what you're going through. I had a friend and we were incredibly close. Talked everyday the entire day about anything and everything and it was never boring. We meant a lot to each other for years. And then one day she met some guy, and it's like I disappeared from her life. She would text me like once a week or less, it was extremely boring and felt fake, like she wasn't talking to me anymore, she was just talking in general. The friendship just died, disappeared in one night, yet she's still there. Told her about the situation but nothing got better. Made me feel used as if I was a place holder "boyfriend" for 6 years. Friends can break your heart just as much as your significant other. Shit is hard to move on from but time does it's thing. And runescape was a good distraction. Just focused on leveling up skills and that's it.
---
Highest all time profit ever for the company yeah they are hurting real bad you Dick suck
---
xp waste
---
To be fair i never eat during the actual jad fight O.O
---
&gt;Rookie mistake to train near the door :/
---
&gt;You're supposed to go all the way back, so they run past all the cyclopes and get aggro'd.
---
&gt;Also bring a range weapon + ammo, can "splash" the npc forever (range does no damage in Warrior guild) and stay in combat with plenty of time to x-log...
---
&gt;Tl;dr  play smarter not harder!
---
I don't play DMM anymore so no idea if they fixed it. Used to see people all the time stand as far away from the door as possible and if they got attacked they'd drop all their tokens and tank for 60 seconds and be teleported to freedom on the other side of the door
---
To be fair the razer deathadder is an amazing mouse lol
---
Fair enough man I probably will tbh I love the sub but it‚Äôs just sooo annoying
---
Does that make it okay? Ive never bothered with Deadman myself, as i work full time. 
---
Without taking time away from work, their is literally 0 point in trying. That stops growth and kills the fun of it.
---
Bang! End em
---
That explains all the red dots next to the door, and none further away :)
---
the point is that these pseudo-microtransactiony things here are the start of a very slippery slope. this partnership stuff in itself as described is not that bad. but it's the potential beginning of something really really bad. look at rs3. loyalty system was kinda free-ish and purely cosmetic as well and hadn't a option to buy additional points, if i remember correctly. But that was just the start. Once they smell money and stuff...
---
&gt;Tfw complaining about being atked on dmm or complaining about a clan using 5-8 people in a place with a billion aggro npcs.
---
He's complaining about people in basically maxed gear killing new players
---
Nice cheese cape LOOL
---
you can see the compressed pixels from how many times this has been reposted. Thats a pretty good sign that enough people have seen it. that being said, I got dibs on the next three reposts
---
You could wear an octopus as a helmet in pre eoc
---
Personally... implemented properly, with less intrusive things, why not?
---
Also why not build a toggle promo skins button in game. One game i play has that and makes it so nice not to see all the clown skins, but at the same time the people who like that sorta thing, can. 
---
In reality though... i trust jagex at this point to honor their word and everything will be polled, so i‚Äôm not worried about full blown mtx disaster. But I am however worried about cool cosmetics becoming too easy to get. When some could be achievements.
---
If i have a sense of humor can i still succc no homo though. don‚Äôt be sorry sir have a good day
---
Yeah, capitalism is really the main force driving MTX into osrs. If it wasn't for capitalism we wouldn't have to push back as a community so hard.
---
want to talk numbers? its fun that you chose the years where rs3 had spill-over effects from osrs's success.
---
2013: profit 381k
---
2014: profit 1145k
---
and once OSRS has become succesfull and got attention back to their game... RECORD NUMBERS
---
2015: 23.6m
---
2016: 28.8m
---
Had it not been for OSRSs introduction and revitalization of the runescape brand then Jamflex wouldve struggled to continue.
---
Its fun that they even explicitly mention in their 2016 financial statement that they are all-in on OSRS and even actively developing an e-sports scene. RS3 is constantly losing players and in 2018 they were at their lowest - even during EOC they had more players ( i did not bother to compare 2018 with 2019). 
---
Even with OSRS Jamflex had to reduce their headcount significantly. God forbid even thinking about their staff numbers in 2019 with only RS3.
---
I always liked the small customization like the mutagens and Slayer helm re-colors. Just added rewards of luck, no gp or irl cash involved just good ole fashion drop rate RNG.
---
Remind me again how this is any different than [this](https://imgur.com/l6s7hCA)?
---
I think $11 is plenty
---
Download octopus on the play store
---
Thank me later
---
*gets shat on*
---
Oh my, such a big boy :)
---
You do not have enough Air Runes to cast this spell.
---
Nice! Yeah that is definitely a good option if being attacked by a solo player or a duo+ who didn't think things through.
---
A bigger team can leave a pker outside, so probably better to switch to range on your current cyclopes and x-log, for those...
---
pic pl0x
---
Imagine playing rs where after you cut 1k yew logs you turn them all in and you get 300 back.

Takes me like 55 minutes on a slayer task with BP. 95 range and decent gear

Thanks! Found it!

‚Äò‚ÄôStaking takes skill‚Äô‚Äô - Jagex, 2015
---
It wouldn't allow you to skip the quest 'Underground Pass'. It was so that you could skip going through it an unnecessary second time in the next quest, 'Regicide'.
---
tl;dr you repeat yourself more and miss every point I wrote.
---
Not wasting my time with a reply, have a good day man.
---
&gt; Tl;dr play smarter not harder!

It's mika lol. The only reason he does as well as he does in tourney is his insane hours and dedication

Sure, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but uneducated opinions are worth less.

Soundcloud stans be like:
---
charge me 20, fuck it
---
This one is high quality
---
Sometimes the art is a bit fancier than usual but to claim that the recent additions have ‚Äúsoiled the integrity of the game‚Äôs art‚Äù is ridiculous. The art of this game prior to OSRS was always incredibly inconsistent due to the high turnover of artists as the game‚Äôs art style was very limited.
---
UIM :) Can't put everything in a looting bag every trip or take half the essence.
---
Lol scared no, worries yes
---
Yes, but if they now capitalized on the increased free2play players, and such, they could justify even lowering the sub price.
---
Dude, nothing in what you just quoted supports your claim.
---
Do you really want those players in our player base, fucking our polls? Players who are willing to spend money on items they could get for free? IF we manage to retain the kind of players this brings in, into our grindy ass game (a big if), then I doubt our game will exist like this much longer .
---
being deragatory does not equal having a good sense of humor. it rather shows that you can only have fun at the cost of someone else.
---
Two wooshes, one thread. You rarely see it
---
Is karils worth using without the whole set ? Sorry very new
---
Just look at barbarian assault. Plenty of peope going for queen pet.
---
Fine. As I said, complain about that specifically then.
---
&gt;If you have an issue with how they try to create those profits, then fine, complain about that.
---
The person I replied to framed all growth and longevity as something that's negative in the context of a business, which is a poor way to look at it, because continual growth is what makes businesses last.
---
I love this idea mate, but as someone with over $5k worth of ink on their body, the execution of this is a bummer. 
---
Always pay a professional, idc how good your buddy is. Tell him you use synthetic skin until he is actually good. 
---
Again, love the concept, hate the outcome.
---
Dog
---
Not sure why you think that's relevant to what I said. My comment was made specifically to explain the flaw in that guy's logic and how he shouldn't interpret him personally insulting someone and being downvoted for it as "I can't go against the hive mind".
---
It's OK, passive aggression goes over my head sometimes too
---
......cos he‚Äôs asian?
---
that tree looks like it's wrapped in a giant piece of duct tape, that is all.
---
But it does have MTX, and quite a big one. If you tell your anti-MTX friend about bonds, he's not going to play OSRS. Jagex saying OSRS has no MTX would be false advertising.
---
yikers island
---
Didn't they expand the company quite a lot with that "highest all time profit"?
---
Well they did.  They did invest back into their business and their products.  And we've seen some pretty big content updates lately.  That's what the money is going to.  And yet here you are, angry that they're making money in the first place, despite what we as consumers are getting in return.  You're really quick to ignore the updates when you think they're making too much money.
---
It's as if they have to be going broke AND be giving you want you want for you to be happy.  You're clearly not in business for a good reason, you'd run a business into the ground.
---
What you said only applies to the methods that Jagex is using to attain profit, which I said is something you should complain about specifically. The person I replied to framed all profits and growth as a bad thing, which I disagreed with.
---
There is a general stigma against making profit here, when in reality it should be a stigma against lazy methods of making profits (ie: MTX).
---
I never understood why people try to buy in-game bonds to sustain their memberships. It‚Äôs clearly more time efficient (unless totally endgame content at maxed combat) to spend $11 per month in real money. It‚Äôs just not worth playing 5-15hrs of game time to outweigh 1-2 hours of minimum wage to pay for the same outcome. 
---
Play smart, not hard
---
Not sure why you're being down voted, I too am extremely curious
---
GP is 0 EHP, so it's basically throwing away money
---
Bruh. I made no claim to a safe space. 
---
I think what you did was wrong and I articulated why.
---
Second guys outfit doesn't look too much like a cosmetic overload of the four of them though
---
Yeah 1 kill trips in veracs, then sweaty af running back when you had to tele out when kq 2nd form was on like 4hp to make sure you got the drop.
---
Perhaps try out blast furnace with steel bars
---
Why did you repost this diaper ass travesty
---
Show your source. Change my mind.
---
I love how happy he looks :D
---
No shit this is the entire point of the controversy
---
&gt; Though quests may feature fixed rewards, other loot, such as weapons and armor, may be **generated for the player based on the player-character's level, the quest's level, their performance in the quest, and other random factors**.
---
Replace 'player-character's level with kill count, and you've got exactly what I've described.
---
So basically we're funding whales who buy bonds, bringing even more whale money into the game? Kinda genius from Jagex's end
---
It doesnt matter how much, bonds are a massive form of mtx and give great advantage to those who do buy them. Bonds are 100% unfair and I‚Äôm very sad you can basically buy gold but straight from jagex. People however will always buy gold and bonds are better than the alternative.
---
SLAYER ??????????????????? LOLOLOLOLOL
---
Scary how similar your name is to the name of the person he's trading
---
don't forget who owns you.
---
Elaborate on that, if you're able to.
---
Lumbridge is literally the tutorial area though. If tutorials are moronic there then I don't even know what isn't.
---
Let's compare it with meat pie. You can find beef and rat meat in Lumbridge. Heck, even the bear is closer to starting area than the berries.
---
Having redberries by Varrock still makes sense since cadava berries grow there as well. I'm not looking to delete those.
---
Also allotments. I do Snape grass w herb runs for crazy xp
---
So a company is forced to limit their revenue to one stream, or they're malicious/bad? I don't like MTXs any more than the next person, but that's a pretty ridiculous thing to say.
---
osrs has reached  enough popularity to attract attention from old rich greedy fucks to sink their teeth in and not let go.
---
I agree with what you're saying, but the problem is we can't trust Jagex after what they did to RS3. Give them an inch, they'll take a mile. During the start of RS3's MTX, they gave the same promises of "it will only be cosmetics", and "you won't be able to buy xp"... Well, look at its state now.
---
Also, like the guy you replied to explained, the statement of "you'll be able to get everything in game" can be taken very lightly. Treasure hunter xp lamps in RS3 provide rewards which can also be obtained in game, simply by training the skill for... MANY hours.
---
isnt that game free to play
---
Cept a substantial amount of the loyal playerbase would quit if this kind of shit gets pushed through, so the new players argument is a bit of a moot point.
---
Yeah the roots of this problem are really:
---
1. Black d'hides are cheap 
---
2. Ranged is overpowered in the combat triangle
---
This change addresses neither of those core issues.
---
But you wouldn't have to sell 7000
---
r/mildlyracist?
---
meh. It would happen regardless and bonds help to regulate the "illegal" gold market and even cut into it some bit. 
---
Buying gold is P2W; but it's *going* to happen with or without Jagex's input. They can either incentivize people to not buy gold through positive means (bonds) or try to heavy hand ban any "ludicrous" trades which would 1.) surely require a large amount of employee's to monitor and 2.) definitely result in a lot of false positives and innocent victims.
---
The only reason high lvls are there is because jagex added a pet drop to a boss that shouldn't have had one. Seems it was added because they didn't want to deal with the risk of having the community cry that there wasn't one to begin with. Damned if they do damned if they don't.
---
Alienating their current playerbase is not the way to do that.
---
Also offering dumb cosmetic goodies to new players isn't a good way of doing that either. You really think an elf themed house or teleport reskin for a god they know nothing about is going to make someone stick with the game?
---
I would absolutely consider "buy in to this promotion to get early access to this content" to be intrusive.
---
&gt;Theyve already done promotions exactly as described, and no one really cared.
---
Plenty of people did. Jmods even recognized that a large portion of the community was opposed to this mechanic. The outrage then may have caused Jagex to poll these going forward. Why else would they poll these, if the purple skin wasn't polled?
---
&gt;You can literally buy in game money with real money, and no one really cares.
---
I know people who do care. Bonds definitely have their downside. The thing is, bonds don't have any exclusive content locked behind them. If you choose not to buy bonds, you don't miss out on anything.
---
If you choose not to buy the purple skin cosmetic, you'll have to wait to get it for free. That's stupid. It should've just been added for free to all existing and new members.
---
&gt; Literally reading comprehension.
---
  For someone getting bent out of shape on that topic, you sure aren't comprehending and filling in the gaps between their statements. "Free to all players at a later date" directly implies that it ISN'T FREE initially. How exactly do you expect for these partnerships to be a source of revenue (as they say they will be in the blog) for Jagex if zero money changes hands? A temporary paywall is still a form of a paywall.
---
I never saw that. Either way I'd oppose that. Rather the game die than see something like that.
---
Early access to optional cosmetic content that basically only the player sees is just about as unintrusive as it can get
---
it makes then boring cause you‚Äôre literally by yourself for 100‚Äôs of kills and hours put in..bossing is 100x more fun with friends. obviously you‚Äôre going to get crashed by max mains at a NEW BOSS. Im a max main with scythe and fucking love slapping that spider silly with the scythe because its new and i never seen it before, but guess what? since im max its time for me to go back to raiding like what most mains are going to be doing jusy give it a bit.
---
Oh wow didn't hear about this. Seems pretty recent by the looks of it. Also can't seem to find any information on platinum fortune. Someone said it might be a translation error. Could they mean platinum equity?
---
Why the fuck would you want to hide your gloves??
---
This looks like the army of the undead from got fucking terrifying
---
Some people are already at it!
---
Happens to me all the time, just tap the brightness scale up or down and it fixes itself.
---
Seems to happen if I open another app like messenger or YouTube
---
You'll be fine after the weekend. The boss isn't that rewarding so once everyone is done trying out the new boss, it'll be empty. There's already starting to be a few empty worlds or worlds where I see like just 1 or 2 lvl 80-110 players.
---
just botted my pure 99 str and range all at sand crabs with $3 bot if you use free bots they suck but a paid bot is so good its undetectable
---
Realistically though you dont need 4 bil to do all the end game content
---
So a few hundred bucks is a lot more reasonable than 7k
---
Literally everyone can see your character's skin color.
---
At 500kc no muta? My sweet summer child...
---
&gt;If you choose not to buy the purple skin cosmetic, you'll have to wait to get it for free. 
---
So you could almost say that if you choose not to buy the purple skin cosmetic, you don't miss out on anything.
---
Then why even spend hours in the game, it doesnt make sense tbh.
---
They didn't give a time frame, a few weeks is your assumption. But even if it's a day, it's about principle. The principle is that no one should have any content before subscribers, that's it.
---
Oof. I hope pet comes your way!
---
new elf quest coming out, biggest content patch in OSRS history and biggest quest so far. Perfect opportunity to release a house skin w/quest or literally *any* of the content coming out.
---
What does jagex do? Offer to release the elf house skin as a promotion. It's just fucking insulting and plain retarded at that point.
---
Bitch I been 99 homo for years now
---
:( it was worth a shot with rng like that lol
---
Lmfao that last pic is from Breezewood, PA. Oh how memes hit home
---
Hey now, don't jump in to stereotyping Americans or you'll end up in the same boat as this fella.
---
Attatching them to diaries would be cool.
---
I think people are wanting them to understand why we didn‚Äôt want it and agree with us rather than being disappointed. Them being disappointed at something we are so passionate about is pretty bad.
---
Imagine I ask you, ‚ÄúHey can I light your house on fire and burn it down?‚Äù And you say ‚Äúfuck no!‚Äù How would you feel if I was genuinely upset that you wouldn‚Äôt let me burn your fucking house to the ground. And then I was like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find a better way to phrase it next time.‚Äù
---
Sure
---
You guys need to go talk with people and innite them to hang out.
---
Would you say that this mass hysteria is a reasonable response to people having to wait to get access to optional cosmetic skins? People are literally saying they will quit the game, that this ruins the game, etc. Can you see how entitled this sounds?
---
Is this little timmy?
---
I like you, you're the one commenter who has a tattoo.
---
Why would you wear the fletching over Ava?
---
Range provides the same accumulating function however.
---
That‚Äôs not really a lot when you consider that you‚Äôre losing 12 hours of time you could be spending making money every time you die.
---
MSB (i), double specing him every time helps speed it up a bit.
---
Devalues my walking around
---
Honestly how can‚Äôt you have $11 a fucking month but you do have enough time to grind runescape? Get your priorities straight lmao.
---
Partnerships between similarly aligned companies to expand the game's influence is definitely comparable to rape /s
---
I could only support a sponsored cosmetics if there was absolutely no payment, purchase, or subscription necessary to receive the cosmetic. Otherwise it's just an indirect microtransaction paid to the sponsor, who would probably give a portion to Jagex.
---
cute
---
Uh excuse me mom said it was my turn to make the same joke for the fiftieth time in two days
---
Getting a sub 40 minutes requires either a tbow, or extensive fight caves experience. How is that casual? You're both fucking stupid. No casual is getting sub 40 minutes with a blowpipe.
---
And jagex isn't going to seize to exist immediately after MTX gets added. But, even if it did there is still someone that owns those copyrights. Just because the company behind the game goes out of business doesn't mean the term becomes free game again. This means you are still at risk of getting a copyright claim if you start using the name runescape just because jagex is no longer in business.
---
(Disclaimer: united states)
---
But the problem is they're out there. Jagex can smell their own Moby Dicks out their waiting to be hit by the partnership harpoon!
---
Chill out, hardly anybody actually wears this gear.
---
If I could get 3 accounts I'd pay that. It's bullshit you only get 1 account for $11
---
Wc
---
But the partnerships are there to try bring new players to the game..
---
To keep the player base growing.
---
No new players means the game will die, no matter how many memberships you own, as soon as you quit, and you will most likely quit at somepoint, who is going to replace you? If they don't promote the game with these partnerships how are they going to entice new players?
---
I feel like a lot of this sub-reddit, as much as I admire their determination to keep the game "old school", don't seem do understand what partnerships mean for the game.
---
Your original comment mentioned xp rates like they were too high, when they are lower then the xp rates from burning logs. And yes incentive because without rewards firemaking would be a dead useless skill outside of the low quest requirements.
---
The guy I replied to was talking about ‚Äòbest‚Äô gear though.
---
Blue dragons with shortcut
---
Yup, you are just naming another way that Jagex has fucked up the game.
---
Do Vorkath
---
osrs is timeless
---
Exactly. OSRS players find great value and pride in earning In-Game cosmetics.
---
Yes please
---
Oh great a low level player who is new to Rs is definitely going to understand how to PK and Gmaul noobs.
---
Gamer Girl Bath Water ( boil before consuming )
---
Yeah and that started prior to Squeal of Fortune and the rest of MTXScape.
---
A lot of people made up their own mind once and would vote the same way twice. I guess it's a personal thing but I'm willing to bet it's pretty 50/50 on "I made my mind up, I'm still voting the same" and "I wanna be like everybody else so I'll change my votes"
---
That‚Äôs some nice threesome action going on
---
This worked, thanks.
---
I've explained this many times but people don't seem to get it
---
&gt;Nope! You miss out on the ability to use purple skin **for a couple of weeks**
---
Exactly! I'm glad you can see that you would **miss out on in game content** **unless you were to purchase it** via 3rd party MTX!
---
&gt;Is it ideal? No.
---
That's why we shut this poll down! Because it's a shit idea.
---
&gt;Is it anywhere even close to what you're suggesting is down the imaginary slippery slope? Also no.
---
I'm not suggesting that would ever happen, I'm using an extreme example to see if your point *"You don't miss out on anything"* still stood up - which it didn't. I'm glad you're able to see that now.
---
Waste of dps to kill the spiders when you can just kill the boss. Also, if you‚Äôre going to kill the blue spiders, the boss will range you, meaning your going to then take damage from the orange melee spiders. Either way, you‚Äôre taking damage from something and the magic spiders aren‚Äôt as accurate as the boss or orange spiders, so you just go for high mage def and dps down the boss as soon as possible. 
---
Full veracs is considerably less dps than Bludgeon or a 4 tick crush weapon, but if dont have any of those, veracs is fine. Just note, with veracs you‚Äôll take a ton of mage damage compared to hides.
---
I‚Äôve heard 80 is ideal as far as a minimum goes
---
lmfao imagine if they rigged em
---
Exp wise bonds are not much of an issue yh(in comparaisons to rs3 with lamps)
---
Idk, at least they‚Äôre some form of armour or weaponry. I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of bludgeon when it came out but now I think they all fit fairly well into the OSRS aesthetic.
---
What?
---
yeah i agree lmfao they thought they voting for new houses
---
Exactly which is why the OSRS Community isn't keel hauling over Bonds.
---
Yeah I did 97-99 there and made probably 120m after supplies
---
Just up your armour risk from 100k to a few mill to catch freezes on armour worth 20k? What?
---
Gnomes aren't elves.
---
That stupid but relatively *rare* things exist, isn't a good reason to add stupid but *ubiquitous* things to the game.

Isn‚Äôt one of the sets like 800 tickets per item?
---
It's called my mouth dumbass and it only take 56 gay.
---
Yeah because sucking more money out of us via third party companies through stupid in game cosmetics is the best way to bring new people in... sure.. it‚Äôs not like the player base nearly doubled after mobile came out. /s 
---
Seriously, some quality targeted advertising or partnerships WITHOUT MTX cosmetics would be fine. Fuck, why not do bundles. Buy this and get a free month of OSRS membership for free. (Obviously don‚Äôt allow the loophole with a free trial like twitch did, otherwise bot farms benefit as well)
---
I just really don‚Äôt see the big deal about them monetizing content that is strictly cosmetic and that everyone will receive, especially considering Jagex is being extremely transparent and not trying to implement something shady. I understand that the community is against MTX, but I don‚Äôt get WHY they have an issue with it other than ‚Äúhur dur this isn‚Äôt RS3.‚Äù Please enlighten me as to how no content is better than content that everyone will eventually receive?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind Jagex taking another shot at MechScape/Stellar Dawn
---
sure you can make some money but not with blowpipe slap on some broad bolts
---
dewe is a descwiption of whats going on hew mind in which i posted on my twittew -"I can do it! I can do it! I-I can't do iit!! Wahhhh!! What if he is not intewested in ewves?? Ugh..!

This this this is the difference between bonds and rs3 MTX. People can say "hurr durr technically bonds are MTX" all they want but they are missing the point of OSRS and what bonds really do for the game. We voted yes to bonds because they actually made sense and would be healthy for the game, shocker
---
I paid 22 for mine, it is still by far my favorite item in the game probably just from nostalgia.
---
Do they have new overlords?
---
I run afk tasks with tbow and get ~30 mins.  While afk.  It isn't hard, just stop wasting time thinking you'll die to a mager and a ranger at the same time.
---
Good bot
---
Bonds can't buy you time investment
---
Lol these snowflakes
---
*proceeds to rant and protest a tiny scarf added into the game*
---
Its not about what you want at that point. If you feel like your vote wont matter then you might nit vote
---
I don't think they should do another MMO, but it might work as an ARPG or even a singleplayer game that takes place in a futuristic Gielinor.

Always had a soft spot for d chain. This was my 4th chain drop, I had promised my rs gf that we would get one together and we just went super dry. I remember being so happy when we finally got this one, we just followed each other and danced around in circles in Lumbridge for ages celebrating.
---
At this point they were still worth more than p hats, and since i'd already managed to get full guthans, full dragon, and a whip I ended up buying a purple and a white partyhat. 
---
At this point I had more than enough gp so I just spent my days cutting yews by the beehives at Seers, doing nothing but talk to all the other people I saw every day on world 24. People would rush and and go crazy over the full dragon and partyhat getup, it felt so cool!
---
These days its just one of those "huh, cool.." kinda drops, but it'll always be my favourite item just because of the memories I have surrounding it. Super iconic.
---
Did not know that mostly because I never bought a bond just been charged 11 dollars for a year and I'm okay with that
---
fuck gay people LOL
---
How many players here are willing to accept membership and bond price increases in exchange of no more MTX in the game?
---
It looks fake if you're not too tech-savvy and don't understand how domains and subdomains work
---
Idk man my XR last a long time lol.
---
Explain pms
---
im pretty sure what ever they are doing is for reason dont worry about it
---
I think this would be good considering hides has the same bonuses as karils yet karils is supposed to be a better armor.
---
Bruh I‚Äôm reporting your ass
---
Timed played
---
idk why you'd be carrying 50m worth of bones on alt.
---
and even if your alt dies a lot you'll still save gp anyways lol
---
No barrows gloves. Get a load of this guy
---
People sell them to shop and then you can see what they sold and buy it
---
well you are going to be playing it
---
Funorb
---
Most people see this type of content as a slippery slope. A lot of this community was around to see rs3 crash and burn, leaving a bad taste in their mouth. Which was the entire reasoning for osrs's existence. Most of the players, including myself, that are against this, don't trust Jagex enough to not ruin their game for a second time. Theres been enough fuck ups in the past to not want to even remotely risk a chance at doing the same thing to osrs.
---
Not sure if it still happens or not, but one of my old accounts back in around 2008 lost membership inside the edgeville dungeon gate (behind the gate). When I was F2P, I was still behind the gate. Couldn't move up any further, nor was the area loaded. Trying to move up would say members only, but funny thing is, to even open the gate you need to be a member.
---
It's the same reason Activision/Blizzard fired loads of employees directly after bragging about how much money they were making.
---
As Jim Sterling would say, it's not enough to make shitloads of money, companies want to make ***all*** of the money.
---
This but bird guy
---
Preach boiiii
---
Imagine training at sandcrabs.
---
he is at his home on the planet of earth
---
What a serene thing to point out. Sad.
---
Lol did you even read the original polls? They were 100% trying to be sneaky
---
What in tarnation
---
I‚Äôm out ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è no point trying here
---
A partnership is NOT MTX
---
Offering in-game benefits avaliable exclusively through partnerships is MTX
---
It became around 15m quite quickly. People are just larping.
---
?
---
It's okay. I did 99 fm without realizing that spam clicking the brazier burns a log every 2 ticks
---
Gz
---
I‚Äôm at 600 kc with 0 uniques, I just stopped doing it years ago after that
---
How do these cosmetics bring anyone into the game?
---
No new players knows who serene is or what moritanyia is
---
Your being dramatic
---
You can make this your login screen with RuneLite if I'm not mistaken.
---
I think people don't really consider it a negative against jagex because the existence of bonds changes nothing in the game.  You could buy the gold anyway.  Bonds are actually less p2w because they're more expensive and more time consuming to convert into gold than just buying from a gold farmer.
---
Dude it's the slippery slope
---
No one is arguing that the cosmetics arnt arbitarty bs that no one cares about
---
It's the fact that they've done this before, where they inch little by little untill they're introducing buyable xp.
---
We, as a community, don't even want to take the first step down that road. It is a slippery slope that jagex just loves to slide down.
---
There is a boots table
---
&gt;Wow, the CEO makes a lot of money!
---
More money than any one man could ever have a use for, and money that he's making at the expense of his employees
---
&gt;The company should never let go of any redundant workers!
---
Apparently they weren't all that redundant, given that they're already hiring a lot of them back.
---
&gt;And yes, we should all follow the Japanese salaryman model and work ourselves to death in exchange for job security!
---
Implying American AAA companies like Blizzard that encourage massive overtime hours and crunch time that can be severely damaging to mental and physical health are not also fucking horrific working conditions, or that a Japanese CEO being willing to cut half of his salary in order to keep his employees happy is not something admirable and absolutely unheard of in the *vast* majority of situations?
---
&gt;Where do I vote for you? Retard
---
I would point out the hilarious irony of being called a retard by someone who has to resort to personal attacks and whataboutism as a result of their inability or unwillingness to come up with a legitimate defense for their points, but I'm afraid that irony would be lost.
---
I'm glad you can be a shining example of maturity and peak human intelligence, to the extent that you can declare anyone who disagrees with you to be mentally impaired. Where can I vote for *you*, oh glorious one?
---
Haha yeah it is, you don't need my permission I took it from someone else.
---
See: slippery slope fallacy
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get how anyone saying orange skins would bring new players to the game. Why would they give a fuck lol
---
Honestly no one is saying orange skin is going to convince everyone to stop what they're doing and play osrs. You're missing the point. A small incentive can definitely serve as motivation for someone to try the game. If out of 10,000 or whatever people are eligible and 100 try osrs because of the orange skin then that'd be a win imo
---
Whats to stop you from flinching in veracs and staying for a couple kills?
---
Your a leprechaun
---
fair enough, didnt read
---
if you like instances then you should probably make an ironman since it seems like you like to be lonely and play the game by yourself lol
---
Classic doesn't have MTX either though, so that doesn't really set OSRS apart from it.
---
Your mom's a goblin on my cock
---
Classic already has to compete with ff14 shadowbringers, having played through the story myself recently I am at an all time high fever pitch to continue playing and enjoying the overwhelming content I have to explore.
---
Where as WoW classic, I did all that before and I don't want to do that again. It was fun when I was 16 but as a 30 year old I don't want to go through it again, give us something new that feeds off nostalgia if that is their goal. Like idk.. Warcraft 4
---
Do you think OP knows?
---
It'll come with time. I dunno how people think tattoo artists get better as well, they all seem to think that straight lines come naturally or something lol. Yeah they can use fake skin but if they have someone willing to let them practise on them, that's better than any fake skin. As others have mentioned any kind of substitute for real skin can lead to bad habits in the long run.
---
Also the fact that it's your friend who did it AND it's one of his early tattoos, that probably makes it have even more meaning to you. Best of luck to your friend on his apprenticeship!
---
Besides, it's also really satisfying to run an alt entirely on self-made bonds, with no assistance from the main account
---
Obviously. Games like apex legends and fortnite you can play one game and restart with a new account and it wouldn't matter.
---
Games like Skyrim you put the time towards an end goal like finishing all the storylines and in the end you can start over.
---
RuneScape you cannot start over unless you want to invest months and months of time into getting back to where you were.
---
Yea I genuinely never noticed the stairs there
---
Hey at least free to play games have a right to be full of MTX, they gotta make their money somehow. What really pisses me off is games that double or even triple dip with different monetization schemes
---
While his is an over exaggeration for a "casual" an hour long fight caves on task is like 15 mins too long if not more
---
Maybe you're safespotting too much?
---
A lot of people over hype the monsters, if you're not a lvl 70 trying to get a low level firecapes you can basically just stand in the middle afk till jad
---
Bots selling items to gen stores give a higher profit
---
At least this is a good use of bots.
---
Just download runelite
---
If it‚Äôs apparently a much requested feature it would be worth the dev time regardless if there was a partnership or not? I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre saying? The amount of dev time lost towards other content is the same regardless of there being a sponsor or not.
---
Dont do it. Its better to buy gear and make money with it then buying rigour and rebuilding.
---
Thanks jeans.
---
Because they said they‚Äôd treat every partnership the same way
---
What's the big deal with waiting a few weeks for a skin color when it can bring in players to our game and help us grow?
---
I see the argument with 'memebership not unlocking all content'. I honestly don't care for it as long as the content will be unlocked without me paying anything more than my membership
---
You could also alch with the diary ring while you're bursting
---
They‚Äôre able to do that because of MTX and supporter packs
---
No they aren't lol. D chain sat at 30m for a long time, my brother sold one on an online auction website in my country for $300, mills where $10 each.
---
I didnt know they still played Party rock anthem at middle school dances.
---
By that logic though, it doesn't matter what you vote. If they're going to do this against our wishes then your votes on a poll don't mean jack shit. If they ARE going to respect our answers then we're just shooting ourselves in the foot by bitching about the tolerable content.
---
Partnerships are happening regardless of what we vote. We just vote on what can come in via them. Vote no to everything and Jagex will just stop asking permission.
---
But with the way the servers have been this league...any newcomers are going to think that's the norm and hate it
---
I've done over 100 kc, it's easy to find a free world.
---
Good suggestion and I like the detail of the colour scheme matching clues
---
Bonds are already worth exactly what they're meant to be. Hell, they went up a full 1.2m on osrs to account for less people buying them. And they're still not in short supply. Jagex makes money hand over fist. They tried to make esports happen. Don't let them fool you into thinking they're a tiny little backwater online game company. They don't need any more money, they'll keep trying though. Go play rs3 for a year and tell me you don't feel largely incentivized to spent money on mtx, due to how treasure hunter rewards are manipulated.
---
They all kind of are considering war, pestilence and famine are all different forms of death in environment or something.
---
I think we're talking past each other.  I think the former, what you're talking about, would be something more related to a command economy/ reminiscent of the Soviets, while what I'm talking about is a sort of syndicalism, or labor managed firm.  A company managed by its employees, not by the government, though these both do fall under the broad umbrella of "socialism".
---
The thing is players won‚Äôt actually quit you just think they will because you‚Äôre dramatic
---
osrs was literally made because this is what happened. history repeats itself.  they even changed their rules from the last game (rs3), they started small then snowballed into the shit show RS3/EoC is called. once the higher ups put their boots on their throats for more money they're going to say fuck it and do it.
---
omg i scrolled up looking for people humping for like 30seconds before realizing haaaaaaaaaa
---
Thats fair enough I guess. I played for a few years and never felt super pushed to buy things other than premium. I got like 5 T10s and felt it was good enough.
---
Granted I do have something like 12 prem tanks. A few were free event things but I did pay for most of it. I was fairly young when I was seriously playing so its entirely possible I didn't notice and just opened my wallet.
---
[https://youtu.be/\_mIxp\_bTHns](https://youtu.be/_mIxp_bTHns)
---
Wait so it‚Äôs faster to spam click? Fuck
---
every few months I feel the same and quit. but I'm always back eventually lol. I've made more progress on my current account than any other account i've ever had so it's hard to leave permanantly
---
You've milked it long enough fella, it's time to stop
---
Well it actually isn't 'free' since they'd have to be lucky and already have the membership that Runescape is doing the partnership with, or go out of their way and buy it. 
---
You do make a good point though I wouldn't want players that care about free promotions to flood the game, but osrs being the game it is I doubt someone who goes for mtx  would get very far in the game unless they buy bonds
---
whats the story behind this green pixel stuff?
---
Nah its just more of a psychological thing that you have a harder time telling people of different races apart because they usually have different distinctive features than your race. White people typically identify other people based off of their nose and eyes, so that's why some have a hard time finding differences in Asians
---
Just do it man, the rewards feel so good
---
That rune Warhammer looks really bright so I assume it isn't a rune Warhammer?
---
Yes? I have no desire to replay the same game I just finished yesterday? Games tend to get really samey after 10-20 hours of gameplay
---
Sounds a lot more like you're willing to overpay even more for a game that takes next to nothing to run, and would be making jagex a landslide profit even at $10 a player.
---
I agree, just relating facts.
---
I did a ton of castle wars pre eco and I maybe got 120 tickets total?
---
No one is quitting over a skin color change or a house design, you reddit nerds are so dramatic
---
Get real
---
jojo...
---
just google it
---
oh sorry i thought you were slermz mackenzie
---
From a business standpoint (the people you are talking to) you obviously aren't overpaying if you keep paying for it.
---
If they saw this, which I doubt, they will scoff at your message.
---
 I totally agree, as long as they do it right it we could get some dope shit
---
To be fair, POE is PVE mostly solo game and the game is properly designed around cosmetic MTX to be positive for the game. Where as RS, is absolutely not designed for that gamestyle. Love both games in their own special way.
---
There is a difference between stupid cosmetics in RS3 vs OSRS. In OSRS you will see these things exclusively in social hangout spots where as in RS3 they are persistent everywhere on everyone. This photo is immersion breaking as well, just not in the same way as if everyone was going into combat wearing this.
---
A partnership. We're voting yes to stuff we don't actually know anything about. And yeah, there's noway to know ahead of time, but that's why it's just a bad idea
---
You mean the players that can buy bonds and sell it in the GE and do the best xp methods? We already crossed that bridge long ago. 
---
Let's  be honest. For someone to go out of their way to buy memberships with other companies to unlock house themes (that no one usually sees expect the player himself) and skin colors (which sits underneath your armor anyways) when they will unlock it all the same by waiting a few weeks or so sounds entirely farfetched. 
---
Yeah I'm satisfied with the player count too. But if we don't find new younger players our playerbase will only decrease.
---
Lmao bro I'm so high and didnt even realise. Yeah based on him, futurama üòÖüòÇ
---
Didn't downvote you, but thanks for shooting me anyways. Wow is $20 a month, and loaded to the brim with mtx, and has the most rapidly declining fanbase of any mmo. They too are tired of bring money gouged for worthless bullshit, when they already have empirical evidence showing the most dev time goes into store mounts in place of actual raid tier rewards, armours, etc. 
---
Wow is currently in the same state that rs3 was at the release of eoc, and are paying the price for it every patch. Until the finance dept of any company is banned from game dev meetings, we have to stay on our toes. Also, look how much more wow players get for that nearly $20 a month.
---
You could just not play the game tho.
---
whats fun about dchain though? there so many cool items and people still play for fun not making a pretty easy to get drop worth like 10 mil doesnt mean ppl dont have fun lol.
---
I really doubt partnerships as proposed are going to accomplish that goal. But you have valid points.
---
Maybe you should read the entire paragraph of things you're voting on?
---
