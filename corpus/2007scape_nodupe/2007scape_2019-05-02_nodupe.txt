Shayzien armor worth getting?

im usually pretty annoyed when i only get 6
---
Man, I miss Gunz (although my hands would go to shit if I started playing it on a private server again)
---
You can map some functionality you want to AHK keybinds but it needs to be 1:1 (one key per AHK action). You can also bind the interface tabs to Function keys (F-keys) in the vanilla client. This makes it easy to swap between your prayer book &amp; inventory.
---

---
&gt; And normally you bring x2 range pots? At what waves do you normally use these at?
---
1-2 Range pots. I would first reserve ~3 doses for the final waves &amp; jad. I would start using range potions once you are dealing with both the ranger &amp; melee minions (wave 22+). When to re-boost range:
---
- You lost minor health and don't need prayer points: Sip a brew dose and then a ranging potion dose.
---
- You lost major health: 3 sips of brew doses -&gt; 1 super restore dose -&gt; 1 ranging potion dose
---
- Your boosted range level is getting low or a dangerous wave is about to spawn (e.g. wave 45).

Short version: Wah i cant prayer flick, remove now
---
Many parents get it for their kids so they stop bothering them when they're doing xanax and drinking wine.
---
Everyone knew about prayer flicking
---
Dude, you are my hero. I did not know expeditiouz and slaughter bracelets were a thing!! Ty so much
---
I was a F2P back in 07. How was Jad done? Was prayer flicking possible back then?
---
Level only effects yeild
---
Make sure you're using ultra compost
---
And definitions aren't universal. A game can still have a small following and be considered dead by most.
---
They’re super easy to buy under market value because people just dump them from doing vork and not many people buy the unf bolts because they don’t know how good they are. When I did it, ge tracker showed a small loss as well and I still made 10-40gp per bolt.
---
It is actually fun lol. Before eoc and all that i remember seeing that pirate hat and deciding i needed it. Had like two full sets cause it was just a fun game
---
Nah he did say gz but in the way that's like when you get a degree and someone's says gz on paying thousands for a piece of paper. Have your moment dude that's pretty cool!
---
I want Dongeoneering, but as a minigame.
---
Yeah, 8 is where I have the "ok" face anything under is kinda disappointing
---
6 is barely profiting on ranarrs
---
HAI AND WELCOME TO MY GUIDE!
---
Get adjusted to uncomfortable flicking situations (Melee+Mage/Range+Blob). If you can do that, "shit spawns" wont be much of a problem. Minimize the amount you drink by blood barraging and only sip when you truly need. You dont need to brew to 99, brewing to 60 to survive a potential range hit is just fine.

Stealing creation!!!

Im about 155kc atm. Youve had 3 more purples than me. 
---
I got a tbow split on 148kc, and a elder maul (same table as bow) around 80ish.
---
So like a Skyrim type inventory?
---
No its not, tha'st normal spell book entangle spells that get halved with pray mage activated.
---
I mean you have to consider that someone found it worthwhile to rent ad space for this. If no one fell for this shit we'd never see it
---
I couldn't get it then I tried listening to songs with the same BPM you gotta click(there's YouTube playlists) and that's what finally got me to learn it.
---
After awhile I could do it without the music
---
Thanks for the heads up o p. Can't wait to get home and see the exact same thing in my screenshot folder. Have to see if I can turn off the automatic screenshots in runelite, I play a lot of mobile so I don't want to turn off the drop notifications.

this sounds way better

Quests first! The quest requirements for various skills should give you clear goals for skill levels. Quests will unlock you better gear, more areas and eventually money making methods.

You did. I vividly remember in 3rd grade children having issues with decimals and fractions.
---
This was about 20 years ago too, right around No Child Left Behind.
---
And if someone is willing to put in more effort and gp, they still shouldn’t be able to get faster afk xp rates. This whole thing is dumb af and didn’t need to be changed at all. You’re paying nearly 12m/hour to achieve 160-180k xp/hr. If you wanna pay 70gp/xp, the increased xp/hr is fully deserved.
---
From the altscape point of views, you’re using 5 accounts (which alone could get 45k xp/hr each) to get 180 on a single account. 5x45=235. You’re actually getting less total xp/hr by consolidating the xp onto one account.
---
What's wrong with doing waterfall quest after tutorial island?

Can they stop fucking around with prayer pots already
---
If you have barrage(or entangle) for tunnel in case you get dh is nice
---
Of course you only use like 1(maybe 2 if u wanna do verac) per run. And trident the rest. The last time I brought this up everyone assumed I meant to only use barrage for your main DPS spell.
---
This is like those movie drinking games where they are trying to be super clever but realistically you'd be so shit faced that you couldn't play out a full Q&amp;A of the game.

---
Stealing creation was the best. You can enjoy it for combat or for skilling, or by being a troll and stealing peoples runes while they fight. Good times all around, would love to see these games come back. Sc would need new rewards though, doubt people will be ok with double xp items these days.
---
That’ll be $11
---
"The process of safespotting is game breaking. The point of having health points is because fighting monsters should have an inherent cost. However, due to safespotting, it's possible to go hours without spending a single health point because there's a small rock you can run around."
---
You say that prayer should have an inherent cost, but why? Shouldn't higher effort methods be rewarded proportionately?

My Only Hot-Take Additions
---
* Create Robes (unf) with crafting...finish Robes with "imbuing" (concept from the post)  \[Concerns: Warding: Robe Creation -&gt; transition crafting/runecrafting\]
---
   * Does this conflict with Xerican? I don't believe so. The Warding focus was on higher level gear (mystics)
---
   * No Magic level involved keeps the crafting non-combat based 
---
   * Maintains crafting role...interlinks core skills, and adds more steps  - these could be negative OR positive 
---
* Re-Examine "Summoning" options as non-combat and as part of an expansion to Arceus Spells \[Concerns Warding: In-Combat Summoning -&gt;  transitionMagic\]
---
   * Not an argument for Summoning or easyScape. But Arceus has the potential to modify the way some skills are trained already (e.g, prayer)...this could provide an opportunity to expand on this in a different way...

I'd argue those unintended mechanics ad more depth to the game
---
I mean look at games like ssbm, half the reason it's still being played today is because of all the unintended mechanics are used to push the game to it's limits.
---
Less depth in this already pretty shallow game(it's a point and click game) is a bad thing imo.
---
Zmi runner discord already has a lava running guide.
---
Thank you!

Tought she was talking about the crabs in your pants tbh
---
They could easily remove it, they just won't.

Stop this trash meme format, even worse than the nobody: one.
---
Some crab species can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs such as their claws, which then regenerate after about a year.
---
Why do you have super combats and str/atk?
---
Thanks dude! Did they talk about what if Warding doesn't pass too? 
---
It feels like Warding has sooo much stock and time/effort invested before even knowing whether it'll pass.
---

It's always a phishing link.
---
Oh my god LOL
---
I sit in a pillow and just wash the pillow instead
---
Good info
---
Nah it's way over exaggerated, almost nobody does it on main accounts for standard content. There's a reason prayer armour is meta for so much content.
---
Why in the fuck are they talking about nerfing the library and mermaid tears, nobody does mermaid tears already, if anything it needed a buff reward wise, not a nerf to exp. The library is on par with lava crafting but requires sooooo much more time and effort, its completely balanced in my mind.
---
Oh gawd. Back when Hill Giants where big money.

Fire bolt iron/steel drags with the chaos gauntlets from family crest quest.

OP is lucky that I cannot do that bc it requires engine work
---
Well super str is white, so it isn't really close at all.
---
iPhones have a magnifying glass you can enable btw
---
Not really. Given that Magic is not a required skill in this game, runes would be analogous to anything irl which is not a necessity either. If you can't afford something that isn't a necessity irl, that means you're either spending your money responsibly on things that *are* necessities, and/or are spending the rest of your disposable income on other non-necessities which you care about more. Neither of which mean you "suck at managing your money."

why should you get BIS + convenience? there should be a trade off you can use X for the sake of convenience, or you can use Y which is better but requires a bit more effort. its silly to make everything the obvious choice with no thinking required

I can't see what overhead your friend is using.  Curses....foiled again

Summoning ruined many aspects of the game like pvp and wasnt liked by everyone it's not about when it was released but what changed the game in my opinion. But some people liked it not me tho 👍

VR MMO'S?

Yup

Not gril btw
---
If it's your work life balance that sucks, that is what needs changing

Was not aware you get the house back

I loved SC so much I would play it for zero rewards. Please Jagex idc if $14 replaces $11 as the new meme; just give us Stealing Creation!
---
Not that I've met, though I dont exactly ask if someones a guy/girl in game.  This is definitely a male dominant game.
---
Tbh I never make an effort to find out if someone is or isn’t, I usually afk skilling or go about my business

I’m a female and I play daily.

(I’m also a stay at home mom so naptime is when I’m on most hahaha)

Was not aware you get the hp back

Damn I was happy a second ago
---
That’s pretty broken man. I like it
---
Okay so they ban the bots today, then what they never come back? You realize they literally replace bots as soon as they realize it gets banned? They don’t just chalk it up as a loss and quit you idiot. It’s literally wasted resources to have a jmod continuously hop around banning bots as if that will resolve anything in the long run
---
Is this prevalent at all ? Never done nechs in kourend
---
they also thought eoc and micro transactions were good for the game.
---
There used to be tons of pures and bots who were there to train their magic for free and do it over and over so not really pay attention, I'd use the seercull special against them when I was defending which has 100% accuracy and would lower their magic level, they would be autocasting...not have the level and then run up to me and melee usually ruining their new members account Mua ha ha ha haaaaaa
---
Looks really nice, great work :). If you end up painting it or anything please share!

Thanks! was worried haha

I was the most prominent turmoil pure in the game, lmao saying I didn't pk. I have over 1k hours pking with summoning.

NPC contact is useless if you cancel tasks somewhat frequently. The routes to all the slayer masters take &lt;30 seconds once you've done the right quests for transportation.
---
I don't even think Jagex considers either a bug anymore. I think is is just a standard mechanic.
---
Imagine not profiting when you get 5, ie anything but ranarrs and snapdragon lol

Dev Q&amp;A talked about buffing them again between the different milestones so you aren't doing seers to 90
---
Great job friend :) big step.

Portability is the key for sure
---
I enjoy them, I don't alch or pick up any rune so why not. If you want the loot pick it up, once everyone can see it it's fair game.
---
Omg hahaha ur sooo cool epic spoiler bro 😎😎😎
---
Why not?

I remember this

I feel like buffing the old content that doesn't give marks of grace/ requires staminas or energy pots would be better than making rooftops more varied by making relleka more viable than hard diaries seers

Get drag defender too.

So what's half of 2?
---
Man what would you even need that many feathers for lol
---
My entire point is prayer flicking shouldn't be removed in the first place. There is literally no improvement to be made. Keep acting morally superior though cause it seems to make you very happy
---
To be fair to this guy, I started playing RS before I was able to read properly or learned my multiplication tables. It's very possible it's a 9 year old on twitter lmao
---
I have no idea what you’re talking about
---
An up to date book would be thiccc
---
:(
---
My problem is that what you have described is both morning and smithing in terms of complexity...but in one skill. I was affording warding the same exact benefit. You don't need a pickaxe at all for smithing. You a metaphorical pickaxe for warding....as well as an anvil, a hammer, and also a tinderbox.
---
It is more complicated. That's a fact.
---
What I'm asking is why do you have to have it this complicated. That's my problem with it. Not the rewards, not having a new skill, not even the idea of what warding should accomplish. Just what so many steps in one skill?
---
Its bottable
---
Because then you lose it
---
Honestly I’d love to have an updated version. Chances are it’d become outdated very fast but it’d be cool to have to display or flip through every once in a while :)

Hey, you live your life however you want. If you want to get pissed at people for trying to help that's on you. Maybe that's a personal flaw you could acknowledge and work on, or maybe I'm just some retard. Who knows.
---
Not sure if you are the right person to ask, but is it possible for Jagex to release a bunch of 3D-printable files of different bosses and items? Some can be found on the internet but, not all.
---
Ironmen hate him
---
Just an FYI, the wrench isn't worth bringing over another prayer pot(unless you for sure will have extra)
---
It can only give a Max of +28 prayer points which is about 1 sip of a restore.
---
Staff of light is also in osrs
---
Make it solar powered and start selling. I'd by and have it sit on my desk or on the shelf.
---
Same deal. Ive lent like over 100m on gear to a friend i only know from the game, and he gave it back every time. Makes you realise there are actually people who you can trust on
---
the only reason why people want it to stay because it does break the game.  If JaGex intended for you to have unlimited prayer, you would have unlimited prayer.  Why is that hard to grasp?
---
Nah I’m just really bad. I don’t quest and pretty much only use melee. A lot of that time is also spent doing shit that doesn’t raise combat level such as tanning hides
---
Give a man a fish, teach a man to fish

Will someone explain to me keeping untradeables after PVP death?
---
I bought a dragon chain, d legs, boots, d scimmy, and fury and then put the ornament kit on all of them thus making them untradeable. 
---
So, does this mean that if I’m out doing wildy slayer and get pk’ed, do I get to keep all of them?
---
The dev team has no intention of doing so
---
It's literally only a small section of players on this subreddit that want it. most people are just memeing it, while a fraction are actually serious.
---
&gt;This is fire wave we're talking about, not fire surge. So it's blood runes
---
Doesn't really matter. SOTD &gt; Smoke for both spells for the exact same reason. The elemental runes only make up 13-14% of the cost of both spells (about 4% if you decide to use a tome), and 1/8 is 12.5%. You pay almost the same in both cases, and SOTD typically has better dps. *However*, in this specific case, since your accuracy is so low against wyverns (around 45-55%), the 10% accuracy buff from smoke battlestaff is actually slightly more dps than the ~5% extra damage on the SOTD when you're 75-91 magic (the difference is &lt;1% dps, so not really worth worrying about). From 91 magic onwards, the accuracy difference drops off to the point where SOTD is better, and for fire surge SOTD is objectively better all the time. For monsters with much lower defence (like Kraken and green Zulrah), SOTD will be better.
---
&gt;Would the 1/8 chance to save wrath rune + air runes make up for the cost of burnt pages when casting fire surge though?
---
What do you mean by this? SOTD effect unfortunately doesn't affect burnt pages. If you mean "is it worth using a tome of fire for AFK magic training at wyverns", then I actually think the answer is no. I did a bit of research and found that wyverns will lose you money in the long run with a tome, and only increase your xp/hr by about 11%. This is because your accuracy is low and the majority of your xp/hr is cast xp, which tome doesn't affect—think of it as glorified splashing, which is exactly what this thread is about.
---
Based off a few wyvern loot videos I just looked up, I believe the average loot is about 12k per kill (when you're not banking bones). I went ahead and calculated the DPS of a pretty reasonable setup (costs ~25m), and you spend about 7.9k per kill in runes with a tome and about 6k per kill without one (at 85 magic). If you are killing wyverns non-stop, then you should expect to kill about 54/hr with a tome and 37/hr without. 
---
The profit/hr should come to 648k - 718.8k = -70.8k, and 444k - 376.8k = 67.2k and the magic xp/hr should be upwards of 74k vs 66k and 15k vs 10k hp xp. All these numbers are for tome / no tome respectively.
---
Thanks for prompting me to do some proper research on this. The results are pretty interesting.
---

YOUR TITLE IS POOP DICK WTF R U HAVING A STROKE

This is hilarious
---
I would think that it’s against the rules from the sound of it, but interested to find out for sure.

lanta net profit is literally half that of ranarr/snap, definitely not worth doing
---
sure you'll get the occasional bad run where like 3-4 plants die but it all averages out in the end
---
That game was the shit I loved it!!
---
I'm not gonna lie dude, I bitched out. I couldn't do a cold shower. I was like, you know what dude? I'm just gonna go all in. And I went, like, max tryhard and I did eagle eye, I bought gear, glory, but you know so. I didn't do the breakfast. Because, honestly, I didn't think I would like the breakfast.
---
Exploits are only banned in glitchless runs?
---
stimulate your senses
---
No, it was in my feed. I haven’t logged into the main RS page to verify though.
---
ranarr/snap are best for profit
---
toadflax is the best "safe" option due to cheap seed costs (but only 75% of the profit of ranarr or snap)
---
sounds 1:1 to me
---
just hit 50 ranged should I use addy cbow or magic shortbow
---
Well, if you look at it this way, a script is a script.. A bot uses a script which is against the rules, so I can guess ur method is indeed a violation against the game rules.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, just a simple thought. 👍🏻
---
Imagine thinking that there isn't another 16 hours in a day during which things other than runescape can be done.

Say 9 of that is sleeping, that still leaves 7 hours for a fuckton of other things.

The vast majority of RuneScape players are PvMers. This is evidenced by the fact that PvM receives near constant updates and the game at its core revolves around PvM content. Not PvP. 
---
I can tell you’re mad for whatever reason but I even said that they should update PvP, just not nerf PvM entirely like Manked and other content creators want. 
---
You shouldn’t hamstring the majority of the community because the popular YouTubers want content immediately.

Pick up a bunch of nats, get 50 magic for snare, and you're good.
---
If you're attentive you can figure out the spawns point for one and just camp it (the lower level implings respawn after a few seconds, more or less always in the same spot. So you can just snare and catch over and over, fills up an inventory quite quickly.)

I've boiled water in a paper cup before, so it's possible

I can agree with you there. Making prayer flicking *required* to beat a piece of content seems uncalled for.
---
I'll preface this with I'm all for prayer flicking staying in the game and would be fucking shocked if it was removed but you don't need to flick a single thing for a firecape.  And while I have literally 0 experience with the inferno my understanding is that requires prayer flicking for your average pvmer to complete; that's where I personally see the issue flicking should be a bonus not a requirement for content, like don't change the inferno and don't remove prayer flicking but can they at least not balance future content around a gimmick of the code?
---
For what it's worth I can flick reasonably well and at the end of the day this is just all a bit of buzz on reddit nothings gonna change.

---
Exactly. Pking isn’t meant to be for killing PvMers. It’s meant for ***fighting*** other players. I get that they want to increase Wilderness viability but I don’t think that you can reasonably nerf Vorkath and Zulrah into the ground and make Wildy the new OP loot farm. 
---
Not to mention high gp/hr methods in the wildy are inherently broken as clans can be paid to protect Ironmen in the wildy so they can get all the items they need. 
---
I think PvP needs an arena style game mode with unique rewards. 1v1 random match made games with a skill rating and everyone on the same build.
---
I do it on occasion even though I'm not poor.
---
For some reasons having the cash on hand is meta.
---
Agility isn't click intensive at all compared to tick methods
---
Lol all the combinations have a cosmetic attached to it. So what if it doesn't add bonuses or anything. They literally made 3 different versions for the ma2 god capes with the SAME bonuses.
---
About 157 hours chopping teaks at hardwood grove, assuming 70k/hr (easily attainable if you're shift-dropping logs). It will be a little longer if you decide to switch to redwoods at 90 wc, they're less exp than teaks but a lot more afk

'Prayer is free if you collect the bones yourself'

I did. Guess I look pretty dumb now tbh.

This was way too accurate for me.
---
I only get like 2 hours a week to play and I hate playing through 60 something levels, I usually end up clicking the wrong one about halfway through and get 1 shot or close to it

see this is the type of shit that makes me feel not bad about ad-blocking
---
Can I get some tips? I heard you need two accs to do this because one of them needs to be on normal spell books for alchs. True or false?
---
Right...so correcting someone who clearly has a completely wrong perspective of what actually goes on in PvP because his only experience with PvP is running into the wilderness to do a clue is..being salty and "ranting"? Yeah man..fuck me for actually telling him what actually happens so maybe he changes the way he views PvP from his entirely false view of it currently. I could have just called him a salty retard PvMer who needs to l2play but instead I explained how he was wrong. God some of you kids on this sub are legitimately brain dead.
---
The dude literally thinks teams are running around the wilderness in max actively looking for clue hunters to kill...not much more needs to be said about how incredibly out of touch with PvP he is and how wrong he is. Any good max team can easily make more than most PvMers in a night, they arent searching high and low for people in zero risk doing clues.
---
Get your retard ass out of here if all you have to contribute is pathetic nonsense.
---
Exact question I have lol have around the same stats but 75 mage and 75 range. Not sure what to drive towards endgame
---
29 people don’t believe you
---
Rigour also has the 23% bonus to ranged strength that no other ranged prayer has period.
---
Like eagle eye only boosts ranged accuarcy/damage while rigour boosts those 2 plus ranged str and overall defense.
---
Just dont got the time to mess with it much, I only play a few hours a week with work and side business if that. Dont have the time to try a lot when it takes an hour over useless waves to get to 1 fight that matters
---
Congrats but I had a question. What was your paper about?
---
Yes, I forgot about things like underflow. Luckily however, the engine is implemented in Java right? Java doesn't have unsigned numbers, so I don't think something like the Prayer counter can ever wrap-around 0 to MIN_INT.
---
If they were instead using unsigned integers in a language like C++, we could have issues where if the player's Prayer was between 0 and 1 point un-rounded, this calculation would underflow before the floor function is applied. So that would need to be special-cased out ahead of time via forced rounding.
---
But prayer flicking is such a lame mechanic though...
---
Just take a little break, do some other things you like in OSRS and whenever you’re feeling up to it again, try it once more. You can also pause the game, activating pause doesn’t stop your current wave, but once your current wave ends, you can log out and save your progress. I used this method to effectively smoke a cigarette before Jad and it really calmed my nerves before the big fight. Just random tips you may not be looking for. Anyway, good luck man, I know you can do it!
---
You can tell when you roll a no hit and when you roll a hit that's a 0 with sgs spec
---
I'd you don't hit you get no heal, I'd you hit a 0 you get the base heal

Which is likely just a random dude lol

Also get the torso, d defender if you havent, mage arena bones 2 peaches and infinity boots.
---
Yes it will lol, well that or justiciar. When you get shitty spawns to start some waves, it can easily be the difference between death or having to suck down too many brew doses when you would prefer to save them for later. Unless youre an absolute pro at doing inferno and pray flicking, you should probably be bringing tank to start waves in. Doesnt mean you have to ignore mechanics just because you bring tank, but if youre learning and not a pro with pray flicking then it does make a significant difference.

i got 11m pots if u wanna buy

Asking the real questions over here.. possibly some sort of non virgin meta.

Might help to use u/rahfee instead
---
With a decent spawn, you can tag them, then run around a rock so that they follow and Jad gets stuck. Then just kill them with Jad safespotted and go back to Jad once they’re dead. That being said, they normally don’t do too much damage with your stats if you only have one attacking.

---
&gt; Your argument is from your point of view. My post was specifically talking about the post manked made and what other content creators have said.
---
Yes...obviously it is. However if it was such a common thing as people on reddit seem to bitch about it, wouldnt you think Id even be attacked let alone killed FAR more often? Genuinely dont know what these people are doing if they cant even do a clue without being pked, its incredibly easy to do a clue step in the wilderness and be fine. And if you get killed...WHO CARES? Its the most insignificant minor inconvenience in the world, and yet if you judged it solely based off these peoples responses you would think they lost their banks and hours of their lives, its completely irrational complaining about something that means nothing in the grand scheme of the game. You entered the wilderness, died, and lost nothing...so what?
---
&gt; These content creators have been saying that PvM should be nerfed outside of the wilderness and buffed in the wilderness. I don’t think this is a solution. I think making OG content for PvP is the solution.
---
But im not sure how you got that "PvM should be nerfed outside of the wilderness" from what Manked posted...maybe you should read it again because thats not what he was saying at all. He was saying that things like Zulrah/Vork completely changed the game because they are known consistent high money makes that have very little risk, and something like that does not exist for PvP. Also said that he believes that its GOOD balance to have a PvM activity that has little risk at all, to be based on UNIQUES instead of consistent cash drops. 
---
So because of things like Vork/Zulrah/TOB etc. it gives people very little incentive to actually keep doing Revs(even though its not great money because of how its multi and oversaturated with PKers because theres nothing else for them to really do) and Vene or anything in the wilderness OVER PvM outside the wilderness because its LESS money with MUCH more risk. He didnt say ANYWHERE that PvM outside the wilderness should be NERFED, just that activities inside the wilderness(preferably in single, so as to revive single pking) SHOULD be able to compete with the money made of activities outside of the wilderness because there is a lot of extra risk accompanied with inside the wilderness. Currently there is no incentive for people to do wilderness activities over PvM outside the wilderness because its much more profitable. And then he says how that breaks the cycle of how the wilderness is kept alive because PKer&gt;PvMer and then PKer&gt;PKer than killed PvMer (or just PKers fighting other pkers because theyre attracted to the same PvM area). He said there is currently no incentive for PKers to be in the wilderness (over BH/PvP) because the PvM inside the wilderness cant come close to competing with how little risk PvM outside the wilderness has ON TOP of being much more profitable in general. Therefore making the wilderness even more dead.
---
Really have absolutely no clue how you somehow got that he was calling for PvM outside the wilderness to be nerfed, no such words were even remotely said, only that PvM inside the wilderness NEEDS to be buffed because of it carrying vastly more risk.
---
I think the point went straight over his head. Almost nobody's saying that prayer flicking is some accident they have no clue about. We do know they consider it a legitimate part of the game and even balance around it. We're trying to tell them that's the problem.
---
all of them
---
Uh alright
---
I really thought that was a real RS3 ad when I saw it and was kinda disappointed lol

Also one of the chests in the dungeon nearby spawns regular antipoisons (1) but you don’t have to wait for them to respawn. Check the wiki page for the observatory quest for which chest it is

The real question:

Why are you using a dragonwarhammer?
---
I get it's a joke but just for context I think a comparable reasoning applied to abortion is that you talk about when someone is a human, because ultimately that is what matters in that debate. There's no point in talking about whether late-stage abortion is moral or not if you haven't established the groundwork, as in, is the thing you're killing a human? Is it moral to kill humans in certain scenarios? And so on and so forth.

Yeah, sounds made sense back in the day when the screen was so small you couldn't even see jad on crossbow range. Now I just keep it turned off
---
Everything I listed is a core game mechanic integrated into the community of said games, everything you listed is not.
---
I have my Hosidius favor at 100% but when I talk to Hosa he won't lock the favor, he just says that he needs all the architects to fix the statue.

Is that not how you should lock Hosidius favor?
---
The auto prayer and auto switcher is pretty easily detectable so it isnt a very huge issue in your daily pking. People only use it on throwaway bought accounts, mostly pures.   
---
But for paid tournaments such as dmm, it's a legit strategy to have 1 or 2 semi geared people with this client to take out opponents fed people. The accounts will not win, but will get far enough in 1v1s to make sure opposing clans dont get through. As Jagex only checks for the scripts after the tourny, ban or dq wont make any difference since those accounts suicide when they get against own fed player.
---
I got one on my second iron dragon task.

Goddamn it, I HATE that shit when that happens lmao

Does the mager move at all, like if you’re far from it will it move?

For sure, I use it often, but have it disable for programs where color is important, definitely an eye saver.
---
Spiritual creatures, Minions of Scabaras, Suqah's, Cave Kraken (cause already got pet &amp; jar there and long task in general, got better money method options for PVM) , Fire giants and trolls.
---
Trolls I could knock off since I could cannon em relatively quickly and fire giants are relatively boring/ no good drops.
---
Which bosses and npcs drop addy darts? I know at least 1  does because I've seen them in my loot tab but I can't think of any atm.
---
If u look at the wiki page for zulrah you'll see your interpretation of what he said isn't right. It's 1/1024 chance of getting fang per roll and 1/1024 chance of visage per roll. So the max you could get is 2 of those items in 1 kill.
---
I decided to follow your math anyway and it doesn't seem right either, since you don't seem to be considering VN and NV (or FN and NF) as different cases, since you said there's 16 possibilities.  If you combine VN and NV into one, you need to weight it appropriately. 
---
&gt;Also, if there are 2 independent 1/1024 chances to get a drop, the probability of getting either is not (1+1)/1024, it is 1 - (1023/1024)2, which is slightly smaller.
---
The 2 rolls are independent. The loot you get on a single roll is not independent of whether or not you got the other item.
---
I’ll never forget when I went over my friends house after school one day, he and his older brother shared an account and finally saved up for full mithril before the GE and everything. His brother decided he was buying a skirt because it looked cooler and a full on fist fight broke out over it haha
---
Runechain would have fit better but ha ha ?
---
Actualy not a bad idea +
---
Snitches
---
Sometimes lol.
---
In case you weren't aware though, as many people aren't, the death mechanics are very different than in rs2.
---
If you die (outside of specific circumstances that you'll generally be warned about when entering those places), you have 1 hour to retrieve your things off the ground before the items despawn, and at no point can other players see or take your items.
---
I see many people die in some far away cave, get disheartened about the 8 minute trek back thinking their items are gone, and log out in frustration. Just making sure that isn't something you're doing.
---
And wintertodt.

**Show us the code that has Prayer-Flicking implemented then, please...?**
---
&gt; You can't because its abusing the code cycle time.
---
&gt; Its an Un-Implemented method.
---
So 50/50 you either get it or you don't
---
When I did Inferno for the first time, I did it with no sound and no music. It’s honestly the best way for me to focus just on flicks and positioning. Sound is another sensory thing which distracts me.
---
it doesn't make it less click intensive lol they're just braiddead clicks
---
Evidently, because people really enjoyed playing it. It was like nothing else in the game.
---
I hate this game, and the time it demands from me. But gosh darn it the need to get a 99 is great, I owe it to my young self.
---
... and then it turns out the thieving guild is actually orchestrating the war on behalf of the woodmasons (secret construction guild) to kill off the competition for the log market.
---
Honestly bud just use runelite. It has a setting that puts a little box in the corner of the screen UI that tells you to play range or mage. It's not as if it's some competitive race or something, so where's the fault in using every tool at your disposal to save yourself hours of attempts?
---
Saradomin's Light and... Zamorak's Shadow?
---
&gt; runecrafting and to think people wouldn’t also use it for ZMI is idiotic unless they’re incompetent.
---
Again, it really doesn't matter how idiotic you think it is because that's what happened. No one foresaw it happening to this extent when it was polled and implemented.
---
&gt;t should have been accounted for to begin with when calculating estimated xp rates at the time of polling, or simply saying “we expect this do/hr, but will ess runners it can be higher” would have completely fixed the higher than polled xp issue.
---
Literally all you're saying is "this should've been handled better when it was implemented". Yeah, no shit, but it wasn't so here we are. Again, do you have an actual better solution for *this* situation we're in now (regardless of how we got here)? Or are you just complaining for the sake of it?
---

---
Do the defenders get paid and if so how much?
---
pfft. I have shit tons of herblore exp banked from the grind @ elder chaos druids for my robes.
---
The tone I got from the stream was that they're more concerned with  rebalancing it so skipping contracts isn't as necessary, and also making it less crucial to the meta of ironman herblore training.
---
with runelite it really is very simple
---
I feel like thats his point.  Having access to the multitude of clients allow cheating.  I guess they would have to crackdown and enforce a set client to prevent it otherwise there's not a whole lot to do about it.
---
Its when you click a prayer on and off in a certain pace and the game doesnt know wtf is going on so it registers that your prayer is on but you dont lose any prayer points.
---
I think theres a bit more to it than that
---
I see. That makes sense then. Thanks for the help!
---
The buy-in amount will go directly to the winners though, it is not kept by the clan leaders. It's meant to act as more of an incentive to not drop out, as the bingo is meant to be team based.
---
Idk it just kinda seems like an abuse of a mechanic in the game
---
That's not the context of the post though. He's saying that if prayer flicking was as simple/braindead as people were stating it as, then he's asking those people to demonstrate completion of Inferno without the use of supplies, which is heavily reliant on accurate flicks. However, there's other skills outside of prayer flicking involved in Inferno, such as an understanding of pathing, safespots, quick switching and situational awareness.  Gear and levels are not the barrier to Inferno, it's almost 90% skill. People have done Inferno with rune crossbows in the past.
---
Nothing abnormal
---
Modded clients are against the [Jagex T&amp;C](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms) (section 8), but they won't enforce it.
---
Basically: Feel free to use cheat clients until they change the rules. With a majority of the playerbase using them, they won't be gone any time soon. I completely doubt it's going to be another case of "removed for game integrity" like 6-hour combat AFKing was. I'm in the minority here when I say I'll just stay away from OSRS until they ban cheat clients.
---
I think it's pretty grey too, that's why I asked. We keep everything we do within the rules and would like to ensure that this is not against the rules before we do it.
---
Turning on your prayer for a fraction of a second then turning it off and somehow that meaning you’re entirely protected.

Oh I see. I understand why some think that could be controversial lol

They can be hypocritical, who cares. As long as the changes are good then idc.
---
1) maybe thats true, but in an event that someone gets mad at the results and decides to out the situation, i would like to know that what we are doing is within the rules so there can be no downfall.  
---
2) thats why we think it may be fine, but i believe the randomness of the drop rates may make it considered a game of chance, which is why i'm being cautious about doing it without knowing fully
---
Umm, I kept all the stackables which is like 90% of the drops, buried the bones (got 60-75 prayer burying wyvern bones alone), and then used one of the wyvern cc's to sell things like ppots, keys, etc. The people come to you and pay like 60% of the price, but you don't have to leave so it's free gp.

It’s got nothing to do with it being a surprise, it’s about the dude being a asshole for the sake of being an asshole

---
If you’re training it with slayer and want to be efficient with your time I’d recommend; barrage tasks on defensive, whip on attack, and crush tasks on strength obviously, you won’t get a lot of crush tasks (trolls/kalphite/gargs/cerb) in comparison to whip tasks so while you’re afking do Dharok NMZ for strength.

I'm not a fan of the changes you listed nor am I a fan of fixing anything the guy above was suggesting. No inconsistency here.

Its one of the core tenets of cognition, I never said that thought was unavoidable, that would be quite dangerous lmao, but there is this relationship between what we want to think and what we think and how we act - do you think that every overweight person wants to be fat? There is definitely some things that are unconscious, some things that we think of but don't want to consider and all kinds of things, I assure you that at the very least you do not have as good a control over what you think than you think you do.
---
Here is a good overview of it if as you say you're graduating soon and have access to scientific journals.
---
Lol. The seed is 10k more than a ranarr seed and the herbs have a 1k cost difference. Im not retarded man. It's 10 where it passes. Look at the calculator I linked l. Lots of other stuff on there the guy has a great tool.
---
Hate suggesting this but private servers are awesome to practice on.. you spawn with full gear and allow you to learn mechanics
---
Damn your eyes!
---
I'd pay 30k for a cosmic rune pack
---
Not even 7m/hr, in order to get the "5x the polled xp rates" you pay 16m~. Really don't see the problem there lol
---
It really isn’t pvp though.
---
It’s a cat and mouse game. You attack a defender until hes dead and that’s it.
---
Same! So much pain when the shops are dry
---
pvp bad!!!!!11 upvotes to the left boys
---
Hmm the seeds we're like 6k difference when I checked and 1200gp herb difference last time I checked, figured it couldn't have changed that fast, my bad
---
I laughed way too much at this.
---
I would suggest to put this Cosmic Rune shop at the Cosmic Altar, but instead of using coins to purchase it, he'll only accept unnoted pure essence.
---
Only epic runescapers will understand this may-may😎
---
Interesting.
---
&gt;I don't understand why people want it gone. Can someone fill me in on why and also, those who want it gone - do they make use of the mechanic themselves?
---
How about a mechanic that doesn't completely invalidate 2 other mechanics in the game - pray/super restore pots and +prayer gear.
---
You swine XD
---
You don't have to worry so much. I would focus on had, then when you are getting into the groove of praying, start agroing some healers.  Even if he's full hp, once you have the healers out of the way jad will be ezpz
---
I see what is the problem here. Let me remind you the three key factors how Ironman looting bag works:
---
4) When you pick up items which Ironman isn't allowed to pick up, it goes into the Ironman looting bag. These items may be items dropped by other players or loot from your owned = pk'ed victims in PvP.
---
5) **IRONMAN DOES NOT HAVE AN ACCESS TO ANY ITEM INSIDE THE IRONMAN LOOTING BAG!**
---
 6) To empty it, you give the content to non-Ironman of your choice by using it to them just like bonds so it has same confirmation messages like bonds does. This way you can deposit your treasures to your alt accounts or anyone else - all deserved by your Ironman. 
---
These means that Ironman loots non-Ironman loot, but does NOT get the items to himself - those items goes to the player who the Ironman wants to give them, like an alt. Pk'ed loot remains in mains and NOT A SINGLE LOOT will go to the Ironman. I am not stupid - I know that if Ironman gets even a single item from pk'ed loot, it is unfair and wrecked system.
---
Is there anything else unclear to you?
---
I'm a PvMer and I agree with the PKer actually, thr memes about PKers killing people doing clues have gotten so much exposure that people genuinely think it's what PKers want to be doing.
---
Sure there's probably a couple of people that do it for fun in the wildy, but if you talk to anybody that PKs then you'll know they want an actual fight.
---
No one has claimed that PvM should be nerfed.
---
No one is claiming that PvM isn't the biggest part of the game, it very clearly is. The reason it is? because we can't get a single good PvP update through, not because everyone adores PvM so much more. I've been a pker since I was a kid, but lately I find myself PvMing - not because I like it more - but because PvP is such a fuckfest, and an unsustainable fuckfest that JaGex does nothing about. The amount of times I've gone out pking only to have someone sit in a glitch spot and dick on me is extraordinary.
---
Bounty hunter? A joke, so densely packed that you find yourself clicking on a random passerby's every fight. The ping is disgusting for anyone not in the region the server is in. (Pking on BH worlds as an Aussie is nearly impossible, I've had to deal with 800+ ping at times)
---
Trying to BH PK? Hit twice with the MSB then gmaul spec and tab out. You either kill them now or you kill them in 15 seconds when you come back.
---
The worst part? JaGex is silent, they have a conference with CONTENT CREATORS, not letting any of the actual well known GOOD pkers have a say in anything, PKing on a private server is actually better than PKing on ACTUAL old school at this point because it's actually sustainable and you need not worry about glitch spots or the like.
---
You cant buy prayer flicking or 3t fishing.
---
What part of "ironmen stand alone" do you not understand? You are literally describing an ironman teasing items to his alt. Are you on the spectrum?
---
Looks like prayer flicking jad is the only option here...
---
*Oh shit, here we go again*
---
This is a shit argument that serves no purpose other trying to shut down discussions.
---
What's the issue tho, if you're in the wildy don't complain about being pked. 
---
Complain that Jagex's only way of appealling to the PvP community is b ly adding bait in the wildy for PvMers.
---
Jesus, first 99 already at 1300 total lol, dont have single 99 at 2000 total
---
Is it happening for sure?
---
Oblivion pvm client that has op raids and tob plugins some of which jagex had removed from original runelite
---
I think a better example of what he's trying to say is the shit we freshly had about warding. from the official post there was an insane amount of possible content already and then we had a swarm of people picking that 1 thing that they didn't like and used it as a reason for voting no and that the skill is trash, while completely being oblivious of the fact that certain things can be voted out or changed. but nope many ppl just jump on the hate train with a new skill.
---
Fire wave into gmaul
---
Regarding swimming, lots of inaccuracy:
---
- ardy is not the same intensity as swimming, and u have assumed 99 agility xp rates from swimming so u shud be taking brimhaven or werewolf course xp rates for comparison.
---
- thieving has an extremely good afk method in ardy knights that is significantly less effort for high xp.
---
- Along with the high intensity tradeoff you also have to deal with scaling until 99 meaning u don't get these rates when ur training from 90 like you would on ardy course.
---
- You are forced to train 2 skills at once, this should b rewarded as well.
---
Bottom line, if I'm putting in more effort, forced to train 2 skills at once and have to be 99 to achieve these rates in the first place, then these xp rates are perfectly balanced.
---
Zeah library is even more inaccurate:
---
- the method they want to nerf has almost nothing to do with runelite. They are talking about nerfing banking books which is the method woox pioneered with impboxes.
---
- should we nerf all lamp methods because they are all not technically the skill they are giving xp in. Nerf genies, nerf temple trek, nerf quest rewards. Redundant argument.
---
- Essence is really not that hard to get on an ironman, and why does every method need essence to give rc xp? tiaras don't require essence? Just arbitrary rules ur making...
---
I don't think its really attractive to ppl that didn't play back in the day, my yt analytics say that less than 0.1% of my viewers are under 18.(My channel has 3.5million views so it can be considered ok data)
---
45 isn't that difficult, if you aren't interested in doing farming grinds, you can start by ploughing fields in Hosidius for the favour, and then move onto making fertiliser which will give you 2 xp per fertiliser, it'll take you a while but you can do that to lvl 34 as well as gaining 100% favour and then use Tithe farm until lvl 45.
---
This is what I used to start my farming training.
---
couldn't they fix this by making the first tick happen on activation?
---

Can I wear your cowboy boots, Randy?

Imagine people starting all this ruckus over something that’s been in the game for who knows how long over absolutely fucking nothing. It’s like they want to see the world burn.
---
When I turn on status bars both my hp and prayer are on the left side of my inventory
---
Lol yeah will be interesting to see how xarpus times are effected
---
Yep. Basically, anything that was technically possible in the 2007 backup is pretty much safe, even if it wasn't well known or known at all. It's only content that is either added after 2007, or was polled at a specific rate that will be touched.
---
It would be a different story if the poll at the time acknowledged that rates would be much higher with runners, and in theory Jagex could always offer a new poll to allow ZMI Running back in if the community wants it, as at least then it would have been polled.
---
about tree fiddy
---
What do the plugins do?
---
you can look for ppl who want alted raids. They might let you in.
---
Have you ever done any high-intensity PvM with prayer flicking? You can’t just leave one prayer on and take no damage in Inferno, GWD, raids, etc., because you’re taking more than one style of attack. That’s why you have to prayer flick and that’s why it’s superior to just leaving one prayer on. 
---
Your hypothetical is only true if it were possible to turn on all 3 protection prayers at the same time.
---
Yes they are significantly better, increasing task length by 33%, shortening by 20% is just too strong. The devs didn't think about what those bracelets actually do.
---
Take some darts and a bulwark, whenever you have spec you can easily group up with bulwark :)
---
Because you have to do practice it to do it correctly
---
Listen to the liquor, bud - the liquor will show us what to do

I've tried connecting to other humans.  I still have mental scarring from it over a decade later, and was close to being beat down for having different beliefs than my peers.
---
That might just be my graduating class though.  Social interaction is somewhat overrated if you don't have/can't make a plan to kill everyone you meet.
---
Well there is literally a drama calendar
---
&gt;Not sure if it was actually worth the opportunity cost
---
It wasn't, although I do remember using them for gathering charms at rock lobsters. I used proper armour in SW, especially the hybrid sets.
---
&gt; Dragon gloves also give you an xp and accuracy vs dragons on slayer task 
---
IIRC they only worked with melee pre-EOC and void or barrows gloves were better.
---
&gt; fishing and runecrafting gloves
---
RC gloves definitely weren't. I did buy the swordfish gloves on a hunt for a big swordfish, but was definitely not efficient.
---
&gt;  especially if you were a high level with claws 
---
Claws + steel titan + chaotics + curses + hybrid armour was free tokens, which is probably a contributing factor as to why it became quite inactive on P2P.
---
Wtf u talking about 😂
---
2k kills and I still just walk around on the acid phase. Id rather not push my luck and guarantee the kill
---
Good god, I haven’t seen this animation in forever.

Yeah they did it looks pretty sick was hoping for it in the main game
---
Don't, he will learn the error of his ways.

Wines stop failing at 68 cooking. From 68-99 Cooking you need to make 62,147 Jugs of Wine, at a cost of 8,389,845 gp.
---
It's all here: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_Cooking_training#Levels_68-99_%E2%80%93_Jug_of_wine
---
I didn't read "North" cause I just assumed they were going to take away the useless obstacle
---
In edge where you would pk with a "melee" pure you will get destroyed by msb to melee, or dragon knifes to crossbow to melee.
---
The problem is that range to melee stacks really well and you can get range lvl's without gaining combat(If you disregard hp, but high hp is usually good for pures tbh).
---
The combat calc only takes the highest of attack+str, floor(range * 1.5), floor(mage * 1.5) into consideration. So if you have all three balanced its the same as only having one.
---
yeah.. I have the same thoughts like you.. Hopefully they make drastic changes to get rid of unwanted players.. there was a time I saw a cmb lvl 71 lost his 80mil from RNG bots sadly...
---
The olmlet drop rate is effectively 1/1700 raids (850 hours) with an optimal performance in a 3 man team with 115cb, about 2.5x the drop rate a tbow in the same situation.
---
So no, it isn’t realistic to get it in a carry where you will have much lower odds. If you have the mage and range level you can raid on a pure but keep in mind people are less keen to raid with pures to begin with.
---
"north"
---
Shit meme.
---
Well, his name is “Lives_For_Downvotes” lol
---
The big thing I'd suggest is getting range up and strength up. You'll need both to effectively inflict damage without getting stomped on by maxed pures or maxed meds. Somethings to look out for are learning people's names (usually add to ignore list) of those that are baits. Which is another thing, if someone is fighting you and acting like you're beating him yet he's just chugging down on brews not fighting back, he could be a bait to make you lose pots and eventually tb you with a team for a chance of smiting you. Luckily it sounds like you're pking with a friend so you can get a box from him. Be ready to lose money, don't be toxic and sometimes ask other pkers for advice (9/10 they'll usually help you). Always keep prot item on if you're skulled and just hopping worlds, can't tell you how many times i almost lost an ags because I didn't have prot item on and someone attacked me instantly. Practice on tourney worlds, or go to w2 clan wars portal for risk free fights. Don't waste your money on rune pouches unless you're confident you'll only go down if a team logs on you (or else you're just burning money for 2 less invent spots). Most importantly man, just enjoy it. Pking deep wildy is one of the funnest things I've ever experienced in a video game.

I agree in any other game this would of been fixed. It would of been seen as way too good and would force people to use it.

The last man standing was unplayable unless you were good on flicks.

It's bug as hell and you never should have infinity prayer regardless of clicking more or not.

Why you gotta treat my favourite ToB npc like that...

He doesn't have to much involvement in the wiki.
---
But he is making new versions of the quest guides currently that are "faster", since his old ones are really made for noobs.
---
The wiki quick guides are only really something for ppl who already know the game, the visual of him doing the stuff is really helpfull for new ppl.
---
Epic. I got a super set from my 19th hard clue earlier today. Seems to be everyone’s lucky day.

He's just staring at his shrimp, looking at all its viens and legs, meanwhile the fishing/cooking instructor can't get him to light a fire.

Wait I swear Hosidious rework was delayed a few weeks ago cause it wasn't quite ready. With no update next week, when are we actually getting it?
---
Also, your third party client has a screenshot button.

Both of those have trash drop tables. Gargs is like 400k gp an hour.... what the fuck do they want to nerf it to?

Peak efficiency.

I remember the last part of the fight that you couldn't safespot being the issue I had. Of course, I suck at the game though. When I got my level 85 quest cape, the dragon slayer 2 everybody was scaring me about I did on my first try. And the monkey madness 2 everybody was telling me was easier took dozens of tries.
---
What did we do to deserve Mod Ash?

Mlm is garbage xp
---
It raises your combat level, which he doesn't want because he's a pure.
---
He didn't.
---
Oh woops, i didnt realize it was on the wiki, sorry for wasting your time!
---
So only 62,146 will give me about 200 xp to work with?

TY for the very fast response.

But most people agree it wasn’t overpowered

Original app was also rushed and buggy as shit on launch, I'll never stop using Reddit is Fun.

Lol? The color spectrum has waaaaaay more than 50 colors

Safespot stuff with fire strike that you'd kill for money if you were training any other combat stat. It pays for itself, which is good for people who don't have a bunch of money to start with.

I don’t use it a lot my bwana.

But posts like this one inspire me.

Manked never said non wildy content should be nerfed, he said the reward should be relative to the risk. Right now we have barely any risky pvm outside the wilderness and u can literally rake in 3m per hour doing vork or zulrah. Right now the wilderness has the potential to add that high risk factor in high rewarding pvm. It’s not just pkers wanting to kill free loot, it’s a cycle, pvmers get pked by nooby pkers, skilled pkers kill nooby pkers, skilled pkers kill skillled pkers. This is why wildy altar, black chins, lava maze, and revs are all pking hotspots. Also, antipking as a pvmer is hella fun. (Just learn to avoid skull tricks)
---
No one is arguing that pvm is the most active community, especially with the current efficiency gp/exp per hour meta. But there is a clear desire for pvp content in the wilderness (look at how many content creators thrive off their wilderness pking streaming/videos, torvesta, ditter, abyss, amenity, framed, just to name a few). Imagine if pvp got 1/10th the amount of effort and updates pvming got, it would literally revive the pvp community entirely and thrive. 
---
I think where most pvmers are wrong with pvp is that they think the wilderness was solely meant for pkers to bully clue hunters. It’s not, it’s one of the only unqiue places in the game where high risk content can be created. Of course there should be more pvp content outside the wilderness, especially geared towards teaching new players pvp mechanics (elo arena of some sorts), but ultimately i believe the most rewarding (in terms of gp/exp) content should be placed in the wilderness.
---
What a sad dysfunctional place.
---
So are pots just not worth using in slayer at all? I am new to osrs and thought that most people seem to use them?
---
This isn’t what op is saying, not even close. 
---
The drop message threshold built into the game is completely separate from Runelite taking a screenshot when you receive a drop of a self determined value. Runelite doesn’t notify you of the drop, it just takes the picture and throws it in your screenshot folder with the thousands of other 1440p screenshots of you getting bloodveld heads
---
If ur here from the start I understand what this guy says
---
you mean hornless unicorns?
---
Okay so if we get runners to say wrath runes should we change that?

Nah, this guy's use of the word 'anymore' makes zero sense

Because I was getting paid to do it, and it was damn good money.

Currently not really possible I don't think. Not even memeing but from what I recall it's something to do with the way that the engine plays the midi files - the sounds are all downloaded then the engine just reads instructions on how to put them together in a sequence to make whatever song (this is my really simple and semi-guess on how it works!).
---
The engine doesn't really know when songs end and music is linked to areas in-game a lot of the time or triggers when you do something. So it's all woven together (again just what I've picked up).

Most of my magic, and almost all my smithing and fetching exp was doing this till 100m cash pre-game. Glorious.

THAT IS JUST INSANE LOL
---
Pathetic
---
Nice
---
Everyone prayer flicks... it’s easy as fuck lol. Some are way better at it than others, but 1/1000 lol?
---
Exactly. That why they aren't nerfing lavas or anything else. They didn't poll those to have different xp rates. They want xp rates to be what was polled for everyone.
---
That's true. Beating the record of being strucked by lightning the most amount of times is easy too and not surprising record to break. All it takes is to be lucky with RNG and let the lightning hit you 8 times.
---
If it allowed one to achieve xp rates that surpass the polled rates, yes. Jagex are doing nothing less than honoring the polling system, why are people losing their mind over this?
---
It has way less when you eliminate colors that cannot be reliably distinguished between by people with various forms of colorblindness or vision impairments (maybe still over 50, but **much** less than the sixteen million colors you have available).
---
Pots should always be used, just don't do that super combat defense repot bullshittery the other commenter is on about.

That seed/sapling identification is lit. Awesome work.

That’s some serious persistence. Grats

Sure man, believe what you want about this sub, because in reality it's full fucking shitheads

This is in line with the qna where they said it would be a few things slightly above target
---
Oops, sorry 🙃
---
? No one is forcing u to go into the wildy. Just like no one forces u to go to inferno to get the bis cape. You do what content u enjoy. I for one enjoy tanking shitty teams and antipking while pvming/skilling in the wildy. I dislike that the best exp rates from fishing and mining come from 3-tick manipulation, would I vote no against more content geared towards them? No, I would just not participate in them because I know some people do enjoy them.
---
You know how you can right click the Varrock tele and click GE, I wish it would also work the other way around.

They would, and then be outraged because they couldn't afford it.

The people that can do that are a massive exception to the rule. B0aty can perfect prayer flick and tick eat and can't do that lol. Don't forget to downvote this one guys :D
---
&gt;To be more precise, you do over time lose prayer points, it's just extremely slow and you can do it for a very long time before running out.
---
No, if done correctly, it IS infinite. Woox has completed inferno with a single prayer point.

I don't play myself so I guess it could have changed, but I swear I remember them being the BIS glove unlock from RFD (at least back in RS2)
---
This legit?
---
Facts learn to click another player in the wildy then 5 pieces of armour and your spec attack.

That's just a mistake every now and then. If done correctly you should drop zero points.
---
Source: I do all my Slayer tasks with protection + Piety and although I often break concentration to drop from 72 to 70 by the time I finish the task, there have been tasks where I stay fully attentive for all 150+ kills and haven't dropped a point below 72.

Whoa there, 256 attempts? Good thing you got it on that one or you would have went over the limit for an unsigned 8-bit integer and broken the game.

Yes, someone is selling them. Default stock is 0.

 I always used SGS specs to never use any prayer during all the waves, I had all my supplies left when I got to Zuk. 
---
At tripple jads I used the two Falador shield actives to recharge my prayer, I also waited till the next day to recharge my Fally shield active, but that ended up being not necessary. I guess I could have used a lot more sanfews during the first waves to get a faster run.

Android you can

It... defeats... the... purpose...

Only once. I finally managed to save a few mil. Bought a Fury and a cheap pvp set up to see how that is like. Forgot to take off the amulet, wasnt quick enough to protect item. Died. Was very upset. Someone else was likely very happy.
---
Runelite has a plugin where an indicator moves through quick pray icon to show you when the game tick happens so you know when to click.

I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted, it's an existing feature lol

Again, the point of a pin is for extra protection.  If it's too inconvenient for you, then just disable the pin.

I have this exact same sentiment. Glad I'm not the only one who thinks this

Ahh, I didn't know that, my bad

Yes,this animation came after the rework in rs2
---
I realize that
---
So what is your point here
---
holy questline
---
Wahh wahh my experience was bad
---
Probably. Relog fixes the issue.
---
Because it’s 180k/hr for one of the slowest skills and the proposed and polled exp/hr was ~46k/hr at 99. Money has no factor in this. People could run bot scripts or alts to still attain said exp rates.
---
It’s unfortunate your money making method of running ess is shot down, but maybe you can try running ess at lavas or learn vorkath/zulrah
---
What? Why?
---
No I just can't bring back enough of the nostalgia to play OS instead of rs3, ALSO it doesn't help that my MAIN account was "hacked"? I don't actually know what to call it actually. But the individual/s who gained access to an account I okay regularly on RS3 was literally training it as a range pure.
---
I mean, there wasn't any signs of obvious botting, the password wasn't changed etc, but even "starting" with 70+ range I just can't do it. I loved it when I was a teenager but reinvesting my time into OS just feels like a drive I can't seem to find
---
No way it took u 256 attempts lol
---
&gt;w&lt;
---
Slayer is more fun than mining
---
You can do that too. That's called "lazy flicking". What is described above is known as "1-tick flicking".
---
The reason that lazy flicking isn't the more commonly employed version of flicking is because you can't sync up the offensive and defensive prayers if you flick this way unless your attack cycle matches up with the attack cycle of the NPC you're fighting. 1-tick flicking eliminates this problem by having both sets of prayers active every tick for a flash of a second, so it doesn't matter whether you're on the same cycles. This is especially helpful when the speed of your weapon doesn't match the NPC's attack speed.

For my first successful fire cape I killed them one at a time ASAP which went fine and I guess Jad must have been just under full hp because they never respawned

I personally think pornography is not the best thing on the planet, and for the most part warps our views on sexuality in a negative way. But there's something very wrong with that sub and the people that participate there. Like, apparently after not beating their meat for about two months their voice is now deeper and their memory is 10 times better. They couldn't talk to girls and had terrible social anxiety because they were wanking it?
---
I have no problem with **what** they're doing, but more so I just think there's something way more wrong with those people than just porn and masturbation. But if it's working for them I guess my input doesn't really matter, it just came off as sad and dysfunctional. Not being able to interact with a woman because you masturbate is just... weird I guess.
---
"Noun"
---
Could take the approach Runelite takes on adding a logged in timer and put it on the report button - something like "Report - 10:53AM".
---
I can understand though if the team feels like that it makes it less clear for more casual players as to the buttons function.
---
No this is not legit haha, you need rfd for Barrows gloves
---
My exact thoughts.  I finished 99 rc on mobile like 2 months ago -\_-
---
It doesn’t. They were attempting to create a method to send instant feedback from the maze to the runners but it hasn’t been done, maze is the exact same speed with or without client. If you want to make a misclick/losing track of maze argument these are the wrong players to apply it to. Again, I think the client is broken but it doesnt apply as much in this scenario.
---
The point of the point and click bank pin is that it's impossible to have your pin leaked if you have a keylogger (which is what would give away your password and email in this situation) they have said this many times on stream before. This suggestion is bad and it will never happen. Please go crawl back under the rock you came from and fish your brain out of the gutter.
---
Okay, okay good, they got me
---
nice
---
&gt; unpolled fix
---
Irony is the whole reason  they have made the change is that the XP rates are way different from the POLLED rates, theyre literally trying to follow polls closer with this fix.
---
I logged every attempt, the wave i died on and the supplies I used to get to that wave, the first 100 attempts I never used any restores or brews, big mistake. 
---
Looking back I should have used as many brews as possible but I was dumb lol
---
Not yet
---
hmm, i would have expected a bit more value for that much xp
---
Cool I didn’t know it was Swahili word originally, thanks. I had a friend from Kenya who used to use it. I guess it means the native Karamjans are coded African.
---
I started the Inferno not knowing how to pray flick so ye
---
nah
---
Could be. Seems silly to outlaw this kind of stuff 🤷‍♂️
---
Find me the poll where nature alter was added to OSRS with specific polled Xp rates?
---
BiS for alphabetical hydrangeas
---
As it should be tbh
---
No, only RS3 has thief guild.
---
is it not good?
---
How do you know if someone smokes? Don't worry they'll tell you.
---
Why no banking?
---
WEED
---
This is why I quit runescape all together. Too many bugs and everyone is overly focused on the most efficient ways to do things instead of having fun. But I’m sure RuneScape will either get bought out completely or shut down within the next 5 years if their numbers keep dropping
---
You would only have to pay for the supplies lost. Completely safe death you spawn right outside the cave with everything.
---
Okay?
---
agreed. especially with the instankills. I wish there was some sort of health gate mechanic where if you have say 75% health remaining, the max damage you can take reduces you down to 5 hp or something very small. it can be disabled for pvp, but even not flicking, missing one prayer and instantly dying is extremely frustrating
---
I have no background or anything in that field, so this might be a pretty stupid question; but wouldn't it work (and imo kinda well?) if the pin didn't go in the slits, but like 'grab' it at around the green x here https://i.imgur.com/yXYl0nj.png
---
(Yea, english not my first language either, so I'm already having problems describing it haha)
---
&gt; "only dealing" with it at Ouriana altar makes perfect sense if you're not stupid. Running essence hasn't been a thing people do since well before Ouriana was made.
---
That's just fundamentally not true.  People weren't running other runes while Ouriana was around because well... if I need to explain that we have other problems.  People have already gone back to running laws and probably natures too.
---
And don't even get me started on the whole thought process behind banning "unintended training methods" that have existed forever.  If they're banning Ourania trading, logically they should also ban tick manipulation.
---
How is NMZ any more overpowered than any other 10min afk Combat method? Combats have always been 10-20min afkable, since the beginning of runescape. Stop crying about it.
---
unintented
---
Reddit really turned into a big cash grab. Glad reddit doesn't go down anymore however /s
---
I get this every day of the week, sometimes twice in 1 day.
---
Don't know why I'm sharing that.
---
I need help.
---
And the majority of them don’t even smoke. 🙄
---
Sure, if you like getting pkd every 20min.
---
New fastest clear for theater of blood was made like yesterday. And now one of the bosses can be done faster.
---
I would say cannon giants, note the bones, put them into a looting bag and just switch combat styles before getting 99 of any other skill.
---
Look forward to the lava running rates.
---
How much money per hour is TOB if you can complete 3 raids per hour?

i honestly dont get it? Ive been at zeah rc for 10 days now, and am there now, I see no difference? What even changed?

---
Ale of the Gods I believe.
---
I'm sure EoC could have been implemented in a better way that improved the game. The idea isn't a bad one tbh it's just the execution was horrendous.
---
No.  Not with that kind of luck.
---
Teleport to a bank and teleport back to catacombs. You’re not doing it for the money you’re doing it for the xp, the money is just to cover expenses.
---
Nah man, I ain’t an Indian giver
---
The game updates every .6 seconds.  You "flick" that prayer on the same game "tick" and turn it back off so you don't waste prayer.  There's also a way to flick it so you never lose prayer points but that's a little more advanced.
---
They should poll its re addition then.
---
Wilderness diary allows you to catch them in noted form
---
The percentage of osrs players that can pray-flick in boss encounters is very low, and of that only a fraction bother with it consistently because it’s just too much effort.
---
What’s unhealthy for the game is having no skill cap - there is a general trend in gaming recently to design games that can be completed by everyone with minimal effort and these games very quickly become boring af for a significant base. 
---
The best games will have content with very high skill ceiling that few will have the drive to learn or be able to do. 
---
Tick manipulation at this level is for people who enjoy games like Sekiro or dark souls. And the people on this sub are akin to the npcs screaming for an easy mode in Sekiro - don’t fucking but the game if you don’t want to do it! Likewise you don’t need to be this good at tick manipulation to do most content in this game but don’t complain about the inferno etc because just like Sekiro that isn’t designed for every single casual player who wants to have a go.
---
I'd like to see these people try 1.5t teaks lmao
---
NOOOOOOOOOO. Fuck, they shouldn't balance boss around prayer. FUCK
---
The agility shortcut was previously coded as two seperate click able rocks. So if you where running back from the dark altar and accidently clicked on the bottom rock your character would run all the way around instead of taking the shorcut. Now it doesn't matter where you click on the rock.
---
Holy shit that's fucking dope
---
Bad argument. Zmi was meta for quite a while.
---
Calling bullshit. First off, it's a hard clue that requires a crozier. Second, I've bought a crozier both times I've gotten that clue, paying ~25k each time.
---
Lahey how fucked are you?
---
6/10
---
Hope you had your mouse/character setup different while training
---
You're right, 2011 didn't have anything like the blowpipe.
---
What 2011 did have though was full ganodermic armor and polypore staff, what you could do is go through the caves with magic (2 full staves just in case) and camp protect range on jad, and never switch prayer. He'd max like a 40 on you with magic because of ganodermic's magic absorb lmao
---
Yeah but not in 2200, you get shunned if you talk in a 2200 world
---
I said
---
&gt;because 180k xp an hour in runecrafting is fucking unacceptable
---
and you said
---
&gt;Ok, then they should have made the altar use a special kind of essence that isn't tradeable similar to zeah runecrafting, or better yet, don't give the altar ridiculously inflated xp rates to begin with.
---
So, to be clear: do you agree with me that 180k exp per hour, regardless of method or cost, is broken if that exp is in runecrafting?
---
If you do, your comment beginning with "ok" was clumsy. If you don't, you are wrong.
---
That isn't 1 tick flicking, that's lazy flicking which isn't tick manipulation (you still lose pray points just at a slower rate).
---
Maybe ask Runelite devs to help out with that
---
Are you OK, bro?
---
Yeah, 'cause the ge isn't full of beggars and bots lol
---
Which is less exp per hour and more click intensive for the crafter.
---
damn that's like 200k/kill in uniques alone :P
---
Am I missing the joke?
---
How do u note items as an uim?
---
Fuck, I wish I was that cool
---
Use them on a bank teller
---
&gt; because a bunch of overpowered shit was added everthing else going forwards is balanced if it matches that level of overpowered?
---
If an update is useless for irons you can be damn sure its even more useless for norms
---
Shoulda made him blue
---
I thought u could only un-note and not directly note items?
---
Just download f.lux to eliminate the bright blue light emitted from your monitor and it'll reduce the eye strain.
---
If that's the only exposure to WoW you've had you havn't even scratched the surface. The level of no life involved in ultra high end WoW (world firsts, top 10 raiding ) complately eclipses all but the most ultra hardcore RS players. 12-16hr+ days are expected amd required at that level
---
if ur ping is stable u can do it, but if its not u cant
---
so am I allowed to autoclick for this or do I have to break my finger and my mouse in order to do certain content
---
Lucifer's arugula
---
Kapwing?
---
Shit maybe they changed it
---
Idk about beginner I've never really done them. But I do all the easy, medium and hard. You have a chance at getting ranger boots out of a medium. So that's a quick 30m.
---
Respectfully, fuck you.
---
Ok I got it! You have to stalk dragon imps for the bone drops since they drop noted boners!
---
Ba can be fun minigame but, honestly, torso grind is 2-4+ hrs of 0xp grinding depending on your team and knowledge of the minigame. One can easily grind gp or study the runescape economy (merching and such) to get money for bcp.
---
I found money making till bcp much easier alternative than torso, because i had never played ba when i was a noob in osrs.
---
You can’t note bones as UIM, only un-note.
---
I can’t honestly be bothered to pray flick, as long as they don’t make it so you need to pray flick for anything I’m fine
---
Shit I didn’t think of that.
---
And? That doesn't just give them the right to use any word they want. That is THEIR word and for anyone else to use it... Well you might as well give them all spears and loinclothes and treat them like savages. I can't believe this level of cultural appropriation is still happening in 2019 smh bruh. Separate but equal.
---
If you think prayer flicking makes prayer levels useless then I encourage you to post a video of you doing inferno Cox and tob all with only 1 prayer point.
---
  
---
Apparently it's useless so you should be able to do it no problem, right? It is infinite prayer, right?
---
Rune armour and a rune scimitar. Green dragon hide for range.

No it isn't

Immature response that doesn’t even make sense since most people probably use the metronome, nice:) just so you know, saying wah more than 3 times in one sentence makes you seem like the man child, nobody else..

Yes. Finally there are people who are willing to run me ess at fire altar. I was losing 20k/h being confined to zmi.

At current prices it's around 44 gp profit per mahogany log.
---
&gt; Edit: also going to add in that I haven't ever used byte/sbyte in my programs. Do they even have use outside of coding for low memory devices?
---
You never handled arbitrary binary data?
---
Also any device becomes low memory if you're trying to store a lot of elements.
---
Lmfao, feel free to go back through my thousands of comments and see if your theory is true. I've never seen that user before, but I think my suspicions on disability may have been answered...
---
It may not be so much a nerf to their profit, but to what they drop. The number of resources can be problematic, even if the profit per hour is fine. And in some cases, they may only be lower profit now because they crashed the price of those drops from bringing too many into the game.
---
There also is the topic of how PvM compared to Skilling and if a Level 75 PvM Method should be better than similarlly level Skilling methods or such, but that is a far more complex issue and probably not as much what they are looking into.
---
Alright I’ll go that buy that thanks!

Will the summer membership sale be coming soon?

I’ve been 6 hour logged like 3 times I think. I play a ton, but I think a big reason is because I hop worlds so often lol

And here you could've just scrolled on, but instead decided to drop that brain dead response. Imagine replying to a comment when you have 0 knowledge on the subject.
---
agreed. this the type of stuff I would have found funny when I was 12, idk why you're getting shit on with downvotes.
---
I came from r/runescape cuz everyone says don’t be there if you play osrs, elitist in your own subreddit, and elitist in ours.. nice :,)

I always played on my wyvern alt when doing attempts, the cash you make from that is about 1:1 in costs when using rune darts.
---
You lose a bit when switching to dragon darts. But it wasnt too bad overall
---
Nice range flex
---
very cool kanye!
---
I've never understood that. Who plays a game to just stand around and make it like a shitty chatroom?
---
What is wrong with this fucking community
---
Depends, if you're just interested in playing casually then Waterfall Quest will set you with basic combat stats, then go Stronghold of Security to get 10k, you could loot for an hour or so to make some base money for gear then do what you want.
---
If you want to play efficiently, then you could do Waterfall Quest, then get the Thieving level for Fight Arena, then train at rock/sand crabs to get higher combat stats, do The Feud and then blackjack to a high Thieving level and have a decent starting cash stack as a result.
---
Nice! Tough pet grind out in my opinion. So boring lol
---
Same
---
This video is just one dude who made it to show his friend that I found in 5 minutes of searching. I guarantee this man isn't the prayer flicking pioneer.
---
I use reddit through my phones browser, using .compact to make everything into mobile friendly pages. I am the superior reddit browser. 5Head
---
overloads?
---
They have spoken about that several times before. There are multiple ideas on what to do with it and I don't think anything has been decided yet. Also, NMZ may be a problem but it wasn't polled with exp rates it exceeded like the other methods mentioned. If they say something will be 70K exp per hour max and it is 80K per hour, it is a lot easier to address that and bring it down to what is polled than figuring out what the hell to do with NMZ.
---
I see what you did there. Nice.
---
Well, we're not all rocket scientists

wahhhhhhhhh pray flicking wahhhhhhhhhh look at me im edgy im the demon 666 get it? its the devils number wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh slipknot is cool wahhhhhhhhhh

That's cool dude, but it's really completely irrelevant to this entire conversation.  You're just saying "lol you make no sense" and not actually addressing anything I'm saying.  If it acts like a troll, and looks like a troll...
---
Here is slayer musiq’s optimal quest guide! I’d highly recommend following it and using his quest guid. He will be your best friend when it comes to questing and he is a legend in the RS community. 
---
https://youtu.be/xn0X0PettxU

He has a link in the description of the YouTube video for a spreadsheet of the quest order :)

P.S. “Hi and welcome to my guide” will be in your dreams.

My problem is that I’m also buying palms, snapes, payment and a bunch of other stuff and I don’t have a ton of liquid cash. All I do is farm atm. The only time I really make any profit is when I get a lucky contract...

Shame what the Varrock/ Ardy elites did by introducing ranarr into the Karamjan culture. Back in my day all we had was guam. I mean you saw a little bit of tarro but nothing harder than that.

Censorship sucks man. Come to Canada :)
---
If people fall for the stakes they'll surely fall for this. Someone in my cc said yesterday they got their whole bankrole taken in a stake yesterday, bout 60m if I remember correct.
---
I went for it because I didn't like quests. About halfway through I realized they're actually pretty fun (imo). If you like the quest, try and do it normally and listen to the dialogue; otherwise, just look up a quick guide and skip the conversations. It's nice being able to not worry about quest requirements anymore.
---
Were there actual gravestones added to the game at some point? I seem to have a weird memory of a period where you had an actual gravestone where you died.

Oh yeah, I'm f2p and a good half the time people are talking about weed in the GE, this despite me only getting on for \~2 minutes a few times a week to merch.

Im 20 attempts in at just got past wave 60. This makes me feel better.

Get pest control points by repairing the gates instead of fighting.

Yeah it's called browsing Reddit. You know, what you're doing right now?

hehehehe i'm so edgy 666 guys

bet you watch rick and morty you brainlet
---
probably for some sort of scam or lure.
---
Ah that sucks. Thanks
---
The only part not fun about it is fighting for dust devil/nech spots. Otherwise I find it a lot of fun.
---
You implicitly said I was lying, I showed I wasn’t, and now my proof is irrelevant? 
---
You are barely even keeping up with this conversation, apparently. I don’t think I’ll take conversational cues from you, that’s for sure.
---
Definitely gonna want to get barrows gloves and firecape if you don't have those.
---
Aside from that, pick some diary bonuses that are relevant to you and slowly chip away from them.
---
Varrock hard for instance gives you a tele right to the ge and 60 battlestaves per day from zaffs shop. Those were very appealing to me, so I worked towards those for a bit.
---
Also, if you plan on grinding barrows, Morty hard diary will increase your profits significantly. It'll give you another excuse to get 70 prayer for piety.
---
Questing is never time wasted. You probably have some smithing and mining to do, as well as other skills, before you're able to do ds2 and I think that's a decent goal to work towards.
---
Monkey madness 2 unlocks demonic gorillas which are very good profit, but kind of click intensive to kill. Might be a good goal if you want to grow your bank.
---
Pretty much. I'm hopefully gonna get a new gaming pc soon and new monitor. Gonna be playing so much osrs lol
---
That’s NMZ dude, you could go AFK for 5 minutes there. Could have sex twice in that time.

Didn't realise how obnoxious the yellow was to be honest.
---
The reason it wasn't traceable was because slayer doesn't need another buff among the millions of buffs it's received. Cannons are the fastest way to kill most mobs by far, no need to make it even faster. Granite dust is a nice reward for those who feel like killing the boss some bc you're given the ability to make your cannon stronger for future tasks. That's not the problem with this boss.
---
Pretty sure this guy was trolling me, but he said he was 127kc dry for the gloves. I told him he had to complete rfd and buy it from the chest. Quickly, he says "I can buy from barrows chest?! Awesome, I'll go right now!" and teleports away.
---
Try to only eat while you’re walking during the acid phase or right after killing the spawn. You sometimes need to eat during DPS phases if you get hit by a few ranged attacks in a row but otherwise avoid eating when you could be attacking.
---
nah, but smith dragon sq shield req for Ardougne dairy
---
Not really worth. In most scenarios it's better to use offensive shield slot items, like god books or defenders. In the cases where you want a shield (tanky roles in high end pvm) there are better shields like Dragonfire Shield and Ely
---
I think it does look pretty cool though.
---
Jesus dude, I don't care if you're a fucking lawyer or not.  You're the one who's insisting on driving us down tangents further and further away from the original argument.  Hence, troll.
---
Charge your phone

Usually melee or range. Magic is usually too expensive and not as strong.
---
While prayer flicking was, tick manipulation was not widely known at OSRS release, which I think invalidates your entire point.
---
selling weed
---
If flicking per attack is lazy I don't wanna know what they call leaving my prayer on
---
Why are people expected to talk in public chat? Like my public chat is always off, especially when I first started 07scape.
---
It does make me feel better though.
---
Think that’s a little over exaggerated. Once your at end game content the cost of restores is pretty insignificant. I’d say the only real need for flicking rn is inferno. I’ve done pretty much every other piece of content in the game with relative ease and never 1t flick. Have about 1b bank
---
50/50 is a big stretch
---
So the game logs you out if you are on for 6hrs no matter if you are afk or not?
---
Considering you are whacking off to a dude fucking a girl it’s a little weird. Living an experience through a guy over the internet. Also you should do some research the Jews used pornography as a weapon vs the Palestinians at on point.

Not all of us are talented BJ masters that have 10 people lining up every hour bro

I dont mean to be rude but that's anecdotal evidence so it's completely irrelevant. Wyrms are really slow experiece per hour, even if you use dhcb/lance.

Personally I can't stand to look at their character models and animations because they give me epilepsy.

Not jagex's fault that you have poor account security. If you care about your wealth you wouldve put 2FA and pin on your account.

what would you say to this even if i had 2fa and pin and it still happen?
---
Stake
---
Same as the commenter below me, but on top of that is the finances as well. I'm not rich, so each time costs me 1.6k zulrah scales, 6 brews, and like tenish restores. Just some shitty head math here, but I think I spend roughly 500k per run. So on top of that, you're looking at had and thinking about your 243k cash stack in your bank thinking pleeeaaasssee don't let me have to go back to barrows.

Firefox for android set to desktop mode works actually.

Palms. Although I guess ranarr seeds are a similar price but always profit. Coconuts are good but barely make a dent
---
slay ehp is 90k/hr now btw

I did, because in reality you would have to nerf the gp/hr on every profitable thing in the game.
---
2176 KC still haven't gotten it =/

Alch yourself op.

No.
---
How much time total do you think? I'm thinking how much money you could have made in that time to get a tbow and ely. 
---
Serious congratulations. I aspire to do the same one day.
---
Chose real life commitments over do? Fake news
---
It scales it up but you also get more points 
---
Also alt carrying supplies more than makes up for the boost in difficulty
---
I hope we're not going down this nerf everything route. I know it's what the 3 tickers want but being able to play casually and still make some decent progress on my account has been great. It's not like the 3 tickers still have a shit ton of stuff that only they will ever get, best xp rates/speed raiding/inferno. I don't know why we need to retroactively nerf everything, going to be impossible to buy anything without constant boring as shit bossing.
---
Thank you man! It's not perfect, but it works exactly for what I want
---
My concern was never that any PvM content isn't possible, but it's certainly frustrating that not doing it makes it more difficult. Which is particularly frustrating for challenges like the Inferno. In fact, the only infernal cape I have achieved was by just 1t flicking and just accepting the pain (taking breaks in between the runs). I don't have much of a problem with anything else where the result is simply that I'll be slower those 1t flicking.
---
Further, while the Inferno is (for some) do-able 1t flicking, I think it's very clear it was balanced with 1t flicking in mind. That's not really a mindset I'm a fan of, I think it's a lazy way of balancing the game. And it doesn't make me particularly optimistic about where PvM will be in a few years.
---
Historically headless arrows were used for bird hunting. Often with considerably more feathers on the backs too. The lack of heads made them both less likely to ruin the meat and also safer to fire into the air.

I would say to check that your email isn't jeopardised on a website like haveibeenpwned, assuming you log in with an email. If you were to log in with a username, I'd suggest creating a stronger password.

2 goals I might start with are a mithril scimitar from the shop in the desert area near the place you spawned,  and a staff of air or fire from varrock (north of the desert area).
---
Sorry your little 3head confuses a little joke for trolling and condensation
---
or just y'know leave it how it is, considering the game is at the best place it's ever been thanks to updates catering towards the casual playerbase. Best money in the game is still raids, best gear is the game is from raids/inferno/hard shit, best xp rates is still doing tick manipulation shit. Why go back and nerf updates that don't even effect you?
---
Why dont people go the other way into varrock..noobs
---
It's entirely reliant on your ping. So yea, it is luck that you don't have a lag spike.

I'd suggest going to the website ASAP and updating your account security

that's k, it's a letter

Maybe if you could autocast

shhh im not maxed yet

I’m really unsure why it has 2.4k as the total, unless I made an account 6-7 years ago on rs2. But I really don’t remember doing that with this email
---
The content they're describing is the inferno and raids, there isn't really much other reason and if you're doing both of those things then you wind up being good at flicking regardless
---
Its rare af and corp is really annoying with low kills/hr so no one kills him
---
It is remarkable. This is a time based game. There are absolutely elements of skill and those are remarkable too. But you're gonna be hard pressed to argue that achievements in rs aren't principally based on time because they are. If you want the primary vehicle for achievement to be skill then pick, oh idk....literally any other game lol. You're in rs though, so that's the cards we play with

Tears of hunter here. Rc is one of my highest lvls tbh
---
can confirm. currently going for 99 mining and it's not a fun experience but it's basically the only decently afk option. Can't compare to amethyst mining as I am at 91 mining currently. Hoping it's not too crowded there
---
I just got back into OSRS (runescape in general, since I quit right after EoC landed), and I actually died to that already, lol.   
---
They really delivered with the nostalgia trip and stuff.

I think you're the pathetic one

It does follow that. My account is at 5800 days and that’s about 15 years...

You guys are some assholes

Read this as “8 hour shits,” and was worried for a minute but remembered I pretty much do the same since Mobile came out.
---
if he can perfectly prayer flick and tick eat then how does he die?
---
Ahh well in your calculator you put 99 hp so I assumed you already had 99 hp
---
I'd really like to see the infernal capes of all these people talking shit.
---
My account is 15 years old. OSRS wasn’t out then. It’s based on when your account was first created from the email/username you use to log in.
---
Hmm, thanks for the info. Hope it's not DOA content, could be interesting if it actually makes the crystal bow worthwhile.
---
Doesn't matter if it's difficult (which I don't think it is in any way).
---
Actually, I'd argue the infinite spam-click prayer method is nowhere near as difficult as prayer flicking.
---
With prayer flicking, you have to switch between your prayers and time it correctly with the incoming attacks - that I have no problem with. You also have to effectively time the activation and deactivation of damage buffing prayers 
---
With the "spam click your prayer for 100% active prayers and infinite prayers" issue, there is no skill because \*no matter your scenario, it works the same way\*. You never have to think, you just start spam clicking your prayer and you never lose prayer points while always having your buff.
---
No
---
Idk, maybe the accounts you guys are trying to log into got recovered?
---
I listen to Andrew Bwaena on youtube.
---
I rate this account 59/99.
---
Be sure to make time for real life &gt;.&gt;
---
They were removed because bots were adapted to deal with them and all they ended up doing was frustrating actual players who were just afk training. They were polled to be removed and passed
---
Lavas are what is being run now aswell as astrals. Bolth methods achieve similar xp to zmi for slightly higher runner costs.
---
Pmod mutes only last 2 hours they’re fucking useless
---
One reason not to would be spellbook clutter. If there were some way to scale up the damage better, I'd prefer that.
---
Smoking that good ranarr
---
But in FPS you can die if you lose a tick. and in runescape you could survive if you miss a tick also.
---
I laughed way harder than I should've
---
I ended up getting a sword too
---
Im 2223 total and I quit playing my main because I still don't have the RC pet at 21m xp

If only they removed that awful ditch.

Thx for reminding me to relog before I hop in NMZ

Lol I have an ironman that just needs dwh for solo raiding and I still know people that won't take it.

Y'all are just retarded and selfish. Imagine caring more about some potential pixels than including people you genuinely consider friends.

Isn’t bwana just mean outsider or non karamjan? Why do people meme like it’s similar to the n word?
---
Sooooo can someone tell me what the point of this would be? I’m not opposed to something changing but I couldn’t figure out what’s the actual incentive. This game and many other mini games died from terrible incentives. When we were children we didn’t care about xp/hr. Now their needs to be either some gp/hr or xp/hr.
---
"increased serotonin from nostalgia" You've got my support
---
Yeah I was gonna say, cause 2.4k days ago is mid 2012 when osrs was released in 2013. I must have a shitty rs3 account under the same email haha
---
I still can’t bring myself to learn cerb
---
Yes
---
you have bigger problems than ur small ping if it takes you 27 attempts to kill jad. After jad does its animation you literally have  3 ticks (1800 ms) to change to the right prayer. That means you have 1660 ms to change your prayer even with ur insanely high 140 ping.

That's exactly what i had last night! (15 hours ago)

I feel like this makes it worse
---
WELL DONE JAGEX
---
The joke says that it fucking sucks when you just want to get to varrock as a noob/pure skiller and you get smacked then have to run back to pick your shit up, which makes it even more likely that you will get killed again, since you are now standing still, picking your shit up.  
---
I don't know about you, but if I actually got into that situation I'd probably log out and not play for a week, and that says enough about how much it sucks. It might not be a big deal to you, but to some people it is.   
---
Literally nobody mentioned rape victims nor they care. Sucks that it happened to you, but we came here for memes and discussions about this game, not to listen to sob stories every time something offends someone.  
---
Speaking of which... Seriously, why don't you think about other people before complaining? Do you realize how ostracized must handless people feel when they cannot even complain on reddit about how shit their life is, while you get to do it every single day?
---
I can't believe people are actually taking this seriously
---
Hiring runners all the way to 99 can literally cost you billions, so its not like your average joe will suddenly all get rc capes outta nowhere. While alts can be used to pump up rates for so many other things besides rc at higher effort and higher sustain price
---
You got your capes early, you've enjoyed the "prestige" early. Now please don't go out of your way to drag everyone else to have to do what you've done
---
Fair enough. I guess being able to do the inferno with no supplies is legit aye bro.
---
Once you've received metamorphic dust and used it on your olmlet is it still possible to get more dust drops?

Where do you live in Canada, this is actually bullshit lol

It will log you out even if you are in combat.

GF has no high alch value too

The way i always remembered that rcb better vs def
---
Just because rcb better on low def.
---
I just learned about AHK. Do a lot of people use it? Seems really close to botting/ cheating. What’s the official stance?
---
We see how much the game thrives when 80% of community are maxed with 0 to do as any innovative ideas get shot down by simple minded folk like yourself
---
You WILL use your shitty bow with shitty arrows and you WILL enjoy it enough to grind the fuck out of chompy hunting for your diary!

Where's the bandos boots at noob, you're missing the most important item.
---
Easyscape
---
I had this as my wallpaper back in the day.
---
The fact that your average Joe can't do these methods shows that the high level community is more focused on the preservation of the game as a whole rather than making it less fun for new players as we often get accused of
---
Brilliant reference. My brother and I always said it more like "corky corky" haha
---
You can always leave it on the ground if you don't feel like you deserve the drop
---
maybe
---
Thanks that’s really helpful! Always thought people were just stupidly risky ahaha
---
&gt;So...have you cancelled your subscription? Cuz you should consider carefully exactly what you mean when you say confidently that "it isn't good enough". It seems to me like the product is good enough for to continue to pay for yeah? That's literally what that means.
---
My satisfaction with the game content as a whole is not entirely dependant on the results of the anti cheating team. If it was, I absolutely would've stopped playing long ago.
---
They don't get my money anymore though. Only bonds for me :)
---
Non-btw
---
I've seen a few houses in Yanille that are like this. Just a gilded altar.
---
Pretty inappropriate either way lol
---
I haven't tested it myself but I've seen images/videos of people being hit way over 10s. Solos still seem doable, but you have way less opportunity for mistakes. If you use the tick eating green ball method at verzik it will probably be doable still (just start running under xarpus earlier) but it's definitely a significant amount harder now with even less room for mistakes.
---
I mean honestly it would only save like 30 minutes, but it makes construction cheaper so
---
Thanks you!
---
For mage I just took off justiciar and prayflick a bit till I was full hp again.
---
I'm not 100% sure but I don't think tbow would have made that big of a difference to be honest.
---
It wasn't like I had a big cash stack in my bank, I had to make the money on my wyvern alt at the same time the money came in as fast as it went. So I couldn't afford a tbow anyway. 
---
I did calculate a bit before I did the inferno and I'd would wave taken me 3 months of my best moneymaker with the wyvern alt running to get a tbow. And I didn't want to do that
---
I didnt even realize flicking was required. Have the mods openly said that it's a required tool/skill needed for completion?
---
if youre looking for a bounty hunter account you kind of need to think about how youre building your account in order  to compete, for instance if youre in the low 60s bracket with 43-52prayer youre going to get curb stomped. if youre not a bounty hunter pvp account and are looking to pvp world/deep wildy pk getting into the average flow of pvp isnt hard. there are some advanced mechanics like tick dancing and nh bridding that might take a while to get used to but other than that the only thing youll have to worry about is the option for higher levels being able to attack you.
---
ty my dude.

Last week there were four level 126s at the ge with the same range gear and 99 hp cape, everyone was like wtf.

Yeah sexual or not still weird af I agree

---
Ah so you subscribe to the time-based payment method lol, fair enough. In any case, your overall satisfaction with the game is all that matters. Clearly you overall don't care enough about this particular issue that it invalidates your entire game experience, so it is good enough.
---
played ~1584 out of ~5500 potential hours since september 15, 2018.
---
Nah that’s the best one!
---
??? wtf you on about?  Imagine inferring meaning from words?
---
You called all the potheads that play this game "shit head no-lives", and now seem to be saying I'm jumping to conclusions by saying you think you're better than those people?
---
Please tell me what I'm missing here.
---
The inferno doesn't "need" it.
---
Its very helpful to save supplies and bring in more brews instead of restores, but its been proven multiple times that you could do the inferno by lazy flicking or not even flicking at all.
---
0 friends to tell.
---
Maybe because the person that brought it up was hostile and attention seeking. Not sure why anyone gave it a response in the first place tbh, just downvote and move on. That troll is so we'll fed they probably weigh more than a barrel of naptha at this point
---
It's a joke...
---
What do you mean?
---
99 slayer and haven’t attempted Cerberus and died twice at hydra and gave up
---
I’d watch plenty of guides before doing it and have BIS gear
---
I can buy and sell back a fighter torso? Fuck if only I'd known
---
I don't really think it'd be any easier to do it one way or the other, they just decided the first tick shouldn't cause prayer drain.
---
The source is just from playing, it's not hard to discover prayer flicking without looking anything up, it's pretty intuitive. The non intuitive part is that it drains no prayer whatsoever instead of just for the ticks prayer is active. You can tell prayer stores numbers between integers because you can turn a prayer on and off for two ticks (rather than one, aka an imperfect prayer flick) and it will only sometimes drain prayer.
---
tbh there's a point at which you should just be buying a tablet if you want a bigger screen.
---
I admit the Minigame Shop isn't exactly a single, big ticket reward, but you don't think it fills the role? I intend them to be released together.
---
Hello sir please tell me how you are going to attack Nechryaels with level 1 slayer
---
I did and do. Shits hard
---
Because you're basing success only on player count.
---
99 rc and agility right off the bat
---
I will give you 100m if you can break the mining 6h record since its easy
---
&gt;Removing 1-tick flicking needs to happen, it trivializes any sort of challenge that comes with what is currently known as lazy flicking. 
---
So...you're telling me you think lazy flicking is skill based and 1 tick flicking isn't? That's a hot take I've never seen lmao
---
Ring of Nature doesn’t help

ok ill grind rc thanks :)

You can't just say that it doesn't suck to suck at a video game... If you suck, you most likely don't enjoy it, especially when you don't have time to get good at it, and if you aren't enjoying it, I'd say you really should care about it and do something, for example, find a game that you can find enjoyable regardless if you're good or not. For example, runescape, like we do here, doesn't matter if we can spend an hour or 16 hours a day, we can still get things done and we enjoy it, to some extent.  
---
Either way, caring about how good YOU yourself are compared to what this cunt does is two different things.
---
I agree, honestly
---
I'm the owner of these accounts. I don't ever give people stuff in this game, nor do I pretend that some random user is a 12-year-old child that I'm adopting? I'm definitely not involved in any child abuse. And I never give people free stuff.
---
To be honest, you're likely some pervert who's been offended about something that I've said when ranting about online predators being infested within the OSRS community.
---
Just wait until you do a master that requires showing falo the bard an infernal axe (3M untradable investment) then get a 200k reward
---
Mod q p    
---
Mark W
---
And an infernal axe
---
&gt; not even flicking at all.
---
False. Although theoretically possible you will need a twisted bow and be on a slayer task. This means you have to already complete it before.
---
I know two!
---
this sub never ceases to amaze me, if you own an obby cape you are not a "noob" that's an expensive piece of equipment
---
I get what you're saying but I can have fun with games I'm shit at too.
---
I agree with some of his opinions but dislike the way he portrayed them.
---
I didnt say anything about you. I spoke about two unnamed people who I knew in 2004.
---
Just make an rsps if you want to play a static game
---
Totally lost on the reference :(
---
103, quest cape, fire cape, b gloves, most hard diaries done, still haven't done a single round of barbarian assault and still don't have full graceful.
---
idk about that one the King Black Dragon comes over every friday night haha! Only time I get to play RS. He is my wife's boyfriend after all.
---
Imagine feeling superior for having better stats in a 15 year old game. See? Can easily flip the argument around. You are still a sad person.
---
Why split the player base even more?
---
Found the noob
---
Yeah but I’ll have to reset my health often won’t I?
---
&gt;¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don't have the knowledge on how to do that and I'm pretty sure Jagex would be against it
---
I do have a magic long bow, would I be able to use that with Rune arrows or should I just get the C bow
---
Those are the crescent shaped arrows that when shot at a chicken will decapitate it
---
&gt; It feels like the problem is that protection prayers are too good.
---
Imo this is the actual problem. At 43 prayer you're basically immune to all common mobs and some bosses. That's just way too OP combined with prayer flicking. There's a reason ppots and super restores and like 4x the price of sara brews. 
---
RS3 nerfed overheads, so that even you flick prayers, you still take damage. And I think eventually, there needs to be a nerf in OSRS as well. For example, cut overhead prayers to 50%, and add another mechanic that increases it's effectiveness. Perhaps for each level over the required level, increase by 1%, so you get full protection at 87/90/93.. idk just a brainstorm idea.
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with allowing tick manipulation to reward players. If they want to put in the extra effort, they should be rewarded (like in skilling). But to begin balancing content that makes tick manipulation mandatory is not a direction I want to see them go.
---
Watching people get annihilated by angry chicken because they have negative magic defense was the only reason I cut willows in draynor.
---
How so, do you mind elaborating?
---
... If I approached you on the street, saying that if you gave me money, I would double it and give it back. It’s really legit man! 
---
Would you give me a couple of grand?
---
I have 94. Doesn't really matter if I pk long enough it will rise
---
not in world 420 lol
---
Literally me, debating whether I should get the bigger iPhone just for osrs
---
Lol replace that with Zulrah for me. 90 Magic, 80 Defense, and I plank like a bitch.
---
i bet you fall for the nigerian prince scams too
---
&gt; None of the people who complained about zmi on twitter constantly were irons. Also the zmi change did nothing to normie account xp rates, people just hopped to lavas.
---
I haven't followed the ZMI thing, but of course the people who complained were normal accounts.  It was a blatant attempt at pushing IM and normal XP rates closer together.
---
And as someone who has made over 100k lavas, paying for ZMI runners for a decent increase in XP would be amazing.
---
Because there are very few bosses in game that require all 3 combat styles to fight, if you were leaning towards that.
---
rip darkscape
---
That was your comment...
---
The last 15 of my inferno attempts all ended at healers, do you know how lucky you have to be to get there 15 times in a row.
---
And yeah I did wait for sgs specs, but waiting for sgs specs was totally unnecessary in the end. Look at how many sanfews I have left lol, I also still had 2 dally shield actives left in the end.
---
I get where you're coming from but know that I learned how to get to zuk without using more than one or two brew sips because I always thought I needed them all in the zuk fight I was wrong I guess.
---
So a plugin could potentially emulate multiple tabs open at once?

Final stretch of 250 vork kills since selling. Going for 1k. Also fishing for that sweet Mory elite diary.
---
Says 40 on the tracker. Don't know how accurate it is. I've never used OSBuddy or Runelite.
---
Wasn't that literally the entire point of the content though...
---
Yeah. I still maintain that even a below average PvMer could learn Zuk in 10 attempts. He's not that hard of a boss. Like regular Jad, the difficulty comes from the built up nerves associated with "risking" 2-3+ hours on the previous waves beforehand.
---
Thanks! I’ve seen comments recommending a shield, so I could pray mage and use either my d square, skirt, or chain body
---
Should I keep the abyssal dagger p++ for str training or should I sell it and use a Sara sword?
---
I'm happy to tell you that I did get to zuk multiple times without justiciar. In the end I just stitched to get to zuk constantly.
---
I feel that -- dc'd in the middle of 62 yesterday but somehow survived. lost the 2 brews on the floor tho
---
&gt; how it was originally intended
---
Your comment
---
You can do close to 20 mins afk in nmz. Use supercombats instead of ovlds and max gear instead of dh. Also set it to normal instead of hard

Most first capes are way under 3 hrs, this dude just used time as a resource (sgs, blood barrage) instead of dealing with the waves in an optimal way

Are you looking to buy the account itself? or just the name? Isn't the name still unavailable for a while even after the original person changes their name?
---
i'm not sure thats true
---
Ass oppossed to taking maybe 5 combat potions of any kind? OVLs would allow you to save 1-2 inv spaces, in most circumstances, if you're an average PVMer doing normal bossing (like GWD).
---
Ah I see. So it’s Jad that really requires the diamond bolts. I’ll see what my inventory looks like since no bolt pouch, but I feel like 1000 addy bolts and a few hundred diamond bolts should be good.
---
Don’t restrict your account, so simple
---
That's assuming you're getting scythe splits which make up half that profit. Then there's me and my friend, who are 600+ and 1000+ kc, and neither of us has seen a scythe (despite suspected drop rate being 1/200 raids last time I saw one of those spreadsheets made by obliv forever ago) combined with bad rng in general with purple chests, putting us way below the expected profit rate.
---
It's still better money than anything else, but it sucks knowing so many people who got a scythe in their first 50 kc, some even in their own name, and even worse all the people who got multiple scythe splits back when they were worth like 3b while we were going dry or getting justiciar lol.
---
I only used the abyss for the initial trip there through the rift and didn't bother afterwards because I didn't want to risk the bloods or souls I was carrying. While souls aren't worth much, I preferred the marginal XP decrease over risking being pked for them. You could always banks the souls I guess, but I don't know much XP loss it is to do that compared to just racing back to the abyss without banking.
---
I don't really like disintegrate; it doesn't sound very magical and also it's more of a passive word than an active one (things disintegrate by themselves, you don't often go and disintegrate things). I agree that the mid level one should be shatter, but how about "immolate undead" for the strongest one? It kind of mirrors a respectful "cremation" but with more violence and hatred for the undead. Plus it can ask for Earth and fire runes instead.
---
Idk what you mean push rates closer, as i said lavas are just as fast. Its day 1 and people are saying expected max rates will be 170 and 210k.
---
Rates arent changing.
---
Hmm, well I did have 2 dally shield actives left and  multiple sanfew brews.
---
I did record how long it takes to recharge prayer back to full. It takes about 45 minutes. You do the math
---
Oh and don't call me friend, that's weird haha

As a mid level player, autumn elegy's guide on efficient maxing is one of the best guides done for osrs

Considering a majority of the updates are voted via polls meaning if it's not 75% voted on it isn't released.

The only content that is released is content that is wanted by the player base.
---
nice cape
---
Please keep it in the clan chat tab, it makes sense, as far as I’m concerned the point of this is to create a universal game time for events with primarily - clan members.
---
Don’t know where else would be better or make more sense. I don’t see a need for it on our main hud. You look at your wrist to check your watch you don’t walk around all day with it in front of your face. Same idea here.
---
You're saying 170-210k doing lava running?

Dhide is going to be better than void. Only take void if you are using it for both to minimize switches

He asked me a question so I answered. Should I have ignored him next time??

OP isnt very knowledgeable. Arcane is almost no dps increase (unless using justiciar, which is a crutch that will hurt more than help in the long run). Dfs is a massive no-no, bring an ely if you got extra gp but crystal shield is easily enough, and that ely money can go a long way towards something more useful. Tbow helps for zuk and triple jads, but acb zuk isnt impossible at all
---
Yeah.  That actual punishing mechanics of it are fine IMO, but shouldn't be based on saving prayer like this
---
i second this, MAKE CASTLEWARS GREAT AGAIN
---
Not sure about the glory method but I use Construction cape to house so I don't bank and I can complete a little over 8 complete runs an hour vs 7.5 running to altar.
---
ovls allow you to brew without having to pot, allowing you to bring all brews, overload and 1 pray pot with prayflicking
---
Congrats! I'm just starting my grind now, I've put in around 5 attempts and gotten to wave 31 or so. I feel like something is about to click with safespotting the hectic waves, but it's not quite there yet. Then I just gotta do all of it again, but with a mager...
---
Did you manually keep track of every attempt or is there a simpler way to see it in runelite / in-game?
---
I don’t think so. I know blowpipe has gotten two but u think that was because he had one in his inventory during the raid. He also didn’t have olmlet yet
---
That scam exists since runescape exists.
---
You're a sheep because you want better gear? Allright my dude
---
Gear: Fury(anguish if u can afford), Blowpipe with 2k addy darts, verac helm, blessed dhide chest, verac skirt, blessed dhide boots, ammo slot blessing, archers ring imbued, avas device.
---
Inventory should be 2 bastion or ranged pots, 100 dragon darts for Jad which you will load into the bp on the double mage wave (62) just before you finish off the yellow mage after getting it low with addy darts first, 6-8 brews, rest is super restores. You can also take a few black chins/rcb/crystal bow to aggro healers.
---
3 doses of brew per 1 super restore dose, and keep 1 action between prayer switches only. Call out your action before doing it irl to make it easier to focus (i.e. say “brew” then take brew, then say “mage” then pray mage, then say “healer”, and aggro healer, etc.). 
---
Jad spawns right where the yellow mage spawns on wave 62 so kill that last and start with your range prayer on with your mouse hovering over mage pray.
---
Where the small fatboy spawns on wave 3 is also exactly where Jad and the yellow mage spawn, so pay attention wave 3 so you have an idea where Jad will be later on
---
Always pray range, because that animation is way faster, and hover the mage prayer. Everytime you pray mage, switch back to ranged right away. 
---
For the healers, just aggro one per prayer switch, and either tank them or have autoretaliate on and let your character finish them while you focus on praying against Jad. You can use black chins to aggro them but that’s kinda gimmicky and idk if it works perfectly all the time. Might cause panic if it doesn’t get them all. Alternatively you can also bring a longer ranged weapon than bp like a crystal bow or rcb to make aggroing the healers much easier.
---
It’s okay if you mess up the first few times. Silven has a really good easy to follow guide for all the waves before Jad so check that out on youtube. Good luck!
---
You don't think it's hard to stay motivated after so many attempts okay :(
---
o u right
---
I have the name Tracy, how much are you offering?
---
no
---
I'll give it back to you. How much did you lose?
---
Just send me your login credentials in a pm ;)
---
With my high combat level I would rarely ever get pked so I even ran out there with a rune pouch full of runes for Geomancy. Yeah lot of risk involved but there's so few pkers with the level to touch me that   
---
But yeah I think the bank reduces some xp rate, so I might just skip the abyss from now on.
---
Or just runecraft
---
Sanfews restore one prayer point more, that's the only reason
---
Depending on your levels, you can do skilling for gp. What's you ign? I can loan you 100k so you can get back on your feet. 100k should be enough to at least get you some rune armour + some tools like pick and axe.
---
Imbued MSB is fine for barrows, the special is useful too.
---
Theoretical max rates. Someone posted a 200.2k hour recently and thats with the runner setup not necessarily 100% optimized yet. Said he thought could push 205-210 if everythings flawless
---
Expensive is a stretch. My bank is only 50m, I find bandos expensive, dragon hunter crossbow really fucking expensive and twisted bow ridiculous.
---
You have ways to make 1m gp/hr after you put in 50 hours in the game.
---
Whatever floats your boat, I did it without. But I'm not blaming you if you want to do it with tbow.
---
He is there. Look again
---
Imagine thinking I said something
---
Just so happened it happened to be during the NPC walk period. PS. Click quicker, you should be getting 3 picks per knockout. &lt;3
---
These assholes going to get custom clients banned.
---
This. It takes maybe 3 hours tops to get the Chompies required for WP-Hard, but Zulrah is HELL
---
Farming is such a pain in the ass on mobile. I have to search for all my equipment and items, then organize my inventory.  I would only mine, fish, or wc on mobile.
---
Shh, bb.
---
True, I was also thinking the brutals would still punch through the body. So you still have the entry like a regular arrow, but shredded chicken instead of regular. Much less precise, ripping open organs. But if it doesn't that isn't an issue
---
Saying it out loud
---
LOL! if you cant play without a 3rd party client you should not be playing osrs in the first place
---
Ya man thought me not to trust people. Still tried to trust people irl they fucked me just as hard a child manipulating scammer.
---
Oh hey it me

Just bring your seercull and knock it down a few levels

You have me beat, I got mine at 37 thieving rip.

Can't wait

That addiction is a real problem.
---
Dude I'm a casual player and have a 350m bank, if you've been playing since it came out it's not that hard to achieve with some luck
---
BCP is 13m
---
How dare you call us goblin fuckers a meme.

What makes it better? The fact that it takes absolutely 0 skill or effort?

Oh man. With out clickable links it would be rough....a ton of stars on each page with index’s on the bottom?

Softly? You're playing it wrong

Looks like Runescape remade in Habbo Hotel
---
Do they have random fucked up names?  RWT.
---
Are they matching names at all? Probably a guy with a bunch of alts.
---
Without an sgs either, so he used less than 99 prayer points to beat the inferno
---
Hey nice work on the cape, serious dedication.
---
haha yes! I totally remember the same thing happening to me re: bronze
---
Do you remember a specific example of goal setting/persistence that stands out?
---
Ahh ok.

3 picks? never knew thats possible. Ill try it out but either way it seems like if I actually try to go slower at first, and avoid this shit, then for I can go fast without problems forever

If you aren’t using guthans, you have to use food to heal or prayer. So it’s not as afk.

Have you become addicted to other things? I feel you on that—RS made me aware that I have an addictive personality.

All results are viewable after you participate. Please do, I think this will be interesting!

Note taken thanks for the info

Helpful for knowing when things like dailies or farming rotations reset/progress
---
Speaking of which. Is there a nice clan I can join for a level 100 noob?
---
How to hide the fact that you spend most of your free time on a game that would get you your ass kicked lol
---
I shall start the quest grind
---
Ya missed the joke
---
I’ll agree to disagree, I think that castlewars could fill a gap in boring training through low/mid level grinding and motivate people to want to get that gear outside of cwars. Hardcore fans can stay around for fun.
---
I got 85 mage on a new account by splashing from 77, took 59 hours of clicking once every 2 minutes - there’s a period in time between mid level and high level I just think could be more fun.
---
I would still love to see cwars become a key part of runescape fun again. That shit was great, though I did reside myself to barricading and bandaging while I was 50cb and realised I couldn’t fight people in there with their gear and levels.
---
why does that matter? it is the most efficient for xp but rooftops are less annoying and also more gp/hr. shouldnt there be tradeoffs? no matter what there will always be a most effecient method....
---
What would be the point then of having yew bows in F2P if it's the same stats as the current maple? For aesthetic purposes?
---
Pre-GE taught me how to type obscenely fast. Also, attention to detail when buying verac’s sets and dragon bones (rip my 10 year old innocence).
---
I'd be okay with it but they'd have to add something that unlocks the boosts for the gear because you get the outfit in like 10 seconds. Maybe like a carpentry school styled minigame similar to the mage training arena but for building stuff, I dunno but I definitely do not want it to give a boost without some work behind it.
---
you dont need indica if you prepare your bong with a pearl napkin this video explains it all:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

Oh damn was it?

Blast mining is even worse
---
Yes, for aesthetic purposes.
---
my visafe
---
Why are you the way that you are
---
Lmao didn't expect to see this today
---
How often do you read the official forums and Twitter, though? This subreddit isn't the only place the game is talked about that jagex pays attention to.
---
Seems pointless to implement in this way.
---
Hmu if you find one. I'm a lvl 100 noob too!
---
Speaking of music panel changes, I’d love there to be an option to mute select songs, or have different ones play if the select song is meant to be played. 
---
I don’t mind any of the music really *except* the one that plays around Tithe farm. Idk why but it irrationally pisses me off and drives me crazy to no end, as if Jagex found the MIDI holy grail of a “bird is the word” level trigger. I have to mute the music **immediately** when it starts up. Can’t really explain it, but seriously fuck that song in particular.
---
Wildy items have plummeted and continue to drop. jagex needs to do something to stabilize their price. like making it so they can be de graded into ether.
---
theyre already basically planning to do this with warding. but WARDING BAD
---
Yes that’s a huge part of it. That’s not the type of flicking people are complaining about though
---
Why not just congratulate the man on his huge accomplishment?
---
Oh ya those prison guard guys
---
Really more xenophobic than racist.
---
I got full obsidian from tzhaars right before the collection log came out. rip.
---
I have no idea how it failed, absolutely ridiculous
---
Then it doesn't matter. Pretend like it's already been removed. No difference to you.
---
The fuck. Meanwhile I'm at 2k kc with 6 pegasians and 2 prims
---
Yea, I saw classix's stream and they seemed to take normal acid damage in 5-man, but then I saw puggin's duo and him and lake just got insta-comboed out by acid. Seems like some weird scaling going on.
---
Where is BOB?
---
Ya know, this made me realize something about polls.  People will calculate time spent getting the outfit to time saved grinding to 99 or whatever and decide based on that whether it should come into the game.  There’s never going to be options to do things differently if it doesn’t reward well, meta or nothing.
---
Kingdom logs mayne I ain't about to chop mahogany logs.
---
&gt;They're obviously able to tell the difference between someone using a bot and someone using Runelite or OSBuddy for instance.
---
Im wondering how you come to this obvious conclusion, when spinning that thought further there shouldnt be any bots with more than maybe an hour of playtime if they could detect what kind of 3rd party program you are using.
---
Best of luck! I hope you can get it sorted out!
---
I think you are underestimating the money making power of micro transactions

you can't, they're gone.

Those ones can stay with rs2 though! Nothing worse than going to the bathroom and cooking back with no axe head and the other person wcing with you doesn't want to give it back.  The aggressive randoms would purely be for comedy nowadays with the 1 hour timer for picking up your inventory. I'd be interested in seeing them again

If I have jad as a slayer task does the slayer helm effect work against everything in the fight caves or just jad?

It's not allowed. OP is a bundle of sticks. Jagex has already taken a stance and banned pkers using it.
---
Noice
---
I just killed Zulrah, all 4 of my attempts have been made today. After grinding PC for 1650 points for gloves, top, bottom, all helms, and 400 points for the elite upgrade I was so happy since a Zulrah kill seemed like the biggest hurdle between me and elite void. After the kill I look up a western diary guide. 300 chompy birds. Check my bow: 126 kills! You're a marksman!
---
At kill 170 now...
---
this idea is great
---
Fire making cape it is then
---
Do you know what a panhandler is? It’s someone who begs for money. Given unlimited time you can become a billionaire begging for money, but that’s obviously unrealistic because you don’t have unlimited time.
---
OSRS is a video game and the time you spend playing it competes with the time spent doing other things in your life - work, school, social life, etc. The argument “given enough time you can max” forgets that time is a resource that you also have to manage.
---
Also you still haven’t shared your RSN. Probably because you’re shit.
---
you can't say that man
---
Dear idiot, please learn how to take a fucking screenshot.

T H I C C

Thanks for the response! Trying to get that halo

yea learning to do that mechanic is much more difficult for me than 1t flick
---
Because bots are being banned constantly and 10s of thousands of people use Runelite and OSBuddy w/o punishment? I never said all bots are the same, I just said they could differentiate between Runelite/OSBuddy and your run of the mill bot.
---
No, because that is in no way 1:1 if one button would move your mouse to an item and click it.
---
Wiki says jugs of wine can't go bad after lvl 68. Does cooking gauntlets decrease this?
---
Oh I see, there's another teleport icon at the start that isn't labeled.
---
Yeah maybe make some new unique gear from randoms? And if the bots lost their broken gear at least it could pump some more money back in the game
---
Or just make chaos gauntlets from the Family Crest effective with the crumble undead spell.. let's not change the game too much more than it already has changed.. my opinion at least**
---
What I’m saying bruh, I got my nut off to this poor lad in the ge
---
If you need a bot for something like this to be enjoyable, you know that the content is garbage and should be rebalanced...  
---
Instead of banning, maybe they should think about entire playerbase and not the gods themselves who have gamer chair and can 1 tick pray indefinitely and perfectly against 3 of these, whatever they are...
---
oh god
---
Literally no source
---
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica
---
??? Where did you even come up with the idea that multi logging is not allowed? There are very limited and specific situations where it is not allowed, and these are not them.
---
99
---
Devalues my Earthbound Only Ironman.
---
knew what it was before even clicking. And i was not dissapointed
---
&gt;If done correctly you should drop zero points
---
If you're perfect then it's over powered. 
---
We should remove bhops from csgo because it's overpowered if done perfectly. 
---
We should nerf x unit in starcraft because if perfectly micro'd it's unstoppable.
---
You dont balance around unobtainable perfect play
---
Never reset the streak. Every 10th task get a task from the slayer master that gives you the most points (most likely Konar--wildy slayer doesn't work) to get the bonus. For example, do tasks 1-9 with Nieve, then every 10th with Konar or Duradel.
---
That being said, consider just doing wilderness slayer if points are you biggest concern atm.
---
F,
---
This happened to my rune pick, and those were a fortune to younger me. Had to grind forever to get a new one. Pre Grand Exchange, so you had that market out of west varrock bank spamming flash2:scroll: buying rune pick lmao. Good times
---
Try it yourself before coming to that conclusion. 
---
You won't be able to do it. It takes skill and rythm and reaction time in order to do, and the noobs get salty over the idea that they'd need to put in effort and skill that they don't have in order to do marginally better.
---
The game has moved to more afk over time, and the noobs want everything to be optimal when afk, because they don't like the idea of missing out by not paying attention.
---
You know 50m hasn’t been considered rich since like 2008 or 2014 in old school
---
Banana, my bwana.
---
Venom and third party clients. Runelite makes Jad's tells so trivial.
---
Oh I mean I'm not saying that anything should be balanced around this. I'm just saying the reason he drops prayer points while flicking is because he makes a few mistakes. If you are playing perfectly you won't drop any. But it's very hard to maintain concentration for that long perfectly without one or two mistakes.
---
Flicking 150 Kurasks or something is quick. Flicking several waves of the Inferno is not (and also requires more effort). They're not at all comparable haha. I'm not Woox or anywhere close to that level of gameplay. But I do like to flick on Slayer and I can usually maintain it since tasks take about an hour with a super set.
---
yeah but binding each action to a single button you can just hit 123456 and instantly swap and still be following the 1 to 1 rule, shits still broken
---
If you can call temple trekking a grind lol
---
because moving the mouse and clicking the mouse are two separate actions, 6 letters for 6 switches would be a 2:1 ahk if I correctly understand how they've enforced the rules before. 12 characters would work but not sure how much time that would save anyway
---
Jim Carrey is playing the doc in sonic so his movies are being plastered all over the streaming services to drum up nostalgia/interest in him.
---
There's nothing stopping you from writing a trivial program that takes your input and clicks however many more times you want in offset spots on your screen (or, in best case, sends clicks directly to client without using physical mouse, then it's even easier) though.
---
The question is, how legit it is and how likely it is to get you banned, considering that you control one account and technically, a 3rd party program, controls the rest, which, in this case, might be seen as macroing, which, not gonna lie, it kind of is, if you make 10 accounts and get x10 of something with a single click it's kind of dumb.
---
TIL
---
thats exactly what zmi running was.
---
It’d be the same as Fire Surge though because the biggest boost to fire surge is the 50% extra dmg from tome of fire which wouldn’t exist for crumble undead.
---
This is funny cause that will be me
---
Just don’t watch them all at once? They’re not a tv network or something.
---
Sure u can
---
This is the true innovation OSRS needs
---
It’s more there for irony, no one really cares about it
---
True but wave is higher than blast for some reason.
---
That's  a good time, but you can probably get more exp from ammonite crabs.
---
Google a guide to see what quests the 0 def bosses are from.
---
Most people use 5 or more of: King Roald, Me, Count Draynor, Tree Spirit, Black Demon, Bouncer and Khazard Warlord.
---
Don't troll in this subreddit please
---
What about "turn undead". Isn't that a typical spell in most MMOs anyway
---
Haters and losers will say it's fake
---
Yeah if you don't like overloads
---
*“You would desecrate Bob's grave? You monster!"*
---
Hmm...you must be doing something differently then. I have 22m+ slayer xp and i have never had that problem. Extended abyssal demons are the only task where ensouled heads might overflow your invy.
---
Would be really weird to remove a spell from the normal spellbook thats been there since the beginning. If anything just a new version should be added to Arceuus book, not removed from normals. Plus that’d suck for F2P players.
---

---
dude ive been looking for this forever!! thank you so much.
---
Yea, mostly abby demons and fire giants, but also trolls, dagannoth (when not doing DKS) and cave horrors.
---
It's too tempting my man? I didn't say they were a TV network or something.
---
I only provided some examples but the fact that the game has a massive market with supplies, resources, and equipment farmed by players that traded to back and forth between players is enough to make it a MMO. Back in the day the sole purpose of the game revolved around mainly pking and dominance of clans. Pking was fueled by skilling and farming of resources.
---
Stop trying to justify your silly game mode because you are DIY. Sure, you can do most of the content and farm all the gear and supplies yourself if you please. But It’s inefficient and useless.

That's not 1-1

Im unsure if it does ferment, but it might not.

*It's entirely possible*, though I'm new to the community and wouldn't know. Should they at least briefly acknowledge the top questions though? "We've answered this before and our answer was..." or "We're thinking on it and may have more information in the future".
---
I bought wizard boots
---
Black demon bouncer and warlord have high defence I think
---
The wiki says it will take around 25 hours, so you would autolog at least 3 times before hitting 99
---
It’s unpopular because it makes zero sense
---
I never claimed that zmi running should have been banned, just that tick manipulation skilling should be.
---
Much much harder

If you want to feel rewarded then personally feel rewarded for soing it the "hard" way and be content with that without needing to see that "nice, gz" in chat.
---
Osrs is borderline a single player game with the only player interaction being people crashing you during slayer and raids. Play for your own enjoyment and play the way you want to without feeling the need to compare the time you spent playing against someone elses time spent playing this game.
---
I agree that this non-intended xp rate is a bad thing but fuck, how do you manage to put in so much energy in comparing yourself to everyone else and why does the validation of others matter to such a degree?
---
Straight fire
---
Contractor work is a good way to make over $20/hr. Got a friend who can make over $35/hr doing it.
---
I detail and maintain aircraft every few days a week and depending on the plane size/job type I can make anywhere ranging from $15/hr minimum to $45 or even $50/hr. Even more once I start working on aircraft upholstery. $20/hr isn't very difficult to come by if you look in the right places.
---
Bullshit
---
Fire surge still does more dmg than these iirc
---
He’s playing OSRS that’s already fucking up his score for sure
---
Even when not on task for slayer helm?
---
Lol imagine equating inferno to firemaking
---
You have no clue what you're on about and are just mad that you can't do it too. Not every player should be able to get everything with ease...
---
Whats you mum doing coming home at 3am drunk?
---
I'm just saying it isnt as easy as "infinite prayer points". If you have to go to perfect play to say something is imbalanced then it's fine since it'll rarely make a difference. Even though you can do the inferno with no supplies you don't see people doing that unless it's just to flex. No supplies inferno doesn't hurt the game. 
---
Hell, if flicking hurts the ppot economy then we'd have to get rid of clan wars, alters, and +prayer gear, bones-&gt;prayer in the catacombs, the bonecrusher, and the dragonbone necklace.
---
Isn't that what's shown in the picture?...
---
Im not gonna get into a semantic argument. Lets just agree to disagree on exact terminology.
---
Close enough

The worst bit is getting 75 thieving imo, the chompy kills went by fast

If I see someone run a marathon by hopping on one leg, I'll ask them "why" and if they reply "because it's better this way" I would react the exact same way
---
Im trying to get to 50 and its still a huge pain :(
---
Slayer helm, ancestral, externals, slayer bracelet if on task or tormented if not, MA2 cape, occult, kodai
---
That was assuming around 25 minute total time trios, I've done more efficient 4-mans than I have 3-mans so that was my best guess based on the 3-mans I've done, and I erred on the side of using a slower 3-man time if anything, but with xarpus being so much faster with today's update, it's gonna change the point where duos become better by a decent amount.
---
Easy way to calculate it though, whatever the new average time for extremely efficient teams is do: (60/time) * split. Where time is the time of raid in minutes, and split is the fraction of a purple that goes to you. So 0.5 in duo, or (1/3) in trio. This basically gives you how many splits/h you earn (well assuming every raid had a purple, if you divide by the drop rate you could get the actual splits/h, but we don't know the confirmed drop rate yet, but all that matters is that we have a quantitive way to compare trio and duo). With this you can see which one is better at what point.
---
"and it is easy"
---
Bet this kid doesn't even have firecape
---
Op is right, fuck y'all. I've even heard a streamer say "why would you want afk over pray flicking." Saying that pray flicking is some sort of skill and that it was completely unbearable to not have pray flicking because the game would now be afk. At least in rs3 they've managed to make the game work while not having prayer protect 100 percent.
---
You mean monthly nsfw zuhaar art?
---
The point is to train both, not to train both and have it be better than individual methods.  There's supposed to be a compromise in less exp gained in favor of training two skills at once.
---
Not sure, came back a month ago after being gone for year and half and runelite had a anti-drag script on it. Why jagex allows that I have no idea
---
Piety pure or Zerker have the most flexibility in terms of being able to do both PvM and PvP.
---
I swear to god every time I almost have the fish it jumps too far away and I lose it immediately
---
No problem, glad I could. Good luck with the rest of the quest!
---
It's a consistent pace, so very possible over lag
---
As long as your ping isn't super unstable you should be able to click delayed and then continue from there with the regular .6 second pace
---
I think that doing it with stable prices I would have profited without getting a cape of skulls but unfortunately including the 332 beginner clues I got with the 500 easys from young implings I had a net loss of around 10m. Keep in mind the implings dropped a total of over 15m while I was collecting every clue scroll so I definitely think you'd likely always profit with stable prices!
---
Has to be 1::1 mouse movement makes this not 1::1
---
You should add more banks.
---
And poll booths.
---
&gt;abdominal paid feature
---
Yea I agree the nickel-and-diming is killing my indigestion.
---
Link it up with the stam pot sink bridge and I’m sold
---
Something Jagex should've done 5 years ago.
---
This is the most accurate depiction of me between each and every slayer task and it hurts.
---
The quest cape goal is a bit shit as it takes so long to achieve. I'd work on smaller goals such as first doing all easy achievement diaries, then the medium ones etc. They have a wide range of requirements so will get you involved in lots of areas of the game
---
or wave 69
---
I like to listen to songs with the same BPM that you need to click at
---
After that I was able to do it without music
---
Wyrms are such a pain in the ass. the first time I did them, i was loving the drops and the decent bones. the second time, they were still okay. now, it's a drain on my soul to venture into that cavern. I'm just sick of their slithery appearance.  
---
I also noticed last time that for some reason, with auto-retaliate off, my first attack would stand them up, then i would just stand there while they spit lightning at me??? dunno what that was all about.
---
Bond fires! 🔥
---
Ah, lore based ideas, take my upvote sir.
---
I wear one too...alongside the combat bracelet lol
---
What are you looking for in a clan? We do a bit of everything, honestly, so all are welcome.
---
The majority of their money comes from membership which obviously OSRS provides the most, MTX revenue also includes OSRS bonds though the breakdown isn’t clear. OSRS makes more but it’s close and it has only recently passed RS3. You can see this yourself looking at the Jagex revenue breakdown.
---
It was one of the early online social games, lots of runescape players were on it. It's still around but it's a shadow of its former glory
---
peopo

[deleted]
---
like a drop from creature creation
---
You linked this /r/gaming X /r/comedycemetery crosspost to runescape in the lowest effort imaginable way
---
Right, because everyone wants to move halfway across the world for a barely over minimum wage dev job in a HCOL area. I could deliver pizzas and make more money without a degree.
---
If you want to keep eating that shit up as an excuse, go ahead, but there are plenty of ways they can share information without compromising their security. Or, you know, they could just be effective at banning, not tell us, and let us see first hand that they're actually competent.
---
Okay but does the shield+extended anti-fire potion actually work and reduce their hits to 0? I think I'd rather wear the shield than drain my prayer super quickly from praying mage. Sure the dps would be a bit lower from not wearing a ranging offhand, but I just hit 77 slayer and I'm still using a black d'hide shield there so it's not a significant drop...
---
Where's the PHR33 ST00F PL0X
---
This made me laugh so hard, gj man.
---
monkfishies
---
How do you gauge my experience from my comment? Maybe it’s based on experience
---
Specifically bought my Note 9 with this in mind (and Netflix.)
---
Nah. It's crafting xp. 
---
But also, the correct answer is do normal combat and prayer things like Slayer until your combat skills are mid 90s, *then* switch to no combat xp methods.
---
Rape undead
---
Was always going to happen
---
Imagine actually saying what you think instead of being cryptic and annoying and acting like its other people's fault if they don't understand what you're saying.
---
Take my upvote you clever person you!
---
Highly doubt they’ll drop a poll anytime soon. They’ll be releasing a new blog post with changes to the skill based off player feed back. I doubt we will see a poll for another 2-3 months tbh
---
Yeah. I had like 300kc as zerk. About 95% of the kills were on mobile. Its not big of a differece vs main when u are using blowpipe I think.
---
This is my main acc, and once I did pray for rigour, its not really different at hydra tbh.
---
Imagine how much space on his computer it would take up to record everything he does in the game
---
That’s pretty much what this is. Why not both?
---
Tinie tiny
---
Blizz doesn't just say you're not allowed to use an addon anymore though. They go out of their way to break it so you can't use it anymore.
---
&gt; A town without even a bank, which is where most of the poll booths are located.
---
Hey would you look at that! You answered yourself. Weird that a town without a bank functions differently than all the other towns that have banks. Its almost like the Fremmy town is supposed to be an "old" town that hasn't kept up with the world. I wonder how that could be exemplified? Maybe like, if you couldn't use the stuff in the town unless they have already accepted you?
---
&gt; That and it shouldn't even be tied to lore if it's a tool for players to vote on content
---
Dude. Holy shit. **It. Is. A. Joke.** Get over it.
---
&gt;something that exists outside of the world's lore
---
The poll booths? We are literally having a conversation about how the lore ties to the poll booth. NPCs literally refer to the polls. They do not exist outside of the world's lore. I know osrs is *primarily* based around medieval lore, but we step outside of that box here and there.
---
&gt; and the other poll booths I mentioned are in stupid places lore wise that make no sense
---
What is the lore that doesn't align with poll booths being in any of the places you listed? I am curious.
---
&gt; so why make the lore exception for 1 specific booth?
---
Well you see...there is this thing called a joke...
---
things cant go worse,they are starving , they are in a dictatorship , and every day less people support maduro, this isnt going to be a BRUTAL CIVIL WAR , write this, maduro is going to be alone in some time ,he cia doenst need to enter venezuela ,venezuelans are going to end maduro dictatorship
---
Your just being a dick
---
Yes it’s dumb
---
In Albion online fishing is like this, and it's terribly exhaustive for a shit reward. If runescape was like this, I'd rather get 99 runecrafting twice and then kill myself than fish.
---
Your name matches the clue reward.
---
Real talk though, just think about what "crafting guild" entails. Like, some people are so good at setting gems on metal they need to form a whole guild over it? Really puts into perspective what a non-skill crafting is.
---
Wait you waited out the sara brew debuffs instead of just sipping a restore?
---
God gless your soul
---
Ah true that, didn't think of that.
---
But the Geneva mechanism would probably work just fine for this little cannon, it's not like the big cons of wear &amp; friction are going to be a problem with this thing running for a few minutes :P
---
Awesome!  good job
---
Did you have a mage switch? I know the nibblers have negative mage defense but I found myself splashing a ton when I tried with justicar
---
Guy who can't prayer flick whatsoever here:
---
I don't give a shit about prayer flicking, if you can do it, awesome. If not, get gud. 
---
Keep it in the game.
---
Once again you've made a mind blowingly stupid comparison. Good job. Just gonna block you now lol.
---
Wouldn't the cost of prayer potions eat into your profit more than the slight decrease in dps from using an anti-dragon shield?
---
Thank you! :)
---
I'm not good enough for that, but it's possible, it just takes some skill with a mouse. It doesn't even compare to being a super athlete who has to be genetically perfect to be at the level of Usain Bolt.
---
Who’s the hopeless creature?
---
:p
---
I literally just told the whole osrs redit community that I needed 256 attempts before I got the cape, what part of that makes you think I'm bragging about how good I am?
---
I know ancestral is better for the long run, I will 100% go for the pet once I've got a tbow. Since that's also great for the long-run. And I will use ancestral since I know how to get to zuk with ancestral.
---
You probably think of me as a guy thats just running around the inferno like a chicken without a head, but the only thing that directly makes you think that is the justiciar. Every dude doing inferno in justiciar is just a chicken without a head. 
---
But come on do you really think it's not really difficult to zuk 15 times in a row, even with justiciar? 
---
As for the many many attempts it took me. I started the inferno not knowing how to prayflick at all.
---
okay cool, thanks. 
---
I guess it's nice to have an AFK option now too.
---
Why was prayer flicking very clearly not intended in the 'original' design (ie, that the person who coded it intended for it to be possible to not lose prayer points if you time your uses)? I'd highly assume it was intentional, what edge and order you put a counter in is about as straightforward as it gets in programming video games.
---
I'm totes going to have to figure out how to add cursors.
---
Lol nice try
---
Damn
---
Lmao.
---
What about all the rats that are stuck in endless combat without a way to stop it. Those rats are in a living hell just cause you’re to lazy to train.
---
Sure it was a bit over the top but pvming at Woox' level is not something anyone can just learn. That dude is from another world.
---
&gt;I don't understand the topic at hand very well so I'm going to interject my third grade level of understanding to the conversation, even though it's extremely obvious that I have no idea what I'm talking about
---
Book of law. 
---
Pray bonus and range bonus.
---
I can’t tell you how to play. But it is recommended to not ever bother with a anti fire shield at brutal black dragons
---
It's only useful for fairy rings &amp; slayer. They are not as optimal as a 1 defense for pking and not anywhere as 'tanky' as a 20 defense pure. It's more of a compromise build for people who really enjoy slayer.
---
The first time I had sex with my boyfriend I started crying. He licked the tears off my face and that made him rock hard.
---
I remember it like it was yesterday...
---
Dorg chests were nerfed like 3 - 4 years ago, weren't they?
---
You have to realize that any game where you have to devote hundreds of hours of your life to even be relevant in the PKing scene is going to have neets like this who probably play 18 hours a day, hate their lives, and reflect any insecurity they have onto someone else
---
Do you happen to know how the plugin knows what the incoming attack is? I saw a similar post on here about demonic gorillas and just assumed the npc had a changed flag like a “stance” or something that was sent to the client. But in this situation there are multiple mobs in multi zone so attack priority/timing is also a factor.
---
Does the server send info saying what the next incoming attack is?
---
If you really want to mage other tasks, fire wave/fire surge with a tome of fire and staff of the dead.
---
The dps is a bit lower than tridents, but is double the xp and cheaper to use.
---
Battle mage or banshees
---
Jesus Christ that clip was painful to watch. What even is the point of that as opposed to just learning how to deal with a bad spawn?
---
Edit: just realized your username, your in Ascend right? You actually helped me out with a tricky wave tonight :D
---
I can show you my dungeon and maybe it will inspire you!
---
Boys fall for Abigail. Men fall for Haley.
---
Hmm. Couldn't regular people take advantage of people's good will and pretend to be Venezuelan to get free money?
---
11$ 🦀🦀🦀
---
I think it’s the worst of the one click agi places. I believe edge dungeon is the best.
---
That was my first thought too but this is funny regardless.
---
I like this one better
---
4% for 2 prayer pots per hour (less with a bone crushed) is easily worth it.
