Oh nope, I had not read them. Okay thanks!
---
---
---
Do I let them go? Fuck no, you enter the wilderness accepting all risks. If I was that hardcore I'd be slaughtered, so if I dont do it, someone else will. 
---
Read and vote. 
---
how long do table items last mate ?
---
That’s like if the bgs needed to be nerfed they decided to nerf dragon war hammer instead to even it out
---
DP? I’d be down for that. 
---
[removed]
---
Hadn't read them yet thanks.
---
This comment is just pure rage lolol
---
It's not like the ban will happen overnight. Most of the time, it's done in ban waves. What would be nice is if you got a notification if action was placed against a player you reported. League does this. 
---
Pssshh I got 99 def and Slayer at lvl 30 preeoc, using soulwars and xp lamps
---
Oh nice so I only have 7 seconds to cast 1 spell then I have to wait 3 seconds for another entangle to be able to cast again?! That’s so viable! 
---
Yea I don't know, but It is reset and I can complete it again. Kind of a cool thing to have.
---
There is not a specific sequence I thought.  They attack on different ticks but you need to listen or look at each of the 6 as they are doing their attacks to determine the prayer.  It isn't just mage mage range mage range, rinse and repeat. 
---

---
You may have meant that but wanted to clarify.
---
Well he used blood barrage along with max gear which makes it possible
---
Its not pray flicking. Anyone running camps pray mage, so its not a skill thing
---
lol no it shouldnt it has been like that forever and it almost defines low level pures. changing it because "it doesnt make sense" without acknowledging gameplay is just plain stupid.
---
and it mostly gives an offensive range bonus anyways and if you look closely your quiver is actually on the legs so maybe it DOES make sense
---
he's still using osbuddy
---
&gt; You missed my point. You were using an incorrect argument for why it should be polled.
---
Fair point, I did misread your comment.
---
&gt; I disagree, its what defines the upper bracket of skilled players.
---
It does now because content was been designed around it. The inferno almost requires you to prayer flick otherwise you'll run out of prayer before Zuk. But if it was just discovered today most people would simply see it as a bug where you don't lose prayer points.
---
&gt; That isn't an argument, its a statement.
---
And?
---
&gt; It becomes an issue when the majority of the playerbase is voting to harm parts of the game.
---
Not true. The OSRS would never allow that opportunity to arise. For things affecting small communities, they're generally only polled after getting a good consensus from that community. Thus other players can't vote on any poll that harms them. And maybe PvPers should try not being the most toxic pieces of shit possible and the rest of the community would support them. By far the worst community in OSRS.
---
Lol, trash trying to make a dollar. Yes, we will risk losing our accounts instead of buying them legit through Jagex. Idiots....
---
You too man, try to stay dry!
---
GG
---
Just gonna leave this here https://redd.it/a4chv3
---
Ffs how much free time do you all have? Like seriously? I have a full time job and fuuuuck, even on a non ironman account its going to take me like 5 years to max..
---
All that arm muscle is pushed into those sexy abs.
---
Prob bot farm
---
I remember having to get a queen kill for the kandarin hard diary and having every public team quit after just a few waves. I got tired of resetting so I bought a leech queen kill instead. Holy shit you guys are amazing! Just watching everyone communicate with numbers and getting everything done was awesome. I think the team that was formed for me got a queen kill in 10 min, not even. I'm grateful for the service you guys provide.
---
why you liein
---
100% will be in my hoarding only Ironman YouTube series.
---
uhhhhh you seem confused
---
Peak ddosser. 
---
Doesn't he have to understand how combat works to know that how pures work?
---
He's not saying a lot of the shit you're accusing him of, he's just saying combat level should reflect effectiveness. The level up system is extremely flawed and pures are just accounts taking advantage of the flaws and pushing them to the max
---
Just to clarify, he voted 'NO' not 'should serp helm get buffed'. He did not vote 'NO' to 'are these quality of life changes?' But he submitted his answer as if he actually had voted 'NO' to 'are these quality of life changes'. Hopefully I laid that out for you clearly enough so you can wrap your brain around how that's retarded.
---
You can deal 500 damage to zulrah, a high level boss monster, in about 1 minute with solid gear.
---
Now tell me you could do that on another player who isn't a pure. 
---
I have so many questions. 
---
losing accounts? Would pay 15$ instead of paying like 3-4 mills? Nice logic, good luck with that
---
I bet mommy gets you everything you want
---
I don't even know where to begin 
---
They are artificially adding large amounts of wealth to the economy 
---
That's bad.  Imagine if we just printed out a shit ton of money and gave it to everyone
---
Absolutely 
---
You're a fucking neanderthal. If mobile gets a massive qol buff, turns out to be a good thing, you're going to sit on your ass and quote this one line for the rest of your fucking pathetic life?
---
"I just want money."
---
Dude you got two coin drops.
---
If Dps was high against players then you would be eating A LOT more. Fights would go super fast because a lot more KO opportunities would occur or people would run out of food. 
---
Sounds neat.
---
Shut up! We aren't you even speak of that sword!
---
Honestly, the most relevant use case is when you're using ruby bolts and you take like 10 damage from the proc while vorkath takes none.
---
That poor Pewdiepie.
---
Update its not big deal if it passes otherwise REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE voting no on every pvm poll btw. 
---
6.6 mill in almost 180 kills idk if that’s pretty successful 
---
Lmao, what?
---
"Standard is shit, tangle spells need a buff."
---
"Here's a great idea, let's buff ancients and that will solve the issue."
---
looks nice i would raise my children here
---
True, no ramp for you to cross the wildy ditch.
---
Make it hard enough so that I can't afford to? Like what kind of complaint is that lmao.
---
Depends on the level of course, but it's not always the best dps.
---
To counter this, I voted yes because I would hope god d'hide would rise in price and make clues a little more rewarding.
---
Wow not one but two rusty swords!!!
---
in addition to what u/zyean said, reg magics requires minimum 7 runes while ancients requires 3, and if you use kodai then you can even bring soul runes to blood barrage. 
---
it's just a losing battle vs someone of the same skill every time minus a lot of RNG luck. Having to land freezes and hits separately really is a major tank in DPS. also if you ever have the opponents on the ropes, you have to sacrifice tangling them to deal dps and risk them running away whereas barrage u just barrage. 
---
Salty over a joke on Reddit? Guess I shouldn't expect much from the PvP community.
---
I don't know why but that almost made me cry. gg feels grats on the cape.
---
Oh oops. I included the magic thing. Ignore that. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As a pker i am amazed at the complete lack of knowledge about the usage of spells in pvp on this thread. Ill make a few things clear.
---
1. Ancients always wins over normals. Always. This update wont change that.
---
2. Fire surge is trash. So is entangle. And they will remain trash even with these updates, but they will be slightly less trash.
---
3. Magic is already at a point where its barely worth using in a deathmatch, because of the way mage defence works in osrs and updates like augury (which actually made barrage more inaccurate rather than more accurate!). Halve freeze time of ancient spells and magic will be irrelevant.
---
4. The variety of normal spellbook does not mean that "highly skilled pkers" can use it to their advantage. There is only one useful spell on normals in pvp and that is teleblock. The rest are utterly useless.
---
5. This update is already a thing in DMM, and it did wonders to the normal spellbook fights. It made it possible to kill people without ancients while still keeping ancients far, far better. AKA it has already proven to work out fine.
---
The tip almost twinkles.
---
Id be more inclined to kill them knowing they dropped red bones, apposed to the generic white ones.
---
Dontcha mean always come out at the bottom
---
I’m gonna vote yes because it makes it equal to the other variation of the same item. I agree that the chaps should have a def requirement but they don’t so why vote no to it?
---
??? He legit explained it in the most simple terms, even expressing dps as actual numbers to show you can't out dps healing
---
lets change the meta, pking, and alienate part of our player base for the sake of consistency!
---
This task was insane and took me around 10 hours
---
&gt;Again, risk vs reward.
---
Yeah, I'm not opposed to having this risk vs reward, I'm in favor of it actually.
---
Most PKers, when killing most Ironmen will have no risk. Most Ironmen won't have an alt there for looting (and even if they did, the alt will see the loot at the same time as the pker) and, at that point why not have your alt just pk the guy instead?
---
The thing is, most Ironmen won't have an alt set up for wilderness content.
---
Green dragons are about to be extinct
---
Thanks.
---
yeah that was a myth people spread so you would try ice blitzing in duel arena stakes and give the people who camped it odds. 
---
Id rather have one making sense than neither
---
That's fair, but guthix and zaros will always be cheaper than the rest, and it will make getting blessed chaps better as a clue reward.
---
Gatekeeping, accessibility is important, updates effect all players.
---
And next, the world.
---
Sometimes you gotta think that it don't be that but then you really think if it like it do and then you realise that sometimes it really just does be like that.
---
Forgot to list total barrows kc, diary completion, and end game progression.
---
Where da fashionacape at? :D
---
Missing "Poll meta defining changes as QoL changes"
---
Neither of them did that tho.
---
Love that OWO 💗🦋
---
you know they can just freeze you then run then you're at max distance again right?
---
The sequence of 6 repeats.. so it may be mage mage mage range range mage.. you just gotta remember the first sequence
---
True, Forgot about the ban Wave system but I wasn't expecting anyone to get banned at all just muted for a few days (Hope they learn there lesson) and maybe if they continue to break the rules a Perm Mute, Don't think anyone in my list anyway was seriously breaking the rules just public annoyances and bad scammers 
---
Thanks!!!
---
So you think leaving it overrun by bots is better than it being slightly annoying for new players(they'd just kill the mugger quick or go somewhere else)
---
Like, a bunch of new players seeing that shit is not good for the game. A lot of people quit when they see the botfest that is f2p(which is a shame because it's really only very early f2p that's like that). 
---
It's not a good look for the game at all. It's a hell of a lot better than new people quitting because they can't get a single rock from these "level 3 people who don't awnser."
---
When is the Farming Guild going to provide an invisible +7 boost for Woodcutting like the Woodcutting guild? I really want to chop the redwood that I’ve grown myself but the XP rates are significantly lower to cutting redwoods in the Woodcutting guild.
---
This give me motivation, died 2 times to jad today :/ (first time doing fight caves since 2011)
---
any tips? (45 def, 52 prayer, 75 range)
---
And most of them fail to kill you if you flick appropriately. Thats why you see some many rcers with a fally shield. Its sort of like an emergency prayer pot.
---
I'm interested in meeting the rulemakers who decreed you can't be mad about what's in a video game.  I can be mad all I want.  When a majority of people consistently vote against content that benefits them, maybe they're the problem. As much as I admit they make the wilderness more exciting I'm also happy their content additions consistently fail.  Coz in the end a lot of their success comes from players who just want to do shit efficiently or get clues done, and get their asses beaten with little recourse.  If the wilderness had to be nerfed and pkers removed from the game I'd be perfectly happy.

Looks like he’s fitter than 90% of the rs community with the added grace of a swan ..
---
No shit the DSM 5 recognizes get 99 stats in OSRS as a symptom of autism spectrum disorder. Getting 99RC is an automatic diagnosis.
---
yeah theres definitely no way theres legit reasons to vote no...poor pkers are the victims :( ignore the pvm question also failing by a wide margin btw
---
Yes. 
---
It more of a defensive tactic on the opponents' part. You won't get killed if they stood under you. And you can just bring mithril seeds to move away like they do in DMM if you are on standards and want to stop this from happening.
---
gotta love krs 
---
Got nothing too,way too laggy and shit
---
yes
---
Same here. Difference being I'm now 25 with a job and apartment but I would still never tell anyone I play RuneScape. It just feels like a "dirty" game if that makes sense. Like why would you play this pixelated, mind numbingly repetitive, borderline autistic 20 year old browser game over something socially accepted like FIFA or an FPS? Dunno it just feels wrong, can't even download the mobile app because playing it in public would make me feel awkward af, but that's just me.
---
Pures fight against other pures. Theres no other low lvl pkers
---
I'm willing to admit that I believed that black d'hide vambs and chaps also had the defence requirement, which, upon further investigation, turns out is not the case.
---
The question would have probably fared better had it said "Should the Defence requirement found on Blessed forms of D'hide Chaps be removed, to bring them in line with the Black D'Hide equivalent? Currently they require 40 Defence to equip."
---
This seems ridiculous or just a meme but the cia were found in actuality to have been monitoring world of warcraft, and xbox live to in their wotds"search for terrorists communicating". Needless to say, they didnt find any terrorists
---
So you got no free loot, naturally go to reddit and complain as if anyone gives a fuck. Lmao 
---
Is that you Jason?
---
Look man I'm sorry that I was so immature in 7th grade.  I really do regret acting that way, but I was just a dumb kid.  Do not try to blame for you growing up to be a gay 300 lb furry.
---
I’m not a thot though! Or a guy! Damn!!! Thanks for liking my thingy I did there though
---
P
---
Too bad I dont have any pics of when I first started playing :( 
---
You chose kind of a rough day to post here looking for friends unfortunately. The PvM players (player versus monster) and the PvP players (player versus player) have been going at eachother all day over the ridiculousness that is the polls that launched today. So add that to the usual toxicity of the people on reddit and you get some very salty people.
---
That being said, I'll be your friend, I can help give you pointers and such xD I've messaged you my in-game name so you can add me, I'll be on a bit later.
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
OWO your l i f e in a car crash. 
---
Only accessible to group ironmen.
---
Can you go one post without saying "lol" like a spastic?
---
Yes and change the entire pking meta ruin everyone's pure accounts when you don't want a small change that has only positive effects on the game.
---
Rock pet is best pet 
---
I'm fine with blessed d'hide not having a defense requirement, as long as it has a prayer requirement. If it was 70 range and 50 prayer to wield, id be cool with that. prayer makes more sense to me anyway.
---
Lol that was terrible ngl
---
Kill. No mercy for these pvming peasants.
---
Please stop
---
It does, but a toggle still doesn’t work because why would you toggle on the points hit?
---
for chinning ofc \^\^
---
Oh cmon I did this shit all day at work why didn’t i think of this -.-
---
Lets not pretend training magic is hard, slow, or expensive in the current day
---
Ok :)
---
At the time of this post, there's 1 anti-phishing one with 1.5k "viewers".
---
If you pked at all you'd know pures risk the least out of any account type, it's 1/2 the reason for the build. 
---
99.9% of pures wouldn't be using blessed d'hide in the wild
---
I love pking but I voted no to spite hoarders who try I profit off poll results. I will never forget Hamflex and the 75k climbing boots fiasco, so I always vote no to any poll that could increase an items price.
---
kys
---
Ok
---
I meant it more as when someone does return you could say something super cuddly like “Hey! Welcome.”
---
Then it’s like 
---
*im going to act like a fucking OSRS giga-virgin and toast this newbie* wtf so so so many players do that it’s so ugly
---
Stop botting
---
&gt; Zulrah has massively overtaken vorkath in gp/hr the last two weeks.
---
I wouldn't say massively, they are still very comparable and vorkath still has the advantage of being extremely afk.
---
&gt; It is failing because people think it will make vorkath harder when they reach that point in the game due to poor wording.
---
It's not poorly worded. It says exactly what it does, people who haven't done the fight might not understand but thats on them. They can't write a vorkath guide just to explain it lol.
---
Let’s see, starting from the top left:
---
1. Walk here when cursor isn’t on a place you can walk to
---
2. Vorkath in GWD
---
3. Cerberus in GWD
---
4. Minimap is of GE
---
5. Saradomin hilt drop has the wrong item model, not sure what it is.
---
6. Raids 1 inventory (Void helms when not using void, raids pots, pickaxe)
---
7. Bandos boots drop when you didn’t get them
---
8. Killing Graardor when not actually killing him 
---
9. Fake Ironman symbol
---
10. Ironman while working with someone else (I think, not sure in this)
---
11. Fake account name
---
That’s what I found, I’m probably missing some stuff because I don’t really do GWD. I’m also not sure if the prayer thing in the bottom right of the screen is supposed to be there.
---
Also great for Ironmen who wants to accept the lifestyle of standing alone
---
You are aware that you can wear black d hide chaps on a 1 def right?...
---
- Raids inventory
---
- Vorkath in Saradomin lair 
---
- Cerberus in Saradomin lair
---
- Bandos boots drop at Zilyana
---
- Hydra’s Claw on ground instead
---
- at GE
---
Hmmm a spell that's stronger, does lots of damage, and requires a quest for ancients isn't affected by protect magic but a spell anybody can cast with far less effort and does next to no damage is affected by protect magic? I voted no 
---
In the same vein though I think it would be nice for maces to have prayer requirement and an increased prayer bonus. While capitalizing on OPs idea, removing the attack requirement since you don't really need to aim a mace, or warhammer, like you would aim a stabbing or slashing weapon at key points in the enemy's armor.
---
HAHA DUDE WEED LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Backing out of my challenge because you're scared, typical ROT lackey behaviour
---
This is what happens when pkers treat us pvmers like shit for years. No to all your updates xD. Now how does it feel when i say it, cya fkin idiots
---
Again with the insults. And Im the bitter one? 
---
  
---
Fashionscape not being QoL, and PKer's not adding a 200k+ risk are objective statements. 
---
Wanting to save money on slayer is subjective. 
---
No one gives a shit if you didn’t get any free stuff. Rofl. I bet you beg at the ge don’t you 
---
&gt; the region locked uim has gone to far with the memers but they don’t bitch and moan
---
https://i.imgur.com/tybqRUq.png
---
They literally added a teasing stick spawn into the game just so this 1 specific region locked ironman account could train hunter. How is that fair, but d'hide chaps isn't?
---
They added a built-in auto-typer so that they wouldn't be muting so many people that are trying to sell stuff, get a duel, etc.
---
So unfortunately automating it doesn't seem possible at this point.
---
If you go into the wilderness expect people to try and kill you
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH god I needed to know that.. I’ll be on too! I’ve been glued to my PC today hehe 
---
Wow, what will i ever do now that account types that i don't play can't get 1 additional prayer bonus???
---
I guess I’m a fucking plant then mate, fucking deal with it
---
wait so hold up, ranged armor which is meant to be good vs mage is good vs mage?
---
What the hell is wrong with some of the people that play this game...?
---
People LOSING THEIR FUCKING MINDS vehemently voting no, citing how it would create a big change with pures and give them a "buff" (yeah bro...+1 pray, HUGE buff) is some of the most illogical shit ive ever seen. This is just butthurt people that are killed by pures voting no out of spite and next to 0 logical thought.
---
What the hell is wrong with a Pure getting a "buff" of **+1 pray** and fashionscape? Are some of you people that salty and butthurt that you vote no with anything even remotely (and +1 pray and fashionscape is just about as remote you can get with "buffs") related to pures and/or pvp?
---
It doesnt make pures stronger or unbalanced literally at all. Its freaking +1 pray and fashionscape. How some people are so strongly saying no about this just shows how salty and spiteful they are. Theres absolutely no problem adding to this game and it would legit change nothing.
---
I'm not convinced that's true, but I don't think armor requirements should be removed for fashionscape.
---
No one gives a flying fuck about you sob story about not getting free shit. You’re pathetic. 
---
slayermusiq would not approve this. 
---
Thanks for responding ,but your feedback 
---
Lol a lot of people on here are looking for angsty memes or someone to try and bring down. It's unfortunate, but that's the internet in a nut-shell. :/
---
cya in lummy
---
Defence capped pvp worlds? Wtf? Thats so private servery. Im a pker and i can straight up see thats bad for the game
---
Good chance he will recover it again
---
If this shits true I feel so bad for you. I would suck a dick for a damn tbow lol.
---
How do pouches even work? I haven't played in a very long time... do they just allow you to carry more essence? If that's the case, how do I obtain them? Is combat required? Sorry if I'm asking dumb questions heree :P
---
Why 75 defense and 66 hp, though?
---
How can you put an asterisk and not have a key telling what it means
---
Just take a screenshot without gear
---
if its not skill, why dont u try 1 tick "using" an item on an object about 1 tile width in game, all the way zoomed in and all the way zoomed out. this will simulate big icons vs small icons. come back to me then and tell me it doesnt require skill
---
Hey it’s cool it’s cool, nothings gonna change with that haha
---
Just found out she killed herself after seeing your small Penis. Gg 
---
Uhhhhh....... 
---
Fuxk it
---
Grats, nice drop
---
Yes.
---
Now what?
---
While we're at it, make the looting bag able to hold grimy OR clean. All herbs in bag must be grimy or all must be clean. 
---
Obviously
---
Your life?
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE.
---
Somebody call the wambulance. Waaa says the noob. Where’s my free stuff. Free gp plox. Lmao pleb 
---
Tbh my ult reminds me of the new resident evil 2 with all those hip pouches
---
Thats true as well, intensive and repetitive can be just as bad, u do need a bit of variance which is why i think volcanic mine is so great for the game. Even herbi has enough variance to be a little interesting.
---
Im really looking forward to zalcano if it passes, hopefully it is what wintertodt couldve been
---
mate u took out the part of my post that countered his logic. 
---
you either look at all the chaps or look at the chaps added to 07 which is just 1 (arma). 1 def got another chap in 2012. 
---
I’ll try those, thanks 
---
Rata has logged in.
---
Based on the poll results so far today I'd say it's safe to assume that debacle wasn't only pker's faults. They don't have the numbers.
---
A Friend didn't drop any items, the ironmen accounts were completely seperated from the issue. 
---
I've re-read the rules and there is no distinction between the two types, being direct and indirect and their consequences. 
---
I still believe it's not fair.
---
Hey all! Pretty new player.... heard about RuneLite and want to download it! Just wanted to make sure it’s safe, and I won’t get banned for it. Thanks!
---
Add the Zulrah, Vorkath and bird nest nerfs aswell
---
Killing pvmers is acuallity great way to learn pking. I personaly love going to revs with just 2-3ppl. You always find action and get to practise swaps. 
---
Not really, a +5 str helm that doesn't use scales would be extremely popular. Serp helm is expensive to use. 
---
Also Ironmen would jump on that like a bitch in heat. 
---
give them a jad phase
---
Lmfao at the guys who never once bridded in their lives making a case for standard vs ancients "fire surge moar damage". Lmfao id love to brid any of you, me on ancients and u on standards
---
Tell me about it
---
&gt; If you really cared about pking, you would be asking the PvMers "what would make you more likely to pk" instead of trying to force through OP updates so you have an easier time killing them.
---
Has nothing to do with me caring about PKing or forcing op updates.
---
Simply want the game to be consistent. This doesn't make the spell book OP, it makes a 7 second freeze turn into a 15 second freeze. It will NEVER compete with a 20 second freeze, ever. It makes no sense that a spell that is going to splash 5 times is a 7 second freeze. 
---
It's is literally a change so that solo PKers have a chance PKing. Right now it isn't "in some situations" - it's literally all situations. By a default, the spell splashes consistently and freezes for 7 seconds. That's a default variable. That's how the game works, and it's outdated.
---
Your name is on the bottom
---
I think that's partly because the pking community is split up more. You used to have specific areas and worlds to pk on, but with the introduction of pvp worlds, pvm/skilling activities insied the wilderness, and bh worlds the pk community is split up more.
---
R
---
Big facts. 
---
That does sound good. I’m going to look into what rs3 added to get a better idea. But osrs needs something that isn’t rushed. And fully thought out
---
Lol fail xD
---
regardless of weather this shpuld pass or not, adding multiple BIS items in a quality of life poll is absurd.
---
The best solo PK spots I go to are:
---
Black Chins
---
Lava Maze teleport location (burning amulet)
---
The prayer altar (sometimes okay)
---
There are some other general slayer spots but I don’t really go there as you have to lose aggro.
---
My girlfriends first sight of it was me killing dragons on task. She has never referred to it as RuneScape only “ killing dragons “ and different phrases similar. She would keep trying to Snapchat that shit to her friends and it would make my blood boil. 
---
Also, 20M used car salesman who’s been on and off that grind for about 10 years in the closet lmao 
---
it got upvotes because it’s a joke lmao 
---
Idc about my first name being out there lol
---
It is safe and you will not be banned. I've been using it for months now.
---
If you're referring to the drama from last year about Runelite, it's been sorted with.
---
My mans even got 99 rc . 
---
Nice.
---
Ding ding ding
---
My brain hurts
---
this should not have even been polled, just remove the req....
---
That was like 8 years ago mate get over it
---
impressive to say the least
---
I mean,+1 pray bonus doesn't really do much, pures hardly ever use pray boosting gear anyway. Other than fight caves I don't see a niche it would fit into. Maybe nmz but even then absorption method is still meta. I have a nearly maxed 75 attack pure (94 mage rather than 99) and I'd prefer this poll didn't pass just because it would look out of place, but I really don't give a shit either way as I'd never use any of them. 
---
Road to max pet kc incoming
---
This guy scapes
---
I'm already tracer!
---
&gt;Generalizing is bad. Unless its for pkers of course.
---
No I feel you, I don't care if people want +1 prayer. I just think the issue with this poll is that most of these aren't QoL changes. Like the Serp helm one isn't QoL at all, its a major game change. 
---
A Friend's ban was more for advertising something Jagex didn't approve of while on Jagex's platform. The accepting gold and real money for it may have played a part, but wasn't the entire thing. 
---
The situations just aren't comparable. 
---
A friend wasnt banned for rwt, he was banner for being associated to a sketchy gambling website.
---
Sure but the solution to that isn't to follow your suggestions without a poll.  
---
That's pretty gay.
---
One of those nazi streamers I see yikes
---
I don't understand why people say it was only bad for PvPers if it passed, being able to quickly use spells is a part of PvM too.
---
Freeze timer should also be halved on ancients instead, honestly. Standard spellbook doesn't need buffs - TB is ridiculously OP on its own. I doubt anyones going to vote to make the standard spellbook stronger for pvp while TB exists in its current form. 
---
LEAP YEAR??? Yep I just burst that bubble lol. 
---
If you use standard spellbook, you got like 8/10 runes to cast those spells, thus your inven is fucked.
---
I was getting 105k xp/h with rune bars and a lot of mistakes, they're definitely not that slow.
---
but muh spade
---
Well the main reason is that alot of people don't understand what jagex meant when they said they wont let mobile influence pc design. They meant that they will not create an update that caters to the stripped down, mtx driven mobile gaming market. Their comment does not mean that a qol update launched to mobile will never come to pc. Hell they could have introduced it on pc first and then mobile. It would be the exact same except for the triggered vocal minority shouting how bad it is wouldn't have noticed and therefore not spoken up.
---
why do ironmen run the game is the bigger question, single player game mode in a multiplayer game
---
Do you accept blacks?
---
Would be really interesting to see someone speedrun all the quests, it’s probably doable in 15 hours with huge optimizations.
---
It is, which is why we received pvp updates in the past that weren't polled? That is the exact solution. A majority of PvP balancing changes have not been polled. As most of them technically "make it harder" to play.
---
[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Poll\_Blog:\_Bounty\_Hunter\_and\_PvP\_Changes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Poll_Blog:_Bounty_Hunter_and_PvP_Changes)
---
Here is an entire update blog on changes that weren't voted into the game. As none of them would have passed, because they were PvP changes.
---
All of these showed to be beneficial for pvp. 
---
Go fer it m8....im flattered 
---
Mining your own essence, with a bronze pickaxe, no rune pouches.
---
I skipped out on the question but honestly, vorkath already is an incredibly easy boss that's way too lucrative to slay for how easy it actually is.
---
The problem is spite voting, voting no against something strictly because it only pertains to 1 sect of the community is in and of itself asinine.  One of the major reasons why pvp questions fail is because of how toxic some* pkers can get when fighting others in game. Note the * next to some, some are and some aren't; but a majority are. Pvm-related questions effect everyone since it massively affects the economy, thus they rarely fail. Pvp-related questions effect a small portion of the player base. It's basically minority vs majority.
---
He has a massive ego when it comes to raids. If you say anything negative about his raiding he flips his shit. I've seen him plank to Olm &amp; get emo to the point of shutting his stream off before.
---
70k people will watch a pvp event but everyone suddenly hates pking lol
---
High Budget Meme
---
It's extremely alarming like what the actual fuck. i can only imagine these are new players because these are the kind of changes that actually screw up the old school feel.
---
No.
---
I agree but is a removing The 40def req from These chaps a major game Change? Because they Are basically recolored Black dhide chaps
---
I haven't clipped any myself but ask anyone that watches his stream occasionally and they'll confirm it.
---
You can use whatever you want. Getting the status bar up to be eligible for the void commendations doesn't take much. Pest control is not meant to be an efficient training method
---
But that being said maybe rune crossbow with broad bolts and a book of law
---
And training prayer at w330 Rimmington 
---

---
What youre saying literally makes no sense in reality.
---
&gt; The disadvantage is stark. You can bring anti gear as much as you like, it doesn't help when most of the pvm content is in multi combat.
---
So then complain about it being in multi, not about pkers which is and should be the inherent risk of doing some PvM content in the wildy.
---
&gt;  I don't want the wildy to be no risk.
---
I mean sure sounds like it. Complaining about people who are geared for and practice PVP having a major advantage in...PVP. I know thats a novel idea. Or you could bring anti gear, learn how to pk and realize its totally fair and nothing to cry about. Crying about making entangle and normal spell book not complete ass sounds like it too, its not ridiculous at all for someone to want to bring the normal spell book from complete ass to...not quite as shit. Its not like making entangle actually semi viable and consistent with other mechanics in magic makes the spellbook even remotely OP compared to ancients. And it usually isnt too hard to either tank+box or gap and log a TB its not like TB is some OP 100% death mechanic like you make it sound.
---
&gt; I do however think it's ridiculous for pkers to complain when they get to 10v1 people who can't fight back, and get to soft-bind someone for 5 whole minutes with a single spell.
---
Bro the fuck are you complaining about? Youre at a significant disadvantage when its you vs 10 people? No shit...thats how it works in any game. However somehow tying a 10v1 situation to making entangle no complete shit makes legitimately zero sense. Do you think having entangle be 7 second or 15 seconds or whether those 10 people are on ancients or normals is going to make ANY difference at all in the outcome? I mean Im really not sure what you want Jagex to do, make it so you can take on 10v1? Its just how shit works in any game. What do you want Jagex to remove TB or make it so you can tele at any wildy level? 
---
And its 2.5 minutes if you have any clue what youre doing and can pray mage, if its 1v1 (which is really the only situation the game can be balanced around..anything 2v1 or greater will be inherently unbalanced and based upon your skill and levels/gear) you can tank or box or gap and log a half TB fairly easily if youre half way decent at the game.
---
&gt; TB alone is powerful enough to merit having a mage with the standard spellbook on your team already. Basically there's no way people are going to vote to buff a spellbook that already has a ridiculous spell in it. They'd have to make TB reasonable first.
---
Youre just sounding like you want there to be little to no risk being in the wildy then. The fact you need to have a completely different person on normals so they can TB just shows how shit the normal spell book is, AND youre going to be at a disadvantage 2v1 or greater no matter what. In fact, since you complain about being piled in multi so much you should be in FAVOR of changing entangle since it would actually encourage more solo pking instead of it always being at minimum a 2v1 fight. 
---
TB is no where near as OP or "unreasonable" as youre making it out to be. Not only are there multiple ways to counter it, or get away from it but the person has to be on a dog shit spell book and sacrifice any viable way of freezing and a lot of dps just to use it. Theres absolutely nothing unreasonable about TB, you just sound like you cant counter it because you dont know the many ways you can. Tanking a half, boxing or getting gap and logging out are all viable counters to TB. Wanna know how easy it is to counter a TB? When you get unfrozen, freeze them and run away and log. 
---
99rc????? 
---
yes i have a job and i eat and sleep well xd, i only spend around 2-4 hours per day at arma and i kill it with 2 accounts so i kill 23-26 every hour
---
Makes sens then, it would explain why we don’t see him often/only see him during tournaments
---
And telling stakers to stop playing RS for another website. He abused his power to advertise for jagex.
---
I don't disagree per se, I was just stating what the perception is. I think a good start for rc could be the incremental increase to 2x runes between the level you unlock it and the level you'd normally start getting 2x.
---
They did it in rs3 and I think it makes sense, but backlash would be harsh probably for those with 89+.
---
It doesn't address the travel concern, but it's something. 
---
😂
---
That sucks
---
Imagine making an account restricting yourself, and then having something added purely to make your series easier and having your braindead community praise you for it. It's like playing a game with cheats.
---
This update would have helped the pure scene as well as the people hunting clue scrolls. Their profit would have went up noticeably.

Serp helm is worse than the Helm of NezzSnot which costs next to nothing.

Thank you ,by no means is this actual stats for weapon just a general idea to get started ,I appreciate the time you took to respond 
---
If only people had to take iq test before voting...
---
It's not spreading negativity, It's telling him not to waste people's time seeing this stupid trash. Just like you should tell your cc when you gain a level in wc. This shouldn't even be on my feed. There's a reason it only has 10 upvotes. It's fucking stupid.
---
I said it nicely but bluntly and everyone cried about it. I don't care about downvotes. There's no reason to telling someone good job for clicking a tree thousands of times in a game. Earn real pets for real accomplishments.
---
Around 45,000 people have the beaver pet. Who cares.
---
Downvote me boys. But also don't post stupid things on reddit and waste people's time and we can all be happy :) 
---
Whether this is bait or legit the result is the same. You look like a fuckwit.

I dunno, I think this is mostly to do with how bad OW is to watch. Compared to pretty much any other FPS it's a goddamn clusterfuck.

It’s only game. Why you haf to be mad?

If thats what you got from my comment then you are simply a retard. Sucks.
---
Jesus christ that painful look.. Fuck that look was me when wilderness and free trade was gone and world of warcraft licht was a the thing. It was painful.
---
It should be intuitive to most that you can't cast a combat spell immediately after attacking without delay.  Again, I was in favor of the change but tbh it really doesn't matter
---
Raids pots lol
---
based and redpilled. thanks for bothering to respond to these types of people
---
That shit needs to be repolled. Their half-measure actually made shit *worse* because now when I switch from mobile to desktop the spellbook is still filtered with the tiny icons. I’d rather have it just not be filtered at all on desktop. 
---
Go outside lol
---
These stats by no means will be finalized but I was thinking making 85+ range and 4+ range str will balance it more ,bows shouldn't be stronger than cross bows

Counter QoL add 40 def req to all dragon chaps and vamps

Yea it’s a bad gameplay mechanic. We crest a shortcut they requires high agility but you have to be in a hole for 2min.....?isn’t the point of agility shortcuts to make you get to places faster
---
No no, he’s right. Clearly standard black d’hide chaps/vambraces are the outliers and should be brought in-line with the rest of the t70 ranged armor. 
---
We want all dragon hides to be 40 def req as well so it has nothing to do with the 1 prayer

MM2 requires 69 Slayer now btw

Why bother with 1M def. 🙄

You forgot to bring the other pieces of your void retard

In the U.K. Lots of people go to jail for 'hate speech' the government has a very loose description of what exactly that is. So if you say something they don't like they can put you in jail. I know a year or two a man was arrested (don't know if he was jailed too) for simply reading out a winston Churchill speech in public. Anti Semitism was also made illigal a few years ago too, don't know of anyone being arrested for that yet. 
---
So it's very possible they put a kid in jail for over a joke.

I don't have fun when I want to win and half the team is blatantly afk. "Who cares" is just glossing over it as if it's not a problem.
---
It's actually really annoying putting in effort for 20 minutes while someone just willingly leeches off of your work. Yeah, they may be content with getting 1 point each time for losing, but it's a competitive minigame. I play for fun, sure, but the point is to win. Leeching at this minigame or any other should not be tolerated in the slightest. 
---
A lot of salty pures hitting you

Oh my God you unleashed a whole new level of rockery in my brain.

Not gonna lie he isn't great at PvP based things anyway. He Hybrids (not tri) and only Edge pk's. His input wouldn't be the most useful.

This community is so fucking toxic.
---
The response is really dumb. Not once did indicate everyone? The top comment says nobody would want harder mechanics and I am disagreeing 
---
It’s good for dragons if you want to melee and it’s good for raids. 
---
What makes you say "who cares?" You might not care, but people who enjoy these monigames might. You also say that as if there are always a balanced number of leechers. Ofren times there are a high amount of higher-levels leeching, thus leaving low levels to guard and defend.

The Devs have a majority of the PvP content creators telling them of flaws and issues in the game and they get ignored. If they hired a PvP dev chances are he wouldn't actually be a pker in game and his voice probably wouldn't get heard in content creation brainstorms/meetings.
---
Pretty sure literally everyone is in agreement with you and jagex refuses to respond for whatever reason. It’s a meme at this point
---
I see Dio actually plays Runescape, who knew.

Do you have an argument why rune legs should require defense but dhide should not?
---
Ironman at GE
---
&gt; 1) You can't anti-pk when its 10v1. You just die. Thats why nobody bothers trying.
---
Ummm yeah...thats how it works. In any game. This has little to nothing to do with entangle and the normal spell book though, your gripe is with how the wildy is dominated by clans and solo pking is completely marginalized today. As much as I dont like that, its not unbalanced or unfair at all its simply a numbers game.
---
&gt; 2) Not being able to fight back whether you try or not isn't fun.
---
Again 10v1 fights arent meant to be fair..so yet again no clue what youre crying about? The game and almost no game revolves around making 2v1, 3v1, 4v1 etc "fair" or not significantly disadvantageous. 
---
&gt; 3) Nobody is going to vote to buff any pking form while 1 and 2 are true.
---
Makes zero logical sense. Your gripe is with multi combat and clans then, entangle and the normal spell book is not the problem. Anyone who actually knows what theyre talking about knows that buffing entangle is something that should have happened LONG ago. 
---
You dont forego trying to fix things that revolve around the balancing of 1v1 in favor of the fact it would make a 10v1 situation even more disadvantageous (no clue why you keep complaining about a 10v1 scenario, but it doesnt make you look like you have any clue what youre talking about).
---
&gt; I just want balanced risk and balanced reward. Not already unbalanced pkers getting even more unbalanced.
---
Whats currently unfair about PvMing for high profit in the wildy then? The fact you cant PvM and also have just as much of a chance to kill someone PvPing or let alone MULTIPLE people PvPing? Things are not meant to be completely balanced, what you want is something that would be completely unbalanced in a bad way you want to have your cake and eat it too. Theres plenty of people(myself included) who can PvM in the wildy and do just fine, you just have to be good and know what youre doing.
---
If you want to complain about something, then complain about PvM being in multi areas(significantly reducing risk..something you said you arent complaining for) and how the wildy is dominated by clans and PJing mechanics.
---
&gt; 5) Making the standard spellbook even more powerful isn't going to magically make pkers fight fair.
---
That would require the standard spellbook to even be remotely powerful in the first place LOL. What is being suggested it to make it suck A LITTLE BIT less, not make it OP. 
---
No one is ever going to try and fight fair. You seem to be under this false notion that everything in the game and wildy should be 100% balanced and fair, that everyone should have an equal chance to do everything. Except thats not how any game works, or life. You will have, and there will be disadvantages and advantages its what makes something enjoyable, without parity things would be pretty boring.
---
So do you think a Pker should see you PvMing and say "wait let me let you go bank, get in proper pking gear maybe practice a bit so you get on the same skill level and then fight"? Thats what would be "fighting fair", and as you can see its a completely ridiculous notion.
---
&gt; 6) Soft-freezing someone for 5 minutes forcing them to tank an extra 30 levels for a single cast of a single spell is ridiculous "risk vs reward." Balance cuts both ways.
---
Nope, its not. Completely ignoring the fact anyone with half a brain will pray mage and make that TB 2.5 minutes to begin with. Not sure why you keep using this erroneous phrase "soft freeze" to describe TB either. But there is plenty of ways to counter a TB and also escape a TB, youre making it sound unbalanced and unescapable when its not even remotely true. How much you exaggerate the strength of TB and act like theres zero balance with it just says you simply have no clue how to counter and get away from one which means its not a problem with the spell its a problem with you.
---
you're absolutely fucking out of your mind.  
---
i'd be down for full entangles through prayers if i could tele anywhere out of the wilderness.  
---
it's also not underpowered in the fucking least  
---
see: fire surge, teleblock, and snares. it's in an ok place, and tbh why should it even match ancients? ancients has one of the hardest quests in the game as a requirement, DT
---
Nah, I played runescape back in like 2007 with my friends and then played WoW with some friends in high school a bit in college, played osrs with some friends later in college. My current friends know I play, it’s not like it’s my little pony or something that has a stigma lol

I never looked into it but that’s crazy it’s only two games for that I might have to now

That's not how drop rates work
---
You aren't guaranteed to get a drop in the droprate
---
Where in my first post did I say that there shouldn't be a risk? Re-read it and let me know. Pointing out that TB is insanely overtuned and therefore standard shouldn't be buffed until that is addressed // wanting the wildy to be risk-free. 
---
Not guaranteed at 128, it's 1/128 in the long run.
---
Not sure if sarcastic or stupid.....
---
We have to go there to get BiS pickaxe, magic capes, diary cape and clue scrolls. I got it all now and only go back for clue scrolls. We are actually forced to go there, believe it or not. Now if i decide to go for pets, I would need to pay fucking RoT for BiS items as well.. But pets of course isnt necessary 
---
No way Im gonna vote yes for somethibg that is just gonna screw non-pkers over. Also its not a good approach to begin with.
---
Its a nerf. It removes a mechanic. The fight becomes easier. There is less to worry about. If you think it's not a nerf you have a flawed idea of a nerf.
---
Everything you've said has been stupid, that's why you get downvoted.
---
You are correct 2006scape didn't make it into beta before it was shut down.
---
Feels . At least for ironmen Hunter is very rewarding 
---
I’m not saying it should be, although that’s long gone anyways. But I think they should have some way of restricting it besides a total lvl, I assume that’s still how they do it, if so that’s not hard to get and many people have several accs to vote on
---
You'll contract it along the way
---
It’s really funny how salty everyone gets over it. 10/10 picture though👌
---
Lmao barrage into venge and dclaw rush 
---
RC is probably best skill for gp/hr. Other skills are slow or money sink. RC is slow but at higher levels you can reach 1mil gp an hour. I can't think of other skills with consistent money. 
---
You can't honestly think that, right? It doesn't take 5 years, and definitely not 12 years, to get a basic understanding of the game. Stop being an elitist.

Anybody who wants the bow to be nerfed is just broke af.

This is true, but you have to be practical about it. He may have spent enough hours to make 10k at min wage, but there's no way he would *actually* have made that 10k because if it were work, he wouldn't have spent the time.

Many of the high level pvm community voted no to the huge spellbook icons as they're not needed and lessens the high level pvm skill cap. 
---
"How high are you?"
---
"About 60%" 
---
Yeah; I don’t know what’s going to happen; it seems the more I reach out for support the more negative robotic like responses I receive and it’s really frustrating. I’m done communicating in runescape if I ever play again unless it’s specifically relevant to reading or bossing; this game is toxic sometimes. Like right now with this situation.
---
pfft normie
---
If killing it is an effective method to mine, bots will just start killing it too
---
Apart from the pickaxe, the rest of those things take a few minutes, the likelihood of encountering pkers is tiny... And one of the challenges of acquiring the pickaxe is that you have to do it in a dangerous zone. You’re only devaluing ironmen who have it on their account if you want the process of acquiring it to be easier. 
---
There's really not that much they can do,  It sucks when people vote in spite, but I can't see ways they could restrict who votes on certain content which aren't easily abusable.  Creation date doesn't really mean anything.
---
I wonder why they shelved it. I assume it was shelved on rs3 due to less cash from mtx. Is there an engine issue anyone knows of?
---
You made this yourself didn’t you? 
---
Yeah but we also make so much money from the random noobs who go into the wildy who accidentally bring to much shit and get pked or skull tricked. 
---
Should the weapons that are hardest to get &amp; have the highest requirements, as well as costing the most not be the best?
---
This is for the quest one small favor!
---
Something about this picture bugs me. I don't know what it is though. 
---
Very true; but they have the ability on their end to see literally everything themselves and verify information.
---
I openly play magic the gathering and RuneScape. I open with that on tinder. Single btw
---
I know it's easy. That's fine. If you want to have a better time, go ancients. If you want to prevent them from teleing as well, get 2 people.
---
Normal spell book doesnt need to have as easy of a time killing a person while solo pking. 
---
If you think me caring about pking in osrs doesn't mean I get to have an opinion on how easy it should be to kill me, you're dumb as fuck.
---
Don't overestimate yourself.
---
Well, I don't think an aggressive mugger is effective at all at combating the bots, so it doesn't make sense to do it. You're effectively just adding a combat level requirement to use the mine unperturbed (like draynor willows), which is fine to an extent, but not efficient in the slightest in combating bots.
---
Given how close this is to the mages that are notorious for killing noobs, I don't think making the mugger stronger is a good idea
---
thats not quite 10k yet, get back to work boy
---
Lol what?
---
It is for pvmers because it's for everyone. Because everyone are one the receiving end..
---
Been doing revenants for a month consistently. A lot of pkers are trash. And their outcry to nerf black dhide should be ignored. 
---
Seems hella fake.
---
I voted yes because it's almost entirely cosmetic and would give pures more risk. Realistically the +2 prayer bonus is negligible at best.
---
Too bad people vote no.
---
Pures really could use some love in terms of things they can risk outside of 1m+ items. (Or I guess Robin hat is like 2 or 3m?)
---
going into the wilderness has never been a mandatory part of the osrs experience, lots of the best moneymakers are in the wilderness. The underlying assumption for this is that it is due to interaction with pkers. If you want to go hunt red chins for 1.8k ea instead of black chins for 3.4k ea your welcome too.... 
---
Are you actually serious? When was the last time you saw 80% no on a poll? I take my question back, actually. You're obviously joking, but still. Maybe the people who upvoted you thought you were serious.
---
It's nice to hold compost if you're doing herbs and allotments in the same run
---
A prime example of why RS players are easily recognized as autistic
---
When was the last time you ever saw over 75% no on a poll? How can you make any other conclusion than that people are voting no out of spite?
---
I do a lot of skilling and money makers in PvP. Black d'hide shouldn't be nerfed. Most pkers aren't skilled at what they do and any pvmer or skiller with basic defense gets them upset when they have to try harder. Keep black d'hide the way it is, sometimes TB fails, you try to kill them before they run away. 
---
At least it wasnt r/titlegore . It was useful and didnt make mt brain melt.
---
LOL most fans come in late. OGs know wassup. 
---
Not completely just don’t like how the voting system is now. I know that would have way more problems. Nothing would ever get voted in, but it’s interesting to think about how it would change the system. I just think something needs to change but maybe I’m wrong. 
---
Yeah I can agree I’d probably have the same perspective if I wasn’t me; in the moment I didn’t know their actions against me would actually happen out of malicious intent
---
What's your rsn?
---
This is actually very easy to do using the drop trick.  
---
Unfortunately, having this in your bank means you wont get any more hard clue scrolls though.  
---
PvM has all BiS content
---
PvP has a cape
---
Bad game design.
---
1 prayer bonus wont make a 1 def pure have an easier time at gwd lmfao
---
Oh no you died in the wildy doing a clue? I don’t pk, I’m a pvmer and it took 1 time for me to 3 item clue the next time.  If someone kills me cool, I’ll try another world.  This literally impacts us 0... you waste maybe a few minutes tops
---
Oh, they actually went and changed it.

My bad. I didn't even know they edited polls between initially publishing and the polls going live.
---
Hey let me not be able to do almost half of my clue scrolls. Thanks mate 
---
True. I remember reading somewhere that they are like... 17 or something? I think that was what made me laugh the most at some of these clips because of how super serious shit is drawn. 
---
Who's crying? I would like to help them out.
---
if you keep campaigning for them to be consistent you're honestly more likely to end up making ancient spells be affected the same way
---
Revenants. It's a good rush if you're the pvmer.

All I see is "btw btw btw btw btw btw Ironman btw"

Good idea; wish I could just pay a mute fee.. honestly lmao. I didn’t do anything to ruin the game. I should be able to pay a fine or something and get a years mute; but it just doesn’t work like that.
---
Nah, you can easily get kills with normal spellbook, its balanced. The problem is that the ancients are broken (ice barrage).
---
If you go in the wild, at least be fucking prepared to anti PK. Is that so hard? Why dont people get this? I'm lvl 77 and have trained to 78 slayer all through the wilderness. I get it, lol.
---
Bruh how much for kandarin elite diary
---
Train a lot more then to be able to even afford Jad properly.
---
I’m barbarian fishing right now. I can give you one if you come to me at barbarian outpost
---
Yes its a buff. A buff back to previous stats. Personally I never thought it made sense to nerf the str on it. Nerfing the defense would be a better aproach.
---
Good luck.
---
I'd recommend getting your stats up first. Prayer, hp, defense, and range are all fairly low.
---
We can finally play the game
---
Deadman Mode?
---
Gz, now gamble it.
---
Described it better than I could lol. Exactly what I was thinking with people not understanding the game. Maybe what I said was a little drastic but this is what I meant if you played OSRS from the start you likely know why it was made, it seems now there’s a huge crowd that wants it to be something different and it could turn into osrs3 if we don’t watch what we do. Just speculating completely and I hope I’m wrong
---
And I’m not saying it should be completely the same like everyone’s thinking, I want updates like we’re getting just don’t want them to get out of hand.
---
I know this isn’t worth any dev time, but in a perfect world, what if lower level and medium level monster’s defensive stats were more specialized for each monster? This would be to give certain lower level monsters a more prominent weakness to specific weapon types, rather than just bland, general defensive stats that allow the scimitars be meta. This is following how higher level PvM weapons work, where say normal dragons are weak to stab, and metallic dragons are weak to magic, but anything can be used on these creatures whether it’s their “true” weakness or not. 
---
Explains why google trends shows World of Warcraft related topics when you put in 'wow'. And why Wowhead alone has almost 1/10th of the traffic OSRS does. And how OSRS having more traffic than WoW makes literally no logical sense. 
---
Also, funnily enough, the post above you shows the word 'wow' being used much less in the US than when you hit worldwide. So apparently the word wow which has no real logical usage as a search term other than the game and one ISP is being used in many countries which most likely don't know the English word itself.

Can you message me in rs  kerma-denssi?

Lmfao did someone pk you on a clue kiddo?

I own both a pure and a main. I don’t feel a need for blessed D’Hide to be inflated in price because pures want to use it now. They don’t need it. They’ll be fine. It’s a bonus that comes with having defence

You're going to be frozen and tbed regardless... this would have just encouraged solo pking instead of duo pking, giving you a better chance. Lol you people are clueless
---
This is not what I had in mind... as that’s for tournaments and is a wild and sometimes random process of elimination till the final rounds :/ for the small folk at least 
---
Haha yes im going to get 40 defence levels so my account can get that incredibly overpowered + prayer bonus

It costs what it costs because it's op

Bullshit response if true. Holy hell

I see nothing wrong with it

I was so embarrassed by playing runescape in high school. Now I don't give a fuuuuuck. Someone on Facebook posted their playtime and I replied with my 188 days. As you get older I guess you learn nothing matters and nobody actually gives a shit about you. Do what makes you happy, cause people are too caught up in their own lives to care. Don't worry, be happy, so your thing.
---
Jagex doesn't care and they won't help, he tried many times in person at runefest
---
You've got the wrong person.
---
Should be a square like zeah
---
Can someone edit this and take the hp bars out please? I want it as a wallpaper
---
OW might be a shit game, but the streams tend to be lot more popular than OSRS ones. I think it might be because they're all in NA right now, and they're all offline at the same time
---
I personally don't think so.

U paid extra that u didn’t need to

100% this was just a thought I had because I remember being 16 mortified. Now I couldn’t care less. 
---
So I'm slightly confused on this. How did you use tridents, scales and darts with 0 xp in mage or range? I've never understood how this has worked. Inform an individual who is drastically confused? :p
---
Sucks when people treat you the way you treat others, doesn’t it?
---
This is basic knowledge lol
---
This is only talking about the CHAPS, not the body.
---
While there is a time investment for sure. Zulrah and Vorkath do not take skill. There's a learning curve, obviously, but they are super easy overall and give way to much money.
---
All conference d3 lacrosse. Play all the time lol 
---
&gt;You can’t give things a better design because then people would cry out that it reduces the skill gap.
---
That's a valid reason, though. And it's not just pkers, look at how all of reddit cried years ago when jagex even mentioned looking into prayer flicking. It's bad design, but at this point it's the meta and changing it would fuck the game.
---
&gt;At the same time they wonder why nobody wants to get into a PK’ing community that tries to squeeze skill out of point-and-click RNG combat. 
---
And while I feel bad that new players have such a hard time getting into pking, there just isn't a feasible solution here that doesn't involve gutting pking until it's the most braindead activity in the game. Even then, most people still won't want to pk. Every few months, jagex literally releases worlds that allow you to set stats and have unlimited max gear, but I can count on one hand the number of people I know that used them to learn and then kept pking once those servers went away. 
---
I vote no to almost every update that would impact pking, because it rarely actually improves the rate at which new people enter the scene and I don't want thousands of hours being invalidated because a bunch of redditors whose only experience with pking consists of getting slapped on a wildy clue thinking they know what's best for the pking community. Morons talking out of their ass is why we have black chins and wildy bosses, which in no way draws new players into the pking scene and only serves to further increase the hostility between pkers and everyone else.
---
Don’t go too crazy now and invest a whole 100k to save you the 2 hours it will take to buy. That 30k is valuable

---
The defense portion magic def roll is a product of the bonus + 64 and your defense level \* 0.3.  It's literally less important that above (increases odds by about 0.01%)
---
With slayer I just divide by the number of doses I have (approx). I usually bring 8 doses per task, so if I have a task of 200 bloodvelds I’ll just repot after every 25 kills. If not slayer then it depends what I’m killing.
---
Castlewars needs some matchmaking qol to make it less aids to get into a game and some more rewards that have a use outside of cosmetics that will attract more players. 
---
Don’t listen to everyone saying get blowpipe. You can definitely do it without one, it just isn’t as easy. 
---
I would get veracs helm and skirt for the def stats it gives, as you will have to tank rangers sometimes.

Swap karils now out for time crossbow. You can use broad bolts in the earlier waves if money is an issue. Then diamond bolts (e) for the harder waves.

2v1 constantly happens in singles. The player cant attack the target at the same time but what they do is person one tbs the target then stops attacking. After which player 2 starts attacking with barrage. With the buff to the normal spellbook, actually solo pking in singles becomes alot more viable so you will more likely to be attacked by just one person instead of 2+ people that fall in on you.

There's just nothing going on in OW atm.  Overwatch League will be back in 2 weeks.

In my time playing RS I've found I'm not particularly good at combat encounters so I generally just level myself up until they're easy. Unless you need Taste of Hope right now for a reason, I'd focus on  getting your combats up to 70+ and coming back when it's easier.
---
I don't see how it's alienating really. It just forces the meta to change. Nothing inherently wrong with that.
---
Not sure it’s possible to make yourself look better by slandering streamers, eh white knight ?
---
The tbow shouldn't be nerfed.... It was obviously designed with a niche purpose which is to kill bosses with high magic level. The tbow is complete dog shit on regular mobs and only marginally better than the blowpipe on certain bosses. Nerfing it would make it utterly useless as it would lose its only role...
---
Try molten glass, with glassblowing pipe. Way cheaper then a max house.
---
I like the idea. However, wouldn’t it make more sense to be in Falador? Why would they keep a plaque with how many of their own knights you killed?

I started varsity along with my best friend as sophomores, we both spent all our free time playing RS, skyrim, and COD black ops zombies. We were the "cool kids" and we didn't have to hide our gaming, rather introduce others into and we had the whole school play RS started a school clan and it was the best years of my life. Now we all have jobs and most are rarely able to play. Luckily I am in a 6  year college program and still get 15 hrs a week to game :)
---
Ancients also has the ability to damage and heal yourself (the blood spells)

Yes. And we dont want more of this shit. Its just annoying for everyone.

😂😂👌
---
If your goal is to make people use other weapons and not purely by dps you'd have to have all the weapons very close to eachother in dps and have people choose weapons on the niche they want, + adding a niche to every weapon (like hally has the ranged double hit, hasta has def)
---
example: 
---
a dagger would make you bleed
---
a mace would restore a tiny bit of prayer
---
Not advocating for these changes, they are completely made up on the spot, but this is the kind of thing you'd have to do if you wanted to actually solve this lack of weapon diversity. I can't think of anything that would work otherwise. 
---
Scythe is BIS at-
---
Supreme, olm melee hand, bloat/nylo boss/sotet/verzik 
---
It’s remarkably bad only because blowpipe is so OP. The places it should be BIS (e.g. bandos) it loses to blowpipe. For fucks sake, BP is more dps at 1st phase KQ if you’ve landed a warhammer spec. 
---
How is scythe underrated? Name ANY place I haven’t mentioned where scythe is BIS even if we ignore cost?

My whole crew played in middle school, but in high school switched to WoW. I kept trucking on RuneScape because my family was poor and our computer was shit. I didn't have any other video game systems, so I just told everyone I didn't play video games.
---
I'm sorry! I thought this was America!
---
Eventually you will only use slayer rings to get to a few tasks. 
---
A max house is pretty much the most useful thing in the game. 
---
No wtf, its good this way.. 
---
idiots
---
a couple of rooms in raids 1, and chinning.
---
it's also technically better than max range at dk prime and kq, but the difference is negligible and it's not worth bringing so many switches
---
Nice stats?????
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
Will need to get a higher level you won't really start making money until you hit sharks or something.

Best bet would be to start lobsters when you can and have an alt running back and forth to the bank to get the most gp/hr

Pretty much only use void for Vorkath and Raids with friends.

---
this resonated heavily with me. I'd read your manifesto
---
From an outside perspective, it sounds like you set yourself up to look like a snack. Doing wilderness slayer with no armor? Sounds like a chance at some free emblems, yes please!
---
Why is Jagex or the player base so against nerfing the blowpipe and Tbow? What about the scythe?
---
Teleblock isn't op then?
---
OSRS isn't some dead man's legacy that Jagex is obligated to protect the memory of, it's a subscription based game that has to keep players happy month to month, just as it always has been. That means pushing updates that their playerbase will enjoy, not turning the game into some kind of constitution where only those deemed worthy by the community can make changes to.
---
If you want polls, then you're going to have to deal with the fact that the game is almost 20 years old, and that the Runescape community along with the entire industry has changed substantially. Equating age with responsible voting doesn't work in the real world, and it won't work in game.
---
Personally, having polls on gameplay balance is a terrible idea and isn't going to work, but that can best be fixed by Jagex actually balancing their own game based on feedback, just like they have been since RSC. Content polls are one thing, but asking players if they want to voluntarily make the game harder for themselves is insane.
---
Every one of your sentences are wrong or silly.
---
Fucking traps is more straight than fucking women tbh
---
I think the warriors in the zmi tunnel have a twice as high drop rate if you wanted to get it quicker, but fire giants are still good.
---
I like the idea of buffing/nerfing existing monsters for specific weaknesses. 
---
Can't tie any negatives to pvp either cause it changes nothing about the weapons.
---
Time to start my lost update island ironman only guide

the best thing for the integrity of your life is to not play a game just to plant virtual plants and cut virtual trees.

I don't have fun in games where the majority of the team is AFK, *on purpose*. Even if 'on average' both teams will end up having the same number of afkers after a certain sample of games, it does not leave a good impression on me when I try to get back into the castle wars and the first few games are filled with AFKers. It would be better if the games weren't 20 minutes long, but that's a lot of time that I feel is wasted just due to people purposely leeching. 
---
It's not like I'm being super duper tryhard. I take it seriously because it's a competitive game and I want to win. It lowers my chances of winning when there are team members blatantly afking. Sure, it's fun that you can do what you want. But the fun part is that it's fun for the rest of the team, too. It's not fun for others when you purposely do nothing and just stand there, when someone else that would have actually participated would have taken your place.
---
It's a competitive minigame and should be treated as such, even if people play it for fun. Doesn't have to be super try-hard, but leechers should not be allowed to participate without punishment. It goes against the spirit of the game. 
---
Is it wrong of me to look at images like this and feel sorry for OP's life?
---
How about picking neither side and being a skiller :^ )

Congratulations!

I always die on Jad because I suck at switching the prayers while doing long range the healers.

Thank you

Everyone played Runescape in 5th grade (2006) for me. By 6th grade, if you played the game you were a loser. I moved up the social chain and was friends with the popular boys (who hung with the popular girls) and I was ashamed of playing. I remember when one of my popular friends found out cause the “losers” I was friends with the year before mentioned it in a crowd setting. I lied 🤥 so hard and closeted myself. Being gay irl; I believe this experience was more traumatizing than everyone in high school finding out my sexuality (only my close friends did- I told them).
---
T80 gear is a boogeyman and people are just afraid of the arbitrary number 80.  We already have loads of weapons that would pass as T80 like blowpipe, Tbow, scythe, rapier, Sanguinesti, but no one cares because you can wield them at 75.
---
What if i told you not everyone is voting out of spite. 
---
What?
---
You’re not getting an emblem from someone one iteming wildy slayer. The most you’ll get is some fucking vials and maybe a piece of food if you stack them out fast enough.
---
The pre alphas were fun as fuck though
---
Except that people have hundreds (many have thousands) of hours into building very specific accounts. So if you go and fuck with the meta that could end up ruining the account.
---
1/5000 i think

Really real OGs played projectrs06 after 06scape was shut down.

484 is an unrestricted world. Head to it for fun

40 defence takes less than a day to get LUL

because you very rarely get pk'd doing runs that there's no point in wasting the xp or profit.

Man I suck. I don’t even know these things. How am I supposed to kill this asshole.
---
LMAO who did this 🤗😅😘😊😂👏👏
---
The chat was good for 3 or 4 days but now its just like every other chat where people constantly talk over one another, often about stuff unrelated to RS.    
---
It doesn't have a very welcoming atmosphere. The discord server has about 16 different channels when only 3 of them are necessary and people  don't stick to channel conventions.    
---
The ranked users curse a lot which doesn't set a very good image. Basically the  cc went in the complete opposite direction to where I thought it would, so much so I wouldn't be surprised if Andrew put up a patreon account and had people pay for advice.
---
Jesus man, sounds like my guy had fun and I don't think this is gonna ruin his life
---
Cause it's broken in Pvp lol.
---
Lmfao! The only time I've seen mutta do this outside of being barraged or speced has been when the team "juggles" the mutta enough that he doesn't have reach for the tree. so he aggro's players over the tree and skips the heal phase. Honestly if it was not intended to behave this way, it should.  Teams that don't have zgs or barrage still can make mutta a fast room, only they risk being k0ed trying to juggle the muttas between each team member instead of letting it healing at tree.... ive raided enough to see mutta interactions, I think there is mechanic usage you are overlooking and calling bug too soon.

Acting like the +1 prayer bonus is anything compared to the +2 strength from serp is fucking dumb (Which is passing with like 90%?)

Qe all played runescape for years it okay

Solution is don't be a pure.  Pures have never risked shit
---
Do you have any other examples?
---
I appreciate the feedback
---
Asshole
---
the protect from melee prayer will protect you from melee damage wich will result in you  taking less damage i believe you should use that next time
---
Bro the person you were responding to was trolling...
---
I gotta be honest. I don’t care. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Most players get barrage KO'd in single.
---
Update, just got a shit limbs drop and a light shit frame before i finished my taks. Nicee.
---
Emblems can’t be protected and are dropped by all wildy slayer monsters so yeah there is a decent chance anyone doing wildy slayer regardless of gear might have some?
---
Very true.  I've got over 100 hours on OW, but watching OWL I can't tell what's going on
---
This is the correct answer
---
Pures 
---
Played this game for years but never personally had an interest in PvP. Maybe someday I’ll give it a shot 
---
They are also two completely different things. They should follow different rules. 
---
Your KQ point is actually incorrect, Scythe Beats Blowpipe at KQ's first form. Also Bludgeon is better than BP now if you use Fero gloves (Unless you're using ddarts).
---
Scythe is also Bis at GG's, Cerb, Thermy and sire
---
You talked to the bitch and showed her your rune defender right?
---
Just let it go my man 
---
Same. I was a varsity athlete too (not a cool sport though. Tennis) and band kid. I knew a couple ppl who openly played, but they were weird and unliked so I wasn't open about still playing except with a couple close friends. I don't play anymore but I've seen a couple times ppl have the mobile client open in public and it honestly makes me so happy. Down with the shame lol
---
Its a known thing can happen doesnt affect loot.
---
I only got the total lvl to vote so I could help ruin the game because I hate runescape. 
---
&gt;A. Combat rework
---
They basically just need to standardize weapons within a tier so Warhammer is simply a Crushing alternative to Scimitar, and make it so items don't effect faster weapons more than slower ones.
---
That isn't to say we can't have any unique items like OP suggested. But I think we need to have 1 stab, slash, crush weapon for each tier, while items like Halberds are awful, it's possible Halberds could have like -5 less accuracy so they are still useful, they just have to pay a little bit accuracy for their convenience, otherwise everyone would use a Halberd.
---
&gt;B. Completely shifting the meta.
---
While I agree this would have issues for high-end gear, namely t70+ weapons, for level 60 and below weapons this would be very helpful.
---
Could even add non-spec Dragon Weapons for T60 for some variety, too. Maybe an "Ancient Dragon Warhammer" you can buy for 60k from Tanaris that don't have a spec but works like OP described.
---
Most weapons from 70+ and up are very unique. Barrow weapons gain value from their set effect(aside from Torag's, but that's the fault of the bad set effect. For example, Guthan's and Dharok's are perfectly viable despite their slower weapons)
---
Aside from that you have whip, hastae and bludgeon mainly bringing the variety for any training weapons above level 70. I think having similar variety where at least one crush, slash and stab weapon would be equal below level 60 would be useful for that meta.
---
That way the minute slash/crush/stab defense differences that some mobs have can actually make a difference, and everyone who wants to max their DPS wouldn't just be using a Scimitar.
---
For example, [Ice Warriors](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ice_warrior) or [Green Dragons](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Green_dragon).
---
Fight stigma 2k19 lol
---
Bro do quest most of them will give tons of exp and speed up the beginning game and some also unlock new content. The fastest way to make more money is having higher stats. YouTube has a guide for every quest . Slayermusiq makes very good guides and he also has a list of quest you can do in order with with barely having to train other skills. Also and I can’t stress this enough slayer! Slayer is a great money maker. Most of it comes from later levels but it’s better to have it up so you can unlock the monsters that have good gp/hr.
---
Lmfao 24/7 for a bond you can get a bond in like 5-6 days while training essential skills. Why don’t you just do us all a favor and just quit while you’re ahead 
---
Why do u have 16?
---
Chaotic rapier had like +101 Str bonus. Ghrazi Rapier is +89 I think.
---
Thank you, i will take your comment into consideration next time.
---
Suck my dick. Lol
---
I have an extra from the quest in my bank. Costs 5m since demand suddenly sky rocketed. 
---
I dropped my gloves when doing falconary 
---
All dragon weapons have the same DPS if you do not calculate the special attack in. 
---
Because ice barrage and blood barrage are so broken, Jagex will never make bosses with low magic defense again. 
---
Hey look I'm the retard who doesn't understand that maxing means every fucking skill
---
Release Hespori seed drop rates too while they are at it. I’m constantly running out of hespori seeds despite actively do farm runs and contracts. Not sure how people get so many seeds for it, literally can’t get them to drop.
---
Bucket rates would be great too.
---
70% of your magic defense is based on your magic level. 
---
Then you pretty much need to be maxed, which takes months unless you can play literally 24/7
---
Only Konar can assign Hydras!
---
So people can 1 item with claws and hit better than Dscim? Make the pure meta even  more cancerous?
---
OMG did we really get our own twitch channel finally???
---
If you’ve pk’ed one person three times in about 20 minutes and all they’ve brought each time was one single weapon and on the fourth time they brought their bank, I’ll consider your argument. Otherwise continuing to pk like that is pointlessly being a dick. That’s the point being made, nothing about random people bringing expensive loot.
---
Got skull tricked for my craws bow yesterday, it was kind of creative how they got me but very stupid on my part
---
Hate to break it to you, but nobody cares. There are plenty of skillers, area-locked UIM is the only thing keeping people's attention atm
---
Please tell me what this amazing change you ste suggesting is. You want to make it so when you go into the wilderness you have to accept a duel to be attacked..?
---
PvPer votes don't matter, so I don't know why you're crying over that hypothetical anyway.

You've over watched overwatch to the extent you're over watching overwatch.

What happened to it? What's causing the drop in players?

why did you feel the need to repost that dumb fake text u retard?
---
100 hours, i played professionally and i can't stand watching it. blizzard doesn't really know what they're doing in regards to esports. when you compare the competitive scenes of dota 2 and ow for example, the difference is abysmal, and really shows blizzard's incompetence.

If people voting no is a problem for you, just play a different game that doesn't poll updates.
---
Seed box too
---
When you go to a polling booth during an election, does it have a % of who is being being voted for on the wall?
---
To prevent herd mentallity an make players vote for what they want. Not just copy wat the rest of then have voted for.
---
how do u play  BA
---
200 mill xp is literally the worse example possible. That is out of reach for 99.9999999999999999% of players. Reaching 90+ combat is easy purely because of how afkable nmz is, which is realistic for many players. You just believe it to be too ridiculous because you've never even bothered. 
---
&gt;PvPer votes don't matter, so I don't know why you're crying over that hypothetical anyway.
---
And thank God for that, because if you let the PvP community decide a single update they would crash this game into irrelevancy with no survivors.
---
twitch comparisons have always had very little merit/value. it's fun to compare, but doesn't mean much. 
---
Who's the slayer partner? Feel like he deserves some recognition as well
---
Orrr because people who do wildy slayer may have emblems and row (i) on them?
---
I didn't think of it from a pvp perspective initially, but it's still a pretty minor change. At 40/40 the r2h hits 15 and the warhammer 22 at 1/80. But the R2h would be way more accurate, and a 40/40 build would legitimately take like 1/4th the time to create. Furthermore, with only 1 attack those builds would have an awful matchup into low level mains.

Soldier is now gay, apparently.

It adds consistency to the game when armor for melee/mage also has defense requirements. Doesn't really make sense that platelegs require defense when d'hide chaps don't.
---
Why was it cancer? The only parts that sucked imo was running back and forth in the grand tree. Besides that the bosses were interesting, and the puzzle was challenging. All in all it was a long quest, but it never seemed impossible
---
The only other way to get gapped is if you splash a freeze from close to max distance and the animation screws you, beyond that, especially against a pvmer, you should be running a couple tiles ahead of them after catching the freeze. 
---
Explain to me beyond animations being wonky and splashing a max distance freeze, how to get gapped by someone not attacking back, because I have yet to experience that. And getting hit off by a monster in singles isn’t even being gapped, that’s just pj mechanics. 
---
In a lot of mmo's there's this rush to level cap and then start grinding but OSRS has a pretty damn healthy early and mid game to it too so there's honestly no need to rush to a high level or for lots of gold if you're new. My recommendation would be to look up Barrows Gloves and work on completing the quest that unlocks them. By the time you get them you'll be a solid level and have learnt a lot passively just by working on that one item
---
That's cool. Luckily the vast majority of this game is pvm oriented and, you know, not shit like the wildy.
---
I’m not sure that “spite-voting” is as big of a problem as people think it is. Also saying “no polls which could ever make it easier to kill ppl will ever pass” is just 100% incorrect and already disproven with past votes being passed. I don’t know why it’s hard for people to swallow that someone can disagree with them for a reason other than “they’re stupid or hate me”. 
---
This has been a lovely waste of time. Thank you for existing.
---
Easy to play osrs and watch osrs streams on the side
---
I'm not crying, I'm just voting in my interest. You and all the other brainlet spade-hunters are the ones crying, just like you do when every single poll is launched. 
---
It does affect him though. Currently a soft "barrier of entry" for pking is that you need to have 2 people. If this update passes, it will make singles pking much more viable as you've said, which just raises the chance that PvMers will run into people trying to kill them in the wilderness.
---
Didn’t expect to see a reference to glow in the dark cia n- agents here lol
---
It's a piece of shit with extreme, glaring issues to its main source of longevity (competitive) that have gone on for almost 15 seasons without a fix, solution, or remedy.
---
You're dumb as fuck.
---
I don't think its about challenging yourself half the time, I assume they just do it cause its fun. I mean I don't PvP but I can relate to invading peoples worlds in dark souls and fucking them up just for shits and gigs, not hard but its just fun
---
No problem. Enjoy your dead content.
---
This one really comes down to people not understanding the question and voting on stuff that doesn't effect them at all.  When it comes to video game design the osrs devs need to get rid of the crutch that is the polling system and make a half decent game.
---
lol.
---
check out competitive for an afternoon.
---
whats at holiday shop
---
ITT: Here's how making pkers stronger somehow makes the game better for pvmers that they kill!
---
Honestly when Woox does stuff like this I’m not even suprised
---
I mean pures should be able to wear something lmao. I understand you're not proposing to add a def req for black dhide but if there was that would make pures completely unviable...idk really how else to respond to your reply tbh
---
Pking people that have no interest in PvP isn't good for the game either, but here we are. That's the entire point of the polling system.
---
So you have to be an SJW to be gay now? Lmao
---
The spell can only do 5 at a time but it is far faster than spinning. The only way to speed it up beyond that is to do the medium kandarin diary will speed up flax spinning by 33% in seers village.
---
This is perfectly fine explanation. I'm not trying to offend you in any way or anything when I said that this wasn't what my question was asking though. I meant: How is it this is something that needs to be polled? Aside from being common sense, like why does this warrant any consideration seeing as how this is the second time this issue was pressed. This should have been dealt with, without anyone's input.
---
I am just utterly lost as to why something like this even warrants a moment's notice to even think about when the answer is so obviously YES. 
---
It's questionable because there are far more pressing matters that ought to have been polled essentially ages ago, but still aren't getting the consideration they ought to have. Instead this is the first three questions of this poll? 
---
The priorities simply cannot be explain by any logical reason to my knowledge. That is what I was seeking with my question.
---

---
oh fuck off
---
To be completely honest, OW isn't doing that well and seems to be losing public interest as a whole. 
---
Calling it esport of the year is also somewhat laughable when Fortnite(yes fortnite) has had bigger payouts in tours than it. LUL 
---
additionally dota still exists, alongside the other popular fps games like CS/CS:GO
---
Just finished watching GoT for the first time this week, cant believe it took me so long to start it that show is the tits!

Cuz blizzard nerfed doomfost 
---
I skipped the vote because it does not change anything besides making vorkath easier. 
---
Well yea, chimps like him only use the wildy for non-consensual PvP.
---
How are they merching god d'hide?  The buy limit is 8, volume under 200/day, and max ROI is like 25%.  How many pures are actually going to risk 400k instead of just using regular d'hide?  This is nothing like climbing boots.  Use the skip button if you don't know what you are talking about.
---
Why are you so upset about this? Grow up lmfao
---
most of this is just my personal experience, how it was from my perspective.
---
pkers got a scuffed minigame as a replacement for what they enjoyed when free trade was removed - pvmers/skillers at most couldn't give/get free shit so they didn't care as much (not to say they didn't vote yes, but they didn't care as much)
---
Now OSRS is a bit different because they fucked pvmers AND pkers with EoC. Skillers didn't lose much from EoC itself, but the micro transactions were effecting them most - so everyone was disliking the new RS &amp; the way it was heading.
---
The pkers started showing there was interest in the old version of the game... that doesn't mean their votes should count for more, or they should get what they want, it just means they got the ball rolling so they're "the reason" we have osrs.
---
Right but the needed distance to travel from seers to wheel wouldn't that just minus that 33% boost. I could see it being useful if i was picking the flax too but I'm not
---
Also, you spelled “people who completed quest can vote” wrong.
---
Yeah deep wildy is far from the majority of players. It should definitely get a buff of some sort, because it isn't used anywhere else otherwise.
---
How even? do you have a YT with a video on it or anything?
---
No, it means if you don’t know the full mechanics, enlighten your self first, then vote yes or no. I would rather the poll fail because people know how bad entangle is in Pker vs Pker interactions, and they still think that’s fine, than for people to vote no without even knowing the mechanics of Entangle in a normals vs ancients brid fight, because they’ve just never experienced such a scenario.
---
Lol the facts are unreal
---
I don't even play osrs and this picture makes me angry 
---
Imagine thinking PvP streams bring in more peoples' $11 than real content.
---
I don't have $11 so I just watch people playing the game I used to play 13 years ago
---
Thank god

It’s possible with OVLs from raids:)

You can have an action bar without abilities.

Why on Earth are people even watching OSRS? Isn't it like watching paint dry?

Zulrah uniques don't really lose their value as their floor price is held by the price of scales.
---
*goes into wildy* 
---
*doesnt study look up strats or how to even move around the wild*
---
*gets rekt by someone who eats sleeps and breathes wild*
---
Ignorant posts like this and the players that support you literally kill this game and I’ve watched it twice now with removing free trade and bounty hunting.
---
Pking isn’t for everyone. Especially for people who get so mad at getting destroyed in such a small percentage of the game you’re going to make multiple accounts to try and vote away people’s fun because your bad at it?
---
They eventually recovered the account and got it perm banned, I've attempted to contact jagex with no luck so I've just given up as in the end I didn't intend to return to the game anyways it's just sad that my childhood account is no more but life goes on
---
Ah yes I'm sure people who don't even know OSRS exists get very hyped for the new elf quest thats coming out. 
---
People need to know the game exists in the first place to know about the content within it. While new content like ToB and Inferno have generated exposure through twitch activity and such, I'd argue that the consistent exposure of highly-viewed videos being put out on the largest internet media platform in the world has a bigger impact than anything else (outside of mobile).
---
Did his cock taste nice?
---
don't have private chat on public = problem solved
---
Its not better gear though? why would you risk more if you don't want to?  The entire point is for it to be a cosmetic item for pures, not a better item.
---
I've actually started talking more to people since becoming an iron man. I joined an iron man clan that's pretty helpful and shit.   I would love for us to have a better clan system so that we can not help each other even more.
---
I feel like more people in RuneScape could benefit from reaching out to other players.
---
WHO IS GETTING BETTER ARMOR?  WHO?
---
This entire thing is just ignorance.
---
Pures aren't going to be chasing you around stealing your spade wearing god d'hide.  They are going to be risking it in varrock on a pvp world.  This isn't better armor, its an actual QOL update.
---
Doest even remotely resemble the nest

I hate this community lol
---
No, but forcing an agenda like that for the sake of being accepting, even when it doesn't fit the lore of the game,  makes it sjw.
---
Wheres stam pot bridge
---
I have a razer naga mouse with 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0- on it so can do everything with mouse. 
---
I think the point is that it shouldn’t be fun killin someone for no competition or reward unless you’re just getting off on wasting someone’s time and energy with your own, hence the bullying reference.
---
funny enough I think it is like this though
---
It's suffering the same fate that befell WoW, too much CC. It's better now (in Wow), but I remember sometime when it was just awful.  
---
Legitimately no fun to just be stunned in one place for 8 seconds. 
---
what does 100x combat lvl xp mean u tardo?
---
You really had to remind me.
---
Most pkers do it for the fun of it, not for rewards. What we need is elo arena pvp to give incentive
---
This is true. I was just throwing out the only way I knew of to "speed" it up haha. The spell ain't bad and gets you decent mage and crafting xp/hr as well as you make profit I  believe. 
---
You have a flawed idea of what gameplay is. Yes you can argue it makes to boss 1% easier but it takes nothing away from the enjoyment of it. The number of people who die in that way is probably so tiny that it would never be noticed. boss difficulty should come from fun mechanics not 1/20 times ticks delay your action.
---
Bone bolts is basically 0 cost and does alright. Next step would be magic shortbow imbued with rune arrows.
---
It's a repost, he owned up to it, and I see nothing wrong with the title, no u oof
---
Well the thing about RuneScape is if it doesn't increase DPS it's dead content
---
Playing both games for years, I've always thought the runescape community was way worse. 
---
Normally Overwatch sits at around 25-35k so you took this photo when it was way bellow its average.
---
Will they really risk coif if they dont risk glories etc anyways
---
Honestly cwars is just poorly designed for rewards. It took me like 40 hours to get the 115 tickets I wanted on my pure. You can get full void elite with all helms in 1/4 that time or torso in under 1/10 that time, and they're much bigger items for an account.
---
And I'd argue that most viewers of said PVP streams are already playing the game.
---
bruh you could probably make more money by letting someone who just got the pet go, if that happened to me and someone got off when they realized it i would legit give them a few mil at edgeville or somethin
---
Yeah I think adding keybound spells/prayers/items would be going too far for osrs, but it's definitely not why people hated EoC.
---
Y’know I’m still not sure what this guy was getting at... 
---
I don’t see where the reduced cost part comes in... 5 bonds for 3 months. 
---
I mean we all know a bond is usually 14 days, so yeah it would normally be 6 bonds. But the way he asked didn’t seem like that was his question.
---
That’s always been there m8
---
Yeah it's so annoying when that happens but you already fired as he went immune.
---
Really? I've also played both for several years and OSRS feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the toxic cloud of league.
---
&gt;forcing an agenda
---
THE GAY AGENDA, oh boy here we go. The writers made a character gay, they're trying to turn our kids gay! 
---
&gt;for the sake of being accepting
---
So a company isn't allowed to show they are accepting of LGBT people? Why's this a bad thing? Gay people get more representation, there is no negative to this for actual gay people. Maybe if you're a bigot and you have temper tantrums over people with a different sexuality than you having representation.
---
&gt;even when it doesn't fit the lore of the game
---
That's a new one, haven't heard someone try to say this before, likely just because you don't know what you're talking about and just pulled it out of your ass. Why don't you tell me why it doesn't fit the lore of the game? 
---
If the prayer is irrelevant then why does it matter?  Black chaps exist and pures can wear them already, so it's not like they need this patch in order to be meta.  And speaking of inconsistency, there is also inconsistency in the fact that chaps don't have defence levels, given that legwear for melee and mage all do.
---
Damn, SO good.
---
Dhide is already OP for not having a defense requirement. That's the way it is, I'm not going to propose changing it. But it doesn't make sense to give something that's already OP, a slight buff (no matter how small the buff is).
---
&gt;Pking people that have no interest in PvP isn't good for the game either, but here we are
---
I disagree, it balances wilderness content which would otherwise be overpowered. Risk-reward balance *is* a thing.
---
(Sea Shanty 2, Trombone and Tuba Cover)
---
Times like this i wish i wasnt an ironman 
---
your logic is retarded
---
Looks quite good imo. Id say maybe a 7/10 ish?
---
It wouldn't necessarily have to be best in slot: it would either be a skill-cape OR an ava-device clone (stats of the ava's device).
---
I'd really like to be able to wear my skillcape without losing too much efficiency you know? :P
---
Would you be able to elaborate? For science of course :)
---
i wonder why the pet isnt on that droptable list
---
I've always known osrs to have polling.
---
I vote no to literally every single PvP update, btw.
---
Take clue box and try again
---
that's in the public version, at the bottom of the ground items plugin settings
---
don't be crass.
---
right? everytime I see things like this I'm like how do you become this pathetic...
---
The main issue is all the content they put in the wilderness specifically to bait people who don't like pvp to participate in it. 
---
If pvp was self contained I'd be 100% in favour of them getting whatever changes they wanted, but not when them getting thise changes will directly impact me in a negative way.
---
Played since beta, I'd say Season 2/3 was by far the worst and you could get away with the simplest bullshit that would get you banned in a heartbeat now.
---
So a lot of people put on fake faces or at least have snowflaked up a bit. Still a lot worse than osrs though even now.
---
No democracy has open poll results. It is what it is.
---
And I thought the PvP community was toxic.
---
Harmless change— 1 prayer bonus means relatively nothing and it would only be fashionscape on a pure. 
---
And the “YoU cHoSe To LiMiT yOuRsElF” argument is super old at this point. There is literally no substance in saying that. Just an excuse to spite the player base you dislike.
---
Bro you’re so fucking annoying. Don’t come back lol. 
---
That does make it a touch more rough.
---

---
wow please it wouldn't pass with its base stats do you really believe the spec increases the odds of that happening?
---
You can’t blame the resize question on pvpers. It’s the try hard pvmers who want to keep the “integrity” of the game by not allowing the icons to be resized. Dusty old people who are afraid of change and welcoming new players and along with that, creating new content and developing previous content to be more interactive. This game is a fucking grind, if you don’t give new players something to grind for then you’ll just lose them. More players are good for the game, some people just need to realize that it’s 2019 and changes should be made to expand the player base, I’m not saying we need RS3 bullshit in this game but it’s little QOL polls that are spitefully put down by both sides and it’s annoying to see only major implementations put into the game and not improvements made on current content. God people are so stubborn. 
---
High effort. Very nice
---
How do ppl come up w these 😂😂
---
What changes at those milestones?
---
Current chaps should have higher defence. 1def accounts have way too many updates for them specifically it's crazy
---
Thanks for letting me know!!
---
Don’t make hydra super easy. With the 90 pool + fairy ring in house and agi shortcut its too easy if you instantly get to hydra

ur very easy 2 please i think ud b fine left in an empty room with a ball of string
---
Not op but I recently got the quest cape at 90 cb with 75 range and ds2 was a lot harder than mm2.  
---
Yeah I'm sure those bots don't also have a way to bot one of the easiest quests in runescape or anything. 
---
No task does. Barrows is a mini game 
---
That's not really true, the majority of the game is still the same, and the majority of what they've released is late-game stuff which players only reach after playing through the parts they have nostalgia for.  The PVP meta might be different, but that's actually a relatively small part of the game.
---
I can't believe I am dignifying this ridiculous strawman with a response but here goes:
---
Perhaps the most important metric for measuring the game's success is the number of active REAL players. Pkers, as real people who pay for membership, log in, and play the game, contribute to this success.
---
Bots, who are not real players, artificially inflate this number, while also damaging the economy by flooding it with raw materials that devalue activities done by normal players. Pkers on the other hand, generate demand for many items while introducing relatively little to the market, thereby increasing profitability and viability for many activities and items.

The PvP poll right now it's to lower Def requirement on an item that should clearly have a Def level around where it is because that's how tiers work. The other poll is doubling the rooted time on a spell only ever uses for killing clue scroll hunters and would not be used in actual PvP.

Why would you want a new skill just for the sake of breaking the 07 symbol , instead of realising it's would be a lot more interresting for it to be added to rune crafting, just an expensive way of training 
---
TBH the 99 RC is more impressive.
---
imo csgo is the worst community, but i do agree that league is horrible
---
 that game is hell on earth. squeaker kids calling you racial slurs for the entire game and shitting on you for the smallest mistakes. it's literally the same thing regardless if you're silver or even as high as legendary eagle

honestly couldn't pay me to play that pile of shit again. league was literally chill and fun compared to that tumor.

This makes me feel uneasy
---
honestly when i saw it was 75% no i was shocked, holy shit i'm not a pure but the hate-boners for pures are so erect and throbbing it's disgusting, as if changing the color of the pants from black to white will affect anything other than fashionscape
---
I know what you're complaining about. Some people prefer doing that, and your opinion isn't more important than theirs. 
---
Zulu is like 11500 dry of pet IIRC
---
If it negatively affects your enjoyment than yes
---
Wait. I just did the most recent polls and the results weren’t shown until I submitted?
---
Well, they haven't actually said it, but imho it's because they can see the fundamental problem with the gamemode that everyone is missing: people getting bored of other people. I mean, for it to actually work, you'd have to create an unchangeable group at the moment of account creation and then, because this is osrs we're talking about, stick together for years. Between internal drama and people quitting it would start to suck really quick. This also means that random matching is a terrible idea, so you have to have an established group of friends interested in doing it. In this autistic game. Gl.
---
You could go around that by letting you edit the group, but that comes with a huge set of its own problems. If the game allows you to let the chad with tbow and full justiciar join your ironman group at any time, that kinda defeats the purpose
---
Thanks haha

Why are people downvoting this? He's rightyou know.

He can fish to 76 and catch a raw shark. Dagannoths in the lighthouse drop harpoons. He did not need to leave his area. I don't understand why he did two quests instead of that - laziness?

That's why it definetely needs a spot here
---
Do you know that player 'Pink Crow' because I've seen him in my clan
---
Absolutely. Either you’re so gifted at the game that your play-style alone gets you viewers (Woox), or you have a fun personality and involve your viewers into your stream. I’d say a majority fall in that latter category.

I just think it's annoying to be killed doing things in rag. On the other hand it's hella fun to have that extra risk when doing things like getting odium/malediction, dpick, or revs. I fully understand killing people bossing or skilling as you stand to gain a lot if you're lucky. 
---
i was bored and felt like doing mole, randomly got the pet after about 10 kills. got the fuck out and thought i'd test my luck at zulrah and got the pet after my first kill of the night.
---
Rejected!
---
I play both and I think I might just be desensitized, but I don't think the community is that bad on either. CSGO comms are generally reasonably good for me (MG2-MGEish) no one is a dick in voice, league is generally worse but even then the toxic people have the sense to type shit that'll get em banned. Anecdotal evidence sucks, but I remember things so much worse for both games years back.

Ice barrage is more dps overall, Fire surge hits 24, 36 with tome of fire, but even +6 is not enough when you have to entangle every 3 hits, thats 77 damage (5, 36, 36) vs 90 of just barraging
---
What do you see as established here that should be followed? Not that I want to sway your vote or anything just curious.
---
If you have a spare mil, or even less, buy a tome of fire, and equip that with death runes and a mystic staff of air. I use that all the time since I’ve been doing barrows, and My magic level was lower than 62 when I started.

This subreddit has me fucked me up so bad, I'm looking for shit that shouldn't be in a barrows run.
---
So the logic is I'll always be at a disadvantage in the wildy because people abuse the combat level system to keep their levels low while being able to hit end game damages? Pures shouldn't exist.
---
That would be pretty neat. I have no idea how that affects the game balance though. Very few weapons have prayer bonus, I'd imagine Jagex doesn't want there to be too much prayer bonus in the game.

I made it to wave 57! Ran out of restores so then prayer and took 2 mage hits and that's all she wrote. 57 for my first time ever (also im mobile only) was not a bad run! I will be going back next week with 75 range and 70 defense! Thank you
---
Wow great argument, didn't think of it that way.
---
Thinking like a real pker there - I like it.
---
Blizzard is being choked to fucking death by it's immature, greedy ass parent company.
---
Most genuine noobs don't even vote in polls. Also it creates an obvious conflict of interest if only people who have access to a particular item can choose whether it gets buffed or not. Clearly if you have an item you're not going to vote to make it worse.
---
You look about as much of a unit as him
---
only if ur on pvp world dieing being kicked out of house
---
Speaking from personal experience playing at high rating and quitting over a year ago:
---
The number one reason I quit was that there was such a slow balance change cycle and a "casual" focus to balance changes. Removing power from high skillcap heroes like McCree and buffing the casual community's favorites (Mercy/Junkrat/DVa) often in a *blizzard way(tm)* meaning they were brokenly strong for a long while afterwards. 
---
Mercy (the undeniably easiest healer to play) and Junkrat (the undeniably easiest dps to play) were buffed to a state where you *had* to have them on your team in 4 out of 5 maps/game modes. And they stayed that way with only minor tweaks for over half a year, meaning that the meta completely revolved around them for that period of time. I'm not saying they were the easiest because of salt either, it's just that the skill floor (as opposed to skill ceiling) of them was so low.
---
If you compared Mercy at her prime vs Ana at her prime, the contrast is huge. Sure, Ana could solo heal a team of tanks if it was a good player, but she had some huge drawbacks compared to mercy.
---
Ana has no true escapes (Mercy can fly away to almost any teammate within sight). Ana's only "defensive" ability is her sleep, which has a decent cast time and is a slow projectile. 
---
I don't remember how many shots Ana had per magazine in s2, but Mercy didn't need to reload **ever**. She could have literally 100% uptime on her healing. Not to mention that Ana's heals are shots you need to aim and hit (with some fair bit of aim assist if scoped in to be fair), while Mercy can literally lock her beam on a target and turn 180 degrees away from it and still be healing at full potential. 
---
Ana's ultimate could be a fight winning ultimate if you used it in combination with the right teammate (most often Rein, Genji or Reaper, depending on how long into her reign we are talking about) but even then, you had to use someone else to set it up with and it was easily to see it coming and a well-timed hook or flashbang could stop it right in its tracks. Mercys ultimate made her chain heal teammates, fly at will (**at incredible speeds btw**, which made it nearly impossible to kill as even McCree or Widowmaker), regenerate hp stupidly fast (believe it was like 40 hp/s or something like that), she could also instantly rez someone when she popped the ult and with the increased CDR while in ult recharge another rez before it ended. And if everyone was full hp? Just turn on the chain damage boost and give your team +30% damage. A mercy ult at the start of an engage could often mean a won fight if the opponents didn't pop some big ults. 
---
And that's not even going into the bad map/game design choices with forcing 2CP being a thing, when literally no one enjoyed those 25m+ maps which more often than not ended in a tie or a steamroll. 
---
I agree with the team aspect. I only play overwatch with my friends. If you have a good group, it’s an amazing game. I haven’t played solo online in months.
---
?
---
How did you turn your 99 HP upside down?
---
When official game mode?
---
But there are still hundreds of people that full time steam successfully, so his statement is valid.
---
DW bro she look basic af
---
Well that still doesn't change anything.
---
Nice 
---
Why though
---
I don't particularly give a shit about that, I just don't want to use/farm/buy scales, like I said. 
---
I’m assuming you’re using retarded as a way to deflect the fact that you couldn’t come up with an actual adult response, it’s okay little beta guppy jr smith.. you’ll learn someday&lt;3
---
You played professionally after only 100 hours of playing Overwatch?
---
I think you have a very broken understanding of the report system. When you report someone, it does nothing except flag jagex to take a look at that account. You could walk around reporting literally everyone, and noone would get banned unless they actually were botting.
---
they arent getting muted, because they are bots. they get deleted from the game. mutes only happen for chat related reports. 
---
P.S. anyone with a completely random username thats lvl 3 is a bot.
---
Twitch is not an accurate description of a games popularity. Otherwise SC2, OW, Diablo 3, WoW, OSRS, RS3, TF2, Eve Online are all completely dead games that nobody plays. When in reality theres still thousands on SC2, Tens of thousands on OW, Basically everyone plays diablo 3 at some point, WoW hit its all time high at 1 million concurrent subscriptions, OSRS Peaked at what 70k? players at one point, But on twitch it still sits at like 5k viewers. Tf2 silently sitting there with a 56,000 concurrent playerbase and nobody notices. Last but not least, Eve, With un-count-able numbers but is a game *everyone* knows about, i am unsure of its playercount. 
---
Do we see really any of these hit the top5 or top10 on a regular basis? Nope. Why? Because the game isn't livestream friendly &amp; the personalities on twitch change alll the time, None of them actually stay on one game when they reap big viewerships. Thanks sponsorships. 
---
I voted no because the only genuine reason why you'd vote yes is to recolor your chaps. You're kidding yourself if you think pures were going to start using those regularly, they're worth 10x more than the black ones.
---
no, i'm saying the time played is irrelevant to how watchable OWL is.
---
This is why i bot
---
Already have. It was the first thing I did.
---
Yes
---
If you have 5 friends you could cut that down to 5 times a day each
---
If the stolen items would stay on the pc even after it respawns im sure some crazy people would die to them intentionally in max gear to gear them permanently
---
I am doing a lvl 3 iron man skiller, best ways to get 77 rc and 34 farming? Barely any teleports available and no energy pots I guess
---
Battlestaves with Varrock Hard
---
I think you underestimate pures risking as little as possible.
---
Winter 2017 btw
---
Its mostly a gag lol
---
Basically same than watching dbz.
---
I'm using retarded as stupid ;)
---
Ya I'm going to have to click no on this mediocre drama
---
Exactly this, you're just an easy prey and i fully agree eith him killing you because he can.
---
thanks for the info guess ill leave it be.
---
Group Ironman confirmed for 2019
---
No it was just for the event lasted the night. Never gonna be worn again probably just in some closet for memorys.
---
But ironman mode wasn't broken
---
Pkers are fucking orcs dwelling in dark caverns. They feed on life, hope, and humanity. Through the history of gileanor the human race has not been able to contact their leader successfully. All the ambassadors we sent were never seen again. Their skulls scattered across the vast wilderness. A few centuries ago, King Chadrick IV ordered a trench to be dug, one that divided our lands. Many have crossed it, very few have returned. 
---
Actually a valid reason.
---
Wouldn’t it be more distracting if they were united? That way they would have to click more.
---
Lol I’m high and trying to act smart lmfao, all love for you! Just don’t desire to kill someone who finally gets wildly pet hahaha
---
The warriors guild. Im not in one cuz I have respect for myself.
---
Meet PollResultsStillNotHidden, my Land of the Lost only UIM
---
what if they just block u 
---
I like this
---
Its against the rule and ill report u if u say that again
---
Or they do and if they join the world has 2001/2000 players
---
Both sides are little children throwing a temper tandrum. 
---
How does it negatively affect you though if pures got the option to use god chaps for fashion/risk fight purposes? 
---
The F2P people need it more than members lmao
---
I pked once. it was quite exhilarating even though I'm very bad. I honestly recommend people to at least try it out before they go "PKERS R DUM LOL SPADES" lol
---
I got KBD pet at 24
---
It's more about personality, at least for me. If someone is funny then I don't mind having them on while I play but I'm not going to watch a stream just focused on game play.
---
Ds2 not done yet, so no vorkath. Haven’t learned Zulrah. 
---
Are there any profitable ways to train crafting other than like flax? I’m 56 currently
---
Would that be considered PvR? (player vs resource)
---
They can vastly overshadow each other though. You can bring a shitty root + teleblock or you can bring freeze + high damage. The fact that its shitty is a meaningful drawback to having TB.
---
lol cry, I vote no on literally everything even if I want it. it's a counterbalance and more people should do it. If it's good enough for the game it will pass without my yes vote. Skipping votes is stupid. The value of a no vote is worth casting a no vote.
---
Blast furnace
---
Steel or mith?:)
---
Clanning usually means clan vs clan
---
Can Jmods or Pmods join a full server?
---
If they do, will it kick someone off or will it be 2001/2000 players on the world
---
i won 3m off a Dice bot just the other week, and i wasn't part of a team or whatever. just wanted to give it a shot as i ran past. I don't disagree with you completely. I'm just saying that sometimes they can be legit within reason
---
Polling is just a game mechanic. People that whine because something they wanted didn't pass are babies.
---
Humour H
---
You must have said some wild shit for you to get perm muted
---
Lmao I don’t even play anymore my car broke and this shit went down while it was broken. I’m about to buy a Tesla, I guess I’ll go cry in that at your attempt to make me feel “bad”. 😂😂😂👌 while you sit in the bedroom mummy supplies you.

7 vs 20 second freeze is ridiculous, ice barrage can be camped hitting 40+ and freezing, also in a wildy situation teams have a separate tber with d scim to get a full tb, there very low chance of killing someone on a half, also a fire surge, tb and entangle setup needs 7 runes in your inv vs ice barrage at 3, meaning that someone on standards has 4 less brews. 
---
Thanks alot, already got full void, bought trident for Barrows already.
---
I think i will go with RCB and diamond bolts for zulrah then. 
---
Occult and inf boots before purchasing ahrims? 
---
Iirc zulrah has spawns? Do people recoil theese? 
---
33 min old reddit account? Ok
---
Yeah, you'll be back in a week or two, get this off your chest to make yourself feel better and then come back alright?
---
Good  boy.
---
Almost like you can Google the rest
---
Well maybe not gnomes or elves, else they'd be represented as well as the others, and they wouldn't be at war either...
---
Obviously.
---
Given that they're the exact same stats as black d'hide, except the +1 prayer, it only makes sense the level requirement be the same.
---
Dude what kind of comparison is that? Who cares if people don't like pking, but if you don't participate in content don't dedicate yourself to ruining it for the people who do participate. please keep replying to posts on this subject. If mods see it it's probably the best chance to make them realize these updates should be put in under integrity. 
---
You kinda just wonder what happened to them. Like did they die?
---
How is it broken lmao?
---
Provide video proof. If this is how he acknowledges fans it’s truly disgusting. Also pretty sure this is his job. Judging by how many subs he has I doubt he makes more then a full time minimum wage employee.
---
I feel like that’s what’s happening to me haha. I mean you suggested I play a different game because we have different opinions on a topic (now that feels toxic). You called me immature for feeling entitled, but I’m not totally sure what in the post made you feel that way. I felt bad so I apologized, and you doubled down calling me toxic 👀
---
I don’t think this is going anywhere so I hope we can both just enjoy the game! Peace man
---
Because their hatred for pures is so great that they will vote no on a cosmetics update for pures which would take less than 30 seconds to implement.
---
Because in order to damage someone well and full tb them a team needs a dedicated tber, if not 2 or 3 of them incase the scim misses, entangle being buffed would encourage solo and 1v1 pking in single 
---
It'd be nice if a person could join each team mid match simultaneously.
---
Looks really fake, just by the crop of “Lake”
---
please max this guy
---
Nice
---
I disagree. The Hespori boss isn't difficult to fight at all. As such if you can't defeat him then that's your problem. 
---
The Anima seeds are in a good place right now and making them easier access would drive the prices for Seeds up and Herbs down. 
---
I do see where you're coming from though as my skiller alt has to do without some content but you don't see me crying on Reddit. Just be thankful you can buy the Bucketless Compost Bucket I would've preferred that to be untradable too.
---
&gt;Provides no evidence  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Flames anyone who doesn't believe in credibility of this post
---
Smh osrs players are toxic
---
Good job on changing the title.
---
Probably
---
Reading comprehension is a nice skill to work on in your free time. :)
---
This ignored the question
---
barrows brothers boss task 
---
Maybe recoil or duel rings? Could take more time. Im not sure check the GE
---
How many phishing streams were up tho
---
you pressed over some icons that ur fat fingers cant click? how about you actually PRACTICE an build muscle memory? also 9/10 times its the pvmer that starts with the toxic shit pkers just get the last word, you think pkers actually give 2 fks if they kill you for a clue? no, dont be so soft
---
What in the fuck are all these drop rates people are posting, I thought this was some 1/128 shit
---
boss task for barrows brothers :)
---
Try 700 hours and i still dunno wats going on
---
Ah okay, thanks. One more question: is the message that says you would have been followed highlighted in chat the same way that it is if you get a pet to actually follow you or sneak into your backpack? In every screenshot I have seen of that chat message, it appears as plain black text. 
---
Well, "weak" in damage perhaps
---
Melee and ranged do not offer utility however 
---
Do you think there's enough wiggle room for them to insert lore into these kingdoms' relations and possible conflicts in osrs? I don't know how much coordination there is between the osrs devs and rs3 devs as far as overlap goes. Obviously osrs has branched off, having added Zeah for starters...
---
The only reason that you think this is the case is because you're a non-PKer, and the only time you're exposed to PvP is when you're attacked while you're PvMing or skilling in the Wilderness. I attack anybody I want to in the Wilderness whether they're a PKer or not. Get good.
---
Why would you bring a fury to mage arena lol
---
Fake 👀
---
Any chance we could have the inferno available on unrestricted worlds? I'd love to practice it, but in the real game the gear costs my entire bank so i don't have enough gp for supplies.
---
Feel free to join the clan chat 'Noobs Playin'.
---
It's a chill clan with low and high level players.
---
The clan is primarily US, but there are lots of Europeans too.
---
Dragon chainbody = lucky ?
---
It's almost like different people request different things. Like this dude could be asking for the Hydra plug-in and *not* complaining about ezscape. It's crazy.
---
You should use your butler to bank btw :). Way faster and more afk.
---
I remember like 8 years ago getting a double chest in dh helm &amp; karils top. Combined they were 13m back then.. quadroooopled my bank, was such a nice feeling.
---
Just get ibans staff and use that. You can do it just fine at your current level
---
Old name brotha haha
---
Put PvM poll booths behind the zuk shield
---
their? 
---
Most all lets plays and the like start with "whats up guys" across any game. 
---
I would reccomend mining irons at mining guild as it's 55-60k xp per hour and there's bank deposit literally 6 steps away from rocks. I made bank with this method.
---
They hold essence. You get them as a drop by abyssal monsters. There might be a way around having to kill them (gaining combat xp) but I dont know of it.
---
How do you guys keep up with the vast information in the game. I've played for years and every time someone recommends something I feel like I don't or can't remember it all. I'd love to play again, but I don't wanna be a member and waste my time and money just not enjoying content cause I don't know it's there.
---
Yeah, they still haven't optimized tablets for OSRS.  Not sure why they haven't done it yet.
---
Got a mining pet on my alt I rarely play at level 64 yaaayeet
---
Suggestion
---
Well yeah not everyone is gonna take part in group ironman or have friends to play with. That doesn't mean that a significant amount of players don't have real friends that they have known for years, and will know for years. People who have already been playing rs together for years, this is not uncommon, I'm sorry that doesn't apply to everyone. You'd probably be surprised at group iron's success if it ever comes out.
---
I did notice, that herb grow timing has changed but i didnt see anything in change log. Did anyone alse notice? The growth cycle isnt 0:00 0:20 and 0:40, but 0:05 0:25 and 0:45 now.
---
No, as the serp helm is better. It's why I'm looking forward to a blowpipe nerf, so I don't have to use it anymore. 
---
Go back and get it?
---
Slayer &amp; Zulrah tbh
---
Why forbid merching?
---
...her picture?
---
Protip, pkers also run when they're losing the fight.
---
This might sound strange to you, but if you want to get pk'd while pvm'ing less, you have to vote for updates that make it harder to escape. It's very hard to kill pkers because even if you find one, they'll likely just tele away if they're going to lose. This means if you want to pk people, you basically are forced to kill pvmers, as they have less chance of escaping.
---
If the delta difficulty is negligible then surely you have no problem with there being no difference at all, don't even make it slightly easier and only then you can have the same amount of points. 
---
OP is not an ironman, look at the screenshot lmfao
---
Sounds like it would do like no dmg.
---
29 bones and 58 hides from 30 dragons 🤔🤔🤔
---
What're you talking about, brainlet? Of course you kill players in wildy, I'm complaining about people being toxic while doing it.
---
Not crashing if you’re not there. If i reset and someone took my spot, it was annoying but i hopped seeing as if i saw a free spot i took it.
---
Konar drops table is a huge example
---
I have one in the bank with a magma recolour. Literally only gets used for fashionscape.
---
With Ranarr/Snapdragon seeds having such insane prices, this really would only affect ironmen
---
I thought we were doing a thing
---
It’s weird cuz I’ve been played since season 2 always diamond-plat. From what I remember, I’ve only really experienced extreme toxicity in league a few times and the games only last 30 minutes after which you don’t see that person again. Whereas in RuneScape some random guy will flame me hardcore at sand crabs and bring his main to kill crabs and follow me around for as long as I stay.  
---
Also the report system for league has improved a lot over the years and it has actually been very effective I feel. Osrs seems to have stayed the same in terms of toxicity though. 
---
Memes bruh!
---
if you wanted spell book filtering you're part of the problem and you're the reason we got this disgusting abomination
---
You were never richest in the game lol
---
Time to make that alt a main 
---
Go try it lol
---
Except OSRS if a fucking backup of a 2007 version of a 17 year old java game (cant really count classic). It has no right being anywhere near the top 100 yet there it is in the top 20.
---
Na no thing. You’re right. She does look basic af and most basic bitches take pictures exactly like hers. Or she has some fucked up nose.
---
Haha
---
The 2006scape private server was hugely popular when jagex decided to introduce the vote
---
No more gay events
---
&gt; Just because you don’t believe someone or someone doesn’t have evidence; and even if I was a flat out liar. Why would it make you so angry? I’m glad my problems affected your mood buddy; **you almost have symptoms of mania.** Also I’m flaming now because I choose to respond to negativity? 
---
I don't like people like you who ask community for sympthy for their "false" bans or mutes. By the way is one of symptoms of bipolar disorder not agreeing with OP?
---
&gt;I could personally care less if you believe anything I say; and it’s a fact that runescape is declining. That’s why membership is almost 3x the price, and btw I wouldn’t pay “11” dollars I was grandfathered in the 5.00 usd rate, only a moron would overpay for this LOL. 
---
Can you provide me source for that fact? Also just because you got banned suddenly membership is overpriced right?
---
&gt; And as far as “me willing the game to die” make a google search that runescape is dying; there’s thousands of people who agree with me.
---
That's called confirmation bias
---
&gt; But the game experience is definitely on the decline.
---
Unfortunetly yes
---
&gt; But if you think runescape is near where it was at its peak; 
---
Why would it have to have 250k players? This isn't RS2 if you aren't aware
---
Cabbage Cape &gt; Any 99 Cape
---
Ya forcing pvm content into pvp was just dumb overall of jagex
---
Those are some rough looking chicken breasts my friend.
---
When you make a meme version of a high upvote grossing post from a few weeks ago just to farm karma
---
Good? What's wrong with new obscure methods coming out every now and then. This is why pures were fun pre-eoc and over thought out on 2007. 
---
Made me hungry lol
---
Still weird to record a stranger, especially when they’re at work and can’t really do anything about it 
---
Byeeeeee
---
Jsyk their's a 7 day trial going on atm when you sign up through mobile which is easily enough time to earn a bond. Also, I havn't seen anyone mention this but I noticed the trial is bound to your google or apple account not your RS account, so on android especially it's super easy to make a new google acc quick no idea if this will get you banned or anything, but I've done it a couple times (you can just use a gift card or something to sign up then cancel right away too). Again, havn't seen anyone say anything about it.
---
Thats exactly what Im saying. OSRS being in the top 20 shows exactly how good it is. Old games tend not to do well against new blockbusters. You cant criticize it for only being in top 20 considering how well it's doing
---
The hypocrisy is astounding, for a guy affiliated with ROT you sure seem to afraid of a simple friendly duel. Maybe this is why he keeps slipping past your "expert team" which is actually just scamming noobs for their money and then ghosting them. I don't have ties to him, I just think it's messed up for you call for his ban when you yourself are the real harasser here. 
---
It was always 0:00,0:20,0:40 for me
---
Slayer masters are kinda like that, with cb reqs. But it's stupud. 
---
This will skew the results so much lol
---
Yeah im 1700 kills down with 1 trident and no 1/3k drop either
---
barrows, barrage slayer, bandos mage duos, kraken. Mage is fine as it is.
---
Raimbo, rambo's "special little brother
---
typing with a lisp to get kawaii points won't work with me, stop trying to get in my good graces. Everyone on this subreddit can see plain as day that you threatened that man's mother irl and are actively harassing him because he keeps owning you
---
Bro i killed rune drags with you yesterday, you grabbed my 2 runite ores whilst i was focusing on my main. 
---
Ironman at ge is bs, I use the bank all the time on my iron man 
---
I think its seen as a kids game, despite no longer being as such
---
Fitstly, don't use eagle eye or range attack prayers. Waste of resources. Only use steel skin and eagle eye when you have the Mage and Ranger. 
---
Secondly, learn to lure around Italy rock. Usually one of the main ones  (melee/mage/range) get trapped north. The best thing is to hide behind one side of Italy (closest to the entrance),  and see which one gets trapped first. If it's the ranger on mage/range for example, then you know its the Mager coming. As you only want to kill one at a time, You simply run South to the wall by the entrance And that baits the Mager to Italy rock, to a position where you can attack the Mager with the crossbow without the ranger attacking you.
---
All these people saying "get blowpipe" - means nothing if you can't bait properly, as blowpipe has less range than the Karils crossbow. 
---
Yeah, do belive slayer is pretty good money for me. 
---
What to earn enough for B-Ring, Fury, slayer helm and Whip before starting again:)!
---
Might do the 99, wanted slayer cape first tought 😅
---
Just rwt with your new job man
---
Runecrafting, easily atleast 1m gp/hour at 99 /s
---
Don’t edge pk for profit unless you know what you’re doing. If you have a friend why not go to revs, Chins, lava drags? A month of afk training at sand crabs can get you to 85 str/range/mage which is perfect for beginner pking. You will lose money at first, but as soon as you can hold your own the money will start rolling in.
---
Ironic that the quest cape also happens to be the best method of getting to karambwans
---
99 rc u mean:)? What will be most profitable now? Single nats? 
---
Thanks alot:)! Will take a look into it
---
I'd tell you that you guys just tell yourselves that and you've got a nice little hivemind to reassure each other.
---
A sign that you should do runecrafting.
---
AKA the boss's way of telling you to commit toaster bath.
---
I was a closet player all the way from like 12-17, just because I was one of the "cool" kids and  there was some kind of stigma playing a medieval fantasy mmo that wasn't wow, what was most funny is that a lot of other dudes from different years and on my rugby club were also closet players and we would sometimes hang out and stroke our e-penises and people just thought we were talking about partying and stuff, we actively avoided the more open and "nerdy" dudes (to be honest they were degenerates).
---
Blow my pipe
---
if it does nothing why do they want it so badly
---
The game being made easier lessens the competition both for PvP and PvM. It's just less noticable for PvM which is why PvMtards keep voting for powercreep and updates that basically just give them more loot without thinking if it makes the game better or worse.
---
If it makes no difference then I don't see why everyone's crying. Nobody would risk it, it would just make training slightly better. No.
---
The Java situation hasn’t changed at all. Most browsers have dropped the Java applet support, so you just have to download a client (most likely Java) to run the game (Java) with.
---
I've never seen it written as well as you ever did. Thanks you.
---
The only people you can really kill in deep wild w the stand spellbook is pvmers, and buffing it would make it viable vs pvpers and therefore less pures would attack pvmers. Not hard to understand lol
---
No he means Oracle

Refunding his wealth is literally giving them a bad rep, your logic makes no sense. Them refunding his gold is them admitting they fucked up.

Welcome to RuneScape

All that’s missing is rainbow boots from SOS and you got yourself a full fledged r/cutenoob

Lol
---
People out here mass voting no as “they shouldn’t remove defence levels from armour” as they don’t know pures can wear black dhide and you’re saying this?
---
it is just pressing Q, ofcause you dont know because you are a retard who played less than 100 hours and never played other games like quake, TF2 or any other where movement is key.
---
also its so fucking rock paper scissors that i want to neck rope myself at the end of the match. 
---
Lets say you go widowmaker and you pick 1 person, lets say genji.
---
so mercy flies over and revives him. the game is still a steelmate.
---
you did something skillfull and you are getting punished for it. fuck overwatch honestly. also the games are chaotic if you want to watch them, you are still confused what the fuck is happening.
---
In TF2 you lets say bomb the demo, you kill him. there is no bullshit that can bring him back unless you have a medic with uber, then maybe you can do something. the game doesnt reward you for just pressing a shitty button like overwatch does.
---
but ofcause im a idiot, fuck off
---
no but it brings up a fair point
---
The same people who got the game killed were nerds who wanted an easy game with low risk and high reward( the kids dying about going to a pvp zone)
---
It’s expected tho, the community in this game is worse than league or csgo 
---
Motherload boi
---
That’s untrue first ever play through of DS2 I got invaded and killed repeatedly I just wanted to finish the 3rd from last boss. I didn’t want that but it happened, it’s part of the game.
---
I did want Summons (non npc) and to get those I had to take the risk of being invaded.
---
Better rewards in a more dangerous area? No way, that doesn’t sound like a standard game mechanic at all...
---
Also they do lock some content behind the pvp in the form of covenant rewards, trust me I sweated it out to earn most. 
---
Ye that's right you gotta play the whole season. Are you thinking of like 2-3 day competitions?
---
good4jesus!
---
Literally
---
I’m upvoting you to counter your negative votes...you’re actually not doing anything wrong by playing the game...
---
I don't have any osrs friends. Double fat F
---
i thought u cant alch pets jagex stops u
---
&gt;New wilderness weapons
---
theyre pvm items you fucking mongrel
---
🤔
---
its dead to me, i played it for a year. it has so many bullshit things like no movement skill aspects, its rock paper scissors the game. you cant play a select few heroes because you need to switch to the meta all the fucking time its so fucking damn annoying.
---
Watching OWL ?
---
so you are saying that watching chaos is fun, you cant make out what the fuck is happening half of the time. 
---
been using these worlds to practice bossing, its a fucking god send
---
Better than only getting bones!
---
Looking at you hellhounds! Lol
---
100% venom application with blow pipe is very underrated. It's op in gwd as you can tag the minions. It's also very powerful for slayer in places you cannot cannon such as catacombs. 
---
Just tag all the npcs in the area and afk with auto retal on. If you bring a weapon and helm switch the scale usage becomes ultra efficient for the damage you get from them. 
---

Any idea where the Xeric teleport will be? I could be blind and not see it on the map. 
---
You're either an idiot or just trolling.
---
Wow, now that’s lucky! Done prob 50 ish superiors. Still no heart..
---
Actually that could be a very interesting balance view instead of just flat nerf to range. Make people think more about what armour they wear to get the dps from them. 
---
Lmao, dont think so..
---
I’d rather earn it myself. My fault auth was off and bankpin was not on.
---
For me it's kinda all or nothing; when I go for a run I do them all, but on a flipside I often feel lazy thinking about it and proceed doing something else entirely
---
Good job now everybody got their hopes up thinking they may be next to get a drop like that.
---
Not even full prospector what a noob
---
Just want to say huge shoutout to this guy, he actually trusted me and got payed back 4m. Not everyone is a scumbag folks

awwwwwww poor baby ;(

Same boat. My god his rant about the current state of BfA was on point.

Player that don't have the "teleport destination" option would just left-click "activate" as normal

Censor the special energy?
---
Just because someone is willing to hack your runescape account it does not mean they will hack your bank account too.
---
Source: I used to associate with runescape account hackers, they were not deep enough in it to be willing to hack bank accounts. 
---
How?
---
Did you use people search for it ? 
---
It's Scarce here
---
Nobody is making you use it now
---
Not the release of legacy servers, those are still in the works. I think that's just the release of the current expansion, Battle for Azeroth. It released in the middle of August.
---
Get out of my head
---
Ah, thank you!
---
Theres a recurring meme on the subreddit where if you don't censor all the information, including the useless ones, like the run energy or compass, you'll get hacked.
---
MOOOOOOOM, THERE'S A STRANGE FUCKING CAT STARING AT ME
---
Yeah, absolutely not. It wouldn’t decrease any of the pvm killing. Most pkers aren’t roaming deep wildy to look for 1v1s or 2v2s on most worlds. They’re hopping from spot to spot, world to world, looking for stray pvmers and skillers who likely won’t fight back at Revs, chins, resource area and other high risk areas. 
---
This would probably do nothing but incentivize MORE pvm killing, if anything. 
---
I personally love PKing with Flames and and toxic staff on my pure. But the reality of entangle is that even a semi competent brid will completely outclass you. It's absolutely tiring to have to do 2 fakies just to catch a full freeze, that does maximum 6 damage and lasts 15 seconds. While the asshole barraging me in chaps 3 times on prayer still gets a full 20 second freeze on me.
---
I honestly think the fairest update would be a 33% freeze reduction for casting on pray for all magic. Tangle down from 15 to 10, and barrage down from 20 to 13 or 14 seconds. It would encourage actually getting your magic switches down which half the time people don't even bother doing because magic is so underpowered. It would close the gap between ancients and standard, and probably keep all these whining PVMers happy too since they die more often to barrage then standard. 
---
Starting at hard clues you’re forced into the wilderness. Getting killed for a spade is annoying. 
---
Tithe farm looks tiny, can barely do 5 plot cycle
---
Perhaps if there was an all conclusive "mini game" achievement system, some sort of XP or item award.
---
Example: Play Castle Wars this week to earn X. Next week will be Shades of Morytania!
---
Instead of buffing/reworking the minigames just bring a little more attention to them.
---
It all depends on whether you get to high elo (d3+). Once there you will see truly degenerate, crazy people.
---
hey buddy, there's gonna be 3 MORE QoL polls this month. This one is for PvP. And technically, if you or anyone else would complain that this is just a buff to pures (though, tiny prayer, not any damage), it could also be made the case that your suggestion is just a buff to pvm kills/h.
---
Glorious, congrats
---
Damn man that’s unlucky, isn’t that the same drop rate as a cabbage?!
---
now thats what i call meta
---
Potentially, but it still doesn't answer the issue of how they did all of this without touching my emails? Or why Jagex isn't sending confirmation emails for when details such as these are changed. I filed an appeal anyway, but will see what, if anyhting comes of it.
---
Of course? It's inherently competitive when you're both trying to kill each other and survive. The fact that you decide to not fight back doesn't change that. If I go into a game of any FPS and refuse to shoot anyone, that doesn't make it any less competitive for them.

In the age of efficiencyscape, sadly some minigames are just inconveniences. 
---
&gt; There are hundreds of hcim players who have never even entered the wilderness and probably have a better account than you. 
---
I Abyss'd reguarly on my 1500 HCIM no problem, along with doing Crypt of the empty lord and ending up in deep wilderness. And even when I finally decided to delete the acc and getting killed in the wild, I had a really hard time even finding anyone to challenge me in full graceful lol.
---
The wilderness isn't really scary.
---
I think the bigger issue here is, while this is definitely obnoxious, I don’t think they’re actually breaking any rules. It’s not against the code of conduct to rag on PK worlds, so there isn’t really anything Jagex can do.
---
Like the one in rs3?
---
It's a shame that we live in the timeline where we got osrs back, but also live in the timeline where reddit exists so uninformed players can throw in their opinion.

This issue has been around for a long time so what you say is a point that has always been brought up, but I will say that if your sole purpose is to stop X player from doing something for no personal gain ingame and purely being done for the shits and gigs of making someone log off, is bannable.

The post was one sentence long and you didnt read it...

The inferno was deliberately left out to keep the Infernal cape prestigious. Saving the cost of supplies for this particular challenge is disproportionate to the fight caves and other bosses

I think you have to put your card info in, and you'll become members, and it just won't start charging your card until after the first week is up. ( As long as that acc has never had members) take it with a grain of salt but I'm 98.76% sure I'm right

what if there was some1 inside jagex leaking players data in exchange of a somewhat decent pay check? we will never know
---
She must've spent hours in a creative workshop class. 
---
I think a lot of the spite is the fact that a lot of these people are just absolutely shit at the game. These are the people that have a hard time completing Fight Caves or killing Zulrah. They have no understanding of the tick system and have the technical skills of a sloth, switching prayers is actually difficult for them.
---
They love their ezpz braindead content with literally 0 risk. Dying and losing items makes them feel bad and so the people hurting their poor little feelings are inherently bad people. 
---
Racist
---
I did read it but I told best solution to suck it up and mine iron
---
What's not true? That it's not a crap experience? That new players have to compete with robots just to mine ore or cut trees? That's the GE is filled with people spamming phishing links and gambling sites?
---
Ultimately the price of whatever item is negligible if the game isn't fun and bots make the game less fun
---
Yeah the likelihood of running into a pker is really small, and it normally wouldn’t be too difficult to escape either if you’re in singles
---
I think should remove these paths and mines, it would go a long ay into makign it look less cluttered:

~20-25 hours at max efficiency, ~35-60 hours you downgrade gear. If it takes you longer than 60 hours, you're probably an ultimate iron man or an idiot.

Also it's possible to do it in under 20 hours, but you'd have to be ridiculously fast every chest and have next to no downtime for banking.

If no bots, things like flax skyrocket again. Armor goes through the roof since people have to do crap like mine ess for cash and can never go PVM as they are too dirt poor to afford anything.

You can use a (good) password manager to auto-type your username and pass into the client; I do this regularly with OSRS with KeePassXC on Windows, Linux, Android, and MiniKeePass on iOS.

Lol it was a joke but yeah I just added a bank pin my self cause my friend got hacked and I'm positive hes not stupid enough to fall for one of those fishing sites so they hacked him thru some other way 
---
Will look into those in the future, thanks! 
---
I would say just remove all those things. They are op because they are in the wild and jagex is trying to get more people out there. 
---
I feel like I can assume your posture by how you type

😯 noice. I have a fucking ton of flax.

And the next few weeks

Found out that my info was breeched trough a site i had an account.

Their security was faulty and i had to pay for it.

It definitely wouldn't be a bad thing for Jagex to offer better clan support, you would be surprised how long a clan can keep some players interested in the game and how much more enjoyable the game can be.
---

---
I think they'd need to buff or add some special effect to 3rd age to make it useful. Not saying it doesnt have a use, but for armor that caps out at 65 defence or range or mage, it's way too spendy for what you're getting from it. It would be nice to see them actually try and utilize it way more than it is.
---
This looks so good! Cohesive and meaningful design in which players will actually be able to orient themselves with only the Minimap. 
---
I think the changes to the castle and those green stone paths are really underated and will prove to make the area feel much better to walk around. Before there were really far too many paths you couldn't tell where you were. Now there's just one path with exits to each faction. Nice.
---
Will be interesting to see where xeric's glade and khardest memoirs are located... allotment got moved quite far. The spirit tree patch looks pretty nice with the triple threat of minecart, allotment and WC guild.  
---
I really love the addition of more ruins and other flavour buildings. Hopefully they will be nice locations for the future zeah quest. 
---
The far bottom right does look a bit weird though. Just weirdly flat and empty. I feel like it needs an environmental reason to be empty, like some coastal cliffs with beach in between. Right now it's the greenest grass in the whole town, my boy hosidius would be on that.

K...
---
I was just curious since I've been doing zulrah but gets pretty repetitive, maybe ill switch it up a bit thank you (: 
---
For that rotation, you get auto pulled forward with Rapid on bp from position #1. I personally stay on Rapid near Zulrah and then once he starts spawning his 2 minions I go back to position #1 and switch to Long Range. After he spawns minions he shoots venom splats so I just time it. I stay at #1 for melee phase switching back to Rapid for maging. I never rely on #2 since it can get covered with venom anyway.
---
Also, that corner doesnt get venom splats for Jad phase so it doesn't matter much.
---
Run, you fool!

People have nostalgia for the wilderness ditch?

Please be careful when showing your account creation date. It's a heavily weighted recovery question and very valuable to anyone looking to steal your account.

When I was in school I didn’t care if people found out I played.
---
They played COD,Fifa etc. I played RuneScape
---
It’s just a game that I like.
---
If someone piped up I’d say that to them and they’d agree with me. If people try and bully you for playing a computer game, It’s usually them that are hiding something much much worse 
---
yeah, but players who play mid lane don’t get to prevent top laners from getting any updates 
---
There needs to be a bank chest near tithe farm like there is now

Same but typically only to say "btw" and "ge down for anyone else?" To amuse myself for a bit

I've done a few password changes recently and have gotten emails about every request, within a minute.
---
if you've done lunar diplomacy you can make money and train crafting at the same time with superglass make.
---
Flax and essence mining used to be stable and popular money makers in rs2. Again you're missing the point entirely, there's no merit to complaining about a game's economy if it comes from making the game less fun to play and trying to compete with automated cheating machines is not fun. It's a game not a stock market. 
---
This is the correct answer 
---
The password was never changed. They only changed the associated email address and put on an authentication pin. So even though I had the password, I couldn't login as I didn't have the app.
---
Definitely Konar. I'm lvl 60 slayer and made 1 mill in an hour doing troll tasks
---
The only thing i can possibly think of is that the last 4 digits of the debit card is wrong since i changed debit card somewhere in 2018 and im not sure if i used the new or the old one to make payment. But wouldn't they just email me and request additional info if 1 thing is wrong? Seems kinda weird that they just discard it in its entirety because of that.
---
Pking in the wilderness is an art form of autistic sadism.
---
I thought Ash mostly fixed the farming ticks?
---
I believe you are right. I believe every new account from any iOS or android download will receive 1 free week of members, including your card info, for free. Once that week is up, you're than charged for a month, unless you cancel it right as you get your free week. Then you just have a week to make cash for a bond or cave in and just use a card.
---
That message may just be to get you alerted about membership. Or it may just be faulty coding that is suppose to open a browser wether its safari or chrome. 
---
I just do it cause im poor and like free gp no shame
---
You think that's easier than standing on a specific tile and aggroing 2 healers only? No luring involved. The healers will automatically stand in a line of 3 and if you stand 1 tile north of the middle one you can aggro the 2 healers healing jad and they will get stuck behind the healers trying to get to jad. The only way fo fuck this up is by accidentally moving.
---
Legacy servers were announced at Blizzcon in 2017, and the playable beta was released at Blizzcon in 2018. The spike happened August 12th- August 18. The release of Battle for Azeroth was August 14th, so the spike was solely due to the release of Battle for Azeroth. The expansion has been widely regarded as absolutely garbage, and one of (if not *the*) worst expansions to go live. It had record short beta testing as far as WoW expansions go, and gutted almost every class in terms of design, and released several game systems that were clearly not well thought out or tested (in terms of systems that were tested like Azerite and class design, virtually all player feedback was ignored). It explains why the spike in searches was underwhelming and short-lived.
---
I thought it was a stupid idea but I don’t care if someone has the option to do it. So I just skipped the question

Kill all 6 brothers in crypts and tunnel to get best chance at barrow equipment.
---
Get 86% (2 skele, 1 worm) or 88% (3 skeles) TOTAL for best runes potential. Getting less than 100% will not affect barrow equipment chance.
---
My rng is also absolute shit. 1600kc vorkath with only a draconian drop

Never been a pker but I love the wilderness. I like the idea that I might actually get killed when going out there and there may be nothing I can do about it. 
---
&gt;20 people spec trading with claws and dbows cant out dps a prepared player in a 5min tb.
---
Those sound like really shite PK'ers considering:
---
&gt;Mantas are 7.333' hp a tick
---
So Manta-brew every 3 ticks would be what 38hp/3t = 12.667hp a tick
---
&gt;Max gear is 6.25hp/tick with 100% acc
---
So 20 maxed players is 125hp/tick
---
So your 20 people spec trading are only achieving about 10% of their DPS for the guy to outheal them.
---
That's not even considering inventory space limitations of someone tanking 20 players.
---
Diaries, bossing, slayer 
---
Like I said, I do not think there should be bots, just stating that in some way, they help out players. More so the people who dont have much time to play every day. 
---
Na i managed to get a free week on my account when mobile released and it’s had years worth of membership.
---
August was a big month for WoW 
---
ah he added the name to the title, good work, not sure why i was downvoted tho
---
&gt;There are also specific places to do pvm, but you chose to go to the wilderness where you could be attacked.
---
If I am assigned green dragons as a slayer task, I am forced to PvM in the wilderness. If I want to ever train runecrafting, it's all but mandatory to traverse a small part of the wilderness to get to the Abyss for pouches and pouch repair. Hell, there are plenty of quests that need you to do things in the wilderness (Wanted!, Dragon Slayer if you're f2p).
---
I didn't *choose* to get attacked randomly at dragons, it happened because I had to be there. And as an Ironwoman I can't even really fight back. That sucks. 
---
Sometimes, the game just tells you you should spend time in the Wilderness, and imo it's disingenuous to suggest that's not the case. 
---
It's a real shame it's not going to pass. Hopefully can be revisited next year
---
&gt; But wouldn't they just email me and request additional info if 1 thing is wrong? Seems kinda weird that they just discard it in its entirety because of that.
---
The only reason I can think of why they don't do this is that it'd make it easier for hijackers. If they know specifically what question they don't have a correct answer to, they can dig to find that specific answer and not be concerned further with the other questions they know are right.
---
I have a group of of like 4 other people and we all want to do group IM together
---
That’s fair, but I don’t know why that’s a negative. Mid level slayers get a good money boost (or xp if they use cannon) and ironmen get a drop that saves them hours of grinding. Seems like a win alround
---
Empty tridents are like 50k so no big deal really.
---
That seems like a huge oversight that just got brushed under the rug tbh
---
You will also wonder why the wilderness is dying and how you need really good ideas for wilderness rejuvenation version 32 but refuse to reduce the barrier to entry for pvp even a fucking tiny bit.  
---
P.s. you can auto click 1 tick switches and barrage with virtually 0 risk of ever being banned
---
Why should we reward players who play less by making everyone else's experience worse? This is still a daft opinion. 
---
Hogman10! Bloodspilla0!
---
 exactly
---
dude straight up said “it makes playing as a pure better. No.” what a spiteful fuck lmao

doesn't seem to be the case. im west coast and my pings look normal.

Yea w.e, enjoy

I'll take a dead wilderness over a wilderness where bridding is as easy as venge pking

---
It’s not bannable because they can’t prove that that’s the person’s intent. You can’t ban a person for the reason they’re doing something; it becomes your word against there’s. You can only fairly ban someone based on the actual action they take within the game, and that could be justified with any excuse from “I wanted to try a new build and it’s difficult” to “we’re trying to dominate this world and we’re ragging people who are in our clan.” It’s impossible to prove it’s because they’re trying to get you to quit and, to be quite honest, I don’t think that’s the reason they do it either.
---
+1 prayer bonus is going to negatively impact you? 
---
Increase the speed by 1 tick as well
---
You still havent really told me how it makes your experience worse? Realistically bots hurt ironmen more than real accounts, but here I am not really caring. 
---
I tried this and the results were the opposite? 
---
Regardless of its predecessors current status, Old school runescape by definition is a new game.
---
he sounds like someone who isn’t good at spamming food and running away from pkers, let alone actual pking

I was very misinformed on the whole thing, I'm sorry, that was stupid.

Nobody cares about your karma whoring ass, though

Endless loop farm runs are almost a thing for me atm(I farm everything I need pet pls jagex 21m farm xp no pet) if they add much more Farming shit I’ll be playing farm simulator.

Worked like a dream, thank you!
---
So does barrows eventually, they're good together though. I've done about 1k chests, make sure you've got Mory Hard diaries, then all you need is your best ranged gear then in this order obtain: Trident, Occult, Imbued God Cape, Tormented Brace for your melee bros and Karil.
---
It's easy to get 5 minute chests at like 75k a chest, but after around 4 minute runs you start needing expensive items like the torm brace, a swamp trident, like an ornate rejuve pool which saves you about 20 secs a run.
---
I've about 500 hours in overwatch whereas you sound like you played it for 20 minutes lol go back to tf2 and quake if you think they're so much better.
---
Overwatch is a team game based around teamwork and using all 6 players so if you're playing widow and can only kill one genji(which let's face it that's probably where your skill levels at) that's your problem. Don't blame the game cos you arent good enough to kill the mercy who's standing still reading him. 
---
I doubt teamwork is your strength anyway based on how you talk like a toxic 12 year old lmao

I used to play during 5th grade up until 7th grade and hadn't played since, but was still ashamed of anyone finding out. Couple of months ago, my fiancé and I were casually talking about childhood things and he happened to mention the game, which I had no idea he had previously played and wouldn't have taken him for the type to considering he was pretty popular himself at his high school. Since that day, we both decided to rejoin it and have been playing ever since. We're both in grad school and found out some of our classmates STILL play this game too. 
---
Possibly the worst advice I've ever seen haha
---
I've actually never played WoW and I still watch him play the game. I don't know what's happening but he makes it entertaining.
---
16 no bucket here
---
Well said
---
i always say that too
---
Brilliant art.
---
BA is actually fun though
---
No idea, could well have done.
---
From herb run to herb lap!
---
Achievement Diary Cape is your next big goal.
---
Its the wilderness you pker cry baby. 
---
For each completion of the mini game in the spotlight week you get a package of some sort which can give you items (seeds, logs, etc) and a very low chance of an untradeable like maybe a pet or cape relating to the mini game ?
---
Alright enjoy your content dying then.
---
what even is this comment
---
He probably didn't glance over his watch, thats why he over watched overwatch 
---
I'd expect a different continent to use a different building style.
---
So, this is how liberty dies... With thunderous applause.
---
Which rsps is this?
---
Because it's not fun to compete with non-social robots in an mmo and damage the long term integrity of the game? let's not forget that the purpose of these things is to rwt, which is what brought about the removal of free trade and the wilderness.
---
Blocked that task, fuck hellhounds
---
a comment
---
thats... actually pretty clever. support!
---
hidden pool or the equivalent of it. Dota 2 has the same thing. If youre overly chatty or flamer youre one of the two types, youre either terrible player as far as skill goes or youre extremely good but on a short fuse. Either way its not worth playing competitive until youre back in good standing.. like 9500 pts out of 10k. Valve says they put same people together like abandoners with abandoners, flamers with flamers, but i found that its false they dont differentiate anything. If you happen to abandon 2-3 games in a week and its not your fault your score drops to someone who flames and then youre pretty much in perpetual hell which makes even a calmest person flip out so much that you cant dig  yourself out of it short of muting all game for like 200 games.
---
Still technically PvE?
---
fun fact: a grand total of nobody will pk with larger icons. people just wanted it for easyscape shown by how as soon as it passed everyone was clamouring for it to be introduced everywhere other than pvp lol
---
Wake up Mr West
---
Lol that retard thinks pures should have limitations!!!!!
---
Youre both being assholes
---
So? Why are you insecure 
---
I felt the issue was more large empty buildings. I am thinking more about empty open areas like in hunter. 
---
Staying true to your name i see, good job finding that!
---
I think this fits in better with the model of other cities like Fally or varrock. 
---
Hey, this happened to me, too. Someone changed the "registered email" to their own (when the account was inactive), so when mobile came out I got back on that account. I got the free trial, and that sent the other dude an email. They changed my password and strung flax for a day. I didn't have shit for items, so I came out with more gold when I got the account back, but I'm still worried this could happen again. 11 dollars, yada yada.
---
No u
---
No you both
---
It's like he didn't even pay attention to the cook in the tutorial smh
---
Summoning maybe
---
pking who though? theres nobody at &lt;20 wildy except for clue scrolls and runecrafters who cant protect mage anyway
---
It happens to me alot where im just at work or doing some research and i catch myself adding osrs to the searches
---
A lot of people are saying quest- I agree! But also get your agility up to level 30-40 before you start questing, this will double your run recovery! Make questing a lot faster. 
---
Clue boxes are what, 20k?
---
fuck off posting the same thing just because you cant insta spec
---
&gt;theres nobody at &lt;20 wildy except for clue scrolls and runecrafters
---
if you don't pk why bother commenting about it.
---
Also a shit metric, CSGO can have 500k people online and still be 15k viewers. Repetive games are boring to watch all the time...
---
Tbf GreekGodX was playing it. Idk if it was at this point 
---
The OSRS search term was even bigger
---
this seems insanely op
---
tick manipulation master race
---
Use a cannon, no hp exp
---
No, as it is currently makes it so that standard spell book can ONLY be used to collect spades. The 15 second freeze is a massive difference, because as I said catching a freeze is the most important thing in bridding. It lets you step under, use obstacles and fake/use melee. It would actually make standard spellbook viable for solo bridding.
---
Definitely not arguable that its equally their fault. It would be nice if they had notifications for these types of things, but it's also 100% your fault. 
---
Then we're in agreement. All I'm saying is pking helpless targets is lamer than any skilling
---
Lies.
---
I want Dr Rick Marshall as a pet
---
why not give me an example of how it is a good idea since I haven't vote on it yet.
---
might be a bit different right now though. There are guilds currently working on the Mythic world first race which attracts a shitload of viewers.
---
The same way the world first Inferno race was attracting extra viewers for OSRS
---
Seriously. It's not like they're luring or scamming people. They're literally performing their JaGeX-intended role in the game. PKers (including those who just kill people for fun) are an essential part of the health of the game.
---
Baby mole 51kc, hello??
---
People do risk fights all the time, by voting no you're basically voting no to clue scroll rewards being worth more because you think prayer bonus is relevant.
---
I've had mostly good experiences with the OSRS community tbh. I haven't really seen the toxic players much.
---
Big oof
---
I've been using RuneLite since March of 2018 and haven't been banned/hacked/etc. It's safe just make sure you get it from https://runelite.net/
---
[truth](https://youtu.be/KAIQ68snVMw)
---
Yo, wtf. This was posted to a runescape facebook page i'm a mod to and I posted it 1 minute after it was posted, this was definitely the first.
---
he did test different variations of the names of both names, wow was the only thing that was above any version of runescape but since wow is also an actual word it doesn't really tell us much
---
would you honestly use the standard over ancients with this change though? You still have way less supplies so lose the long fights
---
Had 3 sires, first 58, 2nd 83 and 3rd 108.
---
All were bludg parts
---
Will you keep it on the HC?
---
for real, you will never know gaming in comfort until you get snacks and beers dropped off on the desk. of course, my setup is basically in my kitchen, which also leads to the homies griefing when they have to overhear the pots and pans smacking around but ehhh, WERF.
---
They have security measures to prevent this from happening. You just chose not to use use them.
---
Not disputing that it's also my fault but to not have these basic security features in 2019 is damn right shameful. That being said, people are still being hacked through this method despite having the auth app. 
---
Meme
---
It's like a chore than you have to do several times a day and it just feels tedious. I think I would prefer to not have a new patch too
---
Because you’re fucking stupid lol
---
Chaps and Vambs are already 1 defence, making a cosmetic item with identical stats 1 def isn’t game breaking 
---
Eventually Jagex will stop asking for opinions on pvp changes and implement them anyway if people keep dicking around.

Get 99 fm at WT. This will land you quite some capital seeing as you have decent skilling stats. After that, buy some decent gear and go bossing. Once u land ur first big boy drop you dont wanna stop. I'd say go demonics, try some vorkath but above all else, keep it varied. That keeps it fun, plus you dont really feel like ur grinding out one specific item. 
---
Also, have fun =D
---
Welp GF hardcore was good knowing you fam ty for 3a bow 
---
That would be me.
---
I have slaved in order to obtain maximum farm run efficiency. I've completed all of the quests that gave a patch as  a reward and make it a point to hit a minimum of five herb runs a day and utilize all 9 patches.
---
Coupled with Miscellania, those two are my main source of in-game income. With the Construction cape, a full herb run takes me on average 13 minutes to complete if I'm not trying to perfect tick everything.
---
Farming is low-key my favorite skill to train. It's so passive and brings in a hefty amount of cash. I openly welcome any more herb patches JaGeX wants to toss my way! 
---
I voted no because the boss is already easy and shots out tons of gp in the form of drops. It doesn't need to be made easier in any way. 
---
Why would they remove a mechanic that punishes you for a mistake?
---
Why the fuck do you want a game that you don't have to interact with?
---
Spade collecting and space pking literally isn't a thing 
---
It's a concept construed by salty PvMers to belittle PKers and enforce an "us vs them" mentality.
---
Why would i lie
---
Now we just spam ping to tilt people 
---
This is an odd take imo because it applies to almost every single skill. Why does obby maul require 1 atk, why can you hold rune crossbow without 40 atk. why do staffs require 1 atk/strength. Why can you mine certain ores with 1 mining, etc. It's not as if there are any 1 defense armors that are actually really good
---
Private servers make the server software from scratch, so they don't have to deal with Jagex Spaghetti problems
---
Tanzoo vs Virtoso is still the best for fun, good laughs
---
Overwatch loot boxes are loot boxes done right, though. It is purely cosmetics, there is nothing in there that gives you an advantage. Plus you can get them just by playing, so you only buy if you want to give Blizzard more money.
---
The mobile game thing, yeah, that is shit, but profitability from mobile games is stupid massive, so I don't think I can actually blame them, to be honest.
---
Hmm, do i get the kills over bp people?
---
Check out Tanzoo vs Virtoso too
---
Just a shame one of those features wasn't a notification that my associated email was being changed. Its also a shame that they force you to wait 7 days to use a bank pin. My account is less than 7 days old so I couldn't even utilise all these 'measures' 
---
That's another issue entirely, the wilderness bosses as a whole are garbage because they aren't correctly balanced. But we all know they SHOULD be high risk high reward, right now they're just medicore mid level content for most people unless they want the pets.
---
What was your max hit?
---
Dw theoatrix is out there helping your ass by inflating the price of talismans he's got you son
---
Take in to account protect from mage splashing etc. You might not even get rooted before you tele out. 
---
I don't pvp and I voted No on that poll. 
---
I don't think 24% of the voters were all pvpers who are a part of a hivemind that all voted the exact same way. Maybe a lot of people just don't want ezscape where you have a spell icon the size of a quarter to ensure that you don't ever misclick.
---
I see where they are going with consuming the build up of monster remains (heads) through the ability to train prayer. However the prayer xp provided is so minimal in comparison to the drop rate. Surely they should provide some slayer rewards such as points or preferably a large chunk of xp, say 5-10k (even higher with rarer heads). It would be great to implement something like that for heads received on task but it might be too difficult to determine which heads were from slayer or regular pvm.
---
#stopspitevotes
---
I'm going to blow your mind. The reason Black Chins are located in the wilderness is to create a high risk-high reward situation where you should expect to run into pkers. Hunting black chins is not meant to be something you can do for 6 hours straight with no downside.
---
If you are getting killed though, then maybe consider bringing a dinh's bulwark and some black d'hide. Also consider running south and teleporting away if a pker logs in. Also consider banking every once in a while instead of piling up chins in your inventory until you die.
---
also what mechanics are people using in an "equally toxic way"? The only people abusing the polling system are people who have a weird hatred for pvp
---
Happens to the best of us :(
---
Why so excited? You can get more death runes by trading in your cat. 
---
you have a pure you just insulted yourself tho
---
Honestly, I’ve just lost interest in Pking and it’d be a lot easier to just progress this account on mobile. I want to boss and stuff but don’t really know how efficient it’d be doing pvm on mobile since I barely play it except for afk skills
---
I think its more referring to your group of online friends that you actually fuck with, not just some random guy you met at the ge. This meme made me really sad thinking about old friends I talked to every day and then never again haha.
---
Don’t get prayer yet until you’re higher strength and range. It will give you a combat level or two and will make your account weaker than your bracket
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Acting like that's remotely related to this discussion is fucking dumb.
---
Don’t think they can make the bank size any bigger without it glitching 
---
I care
---
Can you fuck off now
---
The fucking wcing killed me
---
Yeah you seem worried. 
---
Uhh the real solution is simply to add unique rewards to each mini game to make them worth playing.
---
Pest control has the void outfit, Fishing trawler has the fisher outfit, Barbarian outpost has the fighter torso as well as pendant pet, etc
---
If you want to make shitty mini games like castle wars more popular then start adding unique useful rewards to that mini game.
---
Also please reduce castle wars games to 5-10 minutes or increase the amount of tickets you win overall.
---
Found it. South of the square, slightly west.
---
You've probably spotted a super shitty miniscule minority.  
---
Mining to darude sandstorm? 
---
yea thats cool but have you ever got 500 death runes from the maze event
---
South of the square, slightly west 
---
How we virgins when we alphas &amp; make y’all sit while y’all cry that we tell y’all to sit or get good 😂😂😂
---
Nothing you can do
---
Well if a game goes from over 20million current acounts down to around 5million and out of those 5million many of them hate the newest expansion it is at least somewhat dead, I bought the new exspansion and after a few months canceled my subscription again. I think many people play cause it is familiar
---
what are the benefits of doing it?
---
&gt;WHY IS DISABLING 2 FACTOR INSTANT AND PROVIDES NO EMAIL NOTIFICATION?!
---
That's just false. It does provide an email from trying to disable auth and some people have said it also sends an email when being recovered (though i havent tested recovery)
---
Not sure if this is a new copypasta or something, but they either recovered your account, you have a rat, or they have access to your email. It's one of the 3. 
---
I've heard stories of hackers changing the account email to a similar one, so the victims don't notice. 
---
&gt; is a dick on purpose
---
&gt; gets called out for being a dick
---
&gt; pikachu meme
---
“Hey, I’m not a dick, I’m just enjoying the game MY way!”
---
Just north of the grain mill, just south of the graveyard, just west of the cabbage(?) field, just east of the agility shortcut to the Saltpetre mines 
---
Yeah for sure. I don't consider them the same as actual PvPers
---
Yeah why not? That’s a good idea. 
---
Farming is also the perfect skill to train on mobile. I never tried farming back in my Runescape account originally, but since mobile came out I’ve been grinding it daily.
---
Oh yeah for sure
---
Ents, low lvl rev caves, ven, vet, kbd lair(close easy tele), wildy slayer in graveyards
---
I always go for all bothers and 3 skeletons which is 88%. It gives a good amount of runes and the skeletons are fast kills. The % doesn't play into barrows drops though, with all brothers it will be a 1/16 chance for any item. I usually get around 500k/hr and only runes so this was like hitting the lottery for me lol
---
Genie XP lamps is one way. Should probably be around 100xp/h or so
---
They look cool
---
non instanced bosses are going to be rough
---
looking for wow, will mess the results becouse wow is a real word, also there are companys named wow that has nothing to do with warcraft, and warcraft term is still bellow OSRS, with one spike when movie droped.
---
now do mo bamba 
---
Other games did it with some larger degree of success, I remember back when I did Toontown it had Bingo Wednesdays for fishing, Grand Prix Sundays for racing, Trolley Tracks Thursday for the mini-minigames, and Silly Saturdays where all three of those rotated once an hour. I remember having fun in each of those, so I think the concept could work in general. Adapting it to OSRS in a sensible way sounds tricky though
---
Kill count as one roll and pluck counts as another. 
---
No absolutely not. Once it starts it will never stop.
---
I miss you jadehaden123
---
Thanks for the very informative reply! I will admit that the whole 'RAT Kit' is beyond my understanding and I didn't even know such a thing was possible. 
---
That being said; I don't actually have Runescape on my mobile. I've never played via my phone and have only accessed the game using the client on my PC. Any idea how would such a thing end up on my PC though? I've not downloaded or installed anything in the last few days apart from the Runescape client itself. 
---
As to the client I was using; I was using the client from the following link: [http://www.runescape.com/oldschool/download](http://www.runescape.com/oldschool/download) I was redirected to this link by [https://oldschool.runescape.com](https://oldschool.runescape.com) after a red banner message said that Chrome no longer supports Java. Unless I've seriously messed up and this isn't a legit website.
---
I voted no because it gives +3 max hits for the scythe which is insane.
---
I’ll give you the 2m it cost to get one, it’s 1/32k and you wasted your rng on a visage already 
---
its cause any buff to pvp content just looks like "hey vote yes if you wanna die more often" to any pvmer 
---
Sometimes it takes a bit to get going. Don’t shame him. 
---
I've had 8 jars in 2.2k kc fml
---
i dont even pk this is just petty and sad
---
You keep the untradeables
---
Which one? lol
---
The only one that'd work is the Keepsake system of Rs3 where you can keepsake some equips to become cosmetic overrides. It also needs Rs3's cosmetic overrides to shut off in areas like Wilderness or Duel Arena where seeing what others have is necessary.
---
He isn’t mobile like us nerd, and you are higher than lvl 85 sooo throw that shit out, let’s get to bossing
---
so if the game has same defensive and offensive stats it’s best in slot? I don’t think you what it means 
---
This also limits search results to RS3, discounting OSRS.
---
Going to be grinding Wintertodt going for 99 firemaking. I’ve never had a 99 before and I started playing in 2005. Currently I’m 96.
---
HAHAHAHAHAH @Pinuzzo i'm dead!!! HAHAHAHAHA i'm crying bro. Uno cazzo di finocchio froscio
---
This is a known way to train strength only.. how is it botting?
---
Looks good man, grats on your loots! And thanks for the tips, I'll try it out and see how RNG goes for me. 
---
agreed, I was doing some wildy slayer and got chased a bit by a PKer, eventually turned and fought, nearly got the kill and was pleasantly surprised with myself. it was fun, got my heart racing.
---
That’s actually spot on, thanks my dude for not being one of those “get good” or why don’t you just play 10 hours a day people it’s nice to have understanding people in the community. It’s weird that reddit is polite and Facebook where you can actually see who the people are are toxic af
---
I dont want the pvp community to have options. 
---
Honest question, what do people mean when they call women basic? Looking at dictionary but doesn't make sense.
---
I didn’t say how I voted. Would I still be an idiot if I voted the way you wanted me to?
---
You don’t have to enable invasions by using the human effigy. Hell, you can also purposely disable them for 30 minutes at a bonfire by burning one of them. You don’t really have to be max health all the time. You can even use it in front of a boss door and go right in if you want. Your experience is just you being bad. It’s purely optional in every way since you do not miss out on anything by refuseing to partake.
---
Also, covenant rewards are all obtainable offline which means you don’t have to engage in pvp with others at all.
---
I’ve been trying to get to that point and gear for it, but thank you too! That account is solid 👌🏼
---
IS IT NOT OBVIOUS SIR HE CLEARLY DOES NOT MOVE AND DOES NOT TALK WHEN OP LOGGED IN HE IS THEREFOR 100% BOTTING /s
---
They present the updates in a very poor way
---
/r/mahogany
---
Ahh when you get called out on your bullshit so you pretend you didn't read it lol. Thankfully people like you have been out in force today waving your childish petty flag being greatest advocates there could be for jagex to realize the necessity to put updates like this in as integrity.
---
Probably frozen 
---
Drop a cannon at Ogres, Hill Giants, rock crabs, etc and afk refill when empty
---
RuneScape is now safescape where u keep half ur items on death and you have an hour to get back and loot them
---
No one is forcing you to use wildy slayer. The reason that you are using it is because it makes good money and gets good amounts of slayer points. Wildy slayer is high risk (getting pked) for high reward (making money). If you don’t want people pking you, go to a normal slayer master.
---
Non-pvp players are delusional as hell.
---
Nice. 
---
the background was originally white and when i made it black on paint it affected some of the letters lol
---
history repeats itself. we are back to random = funny
---
That’s dope single double or triple?
---
seems so. Otherwise this submission it would got waaaay more attention. 
---
Usually if you meet people on tinder youre not going to know their surname which already makes it a struggle.
---
If you don't have mutual friends or are from different places (like a 2hour drive) then it makes it even harder again.
---
Fuck off commie
---
I agree with that completely. Seems like something that should have been along the lines of a bug fix or when they fix misspellings
---
Broken af. Devalues everyone that put in the hours and money to gain the muscle memory of clicks. 
---
But also would most likely bring in new brids/pkers so easy loot for well seasoned pkers. 
---
God I miss castle wars
---
Are we allowed to remap right and left click to two different keyboard buttons? I'm trying to do the zero mouse movement oak door method but i end up moving the cursor every now and then. Also how would I go about doing this? Say I wanted left and right keyboard arrows to work as mouse 1 and mouse 2.
---
Right here. That’s the reason B0aty is insanely popular. He runs an entertaining stream based off of himself, not just the game.
---
glad I'm not alone lmao
---
Wheres that post
---
I struggle to keep up at 6
---
Got heeeeeeem
---
Whaaaaat 
---
Hey there. Funny enough reading your post I was just recently hacked in a similar way and lost about 30m. Storytime...
---
A long night of playing the GE and I went to bed with my cash stack in my inventory.
---
I awoke the next day to find that when I logged in my password had been changed as well as the authenticator enabled. 
---
Email hadn't been changed and no email notification had been sent.
---
I ended up finally being able to recover the account (thankfully I had a pin on bank so I didn't lose everything). The perpetrator had requested a new bank pin but with a 7 day delay it was no use. 
---
I just returned to RS after a few years break on the same character. I too have ruled out a keylogger because why wouldn't they go for bank accounts or whatever? My password was in an entirely different language so it wasn't something EASY to guess. 
---
I have now enabled the authenticator and doubled the length of my password to try and help prevent this. 
---
I understand the cycle , just don’t understand why it exist. Its an overall game improvement. Makes room for my niche gear , which requires more pvm content. Only hurting themselves.
---
... 
---
Hi I’m pink crow 
---
No one plays mini games because it isn't 2006 and there is literally no reason.  You know how good rewards would have to be to pull most players away from doing things that better their account or earn them gold right? Plus have you ever gotten the angular set? Forcing people to play really bad no I games for gear is boring and uninteresting. 
---
I agree with you. Zeah was huge because it's buildings were/are still huge. Look at the arceuus buildings for christ sake and compare them with the small buildings you have at the main land. 
---
The good thing is, the buildings sizes are definitely good in this rework. However, I also agree with you that it still feels a bit crowded. I see a lot of ruines that I think can be removed of the game. Ofcourse, we don't really know the purpose of those buildings so let's wait I guess
---
#NAH FAM I'M JUST GAY NOW LOL
---
1-defense pure isn't really a self-restriction though, it actively makes the character stronger in the situations it's built for. Restricted ironmen are arbitrary restrictions purely for the player's enjoyment.
---
lmao wtf u mean you linking zelda porn on your shit whos nothing
---
Doesn't surprise me at all
---
Made a f2p pure to try to learn. Shit is tough man
---
I don’t pk, maxed 20 defense. I pvm why can’t I have options ?
---
nope never had that
---
Oh ok, I didn't know, that's just what his comment sounded like he was saying.
---
Agility and herb/fruit tree runs every time I can.

See “remove defence requirement” -&gt; think “helps pures” -&gt; vote no 
---
That’s why it’s failing 
---
Wrong
---
Was a kick in the heart for fashionscape. 
---
Funny how wrong this is. Auto-casting has a delay on the first attack. It is not and never has been a viable tactic. Nobody decent would autocast in a regular fight.
---
It's kind of dumb for it to arbitrarily just not work for PVP.
---
Nobody should care about anything that happens in life at all since we are all going to die and decompose anyways, why even enjoy anything

#REEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Has no real affect on gameplay and it is known that there is a cognitive bias when voting when you already can see the likely outcome 
---
Did this hit r/all or did someone come shit on you for playing a game that they like enough to subscribe to the subreddit for it
---
byeee
---
Where exactly?
---
Dude how tf you going to come on Reddit and act like a know it all? If it was as simple as your armchair development would make it out to be, they'd put it in. They would be stupid to NOT put it in by your logic.

If something is a "five minute fix" but they haven't done it over two years then clearly you're missing part of the problem. They aren't going to share what this problem is with you in totality because sharing everything about your game is detrimental, you need to keep hackers out as much as possible and sharing too many details is akin to shooting yourself in the foot.

It's fucking amazing how often around here people blatantly, like /u/WriteAsciiString, feel like they can one up an entire staff of developer's because they theory crafted some shit on Reddit.

Why tele out lmao still had hella supplies

Theres no challenge and theres very little reward. That kinda is the whole point of the game/every game.

Right? You can only think how this and others polls would be different. It’s just needless bitterness I’m a pure who pvms and not much pking. It’s just senseless.

Looks excellent!

I think proper worldbuilding, atmosphere, and setting is a big part of what makes OSRS special. This is a great step in the right direction for Zeah.

so verac's helm counts as a full helm? so what about guthan? and dharok is med helm? i don't think they mean verac's when they say "full helm". other than that i have nothing to say because i don't really know much about bonusses

Where exactly am I on 'that hentai shit' Also yeah I love hentai. You also watch some irl streamer heh.
---
Yeah because a HUGE portion of the community is only here for pvp. 
---
PvP could just cease to exist and there would be _maybe_ like a 5% change in memberships. 
---
The only unpolled pvp updates that should occur are those that decrease the barrier to entry. Otherwise the eLiTe PvP community can just keep circle jerking and die slowly.

Nothing special, sadly. I used elite void melee (plus whip, dragon defender, b ring(i), bandos boots) and sliced up karil and ahrim with a dds. Then, elite void mage (plus imbued heart, toxic trident, occult, imbued mage cape) to kill the rest of the brothers. I know the tormented bracelet is bis for barrows, but I didn't feel like breaking barrows armor there to tank OR shilling for justiciar because I'm broke atm. I also brought along a super set for ahrim/karil/skeletons, as well as a salve amulet(ei) for extra fast skeleton deaths. I brought a Desert Amulet 4 for fast healing, and a rune pouch full of runes for a cheap tele back to barrows. My stats are [here](https://i.imgur.com/VNhtfqm.png)

For farming you can buy low level seeds in draynor, get seeds from birds nests or thieve them from master farmers.

You can make regular energy potions by buying chocolate at the grand tree, and eventually super energy potions by cutting Sulliusceps (Which won't be easy on a level 3 ironman).
---
Seems like we're complete opposites then lol
---
Well said , and very similar to my own thoughts. It’s really a recolor that a community similar to iron man size would really enjoy. Just seems like a bitter vote. Oh well , guess we’ll just keep passing everything as long there’s a 70 defense requirement and keep making level mid levels amazing.

not gamebreaking at all, just lowers the skill gap in PvP slightly but there are so many many mechanics on pvp that it will hardly make a difference. in PvM however, this is would amazing to have

I'm no professional but most Slayer is melee based so I would stay with your setup honestly! Mage tasks you can just buy a trident! 
---
Oh, for sure, I've logged a thousand hours since launch, and I play it often, I know for a fact how sad the state of the game is. They honestly fucked up prior to launch, and the bandaid fixes aren't enough, but I still hold that the loot boxes are good. You don't have to buy loot boxes, and if a person thinks skins are important enough to spend real money on, then they need to re-evaluate their lives. People are gonna do what they are gonna do. Let them be, they don't need their life policed.
---
Also, games are in decline because the cost of producing a game has increased, while prices are stagnant. For perspective, xBox games have been $60 since the beginning of the 360 era. That's been over a decade, and wages have risen in the industry. This cuts profit margins. Pushing out loot boxes is a survival tactic. In the case of Overwatch it is best case scenario. And as for the gambling crap, yeah, it is taking advantage. Show me a company in any field that doesn't take advantage of the consumer, I'll proceed to tell you you are wrong. Making a game that is an instant classic doesn't really cut it anymore, especially in an over saturated market.
---
Can we get slower runecrafting xp? I love runecrafting and nobody else does so you should change the game for this small percentage of players and I.

Sometimes you just need to go underground. All this social media is a drag after a while and probably part of the reason why the depression came up in the first place. I personally haven't had my facebook active in 3 years now and am the better for it. I am very sorry that a whole group of my friends got nuked off in the transition, but they are better off without my crazy self anyway.

It feels nice knowing that if someone says they know you, they genuinely mean it because they have to talk to you face to face or at least have your phone number.

---
Even with rewards like double points you have to consider that certain minigames that are always active now (e.g. pest control) might suddenly suffer from a lack of players, with people only going to pest control on the double point spotlight. Half the problem was people afking for thaler, ruining the gameplay for those who wanted to play, but the other half of the problem was people avoiding minigames until they were on spotlight.
---
I think adding EXTRA experience not taking all exp away would help. If people could get decent rates playing PC or CW people would play it more. Currently the difference in exp is considered too much to consider playing a minigame for fun. But if you could get say 50k combat exp per hour in a combat stat in the minigame vs 100k doing the best mind numbing method I bet some people would choose the fun way.
---
Theres a website that combs around for breaches/leaks and will also notify you if one happens.  It's www.haveibeenpwned.com
---
how about you stop bitching? If anything mage and melee need buffed. Mage is useless because it has "utility" so it is neutered from having any damage.
---
Melee is fine but it needs to have more damage considering it REQUIRES MELEE RANGE.
---
Blowpipe, twisted bow need nerfed and then the other two combat styles need buffed. Range is fine as it is.
---
True but there is no reason to melee when you dont lose money and he needs to train mage more since its already lowest. 
---
Wtf

I can't stand Sparcmac honestly, he seems juvenile and just really irritating to me. Boaty has just been around since the start which is probably why.

We had free trade before the GE.

New players wouldn't be crippled by it because they wouldn't use it. It would become recognized as a privilege of the wealthier players.

Also what kind of anti-Communist supports a free service? The tax is actually just a service fee at the end of the day.

---
Yep, and those numbers are based off the total number of searches in those countries. 
---
From Google Trends:
---
&gt; **Note:** A higher value means a higher proportion of all queries, not a higher absolute query count. So a tiny country where 80% of the queries are for "bananas" will get twice the score of a giant country where only 40% of the queries are for "bananas".
---
Preferably you want a solution where you dont kill all minigames that aren't on spotlight.
---
If you make pest control 2x points during spotlight or something no one will ever play when it isn't spotlighted.

Legion had a lot of good systems that just need tuning.
---
If AP was account bound and legendaries were buyable. The expansion would probably be considered the best WoW expac.
---
Everyone loved in 7.3.5 because they basically gave everyone what they wanted. 
---
BFA feels like a beta test for legion. Every system in it is just a worse version of what was in legion. Azerite are bad legendaries/tier, the m+ dungeons were designed with m+ as an afterthought. Uldir was decent but made no sense if you were alliance. 
---
The expansion will probably be fixed by 8.3.5 which will probably change it's view a bit. 
---
That's ignorant 
---
wow is also just a regular term, not only a way to refer to World of Warcraft.
---
Legit wouldn't be surprised if the PvM community voted this in just to spite Pkers..That would be hilarious.
---
good idea, that way you can meet the requirements to use a better item in the game. which is how the game works.
---
But it won't, its a +1 prayer bonus, which is completely negligible in a minute long fight.
---
You not lucky. That is all.
---
92% chance of each step. You must have a significantly lower chance of completing the whole trail, right?

I think the difference is the trajectories.
---
Osrs is basically always the best and the most popular it has ever been. WoW is basically always the worst and the least popular it has ever been.
---
I think that's what people feel. Nobody is hyped for WoW, it just exists and degrades.

My head, Ouch!
---
It goes beyond that, they're actually incapable of looking beyond their own perspective. All of these guys go into the wilderness only to do PVM/Skilling, and so they only encounter the PKers who intentionally kill these guys. But rather than making that simple connection, they assume that every PKer in the wilderness is out there only to kill them, and never to fight.
---
Look at this reply from a ridiculous comment chain I'm in about how it's "unfair" that PKers try and have an advantage of other people. Beyond the argument of "no shit, everyone wants the biggest advantage possible", I got this as a reply:
---
&gt;It's inherently competitive when you're both trying to kill each other and survive.
---
"Except that's never the situation PvPers look for. They look for players who obviously have no interest in fighting, and *can't* win if they fight back. Hence, non-competitive."
---
How do I find the video of the noob dancing 
---
I personally dont care, but just bc its been in the game forever doesnt make it "right". If pures want to walk around in full dharoks to fight I say let em. PvP is relatively dead anyways and the only way its revived is if they make it more "noob-friendly" osrs is having the same problem rs3 is experiencing where the more experienced pker will win 95% of the time. The pking community doesn't actually care about reviving PvP they care more about Pking. And yes there is a difference. End rant.
---
Oh I see. Makes sense.

I thought group iron would just be to enable ironmen bossing together and being able to trade. Didnt think they were gonna implement things like slayer.
---
The fact that the current expac was the fastest selling version of the game ever contradicts that.
---
Both versions of Runescape combined only have ~1m subs, and just day 1 sales of 3.4m copies blows RS out of the water.
---
The reddit community is absolutely happier with OSRS than WoW, no question. But if I got the profit from one game or another, I'd take WoW 11 times out of 10.

This man continues to amaze me

Just give us a “set up quick drop” option on the inventory, and have it work the exact same as quick prayers, but you just shift click your inventory icon.

Most of the time they don't respond to posts like these unless it gets enough upvotes, because 90% of the time it's either complete lie or OPs are leaving out information about the offence
---
Idk. I voted yes on the entangle, though I'd honestly prefer Protect Magic to affect ice spells instead. But removing restrictions on blessed hide is frankly just pandering to pures, who are deliberately limiting their options. There's no reason to balance the game around them. 
---
Sometimes you don't have rank to though

Shit...so vaccines cause cancer?

That's such a vague generic answer. The player isn't going to give two fucks about it either way.

Good freeze? It maxes a like a 5 compared to barrages 40 in Pvp. On top of that look at the invent space you need to use to actually bring entangle, surge and TB. Your left with about 3 brews and 3 food at most.

If you get caught out with that invent you're absolutely fucked.

Those are the active characters that've logged in in the last 6 months. ~45 million in the US and EU above the level of trial accounts, that doesn't include the other 3 asian regions, china, korea and Taiwan.

That's characters, not accounts, so up to 50 characters per account, though of course, how many have and log into 50, virtually none. 
---
WoW is vastly more popular than RS. People who've been screaming they're quitting are the same people who were screaming they were quitting in legion when something happened they didn't like, and the same people that were screaming they were quitting in WoD.
---
Every single xpac has a period where 'the sky is falling/the game is dying/blizzard is the devil'. And then time goes on, they fix what people don't like and everyone's happy again.

You usually don't need to. Quests are self-explanatory, boss fights drop tables are in-game, etc.

Lmao I meant to comment that on the post about eating the stuffed snake ama as a joke. My bad, I deleted the comment.
---
I personally have hosted a lot in the past (not much recently).
---
\&gt; 1) separate the community in half 2) might not be as populated as the houses originally on w330
---
Yes, adding another world would cause less people to be on each house but that is already happening with the increasing numbers of hosts in recent hosts. I understand less people in houses across two different worlds might mean there are less people in each house but is that neccesarialy bad? I could mean people are chatting less in the houses but in my opinion the lag on W330 is already so bad something must be done. 
---
Also, with when W330 gets full it makes it harder for players to find a maxed house to use already. Adding another UK House party would alleviate the stress and population on W330 reducing the chance of both being full.
---
But that is just my 2 cents, I appreciate the feedback.
---
Supposed to be 1/512, but I have gotten 6 boots in a task of 200 before. Depends on your rng.
---
So is this the halftime show during the super bowl?
---
1.	Being on defensive gives you a small invisible defense boost. Theoretically you want to be on defensive as they hit you to get the defense bonus, then back to an offensive style when you hit to get the extra damage potential. 
---
2.	As for combat trainging mage, your best bet is to burst monsters in the catacombs of Kourend - namely Dust Devils. You’ll actually make a small profit (albeit very small) but you get some of the best mage xp rates you can get without huge expense. You need the ancient spell book, and any slayer levels to kill the monster you want to burst but it’s well worth it. I actually find bursting very enjoyable and do it often.
---
And if you do get stuck on a quest in wow and need to look online, you search the quest name and "wowhead", not wow lol.
---
you should learn to flick bandos or you should use max mage.
---
That was unexpectedly good

I do daily tree runs and 2 to 3 daily herb runs.  Fruit tree runs every 2 days

No, really, it’s not.

---
1. the combat styles give you a hidden +3 in that stat, so defensive gives you a hidden +3 defense, etcetera. It can be a small help but a help nonetheless.
---
2. There are quite a few. By far the most popular you will see involves  ice bursting dust devils or nechryaels, if you have 70 mage. Otherwise, you could also do blue dragons in taverley if you have 70 agility. It's not nearly as fast xp, but it's a popular lower-level spot that is really because you can just safespot dragons.  In general, a lot of profitable slayer monsters are also profitable if you mage them, even if mage isn't the 100% most efficient way of killing them.
---
No reason to have Kraken again in a different raid. It would need to be something else. Or implemented in a different way. Like, if you've killed the Kraken before then it's twice as hard or something like that.
---
Do people genuinely think clans exist to kill random idiots? lol.
---
Go to Karamja, go down the volcano, find the wall past the spiders and you can open it to get to Elvarg.
---
bludgeon has more dps but dagger's stab bonus can make it more useful on certain tasks such as dragons, in general there's more things weak to stab than crush. though whether or not you'd use dagger for those tasks depends on whether you're okay with gaining shared/defence xp using a hasta.
---
the initial cost shouldn't be an issue when you can sell it back after you're done with it. the item has been out for a while so it's price should be fairly stable.  
---
even if you lose a couple mil from selling it a few months down the line, if you consider how many hours you've used it to train with, the cost of using per hour isn't actually that expensive.

They were just good at grinding. Woox actually understands the game down to the code.

Interesting. So with a imbued zerker ring and all the other trimmings does this mean 1 defence pures who go for 50mage/55slayer  are capable of hitting 3's or 4's? Or is it still just +2? I recall reading somewhere that to gain a max hit at 1att/str you need +47 strength, which +35 from the slayer staff seems possible to get, I just don't know if you need 94 strength for two max hit or if the threshhold lowers after the first point of max damage.
---
true it does get full and makes it harder. but it also means (as a host) less tip. i know tip is not mandatory, but its appreciated and you'd probably agree to that too. so it would even affect hosters. so ya something has to be done, but a rotation would be better imo. the community can hop worlds. yw for feedback.

I'm serious, try it for yourself

From lore standpoint no, I would rather see them further expanding on desert, Zeah and Morytania, maybe even desert raids

Some ironmen are just nice people trying to play the game, some ironmen are just Fuck heads who act like pieces of shit and ruin the reputation of everyone else. 
---
Is that void helms with verac armor?
---
Dude don't listen to these nitwits, runecrafting is perfectly viable to rebuild. You only need 44 runecrafting to make 250k+ an hour.
---
Nah I never skip
---
Best comment I've seen on this yet. Thank you for your time.
---
Thanks

"it's the wildy so that means I can be as big of an asshole as I want to pvmers"
---
This is why we vote no on pvp updates.
---
Q
---
It's very hard to design a minigame that can stay fun, fresh, and exciting for thousands of games. Not impossible. 
---
Many players also define "fun" as reaching the goals they've set for themselves ingame. If the minigame does not help them reach their goals it is a waste of time.
---
So roughly 1m per hour. That's not bad. Good job. :)
---
how long did this take and is it worth doing if i dont have 87 hunter?
---
Fuckk i was really hoping the bass synth hits or whatever before the Travis part starts would be the goblin taking damage sound effect. Still great tho &lt;3
---
What about "RS" or "RS3"
---
Who the heck fully types out RuneScape when searching for something
---
Whale. 
---
It wouldn't actually rival it since you'd have to sacrifice head, chest and leg strength bonus.
---
thats an awesome looking tree shows its age with the grey beard and all
---
Yeah few days ago some dude reported me because he "went to the toilet for 5 mins and logged out" and i took the spot
---
If I had any proof he actually did, id let him stay
---
But theres no way to know if theyre just lying
---
only americans talk about being deployed\*
---
Hit up YouTube. There are several great guides.
---
Mate. 10m would take an extremely long time. I dont know the buy limit but im assuming its in the low thousands or even less for kebabs. So yes it 100% would sell for more in bulk like that. Not everyone would want to wait a month or two or several stacking up an item like this. 
---
Yeah it's the same reason we won't get a new skill, there are too many people who just don't want to have to grind out another one.
---
Not sure about harmony isle one but pretty sure all the other ones have at least a tele that's close by already
---
Falador farm - lumbridge diary ring higher than easy diary
---
Catherby - Camelot tele and run east like 20 seconds
---
Hosidius - xeric talisman glade tele and run east like 10 seconds
---
Weiss - icy basalt takes you right on top of it
---
Troll stronghold - troll stronghold tele + hard fremmy diary done takes you right next to it
---
Ardougne - Ardougne diary cape higher than easy diary
---
Morytania - ectophial and run like 20 seconds west
---
Farming guild - skills necklace
---
I must be doing something wrong if pc is fun
---
Use full void melee/mage with your best melee boots and torture or fury with occult. Use a whip with dds(claws if you have) and defender to spec ahrims. Bring combat pots as well. Use arceuss spell book and home tabs. Most efficient method I know of.
---
Thank you and sorry about that.
---
yeah same, what the fuck are seeds and how to make plant???
---
it reminds me of me when i was a kid playing RS getting excited over an addy scimmy.
---
I have the hard diary complete and just use the portal in my POH. pretty much I just do the patches that increase yield from diaries and are disease free
---
But in this context, if he has somewhat viable gear to do zulrah then theres no point doing rc at any level?
---
Toontown was awesome! wowee
---
\*goes back to playing OSRS and not Toontown\*
---
Now I know this is hard to wrap your head around, but there's this insane notion known as "having fun playing a game". 
---
Even if you win every single hybrid fight against another pure, you'll still lose money in potions and runes. 
---
Yeah.... I'm gonna have to agree on this one......
---
"Stop calling it QoL, that's an obvious buff to muggers"
---
Yeah but that'll bring up millions of results like "WOW! 40 ELIMS FORTNITE!" or whatever
---
Just recently joined this sub, 
---
God bless 
---
What stats are you working with?
---
About half the time my account is logged in I’m afking so that when I’m playing I’m either doing fun stuff or really tedious non afk 
---
Yeah just don’t enjoy the subreddit related to it!!!!
---
Go check out the people selling bulk items on sythe.
---
Player harassment is purposely going out of your way to harass players. There's an entire twitter thread showing proof of his harassment. So far everything you've tried to say has been thwarted with clear and concise facts. You lose.
---
didn't read lol
---
I can't only play osrs it gets boring. And Ive gone through all shows and youtube that interest me. So I watch osrs streams while playing it cuz it works i guess.
---
tbh looks like the head of an old centaur
---
For things that are made to be a challenge of all out player skill, Ex. TOB, COX, inferno, I totally get that. For something like A. Hydra where it's meant to be killed over and over again, I think a plugin does no harm. I'm all for challenges and am okay with a good amount of tediousness. But counting to 3 thousands of times in a day seems like something an official plugin is perfect to avoid.
---
I’d actually switch to osbuddy from runelite if I could be lazier at hydra dumb tedious mechanics 
---
So coal now costs 10235 ea but sells for 216... This straight up ruins the g.e. 
---
Just blowpipe nmz it’ll boost your HP a lot 
---
That will also take into account the millions of posts saying things like "WOW! STREAMER WINS PUBG WITH 50 KILLS" or whatever
---
Use foil and season that shit ffs
---
&gt; Update: Just found out that it doesn't matter if your password contains uppercase and lowercase. You can just enter your password in all lowercase and it still works. Seriously Jagex?  
---
This really doesn't matter as accounts are not getting breached due to brute forcing them. Password vs. password is irrelevant as the method of breach is likely to be one of the main ones: account sharing, data breach, email insecure, etc. As long as you don't use a short password, you'll be fine. That all being said, they might as well allow that and special characters. My guess as to why they don't, perhaps the system would need the web version of "engine work" to correctly interpret them?
---
In the long run, you'll like the chainbody better.
---
What about Vindicta? :)
---
You’re*
---
Right but like how many people actually want to buy 10m kebabs?
---
This, I don't care about one time stuff like mage cape i or stuff like rev caves that isn't tied to a skill but since PvM slayer masters can assign Wildy bosses if you have boss slayer then there's no reason for me to vote yes to something that gimps me, even if its slightly.
---
Sicko bot 
---
It almost feels like placebo from the attas plant but I feel like i get way less not more
---
The way I see it. Every game has its cesspool of players. Making an activity that collects these players and concentrates them to one aviodable area makes all other areas more pleasant. 
---
I'm an UIM so I never use wild, but i'm all for PVP updates if it keep toxic players in one area or world and lets the rest of us enjoy other non-pvp activities without their influence.
---
I'm 100% not implying all PVPers are toxic, i'm just saying keeping PVP alive is 100% in the best interest of the game. 
---
Torags armor has the high defensive stats of all the barrows armor. 
---
Mate any degenerate playing this game or living would tap that. Hell even if the meme'd face was legit nieve i may give it a whirl just for that bod. 
---
Hes got a point, if u can tank 6 jads for even 30 seconds, then 3 will be easy. Since its 6 that you either die in the first few seconds or you live, theres no fluke here.
---
Reported 
---
Goddamn it, NEVER CONFESS FEELINGS TO A GIRL OVER TEXT! Do it face to face, that way you don't like like your nutless. Even if that won't be enough to win her over at least you'll have some respect and learn how to talk to girls.
---
I swear, if someone wrote an article on the Wiki about how to get girls and Jagex gave irl gfs have a loot table half of you fuckers would be Chads.
---
Now this is the quality content i came for.
---
It takes up most of my day at 8
---
There’s stealing a spot while someone is there, which is a dick move so people complaining about it get upvotes, and there’s taking a spot and someone else appearing and getting annoyed that you took their spot while their away, which is dumb because it’s not theirs when the leave, so people upvote
---
If they make each patch hold 5 fruit instead of 4 then the area could support two people per world. I'd prefer an extra water source for the four patches far from the one currently visible though.
---
Attack(81), Strength(85), Defense(81), Prayer(45), range(70), magic(59), for skilling/afk money I fish(78)
---
They probably don't want to reward and therefore indirectly promote that type of damaging behavior. Gaming addiction is a serious problem and people have died before playing RuneScape.  I'm sure they'll add a nod to him here in there in the updated, but it would he smart for Jagex to distance themselves from that type of liability.
---
Nah they've learned that lesson. They're not going to integrity change things after polling again, if they think it needs to be done they'll just do it. 
---
This is a work of art 
---
Link please m8 
---
Ah okay, so game health &lt; what you like/sticking it to those pesky pkers. 
---
I see this a lot in this thread and any thread that even brushes the subject of making the wilderness and pvp in general a little better.
---
Dude you had like 10 comments removed and the mod I pmed told me you had been banned. Want to keep making shit up be my guest..
---
These posts are getting really old, justified or not, just let people do their thing
---
Whats the best advice for one dreading this aids
---
I think i did 270k in 2 hours, melee bosses only.
---
Have you tried forcing a JMod to teleport your character at gunpoint? Should be a guaranteed way to get help
---
Had a family *
---
Too soon :( 
---
not only was I not banned, but all of my posts are still there
---
again, neck yourself lmao
---
Nice try kiddo but you ain't taking my rank in hiscores. 
---
So... Literally RS3's minigame spotlight system?
---
It’s gotta be these if ur getting less than the guaranteed amount
---
yup. its nice for any task now!
---
Palm phone(US)
---
well its happened twice now, so theres that.
---
Watching his stream now. He has house tabs and a master scroll book. You can put teleport scrolls in the scroll book and and just that to teleport to any of the scrolls you have in it. 
---
They had two, peggle and bejeweled. Both official ports from popcap!
---
yeah, did homework and chores while waiting for sgs spec
---
League has gotten a lot better so you cant say anything if you havent been in that community for three years, because you dont know anything. Csgo has always been at a level, but nope. Not close to osrs
---
Cant imagine how you think a playerbase that is divided into 2 groups and spite vote updates from each other is not toxic. Really, youre performing olympic levels of mental gymnastics!
---
You should share my PM's. Your extremely mature and thought out insults are very clever by the way. :D
---
I go to college full time and work, the point I'm making is that we dont have as much free time as we used to so we learn towards being super xp/gp efficient. But it would be fun to take one day to just screw around like we did as kids.
---
Good. 
---
I dont bot ,but when someone attacks me or I even see someone I usually run away.
---
Caught out? Do you pvp? This update stands to do nothing for solo pkers it only bolsters the effectiveness of teams.  They've ruined their own wilderness...1v1 will never be a thing outside of edge....sure all fights start as 1v1.  How about go 20+ wild and try and solo pk..... Cause bud you sure as shit ain't gonna fight less than 3 people ever.  Fuck up and bring 2m risk? No less than 5.
---
It is already compatible with iOS :) You just need a USB to Lighting adapter but I could provide one for you.
---
The fact that you brush it off as "beef" is hilarious
---
People are spite voting updates from pvm and pvp players. How are you so stupid as to simply just call that "beef?" My guess: Very stupid.
---
Turn private to friends or off 
---
Try getting 82 mage to unlock Ice blitz. Use void Range and Magic switch along with Ice blitz to freeze and then carry on the kill with Trident of the Swamp / Seas. 
---
And for Karils and Ahrims just use a Toxic blowpipe. 
---
Good luck! :)
---
Oh damn you right. I’m glad that was cleared up. Don’t want people accidentally dropping all their precious swamp tar and clean herb
---
Just keep going and try to convince  yourself you know it will come. Honestly I wasn't even in a great mindset during most of my attempts. Luckily I was hitting hard the entire fight and the rng was in my favor. Your freedom will come
---
Rip NMZ if this becomes a thing.
---
I was really expecting sickle mould

if they used account recovery, it both disables your auth and lets the hacker set a new password and email without you ever knowing.

More likely that they just didn't know clue boxes were a thing.

Grind 500 raids and your bank will increase by a LOT. I went from 300m to 1b in 300 raids since Christmas, and haven’t even gotten the Bow. 
---
your pms are in my last post, begging to know if i got banned, which shows that no mod told you anything, no mod messaged me, and that you are a lying sack of shit. now fucking off yourself you waste of life
---
Be careful you don’t get stabbed in the back. Went pking with one of my clanmates way back and apparently he was running with an informal pk group and pretty much lured me to where his friends were and ganked me for 30 mil
---
This.  There's no detriment to taking OSRS gold and then liquidating it into real money.  There's huge implications and consequences for stealing someone's bank information and money which can put you in jail.  As long as you use OSRS as a medium, it's legal
---
Discord’s very easy to use and Mic’s are dirt cheap. Just go ahead and use it
---
Meh they didn’t lose too much
---
If you're opening the implings on the spot it's already large enough to not matter. ~1/10 jars break when you open them so with a few jars in your inventory and a full jar generator you can already catch hundreds of implings. This would change hundreds to like ten thousand if you wanted, but I don't see why that would make any difference in practice. We're talking about a 30s bank run like once an hour here.
---
Then again, I don't do that much puro and I've been banking my implings so many I'm missing a tactic that would make this OP.
---
They most likely have scout bots.  Can't really eacape them unless you go kill a different boss or give it a break.
---
I always see these and think it's just people cheating the system for a picture. 
---
It wasn't meant to be, but maybe I'm underestimating how much of a difference this would make. 
---
Damn dude.... Salty much?
---
Here come dat boi
---
the question should just say "do you want to be harassed in game more often?"
---
Wow that’s insane bro 
---
yes, because i have to share the planet with "people" like you
---
do you want proof? if so, how? because I am looking at it right now
---
keep the edge down keyboard warrior
---
Congrats man! Did my first attempt last night and didnt make it but now i understand everything and should be no problem now.
---
You have 4 combo eats, you clearly have no intention of doing anything but speccing and running and you complain that PK is dead while you kill it.
---
# Also, you pvpers that wouldn't want this in pvp. What are you scared off? Free loot? Are you seriously threatened by potential newbeginners entering wild? I welcome them. The more life, the closer we'll be to how things were back when RuneScape peaked pvp wise. 
---
Well I mean Sandwhich lady could literally be any woman so yeah you gotta add osrs to narrow it down.
---
Wow, some people still believe every post on here claiming they're hacked, after virtually every single one has been refuted by J. Mod responses. Are you seriously this gullible?

Am i crazy?  Did the balloon pop drop party used to be in seers village?
---
Eh different ideas for game health, and I never mentioned anything about "sticking it to pkers". I think it's bad for PvM slayer masters to assign Wildy bosses, its just bait to get people in the Wildy. Which is fine, but I don't think Slayer should be the way to do it. I'd rather Kristilla assign Wildy bosses.
---
 And yes, I will vote for what I like, as long as I don't consider it too detrimental to the game's health, which I don't think it's the case. In fact, most people vote for what they like, which is part of the problem with a polling system.
---
Or any loot drop for that matter. 
---
If you die you lose the clue, so it's not guarenteed to come into the game.

Sorry I don’t understand what you’re arguing

That's what you get for not using Authenticator lmao

Yea but you've gotta look into the other factors here, no one gives fuck if they lose a level 22 account you'd just make another account if you'd genuinely done something wrong.

At the end of the day if people wanna post on the sub about their accounts who cares, if you wanna waste your time being a detective on each one be my guest. Sometimes they're right. wait for the proof he has and go from there. 
---
Im saying that by removing pvp you'd be risking a sizable chunk of players. Deadman mode and pvp YouTube videos are important for the growth of the game

I've been complimented so many times on my cabbage cape while skilling.

I just got Runecrafting 44 on Ironman, what are ways that I can make money from the pile of nature runes I plan to craft? (My magic is high enough to cast High Alch.)
---
Rip OP
---
"I can only lock someone down for 7.5 seconds while also making them unable to tele for 2.5-5 minutes, this is bad for game health!" Get a fucking grip.
---
Looks like you didn’t get the client of the runelite.net. Unfortunately there are phishing websites on .com and .org I believe. 
---
That would work both ways. If someone else changes your password, you’ll log out too.
---
I meant that if theres loads of people doing group ironmen, theres less mtx coming in cause ironmen do not have access to the mtx components of the game.
---
Bankstanding
---
Just bought 1 last night so if we could make this happen, that'd be great
---
Basically why adding the POH pools were a terrible idea. At least duel arena required other people and extra time to do. Even max main pking ends when one person uses their spec looking for a rambo RNG hit and instantly teles not even allowing their opponent to use their spec.
---
Every day we stray further from Saradomin’s light

Not if you only have 3 items, one being a clue, or a clue box.

You might have to pay for mobile through whatever App Store you’re using?

his clue wasnt included in that 5.7m number. excellent reply though

Nah. Theres specific websites for that. Wowhead being one of them.
---
Although it's similar with osrs and wiki, it's just sometimes easier to Google "osrs dragon hasta" or some shit lol.
---
So ive never done raids.
---
So your clan can get all herbs and you can get the twisted bow?
---
Id be pissed. 
---
So only the people who do the PKing should be able to vote, not the players that are on the receiving end of being PKed? Yeah, ok bud.
---
Get good
---
Daaaang 6 dpicks... I’m like 250kc with nothing to show for it 
---
Short answer: developer time/resources are limited. The team doesn't seem to think updates like these are worth it. RSHD would at minimum double (probably more) the work load of future updates, and hog massive amounts of time to update all current graphics. There're more important priorities at the moment.
---
Fifth

I'm sure there are still searches for wow though, even if less than osrs.

I say the set bonus should make it super accurate as an alternative to the elder maul

This. I don't know why jagex hasn't called it quits on addons showing this. It completely removes skill gap.
---
Nice try OsBuddy admin but you're still not making us change back!
---
where does she lives? i need a slayer task kappa
---
You're blocking all the good stuff man. Unless you are just on a hardcore xp grind, Id be doing like basically all of that stuff you have blocked. I do, however, skip drakes and wyrms. They are annoying just not good exp or drops.
---
How so?
---
"Being a detective." Are you this dense? Did you actually read my post and comprehend what I said? It's clear you have zero knowledge of how an account recovery works, so i'll say it again.
---
He claims no emails were sent to him, but that the password supposedly hasn't been changed; this leaves us with **literally** two possible scenarios.
---
* His email is compromised as well and the person went to great lengths to cover his tracks.
---
Does this hold up? No, because he showed us the IP logs, and no one has logged in but him, as he admitted himself, and we can see with our own two eyes.
---
* His account was recovered via the appeals process, which does not send **any emails to your registered email**
---
Neither of these scenarios lead to the conclusion that OP's post is in any way, shape or form *genuine*. He is lying out his ass, and anyone with a shred of knowledge would identify this. Stop defending this moron and move on.

'Revive' the hammers - indicates they were ever alive
---
I frown upon making huge generalizations about populations.  When I PvM I get flamed by PKers when they drop me.  When I PK, I get called extremely derogatory names by the people I kill.  I never say anything.
---
The fact is toxic people exist is all sub populations in this game.  That's an indisputable fact and the us vs them mentality needs to die.

Very nice.

In my opinion it wouldn’t even change that much at all because autocasting the first spell is one tick slower (6t vs 5t).

Why?

No xp weekend

Really the only thing appealing to this idea is to play group ironman with my friends. I would still be playing on my main on OSRS and would likely leave alora for osrs if it had group ironman released.

Will he try to play RS now?

I knew you’d bring that up, it’d be impressive if you didn’t comment every day, multiple times.
---
Just to play the advocate of the devil: define "round". A round of castle wars takes way longer than around of pest control. And for a minigame like barbarian assault,s a round a wave, or a complete playthrough of 1-10? Either way, the game with the shortest round would be played for the currency reward. If you make it time-based (which is how it works on RS3), then people will start afking in games that take a long time (you can afk until the 6 hour logout in barbarian assault). That is exactly why you need to very carefully think about how to make sure people actively participate in the minigames. To give a (possibly ridiculously poorly balanced) example: track every player's damage in pest control, and let the top half receive a reward towards the spotlighted rewards store. This would force everyone to try their best to deal a lot of damage. 
---
Same dudes that buy burnt food.
---
Thanks! Gratz on the pet
---
Tried it out recently and it was horrible. First off, it doesn't pick tasks that you could both complete. For example, my friend picked the task and it was a boss task that I didn't unlock. Them he skipped and it was a bronze dragon task that I had blocked. You'd like there could be a simple algorithm to pick from tasks you could both complete.
---
Then when you get the task you think it could be that you slayer together to meet the task goal. But in reality if the task is 69 ankous you both have to kill 69 (and I wonder what it would be like if one person had extended ankpu task and the other didnt). I also wonder what it would be like for a boss task where you have to take turns killing it.
---
The "partner" system really is not fun but has a huge potential to be. It feels very clunky, confusing, and overall just bad.

&gt;wish it had some sort of order
---
Flair checks out.
---
I mean, it's kind of a trade-off. We lost the mindset of having fun for the purpose of having fun, but we gained the ability to improve in the game much faster to enjoy high-level content. If I played now as I did in 2008, I would still be 80 cmb. I wouldn't be able to do GWD, raids, or slayer bosses.

Overwatch is bleeding players like mad and is plagued by 10-15 minute ques quite often. If they published a live count you bet your ass they're under 120k online at any given time. Even 100k online would net you 2-3 minute ques.

I've clearly stated multiple times in this post that I do not know how my account was hacked. I even stated that in the original post. I have been speculating various potential causes but it is merely speculation. To put your adventurous little mind at ease, I have two images for you.

Now. Unless you're saying that it is mere coincidence that I somehow purchased a level 22 account that has 'Dext' in both my name and email address, I think you should stop accusing me of buying the account. Run a long and play detective with the other children. Though if you do figure out how my account was breached, do let me know!

&gt;  If osrs made more profit by giving us MTX, it would certainly not make the game better for the player.
---
If OSRS had the devs that RS3, we'd get far more updates, far more content. 
---
I understand why people hate MTX. But personally, I'd rather a game with MTX, so long as they don't limit actual gameplay, that gets far more support. 
---
I don't really care if someone else wants to buy their way past so they don't have to actually play the game. I don't care if someone wants to pay money to make their character look better.
---
I play games for gameplay. I play games for myself, and I really don't care what everyone else does.
---
&gt; yet people seem to be pissed off at every update that the developers release. That's not good. You can have more fun for less money elsewhere.
---
People are pissed off everywhere on the internet. Including here. This sub riots 20 times a year. And that's with only minor MTX from bonds.
---
But you look at any individual major part of the game, and people are happy. The raiders are having a blast in the new raid, and the last raid. PVPers are PVPing away. Top end M+ players are loving it. Both their esports are doing well and growing.
---
What are the main complaints? Azerite armour is boring, and no tier sets means there's less cosmetics. Should the sky really be falling over that? And yet, on the internet, the sky is always falling. 
---
&gt; Blizzard don't give half the fucks the osrs team do for their community. 
---
The OSRS doesn't even make decisions. The main team set the 75% voting requirement for OSRS before it was actually started. They sit down for an hour a week to talk about the recent update, and answer questions, but WoW doesn't have weekly updates, So they have monthly Q&amp;As with the lead designer and other teams have their own Q&amp;As.
---
Voting like we have here doesn't really work for other games, because their turn around for projects is long. They work a couple years in advance from the planning process to actual implementation. OSRS works a month or 2 in advance for the biggest projects, and minor projects are sometimes done in a week or less from the time they're polled.
---
So ya, I can see why the communication makes it seem that way, but they're very different situations.
---
&gt;  but the mere fact that we were able to riot about runelite and rshd and actually get either our way or a reasonable explanation from Matt is incredible
---
And WoW gears reasonable explanations from Ion, and plans how they're going to address the issue. But major fixes and system revamps take months at least on WoW.

You need to convince each member that the curse wasnt their fault, use the wiki found on the official osrs website

I guess I'm someone who never saw endgame as where all the fun is at. I might not be bossing in OSRS by 2020 at the rate I play and I'm fine with it. I could just sit and play in the burthorpe game room or do some c Wars and enjoy myself.

It's crazy how there's even a divide. It literally makes no fucking sense.

If you edit it to make Torag's hammers hit twice and add a one-tick delay to the second hitsplat, it looks super realistic and is crazy fun. Obviously you would have to nerf the hammers a bit to compensate, but it's good.

1) That's a kinda complicated question. The attack style gives invisible bonuses to your stats. Accurate gives +3 attack, controlled gives +1/+1/+1 atk/str/def, and defensive gives +3 def. Basically, there are 2 scenarios:
---
Scenario A, where both players attack eachother on the same tick (What's usually the case). In this scenario, altho both players attack each other simultaneously, one person will get priority and have their hit register first (Google "pid osrs" for more info). Generally, swapping attack styles in this situation is for shits and giggles... But if it's getting down to the last hit or two then swapping to accurate (if you have PID) or defensive (if you don't have PID) is minutely better. The theory is you can't deal damage when dead, so if you only have 10 hp left and the opponents hit is going to register first then it'd be better to have the extra defense bonus and hope your hits go through and vice versa.
---
Scenario B, where one player (usually the one without pid) delays their attack so you're attacking on different ticks. In this scenario, constantly changing plays a slightly better (but still extremely small) role in the outcome. Basically, you have it on accurate when you're attacking then the next tick you want to be on defensive so you get the invisible defense bonus while your opponent is attacking.  
---
It's worth noting in both of these scenarios that style switching plays a very small role in the outcome, like 1-2% at best.
---
2) Plenty. I'd recommend ice bursting Dust Devils / Nechryaels in the Kourend catacombs. You'll profit slightly while getting some pretty good xp/h. There are also a few lunar magic spells that can give decent profit while giving 100k+ xp/h. If you're willing to lose a bit of money, then bursting/barraging in the MM2 tunnels is also an option. If low attention training is more your thing, there are plenty of things to alch that lose very little or even profit (tho at a slower XP/h rate compared to lunar/ancient training methods). Browse through the [OSRS Wiki, P2P Magic Training](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_Magic_training#7-99:_Profit-only_method_(slower,_but_always_profits)) page for more options and detailed breakdowns.

Keep in mind that wow has obscure item names so people don't have to put wow in the search bar to be more specific like we do.
---
Agreed with everything but the tool leprechaun. For me it's less a "I keep forgetting it I need help" and more of a consistency thing. Is there another storage in the game that has a maximum capacity on SOME items? Why can he hold 45 billion empty and full buckets but 2 spades are too much for his magical rectum to store? They are a fey race designed SPECIFICALLY to stand in a field for their entire life and hold tools for other people, why has no one figured out a way to hold 2 rakes? It just never made sense and seemed really arbitrary that 1 is the maximum amount (dor some items only).

Yea you switch accordingly as soon as you see him stomp or stand up.

I think Brimhaven is by far the most useful. It's right by the fruit tree patch and saves you from having to either take a charter ship or teleporting to the Brimhaven house portal. Next is probably either farming guild or, if you haven't done the Lumbridge hard diary, port Sarim. Once you've done that hard diary, the explorer's ring 3 puts you right by that tree patch. I guess if you do a lot of Miscellenia stuff, that one would be pretty good, and then the Hosidius patch doesn't look useful at all to me.
---
Personally, in addition to the one in my POH, I have one in Brimhaven that I never take down, and one in the farming guild that I've been replacing when I have extra seeds. I hit 96 farming today, so once i get more seeds I'll probably leave the farming guild up full time and go back to using the Port Sarim patch for farming training.

Last time I pked was when Whip was best weapon, people pked in Ahrims,berserker helm, rune plate body/legs climb boots, cooking gauntlets,black d hide,magic short bow

right now with all these new items like godsword,dragon claws etc I dont think id be able to pk efficiently to satisfy myself maybe I need to get into pking to try out these stuff but then again theres lots of scams in pvp worlds or tricks which I dont know might end up losing one of them +1 items.  
---
So I dont pvp nowadays just pvming

When you see attacks it is already too late to pray, so that only shows where jads are. He used sounds only. And you cant hide healers also.

I use wines if im ranging/maging, they dont heal as much as other foods but they cost virtually nothing. when meleeing, i usually use monkfish or pineapple pizza, you can eat two bits of pizza quickly if you spam click it.

Oh yeah that's way cheaper than the dagger! Thanks

I figured it would be a similar animation to the rocks that Random Events used to throw at people who ignored them, something like max hit 1, low accuracy so it wouldn't be super deadly to actual players, but to a AFK or a bot they would be deadly.

Splitbark boots at Rune dragons when?

&gt;Not being able to protect from tb is fine, but being able to protect from snares would give a great improvement towards getting ganked. Deff should be atleast be put into a trial phase to see the results from gameplay with this setting

I'm starting to think you don't really understand how the game currently works.
---
Dude did you drink a dose of the combat potion?
---
Its a (3)
---
Yea, manual casting can be a pain, but it forces you to practice using F keys to switch thru the interfaces. I found trident adds around 30 secs to each run when magic level is lower than 87. So unless they take 30 secs to set cast while running three times (start to dh, karil to guth, tunnels), you essentially gain an chest run per hour. If they choose to start with Iban's I believe they have to set cast too.
---
On the note of barrow tele, I calculated that for the 2 hrs it takes to do Arceus house favour it'd take 1750 chests to even out cost saved. So I figured why bother at that point. X)
---
Heck, msb works just fine for ahrim. No need to grind the extra ranged levels, for the most part.

If someone has 10 million kebabs and doesnt eat a single one is he really a kebab lover?
---
Its not that you need a pure to be viable, its that pking currently only consists OF maxed pures atm..its all tick manipulation/g maul/ags spec prodding or void range. Hell I'm 80 atk/86 str/75 def and 101 combat i went pking other day for the first time in 12 years, no veng and got a kill my first fight using dh. 
---
You don't need to be maxed efficiency account to pk but the problem is you wont find anyone else doing so. Because the only people pking now are the old timers it seems who already know the BiS status for pking so long live the days of rune/obby/d long 60 def pkers going out there. And thats exactly why i dont PvP anymore, when I was strictly PvP 12 years ago throughout my whole play time from 02-07. Pking is aids now.

i was 450 dry for my first unsired, and it felt weird when i finally got one. i had completely gotten over the fact that i would never get one. it felt like the end of an era, it was almost dissapointing. i had big plans to be the record holder for longest dry streak hahaha. best case scenario, you are getting around 30 kills per hour.. i was getting way less than that. i probably spent 20-25 hours on a dry streak. 
---
I sold 1m of them for 45m when they were 20gp on the ge. This is probably ~1-2b since it has to be a good chunk of the total kebabs in the game.

Too much work for such a small player-base imo

Where is it from? I used to see it a lot in old videos, but I never knew why
---
that is op i must say, only if i had cash to train fletching this way
---
I don't think I've ever cared for a person pking me while running a clue. Cos I could be charging glories or similar and look identical.
---
The people I hate are the ones who kill me while I'm on a clue, I drop the clue to not lose it and come back for it. For them to be waiting there to pk me again.. full well knowing they're spending more money than what I'm dropping. That's when it turns into griefing and not just killing someone for potential reward.
---
It's those people I call low skill. So bad at pking they have to go and kill people with no loot or weapons to feel good. Because the moment the other guy can fight back they aren't good enough to win.
---
:3
---
Yeah, there's actually a lot of time to just walk away from it. 
---
But muh special snowflake feelings. (ಥ﹏ಥ)
---
I already got my answers mate, don't care what reddit thinks of me lmao

And that is Basically the point. The pkers don't get anything from killing cluescrollers. It's just to waste time.
---
account support has not existed for runescape since release date.  
---
Wierd as it is,I havent got a single tweet reply back to some of my cases about my account which is sorted now although I sent many messages, do they pick people to reply randomly or is this a setup to show they have account support?
---
LMFAO
---
I do, but I remember in the old days you were able to select different graphical options via the official RuneScape client such as anti-aliasing. I'm just wondering why they don't officially support it anymore.
---
You could've avoided any problem by using the tools jagex provided and setting up the Auth, that's why they give you 20 reminders a day about it. And if you would've read my whole post you would've seen that I said jagex should've emailed you to make sure you wanted to change the email 🤦‍♂️
---
Auguste the hot air balloon guy haunts my dreams.
---
When you first make an account, t doesn’t set a registered e-mail (despite your login being an e-mail itself).
---
So presumably the hacker simply registered their own e-mail to the unregistered account.
---
Doesn’t change the fact that people feel obligated to get them, even though they don’t really want to play the minigame. So if they can leech it, they will
---
kurask, basically a reskinned gorilla with horns
---
It's this logic that makes me understand killing easy targets to feel good. Because actual PvP is way more fun, but killing no geared players is easier and thus people do it for an easy rush.
---
But you also sound like the exact type of person that makes people complain. Enjoying annoying others isn't exactly a reciprocated kinda feeling, so as long as you leave it at the first kill and don't camp the corpse to grief them returning all the power to you. I don't understand how it's fun but I also grew up as a kid pking in edge and on low accounts at varrock, so I've never understood killing people who don't fight back.
---
Mini game teleports to get you close maybe? 
---
EOC is not the same as MTX, furthermore - apparently even with so many people leaving, the game somehow makes more than osrs, or hopefully used to at least. The problem with MTX is that too many people are okay with it as long as it isn't P2W, once they get fully used to it, then when start pulling this bullshit like rs3 does.
---
My whole point is that publishers push shit like this slowly, so that everyone wouldn't quit. The mentality behind it is - okay, it's just this one thing, it's not worth quitting over this, though I am very upset. After you calm down they pull this crap again and again and again until you have rs3.
---
please teach me biostatistics 
---
Even when I click 'verify email' on the welcome message? If this is the case then you've definitely cracked why I was never notified and how they managed to change my email.
---
No, they need to change the way ranged levels effect combat level. Range should be treated the same as receiving an attack or strength level: .375 combat levels. But you could level attack and ranged to be the same level without gaining additional combat levels (the same way it currently works with ranged/magic). Then the strength stat should render the max hit of both melee and ranged.
---
A maxed ranged tank is 110 iirc with 99s all and atk/str x 1.5 &lt; 148. They have the same survivability as a main and can dish out the same amount of damage with ranged in it's current state.

He literally was developing a Runelite plugin on stream once and did so before Jagex took down the Runelite deobfuscator so the man has literally seen the client's code
---
If you're already actively trying to ruin the game for pkers because you cant laugh off the occasional getting attacked during fucking clue(having to endure danger for reward???) in which you lose absolutely nothing then you're just a petty prick and that's not gonna change.
---
It’s good xp
---
Nope, it isn't. I don't recall saying I *was* in favour of that. Something like adding the teasing stick for verf is a fairly minor transgression, but it's still pandering.
---
On the other hand, two wrongs don't make a right, and removing the requirements here would just cement that bad precedent. Each instance makes the next easier to push through on grounds of 'But those people got their thing, so we should too'.

The ava's is worth the 2 combats for the convenience, so either get 15 pray or 99 range.

They are so god damn cheap. People pay 30m for tassets for +2 str, pay 30m for prims that give +2 s/s/c and +1 str, pay 120m for avernic for +5 s/s/c and +2 str; I think paying 8m for +4 s/s/c and +2 str is a steal!
---
&gt;  you would've seen that I said jagex should've emailed you to make sure you wanted to change the email

You never said this originally. You asked who they should email, not that they should've emailed me. You added that as an edit after the fact, so I missed it. Apologies.
---
&gt; You could've avoided any problem by using the tools jagex provided  
---
Whilst true, does that really mean we should actively ignore these other concerns? Personally I'm not too fussed about the account, it's a low level and I could probably grind everything back in a couple days but I still find it deeply concerning that these other issues have been left unresolved for 10+ years.
