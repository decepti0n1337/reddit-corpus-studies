In Destiny 2 (and other games), you can earn lootboxes (Engrams) for free by getting XP from all in-game activities. These lootboxes offer items that will become purchasable with a non-premium currency after a certain amount of time on a rotation.
---

---
I think it's safe to say that most people consider lootboxes microtransactions.

In this chain no one has pointed out here,
---
&gt;Adds bonds
---
&gt;Adds partnership
---
they haven't added partnership, and they have added bonds.
---
I don't think that's fair for the argument.
---
Someone provided it. I stand corrected on that point. I still do think is farfetched to think it'll happen, because the sole reason why OSRS is there in the first place, is because of MTX being introduced in RS3. I know we like to make devs and companies stupid, but I have a hard time thinking they're honestly that stupid. It would be like if they introduced LFR and other things into Classic WoW. Things which made people go away from Retail WoW in the first place.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Given their track record, sure they might be able to fuck up, but honestly we're at a point now where it should be completely obvious that milking OSRS with MTX would make them lose more money than they'll gain from it.
---

I love how this meme always comes back

Yeah and they've made it clear over and over again that they're not going to add it. You walnut.

They aren't gonna poll it. They make the rules. They will change the rules.

If it's what the shareholders want they have no choice.

---
This is what they said in rs3. This exact same shit.
---
Like everyone else, god bless new stuff
---
Storks. Right?
---
I agree with this. Dude isn‚Äôt even working right now, so he didn‚Äôt get another offer.
---
Want to hear the truth?
---
Almost all of the players won‚Äôt quit if this partnership thing gets implemented with or without the polling. Everyone will just chalk it off as it‚Äôs only cosmetics and not bad, they are just doing it for money etc and I will quit if it goes further. However that‚Äôs the funny aspect because threatening to quit right now before it even passes or gets implemented but 100% rest assured when that time comes, you‚Äôll still be playing and so will the others. Sure you‚Äôll quit when you can buy a red dragon dildo from amazon GE with 50 random levels chest but that‚Äôs in the future. 
---
Keep talking empty threats, that‚Äôs all they are. 
---
Most these fools can‚Äôt  stay away from osrs right now , what makes you think a purple skin color will make them quit. Maybe for an hour, then they‚Äôll be back lol.
---
You don‚Äôt seem to understand that the poll only gets the opinion on that exact question. They can poll about what can be added to the partnership program without ever having a question on if the program should exist. Jagex controls what is on the poll, and thus the poll only gives answers to the questions Jagex wants to ask
---
Worst part? Rs3 isnt even dead yet, its still a cash cow.
---
I intentionally tried to get one with no talking
---
Based on how the twitch promotion went down:
---
&gt;How long after the promotion?
---
Immediately
---
&gt;How will we get them afterwards?
---
Depends on the item, but probably automatically unlocked
---
&gt;How much will they cost?
---
Nothing, they said free on the blog
---
&gt;Who are the partners?
---
Can't really divulge that before the contracts are in place
---
&gt; Pretty soon jagex will be offering leveling services or selling its own bots, jbots, for cash.
---
Why did I suddenly think about Jagex banning third-party clients, but also implementing an "OSRS Plus" subscription (think Dota Plus) which has the Runelite features.
---
Dear god.
---
So it was said by the ceo/shareholders.
---
what makes you think people care?
---
I just realized brews and restores are like hot dogs and hot dog buns
---
It‚Äôs passing either way. Your vote means nothing. Jagex WILL PASS THE POLL.

You can play 1% of runescape for free, alongside thousands of bots and regular exposure to ftp cancer as well as shit xp rates, gated skills and regular messages on login begging you to buy membership.
---
That‚Äôs why I quit RS. For me I simply stopped playing games that have any type of MXT. It‚Äôs the principle, when I pay for a game or pay for subscription I shouldn‚Äôt even be asked to give more money to them. I get why they do it I just don‚Äôt agree with how they do it. Charge for a monthly subscription, the business wants more money? Try getting more people to play the game instead of milking money out of the current player. Strive to get new players.
---
Hopefully Jagex stocks fall enough and the Gowers buy it back.
---
Yeah they also pay their staff shit lol

Bonds are MTX.  F2P was only going to polled under the condition that bonds came with it. It was polled as so.
---
The MTX is this current poll are cosmetics, things like alternate animations, reskins and emotes. You should go vote if you haven't.
---
See at least you gave it another chance and decided the combat system ultimately doesn't fit you and that is fine. I also quit when EoC came out but having returned to it now I must say it's really fun and better than OSRS PvM (but obviously OSRS PvP &gt; RS3 non-existent PvP).
---
I hate the childish attitude the OSRS community has towards RS3 without having even giving it another go. Even with all it's controversial content the game at it's core is still really enjoyable.  I wish more people tried it again and then if they still didn't like it then fair enough, but bitching about it without having played it in 5+ years is stupid.
---
Eat my ass you donkey.
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying. However what I‚Äôm trying to convey here is by beckoning out to these investors who are proven to have their eyes solely driven on quick gains for some quick and easy money is not the best move in my opinion. Let‚Äôs say these investors do read these pages in their respective tongues and decide it‚Äôs a great idea to invest in. Well suddenly if Jagex is not pumping out the quick dollar they are expecting, then they feel pressured to begin doing so. Thus begins MTX. I hope you can see where I‚Äôm coming from.
---
Ur amazing

TIL ironman mode is literally MTX. Gad we got intellectual titan Lavine here to let us all know this stuff

Please, actually find something else to do in your life aside from OSRS.

---
Yeah. It did.
---
I quit after they stopped releasing results of polls. I don't see how not disclosing the results is positive for players. It seemed like it would just allow them to ignore poll results.
---
You are exactly the problemmmm
---
Oh, that was just some picture I found online, not my account lol
---
Ahh the threat of quiting, always sneaked in. 
---
I laugh because nobody quit when bonds were introduced. They are the definition of MTX. Okay they‚Äôre good mtx, a necessary evil  you might say. But, what if this partnership program gets implemented anyways regardless of passing or failing. Nobody is quiting, I give you that. 
---
OSRS / runescape 2 thrives without bonds, so telling me bonds were necessary is bull, it‚Äôs more money for jagex in the form of mtx. They implemented that without a slight of decrease of players. MTX is coming, just a matter of when, and your not going to quit, sure maybe when you can buy levels or what not, but remember mtx creeps not all at once, and by allowing bonds , you‚Äôve crossed that line initially. Justified it as a necessary MTX.
---
Imagine if these sponsorships bring in tons of players, let‚Äôs say 5x the amount right now, you really think these new kids will give a shit about nastolgia? You‚Äôll be pushed out of your majority vote very quickly. Don‚Äôt forget that
---
Lol what is this from!?
---
I understand that this passing could be a slippery slope towards MTX that have an effect on in game content other than cosmetics. 
---
I also don‚Äôt care about any of these rewards. 
---
However, I want to vote Yes with the thought that extra money generated would lead to expansion of the dev team, more anti-botting measures, and other improvements to the game. But that‚Äôs probably a pipe dream so it‚Äôs a NO! vote from me!
---

Well, considering democracy didn't exist in any meaningul sense for most of the events of the second paragraph, I find that a little hard to accept. It's also very convenient that Capitalism gets to exist in a nice theoretical bubble (or purely economic as you put it), while it's opposite must be judged on the basis of historical practice.
---
Capitalism kills people in a far away land so that the people back home get to enjoy the fruits of the extracted profit. Just because they're brown and speaking a different language doesn't make it any better. That was colonialism during the 1700s and 1800s, it was the legacy of US imperialism during the 1900s, and now it's happening just the same as it ever was in the Middle East.
---
Just like a huge portion of OSRS players will keep playing even if MTX is added and they don't like it. 80% of the people who say "I'll quit if this passes!" Are straight up lying for karma.
---
I think at least 25% would still vote no, the people who sell bonds on the ge would for example

the only problem I have with private servers is that they always make modifications to the game that either make it way to easy or not fun to play. But the problem is that the ones that try to be authentic always shut down because no one plays on them.

That‚Äôs funny, I was being sarcastic, but it‚Äôs funny that people would vote no cause it‚Äôs true

Honestly I think your best bet breaking negative thought patterns would be by talking to a therapist. There is no shame in asking for help, and they can help you find productive outlets to improve your self esteem. 
---
If you‚Äôre a fellow murrican and seeing a therapist isn‚Äôt a possibility due to finances etc., I would just stress to you that your thoughts and how you perceive yourself are not always in tune with reality. Negative thought loops may come, but You can‚Äôt dwell on them. Examine those thoughts and let them go, float downstream. Don‚Äôt get too caught up in the past and future,  as that is conducive to high anxiety. Try to really focus on the present for the time being. Sorry if that sounds incredible corny but it‚Äôs helped me break out of negative thought loops before.
---
looking at the actual player statistics that clearly isn't true. i permanently quit rs3 after SOF and came back for osrs. believe it or bot, i have other shit i want to play and i have a full time job. with osrs going back down a path that makes the game leas fun and valuable to me, im likely going to plunge back into factorio or satisfactory to fill my "non action" game slot. 
---
everyone i know irl is not that dedicated to their mmo of choice, though some of the extreme devotees here would likely have trouble leaving.
---
Underrated comment, thanks for this! So true.

True, but that's because osrs is still alive. After EoC private servers thrived. If it died, Private servers would probably make a comeback.

A promotion with free membership is fine, as long as they deal with the bot issue.

Anything besides that is MTX, and not acceptable.

Why are you trying to ruin the game with mtx?

It is definitely. . . Whole point being that he knows Mod Matt very well and isn‚Äôt shocked about the statement.

Nah if he left over that I'm sure he wouldn't be streaming the game, if I quit my job over how they handled shit I wouldn't give them more money and views. I think he got a better job but who knows.

How about an item you can purchase for $7 and it gives you 4m rsgp with no limit to what you can spend it on?

Oh wait...
---
Back in the day when it was browser based there were ads, for f2p
---
Dropping $100 just for purple skin and membership and calling it mtx is a reach. I see that as added bonus of being a prime member. If you're dumb enough to buy Amazon prime just so you can benefit from a membership trial and purple skin then that's on you.
---
this isnt even mtx. there's no transaction taking place. with twitch purple skin, you had to BUY twitch prime.
---
No you (:

Oh god, I was only kidding, I didn't even know this was a thing already!

i would say the runefest ticket one was the first. always hated that i couldn't get that prize
---
Bonds make Jagex money - F2P makes 0 money (the game is free duh) but costs money to host the servers. Jagex's logic was that the cost to run F2P servers needs to be offset by the price of bonds. They didn't want to release F2P without bonds, and MMK stated this explicitly.
---
Your talking like 100% of the community has the same mindset. Can you take a step back and think for a second. All the DMM tourneys that transpired, jagex spent like what 300k? On winnings alone , not even including costs or advertisements. That shows you that they‚Äôre serious about new players. Now the current player base has new players but how much? Who knows, only jagex. The question is, the nastolgia (oldschool players) , how many of them are there compared to the new players. Because eventually the vote that matters will be just a vote, because the group majority becomes group minority and new players /kids are at the majority

Man if I wanted a game with MTX I‚Äôd play any of the new games that came out this year.  I‚Äôm not doing it with Old School.  Every business in the world doesn‚Äôt need to see some unsustainable exponential growth to be successful.  Build something to last instead of catering to investors and shareholders.  Video games have been a huge part of my life but seeing company after company fuck me over for cents on the dollar makes me want to find a more fulfilling hobby.
---
Membership could already be bought with real money before bonds.  
---
  
---
Bonds I don't think give anyone an advantage when someone like me who has been 99% f2p for over a decade and half now just joined members and can make 1m an hour easy.
---
Exactly. Classic wow has the real potential to put a serious dent in the growing osrs community we‚Äôve seen the past year. 
---
It‚Äôs so dumb they‚Äôd try to pull something like this, it‚Äôs like they enjoy milking whales than having a successful enjoyable game. It has been clear from the start of mtx and jagex that it will kill there game. They know exactly what they‚Äôre doing no matter what sort of terms or phrases they describe implementing mtx.
---
It‚Äôs all the same, they‚Äôve walked down this path in the past and have seen the results. If they choose it again I hope a lot of people completely abandon ship and let it go up in flames.
---
Good to hear someone at least has some ideas

It's not really hypocritical if you're a competitive person. It doesn't matter about your moral stance on an issue because if you're in a competition, you're probably going to want to use every advantage at your disposal.

I think it all depends on perspective.

If you read this with the perspective that Ash incorrectly assumed MMK was an advocate, the tweet reads completely differently.
---
Ash is a master of choosing his words carefully.
---
is the grotesque guardians instance like vorkath's in that items on the ground take longer to disappear?
---
Fun fact: Jagex added him as a quest boss in The Mighty Fall and you can actually choose to spare or kill him. Permanently.
---
Not enough

Well first, I would recommend that you do Animal Magnetism and get yourself an accumulator. Will save you money and is your ‚Äúbest in slot‚Äù cape item

Happy cake day

Why do people in world 302 GE seem to stand differently and hold staffs horizontally?

What about it? Lol he's copying and pasting a comment to add on to the ongoing memes right now. Totally normal

This was in the really early RuneScape Classic clients too. When you dig through the source you find some weird survey stuff they tried to do. If anybody's interested I can probably dig them up.

Polling this is exactly the same as polling any other update. They always have the ability to add mtx whether you want them or not. They aren't polling mtx. If you read what they are polling it's skin color changes and house themes. 
---
They literally have already done this with the twitch skin color and nobody had a problem with it.
---
\&gt;  A lot of right wingers 
---
I see you don't research things very well. If you take a polls on the subject, consumer confidence with nike nearly dropped with all demographics even though they made a decent short term profit.
---
Could just as easily swap it into Bryophyta's drop table. Was it a conscious decision to not put the scim in either one?  She drops a hell of a lot of rune items as well.
---
Now somebody do the one with the guy losing his shit laughing in that interview
---
if there are too many people on the screen at once (like in a trade world ge) the game defaults to rendering people in default poses to lessen server strain.
---
Go away
---
I can confidently speak for the entire RS3 playerbase when I say we don't want you guys to have to deal with this bullshit either.
---
OSRS is the prime example of a modern video game *thriving* without MTX. We don't want that taken away. The success of OSRS is the only hope we have, however slim it is, that RS3 can be salvaged and brought back from the decrepit state it's been in for 7 years.

You do realize that people who target him for protesting give him more attention than if they were to just let him silently kneel? Just a thought, I hate football regardless

I would rather pay $12 a month and just have them stop this madness.

Yeah, Swampletics Exposed its a lot better than this. And im pretty sure I've seen more posts that are way better than this one. But thx dude, I apreciate you liked it.

Never voted before but everyone complaining made me go on and read it and ended up voting yes on all. Everyone overreacting over people paying to get cosmetic content a few weeks before everyone else
---
I already did haha
---
Comprehensive list, I like it
---
guess you were kinda right? I mean 2k upvotes..
---
That's true, but the way to go about this would be using one-time recovery codes or government ID validation, not SMS
---
As for today, though, your best bet is just adding 2FA to your email and that guarantees your recovery has 2FA

why are your skills censored

You have to hit something at the top like ‚Äúvote‚Äù before it lets you actually click yes or no. It lets you read all the options first,

I was going to post something like this, but in all seriousness if a cape just like this cape into the game, I would vote yes to this partnership idea. I would LOVE a cosmetic piece of perfectly delicious pizza cape.
---
This sub is on fire lately.
---
Maybe do some Slayer (you can use your cannon) so you can use broad bolts.
---
This is deliberate. The best weapon should be hard to get. It gives you a long term goal.
---
If you're feeling lazy, the rune sword is quite close and is very easy to acquire.
---
Your first 2-3 months will be paid for with ¬£¬£¬£¬£$$$$. Once you get decent stats you can grind a bond instead.  For example I get a bond before starting a block of night shifts. Then grind gargoyles semi afk on those shifts until I make back that bond. Doesn‚Äôt take long. Rest of that membership time is spent enjoying myself. 
---
The game as f2p isn‚Äôt even comparable to the game with membership. It‚Äôs a huge difference.

You know, I'm something of a Raimi memer myself

All the first lines of the polls look good I‚Äôd love a lot of that content, but as soon as you read the partnership line it crashes and burns....
---
Great rewards, now figure out where they can go to actually be EARNED jagex!!
---
I don't even have a problem with this inherently, if in a perfect world it was literally ONLY cosmetics and you can make yourself look like an absolute fool, if they didn't have all the other bullshit that makes the game unbearable.
---
You poor, sweet, summer child.

Retail wow has mtx, classic won't have any. Unless you know of some specific ones I didn't hear about?

We've seen this happen to rs2. They promise things, start with little MTX.

Because as I stated earlier, people tryna use Mat‚Äôs comment as him hating on Mtx are misconstruing it I believe.
---
Don't want another pure to be ruined by accidental leveling.
---
I see no problem with this. That dude is making my membership free. So what if he has slightly higher slayer xp. If he can't get a fire Cape and b gloves hes not gaining much anyway
---
How are you so certain 90% of OSRS players would leave if malicious MTX enters the game? Squeal of Fortune caused no where as that many players to leave while EoC caused like 50% to do so.
---
I‚Äôm gonna come back to this and laugh when they ignore us, see you soon!
---
I like boys for wanting more POH themes? lol.
---
Oh LOL nice
---
No u
---
No you both
---
To be fair, the report system could do with an update. Making it easier to choose the right option on mobile and adding tooltips to the various categories would be nice.
---
Ok
---
Swamp cosmetics lol...
---
That is primarily because the SCBA mask could face interference if you have facial hair. That said, people like myself grow their beards out until forced to shave during inspection.
---
This is probably a dumb question, but what movie is the original footage from?
---
Yea, no, I've poured thousands of hours into rs3. I like both rs3 and osrs, and I feel scrapping rs3 would be a bad idea.
---
Just voted no for all of them.
---
Ah I can see that to. Either way my tinfoil hats been on all day
---
True, because there are different levels of MTX severity. But what about cosmetics like the ones proposed in the polls? Wouldn't they be more benign than bonds as you can't P2W with them?
---
You're using the old outdated Fandom Wiki. Chances are any info on there is outdated.
---
This would be wholesome af, though conflicting nonetheless
---
Osrs and rs3 are completely different games lmao if osrs goes to the rs3 route then runescape will die
---
Haven‚Äôt been on in a few weeks, hopped on to do my part and vote no
---
they talked about mtx mounts.
---
I voted yes to all thinking I was doing the opposite bruh I‚Äôm so sorry all
---
I give him maybe a week at most
---
I loved all the lamps on the table lmao
---
by buying a bond you are keeping the demand for bonds high, meaning someone is going to buy a bond with irl money so in a way you are supporting mtx.
---
Yeah but you're gonna come back. Or not even quit to begin with. The problem with your statement is that it's based in fantasy. U really think you're gonna just "cut back" on your addiction? Doesn't work that way pal.
---
Time to quit lol. There is not winning, I‚Äôve been played. Will go sub to WoW
---
A lot of them seem like they would fit well within castle wars and it would be awesome to see that played more
---
Most of the "features" are not seen as OP because most active players are in "endgame"/"lategame" content. If RS3 had a much more diverse and active playerbase those "features" would most definitely be OP.
---
It isn't coming out of your wallet.
---
Throw in a free video that will sit in some drawer forever and then someday throw away lol
---
I'm not arguing about ethics or overpoweredness.  I'm saying the long term effect on the game will be negative.  Sorry if this is a copy paste but I've written it like 20 times and I think this is the best I can summarize it.  
---
The thing is nobody is going to give Jagex a thing of value unless they make money off the partnership. This means the ingame item/skin given must add enough value to push someone to spend real life money. This is why they are so dangerous.
---
If they update the game and add (free) options that are awesome looking, then the partnership options lose value. Fewer people will be willing to spend real life money when something cooler exists ingame. This will mean fewer people participating in the partnership and the agreements being worth less.
---
This causes an inverse relationship between short term profit and quality of product. It is better in the short term to make a worse product and sell a better one, even if it means a worse game in the long term.
---
If you want to see this in action look at RS3. The summoning creatures still use 2008 models, but you can buy really cool skins. The pets that take hundreds of hours to earn have minimal effort put in while the drakes you can buy look amazing. There hasn't been new melee armor since 2013 but you can buy visual upgrades. Cosmetics very rarely enter the game but you can buy spins to get cool looking fashion.
---
With partnerships it's no different. There is the same profit motive, the same necessity for added value, the same necessity for exclusivity, and the same necessity for someone to pay money for it. Even though it's not MTX, partnerships will absolutely destroy OSRS if they become the norm.
---
Just need one 12 year old with moms credit card

Can‚Äôt wait for poll results #smackdown #SwipeLeftOnPartnerships

Or from minigames, diarys or mbe some easier Bosses.

I served, didn't get offended by him kneeling. More offended he was drawing in sponsorships for his "brave stand" while being a mediocre player, only reason he was still on a team after that. It's really uncool to personally profit just to be a media push for a company; he could've gone to rallies, or protests, or outreaches but instead he made some bucks.   
---
The anthem wasn't originally part of the game, it was paid for by the armed forces to promote the services (aka recruiting for the military) and wound up being something they did anyways (still getting paid though).
---
Don't really care for celebs stating opinions to be parroted by others, but this one was reaching a demographic that is part of the problem, and deserve to have it interrupt their "safe space".
---
Also, stop virtue signalling, it's like bandwagoning  but more offensive. There is a problem, don't get mad they made you watch during like the first 30 seconds of your sportsball. Grow a fucking pair.
---
Will also be the last day I play this childrens cookie clicker. You've done it before and the corporate greed will do it again.
---
Because this in principle is how it started with RS3: Solomen's General Store ring a bell? Wasn't too long once SOF happened and then that turned into full out MTX.
---
Why don‚Äôt companies realize MTX works, for a time, and then the playerbase burns out and moves on...
---
Example? RS3 lol?
---
When will they learn that if you want people to play your game and subscribe; give them content to PLAY not achievements you can BUY.
---
I already achieved my paycheck, I don‚Äôt need my video games trying to do the same...
---
read in torvesta voice
---
Okay 1 skill because everything can stack in your inventory.
---
Exactly. These polls could easily get rigged since results are hidden. We have no way of knowing any of our votes will matter this time. You need to understand the actual owners of Runescape have the final word. Jagex can try to pursuade them and let us have our say using the polling system but that's it. If the owner of Rs says release MTX in osrs it has to be done. Rules change. Promises dont mean much.
---
People are too busy freaking out over something stupid right now to comment. Venezuelan farmers were never a problem.
---
What if this poll is the real reason that they hid poll results? Haha
---
Sit
---
True, though what I mean is that there is no value of 'taking the short term profit'
---
Because you value things based on expected future cash flows. Probably 50%+ of the value your investor gets is from when they sell the company. Focusing on the short term will decrease that.
---
We shouldn't be talking about liquidation and assets here. Keep in mind Jagex isn't a very asset intensive business--in no scenario is Jagex the type of company a PE firm would look at and think its more worth it to liquidate than to own the company for a couple of year (because think about it, a company with Jagex's profits each year vs. look at their fixed assets). 
---
Though to be frank I don't use quarterly growth as much as annual growth or TTM
---
&gt; someone like me who has been 99% f2p for over a decade and half now just joined members and can make 1m an hour easy.
---
Cool, I am willfully playing in f2p, even though I could buy like 100 bonds from my mains bank.
---
It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Is it OLD SCHOOL RUNESCAPE? No, not even close. Why create old school runescape from an old backup and then continue to fuck it up AGAIN? You think they‚Äôd learn from their mistakes. No, they‚Äôre following their same footsteps as before
---
B
---
Remember the twitch prime purple skin? 1 year ago.
---
Woah there, don't start giving Jagex those ideas, things are fine as they are.
---
They give out 14 days free membership through twitch prime which gets exploited by botters so theres no cost to mass make accounts. So yes.
---
Because they sold out for a self righteous media push. [Remember the Pepsi commercial?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfCiV6ysngU)
---
Why are you angry with Jagex that they are polling something you dont like??? The point of polling is to tell them that you dont like it
---
If u woulda dropped ur Slayer cape it would of stayed untrimmed
---
üëç
---
Cosmetics get disabled in wildy
---
I haven‚Äôt played in months, but I sure as hell logged in to vote no just for others sake. Not that it matters anyway lmfao they hide the poll results so they can do it regardless of our wants. Same old Jagex, in it for the money. They‚Äôll lose their players. Glad I stopped playing it!
---
Even at 5000 which is extremely generous that makes up .016% of the subreddit that seem to give a shit and agree with you. Less than 2%. Also the best apart about you guys threatening to quit is how you all act like you aren't hopelessly addicted to the game. You'll sit there and make poorly rendered chairs for 13 hours and turn around talking about "I'LL QUIT" no you won't. And if you do you'll just go to some other time sink mmo and talk nonstop about how it's so much better than RS. Then you will swallow your pride and come back. Because you are a no lifer. Simple as that.
---
&gt;If they're so profitable, instead of funnelling RuneScape money into the parasites that own them, why doesn't Jagex buy themselves out when their parent company is ready to sell them
---
Because unfortunately the workers, the ones who create the value are paid a wage instead getting the full value of their labour. Under the current system the owners get all of the profit while doing none of the work and holds massive power over the employees. 
---
This is a super vasic marxist critique of the capitalist mode of production.

You can't just say there's no drama and expect this to just go away lol are you fucking stupid

Doesn't really matter if you can just buy the xp back later on...

any proof lol?
---
The custom house designs seem cool, OSRS sure gets alot of awesome POH updates.
---
While cosmetics are arguably the most benign form of MTX (compared to loot crates and pay to win), considering their prior track record I can certainly see where this could be a slippery slope, as they aren't afraid to make hugely game breaking MTX.
---
Ya we get it
---
Do you deny it?
---
Categorically.
---
I love the Office
---
Why does it matter what it's about if you're just gonna vote no anyway
---
Hes praying mage... against abyssal demons.
---
I‚Äôm just curious to see what extent it‚Äôs going too that‚Äôs all.
---
I haven't been on in months but‚Äî NOW Jagex wants to hide poll results?!
---
No he isn't...... if you take the entire tweet into context, Ash is effectively mocking OP for thinking he knows MMK better than him. 
---
This majority of this subreddit can be legendarily stupid sometimes..
---
This is exactly how i‚Äôm feeling.
---
Everyone is talking about quitting IF mtx are released to osrs, honestly the fact that they poll this tells me enough it‚Äôs more of a WHEN mtx gets released into mtx
---
when their new client was in beta the color grading was so much more subdued/natural looking, but come release they increased saturation :/
---
ill post screenshots later.
---
I'm sure they are under some strict fucking rules to not post on anything related to the partnership controversy. They also probably feel the same way. Maybe not quite as strongly, but I doubt any of them who actually care about the game think this is a good idea. All it does is set precedence for cosmetics to be added in a way that is outside of in game rewards.
---
This
---
If it‚Äôs rigged then it doesn‚Äôt matter what you vote yet every other post is telling people to vote no. You can keep complaining about it but if it‚Äôs rigged it doesn‚Äôt matter at all so people can stop being annoying about it.
---
&gt;because think about it, a company with Jagex's profits each year vs. look at their fixed assets
---
TBF I didn't consider that. That's a fair point.
---
I guess my main issue is that so far, every time that Jagex has switched hands, MTX has become more and more invasive, and the company has profited more and more from them despite the declining RS3 playerbase (though it seems to finally be catching up to some extent as of the latest financial report.)
---
He's having a meme and following the tide, let it be.
---
Lmao yea!!!
---
Working as intended
---
But we wanted dragon claws.
---
I don‚Äôt know about a problem but there‚Äôs definitely a ton playing the game. Bots are way more of a problem then people actually playing the game
---
I never said this poll is rigged
---
&gt; entire
---
I didn't state that in my comment.
---
Although I think it can, because OSRS has a polling system:
---
1. MTX cosmetics get added
---
2. Old playerbase gets annoyed, quits playing.
---
3. New playerbase loves cosmetics.
---
4. Polls will have different results.
---
5. The game fundamentally changes.
---
While the old playerbase care about the fundamentals, new players don't. Because they have no nostalgic feeling when playing.
---
Nah it wasn't just camo's it was also the peacekeeper
---
The Peacekeeper is featured in the Revolution downloadable content pack for Black Ops II. 
---
https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Peacekeeper
---
The Peacekeeper is the first ever additional multiplayer downloadable weapon made available for players in the Call of Duty series. It is classified as a submachine gun but acts as an assault rifle/SMG hybrid, including traits such as a submachine gun's mobility and an assault rifle's range, balanced with low damage and a medium fire rate. 
---
https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Revolution_(DLC)
---
There was also the extra create a class slots you could buy. Black Ops 2 was really the let's throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. Can't say what happened after that because Blops 2 was the last one I played; not regretting that either.
---
&gt; Yeah but the proposed rewards sound pretty dope
---
and now imagine that devs can put it in game and include it in price of membership and not having to pay additional money. 
---
Toy will allow for partnership and more and bigger things will be put behind another paywalls.
---
It's a meme from the gay pride event.
---
True
---
The timing is absolutely impeccable. If they did it like two years ago, then it wouldn't be suspicious because companies never think long term.
---
Mhm well Insight Venture Partners had a huge stake in Jagex for 5-10 years I believe before they started with MTX bs, so anything could happen really.
---
And you were absolutely right when you said there's no drama but the OS Reddit wants there to be so they can all make the same meme a million times.
---
&gt; I didn‚Äôt know you could do that, I‚Äôll definitely be doing that as well.

After submitting the request, you'll get an email asking you to confirm it, and upon confirmation, your account is wiped.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs freeing, honestly. I was addicted to the game, and this was probably one of the only things that could push me to quit
---
Same; I'm hoping it'll be enough to keep me away though. I've deleted my account and started over a few times now, but this last time I was really burned out with doing quests and skilling. I think this time will be the last time.
---
I subscribed from my phone so I had to cancel it through apple, and they didn‚Äôt ask of course. I‚Äôm not sure how it works online
---
I feel you brother. I'm in the same boat. My membership expired two days ago actually and I didn't re-up this time, won't until Jagex responds about all of this. I enjoy this game, I've played since 2004, but I cba to grind if they're going to go down this road
---
Their only game to play is OSRS tho.
---
Don't get how y'all can play f2p
---
Delete your account or BS
---
This stuff is polled. If it‚Äôs coming into the game anyway then it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to me. It would make a difference to me if it were actual content, but a pretty skin for your house doesn‚Äôt mean anything. 
---
I‚Äôll vote no on all this stuff because it sounds gaudy, but they‚Äôre gonna do partnerships with or without our consent, it‚Äôs just a matter of what cosmetic it ends up being.
---
He's literally complaining about store mounts in RETAIL WoW. Lol
---
Sorry, that was a promo. We‚Äôre voting no to promos because someone called them MTX. Get on the bandwagon
---
Oh hey alti!
---
I think I might be a nazi now?
---
At least wait until the final results. Don't delete an account only to remake a new one when you find out they won't do anything.
---
If the poll fails nothing will be implemented, don't see the point of unsubbing now unless you're just paying with bonds
---
Gotta be a mem
---
Bye lol
---
Do you understand that this entire poll shows rewards from MTX and not through gameplay?
---
This is what destroyed rs2. They started with these small harmless updates then released squeal of fortune. Remember?
---
Can I have it
---
At lvl 77 slayer I farm 30-40k slayer exp a day, is it a slow rate?
---
Sure wish poll results weren‚Äôt hidden on this one...
---
Already switched to bonds
---
lmao guess you'll never get to 1 friend.
---
Actually... Jagex says there will be no MTX (shortcut for Microtransaction) even on oldschool RS however they want something they call "partnerships" which is essentialy advertisements. Did it help?
---
&gt; they dont need more money as is. they have achieved record profit numbers
---
Do you have a source for this, just curious?
---
It would allow me to keep playing my main while I work on my iron on the side or vice versa.
---
Sir they made record profits last year, They have **more than** double the profit margin of EA for christmas sake. The company is literally rolling in money.
---
Gr8 b8 m8 i r8 0/8
---
Need a bond?
---
If this was intended 'sarcsasm' from God Ash then I'm sorry but he worded that really poorly. Nothing screams sarcasm, sarcasm would be for example: I worked with matt K for 6 years I definitely know what he wants for this game I know the man inside out.
---
ok, and we can bully you too.
---
Thanks for the decent reply, im thoroughly surprised.
---
And I kind of get what you mean now... I never pictured partnerships to sell real products that give you in-game features. One reason I don't like RS3 is because it is littered with hundreds of these cosmetic pieces, and together it looks so artificial. Your logic has convinced me that eventually OSRS would become the same if it were to follow this path. 
---
That said, do you remember the chrome googles you could get in RS3 by simply playing the game from google chrome? That's an example of a partnership that didn't go too far. Things like that could help the game. 
---
&gt;Fewer people will be willing to spend real life money when something cooler exists ingame. 
---
I don't agree, partnerships are always temporary, it's the excitement of the new promotion which leads to sales. McDonalds example. Ppl don't need mcdonalds, they can cook food at home, but they might be tempted to try a new product if they saw an ad. Similarly, players may buy because they want something cool &amp; new, even if everyone else gets it in 3 months time.
---
How often and what for are you using those balloons? Am I missing something in their usefulness? I seem to barely use it once a week
---
That was before they saw that mtx would kill the game though. They know how against mtx this community is. If they really did start to add legit mtx to osrs it would be the worlds most dumbest suicide of the game.
---
well they already said they arent putting dev time towards the cosmetic items if they can't profit from them so why would they poll that
---
I work in a polar opposite field to investing and have only a couple of friends in economics, so this conversation has been very enlightening, thanks guys.
---
So, you literally reposted the top post in the sub?
---
And about half of that was profit wasn't it?
---
Earning 100% more than you spend just isn't enough, clearly...
---
When is wow classic releasing again?
---
My bank has 20 mil but all in mem items xD
---
Thought wouldn't have to play for a long time..
---
Short answer: No
---
No result for: PKing in RS3
---
Did you mean: Sand Casino?
---
The twitch prime purple skin that was given during a twitch prime partnership was free to all players immediately after the partnership period ended. It ran July 26-September 19th. On the 20th of September it was free to all. 
---
While your comment isn‚Äôt incorrect, it doesn‚Äôt seem likely that jagex would go that route of making it extremely long periods of time for inaccessibility. They want players to like the idea.
---
And then theres the fact that all the poll questions were worded ‚Äúis this an ok cosmetic item to give from the partnership program‚Äù and not ‚Äúshould we do the partnership program‚Äù.
---
And you have to set those between every single interaction.
---
AHK lets you leave it on single and still withdraw/bank everything in a single tick.
---
So overall, that part is slower.

IDK what your rage boner is against AHK for, but there's a good reason people who tryhard EHP still use it.

It's dead because of EOC and you can't have cosmetics in the wild or nobody would know what gear you're wearing.

Well I‚Äôm not sure if this is viable but I‚Äôm sure people would make a website or something where you could check live poll results before voting if that was a thing. But then again I don‚Äôt think anyone would care enough to look
---
Thanks! 
---
Yeah I agree with that but I'd wager that it's more unlikely that a hacker would get both emails associated with an account so the affected player still has a means of communication with jagex.
---
You forgot to add the frame before where the mouse has full HP, and you hit a zero first lol
---
It doesnt matter if theyre public or private. They could just as well put arbitrary numbers in the public results. You can only trust that the numbers are. accurate. At least private results ensure that bias is kept minimum
---
And they would‚Äôve got away with it if it weren‚Äôt you dumb kids!
---
Id say im going to miss you but i already play with private/public off and hide entitys, none of you exist anyway may aswell be npcs spitting the same karma farming jargen each update.
---
So satisfying!
---
Old runescape good
---
Mtx bad
---
Give me all your awards
---
Yeah fuck right off to RS3 ty
---
i just couldn‚Äôt find a good picture if a 2 hitsplat
---
All of that is irrelevant though, The nicer looking and higher effort of the 2 pets is paid for.
---
Reads like the complete opposite to me, besides, everything will be polled regardless. If these specific changes don't bother you but you're scared of what it might bring in the future, then just vote no in the future?
---
The way I see it, thats just a bunch of cosmetics we would've never had that will get implemented because of these promos which is a good thing (except that home teleport where you draw above you and float, that doesn't sound good).
---
Bonds bad, payed to look cool bad, pay to win bad, this meme bad.
---
So you're saying OSRS is safe because we have a polling system and there is nothing that the owners of jagex can do about it?
---
That is 100% true. I agree with you man. Like I said. OP took that to conspiracy levels that didn‚Äôt make sense. I was just trying to point out that Jamflex knows their analytics and saying they completely don‚Äôt know that an American holiday effects the number of players logged in is inaccurate. But like you said, it‚Äôs percentage based, so it doesn‚Äôt matter for the poll.
---
I agree, but I'm pretty sure this post is a joke
---
ah, varrock east bank i see. say goodbye to your account n00b.
---
But the polls are percentage based, not numbers based?
---
Apologies for that, polls should be available once again.
---
It literally is what happened to the entire gaming industry you buffoon. It starts small, and gets worse and worse. First it's slightly less content in the main game, and more dlc. Then it's cosmetic microtransactions, removing unlockable content in favor of purchasable content. Then they're not cosmetic purchases anymore, then lootboxes.
---
Do you not remember people being just as angry about microtransactions years ago as they are about lootboxes today? That's how business greed works in this industry. You make little pushes, so that the last one doesn't seem so bad. You can make people accept just about anything if you push it out slowly, in increments.
---
I wasn't ragging him, I even killed him and I have proof of it, I was rushing him in hopes of one shotting him quick enough to gain a plus 1 item from him, what's the point of fighting him in long fights when I can one shot him in 1 second. Think before you speak. It's the wilderness anything goes, they gave him streamer favoritism in this case.
---
30-40k is like a good 1 to 2 hours afk slayer, all depends on how much you play but 30k is pretty slow imo
---
Bro predatory mtx? Do you hear yourself. You can literally just not spend your money. Grow up and stop spewing out talking points.
---
time-gated payment loyalty programs are different from time-gated releases from early access payment models. Although different, if they promote any sort of content that provides a competitive advantage, it achieves the same effect because anyone who cares will feel obliged to pay for it. 
---
It's why cosmetics paired with the second are 'better'. Though it can easily be no better for the integrity of the game if the company is unable to restrain itself to only a few discrete promotions a year or if the early access duration is too long. Unfortunately for Jagex, previously they haven't demonstrated they can do either of those well.
---
its apart of a OP borderline cheat client, which has some plugins that are shady as fuck but also has some nice QOL ones, such as entering your bank pin with the keyboard, right clicking a quest in the quest list to open a slayermusiq guide L00L, and supplies used tracker.
---
In that client it has a more configurable menu entry swapper, but im hesitant to link it as im unsure whether or not its allowed.
---
There's a goblin nobody would feel guilty of stabbing for 10gp.
---
Locked behind premium bonds. Which I honestly wouldn't mind, they gotta make money somehow.
---
Well congratulations man, keep the luck coming
---
This explains the huge deflation of item prices right now.
---
Alright, gonna unsubscribe to this sub for a week cause I don't want these whiny shitposts spamming my reddit.
---
It's unavailable so jagex can quickly edit the results
---
I literally spend hours unlocking cool cosmetics in other games. When they are free/microtransactions, I dont really care about them at all. Looking cool has to be earned for it to be cool. If everyone is cool, noone is cool
---
For sure, I now multiple cases like this where people received 14 day bans for doing worse than what I did, I got specifically targeted because I picked the wrong streamer (AOAAtube). I wish they can hear out my explanation because it's not only completely plausible but I'm telling it how it is and not lying.
---
You know doing that is a bannable offence right?
---
What happened?
---
Have you just found a foolproof solution to rigged poles!? ... no
---
They are useful ingame, but also a great way for a  level 75 to buy bandos with their mums credit card.
---
To busy adding 999k votes for them to pass
---
How long ago was this?
---
You guys are too addicted to quit anyway xoxo
---
No. At least not only. Bonds are ok because:
---
 1) It gives the average player easy access to membership without having to pay for it. High level players need to invest maybe 1-2h/two weeks to sustain membership.
---
2) Even though players can buy membership without having invested money into it, someone had to. So Jagex still gets their money
---
3) Compared to rwt where people buy gold, bonds don't generate gold, only changes possession. 
---
4) If players have "legal" access to gold, there's less incencitive to go on gold-selling websites buying gold/items that were generated by bots.
---
Pro tip, don't say things that people disagree with if you don't wanna be downvoted
---
Me too, thanks
---
looks like 2019 is the year I finally quit osrs
---
Thanks
---
I'll do a complete 180 on promotions if they add a swanton bomb emote
---

---
Thank you!
---
I dont even go in for the dds on the pot trick. Ican i post vids here? I know im in the right
---
I know I‚Äôm probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but I‚Äôm with you... if it‚Äôs purely cosmetic who actually gives a fuck?
---
I agree that the xp boosts shouldn‚Äôt EVER come into osrs, but costmetics don‚Äôt effect how you play at all, while keeping the company that runs our game with money... which keeps the game open... sounds like a win win to me?
---
The only reason they perma for this is if you have been doing it as a constant to the one player, streamer or not they have stated this is harrasment and banable. 
---
In the end this is jagex ip and you own nothing not even your account and they do not even need to provide a reason or chance to appeal if they dont want to.
---
Toxic BP renamed to venomous BP so it wont scare sponsors away

---
They already make a lot of money for such a small cost that it takes to keep the game going. It just had it's most profitable year to date. This is just a cashgrab to make the shareholders happy. I think a lot of jmods are hoping this doesn't pass but can't say anything about it publicly.
---
You literally have to go through the the options menus to change what Xp you get from combat. Its not intuitive at all, and I spent a good 10 minutes looking for it. (And that was back when I was heavily invested in RS3 and played it alot.
---
ill let you figure that one out.
---
Jagex already have the partnership signed your correct, it‚Äôs now just if we get cosmetic only benefits from it.... I mean you didn‚Äôt complain about the free membership they gave as apart of the partnership the past 2 times...
---
Holy shi-
---
Don't care about your no vote. I'm voting yes and I rly don't even play osrs. I've made like 400m in 2 hours from free keys we get for Treasure Hunter so I'd like osrs to get it so we can have more possibilities of gp making.
---
Im looking on the stream. What timestamp can i find you at?
---
It's ok Ana.. think of the fashionscape..   LOL
---
They also said OSRS would have a seperate subscription fee and would receive no updates.
---
They already turn a large profit, mate. This next proposal is just plain greedy.
---
While that is true I don‚Äôt like them throwing out perms for people who dont deserve them. Makes me feel like im going to get permed for something stupid
---
It always worries me when more options get added to oldschool because that's how runescape 3s technical-book-requiring menus with sub menus and lists and lists of settings started
---
I remember when Hitler reacted to the end of free trade and the Wilderness.

I don‚Äôt get it

Both of them contributed to the death of the game.
---
MTX already exist with bounds?
---
Bullshit if he got banned for stream sniping. Don't want people finding your location? Don't broadcast it to the entire fucking internet
---
smallest brain on this sub lmao
---
Jagex Funfair!
---
&gt;With the price of prime I doubt that had that large of an impact
---
People buy hacked prime accounts for 10 cents
---
Introduce it? It already had bonds at that point.
---
Thanks! Now I can move to lvl 1 spiders!
---
But with more investment they will have more money to help the game grow and develop. Get a larger dev team, create more content, help fix existing problems.
---
These partnerships are to help both parties grow and expand. If they don't do them you end up with a game that has no new players thus declining membership, no money no new content...
---
Dead Game.
---
So what do you think you deserve then? How would you handle it if you were Jagex?
---
Really don't understand why people are voting no and panicking so much. Do all of you honestly think they would be so stupid as to add MTX into OSRS? It's suicide if they do and they know it. 
---
These cosmetic rewards from as partnerships are harmless, and could, ultimately result in a bigger player base which is only a good thing.
---
Bonds
---
I do not consider these cosmetic partnerships real MTX, but I wonder if they release actual MTX could you sue them for false advertisement and get a full refund for all your membership costs over the years?
---
A) Asmongold is stupid and narrow minded and doesn‚Äôt know how to google something.
---
B) the forms are asmongolds but 12 years old.
---
Mod MMG was the CEO of Jagex until 2014. All MTX were because of him. SoF and TH included. He said they wouldn't even add cosmetics, but went for P2W less than a year later.
---
Defender can be difficult if you go in blind, but spend 5 minutes watching that video above and it'll make your life 10 times easier. You don't need to memorize it, just have a rough idea of what to do. 
---
Collector's extremely easy, all you do is pick up the correct egg and load into hopper. 
---
Healer's easy so long as later in the waves you keep an eye on your teammates' HP and make sure to heal occasionally. Other than that just use the correct food on penance healers a few times. 
---
Honestly the most difficult part about all roles except for defender is just calling out on time. If you're using RuneLite, it has a timer that shows how long till you need to call again, so that's very handy.
---
I don't get why this sub loves bringing up irrelevant shit all the time. It doesn't reinforce your point in anyway.
---
I got perm banned for muling on dmm seasonal a few months back when every1 does it lol
---
I can but there were many of rushes in different periods of time, it would involve too much effort, but what are you calling BS on?
---
TBH I would have been fine with EoC and RS3 if it wasnt for the MTX fiesta. I prefer non-EoC, but the MTX completely killed it for me.  
---
I played RS from the release of bunny ears all the way to EoC. But as soon as the keys were buyable I did quit RS within a month.
---
yes, we do
---
Upvotes could have come after they voted the wrong thing.
---
&gt;This would piss me off immensely 
---
Lmao why 
---
Sensitive sally
---
There is more going on here than you getting banned for rushing. You should start on it now. Your on trial, good luck!
---
After you kill him he says that you‚Äôve been trying to kill him for three days lol
---
I voted yes because i like Donald trump
---
yeah haha it's gonna be scary
---
Prove it.
---
From reading the web page, isn't this referring to Publishing Partnerships and not necessarily a "peer to peer" partnership?
---
The wording seems to refer to Jagex helping a company develop and grow the other companies game through these means as a part of a partnership between the two companies, not necessarily implementing MTX into osrs as a part of these partnerships.
---
Whilst I hate this whole partnership thing, if my understanding is correct, I don't want to start lambasting Jagex without some degree of context.
---
Remember the Gillette commercial, now that was another level of condescending.
---
pls pay $11 to our partners to get your account restored
---
Micro transactions are terrible. I prefer surprise mechanics, those are quiet ethical.
---
and there are people trying to kill c engineer for years should they be banned?
---
Rushing bad
---
Wtf those are completely different, going after someone in deep wild, multi and risking gear isnt player harassment. You might as well say the people on 2k total worlds at revs are player harassing since they lock down the area.
---
If true im truly sorry for you, but imm be waiting for jmod smackdown
---
This list is not complete, and just of the exclusive items that could only be obtained through paying in one way or another. Actual tradeable items that can be bought are not even included in the list. I'm pretty sure I missed a lot too.  
---
I really like the ideas for the rewards that are proposed fro OSRS in the recent poll. I would love to see them in the game. But we must ask the team to add them in the game as rewards for achievements.  I would be totally fine if Jagex partnered up with brands to give away free weeks of membership, but like many have pointed out, this is not the right direction for the game and the community.
---
&gt;But this sub will probably be the downfall of osrs.
---
Implying Jagex isn't actively trying to kill their own game
---
Again
---
I follow the TBP sub as well so I was extra happy to see this.
---
You keep posting a 6 hour video, do you think everyone here has the time to syphon through a 6 hr video looking for a 30 second clip? I‚Äôm not.
---
Yeah but even people not on Reddit could be against it.
---
So still over 25% of people would in theory voted it down alone on here at least.
---
So basically should already be a fail.
---
Idn I just feel as if given the level of out rage it'll either be polled against, "Cause they didn't clarify it enough" or if it doesn't fail it's been rigged.
---
Nice
---
Rereading makes very little sense sorry. 
---
I mean, when people would have seen the polls being voted down they'd vote for what everyone else is voting.
---
Ah, I didn‚Äôt see the Q&amp;A, so wasn‚Äôt aware. Time to vote no on all 3 accounts :P
---
When I said "nobody said I was innocent," I meant in the general sense, not in this case, but I think there should be no infraction in this case because I know I did nothing wrong, if I did do something wrong then I think jagex should make the rules more clear when it comes to what "player harassment is" and if I you must give me an infraction for this then give me the same infraction you gave other people who did worse than me in the past, for people who actually ragged with crystal bows, which is only a 14 day ban. PVP bans should never result in a permanent ban.
---
Pretty bs if you got banned for that. Even if youre going for someone over and over again in deep wild multi that shouldnt be an issue.
---
I want to do revs in 2k+ total worlds but guess what? Players are apparently "harassing" me when they kill me over and over for trying to go there.
---
Some of the mods love the game, and don't want MTX, shareholders are the ones to blame. They either push mtx or get fired
---
dude framed was on the hunt for boaty for the longest time to get a clip for a pking content creators video lmao
---
it' not a 6 hour video, I purposely linked the vod at the point where the clip starts so watch from there, he dies like 3 seconds after the video starts
---
Your claimed intent is irrelevant for the JMod's judgement. 
---
You already got permamuted, and the streamer says you've been trying to kill them for 3 days. It's entirely within the JMod's discretion to decide what to do when a serial harasser strikes again.
---
Lets be honest, OP is probably leaving some info out.
---
Most of the people buy founder‚Äôs packs just to support the devs anyways.
---
You must be a nice person IRL.
---
thanks for the reminder, loging in NOW
---
Wow what
---
It's not irrelevant. People are making a stand against MTX by showing what happened the last time Jagex went down that road. This list shows beyond a glimmer of a doubt that the promise/statement Jagex made was complete shattered. Like the others who are making a stand, I am just pointing out what happened before, and that I hope this won't happen again.
---
is it 1 or 2 handed?
---
I think the leg drop thing from the new boss.
---
They made 98.5 million dollars last year. I think they can afford to hire more people for OSRS without resorting to partnerships. They already underpay their staff by a long shot compared to industry standard and have zero transferable skills learned in the job, so I don't think money is why the oldschool team is small.
---
They've already talked about it in the QnA you fucking brainlet
---
You know, if they didn‚Äôt spend about $200K+ on dmm yearly I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be in this position.
---
This is a relatively reasonable statement.
---
You're welcome.
---
Am I the only one who thinks it looks a bit rushed? :/
---
PvP is a disgrace, man. I see streamers threaten to have people banned for 'ragging' - engaging in PvP like you are supposed to? You don't want to be attacked by someone then I'll use the pVp'ers own logic against them - don't go into the wilderness (or PvP worlds).
---
I hope you get this sorted. I wanted to join in on the PvP scene, gave it a try and it was a waste of time. Being new to PvP I didn't know people's max hits etc. or really what I was doing. People assume everyone else is a pro and you get accused of all sorts.
---
This ban needs to be revoked and the mod who implemented needs to be reprimanded.
---

What‚Äôs it called?
---

---
From the task only area in Taverley Dungeon.
---
Not really because they were risking +1 items like claws or toxic staff, so I tried to gmaul one shot them. Doesn't deserve a permaban, if anything deserves a warning, which would still be pathetic because I've seen much worse fly in the wildy.
---
I think 'Grieving' is the word you're looking for.
---
Man, that's some bullshit.
---
Bludgeon the way to go then?
---
people are really gonna downvote you for saying "dont make fun of real people and call them ugly just because you dont like a thing their company did one time"
---
The gold farmers will just undercut
---
Ah yes, I too would rather see tons of bots, spammers and scammers over players training their account in an inefficient and AFK manner. 
---
How dare they play the game! Ugh, it makes me **mad**!
---

I wasn't rushing him for 3 days straight, I was rushing people in general for a week straight and stopped by popular clan chats to find pkers and on top of that I've seen multiple posts about raggers who were already perma muted get a warning ban for 14 days, rather take that then a perma ban.
---
Wait, that's how I read it. How did other people read it?
---
I got a feeling that Jmods will be staying away from the subreddit for the time being
---
I'd do that if they gave me another chance.
---
this was a good update for OSRS.
---
probably a standard 1/5000.
---
Lol RIP
---
My guess would he complained about streamer sniping/player harrassment ( don't want to be sniped/pked, theb don't stream yourself pking).
---
This will end with a jmod bringing up completely unrelated offences to justify their decision.
---
No but you see, they are not microtransactions.
---
They are tinydeals.
---
100% an ironman update yet the boss is in multi?
---
This reddit post looks on the way to being upvoted enough for exposure to jagex, but could just make a fresh twitter and post
---
The issue is not whether you were risking your house mortgage or not, the issue is you stream sniping someone for several days like you admitted. The community can do without you until you learn why what you did was wrong.
---
#OH FUCK THIS IS REALLY WHY THEY HID POLL RESULTS

---
You‚Äôre severely mistaken
---
Are you saying that removing splashers from Lumbridge will cause bots, spammers and scammers to appear there instead?
---
I do too, but I want to feel like it means something when i get it. To me, at least, rolling in on a new character and styling my house after Prifddinas or Morytania would feel like walking off Tutorial Island with full Bandos.
---
I mean, he wasn't the only streamer I rushed, I rushed multiple streamers but then again I was rushing everyone in sight for 5 days straight, so it was easier to target popular clan chats, to find pkers to rush.

---
Stream sniping is not punishable.
---
If the streamer doesn't want to get sniped, turn his stream off.
---
But they wont, because they want the best of both worlds.
---
The effort out into dialog in MMOs is garbage level.
---
The art should be consistent with the themes and genre of the game.
---
How is this hard to understand. "Lore friendly" just means that it all meshes visually. You don't have to give a shit about the atrocious filler dialog to care about how the game looks and feels as you play it.

'griefing' - grieving is like mourning

It‚Äôs not the first time we from rs3 have come to vote positively for you guys, and still we get shit talked for playing a game we enjoy :( half of us don‚Äôt even touch the MTX as we‚Äôre ironmen Btw
---
!remindme 1 year
---
Oh hey Torvesta.
---
They're not actually polling the marketing campaign, though, only potential rewards. They said in the Q&amp;A that business decisions weren't going to be polled, but the content of the game would. I assume they'll find some other perks if in game rewards continue to fail.
---
&gt;Stream sniping is not punishable

You're 100% wrong. That falls under player harassment.

I wasn't stream sniping, I was rushing for 5 rev caves for 5 straight days non stop, if jagex reviews my gameplay they can see that and occasionally I would check clan chats because it was easier to find pkers to rush. There's nothing wrong with that, its easy money.
---
I need to speak to a manager
---
I'm going to say what PvPers say to PvMers all the time.
---
If you don't want to get Pk'd, don't go to the wilderness (or PvP worlds). :)
---
I'm sorry but Jagex probably won't reply to you as they favour streamers over everyone else.
---
Also did my part during work break on mobile üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think 'Griefing' is the word you meant.  And no I was not looking for that word.  I was using "ragging" because that is what the person who I responded to was using and referencing.
---
Although it‚Äôs a shitty thing to do it really doesn‚Äôt deserve a perm ban
---
Sure,here it is:
---
I know following someone through world's to steal their kills is griefing, not sure if they consider it in the wildly with PvP when you're hunting someone multiple times. Would be interesting to see if there is a response on this one
---
Ok im sold on mtx now
---
wheres the jdmod smackdown
---
Ye just meet me at the rev caves in 5 mins.
---
Basically they want to add some cosmetic items behind a paywall and it could soon lead to MTX and ruin the game like RS3
---
better ways are higher risk/higher chance of getting flagged though.  i imagine splashing is tricker to bot-hunt because lots of legitimate accounts also do it and they'd behave similarly.  talking out of my ass of course, but a bot and a person can "set it and forget it" all the same.
---
How long did it take
---
Yo right? What the fuck are any of these retards saying?? Just don't step in the wildly if you don't want to die, it literally can't get more simple. Every fucking time you step in the wildly you should anticipate it being a fight for your life
---
poor mans Venenatis lol
---
jk, Gz!!!
---
 How to avoid that happening; step out of the wilderness.
---
Why would they
---
It's my favorite game tbh and every other game lags on my comp
---
Cry me a fucking river.
---
Not bad honestly
---
Why are you being pedantic about this you know people were wanting to know the reason? 
---
Why do you believe you were perma muted ? Evidence regardless.
---
Who the fuck cares if he used his stream. You‚Äôre choosing to broadcast everything you do - fuck off. Streamers are a fucking nuisance. 
---
Who cares if they went for him multiple times. Get your ass in PVP, then suck it up cause people won‚Äôt give two shits about your enjoyment - so be ready to suffer the consequences or don‚Äôt go out.
---
Also pretty funny how he desperately avoids explaining why he was permanently muted prior to this incident.
---
When I played Wow Vanilla and TBC would spend most of my time doing world pvp in contested areas. People would camp me, I would camp them. It's just the nature of being deep in a pvp zone. Or would spend days fighting with the same guy over and over because we wanted to farm the same stuff. Sounds like I would get banned these days if it was a steamer. I hate steamer culture.
---
They‚Äôve made Reddit posts about it and tweeted it out and mentioned it on their stream. This goes for every change that is made to a content blogpost. If you pay attention, you‚Äôll know about it. If not, you‚Äôll find out on the day of release.
---
Gotta push for that 2k for some mod to pm him and 5k for the mod to answer publicly in this thread.
---
These promotions aren't gonna be free you know. Hence the middle man scenario. You pay money and get in game items.
---
Just splash elsewhere?
---
Our patience has its limits!
---
You can still splash outside of that red marker, what's the issue?
---
Jagex needs to tread lightly right now and this isn‚Äôt the move
---
And completely reset your progress, nice
---
ty brother
---
Other than the offensive language none of those are reasons to be banned, let alone doing anything wrong. 
---
If you want to pk without being tracked then you turn you pm off and you don't broadcast your location to the world. That's basic shit.
---
I don't remember it was 5 months ago and even at the time I didn't remember.
---
I know haha, I play rs3 too. I think the aura thing is because of pvp, they give an unfair advantage
---
Isn‚Äôt harrasment for stuff like following people around just to insult them? And even then just ignore them.
---
Obviously they think this guy streams too. Lmao. People are idiots. ‚ÄúProvide proof!‚Äù Yet he doesn‚Äôt stream or just randomly record his gameplay ??! Wtf?
---
I hope you're wrong, I hope its good enough for mid-levels to do consistently as higher levels have zulrah/vork etc.  as that was what it was described as, can you imagine only being able to do barrows on 1 account/world at a time (and i know barrows armours are more useful than the shit this is dropping so that's unlikely but it was pitched at similar money/hour to barrows so should be pretty good for lower levels).   But on the other hand, I hope your right because going for the pet would be fucking awful if this is as popular as i hope it will be
---
Let's see you get banned for no reason.
---
I am, I don't like these arbitrary changes. They're confusing for players. It makes no sense.
---
That was my point.  Not sure how either of you interpreted my comment differently.
---
Or just remove splashing all together
---
Thank you. Wish more people actually understood this for what it is.
---
Yes.
---
Just remove splashing already
---
Look what we know is if the poll doesn't pass they won't pursue partnerships or partnerships with no MTX. The skin colours will still be out just without partnerships I presume.
---
I used to play Hearthstone and beat one of the top steamers at the time. Watched the VoD after and all he did was complain I was sniping sure dude.
---
The quotation marks
---
Lmao you know exactly why.
---
They already gave you another chance by perm muting you the last time you were harassing people. How many chances do you expect them to give you?
---
Just over an hour with a few people in the world
---
That depends on whether the partner is a paid service, we've only seen Twitch. Even if so, you're paying the service of the partner. Was it really a big deal to you when they did a Twitch partnership and you had to wait for the promotion to end? I'm still rocking the purple skin and didn't sign up.
---
I don‚Äôt play the game anymore because of all the random bullshit that happens in the game I just don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs worth wasting the time on you can lose everything at the snap your fingers see and hear about it way to much sadly
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
Good luck mate. Ive never pked, but fuck any pussy bitch that reports for dying in a pvp zone.
---
Im here for vindication or your smackdown
---
It's an anti hijack measure, where they lock the account because they think it may have been hacked. VPN might make it look like you logged in from two different locations in an impossibly short timeframe. It's happened to me before, you just need to prover ownership by recovering your account which should be fairly straightforward.
---
Warding fixes that
---
It is kind of a weird way to deal with the issue. Not sure I agree with it. It'll be interesting to see where the new to go splashing place is where there will just be a wall of people when you leave the no xp zone.
---
And who else aside from irons will be killing it for red spider eggs?
---
What‚Äôs you‚Äôre money making method
---
Lmao epic lure
---
Medium answer: Noooo
---
RS3:
---
Dungoneering - Good!
---
Updated Graphics and music - GOOD!!
---
MTX - Dont really care 
---
EOC - Quit the game with half the player base.
---
Just you and the boys killing undead druids I see :p. Grats!
---
What? I ain't mad, I'm just saying we only have one side of a multifaceted story and that it's entirely possible the ban isn't due to the "rushing", but rather due to some other aspect. 
---
For example (and I'm not saying this happened), what if the banned player in question isn't showing us say... the 10 death threats he sent to the streamer? 
---
Usually when these type of threads pop up, the bans are justified. Don't take what he says at face value (and also don't dismiss him out of hand!).
---
LOL
---
You kinda missed my point, anyone who is used to no mtx will be greeted by their ultimate answer. They will be either be okay with it or not.
---
Honestly and I will get downvoted for this but you deserve to be banned. It has been known for years jagex favors streamers yet you attempted to slay a dragon and now look at you crying cause you got burnt. If you get unbanned so should hundreds of others.
---
Id argue it has nothing to do with the military, and that its and effective yet peaceful way to protest a country that has been nothing but evil for most of its history. Even if it were disrespectful to the military: Good.
---
100%? lol
---
sorry but barely anyone would even get to level 30 in classic wow lol. the leveling was a literal fucking snorefest, walking everywhere until level 40, everything took ABSOLUTE AGES to do. if you think osrs is a grind you should see vanilla endgame with the attunements, consumables, gold farming, etc, etc, etc. literally almost nothing is fun about that game. tbc/wotlk were infinitely better and had the right balance of time invested/reward. vanilla was just unpolished garbage. worst pvp balance of any expansion, classes/specs literally had one role, and you wouldn't be accepted anywhere if you stepped out of your boundary, literally 2 button rotations in pve, hunters actually had the most complex rotations with  stringing auto-shots between aimed/multi shots, then feign death/switch gear/trinket, etc , yet hunters were basically there to just tranq shot and nothing more really. mages did the most dps by literally pressing one button. i can go on and on lol.
---
leveling/endgame pve/pvp was actually fun in wotlk, not to mention the addition of arenas and etc. i mean fun is a personal preference, but i have no clue why anyone would play vanilla when there are highly populated tbc/wotlk private servers lol.

---
Or you could simply watch the unedited feed he posted on this topic and make a decision based on evidence that is clearly present?
---
See ya in /r/oldschool2007scape
---
I don't know why people are bleating on about how this only applies to streamers... I, a regular pleb, had video evidence of someone constantly spec tabbing me for a week straight and sent it to a Jmod and the guy got banned. 
---
What do you want streamers to do, not stream pking? Even if they put a 5 min delay on, you're always going to get a sad kid who hops constantly to find them.
---
This dude claims he got banned for rushing Tubeyboi but how does he know lol? And everybodys jumping to his rescue lmfao.
---
True, it could be clearer that something has changed. But, they didn't just change it randomly without telling us, or change it after it was polled.
---
You won't. They are going to ignore this and eventually people will forget.
---
Make it so you can only splash if you have purchased something from a partnership
---
Yeah but I didn't know rushing was against the rules
---
OP was already in trouble for something else that got him permanently muted, but he doesn't remember what he was doing the night before he got muted because he was "drunk".
---
Lmao should it matter though? The intent is irrelevant, either it's OK or it's not.
---
Twitch thing was shit too, I would've voted no to that but wasn't around at that time. How is this any good for you as a subscriber?
---
Name 3 times that scenario has happened. Besides this one, because it‚Äôs obviously bullshit. You act like jagex does this all the time but I bet you can‚Äôt do it
---
It makes way more sense to assume the worst since 99%+ of the time on this reddit OP has been smacked down horribly after making a thread claiming their ban was unjust.
---
It wasn't clear that that was against the rules though.
---
Well they're not wrong lmao
---
So it's ok if someone does it in order to make irl money but if someone does the same to make in-game money they should be banned?
---
By this logic it's ok to sell items for irl money on YouTube but not for in-game money. There must be something else behind this ban.
---
I always downvote karma whores who do this
---
Mtx will always be inevitable because of our chinese overlords pressuring Jamflex to give in.
---
No it ain't lol
---
They introduced sUpRiSe PaRtNeRsHiPs to distract us from the real issue, our right to splash in Lumbridge.
---
Thanks for the mid level content! Looking forward to the boss
---
I see. Thanks for the answer
---
Just for your info. Jagex is a company that does things like this and is fine with it. It doesn't surprise me something corrupt like this happened. I wouldn't doubt it that they have made millions of RWT aswell. Probably selling gold themselves through websites too. They are a very shady company and this is a perfect example.
---
This is a good one üëå
---
6:10 for the start of the real stuff
---
it's the running joke on the subreddit to bring up Dovy whenever the words "a friend" come up, in any context really
---
Being hijacked is a good reason to be banned.
---
No it fucking doesn't, in the poll where there's been updated poll blogs they mention it at the top of the poll, this time we got this "On June 7th we posted a poll blog featuring the Forthos Dungeon developed by Mod Husky. We'd now like to poll the content discussed in that blog. " - Well i read it on June 7th, when it tells me i should have read it and doesn't mention any changes at all.  So how the fuck was i meant to know it wasn't what id read? 
---
Point me to a reddit post or a website poll update where Jagex mention it, because all I can see is a player posting it which I missed.  If they'd made it as obvious as they normally do I would have seen it before now.
---
Tbh I have more fun botting, evading bans, maxing out a pure/main/whatever then just doing shit until it either gets banned or lives long enough to be safe than I do grinding.
---
I'm too lazy to do bot farms. That's kinda where I draw the line. But I know lots of people from the community over the years that have made a steady living doing it.
---
It's a business decision, it's decided. 
---
It started when they got a lucrative partnership with amazon and started handing out free memberships to everyone.
---
MMK said he would resign if additional MTX got added to the game, and he sure did without another job lined up.
---
Oh baby. Permamuted guy who has "no idea" what got him permamuted is making a public post about getting permabanned. This has got to be JMod heaven!
---
What‚Äôs the sun looking thing
---
Support greed! Let EA rule the world! Coin flip to see if you get your weekly paycheck! The higher ups in jagex can wipe there asses with 100 dollar bills if they wanted to and still not be hurting for money
---
Oh shit, I know this guy in real life. I wonder if he‚Äôs reading the comments?
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Jacmob isn't some genius.
---
OSRS bot detection isn't even bad and it's heuristic, machine learning based already, specifically designed to act with 100% accuracy (can't have false positives with no customer support). You literally can't do MUCH better than they're already doing. The bots on OSRS are more sophisticated now and it's just a clicking game.  They're also using human collected mouse data to generate realistic clicking.
---
They plan to...?
---
And the ‚Äúif‚Äù statement was a suggestion about someone making death threats which was a completely different post. You‚Äôre cherry picking.
---
You can still see voting results after the poll has ended
---
[deleted]
---
"Calm down guys, it's only cosmetics items you can totally earn ingame"
---
How many times have we heard that before...
---
Yea black market price is 200-400k per twitch prime account crazy cheap
---
Yes, I know, I get it. You're still missing the point man.
---
Spying in CCs is a valid tactic.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to be spied on don‚Äôt run a CC or watch who‚Äôs in it. 
---
If you‚Äôre gonna stream in the wild know the risks. 
---
Seriously wtf not like he was being harassed at rock crabs it‚Äôs the wilderness
---
Ya'll are forgetting this is a massive corporation... The first rule of business is take a product, increase it's value, and sell it...  
---
It's exactly what they did with RS the first time, and they're about to cash out again... Just get ready, it's coming
---
Just ragging and attacking a single person over and over is clearly trying to ruin their enjoyment of the game and their possibility of playing. I see that as intentional harassment.
---
It‚Äôs comparable to staff of the dead melee, 2 less strength bonus
---
The past always repeats itself
---
Sad jagex reacts this way, it‚Äôs PVP, you can‚Äôt harass somebody if you
---
are allowed to kill them over and over again. And favoring streamers, if jMods follow this same path, there‚Äôs not much left in this game....
---
I got permaband for grinding Yaks. This game is trash
---
well that is harassment
---
According to basically everyone I've spoken to, the point where Dharoks becomes more efficient than Obsidian is about 92 HP.
---
yet you got skulltricked by them lmfao
---
I think its like 90 or something.
---
You don't get perma muted for banter, you get perm muted for extreme racism/violence. Just move on from the game, time to grow up and get a life dude.
---
RemindMe! 3 days
---
You first
---
Yeah, but 'brands' don't typically care if a new account with a handful of followers tweet at them most of the time... it takes "lol influencer" levels to get attention sometimes.
---
If you rob a store and go to jail and serve the time, and then are out of luck and need to rob a store for food again, and again get caught, do you serve double the time for stealing twice? No you already served the first time. 
---
I'm just wondering why him being muted would have anything to do with this incident?
---
!remindme 2 days
---
On the bright side this has taught me to unsub from here for a few weeks, and just generally cut down on Reddit.  I'll get my RS news from my clan, where people are allowed their own opinions.
---
Apparently they find it hard to justify making cosmetics, in a game spinning more profits than ever.
---
&gt;**because you are personally fine with them**
---
[citation needed]]
---
You also shouldn't get perma banned for pking.
---
I literally know nothing about the game that you are talking about. I came here from r/all. 
---
I think you should read the comments (yours and theirs) again. I know that it was unintentional, but you did come off as the aggressor.
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
Why does it matter if he‚Äôs already been punished for it?
---
He was actually ragging aoaatube for multiple hours lol
---
Rushing someone trying to pk their goods is harassment?  They should put that one in the rule book then so I should quit the game.
---
You clearly said that you believe this was "just a dude and his buddies out pking." You can't just yell **cherry-picking!** because someone proved that you're being an idiot
---
Weading lmao
---
Twitter should not be customer support any more than Reddit should be.
---
What reason for a Permanent mute is there that would get him banned? It's not like he's flaming them in chat and if the mute was also for rushing then it's not like it would do anything?? Completely unrelated shit.
---
you should!you're ruining pvp
---
It‚Äôs foolish to think that things like this don‚Äôt snowball.  
---
Ever worked in customer service and your manager gives X for free, suddenly that customer will want it all the time - ‚Äúbut I got it last time‚Äù 
---
If they see that their margin grows, players spike etc - they know they‚Äôve got a button they can push that spikes their profits and player counts.   You‚Äôll see them push that button again and again and analyse the data.    They‚Äôll do it multiple times, altering the factors to maximise profits and keep the community as happy as possible.  
---
Next button push - longer exclusivity on skin. 
---
Next button push - exclusive house theme with time gate and exclusive skin that players cannot get unless they sign up. 
---
Next button push - item that provides a tiny stat bonus - non exclusive time gate. 
---
Next button push - small eco bonus when inviting friends etc etc
---
Eventually you‚Äôll have promos like this:
---
New twitch prime promo!
---
Join now to unlock:
---
- exclusive house theme for twitch prime members only
---
-exclusive skin, get this skin 2 months earlier than everyone else
---
- 2% exp bonus for 1 month!
---
- access to new exclusive dungeon with rare drops!
---
- 10 jag coins!
---
/&gt; Served his time
---
/&gt; Permanently muted
---
Pick one. Being muted is primarily a warning.
---
I don't know what the fuck is going on here, or what even this game is, but I absolutely love that you've called this kind of bullshit out and the OP is being exposed for being a dirty punk. 
---
Excellent work.
---
some very good points here
---
What about permanent do you not understand
---
I think its a bit ridiculous personally. Its not like the items are exclusive and its faaar from the MTX rs3 has. Its not like they are introducing things that do not fit the medival theme of the game
---
Not true man gold is so cheap . People use to buy loads of it when it was even 4$/m ..
---
because dhl does extra damage to olm thats a silly comparison, rapier great for training cmb stats wish i had it for my 99 slayer grind.
---
Guys a troll just ignore him
---
Wow, its name is sriracha? I need it!
---
Doubt they‚Äôre going to ban somebody off rushing a streamer once or twice
---
his opinion is on point tho
---
BDO had a big increase in their p2w levels some time ago, went back on a promise not to do a thing. According to the bdo and mmorpg sub; game is DED every guild is quitting, people are quitting in droves!
---
meanwhile steamcharts was showing regular ups/downs for playercount.
---
Actually I can because you have clearly not read *everything* that has led up to this point.
---
Where did you get the ¬® had a J mod friend so he DMed him and got me banned for it ¬®part from? Doesn't sound like a thing he would do anyway.
---
It is a scummy thing to do though, stream sniping him for 3 days straight just to get attention.
---
It doesn't matter what the mods personally want if corporate tells them they need to add MTX
---
There were literally more looting bots in pk worlds than actual pkers because of the prime promotion. 
---
People were making bot farms of 100+ bots just to fuck around with because it was so easy to get free membership and bot with it.
---
Also PK Streamers: PvP is dying, wtf Jagex?
---
Yeah, it cut down RWT too. So i'd say it's the only MTX we'll ever need. Oh and lets you buy membership with in game money.
---
Doesn't help you get better seeds at all
---
It only increases the chance of a woodcutting nest being an egg nest, rather than the other types.
---
Looks like they're worse than spectres. A decent alternative option for people who do chaos druids I suppose.
---
What is the poll that everyone is memeing about and seems rather important?
---
The thing about CEOs is that they change at the whim of the board. 
---
Andrew Gower promised no MTX and no RWT. Well so much for that.
---
Surely you should learn the rules? They're out there for you to learn, it's not their problem you didn't check
---
ur brain is fucked
---
Waaaaaaah someone in my video game isnt playing how I want them to play waaaaah
---
If you were ragging him for 3 days like he says, then I don't feel bad, ragging is against the rules
---
That's highly speculative and doesn't work in the specific situation of OSRS. We get a vote on how far they're taking this and stuff like that is against the core principles of the game.
---
How is killing someone out of a crowd harassing? Lmao god damn yall some snowflakes
---
Yesterday I was encouraging my friends list to vote no, until one person said "I voted no to almost everything,except skins colors I don¬¥t mind paying $5 for it" FML
---
Okay? I wasn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm not going to apologize for people getting mad over nothing.
---
They said their responses make them *seem* like a cunt and called them a muppet, pretty light fair, and after he had been less than tactful for multiple posts. That is a right sensible callout if you ask me. Responding to politeness with rudeness isn't a good look, but responding to rudeness without about the same level of rudeness, while it isn't an ideal response, does make plenty of sense to me and doesn't paint such a bad picture of said commentor IMO
---
Literal repost from less than 24 hrs ago
---
Haven't been paying much attention, able to brief me up or provide a link?
---
What I watched the clip, the streamer said "finally he got me after 3 days". That statement proves he (banned player) ragged him. As for not being banned for doing it to others, they didn't have much power, they didn't connect him for possible ragging or they just didn't do anything to him.
---
Either way, this case requires way more evidence and backstory information what happened and how. But based on current evidence, I feel like the banned player was ragging and because he ragged a streamer = video evidence who also has direct connection to Jmod, he got punished way faster and easier.
---
Me too. Don't want to see OSRS go down like this. 
---
Not like this. Not like this.
---
Is it better than D scim? Or does speed make it worse
---
What is it with streamers getting other users banned, i hope jagex WILL do against the dude that get you banned [both, streamer and support] (something similar happened with nubrac and nb3 in league)
---
you sick fuck
---
This is the only kind of MTX I can live with.
---
But in this instance couldn‚Äôt you just world hop?
---
Yep looks like the numbers/analytics from twitch partnership made its way to coorporate and they are pushing for more.
---
Jagex customer support and jmods are wank
---
I need to look into herb runs but I didn‚Äôt really mean routine just meant something to do that would net some good money
---
Looking for the VOD, have to sift through 18 hours of VOD forgot the timestamp 
---
My intention was to make money off him not get attention, grief or anything like that.
---
Are you not going to post all the other times you've ragged him on stream? 
---
What about potentially every other streamer that enters the wildy sub 100 combat? You know you have an issue when even MMORPG had enough.
---
If anything you deserve the permaban and you know it. Let's not forget the time we let you back into our team, you bs a member for claws and your solution is 'don't worry i'll pay him back when I have money.'
---
And when we kick you you resort to making over 100 discord accounts to try and ruin multi trips.
---
If by any chance you get unbanned for this, I'm sure I can gather enough proof from ingame to get you rebanned.
---
Yeah but it can still be condemned as wrong with the caveat being it may not be the full story. There are some people who seem to be implying they agree that targeting one person constantly should be bannable.
---
&gt;if they don't show results to the very end what's to stop them from fabricating them?
---
It's just as possible for them to be fabricated when you could see them.
---
I thought it was your watermark üòÇ
---
I was stopping by his cc for every now and then to try to get a claws pk or kill him for 500k
---
!remindme 1 day
---
!Remind Me! 4 hours
---
Idea: 
---
When you hit a 0, on any spell, you get 0 exp. But you also dont use up the runes.
---
Removes splashing entirely
---
Lol 
---
We're not saying you can't splash just don't do it where the kids will see.
---
Haha, it wasn't him.
---
Well that's the wilderness for you, that's the risk of walking in the wilderness. If he got attacked by another player in serious gear, not one-iteming or without gear at all. Then he has no right to complain.
---
You're a moron, the mod specifically says "result of continued and targeted harassment, that was reported to us by MULTIPLE PLAYERS and appears to have been going on for multiple days" - Yea it could have been brought to their attention by the streamer but it seems pretty clear they weren't the only person targeted this way. 
---
And saying its the fault of the person putting content up is like getting angry at TV companies because your a racist and they've hired an asian person.  It's still the fault of the racist for being a cockwomble, and in this instance its the fault of the harasser for being toxic and harassing.
---
old school runescape was released in 2013. Any accounts and stats created before that are on Runescape 3.
---
Ok but is this a new thing? no
---
It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre telling you what‚Äôs gonna happen‚Äù when they hide the poll results. They can choose whatever the fuck they want now
---
Im not sure how long it takes to reset. You can hop worlds and sell your stuff full price until item value goes down to much.
---
Shit tier mental gymnastics ? What? Are you fucking handicapped IRL? Is your IQ just a single digit? The fact that you actually compared this ragging, griefing, lying piece of shit on Reddit to Torvesta who doesn‚Äôt do any of the pathetic things OP has done and try to claim that it‚Äôs a bad argument?
---
You obviously do not keep up with streamers or well known pkers in general who are 1000x better than you at this spaghetti code trash game and they have so much evidence against this guy griefing them because they risk way more money and OP wanted to make some quick bank.
---
That streamer must have a giant wiener.
---
Why is nmz good for boosting combat stats
---
I know you fight bosses, but why is that better than just fighting crabs or something
---
what? no the game literally wouldnt do anything when i clicked on it lol. wasnt my connection. its some bug with him teleing u when hes 0 hp. you can replicate this if youre unlucky enough to get some bad hits and have him tele u at 0 hp
---
Too bad voting no only stops these cosmetics passing rather than possible MTX. Even when these fails, it doesn't stop Jagex from coming up new plans for partnerships. Perhaps something more clever than free cosmetics.
---
I took it from a top level comment about halfway down. Upvoted them and then started spreading it
---
Or we could continue to pay the same amount of money /and/ not have MTX like we have so far.
---
hes a RAGGING LOSER
---
Streamers will say pretty much anything to explain away the fact that they're probably better at talking to a webcam than playing the game
---
you are literally chatting absolute unadulterated kaka
---
Just cause u use gay as an insult doesn't mean ur homophobic
---
Range lvling will be cake
---
but do u kick seagull? I think not

---
Counterpoint: get gud
---
A portal to starbucks would be dope desu
---
Which I doubt it will unless Jagex wants to be an incompetent business...
---
Why should it be actionable. No one is forcing the streamer to stream?
---
If you choose to stream in the wilds you should be open for PKing by anyone.
---
I mean it depends on how you scale it, but in this instance with the context it is some what reasonable to assume this OP is fairly toxic and probably should be banned. Length etc... is up to everyone. 
---
But yeah perma-muted should definitely be a black mark on your account, they literally had to stop you from talking in game. 
---
Being toxic makes anything in life pretty shit.
---
Learn to be nicer FFS, fuck me your a cunt
---
I don't think it'll take it passing for people to start leaving. We have been headed down this MTX path for a couple years now and this is just another step in that direction. I'm gonna be cancelling my sub but because it's obviously at the forefront of their minds. It's only a matter of time before MTX is shoehorned into the game.
---
That's irrelevant to his ban.
---
That's cool and all.. **but let me tell you about our sponsor DOLLAR SHAVE CLU-**
---
what about other npcs?
---
How can you take someone's account away for PKing? That's the stupidest most frustrating thing I've ever heard, if streamers or any other players don't want to run the risk of getting PK'd they should stay out of areas where players can attack you. I'm a noob with terrible stats and gear and look like a snack so I stay out of Wildy! But if this is how it works I should be able to PvM wherever I want and have people reported and banned if they PK me more than once.
---
‚ÄúNo one at Jagex wants to‚Äù doesn‚Äôt say they wouldn‚Äôt if they were forced to by the owners
---
Prove guilt, not innocence
---
fucking idiot. imagine getting followed around by a clown for 3 days, and having the same clown stream snipe the people you host and thinking its legit pking.  A man hopping worlds to crash your slayer task for 3 days straight isn't harassment. just hop worlds and block him ! lol !
---
Thats a nice idea :D I never tried that before :D Thanks man
---
What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.
---
Splashing update underrated tbh
---
Remove splashing and have the desert mage area have magic dummies
---
So if I broadcast my location in the wildy, I am exempt from being PK'd?
---
imagine being so fucking dense
---
He do
---
He deleted this 1 min ago
---
Thanks for the suggestion, but we've played on these accounts as recently as a few months ago.
---
Everyone who says this is a smack down is literally dense. Since when are there rules in the wilderness? So what if he‚Äôs been targeting people in the WILDERNESS? It‚Äôs the WILDERNESS. This should not be a ban! This is ridiculous!!! It is absolutely the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen Jagex ban a player for! You cannot ban for pking! Whether it be targeted or not! PVP areas are not a safe zone and Jagex says so themselves whenever a player attempts to cross the ditch! There are no rules in the wilderness! This is extremely shameful, Jagex. The wilderness is literally the Wild West. There are no rules! As annoying as I find ragging to be, banning someone for this is a slippery slope! I can‚Äôt imagine being banned one day because I‚Äôm attacking a streamer unknowingly! We don‚Äôt pay to be second class citizens in this game! Your reason is not justified in any way, it is proof of your streamer favouritism and makes you look extremely bad as a company! Please, review it carefully! Furthermore, his previous permanent mute does not justify the ban at all! It is a different offence altogether unrelated. If the player pked in a certain way, and you decided to ban him then you need to let the players know exactly what he did that constitutes harassment and release an update clearly outlying what is allowed and what is not allowed in the wilderness. Heh, lets see how that works out for you. You guys have no idea how to do your job, it‚Äôs pathetic and shameful.
---
Not really, mtx is already in old school but people turn a blind eye to it under the ruse of ‚Äúit reduces rwt... plus it benefits me so I like it‚Äù
---
People didn‚Äôt care last month when they got their free week of membership from the partnership..
---
People haven‚Äôt complained about the cow teleport or the shield emotes, or the runefest shields... 
---
It‚Äôs just a hysteria going around. Mtx cosmetics didn‚Äôt kill rs3, the xp rewards did... oh and eoc.
---
It shows he has the capacity to be a toxic player, regardless if he was already punished or not.
---
Not true at all.
---
I don't play osrs, I play RS3. For every RS3 player that I hear that's voting no for the mtx, I'm going to vote yes. I have 4k+ alts, and while they don't all don't have 300 total, a large number of them do, and if I need to train more, I will.
---
People who don't play osrs shouldn't be trying to influence the vote. It's different if you play both games, but if you don't play osrs period, yeah.. I'm gonna have to vote yes a couple times.
---
look man NOT sure if following someone for 3 days and ragging is the same as finding a streamer and actually fighting them but i think you should look into it.
---
Settled just recently got flown out by Jagex to their hq for a tour and to beta test some new shit. You dont bite the hand that feeds, it's bad business.
---
Either he's logging in onto a deadman world or he is using the wrong account.
---
Yeah, the fact that actually PVPing certain people shows how trash the game has become
---
I just tried to do the same thing, but they removed the free membership from the twitch bundle... lmao
---
I'm not missing the point. That's just a stupid point to make. 
---
"Omggg what they proposed could *eventually* turn into game destroying mtx."
---
Except for the fact that what they proposed is NOT mtx and they could *eventually* add in mtx whenever tf they want. If everyone votes no to this, they could*eventually* add in mtx anyways.
---
Log into rs3 just to check otherwise it‚Äôs on another email
---
Except it wasn't at all. He was originally muted because he kept harassing other users.
---
Now he found a new way to harras assumingly the same users despite his perma mute and did so for multiple days straight in a row. That leaves the mods with no other options than to ban him.
---
Y
---
How much did the weapon sell for? That can be a post on its own.
---
Bruh mtx is bad but don‚Äôt be a homophobe about it damn
---
is a man following u for 3 days straight crashing your slayer tasks/etc not harassment if he doesn't type anything? cant be sure man. u can only be toxic if u type. actions cant be toxic. ever. bro.
---
Irrelevant. Are you dense?
---
If you wouldn't not not unwant to not see an orange skin added, simply don't unvote yes.
---
I was just able to vote on one of my alts so it‚Äôs working for me now. (Yes I voted no on all of my alts. I‚Äôm not an animal)
---
bruh üòéüî•üî•üëèüôå
---
OI JOSUKE, I TRIED PAYING FOR MTX WITH MY THE HAND BUT NOW IM FUCKING POOR PLEASE JOSUKE HELP ME
---
I‚Äôd like to get something off my chest too, most of you here are fucking retarded and cannot think logically to save yourselves, this sub is filled with bandwagoning retards who are easily convinced by liars without evidence, aka the dude who got banned for griefing constantly and then lying here about it but managed to circle jerk a huge following of retards who actually support him.
---
Goodbye
---
Damn its already dead content
---
Are you dense?
---
I smell a lot of bullshit.
---
Bro, they are letting us relive the nostalgia of the old days, including when they ruined the game with MTX.
---
How does broadcasting your location in a game exempt you from getting PK'D. I've been PK'd in the wilderness and went back to get my stuff before, and was killed twice in a row. Is that harassment?
---
I'm afraid splashers will turn to higher level monsters in other parts of the game, making it more difficult to train there.
---
Already seen this on ogress warriors and hill giants a couple times.
---
Jagex deleted it
---
This wasn‚Äôt the case when the poll was initially released. They only changed it a day or so ago.
---
Just go crash them lol. Pet chances are random so maybe they‚Äôd leave.
---
Typically I would hate this but camping a boss for long periods of time is just annoying
---
Wilderness is a danger zone. If streamers are actively showing their location, whether pking or pvming, they run the risk of being pk'd. Why should they be banned for that? If they are being toxic in chat, like by passing the profanity filter to talk shit then yes, ban away but broadcasting yourself in a PvP area, you deserve to be targeted.
---
So it's effectively a go-to mid level crush weapon? Woo!
---
In the poll booth, named NO(s)
---
Serious
---
Looks like a bunch of spider legs taped together
---
Yeah, that's not the point. The point is that if these polls pass it sets a precedent that "the community is OKAY with partnerships" and Jagex WILL use this to their advantage. They will begin adding more partnerships without polling them in the future.
---
How long until they decide to add something a little more than a partnership? How long until one of these partnerships offers an enticing deal to Jagex that offers content *beyond* cosmetic changes?
---
So no, not MTX in a traditional sense, but it is not a road that we want to go down. It could very well lead to worse.
---
Haha wow that‚Äôs pathetic, I think this will be a landslide
---
Are you dense? Get out of wild if you can‚Äôt afford to take the risk.
---
It is my man.
---
No it's not, as sometimes, albeit rarely, the punishment gets overturned
---
Never said that, just saying that OP specifically targeted this guy and lied about it.
---
its time to riot now yes?
---
Pushing content through without polls is good as long as I like it.
---
Poll it in rs3
---
Okay I understand being muted for harassment, but isn‚Äôt that the point of the wilderness or am I missing something? I thought that was the point of the wilderness was to enter at your own risk and it‚Äôs fair grounds for any type of pvp
---
The only people that might want MTX are the new-school mobile kids  
---
Jagex are gonna captivate on that by dangling carrots in front of our faces until something gives.
---
Just give it a few days. I'd rather play the game with friends. I'm glad it became multi.
---
i think its good now, bosses should not be catered to ironmen and the boss is only packed since its release day. after the hype dies down it‚Äôll be more realistic for ironmen to kill
---
Wait how does wow have anything that isn‚Äôt cosmetic?
---
And don‚Äôt say the level boost because that just saves time to get to the current content.. saves you maybe 2 weeks tops.
---
it locks new players out of pvm because you need a year or more for a single good aura
---
I think it was more along the lines of, at least for me, it seemed like it would be really good for bringing in New players. Twitch prime was introduced awhile before then I believe and it was a huge success! The purple skin that came with it seemed like it was just a throwaway bonus at the time. But now that they have shown us they have multiple partnerships for companies we don't even know yet, with a lot of new cosmetics, it feels like a new standard and not just a one off event for getting new people in the game. I doubt there is any partnership they could make that would give as big of a boost as prime, so the up sides don't interest me at all.
---
But if those buying their gold from goldfarmers were doing it through bonds instead, maybe jagex wouldn't have to ask us if they can introduce mtx.
---
Solid
---
&gt;We will never directly sell gold or xp
---
Yeah you make us gamble for it lmao
---
Nice! Did you kill the spider with melee? The blog post said it was high in Ranged defence, but I only have base 75 combat stats...
---
Just say No to MTX
---
Not a pvmer, so I guess I'm safe. And I wouldn't be worried about being specifically targeted by you, for many reasons, but one of them would be that I'd expect you to not be autistic enough to funnel hours into figuring out where I'm moving in reality.
---
Bludgeon is quick though.
---
Damn looks great man! It‚Äôll be a sad day if it comes to this :(
---
Cosmetics don't need to be cosmetics if they can be fully functional equipment introduced with content filled updates.  
---
end thread
---
You forgot the karma farm in the background :p
---
Ok But you can still buy bonds for gp
---
Adding a pet to mid level non instanced boss is not good. Just makes all the high level players ruin it for the mid level ones.
---
You got a recipie link?
---
Idk, could be mashed potatoes
---
To look superior??? What? Guy, you should talk to someone professional about your insecurity issues, because I don‚Äôt know what you want from me.
---
The game is not supposed to be balanced around ironmen. Im ironman myself and hate catering to us
---
Your subjective 'feel of integrity' is the dumbest shit I've heard. A lot of people are religious but that doesn't make the concept of it fucking autistic.
---
The integrity of the game is ruined already, there's so much shit that was never out back then, not even the content, but the mechanics. Alone. Saying that ''mtx is bad'' because it ruins something that doesn't exist outside of your head is literally ludicrous. It won't have a negative impact on the game outside of people whining.
---
Now THIS is fashionscape.
---
"Another blog post" fucking killed me
---
This is quality content
---
You can't use it in the sense "Yeah you robbed the store, oh and look you did it before and served time. Alright, double the amount as last time." Lmfao. They can go "Yeah you robbed the store, oh and look you did it before and didn't learn anything so here's an extra year." But they can't make you serve time for a crime you already served for.
---
Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing. They could easily rig them even if poll results were visible- in fact, it'd be more believable if players saw "Yes" results rising incrementally.
---
It's always been a relatively small portion of the playerbase that actually votes on polls.
---
This makes me sad bc its true:( I got into the game just for mobile. I play exclusively on mobile too its lit, but mobile has been uncheck cancer for too long. I really hoped jagex would keep away from it but idk now man.
---
You guys can't cherrypick though. Thats not how things work.
---
This tactic is basically a black-white argument also known as False dilemma. It's a logical fallacy.
---
"You presented two alternative states as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist."
---
Again, Jagex's mtx is atrocious, but there are better examples.
---
I wouldn't say I have a big problem, but It is an obnoxious practice.
---
To make a profit from the partnerships?
---
The yugioh reference got me
---
I‚Äôm happy to buy into mtx to vote no to mtx!
---
Zuhaar dropping a nuke
---
Yikes. More power to you man but I hope this never happens. Thousands of really dedicated players are going to be hurt by this just to satisfy the few who don't even have time to play the game. No offence.
---
I'm very well aware of that, but I do have faith in Jagex not making that same mistake again. As long as they stick to cosmetics I don't really care whether MTX are implemented or not.
---
Lol, you passed law school, passed the bar, got into the DA's office, but you're wrong because he said so. This dude's ego is insane.
---
Think he means, they don‚Äôt need to be hidden to make the results say what ever they want them to say.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with anything you stated here. Just unfortunate to see a game I grew up on going down the same path.
---
Please clarify your point. So far all you've demonstrated is that you don't understand how the US justice system works.
---
What boss..?
---
None - you just need a slash weapon to get into the area
---
It doesn't matter since they couldn't seal the deal.
---
Minecraft sword hahaah
---
Do you know what a mtx is? Please tell me you can tell the difference between buying a bond and mtx.
---
*players rant about wanting hidden poll results for months*
---
*playes rant as soon as poll results are hidden*
---
Lol you believe a throwaway account jesus christ help your soul. I hope you're never allowed to vote, you believe literally anything anyone tells you.
---
Do your own research you incompetent fool.
---
"I don't like the current vote, let me redirect you to something so irrelevant and lemme twist some facts like saying they just NOW changed it, rather than some polls ago...Like *requested*"
---
Better than this would be to add some kind of build for purpose splashing facility somewhere in the world.  
---
I would say Yanille, though I don't know how people would feel about putting it a Member's only area.  
---
I happen to support the principal of this suggested change, but the solution they're proposing is just terrible game design!
---
This partnership introduced a loophole for bot farms to get free memberships, increasing bottling by like 500% and ruining the price of seeds.
---
ooh nice
---
If you go to the streamer's twitter, he admits that all he did was "send a message" to get the guy banned. Which Jmod did he message and why the fuck are we letting streamers have different rules?
---
Definition of a micro transaction is buying an item in game with real money to give you a benefit. 
---
Buying a bond gives the seller money in game..
---
Bonds are actually a text book definition of what mtx is.
---
People always find a reason to complain. Hide results or not theres always something sketchy going on according to these idiots
---
I see me ardy basically anywhere I have low lvl mobs
---
Do it
---
Read a few books and gain some reading comprehension and then reread waht was already said, the point is clarified enough. Sorry if you're too slow and misunderstood, but you can take your time and go slow, the comments aren't going anywhere. :)
---
The exodia head lololol golden
---
Too good
---
I stand with anyone and everyone who votes no
---
You would need a job to do that tho
---
You don't need auras for high level pvm. They just help. I'm not saying I like the system, but this isn't about auras efficiencies. I'm just saying loyalty points don't cost money other than just paying for membership. So I don't know why they're lumped in with Treasure Hunter MTX garbage.
---
They have always had the ability to fix the results. If you think otherwise you are naive.
---
I mean, I started a few months ago. They certainly confused the hell out of me when I saw them, but not really much else. More along the lines of "What the heck are they doing?".
---
friendly reminder that some of the blatant ezscape nonsense in the forthos poll failed with 70% Yes despite the reddit outcry.
---
Reddit probably represents like 10% of the community, at best. There's a massive "casual" silent majority that will never read reddit or any fan forum for runescape and usually just vote yes on everything.
---
Dude and with the timing of the bounty hunter changes they must have known full well how many bots were gonna be pumped out from the promotion
---
Wait can f2p players not vote?
---
They knew MTX would create a shitstorm so they've been on their best behaviour for two months, DMM included lol
---
No chance of being caught either way. They control what we see lmao. They could have anything say whatever they want
---
Yeah and Blizzard is owned by Activision. They will add MTX 3-5 months down the road, just like every other game that they own.
---
there was a reason why they took it down. it was full of bugs and bugged locations that they couldnt fix.
---
So you‚Äôre saying buying membership is a mtx? Then mtx is already in the game since the beginning
---
Why u guys need to do these iron Man updates?
---
I LAUGHED SO HARD AT THIS!!! XD
---
stop before i report you for harrassment and you get bunned
---
This fits so well, are you sure it's not what he originally said?
---
People really need to stop crying about this. Just vote no and move on.
---
Mind blown right?
---
People just don‚Äôt comment on it because they get a direct benefit from it.
---
Because citing actual supreme court cases (which I did) is better.
---
Introduced my GF to osrs and she didn't get it. Tried chit chattin with a guy in full iron splashing on the rats. This update is valid.
---
Lmao angry kid
---
Sorry that a corporation broke your heart kid, but once you start chatting to females you‚Äôll realise this isn‚Äôt the end of the world..
---
You're dickriding /u/KelloggsPornFlakes all over this thread, lol. Weird seeing people fanboy out over reddit comments
---
To be fair to them, if people don‚Äôt read something before voting.. they are kinda dumb.
---
Lets make 11 a month sound real bad by using the annual amount!
---
The botting caused by the twitch partnership far out weighs any amount of players they got to join. I highly doubt that this was the deciding factor on why they played the game, it was more likely that you played it and that you got them to jump on it to take advantage of the free month. Without you they wouldn't even have considered it I would imagine. 
---
You are totally missing the point. It's not what's being offered, it's the fact that this will set a precedent for future mtx updates.
---
I used to be part of the "it's only cosmetic" crowd... Now look at modern gaming. WoW is a prime example where the nearly all the unique mounts they make are only available through spending cash. 
---
Also, why should we have to be involved with another company to get an item in game when it's released? We pay subs which means there should be no money/time gated content for those who already fucking pay.
---
All those reasons outweigh the small boost to the player base from partnerships.
---
Why üò¢
---
Just, play ironman
---
Its literally 1 thread of the same argument. Yes Im arguing with multiple idiots. Crazy
---
But isn't bonds not already a soft version of that? Except I don't need to roll for a top tier weapon I can just buy it outright.
---
You can get them all off your screen very easily, unless there‚Äôs a glitch. Never happened to me.
---
Blood runes, which is the better option:
---
Mine blocks, turn to dark blocks, chisel to dark fragments, return to mine, mine blocks, turn to dark blocks, carry on to blood altar, turn first load of fragments to runes, chisel second load of blocks into fragments, turn second load of fragments to runes, use shortcut to return to mine. Repeat.
---
Or
---
Mine blocks, turn into dark blocks, chisel to fragments, carry on to blood altar, turn to runes, use shortcut to return to mine. Repeat.
---
Which would be faster? More xp and gp per hour.
---
LOL +1
---
You don't understand, once we allow cosmetic mtx, then they start sticking in xp boosters, buyable pets(rs3 has both afaik), etc.
---
Just because we already have MTX doesn't mean we should add more.
---
It's not about "breaking my heart" at all. The fact that you're making such an idiotic comment like that shows that either A: You weren't around when they started introducing microtransactions. Or B: Understand nothing about community management.
---
Well we need to make it as difficult and costly for them as possible
---
The thing is you actually did have a choice and you chose to stay and pay.  
---
the majority of us didn't, and quit.
---
Zuhaar. The legend, the woke, the myth. The artist we need but not the artist we deserve.
---
I was chalking that up to summer cuz even if people could get a million bots they would still have to level to 76 for sharks
---
MTX bad
---
I never said there were any p2w MTX in the early years of WoW. However I would classify selling expansions (like TBC) as MTX because it is gating content that you are already paying a subscription to have access to. The money from selling expansions have never been needed to make the company go around and have only existed because of greed and profit.
---
Realm transfers are essentially the same as name changing in RS, however in RS you can change your name for free every month...
---
??
---
How the turn tables have turned.

Exactly lol. No one at Jagex wants to, but investors dont give crap. Investors want more money

/r/2007scape in a nutshell

Hey I'm not judging, you do you. Maybe if you compliment him a few more times he'll let you suck his dick or something
---
\*puts on tinfoil hat\*
---
Yeah they look good but if it didn't affect gameplay why not have a toggleable 2011 graphics
---
Or just make an e-book
---
ik ik lol
---
Shakshuka
---
It is a joke
---
this is real
---
Odd for you not to mention the fact that it expands our player-base..
---
Lol wut?
---
Honestly I kind of dislike this. After this, splashers are going to be everywhere else where there's weak NPCs, as it is they're contained to mostly lumby.
---
I feel like EVScape exists solely to leech off the popularity of EZScape.
---
I don't think this will go anywhere from here. I will see you in classic WoW if it does though
---
You can‚Äôt answer my question at all can you?
---
It's more so just pointing out how difficult it is to make content aimed for lower levels or mid tier when a games been out as long as this one and a large % of the player base are farming end game content. Anything NEW in the game players are going to do, whether its low tier or mid tier content, its new content. 
---
There isnt just one solve all solution. Its not easy to release mid level content on a game 6+ years old. I wasnt tryna give a solution though, just pointing out whats wrong with it. This goes for any game though, specifically long running MMOs. You cant only release end game content unless its an easy enough bridge to get over into end game, while RS is a pretty long bridge into end game.
---
everyone getrs the cosmetic perks regardless of paying for amazon prime you hack
---
This post is stupid, which makes me think OP by proxy is stupid.
---
Making the boss instanced would just bring about that ‚Äòdead content‚Äô faster, because it would mean no competition for the boss. 
---
This boss isn‚Äôt meant to be high gp/hr, or for high levels. It‚Äôs literally been brought in to give people an introduction to bossing.
---
Unless I'm missing something they really don't though? You're just transferring your cash to another player in return for them buying your membership. No gold left the game here. 
---
Either way, even if I'm wrong would you be ok with it if you could buy cosmetics with bonds?
---
It should keep a percentage of the chins
---
Well op was muted so they can't say anything.
---
Try to do monkey madness, by then you will have the hang of things. Don't worry about efficiency unless you feel something is taking too long
---
Lolwut
---
you do realize that you earn them also by doing ... absolutely fuck all nothing, right? And at the same time it brings in more players.
---
Yeah it's already down to 5-6m and dropping
---
But i havent abused it yet

Do you not realize that the whole point of this is to increase our player base?
---
Whip is very human like.
---
You have to pay to convert them to tradeable...
---
I thought you blocked the dude.
---
OSRS ü§ù RS3
---
Fuck MTX
---
No man he's karma whoring.
---
YIKES
---
Wow they really got this whole sub heated with mtx lmao. You're Hella upset my guy.
---
It's just like 2k19 tho which is probably way worse on MTX. If you don't wanna spend money on the shit then just wait for it to come out. You can't really wait for shit to come out on 2k19 tho so you're forced to buy shit.
---
The whole point of the cosmetics is to increase our playerbase you stupid shill.
---
But that was due to eoc more than mtx
---
Oh. I think you meant weren't* hidden then, my bad
---
Swampletics what‚Äôve they done to ya?!
---
They're putting fluoride in the poll results to turn the frogs gay.
---
Such a better idea
---
I agree, I have a lot less motivation to play now because I feel like the evitable is coming.
---
You could actually take 2 seconds to explain how you think they don‚Äôt add value to the economy in a game with unlimited money supply, but instead you‚Äôre just choosing to be a dickhead. Clearly you don‚Äôt have so much faith in your point.
---
I don't think you can read between the lines. No i can't tell you of a game that cosmetic mtx completely killed.
---
That's not why we're against them, we're against them because of the reasons i already stated
---
I see your point, and the only solution I can think of (still not very desirable though) is to make it instanced for the first month orso after release and then put it in the overworld after it has stabilized
---
How many spins and keys did he buy?
---
99 pray grind :(
---
How is it mtx? You get the item without paying for it, and the whole point of it is to increase our playerbase. Seems like a win-win.
---
Know what else expands the player base? making the fucking game better
---
Or if you're an ironman and need to solo it but there's instance room...
---
It's as much of a joke as the rest of the rioting posts
---
lmao is that fucking Exodia's head?
---
Not much different with all the bots in OSRS.
---
Great, we're on the same page. Early MTX introductions in both Wow and RS3 both led to more MTX, of varying degrees.
---
Glad you see why we don't want it in OSRS.
---
They could, but they wont. This money goes directly into the pockets of the rich.
---
It does negatively affect their existing playerbase.
---
RS pre-eoc had a huge population that decreased to be only a glimpse of what it was shortly after EOC and its dying since then, all your arguments are based on assumptions, im just stating facts, what really happened. People will quit not because of only being mxt but what will come next, its obvious, and this time the community is older, more critical and vaccinated agaisnt jagex bullshit, so a few steps towards it will be enough to most of us. 
---
Its a miracle to OSRS be so popular since the genre is dying, especially with OSRS graphics and combat, they shouldnt try to squeeze a few more pennies, if most of the community quit or some of it, the game will start dying,
---
Fuck this one is tempting
---
Idk at this point I think we‚Äôve had enough ‚Äòno mtx‚Äô threads
---
Bubs can't even run the toothy moose
---
Pretty sure it's a marketing deccision
---
Happy cake day!
---
how do you buy he seeds?
---
Someone update the calendar
---
they are already in the game...durp.
---
If the drops are bad then the people with scythes will stop killing it
---
Do you all really think this will happen or are we just bored with our lives?
---
Would have been funnier without the caption
---
Can you only kill Sarachnis on task or can it be killed at anytime?
---
A necessary evil. But still an evil. Introducing more evil won't make the game good/better. Pay walling content/time gating something with another subscription is bullshit. Its "early access" which is to say if you pay twice, you get the content when its done and ready for the game but if you don't. You get the content late.
---
If you are ok with this fine, be the flat Earther of the gaming community. Tens of millions of people are tired of being butt fucked by game companies in new ways. Year after year and won't stand for it.
---
So no source.
---
2.5 million from only 1000 people. On one transaction. 
---
Now imagine those same whales dumping 1000s into other mtx in osrs.
---
It adds up.
---
But i think i honestly read whales don't actually make up that much percentage of the mtx revenue.
---
Its the people who spend $10-$20 a month on small mtx thats adds up.
---
100k people spend 10 a month. Thats 12 million a year... it all adds up very quickly.
---
no?
---
Yes, 1 person playing less or not playing won‚Äôt make a difference even if 2100+ total. If many people do something similar, it will be.
---
Interesting.
---
People were initially against it but became open to a variety of less-intrusive mtx
---
/u/JagexHusky why did you not add an optional instance like KBD?
---
I understand that people didn't want the boss to be instanced, but we should at least have the option. Ironmen are basically locked out of this update until it dies down in a couple weeks.
---
I recommend solo Wintertodt it's fairly easy and  you get more drop .
---
You drop is life at 10% while fletching then lol it at 13 000 point should take 45 min

10-12 or so. Some didn‚Äôt contribute much tbf

What was the response?

I mean as long as you have persistence and patience, itll come eventually.
---
Jagex be like oh how unfortunate the poll got stuck on 75% :\^)

---
No
---

Whoooo
---
Caaaarrreeeessss
---
You had no problem getting a free month membership from twitch so why now?
---
It would of been even sweeter if he ‚Äúlogged out‚Äù but actually was banned right then and there.
---
You got my vote why tf isnt this ingame yet??!?!
---
Stop. Bonds are fine and help most players pay for membership. It‚Äôs not like the coins come from nowhere either, they‚Äôre earned by players and then transferred to another.
---
Oh yeah. I dig that.
---
&gt;You don't need auras for high level pvm. They just help.
---
I think "They just help" Is a massive understatement. Auras vastly improve all PvM encounters, and the aura slot is the second most important gear slot (next to the weapon slot). If you try to do something like Telos without an aura your kills are going to be painfully slow and messy, and you won't be able to get close to the enrage you'd get to if you had an aura on.
---
If you try to join an AoD team and aren't using a zerk or an accuracy aura you are going to get kicked from the team, and rightfully so.
---
I might do that. I‚Äôve done one solo and once I duo‚Äôd with someone. I guess I‚Äôll do a solo today but normally I can‚Äôt commit to that much time straight. Today I can. Thanks.
---
I can buy every item in game with cash irl. I can buy services etc. 
---
I could pay someone thousands of dollars to grind out boss pets for me.
---
Do you realize this changes nothing?
---
No, you still had to move your mouse lol
---
Oh yeah let's remove all skiller skills because you can just bot them
---
Wtf kind of logic is this
---
that would be a little too niche wouldn't it?
---
C: a bad troll
---
You mean literally anywhere else lol
---
Are you racist? What‚Äôs wrong with different colored skin? It gets covered by armor 90% of the time.
---
Just wait 2 years and you can buy the Stick of Deletion to 1 shot that boss on the Squeal of MTX.
---
I can't actually imagine a stupider comment on this topic than this one
---
I've seen private servers that look like this..
---
No, and I believe they give unnoted items, it warned me I needed at least 15 spots free.
---
Slightly better than d skim, but crush.
---
Staff of the Dead also fits that description, but this doesnt require a mage level so it's more accessible. It's a small niche item we'll eventually find use from. 
---
If I had to guess, I think it's probably better at Sandcrab training pures than the d skim is.
---
It is yep greetings pharaoh
---
Bruh you was jus cuh but when you said that? You became fam, deadass. No cap on God my guy
---
I recorded his death when playing that quest and then replayed it over and over again in slow motion.
---
I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at, are you saying MTX doesn't change anything because there's RWT and bot farms?
---
That's what my first thought was if I was still a bit lower level :P
---
That‚Äôs a pretty nice pet too. Better than Venenatis imo.
---
Indeed i'm a filthy botter. This was for other filthy botters(player bots), RSPeer is a hacksite with a slimey owner and admins.
---
You can't inbox downvote you idiot. Way to cry about all your comments getting downvoted and calling ME the hypocrite. Also didn't downvote you because you're wrong but because you're a cunt :)
---
np!
---
How are you gonna prevent someone from pking when you're alone in multi against him and his team of 10 friends?
---
If this guy had a huge group of bolt raggers like the venezuelans then I'd agree with you. But solo ragging in multi isn't really a thing.
---
&gt; What‚Äôs wrong with afking for 20 minutes? Is it some form of blasphemy? Maybe some of us prefer to not have arthritis.
---
Why are you fucking playing this videogame if you don't want to play this videogame

What do you call buying shit that automatically levels your character for real money lmao
---
Wait so this guy gets banned for camping a streamer who choses to expose himself in the wilderness for profit? How is this any diferent when a certain PvP clan targets someone over and over for "Fun"

---
No one there wants it....publicly or wouldn't do it if they we're force to.
---
Fuck MTX but tbh, i wouldn't mind that slayer helm as a future high level desert boss variation lol
---
Mage is more important than range.
---
Bonds allow players that do not have the IRL funds or means to get membership to acquire it. It allows for a larger community and allows players that otherwise might go to seedy sites to buy gold in a safe way. Additionally, it is a cash-neutral method of getting gold (no gold actually enters the game, it just changes hands), so it does not affect inflation. Those are just a few of the ways it benefits the game.
---
You should relax and kick some seagulls dude.
---
I'll stick with tears of guthix, thanks.
---
Idk, everyone calls this MTX so I don't think that could be it
---
Nah, tower of life bots.
---
I'd pay good money for an instant portal to Burger King in my own house
---
He has a missions, and by god is he taking it seriously.
---
Sure, but MTX would fix that issue.
---
rip OP, was nice knowing you
---
..it‚Äôs just fucking cosmetics. The games playerbase has been on a decline  it started to peak up when mobile was released, now it‚Äôs dropping once more. 
---
They‚Äôre to encourage new players to play this slowly dying game before the entire game flops like a fish and died. 
---
But you spoiled brats are so upset over cosmetics that you would eventually get for free anyway. 
---
Like what the fucküòÇüòÇ
---
That's good to know. What gear do you think is suitable considering I only have about 20m?
---
I see what you‚Äôre getting at
---
This has no tangible negative impact on current players, I see no reason why it should be polled.
---
Anybody who is genuinely upset by this is only angry for the sake of being angry.

Hey buddy it's an MMO not a single player game, we dont need more safe death no risk instanced shit!
---
üçµüê∏üí´ Truth Tea Sis üí´üê∏üçµ
---
Starts with cosmetics ends with buying xp lamps
---
You are missing they point, people are mad because of this because due to Jagex reputation to never end MXT when they start it.
---
Most people including me don't care about cosmetics, but what you are seeing here is exacly what happened 8-9 years ago with RS3, what started with "only cosmetics" endes with a fucking dead game plagued with MXT!
---
The playerbase gets to be scared right now and mad over Jagex decidions
---
RS3 was in decline for years. The point of this is to get as many players before the game peaks, increasing the time it takes before the game dies.
---
o\_-
---
Fair change, I agree with the decision
---
This game died once before. It can do it again. The sad part is I just got my fire cape after 10 years. What a short lived celebration.
---

---
English please?
---
&gt;RS3 was in decline for years.
---
Very wrong, RS3  was doing fantastic until the era that brought MXT and ECO, look it up if you want to.
---
Upgraded twisted bow
---
How about making private worlds for these fucking pussy ass streamers? So we wont have to deal with a ban for not knowing that you pked a streamer?
---
This is another arbitrary short sighted change that goes against the spirit of the game and the nostalgia we know and love. OSRS will never be the same again with. Instead of the Lumbridge I know and love we now get a ghost town. Thanks again Jagex.
---
Sure bud. I‚Äôm not looking to argue with you on this because I really don‚Äôt give a shit.
---
thats why i voted yes =D  im not a hypocrite.
---
Seems like no one plays? The player base still grows to this day. It‚Äôs massive. People are always on.
---
Enjoy the holiday but don't forget to vote no to MTX!
---
Streamer Broadcasts Location in Wild, surprised to find player would try to kill him...in the wild....where he is advertising his location.....in a player killing zone.....
---
Streamer cries to mod this man is trying to kill me in the wild over multiple days because I an openly broadcasting where I am in a PK area...mod bans in clear case of favoritism. 
---
Cannot wait to start reporting everyone who PKs me more than one time for targeting me, I expect them all to be banned if this isn't streamer favoritism Jagex, which it clearly is. This streamer is literally broadcasting to the world where he is in the PK area....There is a reason C Engineer is not streaming his HCIM...its really that simple, this is straight sad, and everyone saying this is a jmod smackdown are soft as hell, enjoy your micro transactions. Permabanned for this lmao.
---
Blowpipe + blessed d hide. Trident of swamp occult ma2 cape. Tormented bracket and anguish once you can afford that too. Focus dmg boosting gear before magic/range accuracy gear. Most of your damage will come from mage because you mage red and green while you only range blue phase.
---
That‚Äôs not an issue. It‚Äôs the game. To progress, you need to play the game.
---
I played alot of rs from 2004 till 2012ish, my account is now sitting in rs3. I want to replay some nostalgic stuff with friends i played with back then, but cant because a massive grind is in the way. And no, regaining my stats is not part of the fun, we played till 50 on most skills, but after that the game turns into an impossibly massive grind for someone with a full time job.
---
Honestly I wouldn't. I'd just find something new, Classic wow is doa to me LoL after a 4ish year break is pretty gross feeling to play ( that team fight tactics is dope though ) so that's my 2 back ups gone but I'd find something else. 
---
Playing osrs does make me more look more favourably on rs3 on the other hand and I even jump back into my account iv had since year 7.
---
Missed opportunity to edit in spades into Legolas‚Äô quiver
---
*signs name*
---
Yes and they should have reverted death mechanics years ago but they'd rather make the game have no risk so people don't complain about losing their items in one of the only mmos thats supposed to have a risk element. 
---
Go play a single player game if you want to be completely alone, this is an MMO you are supposed to see other people and fight over resources. Ironman really fucked with so many peoples brains lmao.
---
EXP boosts
---
OSRS has roughly 1 million current users lets say membership is half of those users but probably more. 500K * 11 is 5.5mil revenue a month currently, probably higher. 66mil a year currently. It would be financial suicide to introduce MTX for short term profitability.
---
cool cool
---
I think it's still fun but yes the game has pretty much died because it seems jagex has stopped caring about the game.
---
The fuck would the Jmod gain from replying to the crab hive mind, lol. My guy. On God.
---
Welp. It was nice getting back into Runescape, briefly. 
---
Or it should have been.
---
Getting the unlock later doesn‚Äôt make it any less a mtx. Not to mention there is no telling how long ‚Äúlater‚Äù is, nor how getting it ‚Äúlater‚Äù would be done.
---
It also doesn‚Äôt matter if the target is new players or existing players, existing players will obviously want the content and feel forced to buy to receive it.
---
One off or not doesn‚Äôt matter either, it‚Äôs still an extra transaction for in game features. It meets all the qualities as a mtx.
---
‚ÄúIf it smells like shit, looks like shit, and feels like shit, it‚Äôs shit.‚Äù
---
I agree with pretty much everything the other commenter said. Collector and attacker were the easiest by far. Calling consistently for healer/defender was tough just because there's a lot of other stuff going on. Personally I found healer the hardest just because we had a really low combat attacker so I had to support a lot in the later rounds.
---
Oh i see. Support removal
---
Sounds to me like you got some extra chromosomes. Will you be my extra chromie homie?

Okay thanks, is it not worth initiakly investing in an archers ring then considering it's like 25% of my bank
---
I'm willing to bet half the people here complaining didn't even read the blog, let alone watch the Q&amp;A about it. They just love to complain.
---
Hahhaha love to see this just told this to a mate aswell :p
---
That's what you get for voting no to microtransactions.
---
It‚Äôs time to duel! I place my credit card in face up bankrupt mode!
---
"People keep posting about how the game needs mtx or the price of the game need to increase."
---
That is some VERY selective reading you are doing
---
As much of a shithead he is, I feel like Jagex omitted a step here. I would expect a tempban of let's say, 2 weeks with a notification that next time will be permanent.  Immediate permanent bans are usually reserved for severe offenses like botting and RWT, while toxic behaviour which applies here tends to build up over time.
---
They try to do a lot about botting. Constant changers in their detections, etc. It's just generally hard to get bots. I'm not a coding expert, not do I work at Jagex, but they try to detect as many as they can.
---
For now though, I advice you to go to the Falador Cow pens, there's cows there too, and closer to a bank if you want to bank the hides.
---
Sit LMAO
---
Someone call the whambulance
---
I guess there is more to it - but if this guy really got banned for "harassment" after being permamuted, because a salty, butthurt streamer cried to his J-Mod friend that he got PK'ed in an area \*that is literally designed to PK people\* ... then this is a fucking joke. If it went down as it seems, then this needs to stick high up on the sub so Jagex can understand how scandalous their banning process can be.
---
What if this permamuted, ex-supertoxic fella actually fixed his behavior? Then he decides to drill a streamers ass (which by the way, groups up on solos as well) and just because that streamer sucked ass at PK'ing compared to him, he instantly gets banned?  
---
Sounds perfect, J-Mods
---
Your opinion is less valuable than the shit i took this morning.
---
Regardless of the MTX that they are not implementing. The game is better than it has ever been.
---
"To be completely clear about this - everyone at Jagex, including the CEO himself, is in agreement that¬†we will not add any MTX to Old School RuneScape. We understand that doing so would completely contradict the spirit of what has made Old School a success."
---
Yikes. Settle down pal, we can have a civil discussion. And just because people have done it for a long time doesn‚Äôt make it is not a minor nuisance to me personally. That being said, I obviously was/am aware that if I complained, there wouldn‚Äôt be a productive result so I kept it to myself. 
---
And as you say remove splashing, you know this is just in one specific area, right? You can still splash elsewhere which I‚Äôm in favor of. I would like to clarify I don‚Äôt see a need to remove it. Everyone wins because splashers an still splash, and they‚Äôll be more spread out and less of an eyesore. 
---
And lastly, just because tree runs and clues are my interaction with lumbridge, doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a justified reason for my -until now- hidden distaste for the lumbridge splashing.
---

Does your mouse come with key-remapping software?
---
To be fair, none of those should be in the game.
---
The funny part is that he kinda looks like ash
---
       You were Permbannes because the Streamer felt like you were Stream Sniping him, which a lot of gaming platforms are taking seriously now-a-days.  However this does not justify the ban, considering Jagex has no rules about this, and has twisted their harassment policy to fit their own selfish needs.
---
You must understand how hard it is to get rid of them as once banned it takes no time tp create another to fill its spot.
---
You must be mad at people who buy gold. If no one bought gold, thered be no bots, or not as many.
---
I believe the reason people are thinking it is MTX is because there's not much difference between a payment unlocking something early for you vs a payment unlocking something only for you.
---
I remain hesitantly optimistic that Jagex aren't lying to us, however at the end of the day, if they ever add a single transaction to this game that isn't bonds that the public won't get after a delay, I'm leaving, even if I don't personally think this partnership stuff is a big deal.
---
What‚Äôs microtransations
---
Literally today is a big update and more to come, employee treat has nothing to do with the game, and security isn't problem if you aren't retarded even if you don't have authentication. But I'll give you the mtx thing, buts that's showing interest still so you're still wrong.
---
I‚Äôve seen a few people saying things like this, if this gets the turnout I‚Äôm expecting from people on reddit and whatnot I can‚Äôt wait to see how badly the poll fails lmao.  But then again poll results are hidden now so who knows...
---
thats not even worse than the abomination that already exists, multicoloured graceful
---
Wow this is a joke. Twitch is flushing itself down the toilet already and now this. 
---
It‚Äôs just going to turn into another government controlled platform with heavily biased staff and favouritism based on whoever pushes their political agenda more. 
---
Kind of like Reddit has always been.
---
I'm not trolling does my post sound like trolling because I'll delete it if it does.
---
Decreasing the price of membership won‚Äôt increase their profits or bring new players considering most new players don‚Äôt even leave Tutorial Island before giving up on the game.
---
J1m, checking in again to say you've inspired me to go for a quest point cape. 234 quest points and half way through dragon slayer 2 now, the goal is to have it by the end of summer/before I'm working. Anyway, keep it up, and I hope you're still enjoying the account!
---
Yeah but I went to mine 2 ores, should only deactivate when going into combat with someone or something. Aura‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt exist in general though. They just suck.
---
I'm glad, hate rushers :)
---
Imagine jagex allowing you to buy levels for every skill.... except runecrafting lmao
---
Thanks MTX
---
That's why I said some people in the title, obviously not everyone here wants these.
---
They could rig it either way. What‚Äôs stopping them from just slowly increasing the vote yes counter as time passes? Having them hidden makes this easier because they can literally just change them to whatever they want as long as it looks somewhat reasonable
---
Stop saying people and just say asmongold.

I cant unsee the choppy bird now
---
probably not any time soon. it looks like they're still in the process of whiteboarding it with the recent design doc release; which is good, because it shows they're putting thought and effort into the skill despite what some parts of the community think.
---
i would expect a progress report at runefest, but as for a hard date it's totally up in the air. i'd expect that we'd be seeing a lot of warding blog posts as the poll date comes up, though.
---
Whatever man I see where your coming from, but it still should be polled. This is not an integrity change, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm mad about. If the player base really voted for this I would have no problem and you wouldn‚Äôt see me saying these things. Fact is they are making more and more of these changes and letting the players vote on *cosmetics* instead. I‚Äôm sure you can see where this is going.
---
And ironmen dont need more frustrating unavailable content. Shit sucks. Change the drop mechanics then or make it dangerous, but not multicombat where a significant part of the community can't participate.

---
12.5 thousand accounts up voted this post, many of which agree with the sentiment of dropping their subscription. I'm not trying to convince you, I'm just trying to point out that no one gives a shit about your opinion and WILL drop their subscription if this passes. Many of these users I'm sure have multiple subscriptions, so yes, this will likely hurt Jagex and OSRS.

I know it probably wont but it's a gamble and it's the least they can do for the players they have since the game is dying.

John Oliver is a comedian. I promise you he's got the green light to say whatever he says about his advertisers. Your counter argument is literally a point to the contrary argument, not your own...

From your viewpoint it's MTX, from their viewpoint it's giving out freebies to new players.

Why? Buying gold is the same as buying cosmetics, buying exp, buying BiS gear, etc

The second most egregious form of MTX is already been embraced by the community with open arms. Partnerships aren't the slippy slope that leads to MTX. Buying gold was and y'all got duped.
---
Yeah, as of today. But before, that's where lots of them came from
---
Yes that‚Äôs still the meta
---
Gonna be honest as everyone is saying you‚Äôre ‚Äútoxic‚Äù first off that word is overused, secondly it‚Äôs an online video game where real shit is said. Anyone should be allowed to say whatever and if someone doesn‚Äôt like it, they should mute you. Period. I also noticed people are quick to report for anything that happens in RS. Either way, good luck with your quest, you‚Äôre more than likely screwed.
---
awh man, I was looking forward to that
---
Because first 8 seasons are comedy gold and can be used almost at any ocassion, that's why.
---
I have no idea what this game is or why any of this is relevant to the front page, but you may want to consult a psyhiatirc specialist because from what I'm seeing, you have a few isms that may need diagnosis and treatment.
---
Ha....69 hard
---
Hahahahahahhaa enjoy your permaban you fucking pussy. You deserve it, bitch.

---
I would have renewed membership early to play this (waiting on Song of the Elves), but not much point if I can't even fight the boss.
---
thank you man. i really appreciate it &lt;3
---
But how does this not make buyables easyscape?
---
Three quarters should be fine.
---
sriracha is a style of sauce not a brand. really not the same thing at all.
---
It was said in the poll. Even if Sriracha didn't come in, red spider eggs were leaving.
---
I think you have to find where they were touting that and what they meant. 
---
These graphs show nothing comparable one million. A common sense check would say that we never see 1,000,000 active players on the front page so the number you are thinking probably applies to the number of players who log over a long period of time rather than the active number of players online at any given time. 
---
"Every five minutes, a perl script contacts the front page of Runescape and scrapes the displayed number of online players." These numbers stand. 
---
Your number of one million does not not stand. If you believe that it does, please show its evolution over time to confirm your belief that numbers are in decline. I would hate to think that your evidence is based on a value of one million that you are unsure of and can not properly propagate in time.
---
i dont think PvPing in a place where youre allowed to PVP is considered harrasment no matter how many times you do it in however many days, that doesnt even make sense..
---
Regardless, changing a core game mechanic for one area is a terrible design choice. This needs no explanation.
---
And after the drops aren't worth fuckall anymore.
---
If its not for you its not for you, nothing wrong with that. 
---
But personally, i find the most enjoyment out of wanting something cool, working toward it, then achieving it. 
---
For example ive been going for 99 farming recently so im spending most of my play time making money with the goal of buying seeds, once i finish im going to feel good lol. 
---
I also treat the game as an idle game sometimes and set my guy up in nightmare zone while doing something else and his combats are slowly rising, opening up more paths for bossing and end game content that seems fun like god wars and what not. 
---
Tldr: set goals, achieve goals, gain endorphins
---
This counts as recolourscape.

You‚Äôre missing the point it seems. People generally aren‚Äôt concerned with as WHAT comes from these upcoming partnerships, the thing is, this is exactly how rs3 awful mtx all started. It was the exact same shit which eventually led to what it is now where you can literally just buy xp. People are afraid of osrs becoming that.
---
It's not an update for ironmen. The boss is being camped by max players who just scythe spec it, so mid level players can't try to fight the boss.
---
FUEL JET CANNOT MELT BEAMS OF STEEL
---
Is the poll live now? Let's do this boys
---
What is the best budget melee armor set? When I quit playing back in 2012 I had the barb assault top, torrags legs, obsidian cape, nietz helm, combat bracelet, glory amulet, and ring of wealth. Is this still a solid armor set or is there something else more efficient?
---
You are getting concurrent players and active players mixed up.
---
I want mtx now thanks
---
I just went back and checked, they never even polled it :(
---
It‚Äôs the first day of the update my dude. I highly doubt it will stay this crowded in a few days.
---
Yes I‚Äôm certain I went, and I would also be skeptical if I were reading this.
---
It took place in a location need Baker Street tube station and when I‚Äôm on my computer I‚Äôll get some appropriate proof (on mobile currently).
---
They paid us ¬£60 in cash per person and it was held at a sort of focus group company that rents out rooms and records them.
---
No id be the same mate. I‚Äôll post some proof when I‚Äôm on my computer
---
It's runescape bro you're better off being banned.
---
What trade secrets? MTX is no secret that Jagex just came up with. And saying the final decision is the owner‚Äôs/shareholder‚Äôs won‚Äôt get someone fired.
---
Crab meme was one of the worst and most used meme that i ever saw.
---
He literally said it should be polled stop opening Reddit with the sole intent of being a fucking cunt to people.
---
You set your freaking profile picture to the guy you killed in-game, and called him a ‚ÄúSlimeball Paki‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs no detection whatsoever that they can tell what button you‚Äôre pressing to do what. If your x key = space bar they will only see a space bar input. You‚Äôre perfectly safe to remap any keys to anything you‚Äôd like.
---
Is this where I go for logic? Or is this where I get my ticket to enter in the circle jerk?
---
Because the results were visible, it would arise suspicious if results were different overnight. I know it's always possible but the point is now they can do it without detection.
---
How is the Sarachnis cudgel going to stack up? Where will it be useful? My Initial thought is that the leaf bladed battle axe should always be used over it due to strength, but will the speed out way it? Even so, where is it useful?
---
? It's in need of a buff almost more than any other weapon. Its only current purpose is for speccing when pking
---
If mtx comes to osrs, this will be the darkest timeline
---
LOL, get fucked pussy.
---
This reminds me. Gotta do my herb run
---
"this game is getting MTX, I'm going to WoW classic in protest"
---
lol
---
Nowadays yes, that's why classic wow is gonna be so good :)
---
I too think it will come no matter what.
---
I'm indifferent about it to be honest.
---
Low level gold buyers in full bandos make me ashamed to wear my gear
---
Moral of the story is don't be toxic to others.
---
They need old death timers, you should have a chance of losing items on death. That's one of the the big things that made RS unique.
---
That dude gets way more pussy than you.
---
You do if you want to know what you're talking about. Otherwise your comparison means nothing and you say some dumb shit like: "the electoral college comes in and for some reason overrides the entire population‚Äôs decision"
---
First of all, overriding an entire population would mean the vote was 100% for one candidate, which is already impossible. Now please, go away. Read a book.

---
They announced this while most big content creators are at Jagex HQ testing the new elf quest.
---
They know they won't be speaking out against it while they are being hosted at Jagex's expense.
---
it was on the homepage for the game I remember seeing it when I thought about getting back into the game back in 2013 to 2015 after I heard about the eoc since I left after the dungeonering update, so if someone has a screenshot of the homepage from back then please post it here. I'm actually starting to wonder if they were trying to skew the numbers to benefit themselves.
---
lol I was running by giant red crystals at the blood altar while reading this.
---
Bye nerd
---
Goodjob, maybe someday you'll learn a real pvm boss, shouldn't be hard with moms cc.
---
I see crabs I upvote crabs.
---
When osrs was released it was released with the idea that all updates would be polled except for serious integrity changes. If this doesn't negatively affect anyone then it would pass the poll easily. And if it doesn't pass, well then that shows the majority of people who care about the game enough to vote don't mind.
---
Neat idea, but hunter isn‚Äôt f2p
---
*reads mods reply* fuck you OP
---
I thought they showed it off in the qna, so they already had the pic
---
You'll need all the reqs to start the quest. You do only need to get to that part of the quest to use the method, yes. Though finishing the quest has its benefits, even for using the training spot.

Torso has same offensive stats as BCP, but lower def stats. In my opinion its worth to grind. It only takes 3-4 hours if you are first timer.
---
They've started banning people for successfuly PKing streamers.
---
&gt;a bunch of big words
---
Is that how you view simple adjectives? Lol 
---
If you're an adult who still uses "gay" as "stupid", then you've still got some growing up to do.
---
Reminder that the item Chronicle exists.
---
It would be generous to say 10% of the population would quit. The profit they would make off of implementing it anyways would easily out weigh that player exodus quickly. 
---
You also have a lot of players saying ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll quit‚Äù but will probably justify to themselves short term ‚Äúawh I‚Äôve put 2000 hours into this so far I‚Äôll play for a bit more, it is only cosmetics anyways rn, not like it‚Äôs gone full pay to win‚Äù.

The enlightened journey part is pretty much doing the minigame from the quest, after selecting Gnome Stronghold as your destination.

After completing that, you‚Äôll unlock the route. It requires 65-70 fm iirc, nothing too crazy.

What's wrong with catering to high levels?

Nice, I can finally make that OSRS-exclusive, non-slayer, non-wildy, non-instanced standalone boss only ultimate ironman.

Dungoneering - Bad

Seen so many people doing this at the GE. Don't trust them, they're just like any normal beggar.

still looks better than rs3

yep and by the time any mid lvl player can get to it the item is worth 200k and you are losing money killing it.

KFC bucket helm that's +7 str and can be made into a slayer helm.

Sorting by new was a mistake today
---
Find a friend to duo it. I did it on release day like that. Raid took 2 and a half hours, but since that was before anyone even had any clue how raids work that should be a decent gauge of what you can do with no experience whatsoever.
---
You'll probably die and get almost no points, but you'll get the diary task. 
---
Or if you plan to actually get into raiding, check out the WeDoRaids discord. Good luck!
---
How would OSRS players voting in RS3 do that? All RS3 MTX is forced into the game unlike OSRS MTX like cosmetics or bonds.

That's what you get for being Dutch :)

As other people have said, it's the repetition against a targeted player that makes it be considered harrassment.

The fact that he was already perma muted for being extremely toxic also led to the fact that his punishment is a permaban. This isn't his first time breaking rules.

That's the type of person he is.

---
Hello am lvl 51 need bond to vote no on jamflex.
---
Gamers rise up!
---
Because it is "easyscape" regardless whether there are bonds or not. Bond is an alternative, healthy-for-the-game way of buying gold. If you say gp purchasable through real life money equals easyscape buyables, then buyables would always be easyscape. You can always buy gp through rwt, whether bonds exist or not.
---
I was under the impression that it required both. My brain is scrambled.
---
Also, I think there's a free to play botfarm on port sarim seagulls 
---
on certain worlds it's filled with these mohawk warriors who just train up strength (?) on them all the damn time

If you're an ironman and you think its bad now, you just wait till all the bots start farming it.

Correct, maybe about ~500k after breaking even if people use scythe and serp helm after costs
---
Deja Vu
---
Wow this dungeon is amazing, it really feels Old School 
---
This has me even more excited for Prifdinnas I can see the OSRS team is really improving

Because the only ones left were the people yelling "if it's just cosmetics it's fine." And "Well you don't have to buy it".

Yeah but only because of the weapon price, depends on how long it stays that price

Didn‚Äôt you read the drama calendar
---
I feel like Jagex knows that MTX is killing RS3. I mean it isn't a hidden fact to us anymore either with the new financial statement. Mobile probably pushed a lot of that up too. There has to be a give, MTX gives short term profit in exchange for potential death of a product.
---
I don't think this comes down to just OSRS players voting in RS3, the players would have to unify. EA didn't just remove loot boxes from Battlefront 2 on a whim, they did it because they seriously harmed the star wars franchise and they made law makers question if loot boxes were gambling(still in process). I think our route to success follows a similar path. The more we get then the stronger we get.
---
All in all, MTX needs to go. Even if the cosmetics fail here, we can't be sure that it will stop forever. If MTX left RS3, or even got to a point of being tolerable it would be a benefit to both OSRS and RS3. I'm spitballing pretty hard, and I know it probably isn't the strongest idea in the world. I do believe we can win this fight though.
---
I totally play runescape now just because of mobile play, I used to play for like 8years back in 05.
---
Community.
---
As someone with a degree in economics, I think you're suffering from a little bit of Dunning-Kruger, my friend. Runescape membership is not a price-elastic good. The data we have, and I'm sure Jagex's own private market research, has clearly shown that increases to the price of membership on the scale we've seen don't have a terribly negative effect on the number of customers buying their product. Why then you would assume that lowering the price would not just bring huge numbers of people in, but increase revenue on top of that, is beyond me  
---
You're playing a very glorified nostalgia experience for a very specific age group that grew up with one specific version of a long-running MMORPG. The goal isn't to become bigger than WoW, and surely you understand there is no hope for such a thing happening. The reality is that this project doesn't appeal to most modern consumers. Lowering the price does not change that, and would only cut into its funding for, well, no clever reason
---
You think I'm saying things I never said. I was stating facts not opinions. 
---
Either way, I think you need to tone down the gatekeeping bro. What bandwagon are you even talking about?
---
You can't grind it outside of tithe yes. But the minutes you spend farming is why it's 1.3m/hr effectively. Because you finish your run and then go and trading something else
---
Classic Lager, so I can drink up to 99 strength and go for the 100kg (225lb) power clean and jerk demonstrated by the strength cape emote.
---
But with the response from the player base there‚Äôs no way anyone thinks this actually passes whether we can see it or not. But we shouldn‚Äôt have to see the results until after the poll anyways. Everyone should vote for themselves and not based on what the community says. Either way, if this poll doesn‚Äôt go how we think it will, we know something is up. Thousands voting no every day and posting proof online is enough of a visual for the current results.
---
No, it's definitely weird.
---
Eh I actually like the cosmetic stuff in rs3
---

---
My friend who is in the top 10 has 5 alts at once
---
Last one was a Death Cape! Also can't forget about all the custom whips (Lava, Lime, etc)
---
yea Thats usually how it is.
---
They didn't remove splashing
---
Thanks couldnt tell after the 50+ posts
---
Correct
---
It has already been ruined in OSRS from bonds when you can P2W all your buyable skills.
---
I always wear graceful when I do barrows.
---
Dungeoneering is a lot of work and it's already in RS3, so if people want to play Dungeoneering, they can just play it on RS3, the devs would rather spend their time on unique content for OSRS. They also mention that the rewards would have to be balanced since they know how controversial the original DG rewards are but that's asking for a lot, especially since they currently have content (an entire minigame rewards shop) that's lacking in rewards (if they have any at all). They also don't trust it when people say they don't need rewards and that it'll be fun regardless because when they release "for fun" content, it ends up as dead content.
---
That's the official answer they gave when presented with this question, it's also the same answer they gave to questions like: Add While Guthix Sleeps, Add Nex, Add Soul Wars, etc.
---
Furthermore, they also mention Corp Beast because people ask why it was the exception, it's just because it was the first one and they didn't really understand how much work it was until they actually did it.
---
Warding is fine, people like you didn't even read the update post about it lmao
---
Er-rit er-rit
---
I add it to my salads to make them less dull, has to be better for you than Caesar sauce and even if it‚Äôs not Idm
---
Considering the account I currently play was made in 2005, I can safely say I started before 2008. That's just the time period I sank most of my time into the game.
---
Osrs and rs3 are different games now so to compare them isn't really fair.
---
Saying bots were a problem back then, I can assure you bots are more of a problem now. With gold farmers from all over the world having access to better computers and able to run hundreds of bots at once. Botting now is the worst it has ever been.
---
And of course the community is different. We're 12 years past the point of when runescape was in its glory days. But we aren't talking about osrs now, or rs3 now. We're talking about Rs2.
---
People have different opinions of when they think rs was at its best and that's fine. That's when we fell in love with the game. That's when we remember playing with our friends and making new friends along the way. Some of which we may still be friends with outside of runescape now.
---
Oh look cosmetics on a f2p game is just look at p2p games, are you dumb?
---
Splashing is eventually being removed all together, so. 
---
Glad it's going.
---
no they tried to make loads of questions to influence results towards people voting yes on any one of them
---
Omfg, please. "Cosmetic is optional" fu, players in this game farm hunddreds of hours just to get a pet. Saying cosmetic is optional is purely selfish. It's not because it does not appeal to you that it is "optional" . Everything in a Sandbox game is optional.
---
not for top tier players who aims for number 1 spots
---
Alright, what's your suggestion? =P
---
I rly don't understand the excuses Jagex gives as to why it wouldn't 100% be a good idea
---
I feel like there's something cool and nostalgic about the boss just being *there* but in reality this game kinda can't deal with it
---
Ranarr*
---
For me its absolutely one or the other. When nostalrius was taken down I went to OSRS, when it went back up I went back to wow.
---
most ppl use it. just use common sense with plugins.
---
What's good about this type of social element? It builds toxicity. We can just have team bosses like raids instead.
---
Yes, they removed the part of the quest that needed fairy ring access.
---
see giant mole, alot of the worlds are taken by pet hunters
---
They're interchangeable tbh
---
If I piss you off will you send me $11 too?
---
Is there a way to check how the Cully chest from RFD works?
---
For example, right now I have the requirements for 4 of the RFD subquests, and almost have the requirements for one or two more.
---
I should be able to do every sub-quest besides Amik Varze, Awowogei, Lumby Guide, and Evil Dave without issue now, and will work on those next, but what rewards will that get me?  
---
I can't really figure it out from the wiki.
---
These already aren‚Äôt funny anymore.
---
Imagine being the poor schmuck paying for a subscription just do have those resources and dev time get dumped into content you then have to pay additional fees for. Imagine how much more content the game could have if none of the items in that picture were ever considered or worked on, that's why the "MTX doesn't effect you because you can choose not to use it" argument has no weight.
---
This is really good. Nice post.
---
Oh shit only a little over a month away until half my front page will be filled with QoL requests for classic wow. That game was inherently anti-fun in a lot of aspects.
---
It would be like if 2007 rs was catered to not having end game content until you 100m+ your skills. Needless amounts of lengthy grinds, and heaps of missing QoL that people will quickly remember they quite enjoy (dungeon queues for example.. I don't miss trade chat just spamming with people forming dungeon groups)

How does it affect you?  What do you care if other people do it?  
---
I‚Äôve never seen a source of them saying they are completely removing splashing from the game.  
---
Just let people do what they want to.   It hurts no one and some people really enjoy it.
---
That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt really ban anymore for rwt lol
---
I'd love to see soul wars. the xp wasnt op but it was a niche way to train prayer and hp for those odd accounts, popular enough for people to play.
---
That doesn't help either party.  There's no incentive for people to subscribe to Twitch Prime, and we still get random shit that would be better off earned through related content instead of shilled by a third party company.
---
Don't forget all the bots.
---
Cute
---
What are some easy Diaries with decent rewards? That can be done at a lowish level (I'm around base 40s in all non combat stats)
---
So far I have done Varrock, Lumby and Wild easy. I am working on Fremmy easy and Varrock medium. Which should I work on next?
---
Tfw you look so bad that all someone has to do is upload a photo of you and people automatically assume they‚Äôre making fun of your appearance
---
I've stated that competition is healthy for the economy. Not everything has to be a hand-holding experience. If you experience toxicity, go do something else, like raids and wait for the hype to die down.
---
T E L E B L O C K
---
I wish I had gold to give you
---
Yea, those, sorry haha.
---
Yes it is, in all likelihood more players use Runelite than don‚Äôt. 
---
However don‚Äôt buy into the hype around Runelite ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù. It is not developed by the same people, and it contains many plug ins that were specifically forbidden by Jagex. Avoid a ban and possibly a hacking as well, download Runelite directly from the official website (the one with .net), and good luck on your grind my friend :)
---
I love RuneScape and I don‚Äôt mind them profiting to keep the game running. I don‚Äôt mind Osrs partnering up with a company, only if it‚Äôs just a promotion and everybody gets stuff for free. Once they say you must pay this amount for this item, I‚Äôm out and I‚Äôm pretty sure a lot of other people will be too.
---
protip: fix the ass and repost
---
Ah thanks! It was even mentioned here multiple times but it didn't click for me that the "Community" everyone was mentioning was the name of the show.
---
Jagex hasn‚Äôt been hacked though so that is irrelevant? Aside from the few who were hacked from the inside crooked dev I suppose. None of it was due to poor security though.
---
You pay money, you receive purple skin in game.
---
Literally the definition of mtx
---
I just want to look like Konar that‚Äôs it
---
Can‚Äôt lie, love the update but I feel like a lot of the new weapons look a little silly
---
This time next year: 
---
"Its a shame we lost over half our player base to WoW Classic and not the MTX we added. Speaking of, check out this weeks new lamp on the Squeal of Fortune 2.0." -some mod
---
Because it's not safe for work. In fact what they are doing here is very dangerous. Don't try it at home or at work.
---
U should remove this, bad people will use the information to get hold of your account!
---
jagex knows that if mtx fails and they still force it they will lose a lot of players which means less $$. so once it fails it wont happen unless higher ups force it.
---
Just imagining if vMA would be not instanced... 
---
OH GREAT, let's wait 50 minutes before someone completes his run. (if he's good ofc, newcomers need wait longer than that)
---
I'm really glad ESO has instances for the most PvM stuff. Non-instanced is there, but atleast everyone gets a loot when participating in a zone boss fight.
---
So would my example be MTX then? Since it's the same except instead of cosmetics you get a BiS item
---
Bonds are already mtx.
---
actually no it wasn't a dev I remember hearing it was actually someone from india or something.
---
No one cares.
---
Not smart to post the date your account was created as it is a key part of recovering an account.
---
I don't think you do, but even if you had, most banks have a feature that allows you to make e-cards for safe online purchasing
---
Well, at least in Brazil
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind partnerships if they stayed low key like this
---
Have you killed how many of them? How did you kill them? 
---
Btw, the wiki is updated and now lists them as uncommon, same as rannarr weeds, will those tank in price too? 
---
Anyway, the only people that will camp them is venezuelans and ironmen realistically. You make roughly 300-500k an hour and have to either range and use ppots or bring food and ppots. 
---
I‚Äôm not really sure which is faster in the long run, i only have just around 200 under my belt and those were mostly with bp.
---
find me ig for a nat and 5 fires
---
No fuck that, just have everything drop like before tombstones. What a terrible update that was (or at least up until you die and lose your stuff)
---
At this rate we will need old school 2 in a couple years :(
---
what'd they sell for?
---
I haven‚Äôt played since mobile full release(just got bored), but I will be sure to do my part.
---
it's Julian's fourth birthday
---
alright, thanks for the answers guys. :)
---
What exactly can OSRS players do to help remove MTX in RS3?
---
You reported someone who is not botting for botting? You avoided a city because people were splashing? You‚Äôre the problem here, not them.
---
I mean are we supposed to bring it up again? 
---
They wanted it taken down because runelite went a too little far showing deobfuscated code. We did the reeing, the devs took out that part and any other plugins Jmods had problems with, and we went on our merry way.
---
Just got he same one wtf
---
My 2 favourite things in a crossover. Thanks :)
---
nowadays yes and it kills the social aspect of MMOs 
---
dont know if you ever played wow back before it was shit but the best parts of the game were being out in the world and fighting world bosses, grouping for quests, exploring and going to dungeons or raids which were instanced but you still needed to find people and get to the entrance which could be camped by other guilds on the opposite faction etc. RS was like that too where you would meet someone and go to gwd or other bosses. huge part of MMOs is the social aspect which unfortunately is being pushed away because casual audiences would rather sit alone for 10 hours killing a boss with 0 risk of losing anything by themselves.
---
I've never played it but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Monster Hunter?
---
A man after my own heart. Wish you all the best.
---
As always, thank you for this.
---
Idk blizzard is pretty careful when it comes to selling content
---
A week or two lmao
---
At the same time, we have never had such a receptive and community-driven development team. Plus the ceo nowadays is saying "there will be no mtx" instead of "mtx will be an integral part of our growth"
---
I trust this team way more than the one in rs2
---
I‚Äôve never loved the OS community more.
---
partner with a clothing company and sell osrs themed clothes. id buy a skillcape hoodie.
---
I like black/white and green. No time for haters.
---
[relevant] (https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/62d5x2/pplease_dont_throw_me_at_the_skeleton_monkeys/)
---
Probably because they fear people would complain about forced random events.
---
They were made optional for a reason.
---
I'd love forced randoms again personally.
---
I think it would be kind of cool to enchant wine or some lore to turn grapes and jugs to Z wine. Instead of relying on drops, you learn to bless it.
---
Crab Rave by Noisestorm, Monstercat is the publisher
---
Why so happy, a funeral is nothing to be excited about
---
Use crude chair -&gt; rope lol
---
\&gt; same as rannarr weeds, will those tank in price too? 
---
Yes because the demand for the two is totally comparable.  That being said, Ranarrs have tanked twice already this summer so was there a point here?
---
Again, I'm not really sure where you're going with this.  Z wines will tank in the coming months at least some amount.  At this point I'll just bookmark this post and get back to you when it happens.
---
Some people seem to genuinely like RS3 for some things like the quests and bosses (never did the bosses outside the dungeoneering ones, so I have no opinion on those), but there are many more who seem to play RS3 only because of the time sink on their accounts.
---
Oh god I want to die
---
At a quick glance this looked like Slugma from Pok√©mon. Then I realized the chins were stacked.
---
Yep.
---
No artificial timegates.
---
No real-world trading. 
---
No partnerships.
---
Add cosmetics you earn in-game, that's cool. Preferably cosmetics you actually craft.
---
What‚Äôs CEO‚Äôs name?
---
Let's be real, some of us have been playing for 5, 10, 15 years. We probably spent over a thousand on this one game.
---
They could, but are less likely to get away with it if the poll results are transparent throughout the duration of the poll.
---
It‚Äôs okay enjoy your hand tonight bum
---
Thanks for the advice. I better start training slayer lol!
---
This isn‚Äôt unpopular opinion it‚Äôs the opinion of about 400 other people that have made the same post in the past 2 days üòÇ
---
&gt; It only takes bot makers a short amount of time to rewrite a script to get around stuff so yeah it would slow them down but only for a short time while real players would always be effected
---
But how? How do you write a script that can identify a specifc random object in a fluid pool of random objects that change colors, scale and dimension? 
---
You'd need machine learning AI to do that, and even then it wouldn't be flawless.
---
Thats not how those surveys work. Unless you're typing your info into them or MAYBE they have your email address and someone matches that to a database dump. Other than that they can't just get your account info from that shit.
---
Same
---
Assuming ranks will be like they were back in the day, spade hunters that switch over have an infinite grind for high PvP titles.
---
I know but I want to remove them from circulation in the economy, to send an ironic message, a message ironic for it will not be heard, but it exists. 
---
Also my friend don't go to Nurmof for a cannon he'll just try to sell you mining tools, your looking for Nulodion. 
---
Idk about your level demographic projection for these anti-mtx but I'm relatively low level (85) but its irrelevant since I've been past level 40 a few times since 2004. For accuracy you should go around saying "This is how you can tell anti-MTXers have played for like 30 hours tops"
---
Its only slightly off peak population count right now and I just hopped at mole until the limit and 8/22 of the worlds were taken. That means you have a 75% chance of finding a free world on the your first try. I think you guys might be being a bit dramatic.
---
A cape like this but with all in-game god symbols and RS instead of LV would be pretty neat as a parody cape you can wear in-game lol.
---
Man that point about having the swamp on first and swampletics. I hope he denounces the fuck out of this shit.
---
Jmod likes lil girls
---
What?
---
is only game y u hef 2 be mad?
---
Lmfao imagine defending rs3 cosmetics
---
Still, could have left it at Nieves cousin.
---
why are you talking about osrs? I've been talking about runescape as a whole.
---
They solved the random event that already exists with the rotation objects so it is likely. The problem is the random has to be something that can also be coded into the game so it can't be too random or crazy of images.
---
OP is just a small indie-memer trying to get funded.
---
Runescape is dying right? That's why it's been steadily growing for quite some time. No wonder you're getting downvoted
---
Jagex investors wish they were that cup
---
Unpopular Fact: People will buy gold regardless of the existence of Bonds.
---
I only mentioned that because people thought I didn't take any and also they were collage classes I took through high school.
---
I don't know shit about business, so I would like an explanation.
---
These changes, yeah, that might be able to bring in a lot of extra short term profit.
---
But isn't it obvious that long term profit will plummet so much that the game shuts down? It won't be soon, but this game will eventually become less and less popular until even whales couldn't support the game.
---
Isn't this just the beginning of a drawn out suicide by Jagex? What are they thinking?
---
So the answer is to add more? I wish bonds would get deleted but that's never happening
---
D defender. Barrows gloves. Fire cape. 70 prayer.
---
It's not instanced I thought? Just go get your shit back.
---
Can Anyone explain What mtx is? Out of The loop here
---
Currently the plan is, if your hit chance with a spell is always 0, ie splash only, and you're in that Lumbridge area it will not prodive xp, but the way they worded it it seems they plan on taking it out completely down the line.
---
they didn't poll it
---
It's probably not worth doing day 1.
---
Uhh it‚Äôs MTX.
---
Dont worry guys. All is forgiven due to the bank rework.
---
 **Microtransactions** (sometimes abbreviated as MTX) are a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micropayments. **Microtransactions**are often used in free-to-play games to provide a revenue source for the developers.
---
Either way, y'all are super worked up about fuckin red skin on runescape
---
People went to lumby because there is a high abundance of rats and a large group of people. Makes you feel like part of the community or something.
---
Same reason most people afk hangout at the GE
---
Beneath the surface each object has a unique ID. OSRS being a Java game means bots can hook into the client and "see" what all the IDs are.  There isn't any way to visually block those, the shape shifting randoms are around from when color-based bots were used (which can not access object IDs).  
---
The "null zone" idea was done in RS Classic 15 years ago, (look up the "disk of returning")  
---
In RS2 randoms were changed to teleport your player to a random area but the randoms are no longer effective at stopping bots which is why you are allowed to dismiss them nowadays.
---
Fortunately you can now listen to creepy monster stories on Audible while playing!  
---
Just use the URL extension /MTXScape
---
Varrock. You can claim battle staves daily for some nice money.
---
Scythe, inferno max cape wearing virgins.
---
Quality üòÇ
---
Even has Soul Edge, nice touch.
---
They haven't. People are just having a giggle, mountains out of mole hills, that sort of thing.
---
hey, in their defense, they replaced Squeal of Fortune with Alice. Which is definitely not the same thing. Alice has boobs.
---
My favourite so far
---
K thanks for the clarification. Didn't think it was all about a fear that JAGEX manipulates the result at a crucial time and not the fact that people follow a herd.
---
Mtx stands for micro transactions which are one of the things credited with ruining rs3. Its basically pay to win system where real money will get you bonuses in game.
---
I am, finally after losing my accounts to countless double exp ads I can now safely play at the weekends with this long awaited boost. I am excited.
---
as great as these ideas are, the blog post did specifically mention a desire to attract more players, not simply make more money. sponsored esports probably wouldn't attract as many NEW players as the twitch prime promotion did. just speculation ofc
---
not since they made 366 a 1500 world, we need all people to riot
---
Yeah, then all the bots will take their place.
---
Dude if you played back in the day you might really enjoy playing as an ironman. Oh and for sure get members, the game is amazing.
---
Its pretty easy to make money with it eventually. A pain early but useful as all hell. You can also use wines for training mage/range to lower cost. They are mass produced so they are only 3 or 4 gp ea but heal 11. They do however lower melee stats. I've helped a fair few switch to osrs in the past.
---
we've been fighting since 2010
---
So fucking accurate
---
bonds were bundled with free to play.
