Gratz!
---
Yeah but if my opponent says “well played” I don’t see it as BM to say it back. Idk I guess it just me. Not for nothing but it was a mirror match so it 100% could have been the other way around
---
3 Mana spawn a 3/3 wolf for your opponent next turn.

It gets tricky around rank 20, whizbang is all memes and no good.
---
i played paper modern for years. I doubt you go backwards because the coding is a nightmare
---
oh wow. That actually appears to be the exact kodo model and running animation directly from WoW. Never realized that.
---
why would it?
---
But it fails because you can't tutor out inner fire or glitter moth currently. Also glittermoth is hot stinky garbage.
---
It is very easy to hit the 18 deck limit.   You have standard decks and wild decks.  For each deck, sometimes I have 2 or 3 variants of it with different tech cards.(\*\*)
---

---
Also, I keep decks around for specific daily challenges, e.g.  "Play 6 weapons",  "Play 20 Murlocs", etc.
---
\*\* Instead of having different variants of a deck with only 1 or 2 cards different, I'd like to have a single deck with some extra cards tagged as game-time decisions; When you start a game with the deck, Hearthstone should prompt you to choose X out of Y cards.  That way I might have 28 core cards and then another 2 cards I want to choose from a pool of 5 tech cards based on the local meta at my rank, etc.    Probably too hard for hearthstone devs implement...

"If you need cards from wild for a deck I would advise just crafting the few cards that are still viable over buying 40 packs and hope you get one of the legendary cards"
---
these things are the same in non wild packs outside of classic. 
---
Yup
---
Well yea, if you said well played in response to the loser's "well played" it can't be bm. I guess people just become unreasonable when they become frustrated lol.
---
I don't really think we need more. 
---
 Wouldn't mind having Standard and Wild decks in different slots (counts of 18) though. 
---
Glittermoth + innerfire is great, but it doesn't beat plain old divine spirit inner fire combos
---
ok cool, thanks for the answer! figured there wasnt a tracking system, i was going to just save gold until the April expac, but i might buy 10 of the expacs i missed
---
Each expansion you haven't opened a pack for starting in July-ish last year.  You certainly opened classic packs before the change so you don't get the first 10 bonus on those
---
The Quest screen also works
---

It did great at EU Playoffs. Meati and Tars brought it (Tars' version had Floop's Glorious Gloop in it), both went 5-2 in matches and missed the top-8 on tiebreakers. Tars had 4-1 game record with the Druid deck, I don't know Meati's individual game results.
---
It's gotten worse over the years.  I have a bunch of people on my friends list from the early days. I used to use emotes appropriately.  Now I just auto-squelch.
---
Rank 5 is quite good to get!  if you're having issues, slowing down a bit and watching some pro streamers might help, as they often do things and consider certain plays that might not be obvious.
---
I definitely agree that the tracker is the worst, but time tinkerer can be the best due to insane rng. However, in terms of consistency and final boss encounter (Glinda), Hound Master is probably the best of the best. All I would change here is putting Time Tinkerer at 2 because Cannoneer can sometimes be rough due to the 1 damage per cannonshot (that can be buffed later), and that Time Tinkerer can go endless with Auctionmaster Beardo. The only credit that I'll give Tracker is the ability to otk The Whisperer on the first turn using A Small Rock (0 mana) an endless amount of times.
---
Yeah fuck people who are trying to win, god I hate them
---
Did you start playing yesterday? 
---
Nothing happened, it's still one of, if not the best deck in the format. It does have come pretty tough matchups against control, but so does Odd Rogue if you don't draw Loatheb.
---
But be careful. As soon as you switch to Odd Warrior you will only get OTK decks (story of my life Q.Q)
---
It's the same for me! I see all these other card games trying to come out and they look so bland! My dream is for a Pokemon Trading Card Game to come out with something similar!

Idk, from my experience at rank 5+ it really seems like Even Shaman is top tier. All of the listed Tier 1 decks lose to it consistently except for Odd Warrior and sometimes Reno Lock (it's an honest toss-up). Am I missing something? 
---
I swear. People like you have zero patience. The game will drastically change in 2 and a half months (give or take). There is literally no reason to nerf hunter. It will lose so much of its tools. 
---
Now I do agree hearthstone needs more nerfs for balance purposes, but I honestly don't even find Hunter that bad. Odd Paladin and things like Pirate Warrior (back in the day) were WAY worse.
---
[Nat Pagle lethal](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F86L4dd2g0s)
---
Who plays cheaty anklebiter in an even paladin? I mean it works for Corpsetaker, but this is a mecha'thun warlock card if anything. 
---
Consider the following:
---
&gt;Tier 1
---
&gt;Odd Rogue
---
&gt;Almost the entire meta-relevant Control Squad
---
&gt;Tier 2
---
&gt;Big Priest
---
&gt;Mid/Even Shaman
---
&gt;Old Tier 2
---
I think Toki's the worst. Tracker is by far the strongest.
---
Toki's the worst in the early game and Tess is worst in the late game.
---
Yeah seems like whenever you want to pull them you draw them and vice versa 
---
Currently playing miracle mechathun druid in legend rn bcuz I also saw kripp's video about it. It's a hard deck to learn but once you get the hang of it you can easily get a 50%+ winrate with it. Druid's not dead, but that's really the only viable deck rn. Plus it's a good budget deck since it only runs on legendary and two epics.
---
It's a super obvious sulthraze. One is a weak four drop that draws you a random card that's probably worse than a good card in your deck; the other is maybe the single best card in the game. How do you use it? Draft early game, get the board, then kill everything the opponent puts down while getting impossibly far ahead?
---
Dunno what the deal is with y'all calling tracker weakest. Tbh it was my easiest success in the runs, just get an explosive trap and use your hero power every turn for it, combination of that and potion of vitality made it a cakewalk for me. Hardest I'd agree with Toki since it all comes down to RNG for your targets and spell creations (even if you do get 2 chances)
---
It's about sending the message *"Your Loa is weak."*
---
It doesn’t use much data. 5GB will be fine if all you are doing is playing Hearthstone.
---
Wow that paladin player must've been pissed
---
How about using a arena draft helper like the one on Overwolf or the plugin in HDT? 
---
Might help a bunch.
---
What a rollercoaster!
---
Is the order of the mass attacks randomly chosen?
---
Hero power is possibly the best with tracker but the cards tracker is able to get are honestly really bad like you have to agree all the others have better options
---
I can agree with this one
---
Oof.
---
Wow, Thijs is looking hot.
---
I totally forgot Glitter Moth was even a card. 
---
Rush the enemy! Defend Gilneas!
---
During an emp blackout. 
---
if he has a pyro and a spell he can still get rid of them . otherwise i guess the frogs survive.
---
When you say something like “edit: Removed profanity” it only makes me want to know what they were more lol.
---
An actual nerf would be to change its cost to ten and not have the discount at all. It’s pretty damn powerful, so I think making it ten would make sense. It also makes it harder to shuffle into the deck, disabling that stupid 5 mana otk the turn it’s played. 
---
So you are the guy they are catering when they said that more deck slots would confuse people. Don't know about you, but I play both wild and standard so 18 is not even close to enough. Heck I could fill those 18 with just standard meta decks only, then there's the jank that I play so I'm constantly deleting decks to have room for new ones.
---
Three lanes alone wouldn't make it difficult to follow. Three lanes *and* reacting to random creeps and arrows *and* a ton of buffs to attack and health and armor and regeneration makes it just a clusterfuck.
---
Lesson learnt - next time you post to ask for advice on what to craft, wait more than 30 mins for some decent responses before just throwing caution to the wind.
---
It's a harsh lesson, having used 1600 dust on a fairly niche Death Knight card that is statistically weak and has a 3 month expiry date. But on the positive side - you won't do that again :P
---
Just remember to wait until turn 11 so you have enough mana.
---
I agree with your stated problem of infinite value and how it is too easy to aquire. However, I don't think the warrior quest is a good example of that. I personally think it is fine and tier lists in wild and standard since ungoro seem to reflect that.
---
That being said, I like quests and feel they do need to have a big outcome so you can build the deck around it and (which is a much bigger problem) compensate the loss of T1 and a card.
---
Spellstones and recently the mage loa both do things like quests did without having this awkward t1 play. And without giving infinite value. I believe we are going to see more of this, the design space is great.
---
mechathun play dead doesn't work because the 10/10 c'thun body is still in play, also its kinda ridiculous to try to win with mechathun's effect in arena, just treat it as a textless minion. Also rumbletusk shaker isn't that bad. 4 mana 6/4 that can trade up well and its sticky.
---
I want you to kiss me slow. Rubbing your hands and your wet feet all over my metaphorical art cabinet of a body. Open me up u/undocumentedyam. Open me up for the world to see.
---
I don't think its a gross exaggeration to say Druid won't be good for a while. I agree that druid might have survived 1 nerf, but both cards being nerfed really crushed all archetypes that used ramp. Not saying they won't print other cards that ramp (e.g. jade blossom) but if expansions are already created a few rotations in advance, they wouldn't have created a card rivaling 2 mana wild growth or 5 mana nourish.  Thats coinciding with malfurion, UI, branching paths, spreading plague, spellstone all leaving standard.  
---
You could just hit the mute button.
---
&gt;A 3 Mana 1/6 would be vanilla stats (even if that stat line sucks).

---
Trading 80g quest NA Nathan#13979. You go first
---
This is actually the statistically most likely outcome: the way the math works out with "deal x damage split" effects, the highest health minions always have the best chance to survive. 
---
All minions have equal chance to be hit each time, so it is far more likely that a minion will be hit 2-3 times rather than 5 (about twice as likely, but percentages get complicated as minions die). So at the end, you get what you see in the screenshot. 
---
One of the reason i hate rng, how am I supposed to know how much burst my opponent have?
---
haa. his minions has now 1 hp and they can be killed more easily-&gt;end turn-&gt;his opponent presses end turn-&gt;op takes atleast 2 damage from fatigue.
---
Whenever I suspect a disconnect I try to interact with the board (destroy things) if you are disconnected it won't work. Turned for me out as far more reliable than waiting for the game realising it itself.
---
*Phil Swift voice* Now dassa lotta damage!
---
The thalnos + spirit lash combo would like to speak to you. 
---
So instead of DK maybe Alexstraza? 
---
Well you should have wined up with three Cenarius then by your logic. 
---
As it would have copied the deathrattle of the Pinata the cube destroyed. 
---
if you didn't then we can safely assume it was just random chance 
---
Animations can really be taxing on a shitty computer though. 
---
Like the Lich Kings PVE frost thing (turn 6-7), and Deathstalker Rexxars green zombie fog, the same with the win or lose screen where everything is blurry are animations that can make my computer hot.

Most of the things you mentioned are improvements to the dust economy and you're right, it has certainly improved. This is also something that I have praised Blizzard for in the past. I think at the moment the game has a pretty good F2P experience, which is good.
---
However, I'm mostly refering to improvements to the client and the game itself. They added dungeon modes, but these were added to replace the old adventures. So it's not strictly an upgrade. Hall of Fame could be considered an improvement, but the fact that we get some dust for cards that are sent to wild forever is really not as great as you might think. Whenever a card is sent to HoF the power level of the classic set drops. So while you get a dust injection, in the long term the card quality you have access to drops. They promised to add cards to the classic set to compensate for the lost cards. They eventually did, but all of these cards are essentially unplayable and *incredibely* unimaginative. They basically made one card and then copied it to other classes. The idea behind the HoF is good, it sends cards that are too powerful or otherwise unfun to play against to wild (a format with practically no serious balancing). The fact that we get trash in return is bad though.
---
Now think about all the improvements and bugfixes that people have been suggesting for years. Sure they upped our deckslots to a whopping 18 slots, but why stop there? Almost every notable card game gives you a (practically) unlimited number of deckslots. For players who play both standard and wild this would be a very welcome improvement. The deck/collection editor itself is also stupidly basic. Everything is done through keyword searches. There are no search filters besides expansion and mana cost. You can't add cards you don't own to decks either. This would be very useful for playing around with deck building. All of these are features you'd find in modern DCGs. But for some reason Blizzard feels that changes like this would make the game too confusing for part of the playerbase. And to list some other stuff that people have requested for a long time: auto-squelch, replays, statistics, achievements, tournament mode.
---
Speaking of tournament mode, they did actually announce this last year. This would be a very welcome addition to the client. It's something that people have been asking for for years. It's also finally something that catered to the needs of the more serious players. But then, about six months after the announced it, they announced that tournament mode was put on hold. No ETA, no hint at all as to when it might be done. Simply put on hold indefinitely. 
---
And to answer your last question, I'm not sick of the game. I don't particularly like the card design we've seen over the past year and I think their last balance patch was a joke. But the game itself remains good. I'm am, however, not gonna sit here and pretend that the game is fantastic when there's so much room for improvement. I give praise to Blizzard when it's deserved and they have deserved it on numerous occasions over the years. However I will also give criticism when it's deserved and it has been deserved plenty times.
---
There's a **TON** of board clears in general right now (mage, priest, warlock, warrior)
---
Alex isn't great in Resurrect Priest because you really never want to resurrect her or get her from Shadow Essence or Gallery. (That's why the DK isn't essential, because you usually don't have Alex so there is no backup plan without spell damage...)
---
[Here's a deck on hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/decks/WN68xWgf6c8Oio67nNkGeg/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) with Velen, Maly, Zilliax, and Gallery as the only legendaries. This style of Resurrect Priest is pretty much all-in on the combos (four minions = you always know what a fully charged Spellstone is going to do).
---
Will do. I just hope I don’t go 3-3 or something 😭
---
Memes. Krush. Everytime.
---
In 10 or matches vs Even Shaman (as Reno Priest) I only lost once, because I didn't draw any AoE and no Reno and they got all the early stuff and I got smorced
---
12 wins &gt; memes tho 
---
I'd go with lich then.

That is what i said. Golden packs have their own pity timer. 
---
12 wins can happen again. Imagine the feeling of despair by your opponents as you oondasta into krush though.... it might be worth it. Then MAYBE doing it again next turn. Two Krush makes it pretty consistent too ;)
---
As f2p, I say don't spend much on crafting stuff and try to wait frotation.
---
As you said Mecha'Thun is still good and while I heard some people had success with token druid, the stats seem to suggest otherwise.
---
Did you disenchant the stuff drom other classes? You should check what you can build without crafting. Usually Midrange Hunter and Zoolock are flexible and you can substitute some cards if you don't have them. They are also relatively cheap decks and you are likely to have most of the cards already 
---
on the other side they don't really do anything for the first 4-5 turns, so you're able to punish them pretty hard.
---
Your list is population-based because that list actually seems fine to me Big Priest vs all the decks in Tier 1 is a coin-toss of draw Barnes and win or don't draw it and lose 20% (or more in the case of Odd Rogue) chance of winning.
---
All control decks in Tier 1 are built to win vs Even Shaman, and Odd Rogue vs Even Shaman is around 50/50.
---
Whenever i decide to play this deck, im getting completely stomped by odd aggro stuff. It's one of the worst decks you could ever play against aggro. And somewhat good against control and combo (could still lose as it's draw dependent)
---
I'm hoping countries/EU will adopt some smaller laws tackling the amount of gambling enforcing stimuli allowed for these things rather than banning them outright. 
---
Yes, card packs are very close to gambling, but they'd be fine if not for the slot machine level auditory and visual gratification upon opening something special. 
---
Because it's not just 1 more mana it's 1 turn later and that's really significant. It's still being used by Even Warlocks as a 1 of.
---
No but toki can generate wild cards that maybe do generate other wild cards that end up with a frost giant in your hand. I know this is a priest vs priest but who knows, maybe one uses [[Free from amber]] into syndragosa into Toki and go from there...

I have no clue where the 80% winrate of odd warrior against renolock comes from. As someone who has played thousands of games with renolock and hit legend with it day 1 this season, odd warrior is one of my absolute best matchups. They just can't beat the infinite fatigue combo of brann banker and zola or the deck destruction of rin, and a skilled renolock pilot can easily play around azalina. My first impression was that the writers accidentally put the matchup the wrong way.
---
His opponent was definitely messing with him and had multiple opportunities to win, but decided to go for the BM instead.

Every, goddamn, body plays hunter...I am so sick of the hunter decks I play casual just for the hope I will play against something else. I sometimes feel like HS people only play the game to win 10 games having 0 fun in doing this. 
---
Weeaboo 🤮🤮
---
Nope, AFAIK, nothing to help arena drafts on mobile.
---
Quality animation and game feel is one of the reasons why Hearthstone absolutely crushed this market. Everything about how this game just feels so smooth and so satisfying.
---
You can check arena win rates by heroes. I personally think mage is good because it’s hero power immediately impacts the board. Unlike priest warrior or shaman. Even though I believe warrior has the highest win rate. 
---
Just watch arena players on YouTube. They probably will give you the best tips. 
---

#StopTheOppressionFromBarnes
---
There's a tier list right on the homepage of hsreplay.net 
---
Are you sure about that? I've certainly bought games based on watching them first on stream. 
---
The maximum damage for the full combo reaches to 90 damage..
---
Mecha’ thun and that’s about it, Dog played it a lot in high legend. it is good against control decks that have no early win conditions but auto loses to aggro, such as odd rouge, most variations of hunter, and odd paladin (unless you can play a wild pyromancer and stack armor)
---
It's not celebration so much as vindication for seeing that Artifact was being overly hyped by the community. Yes, we want competition, but that doesn't mean that we should line up behind every game that bills itself as a a competitor. We need *better* games to compete with HS, not... however you want to describe what Artifact ended up being. 
---
https://youtu.be/CeT8MPwhw8o
---
They can actually disrupt the combo with the deathlord and zola it or something like that, maybe azalina your hand with the combo. Anyways, regardless of whether it is favoured or not, it is not fun to have this kind of matchup in ladder - a 30 minutes game that gives you or takes from you a single star.
---
yea
---
this is arena, you don't get to have the most viable cards by the way the bucket system works. Worse cards exist
---
https://twitter.com/DuwinHS/status/1085061111009955842?s=19
---
7 mana for 9/9 worth of stats, 4/4 of it with taunt and possible charge/rush usage is a good deal. 3 stats total above vanilla with benefits, strong card.
---
8 mana for that though? That's only 1 mana over vanilla stat curve, and that lumps it down into being just okay. For the same mana cost you can have game winning cards that aren't shit on an empty board instead, such as The Lich King.
---
Oh, and some of the decks that used it a lot now tend to go for odd builds (Rogue and Paladin), and others like Zoolock get more mileage out of Fungalmancer. It just doesn't beat most other options in most decks, so it's mostly an uncommon one of in some even decks nowadays.
---
I don’t watch too much competitive hearthstone, but I do watch a lot of competitive league of legends, and although they are different games and should be cast differently. However, too much dead air time is considered to be bad for viewers, so maybe the casters are less used to delivering the steady stream of info that someone like kibler or firebat would. Just something to think about.
---
I played against it as Odd Warrior, had 30 health and about 35 armor and still got OTK'd
---
Same here.  I am running Dollmasta Dorian and a Juicy Psychmelon and Prince Kel in my version.  The highroll opportunity really helps win a few of their tougher matchups.  Although, like you said, it's a bit on the spendy side.
---
MTGA doesn't appeal to everyone, including dedicated players.  
---
I played Magic for ages and was one of the people in the MTGO beta (remember that). I didn't switch to HS just because the MTGO interface was bad (which it was), I switched because there are things about HS that I prefer, starting with changing the mana system so that it's not Land dependant.   
---
For me, at least, the biggest problem with Magic is that it's forever bound to doing only what you can do with actual paper, tokens and dice, and that always feels like a constraint when I'm playing something digital.  
---
I'll tell you the thing that really switched me over: the realization that even if I don't own a card, discovery and generation effects mean that there's still opportunities to play with it. I'm not locked away from having fun experiencing a cool card because it's not in my budget. That's something that MTG can't really do.
---
How did you come to that calculation (curious). Most I could come up with for 10 mana combo is break blade, backstab, double prep, double vial for 8 mana and 6 maly for max damage of 66. That also assumes that you have 2x necrium vial which most lists don’t. Let me know how you get 90 damage so I can try.
---
Minion attacks face, then it attacks the 3 drop spawned in by the wandering monster, and finally it triggers the snake trap while being returned to hand for 2 mana more.

---
Unfortunately Spiteful Druid is quite terrible. I also was hoping for Kelseth Spiteful to swing back after nerf announcement and I tried a bunch of different adaptations. Spiteful itself kinda sucks at (7) (especially without good ramp) and the drawback of not having any spells hurts. Whats the win condition? Big minions in the late game? Yeah right..

I’ve seen lots of variants of OTK quest mage at rank 5 today. I guess some streamer has been testing things
---
Yeh I like odd because yes i give up meteor and poly but you get a huge buff to your fire ball, black cat is good, and its faster. I just have a hard time switching because the big spell is stronger from what im hearing.
---
I completely agree, but that's sadly not how a lot of players see any company that attempts to cater to their customers. Advertising and public relations are a very powerful thing when done correctly.

Whenever I play hearthstone on my desktop after 2-3 matches it disables my desktops Ethernet connection so not only can I not connect back to my game nothing else works until I restart my desktop

I’d be careful, his dad works for a small Indie company.

Please report. Death threats as explicit should not be taken lightly. That person needs help.

But even after he realised he took the BM a little too far, he still did some really weird evolve choices

Yes, only (pointless) drawback is that you gotta be friends with them to report them.

It says so on the card. How obvious do you need it to be?
---
I'm not sure how this is possible since Kripp is never lucky.
---
Here you loud in clear.  We're definitely reading every comment on this thread, on the blog post, and everything in the Hearthstone forums even though we're not responding to everything.
---
I think your general assessment is right - the player has less tools relative to the bosses they're facing here than in Dungeon Run/Monster Hunt.  Because each class has their own unique set of treasures, some are left with few or no options for mass removal.  Rogue probably has the hardest time here because their class doesn't have AoE and none of their prize-fighters do either.  In retrospect, we probably should have designed one to let you play off the backfoot instead of focusing on faster, aggressive playstyles.  The idea was for Rogues to have more tools to take down shrines early so that you hopefully don't get into such a bad position in the first place.  I don't have the data with me right now, but I don't recall rogue shrines being the worse performing shrines so this approach did work somewhat okay.  However, it's like you said, shrines do tend to enforce strong positive feedback loops - because if the class you're playing doesn't have enough base tools to deal with certain situations and no special cards to fill in this holes, the player is incentivized to just focus on the shrine's strengths.  We did lean on this because we wanted shrines to play differently and sometimes it means they have to have a weakness.  I've been thinking about this a lot as well and reassessing if we had too many shrines that fall into this category and ways to possibly mitigate it.
---
I want to quickly address some of your other points, and I'll try to be a bit more succinct about it.  We did play around giving Shrine passive earlier but they tended to be too strong and made early games trivial.  We decided shift the big treasure moments to after the even fights so you have a couple of games to feel its power instead of 1.  Extra lives idea is cool and it's actually something we've been messing around since Dungeon Run prototypes.  
---
Regarding Boss balance, we targeted the bosses that were the worse offenders.  Loti with Gonk's Armament did change a bit but I'll keep monitoring to see if it's making enough of a difference.  She's much harder as a 8th boss than 6th/7th.  One thing I did when playing Rumble Run was track which boss classes I did beat.  Using that, I was able to deduce what my final bosses were going to be and changed my loot picks accordingly and hoped for the best.
---
Phew!  That was long winded but hopefully you got something out of it.  Thanks for playing the changes and talking to us about it.  We really do try to read everything we can, from all of our outlets and communities.  Hopefully, no one feels ignored because we aren't responding.  I tend to respond to posts where I can give quick answers to.  Other posts, like these, feel like it should be a back and forth conversation and that's harder to do on Reddit.  Still, I'd like to try to engage more and offer my insights as much as I can.  We learn a lot when you guys make posts like these because we get insight to how you're thinking and approaching Hearthstone so please don't stop!

&amp;#x200B;
---
Really? But the chat experience
---
I agree, it's extremely fun! Cool to see that you're playing it successfully further up the ladder like that. I gotta see if I can invest some time to climb into the single digits some time soon. 
---
Keep going. I reckon no one gets legend at their final boss the first time (too much pressure).
---
If you get to r1 5 stars you can rather obviously get to legend. then you can play dumpster decks
---
He is blaming them for the handling of the connection, not the connection itself. 
---
It would be kinda the same except that you could play it with no mana. Biology Project is not used for ramp, that is just a side effect of the card, it is used a 1 mana innervate.
---
Man, it’s got to suck hating when other people are successful.
---
Lost another one to a malygos rogue at turn 6 was really fun and interactive 
---
Well there are board clears for it so that all classes has ways to deal with it, but aggressive decks doesn't run removal. I see a very good solution here. 
---
actually! ACTUALLY this would be cool if it was deal 5 damage split randomly to minions in your hand. and you could still play those minions but theyre aleady damaged, or you could accidentally kill something! would be great synergy with Enrage decks.
---
You're not wrong - it's got the smallest % of decks:
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/#playerClass=SHAMAN&amp;gameType=ARENA&amp;sortBy=includedPopularity&amp;timeRange=LAST_14_DAYS&amp;sortDirection=ascending
---
There's cards that are selected less, if you click show sparse data, but most of those are literally banned.
---
Don't ignore 'em all! I often send out friend requests for damn good games or crazy plays that randomly worked out. I had a game this morning playing shaman going second against a hunter. Turn one I played Firefly, and then on turn two I played the 2 mana 2/2 that gives you a random elemental and I got the priest 2 mana 2/3 that makes your spells cost 1 less (sorry, I'm bad with names). So I played the priest card on turn 3, coined a totem, played the 1 mana shaman spell to summon two 1/1s with rush, and unstable evoltion'd my entire board into late game. I won by a land slide and sent the guy a friend request. We both laughed about it and had a good, quick conversation about RNG. 
---
never heard about it
---
Yeah sure, this is my deck. Insant constant against aggro decks, other than that it is very good and fun.

---
&gt;Even though the minion was returned to your hand first, the targeting still applies.
---
That sounds like a bug. Changing the target of an aborted attack shouldn't have any consequence, especially not other effects then reacting to the new target. It's the reason Freezing -&gt; Misdirection causes the latter to stay hidden. The attack is no longer valid, and secrets abort when they would have no effect.
---
I wonder what would happen if you returned a minion with Freezing Trap, summoned the 3-drop from Wandering Monster, and the summoning triggered a sequence of events that brought the original attacker back to the battlefield... Because from this it's sounding like that would let the attacker proceed to hit the 3-drop as though it had never left the battlefield at all.
---
Hmm strange, no one has ever mentioned that before. Must just be an anomaly.
---
scrolled down a lot and finally found a post i like.

sadly cancer community here voted it down, so let me help you with an upvote.

Mana cheating and card draw are super powerful abilities in most CCG's and should not be part of a core set.     
---
Fine. But how about this as a rule? No RNG stupidity. At least take community feedback to heart for once in their lives.
---
What do you mean "few playable decks", there's plenty. Renolock, Renopriest, Even Shaman, Odd Rouge, that's only Tier 1. A lot of Big Priest decks doesn't run Barnes. But for the ones that do, the high-roll possibilities are ridiculous. 
---
Agreed. Nerfing Barnes won't kill the deck, but will make it weaker against aggro and less of a highroll deck. 
---
And Barnes + Y'Shaarj in spell hunter is an imbalanced highroll mess as well when it goes off.
---
I havent been offered one legendary in 7 arena runs, youre hear asking for which thirs to get!
---
More king crush!
---
NA - Pacoon#1101 - 80g quest trade - Online now
---
So what you're saying is there's a ton of variety and barnes sees such infrequent play that it must not be overpowered or problematic?
---
Then you haven't been speaking to that many people. I personally appreciate what the change means for the game on the macro scale.
---
Druid's class identity wasn't destroyed, just that aspect of it was made slower. Ramp is an uber powerful mechanic is every card game that features and energy/mana system and only Druid is for some reason allowed to have it and it has almost always been an issue. Innervate putting out turn one Yetis and Fledglings and Wild Growth and Nourish enabling turn six Ultimate Infestations are just two examples I can think of. At least different colors get different forms of ramp in Magic the Gathering.
---
Even then, Druid has things other than Ramp going for it. Some armor gain, attacking with the hero, beefy minions, choose one, and generally being versatile are all other parts of its class identity.
---
Ultimately, making ramp slower will prove to be good for the game. Druid may suck right now, but give it a few months.
---
I hope so. Never seen a more tilting interaction in HS. I don't care about its win rate or consistency. Decks with fewer winrates got nerfed before. 
---
I care
---
Do you guys not have random phones?
---
It's nothing if there's no minion on board. So on average it's ok.
---
Agreed
---
The only reason silver sword could even impact the game is if you give up tempo. If you have board control on t7, the card is completely useless against you

Now it is a first time legend thread (:
---
Unlike warrior, mage, warlock, and rogue, priest has zero classic or basic aoe damage (holy Nova is barely anything) so every expansion seems to feel the need to add some dramatic board clear
---
But... i thought nat pagle and cho are the legends :(
---
I play a fair amount of Control Rogue from time to time, and there are a few cards you can use to help these decks perform better against aggro. First thing I'd do is switch out the Novice Engineers for 2 Doomsayers. Playing Vanish then Doomsayer is one of the best board reset tools Rogue has access to and Doomsayer can really help in the early turns too. Also, depending on the type of aggro, finding a place to slot in 1-2 Glacial Shards can also help against decks that generate high-attack minions early on, and they combo with Shadowstep and Doomsayer really well.
---
Lastly against aggro, I'd switch out Assassinate for either Walk the Plank or Vilespine Slayer. Walk the Plank is a cheaper removal tool that about 65-85% of the time is just as effective at clearing big minions as an Assassinate, and can still be used together with Preperation to get an early game swing. On the other hand, Vilespine can be Shadowstep'd to remove multiple threats while placing a decent tempo minion onto the board. The main problem with running Vilespine is that it can be hard to activate its Combo effect unless you have cheap expendable cards in hand or went second with the Coin. I'd suggest running one of each as a good balance.
---
However, against Warrior, you mostly just need insane late-game value plays rather than burn damage, since there's not really a way to burn out Odd Warrior without dealing chip damage with mid-to-big-sized minions here or there.
---
One way to improve your value in the late game (while also protecting against big enemy boards fairly late in the game) is to include Valeera the Hollow. The Valeera deathknight card is one of the main reasons to play value- or late game combo-oriented Rogue decks, since it effectively doubles up on a single card per turn, extending your gameplan tremendously. I also never get over playing Valeera on turn 9 into a Vanish&gt;Doomsayer&gt;Copied Doomsayer on turn 10. That play is just so fun to do every time. I'd suggest removing Shiv to make room for the deathknight card, as they both mainly function as a way to generate resources and Shiv is one of the weakest draw/card generation cards in the current deck.
---
Bro that shrine is awesome. Just pick a million early game and the late game you'll just get from the opponent. The adjacent minions have taunt blessing was really OP with this shrine too. Sometimes you rely on fatiguing them but that's cool. I love me some grindy value games
---
Hello, i have been doing some tracking of my card packs, let me share them with you... as far as i have read... there is a pity counter of 40 packs... but it is rare to get that far... as you can see in the image the average open is around 15 - 18 packs per expansion to get the legendary. 
---
Missed title: "I like your combo... I THINK I WILL TAKE IT"
---
As in it's not too late to get back in to? :)
---
Hey, did you hear that it was /u/CM_JesseHill's idea to raise pack prices a year ago? Man what's that guy's deal? 
---
Drawn winrate has the problem that aggro decks want to end the game as fast as possible so every card you draw correlates with a lower chance of winning, even if the cards help you close the game
---
There's no truly unbiased way too check how good a card is but if the sample size is big enough, going by deck winrate is generally the safest bet
---

Sometimes that’s how it be

Dusted her bitch ass today to craft Zentimo for m Shudder deck. No regrets.
---
Yep ruins it.
---
Every always talks about heathstone's bugs but I literally play it on a ten dollar cell phone with an expired data connection. 
---
I got a golden malygos! I'm not dusting it though
---
So did you lose to double ice block?
---
Keep the board clear or keep a removal handy
---
Today I launched Hearthstone, completed my Brawl for the pack, then loaded up a ladder game.  Opponent played Turn 2 Keleseth.  Then I conceded and closed the game.
---
Not playing against that garbage.
---
Trying this when I'm home!
---
did you reported this player?
---
Was it Steve perchance?
---
&gt;It's the same reason why even though Magic has returned to Ravnica multiple times, none of the guild mechanics from the original such as Dredge have been seen in the Return to and Guilds of Ravnica blocks.
---
 Well teeeeeeechnically both Bloodlust and Hellbent have been in more recent (albeit non-Ravnican) sets, and Convoke came back in Guilds of Ravnica.
---
Bet u muklas meta after rotation in at least 2 aggro decks
---
HERE YE HERE YE
---
Yeah it's almost like you actually have to play the game out sometimes and think critically. People want blanket solutions to complicated questions but there isn't one.
---
It's crazy how Kripp can get such a high average win rate with as many snipers he queues into. I love that Romanian bastard.
