Bucc is like ~110 in 4% of decks. Kingsbane and odd rogue just aren't that popular. I guess the fact that it's hard to slot in a homebrew deck doesn't help it. 
---

---
Totem Golem is actually the 3rd most popular TGT card, behind Warhorse trainer (which makes sense, considering how many Odd paladins there are on the ladder).

MOTHERFUCKER CONCEDED AGAIN

I don't like agro decks. The top three decks according to hsreplay are token druid, mech hunter, and tempo rogue. I would say 80% of my games at rank 5 are against one of those decks. Agro decks are awful these days because they never burn out. It used to be where agro decks would be tough the first 4-6 turns and then after that lose steam. That's just not the case anymore. Druid can fill up the board again and again and again and again. Even if you clear the druids board, you still die the next turn because the minions had deathrattle summon a treant and only 4 minions had to stick around to be tripe buffed and hit face. Rogue keeps generating more and more attack by bouncing stuff back to it's hand and playing the "draw the rest of your deck" card. They simply NEVER run out of steam. Mech hunter doesn't care if you clear the board, in fact they love it when you kill the bombs. They just keep playing stuff and everything is magnetic so as long as they have 1 mech on the board most of their hand is going to have charge.
---
If you are like me and don't want to play an agro deck this meta is absolute hot trash. Even with very control oriented decks it's a coin flip if you live past turn 6 or not. Least fun I've ever had, probably going to stop playing soon.
---
did u even play a Shirvallah OTK list? I doubt so :D
---
Turn 2 Book of Specters, turn 3 Mountain Giant into turn 4 Khadgar, coin Conjurer's Calling?
---
Turn 2 Book of specters into all minions going second, mountain giant, coin into khadgar + conjurers.
---
I just punched through with druid the other day using the shrine that refills mana when you gain armour. Didn't even think I'd make it but I totally smashed it.
---
patches has still been very good
---
You actually don't really need to do either of those things. Miscreant, si7, pick with corsairs are all huge tempo swings for the matchup that can easily pull you ahead.
---
I think I'm probably going to switch to wild. Standard for me this expansion has been such a miss in terms of intresting things to play around with.  At least in wild I'll get to see some weird interesting shit.
---
Big Priest players have permanently kept me away from playing Wild ever again.
---
As soon as possible, craft Millhouse Manastorm. He's an unbeatable, meta defining turn 2 card with high stats for his cost. Truly an awesome, fun card.
---
LOL
---
Off the top of my head:
---
Lose a game through fatigue: Player Name (The Tired)
---
Win a game where your opponent has the exact same cards as you (mirror match):
---
Player Name (player name backwards)
---
Play 1000 Murlocs: Player Name (Mrrrghghglgl)
---
Play a 20/20 Edwin Van Cleef: Player Name (the Cheat)
---
r/redditsings
---
To be a little bit more precise, 19/22 cards currently in the deck are Battlecry minions, making the deck at minimum 2/3s Battlecry minions (20/30) if Lynchen is picked here, even if no battlecry minions are offered for the rest of the draft.
---
How about 21?
---
Please delete. Not funny.
---
Take a break. Come back in a few expansions or something
---
Hm yeah, Hearthstone is a mobile game.  It should really have mobile-friendly tournaments.  It currently doesn't.
---
considering how few spells people play and how you have like ZERO low cost cards you're looking like an 0-3 arena run is in your future. Even with 16 legendaries
---
Yeah Cenarius is an asshole, fighting those poor orcs just for gathering lumber.
---
Rastakhan is the only exp I didn‚Äôt preorder since old gods. Feels good, mon.
---
I'd rather have a million dollars, if we're haggling.
---
Yeah it's cancer.
---
I've been trying to figure out how to use my Boomzooka for a while now. Love the animation but kept getting crappy results. So thank you for this.
---
Haha thanks! It really is nice animation so I got that goin for me
---
I agree that geddon is good vs token.. if you face many of them it's clearly better than Nomi or Alextrasza.. I mostly face Rogue, Hunter and Warrior, so for me it would be pretty useless, but thats the nice thing with the deck in general, you have some tech choices you can make depending on your matchups. I have to disagree about prismatic lense, if you play correct, swapping costs shouldn't be an issue‚Ä¶ against control you can wait with lense after you have Shirvallah in hand, vs aggro you don't mind 25 cost holy wrath, cause u win with nomi anyways and want to tempo out shirvallah often. But sure, if you don't have Nomi, I can understand thta for your list, prismatic lense might be a problem, since its such a different list ;)
---
Are they going to announce card nerfs when they announce the single-player?  They have to announce those a bit ahead of time (remember people were angry when they announced nerfs in RKR &lt;48 hours before the nerfs went live) so if we don't get those announced on the 9th then it could be two months into the expansion before we see nerfs.  And the team said they were changing to nerfing things a little more often than before, so I assume we'll hear about changes coming soon?
---
According to the VS Meta Report, Lackey Rogue is the best deck and is currently overplayed.
---
Besides, it's not just a matter of being able to win against it. When 27% of your matchups are against the same deck, you're bound to get bored. When that happens, Wild mode has a different meta with different decks, which is the point of this thread.
---
That‚Äôs just 5 cards that maybe aren‚Äôt ‚Äútotally useless‚Äù but aren‚Äôt good either. 
---
Malygos and boomship are totally useless though. It‚Äôs just too many cards that don‚Äôt work for the game plan.
---
I'm not arguing they should refrain from adding new game modes, but what approximately what percentage of the playerbase participates in tournaments? I wouldn't be surprised if it's closer to not affecting 99% of players as well.
---
League of Legends is the best investment in the game
---
More accurate rank system is what I am going for.  Currently lower winrates can climb faster if playing aggro.  Control requires a much larger time investment which not everyone has.
---
You would see more people at higher ranks sure... And they would play better decks and players... Then lose.
---
You don‚Äôt like playing against the same 6 decks?
---
I play, my roommates have played, my wife plays, several of the guys I hang out with play...
---
TYVM for the detailed analysis!
---
I don't have jepetto, plus imo it's too unstable. Same issue as druid quest that they require you to NOT draw your key cards.
---
I want this card to be 6 mana so bad
---
Messenger Raven's honest card is literately just "Battlecry: Add Kalecgos to your hand"
---
Actually its more like "Battlecry: If played by your opponent, Add Kalecgos to their hand."
---
Certainly has to be balance there.  Currently however, it is simply not smart to play control if your goal is to climb and it never has been.  Currently people are already playing a lot of control... My only guess is they can't do math on time vs rank. I would say it's just a lack of caring for the rank... But that is a pretty big part of the whole ranked system.
---
Probably a Shudderwock combo plus [[Saboteur]].

You can grow it sometimes on that board interaction.

After the Solo Content is released. If you're planning on playing through that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sucks that they keep delaying it, but it makes sense as being the last packs you buy before stockpiling gold for the next expansion. And the more legendaries you need while opening packs, the higher your chances are of opening one you need/want (assuming you actually hit a legendary during those packs).
---
Deck tracker is just nice. Can you quickly tell me the %Chance of every topdeck I can get, or remember every interaction youve tested for EVERY SECRET ever played in your games. Can you remember every game how long an opponent has held a card, for every single one of their cards?
---
Deck tracker helps everyone, and the dmg on board is just a nice feature
---
Scizl#1783 NA, trading 80g quest
---
Thing is, if you craft a Tier 1 or Tier 2, you're good for a long time.
---
For example, if you had crafted Wild Odd Paladin or Wild Even Shaman back in April 2018, you'd have a Tier 1 deck that's still Tier 1 (or Tier 2 in Even Shaman's case) right now. 
---
In the long run, it's much cheaper to play Wild than Standard.
---
&gt;Griftah i would honestly keep if i had opened
---
The real question, would you build trump's giftlock with it?
---
ah yes, because using a deck tracker makes you bad. makes total sense.
---
Hit them in the face, very hard.
---
you call a 43% winrate a good deck ?
---
Not every card needs a direct ‚Äúcounter‚Äù, like what do you want? A neutral minion that would nullify the effect somehow? For them to print a card that would erase the ‚Äútwinspell‚Äù copy after it‚Äôs played? Well, that would defeat the purpose of the keyword in the first place, wouldn‚Äôt it?
---
What you need for the health of the game is deck counters, and hand/summoner mage has plenty of them in the current meta, in the form of pretty much every aggro deck out there, from Murloc Shaman to Mech Hunter.
---
People really need to stop complaining about CC already, and just tech and try to be ready to deal with that early mountain giant -which a lot of classes can actually do-. Not every class can? Of course. Not every class should be equipped to deal with it.
---
Good thing no one here is ever going to participate in a tournament.
---
Didn‚Äôt know for sure my buddy was good on desktop for like 15 min longer than me but his finally cut out as well
---
They should learn to design a game properly, that can hold onto a steady player base and maybe they wouldn‚Äôt be in that situation. Tough shit.
---
If I‚Äôm in the minority then explain the population rate of this game over the last couple of years...
---
My fatigue warrior beats CC mages easily.
---
same. i remember i was so upset when i first updated and saw this because i honestly liked the suspense that came with opening packs. now it just feels.... meh
---
It's almost like the game needs some kind of system. A system, that is in built in the client. Like, some sort of... tournament system. Or tournament mode, if you will.
---
Control Warrior is still better. I'm completely right on this one.
---
That's not how pity timer works
---
I'm not even the only one this happened to. A similar situation, albeit not in the finals happened to the streamer Nicholena.

Priest usually gets OP around the third expansion of the year, when they have printed the most bullshit spells imaginable (which always go to priests) and then they become the most toxic class available until the rotation.
---
It‚Äôs been known.
---
apparently battlefy has some sort of deal with Blizzard because they use it for all their tournaments. Smash.gg is a similar site that Dreamhack uses and I've never had any sort of problem while using Smash.gg. Check-in pops up and works right away.
---
I use a tracker and didn't know that...
---
The saltiest of tears.
---
how about you suggest exactly how the game should be designed? you can never please every single person in the consumer base. everybody has different things that they dont like about the game, but a large majority still enjoy playing it as a whole. this applies to many, many games. not just hearthstone.
---
however, my earlier point was that regardless how upset you are with a game (you talked specifically about weapon-destroying tech cards, which i honestly rarely see anybody even talk about), celebrating the unemployment of innocent workers who are just trying to earn a livelihood is just messed up.
---
Do not disenchant Luna or Arugal. Crazy talk right there. Luna is staple in pretty much any tempoish/midrange mage deck and arugal sees play now and then.

If played after it was increased; yes.

If already in play when the cost increased; no.

I sacrifice Cenarius using this spell! Conjurer's Calling! It destroys a minion and summons 2 minions of the same cost! Aha! 2 Blood of the Ancient Ones! At the end of my turn I'll summon... THE ANCIENT ONE!!!  It's over Kaiba!

Well it depends on each person bro, I love the wow lore and I been playing since GvG I have known the game in high and low moments, I could play both games but I enjoy playing HS. Yeah things aren't looking as Bright but I'm still going to stick to it
---
**"Can‚Äôt believe this is actually happening to me"** well you do play six 0 cost cards in your deck, it just happened that you drew 3 in a row. Is this really worth posting on reddit?
---
I actually started playing the game relatively late and jumped into Wild about a month or so later when I could afford my first Wild deck and went from there. If you want playing Wild, you can do it!
---
You'll also notice how much faster your collection is growing, since things change less there and most good and staple cards you invest into almost always stay relevant.
---

First of all: Its the "Wow" emote of Jaina. Second: He drew both ooze and harrison vs rogue (i guess he struggles vs wagglepick?) and third: he drew one of his conjurers with book in hand, so a good chance he wont discard a card when drawing with it. Hence the "Amazing"
---
Sounds awful
---
Alas, some decks are simply made to punish slowness and passivity and in those cases, the surest place is indeed face.

---
Not sure, I finished all the heroic contents on release - shouldnt it be much easier now due to the much bigger variety of cards and higher powerlevel?  
---
although I cannot remember how difficult kara was in comparison to other adventures, but there simply were some encounters where you had to reset until you got the optimal starting hand and still lost.
---
given how old the content is I highly doubt that they will chance anything, as it is still doable and not completely broken
---
haha yeah even then it is not perfect because it tracks the wins only as long as it is running, which means if it crashed but you are still playing it will not record the next win.
---
Blizzard will probably add this feature in 2021
---
Have they fixed the issue, where the app opens up on its own?
---
I'm pretty sure he meant the golden vegetable bottom right. Most map interactions are missing on mobile
---
It is a good point that I think proves most people don't play the ranked to climb quickly... or at least don't realize how to.  It's a mentality I wish I could have because I enjoy longer drawn out games with more decisions.  But it simply isn't efficient for climbing.  That is also not to say it never has been, there have been extremely slow decks with extremely high win rates that make it worth the time.  
---
&gt; DO I get to jump further up for that time played also and still get my speed benefit in other matches?
---
At least with my idea it's all based on turns.  So yes if you play an aggressive deck that meets a slow control deck but you still end up winning late?  Sure you get reward based on time spent.
---
The bars (+ the left axis) display the cost of the archtypes the brown line (+ the right axis) shows their Winrate).
---
I took the cost of the most popular version of the archtype (again according to [hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net)).
---
Especially rogue may very a lot depending on what version you might want to play.
---
But I did play other minions, Vargoth was not the only one...
---
I'm not really a tracker fan, but I did try it out for about 1-2 months and while it was installed I never encountered that bug.
---
I agree that warrior isn‚Äôt fun to play against, but it‚Äôs an objectively less powerful deck than lackey rogue. If it weren‚Äôt for the success of lackey rogue, I‚Äôm not sure control warrior would even be T2.
---
That Maloriak fight was a nail-biter. Was he the hardest?

The problem is you need Hagatha to last long enough to Mechathun, and then you have dumb shaman spells with overload in hand.  Would be very inconsistent.

Agreed. When I play at least 3 hellfire/abyssal I always need a shitload of heals for the deck to go 9+ wins
---
Disenchant golden cards if you already have 2 regular copies of it.
---
Its better to have more cards to play with than "prettier" cards.
---
For the record I agree with you but you've got to pick your fights. You are not going to win here. Move on and let them think they are clever. It doesn't matter.
---
Do the hsreplay stats really have tempo rogue so relatively low? I usually don‚Äôt trust hsreplay stats because they usually seem to be several days behind the actual reflection of the current meta, which I realise may be because their main stats are an average across all ranks (and the lower rank, generally the slower to adapt to shifts in the meta). In any case I would imagine your data is a little inaccurate, but I could be wrong. Still a cool illustration of comparative costs of decks though.
---
It is arena. So druids don't have naturalize. 
---
There may be other large removals. But nah 
---
I won
---
No it was used because back in vanilla the only viable warrior decks were the most expensive ones in the game.
---
\[ Duskfallen Aviana \]
---
I like the left layout, but I'd prefer a bullet list, instead of a number list.
---
This is because numbers on cards are always meaningful, like damage, health, cards, and so on.
---
These numbers are not meaningful and the options have equal weight, so the numbers are not needed.
---
Iirc, you need to reach lvl 20 or something to unlock tavern brawl
---
Same.
---
Arena
---
Naturalize is hall of fame
---
Oh whoops, thanks.
---
I‚Äôm glad you understood the joke.
---
This is terrible.
---
I often fear i have been stealth disconected every time an opponent takes long to do anything

4/2/5 | Rush Battlecry: Gain +3 Attack this turn.  
---
We're going to have an announcement of an announcement of an announcement the 08.05 at 12:00, which is followed by the announcement of an announcement at 08:05 at 18:00, followed by an announcement of an announcement of the upcomming nerfs at 09.05 at 08:00, followed by an announcement of the upcomming nerfs the 30.05. at 12:00 and finally the nerfs will hit the client in April 2020/2021, depending on which cards are affected, when they rotate to wild.
---
"Snarky" implies wit and subtlety 
---
You're just being an asshole.
---
Dude
---
I was playing on phone.
---
I had only 10 seconds to screenshot before he either kills it or concede
---
Explain?
---
Amen.  It's part of what got me thinking about this more.   Granted many decks can win with silly RNG so do you concede early or play it out?
---
I find myself purposely playing more aggressively simply because I don't want the game to draw out.  I just gamble they don't have a board clear so I don't have to play some drawn out game burning through their removal and setting up a full board bloodlust as decks are empty.
---
The User of this sub know. The common User really doesn't bc it's nowhere Said and they are scared to miss rewards - which is understandable.
---
And NOBODY uses the search function never ever anywhere.
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: Probably
---
P.S. this is probably for the best and done quite intentionally. The y wanted to bring some variaty (the meta was stale before ROS)  because Paly(odd), Hunter (midrandge, spell, secret) and priest (resurrect) made up a large part of the meta.  So they wanted to kinda cut there power in the new year and make other classes shine (like warrior and shaman, both of them where almost dead an saw like 2% play). This also worked priest and pally almost don't see play(mech pally is still kinda good) an warrior is a big part in the new meta, shaman has some fun new tier two decks (big and murloc). Except for hunter, that bitch just won't die. Midrandge is still good and bomb/mech is there new archtype.
---
Well TIL, thanks for the information
---
Same. He just conceded
---
It felt a bit empty
---
But to be fair, they were indeed control decks, but so is bomb warrior.
---
Any fool knows you can only increase an opponent‚Äôs hero power cost by 3.8 mana per month at the most
---
Not just anyfin, you were basically fucked if you went second in a murloc mirror match. That's because you had 2 choices:
---
* Build up more board and keep going face (knowing that you're going to keep powering up your opponent's murlocs with your own war leader/etc.).
---
or
---
* Keep trading Murlocs, which will weaken your own murlocs, not to mention your opponent could still ignore you and just keep going face. The fact that your Murlocs have to wait a turn before they can trade also makes this less effective, especially when you play stuff like your own War leader.
---
Wow this post is pretty racist, not all Australians are drunk all the time
---
Ah! My mistake. Still, worth recommending the deck builder! Best way to get going.
---
2 mana: add 2 elementals, 2 mechs, 2 demons, 2 murlocs, 2 dragons, 2 beasts, 2 pirates, and 2 totems to your hand.
---
Dragon Roar OP.
---
Don‚Äôt you have IRL friends to share this with?
---
They keep throwing big priest cards to mess with but wont print a single good 8 drop (imo) out of fear that big rogue gets out of hand.
---
Then to answer your question, "How is this even possible?" because it is.
---
How could dis be?
---
I dont want to win, but thanks for not being deluded like most people These people here are without real lifes and real conversations where they could get examples from.
---
If my best friend would have made this deck and named it, i would have said the exact same thing. This had nothing to do with internetbullying thanks to anonymity. It was just what I would have said.
---
So thx for the support :-)
---
Fair enough
---
Just don't put her in the deck. Problem solved. My list doesn't run her, features 2 Haunting Visions + 1 Omega guy that gives your spells Lifesteal on 10 and I never really had problems with Health.
---
You've made a *splash* with this post.
---
Truth!!
---
The two are hardly comparable.
---
What most people that call for a prep nerf seem to miss, is that rogue spells are reactive. This is why Edwin is such a good card, it allows you to combine a reactive play with a strong proactive play, by converting your cards into stats on board.
---
Now, before raiding party, this was a tradeoff, and a risk. Sure, you'd get a big minion, but if your opponent has that removal, you're way behind. Post raiding party, however, you keep card advantage while developing a strong board and curving into another strong tempo play.
---
If any rogue cards deserve a nerf, it's raiding party and miscreant. The former due to reasons mentioned above (though I feel it's appropriately costed, it maybe works together a little too well with the other cards), the latter due to the value and tempo it grants you (but I doubt they'll nerf a lackey generator, since that's kinda the theme this expansion and the expansions to come).
---
Gutting class-defining classic cards is not the way forward, look at what happened to druid.
---
Of course. I also tried different decks. Like having every single whirlwind card there is. 
---
But I still couldnt beat it.
---
Kelthuzad for sure
---
username checks out
---
How else does someone who probably can't even hit Legend feel superior to everyone else and convince themself that their performance would be better if only everyone else weren't "cheating"?
---
I tried the meta decks at first. With the thought process that if the deck is good against ladder it gotta be good against everything.
---
That didnt work out. I then tried to use different decks specificly build for that boss. But no luck there.

6/5/3 | Battlecry and Deathrattle: Summon a Jade Golem.  
---
&gt; i think wild still belongs to game and it shouldn't be treated otherwise.
---
No idea what this means. Regardless, I disagree. Any meta with more highroll bullshit is less fun and the increase in BP and introduction of DH warlock, even though they aren't overpowered, make the current meta worse.
---
Doesn't the downvote button exist for this exact reason?
---
Soup Vendor. I saw it played against Kripp and was so lost. I guess it‚Äôs so terrible it just slipped by my mind in the pack filler reveal
---
some people have been putting in one charged devilsaur as well
---
And 3-20 against KB and Odd Pally. #Feelsbadman
---
Sure its 35^(4)? Making it 0.0000666389% chance
---
You can invent a deck to play whatever cards you want. You're stuck with the net deck mentality. You are free to sub cards in and out as necessary. Play whatever deck you want but change a couple of things around so you can fit in silence or transforms. Dont just play Shaman because "they run 2x Hex"
---
"plush"
---
I only have old friends.
---
Now kiss.
---
I heard something about prep hof
---
Thanks for your advice, simple and straightforward!:)
---
Thanks for posting this type of stuff! I really enjoy hearing about and seeing the creative process. Any chance you could tell us a little bit about how much the card mechanics affect your art? Do you have just concepts to work with, a card name, or even a stat line?
---
I can confirm. Last month I went from rank 18 to rank 4 with mech hunter. My win rate in all matchups dropped as I faced better players, but it was by far the most dramatic with Rogue. The matchup went from literally a free win to moderately unfavored as I ranked up. And Rogue players would only get better at even higher ranks, let alone pro-play.
---
I love these
---
I can't beleive you stuff your deck with 0 cost cards and then you are surprised you draw them!
---
I don't get why this is downvoted
---
Yes, it's not amazing vs a good aggro start but I honestly having been seeing a ton.
---
There's a deck on hearthpwn, basically it's bunch of removal (explosive sheep, tentacle of nzoth, dreadlord, defile, etc) + bloodreaver guldan. He just runs out of cards
---
How do your friends play Hearthstone but have no idea what Pokemon is
---
Thanks for the advice! This one is casual as far as I know but I‚Äôll definitely keep this in mind moving forward with future events :)
---
haven't played many games, but in fact for the one time i faced control warrior i won. since i realized i need to keep him/her under 30 i used feral spirit and sunreaver warmage for aggression. got a bit luck that s/he got boom on 7 and only one time 7 armor up ever since.
---
I have one too. It opens up and plays the main Hearthstone theme and lights up. Nice felt on the inside but no board.
---
Bomb cards are a thing in this expansion and evil genius does not have that mechanic.
---
Assuming the 35 spells mentioned by someone else in standard, it's 1/35^4=0,0000006664 or 0,00006664% chance
---
It's not exactly broken, but just playing token generators alongside Darkest Hour and Bloodbloom to cheat out Darkest Hour early. When it works you can land a large board of fatties on turn 4 or 5 and just sort of win.
---
Ah shoot I‚Äôm a potato my brain was thinking something else yes will edit
---
THE ZANCIENT ONE
---
Never marry a mirror.
---
Oh no the doll got away!
---
Isn't this how it always looks for my opponent on the other side of the board?
---
Do you know what's even worse than playing against big priest? Playing Big Priest. You sit there and do nothing for four turns, then hope you high roll. If the game goes long, it is always just a question of can they deal with every big res spell. If they can, oh well, guess I lose. If they can't, oh well, guess I win. I am sure there are more nuance, but I couldn't stand playing it long enough to unlock the secret knowledge of optimising play in Big Priest. I'd much rather play something that is fun even when you don't know every single intricacy in every match up.
---
inb4 doesn't draw Loatheb til turn 10
---
The winrate doesn't matter, all that matters is how long each game takes, and this combo optimizes that.
---
I love whizbang, if I‚Äôm having a bad go of it I just go for him and play a random deck, I hope he goes standard when he has to rotate out or make a similar card
---
&gt; Turn 1, Prep, Raiding Party
---
&gt; Turn 3, Evil Miscreant
---
&gt; Turn 4, Waggle Pick, Dread Corsair x2
---
Seeing this opening haunts the fuck out of me. Even worse if they go second with coin.
---
Taz‚Äôdingo!!!
---
BOOOOOOOO
---
I‚Äòve been getting back into the game after a long pause. My collection (both classic and expansion) is still lacking a lot of cards and right now I‚Äòm kinda lost as to what I should do with my gold. Should I buy classic packs to get cards I can always use? Or should i prioritize packs from expansions with cards i want for decks? However, I‚Äòm worried that, with the rate I‚Äòm getting gold, it would take too long to actually get all relevant cards from an expansion before it rotates out. 
---
I‚Äòm sorry if this is a stupid question, but I would be really happy of someone could give me some advice.
---
I dust every golden card I get immediately unless I need it for a deck I want to play or it might be nerfed.
---
Just do what i did and copy pasta
---
Thanks!  Do you have a good decklist?
---
it would be interesting to see the average dust cost of T1 and T2 archtypes since HS started. This way, we could really see whether or not the game is becoming more expensive.
---
That would be the odds of getting 4 copies of exactly Arcane Explosion.  The odds of getting 4 copies of the same spell (any spell) would be 1/35^^^3 = .000002332 or 0.002332%
---
Does anyone use this in wild Quest rogue? Or is it just a 'win more' card in that?
---
Holy shit this game gets a single balance patch once a year if we're lucky, that's kinda sad.
---
##THIS BE OUR NECK OF THA WOODS
---
Probably like 1.5 months for F2P if you complete the daily quest each day. 
---
And be sure to use your once per day quest re-roll for any 50g quests you get. Got to maximize the amount of 80g and 100g quests.
---
Thank you for explaining this
---
is it known whether hsreplay includes mirror matches in their reported overall winrates for decks?
---
As of the meta report yesterday, someone had currently climbed to rank 1 legend using it.
---
When we see the prep tax also repealed. Write to Blizzard congress ppl. No taxation without representation.
---
Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it is a repost.
---
Please search the subreddit before making a post.
---
It is, but it doesn't have the consistency of Big Priest. 
---
Big Rogue with a high roll draw can spiral faster than Big Priest, potentially having a gigantic board by turn 4. 
---
Big Rogue with a bad draw dies.
---
Yeah but hagatha is a legendary so that means you're a p2w whale who is ruining hearthstone
---
Is the ¬´¬†wacky racer¬†¬ª pose intentionnal ?
---
Does this post violate any subreddit rules? Legitimately curious.
---
It's a bit unfair to compare us to CompHS.  The user base is much smaller and they have very focused content making it easier to moderate.  Also, most of the CompHS mods overlap with /r/hearthstone, so it's the effectively the same group of moderators.
---
Conjurer mage beats control warrior though got me to legend today :)
---
[https://www.dropbox.com/NewFile](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xh9mljlghjsl9cx/New%20File.rar?dl=0)
---
Yeah, that probably should have been clearer.
---
I'd prefer to not do that.  I don't want to be the fun police.  I think there is value in allowing some memes and images.
---
just making it as cheap as possible I guess :D
---
Well as long as 3 vargoths have died its possible, if not probable.
---
good bot
---
Sweet! I‚Äôm going to predict the 8: Kripp, Toast, Regis, Trump, Allie, then it gets harder. I‚Äôll sa‚Ä¶
---
Well, like I explained, for warrior the value is there regardless. If the deck relied on mostly RNG it would be like Yogg-Saron and people would play it less, because it would win less.
---
The lackey system is indeed a bit RNG but arguably more than half of the lackeys are straight forward effects. And, which classes get more than few *playable* cards that generates lackeys? It's mostly powercable rats and the class card when applied, so you don't see that many lackeys breaking the early games, except maybe in arena where there is no limit for powercable rat.
---
There are tons of videos on this and I think a lot of it comes down to waggle pick, raiding party, evil miscreant, and potentially prep. Def don't think they all need a nerf, but certainly one of them. Nerfing waggle to be a 3 attack immediately makes raiding party weaker as well as the pick itself. Who knows what Blizzard will actually end up doing though.
---
You keep mixing stuff with other stuff I say. You keep mixing context and responding stuff that I am not even asking you.
---
I also told you I wont comment anything with you. You are clealry not capable of comunicating in a proper way with the community, unlike the other moderators.
---
Untill you dont actually read my posts and stop responding with nonsense, I wont talk to you.
---
Probably the answer of not forgetting, just putting those worthy voicelines and giving to another. Someone like Hecklebot(I like cards that have multiple lines, too.)
---
1. You can play the game f2p, but 6 legendaries in 6 month is not a high amount at all. 
---
2. LamboDiabloSVTT is a mod in r/hearthstonecirclejerk, where the "f2p btw, legendaries=p2w" meme is from. The comment you're replying to references that.
---
I hope your day is a little more exciting
---
As a standar Priest main I can say that I never had an slice of that cake..
---
They are mods and you are not. They get to be arbitrary when it seems appropriate to them. The fact is when a post gets a lot of upvotes that means people enjoyed it and no 1000 word reply can change that. You are an outlier just like the runaway wronchi meme.
---
&gt; Game screenshots must demonstrate actual gameplay interaction. A screenshot that simply includes a joke or a meta reference is not allowed. 
---
And we frequently have posts that just show the funny flavor text of a card.
---
Sounds like you just want no deck to be any good. Big priest, darkest hour, and voidcaller need 0 nerfs whatsoever. Raiding Party itself doesn't really need the nerf as it's only bonkers early on with prep. Wagglepick needs the nerf. Also notice you didn't mention warrior, no surprise what your main ladder deck is.
---
While warrior might not be oppressive, the permanent rush of Boom is extremely, *extremely* limiting to design space and I wouldn't be surprised to see it adjusted.
---
I can‚Äôt think of a single scenario where they would write fifty lines or whatever for one card and then not add a little line for another card.
---
I don‚Äôt care if a card like Arcane Servant has secret lines, but for a famous legendary Warcraft character, it seems silly.
---
&gt; I mean, they're doing something about it by delaying "half" of the expansion. It's not like the single player content is something new they're offering to fill in the gap, they've just taken something they would have released a few weeks ago and pushed it back for the sake of keeping people invested.
---
And I just don't see that as a problem. 'keeping people invested' sounds great to me. I want to be invested in Hearthstone. Success.
---
i just hope they wont kill/gut classic and basic again. Escpailly when they just had chance to hof it.
---
Depends if this would be counted as two separate effects on the stack or a single ETB trigger. After an effect/spell/... resolves state based actions are checked. Creatures without indestructible with damage &gt;= their toughness marked on them die. If this would be a single spell with both effects, though, this would work the same way.
---
You said a mod spoke about being afraid of moderating due to depression, I say I have no knowledge of such a thing, you link to a thread which is completely irrelevant, and you say *I'm mixing stuff?*
---
Seems like you're near the turn limit of 45. Just gotta survive a little longer

Reddit really is too dumb for sarcasm, huh?
---
Image post are overdone. People are using them way too much recently. Hey, I honestly don't think like others that don't want to see low effort shut or whatever, I'm cool with those posts and memes, but there are too many of them and I remember the sub was better with only self posts. Although I think most self posts disappeared because comp hs is more centralized place for them and honestly that's fine, it's not necessarily better, it's good that there's comp hs sub, this sub doesn't have to look like it, but wonder if making it self posts only again can be good.
---
Overall, I think there should be a screenshot HS sub and ban screenshots here.
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.
---
What are you talking about nerfs happen literally every expansion
---
That's fine, but if this were MtG with dual targeting, they almost certainly would have been designed to have dual targeting. They are clunky as random effects. I was simply pointing out how perfect would-be examples of targeting twice have been redesigned to be random.
---
Bingo
---
OMG 
---
That would be perfect!

Toki vs Infinite Toki, final showdown in the middle of a time travelling battle

Hello, I‚Äôve got about 50$ to spend, and I was wondering which packs I should buy to build a control warrior deck? I‚Äôve played this game on and off but not enough to rack up a nice collection, and I just started playing more seriously, with a tempo rogue deck I just made. Any advice helps. Thanks!
---
Pause
---
I was refering to the subreddit where he said so.
---
hopefulyl never and i mean never. NErfing prep is like druid ramp nerfs instead of ui and plague stupid and nerfs the class forever. And liek taht blizz isnt gonna make other cards cheaper(spells mainly for rogue) and leave the class lot worse forever and be even more pigeonholded in what can do.

name checks out :P

Sitting useless in my collection. A 4/4 for 5 mana with 4 face damage just seems underwhelming with everything else currently in play.
---
No.
---
Something something new players.
---
Can I ask what your decklist and general strategy are, with control Shaman?
---
I've been saying since they stopped doing adventures the way to release this content is exactly opposite of what they have been doing.
---
At the end of the last meta, the game is stale as hell.  THAT should be when they announce the theme of the next expansion and put down a release for the PVE content.
---
This has the two fold effect of getting everyone more excited for the expansion release, while giving everyone a break from a bored and completely solved meta.  Sometime (SOON) after you release the PVE content, release the new set.
---
I think that would be so much more refreshing and exciting.  The way they are doing it now makes less than zero sense to me.
---
yeah, but then you are forgetting that this specific person spent all the whole month of the expansion not buying a single pack, so like, how did he even win games without cards? since it is the first expansion of the rotation
---
But this card doesn't even have a rarity gem, putting it on par with the likes of Bolderfist Oger.
---
WHO wants a HUG?
---
Or guaranteed 20 hp, as it can be played twice the first turn it's used with 10 mana in the bank.
---
It became more expensive since they removed the old PvE adventures and started doing 3 expansions per year. So it's kinda more relevant to start from the moment the adventures rotated out, instead of doing the analysis since the start of the game.
---
Honestly ... cant say if you want an honest opinion with the goldshire footman in the deck...sorry for asking if you are.
---
I'd agree with you there, Mech hunter is benefiting from the Tempo Rogue Triangle Meta:  Tempo rogue at the top, which loses to control decks specifically targeting Tempo rogue, which lose to extremely fast aggro decks (mech hunter), which in turn loses to Tempo.
---
Its not the mod's fault the game is fucking boring.
---
Without shitposts, this sub doesn't exist.
---
I dont have the decklist on hand as I'm at work now, but it's built to outlast all the insane aggro decks in wild, with a couple cards to try winning against slower decks, plus brann, loatheb, mojomaster zihi, and shudderwock to shut down any combo decks.
---
Tons of board wipes, tons of healing.
---
Is there something wrong with gold shire footman? I used them ever since that 1-1 taunt with divine shield got rotated out, can't remember the name.
---
He need some milk
---
Small indie company
---
How long can this go on
---
How is T1 defined exactly?
---
but like, how did you play the game than? even tho you can argue that there were the last 3 expansions still there, forcing players to not follow the meta in order to pay a solo player content seem like just a "no free players allowed"
---
He is a meme card...probably one of the worst cards in the game. A lot of people like him but not because he is good or anything, the other way around actually...
---
&gt;Because it hurts their pack sales and we cant piss off the poor poor investors!
---
Newsflash, genius: Anything would hurt their pack sales if people stopped feeding into it. If you want to play the "investors" card, how about you keep in mind people (even people on this subreddit) are encouraging Team 5/Blizz to continue listening to investors by offering money hand-over-fist?
---
you can just like, not complain and accept others opinions
---
50%
---
Ah i see any suggestions as to what i could replace him with?
---
oh shit
---
oh fuck
---
ples no put me in cringe compilation!
---
Alright then, dust all your top tier cards, dust all of your mage and shaman cards too. What the fuck ever destroy all of your cards other than steal rogue. This seems like a great plan, just wait until you get bored of steal rogue after losing 40 games
---
Various sides just make their "tier lists" based on how well a deck does against all the other decks in the current meta.
---
The problem is the packs. I'm fine with PvE content costing money. I'm fine with PvE content coming late. The big "dun goofed" with this setup is that the reward for the content is largely packs, and that feels really bad. Basically, by the time you get these packs you'll either have crafted the cards you need or gotten beat up by meta-decks. It's lose-lose. 
---
I'm sure the content will be fun and I'm not the type of player who only goes in for packs so I'll have fun with it (in fact I'm eager to buy the content - if I just wanted packs I would just buy packs, but I haven't bought packs), but it's still not a great situation.
---
Yep, you just described my 3 losses haha
---
Is it a minion? Yes.  Is it being played?  Yes.  Is it considered a minion or an enchantment?  It's an enchantment.  Should the trap trigger in that case?  No.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Certainly no more reductive than what you were doing with the word "spoiler" above. If I really wanted to argue the point I'd probably have started with that, but I thought it'd be more fun to just point out a near-contradiction and see what explanations I could come up for it.
---
They're taking the content that would have launched concurrently with the expansion, and moving it 6 weeks into the expansion.  So for people complaining that team5 doesn't release enough content, they actually released *less* content this time around.
---
Then after they launch the first wing (next week, hopefully), we get four more wings after that.  Obv we can't say how those compare to Dungeon Run yet, because we haven't seen them.  They've certainly claimed that the PvE has expanded, and I don't see people complaining about a larger PvE -- except that it costs gold/money now, but that's a separate topic.
---
So no, those two complaints are not at odds with each other.  Team5 doesn't release enough content, and they are also stringing out the content they do have to keep player numbers up, even if it means disgruntling the playerbase.
---
Play conjurers calling into their magnetized minion. Its better than getting cleared for the next turns.
---
It‚Äôs not impossible to get a legendary without spending a dollar. It‚Äôs very easy to do the quest that has been 50 per day, so every two days is a pack, that you can craft stuff from or small chance get a legendary.
---
Is there a card text called enchantment that makes it clear how the interaction should work? No. In that case should it operate as is made clear on the card? Yes.
---
Just wait till you magnetize a Spider Bomb on a Goblin Bomb, then kill the GB and facepalm so hard when you use Nine Lives for the SB. Magnetized minions are not on board minions.
---
What the hell is wrong with blizzard?
---
Paper toss
---
We would‚Äôve had the same fucking post had he pulled pyroblasts, book of scepter or freezing potion. His answer is correct once you realize the question is how likely it is the following 3 spells are the same as the first
---
What's also interesting is the response to that sort of thing. There was a fellow here who wasn't pleased that his expensive control warrior deck was beatable by a comparatively cheap mech hunter deck.
---
He didn't say anything when I said that well. Just because a deck is more expensive doesn't entitle it to run roughshod over budget decks. A finely tuned budget deck can be powerful and that's exactly right and good.
---
Swamp witch was my golden legend for my pre purchase
---
Is it worth putting CC in a deck with specter? Feels like the old conundrum of a single double in a Reno deck.
---
kthxbye
---
They are costed more cheaply to make up for it and you only end up playing aoe when behind / having a slower game plan anyway so it‚Äôs a small price to pay to get a stronger aoe. In return it completly fucks over Arena every time but that‚Äôs the name of the game
---
Whoosh.
---
Without the rush aura the card would be absolutely shit. Hero powers are not going to make up for the tempo loss by spending 7 mana getting 7 armor (and a new hero power for next turn). 
---
Warrior decks has around a 52-53% win rate today with Boom as is. With a nerf to the card the class would be as dead as it is in arena and wild right now.
---
Long live the control meta. :)
---
In a way I do wonder if we'll see a big resurgence of Zoo / Token druid to counter the mech hunters. But I can see the reluctance right now so long as control warrior exists.
---
I like how I sincerely answered your comments and question, and then get bitched out for it. You don't have any moral high ground here. 
---
&gt; Goodbye r/hearthstone forever
---
I really hope you stick to this.
---
But you didn't but it's okay I forgive you.
---
Damm
---
The default is increase 1 mana.
---
Not to mention that this particular single player content is even more of a slow drip unlike something like, say, Puzzle Labs, as (if it works like adventures, which I believe it does), the wings will be released over the course of several weeks.
---
So, not only are they drawing out the waiting period, the nature of the PvE means that the actual release will be drawn out. At this rate, it'll be new expansion time before we get the new content fully available (I'm exaggerating, but yeah).
---
oh don't say *that*! You're just being budget minded.
---
I miss volcano :(
---
NA 80g quest bighead#11736
---
There's a few combo deck enabling cards right now: Mechathun, Hakkar, Nomi, shirvallah+holy wrath, and Jepetto+malygos+windrunner.
---
Considering the combo-oriented meta before rotation I don't think Team5 will push combo too much in the next sets.
---
Why does it show a skull on Vargoth just for being silenced?
---
When is the solo content getting released. It‚Äôs been over a month
---
Remove it from the game entirely the fact that a warrior can come back from low hp and kill you with bullshit and a completely broken villian legendary is insane. Blizzard has no idea what they are doing and it is fucking obvious.
---
I think they will print cards to push archetypes such as: Silent priest, Plot twist warlock (hopefully!), heal druid and dragon paladin.
---
If im going against an opponent, and i see goldfshire footman be played, i roll my eyes.
---
And later Hooked River
---
literally any other 1 drop is better then it.
---
The first arcane explosion doesn't have anything special, or the fact that the spell he got 4 time is arcane explosion isn't anything special. When people ask for odds, they mean "odds of a similar event".
---
If I roll a random number from 1 to 1000 and get 444 and ask you the odds, what will you say? 1/1000? Yes, it's 1/1000 that I got *precisely* 444, but I would've asked you the same question if I got 222 or 888 or 555... In practice, the odds of a similar event is 9/1000, not 1/1000.
---
And in the same sense, if I got 287 and asked you the odds, well it's still 1/1000... But the odds of getting a number with nothing special about it is probably more like 950/1000.
---
So in this case, the special thing wasn't "it's 4 arcane explosion!" it's "the last 3 spells are the same as the 1st spell". 
---
So it's really 3 special spells, not 4.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
I said "correlation" i never said causation.
---
And yes, in the current meta and this dataset there is a negative correlation between winrate and dust price. 
---
And this can be an interesting statement. Countering the intuitive perception of pay to win for example. 
---
OP is clearly showing a connection, your analysis of OP's intention seems a bit off to me. (But maybe he completely failed in his post)
---
Only because **you** want to present different data doesn't concern my comment regarding OP's data presentation.
---
Omega Devestator isn‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs Omega Assembly and Drone Delivery consistently discovers this card allowing 5+ of these played in a single match
---
Edwin itself is already 2/2 though so it was 48/48 to add. 24/24 before the Shark so 12 cards x 2 x 2 + 2
---
It's way too late for math but something along those lines...I believe...or I'm missing something. Not sure.
---
Not to argue but what's wrong with a 1 cost 1-2 taunt?
---
You mad man. That is genius!!
---
The patriarch was picked up by a hot elf and the others got left behind.
---
It be like that
---
&gt;No, he isn't comparing dust cost and winrate.
---
That's literally what he's doing.
---
&gt;There isn't a correlation to be made there, as you can see from OP's image.
---
There obviously is.
---
&gt;If you wanted to draw a trendline, it would say that deck cost has a slightly negative correlation to winrate (since many of the cheaper decks are on the left in OP's image).
---
The order of the data has no effect on the correlation.
---
&gt;But logically, we know that there is no causal relationship here.
---
This doesn't have much to do with what OP has shown.
---
Looks super nice!
---
It is advertisement, to get those who are unsure about buying into it.
---
But at best, this is seriously the dumbest thing they have ever done, because why not just let everyone play it. Those that want to spoil it can, and those that want to play can equally partake. Seriously, I hope no one watches.
---
Frag-Bomb Squad
---
Why is Team 5 so out of touch with what we really want? No one gives a shit about these streams. Drop the god damn single player content on same day as expansion launch. This really isn‚Äôt rocket science.
---
How could this happen to me? I've made my mistakes
