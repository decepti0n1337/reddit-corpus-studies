It was the pirate / aggro one with raiding party and that weapon that returns charters to your hand I think
---
---
---
I can appreciate that. I just never see anyone play it, was genuinely curious. Do you ever have issues running out of gas? Have you tried squeezing a Battle Rage in there?
---
Sounds like it might be a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but it's kinda a reach
---
Honestly I love the meta. Been playing my token Druid and killing some shamans. It's relatively easy since they have slow start
---
I felt like they basically did though. Without those key elements to the deck full thing was just a mess
---
Despite how oppressive evolve is, I hope they continue to do more wild rotations in the future... Just with briefer intervals. Especially when one class dominates this heavily.
---
Lost an arena game because of it ...
---
Buying gf
---
Reconnects, game freezes, stucked while loading something, app crashes, visual bugs. These are happening on android a lot lately. (Also on mine)
---
Magistrix Haelenai with conjurers sounds like a bad time.  Maybe 7 mana to avoid that?
---
Either way you don’t have 5 copies each of Mechwarper and Summoning Portal in sn1plock, or 2 copies of SN1P-SN4P for that matter, so my point still stands.
---
lol poor warlocks
---
This deck surprisingly doesn’t run out of gas often. It manages to curve out into late game a lot of the time (if it hasn’t gotten jeeves or Finley by then) 
---

---
But bc there are so many 1 drops your hand can get empty quick if you just throw them all out there, so cards like frothing berserker and Jeeves allow you to commit more. Snip snap and bloodsworn can be very flexible which in turn allows you to last longer. 
---
Battle rage isn’t necessary imo BUT it’s one of the next best tech options in there definitely. I’d also consider Captain Greenskin, and Upgrade! As other tech choices
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
Oh right. I have about 1300 wins so that’s not a lot. Maybe that’s why I am versing guys who sometimes play gimmicky decks.
---
I don't think you can expect an algorithm to understand your purpose in clicking on a button. 
---
If the tooltip isn't clear that it's a permanent change then that's more of an issue.
---
hmm I think most standard highlander hunter runs desert spear.
---
Wild Bloodstinger is a interesting idea.
---
I like all of these except Arcturis, too weak... most deathrattle decks don’t want EVERY deathrattle to change to (essentially) “summon a 3/3”.
---
Yeah I think some of us who have played for a while could go back to that type of match making.
---
Dragula#1268 NA 80g quest share.
---
I suspect the overwhelmingly vast majority of players who watch a win don't really care what deck the observed is playing, so it's probably too much of an edge case for this to be worth coding. 
---
Not too mention that, y'know, if you watch a cool deck you're more likely to go craft it which will probably take more dust that the median 40 dust pack, so if they just gave you useful cards you wouldn't have to craft them which means you wouldn't buy as many packs which would cost then money.
---
Why is everyone on this sub jerks smh
---
&gt; It’s just most of us are continuing our quiet protest and not playing the game.
---
Same here, played almost every single day since beta. Come to think of it i might be addicted to HS. So this quitting has been a blessing in disguise for me.
---
Great cards!
---
Well fuck Blizzard
---
Or try out elder scrolls legends, which is more similar to hearthstone than gwent. Although the current invade situation is pretty dumb...
---
I wasn’t guessing haha. They talked about it on in the [Hearthstone panel](https://i.imgur.com/hmenaun.jpg) at Blizzcon 2017.

fuck blizzard fking chinese rats
---
Wait, that's bad for the environment.
---
Huh.  I always imagined that the 'complaints' box was just a roll of toilet paper in Blizzard's head office bathroom.
---
Its random, 1500 ppl were getting a pack every hour. With around 30k ppl you only had around 5% chance of getting a pack.
---
Pretty cool of you to right off human rights as “drama”
---
Yea and the logic you use is fucking retarded.
---
Yes and yes.
---
It’s literally the logic you’re using ....
---
that was mike donais
---
A 6 card combo is easier to pull off than desert hares + evolve because it’s 12/30 according to your logic
---
No its not, you're arguing for drawing chance at the start of the game, which is stupid.
---
You’re literally the first person who stated that it was 4/30 for evolve . I’m just following what you’re saying
---
what do they even mean and why use them in a newbie thread
---
Sure, not that you'd want to as you'd have little space to draw anything else worthwhile. 6 card combos are inefficient.
---
You were the person who started using start of game drawing chance hahahaha hahahaha
---
It's probably a mix.  I assume most people, including myself, left. This is the first time I looked at a Hearthstone related subreddit in a week and I haven't re-installed the game launcher.
---
You also see people get over it, forget about it, or maybe Hearthstone's apology/explanation was enough?   But I  really would expect some kind of protest/drama at Blizzcon .
---
You’re a fucking idiot and this is painful to actually listen to
---
Lol says the rank 20.
---
I’m literally a legend player hahahahaha
---
Hi literally a legend player hahahahaha, I'm dad.
---
Sad panda? An odd expression.
---
No, because he played Tess and there isn't any Priest card..
---
Does this honestly surprise you? Blizzard is horrible at esports. SC2 scene is still around but gets zero publicity. HoTS had growing pro scene, they shut that shit down and every other moba is crush it. WoW tournaments happen? Holy shit when did this happen? Oh right once again were not gonna tell you about it. They are putting all there esports in the HS basket and when legends of runeterra goes live watch it crumble.
---
Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it is unrelated to Hearthstone. 
---
All submissions must, in some way, relate to the game of Hearthstone or the greater hearthstone community.
---
Posts about the community, its members, and Hearthstone drama must be either related to the game of Hearthstone or the career of a community member. The personal lives of a community member are not considered relevant to Hearthstone.
---
If you're not familiar with the subreddit rules, you can read them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Well you are quite aggressive for a joking, albeit true, comment. "They are literally nerfing the current strongest shit" pantheon is still running around 5 patches later, they "nerf" post rework garen and shaco in no meaningful way so they are both still terrorizing the game. And btw, no, I'm hardstuck silver, thank you :). I think you've spend too much time on Reddit for now and should get some sleep buddy.
---
I uninstalled and haven’t looked at a Hearthstone sub since, until today. Blizzard has lost me permanently I’m pretty sure. Player since GVG. 
---
I’ve moved to Gwent and it’s been pretty fun honestly. A lot more friendly to new players in terms of free stuff :)
---
Mech Paladin is much better in the current meta. Odd Paladin is so weak right now, it's unbelievable. I don't think I've lost to Odd Paladin this month playing Quest Jade Shaman or Odd Rogue. Even with my meme Evolve Shaman, I beat the one and only Odd Paladin I encountered.
---
Game Boy, Call to Arms, You Tube....so blizzard is making a game boy game named call to arms and the trailer is in YouTube.

---
To prove that a system doesn't work, you need to try it out for a significant amount of time. You cannot just try it for a month and say "People don't like it, revert all the changes". That's not how publishing updates work.
---
Imagine that they start making changes once every two weeks for a month, get negative feedback and revert the changes. First of all, you cannot just roll back all the enchantments and disenchantments people made according to the changes, neither can you reset collections. This is not a game in beta. Secondly, a month is already a long time and you're losing players you may not be able to reach and bring back after "reverting" the changes. Third, back to the original point, a month (aka two balance updates, one every two weeks) isn't enough time to prove anything working. The community needs to get used to the system, start creating a more active meta AND you need to collect data after everything is settled. Anything more than a month and you keep losing players who don't like the new system and still don't know if it'll work to keep the game healthy.
---
I do agree that Blizzard needs to be quicker with the changes. Maybe every month or every two months I don't know. It sucks that after an expansion meta gets boring after a month and stays the same for four to five months. 
---
However, I also think that Reddit (including you) are overreacting and asking for too much. Reddit is all like "I don't like this meta that has been here for a month change it to something I like immediately" for every single meta that existed since game launch. There was always a deck to complain about and people complained about it.
---
obviously it is the english version that they will air in Great Britain, Canada, Taustralia, and America- on YouTube
---
Of the 3 different deck types I play I still have no clue how you beat N’Zoth rogue or priest after like turn 8.  What even counters it?  Once they start doing this it’s literally over.
---
I want this unironically
---
I totally understand that mods are not paid and they may have missed some of the posts that have broken the rules because they are busy.
---
The reason I was making that comment instead of just reporting is that I saw a lot of posts like these, I wasn't sure if I had misunderstood the rules myself and I didn't want to spam reports. I think I have reported 2?
---
For example, for posts 3 and 4, should I report them for
---
&gt;Meme pictures are never allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, image macros, reaction images/gifs and comics in the style of /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.
---
or
---
&gt;Game screenshots must demonstrate a gameplay interaction or a bug/glitch. A screenshot that simply includes a joke or a meta reference is not allowed. Screenshots posted may have humorous titles, but a humorous title should not be the highlight of a post.
---
Do game screenshots incldue screenshots of the client outside of a HS match?
---
Is GIF(like the one in post 2) considered an image or a video/clip?
---
If a picture only shows the playrate of a card/deck(that is frequently complained) on hsreplay, is that considered a meme picture/repost after the same stat has been posted/mentioned in other front page posts a dozen times(assuming that is the only content of the post)?
---
&gt;This was definitely not the case here - the two threads fell off the front page because they are 1-2 days old. They were likely on the front page for the entirety of the first ~20h they were posted.
---
I dont have the stat and dont claim to completely understand [how reddit's front page algorithm work](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1j0lkx/eli5_how_does_reddits_front_page_work/). I can probably find better examples.
---
The [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/doa113/vicious_syndicates_number_of_contributed_games/) I cited has a 87% upvote rate on my screen with 64 comments, yet it couldnt break 200 upvotes. As of right now, majority of the posts on [my front page](https://imgur.com/a/xNuwzd5) have less than 20 comments. A lot of them have been posted for ~10 hours and have less than 30 upvotes. It seems to me they are only on the front page because the algorithm gives a huge weight to posting time.
---
Definitely a bug. Rhino gives himself charge
---
Unfortunately, until the next expansion drops. I really wish that they would have limited their inclusion to a three week event, but that's not what happened.

One of my favorite creatures? Yay! The carousel mechanic? Oh, hell no!

You can bolster a card that is taunted toruhg the taunt lackey. This is the only weird exception.

You can even buff mechs with woodcutter axe if you have dr boom hero card out, since it makes your mechs gain rush.

Unless you mean "completing most of your quests" when you say grinding, no you don't have to grind for gold to be successfully F2P much less "grind hard."

It's every four months.

He left several years ago. That was a misleading headline.

No. Do you believe that it's reasonable to ascribe strawmen to people that you disagree with?

I'm mean, seriously dude, you're calling me an apologist for genocide because I'm slightly sympathetic to the perspective of angels in a fantasy game with respect to the *context* of the game? The fuck, man?
---
Don't listen to that guy. He's giving you bad information.
---
As long as you manage your resources well and stick with the game, you can easily play and enjoy yourself for free. You don't need to "grind hard" to build good decks.
---
He's also wrong about how often new sets come out and about a director recently leaving.

If the rush mechanic was coded there, wouldn't the green aura around the minion be different than if it has charge, where the green aura is normal?
---
Same. I was a more casual player that started playing as soon as they introduced their game to iPhone. I can count the number of times I got legend with just one hand and only got 12 wins in arena once. But I had a lot of fun playing this game, played nearly every day, and spent a lot of money on it. The moment the news broke I deleted the app and haven’t played since. I frequented this sub a lot for the few days after but I hardly check this sub anymore and I only do it to see what’s still being said about the controversy. The game is dead to me now.
---
Keep the ridiculous hyperboles to try and make your point, it kinda fits this sub's overall mentality. 
---
I see it's impossible to explain to you what are priorities are, and yeah by the way, the priorities fr any big sucessful company are obviously making more expansions and keep the train going than bet on something that isn't guaranteed to bring any profit or to work at all.
---
hey my friend, can you please post the decklist?
---
About December when the new expansion drops
---
They’re not. Check out Iksar’s recent tweets on the topic. No plans for any upcoming changes
---
&gt; So you think it's reasonable to commit genocide because someone can become stronger than you? 
---
That sounds like an accusation to me.

Oh man that’s nutty

You found this post's hidden feature! 🏅
---
Have they managed to create smth worse than spinners &amp; crossroads?
---
Try it on ranked and see if it’s underrated
---
Quit while you're behind.
---
I've been really disappointed with Iskar on this one. The team has been getting really good about doing balance updates mid-expansion but, for whatever damned reason, he just seems determined to dig in his heels on the Shamanstone issue.
---
&gt;People have this fantasy that ladder can be balanced in such a way that in can be fun year round and never get stale.
---
It is possible to have an ever changing ladder experience if they change things up more often with buffs/nerfs and mid expansion card releases like Sn1p-Sn4p but it could really hurt the lower end players who can't afford to change decks every few weeks.
---
You fool, you absolute bufoon
---
Speak for yourself
---
Why would they release a balance patch for a meta that won't exist in a few months when the power cards go back to wild?
---
no, but you could probably find one on youtube
---
yes

The third gentleman looks like an older and bald version of Gallon lol.

W/o mark of lotus, I don't think aggro druid can have that much aggression in standard such that hand refill becomes totally unnecessary.

Helloooooo

At least magnetism isn't explicit charge, it requires you to have a minion on board already which is about the same as buffing spells.

Ye its fine. I thought about that too thanks. I made mech paladin instead

There are some reasons. I'll choose the one that I did 156 Tavern Brawl end-of-week discussion posts already after notice that the first guy u/BudoBoy07 left after missing 71st, 72nd.

what?
---
No, they don't.

Unless they changed it since I last played, I believe golden portraits are only rewarded for Ranked wins.

I should win because I like golden legendaries
---
I've been playing off and on for years now, and would really love a free golden legendary
---
I saw a Jade druid up in the 300s yesterday.
---
I should win because I'm the videogame boy.
---
Dr. Boom was released before Grim Patron. 2016 also saw the rotation of the original Dr. Boom into Wild.
---
&gt;I am currently in rank 2 and all the decks I face are Rogue deathrattle stuff mostly and then some shaman and then Paladin. 
---
If that's the case, farm them. They both are really rather weak to decks that can go wide quickly.
---
&gt;However, little mistakes you make early cannot be punished as hard as it used to minimizing the aspect of skill. 
---
When your deck is built to do little until the later turns, what mistakes would there be to make?
---
Why would returning to the snowbally Curvestone days still seen in Arena make constructed any better?
---
What exactly are you playing, and why does it seem like adjusting to the format is completely out of the question?
---
&gt;If one is overpowered that class will dominate the ladder, so it doesn't matter if only few classes are overpowered, that's mostly the class you are going to face. 
---
If you are being match-up up against mostly against one or two decks, why aren't you trying to counter them? Your whole post reads like you don't see that as an option.
---
I should win because i like children's card games.
---
Didn't play around the mega windfury. Smh my head
---
# It's always April.
---
I should win because...I made front page the day before KFT came out?
---
I should win because if I don't then this must be rigged against me. There couldn't be any other explanation.
---
there really should be a universal 'wink and a nod' between players where if someone hits the 'threaten' emote 3 times in a row it's code for, "i just want my free pack so please concede"
---
I've never experienced a blizz con before, so Id love to get one of them virtual tickets.
---
I really want to win because I love that loot!
---
Because I am the goodest boy.

Discovered [[Khadgar]] and [[Power of Creation]], played them both on turn 9 with coin, summoned 4 [[Archmage]] then played a [[Cinderstorm]] the following turn.

I'd liike to win because I've been a faithful fan for as long as I can remember. I live breath eat sleep and dream Hearthstone. I'd love to experience Blizzcon from the other side of the fence and have all access to the panels.
---
Lost to a guy that choose and cast Academic Espionage on turn 4 (basically a dead card). Then Fan of Knives into 1 mana Kalcegos next turn. Yay for mistakes being rewarded!
---
Holy shit! Using this combo before it gets patched out. Thanks.
---
I would love to have one!
---
Well it can be a 3/4 tidecaller, or another warleader. Sturdy murlocs are worth their weight in gold, was one of the best cards in the deck when I was tying a similar thing last year.
---
I will win because always lucky.
---
I love Blizzard and the lore of the Warcraft universe! Totally sucked me into both Hearthstone and World of Warcraft!
---
Is never lucky a good reason?
---
When guy she tells you not to worry about plays against you in Hearthstone
---
I should win because I will bring democracy to this forsaken land
---
I'm a poor boy pls gib f2p btw
---
Because I am not a whale or any other type of cetacean, so it would be much appreciated.
---
&gt;Yeah, I could have phrased that better. Your focus in replies was entirely on "OMG It's overpowered!" which it isn't. Especially with the "especially such stupidly powerful ones like this. "  
---
I literally quote what I said and you try strawman that into something else? Yeah ok pal. :)    
---
&gt;Seemed like the power level of the quest was the main point, and the "design space" was a "well this might be a minor issue as well" So sort of my bad there.   
---
The point was exactly what was stated.  Cherry picking a single line out of context to the whole post doesn't change this.  
---
&gt;Though you calling it OP is still hilariously wrong.  
---
Still waiting on that proof champ.    
---
&gt;As for basesless statements, what baseless statement? It's easy to make inferences. Very few decks can kill consistently-ish before turn 6. Quest completes ~ turn 6-7. Many decks win after quest comes online.  
---
I ask for some data because I'm honestly interested and you give me more presumptions?  I'll just choose to ignore such statements until you have some nice solid data.  
---
&gt;Yeah, nothing there about "OMG it's near unbeatable after coming online" whatsoever..  
---
Still reaching their buddy, all of what you quoted doesn't say what you think it says at all.  "Stupidly powerful" ~= "unbeatable when it comes online".  
---
I also love how you skip over the fact that a lot of matches that do win after quest completion occurs is because the damage was already done before it came online.  
---
&gt;If you have any data that shows that quest shaman was actually OP, please share it. I'd love to see that.  
---
Where did I say quest shaman was OP? More strawman.  What I said is the quest itself is stupidly overpowered and inferred that it really limits their design going forward because releasing what might otherwise be a well balanced card(s) and the power of the quest (i.e. the reward) amplifies this into the levels of unbalancing the card(s).
---
So you probably didnt play vs the right murloc deck.
---
I personally dont have him but he can be a lot of free damage
---
😳
---
I think I should win a Virtual Ticket because RNGesus on my side.
---
Can't necessarily argue why I should get a ticket, but I want one.
---
Only if you actually enjoy the solo content and will play it a lot.  
---
Pack wise you are better off in Arena or just buying packs.
---
Because looking forward to some news for Diablo!
---
Hall of Famed cards cannot be found in classic packs. Team 5 clearly wanted this card to pretty much see no play in standard ever.
---
&gt;  The new adventures that can be bought with gold offer a lower than average gold to card ratio than just buying packs.
---
You're saying spending gold on the adventures would give you more packs than just buying the packs?
---
[deleted]
---
I want stuff
---
I should win because I have a C'thun Shudder deck
---
Why did I have to watch a video at before this?
---
Don't spend it all at once
---
If the skill level changed that much we'd expect to see the top arena players dropping in averages.  As that doesn't happen I think the core issue is you just need to learn to adapt to how arena operates at the moment.
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. ~~Uldum of Saviors.~~ ~~Shadows of Rise.~~ Dragon of the Year. Stone of Hearth.
---
Because GOOOOLDEN LEEGENDAARYY!
---
You should get at least a card back and like 1000g
---
I don’t own a golden legendary :( started a new account recently after losing my old one and am having a blast with quest rogue, would love a golden to add the deck!
---
So we had 3 halloween themed brawls in the weeks leading up to halloween and now ok october 30th we get this.
---
They can't even communicate over standard at the moment, I can't see Wild getting any attention.
---
Because of Shaman's ridiculous early game plays now.
---
Where is this happening and how do I get a ticket
---
Ty for giveaway
---
i should win bcuz im an og in HS been playing since the realease. Dont believe me blizzard? check my og card backs
---
As a dev I really like Blizzard's developer panels. Game/Card/Level Design is my jam.
---
Thanks for giveaway
---
Hello!
---
I am very sick and would love to take my mind off of it by watching new announcements for a game I love to play.
---
You see, I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
---
I just want to see the shitstorm live if there is an open Q&amp;A. So i volunteer, i should win.
---
TheDog#21600 (EU) 80g quest. I can show you the quest and you go first.
---
Sometimes, you gotta seize a huge opportunity when you see one.
---
Would love to win, since I‘m active in all Blizzard games and can‘t wait for Blizzcon! Best of luck to all.
---
I'd like to win because I could never spend 50 bucks on my hobbies 😔
---
free stuff?
---
Nothing cool, just want to see the chaos that will be blizzcon.
---
Rostorroto sounds so strong, but very exotic at the same time.
---
you use this spell on yourself dude lol
---
While the  Blizz admin are messing up bigly, I still believe in the people making the games and I wish to still support them and their livelihood
---
Everytimeeeee
---
I'd like one because my friend got to go this year and I wanna be there in spirit!
---
It’s not worth to buy one if I can’t attend in person, that’s why I would like to win a virtual one.
---
People complaining .... RNG is so funny ! I'm pretty sure that when RNG is good for you, you're happy ... Right ???
