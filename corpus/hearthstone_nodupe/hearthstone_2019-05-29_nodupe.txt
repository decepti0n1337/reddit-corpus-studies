Thank you! I'm not yet sure which boss has what hero power, but I'm sure I'll remember this one now.
---
I am one of the players that mostly returns when a new expansion gets released it love the dungeon runs (loved the old adventures too), that said I would prefer it if I could buy the wings at a discounted price without the packs. I neither need them for the decks I play nor do I want them. 
---
While I am having fun with the game mode and do the quests to unlock it I feel like compared to games I can get for 20€ it's not worth it for me and I would be umhappy if I bought it.

I don't think it was that so much as the fact that they were neutral and so widely used. Kind of like ziliax is now, but ziliax will rotate.
---
I don't see how this had anything to do with Hearthstone.
---
Yep. Run wide with small minions? The hero power destroys you. Run tall with big minions? Mass [[Obsidian Statue]] destroys you.
---
Only boss I’ve never beaten. I assume I need disruption for resurrection to beat him, but I’ve never had Shaman with Hex or Mage with Polymorph when I run into him.
---
So RNG games that give the illusion of skill?
---
There are enough Hearthstone resources around .. Never did like sites like Hearthpwn, Icy-Veins, etc .. Just promote net decking (which now Blizzard has incorporated) .. 
---
They will probably be just remaking/ re branding the site (like everyone is nowadays movies, HS and even our "AAA" titles) ..
---
Blizz has confirmed that such special rules do exist and that the buckets are not pure RNG.  Please do share a screenshot of a C'Thun bucket without C'Thun (and no C'Thun in your deck yet).

Where will I go to trade the 80g quest now?
---
It's a double-edged sword. Their tendency to go face means there are a loooot of times they leave minions on board that very soon turn into game-losing mistakes for the AI. They also tend to panic button remove certain cards even when in context another minion is a far bigger threat. Sometimes even low cost minions that have a recurring effect will cause them to spend AoE or burn to remove it. 
---
I throw down a murloc totem to put the fear of god in them,

I feel the same way.

**HearthPwn**'s role  was obvious.

Have you ever heard of a game called diablo 3?
---
As somebody who's pretty much out of the loop, I feel frustrated that I'll never **really** know the truth about what's happening.
---
Something **dark** is happening, and everyone who's _actually involved_ is prob'ly way too _"professional"_ to admit to whatever real shit is going on.
---
It's a legendary so you can only have 1 in the deck.
---
Yeah, but I’ve never played. Why?
---
Spell hunter woth the card that gains attack for how many spells u have in ur hand also the 3 mana 1 1 if spell on hand
---
I didn't respond to your argument because it's invalid;  it's a bloody video game and no one cares lmao.
---
I could say the same that you didn't respond to me reaching legend multiple times or that you created a new reddit account to start a dick swinging competition.
---
No need to get high and mighty because you got legend on pixels...you need to go outside more ya weeb.
---
This was my first time reaching legend. For anyone who saw my post the other day, I'm the dude who spammed out ~90 wins with Token Druid to climb from 18 to 4 in one night. Once I hit rank 4 I found that Token Druid was just not favorable enough of a matchup against Warrior and other heavy control decks. I found Bomb/Mech Hunter to be SO much stronger of a deck that really rewarded my piloting ability. Token druid has very few lines. Play your tokens, pray they stick to the board for a turn, anthem them. Repeat. Wait until enough dudes stick for a lethal swing with Savage Roar. It got very boring after that one night of 100+ games. 
---
From 4-1 I played a mix of Bomb/Mech Hunter, Khadgar Mage, and like less than 10 games of Zoolock (it always beats me down with perfect curve, but I never seem to have the same luck playing out that curve when I try it). Khadgar mage is also extremely fun and crazy powerful, but I just felt like this deck was hands down the most consistent thing I've played since starting HS at launch. It has such strong lines almost every game, and there are TONS of lines that you can take that really help reward people who can think proactively.
---
You're a no name, no one knows you, brag posting on reddit isn't going to help that lmao.
---
Plus it makes your deck 29 cards basically. Deck thinning is soooo good.
---
hmm that could be interesting. If the deck was more aggressively oriented do you think it could make room for soldier of fortune and maybe even venture co mercenary? What other aggro cards would you put in the deck? Sounds like it could work
---
It was good by itself.  It got better later on, but reno warlock was a force in the meta with no other highlander cards available.
---
Yet with the same odds as getting 2 of any other 1 cost minion in the arena set.
---
Yeah test subject into buffed extra arms could be strong, but it's not that consistent. I've never heard of banana priest. What does it run?
---
I quit hearthstone sessions so many times after running into this tree bastard on boss 2 or 3. If you go for a tempo deck that doesn’t have something crazy like gaudiness from the first choice you lose a majority of the time. I’ve beaten him with burn and combo but I only remember beating him a handful of times with a tempo deck.
---
hopefully they rebrand, i feel like that website domain is pretty forgetable
---
Downvoting this because mechwarper is standard...

---
Just started playing this game for the first time yesterday. Managed to create the Budget Zoo Warlock deck because it seems like a pretty popular option for an inexpensive deck. However, I feel like I'm not playing it correctly. I usually get a good start but at the end of the game my minions can't handle the more powerful cards and I end up getting wrecked. Any tips on how to play this deck effectively? I've watched a couple vids of people playing it but so far I have had a hard time understanding how to play a complete game.
---
I beat him with priest, double battlecry, old god package, and elixir of vigor
---
Probably explains why hearthpwn was such a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

Some random guy did a BM on you? That's a little gross but okay
---
I think you're exaggerating a bit, token druid is not that complex of a deck. It teaches board control and new players will learn that going too wide sometimes can be punished by certain decks/classes. I also don't think it requires very difficult decision making.
---
easy deaths bite
---
Yeah polarizing matchups are a bit of a turn off really.   
---
HS is close to being in a good place if not for cards like conjurers calling, dr boom, some of the lackey cards ... just seems when they balance they have no fucking clue what they are doing and just destroy one class instead of actually trying to balance the game for a more fun experience.

Damn, I found Rogue to be one of the easiest. Warrior and Priest took me probably close to 100 tries each, or at least it felt like that.

That's probably my biggest reason for not using hearthpwn much - the site bugged out randomly and the massive ads on the sidebars and top were distracting af
---
Eat grapeshot mongrel!!!!
---
Sounds like someone is salty about Token Druid.  
---
It's a great deck for new players.
---
You're almost making my point for me.  With mid hunter or Zoo, you can learn decision making while learning about board control as well as being punished for going too wide.
---
You also have to keep a new player's mindset in mind.  "It wasn't how I played it, they just so happened to have those cards/I didn't get the cards I needed."
---
With zoo or mid hunter, you can look back and think about your misplays, rather than just blame it on your win condition not being 100% met.
---
this should be at the top, lets get it there :)
---
I'm of the mindset that there isn't a point in healing if you're just going to lose it again due to lack of tempo. This is a low tempo card, but seems efficient for the mana cost. 2.5/5.
---
DESTRUCTION.
---
They replaced it with Brawlesium I'm pretty sure.
---
Fake Rag; he's not speaking in ALL CAPS

---
No.. nonononono-fuck

---
1/5. I don't know if it is the same for Hearthstone, but in Shadowverse, very few 5 mana+  hard removal spells have ever seen play. You really want to not only kill something, but establish your own threat in the process. Otherwise, you don't really get anywhere.
---
Honestly, because it just isn't any good. 1 mana 1/1 stats is TERRIBLE and having the charge to push in 1 more damage is pretty much always worse then running a better statted minion like a 1 mana 1/3. The only reason you should want to play stonetusk boar is if you are going to buff it to abuse the charge ability. For example, apm priest was a deck that could essentially double the boar's attack an infinite number of times in one turn.
---
I tend to disagree. Had a few completed runs with the candle and no ways of making minions cheaper (no robe, no dice, no scepter, not even expedite), was still able to easily control the board presence while reducing face's HP.
---
Not against Timothy tho. Wouldn't like to test whether it'd work there.
---
They could make something simple and common rarity. For example 12 mana 1/1 Battlecry: Deal 2 damage. Costs (1) less for each Mana you've spent on cards.
---
Man, this seems like a really powerful effect, but I'm not sure what deck would actually want this enough. The odds of the cards contributing to your gameplan in any specific way are probably slim. There's also the chance that you spend 4 mana doing nothing and never draw any of the cards lul. 2/5.
---
Why would you want to ruin Lorewalker Cho?
---
There is [[The Soularium]], and a bunch of minions that are above-curve but discard random cards from your hand when played. It took them a long time to add targeted discard effects and even then it wasn't really worth it. IMO the quest reward and the requirements were at odds with each other - Nether Portal was great for long attrition games but getting it required drawing and discarding lots of cards, so you were usually less able to go long game than your opponent.
---
Not what it's used for, but that's a fair assessment of her power.

1/-/- | Draw 3 cards. At the end of your turn, discard them.  
---
what
---
It is weak usually, but it's actually a decent surprise for an opponent who knows its weak and isn't expecting it. Still, 1.5 is fair.
---
Sylvanas was still a 3 for 1, kind of. It was a great card.
---
Rag was pretty damn good too..
---
They were the only one I could find with a customizable filter. If anyone knows any other good ones with a filter for specific cards etc, please let me know.
---
Finkle is Einhorn

---
APXVoid is a well-known Mage specialist, but anyone with high Legend should do for now.
---
The deck also sees a lot of play in the Grandmaster's competition, but then you don't have the commentary.
---
Good old Khadgar, always comes in handy.
---
Twitch basically sold all the curse media stuff to fandom and kept the other stuff
---
Mainly because it's not from The Boomsday Project.
---
I'd say Assassinate is a 1.5/5. There are certainly better options out there that every rouge deck runs over it, but its the baseline for minion destruction in HS.
---
I recommend miracle mage to new players, jokes on you
---
ahh, yes, the iconic prep coin into that didnt quite hit the mark into mistakes were made into shame concede
---
Theo getting lucky with Boom-bots?! That's new.
---
Trading with your hero is actually preferable in every class that can, since it keeps your board alive while weakening theirs. Plus warrior has armor gain (Like healing but better as theirs no cap)

My go-to fun deck is Tess thief. You never know what's going to happen, and have to plan on the go through the game

Animaz#6743 NA. 80g quest trade. You go first, i can show mine for proof.

It would be! The sites have their cool sides though

then we'll just ask reddit

You're gonna need to be more specific than that
---
Yes. And I said that makes no sense, because both is equally difficult for the AI to do, so why randomize one and not the other?

10/4/12 Dragon | Battlecry: Restore both heroes to full Health.

Pretty much spot on.

Great in Arena, too, where you don't bring constructed decks, you draft them from random cards.
---
You can also have two of them and the statline is pretty great...
---
Because they are iconic.
---
I'm sure once they're in wild they won't he buffed so if it's bad in wild it's a safe disenchant even if you play wild

So bacially try removing 1 scorcher and Alex and try a apple baum and power of creation

---
All thats known so far, unless there are updates on the main thread
---
Hahahahah horseshit. Pw was tier 1 in ungoro and in kft.
---
Why is that hard to believe? Hearthpwn is a very tiny part of Curse, they saw the investment opportunity in Curse but thought this was a silly part so got rid of it. Happens all the time with acquisitions.
---
Some pro (Dog? Firebat?) identified the main problem with Hearthstone being it gets consumed too quickly. I think that’s right, especially with all the websites dedicated to consuming it for you. Blizzard can/should add more formats. But it makes me iffy about whether they should expose all the winrate data they have - it’d be great for figuring out the meta, but it’d ruin a lot of fun. In any case, I miss the off meta series they used to have.
---
The tooltip window that explains Rush is outside the game window.

Obviously, playing around Silence, as Silence can only remove one Poisonous
---
What a great AI
---
&gt; Anybody complaining about this card being nerfed is complaining just to complain.
---
That's what this sub is about.
---
Same thing happened to MTGSalvation. Curse had a ton of properties, and curse got bought by Fandom, who cut out a LOT of the early 2010s nostalgia sites.
---
https://hsreplay.net/ is superior in every way anyways.
---
Ik...
---
I'm just saying it was usable in a control/combo deck..
---
gotta farm that karma
---
Didn't they just cut it for Brawliseum because people complained about the barrier of entry?
---
I personally quite enjoyed the high stakes. Really hope it'll be back.
---
Still pretty cool when it happens..
---
Should probably add.
---
Had the quest reward as a treasure and also had Dalaran Robes. Turn 1 I used quest reward twice. The first got me the portals and the second got me the Rogue portal.
---
At turn 4 I used the portals twice thanks to the shadow card. So getting 4 4/4 every turn was pretty good....
---
You mean a year and 10 months?

Don't worry about it too much. Deckbuilding is very hard, especially if your collection is small. Definitely do not craft anything to just "try it out".
---
A month playing Hearthstone is a short time. This is the kind of game where you improve constantly, possibly take years (depending on how much you play) to actually become a good player and then, eventually, you might become a good deckbuilder. I've played for more than three years and I still think I suck at deckbuilding. 
---
At your point just try to find one deck that you can build (the Murloc Shaman from Old Guardian's list is great) that is at least decent and learn it inside out. Play a couple of hundred games with it. Then when your collection improves and you have a hang of the deck you can start thinking if there maybe are some cards that might fit better into it to fine tune it and improve your performance.
---
No shit, Sherlock
---
A good react or vue app isn't necessarily slow. They were just not optimized.
---
Basically it keeps buffing Recurring Villain with Arma and bananas, and by the time there's a sizable amount of them in the graveyard pool uses Undataka so it summons three of itself when it dies.
---
Still can't deal with the next turn especially after prep nerf
---
How else will I find someone to trade 60G quests with? :/
---
Yeah just another day trying to fight meta deck LeL
---
Warlock already has darkest hour.
---
They have only nerfed 1 card???
---
Just use cards that add random minions to your hand and rng will do the rest
---
Rank 20 standard players that know shit about wild format deemed this broken. Don't question it.
---
i hope they come out with some relative weak charge minions soon again. with all the new affixes it would be nice with some of the good ol charge
---
Also what is the name of the guy that owns basically every single big subreddit and can remove you from existence if you talk shit on him? He also has a few millions
---
How can you call silverback anything but a 0/5? it has NEVER seen competitive constructed play and never will. Hell, most of its direct neutral upgrades have never seen play and never will. Its also a terrible arena card. Even in the best class for it, hunter, it is rated as a terrible, almost never pick card. Even the basics only (0 dust cost deck) does not run silverback. This is a world where oasis snapjaw is a crusher and silverback still does not make the cut. It has no niche anywhere. no redeeming quality that atleast 30 cards also do better.
---
No.
---
Rip my will to still playing this game
---
Treants
---
Also it is in a higher power level format.
---
Id imagine that the source code belongs to curse and therefore fandom.
---
In practice that'd be incredibly annoying. You expect to hear a sound when you attack. It'd feel like the game is bugged.
---
"Netdecking" existed before the internet (its more accurate to say before sharing websites where popular since magic [original ccg] started during the first days of the internet). As in people collaborating on what they think the best deck is and sharing it. Instead of the net it spread by magazine or word of mouth. The main difference was a time delay between people adopting meta decks and more people not in the "In the know" crowd.
---
Basically Im just saying that meta has always followed popular opinion, its just a matter of difference in speed.
---
eh, it was tier 4 at best, and that's not because it required skill to pull it off.
---
This card has to be banned
---
Now the next question is, packs or arena runs?
---
That's what "I choose death" was always referencing.
---
That is true. By format I meant, Tournament, Ranked or Casual, sorry I stated that incorrectly. When I play MTG now it is usually in a draft, as I like to build the decks and then play them and feel i'm more likely to be on equal footing to the others around me as I don't have the time/money to commit to purchasing expensive MTG decks. I enjoy Hearthstone arena as well, when I don't have the gold sometimes I'll make a new account just to get the ticket so I can play through an Arena and see how many games I can win. Usually with the beginner gold etc I can play a few arena games before abandoning the account.
---
No fuck that website even with adblock it always ran slow as shit.
---
6 mana 5/5. It’s very conditional just like sylvanas was

To put things in perspective, the Boomsday expansion was basically themed around this card. That's how iconic it became.
---
I think you have bigger issues in that match, namely the horde of Shudderwocks
---
Wrong. No other reputable site does this and they all use AdSense as well. HearthPwn made a conscious decision to allow the sketchy ads through in order to make the most money possible at the expense of their users safety and security.
---
Yeah and in heroic his hero power gives goldens +8/+8

Did Curse get bought out by someone recently? Because it sounds like something like that.

Arena runs can give gold that ends in 5, get another one of those and they'll add up to a 10.
---
Actually before Gnomish Army knife, the witchwood monster hunt had a treasure called [[Sneack Attack]] , don’t know if the Card bot will reply it, but it’s the 3 mana teasure that summons 2 random minions from your hand and gives them Charge.

Jannimaus#2399
---
You've already started the game so just a 3/2
---
No you don't. Multiples of 5 that aren't multiples of 10 can come from arena rewards. There shouldn't be any way to get a non-multiple-of-5 like OP has.
---
Net decking by definition reduces variety.  You arent wrong about the balance patches but dont be intentionally misleading.  The purpose of netdecking is literally to play the same things as other people.  More people playing the same things=less people playing different things.  How can you possibly think otherwise?
---
Also how it works in WoW when you become invincible.  Regardless of your threat, monster will switch to next target.
---
I played this treasure once and immediately got it  spiderbombed off the board. I’m new to the game and it was my first chance to play it thinking it was going to be very overpowered. My buddy was spectating and thought it was a bug, sad days
---
I play the game in a similar fashion as you, deck building is by far my favorite part of HS.
---
I tried to use snapjaw and it feels like a win-more card with downside.  I found it is best used on the offensive to keep minions that were already on the board alive to make efficient trades.  But after he is up, there are a number of ways your opponent can abuse his effect.  If an adjacent minion has less than 3 attack, some AoE effects, poison, etc..
---

I am playing an elemental / murloc mage that's been fun and I have been refining since RoS launch.  I have a secret mage that needs work but is decently powerful.  I dabbled with freeze mage featuring spell damage and freeze synergy and Nomi and have pulled it off a few times but it's still a little inconsistent to recommend. 
---
Druid I have a deck I call Acorn Giant.  It's goal is to control the board early and increase hand size to allow for easy Mountain and Sea Giants.  It uses the sunreaver card that deals 4 if you have a spell greater than 5.
---
Shuffle Warlock Control -- lots of fun.  Dr. Morrigan buffed will be good in this deck.  Once you get okay control the goal is to Elekk into plot twist.  It even has sense demons in it.  I have drawn something like 10 Aranasi Broodmother's a few times.
---
Finally, I am playing a control shaman with mountain giant, murloc lackey, and some elemental synergy.  Instead of relying on tons of card draw, this deck has a few bounce backs and other value creating options to fill in the mid game.  With late game cards like Al'akir for burst.  Shudderwock is here just for the occasional time you need refill or if Hagatha is buried.  I like playing control and this deck makes every game feel different.  It's kind of a.. don't die then find a win con kinda deck.
---

---
I actually played against a murloc Druid the other day lol. New meta?
---
This type of deck simply is *going to be* necessarily weak against Shaman. At least, as Shaman stands now. At least, as the support for Bwonsamdi/Spirit of the Dead stands now. It’s pretty much the definition of a rank 5 floor deck.
---
And the elixir of vim, with ice block. Damn.
---
Fair enough, but to me it's just smacks of desperation to refuse to spend any sort of money on a F2P game for the sake of it for the cost of insane amount of time it's taking to achieve comparable in game goal.
---
Now all that's left is to add these permanently
---
But seriously folks, this is the best tavern brawl there's been in a while
---
We heard you like rng, so we make rng to rng your rng, dowg!
---
Yes.
---
It's call Dragon Summoner Mage. Granted, Kalecgos is considered an optional part of that deck.
---
Man, I just love seeing when someone's hidden references are uncovered and they're just so stoked about it!
---
Think in removal. Hunter doesn't have too much removal so don't waste cards with poison or rush. I picked cards with taunt and poison, it helped me. (Sorry for my poor english)
---
The first set of Hearthsone cards (Basic and Advances) just re-used old art from the WoW TCG and WoW in general. It was only in GvG they started to make unique art for the game, I think.
---
Holy fuck, stfu.  This entire post was pure stupidity.

Zayle is cooler-looking imo but only 2/5 decks are good.. Warrior and i think Shaman.
---
Nah, its only broken because Dr. Boom can discover it so often, because its a class card. Remove the mech tag and its gets a lot better. But I still think that Delivery Drone or Dr. Boom himself need changes.

Randomly “helps” you. Draws you cards, gives an extra turn, changes a minion into a tandom legendary, refills your deck, summons taunt minions, clears the board, restores health, copies a spell, casts ice block. 
---
Sometimes the help actually hurts - changing a combo minion or drastically increasing the cost of a card, clearing board when you are dominating, copying a secret (no effect)
---
You generally want to have your first spell be ine that benefits copying.

I'm yet to see one of these decks Rogue was supposedly keeping out of the meta.

No
---
Their secrets have a "divine intervention" theme of getting shielded, rezzed, buffed, etc. The favor of their gods may seem like deception to enemies.
---
Yes, this is what they should spend resources on
---
Yep, doesn’t help when you mulligan three 5 drops into a fresh set of 5 drops.
---
Because when the swords have been defeated you can pick them up and use them, thereby gaining resources.
---
 But paladin secrets are not about deception (at least not like hunter &amp; rogue ones are), they are about heroically fighting, like [[noble sacrifice]]. Even mage ones are not strictly deceptive, they feel more like reaction spells.

1/-/- | Secret: When an enemy attacks, summon a 2/1 Defender as the new target.  
---
&gt;Understanding tempo, value, and board control are.  
---
This is inherently false.  It's true for Arena and it USED to be true for HS but HS has deteriorated into a shitfest of who draws their "I win" plays first, flood the board or control that doesn't really need to hold board control anymore.  
---
Obviously aggro is aggro so no example needed there.  Priest - clear things as it comes up if you can but don't worry because you can just play stall cards as soon as you can then resurrect them - didn't get resurrect cards? Well you've most likely lost.  
---
Mage? Play giant, turn it into insane board position far too early. Didn't get conjurers calling early? Yeah you've probably lost.  
---
Control Warrior ... well fuck you don't need to do much at all, just play the most obvious board control card and you'll win eventually unless you didn't get the clearance card you needed when you needed it and oh well you lose too.  
---
Curve, tempo and value play for the most part is now a minor consideration for most classes.  Team 5 have been dumbing the game down for a long time now and I can see why since you want to appeal to a casual audience which will make you far more money than a few highly competitive whales.  
---
Sure there are still decks that require more skill than others to pilot and those 3 facets are still important but for the most part it's not the case anymore.  
---
Now don't get me wrong, I wish the game were more about smart decisions and tempo and board control (true board control as in trading minions to get an advantage, not that bullshit that control warrior does) as that would be fun but it's really not anymore and you're fooling yourself if you think it is.  
---
As to Druid you should learn to play it as there is more to it to pilot it successfully, no more complex than most of the play themselves decks out there right now though.  
---
To reverse your own example ... "oh they did have clearance? Now I'm fucked." Choice then is was it such a smart idea to play that card on turn 4 as opposed to 6 when I could have buffed them, if I didn't play them then what other options are there?  
---
I can't really take you seriously when you seem to think Druid is so linear and thus it's bad for beginners and yet you highlight zoolock as being somehow different?  It's not.
---
No, but there's also never been a card like Whizbang before Whizbang.
---
Whizbang:
---
- 18 different decks
---
- Decks change whenever a expansion is released
---
- Some decks can actually be decent and fun
---
Cape
---
- 5 Decks
---
- Very likely that they will only change decks on next year (to adapt to the new standard cards)
---
- Decks are pretty shitty
---
This. Dr. Boom is the problem here.
---
Definitely not closing portals.
---
&gt; a late game to end things off 
---
You cant "end things off" with your late game when 50+% of your minions are literally useless because they have 0 attack. Hunter quest, lackeys, flood shaman are all MORE than capable of winning heroic runs handily unless you run into this door stop of a "boss".
---
Just play war and brawl turn 5... duhhh
---
Ewww legend, come talk to me when you hit rank 25 scrub
---
Haven't you ever gotten a card after beating down a pair of flying swords?
---
Well I farmed him to gold at rank 20
---
You seem to imply here that the whole concept of druid is wispering woods ... so draw and play this on turn 4 and don't get cleared or you lose. Hmmm 2 cards out of 30 in a deck that has a ~54% win rate ...
---
The win rate alone tells you there is FAR more to druid than just that card and trading minions is a massive part of the game against decks like Zoo or Hunter.  If I have board control from 2-3 minions and I can buff them out of reach then it sets me up well moving forward.
---
Again I just don't think you know how to play Druid or perhaps the game in general anymore?
---
If you look at the text on Zayle at the moment, it doesn't state how many decks there are which means that there is a fair chance more decks will get added this year as the league of EVIL expands in the next 2 expansions
---
Umm brawl turn 5 so they have another 8/8 on field?
---
Typical rank 15 response.
---
I think my highest hero has less than 200 WINS, I'm never getting to gold lol. Filthy casual do what filthy casuals do
---
If you get double battlecry and some Cthun minions it's solid choice to build around that. Hell, even the healing some of the Cthun cards offers becomes acceptable and the Emperors become triplets.
---
Paladin, like Priest, has such bad card quality that the best archetypes for those classes involve blowing up their own deck rather than actually playing Hearthstone because *they can't play Hearthstone*.
---
Is 1 mana draw 2 cards a hamfisted way of trying to make Paladin good? Maybe. Is it a mistake to buff a card that is already seeing play in the archetype that is meta viable for Paladin? Probably. But Paladin definitely needs some love. Paladin's class defining trait used to be "plays good cards" - now his cards are so bad that he doesn't try to play Hearthstone.
---
Which is a lie, it doesn't buff Cthun if it's just in your collection. : (
---
Agree - I had win with warrior or rogue, won with warrior and got no progress.
---
Weird that the guy below "win with any class" registered, but named class types don't!
---
Oh yeah good idea I’ll try that and see how I do, thanks!
---
Oh, I just read GMT and saw the american AM/PM suffixes but missed the +0200 part, so you are correct. (In hindsight, a combination of GMT and AM/PM should have made me take a closer look…)
---
Wouldn't be surprised if the internal code for that is actually just "Win 2 games"
---
I played a Quest Hunter Deck with the 1-Mana-Minion Hero Power and Doctor Boom's Remote...  
---
At least it was quick.
---
Honestly when people talk about hero cards in standard they only mention hagatha and boom. It amazes me how people skip over zuljin
---
Daniel my brother, you are older than me.
---
Because "discretion is the better part of valor."
---
But then it could actually function as a pretty decent weapon removal and the effect wouldn't even be negative
---
I see. Am new and just figure if they are playing mage it’s prob the one iteration haha
---
correct
---
For Mage:
---
Mana Cyclone - Limit the number of spells you can get or completely change what it does
---
Conjurers Calling - Remove the Twinspell and when you use CC on a Mountain Giant that cost 3 or 4 mana you get a 3 or 4 mana minion and not a new 8/8 or 7/8 with Taunt
---
Sorcerers Apprentice - HoF or rewrite to "the NEXT spell you cast costs -1"
---
Hunter:
---
No idea. Since that thing has 3 viable decks right now that all work differently I think the best would be to just remove that shitty class. But the 2 damage hero power plays a lot into it I guess. But that will never be changed so yeah...guess we just have to endure Hunter forever.
---
Shaman:
---
Underbelly Angler to 3 mana 2/2. 
---
Druid:
---
Remove Twinspell from Forest Aid
---
But I think in general that Twinspells are big part of why certain decks are so strong. Cause the removal that's required to deal with them isn't Twinspell. So they got twice as much OOMPF as you got tools to deal with it.
---
How would you nerf zuljin? 
---
Maybe "Cast 10 spells" to stop the endless bullshit.
---
Also FUCK angler. The effect itself isnt OP, its the mana cost. Its too powerful to be able to play it at turn 2. 3 mana 3/3 or 3/4 would be fair and would still see play. Just give me time to draw removal, jesus christ.
---
How did you not know lol. Are you new or just not used to blizzard treating you like sheep? On the upside your just the kibd of player the shareholders expect =)
---
Solo Adventures don't register those though.
---
Try fighting him with a Quest Hunter or on Chapter 3 with Doctor Boom's Remote.
---
I usually watch HS videos at 1.5x speed, and this voice line is my favorite in the game at that speed, but normally it is pretty meh.
---
Easy. Two swords. Kill both, then turn back into two swords. Now you have two more sword. Ergo, 2 more cards.
---
Well, "Win 2 games in Play Mode" or whatever, like most quests.
---
HOFing apprentice is interesting, but I'm worried it would remove a big part of mage's toolkit.
---
The giant mana cost thing would instakill conjurer mage and people would have to redesign the whole archetype....good.
---
Mana cyclone, I think either nerf cyclone or conj, not both.
---
I once failed making scrambled eggs. It’s ok there are many Nomis out there
---
I saw your post, completely agreed, and this explanation makes so much sense it hurts. I would never have considered that, and I’ve been playing Diablo since D1!
---
This post should be silenced. 1000s of post before this have already had this new and interesting original idea and it never gets old!
---
I had a game as a Hunter where five Dynomatics and four Omega Devastators were played.
---
I’m sure misteaks have been made
---
Plus, two of those are class exclusive, and I think one has the possibility of KING Krush (Scary!) 
---
So, yeah. I'd be fine with that limitation. fun shenanigans.
---
There are no words to describe how much i hate conjuer's calling...
---
I replay brawls that help me complete my daily quests.  What usually happens in brawls is someone exploits the best version of the deck and then you just run into that one for a while.  I always play as early as possible before the brawl “meta” settles.  I actually really like this brawl but I can’t do dailies with it so I’ll just play ladder and arena where I feel like I can “get something” from my play besides 1/3 of 10 gold.
---
I guess saying “one and done” is very unpopular on this sub. Oops!
---
These are all “real cards,” whatever that means. To the extent you mean cards that see play, deckhand and argent commander have repeatedly seen play, including within the past year, and I’m sure will see play again at some point.
---
Yeah I got screwed over by this.
---
Keep doing what you are doing. Eventually he is going to have to learn that what he did is wrong
---
Tremendous if accurate
---
I won my void game at 1 hp remaining with a 37 attack void. It was actually really interesting, I had to keep trading because my opponent would build pretty good threats and I’d be dead before I could smorc him to death
---
Its funny, Darius and Shaw I beat in one try each, but Toki and Tess gave me such headaches because of how RNG based their abilities are. The cannon(s!) is really powerful. If you get treasure that adds a cannon, or increases the damage, absolutely go for it, and do your best to pay attention to placement. You can do it.
---
"Just do stuff and win"
---
Have fun playing mountain giant on curve against a hunter with deadly shot.  I think you're salty because you never learned fundamentals, and you're angry that people keep beating you because they drew their go cards and you didn't.
---
Paladin hasn't really had a great class identity from the start.
---
Yeah but with unleash the hounds and unleash the beast it could be usable but yeah much less consistent without shimmerfly or lynx.
---
