There are no "meta" decks 2 hours after launch. It takes time to refine a theorycraft into something that actually works. People will be copying what the streamers are doing 2 hours into the expansion, sure, but the meta won't settle for a couple of days afterwards. There's just no point in brewing a deck if the meta has already been solved by the time you get to open your first pack.

No it doesnt activate at all, it shows the hero power icon at the bottom as if it was never activated and then they dont gain the death rattle
---
Other than Vulgar Homonculus and the guy who gets stats for summoning demons, what else deals damage to you? 
---
I've won with demons twice when I play them and at most I get a golden homunculus. I've never used the neutral minion. I've just won with the absurdly high stats demons can obtain and the guy who deals dmg when your demons die.
---
I have allmost same first places and same 4 or better places compared to kripp but he have 6800 with that, and i only lost points in like 8 games, dont think thats fair

You've lost more in between. The system is not biased towards anyone.

Taunting the junk bot seems like a misplay, although I guess it plays around zappy boi. Then again from the looks of it you might not even need the junk bot. Overall good board, I approve.

---
I have never played a single Battlegrounds match but I can't help laughing when I see A. F. Key is a top tier in something
---
Yeah. Blizzard doesn't care about the mid-expansion lulls so much, they've started to have events like Rise of Mech and Doom in the Tomb, both of which provided player with quite a bit of value, shook up Standard, and came with like five or so packs worth of stuff over the course of a couple days.
---
&gt; has not once has
---
Does it turn into a golden random???
---
Kurgan#1785 NA, Trading 80G quest. Please show or go first. Fine with Wild or Standard.
---
What sort of decks are they used in then? The same as when they were in Standard?
---
It could even have its own sub, for example Teamfight Tactics, while being on the same client as LoL, quickly had its own subreddit.
---
Bye
---
You are not alone. I've played 4 times. It's taking all of the attention away from how terrible the current metas in standard and wild are at the moment.  I preorder every expansion, seriously considering not doing this one and just getting maybe 50 packs with gold.
---
Why does the client matter? Doesn't the server decide the result of combat?
---
I don’t think Battlegrounds is replacing Hearthstone’s main game modes; rather, I think it’s just being hyped up as the first new major game mode in a long, long time. It’s also super easy (for anyone who preordered smh) to play right now, because there’s no entry fee like arena has. 
---
It’s understandable that you might think it’ll replace normal Hearthstone, but it’s unrealistic to think the hype will last long. It’s been like 2 weeks since the game mode was revealed at Blizzcon, so of course it hasn’t died down yet. Rest assured, Battlegrounds is unlikely to even come close to replacing the traditional CCG format of normal play.
---
Clearly it's a Jigglypuff viewed from above.
---
That was firebat, I believe
---
Would love to see a proper ranked ladder for BG, with rewards
---
Spoken like someone who doesn't know what programming is.
---
&gt; If everyone is playing refined stuff day 1
---
no one is playing refined stuff day 1 cause no one has gotten any refinement from the pre release streams.
---
It only has such a wide presence in this sub because there’s nothing to talk about in regards to the main game mode at the moment. It’s a stalled meta ruined by Shaman, and Blizzard has no intent to fix it until the new expansion. 
---
Once the expansion comes out, there will be something to talk about again. Just wait until then.
---
Or brann/khadgar shenanigans
---
&gt; A: We are going to improve /turn off poison
---
Oh i misinterpreted that then!
---
Nope, Robosaur is also a mech
---
Upgrades + brann
---
It's not like it really matters, I'd rather they fix months of stale meta rather than give us 1 week of unsolved meta then the rest stale.
---
Are the odds for a specific unit per unit or per roll? Meaning if it says 5% is it 5% per roll to get that unit? Or if you get 5 units, its abut 25 to get it?
---
That's a really poor way to define combo as an archetype. 
---
It's super broad and can include anything from all druid decks playing ramp, any deck using a Hero card or a minion with a battle-cry that requires any amount of set-up, and any deck that does anything that cannot be instantly countered.
---
It can also exclude spell based combos specifically because Counterspell exists.
---
Wow. So how does this match up against death rattles tokens?
---
There’s also the 2/5 that gives a mech +2/+2.
---
Do you think starting HP is way  too low? RNG can decide if you start at 15 or 35...
---
Put your faith in the Lite!
---
This. The problem isn't just magnetic and echo put together, it's both plus cost reduction to zero.
---
OP was talking about animations as limiting mechanics, but the more obvious limiting mechanics are (1) the amount of gems one has available to spend in a given turn and (2) the amount of cards available to them in a given turn. The SNIP-SN4P + Mechwarper combo totally destroys both of these limitations at once.

Just getting in to the game. I have 2 accounts available and want to know which would be more beneficial if I was trying to remain completely F2P. Are 25 ranks of rewards better or worse than the strictly F2P rewards from the extra missions/adventures.

The triple counts as the 3 that you combined together taken away from the pool
---
I don't have a source but I remember reading that it does not, kind of. How it works is there are 6 mama bears in the store. If all six have been bought then then the store count is 0. A person then discovers a mama bear and the store count is now at -1 since 6 mama bears are in play. If a person with 1 mama dies then there still be 0 mamas in store as a result. Hope I explained that well.
---
don't give streamers early acesss unless i get it too.
---
i demand equal treatment blizzard.

Thank you for the answer!

You think that's what you want.  But you don't.

Don't forget Space Marine Murky.

I can't see, my.post was suddenly deleted lol
---
As everyone is playing BG, it was maybe not noticed but since the last change by Blizzard, we see a lot more 60g quests than 50g... At least, for my two accounts, I maybe saw 2 50g quests for 6 60g... I don't think it's luck. I think this is a good improvement.  AND the way we have to play them... We don't have to win anymore. Well done Blizz.
---
Mech is strictly better than all other strategies.   
---
Well. "strategies" is a loose term here. Your starting hero is random and he will decide if you start the game in the 10-20 range or the 30-40 range.  
---
Then every fight is a coin flip in some ways. So whether or not you picked mechs, the early turns decide your board anyway and the top 4 will be decided 100% randomly before a single one of your decision starts to matter.
---
Discord
---
I've tried pogos a variety of times as Shudder even and I die bottom 4 cuz you gotta get real lucky real early.
---
Yeah... Imagine pre-ordering for a p2w advantage in a beta test...

---
I notice some off things as well, but I would not categorize them as bugs right away. Sometimes it goes way too fast to get the gripe in what is happening. Worth keeping an eye out to tho.  
---
For example, i have had that my rat pack died, and the rats that it summoned did not have all the same stats, some of them were 8/5 (mama bear + that +3 wolf) of of them were just lower attacks. It might be because somewhere along the line one of the buffers died midway ... but that would be weird right. Worth keeping en eye out on
---
Your lucky you didnt face Nefarian.
---
When you sell a golden, it puts 3 back in, not 1.
---
I apologize, I was referring to just battlegrounds. Should have been more clear
---
He can still buy a unit or upgrade. I think in this case buying is better und upgrading next turn.
---
Yeh, i have no clue why he attacked me like that. I have not bought anything and I am at 3/30. Did not open them since I can't.
---
Yeh, i'm sure. It's just a slight difference between buying and opening. It seems not opening does count for now.
---
Ah yeh, there are some things that can spice it up. Not sure if Blizzard would want that because on mobile it's kind off a clusterfuck already and we know how much they like dem mobile games :P.  
---
I am eagerly waiting what they have in store for us. Since it's free, I do not really care. If I dont like it, i will play something else. I do this with every game.
---
Knowing the Activision half, ”你来亲我的屁股” would be more fitting
---
Cough* deathwing: mad aspect
---
This is most likely not the case as even theory crafts after streamers test every card in their mini metas end up being wildly different from the refined decks that we have months later. (Remember people thinking murloc pally was Uber tier 1) Add in the fact that not only are theory crafted lists always much worse than lists that are actually able to be tested in real time, AND theory crafted lists pre expac are extremely likely to include synergies and archetypes purely because said synergies exist and blizzard is trying to support them (deathrattle Anka rogue) (big spell token Druid) ( Quest Warlock) and the archetypes purely for shock/ “fun” value (Mogu Cultist decks), and eventually you’ll see that streamers aren’t the bastion of knowledge you’re making them out to be
---
Priest and warlock were the faces of the first expansion this year (priest got the portrait and warlock was the leader of the league) and both classes were garbage tier during that time (warlock still is) it doesn’t affect the quality of the cards, the new expansion comes on December 10th and the cards will start being revealed on the 21st of this month (this Thursday) and around 30 or soo have already been revealed, give them a look and then you can make a choice to spend or not next season, as for the actual one I would recommend not to, since most meta decks won’t be as relevant as they are now next month.
---
Yes please
---
I’ll get that added tomorrow.
---
it doesnt matter, you never reroll a 60g quest, because it always gives you a 50g quest.  so the odds are irrelevant.
---
He still have 3 gold, how do u know he didnt buy anything?
---
/r/chonkers
---
*Don't you have gaming PCs?* ~Blizzard
---
No need to remove it, just needs to be higher tier.
---
It's better to wait for the next expansion first before crafting any decks, cos we want to save as much dust up as possible to craft new decks that the upcoming expansion will likely bring along. In the meantime, you can try playing battlegrounds and the solo adventures; they should be sufficient for your Hearthstone needs for the time being!

---
There's so many situations when it's better to not upgrade, that's how the game works. You just have to decide when it's worth it or not.
---
Favorite part is "play" instead of win for those class quests
---
Desert hare is an interesting choice. It would essentially be a 'free' cycle card to sell off in later rounds. It would be an amazing early game grab.
---
Either the chosen cards are to weak or would break the game. I think only 2-4 could really make it into the Game
---
Why is the first thing you want to do is break the game? That makes it not fun and half of these card will be rank 5/6 because of power level. What the game need is so good early game. RN it's the fastest to R2/3 beast, R3/4 mech, or R5 managery is the consistent winner.
---
Even then its way to strong.
---
A 6/12 Unit with your lifesteak could take down a 7/30 and would still be a 6/8.
---
The game is already quite poisonous depended amd this would  make it even worse.
---
Also never ending battles could become a thing if 2 units with lifesteal would be the last 2 units.

I really like tentacle as a potential late pick when it’s down to 2-3 people to hard counter a bunch of divine shields, similar to how people late pick Zapp as a tech to rip down Mama Bear/Junk Bots. That seems like a worthy layer of strategy.

---
Honestly, I'd be more worried about spider bomb here. You'd pretty much have to buy every single last one that is offered no matter the deck you're running, then stack them all onto a single easily killed mob that you put all the way to the left. 
---
Instantly wipe much if not all of your opponent's board. Leaving them only with death rattles.
---
I suppose that's reasonable. I've gotten very lucky on occasion with Pack Leader or Zerus a couple times from T3. I feel like pushing for T4 /T5 with this particular triple puts you too far behind.
---
Can say with 99.7% confidence that the warrior doesn't have a coin
---
Yup, that is the reason why it's most likely overbearing. This will make Demons even more unkillable, and even more vulnerable to poison.
---
I'm unclear on what your point is.  Yes, you can use a strong deck to leave the plague lord on low health to set up an easy win with a weaker hero/treasure/HP/deck combination - but that's obvious.
---
If I ever get a class that I have to win on and don't have a deck. I legit just smack all the murlocs I can into a deck and smork

At the time they announced Diablo Mobile, "LineageII Revolutions" was super popular and cool to play... but (from what I remember) RNG powerups, whales, and chargeback-scams made it lose its luster for many after about a month or so. If Diablo Mobile can get the balance right, then it could actually be wildly popular. 🤷‍♀️

For some reason blizzard has balked at the idea of simple cosmetic sales, or heroes in the shop vs heroes as part of a bundle. Really don't understand why, I mean they could even do both. The possibilities for cosmetic options are endless, too, and there are lots of folks who will buy them up and no one will ever take exception to them.
---
Except no that’s not how people with not a lot of money play. They get their cards and test out making decks with the cards they received. However because of the event the day 1 decks are at a much higher power level than they normally would be and this causes them to lose much more often. As a result those players need to choose day 1 what deck they are going to use because the deck cost has greatly increased. They don’t get to test and play silly deck, they have make a competitively viable deck day 1 and if they choose the wrong deck to back they could be screwed for a larger portion of the expansion. As a result of this risk many just choose not to play because they want to see what’s the better deck and they don’t even want to try their home brew decks because they’ll just keep losing.
---
Oh right, when I refer to the store I mean the store on the Blizzard Website http://store.blizzard.com/ 
---
(you can actually get better deals depending on where you're from by changing the Domain, but still Claim the packs in your Region)
---
In the In-App store you can only get the Standard packs and adventures
---
Battlegrounds and Arena (a draft mode, also not really adviced for new Players) through the Modes tap in the main menu
---
Yeah I meant the quest with evolve package. Which website do I use to netdeck...? I've been relying on metastats, but they have not been updating their databases frequently.
---
&gt;DestroyPussy

I actually forgot to write that. The events can be pretty helpful in deciding what to craft. But in the end if you want to be sure you are better off waiting the ~2 weeks needed for the meta to settle.

---
The reason has little to do with the quantity of the tribe and has to do with the quality of the minions. (Not including amalgams) The best mechs are in tier 3 and 4. Multiple tier 3/4 are likely to survive during a victory meaning the opponent will take on average 10-15 damage. This high damage significantly shortens the number of matches and thus makes late game focused tribes more difficult to succeed. Most of the other tribes require higher tier minions to be effective. Beast needs mama bear, murlocs need megasaur, demons need mal'ganis or battlemaster. It’s basically aggro vs control where aggro kills them before they can reach a high enough power level.
---
Well I worked as a game developer for 4 years and as a developer for more than 6 more. So this insult is sort of funny to me.
---
The  thing is that the phenomenon you speak of still happens!  Literally Uldum heralded in with a totally different meta with plenty of varied, fun decks to play.  Despite having early streamer access the meta turned out to be completely different and was by no means solved due to it.  Mountain, meet mole hill.
---
Read a meta report like Vicious Syndicate, it will give you better advice than this sub. 
---
Alternatively just play aggro shaman. It’s cheap to craft, requires very little decision making and is extremely powerful. Fast games are a bonus. If you’re playing correctly you should see a winrate well above 50% and can hit legend easily. I had a 70% winrate and it took me about 50 games from rank 5.
---
MY DREAAAAMS ARE YOUURR NIGHTMARES!
---
The joke is only decent and funny to everyone who lives to circlejerk about HS being bad. It's such an overused joke I cringe every time I see it.
---
&gt; Your client is independently calculating what attacks what, and there is a client bug that means what it shows happening to you is not what is actually happening on the server.
---
That, again, is not how the game works.  Your client does no calculating what-so-ever. Hearthstone as a whole doesn't work that way. 
---
You can see this by watching the data packets that are sent to the server and received from the server. In them they contain all the data for whatever changes in the state of the game. You can also observe in Battlegrounds a big selection of packets received from the server just before the turn starts. This is all the data the client uses to display who attacked who, who won, and what damage was dealt. 
---
This is also why when you use a deck tracker, it knows what card you draw at the start of your turn before any animations start.
---
The game client is a glorified input machine that shows you animations. ALL of the calculating, RNG, and AI is done server side. All of it. The client simply shows you the results of your inputs. This is contrast to most other games like FPS where some stuff is done client side to help minimize lag. However since lag isn't a factor hardly in Hearthstone, the developers decided to move it all to the server.

Blizzard: surprised pikachu face
---
With the exception of Sniplock, most decks have clear weaknesses and it's not difficult targeting them.   
---
Big Priest is a lot slower than it used to be and is like tier 4 or something right now. Secret Mage is the most popular deck but you can tech for them or do relatively well - with much more ease than standard shamans at least. Then there's Mech Paladin, Odd Paladin, Odd Rogue and evolve shaman, which seems a late novelty.
---
I like the faceless rager idea a lot!
---
"thanks" -blizzard
---
&gt; You start out with enough cards to build a deck so something is off if you don't have 30 cards for anything. Mix neutrals and class specific ones
---
I'm talking about the recipe ones. For example when I make a deck and select mage, the Classic Mage option I only have 22/30 cards. So I would have to make a custom deck.
---
boos#21933 NA Looking to trade 80g quests, I'll show, you go first

What do you mean this is subjective information? Just look at the win rates of each specific card and you’ll see that junkbot carries

its concerning to people because it will dictate the future direction of the game.
---
You know who are your next opponent by checking which portrait is not aligned.

And it changed one of my choice one time. I was hesitating between two units, but knowing i would take 2 less damage with one of the possibility changed the value of it.

Glad Manastorm bit the dust.

I think card with something like "Deathrattle - Heal adjacent minions by 4" could be an interesting way to introduce healing to BG, but under no circumstances should you be able to heal your hero.
---
What changes?
---
“Handily” is a strong word. It’s more like Quest Hunter *mostly* beats Shaman &gt;50% of the time provided you’re a competent player.
---
&gt;Oh boy, I got jeraxxus!
---
Nobody should be this happy about picking Jaraxxus.
---
Just choose classic and autofill
---
Basilisk, void terror, ooze and floop would be overpowered, at least if inserted into the metagame now. Void terror and ooze especially.
---
that means patch notes any second? :gasp:
---
&gt; I might just stick to playing quest evolve shaman. Which got me to rank 5 in the first place.
---
It’s literally the best deck in Standard, so why wasn’t this already your solution before making this post lol?
---
Someone post the content here on reddit for those of us behind firewall filters at work! I must know what the changes are!
---
Am I the only one that is reminded of Line Wars from WC3 and SC way back before auto chess was a thing? It's almost the exact same concept.
---
YOU DON'T TAKE IT EARLY ANYMORE, THAT'S THE ONLY CHANGE
---
It's still the *best* scaleable minion in Battlegrounds whether the body is 3/4 or even a fucking 0/1.
---
The recruitment map costs 3 gold, it's not busted as people think it is.
---
Thanks!
---
There is a date in the title. I wonder what that date signifies...
---
My thoughts are if there are a lot of people out there like myself, who this mode has made them realize they really weren't enjoying the CCG anymore, they'll need do something.  
---
3 heroes wasn't enough of a carrot for me to buy packs (I top 4 90% of my matches with 2 heroes) and I certainly have no interesting in going back to meta play even in a new expansion (but I'll do arena to spend my gold as arena is pretty fun).  
---
I may be the exception to the rule of course but if not then they'll need find a way to get money out of people who might have spent before but now don't need to and won't.  
---
They need do this without locking the mode out (make it a pay mode) as that will just cause bad blood and hurt their product overall (I'd probably uninstall the game instantly and not look back)  .  
---
They also can't really look to do anything that is too heavily P2W - the 3 heroes was a nice balance I thought, not really that much of an advantage.  
---
Cosmetic type things imo would be the best starting point.  Dressing up your hero,  emotes,  other sort of things to make you stand out above the crowd that works well in other games.
---
It’s how to face some weird shaman deck that can kill you turn 4
---
Except you don't have to spend 1 to cycle? It's basically always better than cycling, which may not even get you any higher tier minions.
---
Monetization other than the bonuses?
---
It's the tier you upgraded to, so you're guaranteed a choice between (e.g.) 3 four-star minions, instead of some random assortment of 1-4 star minions.
---

---
also lich and mukla weren't exactly designed very well. Millificent was boring as hell. I did like Giantfin though.
---
When you spend the 1 to reroll minions, chances are high that you are not going to see ONLY minions from your current tavern tier. The discover guarantees that you see minions from your current tavern tier, giving you a significantly higher chance of seeing a specific minion that you want. For instance at tier 5 your odds of finding Lightfang are pretty low but with the discover the odds are quite high
---
Repost?

---
There is already a post on the main page for this so did we really need you to just literally plagiarize the Blizzard post to get people to visit your site for advertising revenue?  
---
Honestly this sort of thing annoys me and would put me off wanting to view your site at all in the future.  
---
At the VERY least if you want to put up a link to your page at least have your page be an article written in your own words or something.
---
Because in Standard, you lose turn 3 or 4 to Shaman, which is close to 40% of the ladder at certain ranks. In Wild, you lose turn 3 or 4 to Snip-Snap Warlock, a deck only countered by the mirror.
---
You don't have to take my opinion for it, go to any streamer/pro's Twitter. Or any Hearthstone forum, this one included. Or any VS report since the patch.
---
The changes that broke the meta are easy to reverse. The lack of their reversal leaves the meta being purposely broken as the only option. I don't like developers who purposely break their own games for I dunno, clout and meme points?
---
I do think Curator as-is is still probably a *bit* too good.  I think he would be perfectly balanced if the minion he came with was a 0/1.  That way it would not be as useful as an attacker or defender in the earliest rounds.
---
Reading all of your replies has given me eye cancer. I hope you're trolling because damn, you don't read the other person at all
---
NOT TAKING IT EARLY ANYMORE IS A BIG CHANGE
---
The fact that you don't acknowledge that and keep screaming your terrible points is embarrassing
---
Spending 3 Mana to roll is a lot. Your still not guaranteed anything you want.
---
I agree repost should be deleted, have done it.
---
I read everything he had to say and I maintain that changing the body does nothing except change when you buy it. It's still the best scaling minion in BGs and is still extremely overpowered for that fact.
---
Also got to pick Sir Finley on my next game, but game lagged and autoselected another hero.
---
Both of those seem like they could be decent-enough, but **Elise** seems like she could be really good. Getting to discover a guaranteed higher-tier minion can be great, especially in later stages in the game when the tavern is often full of tier 1/2/3 minions. It reminds me of a more flexible Infinite Toki hero power, since 1) it doesn't actually cost you anything, and 2) you get to **Discover** the minion you want.
---
The main problem with Toki's hero power (in my opinion) is that it can be very highrolly; if you happen to find a Lightfang Enforcer on the turn you upgrade to tavern tier 4—awesome, you're probably going to snowball to a win. You're very often just gonna roll into something like a Primalfin though, meaning you just wasted 1g on a reroll. 
---
Being able to discover a minion, even if it's just your *current* tier rather than a tier higher, seems very powerful. When I upgrade to tavern tier 5/6 I often waste a few rerolls trying to find a specific tier 5/6 minion, so this will end up saving me a lot of gold.
---
I've often been wrong when it comes to evaluating hero powers in this format though, so I'm curious to see how it plays off.
---
What now? Now you gonna play Battlegrounds :)
---
Can't believe there are people who don't just play meme decks when battling with friends
---
My phone is too slow to run battlegrounds. It lags up in the later rounds and I don't have any time to select choices before the timer closes.
---
I'm just salty because I spent 12 gold on the scrolls and got nothing I needed any of the times lol. I think she's one of the weaker heroes.
---
Well i mean to be fair if plague of flames destroyed your whole board he actually had as much minions as you did
---
No, it hasn't. No, it's not. Yes, they are.
---
That's not a big change. It really isn't.
---
The kind of incorrect predications we see now is things like armegadillo isn’t strong enough to see play in control warrior. I’m talking meta defining mistakes. Also I’m not sure if you’re making shit up to support your point or you just got bad info but both quest decks never went below tier 3 ever. The problem with being able to accurately predict the meta is it increases the power level of day 1 decks making testing and exploration much less fun for people and it makes the meta become stale much earlier than is should. Not sure what rank 5 you’re playing but that’s not the experience I get. Many become even more competitive because it’s the easiest time to reach legend.
---
So murlocs would be the natural counter to demons, but because of amalgam any build has access to them which directly counter demons... are you saying amalgams are BAD? HNNN?
---
Same, mine lags so bad I can't hardly touch on anything. Then timer closes and it's on to next match. This is mostly issue in the later rounds.
---
It's an unplayable mode for me.
---
&gt;​NOTE: The "Recruitment Map" recruits a minion from your current tavern tier **after** upgrading Bob's Tavern.
---
Soooo it’s a race to lightfang?
---
Watcher has synergies with Wrath Weaver and Vulgar Homonculus but yeah I do agree that that doesn't seem enough to make this a powerful card. Even more Floating Watcher has anti-synergy with one of the most powerful demons, Mal'ganis so I don't think this card will have any impact other than making the card pool one unit larger for whatever tier it is.
---
You can secure a good early game as you can pick a minion turn one freeze, upgrade + freeze next turn, and then you Sell the first minion you bought and buy 2 with +2/+2 on them.
---
After that is like a 1gold +1+1 with a delay i guess 
---
It needs to be tested to see the potential tho
---
Oger was great.
---
The reason why it would be a bit ridiculous is simply because as a neutral 4/4 it would immediately be the biggest minion in the Tier.   And getting it that early in the game would allow you to potentially have a gigantic board before you Tier up to 3 simply by buying a homunculus or two.
---
Been doing the same sometimes and it's a nice  feeling!
---
I don't like being the only one, makes me feel like a creeper. I like joining when there are 3-4 people in there so I don't feel compelled to interact with them.
---
Well mech beats everything almost all of the time, so that's the problem. I've seen demons get hilarious stat lines on streams, with a 250 HP 20 attack minion cleaning up the rest of the board by itself. It does seem demons should counter mechs by design, at least.
---
Well but getting to Megasaur without dying first is not easy and usually depends on a lucky upgrade into discover so i think its fine that is a high risk/high reward situation
---
Like how in LoL, new players get asked whether they’re there for 5v5 normal League, or Teamfight Tactics. If they choose Teamfight Tactics, they get popped into a TFT lobby and have most other game modes locked behind a level requirement.
---
I don't think this is correct unless you read something I missed. The whole incentive of buying 20 packs to get access to 3 is their way of keeping you from playing battlegrounds for free and ignoring the main game mode.
---
Like watching incest!
---
When I pull it up in My Collection, it notes it as “Wild Event” and “Uncraftable” followed by “available for the duration of a special event”
---
I assumed they meant the opportunity to GET IT was only for a special event. (Which one I have no clue, because I definitely wasn’t around 2-3 years ago.) 
---
So do I have one of the non-legit cards? If so why does it give me the option to put it in my deck if it’s now literally never playable under any circumstances?
---
Was there an edit to MMR? I have been gaining +29 or +30 exactly for 1st place finishes but just now I suddenly got +102
---
Solid article on the whole. Though I take issue with this part:
---
&gt;**The bad side of RNG**: it plays an even bigger factor compared to the other games since you’re not only dealing with the shop RNG. The attack target RNG can definitely decide rounds, which makes the game less skill-based compared to most other auto battlers.
---
Attack target RNG exists and affects the outcome of fights in other auto-battlers as well. That's a big part of what makes them **auto**-battlers. The worst you could reasonably say is that the battle RNG in Battlegrounds is more swingy than that of, say, TFT. But I think it will be pretty difficult to prove that definitively, and I'd say it's pretty close either way.
---
It just cost 150€ to play. That’s the downside.
---
one is from the event and will be gone soon. You can still only use 1. I don’t see a problem here.
---
true but they need to do money
---
I had some fun playing her, then realized she's really bad. Her whole strategy is rushing to low life and getting ahead on composition. But screw up or get unlucky one time and you have a super low finish. I bet the majority of my 7th or 8th place finishes are with Lich.
---
So mmr wise she's just a bad idea lol
---
A standalone app would greatly reduce file size for mobile users, though
---
1st place is still only 27 for me
---
Yeah, I get the having to type something feeling, but I feel like it's a fun interaction with the streamer even if I'm the only one talking to them.
---
when I played a couple of hours ago there hadn't been any changes to the card nerfs. I'm guessing the update hasn't hit just yet.
---
Yeah, turn 2 leveled up, turn 3 hero powered and grabbed the zerus that came up, turn 4 he turned into the bear and then I sold my t1 buy and bought these guys.
---
I do not. I tried it with both Renounce Darkness and Kun, neither of which I own
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wild-vs-data-reaper-report-20/
---
One tier 2 Reno deck, I'm guessing you thought Reno Priest was tier 2, when in fact it's tier 4.
---
Hopefully, but knowin Blizzard, they msot likely aren't.
---
Umm ... You mean that data based report that is very good for standard but doesn't have enough data for wild? Or do you mean you use hsreplay winrate?
---
I’ve never spent more than $50 on any expansion. And $0 the last 3 expansions. I don’t have every card but I have enough cards that anytime I put in a deck code I might be missing 1-3 cards I can craft. Granted, I’ve been playing since release so I don’t have “catch up costs” of a new player, but most of the time people exaggerate the costs of this game. I’ve also taken long breaks from the game.
---
He's not trying to join the design team, he's just throwing some ideas out there. Doesn't need to be that fleshed out. It's fine as it is. You want tiers, make it yourself, instead of bitching that someone else should have done it for you.
---
Wouldn't it be a -$1798.51 return? That $1,800 is gone.
---
It just give it taunt :0
---
Well i tried removing them all and adding them manualy, nothing changed
---
I hope it would this way :
---
Someday the battle of bans brawliseum return.
---
Then everyone will get a preloaded run with their current score.
---
I didn't want to say he's probably full of shit, I just want people to think critically. But, he's lying or an idiot.
---
Seeing three choices at the start of a round of Battlegrounds is at best a nebulous advantage that ultimately won't win a game on it's own.
---
Lol are you even listening to yourself. You would rather take the words of some Wild "experts" than actual statistics? Even if VS uses a relatively small sample size in Wild, it's much more accurate than the tiny sample size of the Rankstar team.
---
Random question, but I was kind of curious about the history of the auto-battler format since I never played the DOTA one. It kind of reminds me of an old WC3 map Legion TD, which involved shop rounds and battle rounds. You were split into teams, random shop offerings, placing units that would auto-fight a round of enemies and then every now and then the other team, so kind of an auto-battler Tower Defense hybrid. 
---
I was wondering if that might have been an auto-battler ancestor or if they all came from another inspiration point. Mainly because the WC3 custom maps (and to some degree Starcraft map editor) were kind of the primordial soup that created the TD and hero team battler formats (as well as a sort of lab to for a Warcraft RPG), so it just would kind of amaze me if maps the player community made for a 25 year old game was also at the rpot of yet another popular game format
---
I I wouldn't say it has the slickest UI. The huge buttons look kind of ridiculous IMO. It does have a very simple UI because it isn't cluttered with items, passives, or information about your opponent. They also save a lot of space by having a one dimentional battlefield.
---
I mean he literally just took some cards from the game and that's it.
---
There's no ideas. Just cards slammed into one picture
---
Oh cool. Thanks for the info.
---
The 1 gamemode I'm referring to, is BG. This sentense is more of ironic, because it has the most attention, while standard is suffocating from evolve, wild from snip and tavern brawl too. The quoted post of CM was pinned for a few days, but got removed and no communication came after. So I decided to post to potentially accelerate the decision process, because less than a day left until new brawl week.
---
I consistently reroll and get 0-2 cards of the new tier. Her power saves me a coin on the reroll but also a guaranteed choice of 3 from the new level. Not awesome, but doesn't suck.
---
Reno = dragon confirmed
