Wall Priest definitely is an OTK deck. How else do they win? Zerg you down with 1-3 attack minions?

Fuck wall priest

I remember seeing a video of someone getting double legendary in a single pack, followed by another pack with legendary, into a third pack with golden legendary. I couldn't link it, because this was back during GvG or later (at least 2 years ago). I'm sure if you look on Youtube you can find some pretty broken RNG of pack openings that dwarf this.
---
It was drawn after prep was played.

Paladin start. Togwaggle deck.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I threw this deck together a few days ago so not exactly refined but definitely performs well against aggro. If you face slower decks I would recommend (-2 doomsayers -2 raven familiar -1 gluttonous ooze) and (+2 arcane tyrant +2 voodoo doll +1 keleseth). Probably should have voodoo doll in both decks but I just like to fuck around with the random legendaries
---
People had the same concerns for Artifact's drafts and they were really a non-issue. Free drafts is probably the most celebrated mode even. Most people want to play the deck they drafted even if it's bad, but for those that don't there is a cooldown period before you can draft again (about as long as it would take to naturally lose the run). People will still due paid entry because it is inherently more competitive.
---
Artifact may be dead, but free drafts were one of the best things about it. 
---
Nothing is more frustrating that watch your opponent past turn me until drop a spell in turn 9 and blow your head. What is the interactivity on that?  Cards game are a fight since turn 1 to control the board and use that to nuke your opponents. 
---
Now, every time a priest is my opponent I know that is an Instalose. Nothing to do, just waiting time and watch the emote train. 
---
What about different deck archetypes fighting each other and don’t just otk?
---
Same length as bobby koticks horns
---
Buy packs collect 1600 dust cast whizbang have fun 
---
&gt;  these are all sheer aggro decks.
---
Why do people clarify their statements by lumping all remotely aggressive decks into a single category of mindless decks. There's a reason these decks aren't all called "Aggro [Class]."
---
&gt;You generate / vomit tokens, trade if you have to but often times you are just hitting face.
---
You can generalize literally every archetype to sound this simplistic.
---
&gt;If OP truly wants to be competitive, he's not going to have a great time using sub-optimal versions of decks.
---
We're talking just starting out as a new player. Someone like that doesn't need an expensive deck to win games or have fun. By the time he's ready to compete in higher ranks or to get to Legend, then he can start crafting more competitive decks.
---
1) i dont think that would be enough of a precaution.
---
2) I meant outrage about jaina's revealing clothes. before blizzard would change that, because of "pc-culture" there would have had to be a bigger outrage. 
---
Honestly this is almost the best time to get in. Rotation happens in late march/early april and the fewest cards will be in the format. Meaning you'll have less to collect to be competitive than if you had started later in the year. When I started a few years ago I was able to have a lot of fun my first few months playing f2p and having fun is what made me okay with buying more packs.

The game is slowly dying, i remember two years ago hearthstone would always be the 3rd or 4th highest watched game with the total view count never less than 40k. Kripp would constantly get 20k viewers. Now the total viewers is never higher than 40k and is usually around 20k only when a top streamer is streaming. Kripp's viewers have dropped to around only 10k. Also a lot of   
---
top HS streamers have also switched to another game. 
---
Bomb rogue with spirit of the shark, augmented elekk, seaforium bomber and valeera dk. Shoving 40 damage worth of bombs in someone's deck is just fun. That's without added bombs from zola, shadowstep and the dk. It's backed up with a mech package to use missile launcher with zilliax and rusty recycler for AoE lifesteal.
---
It's still better than literally every other card game on Twitch.
---
Even then, card games aren't exactly the most thrilling view experience, the LoL season just began, the meta game has been mostly figured out, and Twitch viewership is hardly a reliable metric of measuring a game's health.
---
A better one would be measuring the number of played games over time, something I have not done, but at least according to HSReplay, about a million games are still being played every day.
---
This is what I'm talking about. Like yeah, viewership always rebounds when a new expansion hits, but even then it's my hypothesis that viewership is steadily decreasing across the board.
---
I don't have the numbers, but as someone who's been playing and watching hearthstone for years, it genuinely feels like the playerbase and viewership is fading.

&gt; Well, for starters stop making intentionally shitty Legendary with no sign of being played anywhere like fucking Moorabi. Yeah, after one year and half I'm still mad about that.
---
But [Ben Brode told me that it's good to have bad cards in a game!](https://twitter.com/bbrode/status/536532439787507712)
---
I never really understood streaming to begin with. I mostly use clips to see if I would want to play a game before spending money, but aside from that I can't quite understand the reason behind watching. Do people watch while they play? Do people watch instead of play? Maybe its because I work full time? and the time I do have I spend gaming or doing other activities (like cooking or exercise). I just always felt I'd rather be playing a game than watching someone play one, and since I work during the day a lot of times they are only on then. 
---
I really just stopped playing after boomsday. It felt like the only reason O was playing was to save up do the quests and hit the 100 gold daily limit. As said in the post the polarized matchups and sometimes just feeling like you couldn't do anything about what the opponent was doing and games were doomed from the start. 
---
Classic always being Standard was a huge mistake. They have done some work to fix it, but it made the game feel too same-y for too many years. CCGs are about variety. Magic prints about a thousand different cards per year. Some are reprints, but there's a massive variety, and nothing stays in Standard forever. The meta doesn't settle for very long before it gets shaken up again in a major way.
---
Hearthstone doesn't have enough basic mechanics to provide enough variety. You have creatures, weapons, and spells and you have the hero powers. That's it. 
---
Magic has creatures that not only have deathrattles and battlecries, but also tons of different activated abilities. It has artifacts and enchantments with the same. It has lands that can also do different things. It has planeswalkers and an actual, interactive graveyard. And it allows you to interact at any time, not just on your turn. All of this creates massive gameplay variety across multiple formats.
---
Hearthstone just needs more *things*, more ways to do stuff, and more cards. More variety.
---
Honestly, the prevalence of decks that can generate ridiculous amounts of value and otk are the real problems just as said in this post. Any meta where midrange decks can't be viable is a horrible meta. Midrange decks are the epitome of unpolarized matchups. They are decks that hold the middle in all aspects of the game, speed, value generation, card draw, late game, early game. They are decks that try to be good at everything. As we have seen in this meta the ridiculousness of combo decks like goose druid, mechathun, cubelock, and the sheer speed of aggro decks like odd pally, or odd rouge make it nearly impossible to not play a very polarized deck and survive.

Doubling Imp would be a good start.

untrue. on the initial set release I opened somewhere around 70 packs and i pulled 3 legendaries and was bitter because that's how pack oppening works you never feel content.

Card games aren't exactly interesting to watch as a casual bystander. They're usually a combination of chess and poker with an interface laced often in some sort of fantasy, and rather abstract as a result. 
---
Games like MtG Arena and Yugioh Duel Links can't quite replicate the same sort of exciting moments seen with MOBAs, shooters, or sports. Even when they happen, they can quite often be chalked up to "luck of the draw" rather than skillful or perfectly timed play.
---
It's a flaw of the genre which Hearthstone has only managed to transcend with equal parts luck and creating so many potentially exciting moments through random effects.
---
Play hunter. Kill priests.

politics aside, the Chinese server is licensed to a seperate agent company in China, that updates are usually slower and have different montization models.

That does not prove that it can or can't.  Opponent's hand could be exactly those cards (with duplicates in opponent's hand)

-- Game is expensive to keep up with

-- Meta seems to be worsening

-- New mechanics generally aren't interesting

-- Skillcap too low (or rather, skill is too small a factor in determining game outcomes), but there's not as much you can do about this one
---
-- Lack of basic fucking features
---
-- At no point have I ever gotten the sense that the developers of Hearthstone have given a flying fuck what the community thinks or wants, like it's almost embarrassing how slow the devs are to respond to even the most basic of issues like nerfing an obviously overpowered card or fixing a fucking bug

Only the standard laddah is real.

&gt;In order to be comparable, there would need to be prominent bulges like how female characters have prominent and exaggerated breasts.
---
You mean like how in muscle march, some combat games,  husky guys are basically running around naked and have bulges as big as bananas and then they dog pile. The men here actually have bigger breast size in volume or even real life body builders who are huge.
---
The  previous youtube link of males butts, gay men and women are already drooling over the men in the comments. It's different demographics, on what appeals to others with exaggerated features.  Being "objectified" isn't always bigger features (sex organ) sometimes it revolves a theme of fantasy or fetish which is more exciting for a target audience. Do women really want a video game with character with a 15in dong because they seem to want something else.
---
One of the most top search for women's desire in p-hub is r@ape/rough sex. (Yikes)

Dog has hit the nail on the head. The basic problem with Hearthstone is how quickly it is solved. I have no idea how something like this can be sustainably solved, it seems like an unavoidable predicament. It would need a lot of creativity and effort to address this.
---
This is more an issue of how strong tutoring can be in classes that want to control. Stitched tracker was never an issue, because making one more guy for tempo isn't hunters win condition.
---
Here you go! It's a little unrefined, but that's to be expected. Some alternatives that I've considered are Druid of the Swarm and Spellbreaker. Your win condition with this deck is 1. Build large board 2. Branching Paths/PotW/Tauren

---
&gt; a) People would be upset if they had just dusted that card.  
---
 
---
Are they concerned about people getting mad over dust value or something else?
---
How about when they nerfing a core card part of deck, and the associated card of that deck like some expensive multiple copies of epic and single legendaries didn't get refund? When that happen , a lot of people feel bad because yes they may get compensation for the nerfed card, but for the niche epic/legendaries that user crafted to support that deck?  
---
Seems like they are just making excuses.
---
If they are afraid of people feeling upset, why not give full dust refund for that buffed card, so people can try the card(isn't the point of buffing card to see it more play/screentime) , people who recently dusted it then also can craft it back to see if they still like it.  If not , before the 2 week period, they can dust it.
---
I said mostly, not entirely. Skill + # of ranked games played will obviously influence your rank, that means nothing. even ignoring card pack/quest RNG and what decks you can compose as a result of that (which really shouldn't be ignored), the RNG of matchups + RNG of going 1st vs going 2nd + the RNG of card draws + the RNG of any RNG game effects is absolutely overwhelming, to the point that many games are decided before you even get to play them, unless your opponent plays like a moron. and the only way to mitigate any of that is to play fast decks with strong matchup spreads, which surprise leads to a pretty stale meta every time.
---
see also: https://youtu.be/2-3kxiOzMOg?t=481 I'm not gonna bother talking about this more cuz all that needs to be said is still in there
---
Be careful, none of the current Malygos decks will be functional after Standard rotation in two months.
---
So yeah it seems like they are just making excuses.
---
Hah, good one!
---
We haven't had an impactful expansion since Kobolds, I expect things will be different in April
---
Jaraxxus' hero power is OP as fuck, and since when has Warlock been about summoning endless armies of giants?
---
The reason Jaraxxus is not playable has nothing to do with his hero power.
---
Compare Hearthstone to the Arena client and its absolutely insane how crappy Hearthstone's interface is. Arena has been out for what, 6 months?
---
The game needs a separate PC version. The mobile version is so fucking huge I know people who delete it even though they play occasionally just because it's too big. It's kinda funny how bloated the mobile version is too, when the PC version has so many features lacking. Focus just playing the game / building decks to mobile. Give PC built-in deck tracking, w/l rates and all those extra goodies I need to download 3rd party programs for.
---
I'm sick of blizzard treating me, as a relatively competitive hearthstone player, that I don't know what I want. I want more deck slots, yeah the second page is nice but I can easily run through it.
---
Also - I'm not against nerfing more cards. But the fact that you are nerfing cards from the classic set at an alarming rate really shows the design flaws in your rotation system. More and more I feel like I don't know what the end goal of some of your design choices are.
---
You're missing the point.
---
Standard can only be stale for 2 years (in thoery). Wild stays stale. The powerful combos still exist even if new cards are introduced.
---
&gt;if you drew bad against aggro, it insta lose 
---
Welcome to Hearthstone. 
---
Holy hell, The dude fucking flips out when you get a golden legendary
---
Eyyyy
---
This is the first time I feel bad for not paying for something’s
---
I love playing hearthstone but the only deck I can play on standard is Midrange hunter becuase of cost reasons. And I feel bad every time becuase I know I’m playing a broken deck. But I can’t do anything about it. I don’t have any money. 
---
I wish I could play fun decks the decks I want to play the decks I want do stuff with. Yet I never will as by the time I have saved enough dust to do so, a new meta has already emerged.
---
Looks like it might be the first time OP is playing a divine spirit + inner fire priest, so no hate towards him having fun over this... but getting killed from 78hp is definitely NOT fun hahaha. 
---
I wonder if anybody ever opened a pack full of Legendaries
---
It's interesting he mentions Dirty Rat because it's a pretty controversial card. Lurk on the "New" tab of /r/hearthstone long enough, and you'll find plenty of suggestions from people who want something like Dirty Rat back in Standard but who are heavily downvoted by individuals who dislike the fact that cards like Dirty Rat can coinflip games. Unfortunately, I don't think there's an easy answer that will make everyone happy.
---
He mentions his interest for AutoChess. Thing that's nice about AutoChess and a card like Kazakus is that they give players more agency to respond to the current match. In AutoChess if you are behind, you can examine what the top players have in their roster and try to construct a late game roster that does well against it. You can also position your minions to maximize their potential against who you predict you'll go up against. 
---
With Kazakus, If I'm playing against Even Shaman, I'll roll for a board clear. If I'm playing against a combo deck, I'll try and roll for card draw to expedite my possibility of getting my combo pieces. If I'm playing against a N'zoth / Demon deck, I might roll for 10 mana polymorph everything.
---
How did you know he didn't have any doubles in hand?
---
Does your dad work in Blizzard or in Activision? 
---
As someone who plays Wild, I completely agree. Wild needs balance changes too. Maybe a higher power level to Standard can be tolerated, but they shouldn't be averse to considering it. Cards which are simultaeneously powerful and promote linear gameplay should be dealt with, especially in an eternal format, because such cards become staples in such a format and cause games to play out linearly every time.
---
To be fair, they did deal with NSW and Star Aligner problems, even though Aviana had to die for that deck solely because they didn't want to change Psychmelon because it would be in Standard for a long time.
---
And yes, I would hate to have to wait an eternity for any changes (if any). I hope they can be as proactive as they have been with the latest patches, with respect to eternal formats and ways to switch up deckbuilding as well.
---
It's 1 in 10 for a golden legendary. The chances of 27 legendaries and none of them are golden is the still 6%, which isn't that low. 
---
Mojomaster zihi feels like a tech card should be. It heavily messes with the opponents game plan while not out right winning the game or having 0 impact because you didn't hit a combo piece. Also knowing when to drop zihi is a skill test in itself. 
---
I'm no expert in this market, and I'm certainly not as experienced as many reading this but I stand by the assessment that Hearthstone would be a lot more fun, diverse if they did the time-released suggestions of every month in a third-mode akin to Standard/Wild that only two expansions were available to play. 
---
Will it be solved quickly? Absolutely. Will it change within 30 days? Absolutely. In the days of net-decking, the only solution I have is forced diversity with availability (or lack thereof). 
---
I would really love too....

Mush#1211 NA trading 80g quest
---
I find myself playing a bit more mtga than Hearthstone these days, and I think it's because mtg has more deck variety, more formats, a better crafting system, never changes a card once it's printed keeping familiarity. If Hearthstone implemented limited draft, and we get to keep cards, i might check that out.
---
There's such a wide variety of OTK out there, if I try to tech for all of there won't be any deck left to craft. Not to mention a huge lack of any anti-combo tech out there. 
---
I need dirty rat and coldlight Oracle back. Most combos can only really be countered by forcing your opponent to mill, which is currently pretty difficult.
---
 I just lost to Malygos rogue. I can guarantee you there wasn't some card my deck was missing that stopped me from winning that. Even if I destroyed his weapon he still would've had lethal in one turn with 10 mana.
---
MUST BE NIIIIICE.
---
Maybe a tournament mode?
---
I used to love finishing games with the big hit. The more I played I felt better finishing games with the smallest hit. Not sure what that says about me, but this clip satisfies the current me.
---
It's kinda weird that the set to 1 is done in hand as cards like [[tol'vir warden]] pull them from your deck iirc, so it's not quite so simple.

What kind of otk are you losing to? 
---
When you look at stream stats keep in mind that there's no competitive incentive to play ladder right now because we're between seasons. Autochess would be less appealing to competitive players if they needed high legend finishes in HS to qualify for tournaments.
---
Obviously the game is past its prime though. Not surprising given that it's 5 years old IMHO. I'm more surprised that it's still firmly on top when it comes to digital card games.
---
4 legendaries in a row, 1 golden + 1 epic. 
---
I'm not crying, you are.
---
I was in your boat and refused to craft her for months. I finally conceded (hehe) and did it. Honestly she’s won me a few games and I’m never mad to have her past turn 4 or 5. I would definitely recommend getting her if you can afford it.
---
Two words. "Control Warlock". Demonic Project, Gnomeferatu, an abundance of board clears, can really tech in something like marin if you face alot of rez priest. Hell if you're really ballsy use glinda with the gnomeferatus or bring Rin. The deck can easily run enough anti combo, some control winning cards such as Rin, and enough clears with defile,hellfire,TN,Godfrey to keep yourself from dying to aggro, only thing you really struggle againat is something like tempo mage
---
If you start, save your gold until April. The new expansion launches,  removing most of the standard rotation that is currently considered powerful in the meta. 
---
It's safe to assume the new cards will fill this power void, so I'd suggest looking up deck recipes for F2P decks just to drill yourself on gameplay while you farm gold for the next couple of months. 
---
You hacked apparently :(
---
&gt; Years of reading and hearing "u mad". 
---
That term is literally used to make fun of people for actually being mad. Not for "making a comment then moving on".
---
&gt; The term doesn't mean the same thing it does in the scientific world. We're not having a deep discussion on anger, we're talking about people being upset because a videogame changed an artwork.
---
Who said anything about science? You're trying to claim that a term is widely used differently online and I asked if you had any proof at all. Do you think science is the only place where people want evidence for broad claims of the redefinition of words? I even checked urbandictionary for you since that's probably your best shot and it doesn't suggest anything like what you're saying.
---
&gt; Words can mean different things in different contexts.
---
They sure can, but in this case they don't.
---
&gt; Not sure why you even thought I wouldn't, since this entire chain started from my multiple comments.
---
Because you personally said "make a comment and move on" which is not what you've done lol. It is, however, what I am going to do because this bores me.
---
The rerolling and staying on 2 quests does skew the results because you cannot reroll into the same quest and you can't have the same quest twice so your results will be slightly off from the expected one (but logically you'd expect your 50g to be lower and your 60g to be higher unless you hold onto 60g quests as well).
---
But that was more of an issue with Priest being shitty than with the game in general. Most decks were a bad match-up for Control Priest before LoE.  And at least in regards to Handlock you could save some Chows/Flash Heals for their Jaraxxus turn, so it wasn't a completely hopeless match-up.
---
two degenerate solitaire decks, ranked sure is fun 
---
If you cast Innervate or The coin at 10 mana, you still have 10 mana. It's completely impossible to play a card that costs 11 mana (without reducing the cost to 10 or less).
---
Two more questions:
---
1) 10 guaranteed legendary for first packs - do you think that I should buy 10 packs for each expansion which will go to wild in April (so I will not able to buy it anymore later), I probably not plan to play wild as I think I have better chances in standard (as I miss much of cards). But still can get advantage of at least dissenchat these cards if not keeping them for wild.
---
2) I plan to finish all adventures what I miss, Are there still same articles for decks made only of basic + adventures (something like https://dotesports.com/hearthstone/news/basic-adventures-decks-9-classes-loe-edition-26409), these were great start for budget decks.
---
BTW I found that I have 14530 dust now as I disenchant everything older than Old Gods in 2016 already. I build cheap midrange hunter which I try in ranked now https://hsreplay.net/decks/3Jrn0HZEeRmGNoBaKN3DTd/#tab=overview.
---
Most pro players don’t make their income from winnings. It depends from game to game (DOTA players can get millions) but a lot of games the tournaments are really just a platform to get you twitch and YouTube views 
---
Hehe.. UE is not there in my deck
---
Whizzbang tries to fill that hole but when the decks aren't that well optimized you just don't get as motivated. It still confuses me that the pre-made disco warlock deck doesn't have the quest in it. 
---
I think p &lt; 0.05 is useful, but as the start of a discussion not the end of one.  If you get a 95% confidence interval on something then the correct response is for a separate group of scientists with a separate sample to run the same experiment.  If they also get a p &lt;0.05 now you might be onto something.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **5th Cakeday** ERagingTyrant! ^(hug)
---
No worries. If you have any questions about the game feel free to PM me. I'll be happy to answer them.
---
I think that they should fast forward the next expansion/big rotation. Meta is getting stale and it needs a quick refresh,also wouldn't mind more but smaller expansions and balance patches
---
&gt; If people could draft for free, then players would keep redrafting until they found the most broken deck
---
But... why would that matter? Ok, so you build a super-broken deck in Casual Arena, and then what? Winning with it doesn't give you anything, there are no rewards, and if you enter a Regular Arena you're still subject to the Gold Fee for the entry + bucket RNG, it wouldn't be viable to keep redrafting until you again collect all pieces of the recipe for that "broken deck" you found in Casual
---
What about those special event quest, like back in fall when we could get 100 gold every day guaranteed?
---
Everything that makes the game boring/predictable/stale/unexciting is gone in April. Combine that with a shiny new expansion , hopefully this time with impactful but not extremely overpowered cards, and we're good to go again!
---
You can simply provide a spreadsheet of your openings. If he took that detailed of record of how many packs he opened to know that he maxed the pity timer every single time for four years I can't imagine he didn't so much as jot a note down. 
---
If you don't have bad cards, you don't have good cards. 2/2 taunt for 2 isn't bad. It's just worse than other options. Dr. Boom isn't the best 7 drop because he's great, he's the best 7 drop because the other ones are worse. If none of the worse 7 drops existed, he would be the worst. So yes, there will always be bad cards. If every card were the same in power level, there would be nothing to experiment with. Now the game has severe experimentation problems anyway, but then it would be even worse.
---
You don't need recording software. If you didn't care if people believed you then why would you say it? I would be incredibly naive to believe you, though. 
---
So happy :D Just wanted to share my happiness, maybe there's someone else here who just hit legend :)
---
Details: the third time was a charm after dying to the final boss twice. I played Casie's Midrange Hunter list R5-R1 5 stars with a 56% win rate in 111 games. After falling down a few stars I switched to Odd Paladin and won the last 5/6 games.

Well, rush was introduced with Witchwood and it's become a staple keyword, it's basically the new charge. Lifesteal is two expansions older than that but has also stuck around.
---
With that said, I definitely think that echo and the 'forbidden' effects should have found their way into more cards. I'd really like to see echo made a commonplace mechanic for future cards, it just has so much potential.
---
I will do another post with more in-depth breakdown of the quest I got because it is obvious that some quests (like Win 2 games) appear more frequently than other.
---
Also I believe 2 quests were added **during** my data collection :  "Take 30 turns" and "Draw 20 cards".  Regarding the fact that you can't have two of the same quest, I understand it skews the results, but I believe I red somewhere that there is also a timer that stops you from getting the same quest for a couple days after you got it, so it should also be taken into account (and it might actually skew it back the other way? Maybe?)
---

---
Nothing to see here guys
---
I know I’m new and bad but every time I try something fun - Dragon Soul, APM (just got a Mechathun and now trying it out) - hunters just eat me. Half of my deck is hunter-proofing. And then I had a hecking hour long writhe with a Druid on my Dragon Soul deck at rank 14. An *hour*, 18 turns with no cards in my deck. The first thought in my head is that maybe Inner Strength is Priest’s bread and butter because designers overlook it. 
---
I tried spirit of the dead but I didnt liked how it went to be honest.
---
This is the list I am using right now, the only thing that bothers me is death ringer as you say, since it pollutes the twilight call. But with this deck i can reliably get a thadius train going on on turn 5-7 90% of the time, and thats pretty good.
---
Of course, any polymorph/hex into stalag or feugen before they die once means you should concede, althogh with barnes and shadow essence, if they polymorph it, you still have the original copy in the deck to be able to get to thadius.

Okay. And how is going to have fun with no cards?

As I have said multiple times you will have less fun doing this than playing a different game as a FtP player.
---
The only improvement that have made to the new player experience is the beginner ranked zone. As soon as he is out of that he can do nothing besides play arena until he runs out of gold. He wont have a deck, they make it take forever to get to a deck, you don't get to pick the deck since it is based entirely on what you get in random packs.
---
He can 8 hours of fun or he can go find a different game that is not as predatory and just as fun.
---
He will have more fun in a different game unless he enjoys grinding. Because that is all current Hearthstone is.

I’m playing freeze shaman on ladder :)) Finally got from rank 12 - rank 10 
---
From what I saw it wasn't completely silent. People working at Blizzard had told pros (such as Kala) that there was going to be a 2019 HGC.
---
Not sure if the HotS team themselves were lied to or if they had to lie because of NDAs
---
&gt; With expansions every 45 days, balancing becomes less of an issue. If something is overpowered, it will either not be overpowered soon with the new exp release, or it can be nerfed.
---
It becomes more of an issue. If the solution to an overpowered expansion is to simply wait for the next expansion, shouldn't we be happy right now? Oh wait, it's happening right now and we're up in arms about it (and rightfully so). You can't even wait 2 months for the next expansion. Imagine that but with every expansion. 
---
&gt;Who gives a damn about the thematics of things?
---
Most players. It's why we prefer Hearthstone over other titles. We care about the visuals, the themes of each expansion, the flavor of cards. We love slamming down a Lord Jaraxxus and watching it destroy the current hero. We feel so epic dropping a Tirion Fordring and we humming its theme song. We get invested into the expansion lore. Without that, the game would just be mathematics problems. 
---
&gt; Each expansion would have half the cards of current expansions so it doesn't really require that much more work as card totals would be very close to the same as what we have now
---
Each expansion is supposed to feel unique. You give support to different archetypes, maybe invent a new keyword. Good luck keeping the expansions unique and fresh with 6 expansions a year.
---
&gt; Releasing a card a week or something like that isn't good enough. The only way it affects the meta is if it is OP, and that isn't a good thing in and of itself
---
I don't get your logic. You're saying that releasing a new card each week can only be bad because if it's op, it's bad and it's useless if it's not op. So then why is it ok to release "op" cards in expansions? OP cards change the meta, but for some reason, you're not ok with single card releases being op but you're alright with expansions being op?
---
&gt; We need substantive content released more frequently, whether that is every 45 days, 60 days, or whatever
---
Nerfs count as substantive content. I agree more substantive content needs to be released. That's what the second paragraph of my previous response was addressing. I don't however agree that more content should be released in the form of an expansion.
---
&gt; We just need it sooner than what it is now, because right now the game gets extremely dull a month or so after an expansion releases.
---
So the solution is to shorten the wait time to 2 months. Oh wait, we're already bored by the first month. 
---
&gt; The recent nerfs barely altered this as well.
---
I don't see druids on top anymore. I don't see hunters dominating the meta anymore. The nerfs had quite a big impact if you ask me. Sure, Baku and Genn are still around, but that's an issue with the cards Blizzard chose to nerf, not the nerfing philosphy itself. Wouldn't it be much easier to change the meta by changing existing cards slightly rather than release a bunch of new cards?
---
Is it a delay message or the *teaser* for the announcement of the announcement?
---
I think it might actually be the announcement of the announcement. 
---
It's actually not bad without cards if you're in casual or low level ranked. Source: am a casual f2p player who plays for fun.
---
Musical trailers are absolutely awesome, fight me.
---
i hate the guts out of that deck and i swear they allways get molde + razor on hand.
---
over the course of the game he played every card in his hand, and none were doubles. This is arena mind you so he only ever had &lt;5 cards. So it wasnt hard to figure out lol
---
?
---
3 expansions a year has always been too slow in today’s modern gaming world. Physical card games release more cards faster. 
---
If the next expansion (coming in another month or two) is just another “here is another new 100 cards with a few new mechanics (that are just variations on the same theme)” the game will be done for a lot of people. 
---
As powerful as the 2017 cards were, they did make it interesting with quests and death knights and legendary weapons. The problem was the power desparity between. There is A huge difference between the rogue quest and the hunter quest for example. A huge difference between Thrall and Guldan.  That should have been addressed. 
---
Everyone knew this...
---
Rank 5-1 is terrible at night. Much easier to climb during the day where people play joke decks or combo.
---
What about rush?
---
I try and use Dire Frenzy on either Spingpaw, Crackling Razormaw or Huffer usually. It depends on the circumstance but any of those can be useful. Same for Misha, doesn't hurt to have more taunt options.
---
Witchwood Apple really helps in conjunction with Wispering Woods and Twilight Drake, and the 1 mana hero power works well with Savage Striker and Sharkfin Fan. It's also good against odd paladin and mid-range hunter. Sometimes you do have 2 mana left over on a turn so the Apple fills in the gap.
---
An OTK specifically implies that all the cards involved are played on the turn they kill you. Cloning gallery priest is otk, as well as mechathun, this is not.
---
I just dusted a couple more competitive decks to build Tess rogue, and I couldn’t be happier. It’s just too much fun. 
---
Looks like a worse Odd Dragon Warrior to me (15/17 cards in common): better early minions but worse late game and no board clears. A middle ground between that deck and the more aggressive rush warrior with frothings, korkrons and Grommash. 
---
Also, have you tried DK Garrosh in your deck?
---
No I meant more like physical objects you'd use to represent the most recognizable cards of the year. Its for an art piece idea I have in mind
---
Hello.
---
Honstly i search google for forum but i can't find a good one.
---
Thanks for your hint.
---
&gt; Staying on top of your quests takes as little as playing three days a week
---
One 3 win quests should average out to take 6 games. Even if you partially completed other quests in the process, 6 games should take about an hour if each game takes 10 minutes. That's for the basic quest they give out. I am not actually familiar with the average game length currently but it is always going to vary by the deck you play anyways. Games used to average around 18 minutes for me I think. You cannot normally complete all 3 quests with one deck/6 games. So lets at minimum and another hour to it for the second quests and we will pretend you always complete your 3rd quests in the process of it. 2 hours if the CASUAL player decides to play perfectly to optimize his gold gain and plays a rush deck to finish games fast and as a beginner have an average win rate. Most new players I know of do not optimize their gold gain and play more than a face deck.
---
&gt; I'm not sure what you're considering "fun decks" but fun isn't inherently expensive unless you're referring to off-meta decks which I'd argue aren't fun at all since they're bound to have low win rates.
---
80% of the fun of this game is the deck building stages. You want to craft a deck around an idea and get it to the highest win rate possible. That means you need to tweak the deck, swap cards. Things you can't do if you don't have the cards you need.
---
Part of the reason people are leaving the game now is because matches are decided before the game even starts. There is not a good way to tweak the decks even if you have all of the cards. So, I guess that's a plus for new player? Good thing the game isn't balanced?

I'm on EU so hit me with a PM if you want to spectate my games so I can share my battletag. I was top 30 in both EU and NA on January 2018 when I tryharded, but nowadays I do more casual runs as I'm playing with a phone.
---
More expansions and rotating sets won't change the fact that it's going to be more on curve BS decks from new sets. The cards may be new but you're still playing the same decks as Secret paladin and odd paladin, just wearing a different pair of pants. Funny how Blizzard constantly rags on classic set autoincludes then just prints their own braindead blatant synergy autoincludes in their new sets. 
---
Town Crier is bonkers, probably the best 1 drop  together with firefly, springpaw and the cleric. If you like warrior you should definitively craft it. 
---
Yes they did.
---
The average Joe is literally the only reason the game is as popular as it is. HS was never meant to be a competitive/hardcore game and is by far the most casual CCG/TCG out there. It's people trying to turn the game into an e-sport/ hardcore game that ruined it.
---
Look at the last year. An entire year of boring expasions dedicated to reducing the power level. I'd rather have a bit of an unbalanced meta than the snorefest we've had for a year now any day.
---
I mean its not like people haven't suggested all those things years back and they have never shown any incentive to change anything. There has been close to no development since summer 2015 where they added tavern brawl. 
---
Its delusional to think that anything will change now just because a developer asked for feedback and twitter. 
---
Sorry, mobile client doesn't allow for that.
---
Yes, it's about managing expectations. People that complain about the 'F2P experience' are people that expect to have access to all the things paying consumers have. Without playing Arena, you won't have access to every deck in the game. However, you can relatively quickly build a couple of competitive decks. How many will depend on how liberally you disenchant and whether you can find some good substitutions for unowned cards. But it shouldn't take long to compete with the best decks, as long as you're good enough.
---
Alternatively, just get good at Arena and get a ton of cards that way.
---
Hey, just for the chance you're still into this deck haha. I've found that one copy of [[Sul'Thraze]] alone can swing the entire game. The ability to remove a lot if not all tokens/minions is a huge plus for this deck. It cuts through stuff like [[Saronite Chaingang]] like butter. 
---
And now we see all the pro players and streamers playing more auto chess than Hearthstone because there's no challenge in it to make the game seem fun anymore. 
---
Just as how the game needs casuals to rake in the money, the casuals need the top tier players to look up to to keep interested. Which is why games have a pro scene as advertisement.
---
We're just gonna have to agree to disagree if you're suggesting 80% of fun is in deck building. The best decks will almost always be discovered by professional players, and there's nothing wrong with that. Likewise, it's fine if you enjoy that aspect yourself, but if you're basing your perception of the game's cost on what it takes to enjoy deck building, I don't think that's in line with the way the majority of players experience the game and is ultimately a waste of resources that'll lead to the game being more expensive for you than it needs to be.

I think a mode where we rotated in different set combinations could keep things fresh, they did that for some tavern brawls.  A play mode for instance that rotates monthly or quarterly where decks can only be constructed with cards from Old Gods and Knights of the Frozen Throne for ex.  Since there can be tons of permutations of sets this could keep things fresh.
---
Well but it isn't just tutoring, right - you get a *copy* of the card, so you're getting your third Psychic Scream or Mind Blast or whatever. I think if it was an actual tutor then it would be far less powerful in terms of the redundancy it enables Priests to have
---
Men running around shirtless isn't '' ridicilous ''?

Hearthstone isn't logic it's tragic. The sad story of a boy who set out to collect cards but could never complete his collection. Who faced the counter to every deck he ever played on the ladder. Who got so many quests to do he never had time to really live. Who slowly faded away in the basement of his overweight mother.
---
Ahh supreme decks is defo a stretch for quest paladin. 
---
P.s I feel like that was probably an important part of the joke.
---
I'm not certain but I would think it's because Spirit Echo returns "this" to your hand. Not a copy of it, but the card itself. If that's how it makes the distinction, multiple instances of the same abilities shouldn't result in more copies of the minion.
---
You're a druid, I'm not gonna feel bad for you.

Well i mean it is not that bad in hearthstone since you play only for urself, but in a game thats essentially only about winning matches, its not really senseful to have acms that encourage you "not to win". 
---
Yes, and cubes before that. 
---
I can fully agree with this. I think a couple of my decks still use the death knight heroes. They are very cool cards and admittedly, a huge highlight back in the day, but now it feels like I’m at a disadvantage if I don’t use them. I’m a little excited to see them go away. 
---
Looking to trade Challenge a Friend quests, I can go first - Banjo#1810

Yeah, I have all golden and I'd like something like that. Maybe something like add some gems to the hero portrait? golden -&gt; 500, 1 gem -&gt; double that (1000), 2 gem -&gt; double that (2000), 3 gem -&gt; double that (4000), 4 gem 8000, 5 gem 16000. I don't think anybody currently has over 32k wins with a class, but that would be 6 gems and the most needed for years to come. I think the verbiage would also be nice "I'm a 2 gem mage" or "The only person to bring the deck is Fibonnaci, the 5 gem warrior"

It was good when Deathlord and Velen's was a thing. There was even the Silence Priest time when Purify, Silence, Divine Spirit/Inner Fire were great.

---
&gt; Can we have them all week long and ability to challenge friends to tavern brawls of our choosing?
---
I never realised until now just how much I want this.
---
Absolutely nailed it, and I would love to see one set from wild allowed into standard each season to spice things up.  As long as it is free though as I have dusted all my wild cards.
---
...I see what you did there...
---
Here's my 2 cents:
---
1) I always feel like you cannot control daily quests and single reroll per day feels like a joke (I'm really a Mage main like you described and have no pirates, nor I can win with Druid 3 times, because I doubt I played atleast 20 games with him in 3 years)
---
So my suggestion is simple - Make quests rerollable up to 10 times, with 2 decreased bounty gold per reroll after 3-5th times. Make feel players that they can control risk/reward for rerolling quests.
---
And yes, I want this 3723 gold, as I see no sense in having unroundable 205 anyway.
---
2) Make "greetings to returning players" little more enjoyable - like silently adjust random quest generations to give 3 quests for 80-100 gold after not playing for like a month or two. (I know somewhat of this implemented already, but having this "hook" like "Wow, there's nice quests!" would increase daily visiting in long run)
---
3) UnHoF IceBlock please, just delete it from random generation spell pool.
---
I have one (was tinkering with a similar deck), but I have no way of knowing if mine is anywhere as good as his (prolly not lol)
---
the deck mentioned in the post sounds more mid/lategamey, mine tries to win in the early/mid game

---

Have you tried checking out HSReplay.net for deck and tier lists?
---
And to think sub used to moan about a 2* 3/4 or a 4* 7/7. How things have changed now haha.
---
(Inb4 someone says they are just single cards and this is a combo) 
---
These aren't inconsistencies. Warlock gets healing centered around its identity of being amoral and willing to sacrifice and destroy anything to get what it wants. Again, the way classes use mechanics and why is where identity is actually found.
---
What you replace if you added the black knight?
---
ayyyy I know that guy, I get matched with him every 2-3 weeks or so
---
You barely had any constructive comments with the few you had, so I'd say that thread is not representative of the arena community. As a previous arena leaderboard player who barely plays Hearthstone anymore, I would totally play more Hearthstone again with a new draft mode (like Dungeon Run drafting, Rumble Run drafting, etc.).
---
As a player of Healzoo, this opening is quite rare. Usually I end up with the 1/3 taunt...and tap, tap, and more tap.
---
I think we can all agree Baku and Genn broke the game.
---
I personally got legend with hunter last season but i think due to shifts in the meta hunter is more viable than hunter now. To add, hunter also seems to have a few stronger decks and hunter also seems strong. But j think next month i’ll give hunter a try. To shake things up.
---
Hold your horses there. I would not say they have done ''bare minimum work'' over the past 5 years. We've had plentiful 130+ card expansions to go along with single player content since KotFT. Sure, there is room for improvement and aspects that can be criticized, but lack of content is not one of them in my opinion.
---
Also, I would not hold against them the fact that they asked for feedback. It shows that they want to listen to us. That is definitely not a 'flaw'. Feedback is valuable and asking for it is a good sign imo.
---
it was still trash even with deathlord and velen's
---
The tweet with the question was made exactly two days ago. March is right around the corner. Guess what's happening in March? That's right - the reveal and all kinds of info drops for the rotation and the next expansion
---
Exactly
---
You can just craft a Whizbang card and sample 18 decks and see if any of the styles suit you.
---
The previous expansion came out in early December. The next expansion will likely be in mid April. An expansion is not "right around the corner". By your logic, there is literally never a time that doesn't qualify as just after or just before an expansion.

&gt; Control and Combo decks take time to reflect upon prevalent aggressive decks, and are then refined rather later

Renolock would be unplayable if the sets rotated every month because of the lack of information about the current meta.
---
oh sorry forgot to edit it. yeah sorry its done. 
---
Long time F2P player, Ive never made it to Legend and never will for 2 reasons: I dont grind and I dont play meta decks. I enjoy playing Hearthstone I do the dailys and solo adventures.
---
 There is something very broken about this game, its evident in post after post of complaints yet Blizzard keeps the same game in place. I agree with most people who say the company is motivated only to make more profit.
---
 Personally in the 5 years Ive been playing Ive spent about 20 bucks, but Ive read about player's who have spent thousands and thats mind boggling. But those are the ones who keep the game stuck where its at.

This.

The matchmaking-formula is terrible, meeting most of the time antidecks - overall its well done.

BruceKettina #2413 EU 80g quest trade
---
My 2 Cents:
---
I still log on daily(reroll quests), but I'm not playing as much as I used to. I have been around since closed beta and I'm mainly playing Arena.
---
What the game needs in my mind(no particular order):
---
1. Achievements: A lot of people were already suggesting this and the idea has been around since forever. It should have been done by now. (I'm also missing my monthly Hearthstone Stats-Mail which at least for me vanished)
---
2. New game-modes: Tavern Brawl was a good thing, but after it was implemented, nothing big happened really besides some balancing or slight changes to some game-modes. Maybe Single Player-Content. Still, looking at other card games, there are a lot of possibilities.
---
3. More love for other game-modes beside constructed: First of all I love arena. I don't have the ressources to go for (Arena-)ladder (and I'm not good enough right now), but I always feel slightly pushed to constructed for Golden Heroes. I would love to make a progress in something(beside cards) and would love getting my golden heroes wins in arena. 
---
4. Tournament Mode: Working for every game-mode. 
---
What the game doesn't need:
---
1. Sticking to Dungeon Runs as Single Player Content: A lot of people seem to want this. I love dungeon runs/Monster Hunt/Whatever, but I absolutely loved the puzzles or the Adventures before and would love to see more experimentations and variance in this content then just sticking to Dungeon Runs. Dungeon Runs are still around and there is a high variance in there so it doesn't feel the same. If people love this, they could still play the old stuff. In addition the implementation of the latest "Dungeon Run" was awful by not being able to track the progress.
---
2. Focus too hard on pro-players/streamers suggestions: While I totally understand that those people have a big impact on the game, the majority is propably a lot more casual and won't profit from some changes that were suggested. When deciding where the ressources go to, it should be always reviewed if everyone will profit from those possible implementations. I have a couple streamers I like. It's not meant to be hate on streamers, they just have a different view on the game compared to the majority of players.
---
Top 100
---
It makes sense given that Equality-Pyromancer is still a six mana clear the board effect in a class known for its weak board sweeping effects.
---
That Brian Kimpler sounds like a smart guy.
---
Love this quiz! So far 57/100 with only a couple of repeat cards being shown. I wish that it would be less strict about words like 'the'.
---
There's a lot of overlapping effects too, so it's more general purpose for those types of cards. It also allows for people who enjoy niche decks like Espionage Rogue to get golden copies of those cards without the huge investment. It promotes you sticking with decks to earn the rewards, and punishes those who tend to bounce around a lot. Irregardless, it's rewards for doing what you already do every single day logging in and playing. Getting a golden card tomorrow or next year is irrelevant, because you'll eventually earn it when you feel like it.
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself. Who cares if yet another person is grinding out cancer decks? Hope he had fun getting to legend!
---
Shaman this week is **Krag'wa's Lure** (After you Overload, give your minions that much Attack.)
---
Zentimo's is Krag'wa's Lure (the Overload one).
---
Using Big Priest to evaluate the viability of Dirty Rat is pretty garbage, since it's not particularly good in that match-up (also Big Priest isn't a combo deck lol). If you don't have polymorph-like effects in your deck (which unless i'm mistaken most classes don't have access to reliable polymorphs), then there's literally only card that Dirty Rat could hit that'd significantly disrupt their gameplan (Barnes). It's a much better tech option against other decks.
---
With Gnomeferatu, I can agree with you. It's definitely a card that always feels good whenever you play it, regardless of whether or not it's actually helping your win percentage. It's still a good card to have in the game even if it's bad, since it at least gives you some chance to burn a crucial combo piece. And it doesn't destroy half your deck doing so.
---
This game is run by clowns

Do you have a source where they "touted that fact"? Because I don't believe they ever said anything about it, it was just a bug and they fixed it.
---
Well written.
---
One I would like to see is a change to Genn and Baku. So we have 4 months, in general, between sets.
---
So for month one, (this could be it's own Format but most likely standard would be fine) even and odd decks are disabled. Month two, open up either odd or even decks. Month three, close the one that was just open but open the other. Final month prior to expansion, open both.
---
Adds a bit of freshness. I know a lot of people hate on the odd and even but a lot of us like it too.
---
I don't have the cards to play standard and I'm not good enough to only play arena. This means my two options are to spend $200 on packs or to go fuck myself.
---
I just want to play arena man
---
What, you mean his name isn't RAFAAM, THE SUPREME ARCHEOLOGIST?
---
I'd say thats why we need a PTR (player testing realm) for people to try new decks out before investing. 
---
With how many resources we have about play rates, win rates, match ups etc now though, investing has never been better. 
---
I agree fully with the majotrity of what you said, And i like the proposed solution. Great idear ! 
---
As far as ameliorations for the idear, i feel that in term of actual numbers they seems very low imo. 
---
Like 50 games where you use 1 flanking to get the golden copy is actually very little. I was very happy to have accomplished golden class heroes for the ones i like but now that it has been more than 2 years that i had that reward and nothing else to accomplish i'm kinda lacking a reward to reach out for thoses classes i like.
---
And that was not 50 but 500 and it was not just played but won. And i am fairly casual connecting 3 times a week mainly to complete quests. And i couldn't get that heroe golden copy  in a pack.
---
So for your exemple of flanking strike, as it is a rotating card i don't want to go to ham, but maybe 50 or 100 times your number ( so 10000 damage) as you can put 2 in a deck. 
---
My concern for blizzard (and so for the players because if blizzard make no money then no money to spend on making great expensions and single player content) is that if it is so easy, i will be enclined to play in every brawl, advanture and such card that i randomly got in a pack and that can be a fill for any deck  but that don't care about (hello Drakkari Trickster ). And get easily the golden version, Dust it for free other epic of my choice. 
---
I buy only some of the bundles and sometimes a preorder, but not always as i feel i already can play with most of the card that i find interesting. If i could abuse the system like this, i'm 100% sure i won't need to buy anything anymore. so definitely put the goal way up, but great idear that could motivate me some more ty.
---
I would agree he's probably the best neutral legendary (outside of genn/baku) as of late.  Just thought it was funny throwing shade at him alongside the DKs.  The amount of decks he's in definitely is evidence of his power level though but nowhere near DK.
---
&gt; My own fault for having 3 but still super frustrating
---
It's not even your own fault, based on how it went last week it would've been reasonable for you to assume they'd give you a 4th quest. This is Blizzard being ridiculous. 
---
I don’t really care how people spend their dust but crafting LK a couple months before he rotates is just stupid.
---
Tri-class, or quests. And it is my last word.
---
"Slowing it down" is exactly what we're after, right? Requiring a larger fraction of the time between expansions to solve the meta?  
---
  
---
Mix that with some far more frequent balance changes (possibly including buffs), rotating sets in Wild month-to-month, and a return to HS's original new card design principles (in which resources matter), and I think the game would be far more fun for much longer stretches at a time.
---
Druidstone is back.
---
Yes! Rewarding experimentation would be so fun and random so people can play just because the fun of making weird stuff, not because the want or need to win
---
it is a special quest,you can't reroll it and it disappear out of you quest log if you don't complete it before the event runs out, and we all thought it was a feature and now is suddenly a bug.. Blizz is really busy shooting them self in the foot lately.
---
Aya, Kazakus or Patches - your pick!
---
OMG the sky is falling!
---
They probably meant to implement that so you can have all 4 quests at the same time, but it was bugged and if you rerolled a quest it'd just delete the quest instead..seems like they reverted the change because of the bug. Definitely a step backward
---
PRECISION
---
You can do that already wtf
---
Are you familiar with the phrase "You can't have your cake and eat it"? 
---
You choose to play these archetypes. Your reward is, presumably, more enjoyment than you'd get from playing a fast deck. I'm sure that a significant number of those playing fast decks would prefer to play slow decks but choose not to, reducing their enjoyment because of either budget or time constraints. 
---
Your third suggestion is fine, so is the second as long as it's capped at levels that don't effectively penalise new players, but the first suggestion is an absolute No. Reward for overall time played, sure, but do NOT reward for time spent per game. 
---
That matchup should have been considered and avoided in the brawl
---
No I don't think it's the end of the world but give me one reason this was a good change

i was hoping for some more funny stories to come by, i appreciate you for sharing!
---
Just played 3.  I don't think this week rewards a Rumble pack as I didn't get any. 
---
All the classes kind of smush together for me and I think there's something to be said about that. Aggro Shaman and Aggro Paladin are all just hit the button and attack, and honestly earlier versions of Aggro Hunter back when Face Hunter was the real deal felt the same way.   
---
This really isn't the case in Magic. Mono Blue Aggro is dominating the format right now and it feels significantly different from Mono Red Aggro. Blue has counter effects and flying. Red chucks fire at your face at a rapid pace.  
---
HS doesn't really have this and I think that's whats disappointing. If Paladin is the class that buffs little dudes and such, then I want that to be a major part of their aggro strategy. If hunter is all about quick damage to the face, I want them to do that better than Paladin. Honestly.... I have NO idea what Shaman's deal is supposed to be. 
---
I'm not sure what you're doing with your resources then because I do just that and can build multiple top tier decks every expansion and usually play around Rank 5 each month.
---
Like I've been saying elsewhere, it's fine if you enjoy experimenting, but it's a bit unreasonable to expect it to be affordable.
---
Feel like Patches really should have been nerfed from charge to rush. He's such a sad card now, and this pity is from me, someone who hated playing against pirate warrior as much as anyone.
---
Been here for 5 years seen it before. Don’t believe it, they don’t understand their own game, never have.
---
I think they are actually moving in this direction: the last two expansions particularly have been lower power level than the ones before.  (If they were to nerf/HoF Genn and Baku, you could pull the Witchwood into that discussion as well.)  The point being that if they pull the high end of the value curve down, then they're more able to pull the bottom end up to match it, the trouble is that the rotation schedule limits how fast they can do that.  There are still good cards for money to chase, they're just not so ridiculously good that they break the game like the death knights.
---
I’d like to see adapt on a new set. I feel it was creative and fun enough to make games interesting, yet didn’t dominate the decks/meta.
---
Obviously it was themed around Un’Goro so the lore behind it would need updating.
---
Outside of poison it was an innocent mechanic. 
---
Your commentary reminded me of what a friend of mine who plays magic said.
---
That I could go to a magic event and the people give you a pack of the new expansion for free!! Obviously is just for a day, but damn, that is a good strategy to keep players coming.
---
Same with pokemon go, Niantic implemented many things to keep players coming, rewards for coming daily and playing, that's something I wish HS could implement
---
time to make r9k mode for ladder where a factor of your climb speed is how popular your deck is.
---
Oh wow this post just made me realize this lineup follows lawful good- chaotic evil chart in a weird way.
---
Are you playing the control variant with Dragon's Fury or the secret variant with Explosive Runes?
---
Frost Lich Jaina fits exceptionally well into the former while typically falling short in the latter.
---
you just gotta wait for the Lure to revive. timing is key with this one
---
assume your Lure will die in Turn 1 or 2, then play the next 2 turns carefully -- playing regular minions, but saving your Overload ones.  then Lure comes back, you play a Lightning Storm or Flamewreathed Faceless, and it's go time
---
there is no draw screen. I had a few "draws" with eye for an eye against jade druids. It was "defeat" even tho we both died.
---
Why do people think frequent meta shifts would be a good thing in a game where people already complain about costs?
---
Also, you can't just increase the number of expansions and say it would take no extra work. That's not expansions, metas, marketing, or anything works.
---
A mixture of both actually... I had to get creative in replacing missing cards
---
Depends on the match up. Usually Jaina helps you win the heavy control match ups. Other than that its just nice to have in the deck. Tbh the card is a bit overrated if you read the redditors but still a very strong card.
---
Don Han'Sho: I am a joke to-- Nevermind... 
---
**Defenders of Whatever** doesnt need a name change.. its great
---
i dont get "three musketeers" tho
---
A backstabber, if ever I saw one! 
---
What they should encourage is having a diverse collection, rather than a refined collection. Basically, give us more packs (why would they do that?) and increase the crafting cost of cards, so that it's harder to just craft tier 1 deck after playing the game for a week, but I have a lot more cards, so I can experiment and try more cards (I just might not have the exact cards I want)  
---
We need more cards, but to maintain the economy, increase crafting costs of cards
---
I didnt realized that the trio classes are all lined up in a row when I played mean streets now I feel stupid lol
---
And I think it was really just nerfed for consistency sake it’s not the first time they have done those. Hunters mark and equality can’t cost the same! So they gave the similar cards both double mana costs. 
---
This game is getting to be Yu-Gi-Oh levels of stupid
---
Yeah, the good guys.
---
There is already a 2/4 taunt for 3 mana. And it was never played. And it was an expansion card.
---
And a 1/5 taunt for 3 would be an insane power creep to the Am'gam Rager, which is just a vanilla 1/5. 
---
I mean, I've been playing since closed beta too.  I have absolutely zero faith in the developers.  Regardless of that, this may be the first time they've seen a worrisome drop in their playerbase.  The only thing that's going to make them change anything is money, and perhaps they're finally in that situation.
---
I beat a Mecha'thun drood today with mid-range hunter... After he got his auctioneer out and did his little thing I was able to craft a mukkla zombeast and I held it until he emptied his deck and had three cards left in hand - played the banana guy and let him figure it out. 
---
I felt similarly pointless playing Zul'jins eck a moment ago.  The first mana-playable card I drew was on turn 6, so i was already dead by the time i could play a card.
---
And combined with having seen mage this week, I think last week's brawl was way more balanced.
---
You can't "have" a deck without spending the dust for crafting it. My point is there should be a freebie way to craft a deck and try it out BEFORE dumping all the dust into it. That way new players aren't punished for experimenting.
---
She's an elf, and to me elf=bad guy, no matter how sexy they are.
---
Annnnnnnnnd now Tia Tequilla is now acting out the burning of the world tree with a priceless aincent giant redwood. 
---
&gt;The best I could come up with in terms of keeping the game fresh for a reasonable amount of time is releasing a new expansion every month and giving it free to everyone...
---
Remember when you could buy entire expansions for a set amount of gold? Good times.
---
Big if true
---
I love that last one.
---
“Oh you know Valeera, Gul’dan, and Garrosh?”
---
“Oh yeah, ‘totally not the bad guys’ - Yeah I loved them om broadway”
---
Exactly. Players are good at noticing problem, not at offering solutions. 
---
They should get rid of golden cards being a dust resource and just make them a cosmetic thing so they they are just fun. Golden cards are awesome but my time and money are finite so most of the time they get dusted and i dont get to play with them. Then adjust dust value of cards to bring average dust per pack back in line with what it currently is. This way you can reward players with golden cards without giving away a bunch of free dust. And then a reward system around golden cards can let players earn their little incremental rewards without making them feel like they need to destroy the rewards to stay competitive.
---
I left 3 quests open after seeing the 4th spot last week and was really bummed to see a 60G quest get replaced. 
---
Glad I won my 2 card packs for this week. Now its Paladin fest 2019. Oh what fun it is to play against that OP bullshit. 
---
I've been playing since Nax so there's definitely an advantage there, but I was pretty bad at managing my resources back then. Likewise, I've tested out the new player experience multiple times over the past couple years and have found that the practices I do now on my main account can really help in becoming established on a new account a lot quicker than people might expect.
---
I find in general people are overly conservative with accessing their resources while being simultaneously overly liberal with how they use what resources they do allow themselves. The result is that I think people are making the game more expensive for themselves than it needs to be. For example, if you ever use the mass disenchant button, you're probably not managing your resources as well as you could be. Likewise, if you buy packs throughout the course of an expansion, you're missing out on some small advantages that can really stack up.
---
I think people miss out on a lot of these details and end up in a position where they're frustrating yet can't see how they could have done things any differently when alternatives *were* possible.
---
Thank you! Will do 
---
Pogo rogue is fun
---
I don't so much want a tournament mode, I want an open-lobby mode where my friends and I can have a big group chat, and we can take turns rotating matches and spectating each other, laughing and cheering on plays, etc.
---
MTG: Arena is quickly filling the void that Hearthstone failed to take over despite almost zero competition for 5 years.
---
Custom hearthstones did something like that when msg rotated out. I think it was DeathKights (paladin, warlock, warrior), Monks(priest, shaman, druid), And Demon Hunters(Hunter, rogue, mage). This was before the Deathknight expansion. But now it could be a good reason to introduce cards that generate Deathkight class cards after Lich King and Arfus rotate. Plus three new hero cards.
---
\` they request not to hotlink them, but I have chosen to ignore that for now \`  
---
Why would you ignore that, they don't want to be hotlinked for a reason.

I always found motivation was the biggest issue - you can make Keleseth aggro work for at least 30-40% wins, probably more like 60% against weaker opponents, regardless of class. It's just dull and eats a lot of your time.
---
Win quests are definitely awful in general.
---
This is both hilarious and sad imagery.
---
I don't hate them for the reasons you suggested - I hate them because it makes the game very rote and predictable, because people simply Hero Power as much as possible. 
---
I don't have to predict what the opponent is going to do, I *know* what they're going to do, but what they're going to do is very reliable and strong. It removes RNG from the game in a very boring way.
---
I wouldn't call it a lack of understanding but rather artistic arrogance. To me they were much like Apple during the Steve Jobs era, if you aren't with us, you don't belong always.
---
In their eyes as long as the product was top notch they don't have to kneel to the lowly consumer demands. Decks slots? More modes? But our UI is so concise and elegant! Why need more play modes when out cards and game experience is so transcendent.
---
And much like Apple, the magic don't past forever. It is now you are seeing the consumer capitulation when just a pretty game isn't enough.
---
SHHHHHH! Ya just got our 4th quest taken away! 
---
Every single past champions I've chosen always ended up with one pack.
---
This time I went random. I'm sorry LFcaimiao for cursing you with this fate.
---
I actually lost another quest as well. I had the challenge a friend quest and it is gone after completing the brawl quest. Clearly I cannot complete that quest while doing the TB, so not sure what happened. Is this a known bug?
---
Hence, there's not good at those ranks
---
&gt;If this was a bug, they should make more bugs since this was one of the best features in the last year.
---
Sad, but true.
---
A lot more cards from Boomsday saw play than people seem to give it credit for, but a low impact was always to be expected with the high power level of the Mammoth sets.
---
It'll be fun having Raven cards finally see play after rotation. It'll be like having multiple new sets at once.
---
Humm. alright. I think I'm ok where I'm at then.
---
That was a terrible Druid player. How can you have only 78 HP on turn 10?
---
The only change that would be a decent idea would be to go from three expansions a year to four like how MTG and Yugioh do it, rather than splitting the three we have now into six or nine.
---
No way 24 hours for full dust. First, people who log in every morning would just dust and recraft. Second, even if you did somehow limit it to a one card per full refund, people would cry when the meta shifted and they wanted to try the card again.
---
I COULD get on board with something so close, like a 90% dust refund. So you're kinda.....renting the card. Only been once or twice but have made a deck I realized was totally boring. I'd be fine with.....well, I tried for an hour. Only out 200 dust instead of 2000
---
This interaction has been in place since Rumble Run was released. I doubt they’re going to fix it. They’re probably keeping it in for the LOLs. 
---
Me too, they are tons of fun.
---
Maybe problem isn't the best word. It's more just something that needs to be accepted about a card game. Decks would definitely be more creative and deckbuilding would be more fun if they didn't exist, but you're right that there's nothing wrong with their existence. 
---
I think the meta formed in each of those expansions at the same rate, but the difference is that the decks in those metas were actually different than the ones that came before them. That's why I agree that last year's expansions has made this year feel stale as a result. 
---
6+ might have some synergy with murloc for late game voltron kill. Thanks for pointing out!
---
The game needs custom mode where people can set deck rules. Players could set their own meta with their own formats. Might even encourage people to buy more packs to build cards to play around these custom games.
---
I see your point, but that only makes sense without player error. One might attack face because they're inching close to lethal but opted to clear the enemy's board. That could leave them the opportunity for punishment. While having the board is certainly advantageous, choices can ultimately throw or take back games.
---
Which class do you think would be dominant in this format?
---
I've said this to some other people in this thread but maybe there's a balance between splitting each expansion in halves instead of thirds. I agree that another expansion each year would be better but I was trying to find a work-around for everyone who don't want the game's price to jump up. 
---
hes referring to the fact that the word "appreciates" is spelled incorrectly.
---
Why would I need defense?
---
Ah never paid attention to the spelling as well, look at half the words. 
---
Forgot to clear a quest yesterday since the pack one would eat up a slot so I lost a quest again this week. At least the pack had Krag'wa I'll take it and move on with my life.
---
rodger or tyler..... for a totally normal name
---
Yeah, honestly although the game isnt entirely pay to win as people have carried new accounts to legend, its absolutely pay to have win cause the fun synergy cards you would use to experiment are tied to the epic and legendary tier.
---
28 feb - 4 mar
---
If you care about your dust/money, you shouldn't build any deck before the rotation. Most decks (that are not odd/even) will die.
---
Cube lock was NOT obvious... When carnivorous cube was released people basically said “interesting card but no idea if it will be good”. It took several weeks for the initial cubelock lists to even surface.
---
They obviously knew you could get 1 doomguard from hand but I doubt they knew that there would be a tier 1 deck that goes skull into doomguard pull cube+pact. If you said this in an initial card impression thread someone would say “nice meme high roll deck”.
---
With shudderwock I agree, I’m sure they saw grumble* shudder interaction and maybe even with saronite and lifedrinker but probably didn’t think it was fast enough to be a good combo deck. There’s just no way they know how powerful these decks will be when the lists get refined 
---
Vicious Syndicate if you want to see the topdecks.
---
I also use hearthpwn when I want to find a deck that use "this and that"; Enter the cards, sort by class/ranked/patch/etc... then sort by the top views, gives you an idea of what the deck would look like.
---
Perfection.
---
Theres some glaring issues with this idea while it's unique and i like it. Sadly I think it would be bad for the game. Why?
---
There's no way for Blizzard to reward you on playing a specific deck because they can't track it. You could have crafted a midrange hunter deck but have a few different cards than the netdeck so how does blizzard know you're using the midrange hunter deck? 
---
As for rewarding based on playing certain cards.. I like the idea but it forces people into playing specific cards, specific classes, archetypes etc for too long. Any system designed to reward you for playing a specific class, card or archetype is bad for the game. They do it on a very small scale with the quests already and that's fine because it's very low numbers like play 6 dragons, which are in many decks and easy to play in one or two games. 
---
There might be a way to mess around with your idea to make it healthy and work for everyone but right now i don't see it. 
---

Well I recorded this when dungeon run had just come out with the intention of uploading it. I found it while cleaning up my OBS recordings and OBS names files the date and time its recorded, thats how I know it’s a over a year old.

Hey Folks,
---
Just to update everyone: we are working on getting the rankings up ASAP... apologies for the delay. Going forward, we are talking as a team about the best way to go about this. Overall, we'd love to find an evergreen spot where you all can continuously go to rather than multiple blog posts. As mentioned, we are still working through this but we know it's important to you all... it's important to us. We'll be sure to keep you updated once we have a more concrete plan.
---
Cheers,

---
&gt;Nothing this year, just been saving for the next expansion.
---
I meant this Standard year.
---
Not to be rude, but this doesn't sound like a very effective use of resources. You had Baku but never crafted another Odd deck? And you crafted incomplete versions of decks and then abandoned them?
---
I get not being interested in every deck, and I get feeling like you should get more for your investment, but at a certain point, you have to accept the game for what it is and work *with* it if you want to feel good about putting money into it. Two hundred bucks seems like an awful lot to spend on a game you aren't certain will be a worthwhile investment.
---
Yup.  There are so many strange combos that happen with this deck.  Every game it seems like you have a slightly different strategy.  I think this deck has been flying under the radar since the last nerfs. 
---
Primitive 
---
This brawl is complete shit.
---
Have an upvote for originality.

i miss bloodtrail :(

I don't think we were allowed to have 4.
---
You can see the corners of where the class image borders have been clipped.
---
&gt; Most non-hunters are paladin with upgraded hero skills.
---
I mean it fudamentally is a "grind". But you cannot change that unless you overhaul the complete system into something other than a ladder.  And making the grind easier doesn't actually help the game.
---
Geekest looking from largest pool = winner.
---
Agreed. I really enjoy the tavern brawl and never miss quests. Maybe I’ll try to get better decks and rank up. What’s your rank? 
---
If you are going to just dust the cards, wait until April.  If you play wild Black Rock is nice for like 3-4 cards.   If you play standard only save up to buy 1 pack at a time to manipulate the pity timer as best you can on the new set.
---
Defective.
---
I like Ike!

Fuck the fucking fuck.

Rank 15 player with da rank 15 comments.
---
Yes he says it feels repetitive , but not because the r4-legend feels grindy. Rather because there is not teching involved, meta gets solved too quick and the current card design is bad. If there were better designed cards and more ways to tech against certain decks so deckbuilding becomes relevant again the game wouldn't feel so repetitive. 
---
Kazakus is a shapeshifting dragon.
---
Thanks for fixing the issue of me wanting to log in! 
---
Wow, that seems so absolutely greedy of Blizzard.  
---
Midrange hunter and zoo have a bone to pick with this comment, as well as myracle rogue, spiteful decks, secret paladin, wall priest, control priest, etc etc.
---
I do that but when I see a deck list that was awesome I want them to send me a copy.   So toxic environment is around when RNG come bringing his 1 Mana cards.
---
So they can do hotfixes for bugs.... I heard the technology wasn't there.
---
Why
---
Appreciate the feedback taco, not a bad idea for sure! 
---
This is also hinted at in Mean Streets of Gadgetzan cinematic trailer where you can see a large dragon sitting alongside Aya, Don Hancho and other notable citizens. 
---
Didn't know that! Makes a lot more sense now. 
---
Though I gotta say that that mysterious leader looks very familiar.
---
There wasn't one front page, and it looked like everyone was just making their own topics... IDK. 
---
NA, 80g trade, you first
---
Hashishin#1928
---
is this actually good?
---
Blizzard fucked up quests by catering to drooling retards.
---
Originally, quests were supposed to be zero mana, but they found that a small percentage of morons would forget to play them when the quest was free.
---
So they raised the cost and completely rebalanced them. The end result being a card that was either completely broken OP or unplayable trash. 
---
Because at least idiots could play them. 
---
Big Priest is a "synergy" deck, but where you draw the line between "synergy" and "combo" is blurry between different people.
---
I would call Deathrattle Hunter a "combo" deck, but it's clearly midrange.  Most people use "combo" to refer to control decks with an OTK, but then at the same time you've got Control Priest, which is a soft-combo deck that uses Mind Blast + Mind Blast as its 'combo'.  Old-school Miracle Rogue with its 18-damage Shadowstep Leeroy turns also had a "combo" finisher, but people didn't really call it a combo deck.
---
Long story short, I think "combo" is a matter of degree and that Big Priest falls farther than the midway point on the combo side.
---
Totally not the bad guys lmao
---
No problem :)
---
Good luck with it!
---
It’s addictive dude
---
Everyone knows.  The more syllables you can cram into a sentence.  The smarter you are.
---
If you buy packs with wow gold it's pretty easy to purchase meta expansions. 
---
Shudderwock is fundamentally broken and it should nerfed instead of keep limiting other cards!
