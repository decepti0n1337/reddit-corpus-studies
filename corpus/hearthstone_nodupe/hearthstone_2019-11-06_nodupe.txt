5.6k comments, this feels more unlikely than Manchester united going into the europa league next season
---
It was in the Taverns of Time arena event previously
---
I believe!
---
Honestly, it's pathetic.
---
Hi
---
Its actually from the Taverns of Time arena event, and they brought it to battlegrounds.
---
Just giving a shot!
---
Gimme the booty
---
This issue has been resolved! If you restart the client, that should fix you right up!
---
It's supposed to get people to experiment with new decks but noone does that. Get the pirate quest? Slam every pirate into a deck and go into casual until it's done.
---
I'm also seeing the same problem when dealing with 1 gold card &amp; 1 regular. Cant even queue into games.....
---
Blizzard pls......
---
iOS is live!
---
OwO
---
F2P
---
prettymuch this. as dumb as it was that it was ever possible to queue the same opponent twice in a row, streamers babyraging over being counterqueued was the best entertainment on twitch.
---
Pog
---
I can't mute opponents emotes anymore
---
pls
---
But Blizzard is already taking notes XDDD!!
---
What is the complain that people are running competitive tier decks built strategically in RANKED mode? You should not be complaining that you can't just get right into the meta when you have no cards in standard and have not played for years.
---
The bottom line is, there is probably an over representation of men playing this game, despite there being many women too, so the chances of being very good at this game and to be a woman at the same time is just lower, when the talent pool in absolute numbers are smaller too.
---
Haha, at this point it seems there's no one working on fixing the bugs. So here are just a few of the "small" issues:
---
- the game on Android still moves really slow (and it has getting slower in the last couple of months), regardless of the device used or the type of connection (WiFi or mobile data);
---
- they've gotten rid of some of the daily quests so of course now we aren't getting any quests;
---
- the squelch button is broken (I don't know how on Earth they managed to break that bit maybe it is related to the Battleground mode and its emotes);
---
- there's a bug that's been in the game since almost the beginning where if you're disconnected from the game, the next time you go in the play mode of you're not paying attention you'll end up playing a game in casual mode (it seems that it defaults somehow to that option);
---
- similarly there's one where when selecting your deck it somehow defaults to the top right deck;
---
- apparently now when you have no quests you are instructed to go and play against the Inkeeper to unlock (?) new heroes (sidenote: I'm on 1000 with every hero so I would love unlocking new ones);
---
- you can flip a coin (or better role a die) and get the approximate chances of the reconnect feature to work.
---
To top it up, writing on the Blizzard forums and / or opening tickets is either ignored or handled by a "professional" that gives advices like "please try and craft that uncraftable basic card" or just says "we are aware of that".
---
At this point people should really be asking themselves if it is worth it to give this company any kind of their resources since the game quality has drastically decreased.
---
Ok, Boomer
---
As someone with a pixel 3, I can assure you my problems are not based on ram. It's really poorly optimized on mobile
---
It's not new, all free Blizzcon cards are like this.  [[Elite Tauren Chieftain]] for example.
---
MIND IF I ROLL NEEEEEED?
---
Hey Folks, we are looking into all of these issues as we speak. You're right, this definitely isn't a good experience and I'm sorry for that. 
---
I will try to provide updates as I can!

plz gib pax

Yes
---
1/5600 i like those odds come on rng
---
I could definitely need more packs ^^
---
No. Not in a game like Hearthstone with rarity based deck building restrictions.
---
That sounds horrendous to play against.
---
How many "feels bad" moment have you had against Silence effects? 
---
Now imagine if instead of knocking out one or two cards it knocked out your entire deck like Gnomeferatu could against a Mecha'thun or Malygos deck.
---
It wouldn't help "balance" the game. It would make playing decks based around Uldum Quests or Hero powers feel awful.
---
I support china so pls Blizzard
---
Packs please
---
What do you have to do to get a a pack?
---
this has been popping up everywhere so why not...
---
Guess I'll have to buy the $79.99 preorder to get some packs. Oh well...

This is excellent! Thank you :D

Oko should be banned. Oops wrong reddit

Yes pls

I would love to win this!

Hs won't even be an esport in 5 years.

So far nothing said on Twitter. I now understand why Fortnite does 4:00am updates, so they can fix things during the day. Hearthstone releases it so late in the work day that everyone’s now gone and there’s nothing to be done until tomorrow. :(
---
pleeeeeease give me the looootttt thanks!
---
Craft Baku and play wild till you build up a collection. Odd Rogue is pretty cheap to craft and so long as you have Baku you can supplement with classic cards till you fill up. If you really have a bad collection craft genn. Even paladin works ok with just basic cards. I think trump had a video on it years ago.

The win count is based on your class, not based on which specific hero you are choosing to play

Gaara is back from Artifact? Hearthstone really is gaining momentum again

It’s a new legendary right? I was confused how it was in a classic pack.

First pre-order hype?

At least they included Thijs this time, after not giving him a card reveal last time. Going for Rust Buckets.

These sort of mistakes don't happen because the in-house testers just didn't test for them right? Somewhere along the way someone made the decision to not give them enough time. I would prefer if this patch came out next week without being broken, and without forcing any programmers to forgo sleep.
---
Bad news, it was a hydra. By fixing those crash to home screen issues they have introduced broken decks, crash to desktop on pc with no reconnect, broken overkill, non functioning squelch, and a broken new legendary mechanic.
---
I like dragons

I'm not gonna lie this is getting to the point of being quite ridiculous. People were willing to wait nearly a month for you to announce an update, which when acknowledged came after another 2 weeks, and it's still riddled with bugs. We as a community understand this isn't an easy task with so many different devices but it's not as if you are a small indie company. From your own earnings \[report\](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45088-activision-blizzard-q2-2019-earnings-call/) Blizzard made $384m in net revenue just in Q2 of 2019 alone. This gets to a point where mobile users have already missed out on a month's worth of content- with no compensation- and yet you still can't get the next update right. I'm sure I don't just speak for myself when I say we have been more than patient with you as a company and a developer. I implore you to further test your updates before releasing them as it seams this is not being done to a high enough standard as many people are reporting. I love the games your company creates although recently it seams things are getting rushed through for reasons I probably can't begin to understand but it seams to not be the way forward. Please take your time to get this right as I'm sure many people would rather wait an extra few days for development testing rather than getting our hopes up only to find the update is just as bad- if not worse- than the last, and the waiting game begins all over again.

seems like overkill is broke
---
Actually it launched on both

Believe it or not it got even crazier, my opponent was able to get a Spirit of the Dead train going and I was able to combine Reno + High Priest Thekal+ Amara to set my health to 69. Probably would have hit the turn timer in a bit.
---
I like this actually, i actually hope the text is wrong and the functionality is correct.
---
the new battleground mode seems pretty fun!
---
once again a patch messed up gold cards.  each deck that you have gold cards in you need to remove the highlighted one from your deck and re add it

The game is completely unplayable without the squelch function.

Ah alright. I thought I was really dumb for a moment.

The auto battle system seems like a weird take for hearth. Has anyone tried it yet and enjoyed it?

The recent patch broke overkill hopefully it gets fixed fast

Better odds than the lottery, why not.

You’re paying $10 for a picture

Yeah I think they need to up the time between rounds for the sake of mobile because right now it's pretty bad. I had one game so far and missed out on a lot of plays I didn't have time to do everything I wanted most rounds after the midgame.
---
Add some paragraphs and it will make it much easier to read.
---
Why would blizzard want us to have less gold ur so unreasonably bitter
---
BEEP!

I know, he was/is the Battlegrounds master and was going to be an auto-pick from me... Now I actually have to *think* about my choice.

Well it is autochess for the casual hearthstone players. Learning TFT still takes at least 15h I would say until you know all heroes/items and can really adapt on the fly. 
---
This game you can pretty much play pretty good in your 2. game I would say. 
---
It doesn't look like something I would play a lot but since I don't need to invest a lot of time to learn stuff I am happy to play a couple of games here and there.
---
Yay. Now make a purchasable hero for the other 6 classes already, Blizzard.
---
Couldn’t hurt to try uninstalling and reinstalling it. The account will keep your progress just fine so you won’t lose that.
---
That or maybe send up a ticket on the forums for support?

On mobile can log into the collection, oick the deck, hit done, repeat.  Decks auto telling for me after a couple times.  Just annoying to do it repetitively.  May be a quicker fix for some people.

My sound is broken. There's *some* music and sound effects, like the main menu, background music, and "job's done", but critical effects like the hero voice lines, minion lines, emotes, matchmaking elevator music, etc are all missing. It's extremely jarring and makes the game borderline unplayable.

You don't need to be upset that you missed out
---
I know it has to do with today’s patch, I meant that the cards that went missing were all cards added back into standard with the wild event.
---
They are a publicly traded company who is responsible to the wishes of their share holders. Of course they would prioritize money over morals. 
---
Why are you calling Blizzard out over this? Have you not seen the list of companies who have chosen profit over morals (all companies). Or the list of companies who have placated to China in the name of profit? Note: These companies make almost everything you use daily.
---
If you want to make a stand make a stand against American companies. Pretending Blizzard is the only company who does these things is ignorant.
---
Putting a number on how poorly you are playing is very demotivating. Even if you don’t care about doing well.
---
I'm not spending any money on the new set so this would be a nice boost!
---
what style would you prefer, elmer's or gorilla
---
Or Blizzard rewarding early adopters with a bonus. There's more than one way to interpret that choice.
---
While there is a ranked mode, I doubt it'll really carry over into the open beta and it definitely won't matter by Battlegrounds' full release.

omg this sub has a fetish for tournament mode. they said that they will NOT make a tournament mode, and people are still shocked when they don't make a tournament mode. they are not going to make it. they said they are not going to make it. why are you still expecting it? why are you saying "we still don't have a tournament mode"? we will not have a tournament mode as long as they openly say that they won't make it

Also no matter how you choose to reroll it is still undoubtedly a reduction in gold. Especially with spectate, play a friend and all of the solo content quests, there are a good number of better ones.

---
Thanks for the chance! :)

Joke's on you, I can't even update.. wait a second.

What a legendary stream

Thank you

Pretty much. Its also ironic when they are getting rid of the easiest quests all together. You could get the divine, combo, etc done in a single game easy regardless of outcome.
---

Same happened to me, I opened hearthstone couple minutes ago and my warlock decks was missing half of cards, but it's not like they gone, they just got deleted from deck
---
I had a lot of fun playing battlegrounds. I’d say worth it, but in a huge fan of dragons so it’s a win win for me

No don’t give out my khadgar. I saved a panda you should at least have to do that too

Definitely keen!
---
If anything i guess there's like one big test suite that either gets manually started and takes too long so nobody bothers, or tests are long outdated and get progressively ignored, because nobody wants to fix them. That or there just are no tests, i've seen each of these scenarios.

Not sure which team to pick ughhhhh.

That is fixable by just opening the deck in the collection.

Grats! Hunter was my first too, still love the simple golden Rexxar. I'm very close on Shaman, will probably finish that this Weekend.
---
I would honestly cry
---
glggl!
---
I like it quite a bit it's super addictive but I really feel there's not enough cards in the mode at the moment. It's really not a classic autobattler especially when it comes down to economy and the number of units, you can fill your board very quickly and the strategies are always about the same. Stack a bunch of divine shield, try to get a few poisonous, get a hyena, junkbot or cheese your demon snowballing and get your way to victory.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also most of the snowball units are low rarity ones whereas the high rarity ones are very often simply useless.
---
And there's a bit of an issue with board space and deathrattles summoning stuff, it just feels wrong at times.
---
And many hero powers are really bad while others can win you the game, it's a bit stupid.
---
But it really has a lot of potential!
---
Nice! And the steady shot :)
---
Good luck with Shaman!

Some say ancient "new" hieroglyphs have been found on those tablets, even though there were multiple of the same type around with piles of dust nearby.

I dont think her gender is as much of a problem as her nationality right now.  
---
With China being at the center of the huge scandal that hit HS just weeks ago.
---
Let alone China being one of the most terrible, murderous regimes in the world which doesnt matter to FIFA, Olympics Committee, companies and many gamers as long as they get their money / entertainment.

Pretty much, the only time they succeeded stealing another idea was OW

Woohoo made it in time. Hope I win!

Just check him out on it, I agree he sucks

This is exactly what happened to me

Good luck to everyone!

For a simple comment on the frequency of cards which are outside of the typical hearthstone experience for standard players?
---
I didn't realise a simple statement of opinion would be so negatively received.

He doesn't, but thralls totems are making shooting fire, screaming curse words at people and splashing everything making a lot of sound. So the Thing from below awakened, following the crazy noises Thrall is making. The more noise, the faster he comes...

well 6 days before open beta if im not wrong it will only be there for a week

Imma guess that's "wanna challenge for 80g" xD

Okay, I’m in!

---
Hiiiiii
---
Pick me!
---
yes, it is open to everyone then
---
Yep. Got stuck at the Inn doors when I tried logging on this morning on mobile (worked just fine post-patch yesterday) so I tried reinstalling. Now this is all I get when I open the game after the initial small Play store download.

hi mom

I would have gotten Deathwing instantly if I didn't already have the 1000 Win Warrior, oh well

I'm afraid to click on that.

i tried it with the new legendary that hey gave us today and its pretty good! its a really fun deck
---
Do You Have Kurwa problem , i'm NOT fucking french guy bitch

it works, i wouldnt say fine. my tutorial battlegroups i got locked into the "press this to refresh minions" tip. had to kill it then couldnt get back in until i used my PC. iPad would just say "reconnecting" and never would
---
LG v20 works fine with it ***provided I can log into fuckin hearthstone in the first place*** which I can't
---
I mean it just doesn’t distract me or anything I guess I don’t mind it. Plus it doesn’t happen very often
---
it's actually gef
---
I don't deny that.
---
No it makes it easier and more accessible especially for new and casual players
---
Thats a terrible strategy IMO. It makes people who paid full price feel lime the co mpanie is devaluing their purchase. fortnite had a good way to handle this - when they put some shop skins on Sale it was a limited time bundle that actually decreased in price if you owned part of the bundle.
---
Missing quests PLUS not able to reroll them. Happened to both me and my GF. Hoping for some sort of compensation, this is unacceptable.
---
The hero power animation is too simple(and has a wierd delay), the lines is not impressive (the best one is when you surrender)
---
Actually cut blizzard some slack they are JUST starting out. Not 20 years of development

worth a shot for Deathwing

Anyone know if this a bug, or by design? I didn't hear any announcements

Auto chess is garbage and we should invade blizzard hq and slap everyone we can find who is in charge.

so what?

enjoy
---
It opens now, but you can't reroll quests, or squelch opponents and have to endure BM.

Never saw this before. That does look like a blast. Is the choice random?

surprisingly mine update on mobile was only 200 MB (+40 from good play)

Mobile hearthstone hadnt worked for months already for me. I hadn't been able to log in on mobile since the Dalaran Heist went live.
---
Patchwerk is described as a "he" even in the English version.
---
Shudderwock is more difficult. It's referred to as "it" in English. The German name being clearly male isn't just a language thing though, that's not the translators deciding to go with a "generic male form" or anything like that. They could have taken a female form, they also could have decided to intentionally go for a non-gendered name. It's not the translators deciding which gender cards or heroes have. "Der Grauselhurz" could have also been "Das Grauselhurz" or just "Grauselhurz" without any article.
---
I feel lucky.
---
&gt; It's not an auto battler
---
Oh, it just has the same 'draft' system, 8 players, is called 'BATTLEgrounds', has the same 'upgrading' system for getting multiple copies of the same unit, has the same 'unit tier' system, has re-rolling and freezing units, has a way to 'level up' your draft pool, and your units automatically fight.
---
It's not an auto battler though.
---
This is definitely an issue related to the Travel Document policy. And it is an issue related to cost-profit balance as well. Every thing in a “System”are interrelated and work in synergy. Under the GM system, we got GM \GM qualifiers \tournament. No one could deny it is Pro-Europe/ America as the locations of the finals are always set in EU/USA. Chinese Taipei/Chinese Hongkong have prestige in TD so that visas is no problem. Netease simply wants to breed a system which is good for selecting the best hearthstone players as well as fostering the growing ones in China with a simple but efficient way——providing low-cost tournaments and a level-up tunnel with lower language barriers. It just doesn’t need to be the exact same system when the situation does not suit. Travelling within China is relatively much cheaper than travelling around the world ,right? Not to mention the visa applying fee is just too absurd comparing with the expected potential winner’s prizes. Please see things as a whole.

Hello. Choose me

Does this count as a comment?
---
KEKW took over and it needs a nerf
---
I can assure you of one thing, this mode was not created for fun. It was created to draw in new users and bring back old ones.
---
Yes please
---
Not just wild. Decks in general,yes.
---
It's a temporary glitch though. Goes away if you open the deck in collection.
---
With one simple trick...
---
Devs hate him!
---
So... I'm replying to this post.
---
yeah it seems it is working now, but it wasn't for a couple of hours this morning
---
I played an arena game today, someone called and the game crashed. After the game loaded only on the second try, I missed the whole turn and lost because of it. Nice.
---
Hearthstone is really fuked up right now after that update. When i logged in some of my decks had their wild cards replaced with standart cards some decks remained with the wild cards and some showed that cards are missing in the deck and yet other decks showed they have like 31- 32 cards by default. For some reason it allowed me to put more than 30 cards in my deck. So as any sane person would do i added all of them.
---
I'm in!
---
Same. Just logged in for first time today, about 30 min ago. Got 2 dailies today, actually — I suppose one for today and one for yesterday? But neither quest has the re-roll button.
---
This is a load of bullshit. Nothing is stopping Netease from running qualifiers in a way that mirrors what the rest of the world is doing.
---
Good Luck!
---
Your opinion is trash, and if this really bothers you play a different game. It’s garbage like you why Jaina got nerfed.
---
Most definitely a bug, since it doesn't make sense for non battleground beta players to get this quest and not be able to reroll it.
---
Rolllll out
---
Maybe one time ...
---
We need packs!
---
Yes, excatly. Why did they choose my brother Nefarian instead of me?
---
I am one hot dragon. How could you possibly exclude me blizz?
---
That makes a lot of sense. 
---
Maybe it didn’t get scrapped, but messed up. Remember how most of the alt heroes had their HP animations jacked up for awhile, after being released? Lunara used the base Druid animation for awhile before they made it show the flowers.
---
game is up
---
Good luck
---
I think a Mech/Almalgam strategy is just the most reliable, not the outright strongest.
---
it me ur brother send free packs pls
---
Hm? Do you think i have hacked something or what. WDYM?
---
F
---
for all the times rng lost me games in hearthstone, this is where it all comes back. trust

did it let you play game? :p

Why not

Are you sure you’re thinking about Kadghar and not Brann Bronzebeard?

I think they should have gone with [[Stormwind Knight]] and [[Kor'kron Elite]]. These two cards represent both factions of WoW--and they can't kill each other on the first attack.

Yes. When you for example get an overkill with the 7/7 beast, it will spawn a 5/5, gets buffed to 10/10, khadgar makes a copy and mama bear gives it an additional +5/+5, for a total of 25/25 stats in play. Pretty nuts.

Oh also I have 57 percent on infinite druid, a deck that isn't even top tier so I think I'll be fine

I meah HoTS is a very simplified version of LoL (Which is a very simplified version of DotA2), HS is a very simplified version of MTG, WoW is a very simplified version of EQ, noticing a pattern here?
---
It looks like this is the "new quests" - which appears to mean completely new and those that had the thresholds, goals, or reward amount changed. Is this a complete list of quests, or just the new/changed ones? 
---
This morning I got a Total Dominance quest (100g) which is not on this list - so not sure if I didn't have the patch yet and got that, or what the story is.
---
Beasts seem to have a big power up in the late game from what I've seen - Mama Bear being insane is a big deal there, and mech doesn't have *quite* an equivalent for that from what I've seen.
---
However, mechs do have the bonuses you mentioned, and may be more consistent. Multi-tribe seems 'viable' in the sense that nightmare amalgalm can get all the bonuses even if slotted into a one-tribe one. Though I've heard that there's selected minions that can make multi-tribe very good - namely, if your 1 beast is the cave hydra and/or your 1 mech is foe reaper, they're great buff targets.
---
It'll be interesting to see how it evolves. Not sure how good Demons and Murlocs are, as compared to Beasts/Mechs they seem to be at least somewhat lacking
---
JRuss#11794, EU, 80g quest exchange. I'll show then you go first.
---
If it's for a class that you have a harder time completing the quest for (for me warrior and paladin). 
---
Sometimes I do it just for the chance at a pack or 80-100g quest, but mostly for point A.
---
Those are both cards everyone already has for free.
---
You think they should give out cards that are free?
---
They are, just not as part of this anniversary event.
---
You're being intentionally dense. Every hero you listed is implied to male through design. Arguing about who is "technically biologically male or not"  completely misses the mark, and let's be real, you already know this.
---
Naxxramus had to be bought too though didn't it? So buying adventures isn't exactly new.
---
I love how they screw basic features up which are already there for years. They code base must be horrible.
---
well that's new.
---
QA team suffered layoffs
---
 A copy in play, deck, hand AND collection!
---
I had 8-10 going all afternoon through the evening. Never saw or heard about anyone getting a "drop".
---
I didnt play this summer and just started again about a week ago. I heard arena was broken, but I've been crushing that. I'm assuming standard play is what is broken? I'm still working my way back down (I'm lvl 7-8). 
---
I dont give them money anyway. I'm not against it (if the game is working fairly). I just prefer arena.
---
&gt;Then why doesn't the voice not just sound female when heard through mortal ears?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Why, when trying to build a genderless creature, and when then confronted with having to decide on a gender for a specific minor detail of it (like choosing a voice actor), Blizzard falls back as a male one as the standard, intentionally or unconsciously? 
---
Humans are a pretty sexually dimorphic species. It's going to be hard to find a professional voice actor that can pull off a gender ambiguous voice.
---
Given the character of all the old gods as dark, massive, uncaring, ruthless monsters, it would be hard to give them a female sounding voice that can properly convey all of those
---
Plus, I believe the Naarru, the beings opposed to the Old Gods in the cosmological hierarchy of Warcraft, are at least mostly voiced by women.
---
&gt;Why do all the non-gendered things "randomly" just happen to sound male? 
---
The sort of characteristics Blizzard writers want character like Ragnaros, The Curator, and the Old Gods to have are perhaps generally expressed better by male voice actors.
---
[Original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpHSm0KcW7o)
---
What the heck did you guys do to introduce so many regression issues?  Your QA team needs a new process.
---
bruh
---
I have one. I like to play off Meta or more control
---
“You stand before King Rastakhan!”
---
I don't have any wild cards
---
Having the same issue.... yay for blizzard QA
---
Maybe some dragon related hero power that got scrapped?
---
Stats behind a pay gate every expansion? Man if this continues not only is RIOT going to win the auto chess battle by default but they’re also going to take over the digital card game industry.
---
Stomped because you didn't pay $50 or stomped because others watched videos that you also have access to? Which is it?
---
What's Jaraxxus's hero power?
---
Who's gonna bet that they'll balance this just once, *maybe* twice per expansion?
---
you're lucky you at least get a reconnect.  most of the time it forgets i was in a game by the time i can log back in.
---
also, check your email ffs
---
With how often you're offered malganis, the self harm from demons is a non-issue.
---
I'd suggest asking this question in /r/wildhearthstone
---
At least Overwatch is completely unique!
---
&gt; Good video game mechanics are mechanics that add depth to the game and broaden the game's horizons. Add new layers of interactivity between the player and the video game. Rewards good players over bad players. Allows the player to turn their experience more unique by allowing them to express themselves in the way that they play.
---
Based on what? Again, you’re just *claiming* things. Let’s take Tetris for example. Tetris is generally regarded as one of the most sublimely designed video games ever made, and it has no element within it that either “adds depth” or “broadens the horizons” of itself. It is decidedly simple. Any attempts to further the “horizons” are generally derided as a mistake, with the most common wish from long time fans being to just have freely available ports of the NES version on new systems. 
---
It of course has no other of the characteristics of which you put forth as the sole objective hallmarks of some arbitrary conception of “good game design” that you’ve invented for yourself. You can’t just keep typing “chaos engine” like that means anything.
---
80, no?
---
I've probably opened over 100 only with my daily gold for Uldum alone
---
I swore the last time I preordered would be the last..... then Deathwing came.
---
Less gold is easier for newer player? How much of an idiot are you?
---
It is an intentional decision for the reason you mentioned, and they’ve explained this multiple times.
---
The only people inconvenienced by the inconsistent use of keywords are deck builders in Wild who, for example, may want to search for all Inspire cards. But that’s solved with some database management, and it should be trivial to include these cards when a keyword is searched.
---
Other than the art assets, what elements do you think it took from Hearthstone rather than from the autochess category in general?
---
How come it's always the most uninformed people who have the strongest opinions...
---
That's no excuse, you only have to hover over the card the one time to see what inspire means.
---
Innervate, Innervate, Coin.
---
Emote trash talkers will rein supreme.
---
Lol autochess without items and alliances and grids and now they also want to you buy packs. I am glad I didn't pre-order.
---
Zero winrate deck
---
Does anyone know, will they be adding other cards in battleground mode in the future or we’ll only have 91 we have now?
---
Yes, I am pretty sure you can. The function is available on the app for the iPad. I also believe most iPads come with 2gb ram, but look up the specs on your iPad. iPads can run games that are much heavier than hearthstone, so I would be surprised if it couldn't.
---
Clubpoke#1920 80g quest NA
---
That’s 10,000 gold.
---
wow didn't know other wallstreetbet redditors were on this sub
---
Nice, another non interractive, boring deck for you to climb with
---
Nice! Good to know someone got it.
---
Thanks u/ainteverlucky 
---
  
---
IMO this is not a very fun Tavern Brawl. It just murlocs all the time, and a Murloc shaman deck is already a popular deck in the meta. You are incentivized to pick either Shaman or Paladin.   
---
Fun for one game to get a pack, not much else.   
---
I like the Tavern Brawls where you build your own deck or get some super cool ones. Some that are super RNG **can be** fun sometimes too.
---
Fuckin owls have invaded reddit
---
Lol the fact that you're that proud of hitting legend with evolve shaman goes to show truly how much of a scrublord you really are. Literally every time you talk it's more pathetic.
---
I completed this by playing with a friend
---
They've been riding on perfect visual design and a great concept all this time.
---
Depending on the effect, it can be very strong.  But on its own, a minion with a trigger of "after you use a hero power" is on the weaker side compared to other activation conditions. Minions in Hearthstone typically have a lifespan of 1 to 3 turns total. So with triggered effects, normally you try to play them at the right moment so you can trigger them many times in a single turn before your opponent can react. But you can only activate your hero power once a turn. So the value you get out of Inspire is tied to the lifespan, which is going to correlate with who better controls the board. You only get more than 1 trigger if your opponent can't kill it. If you can't afford the 2 mana immediately, you may not even get any effect at all. Inspire is generally bad if you're losing and win-more if you're winning.
---
I have never squelched anyone, but this is kinda dumb blizz
---
You’re thinking of the sunken cost fallacy, although I’m sure gamblers fallacy comes in too when buying packs.
---
Playing my last Holy Wrath in 20 card deck hoping to hit Shirvallah is within my Personal Risk Tolerance.
---
Hey u/robstersgaming, try closing the app and restarting it. That might do the trick. Good luck!
---
Was taken down to 3 HP but ended up getting 3 straight gentle megasaur on my way to winning 9 straight rounds for the win.
---
Guess u will be running fairie dragons for now
---
Turns out I had a glitched copy of a card that I don’t even have removed it it fixed
---
Get a bathroom PC you coward
---
Thanks can, hopefully I can get one
---
The animations are excruciatingly slow. Like 3 fps towards the end on my new iPad (not PRO). Rendered tavern unusable. Fine on computer though, fun mode imo.
---
Im not saying give it more reward. Im saying give it comparable reward too what already exists. Playing 3 hours of Battlegrounds should net the same amount of gold as Ladder.
---
Demand? Jesus you're a little child, even by this subreddit's already ridiculously low standards
---
Are you cool with companies that support the US then?
---
Dude, you literally wrote in title "Battlegrounds should reward 30 gold If you make top4"
---
This. I’ve accidentally crashed my game like 8 times today because of the habit of auto squelching lol
---
No worries, I was just saying that it didn't have anything to do with the missing cards bug, because it never happened to me and this one did.
---
Rogue Opponent spammed "I will be your death!" like 20 times on my last game...

All I was saying is that the motive for creating it was to make money. The passion and fun of developing it was a secondary or additional bonus. If it was tedious and the people hated developing it, it still would have been developed.
---
Hearthstone is not yet released on PlayStation.
---
I know. I read through both two or three times now, and in neither, unless you're assuming the mods are mean, evil people for banning you because you started calling them exactly what they said they weren't going to tolerate, did they claim to be the true heir to the prophet Mohammed and the second coming of Jesus.
---
Masturbates Viciously!  
---
So sad they don't call it inspire this time :/
---
This shouldn't be an issue - Mike Donais said on Kibler's stream that they have a balance &amp; tweak patch coming out a week after Battlegrounds releases (probably the real release, not alpha/beta, but still).
---
You'll get access to Battlegrounds in less than a week. Not having triplicate epic protection makes preordering feel terrible. Save your gold.
---
Yeah, seriously, they must have a ton of data about evolve shaman by now, it’s ridiculous that they haven’t nerfed it already. As a side note, I also hope they do something about secret mage in wild as well, that deck is even more disgusting.
---
 you actually get 3,33  gold, not 10. (It's counted a victory and it gives you 10 gold for 3 wins, not 1)
---
Every tribe strat is broken if you get the right cards, and all of them work with Amalgam, that's why it's so good. I've won with Mechs, Demons, Beast, and Murloc Mech hybrid in my few games, and all of them involved it as a 'joker' of sorts, to get poisonous with all the mech buffs etc.
---
By that logic, nothing should ever change price.
---
Old stuff products for sale can get cheaper over time, this isn't a new concept.
---
Money money money. I see what you like.
---
I agree with you completely. If people can’t take 5 seconds to learn an important mechanic by simply hovering over and reading what certain keywords do, then maybe video games aren’t for them haha I know ultimately this isn’t that big of a deal whether they keep keywords or do this shit but I’m definitely in favor of reusing old keywords. Don’t know what a keyword means? Take 5 seconds to fucking look it up. edit: because Wild is a thing - this is why I don’t see reusing  old keywords is a bad thing.
---
I've gone wild with Amalgam strategies before. My most recent win was a Patchwerk game where I picked up an Amalgam and one strong minion from each tribe (Cave Hydra and Foe-Reaper were winners) and just leaned on battlecry buffs, Brann Bronzebeard, and Lightfangs.
---
Come on guys, yes it's a clusterfuck but this is just some small indie company. Most of their time is spent making needless art changes.
---
Magic Online.
---
Who the hell uses squelch?
---
Don’t don it!!!!
---
The worst thing, in my opinion, about their abandonment of keywords that aren't the signature mechanic of the set, is that it really seems like it sets a precedent that makes it basically impossible to make any complicated cards.
---
Will we ever get a minion with echo and inspire? Probably not, because it would have to say "Repeatable this turn. After you use your hero power, do X." and now we're already bumping up against the limit of what can apparently be written on the card. We're largely going to see single mechanics with variations in cost and stats which is incredibly boring.
---
And the lack of willingness to nest existing mechanics says to me that they're not interested in generating variety in gameplay through a predictable but complex way, so they're going to continue to do it through woAH sO rAndoM methods.
---
It's on Blizzard's policy to adress issues with 8-12 months delay.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, multi-tribe strategy is great if you hit Lightfang. You get +8/+8 in stats every turn for free. +16/+16 if you have two (or upgraded one). If you start the buff train mid game and get to the late game (which Patchwerk is good for with higher health), then it's insane. Stacking over +100/+100 of stats with Lightfangs alone is not out of question.
---
Good. Fuck Big Priest. I hate it so much. So much.
---
(Unless the taunt minions attack and health when multiplied together form a prime number )
---
To be totally honest your points are the worst most opinionated points i've ever seen in my life lol. For the record you can't just think something sucks because it doesn't appeal to you, well because it's just that, it doesnt appeal to YOU lol.
---
The more i read your post the more i see how troll it is. You don't like that theres mech and murlocs in the game because of your past experience being unable to beat those tribal decks in a totally different game mode, yup makes sense.
---
You clearly didn't pay attention to the tutorial cause both of your horrible points are explained. The tavern system is well explained in the tutorial, and even if it's not ... because one mechanic isn't properly explained it makes the game dumb? again, yup makes sense. (good luck playing tft or underlords)
---
combining 3 of a kind feels lackluster? If you time you combines right and upgrade your tavern around them you can get access to discovering a minion 2 tiers higher than your initial tavern tier. 
---
Before you knock on something, learn the game and stop posting stupid troll posts that someone might stumble upon and actually believe you...
---
Well considering you can evolve it into a 12/12 after the expansion comes out I’d hope they keep an eye on it. Jesus Christ, I love blizzard and their games but they can really seem incompetent about some obvious problems.
---
I mean preorder and you can Play it.
---
didn't see that shit anywhere, ok cool, I officially quit hearthstone. This game is trash. Why the fuck should anyone put any time into a game about collecting when they just change the meta and fuck everything up? I don't craft cards right now because I know the event is going to end, and the cards wont be as good after the event. And OH BOY a new set of cards to buy right after the event, COOL. And then when everyone buys those cards, theyll do another stupid event like this one.
---
Fuck you blizzard. You are a shit company, I couldn't imagine being an overwatch or warcraft player.
---
So a two card combo that potentially also acts as removal(due to Rush) that on average gives you a very strong minion in the early turns and has a chance to give you 12/12, sometimes straight up winning the game. Yeah I really don't see the problem. /s
---
Me every game because it's annoying
---
Two birds with one stone, it also kills off Holy Wrath Paladin.
---
Lastly, it adds some really sweet interactions with banker and bouncers.
---
However, it'd add some funky interactions given that trades would let it evolve into varying costs.
---
Not sure if this applies to you but I had to update my phone OS before the game showed that I needed an update..
---
Unfortunately, I don’t think they see that as an “issue”...
---
Hearthstone is probably going to retcon them as the missing link between proto-dragons and dragons.
---
Just proves there's elitism in everything.
---
i think this was one of the best event because sgaking up the meta is a good thing it prevents making the game stale
---
Blizzard does a ton of shitty design decisions but this one makes sense. The average new player is waaaay more casual than you think. I've heard a surprisingly high % of new players to most mmos quit before even moving their character for 5 minutes. They literally log in, get an instant impression, and just log off.
---
If there's basically any perceived complexity when the average new player picks up the game and looks at the screen, many just delete the app. That includes something as simple and easy as this.
---
Very much worth it this time around compared to previous bundle pre orders. As everyone said, apart from it being the best value than it ever has before you get a weeks early access to Battlegrounds which is incentive enough for me. Also as everyone said it’s worth it if you do play a lot.
---
JFC it's a problem now.  Here's some free advice you dopes, just give Mogu Fleshshaper "Can't be targeted" so Mutate is out.  Witchy Lackey still sucks but that's 1 more mana so it probably happens later than Turn 4.
---
I don't get the first sentence.
---
Most of what?
---
because I'm talking only about Hearthstone so sentence *Most of Hearthstone parts offer far more than Hearthstone * makes no sensd
---
Cause when its used enough, the tradeoff is worth it. Copying my other comment:  
---
 
---
THIS
---
SERIOUSLY HALF THE SUBREDDIT NEEDS TO READ THIS
---
That's the problem - they literally only care about new players, not the old ones.
---
They want a new person to join and spend money. Once that's over and done with, you are officially forgotten and sent to the backburner, nearly expected to buy each and every new expansion as if it's a given.
---
New players walk that path and fill their needs, but since they always want more money, new players and new player experience in general is what will always win from their point of view. I mean just look at Ranked Floors change that happened, when was it, over a year ago.
---
And it's always that stupidly derogatory reasoning that it might confuse new players - well I don't give a shit and would like to have every Inspire effect have a **bolded Inspire** written on the damned card, and the same goes for every other such effect in the game, for consistency's sake.
---
This was pretty funny idk why y'all are downvoting him
---
ITT: whiny children
---
10/10 would love to see blizzard nest mechanics other than battlecry and deathrattle.
---
There has been a negativity circlejerk on this sub for a while. Some of it is justified for sure,  but things are still being a bit overblown in my opinion.
---
I've played a couple of games so far and they just felt boring really just has a feeling of being a tavern brawl and not something totally new and fresh.
---
Deck link please
---
Calling HoF now. I don't see how a nerf wouldn't tank this card design completely. Craft golden copies for full dust stonks!
---
Only my Druid deck is having this issue, rest of my decks work fine. Any idea what’s going on?
---
Uninstall-Reinstall and let it download all latest game data
---
I am an iOS user experiencing none of these issues. Are you on an android operating system ?
---
Have you watched auto battlers before? Its basically the same for all of them. "Oh i haven't faced this guy in 5 rounds, wonder what he had?" get wrekt or utterly destroy.
---
Nothing important.
---
I never said an autobattler takes more skill than a TCG.  I said this game mode is less RNG dependent than ladder which is my opinion based on watching and listening to Kripp.  His rank does matter because his skill was allowing him to place higher on average and climb to the top meaning RNG was not impacting him as much.  And autobattlers don't have tournaments yet because they are what like a year old at this point?  Look dude I was just stating my opinion, don't let it get your panties in a bunch.
---
Hmm. I haven’t seen this! I must say though, I’m glad they finally included a visual to let us know before heading into ladder that 80% of decks that were viable a month ago simply can’t be played anymore. Surely that will save some frustration for newer players who would otherwise be wondering why their entire card collection (for those among them without Shaman cards) is worthless until *Descent of Dragons* releases.
---
Woah. That's pretty low for a hard cap. Brann into Benedictus can already go over it with a bit of mana ramp/discount.
---
There is a bug on that right now, the squelch doesn't work, they are aware of this, afaik
---
Agreed, also spells somehow. I’m sure they’ll add more
---
Though you definitely seem to have a more negative opinion on this game mode than I do, I find myself agreeing with many of the points you are making.
---
The main issue for me is the level of RNG. As you rightly mentioned, the hero(?) you play is not really your choice, but basically "Discover a random hero". Then you get to buy minions that are randomly generated, and yeah you can reroll a bunch of times in an effort to find the ones that will work for you, but it is a bit of a crapshoot nonetheless. Worst of all is the fact that minions attack randomly. (I saw someone call it a "Mass Hysteria Simulator that respects taunts" and boy is that painfully accurate. I feel like I'm constantly just playing dice in every stage of this game mode, hoping to roll whatever constitutes a good number for me. I recognize randomness is part of a lot of card games, but in this particular game mode it is excessive.
---
Honestly, regular Hearthstone has lately had too high of an RNG factor for my taste already. But at least I can build my own deck the way I want to so I have a certain feeling of agency, and I feel somewhat in control of the game, but in this Battlegrounds mode I lack even that.
---
One spark of hope I do see is things like that Zap card, whatever it is called, that attacks the lowest attack minion. It is a rare moment of being able to influence what my minions do (besides taunt) that made combat ever so slightly more interesting. If there is opportunity to strategize a bit more besides the "make a giant poisonous divine shield taunt" or "all of the amalgams" this game mode might become a bit more interesting.
---
How many meta decks can u play? And u have no missing cards for the meta decks? Are u f2p? If u r how?
---
It's 100% by design. Hearthstone has always focused on making elegant and simple card designs rather than complex ones. It's a tradeoff that keeps the game easy to get into/get back into rather than giving the game much depth (although the game has certainly gotten better at getting more complexity into card design in recent years). This type of design makes it so that no card takes particularly long to understand at a glance, which is a level of accessibility most other ccgs don't have. I'm not digging on complex games like MTG, they certainly have their place, it's just not what I think HS is going for.
---
Yup
---
It allows them into the auto battler space without devoting too many resources to making a new game altogether. A HotS auto battler could’ve been more fleshed out but it wouldn’t have been ready so soon. They’re shoving a round peg into a square hole with this one and it kinda fits but it’s not perfect. I’m enjoying it and I’m excited to see how they support this moving forward.
---
This patch I can't even reroll quests at all.
---
Search function.
---
I am not good at this mode. Then again I only tried three times and managed 4th the last time, but I feel like I am making terrible decisions. You probably need to play this mode several dozen times to get a good feel which is rather time consuming.
---
It sounds like something Blizzard would do
---
Not always the case. There are multiple reason for a crash but in blizzard case probably said we just wont let it open at all.
---
Pay to beta test for them and then they fuck over their regular game in the process.  
---
I'm fast losing even more  faith in these clowns.
---
...The player numbers have consistently dropped since beta, Witchwood was the start of a steeper drop which is still continuing.
---
There was a second part of that. He is LUCKY. People are NOT exaggerating. Us people that aren’t having these problems want to know exactly how bad it is. Is mobile literally unplayable for the majority? Or just a small handful of people?
---
Fuck that noise. I reroll any quest that I don't want to do. No matter the reward or how easy it is.
---
Dammit you got me, also you’re quick
---
well with that mindset i'm gonna go for it, is just money that im gonna waste in another game, so im gonna take the risk, and if i regret the preorder, i'm just not gonna pre order again like u say
---
Then it means it's a problem with phone compatability most likely.  
---
Software is complex and complicated
---
It would make too much sense to give us the option after 5 years of asking for it. They never will.
---
Better late than never?  
---
Won't matter with their spray and pray overly powerful expansion anyway.
---
Exactly what I'm doing

Check ur mail dawg
---
Battlecry: Give a friendly minion "Inspire: Add a random spell to your hand. Give it echo."
---
Imagine the clusterfuck in current wording this would be.
---
Combo will be:
---
•Play Jepetto for a 1 mana Malygos + Sathrovarr. 
---
•Play the Malygos next turn, then play Sathrovarr on the Malygos to get a second Malygos on board and in hand. 
---
•Then play Eureka for the third Malygos. Ez +15 spell damage on board.
---
You still have 2 mana left for the damage spells. Fire away.
---
In other words the same as almost every other game in existence. There is always a steady but slight trend downward in the player base.
---
I will never understand their logic. Probably because there is none.  
---
\*and if there is a hidden meaning, it most likely has to do with $$$
---
There are 3 legendary quests coming that will give you DoD packs and u could get packs by pre-ordering as well
---
