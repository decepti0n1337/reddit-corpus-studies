WAIT I THINK I MAY HAVE ALSO THOUGHT THAT AT FIRST WTF
---
Good Bot
---
This is easily the least fun i've had playing the tavern brawl.
---

---
Really outdid yourselves this time blizzard
---
I‚Äôm unable to at work, but it should be easy to find in Iksar‚Äôs tweets and replies. He only tweeted this in the last day or two.
---
I play on an IPhone XS Max and I‚Äôve experienced one crash and that‚Äôs about it everything‚Äôs been working stellar
---
I used Bob's Bouncer against one of his two Highkeeper Ra's with a lone minion on my field. I had a 33% chance of killing both his Highkeepers, 33% chance of losing to the other Highkeeper if he survived the brawl, and a 33% chance of getting a board full of Highkeepers. Never tell me the odds!
---
Ok, thank you!
---
Enjoy all the easily won games as us samsing users are crashing all over the place.
---
I just read somewhere this is due to using the new 1000 win Portraits. I have yet to test it but I have been getting the same error.
---
Noodle nonsense
---
I though the cap was 14?
---
I used plague of murlocs on the dreadsteeds.
---
What loud out cry?  I've heard a vocal minority and one uppity streamer complain but that's about it.
---
Quests were what ruined it most for me but funny how people instead now what to cry about mana cheating because of evolve.
---
I have a OnePlus 6T and am experiencing this as well
---
Same, but I was already mostly F2P, so they won't notice. Still, I skipped buying the last single player adventure because of the controversy, and will not purchase anything further going forward.
---
This is me everytime I evolve. I've gotten 4 doomsayers once during kotf.
---
They deducted all the cards from HK players and distributed them evenly amongst the playerbase. I personally call it a win.
---
‚ÄúRex-thar‚Äù
---
I'll be honest, some of the witchwood was good but they've gotten goofier since.
---
I got to 88 and the guy conceded.
---
Yeah I'm not a fan either. Only close to Uther now so the rest I don't need to worry about for awhile haha
---
Thanks, I actually enjoyed this.
---
Shaman or Shaman, if u don't like these 2, then i recommend Shaman
---
It did for me and the counter registered the plague lord's health to be 0.
---
Oh, and I got tentacles for arms from Bob the "friendly smith"
---
I wish more people played this way. I play casual sometimes with full meme decks and some people still spam greetings when they snowball or only just scrape by sometimes but it's even better when they spam greetings with a full board and you end up crushing them anyways.
---
Oh and for me it was always Emeriss or Lady in White.
---
I'm sure there's already a lot of moaning about Shaman, but when you look at VS or HSReplay data, a Shaman deck isn't even the best deck at higher ranks. Highlander Mage/Hunter/Paladin, Tempo Rogue, and Combo Priest are all virtually as good as any Shaman deck. A few hundreths of a point in effective win rate/deck power between decks means nothing. Shaman is popular not because it is insanely overpowered but because it has three viable deck archetypes that are cheap to craft.
---
Plenty of people will also point at Evolve, but when you look at the played win rate of cards you have to go a long way down the list find it. I would estimate there are 70-80 cards with a higher played win rate than Evolve and the majority of those aren't "finisher" cards such as Bloodlust or Pyroblast that are typically used to end games. Emperor Thaurissan, Mysterious Challenger, and N'Zoth are all higher than Evolve but I don't see the pitchfork out for those cards and the classes they're played in.
---
If you have some major issue with Shaman then tech your deck against it or play one that counters it. There's always go going to be a class that's stronger then others, but that doesn't mean you don't have options against it. That's the beauty of card games.
---
How did u do it?
---
Would have been great if Blizzard unnerfed Dreadsteed and gave us this version instead. IIRC, Dreadsteed wasn‚Äôt OP or anything ‚Äî it just had an unfortunate gamebreaking interaction with Defile (and Godfrey, I guess) and this indeed fixes the problem.
---
For me it slows down baaaad whenever a big animation happens or a big swing turn like when N'Zoth or Shudderwock is played.
---
Bullshit, i was always wasting alot of dust on decks before i was always rank 20, then i just tried cheap hunter deck cost about 600 dust and got to rank 9 in a single day.
---
This just says you improved over time. Something that happened to me too. but try playing with basic and classic cards to level 9. 
---
Yes, I crafted nothing for a year. Lol
---
Also no basic or classic legendaries in the current rotation.
---
The hong kong post were a majority of people from other subreddits and didnt stay once the regulars started posting about hearthstone again
---
Nope, turn 4 evolve shaman is worse, N'zoth has bigger build up and can be out wit
---
Quest Reno is very fun (and viable) too
---
Then you never will...
---
I think they just fucked up the current Android client a bit, iOS users aren't having trouble and it works fine on my PC.
---
I don't think you can reasonably make broad sweeping conclusions from one update to one device being shit.
---
Congrats. Recently got my first too, but with Priest, because I‚Äôm a masochist.

I havent enjoyed a single quest meta yet.

Can more people post this screenshot please? I've only seen it 3 times now
---
Just out of curiosity, is there any evidence or studies done that small QoL improvements bring people back? I would expect the flashly new features and content being main drivers of people picking up the game again. QoL is something that helps keep people, but doesn't really help you attract returning or new customers
---
Just exit and reenter.
---
Oh no!
---
And no cards from 2018/19.
---
Am I the only mobile user that hasn't experienced any of this lol
---
How long can this go on?
---
Really? All I see is damn nzoth rouge
---
I‚Äôm already switching genders irl anyway üëâüòéüëâ
---
There was an Android problem with older Android versions with the same "working on it" answer when the last expansion was being promoted - especially frustrating because of the promotional event that took place during that time. Took them nearly a month to fix. I would expect about the same time for this problem.
---
That problem back then was the final nail in the coffin for me. Expansion was not that interesting for me, so I stopped playing overall after they got it working.
---
With how lazy Blizzard is I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
I guess we reached the point at which we can say Blizzard is dead, long live King Activision Master of Candy Crush and mtx.
---
Absolutely filthy
---
It stops after 14 times of "how long can this go on"
---
Really good job
---
‚ÄúWith defile *at least*‚Äù implies that it was in regards to Dreadsteed as well.

The pedants are out early today.

#WAAAHHHGGRLBLB!
---
Definitely, but losing after killing 100 counts as a win. So you win no matter what if you do the brawl as intended.
---
Well done, cheers!
---
I played faceless lurker (doubles health) four times, twilight drake (health gets a bonus from hand size) three times, heroic innkeeper (+2/+2 from every friendly), and frostwolf warlord twice.  Then the Shudderwock, who copies all previous battlecries had its battle cries doubled from heart of vir'naal.
---
Those were better times. Make that mistake and instantly lose
---
One of the most common strategies is to re-use N'Zoth at least half a dozen times, a lot of classes have that ability.  
---
I personally had several 30 mins+ games using this strategy. There's no fatigue, just endless N'zoths filling full board turn after turn.
---
I have a friend that also does infinite N‚ÄôZoths but he does it a different way. He uses two Expired Merchants to discard N‚ÄôZoth and Soulwarden. The second Soulwarden then gives you a Soulwarden and a N‚ÄôZoth ad infinitum. The rest of the deck is basically just Zoo to try and take the board early.
---
I meant the Shudderwock, had to take the screen shot before he conceded.
---
Oh dear god
---
Thank you, For your response. I‚Äôm looking to get on a university esports team
---
So I just started blasting
---
You know what, I‚Äôd run the first card you proposed in my Murloc decks. It‚Äôs a card which just like the hyena can snowball into a really big threat and that can be game winning on it‚Äôs own
---
I'm not familiar with the quality of players expected from an university team. I think the only way to find out is by going for it.
---
Haha these Hong Kongers just know how to protest classy, respect.
---
Face Collector, although it isn‚Äôt a good card I feel like he‚Äôs strong. Probably because the Witchwood Solo Adventure boss (with the same name and art) beat me so many times.
---
Murloc Fisherman
---
2 for a 2/1 
---
Battlecry: give two random friendly murlocs +1/+1

---
&gt; Indeed, you shouldn‚Äôt want us to provide your data based on such information, which other people may know about you.
---
So in other words, you think you want it, but you don't.
---
No cards are useless. Basic cards with vanilla stat lines are weak now obviously but that's not at all a bad thing. Why would people complain that cards are getting stronger? Who cares if older cards are weaker in comparison?
---
 Archmage Antonidas maybe?
---
How about primalfin? A primitive Version of a murloc
---
How do you go about doing the "Hearthstone artsyle"? What set it appart? Maybe it's because I'm not a super great artist, but while I see that and go "yeah, it's HS alright", I have no idea why.
---
Love me some Murloc RPG
---
Enjoy, and don't wear yourself out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7So-zsnU2j0
---
And is it a bad thing for people to now have further awareness that China ain't the cuddly cheap product manufacturer we once hoped could be buddy-buddy with? 
---
People live and learn, but people like you are trapped in your own little bubble thinking 'it's just how it is, fuck these protesters for ruining my valuable gaming time!!'
---
Its ~35% at ranks 4 - 1!
---
What you say definitely sounds right. 
---
If that card was still in standard though, I wonder if Blizzard would've designed the quest to work with both replace and adding? I have the feeling the only reason it doesn't work is because they don't wanna go through the hassle of reprogramming it.
---
Is it the Silverhand Recruit [death sound?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08GJQw_K5ms)
---
&gt; completely ignoring the loud outcry of the players.
---
The loud outcry of the players is often wrong and overreactionary.
---
I love how this guy rolls around defeated with boner for pessimism and asking questions with an angry tone. It's losers like you who would've stood there thinking well the Nazi's are cleansing people, nothing I can do!
---
The strong part of any deck is combinations of cards or do you think strong individual cards are scary? A 5 mana 3/3 that can duplicate! A 1/2 that gets +1/+1 with each deathrattle? Oh no! But if you want to go card by card:
---
Molten giant against aggro; mountain giant, twilight drake on a full hand, shadowflame on an 8/8 from turn 3.
---
Antonidas; Alexstrasza; 8 mana pyroblast; any of the freeze cards prior to nerf.
---
Cold blood-cold blood-leeroy- faceless; azure drake, auctioneer, oil, sap, prep.
---
Piloted shredder,Mysterious challenger, avenge, muster, quartermaster, Dr. Boom, tirion.
---
Frothing; warsong; patron, grommash, death's bite, sludge belcher, dr boom again. 
---
Undertaker, leper gnome, loot hoarder shredder are all individually meh but hearthstone isn't a game where you're playing individual cards. This deck was the most oppressive in all HS history...
---
Until they fix it /shrug
---
Team 5: "smh people play a game called ShamanStone and expect a shaman free experience."
---
[removed]
---
So youre saying A malganis on turn 5 is unfair? Every class in wild does have a mana cheating ability. Considering you have many options dealing with a malganis turn 5, or whatever else that comes out of a voidcaller, its Nothing in comparison. I guess youre one of those toxic players who are defend this gameruining deck.
---
Edit: spelling
---
It summons 7 murlocs and is preceded by that card that draws a minion and a spell and swaps their cost.
---
It tries to draw Old Murkeye, the 2/1 charges, the one that gives murlocs +2 attack. The rest of the deck is just drawing cards IIRC.
---
Here's a thread about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dhmsgt/summon_7_murlocs_on_turn_3/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=comments_view_all
---
I think that just keep both in the succubus case
---
I'm saying that once you pull a Voidlord from a Voidcaller an Aggro deck can just go and concede.
---
Look at my reply to the other guy with the same statement.
---
Every class does have mana cheating abilities. Tor mages with secrets on turn 3, crystal runners for 0 mana as mage, 25-25 mech stats on turn 4 as paladin etc.
---
A malganis on turn 4 is garbage in the wild gamemode
---
They provided a link to the place where you can get that, under "Access my data".
---
^ still got absolutely annihilated
---
DK Jaina is shit. Trailer Jaina is the best Jaina.
---
Cringe.
---
am i stupid or does it have no new cards?
---
Atleast they can keep an eye on how the game works. This is not how the game SHOULD work at all. 
---
Maybe cap the mechwarper at 1 mana?
---
You need the Sideshow Spellpricer if you want the full effect, I fear.
---
Any plans for a mac version? Thanks
---
It's really cool looking (and listening) to Kripp ten years ago.

The app was build with cross platform technologies and there are plans to bring it to Mac and Mobile. I must said that at this point we are focusing on bringing the app and platform to a high level of feature and quality first. Then we'll look into cross-planform support.
---
It does work with Parallels... Some of our devs have tested it...
---
Nah. He started the video by saying "Hey YouTube".
---
eh, if he hadn't got the world first hardcore diablo 3 kill, i don't think he would have exploded in popularity when HS was released. Not to mention he might not have gotten the invitation to Blizzcon in first place.
---
Cubelock! I deleted the official name from my mind and quitted for almost a year.
---
How is this different from botting?
---
Looks excellent.
---
Lol truth u cant even play this tavern brawl if u have it equipped small indie company is struggling
---
Jaina just need her valley visible again, but I guess Pooh doesn't appoohrove.
---
It just summons 2/2 copies that can be stopped and the quest is significantly harder since you have to play lots of bad cards. Also the guy I was replying to said that quest rewards didn't win games so I was arguing that they did. I believe we are on the same side of the issue.
---
I love his decks too but some of his plays make so little sense that I can't watch his streams without breaking my keyboard out of sheer frustration.
---
Still hell of a chill, likeable guy though. Love him to bits.
---
I guess Togwaggle signed a contract with Rakanishu and he stays inside the lamp and being sealed underground, in the dalaran heist, he can get out of the lamp and he was much larger than he was underground. In SoU he has a crown and he has grown muscles. I believe that he is the last plague lord of flame.

I just don‚Äôt get the appeal people have of just copy and pasting deck codes and playing those decks without making any changes ever... what‚Äôs the point of playing this sort of game if you‚Äôre never going to tinker around with anything?

Personally I actually like the meta right now, I‚Äôm constantly going up against quirky and unique decks and not the usual 4-5 variations that just beat everything that people just copy and pasted online.
