If a $60 paywall to new players along with still needing to open cards from various sets is the “value of this once great game,” then I’m glad it’s broken away from that.
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
As I eluded to in another reply.  
---
I don't think having viewership as a goal has anything at all to do with why Blizzard would or would not increase RNG to the game.  
---
Viewership would be a side thought.
---
&gt;no i fucking wouldn't have issue with it then? 
---
No. You would.
---
You're mad at the average result of a Desert Hare into Evolve being three 4/4s or 3/5s on turn three, not that once in a while, the Shaman will get a Bone Wraith or REstless Mummy.
---
&gt;your opponent rolls tirion lategame because reasons, dont write bullshit like this its so sickening.
---
Yeah. That sort of thing is annoying, but that Mogu Fleshshaper turning into pretty much any of the good eight drops would be equally annoying.
---
If anything, you just sound like you need a break after losing a couple too many games.
---
The economy of MTGA isn't that bad IF you are okay with your cards turning into ashes every rotation.  The lack of a real, supported eternal format hinders me from wanting to invest money into it, but you can get ~all the cards by drafting (like HS Arena mode) 30 times or so.

I was incorrect in assuming they didn’t report those numbers. I updated my comment. Thanks for the clarification and additional info.
---
I would like to win a virtual ticket because, as a resident of Louisiana and father of three young children, attending BlizzCon in person is a virtual impossibility for me. I’ve been playing Blizzard games As long as I’ve been a gamer, but my favorite by far is Rock n’ Roll Racing. Hearthstone comes in at a close second.￼￼￼
---
The rng isn't the problem with quest shaman though.  
---
It's the Hare itself for the evolve part - 3 x 4 mana value for 4 mana?  That's not RNG that's just a plain mana cheating issue.    
---
The quest itself doubles the value of battle cries when complete.  Again not RNG but mana cheating of a sort.  
---
As for lackeys well I'd argue they are a large part of the problem in the game right now as it gives quest shaman a really strong platform to tick over their quest and not suffer as badly in the early game as they would if we didn't have lackeys.
---
You mean $20, right? And it was 2800 gold if you didn't mind paying that way. It was only $60 in your bizarre imagination.
---
When have they confirmed otherwise?
---
Granted, all card games are many things to many people and outright turning off a more competitive focused side of the audience isn't going to make the game any better.
---
This pretty much confirms what I've seen in my admittedly limited time on the total wasteland that is ladder. Also, queue times seem to be up significantly, which says I'm not the only one who hates ladder right now. Given the toxic state of the game, I'm not inclined to spend time outside of single player or the occasional Tavern Brawl.
---
Might actually be a good thing?  Maybe they're announcing something at Blizzcon that'll go live immediately.
---
You are laughably wrong about currency conversion. It is baffling that you are acting so confident about this when you are so wrong and are clearly talking out of your ass.
---
Currency exchange is the most liquid market in the entire world with over 5 trillion dollars changing hands every single day. It is so incredibly liquid and easy to move money between 2 currencies, more so if you are a large company like activision blizzard.
---
I always thought Lord Godfrey says "This will be a massacre!" instead of "This will be a mercy killing!"
---
Presumably, The Bazaar won't come out in china :o)
---
Why did you remove priest and warrior?
---
I can't imagine their bosses are particularly interested in allocating dev budget for anything that doesn't clearly increase their profits, unfortunately.
---
My mistake. I thought these numbers were kept internal, but yeah like you said these numbers are necessary to be made public.
---
I would suggest you to use my strategy. Im f2p, skipped one expansion long time ago. I have \~7000 gold now, which i spend at start of every expansion and save up untill next. Usually i gather around 8500 which results in 90+ packs since there are always some free. You can run few arenas instead of spending all money on packs instantly since meta doesnt settle for 2 weeks or so after new cards. 
---
I also dust all cards that leave standard format. If you do all these things and keep high enough self control not to rush craft random legendaries you can pretty much netdeck everything needed for decent ranked position.
---
I dont want to win.
---
*Gotcha, Bitch!*

Each turn this minion is in your hand, it loses 3 life.
---
Battlecry: This minion loses 1 life for each enemy minion on the field, each card in your opponent's hand, and each card in your opponent's deck.
---
No, I mean $60, because assuming old adventures weren’t discontinued, there would be 3 of them in standard at any given time, meaning that you can’t even make budget decks since you can’t access the cards in the adventures without paying for them.
---
Imagine Odd Paladin actually playing equality.
---
It is absolutely not how every digital currency in the world works and they basically can convert currency with the snap of their fingers.
---
It seems like the only experience some people in this thread have with converting currency is trying to change your money in an airport after you come back from vacation.
---
Oh I agree that viewership is almost certainly not a metric they care about, my point is that declining viewership proves little if anything about the design direction of the game.
---
Looks like a yellow orb. The same orbs monk used to shit out with mastery.

You know that's stuck on your skin forever (ok you could get it removed I guess) right?  
---
Supporting Blitzchung who himself isn't boycotting blizzard or HS and has just signed with tempostorm?  What is there to support now?
---
&gt;Remember what Blitzchung stood up for. He risked years of work and sacrifice to utter one sentence.  
---
And now where is he?  "Oh they halves my punishment, I'll be quiet now".  Hardly the hero HK needs.  
---
At this stage it almost feels like a publicity stunt than a guy truly standing up for a cause he believes in.
---
\*Firm handshake\*

Blizzard earned 384M in the three months leading up to June 30 2019 whereas they had earned 489M in the three months leading up to June 30 2018.
---
Q2 2019 vs. Q2 2018 they wrote: The decrease in Blizzard’s net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to: (one reason) lower revenues from Hearthstone, primarily driven by lower revenues from the Rise of Shadows expansion, which was released in April 2019, as compared to The Witchwood™ expansion, which was released in April 2018

&gt;Don't matter what's in the fuckin contract
---
Well you know, laws are laws, but it's ok to break them if I agree. /s
---
Where's the line though?
---
Well he isn’t wrong
---
I still play midrange N’Zoth Warlock and just lost to a Quest Shaman that pulled 2 Shudderwocks through the lackey that gives a spell. Thatgames was painfully long and the player kept oping since turn 1. Maybe my RNG would smile here?
---
I deserve to win because I main hunter but still didn't play midrange secret deathrattles when it was tier 1 :)
---
What, like Blizzard?
---
Badum tish.
---
Wow.
---
I would simply liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.
---
Wha-?
---
There's gonna be more regret in this than all the people that deleted their account in a rush lmfao.
---
Some of the balance changes I like, some of them are really iffy.
---
The classic set being free is quite an interesting idea.  
---
All the QoL changes look great.
---
I should win...well because im lucky i guess.
---
memes
---
Because.... golden legendary!
---
I like all the suggestions, particularly 2 mana FWA.  My only wish would be a ‘casual’ arena mode, which just rewards 10g per win.  What I really want to do with my gold is just buy packs, and this would give me another way to earn gold.  Not exactly a mind-blowing suggestion, but that’s what I would want.
---
Hopefully the portal pass early access isn’t representative of what the whole con is like cuz it seems pretty lazy so far, too
---
Really just depends. For games like League, players get contracts much like traditional sports athletes. For example, Impact on Liquid was reported at around (over) $1,000,000 for, I believe, two or three years.
---
If you are a streamer, I want to assume it is different. But for competitors they tend to sign contracts like traditional sports. Smash players who travel a lot also have their travel fees covered.

I would play that

Capitalism is the problem here that puts **profits over people,** it failed us here. We need a system that works and gives back to the people. We need to put **people over profits**.

“There's a difference between Blizzard's executives and PR team making a carefully vetted decision to support a political agenda and one representative voicing support for an agenda out of nowhere. “ 
---
You’re right, I do agree with you. 
---
He broke the rules, and was punished for it. I just disagree with the rules and how they have been interpreted because in the rules they state that they are to be decided in “Blizzard’s sole discretion.” 
---
Blizzard has the power to pick and choose which actions of their players are punishment worthy. I simply disagree that this player was worthy of the punishment he got. I don’t think what he did was wrong, and I think a lot of people agree with that. But our voices don’t matter when it is up to Blizzard to decide.
---
Same; I quit blizzard games, but hung around because it wasn’t the games’ fault, it was the company’s.
---
But yeah, all the people who protested either left or swapped sides.
---
He never did. He said straight after the fact that he knew what he was doing and the potential repercussions. He stood for what he believed in and accepted his fate
---
Eliminating the Blizzard company would improve the profits of 100% China-owned game developers like the whole Tencent group.
---
I don't think he has fully decided yet. Is he streaming hearthstone? Has he streamed since the last time he gave a statement on the whole Hearthstone GM tournament ban?
---
Are you serious? You can’t find the VOD anymore, Blizzard deleted it from its channel. You can, however, find the clip on youtube if you look for it.
---
People just got tired of this shit, that's it - after all this subreddit is about game, not about Hong Kong. If you really want to boycott Blizzard, delete the game, leave subreddit, advise you friends do the same. A lot of people probably already did this
---
I used the coin at 10 mana to do this once
---
I'll have to give this a try.. I really enjoy dual class arena n mainly play on mobile so this event was a huge letdown
---
Or people like me who thought all of the Hong Kong posting was a lost cause from the start pushed by self-righteous slacktivists. 
---
We just either got drowned out or stopped coming here while the outrage machine was pumping full steam. 
---
I stopped giving Blizz money a long time ago.
---
If you ask me, asking for help against random murders of people is NOT a political statement
---
Is a plea for help.
---
Labelling violations of human rights it as political only benefits the countries that perform it who can claim it to be an internal affair. The nazis did that.
---
If he did a speech against violence against women would had not been suspended.
---
I won't. I quit playing anything that Activision or Blizzard made the last three years specifically because they care about profits more than morals.
---
same. I'm done with all of their current games. I get that there's some grey area here, but at the end of the day you either support HUMAN RIGHTS or you bow to the dollar.  Fuck blizzard
---
OWL is a complete bust, admittedly the game itself is doing OK (although I'm sure nowhere close to where they wanted it) but the OWL has danger signs all over it. The viewership is even remotely close to high enough (in spite of them slapping that thing all over their client) to justify the ridiculous running costs or the plan for teams to have their own arenas. 
---
So while it is true I'm more targeting the League there specifically rather than the game, the two are so attached at the hip at this point (due to blizzards own marketing!) that if the OWL bubble bursts (as seems likely) then the game will suffer.
---
Emperor is a better card with nearly the same result
---
I disagree with many of your balance changes, but I like the enthusiasm.
---
My Mecha’thun quest list runs it. Worst case scenario you end up not needing it and having to spend a turn dumping it and the resultant card. It’s saved me a bunch of times vs. N’Zoth decks that run Hakkar since it’s an insta-loss if he dies.
---
So a 6 month ban would have sufficed. They went wayyyy beyond that
---
Let me guess... addicted to MTG:A now?
---
Calls to protect human rights are only considered controversial by authoritarians.
---
AHAHAHAHA
---
Have fun trying to make a society like that... They don't work.
---
Live to far away, so would never be able to attend in person.
---
True, but that has nothing to do with Blizzard.
---
Nothing will happen, mb spme bpoong and thats it.
---
I’d attempt to explain the situation to you but others that are far more eloquent and informed than myself have written many articles about it on the internet.  
---
Maybe start there
---
Try it with Emperor,I can give you a deck list
---
Exactly. We should all just give in and believe everything the Chinese shills on Reddit want us to believe.
---
I’m not forgetting that part. I know that part extremely wow. The Chinese does not have a state religion, they have a state philosophy: Confucianism; which places obedience to authority, both familial and governmental, at the height of importance. The concept of western liberalism is completely foreign to them, despite how many western protestors keep trying to force that angel. It’s a different society and culture that places importance on unity over the individual. 
---
One tricky thing for Hong Kong is they are torn a bit because of the British influence.
---
Ooh, please do! &gt;:3
---
Well, it obviously did cool down somewhat. It's the case with every hot news. But what are we supposed to do?
---
Already canceled wow sub and didn't log on battle.net since shortly after the incident. And while I'll watch Blizzcon opening, I'm confident at being able to resist any hype. The hardest to ignore will be D4 and having to argue with friends that I won't stop the boycott anytime soon. Dunno what else I can do honestly.
---
That's not even a little bit comparable.  What you are describing is unified government action.  Activision-Blizzard works with china and chinese companies, but is fundamentally an american company with  mostly american workers who would be the real victims.  Shutting down every company with ties to china would grind the world economy to a halt.
---
during beta I paid for 2 packs, the money went out and I got no gold gelbin or my packs, so I had to pay again.
---
Support never gave me my money or packs back, literal theft.
---
Indeed. Nothing at all.
---
people dont identify with their government or religion as much anymore and I feel like people have turned to brands to express who they are.
---
Nobody cares anymore
---
Or you can just use Emperor Thaurissan to discount Shudderwock.
---
Well, if 10% of their customers do remain upset and refrain from purchasing new products, isn't that a great result for the protests? 
---
It may feel bad to have a significant amount of people backing down after just a few weeks, but plenty of people are still upset and it will hurt their bottom line.
---
We just have to respect one another. If you feel like protests/boycots, cool. Don't wanna mix politics and gaming? Fine as well.
---
Ty!
---
My personal highlights for Blizzcon2019 would be:
---
1. Tons of “Free Hong Kong” “Stand With Hong Kong” signs &amp; T-shirts
---
2. NBA kid baits the camera again
---
3. Winnie The Pooh pack raids the venue
---
It's still weird and potentially illegal as well...
---
Yeah something was off with the time. I was wondering why they got rid of all the Halloween stuff (greetings emote and arena changes) while it was still 10/31 where I am.
---
Yeah, his quote was nothing short of bizarre.
---
&gt; they have a state philosophy: Confucianism;
---
You are completely lost in the mystique. You have the wrong idea. Mao Zedong was entirely against all forms of worship, including what you just stated, "Confucianism", which includes and entails the practice of ancestral worship.
---
What I mean to say is if you, as a foreigner, say something that is against the constitution of the People's Republic of China, they will feel offended like in the same way you say something that violates a devoutly religious person's religion. For example, if you say to a Chinese person, "Taiwan is not China." then that is equal to saying "Christ was the Messiah and you are a heretic for denying it!" to an Orthodox and passionate practitioner of Judaism.
---
They already did it last year in WoW. Dont be retarded.
---
Wait, why do we need to boycot reddit exactly?
---
Lots of Mei cosplay I hope.
---
Remember to stay civil at blizzcon. This awful decision was took by greedy high payed employees that dont even play the games. Blizzcon is for devloppers to show thier work, and trust me they are on our side, but they cannot do anything :/
---
I build a DS paladin a year ago that always takes me to at least rank 10. Highest I got was rank 8. Extremely fun nonetheless
---
&gt; This will get downvoted because most people have already gotten over it but just know that Blizzard won in this situation because apparently we give less of a shit than they do.
---
You know that is bullshit. You're going to be upvoted for the comment, despite being wrong about where people currently sit on the subject. Yes, it's gotten quieter, but that happens with every story. With Blizzcon starting, you and everyone else knows damn well the story will gain traction again.
---
Honestly most ppl don't really care two shits about the situation in hong kong. Most just hate that a US company is bowing to "imaginary" Chinese pressure
---
Happy CakeDay 🎂
---
  EcceHomo#2205 EU 80g quest trade,  I will show the quest but you go first .
---
One guy rekt them hard with question. Someone else will have to shun in, but since acti got em I have same opinion of them no matter what. Money grabbing whores.
---
My response to this, is what did you truly really expect to have happen? Did you really think the company would just end? Even other companies that took advantage of Blizzard's blunder are just doing these things to gain support and make money. These are businesses, money is always going to be what matters most even if they say the opposite to you, they need money if they expect to be a business. It's always going to be motivated by what can we do to come out ahead.
---
It's not fair to not give any credit to Blizzard, they could have just did nothing about it. Fans should always speak their mind and opinion, and stand up for what's wrong. How else can a company be put in check. It's how a company reacts from there which matters most. They can't just fold their hand and stop business as usual either. They aren't going to just close their doors cause they messed up. What company would? 
---
"Sorry guys, you're right I guess we will seize to exist now." Lol what? 
---
I mean none of this would be happening if not for Blitzchung, which he fully knew there could be a reprecussion. Had he not done it none of this would even be a thing right now. He wasn't even that upset at it himself. It did it's job either way it got the word out there. This isn't and wasn't about blizzard from the get go, it's about China, and instead of everyone focusing on China and Hong Kong they took it out on Blizzard a company that can't possibly do anything to change what's happening there.
---
Anyone who cares should have just focused their effort to finding ways to help those in Hong Kong rather than rallying against a company for acting like a company.  I mean majority of people.who protested probably did nothing else to actually help the problem they are rallying against.
---
radnom
---
&gt;we refuse to let our games be politicised
---
Also blizzard
---
&gt;Yeah these characters are LGBT except for in China
---
They are. I was also told by the people who are running the world of warcraft live Q&amp;A that if people want to ask questions about the situation, they can.
---
OW league being a flop is maybe true, but if OW was a flop then so are 99.99% of all games
---
&gt;our games is not political!
---
&gt;LGBT all the things! Except for in China, the gay does not exist in China
---
They have confirmed people will be able to ask their questions live and in person, not having to go through a proxy
---
Whole situation is hilarious, people thinking they’re making *any* difference whatsoever regarding the HK situation by boycotting an *American* company.
---
So why are LGBT characters straight in China
---
What free time?
---
So basically just throwing out the original concept of anyone actually getting to ask anything, and the ”mildly curated” list just pushes the narrative they want.
---
Yeah, not cool, and I am sad how people have a ”political memory” of two weeks. Where are all the posts about HK protests? Oh not cool anymore so lets just forget about it. Disgusting.
---
I get that people hate blizzard for censoring that hearthstone player but I dont hear anyone blaming China or stop buying their products.  Instead somehow we are boycotting Blizzard and not China? Where are the protest in their embassies?
---
&gt;I did not realize how many people have miraculously started defending Blizzard, though.
---
It's no miracle. 
---
They've been there from the start, but their comments were buried in the momentum. Your realisation is merely an example of how reddit can hide dissenting opinions that it doesn't want to hear.
---
I really don’t get why you all so mad about r/hearthstone having hearthstone posts
---
You are right; they really made sure to not say a single word too much. They merely pointed out that their streams are not a place for "divisive political views". In other words they don't want anyone but themselves to meddle in politics.
---
Several Tier 1 decks? May I ask when you have started playing Arena? Asking because I started playing a bit in October as well. I used all the NPE stuff + 15 bucks worth of Welcome stuff to build a budget Mono Red deck and know I see my grinding path ahead of me, wondering if I should really take it. 
---
My problem: even with Mono Red I still feel like I'm missing about (half) a dozen Rares for the deck to be optimal on a base power level, and that the budgeted versions just marginally don't make the cut to be over 55% to farm Standard Events. I was Legend in HS several times, but even in Constructed in Arena, I feel like my Penny-Deck isn't quite equipped (too easily countered) to push for Platin with all the other decks in Gold being fully fleshed out. Thoughts? How did you grow your collection? Are you more of a draft person?
---
Same with any massive company doing stupid shit.
---
I garuntee as soon as a new fallout comes out that people like not a single fuck will be given about the shit they've done the last year.
---
Hell Logan Paul filmed a dead guy hanging from a tree and millions of people still lick his ass to this day.
---
Stuff happens and the majority of people just don't care enough to do anything about it and then just move on
---
Hi missing about (half) a dozen rares for the deck to be optimal on a base power level, and that the budgeted versions just marginally don't make the cut to be over 55% to farm standard events. i was legend in hs several times, but even in constructed in arena, i feel like my penny-deck isn't quite equipped (too easily countered) to push for platin with all the other decks in gold being fully fleshed out. thoughts? how did you grow your collection? are you more of a draft person?, I'm dad.
---
Doctor Booms hate him!
---
Well there's 2 big differences here;
---
1) The only argument Nakamura voiced is that some people wouldn't be allowed to participate in the tournament. While this is happening for political reasons, being disappointed that some people won't be able to participate to a tournament isn't a political argument. 
---
2) If Saudi Arabia gets butthurt over these comments anyway, what are they gonna do? Stop hosting tournaments? Stop sending their players to tournaments? Neither of those things mean anything. 
---
Hosting the tournament in Saudi Arabia doesn't mean anything for the Chess Federation. And their players? They don't even have 1 player in the top 100...
---
To put it simply: Saudi Arabia doesn't matter to the chess world at all. They can host tournaments anywhere else, and they wouldn't lose anything of value if Saudi Arabia stopped sending their players to their tournaments. 
---
But China matters a lot to the Hearthstone world. They represent a huge chunk of their players/fans.
---
That's like the difference between offending that drunk idiot who just hang around your company for no reason, or offending your #1 client.
---
If you're afraid of the question that your hardcore fans have for you, then you really fucked up
---
Yeah, I don't really get this argument.  People make it all the time but like...we wouldn't have regulation fire escapes or ended slavery or segregation without outrage over what businesses were willing to do for profit.  Asking businesses to make a moral stand instead of maximizing profit is kinda the entire history of labor.
---
Literally every company on earth would do the same as blizzard did.  These companies care about profits, not people.
---
Wow, what a depressing and defeatist attitude considering all we have seen over the years, and even what is going on in Hong Kong.   
---
Fuck Blizzard, and screw this sort of weak "we can't do anything" attitude. I would rather fail than not even try. Get outta here with that attitude man.
---
The right to speak openly shouldn’t be, either.
---
I can assure China is politicising bullshit far more normal than this. Besides, if gay people existing isn’t political, why is gay marriage  banned in China?
---
Blizzard has been doing this wrong
---
&gt;Yeah, not cool, and I am sad how people have a ”political memory” of two weeks. Where are all the posts about HK protests? Oh not cool anymore so lets just forget about it. Disgusting.
---
Or... maybe what actually happened was that those 5 days represented a completely false picture of the Hearthstone community.  People were flooding here from places like r/hongkong to upvote and support all the relevant threads and make it look like the Hearthstone community were united in their opposition of Blizzard, when in reality that was never the case.  If you want evidence of that, consider that....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- r/hearthstone was one of the fastest growing subs *on reddit* during this period.  
---
\- If you actually dug into the threads and read the comments (which the people who didn't really care about Hearthstone and were just astroturfing probaly never bothered with beyond the top couple of 'headline' comments) you found a much more diverse set of opinions and a lot of pro-Blizzard comments were heavily upvoted.
---
Keep politics out of games please. We deal with it on every other platform. I for one want games to be just games. You don't see politics talk in movies so keep it out of entertainment. 
---
Blizzard was technically correct but did a shit job of handling how they did not want to be involved in this. 
---
What they should have done is issue a warning 1st to everyone to say that we do not want our platform to be used for things outside of the scope that we have defined. He can have his opinion but voice it on your own time and on other platforms. Next time anyone will do it will receive a 6 month ban. 
---
The end result is the same just what they did is really bad PR.
---
I made a similar video series back in the day, and Trump's Teachings is essentially this as well.
---
I do not know how Trump's videos have fared over time, but mine were overall less popular than the channel's other content, and have not been able to bring long-tail viewership either. Furthermore, the few people who do find them later on always ask for updates, because the gameplay samples will inevitably be from a previous meta, and even though the thought process remains the same, people do not want to watch them because they do not feel fresh. Therefore, such guides would need to be updated, with essentially the same content, for every meta in order to maintain a fresh feel.
---
I did not see demand for them when I tried, but who knows, maybe you can find an audience now.
---
It’s almost like there are people out there actively trying to dissuade a protest. Don’t give in! Wear your Free Hong Kong shirts, chant some patriotic shit. You gave your money to blizzard before you knew their stance on this. Don’t waste it. You bought your spot on this soapbox. Use it.
---
This man has found peace.
---
&gt;&gt; this shit again. FFS, grow up already. Those casters are not permanent employees. They provide services and there should be no explanation whatsoever required to stop using service you are not satisfied with.
---
Sorry, let's go with a really easy example to show you how dumb you are being. Let's say it's the Super Bowl and Tom Brady stands up in front of everyone and makes a racist comment in an interview after the game. Then the broadcasting network fires the reporter that held the mic up to him because, after all, if he/she hadn't done that then Tom Brady never would've said the racist comment. Are they *legally* allowed to do this? Sure. Is it going to sit well with the millions of viewers who watched it and know the interviewer was just doing their job as mandated by said company and be pissed off? Also yes. 
---
If you seriously think that companies making a decision that people are unhappy with doesn't warrant a response reprimanding them for it I don't even know what to tell you. People can bash Blizzard for whatever reason just as Blizzard can fire employees for whatever reason. Get off your shitty high horse acting like people upset at the company are somehow wrong because Blizzard has legal precedent.
---
&gt;&gt; Either you are in the wrong sub, or you are living in a different reality.
---
What part of outside of HARD TROLLS did you not understand? There's plenty of them in this sub and there have been exponentially more since the news dropped. I've read through and commented in a lot of the threads myself, so I've seen firsthand exactly what I'm talking about. Sure, the comments you're talking about are there too... usually on the lower end in comment chains.
---
Blizzard didn't distance themselves from politics with their initial reactions though, they sided with China. I also think Blizzard miscalculated. HKers might be a minority, but their western base makes up way over half of their revenue stream and many definitely would sympathize with the HK protesters. They probably didn't think westerners would catch wind of their actions.
---
I do feel that the people in China are being manipulated by their government, I mostly don't blame the general populace. And if Blizzard just publicly warned Blitzchung to keep politics out of their events, that would be the true way to distance themselves from politics. That doesn't count as supporting anti-government propaganda and I think most people would have been fine with that.
---
&gt; Things blow up on the internet and blow over after a couple days/weeks, and this is just another case of it.
---
it is always like this. thats the reason blizzard did nothing wrong. whatever happens on the internet is always short term. why would they risk a lot long term, for something that is forgotten after a few weeks?
---
you guys want blizzard to be empathic in a situation, where they can only lose, while not being able to change anything. that says a lot about how much you know about the system we are living in.
---
I don't know why I deserve to win but sure would like a free golden legendary
---
No, I want everyone to start protesting at blizzcon
---
Charge your device dammit.
---
In hearthstone, unlike MTG, most effects don't resolve deaths in the middle of them. Thus things can bounce back from the dead via healing. Exceptions to this are the various yogg-style effects, which resolve deaths between spellcasts.
---
&gt;&gt;Almost like he used the HK cause to further his own agenda.
---
And what agenda would that be, exactly? He's a fucking pro gamer, not a politician. Stop using non-appliciable buzzwords to sound cool.
---
Could you lose your job tomorrow and be fine with it? how about your car? your house? your family? your life? You guys don't seem to realize that Hearthstone isn't just a hobby for Blitz, it's his JOB. His source of income, a thing he needs to live. He never wanted Blizzard to get hit like this in the first place, that was you guys doing that, he just wanted to show support for HK on his stream.  
---
You'd more than likely do the exact same thing if your boss told you to stop it with the political shit at work or you're fired, so calling somebody else a coward over it is probably hypocritical of you. I know personally that the company I work for has done some shit I'm not okay with, but at the end of the day I need a job to live. What's the point to sticking my dick in a hornets nest about it when it wont change anything anyway? I'd just end up fired and on the street.  
---
A good skill to have in life is knowing when to pick your battles, and this hill isn't one worth dying on when there's so many other things that could be done to help instead. Who honestly gives a fuck about Blizzard? when and why did this become us vs Blizz instead of us vs the fucked up HK political situation? Blizz can wait.
---
Still haven't played any HS or OW since then. May never. I would feel guilty. Not just for HK, but it would feel like supporting China... And ranting about China's goings on is a regular pastime in my household. They have concentration camps, censored literature, state provided "family", a great firewall, etc. When the F*ck did it become inappropriate to call out Nazis?
---
Oh that's right, since China's 5% contributions to blizzard's bottom line. 
---
5% is all it takes for companies to be okay with this.
---
I can't wait to see what else I will boycott for this. I am one person making possible no difference, and I don't care.
---
Blizz: "Sorry man, rules are rules, we didn't make them."
---
  
---
Non cunts: "But you DID make them... and they are written in a way that means ypu didnt HAVE to do what you did, you just CHOSE to"
---
Blizz: **chuckles** "yeah, but the rules are rules man" **Blizzard walks off into the sunset with a bag full of blood soaked money and free organs for life whilst the Bad Boys theme song plays in the background.**
---
I hope people who intend to ask difficult questions at Blizzcon (if even possible) remember that the majority, if not all the staff there had no control on the situation so do not deserve any rudeness or insults. These questions won't be answered as I am pretty sure Blizzard will have forbidden any mention or response regarding the issue. Get your point across in a clear and polite way, the ones to blame are the Majority share holders and the company bigwigs who won't be there.
---
have you heard of Gandhi?
---
Investors will see it, and worry about future profits￼. Blizzcon tickets are for paying for the venue, they likely don’t make too much back. But if people go, buy nothing there and protest, tons of redflags will be raised during the next shareholder’s call.
---
That article says one of them is afraid of getting hurt during the protests.
---
As if people are going to violently rush the booths and start curb stomping people
---
As if their fear somehow equates to justifying their stance...
---
Obviously there was an influx of new people that probably didn’t care for the, nor can I say myself I care more about the game than what is happening to people in HK. It is a real issue and needs to be adressed.
---
So I don’t really care if it was a consensus or not, it needs more awareness.
---
I tried to justify the move from Blizzards part but cannot. Whilst Blizzard may have the right to do whatever they want with their business (ie curate the content), it doesnt mean it is right in doing so.
---
If so many people (including Blizzard employees) misunderstand you, you‘re doing something wrong either way.
---
People need to stop seeing it solely as supporting Hong Kong. The reason none of this gains traction in the US is because people don’t feel like it directly affects them. This needs to be reframed for what it is: A display of domination.
---
You realize the HK protests are not  unanimous thing right? There are people who view protesters as traitors to China. Sure there are awful things going on, but it's really not the black and white situation people want to make it out to be.
---
Wasn't area 51 a surprising success? I mean it was never intended to be a raid but it turned out to be an awesome party afaik.
---
Or just hero power, coin and shudder?
---
hey man gotta pay the bills
---
Yeah. But at the time doesn't fuckin matter. Whether it's ok OR NOT is ALL that matters. 
---
What is factually morally is all that is relevant, ever. 
---
It's no excuse, either.
---
China can survive without pork and soy. America will literally lose almost everything, from products to parts to material.
---
I should win because i play hearthstone since un’ goro. I always watch blizzcon but i moved this year so i couldn’t purchase a ticket, i’d love one!
---
Why would he, this has only been good for him, publicity wise, pretty much any company who isn't grossly indebted to China, can sign him for a huge PR bump, even though he welched on his supposed morals.
---
&gt;focus on the great things they came to show to the world
---
Yeah, let's hold off on that for now...
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Reached legend with mage istead of shaman, you have my respect, a true man.
---
You need to reread the Constitution, there is no right requiring a private business to platform your political opinions.
---
wow
---
Allowing a foreign country to dictate the policies of businesses in yours by threats of politically motivated sanctions is absolutely fine, though.
---
Don't be naive. Failure to act at all would have worse consequences in the long run than the cost of acting.
---
Games are art and all art is political. There's zero reason games can't be valid platforms for advocating politics.
---
Google, Apple, and Steam all use prepaid cards which was your main argument. I showed you that it is possible with other companies, yet here you are telling us "they literally can't do anything to help"? even when you contact support. How stubborn are you when I've just pointed 3 companies that I came up from the top of my head that allowed it without even having to reach customer support.
---
People forgot that corporations stole a shitload of money and nearly sent us into another depression a decade ago.   We're back to sucking them off and giving them everything they want with no regulation
---
She didn't protect shit
---
I'm sorry but Blizzard didn't manipulate me. I just tought that the controversy was blown way out of proportion, never participated into it, and am glad people has already forgot it.
---
I'm pretty sure most of your products at home are made by slavery and child labour in brutal dictatorships or rigged democracies where workers don't have the most basic human rights, yet you don't give a fuck about any of those. You've decided only Blizzard is an immoral company. The rest of our rotten society is ok. We have to hate only this one company that applied a rule that is in his rulebook more severely than they should.
---
&gt;If enough people don't purchase their game, absolutely
---
And you think that's actually going to happen, do you?
---
&gt;If your daughter wants a pony do you swallow your pride and buy it for her
---
Holy fucking shit did you just compare buying a fifty pound computer game to buying a fucking pony?
---
Holy fucking shit.......
---
&gt;Teaching your child that morals are more important than a simple video game is something a responsible parent should do.
---
He's going to end up teaching her nothing except selective outrage is a thing that idiots do to pat themselves on the back.
---
Jesus I can't get over that pony analogy..... Fucking hell man, that's quite possibly the stupidest fucking thing I've ever read in this website.
---
Companies have the ability to "bypass" free speech since forever because companies should be free to internally regulate the language that is used within them (and suffer the consequences in popularity, of course). That's why for the longest time you couldn't say "fuck" on TV.
---
If a company doesn't want to broadcast a certain type of message they're absolutely free to do so. And if you don't agree then don't sign the contract. Actively breaking the contract means that Blizz can (and should) punish the player on their own platform. They didn't fucking kill, jail or fine him. They just said "we don't want you on our game competitively for six months". No free speech violation here.
---
Your rights, and the rights of Blizz are both untouched.
---
And once again, Blizzard cant do it. So continuing to point out 3 companies that arent blizz is irrelevant.
---
I inherently disagree with it.
---
A pre-approved Q&amp;A is just a dev post where they pretend to answer "questions from the community", when in reality they're just making the statements they already wanted to make.
---
A Q&amp;A is supposed to be organic and catch them off guard. It's supposed to reflect the state of the community and what people genuinely actually give a shit about.
---
sadly true
---
Protesting outside the venue is free and happens every year
---
People forget a lot of things, like when the CIA set up a soft coup in Australia to oust a prime minister that was going to nationalize their mines, or many other countries destabilizing them.
---
People forget very quickly when it's not actively affecting them and when another "crisis" appears

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
That's a description of envy.
---
... By capitulating to an oppressive dictatorship which kills people based on their religion and takes their organs.
---
This place has become an echo chamber for everyone that stayed. It's actually really funny to watch these posts pop up like "wow I guess no one really cared!" But everyone who cared either left or don't feel the need to post about it anymore.
---
I still dont get it how people are so impressed with what blizzard did. They are a COMPANY their ONLY objective is PROFIT. Thats capitalism, thats the way it is. They don't care for the Chinese government at all, its just the sweet dollars they could lose if hearthstone was banned from China if they didn't do anything. When you are a company it doesn't matter if a country is a democracy or a dictatorship as long as you has profit and Blizzard its just doing what others would do too.
---
-Sent from my IPhone
---
Anyone who goes to blizzcon is a moron.
---
You can still do that to some level, but given the size of the community it's a small sampling. We all laugh at red shirt guy but was that really worth the time for a minor lore question? If you have people submit them you can fund popular questions and answer those.
---
I'm not saying it's the best but it is understandable.
---
you get golden rare instead of golden epic
---
Tournament mode
---
That bastard hasn't uninstalled Hearthstone!? Doesn't he care about Hong Kong? /s
---
yea... in practice, if someone says "I wish for world peace", they would not be punished, even though technically it's not held in the same standard as "we should wage war on country X".
---
&gt;increasing prices in that market
---
That is what a tariff is.
---
That's for getting to 15-11. Getting to 10 gives you another common, being the first for getting to 20-16.
---
Spoiler: you got the complete opposite of downvoted, just like every other single thread about this.
---
I really wish disagreement with the mob wasn't constantly painted as "defending Blizzard." I wish every single time people say "but blizzard makes political statements all the tiiiiime" it wasn't a thinly veiled reference to their support of LGBT. I wish that it was *actually thinly veiled more often.* That, above all other things, has to be the most tiring, disappointing thing about this debacle. I'm not even accusing you of saying that, but I knew I wouldn't have to scroll down too far in the comments to find that exact sentiment. I was not disappointed.
---
Yeah but that’s the government, the companies themselves could easily increase prices and have it not be considered a tariff. It would just be a price increase.
---
How do you need more? Do you really play more than 18 decks a week? I've literally never had more than 9 decks in my entire time of playing hearthstone and I've played since beta. I just legitimately do not understand
---
It’s important to remember that the event in question did not happen in the US, it happened in Taiwan. He was not punished for bad mouthing China, he was punished for raising a highly controversial political issue on a stream about video games. He broke the rules.
---
If you think the issue that he raised is not that controversial, then I’m going to assume you don’t live in Taiwan, where reunification with China is the primary divide between its political parties.
---
The folks working at the blizzard office in Taiwan made a judgement call that was totally in line with their culture and with the rules of the tournament. They did nothing wrong.
---
&gt; LGBTQ+ is not a safe topic. Half of the world powers execute/disappear people for being openly gay.
---
There won’t be any markets closing for blizzard any time soon tho if they continue supporting LGTBQ+ lol
---
&gt; Comparatively, HK protests are far far less controversial -
---
There would be markets closing for them if they platform pro HK stances 
---
&gt;  1 side is CCP brainwashed Chinese+Billionaires vs Everyone that is not a billionaire or brainwashed/life-fearing Chinese citizen.
---
Nice yellow peril my dude. Really bringing back that sweet sweet racism lol 
---
&gt; And it isn't really childish to point out the incredibly obvious fact that this comment section is PACKED full of trolls/fake accounts.
---
Got any evidence for that being the case?
---
&gt; I dont think human rights and freedom are a political issue.
---
well I guess it depends on interpretation, this part here:
---
&gt;I dont think human rights and freedom are a political issue.
---
seems to say that it's not opinion. But  might have misunderstood you
---
The genre is called autochess though, anyone with any familiarity with the genre knows that. Doesn't really matter that it doesn't have anything to do with chess. It's as nonsensical of a name as MOBA.
---
I just want to know when the next Diablo will be out...
---
People have different opinions and think different things, but I personally do not think they're a political issue, I think it's important that everyone has these rights, and I think Blizzard should stand up for them.
---
How about a long line of stupid incidents
---
If people are already unhappy with you and you give them some bait then they will take it every single time
---
Gimme dat golden legendary
---
But the companies themselves are immoral and put money above all else. They won't increase price past the point where it makes them a bit more money unless the government forces them to.
---
And this is the moment where the movement begins to eat its own.
---
Yeah but it's only fair when the guys I'm with do it.
---
Hey Blizzard, you're at a B-cup and we need you at a double-D.
---
I mean she aint wrong. Nerd and proud of it! Congrats
---
They're not gonna pick the most popular questions.
---
They're gonna be undesirable to answer.
---
They'll pick less popular, easier questions.
---
I can’t believe people are still whining about this, I mean, who gives a shit?
---
Why haven’t people like you and the hundred that upvote you left? 
---
I know the whole “human rights violation” but as company they can’t do shit, if you think this from a business perspective it makes sense, if you think this from an individual then it doesn’t make sense.
---
It’s just that simple. Whining about it won’t change anything lmao. If you people think that you’re actually accomplishing something just wake up from your sad reality. 
---
Just think about this, why would you potentially lose a huge percentage of your market just to appease to a couple thousand people? 
---
Regardless of all of that. Blizzard were in the right to ban him, they have an explicit rule regarding this stuff. Doesn’t matter if you agree, disagree, whatever.
---
Unrelated to the thread in question
---
I mean, MOBA stands for something though - Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.  
---
It's also not the title of the first game of the genre, either.
---
&gt; They actively restrict the access foreign companies have to their market
---
So does the US, and Europe. If you don't meet certain standards set up by those countries, you aren't allowed to sell your products there. For example, cars have emission requirements. Why is it bad when China does it but okay when the US and EU do it?
---
But, honestly, who wants Blizzard to crash and burn? They make games we love and want to play. I hope they make a small statement apologizing and we all can move on.
---
Except that it's been proven online communities are exactly the same as regular communities. People form the same connections, just in a different format.
---
You're right that people want to feel like they're making a difference, but when the spotlight is off "hot topics", nobody seems to really give a shit if it affects them personally.
---
I think a lot of people are just selfish and want to play their games and buy their Chinese products no matter who gets hurt.
---
Yes, I am a blizzard shill.
---
Yes, I post in r/wowcirclejerk.
---
Yes, I am insane.
---
The person I replied to said companies have no tools for this. I’m simply saying they do, not that they would utilize them.
---
If people have outrage over one they have to have outrage over both
---
Nice 1000 win portrait, nerd.

Good for those involved. Good message, good design, not intrusive to those who just want to participate in Blizzcon.
---
Respect.

Oh it’s about fun? Then why has there been NOTHING ADDED BESIDES EXPANSIONS AND COPY PASTED SOLO ADVENTURES ?? No other game modes, no tournament mode, nothing. Still love the game but damn get a grip dude
---
As long as there's some Nuarto running, I'm sure the internet will be pleased.
---
Thank you!
---
L
---
Thanks, I got my time zones mixed up somehow and thought it was past the deadline already.
---
Why it’s Blizzards job to take a political stand when governments don’t?
---
Translate to OPEN YALLS EYES FOOLS
---
Not exactly how they wanted it. I and many others have chosen to leave the game as a result of everything that happened. The impact of this will only be seen in their analytics later on. Just because those upset are no long vocal does not mean they have forgiven Blizzard.
---
What is the fatigue damage of PNC's next draw?
---
Oh no. New hero cards? Nooooo.
---
I’m thinking Blizz wouldn’t randomly change their stance on something like this. This is all us.
---
Just wanted to say "why you should win" is a bit of a self entitled entry method. Maybe something like "make a HS themed joke" would be more fun. As per rules though, I should win because I made this suggestion.
---
&gt; When was the last time anyone in the west did more than get outraged for a few days on the interwebz?
---
Ive seen anti-Chump outrage every day since the USA election on reddit.
---
So....pretty recently.
---
I remember the title of Rise of Shadows being leaked by IGN and the graphic of the league of evil looking at me like, “really, did you have to spoil it?”
---
Thanks to Blizzard's blundering, Blitzchung's message was amplified far greater and wider than he could have ever hoped for.
---
Had they done nothing, most people would have never heard of it.
---
Instead, he's received likely hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of free advertising for his message - this was being reported on internationally, after all, not just in small gaming circles.
---
Additionally, he just signed on with TempoStorm to continue playing Hearthstone.
---
I'm no mind-reader, but if I was him, I'd be thrilled with how this all played out.
---
&gt; A)
---
Damn sorry I rustles you’re jimmies :(
---
&gt; to bring anything to the table, youd ask for a dick pic.
---
You literally just read through me having a regular discussion you fucking idiot 
---
&gt; C) Sources for what claim that I made? Can you find it? Because I sure as hell have made no claims in this comment thread.
---
Again rather sorry that I offended you by mistaking you for another person.
---
Point still stands tho.
---
I just don't understand why y'all are so up in arms about a democratic region that's one of the wealthiest on the planet and is having protests fueled by state nationalism. Do you even know what you're upset about? Hong Kong is its own country in everything but name.
---
Blizzard just made a business decision following exactly the letter of the terms that were agreed to that were violated by somebody that knew exactly what they were doing. Y'all are dumb
---
No shit. That’s what I just said. I’m not claiming they would. I’m claiming if they decided to take on hostile foreign governments, and were willing to lose money, they have the tools to do so. Not that they ever would.
---
And for that, I'm very grateful for him.  He was very brave, but it doesn't mean he needs to destroy his career for the rest of his life.  Savvy and brave.  Good on him.
---
Weeiirrrdooo
---
🇭🇰
---
I am sick and tired of these Rich Hong Kong people dictating the west.
---
There would have been _some_ outrage, but yes, comparatively less outrage.
---
Because I support Hong Kong
---
Totally agree. Blitzchung was a representative for blizzard in that interview as he was on their stream and the person posting on that account is representing the company in a similar fashion.
---
Very much.  They're getting free PR by just having the possibility out there.  Now THEY look like the victims.  Disgusting.
---
Might be an issue with the servers. I got done with a game and got disconnected. Now it will not reconnect: https://i.imgur.com/SB6M7Rt.png
---
The casters would have employment contracts, I’m pretty sure they arent available for public view.
---
The American University team or whatever were banned after a week because Bliz realised they made a too soon of a judgment call which they explained in their public message (or apology) and they said they would take more time to come up with a punishment and thats what they exercised here.
---
Exactly. This is the simplest case of balancing to do. Remove Evolve and replace it with another card. 
---
They nerfed Extra Arms and Pocket Galaxy back to their original mana cost after seeing it was being too oppressive with the latest expansion, so there is no excuse not to do the same with Evolve right now.
---
Stand!  And fear no darkness!  There may come a day, when the strength of men fails, but it is not this day.  There may be day, when Shamans overrun everything, and Combo Priest drives the Warriors and Mages from existence!  BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY!  This day, those who love Aggro, Tempo and Combo shall stand together, united against a common foe, the grim overlord of Boredom and the way we whittle away our time causing sprites to go face or waiting for the final combo face.  This day, we fight!  I bid you stand, players of Hearthstone!
---
For Brode.
---
Can you point me to the stipulation in Blizzard’s Terms of Service that allows political statements to be made on Twitter and disallows them to be made on gaming live-streams? 
---
While your argument may be considered socially acceptable, it has no basis in legality.
---
Pyro -&gt; extra arms on 1/1 -&gt; circle works too
---
Man your post history is a wild ride.
---
Why is it blizzards responsibility to take a political stance. They aren’t breaking the law.
---
Isn't that what Blizzcon's been since 2016 onwards?
---
That's not even good, i've been doing it with C'thun for ages. And that sucks in Wild too.
---
I think Blitzchung may have already understood how Blizzard would react and wasn't quite as taken aback as the typical redditor was.
---
Rule 2 says you must have previously commented, if I comment here now does that count or is it too late
---
Nah the impact of angry people on reddit will be basically nothing. You really think this tiny echo chamber will effect a business that's mostly funded by financially successful people sitting on the toilet at work?
---
A whole wave of HearthStone cards had their art changed to remove graphic violence, blood, and sexually suggestive art. All keys to be allowed into the Chinese market  
---
One of them specifically, the art was completely unchanged except for like.... 3 drops of blood that were removed
---
So me continuing playing overwatch also does not mean hypocrisy on my part? I still support them
---
You’re right, maybe list some products you use on the daily, research the companies if they’ve done shady business with China and find some alternatives that might cost more but have nothing to do with China, maybe post how
---
Much you’ve donated?
---
Willing to do that since your morals are above money? Or does your support stop with no effort reddit posts?

GAMEPLAY: Nerfs to cards which did not fundamentally break wild will be reverted, we will then HOF any cards which remain problematic for standard and replace them with less problematic cards from expansions. Questionable cards which have the chance of impacting wild negatively will be reverted for a 1 month trial period and if they prove to be detrimental to the game will be re-nerfed. In order to facilitate thorough testing of these cards at low risk, all players will be provided with temporary copies of the reverted cards for the test month.
---
NEW CARDS: Dramatically more interaction will be made available to various classes. In particular, some type of discard, counterspelling, taxing, or other analogous effects will be available to every class or as a neutral option. These effects will be made cost efficient. In order for combo decks to exist in a healthy manner, opposition decks need a way of interacting with them other than killing them faster.
---
RELEASE CADENCE: Though I don't expect the resources of the team to be large enough to add extra major releases, I think we can manage a "Rise of the Mechs" level of event every expansion cycle. Targeted buffs will be aimed at under-performing archetypes to help add diversity to the ladder and a single dramatic neutral legendary or pair of epics will be added to the card pool. As with the reverted cards, every player will get a temporary copy of every changed card for one month as a testing period and we will make adjustments after that time if needed. Note: this will make the release cadence two months of new expansion, one month of event metagame, and one month after everything has been released, nerfed, and balanced for stability then repeat. Competitive events will take place throughout  these cycles but major tournament milestone such as the world championship will take place only during the fourth and final month.
---
COMPETITIVE: In order to bring attention to game modes other than standard, top level hearthstone competition will feature other game modes. Furthermore the league structure will be slightly revamped to accommodate these changes. At the beginning of a competitive month, GM players will submit a standard lineup and a wild lineup. Each player will then play a round robin within their group of eight over the course of that month using their standard lineup, with two additional matches played with their wild lineup (for a total of 9 matches each month). Over a four month season each player will have played each opponent 4 times in standard and once in wild. The final match each player plays each season (8 slots for wild matches, only 7 opponents) will be an exhibition event which does not contribute to standing in a format other than standard or wild (be it arena, dungeon run equivalent, sealed, or some other deckbuilding format such as pauper). This will also engage the best players in the world in playing wild and therefore engage the balance team in actively managing wild.
---
COMMUNICATION: A top developer will start a weekly column (vlog?) called hearthside chats. This will be an official venue for smaller announcements, discussions about design philosophy and community issues, design anecdotes, and in general touching base with the audience. Even if the information isn't exactly what everyone wants to hear, the continual engagement will hopefully help the community understand what kind of influence they're having.
---
CORPORATE POLICY: I'm king right, I might as well make some changes I know the HS dev team can't make. We will be divesting from the Chinese market. We are sad to lose the Chinese playerbase, we know most of them are victims and not our enemies in the Chinese government's ongoing war on free speech, but the price of sacrificing our values for access to the Chinese market is too high.
---
Greater Bay Area welcomes you.
---
where is the explanation in all of that? it's just a "let's be real" statement under a response which was about hope
---
don't be so sensitive. don't be gray
---
Are you talking about Standard rotation? MTG has been doing that for over 20 years at this point, Hearthstone does is too, and the expectation has always been that another format would eventually get added to MTGA that uses older cards (Which I believe has actually been announced already?)
---
Even if they did make a hearthstone 2 I imagine it would be more like heroes 2.0, which was a heroes of the storm update where they gave out 20 free heroes for a limited time and reworked some major aspects of the game
---
Ok, double down :) you can have hope without being unrealistic. Hope is good. The time scale is unrealistic and very naive.

Hello everyone! This week's top cards is a super special one. It's being posted early since the regular edition with the most upvoted card from the week will be posted later on Monday to coincide with [the final round of our Battle Royale Design Tournament.](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/dnfgts/80k_subscriber_battle_royale_expansion_design/) It's also features a few unusual cards that aren't like what is usually featured.
---
Anyways, the details. These last few weeks, [our Discord](https://discord.gg/6bf4R5P) has held 2 small competitions, one for "DIY" cards and one for spooky Halloween cards. People really ~~went wild~~ got creative with these. DIY cards is a term that was coined within the community by u/Maysick and u/DKPaladinMDL and is really confusing and something that is debated about (particularly by u/trueaesthete). You can find an explanation and [podcast episode about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/979a63/rcustomhearthstone_community_podcast_episode_3/) but essentially it refers to unconventional cards that play with the traditional format, mechanics, and presentation of Hearthstone cards.
---
Let me know if these types of cards and post is something you enjoy. You can find more of these crazy cards in the album of submissions for [DIY cards](https://imgur.com/a/IeHCWHd) and the [Halloween cards.](https://imgur.com/a/BwNgUFe?) For the Halloween contest, we also had a number of submissions in the forms of GIFs that unfortunately couldn't be included but are definitely worth checking out:

Exactly!

Aww come on no BloodReaver Guldan, Skull of Manari, doomguard, voidlord, possessed lackey, carnivorous cube and spellstone?

---
oh .. okay. As I don't play HS (I'm an OW player) I didn't know about that. My apologies then.
---
Card text says deal 6 to the minion and it only dealt 2
---
Lol they sure did dude. They totally only do what China says. Such a smart little crazy person.
---
&gt; $500000(IIRC)
---
You recall incorrectly. It was $5,000 not $500,000, off by a factor of 100x
---
Correct, but it's better then blindly building an opinion based on either. The goal is to reach as high an accuracy as possible. Generally, if thousands agree there is some merit to an idea. But there can be many valid criticisms as well.
---
Anyone can be wrong, but seeing and evaluating a multitude of different positions gives you the most tools to reach accurate conclusions.

---
blizzard is a company who makes video games, i really don't give a shit what their political stances are. If they make a product I like, I buy it...
---
Tbh if this happened blizzard would just say something along the lines "we learned from the past banning is not the right course of action for a player to speak politically, we are in private talks with the player....." Or some bullshit excuse along those lines
---
Theres both side to that mindset. The antifa broke into shops stealing shits and somehow still think they are the warriors of justice. The same thing is happening in a lot of violent protest in the world. Some protesters forcefully demanded shop owners to provide supply because their cause was just and everyone who disagreed was the enemy of the people.
---
If one thing is fine if its on your side and not fine when it belongs to someone else, excuse me, but it does not remotely feel like being OBJECTIVELY right. 
---
You can talk about how you feel about it all days and please let me know if it changes anything without stooping so low into violence.
---
"Blizzard has the power to pick and choose which actions of their players are punishment worthy. I simply disagree that this player was worthy of the punishment he got. I don’t think what he did was wrong, and I think a lot of people agree with that. But our voices don’t matter when it is up to Blizzard to decide.”
---
These thoughts here are why protesters are incredibly misguided in their logic and why they have completely lost my support in "attacking" blizzard for their actions. When you start saying that you condone Blitzchangs actions you lose me. If you start putting VALUE in what was said rather than the fact that he said anything at all when evaluating the punishment it is a RECIPE FOR DISASTER and is far more egregious a policy than what they they already have in place!! If you disrupt a stream with a call to action political message (i don't care wtf it is) the company has a right to restrict that person's access to said company. If Blitzchung said "I SUPPORT NAZIS!" Then I'm sure everyone would support Blizzard in their decision. And I know Reddit doesn't want to admit it but if you are encouraging people to protest against a governemnt (for the right or wrong reasoons) it doesn't belong on a gaming stream. 
---
What's next we ask every contestant if they have any political agenda they would like to share at the end of their broadcast? how far is too far? Free Hong Kong is fine but what if he said Abortion is Wrong? What if he said He supports China? You start having to parce through all these politcal messages and decide which is more correct or worthy than another? It's just complete stupidity. 
---
Support Hong Kong! Support Democracy! And if you WANT to do that by breaking the rules FINE but don't CRY when there are consequences!
---
and i cant dust my wild cards in HS? can i do that in MTGA?  so which game got the more generous system?
---
*cough* look up *cough*
---
RIOT has asked people to not turn their platform into a political one, which is 100% okay. It's what Blizzard should have done when the whole thing started. 
---
"One of our tournament players made a political statement on stream. While we respect their belief we would ask players to not use our platform for political purpose and will be implementing a rule against this."
---
That's all Blizzard had to do, but they didn't. I don't know why RIOT doing it is "big yikes".
---
A lot of the people outraged have left. Sure people forget and drop it quickly, but some like myself have dropped blizzard games forever ( or until an apology that actually looks like an apology ). I dont write posts but I tell everyone I know that plays blizzard games what a sack of shit they are.
---
What forces you to play either of their games?
---
That's hilarious af.
---
So I looked into it and it does seem he did indeed have his winnings returned, so that's good.  And I'm sure you're right in that he's happy that his message was able to reach my people.  And as you've pointed out, other outside parties have stepped in to rectify the situation despite blizzard's efforts.
---
That being said, I still think a 6 month ban is highly punitive and is inconsistent given their track record of enforcing that very same policy (with arguably far, far worse offenders).  That's what annoys me.
---
The line is if it is profitable or not.
---
Even British government is calling for protesters to stop the violence, but go ahead you NPCs, keep supporting the terrorists.
---
&gt; Lmao they're going to lose like a thousand sales maybe because of this and it's merely a splash in the bucket of the millions of copies it's going to sell. You're doing nothing.
---
This is like the argument that your vote doesn't matter because your vote is one in hundreds of millions.  Sure, ultimately the margin of votes for a win will be more than one.  But, if everyone thinks the same and don't vote then it could have made a difference.  
---
In any case, it costs anyone who doesn't want to buy the game nothing.
---
&gt; This isn't even comparable and you know that. A living breathing horse is a huge financial commitment and don't even get me started on the time and care that would go into that. A video game is $60 and that's it. This is an idiotic analogy.
---
The point of the analogy was to show that kids will ask for anything - they don't understand any of the reasons why someone would or would not buy something.  They just know they want it.  Explaining to them that there can be good reasons to not buy something is important.
---
&gt; Hes forcing his own morals on his daughter. 
---
Where else should she get moral direction if not her parents?  Friends?  Teachers?  Celebrities?  Religion?  There are issues with all of these, but in general most people get their moral compass primarily from their parents.
---
In this case it's him not buying her the game... which would be him doing something against his will if he bought for her.  That would be her forcing him to ignore his morals.  Now, if she saves up the money and wants to buy it anyway and he won't let her, then that would be forcing his morals on her.  
---
&gt; He should also stop lying to her by telling her that if she doesn't play this game it's going to make a difference.
---
It's not about making a difference, it's about standing up for your beliefs.  He's not lying to her if he says something like "I don't want to buy Overwatch 2 because the company that creates it has come out in defense of China who has been trying to oppress and stifle anyone who disagrees with them.  Spending our money on their game feels to me like we are saying we are okay with that, which I am not."
---
If it did deal all 6 to the minion, there wouldn't be any excess.  Ever.
---
It’s pretty sad no one has conviction anymore.
---
Nice have it with warlock
---
The only way I see hearthstone 2.0 is to play cards live action eg videos of the amazingLP
---
Selective ignorance is never reasonable, let's just leave it at that.
---
keep overexplaining it with your so called realism:) 
---
it is the reason why the world progresses as it progresses
---
all these "lets be real" thoughts not daring to think, dream and hope
---
This, it’s the best of the bunch in my opinion. Still technically in beta and being updated/tweaked constantly.
---
"I'm gonna boycott an American company to express my opposition to China, and then I'm going to continue to give all my money to Chinese companies."
---
Every voice except Hong honk.
---
Quebec also.
---
Of course they *should,* the question is whether they'd actually do it.
---
I'd bet money they wouldn't.  Because that would piss off their Chinese overlords.
---
&gt;The casters would have employment contracts, I’m pretty sure they arent available for public view.    
---
They don't have to make it available to the public to give a justification as to why.  
---
They aren't producers, they're casters, announcers. What part of their behavior warranted any response toward them at all?
---
Thank you for weighing in on the morals of it
---
banning political statements is an implicit support of the status quo and is in itself a political statement
---
You mean a law that concerned only a niche of criminal and that has been cancelled? 
---
 
---
Look, I live in Macau, under the exact same system than HK, and people are not worried about China taking over in 2049, because 1 country 2 systems actually work there. 
---
 Don't try to fucking school me about a topic that directly concerns me, while you're living on the other side of the world.
---
Honestly I’ve stoped playing all Blizzard content. I was severely disappointed by the whole debacle.
---
I always give the example of changing an "R" rated movie to "PG-13" to reach a wider audience, nobody sees anything wrong with that.
---
And why aren't people pissed at the Germans for heavily censoring Wolfenstein games? Oh wait, it seems to be only bad when Blizzard changes their games for the Russia or Chinese markets.
---
What you mean finally? These just came out 😂
---
I have a pretty big collection of cards by now, and I play both Standard and Wild.
---
That means if I want to have a deck for each class for both modes, I already fill out 18 deck slots. And I usually play most classes, especially with Daily Quests...
---
that's a mighty convenient justification for everybody's shitty slacktivism, i like it
---
tell me more about how much of anarchy edge lord you are.
---
You know damn too well what happened to those so called “terrorists”, all the attacks against them (30.08 comes to mind, but there’s many more) and all the shit they endured from HKPF (the real terrorists).
---
It’s gone on far too long for them to back down now. 5 demands, not one less.
---
&gt; Boycotting something does not make you morally superior to other people.
---
When boycotting a company that is actively punishing its playerbase for speaking out against human rights violations, it 100% DOES make me morally superior to someone who chooses to support that company.
---
AFAIK, you've always had to submit the questions beforehand too.
---
Not much is changing. My guess is they're just going to weather the storm and hope that their announcements are louder than the rest.
---
Exactly. There is ultimately no ethical consumption under capitalism, but I can still make choices about how and what I consume. At the end of the day, I need to eat and drink and work for a living - but I don't need Overwatch or WoW. There are alternatives, both in video games as a hobby and in other entertainment activities altogether.
---
Yeah, you're an NPC. Keep farming the karma.
---
They were seen to have been involved in setting up Blitzchung to say his line (which is why they hid under the table), if the producers were also aware of this and were caught they would be punished too.
---
Hey! I'm the one who designed the shirt and raised the funds. Thanks so much for spreading awareness! Wear it loudly and proudly!
---
You were so proud of yourself for that you commented it twice huh
---
Gotta love how when the counter arguments to “don’t want politics in games” is just immediately changing the goalposts because you know you’re full of shit. If blizzard didn’t want politics they wouldn’t support LGBTQ+. Either human rights or political or they’re not it’s not that fucking hard.
---
Apparently it needed to be said twice
---
Murloc shaman wont get nerfed, dont worry.
---
The amount of people in here that are against hong kong is fucking gross.
---
It's the statement afterwards where Blizzard sucks the cock of the Chinese Communist Party that is incompatible with American values.
---
The CCP is nearly the same as Hitlers Nazi party or Stalins communist party in terms of how their values relate to ours.  It cannot be allowed to continue to exist.
---
It would be a shitshow if they confiscated anything, especially since Blizzcon is happening nowhere near HK or China.
---
The cynic in me says that they aren't taking any action because it would be bad PR, no other reason.
---
I was searching for a while, but this is the best I can find.

---
Ah first world commitment to a cause haha
---
Thanks all. Grandpa Joe is excited.
---
Any way to watch blizzcon without giving money to the chinese?
---
Only game that I'm still interested about (except hs ofc) is Diablo. I really want a good top down ARPG with a lots of depth to play. POE just isnt doing it for me
---
If it's 1% they would lose 1% which is in fact an impact. Whether that's significant enough for them to do anything that's a different topic.
---
Why be dismissive of people standing up for what they think is a poor business practice?
---
What are those random triangles on the board?
---
Did you catch madam Goya? She says replace and not summon I think so it may have slipped through
---
Some of the cards, even if they are discover or target randomly, are "good rng". Like nine lives, shadow visions, eternal servitude, gather your party, etc... Those are "rng" but can be manipulated trough deckbuilding or by seeing what happened trough the game. Those actually make you think if you should just yolo them or actually gimp your early/lategame, run less spells, etc.. in order to increase its inconsistency. Others like evolve, piloted shredder, etc... are simply random always and there is nothing you can do during deckbuilding or during the game, if piloted summons a doomsayer you got "*outplayed*" and if it summons millhouse, you "*outskilled*" your opponent.
---
You can literally respond to any atrocity with “ah but I can one up you” if you’re a stupid dipshit, the only response on that point is to never act on anything ever.
---
-the guy got over it
---
-they returned his prize money
---
-they state that they don't accept political protests on their events, so technically they're in the right here.
---
Fuck him too then, honestly.
---
That would be pretty exciting if the expansion dropped without revealing the cards though. The meta wouldn't be figured out as early and the theorycrafting would be practically applied earlier. People would try the weaker decks, resulting in a wider variety of decks on ladder.
---
done with battalion#1428 !
---
I’d say it’s more practical, do you really think they’re going to let people in it they’re wearing “Fuck blizzard” or “Xi is a cunt” shirts? 
---
This is a good balance of being subtle enough that Blizzard can’t really justifiably do anything about it, but also perfectly clear in intention and message.
---
They do this with a lot of cards though- I get this one has some slight mechanic differences but there are a lot of cards like this
---
WE STILL ARNT!!!!
---
And the real reason comes out; people are butthurt we might be 'right' and their subconscious tells them to attack people making a point because they don't boycott every single Chinese product. We're such hypocrits!
---
So it’s all or nothing then?  That’s an unreasonable metric to hold someone to because it means I’m responsible for things I don’t even know about. 
---
It’s amazing how principled people are when it comes to apathy. You don’t have to follow my lead but I think it’s foolish to give money to a company you disagree with. If apple gives me reason to dislike them then I will follow suit. Same goes for any other company. They all have different relationships and to just blanket it as if I support anything that has a hint of Chinese influence means I’m a hypocrite then I’m glad I don’t seek your approval. I’ll do what I find fits my beliefs best rather than set the bar to your level and end up doing nothing.
---
literally meaningless statement, just like their written statement...
---
The fact that my parental hearthstone facebook group bitched about how they can't watch hearthstone streams with their kids anymore, because their 10 year old looked up "hong kong revolution" and ended up looking at people get decked in the face  and other super violet bullshit, is exactly the reason why Blizzard was so pissed off by this. No one seems to fucking point out that he started talking about a highly violent event to an audience full of children.
---
In any other sports, hijackng a broadcast like this would of gotten him a harsher ban.
---
Don't worry the babies will never ever ever ever stop crying.
---
Gotta be ya boy Bob.
---
It is, which is why it's such an effective protest message. It's unabashedly pro-hong kong, but if Blizzard tries to silence the shirts (lol), they're effectively admitting that their corporate values are a complete shame. We already know this, but more evidence is always useful.
---
Free Hong Kong
---
Thats clear i get that hes taking blame for the mistake im curious to see what they plan on doing to fix the mistake. Rolling back the 1 year ban to 6 months is a start but they have a lot of goodwill to make up. I accepted the apology as genuine but i wanted to know what they are planning to do in the future to repay for the mistakes.
---
Literally nothing will ever make you guys happy.  Nothing.  Pointless to even apologize.  He should have started with "Blizzcon sucks the company is disbanding we're all going to kill ourselves now."  Would that make you happy?  Christ I hope you're the subject of an online lynch mob someday.
---
It's not about overpowered it just doesn't match the definition of what drawing from your deck means. It only refers to putting the top card of your deck into your hand.
---
Nothing would ever make you idiots happy.
---
[removed]
---
Oh yeah, I just mean usually stuff like this is high tension. I got punched at a rally in Washington yakno so always good to be careful
---
Probably the first and only druid 1000 portrait anyone will see for a long time.
---
Yea but what I’m saying is what’s the point. If it doesn’t majorly impact the power level of the card in any way, why not make the text so much cleaner and consistent?
---
Yea, the action taken was enforcing their existing policy against political grandstanding on their fucking video game streams.  If he held up a Trump 2020 or Sanders 2020 sign he'd get the same ban, would you babies be crying over that too?
---
Isn't that a little bit too free for some people? I ranked from 15 - 5 yesterday night on wild. For some one day of grinding a month is hella worth
---
To play devil's advocate, something better would be when there is stuff like lgbt(maybe law preventing lgbt people from getting married or discrimination) or race issue(nfl kneeling controversy) or even if there is a shooting in America/cop exerting excessive force since those are some of the hot topic in the us in the recent times. Would be interesting if they decided to ban those supporting/against statement or not since they said "no political" message.
---
Every voice matters except Uighurs , how are the Uighurs send to the camp any different than people being persecuted for being gay? I'm glad blizzard recent pr attempt backfired and just show that they are nothing than virtue signaller.
---
But Ancient Harbinger *isn't* an example of one of those cards. What are you not getting about this?
---
Crap design. Type some quasi-motivational crap on a gray t-shirt, add a flower; so deep.
---
Agreed. He was definitely burning some sort of clove; possibly wild berry.
---
People have lost the meaning the whole protests. 
---
As much as I would be in favor for Freedom for HK, the bans are still warranted because Blitz used his podium on Grandmasters to make a political message and NOT to talk about the game (you know, hearthstone).
---
Yes. 
---
There are also lot's of cards that summon tokens. And lots of cards that let you draw cards. And lots of cards that deal damage.
---
All of those are different effects, and as such have a different wording.
---
They do this with cards that explicitly are not supposed to trigger a draw mechanic
---
&gt; For the people of Hong Kong, not much, just a proof that they’re not the only ones against China.
---
Unless Hong Kong currently has no internet at all, I have a hard time taking this seriously.
---
&gt;For the world as a whole, it would set an example for other companies not to bow down to inhuman governments.
---
That would be a nice thought, but considering the US Government is selling arms to the country that funded the terrorists that did, 9/11 that's kinda hilarious.
---
&gt;Though people stopped caring
---
lol
---
&gt;China will have another battle “won”.

---
Yea because they broke rules against political grandstanding during their live broadcasts.  Go fucking figure.  Otherwise EVERY FUCKING EVENT will just be winners announcing the political candidates they support, demanding that abortion be banned or legalized everywhere, FREE CATALAN, FREE HONG KONG, FREE HEALTH CARE, LOWER TAXES, literally shut the hell up its a god damn video game.
---
Is Blizzcon outside?
---
It's similar to the NBA's apology, just more vague; sort of walking the line of what will China get pissed about neatly (since they had a few weeks to talk to China about it).
---
I guess encouraging a high level of demonstrable skill makes e-sports more viable, which in turn promotes the game and encourages purchases? Dunno. I'd like to see some sales reports right after the world championship ends. 
---
I was pretty much in the same boat as you, but I decided to climb this month (didn't make it super far, rank 12), and honestly it adds a level of adrenaline I found fun. Making my own decks was fun, but getting an optimized deck and learning how to play it and watching myself get better against different opponents was rewarding, too. 
---
Not saying that makes me more deserving of actual, hard rewards for playing the mode, but if you take your deck to Ranked expecting to get the same experience + rewards, well, of course you're going to be disappointed. The ladder is its own kind of fun, kind of like Arena is its own kind of fun. A different game, if you will. So it comes down to taste. Nothing stops you from stepping out for awhile the moment it stops being fun for you. As we're discussing here, the rewards aren't all that crazy. You can afford to pass them up.
---
Wow!
---
You were right!!!
---
so, you have become the devil?
---
The little tag says Made in China.
---
People naturally hate God because He is Holy and they are unrighteous.

---
new rogue hero!
---
IMO this shirt absolutely provokes conversation!
---
Crybabies?
---
What the heck was that trailer?
---
I am 100% sure it's not me missing the point, mate. Go buy your T-shirt and wear it around blizzcon and feel good about yourself because you're "standing up" to blizzard, while throwing money at them. This isn't activism. This is the most boiled down consumerist shit I have ever seen. Either stand up for Hong Kong or don't. Take a stand or don't. Whatever you do, don't try to avoid offending the fucking giant mega corporation that sold out the American ethos for money. Fuck Blizzard's decision, and fuck your smart ass non-abrasive reply implying I'm missing the point.
---
I really like the CoD font.
---
Kibler freaking out
---

If only he hadn't committed to defending the PRC's dignity at all costs...
---
As someone who has been with Heartstone since the early beta and playing it on a religious basis, I think this is where I draw the line. Expansions are coming out faster than one can keep up and it’s turning this game into a cash cow. 
---
Makes me sad to see it evolve into this.
---
No!!! It's another hero card, i mean i'm happy about the new expansion and all, but we need something new, not old mechanics refreshed.
---
whats invoke?
---
Fair enough, but I suspect that things getting violent is the literal last thing Blizzard wants at this point. I suspect they're going to do absolutely everything in their power to make sure things are as calm as possible.
---
Open your packs
---
Yup, no idea what that symbol is and if you dont follow this controversy you'll just think its a nice message on a shirt
---
Rogue hero? Is there a tie here, warcraft people?
---
Tell me, what plans have you made to disrupt blizzcon that will interfere significantly with their business and won’t result in you immediately being silenced and kicked out of the venue? Or are you just sitting at home criticising other people who are *actually doing something*?
---
I hope we’ll see you onscreen doing something radical this weekend, otherwise you would be awfully hypocritical now wouldn’t you : )
---
Galakrond has a different battlecry and hero power in each of the evil classes.
---
The panel in 3.5 hours has more details.
---
RIP Warlock
---
When you would play Nefarian vs Nefarian, he would call himself a Warlock.
---
Once its your hero, that Galakrond will still trigger the Hero Power effect when you Invoke.  If you somehow play a different Galakrond on top of it, you get the bonus from that one instead.
---
the market research of looking at the twitch stats for TFT versus hearthstone the last few months
---
That does not in any way answer the question.
---
How does that make the world better specifically for the people of Hong Kong?
---
Okay thank you
---
There are at least 20 of them on the front page right now...
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards?set=descent-of-dragons
---
It's not that many words!
---
And you reply also had a lot more words than the simple answer to the question I asked.
---
Also makes me think you don't know what you're talking about.
---
It's some kind of Elvish...
---
When every corporation in the west can cash in on gay pride for easy money with no blowback, it isn't politics.  It's marketing.  
---
You're just demanding that Blizzard market more directly to you by taking controversial political stances that you like.
---
more free stuff is always good,  just more content and quality of life improvements and hs is on the right way
---
it's the catch 22: when all the cards are too broken you get formats like we have now where it's super polarizing but when they are too fair they don't change the previous meta
---
warbot was in loads of decks. It wasn't the strongest card in any of them, but it saw plenty of play.
---
Anyone else read this as 'Dragonblurst Cultist' ? =/
---
There is zero reason to play this over TFT. It looks like dog crap compared to TFT visually and unless the gameplay is WAY superior (and I would bet anything it won't be) I don't see any reason to play it.
---
Yeah I know, yet so many in this thread are somehow appeased by a PR statement made by their PR firm. It's absurd reading it, nothing was done, they're still banning players for not praising China.
---
How about the U.S government stop sucking chinas dick and stand up to the hong kongers instead off having companies do it for them.
---
And where did blizzard say they support what china is doing? are you going by the Weibo post that the chinese company netease made.
---
Don't compare how the situation is for the hong kongers to something thats mild, the chinese government have sent people to hurt and or kill protesters and when shit have gone that far companise can't sweap it under the rug and just take a quick talk with the player afterwards.
---
Why did you feel that you had to go personal at the end? to feel superior or what? no where did I ever imply that "one person wont make a difference" I said that when it the people against a government no company can really help at that point, only other government can help as they are not looked like small shits in chinas eyes.
---
On the shill point, I don't play any off blizzards games, the only game I play is guild wars 2, just because someone brings up neutral things about a topic dosen't make it a shill just because you don't like it
---
I blamed capitalism for Blizzards actions. Which believe it or not has nothing to do with China being communist.
---
Sorry we disapprove of American corporations bowing down to genocidal authoritarian regimes. Let's just pretend it never happened.
---
Go fuck yourself, Chinese troll.
---
I really like this song. Not as much as the Uldum one, but still, really good.
---
Will they have different art?
---
Thank God druid gets ramp back.
---
I didn't say anything about whether I support the status quo or not, just a statement on the nature of 'apolitical' statements like what I was replying to
---
Turn 10 value alongside Pogo Hopper? Probably not, but hey it's a demon that syngergises with a mech and you don't see that every day.

---
WAHHHH EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME IS A CHINESE SHILL
---
&gt; There is an awkward interaction that you need the dragons early on though
---
I think the math works out that you need about 8 dragons in you deck to have on in hand for turn 2
---
Blizzards flaw wasn’t in the stance they took, it was the message they sent in their attempt to remain neutral.  Their a fucking gaming company, not your local senator.  If you don’t understand what happened, try listening instead of figuratively yelling over others.  Blizzard has no responsibility to push your, or anyone else’s, political ideology.  They are entertainment and their desire is to bring people together.
---
Thanks bud
---
No more *infinite value* Hero cards...
---
we’ll see how they Crystal Core it this time around.
---
I will definitely pick this one over TFT and Autochess. Why? Because I know all of the cards. I have never played League or Dota so i don't know the heroes or items. That would be a much steeper learning curve for me.
---
I agree with what you are saying. You’re barking up the wrong tree. Confucianism is still very real in 2019, albeit a bit altered to ensure that government and bureaucracy is at the top. All of the basic tenders of unity, respect, and obedience are still there.
---
The Priest dragon practically wipes your opponent’s board, and this summons Witchwood Imps?
---
Warlock has been way too underpowered this year.
---
You read a tooltip once or twice, and you should remember it. Meanwhile, you make maintainability worse because you have the same effect worded differently.
---
As a plus and a minus, it means cards don't interact like they otherwise might. If you're playing wild and get Mistwraith and Witch's Brew randomly generated, they don't work together. This can prevent unexpected powerful interactions, but can also prevent fair and potentially interesting interactions.

Looks like the theme for hunter this time around is, "You miss 100% of the steady shots you never take".
---
most people were looking for an excuse to jump back on blizzard's ship and only joined the righteous hatetrain for attention and back pats
---
this is how slacktivism works and it's both infuriating AND not worth getting mad over
---
Wait shit that could actually really strong
---
2 mana draw 1 strong????? It's worse than shiv XD
---
this card ramps you toward the big dragon you have in hand
---
I don't really care about the competitive viability of a Ysera/Dragon themed druid deck, it simply sounds like a lot of fun to be playing a themed deck constructed around this idea.
---
Worst case scenario, it is 2 mana cycle a card, but in the decks that want to play this it will more often be an un-nerfed wild growth that also draws 1. The only downside is you'll need a (often expensive, unless "Hello Friend") dragon in hand to use it early, which actually helps balance the card.
---
This is a big deal I know some people arnt going to accept it because any apology to us on stage during a live event is fake but an apology online to China is real and heart felt. I don't know what people really want them to do at this point. Should they just cease business with China? Blizzard isn't in bed with Chinese government they just didn't want to lose an overwhelming portion of their audience
---
Depends on the mull. Ramp can not afford to keep late game.
---
!remindme 3 hours
---
Bruhh
---
REALLY? SHOCKED
---
Either it's bad, and won't see play (thus, useless)
---
Or it's good, and your opponent will sometimes get nothing, sometimes get 3 * giant dragons in a row. 
---
I definitely hope it's gonna be the former.
---
Enough freaking MASSIVE rng swings that win games on their own... It's not fun when you're on the losing end of the RNG, and it's undeserved when you're on the winning end.
---
It's not even broken or fair, it's *interesting.* You know, cards that are fun to play, cards that inspire new deck ideas. Absolutely nothing they've shown so far, not a single card, has made me think "wow that looks fun!" It's just more derivative stuff that they've done a million times already.
---
Grandpa Joe didnt deserve it
---
I play control warrior lol. I think for me all the shamans is just so annoying right now. I've vs'd like 10 in a row now. Just because I win dosn't make it fun. :(

That... Doesn't make sense symbolically. The flower is HK's flag. Why would it wilt once demands are met? Symbolically, shouldn't it bloom because Hong Kong is blossoming again after all 5 demands are met.
---
No doubt.
---
I can't wait to see someone win a tournament by randomly getting 2 Deathwings in a row.
---
Hopefully the card is bad so it's not played and this never happens...
---
Yeah, variability in games is really nice. Hopefully all the new dragons will make it more fun!!!
---
They could say they support HK and human rights following their values as an American based company. They could apologize to blizzard employees. They could say they're separating from activision. They could reverse their decision on the bans. They could actively follow through with these words instead of silencing collegiate teams and kicking people saying free HK out of blizzcon.
---
The new preorder bundles are way better than the previous one's we've gotten so thats a good deal looking into the next set at least
---
Oh cool! They do have different art!
---
You get matched up with a different opponent each round. So during a round each person is paired up with a random opponent and battle commences.
---
This seems stronger than the invoke class cards.
---
5 mana 4/5 taunt is by default a lot stronger than 1 mana give a minion +1 attack, or 3 mana x/1 where x is number of minions including this one.
---
Why is the neutral one so much stronger?
---
you're forgetting one minor detail, no one is playing the "better" version anymore.
---
fuck off
---
i remember years ago when a guy was talking about Dragon Druid in r/customhearthstone and people mocked his idea
---
Let me answer your questions then; 
---
None of your current mainstream politicians are leftists. What you have are politicians who are center, or center left-leaning at best.
---
Leftist doesn't mean anyone who is left-leaning, it has a specific meaning and doesn't apply to Bernie Sanders just because he advocates for higher taxes on the rich, and medicare for all.
---
For comparison, that'll be like me calling all right-wingers far-right/alt-right/nazis and so on, just because they identify with one wing of the political spectrum.
---
Hey, they needed that long for someone to come up with an idea they could copy.....
---
Mech decks, sure, but those weren't really used much at all.  Warrior had better options for face decks at the time as well.
---
Okay let the metas be figured out within The first few weeks, just like standard and wild.
---
it’ll be a lot more healthy then waiting 3-5 months for a new expansion to barley shake up the meta.
---
Yikes, why is this a rare?
---
We also get a Free Class Dragon on top of that too!
---
This has no substance. Feels bad man
---
I dont care if it sucks man I'm rank 5 for life. It's where all the fun decks are. If I cared about legend I'd just play snip snap warlock for 5 hours a day.
---
Flamestrike hits up to 7 minions for 7 Mana.  This hits up to 3 minions for 3 Mana!  It's a powerful card and people are going to have to be careful with board position when they play against Shaman.
---
So banning Blitzchung for supporting the Hong Kong protests is not a political stance? If they didn’t have a political stance wouldn’t the best thing for them to do is not ban him at all? I’m sorry you see the contradiction here, right?
---
Umm those fan boys never cared to begin with.
---
It's you typing those boycott threads so...
---
(Lucentbark Nuts)
---
Except for the Chinese voices apparently.
---
I'm at work what is this
---
Tank up gained so much tempo
---
By showing further support for their fight for democracy. Also, the bigger of an international fuss is made about China's actions, the greater the possibility of them backing off.
---
I think it was sold out before blizzard  fucked up.
---
Just because you know who to direct outrage to doesn't mean you have to troll... something's gotta be real fucked up with you lol.
---
Yes, that's one possibility.
---
without the condition
---
The article states that Invoke cards can't be discovered, so its likely they'll be like the C'thun cards and will not be in Arena.
---
This card is like a 7 stars card. It's (pre-nerf) wild growth on steroids. 
---
I'm sure there will be good dragons to run, but even if there weren't, druids would play pretty much any dragon to play this card. It's THAT broken.
---
Add a lackey, summon imps so far.
---
I’m actually moving to a higher floor.
---
I think you’ve been misinformed.
---
Lol Wild does, but standard? There are no 8-cost dragons until this set comes out...
---
Lol fucking stupid.  So fucking stupid.  On so many levels.
---
&gt;They could say they support HK and human rights following their values as an American based company. 
---
And get completely banned from the Chinese market, losing thousands of people their jobs instantly.
---
&gt; They could apologize to blizzard employees. 
---
Apologize to all the ones who just got fired for taking your stupid position?  Or apologize to the Blizzard employees who generally support the enforcement of their preexisting policy, the violation of which has completely fucked them up?  How about we have Blitzchung apologize to Blizzard employees for completely fucking them over to do political grandstanding on their video game stream?
---
&gt;They could say they're separating from activision.
---
You're a fucking moron who doesn't know how corporations work, they aren't "separable" you dumbass.
---
Holy christ this boycott has attracted the dumbest fucking slacktivists on the planet.
---
If you are referring to Slay the Spire I still play it regularly and haven't played Dungeon Run since Monster Hunt (other than checking out the free DH run to see if the new stuff was worth paying for, it definitely wasn't).
---
I could certainly be in the minority for all I know though.
---
Yes.
---
But the iron fleet certainly hasn't forgotten about Galakrond
---
How the hell is this not tournament mode? This game was everything i played for years and it wiffed away from me after waiting for eternity for a tournament mode.
---
Crazy world
---
Some cards have a new battle cry which applies one stack of invoke, it affects cards like this one and the new hero cards
---
So what powers do unions have that haven't involved the weight of the threat of striking? Do you really not in any way understand how they work or where their power comes from?
---
B/c their opinion is clearly superior and 99% of the community agrees with them. Duh!
---
just like zola and banker this will probabkly be played in all highlander decks to get more copies of cards
---
It just might be!
---
&gt;and he even said himself that he's not sure about returning to HS after what happened.  
---
That's bullshit fluff and you know it.  He just signed with Tempostorm so not really the move of someone who doesn't know what they're future may be.
---
&gt;But they clearly ask him if he's ready to do his thing. They knew ahead of time he was going to put the mask on.    
---
Chung came on the stream wearing the mask already. The casters just said to go ahead and say what he wanted to say.    
---
 &gt; But they facilitated the use of the stream for political activism.   
---
They didn't facilitate anything. They don't run the stream. You don't blame your server for your food being burnt.   
---
&gt; So what's the alternative? If they did nothing and just let it go, there was a chance that it would make news and now the company is labeled as having its grand champion being a face for the protests in Hong Kong.    
---
They issue an appropriate punishment to the player?
---
&gt; A noble thing to be known for in Western demographics, but how about the Chinese market?   
---
 I mean that's the Crux of the argument right? The protests are happening because a bill was trying to allow China to extradite people in Hong Kong providing the wall in China. so allowing people to be extradited to a country with no freedom of speech at all that is known to harvest organs from prisoners.  
---
Blizzard's initial reaction was absolutely done to protect potential growth in China. You're 100% right. And since their goal was to protect dental growth and try not, they did what they should be doing for that.   
---
The controversy, the reason people are mad, and the reason people are leaving, is because blizzard went way beyond reasonable punishment of a player and casters to appease the Chinese government.   
---
so I don't really know how to respond to this part of your post, because you're right. And that's why everyone is mad. it doesn't matter that it's the correct move for profit, it is by far the wrong move for morality or public opinion.   
---
And if you want to wear, to put in perspective how big of an issue this has been, US governors in both parties have spoken out on this and directly addressed blizzard for their actions. It's a big enough issue that it's crossing party lines.   
---
&gt; I've heard people say the company has a responsibility to use their fame and power to stand for what's right, but that same logic means Blitzchung has a responsibility to represent the company.   
---
The people who say that are idealistic idiots. This is business, they don't have to do anything other than make profit. But the reality is, because we live in a country the free speech, we can say fuck you and forgo any business with the company. And we can do this for any reason. We can also encourage others to do the same because that's how the free market works.   That's good old fashioned capitalism.  
---
so every single person who bashes blizzard, called them out, quits, and encourages everyone else to do so, are absolutely within the right to do so. Just as blizzard was in there right to do what they did.   
---
it's not an issue of what you can or can't do, it's an issue of what's right wrong, which is something determined by your perspective.   
---
&gt;The whole situation was lose lose for Blizzard Activision. It could have been prevented if the casters told the guy, naw better not do that on camera.    
---
It was absolutely a lose lose situation for blizzard. So they chose what they believe to be the best route. The people are mad because they chose that based on shutting down someone speaking for freedom from oppression.  and while that makes sense wrong business and point, they also have to take responsibility for that action. Which means dealing with this trash fire PR they started.
---
It always sells out in like 20 minutes.
---
It could be a good zoo card I guess. Does blizzard hate control warlock or something? They’ve been only pushing zoo and plot twist which is absolutely terrible.
---
Yeah Blizzard profits off these people, so what? Does Blizzard making money somehow worsen the situation in China?
---
Most current board states have a bunch of piddly 1/1’s and 1/2’s laying around. So this might not be as bad as it looks.
---
If you can reliably set it up where you’re using it to push through a taunt or getting 2 for 1 trades with it with lackeys, then it’s not nearly as bad.
---
If blizzard removed people for that they'd be in even deeper water. They've explicitly stated that they wont remove anyone for supporting hong kong. Their best shot at this is to let it blow over, not actively side themselves with China, even if they are actually sided with china.
---
USA has some pretty good perks ngl
---
Blizzcon tickets and probably most plane tickets in that time window are non refundable. They're really sticking it to them by just pissing away money instead of going there to protest in person.

Sorry for terrible quality but I couldn't find it anywhere else, reposted because I forgot the flair
---
7 mana body, but 7 free dragons is a crap ton of value, even with low rolling. 
---
Even drawing one dragon makes up the rest of the 2 mana in cost.
---
Remember that we also got a dragon synergy draw/ramp card in the form of Dream Breath.
---
3/5. Has potential, even in just a Control Druid package.
---
This card will absolutely see play. It’s easy value especially late game.
---
The point is they are not "listening to the community" or "making the game more accessible", it's a ploy to bring people back.  It's a one time deal, it will be gone come next expansion.
---
I'm here for unrelated work, so I'm not going to join the protests. But judging the atmosphere, Blizzard is doing just fine. The protest wasn't as big as I hoped it would be :(
---
this expansion look like powercreep to another level. more like Kft level if not even higher
---
Why are people saying this is weak? Counting in any class exclusive dragons the RNG is ridiculous in what swing turns this could make.
---
Collective bargaining works because of the implicit threat that all of your workers will strike if you do not conduct fair negotiations.

Sit ins and boycotts have literally never done a damn thing except for when sit ins were saturated enough to physically make a business unusable by means of too many physical bodies in the way.    
---
Leverage exists when a collective has an actionable means to punish a government or company, not when a bunch of redditors agree that they're mad and don't know what to do about it other than complain and wear t shirts.
---
Check out the Battlegrounds mode, brand new way to play the game
---
Do side quests start in your hand? If it’s anything like a side piece you should have to get lucky to get one.
---
&gt; This is something every player can benefit from and enjoy (hopefully) and is rightfully prioritized
---
I feel like people who don't want a Tournament mode, don't know what a Tournament mode even is.
---
Yeah, because the one archetype that's totally been missing from the meta, which everyone missed and really wanted to see more of, was fucking Secret Hunter. ^/s
---
"We did it Reddit" became a meme after Reddit drove someone to kill themself. It's not about the lack of impact Reddit has, it's about the exact opposite.
---
I'm liking this hero Hunter archetype
---
I don't care if i get downvoted for this, but thank god i stopped spending money on this game, honestly the best decision i've made.. not even a year since the ''no more infinite value cards and hero cards'' blog and then we get this.. jesus this company.
---
So, ‘kill everything’ Priest? Then.... win?
---
Boycotting Blizzard does absolutely nothing for HongKong.
---
Soo shall we just go down the discussion pointing out that replys are disagreeing  with eachother?
---
Isn't that basically C'thun all over?
---
It would be more like
---
I can save the planet
---
By spamming Reddit with memes about recycling
---
With Magic though if it’s an uncommon keyword they’ll still need to spell out what it does on the card, since there are no keywords.
---
A missing hero portrait doesn't prevent playing the game like a missing card would imo
---
isnt this a pseudo nomi? without restriction so more flexible?
---
Brode said Soggoth was one of his favorite designed cards
---
Standards have really fallen since then :/
---
I don’t know if this going to be good honestly. Priest has good board cleats and single target cleats and it makes me think that this card is way too weak even with the invoke term. 
---
Anyone else feel the same way?
---
 **I present to you... THE \^\^second LUCKIEST BANE OF DOOM IN THE HISTORY OF HEARTHSTONE!**
---
There is no freedom in Hongkong?
---
7 Mana to;
---
Deal 6 to face
---
Summon 3 1/1s
---
Deal another 6 to face if they trade
---
So lots of value
---
I would be surprised if we did because were already getting 5 free Galakrond legendaries
---
but only to people who pre-purchase right?
---
&gt; How exactly is what he said "centrist,"
---
It's a middling opinion between stating your opinion (ie scorched Earth), and not stating your opinion at all (ie keep politics out of it entirely).
---
It’s a full blown circlejerk at that point. Before the BlitChung situation that sub was dead as hell.
---
Kibler's wet dream
---
Predictable and boring hp imo
---
Anyway did impferno saw play? That's why I don't think it will do either (it's still a better card tho)
---
That guy reminds me of Michael Clark Duncan.
---
Thanks, I saw that vid but missed the card.
---
We'll know what the Priest Invoke does maybe once the next panel starts in 15 minutes.  So far it seems to be related to priest minions.
---
* Choose successful type of a game
---
* Add it to your own universe and make it as polish and easy to play as possible
---
* profit
---
*Blizzard's recipe of making shit ton of money*
---
If Dragon Druid is a thing, this card is going to be VERY good.
---
That guy reminds me for Michael Clarke Duncan.
---
Oh shit, Shieldbreaker value!
---
That is not centrist in any way
---
A dedicated player?
---
Not sure why she’s wearing T11 hunter bracers
---
So Blizzard should have this planned. They have the resources, so it would be a no brainer to hire and train your own actors. They make massive, sweeping stories and gigantic game worlds, so constructing a plausible scenario in which they can display their virtues wouldn't be that much different.
---
Forgetting other cards/synergies/etc, this has got to be up there as one of the strongest single cards ever printed
---
They can play the whole song - that's how long the animation is going to take anyway.
---
Soggoth was honestly awful to begin with. I think he only saw play in Jungle Giants Druid. 
---
This is a huge powercreep.
---
I have made over 8 accounts just myself. We don’t know how many of 100 million accounts are active. Plenty of people made multiple accounts to get Murloc Shaman hero.
---
And do you really think this sub is special or different? You look at the sentiments on YouTube, the official forums, etc. it always mirrors this sub. Even the Asian sites and communities.
---
This idea that there is supposedly some silent majority that just avoids any online community despite playing a mobile game is ridiculous. And even if that were true, how would Blizz then presume to k ow what they want if they are apparently not voicing it anywhere online?
---
That’s is not a strawman, slippery slope maybe or a hasty generalization
---
In a ramp deck?
---
Makes sense.
---
Aligning incentives with ethics if possible is an effective way to produce ethical behavior. That is not the same as incentives being not aligned making something ethically fine. That actions that profit you can be unethical is kinda the point of having ethics. There is nothing illogical about criticizing unethical behavior without ensuring that it isn't a disadvantage to be ethical. Doing that is a strategy to ensure ethical behavior. Not following a specific strategy does not make criticizing bad behavior as bad illogical. 
---
It might be a bad strategical decision to not try to social engineer wanted behavior. But the common sentiment that for companies you can't blame them for doing shitty stuff because they are a company and will maximize profit at any costs is annoying. When talking about ethics on a person level we don't go "you can't criticize him for that it is advantageous for him to do that"  we might go "We should avoid creating perverse incentives" but that isn't the same as absolving the person doing the negative thing from responsibility, it is just a strategy to make people do it less.
---
(Also I don't think him acting against the streamer, not blizzard, would be that much of a problem for blizzard.)
---
6 mana 3/5 deal 7 damage to the enemy hero
---
And people on here think this won't be 5 stars.  lul
---
Do we know what the hero power actually does yet? So far, I've seen it add a Reckless Experimenter and a Princess Talanji to the player's hand (on separate Invocations). I'm not sure what the common bond is yet, but if the average quality of card you get is decent, this seems like it could be pretty good in a deck that looks to generate lots of resources in the late game.
---
Probably Bobby Kotick's direct order to create a counter to all the new Auto-chess clones. Hearthstone team got the permission to build one?
---
&gt; Centrist: having moderate political views or policies.
---
It's centrist as it is a moderate take between two "extreme" ends.
---
Me too,I was really tempted though
---
I have Nozari. Hopefully she shines in this expansion. Otherwise I literally did not play her on Standard at all.
---
&gt;I’m just competitive in everything I get into whether it be my hobbies or work.
---
Same here. i feel you. OCD like. cant let go after loss.   
---
this game is really cancerous. unfair RNG.
---
Doesn't matter. They need shirts that thoroughly get the point across the people who may not be following the news. Those people should be wondering, "What's up with all these shirts explicitly about Hong Kong?", not, "What are those vague shirts with some symbol I don't recognize?" That latter group is far bigger than you'd think. Not everyone gets your vague statements. There are a lot of folks out there who don't follow, or care to follow, such news. You have to be explicit.
---
seems fine to me.
---
Invoke is a keyword that directly correlates to Galakrond. Each of the EVIL classes will get a different version of Galakrond as a Hero card. The first Galakrond that happens to be in your hand or deck becomes 'Your Galakrond' (9 times out of ten it'll just be the Galakrond you put in your deck list, but sometimes you might randomly generate one, too). Every time you play an 'Invoke' card, it will both upgrade the power level of Your Galakrond's Battlecry, and immediately activate the effect of Your Galakrond's Hero Power. For example, the effect of the Rogue Galakrond's Hero Power is add a Lackey to your hand. So if Your Galakrond is the Rogue Galakrond, and you play an Invoke card, you will add a Lackey to your hand.
