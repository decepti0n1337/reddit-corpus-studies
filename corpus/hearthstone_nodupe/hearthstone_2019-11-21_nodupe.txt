The chances of 1/8 people not needing the entire time is so remotely low it makes no sense to add one, you would just rage about that.

---
Everyone's talking about the OG stuff, but I started HS last year and OG for me and my only deck was Fire Imp-Coin-Voodoo Doctor-Happy Ghoul-Happy Ghoul.
---
Had to take prep instead of another step on the spell lackey towards the end cause was running out of time sadly. Still the biggest Edwin I've ever made / seen.
---
Getting close to that "Flip a coin each turn. If tails, you lose" brawl.
---
Yeah but then you’d say that’s bad design or oppressively unfun, but not just oppressive which implies it’s oppressive within the meta which is far from the truth
---
I like playing her. I like to use it on token (minion that spawn a minion) and then snowballing by selling the extra minion and buying a card from the same field in early level. It's basically strong early. Turn 2, freeze a 2/1 murloc and a 2/4 taunt to become 3/2 and 3/5.
---

---
Downside may be no nightmare but you could also take advantage of extra minion that are crummy in stat to be greedy. Rank up , sell, reroll. 
---
Rank 3 6/3 divine shield minion can be a 7/4 early on just by using this tactic. Its pretty rng but a 1/1 buff blanket is nice.
---
It's especially nice in late game when you reroll but cannot buy until next round on triples or magnet card. The freeze stacks too so if you freeze for two turn it's 2/2.
---
Ree ree!
---
They literally broke standard and perfectly okay letting it stay broken. Idk what you expect from a team who doesn't care anymore.
---
It's a quality of life feature that makes a lot of sense. And the main hs game already has this feature, hopefully it doesn't take much coding to get it in to battlegrds.
---
Its beta, rewards may come later ?  
---
I don't see how you consider it the same. I also don't see how you consider all the other modes the same already.

FOOOOOOOOLLLS
---
Shit, I recently sold that Amalgam wuite early by accident because I had to rush my turn and I still ended up winning. The early game advantage with fast tiering can really make a big difference.
---
But in Standard/ladder it is obvious what I am conceding. In Battlegrounds it is not as obvious whether it is the round or the "tournament". Actually, instead of a "are you sure?" they could just change the button text to "Leave Battlegrounds"
---
I'll try and ask him. Patches at 1 mana to pop bubbles I can understand, but 2 mana to pop 2 random bubbles is so bad
---
i've seen it in every game. it is especially visible when you make it to the end game. You start seeing those amalgams showing up again or lightfang enforcers when people that had them die. Remember that a triple holds 3 copies so if someone has a golden card means they removed from the pool 3 cards. it is often the case that people are also holding on to cards just to deny others getting them. I certainly do that in most games when i reach top 4. Certainly not gonna let that other player get a golden junkbot for ex if they already have one or two. if i can spare the gold i'll buy it and keep it. 
---
Also it's a time based thing, in the sense that people refresh the cards in the same time window as you do so maybe you're not seeing the card because they snatched it before you could refresh and maybe find it. The cards you were looking for may also be rare. Like the T6 cards are 3% chance to find for ex
---
but most likely people are holding on to cards. in the late game it certainly happens a lot
---
Yeah, but it's not obvious I just HAPPENED to notice it and was able to guess the rest hence my comment confirming. Needs to be actually mentioned. I didn't know and have literally gone every round refreshing looking for 1 or 2 minions in particular.
---
I love Hobbs so much. One of first people to get me into hearthstone
---
Are people deciding not to use r/BobsTavern ?
---
I mean.....I play all the time on my iPhone. It's fine. I get wins, I get top 4's, I rarely (if ever) feel like I'm unable to do what I want.
---
You've had swings of over 400 points?
---
I guess it fits in with there "class identity" lol
---
Lightfang, lightfang, lightfang
---
Because you are equally as likely to get amalgam as your opponents are, but you have the 3/4 plus your 1/1. Simply saying people have the option to get amalgam doesn’t even the playing field, because that applies to you just as much as them. 
---
You should be looking for cards that buff three or more minion types each use as much as possible, and then both of those will count as whatever minion types you don’t have the board, guaranteeing you get the most stats possible per card used. 
---
I agree it isn’t intuitive, and I thought he would suck compared to other heroes which have a more apparent consistent benefit, but any evaluation like that ignores how much buffs that 1/1 can pick up throughout the game, which is an insanely high number that will often result in more benefit than the other heroes’ powers.
---
Alexstrasza and hunter seems like a stretch tho,kinda like putting malygos as a paladin card.
---
Turn 1. 2 of the same minions. Don't fall for freezing.
---
I left Hearthstone going on my phone - hit my sleep button and walked away. I came back 2 hours later and tried to unlock my phone and it took me about 2 minutes because of constant blackscreens. The game literally was fucking with me opening my phone, while it was in the offline/dc screen.
---
Amalgam amalgam amalgam need I go on?
---
Buy instead of upgrading tavern turn 2. The tier 2 minions are just so much better
---
Hold up they all gold!
---
HS already said ON REDDIT that they are working on something right now to compensate. Took minimal effort to find too
---
It's not a bug, it's him clicking wrong and to fast. 
---
There is no reason to wait to the end of the rope to start your turn and with double battlecry it takes even longer
---
High key amalgam should be at least 4 star
---
i've had this exact situation happen to me as well except the fact that she for some reason used it to heal herself 1 or 2 hp instead of damaging me, guess it was because she could heal herself that she prioritized it instead of damage no matter how much it would cripple me
---
I think the format becomes boring without it.  A lot of cards you can't select because they aren't from your tribe.
---
RIP
---
That is exactly what I imagined, thanks!
---
Whichever with free speech?
---
So you mean that when animations aren't finished, minions SHOULD be in a different place on the board than they are displayed? That this is the way the game is supposed to work?
---
You're REALLY saying that when you place minion on the board, you see it right there on your screen, but it really is somewhere else, it's working correctly?
---
Because I'm pretty damn sure that it's not an intended behavior = bug.
---
You sold baby amalgam :(
---
I have an exit strategy in mind. In the last patch they should have included some small balance changes and one of them should have been something along the lines of increasing the mana cost of the event version of evolve, which disappears in a few weeks anyways. But maybe that was the plan but making standard interesting again could have potentially hurt the launch of battlegrounds.
---
just remove them from the hero pool then
---
Yee haw
---
Coin, kalecgos, concede
---
This. I hellfired a board that killed 6 minions with DRs... It took like 6 minutes for the turn to end
---
I think it's related to the touch keyboard. The search box moves to the top to get out of the way of the touch keyboard (even though the touch keyboard isn't going to come up because you have a keyboard connected). If you're playing on a device without a touchscreen, the search box never moves and everything's great.
---
You do know you can play cards and minions despite animations haven't finished? So ofc they will move.
---
Heads up!!!
---
Zenoes#1463 NA I show u go first
---
I think it really depends on which minion it is and which hero you are playing. With Stitches, for example, you have that extra health to play around a bit more. At level 1, you have a much smaller minion pool, so getting a triple is much easier - for a minion that you can upgrade and play into late game, it can definitely be worth the gamble, imo.
---
How are you getting +60 for 3rd?! I just got +47 for 1st and I'm 4500.
---
I think because memes?
---
Why do you say “funny toe” at the end
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
i think people said that it will only be in effect after 1 match played.

#**YOU FACE JARAXXUS, ERADAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION**
---
Or make it so he gets the buff when he kills a minion that attacks him instead of only when he attacks.  That way he could get huge off rats or microbots spawned by enemy deathrattles if you gave him taunt.  Big minions are still vulnerable to poisonous though which is why divine shield mechs are so good
---
Other than the title obstructing enemy minion stats, I could still play cards and target them as normal.
---
It was like I was trapped in a Hearthstone ad.
---
What are you talking about? If i place it between the 5 and 6 minion it should appear there when it does exist
---
You might find that vocalising your thought process actually helps you process your options and make you think about lines you hadn't considered.
---
? Why tho?
---
I wanna go out on my own terms and those terms are a ban
---
why not just unsub?
---
Thank you /u/Iraqlobster5, Very Cool!
---
Thrall, desert hare, evolve
---
Plz report I’ve been trying to get banned all day nothing’s working I’m giving up hope
---
I agree with this, no.
---
I'm curious why this would choose to include cards included in the wild event but still exclude the Legendaries included. Shaku seems like it'd fit in the Rogue deck just fine, and Rag and Sylvanas could probably be splashed into several of these.
---
No
---
Because it’s less fun 😞 I wanna go out with a ban please help
---
Bitch
---
Menagerie can generally be transitioned into pretty easily though, unless it's the late game, but then they aren't that effective then anyways.  If you aim for brann or lightfang you can pull off a menagerie build somewhat consistently, and if you don't get them early enough you've (hopefully) been picking strong minions that allow you to transition out while keeping a decent health total.
---
You forgot sensing demons for the perfect curve.
---
what
---
Don't you mean harder, not easier?
---
Playing a few games wont bring your tiny skills back. You need to rage less and be more consistant. Since you are around rank 15 you have no expirience at all
---
Cobalt guardian is definitely a T1 card, no doubt about it. It’s not quite as game breaking as amalgam and lightfang tho. Those two deserve your ire a bit more. 
---
Cobalt also suffers against tokens summoned from deathrattles. Standard passage of play should only give the guardian 2-3 hits. If 1 gets wasted on a ping and 1 on a divine shield &amp; taunt minion of your own, you’re just fine. 
---
There are ways to nullify it’s danger!
---
Those are generally revealed by Blizzard during/shortly after the final reveal stream.  They'll post them on their site after all of the scheduled reveals are done.
---
Thanks for the sage advice asshole
---
And there’s. Number 1 finish lol
---
It's the trademark cards of r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
They already talked aboit animations in another post. Likely to remove poison animation and the big minions punch. Can't remember if they addressed annother animation.
---
GIT GUD
---
I'm just sitting here wondering how your tier 6 tavern actually has several tier 6 minions in it.
---
⛏️⛏️How long can this go on?⛏️⛏️
---
sulf#21170 EU 80g, I show, you go first.
---
My advice was mentioned before. Just keep playing. There is no way around it
---
F
---
The menagerie is for guests only
---
He's pretty easy to play - you just try to buy two amalgams asap, and just buy ton of battlecry minions. Those +1/+1 your random minions get every time actually really make a difference.
---
Aye, and specifically an entertainment-driven money making machine. It's a fool's errand to be sure, but I'm willing to look for a narrative thread or a chance at old collectibles making a comeback. If I can't be a fan, why even come to Reddit?
---
I will pledge to buy the $80 bundle. If i can see a patch that says "all animations sped up 50%"
---
Forsen nature + Savjz roar
---
11 + 4
---
Can you triple an already golden card?
---
What game is this?
---
It would be cool if you could give Poisonous to two different minions
---
B
---
20 packs (the only one that matters) is trivial to get, considering how many free packs they give you at the start of the expansion
---
Nay

how do you even know which minion is gonna attack what?

Same here. Nothing came out that got me interested in the least.

---
Ye olde "Toxic Annoying Nightmare".
---
It’s just so frustrating how everything can stop working, but that timer keeps clicking away.
---
Why did Curator fall so hard?
---
I mean, I get what you're saying, but I feel like this is a problem exclusive to computer CCGs. Not that wild is unbalanced and needs to be "fixed", but that it actually could be - given massive amounts of time, money, and manpower.
---
MTG never had this problem back in the day, because everyone accepted that broken card interactions in the past couldn't be fixed. Everyone had that jerk friend that had a deck that was impossible to beat because it used some weird-card from Fallen Empires that you'd never even seen before. That's why pretty much every tournament in every card shop became either a booster draft, or very similar to what Standard is in Hearthstone - only certain expansions and starter sets need apply, and even then, some cards are just outright banned. Nobody ever stormed Wizards of the Coasts offices demanding that they fix cards from five years ago.
---
Yes, Wild format is neglected. It was always meant to be. it was a way to play with your old cards, while having a separate format (standard) that could actually have some semblance of balance. It was a way to keep selling new cards, keep changing and altering the game, without giving players the feeling they were losing something they paid for.
---
Curator was never in the top 5, at least according to this metric (it might be different if you take into account only the high ranked players though, but I don't have the data yet on this)
---
Nice
---
Tier 5 minion : if you get this early enough, win game.
---
Against any poison board this fails so hard
---
Danny &amp; Arnold.... love those guys!
---
RIP to the turn timer...
---
Will give Firestone a try, thanks for this info!
---
Make it a triple threat match with sylvanas, seeing how she was handled by the wow team.
---
The limited scope of what is an optimal board for Jaraxxus is how he's balanced. Your first few picks could be nothing but Divine Shield support, and Demons won't always be open later on in the game.
---
It's pretty straightforward and actually pretty decent. Its not super amazing but nowhere near awful.
---
You get a card that gives you a gauranteed minion from the tier you just upgraded to. As opposed to the tavern which will offer you minions from all tiers.
---
you bought a cat and rerolled on your 2nd turn instead of levelling up?! That is for sure the wrong play
---
Bob literally sheltered terrorists though
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Stonebrew's the real king
---
Probably. Although he's playing Daryl so I'm not sure he'd even want to tavern up. Probably just stay on T1 and use the discovers to try and pickup an amalgam.
---
I'll be honest I would have preferred to meet Harth for Battlegrounds.
---
Instead we got this dude.
---
One time I served a drink to a death knight. It froze right in his hands!
---
Shut up, Bob! I can’t win this one ok? I just can’t!
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Hi Mike, I've only just returned to the game because of battlegrounds, though back in the times, 2 and 4 years ago, I also played mostly Arena. I don't even know the timeline for the stats, maybe it is only for a rotation, but if not how much of the history do you think you could cover?
---
Can we please have an option to mite Bob? I had to mute game sound because I can't stand bearing the same phrases over and over.
---
I'd rather get flamed by a real person than hear some bot throw hard coded quotes out from a pool of like 8-10 lines.
---
Eudora never pays her tab though, so it cancels out.
---
Why do you think so many have asked for animations to be turned off? It's in order to que up more actions in the game. But the sequence is part of the balance when it's a mobile game and it needs to be able run on a bad connection.
---
Oh she just casually becomes a literal golden glowing space god at the end of the last Starcraft.
---
She's the easiest hero available and happens to align with the meta. Running into her turn 3 is annoying, but she really doesn't need a nerf.
---
&gt;I'm saying if I place a minion somewhere relative to anopther minion, it should always spawn there regardless of whatever flashy animation comes up
---
Even if that minion is dead from a trade? 
---
That's retarded.
---
Did this too. Unfortunately my boss wouldn't be ok with me not making the deadlines. But if he knows I finished my work usually he asks me to help him with something else.
---
Without rush from boom Omega Devastator is not really broken tbh.
---
Wait, isn't she even more of a psycho than the Banshee Queen?
---
Oh my Yog...
---
Its already balanced by her getting the upgrade one turn late.
---
I'd prefer discovering a 3 here. The best 4 for a beast deck is cave hydra whereas the best 3 for a beast deck is pack leader and a tiny cave hydra isn't much power. But a pack leader is a lot of power with double rat pack. And it'll buff future hydras.
---
So just another day of Hearthstone then?
---
It's supposed to be, but there's been a pattern of replaying the same opponent multiple times that was supposed to have been patched in this latest go-round and yet still seems to be alive and well.
---
Yep.  
---
Good thing there's a bunch of other good games out to kill time before next expansion.
---
He's suggesting there's a large luck component.
---
There is.
---
In what world odd rogue and secret mage are braindead decks? I play odd for a long time now and it still has a ton of play and thinking involves, especially in tough match ups when you need every single advantage to get an edge.
---
The same is for mage: you can't just play cards, there is so much sequencing involved to play it optimally. Compare it to older pirate warrior or even older aggro shaman and say again those are brain dead. I would only laugh at such a statement then.
---
nope amalgam still needs those two to be good
---
that is exactly the same question I was about to ask.. I have similar numbers and 5k
---
Not me bro Not me
---
When did you start buying them? Every time I go into a game trying to build pogos they never seem to appear. Also, what level did you keep your tavern at to have them show up that frequently?
---
bro 😎💪
---
The issue is that nerfing lightfang deletes an entire strategy from the. There already arent that many tribes so making menagerie unplayable is a bad idea.
---
The player with the most minions will go first. Ties are resolved randomly as far as I'm aware.
---
Bro
---
People said they don't want to play wild cause they will have to face pirate warrior and, say, jade druid again. Where are those now? Meta changes even in wild.
---
I'd just always pick Daryl for fun value and to try different things with him really :p
---
Sure i think cool new effect would be great like - your damage goes thru divine shield. Might be op but it's pretty hard to get 3 of toxfins
---
Innkeeper should be Thrall.
---
I would use  strategic retreat.
---
*dick. FTFY buddy
---
The only fair way to make it work is random with a condition that doesn't match you with who you already fought last 3-4 turns, any other option seems easy to exploit.  
---
If it's one time each you could easily greed the times when you know you are going against bottom ones or specific heroes.  
---
If it's +/- 1 or 2 places of your current position you could stick to cards in your hand to go even or loos just by a bit and stay in that spot while grabing powerfull cards and not play them.
---
Current system is not that bad if you consider this easy to do things to get advantages, would add the condition mentioned above tho.
---
I've played this so much I've kind of forgotten how to play regular hearthstone
---
Missing thanks you emote for the trio
---
You could introduce Ice Barrier for the hero that can discover random secrets, and any extra armour disappears end of turn?
---
The 2\2 bird that return as 6\6
---
Does that explain the uncanny sexual atttaction I have towards him?
---
Nooo don’t lewd Bob 😖
---
bran outscales by a lot, but enforcer is braindead... i hope they dont overnerf her.
---
But it does, just for the ones who seek it. Wild, arena, every week brawl, tons of single player content to play through.
---
Once you go Bob,.,
---
It's beta..
---
Real
---
I wouldn't really call it an inconsistency so much as a clarity compromise.
---
Agreed. I can't wait for Sylvanas to bitchslap god and absorb his power
---
Poisonous is a little moot when you have 100 attack but I understand the frustration.
---
How can you not understand?
---
I love Deryl, but all of my games with him so far involve at least one both costly and embarrassing screw up.
---
He's american. It's actually 12.20 in European Date
---
I like him, but I wish he acknowledged when you're sucking just a little bit more. At a certain point, hiis relentless optimimism sounds sarcastic.
---
Ah, finally confirmed that Reno Jackson is a dragon.
---
That was all nerfed before the wild cards came in... None of those are as bad as sniplock or secret mage either.
---
Didn’t he corrupt a well with the heart of an old one?
---
Thanks :)
---
That escalated quickly.
---
Okay dude
---
Early game Security Rover was often a better pick than Junkbot for a mech build anyway.  Getting a Cobalt Guardian plus a Security Rover off her hero power pretty much guarantees you top 4 unless you completely miss on your normal minion rolls.
---
Junkbot gets the hate because it's a scaling card and is really visible, but Rover is the powerhouse that really makes mech builds go imo.
---
I thought the female lich was gonna be top tier with her zero mana coins, but patchwerk proves how important hp is in this mode
---
Are there plans to tie any rewards to Battlegrounds?
---
Ah, thanks. I thought those didn’t activate until it went live. Thanks.
---
You could end up gaining more armour than the dmg you take
---
he lacks critical information PepeLaugh
---
Lich Baz'hial has been rotated out with the latest patch (alongside Giantfin, Manastorm and Mukla)
---
WAAAHHH! GOLDEN common
---
Patches is pathetic lategame. But by then you've secured top 4 already, so it doesn't matter so much.
---
Yeah, Battlegrounds is a new game. Give the devs some time
---
Its life total is actually extremely low. Sweeps and deathrattles/tokens are great ways to deal with that board. Some heroes deal with it better than others, of course, and Ragnaros/Patches/Nefarian will be able to clean off the shields right away.
---
So yeah, your big saving grace in this case would be the fact that he doesn't have a Zapp, so having a few taunted up divine shield mechs, for instance, could allow you to deal with their poisonous mechs much more easily (especially if your Foe-Reaper is in the 3rd or 4th slot). Similarly, for Deathrattle beasts, having a Mama Bear or Khadgar go uncontested can let you sweep them somewhat easily.
---
Yeah Deryl is fucking mental in that he always comes out of the gate strong regardless of what minions he gets since the buffs are that gigantic. Everyone else plays a game of chance just to try to stop him absolutely going ham from the get-go.
---
smol inconsistently inconsistent indy company
---
I didnt wanted to make the post and look like my only purpose is to know what this card does, but I am glad that you did instead.
---
It sais that it should be released by blizzard. I have been looking at youtube, twitter, etc... but cant find any new post with this.
---
WHERE IS THE CARD, BLIZZARD?!!
---
Sometimes the reveal can be a bit late.
---
delayed apparently, probably announced during the battlegrounds stream
---
I'm surprised Sindragosa isn't up there.  Her early game feels both insanely powerful and insanely consistent.  Freezing every turn until you hit 8 gold results in some very large minions early and let you snowball much more aggressively.  She reminds me of a more consistent and powerful Yogg in that regard.
---
Why is Leper Gnome listed amongst the new cards?
---
Bob is dead. The shamans killed him.
---
Give em a break. It's just a smol indie company. Sure they can make some mistakes with their schedule when revealing their new products.
---
Innkeeper here is giving off strong Aphex Twin vibe. All I see is Come to Daddy
---
[Come To Daddy](https://youtu.be/TZ827lkktYs)
---
It looks like a warrior card.
---
I'm 6.2k atm so here are my thoughts:
---
Curator, George, lich king and elise are rated too high.
---
Elise would be good if the first 2 upgrades were 2 mana but as it stands it's forcing you to hard commit 3 gold to buying a minion you wouldn't necessarily want.
---
George's hp is way too expensive when a hero like nef exists and completely negates it. If nef wasn't in virtually every game, I'd rate George much higher.
---
Curator is strong but not top tier strong and nef is definitely A tier.
---
Azkazam should be t2. As others mentioned, for the same reason patchwork is great, Azkazam is also good. On top of that you also have the ability to copy a minion w splitting image so you beef up 1 mech with divine shield for double and most opponents can't overcome that value until late game, and it mitigates a lot of bad draws
---
How did the game end
---
also content creators :p
---
I think it’s w priest or paladin card of neutral
---
there is nothing else to do on a commuter express :P
---
Still waiting for them to buff Gelbin so I can show off my golden one but I know that aint happenin
---
&gt;Wild

Stopped reading after that.

Aw man i liked her!
---
Lol reminds me of Hong Kong
---
Top right kobold looks goofy
---
I think I remember Mike hunting that she would come back after some tweaks.
---
I agree that she has a very interesting hero power and I would love to see more heroes like her
---
Looks like a faceless card. So for now we know that:
---
1) It probably wont be a dragon
---
2) It has some chance of being a priest card (or a neutral).
---
3) Maybe it does have dragon synergy.
---
Im just trying to maintain sanity untill the card is actually revealed
---
Then we get zephyrs simulator. Not weighting cards is like the whole mechanic to battlegrounds.  You gwt offered a select ammount of minions that are also shared in the same pool as your opponents. Weighting cards would mess everything up so much, for example; if you get beasts early now it is extremely  harder for anyone else to find a beast. Take that idea and imagine you roll 3 non tribe minions, not fun.
---
Like he said, nothing wrong
---
Nov 25 7pm looks fun, fake dragon
---
Played 3 of them today. Lost the first, conceded the second at 28 life, and won the last one in 6 turns. All of them counted.
---
Wait until you see 2 Rat Packs and a Mama Bear

cliff notes on the rules?
---
Maybe it was Bob's tavern all along....
---
They should consider adding his voice lines to standard/wild.
---
Had a windfury poisonous murlocs build (4 or 5, 40 heath poisonous windfury murlocs) that would probably beat this build. Mechs i”are the most consistent but probably not the strongest build.
---
People are still going for ridiculously greedy menagerie plays because of his hero power, but the meta is insanely aggressive right now. If you try to build up a few amalgams before buffing them you might straight up die because of it.
---
but dr boom never tips 
---
he gotta save those 3 dollars to make more bombs
---
Apparently only at the end of the event. So add a few more hours to that...
---
4 mana 7/7: Battlecry: reduce this minion's attack and health to 1/1.
---
Dr 6 Dr 7 Tirion \^\_\^
---
Yes
---
It's a visual bug. You received the MMR for the win.
---
Hammer wielding gryphon rider should be the middle because it's essentially a free space.
---
Rock solid early game. Hitting the button is a very immediate power spike, even if you don't get what you want
---
I think they said they are only adding 2 minions in the December patch.  Maybe more in January
---
"Early"
---
Sally was my first MSG leggo, got it from my launch day packs
---
she's, um, not seen much use since
---
Why don't you try r/battlegrounds if you wanna talk about actual "battlegrounds". Also, I'm not against people talking about HS but against those "wow, look at this amazing table" and those "This post is so unique, 1st place and MMR give +0 points, can you believe it". Other than that I'm in good terms with all kind of posts
---
No, he tries his best and you are just a racist who shames him just because he is an annoy-o-tron. You should be ashamed, you can't judge someones character based solely on the conditions of their birth.
---
The gold copy would give 80 hp.
---
I think I forgot about [[Ghastcoiler]]. Another shredder in shredder club.
---
They blindly rely on it to determine what's best and worst. Lich Bah'zial is nowhere near the worst hero, for example.
---
I rarely see Mama Bear late game. It's just not enough to beat scaling and too slow to beat Mechs.
---
At least they should do it transform into a random legendary
---
I did the design test, now just waiting for the interview. Fingers crossed :)
---
&gt; Sindragosa
---
yeah I've played a bunch more sindragosa and it feels like an average hero, so I will move it up. She does get a nice early spike, so I will move her up.  
---
As for Nef, I am debating moving it to s tier. Initially post patch I was seeing less bubbles so thats why I didnt have him on the very top, but its starting to go back to a cobalt guardian meta, so I'm def rethinking it.  
---
As for George, he is good against pretty much everything not Nef. I know Nef is in every game, but he still so good vs everything else and I think rating him average is fair.  
---
I'm still not sure how Akazam is that good, I'll talk to some high tier players to try to understand how valid this is
---
With some bad RNG attacks, I've seen someone get chunked for over 30 HP before. I think it keeps the game interesting and forces you to constantly balance your greed with the strength shown on board.
---
And Toast!
---
Yeah these are horrible. Damage-based removal is literally a core part of Mage's class identity. Tech cards are inherent to HS design. Those spaces might as well be called "Hearthstone Card". Then on the flip side there are spaces like "But Y Tho" which has no real meaning relative to HS and "Drug Addicted Tortollan" which... isn't a title used to describe any existing cards. Then there's "No Charge", which is a negative category and therefore makes no sense in the context of bingo.
---
Yeah, i'm unsubbing from everyone now..
---
Not really. You'll generally hit crap. It's too slow and random.

---
I'd buy Amalgam as a 0/1 if I had to. It's the single most important unit in the game. The initial stats don't matter at all, it's about what he can do, which is open up all the abilities to whichever build you're playing.
---
Brian "Please don't call him Brian Kilber" Kibler
---
It is enough to beat Mechs. The reason you don't see that many Mama Bears is just because she's a 6 star card for a very specific build. 
---
If by "scaling" you mean an early Lightfang Enforcer then yeah, literally nothing beats that. It's the closest thing to an auto-win you can get in a heavily random game mode.
---
it's so crazy to me because as much as battlegrounds is fun, it's incredibly shallow: there are essentially 4 builds when other autochess-like games have so many more and the mixup of different 'characters' boil down to maybe 5 being any good.
---
the support it's getting seems overkill
---
Isnt that gigatrash?

---
Someone beat you to the lunch sorry
---
This seems pretty bad, this will almost always die instantly and a 7 mana 1/7 with Battlecry: Fill your board with 1/1s is horrible.
---
While not as powerful as Valanyr, the ability to chain this effect from Dragon to Dragon should be helpful.
---
I played this brawl 3 times, i got octosaris deathrattle 4 times
---
Rank 5 floor is also a bunch of memes, since most entertaining players drop back to floor instead of going legend because of the ridiculous queue times.
---
I like how all three of the cards revealed at the Battlegrounds tournament are cards that wouldn't work in Battlegrounds.
---
So essentially Talritha is jumping from dragon to dragon. That’s really flavorful and really cool!
---
played a lot of auto chess when it came out, honestly to me the HS version looks too simple. Well, I haven't tried it so I can't fully judge, but it doesn't get me excited in the least.
---
Cheaper glimmerroot, an interesting token card that's just too expensive and HOLY SHIT THE NUTS
---
Seriously fuck Dragonrider Talritha and the games it will instantly win if you draw it by 3
---
Every single meme we of the team employed the same strat multiple times, I’m glad it workout for them in the end
---
how is it better than madam lazul when you have the chance to flunk out and she gives you more info on the opponen't hand?
---
Yea but I have worse quality so beat that
---
Hmm, Dragon pally has some nice tools. Worth carrying Nozudurmo the Timeless till turn 8,9,10 if he catches the deathrattle?
---
Spend some money on it then. 
---
If you both don't want to play the game or spend any money on it then not many people are going to care that you get one less hero to choose from.
---
1 attack wtf is that?
---
Is there anything this combos with?  The only thing I can think of is Knife Juggler, but you'd have to have no other minions or any form of card draw to make this worth it.
---
Fantastic [[Making Mummies]] synergy. Immense value
---
Its literally a worse version of Blastmaster Boom

---
Potentially decent as a finisher in token decks, combined with [[Soul of the Murloc]], [[Soul of the Forest]], or [[Call of the Wild]], but pretty damn clunky.
---
Seven mana for 7/13 worth of doesn't seem terrible on its own. 
---
The 1/7 body may be fairly easy to deal with, but the card looks like it can snowball if it isn't.
---
This won't instantly win games if the dragon it buffs is a high-cost one.

Ah, so that's my golden pre-order legendary
---
I hate the 30 second late game turns on mobile, which are more like 20, since clicking, doing stuff is also slower. Would love to get at least 50 seconds.
---
I'm sure the downvote was from a mod.
---
but token decks have cheaper or better swarm options than this card
---
The reason why that happened is because the most recent patch was server-side, which they can implement quickly.
---
The bigger client-side patches take a while to implement since they have to go through QA and stuff.
---
So you want a static game where once the meta is defined that’s it? People are playing WoW classic to replay things they’ve already done or haven’t done. It’s nostalgia and also a less overwhelming world.  In WoW it’s really about completing things alone or with people you know than it is about competing with others.
---
Hearthstone is a card game, Magic is a card game. Card games are competitive and will always have a meta that becomes more defined the more it is played. Which means things that developers and play testers didn’t notice will become more apparent as time goes on.
---
Wizards of the Coast banned Oko and admitted that he was a mistake and was creating a bad meta. But they mentioned that they were still going to make powerful cards and release them. This is because a card game is more fun when you have impactful cards to play, which is why there’s always new strong cards being added to every card game (that hasn’t died).
---
In the case of Hearthstone RNG has always been a base mechanic. It’s what balances some cards like Deadly Shot. This was because Blizzard finds RNG to make more fun casual matches and more exciting high level games to watch. Yes it has its issues but it’s a core detail of the game.
---
While I agree the current state of Constructed Hearthstone needs work, I know that “Vanilla HS” will not fix any issues. Although it can work fine as a brawl on the occasion.
---
End my suffering plz
---
[deleted]
---
It has a lot more control on the outcome than others. Thats why i say better. May be stretching it by calling it the best but the fact that it reduces some of the rng is key to me
---
Probably guud when you combo with some thing like when ever you summon a minion with 1 attack give it a buff.
---
It’s very nearly the same thing, it’s not innovative at all
---
It's a known bug that happens from clicking too fast on a newly spawned creature. You can also cause it to happen in a regular game of hearthstone.
---
It's one mana cheaper?  It's an epic so you can put two in your deck?
---
I feel like it would say "look at 3 cards that started in your opponent's deck" if it was only limited to that pool. My guess is that the pool is any valid card for your opponent (their class and neutral).
---
How can Shu’Ma possibly be good?!
---
A 2 mana 2/2 is much better than a 3 mana 3/2. Though on second thought Lazul might be better because as another comment pointed out, this could offer cards in the deck but not the hand.
---
There are plans to update Battlegrounds very regularly for at least a few months. There patches planned for december and jenuary already. They are looking to replace amalgam with different "amalgam" at a higher tier and buff demons and murlocs.
---
Just a remake of [[Curious Glimmerroot]].
---
\[\[Ironbeak Owl\]\] should be coming in handy.

3/3/3 | Battlecry: Look at 3 cards. Guess which one started in your opponent's deck to get a copy of it.  
---
Now we need a Dragon that summons a copy of itself
---
Can potentially snowball out of controll (if card draw was a thing for Paladin). First of, it has [[Anubisath Warbringer]] buff deathrattle but 6 mana cheaper and also give them that deathrattle.
---
2nd, This buff seem to stack. And if the stacked one dies, MORE STACKS.
---
Assuming the tokens live that long.
---
Wait its a 1/7? It would be played as a 7/7 maybe a 6/7, but any lower than that and it is gonna be p bad. But 1/7? Unplayable

ppl can disagree with you without beeing a mod

3/2/1 Beast | Battlecry: Silence a minion.  
---
The best use of this is in Quest Hunter. Other than that, it is kind of bad, but there is a deck for it, so it is not useless
---
They just revealed it. It's a 2 mana 2/2 Priest card called Envoy of Lazul. The text is "Battlecry: Reveal 3 cards in your opponent's hand and guess which one is in the hand to gain a copy of it." That's slightly paraphrased but it was just revealed along with two other legendary cards.
---
That was actually the best part of the tournament that I enjoy. Like how they describe their board state to each other, rearranging to sacrifice all high tier cards to minimize damage. Especially in games where one player is about to lose, doing this is extremely important to save the dying player.
---
Waste of a legendary slot. Only for battlegrounds and arena.
---
Shu'ma technically could be in Battlegrounds and could be interesting for econ.
---
Yes, but that card was really fun and skill-testing. I don't mind them making similar cards if they were fun in the past.
---
Be a fun card to make a meme Shaman deck out of. Lots of ways to cheat it out and also can slap Ancestral Spirit on it.
---
2 mana 2/2 aren't great stats anyway. You would rather go with better and consistent value if you're getting unimpressive stats either way.
---
Probably meme? But there's lots of token decks where this could be an additional board reload. Could go in the probably new zoo deck with it's 2 imp hero power or token druid maybe. Will be fun to play regardless if this works.
---
I don't think it will see play. Looks like a worse glimmerroot.
---
I mean, it’s a persistent threat and initially it’s a 7/7/13 on an empty board. I want to say this could be good in token, but it might be too slow since you can’t buff it the turn you play it, and it’s a turn 7 play.
---
Yea, but speaking from experience trying to fit extra stuff into that deck: good luck being anything more than a meme.
---
Amazing that this is one of the first cards they kick off reveal season with.
---
Can’t wait to make Stream Snipe Priest with [[Madame Lazul]], [[Chameleos]], and this card!
---
That’s strange to me because of Zoobot and Menagerie Magician giving buffs to dragons. Right now it only buffs Amalgam.
---
This is an excellent analysis actually. I wish I had gold to give it.
---
It’s vastly simpler. I started with battlegrounds and moved on to Underlords after learning the basics, it’s not even remotely close. 
---
Battlegrounds will of course develop way more, but it’s always going to be just like Hearthstone vs Magic. Doesn’t make one inherently better than the other.
---
People don’t want to admit HS sucks now I guess. Too bad

1/1/1 Beast | Each turn this is in your hand, transform it into a card your opponent is holding.  
---
You got me there
---
The only reason the META is so f'ed right now is due to the wild-event with [Evolve] returned to standard, which will leave standard with the release of DoD. Hopefully the new expansion will bring a balanced meta. It's sad that the devs are so reluctant to remove Evolve tho where the meta we had before the current event was a pretty good and balanced one.
---
It's quite different, this is a recurring effect and can go in classes other than Warrior. Though it's still probably just bad.
---
Agree. Guessing correctly felt good. Once you know the meta especially.
---
Since the tokens spawn at the end of your turn your opponent gets to answer them before you apply those buffs.
---
dragonrider talritha is too slow, but might be fun to play around with if the explorer paladin card is good, but the problem is the lack of cheap rush or taunt dragon for the stats to be worth.
---
They could just introduce some generically good dragons. The game would be even better with more tribes in it.
---
It's better IF you guess correctly IMO, since it's a 2 mana 2/2 and not a 3 mana 3/2. Lazul gives you more info, but to be honest, knowing what's in your opponent's hand has been overvalued many times already, because good players can more or less tell what's in there anyway.
---
On the other hand, since this can miss and Lazul can't, I would say that Lazul is probably still better. And if it can show cards that are in your opponent's deck, but not in their hand (let's say that you face Control Warrior, but he hasn't drawn Brawl yet) then it can be much harder than Glimmerroot in some cases.
---
Underlords have much more depth, 1 game time almost hour and uderlord almost dead lol.
---
Bob is always so supportive. Really keeps me inspired to try hard every game. I want to make him proud.
---
Am I the only one who feels like he's judging you when he says "UhhhhIt's good to get some minions in play." Like, Bob please don't question my decision to take Old Murk Eye on Round 4 when I have 3 other Murlocs.
---
Where's the oppressive priest board clear?
---
1 card put your opponent in bloodlust lethal range isnt the worst.
