The fact that they changed it themselves doesn't mean that they didn't do so to get ahead of the changes in the censorship standards.

Hearthstone's a silly community, and honestly the censorship takes away a bit of charm from the Warcraft world. We're gonna make stupid jokes and try to laugh it off, it doesn't matter if they're funny or not. Have a bit of chill mate. :P

Funnily enough I unsubbed a couple months a go since all the posts were just random screenshot of lucky plays/combos, subbed again yesterday just to see a spam of stupid posts about card's art getting changed,guess I can live without them
---
Same thing was happening to me so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Now I can't even log in.
---
I would suggest that you look up a deck that looks fun and viable that you can afford, and until you make up your mind just consider golden Jarraxus an additional 1600 dust towards your goal
---
I was thinking the exact same thing, keywords double as workarounds for the other card interactions.
---

What about "Give all minions Poisonous"?

Getting hit with a lollipop in the head would hurt. Too dangerous, 1 star

Now you know how (almost) every other class feels in standard without an infinite value hero card.

I think that's a fair criticism and like I said, I agree with certain pieces like Deadly Shot. But I've seen a lot of comments like, "fucking SJW Blizzard" which seems like such a stupid take.

---
Thanks all of you. I really appreciate the help.

Needs new art too.
---
This'll Be Good... wait what?
---
Maybe it discourages them from changing a bunch of well liked art in the future? Doubt it but who knows.
---
I read that with an A instead of a two the first time and got confused
---
Make a mech stick, divine spirit &amp; inner fire combo is the usual win condition.  Other times you just fight for board and win with minions that you buff, but usually combo for the win.
---
Why appease China's censorship laws when we have made up Liberal censorship laws right here in the USA?
---
Shit I forgot a humorous tag, sorry y‚Äôall. I just keep seeing this be posted over and over again.
---
Did people really get that attached to the art on a card from a digital card game or are you just desperately searching for something to be outraged over?
---
Yes, they can exchange them for the ability to get a job, or travel or go to school, take a mortgage to rent a house for up to 90years since owning property is illegal.

You know, privileges that only the best citizens should be allowed.

Which is exactly what they wanted to remove, so I dont see how Eviscerate proves your point.

Despite the nature of the thread, no one has proven me wrong still. Still waiting for some facts as to why RNG effects are classified as "Skilled gameplay"

Absolutely up for a constructive conversation on the above, if someone wants to go down that road.
---
Played since 2017, spent about 12$ on the two welcomes.
---
I honestly am starting ti not tell the difference between the real changes and the meme ones
---
Also RIP Jaina's plunging cleavage.
---
Their excuse was they changed the art to stuff they can be proud of, not because of the gore or sexual aspects.  Their excuse depends on the art looking better.  Eviscerate wasn't improved, literally just blood removed.
---
Is it because of the china regulations? Cuz I thought they had their own version of the game. Or is it the ESRBZ rating?
---
When do we get our dust refund?
---
I posted a praise post about the artworks they've given freely on their site. 
---
But my post is overshadowed by meta memes about succubus and teddy bears and garbage.
---
It's depressing, man
---
God damn it! I can't dream anymore.
---
It functions (or is envisioned to in the future) like a credit score. Can't trade it for anything like currency, but your rating determines your access to perks/money/ability to rent in an area. No idea how far along it is.
---
I think its more Team 5 would rather different cards enable combos between Standard years rather than it always being Classic and Basic cards like Mind Blast.
---
Plus, with most combo decks being reliant on one of legendary cards, it's difficult to make counter play feel alright for both players.
---
A Warlock's Gnomeferatu or now Hecklebot or something removing the Mecha'thun, Malygos, or even Chef Nomi from the opponent's deck really does not feel good. A game should not be determined like that as early as turn two or four, and there's really only two, maybe three, ways Team 5 could mitigate the frustration combo causes in the game, and none of which are flawless and may create more issues than they could solve.
---
This is why I put winrate there. Yes somebody that is able to pilot 5-L homemade is better then person piloting netdeck - if they have the same winrate. And legend is still meaningful if it's achieved with good winrate. Its all pretty simple to understand for anybody who isn't troll.
---
Probably not, especially if all the "outrage" is relegated to Reddit.
---
We still have Malygos Alex and right now a buffed lunars pocket galaxy (which can create Otks like 20% of the time). 
---
Hunter has an OTK, really good draw for it and it has quite good board pressure for other match ups. 
---
Florist petal discount card + the goose, moonfires and a swipe is a combo if people badly wanted it. 
---
Mecha‚Äôthun is still in the game, just sadly no good way to activate him. 
---
Paladin has its 25 damage combo still. 
---
And we are legit going into an expansion season right now, so mindblast could easily get replaced in another class.
---
If theres cash involved then u bet a kid is gunna be playing and a company is gunna be subtly telling them to spend their parents money.

Changed the art and name, now its a felstalker or whatever, I dont know WoW lore that much, basically though kept stats just went from succubus to demon dog
---
Well on the upside we can now all rest easy knowing that thousands of Chinese children are now going to grow up as upstanding members of society and not violent criminals or something from seeing the utter filth that was Succubus. 
---
God bless you Blizzard, you're saving humanity one step at a time.
---
Yes. It's totally worth it for Blizzard to run two separate versions of the game just so a handful of cards could have boobs on them for the American version.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not outraged. But a lot of us did in fact like the art and associated it with the card. And the reasoning seems lame for the changes, trying to appeal to a younger crowd even though most people playing this game are probably in their teens or twenties anyways. I‚Äôd rather people show their distaste for something if they don‚Äôt agree with it.
---
Bruh, what the fuck.

Would a 2-cost hero power, "Freeze a minion and add a copy of it to your hand" be terrible? It wouldn't be great, but it'd be better than Moorabi.
---
No No
---
They said their goal with these changes was to lessen the Violence and the sex as well as take this opportunity to improve upon old art work. 
---
Eviscerate lessened the Violence (blood) in the art so it ticks one of their reasons. There goal was to make it look like a card that they would print today, and eviscerate now Is more inline with that with a simple editing out of blood.

Choose a scantily clad character from the game and remove her completely

"Flavour" is a big part of the reason Hearthstone became popular in the first place, why it has remained popular, and why I still enjoy Hearthstone over other card games. Art changes like these will leave a bad taste in my mouth.

Anomaly or tavern are the easy ways.

Then there's the slightly harder way of taking the 3 random secrets treasure, getting either Mirror Entity or Duplicate from it, then getting Sorcerer's Apprentice through whichever you got and Duplatransmogrifying it, and then using those.

I mean, okay. But... *eviscerate*.
---
I mostly play on mobile, so un/reinstalling is not as dramatic as it sounds, but it's definitely dropping out of my attention to be replaced by other games for now.
---
I‚Äôm relatively new to hearthstone and have been taking advice from a friend that plays it. I chose priest as my main class because it looked fun and I‚Äôve been told that was a mistake and I was curious why? I‚Äôve built a fun death factory deck and don‚Äôt really have a problem going against mechs, which I‚Äôve been told is the meta. Why are these things the way they are? All halp is greatly appreciated
---
I haven't played hearthstone in a while,so it looks like with these changes, I'll have alot of ketchup to do.
---
It's the downside to having the 2nd best classic set.  Rogue is going through what Warrior did a few years ago.  Their classic cards are being gutted so their new cards can be good instead of quirky.
---
because they think it makes children violent and they think video games are only for kids.

I‚Äôm out of the loop. Did this card get deleted? Or HoF?

One question: What does the Bartender mean when he tell me to "Shake on it"?

That's a little harsh for our demographic. What about
---
&gt;felt sad
---
Blizzard is going to alienate their older audience. Sure, we've been playing a children's card game all along, but it's going a little too far and I'm not a fan of the recent art direction.
---
That's fucked up.
---
I can understand the low minion thing. I‚Äôm not even sure what most priests play tbh since I rarely play against them. 
---
Funny, My friend mains Dr Boom and he has a hard time beating me.
---
Signed.
---
and mech hunter player
---
Didn't see play when it cost one less mana before sooooo it highly doubt it.
---
Probably because you don't play the meta priest lol.
---
I believe it has nothing to do with China - because if it was there would either be a change to every possible offending card rather than a selection, plus there is the possibility of region only artwork.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But shit, the reason give is full of holes. So many artworks would be offenders if you use what has been changed as an example.
---
The rules would be:
---
1. No dark artwork.
---
2. No intentionally sexual artwork, specifically nearly bare boobs - there appears to be leeway here as these new cards still feature mild cleavage and bikini bottoms.
---
3. The "Tracer" rule (no butt highlighting poses).
---
4. No blood-splatter. 
---
5. No depictions of something being killed.
---
Apart from Rule 3, which is an unfortunate rarity, the rest is basically everywhere. The game is about minion on minion combat and women in WoW have always had "RPG" armor - there is going to be things dying and female warriors wearing g-strings and micro-bikinis.
---
take that back, p2w filth!
---
Also thanks
---
Attacking the question instead of the answer?  Blatant, as you said.
---
This is the playerbase Blizzard is appealing to with the recent artwork changes.
---
&gt; Sold to us, under the assumption that Blizz has our best interests at heart.
---
Wait, do you believe that any company has your best interest in their heart?
---
I've copy-pasted this comment from  [https://playhearthstone.com/en-gb/blog/23037180#comments](https://playhearthstone.com/en-gb/blog/23037180#comments)   
---
I wrote it myself if that matters to anybody. I hope people give it a read, and would love the opinions of both the /r/hearthstone community as well as the slim chance a member of the team sees it.  
---
  I'm not here to continue the needless bickering about art changes that have been going on, because I know as a business sometimes you have to make changes in order to accommodate for the sensibilities of others. Being a short term pain for long-time players like myself, to allow for the chances of opening the game up to some new players.  
---
I am writing this in the hopes that somebody on the design team hears this and takes it into consideration, as I feel as if it would solve a lot of player complaints as well as enable for card art changes to be made in the future as well.  
---
I'm sure you have considered something along these lines, but I would really appreciate it if somewhere down the line, an additional tab was added to the collection, similar to heroes and card backs that allowed for people to set their preferred card art, from those that have been altered. Giving them the option to revert back to the nostalgic art we have been using from the beginning or using the more detailed, modern artwork that the artists come up with.  
---
I have been discussing such an idea with some fellow Hearthstone playing friends, starting with the Witchwood Grizzly art change. Over time this idea has become more ingrained in me as a really good idea, which will be beneficial not only now, but into the future as well.
---
I can tell you why Eviscerate was changed. Because it was too damn easy compared to something like Bite and Deadly shot. They just said "fuck it" and did it too.
---

F2P peasant here. Never felt forced to spend any real money yet

Low effort content is forbidden, mods here are extremely reasonable and consistent with their actions, much like hearthstone. They would never allow people to just post "i hav no frens i spam pirat warrior and is legend naw, deposit kamra"
---
deathwing, and anything with charge OP
---
Only the art changed.
---
These are two different issues with two different context to them.
---
They each have their own stipulations and reasons to them. Acting as if they are the same doesn't highlight the issue with one and the issue with the other.
---
And instantaniously downvoting me for pointing this out does not make you correct about either issue.
---
If it was Blizzard's own decision they would have censored all cards with blood in them.
---
I presume they only changed the ones where they recieved complaints
---
Because China is one of the most populated countries on earth, enough to the point where their market is a wet dream for any business. Blizzard censors them because they see China as a gold mine, but China has some of the strictest censoring laws. That‚Äôs why blizzard chose to do edited art, and probably why they‚Äôll just censor everything now. What‚Äôs the point in appeasing the rest of the world when you can just cater to your richest customer?
---
To;dr The game is worse than it used to be, it makes sense the art is brought to that same standard.
---
Hard countered by mossy horror, won‚Äôt see play
---
Yes. I gave an example of how the phrasing could be misunderstood by a new player, and then mentioned that I understand how it works.
---
So what's it say?

That's my favorite quote in all of hearthstone. 
---
He genuinely sounds livid and evil
---
Artists feel good &gt; players feel good.
---
What a great decision.

*Anakin Skywalker twitches slightly in the afterlife*
---
How do you call reverse power creep?
---
That's a super interesting idea for a card. I love it.
---
I wouldn't say that tinkmaster needs a lot of support. He's more of a highly questionable, very niche tech card
---
Dave, I don't feel so good.
---
\[The artist then turn into dust.\]

I don't care why they are doing it, I don't like the changes. They don't add anything good to the game

---
Just remind me having a family-friendly cartoonish Diablo 3.
---
A-C3 are all good... enough that you can tell the rarity but doesn't nearly bleed over to the next card.
---
Don't play coy and frame it as "afraid of female bodies" as if this is some sort of anti feminist move on Blizzards part. it's a removal of overt sexualisation.

I got rank 7 with carpet bwomzomdee deck. Play 1 drops, more arms, innerfire combo and carpet. Keep 1 drops, more arma and carpet in mulligan; bwomzomdee for control matchups. Play as aggro
---
There aren't even that many cards with blood in them to begin with, and now there's two or three fewer. The only one left as far as I am aware is Misha, for which the amount of blood is minimal and much more difficult to see at card scale than Eviscerate.
---
Even then, that still doesn't answer the question.
---
Same here...
---
This is honestly extremely pathetic from Blizzard.

Oh, you're right. Guess you don't call yourself DawgVinci for nothing.

Well ofc they did, why on earth would they upload something like this on the first hand anyway?? or it was for the chinese public?
---
China is every gamers boogeymsn nowadays. Don't like something but can't articulate why? It's those Damn Chinese.
---
Let me guess, you get this one when you prepurchase the expansion, amirite?
---
I can think of a few you could do with Warrior:
---
Malkorok - Make an effect like "0 Mana: Equip a random weapon", so you can swap the weapon each turn/reroll if bad, It would mean you have a permanant weapon up essentially, which is very strong. 
---
Hobart Grapplehammer - I remember this guy had a lot of hype! You could do it as a repeatable weapon booster, or something like a passive "Weapons have +1/+1" or "Weapons have +2 attack" or what have you. These would all be pretty strong and fit Hobart.
---
Blackhowl Gunspire - Probably the craziest one and my initial thought is that it might be OP, but a passive hero power that lobbed damage at the foe when you took damage could be doable?
---
Nice work ! They should hire you xD
---
Vanish doomsayer turn 8 set up the pogo drop perfectly

Each time I click "play" for my ranked game on mobile, after finding oponent, game goes to title screen. I need to completely close game, start it and after loading it, game redirects me to my disconnected game where I can play. Each ranked game after last patch. Any ideas how to fix that?
---
So you think it's wrong to include ANY kind of sexually-motivated female representation?  You think that inherently, women are sexless?
---
Those are hyperbole, so help me to paint a more realistic picture of your perspective.
---
Congrats ! Glad I could be helpful !
---
Ive been using baited arrow in my spell hunter deck just for the memes. Can't decide if its good enough or not, 5 mana for a 5/5 and removal, but its so situational and really not worth it if you dont get the "evilsaur". 
---
What do others think? Is 5 mana too high, would you run this in a deck that just trys to pull a huge zuljin?

---
No. No it's not. 
---
That's absolutely and utterly False.
---
I don't even understand why you would even hold such a belief, that is demonstrably false. 
---
Historically and Currently the absolute driver of the censorship of women, is without a doubt, absolutely conservatives, and conservative values. 
---
The idea you're thinking of is the complaint of a lack of equal representation, and the lack of non objectified female portrayals.
---
Which is not even close to being a censorship debate.
---
All this shows is that you have no idea what the opposition actually wants and feels. You've simply listened to what others complain about, and did no investigation yourself nor, if you did, did you actually listen to the complaints and comments before making up your mind.
---
Progressives calling for censorship of female sexuality are rare edge cases of extremist values, not common requests. 
---
Without a doubt, for decades and decades of media production the censorship demands have unequivically been conservatives.
---
But, is he a Dragon?
---
Exactly.  Succubi are inherently sexy.  So you don't "sexualize" a succubus, you just faithfully represent the character.  Sexualizing is ["to render sexual; endow with sexual characteristics"](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexualized).  You can't do that with a succubus because it is inherently a sexual being.  There's no "giving" or "endowing" them with sexuality; the sexuality is there by definition, it is part of the concept.
---
The old Jaina art was sexualized.  Sex is not part of Jaina's character; the only reason to give her heaps of cleavage is to objectify her.  That doesn't apply to a succubus, which is defined by its pursuit of sex.

Blizzard hates Priests, keeps hating Priests and will keep hating on Priests. That's have always been the same, the only thing different now is that the community finally catch up (for me was obvious when Purify was released).
---
I see one more problem,  HE HAS NO PANTS!!! :0

Woah,  thanks for the confirm! I'm down for Finley Paladin. I just hope that we don't get Murloc Paladin a second time and have Dragon Paladin fall just short like it traditionally has.

I love that you phrased that like it's the 1950s. "Those damn Russians with their atom bomb and their hover card bug!"

Windfury Harpy is better, secret keeper is about the same, every other one is worse in varying degrees
---
One of the advantages of being a dragon, I suppose...

As long as it's all in good fun, and not "gamers rise up"-level of embarrassment, I'm all for it.

I just want Surrender to Madness to do something QQ

We run very similar decks, i dont have the war bear nor do i use eaglehorn and bloodscalp. I use 2x kill command, any reason you arn't using this yourself?
---
Yeah, I at least complained about the overt sexualization of women to Blizzard.

Damn the other guy was probably so cheesed

Except Big Priest

sure, lets trash lackeys so the next meta is even more dr boom orientated than this one

If it is a repost can I have a link to the first posted? :)
---
Wait what's that 4/3 card? I'm so confused.
---
I'm waiting for them to just have the Unkillable key word.
---
Maybe it's just me as a rogue, but I can only kill a minion and it's 28 tokens it drops so many times before I start to go loopy.

it took me a good while of staring at it to figure out what it was that *isn't* their hats
---
Death is a mature concept for adults only
---
Ah yes, much better, death was too scary
---
Oh great and when Pogo never becomes meta again are we going to get Vanish back? It's just ughh. I get unhappy with the amount of cards they took away from Rogue.
---
I like the art style of them, but honestly yeah, the expansions are all blending together at this point, the latest ones just don't feel unique, with generic garbage single players that offer little to no rewards, and the same gameplay we've had since catacombs, with a new paint job.
---
The person you are responding to is making the point that Priest *is* atrociously bad. They are just keeping the standard.
---
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE
---
Every deck is viable in wild. But you can't have Ticking a bom in standard
---
Same here, upvoting for visibility
---
That's the new succubus. Exact same stats and battlecry but they changed the art and name.
---
I don't understand all those references to a Dragon Reno Jackson, care to explain?
---
I haven't played HS in a long time, why did they remove the card?
---
kill yourself.
---
They're not sexist, just really fucking dumb.
---
I think "Shadow" is considered way too violent, so how about "Bad Word: Sleep"
---
Ok so now 4 7/7 is the equivalent of 88 for Hearthstone circlejerkers?
---
As the title says, bit annoyed by this, saw the new card changes come through, didn't think much of it. Played my rogue deck and suddenly drew Plague Bearer. Realised that hearthstone had replaced the 2 Vanishes in my deck with this new card, with no alert to the change. Proceeded to then lose my game with 2 dead cards in hand.

They will surely release some more via their instagram like they did in RoS but for the first reveal stream I have no idea.

On Android I had a similar issue in the past where I had to manually enable SD permissions for the app. This is not working now and I am totally stuck even after completely reinstalling the app few times :(

This has already stopped to be funny

Are women not allowed to be portrayed with big chests now? Apparently it's unrealistic? Whilst at the same time morbidly obese characters are becoming more common in games?
---
aye :D more low effort content!
---
Cool
---
They havent anounced anything yet.
---
Nornally theres a little bit of silence after the first reveal then some random drops and in one or two weeks the official reveal schedule gets posted.
---
&gt; So with Vivid Nightmare for example you get twice the Reborn.
---
Based on my experience with the new dungeon run, I'm pretty sure the two 'pieces' of the reborn are different minions, so you can revive the one without reborn.  It's the same reason why rez priest doesn't usually play things like Harvest Golem that deathrattle into minions that you don't usually want in your rez pool.
---
I'm not sure if it was the original intention, but I can see them retconning in the idea.
---
Don't know why being downvoted + just wanted to PSA this so other people don't fall into same trap.

Thank you

I had the same issue yesterday on 2 separate iOS devices while trying to connect via WiFi and cellular data. It would not connect at all, the connection would keep timing out. I had reset my devices several times with no success. I let it go until later in the night and connected via WiFi and this time it allowed me to connect. I have not had any connection issues today but if it persists maybe clear all the hearthstone data from your device and reinstall the app.
---
Congratulations, they all look like shit now
---
What type if gun shoots rainbow crystals ?
---
yeah, but would you play a 5 mana card that reads "your hero power becomes 'your choose one effects have both effects combined'"?
---
But what about a 3 mana 3/3 that gives you a card from another class and then also has really cool art. I mean come on, it's my favorite card.
---
I haven't said it was my favourite card. I said I liked it. I like a lot of cards and for different reasons. Warlock is my favourite class and this card was really important for the flavor of the class and even if it sucked I liked it because of what it represents.
---
Blizzard: the meta is dominated by mages that cheat out 16/16 on turn 5 and warriors with tools to remove their opponent's entire deck's value twice over. What should we do?
---
Also Blizzard: nerf control Rogue into the ground.
---
Imagine giving up a game because of a small handful of art changes
---
Hearthstone is pretty clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek Warcraft given how Team 5 has written the Lich King and Kel'Thuzzad, and this amount of backlash to what is absolutely nothing is beyond ridiculous.
---
He was obviously paid to write that by bli$$ard they probably bought him some Rise of Shadows packs too
---
Gave me a good chuckle.. thank you
---
I feel offensed by this post
---
Well, you're not getting me. I have actual things to worry about.
---
The art of seven cards that almost never saw play is not a hill even worth fighting for.
---
&gt; make them 45/45 easly.
---
So what? There's no meaningful difference between a 17/17 pogo and a 45/45 one. The difference is that without vanish, the rogue is dead 5 turns before that happens.
---
He received +4/+4 from the tavern card fyi, was just curious if this is a known issue or not
---
How does any artist feel good about having their artwork being removed from the game ?
---
Oh, I didn't understand your comment that way, my bad.
---
I thought that at some point HS had gotten the first place, but it seems I was wrong on that point too.

Hearthstone was generating [~$20M/month](https://gamerant.com/heartstone-profit-monthly-900/) in 2015, while WoW was making blizzard [~$180M/month](https://www.gamerevolution.com/features/13510-world-of-warcraft-leads-industry-with-nearly-10-billion-in-revenue) in 2017.
---
Mostly just Japanese games.
---
Yup. Been posted a billion times.
---
Thats not true anymore, BfA be thanked for that. Hearthstone was, in April 2019, Rank 9 from 10 in the most selling PC games category. WoW was not even in it anymore. Hearthstone makes a lot more cash for Blizzard than WoW nowadays.

I'll be honest, I'd rather take a Blizzard that compromise it's artistic integrity to make money than have a blizzard that is now so overrun by neopuritains SJW that they are now replacing anything not ULTRA pc.

Sadly, they are in reality both.

I'm more interested in Fire Fly, Servant of Ragnaros
---
Why should it be? It's a balanced card, mana cheating is a problem. If you would get two 4-drops from a mountain giant that you played for 4 mana, that would be great.
---
The Raid decks were legit in this game
---
Dude that's literally every Warcraft twist in the past.  They need to get original and stop with the one note piano, it's getting sad how bad the writing is.
---
I'm very happy about Mindblast going. Every time I think I've got an interesting value-based priest deck, it turns out to just be better with Mindblast, and that makes it immediately boring to me.
---
Custom Hearthstone cards and generally custom cards have a lot of issues generally. Many of the more popular designs I've seen are either too complex, actually unworkable for whatever reason, very similar to other already established designs (perhaps adding a reference to the Old gods of bananas), broken beyond belief because cool, or sound much stronger than they actually are.
---
You'll see most of that on the frontpage right now.
---
The standards for making a card that won't ever be added to the game and making cards that will be are very different, but you probably don't care to know about the minutia.
---
Thousands a month? You‚Äòd have a complete collection after two months, and then what would you spend money on? I mean... unless you were aiming for a complete golden collection, but honestly who would be so weird?

This isn't quite correct. It sort of drifts around, and quickly spikes before reaching the pity timer, but it definitely isn't the same all the time. You can see a chart [here](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/hearthstone_packs_are_rigged-590x334.jpg). A similar thing happens for Epics, but I don't know if it's been charted.
---
Fifthies
---
I get where they are coming from with this change. I do think there is still a way for them to keep the art tho, if they ask for your age when you make your account and your over a certain age you should have the option to switch between ‚Äúless graphic mode‚Äù and a mode with the cards we know them as today. I‚Äôm not a fan of they‚Äôre new update
---
Looks like it‚Äôs just barely lethal.
---
Listen here you somofabit
---
Did the tavern brawl update already come or did I just try to brawl in the one hour of the week its not available
---
It's not that they only appeal to men, it's that they are designed with the primary purpose of titillating men.
---
Blizzard will surely use this card art and name in the next expansion. 3 years after they release this card, Blizzard will change the artwork.
---
That's a silly name. I think it should be called "Shuffle Twist"
---
With the latest update, my app decided to download the high res card textures and additional assets without permission on my mobile data... I got a text after loading the app so switched out to respond, I came back to the usual "do you want to download on mobile data?" message I hit no, and 5 minutes later I got a text from my cell provider that I'd used up my monthly bandwidth.  It had downloaded 600MB while I was sending a text, without permission.

---
To be honest, I do not see where they're coming from (unless it was for China release). You see more skin on any American beach than you do in any Hearthstone card art, past or present.
---
Are they making the card art for then or the fans?
---
Control priest. Infiltrator, grave horror, mass ressurrection, catrina etc. Some irish guy was playing it on stream yesterday at rank 5 (IIRC) and doing alright, looked like the old grindy fatigue priest.
---
Take your wack opinions back to your quarantined sub.
---
They took some titties and blood out of a kids card game. It's not a big deal. Grow up and deal with it.
---
Did. Nox was maybe old. Fixed it. Thx
---
Shuffle Warlock really doesn't have a win condition right now, and even with a Plot Twist shuffling and drawing nine cards, the quest will likely only be completed around turn eight.
---
That'll be more than enough time for aggro to finish the job all that Life Tapping started.
---
Tried didn't work unfortunately
---
I think DS/IF absolutely are on that list of things that could be removed from priest. The interaction is all combo and doesn't make interesting plays.
---
&gt;you probably don't care to know about the minutia
---
As if knowledge of "the minutia" came from an extensive experience in game design on your part. Pretientious jackass.
---
I was just thinking about doing this, maybe it will work
---
damn...

OUTJERKED YET AGAIN (pun not intended)
---
Exactly.. people who actually play Hearthstone don't care about this.
---
It's just media and Reddit that makes a big fuss about it. And then you have Blizzard haters who jump on the bandwagon circle jerking each other.
---
This was my first thought even though I never raided BT but played BC

In a recent update, several cards [had their art changed](https://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-card-art-changes/). Various reactions and speculation ensues.
---
And that was appropriate because it was a reference to HP Lovecraft‚Äôs ‚ÄúShadow over Innsmouth‚Äù. I‚Äôll also give Murloc Knight a pass because at the time it was the only one, so it was a cute joke about the absurdity of the very idea of Paladin getting murlocs. All other murloc cards for Paladin were a bad idea, although Primalfin Champion and Hydrologist would have been fine if they just weren‚Äôt murlocs.
---
Common sense? Wild isn‚Äôt a balanced format. Anything that exists in wild is the amalgamation of intended decks with the unintended shit that makes them broken. Wild isn‚Äôt deliberate by any means. Blizzard makes decks for standard, after all of the stuff that would make a deck broken has rotated or nerfed. Wild is only there to satisfy people that want to keep using rotated cards to play the broken decks that Blizzard doesn‚Äôt support anymore.
---
Releasing Scargil wasn‚Äôt them trying to buff quest Murloc, for example. It was a standard card that happened to go into the Wild deck.
---
Blizzard makes shit for standard, not wild.
---
No worries! I remember being a little confused when this brawl first came around as well. Have fun with it :)
---
‚ÄúWe want out artists to feel good about their work on the set by tossing it in the trash.‚Äù
---
The problem Is...brightwing only kidnap parts of him...so...that's gross and would make hearthstone 18+
---
It‚Äôs about the message. If Blizzard finds a couple drops of blood too offensive... well...
---
ya, the thing is a spook
---
hots was fun for a bit...
---
Just my opinion:  If you are going to craft one of the two "full deck" legendaries, I would definitely go with Whizbang.  It is more powerful (better decks) and more variable (larger number of decks).
---
U mean like I did in yesterday‚Äôs post and what everyone else has, and the tweets I sent them explaining also.
---
Or the plethora of other posts explaining this also....
---
If u going to offer advice, try reading what‚Äôs been posted 100‚Äôs of times already by people explaining the problem.
---
During the last patch, hearthstone devs changed a lot of art that featured either blood/gore and vaguely "sexual" characters (succubus, secret keeper, etc). This changed was not announced beforehand and the community has been up in arms over the sudden and unprovoked censorship of cards.
---
Oh wow
---
But my crops always fail, so I gave up, and took up shitposting!

---
You get wild nerfs because people bitch too much.
---
Blizzard better sensor this man, his overwhelming sex appeal is killing me and hurting my grades.
---
wooooaahh wtf. That is fucking shit man. srsly fuck that. Thanks for the info.
---
Just to add to the previous answer. You can duplicate cards if they get sent back to your hand. For example, if you play a minion and it gets sapped you will now have 2 copies of it (one in your deck and one in your hand). So be careful with sapping strong minions to your opponents hand and shadow-stepping weak ones to your hand. Conversely, you can get rid of cards by discarding them. This makes warlock very strong in this brawl since you can discard your bad starting cards.
---
Wait until the expansion comes out. The meta will  change then.
---
I agree on that fuck that change. Thnx mate
---
Same
---
&gt; [Wisdomball] was actually pretty bad for me in the run because a big strategy of my deck was to [try to win], and this made that impossible.
---
I think that's the consensus.
---
Oh boy you missed out, BT was fucking amazing. One of my favorite raids ever.
---
Rastakhan's wasn't the worst because it involved the newest WOW expansion which I found refreshing but after that it was back ta hearthstone exclusives.
---
OMG I am literally shaking right now. I thought this game is family friendly.
---
Wait and see, don‚Äôt throw anything when we are that close to expansion dude... otherwise, if you really want to go for a deck, as you want aggro, Hunter Mech is by far the most efficient atm
---
These posts are getting SO OLD.

Nope.

I‚Äôm not much of an aggro player but I think Rafaam makes Zoo Warlock really fun. This has always been fairly competitive for as long as I‚Äôve been play Hearthstone.
---
And you probably don‚Äôt need to dust much to craft those cards!
---
I guess I'll make a post like this tomorrow?
---
Mine locked on the titlescreen, and my notification bar showed hearthstone downloading an update (within the app, not from the play store). Once that finished, the app crashed and reopening it from there worked fine.
---
Craft a Bomb Hunter. 
---
It's good for new players because it's a straight-forward deck. You'll make less mistakes. It has a nice matchup spread against most the other top decks, so you won't be logging into "auto-lose" matchups.
---
You got a card from another class? tf are you on about? Is this a "wewlad I got alakir" post?

Well Elise in ungoro was a 5/5 and was a 3/5 in loe. I don't really see the point of keeping stats consistent either.
---
Haven't played in a few days and this happens. Well. Guess I'm playing another game until they fix it.
---
A Succubus and a hen ... or is it called a C..k (damn those chinese just beep me)
---
It seems Blizzard decided that was going to be too much work this time around. Or that they wanted to influence all the western third-party websites to change their versions of the cards so that chinese players wouldn't be forced to notice the difference.
---
I‚Äôm not convinced we‚Äôre quite there yet.
---
I played rogue versus warlock. I ended up with a ton of lackeys, opponent got shriek. 
---
Basically every turn was me flooding the board then opponent clearing. Went on for like 20 turns till I quit. Would not recommend.

This is easily the worst Tavern Brawl. From the absolutely snail-like pace of my opponents' turns to the RNG fiesta of these Discover buckets to the tool tips that replay every single turn, I cannot imagine a more boring and tedious brawl experience than this.
---
yes and as soon as you're dialed in with your three tier 1 decks, blizzard will nerf one card and eliminate one entire deck from viability. I wouldnt spend any actual money on it till the consistency in card design begins.
---
I really loved bite art work, now it looks like looney toons...
---
Why is everyone being a jerk about it. [[Pilfer]] used to give a card from your opponent's class. They only changed it recently.
---
The thing that I don't understand is that the sexy cards (ie what 90% of the bitching is about) aren't even censored? Succubus, I guess, although it just seems like they wanted to make a minor 'discard hound' tribal. But the other three are still big breasted ladies in skimpy outfits and sexy poses, they just aren't doing the goofy Rob Liefeld tits n' ass poses anymore.

1/-/- | Add a random card to your hand (from your opponent's class).  
---
If you play warlock and get soulfire it is pretty easy to discard your junk, getting it out of your deck.
---
Hell Queen of Pain has more skin showing than Mistress of Pain.
---
No, the math on that is very bad.  Been a few thousand cards printed, most of which have been bad.  The vast vast majority have stayed bad.  There's no reason to keep tens of thousands of dust tied up in bad cards in the maybe 1% chance that one of them becomes good.
---
And even if a bad card turns good, all you do is lose access to a deck.  If you keep those thousands of dust locked up in bad cards, you lose access to far more decks.
---
I assume any parent with taunt would be ok
---
I mean, in theory printing new lackeys could make Rogue worse if the Lackeys weren't very good. A "Battlecry: Restore 2 Health to your hero" lackey would more or less nerf decks that rely on Lackeys across the board.
---
Yeah, maybe it's trying to make me the guinea pig for those stats.
---
It feels like they completely failed to take into account combo decks with the builder.
---
But to be fair, the math for calculating win rates of cards that takes into account combos of cards is possibly one of tricky computational problems.
---
I'd like to see how far down the rabbit hole they take it.
---
Why they have to censor it, lol have many ultra sexy art in the game and I don't see any censorship or is it?
---
Rank 18 for ya
---
Well, if we go too deep into the weeds we can also reach the conclusion that vilifying female sexuality also has been opressive and harmful towards women.
---
\&gt;  The use of sexuality from women is framed in this case as literally demonic
---
So is it's removal. Succubus literaly got removed because management deemed female sexuality as demonic.
---
Yeah a white glow over someone's ass for 2 seconds in a 15 hour video game is Serious Business, and is inevitably leading to the downfall of video games everywhere...
---
waiting for mothers of america to catch wind and she gets nerf'd
---
IIRC some of them had a playable enemy decks too. Rag/Onyxia were I think. Don't have them on hand here to check.
---
Zero of them became more sexualized. Some arguably have more skin showing, but even with more skin, they are *very* clearly less sexualized.
---
I admit my defeat, though I stated I did not play much aggro.
---
CHAOS CONTROL
---
I don't want a stupid fucking Murloc for Paladin.
---
SOMEONE is.
---
*awwww shitttttttttttttt, now it's littttttttttttttttt*
---
Thanks for the info! How do I know if I‚Äôve received the guaranteed legendary yet?
---
a silk dress could be better than the cheap pants overpaint they used on hots alextrasza and hs whitemane, but still not a good idea
---
And what exactly are you concerned about
---
Are you going to explain why or just leave it like that?
---
Or I just don't believe in a slippery slope that extreme? The kinds of things we're allowed to do and see in AAA video games is so much broader than even 10 years ago, and the only people who think we're somehow backsliding were 5 years old when censorship was actually a problem in gaming.
---
Just as a random example... the hot coffee minigame in San Andreas is incredibly tame compared to most of the shit we see today, was inaccessible in the final product, and there was still an outcry trying to get the game pulled from shelves just because it could be restored with a mod. We are so far beyond that now, we're not magically backsliding because you can see marginally less of Secretkeepers ass.

[Myr posted a deck guide for their Aggro Shaman](https://twitter.com/myr_1579/status/1146402908402905091?s=19). (It's in Japanese.)
---
Im on ios and the hs is working
---
It's because it's still the incorrect angry chicken art!
---
and the dragon form of Kazakus on a card (we've seen it in promo art)
---
It's a cock
---
I'd love it if we got them as hero cards, or at least one of them, but I *highly* doubt we will.
---
Assuming they're minions, I think you might be onto something.
---
Yeah some many issues with this patch-.-
---
I can not use any deck codes on iPhone and iPad, the Game goes straight to the Main menu and then crashes...
---
This is another violence meme post I'm sure
---
Welcome to the circle jerk pal
---
you don't have to take my advice but recently i just started a new f2p account and even tough i struggled a bit in the begging with tge cards i have you xan craft cheap good deks quite quickly. Try to do your quest and in my opinion only open classic packs or the latest expansion packs. You can get around 20 free packs just from quests when you start, also play rise of shadow solo you get 3 packs for the 1st wing which is free.
---
Yeah, art didn't kill wow tcg, hearthstone, dodgy dealings with Upper Deck etc. But not the art style...
---
Maybe Dr. Boom is broken, too?
---
I believe he's relating it to the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union.
---
Hi kuweii. You can actually see when a comment is edited. If you bothered checking it out you would see my comment was edited far before anything was confirmed or got any replies. But you still went ahead to call me out as a liar without even bothering with such a basic check. Nobody in my friend circle has ever dared to imply I'm ever lying because I never gave them reason to. I hope you reconsider checking because your comment made me feel bad
---
Have you guys never seen the flag of the USSR
---
Matching stats like that is a nice to have so that people see the link. It is one of those design things that feels good.
---
However those numbers are really good for balancing cards and determining what else you can combo them with. There are a ton of factors that go into deciding the numbers on a card. The aesthetic of matching numbers vs balance vs tempo vs combo potential.
---
Right, because they didn't make Mario 3. If they did you can bet they would charge you that much if not more for it.
---
You know how it felt like they didn't put any thought at all into Warsong's nerf? That was the common criticism at the time. I'm saying they didn't put any thought at all with Succubus's change, which is why I'm saying she got Warsong'd. Cause it's the same amount of thought that got put into these decisions.
---
For anyone who likes the concept behind this brawl, I want to point you toward checking out Dominion, the first deck building game. I decided to pick up Dominion several months ago because of how much I liked the concept behind this brawl when it first came out, and I'm really enjoying Dominion so far.
---
!remind me next time this guy writes an article so I can be sure not to click on that crap
---
Thank you! This has fixed my nox problem.
---
For a broader collection, there is no real way around buying, but for competitive sake, cheap decks can take you to Legend.
---
Even though I've spent 100s, I often look to take expensive full versions of decks and trim them down - you don't need every last card to make a deck work. Eg: Rafaam and Soularium in Zoolock. Of course, this requires some thinking on your own part, and just ignore the stupid urge to spend 4k dust on a full decklist from a streamer you watched just because it looked good, and make your own cheaper version.

Oh it was fucking awesome especially on iOS.

---
It's a one player game when u meet mages and warriors. Quit whining you NPC Hunter!
---
There‚Äôs a card in Gwent that pretty much depicts the beginning of a rape. Surprising that this is the one they found to be ‚Äútoo much‚Äù.
---
Hey Folks,
---
This really bites... sorry about that! So, the team is aware of the issue and is working to track down a permanent fix.
---
In the meantime, we have a workaround until we get a fix in: uninstall and re-install the app. This should let you patch up properly and not get stuck at the Tavern doors.
---
Cheers,

On Android, I cleared the cache and deleted the app's data. It repatched and it worked.

...it‚Äôs just cartoon tits man you can find millions of these on the internet
---
Which one do you mean?
---
headcrack wnet from one of best goldens to one of worst cards in look in general.
---
R means R-rated: Blood, violence, and nudity.
---
Well the previous art had armor in the back and armor is usually used in fighting and fighting is badddddddddddd...
---
Nice job skimming over the fact that you contradict yourself in your own explanation.  
---
But yeah.  Don‚Äôt forget about rag lightlord.
---
This really bites... sorry about that! Just so everyone is aware, the team is on it, working to track down a permanent fix for this pesky issue.

As zaqwsx01 + many of you have mentioned, there is a workaround that should work for most folks in the meantime: uninstall and re-install the app. This should let you patch up properly and not get stuck at the Tavern doors.

Her new card is gonna be 7/5 to keep with projected stat increase
---
Yeah oppression was maybe not the right word choice, but PC Gamer clearly didn't try to give more visibility to those lower on the totem pole.  It's not like Dave Kosak needed them to give him a chance to respond, if he made a tweet or commented here it would be widely circulated.

You're not going to note how, in the LoE expansion, Rafaam was after the STAFF of Origination, which he clearly somehow has based on his art in [[Arch-Thief Rafaam]], and is taking it to the HALL of Origination?

Thanks Mike

So this is what they mean when they say we are now hearthstone circlejerk
---
There was a reason she was called thighmane. I'm disappointed.
---
She does actually wear a kind of dress in some of the later issues of the WoW comic. #16 and #21, if memory serves.
---
I totally forgot this card existed...but I won't ever forget the in card description...not that it changes anything for me though (don't interpret that wrong, or do)
---
Is it a gun made of magic wands (that fires magic)? Or a gun that fires magic wands as projectiles?
---
Either way, I'm in, but I hope it's the latter.

&gt; Cards that you want to avoid:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ANYTHING THAT ADDS CARDS TO YOUR HAND
---
Except Antonidas. Antonidas carried me.
---
Except the whole premise of wild makes it implicit that there will be broken mechanics and that it will be unbalanced.
---
I started in BC, and I have played Classic WoW in the past. You could tell there was love in making of that game compared to what it is today. MoP had that love, too. I haven't played since WoD, but WoD didn't seem to have it. I can't say for certain for Legion. Granted, it could just be me.
---
Baited arrow will be the next nerf
---
Heist first, then arena. Heist is at least a couple weeks of fun in total, and way more if you go for 100% completion (completed each wing with each hero, each hero power, each deck, and both difficulties)
---
Fire festival should start in 1-2 weeks I think 7 packs and 400 gold expected
---
Because it‚Äôs not something likely to happen. I thought it was well established that sexual and ideological content in media is censored in China. As such, companies like Blizzard don‚Äôt have very much reason to risk their access to the Chinese market over some art/card design choices. While they‚Äôre obviously not purging all vaguely sexual content in the game, at the very least, I doubt that they‚Äôd decide to reintroduce a ‚ÄúSuccubus‚Äù for little gain. 
---
But hey, I might be wrong, and either way it‚Äôs not a huge deal. The deadly shot art change bothers me more just because it‚Äôs a card easy to recognise by its art which is now different, though that‚Äôs not hard to get used to either.
