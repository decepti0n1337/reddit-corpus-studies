But Warrior is already loaded with removal. Even Execute is rarely ran. This is a good card but it faces stiff competition.

Has it really been though? It's got that **beast** tag.

Pretty weak non apology. I think it'll work on people who just want an excuse to stop boycotting but let's be real, the boycott was going to stop the next time something new came out for them anyway.
---
Hope we get a Beetlejuice minion
---
What's deal wit blizz and that imp obsession. They're trying to hard to make zoolock the only archetype available to warlock, isn't?
---
FOUR MANA 8! 8!
---
I think it will see constructed play. Dragon synergy + comeback mechanism and a huuuge body. Maybe even with sunfury protector
---
1. Admit that they threw the book at Blitzchung to placate the CCP.
---
2. Admit that if they want people to leave real-world politics at the door, their response violated that principle too.
---
3. State that they won't make knee-jerk decisions out of political expedience like this in the future.
---
4. Revert the censored Hearthstone cards.
---
My dad does this too, fun fun
---
1. The initial punishment was too great
---
2. Blizzard should make changes to their process to increase transparency and reliability
---
3. I don't want to stop talking about it until that happens
---
4. I want to keep playing the games, but only if I can be reasonably sure that its not being censored by a government I have no say in
---
5. Taking these actions can be in Blizzard's financial interest and is supported by their core values.

I'm trying to find the sarcasm in your message or where it would have been useful and I'm coming up short. Were you trying to say cool story bro?

He already took at least 1 fatigue so it would be 2+3+4+5+6+1+7 = 28 damage. Unless the fatigue counter is higher in which case it could be a lot more damage
---
They literally did nothing, ya.  What did his direct shot at blizzard do for hong kong?  Lol, bet he‚Äôs getting a national holiday there for his key boarding, thats some world class stuff.
---
Damn my master plan of play this against someone who runs The Darkness is ruined.
---
Well, I'd like to see stats on this, but I'd bet they hero power 3 times or more in quite a lot of games. And current hunters aren't just "smorc" either (secrets and stuff aren't face damage). 
---
A face damage hunter will on average hero power more than 3 times, even if not forced to.
---
Probably in Dragon Warrior.
---
It's hard to get new people to play auto battlers. When I first saw auto chess it looked like a whole bunch of bullshit going on that I couldn't even begin to comprehend. I watched streamers play it and started playing myself and put over 300 hours into it. Now I have over 400 hours in underlords. I think these games are dying because they can't get new players and they become stail quickly which requires almost weekly updates to keep things fresh. Underlords just had a massive update and I'm hoping they can bring in players when the game launches 1.0 but I'm skeptical.

---
You guys are being so disingenuous. Even Blitzchung himself doesn‚Äôt try to make the bull shot arguments you guys are making:
---
&gt;	‚ÄúFirst of all, I‚Äôm grateful for Blizzard reconsidering their position about my ban. Earlier this week, I told media that I knew I might have penalty or consequence for my act, because I understand that my act could take the conversation away from the purpose of the event. 
---
Even most public figures taking his side say the same thing. This is the exact sort of behavior that events have rules like this for. This isn‚Äôt simply a case of twisting a rule to fit a situation it wasn‚Äôt intended for. You aren‚Äôt wrong it is written ambiguously to be able to be applied widely if needed, but that is not at all the same as saying this *was* inappropriately used in a situation this sort of rules isn‚Äôt intended for. 
---
How Blizzard fucked up was how extreme they made the punishment and how it made it obvious they were just bending under Chinese pressure. The fact that they would punish him over this was almost a given. The reason it is so inappropriate is because of how far they took the punishment.
---
Yes, when plated beetle was printed,

Does Mojomaster give empty crystals? In 99% of cases she‚Äôs played even players are already over 5 mana, so it‚Äôs just subtracting the others. Is it confirmed she gives empty mana crystals if somehow played before turn 5?
---
Per class
---
This is more of a "Shadow Madness/Pint-Sized Potion -&gt; Divine Spirit x2 -&gt; Inner Fire" kinda target.
---
Well, build your board next turn if your deck is empty, which is a lot worse. Unless you have a way to draw the turn you play it, which isn't easy to do with the current card pool.

The stats are seriously freaking nuts. Beyond vanilla stats+a great tribal tag+a beneficial effect?

A sorry is a promise, not an undo button. It will be interesting to see if this will sway some of the boycotters.
---
why?
---
I doubt it though. I‚Äôm pretty sure the hero classes are going to receive something just as big. Maybe more non duplicate deck cards
---
I was the opposite, I first saw the original auto chess on a stream (like before it exploded in popularity), I didn't really fully know about it, and at the time, the game didn't document itself well, and so I had to learn each unit by buying it in game, and honestly it was most fun back then, no one knew how to optimize builds, everyone just doing random shit, it was casual fun
---
now it's too competitive, but the game mode is by design not meant for super competitive play, considering how much RNG there is

Move to China then, you support them so much maybe your social credit score can get you a cheaper subway ticket or not brutally beaten to a pulp or even murdered for standing against the government.

Nope, you're incorrect. Malygos's is the correct possessive form of Malygos. The terminal apostrophe is only used for the possessive form of a plural noun. Malygos is singular, hence Malygos's.
---
When mages get another hero card, we can talk.
---
This card seems really strong. This is pretty flexible for an 8 mana card. It's a board clear against tempo/aggro decks than can leave a body behind, and against control/combo/spell heavy decks it's a 12/12 beat stick. 
---
Also, as others have noted, a nutty result off of using mutate/witchy lackey on a Mogu Fleshshaper.

Yes
---
3 1/1s that have soft taunt since Necromechanic on T5 (the earliest turn after completion) pushes that damage to 18 on T5. The optimized opening for the preceding statement would be Coin+ Double Toxic on T1. 
---
More significantly, this card can fit into multiple deck types, requiring no build-around., as well as functioning as a decent discover target. That is my favorite thing about the card.

Having your deck revolve around a legendary makes for some seriously awful times when you just can‚Äôt draw it on time and your opponent slams theirs down on curve. Also any threats that your opponent can‚Äôt remove are generally really awful for them to play against

Good bot
---
That's not how it works, dawg. If you play this on your turn 4. You have an 8/8 and no more mana. Then you pass to an opponent with 10 mana.

"I said the words, now stop being upset". It's not just saying the words, there needs to be some sort of action. Like I'm not demanding that they flagellate endlessly over it, but "accountability" without action is meaningless when applied to corporations.

Having said that, I'm not sure what I *actually* want from them, but I do want *something*. They aren't one of my best friends apologizing to me over an argument, they're a corporation.

It is a form of powercreep, but yes of course it is not particularly creeping the power level of the game at large.

5/-/- | Deal 4 damage. Costs (1) less for each minion that died this turn.  
---
Oh boy. They did say that they acted too hastily and won't do so in the future. They already took action by publicly apologizing and lowering the penalties. Blizzard never said they would "defend the dignity of China" the, so often mistranslated, message was written by NetEase, a Chinese company that had no influence on the process. 
---
So no, it's not just words. They took action. 
---
But if you're one of them "Anyone should be allowed to say anything at any time or else it's census" then nothing will satisfy you. That's not how anything in this world works.

except druid's ysera...

You don't have to use 8 mana in 1 turn and you'll be spending them to advance your deck's objective anyway
---
A 12/12 and 3 8/8s still isn't as broken as Snip Snap Warlock's turn 4.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they had this planned from the beginning
---
I think it's less that mage didn't get good cards (way to early to tell anyway), but more that this legendary card isn't as exciting, discovering spells (albeit super spells) isn't very fresh
---
It was played a little bit back when rastakhan first came out
---
It was solidly tier 2 before the nerfs to conjurers and pocket galaxy. The new maly probably won't make up for those losses but it sure is a start.
---
Oh yeah I completely forgot about it.
---
Omg you are so right.
---
it has to be a sarcastic comment right?
---
This card is actually op, if the crystals arent empty. It would be *better* than a regular 4 Mana 8/8
---
Who would win, alpha Chad Deathwing dragon, or one smol snail boi?
---
Great work!
---
I think that's missing some detail.
---
1. Set your mana crystals to 10 empty mana crystals. You always end up with 0 mana left after it resolves.
---
2. Set you mana crystals to 10 full mana crystals. You always end up with 10 mana left after it resolves.
---
3. Fill your remaining mana crystals with empty mana crystals. If you play this turn 6 with 6 full mana crystals, you end up with 2 mana left.
---
4. Fill your remaining mana crystals with full mana crystals. If you play this turn 6 with 4 mana (4 full and 2 spent crystals), you end up with 4 mana left.
---
5. Set your mana crystals to 10, and then spend the mana. No matter what mana you have you always end up with 6 mana left after it resolves.
---
I'd bet quite a bit that it's option 3.
---
It would be a pretty garbage card if they were empty... you get an 8/8, and then your opponent gets to spend 10 mana?  Against any deck with a decent mid/late game, you're going to be stuck on the back foot.  Which is essentially why biology project ended up seeing almost no play.

No wonder Blizzard treats their customers like sheep...

Why would Blitzchung deserve to be unbanned? He still deserves to be punished for breaking the rules

This is much better. 1) this is blizzards slogan 2) it's the hong kong flag. 
---
This is pretty direct and to the point while being clean and very Blizz specific
---
He broke their rules. Consider that as a part of the "contract" you were talking about. Blitzchung breached the contract and was punished.
---
Honestly, I support a short (under 6 month) ban, and not taking away the prize money. The outrage was about how overkill Blizzard was with their punishment, not the fact that Blitzchung got in any trouble at all.
---
I understand this aspect of it, but I never quite got why the casters were punished so harshly. How are they responsible for what Blitzchung said?
---
&gt; You associate sets with keywords.
---
i kinda really dont lol
---
this in warlock is a 2/2 rush plus 2 1/1 imps
---
its 4 mana 4/4 with 2 rushing damage

To be honest rogue can keep discovering dragons and spells with their lackeys. I can be very strong with blesses from RNGesus

you mean the meta from Rise of the Mech? which this OP says was bad?

Because the nature of the game is such that it punishes non tier 1 decks.  Since the  card pool is so small.

honestly I dont think there exsists an absolute answer to whether or not an issue is debateable, however, tho seemingly unfair to some, I would suggest that it should be discussed among intellectuals, and since we already have some values that we all agree upon such as freedom and human rights, we should base our judgement with these. there will always be less intelligent/ educated people who believe wrongs to be right but I doubt those in important positions and have say (in this case Bliazzard higherups) are smart enough not to think and act stupid.

Well you can play Khartut a turn after this card lol

now i'm just sad about the lack of legendary... uh... ravens.

The game that autochess was made from is closer to 2 games that blizzard already have (because it was built off them), and instead of using that they're using a different game.

---
You seem to think that collective bargaining and striking are the same thing. Since you're not in a union I'll explain how we do things.
---
A year before the contract is going to end, we start negotiating.  Local unions give their inputs to the national branch, who do most of the negotiating with the company. Everything is done through civil discourse.  A contract proposal gets sent out to the union membership after the negotiations. It either passes, or it gets rejected and there are further negotiations.  Strikes only occur if the union and company never come to an agreement.
---
Collective bargaining happens all the time without inconveniencing anyone.
---
Well let's be clear, there are plenty of places in the U.S. where you can get your ass beat by cops for protesting, even nonviolently. But I'm not expecting "a bunch of nerds protesting at a video game fan convention in Orange County" to end in a throwdown.
---
How can you cash out when it's played for free?
---
Send bob
---
Of course they're not full, why would they ever give you a 14 mana turn starting with a 4 mana 8/8
---
I dont have to. I have them in TFT and Underlords already.
---
This. This right here is true love.
---
Wouldn't it be less surprising since your opponent knows you got a Legendary card while Pilfer could get you literally anything?

---
Not always better than Hallucination, sometimes you'd rather discover a good spell. And theres a lot of great class minions that aren't legendary.
---
Reminds me of \[\[Sherazin, Corpse Flower\]\] who told you to be infinite value, but that card had horrible stats and playing 4 cards wasn't so easy when it was out.   
---
This here just wants you to draw cards, i think i can do this,
---
nobody#1407 EU 80g trade, I show you go first
---
Oh wait holy fucking shit, this is an actual card!? Thought I was in Custom Hearthstone.
---
Will the candle summon a Waxadred if the original hasn't yet died?
---
It's the same Hallucination. Which is a great card but not insane at all.
---

4/5/3 | Deathrattle: Go dormant. Play 4 cards in a turn to revive this minion.  
---
What? No way. It's basically as good as Hallucination.
---
Thats all they care about, the funny Trolden videos
---
man, I'm having so much fun too &lt;3
---
there's a lot of meta diversity in HS too, if you don't queue at all and instead just play with your friends casually
---
/dab
---
I think the whole idea of dragon hunter expands on highlander hunter, same with the hero power secret guy can work with secret hunter. The dragon stuff can be alternate win con  for quest druid. 
---
The new stuff seems to go nicely with the hunter and mage quests (wanting to hero power in hunter and wanting to play spells in mage). 
---
But the whole purpose of the initial card release is to get our minds turning about all the new things that could possibly be made and hoping for more support for the new things we are thinking about. Then overtime there will be more cards that can look like support for previous stuff. 
---
TL;DR: Too early to tell
---
The holy f2p card!  
---
With this your name will be chad.
---
Wait till the weekend ends. They need to put out an update for all of this stuff. Sadly tomorrow is the weekend so the probably won't come out till monday or tuesday at the latest.
---
Mutate.
---
But the player is banned. Nice.
---
They can be upgraded too, like Barrier can give more armor, Mirror Image can summon 2 copies instead of 1. I can't really think of anything for Counterspell or Vaporize, so make them 1 mana.
---
It's not very f2p-friendly, is my point. In practice, anyone who plays the new expansion will have access to that stuff because they will have bought packs anyway, but Blizzard still decided to paywall parts of the new mode. It's like a compulsion at this point.
---
So did I. It's not original.
---
The blog post says that each two invocations double the effect of the battlecry. Also I didn‚Äôt realise that ever invoke card you play also casts Galakrond‚Äôs hero power, so any invoke card in rogue also adds a random lackey to your hand.
---
Compared to shaman and druid breath, this is underwhelming
---
Keep in mind we saw a 4 mana 7/7 already, so albeit the stats are decent, its not as nuts as you think.
---
Going off of your theory for Priest I'd guess that Murozond will be the Priest dragon legendary.
---
Yes, it could be worse. But I don't like the principle of paywalling parts of the new mode. And again, one of the perks is stats. Blizzard can't stop parodying themselves.
---
Ah okay, thank you! Normally i am not this fast with buying new stuff xD
---
It selects from class cards only and gives access to legendary weapons in Wild. That makes the card's effect much stronger than neutral eligible discovers, and is generally better than Hallucination. This, like Stolen Steel, is a stronger effect than Hallucination, but isn't priced at the damning 2 Mana discover slot (making it not unplayable garbage like Stolen Steel).
---
It's not definitively better than (old) wild growth. Will have to see if Druid gets enough solid Dragons/Dragon support cards first. Does look strong though.
---
There's also no competing with other people for units, afaik.  The deckbuilding part is purely solitaire.  There doesn't seem to be too much you can do to target other players either, like if you know someone's going for murlocs.
---
Matches last 30 minutes and like 75% of that time is waiting or watching animations, I already got impatient watching my third game of it.
---
The invoke cards will continue to give you the hero power benefit.
---
Year of the dragon = one month of dragons
---
The whole auto battler is looks like a pile of crap. They developed this instead of tournament mode.
---
It only gains attack, not health.
---
Yes.
---
Flavour. Come on, inspire was associated with The Grand Tournament, knights, contenders, this kind of stuff. What does a lizard have to do with inspiring some1 or being inspired?
---
Plus if you played it on turn 10 after having spent 6 mana already, it would give you 10 more mana for a 16 mana turn with a free 8/8 with no drawback whatsoever (since the opponent was already at 10 mana).
---
Yeah, not likely.
---
in todays hearthstone you need powerspike turns like that three times in a row for it to be a viable strategy. doing one powerful thing in your game doesnt cut it anymore
---
My guess is we will too, they need to wrap up the story and the Battlegrounds don¬¥t do that. That will come with some additional 20 packs or so, and maybe a legendary as well, so might actually get that instead.
---
When I think about the fact that for 50 or 40 dollars I can get a full relatively new AAA game...that might be worth it more to me than being able to play a few more decks to be honest.
---
Hey look, it‚Äôs Smaug
---
You know there is a much more direct personal comparison than buying stolen stuff... The more fitting personal equivalent is that socially shunning someone for something motivates their associates to get them to not show that behavior when they are somewhere together out of fear of being caught in the backslash. That can apply to both negative ("stop shouting nazi slogans Mark") and positive behavior (like voicing a positive opinion that either a government or just local people disapprove of). 
---
In that comparison he argued that the friends should just let them say/do what they say (because the friends/associates suppressed positive behavior because they worried another separate group they deal with might hear and react negatively). (Personally I think it is both fine to try to get your friend not to be an ass and blizzard to prevent some of the more extreme negative behavior on a stream, but blizzard has more power in the situation than peer disapproval so I expect a greater barrier to action. But where I draw the line isn't really relevant here.) 
---
And he said that he would act against the friend if he was an asshole which you then took to mean he would act against his associates to punish him though he didn't quite say that. (Yes he said everything in his power, that tends to come with the implicit qualifier of "that I am fine with doing". Imo you shouldn't just assume that acting against associates as tactic is included in that and base your entire argument on an assumption about their statement.) Now if he actually said he would punish blizzard I guess your reply would be reasonable since direct actions against blizzard crosses the line to your thief example which is reasonable to criticize. But since he didn't and it is just something you took as his position to strengthen your case, it sounds, in effect, like the usual don't criticize companies for following perverse incentives to me.
---
&gt;And recognizing that corporations act out of self-interest because they exist in a system that incentivizes it isn't the same as absolving them of blame if you object to the nature of the system itself.
---
It effectively is if brought up almost everytime companies get criticized for unethical behavior as criticism of criticizing them for it. I don't believe it coming with disapproval of the system changes anything since people often keep that part silent and just protest criticizing the behavior. Take your initial comment, you don't say there is anything bad about the system. If one is optimistic one might guess that you disapprove of the system but that is purely based on thinking someone shouldn't consider that a good state.
---
Inspire wouldn't fit the flavour at all. Really, inspiring/inspired lizard?
---
&gt; Conditional ramping STOPS CREATIVITY.
---
Then all highlander cards and all tribal cards stop creativity, along with "spells matter" cards like sorcerer aprentice or stuff like spitefull summoner. And we all know thats not true.
---
They do give you a bonus if you build the deck in a certain way, for sure. So you will include dragons in your deck. But how many? Which dragons? Can you generate enough dragons by other effects like the draconid lackey to make sure you will have a dragon in hand without having to run a lot of dragons to begin with? Maybe its a pushed card so that druids use dragons now as their lategame condition, and this doesnt means they have to make druid dragons worse to compensate. This makes it so that druids dont use the ramp for stuff like star aligner combos, since normally combo pieces arent dragons (malygos is a dragon though, but its just 1 out of 30 cards). So it actually promotes a ramp, big stuff druid compared to I ramp to 10 in 5 turns and OTK you that would happen without the conditional ramp.
---
But media coverage will extend beyond just Blizzcon attendees, and media is why you do things like this.
---
Because warpath should do 12 damage in your opinion.
---
I feel like this crushes in Shrivalla
---
you can set up to test Zihi. all you need to do is discount several felguards and zihi. if you then play zihi with only lets say 3 crystals, the new ones are indeed empty. so I guess this interaction will be the same
---
Why wouldn't I want  to put bunch of legendaries in my hand?
---
Those will eventually help me win sooner
---
So every breath card is a hint to a legendary.
---
Example Flame Breath in Warrior is Deathwing
---
Dream Breath in Druid is Y'sera
---
So if Shaman with Lightning... is that Altairus?
---
Too weak should've made it 4 mana.
---
Can't win if you're dead.
---
I think you mean worse. That's a combo for plebs.
---
I think it's going to be a lot of fun with the proper tweaking, it's hard to say anything about the longevity of the game mode since this is the first iteration we're seeing. From the gameplay I've seen it looks like poisonous is your friend in any scenario to counter the monster snowball cards, and I wouldn't be surprised if they (eventually) implement some more controlled method of attacking.
---
I'm excited for it
---
he shouldnt be able to appease them with words in a 2 minute speech. thatd be too easy. once they set a track record of continued good actions, then im sure a lot of the displeased crowds will go quieter
---
That's fine. You do you. I'm sure the solo adventure bundle will give you great value as well
---
Hi sure the solo adventure bundle will give you great value as well, I'm dad.
---
AC says *gain* mana crystals, whereas Nozdormu says *set to* mana crystals.
---
But games
---
This is set mana Crystal's not gain mana Crystal's
---
This card really shouldn't be 3 Mana
---
No, not gamers in general, just pieces of scum like you.
---
But... the packs
---
So far I've only liked the paladin's artwork. The rest seems weird to me. Like, too strong colors makes them look like gummybears
---
In an alternate universe, the devs have found a way to fit the hero power on the hero cards.  
---
Perhaps in that empty corner at the bottom left.
---
That isn‚Äôt how zihi works. If you play a discounted copy while you have less than 5 mana (eg in the miniature warfare brawl), it will add empty crystals not full ones
---
You can't have two active quests at once, my friend.
---
It is true that Wild Growth specifies the fact that its given crystal is empty.
---
However, if you would play Zihi with less than 5 mana crystals (innervates/coin), it does actually give you empty crystals.
---
This is the main reason I believe the crystals will effectively be empty.
---
Anyway, we will indeed have to wait and see. I am curious about this one!
---
Of the eight non rogue class legendary minions in uldum I count 2 of them that'd be good off discover.
---
Looking at rise of shadows I again see about 2 or 3 class legendaries that I'd be happy to discover in my rogue deck.
---
Class legendaries are pretty specific and tend to need decent build around to be good.
---
Cries in *overkill*
---
Unfortunately, u have to fight fire with fire. Evolve shaman, murloc shaman are great decks for climbing.
---
I am wondering why Malygos is on the LOE side. He sided with Deathwing during Cataclysm didn‚Äôt
---
he?
---
Tempo Rogue will be nutty with all the greed. Just Sap and kill, GG. No more Evolve also helps.
---
WHAT IS BRUH IS BRUH A HIP TERM FOR KIDS IS BRUH A DRUG SHOULD I BE WORRIED FOR MY SON [U/RTOID](https://reddit.com/u/rtoid/)?!!
---
Myra's activates each of your candles once. So it spawns maybe 2-3 of these at most. Pretty minor compared to everything else rogue does and the space they have to give up for the card and its activators.
---
9 mana 8/8 deal 15 damage to each hero.
---
He accepts the accountability. That means he's gonna resign from his post, right? /s
---
Cum
---
Kripp raving about it in his latest video when he took every opportunity to crap on all other auto-chess games was pretty hilarious.
---
I don't even play auto-chess of any kind and even I can see that this Hearthstone one is a shallow experience compared to all the others.  What I'm getting at is that if Kripp was to criticize any auto-chess game it would be this new one.
---
last expansion is of a year is always overpowered, so you HAVE to buy it but can only use it for 1,3 years
---
Alright, thanks for the insight! That puts some perspective on it. I guess I'll have to try out Draft when my gold balance can handle it, in the meantime I'll see how long I'll be motivated to get the wins in daily.
---
I feel like arena is going to be shaken up with all those hunter hero power cards. They're understated but I feel like they carry a huge tempo boost
---
There were protests outside?
---
When you use zihi to ‚Äúramp‚Äù it gives you empty crystals. Tested it in the miniature warfare brawl. This should be no different
---
[[Zola the Gorgan]], [[Molten reflections]], [[Baleful banker]]
---
There's no way in hell this'll give you a 10 mana refill. Astral Communion comes at a very steep price and the only card that gains you 10 mana is Kun, which has a 7/7 body. Getting to play 10 mana on T4 and gaining an 8/8 on top would be so obviously broken the chance of that happening is zero, no matter the wording. A 6 mana refill would also be broken and there is no reasoning to support that so we can forget that too.
---
Even if, as you say, Pilfer is unplayable (because they increased the value of everything else and made it unplayable)
---
... It does replace Hallucination, in most scenarios.
---
Legendary cards are generally high value ones, even if some suck without synergy.
---
Although you can still make these with 2-drops post Quest

i hope we get compensation if we own her already, if not thats gonna be the end for hearthstone for me. first you give that ragnaros cardback to all the plebs that joined the hypetrain and now tyrande.

Sorry, english isnt my first language.
---
"Everyone I don't agree with is a literal scum."
---
I have a good record against aggressive strategies with Quest Druid, so I‚Äôm sure you could try teching your Quest Druid more towards beating Aggro. Play Wrath, BEEEES!!!, Druid of the Scythe, Crystal Power and anything else you can think of that‚Äôs solid against Aggro.
---
Everytime a card gives you mana crystals, it specifies ^empty.
---
Kun, astral comunion, nourish, don't. 
---
Therefore, it's a 0 Mana 8/8 that gives you ten full mana crystals, I would assume.
---
But not everything is overpowered, there are 5 other expansions with cards that should be worth playing.
---
I wish people would dispense with these sunk cost fallacy circlejerk karma parties and just quit (both the game and the subreddit) if they're not have fun
---
Blizzurt response: buy pack?
---
This is unsafe.
---
Do you have a deck list I can see as a sample?? Thanks!!
---
Hmm I will try (:
---
Nah, if it was people from the custom hearthstone subreddit, most cards would have puns in their names.
---
I think this card is pretty weak, we've long moved past the era of legendaries just being overstated minions now they're mostly under to vanilla started minions that have a specific build around effect.
---
Looking at just the last 2 expansions I saw maybe 3-4 non rogue legendary minions that would be strong to hit. Most of them end up just being vanilla started minions that you overpay for cause you had to play this card 1st.

well there goes your time wasted lmao
---
Warpath isn't a legendary, doesn't have a 7 turn opportunity cost, and even then it's only 2 damage more than a warpath, for 2 less mana which normally translates into 2 more damage and 2 more armour.
---
Nice 11 mana play twitch chat
---
I finished the first 3 chapters but I can't unlock the 4th, anyone else had this issue? I can't click or interact with it in any way

Just admit the ban was motivated by concerns over the chinese market. Stop pretending to have some ulterior motive of keeping politics out of your content. Blizzards community isnt stupid and yet they insist on treating us like we are. 
---
We know the ban was financially motivated. And we know that blizzard doesnt care about keeping politics out of streams (just look at how they promote lgbt in their overwatch league). Well guess what some people find lgbt to be a divisive political issue (regardless of if they are right or wrong) by blizzards own statements shouldnt anyone who has expressed support for lgbt on stream be banned like Blitzchung?
---
If Siamat is left alive, only punish is Zephrys (Blessed Champion) and it's 6/22 chance they have it (in this case they have it but we don't know anything except the rat trap. We only know opponent hasn't played Zephrys). And my newly drawn cards can be enough to remove it.
---
Otherwise we are safe with decent life total.
---
But I don't know the exact deck and how the game went. This is just a speculation from this screenshot. You might be totally right.
---
Edit: Also don't forget we have a taunt too.
---
[deleted]
---
How long did they take to punish Roger for CHEATING?  The discrepancy between the reaction time for both is damning as was their statement about "maintaining China's pride" or some bs on Chinese twitter.  As for whether the CCP would care if it seemed like Blizz was ok with the statement, just look how they basically kicked the NBA off chinese tv for the preseason (not sure if they're back on, now that regular season is going).
---
Permanents bad
---
This post was made by the izzet gang
---
i think a suspension could have been fine for like a month or 2 tops if one was to be given as to bringing politics shouldnt normally be done. blitz did say he expected some type of action against him but he thought 6 months was still too long and i agree
---
Where I said I want Khadgar for free? Stop twisting and adding to my words. I'd gladly pay for him back in the day (and support a charity as a positive side-effect), but simply weren't given a chance. Tyrande was much easier to obtain - and in fact I own her for years.
---
So yeah, I don't give a shit about Tyrande. But raising concern about much more elusive item is not really complaining.
---
Uh oh.
---
&gt; Possessed Lackey
---
That‚Äôs a funny way to spell Voidcaller. Lackey became garbage post-nerf.
---
The playerbase cant handle a strong control deck. Look at the warrior treatment, 55% winrate was too much. So they cried for nerfs until control was sub 50% and agro/combo could run the game again.
---
IMO, high attack tends to be better in Rogue than high health as the class has great way to remove opponent's board from hand and gain tempo so that minions on board can connect face, especially doing it early on, as when the game goes longer Rogue becomes less advantageous.
---
Yep. I tricked a lot of people, though. :)
---
In WoW perhaps. Hearthstone stopped following WoW lore with the grand tournament, some even consider goblins vs gnomes as when this happened. Hearthstone is a game world within a game world, all on several different boards
---
sorry i have a life outside of an online card game you lowlife waste of air
---
I agree with you on zhat, but 1-2 extra attack matters way less on/after turn 5.
---
This this and this, great post.
---
If anyone knows a proper fair for this please let me know
---
Because HS is much more popular than HotS, and HotS is kinda dead.
---
There is no party anyway. Autobattlers will never be a quarter as popular as mobas.
---
That's cool for quest rogue, but the new hero card seems better.
---
For now the classes that recived the best cards are rogue and paladin though
---
Try telling that to the saviours of uldum song
---
That sounds terrible
---
That makes no sense.
---
Ewwww ew ew eww
---
thanks for making this a screenshot so I can't view the linked vid
---
It's not because there's no good control decks, it's that no deck can handle 3 4 mana minions and an 8 mana minion on turn 4
---
Sherazin was played in some iteration of Miracle Rogue and was decent (pretty good against the likes of Control Warrior, not bad against Midrangy-ish decks, only weak to Aggro).
---
Bloodreaver Guldan would like to know your location.
---
Imagine if someone insulted the US or an european country on their stream, they would have publicly apologised to that country aswell.
---
I can see that from the perspective of any reasonable person, the HK protest is justified and supporting it is not a direct insult to China, I'm sure a lot of ppl at Blizzard, including those that made the decisions regarding Blitzchung's punishment, see it that way, but the important thing here is if China sees it that way.
---
Now you are saying Blizzard had to decide between maintaining their relationship with China or maintaining their relationship in the west, and they chose China. This is the part that I don't think is fair, because Blitzchung's actions alone put them in this situation, so I don't think Blizzard should have to chose between these two. What mistake did they do to deserve this dilemma other than giving Blitzchung a microphone?
---
Instead, enforcing the rule that is designed to keep them out of political controversies, punishing the person that broke it and trying to maintain the relationship with the country which got potentially damaged by the whole thing just seems like the logical thing to do.
---

I'm so confused why it feels like alot of people wanted the protests to fail

---
Isn't Galakrond the same legendary that changes depending what class you are?

Tess will recast all non-shaman cards so if you cast academic espionage be4 you can go infinite with this. But yeah this hero cards can change your class. I won lots of matches vs rogue due to Lotus Agent giving me druid or warrior dks

---
Zeph means you're dead but if siamat hits you for 12 even without zeph, you are not looking great vs hunter either. Focus should be on maintaining life total here as you will outvalue hunter eventually with your hand. Using the surgers to kill the rat also leaves no visible outs of killing the siamat next turn so you are banking on drawing something from nourish that will save you or you just lose because siamat hits you for 24 dmg over 2 turns.
---
&gt; There's no way they upgrade literally every spell forever for this card.
---
While it is most likely limited it wouldn't be that hard to make it work on very spell. You would just need a few cases. 
---
1. If a spell can be improved by spell damage give it spell damage +2.
---
2. If the spell draws cards increase the amount by 2.
---
3. Otherwise decrease the manacost by 3.

The next rotation will happen when the first set of 2020 is released around April.  The three oldest sets (Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan) will go to Wild at that time.
---
At some point every class is going have the own version explosive shot and also be better.
---
So... just like the hearthstone team? Think this confirms it.

Well, Vargoth became disenchantable after the set itself came out, so...

---
I don't believe a single person learned about HK through fucking Hearthstone. The issue was already mainstream for WEEKS and we were all talking about it.
---
My theory is this: They let streamers play this earlier to hype up people to pre-order or purchase the content later. Stuff like adventures, that cost 700 gold (which is very expensive for f2p) are always available for content creators. Their goal is to show all the cool things so that people buy into it, and eventually decide to purchase said content, in fear of missing out.
---
And yeah, opinions of streamers heavily influence the meta, as in "here's 3 decks that will win you games, now observe how the ladder consists of these 3 decks, and later they'll change a bit but still, 3 decks". I avoid this content to not be driven by a widespread, rushed opinion of the card reveal/early access. I've done that before, and it didn't turn out so well... It gets boring really quickly. People watch and see everything, but when they start playing, it's not that hyped anymore and then they get mad. I did it this year, and voil√†! So much deck building freedom! There's noone beating the overbeat deadhorses of "this card is autoinclude", "must have 'package'" GOD  hate this whole *package* thing. Deck building is really limited when everyone is buzzing about 5 good cards, that are inevitably in every deck, and nothing new really gets into competitive play, or ladder. If blotsard allows all players to play on even grounds, something more like fireside but for all us peeps, it would positively influence the expansion release experience.
---
Good. 
---
Decreased power levels are boring af. 2019 no longer has the boogeymen Ungoro/KFT/K&amp;C expansions yet the popularity of the game continues it's large decline as evident with decreased Twitch viewership, new lows in contributions to Vicious Syndicate meta reports, and multiple quarterly reports that state the game has had a decline in revenue/active users. I'd rather they print powerful cards that make me want to play with a set than trash like Glitter Moth, Lady in White, Zerek Master Cloner, etc.
---
I'm not talking about playing it on any other mana cost than 4. That's what the reply 2 up from me was talking about. If you play it on turn FOUR, you use all your mana, set the opponent to 10, you basically used all of your mana (which is now 10) to play an 8/8.
---
*Shields up, red alert.*
---
But they aren‚Äôt letting people express themselves. They blocked chat on the live streams. They took away mics and cameras on tournaments. Their actions are literally the exact opposite of their words.
---
My God that's such a dumb way of looking at it.
---
RR had varied power level between classes, but it had some VERY strong cards.Zuljin, master's call, Shirvallah, Mass hysteria, etc.
---
Is this a bot account?
---
Yeah, I actually agreed with a lot of the point until they basically tried to implicitly create some kind of equivalency between the HK stuff and... giving streamers early access to content??? What??????
---
Come on! First people whine they did not say SORRY explicitly and once they actually say it people start to come up with another reason to be angry at Blizzard's words. Just admit you won't be satisfied until they retire and fund an army to fight for HuMaN RiGhTs. Gosh it is tiring to read such a delusional take on things.
---
He's not some low level fall guy they randomly singled out a la Hunger Games. He's the president of the company. Everything the company does links back to him.
---
They hears our issues on mobile and will fix it in a couple of weeks.
---
How is that a dumb way of looking at it?
---
You‚Äôre speaking from your perspective ... I‚Äôm not good at deck building and don‚Äôt enjoy it. I like having a base that I can modify. I‚Äôm sure there are others that just want to get good at decks that are ready for ladder.
---
I know, hence him not really having a real choice
---
Sure Toast is popular and all that, but I never saw the appeal.  I will choose to play the game myself and make up my own mind.
---
That would make it the best card in the history of Hearthstone.
---
The powercreep is real,glad blizzard isn't holding back after people weren't satisfied by last year expansions though.
---
Honestly you might just not enjoy hearthstone as much as you think you do anymore. Personally I think long drawn out matches where the winner is determined by incremental value are the MOST fun part of hearthstone
---
They kept saying murloc pally would be number 1 so i crafted a bunch of trash to make the deck. Hands down the least fun deck I‚Äôve ever played and it sucked too. Burned all my dust to try and participate in what streamers thought the meta would be and lost out on having some good ol experimental fun.
---
Benign compared to "draw a card &amp; it costs 0" or "destroy a random enemy minion" as hero powers
---
Underlords is really a wreck performancewise, also hearthstones approach in the Autobattle genre seems to be more focused on having actual fun
---
Since the beginning of the outrage, there were comments complaining that the protest had no real teeth to it and everyone would forget about it before Blizzcon.
---
Now Blizzcon is here and you're... complaining that the protest hasn't moved on yet?
---
Seems to contradict the assumption that it's just a protest bandwagon.
---
Are you new to Hearthstone? Cause in the last at least 4 years there was never a time where people really test decks and all. 
---
People theorycrafted good decks before launch and most of the time they were right with it and a deck was as strong as expected and started to dominate the meta until someone build a counter up to the point where 4 weeks later we found the *one* deck that stands above all others and pollutes the ladder til the next expansion
---
Because had you not played Nozdormu you'd have only 4 Mana to spend.
---
So you spent 4 Mana.
---
Precedent: LGBT Flag
---
You play this and then you have extra 10 mana to use?
---
People who like Autochess games will see that Hearthstone has one now and may try it out, so in the long run it's a way to boost their player base and potential to make money off of those new or returning players.
---
Lol yea my bad!
---
Positioning matters in **subtle** ways.  Like many of the decisions made in HS.  This is what distinguishes the best players in the world and ones that are simply good.  And something that your typical HS player doesn't comprehend.
---
I agree with this. I love seeing new cards and concepts. But I don't want to see all the new decks that I wanted to try myself.
---
Stormbringer?
---
Typical Malygos plus Sinister/Evis. It‚Äôs not a new concept.
---
You can control it by making it clear what you're talking about, not by  avoiding mentioning what you are apologizing for.  He was so careful not to mention Blitzchung or Hong Kong in his "apology" that it really begs the question "Was his apology written specifically so it can be rewritten in China?".
---

---
Or don't watch streamers play the expansion early?
---
Have an event where pros/streamers build decks for eachother and then have to compete. It'll be fun to see a bizarro anti-meta while still showcasing new cards.
---
Have select streamers play with premade decks. Have special competitive tavern brawls that are deck building challenges but don't relate to the normal meta. Give them early access to arena. So many choices.
---
&gt;add something that‚Äôs actually involved with being a card game.
---
Like a tournament mode? PogChamp
---
But even an achievement system would be a start...like...hey...why not reward ppl for actually playing the game? C R A Z Y idea
---
Does the hero power upgrade as Galakrond does?
---
Nice!
---
The comment I originally replied to at first thought that Invoke triggered the Galakrond Battlecry rather than the Galakrond HP; they've since edited their comment.
---
Welcome to the internet wonderland
---
Yeah but you have to include a bunch of trash tier cards in your deck to upgrade it.
---
Think of it like Heal Paladin. Start by sacrificing tempo to gain value. Then leverage value to win via a big bomb/big plays/value. But actually you died before the second step. RIP.
---
The Malygos card makes the pun "Malygeese" in the description. That counts.
---
So is this a 4 Mana 8/8 that gives your opponent initiative with the 10 Mana Crystals? Or is a 0 Mana 8/8 that you can't play until turn 4 that gives you initiative with the 10 Mana Crystals? 
---
Also lmao Paladin has better ramp than Druid. 
---
Okay I did research and learned that it's a 4 Mana 8/8 that gives you opponent initiative. Still good, but if you're fighting someone who can answer the 8/8 and develop something on the board then you're just behind. The mirror of this deck is gonna be clown town. I'm glad that Call to Adventure tutors this so you always get it by turn 4 if you mulligan for it. Much more consistent than Astral Communion.
---
Top tier shit amirite
---
I did specifically ask them for clarification about their position in my original response, but as you merely jumped into the conversation on their behalf and are unable to answer questions about their intent, we have to rely on speculation. I interpreted "everything I could" as "everything I could", and that includes (for example) not watching matches because of who is playing in them, which (in a small way) negatively impacts Blizzard, whether that's specifically intended to hurt Blizzard or not.  
---
 
---
Speaking of "take the most extreme interpretation of someones statements to make it easier to argue against":  I don't know what neoliberal ghouls you usually hang out with, but to me it's outright ludicrous that you'd interpret me saying profit-maximizing corporate censorship is inevitable under capitalism as not critical of the system.
---
Good to know they felt the need to open their biggest promotional event of the year with an apology for pretty much no reason.
---
I really should watch it one of these days.
---
Well, most descriptions of the cards are always puns. Also because its easier to make them there than in the card name.
---
Rafam is taking dalaran to try and resurrect Galakrond. That‚Äôs how it ties in
---
To me it seems like they know their time is up with hearthstone so they're making one last expac that's so blatantly powercreep that the few ppl playing shell out for it and then it's over
---
That explains the 8/8 stats on a 4 mana minion, it's the upside to essentially letting your opponent play big next turn
---
Do you know what shitposts are or what?
---
This doesn't even remotely achieve the desired affect of preventing the metagame from being discovered. The players who want to be competitive are already theory crafting and gold fishing lists, literally the first day we have spoilers. The streamers are not even necessarily the people making the good lists; they're just the ones you hear about the good lists from. The sheer number of strong players brewing lists for this game means that the best possible lists will always be discovered within the first week, if not the first few hours, of the expansion being dropped. It's the nature of the playerbase of hundreds of thousands of people globally to push the card pool to the limits - it has nothing to do with the streamers specifically. Marketing promotions like the one you're describing are the life blood of many of those streamers and they should absolutely not be held accountable for the inevitability of the metagame being solved. That is how popular competitive card games work now. Hate the game, not the players
---
So like the old cigarette company rewards programs basically
---
Druids were better able to build their decks around Biology project and that card fell flat.  Also, this card is a legendary so it won't be as consistent as a build-around card.  The one thing it does have going for it is it can still be a 4-mana 8/8 on Turn 10 which is much better than Biology Project just being another innervate.
---
Hallow's end is over. You can't complete that Quest anymore
---
Oh please. If I wanted to go there to protest I would just wear a shirt saying how I feel about shit. I would not be planning to do some indoors demonstration. That would only backfire. I might not agree with how Blizzard has been handling things but I am not going to  destroy the experience of others going there just to make a point.
---
I think a lot of people going to Blizzcon feel the same and are taking the passive aggressive route.
---
Not really possible to make an accurate judgement, there are a bunch of unrevealed cards still left.
---
There have been plenty of times where cards seem OP during release but turn out to have insufficient support, very bad matchups in the new meta or were just misjudged.
---
Agree this is kobold and catacombs power level probably like 10 cards getting nerfed by next year but honestly we need power sets we saw what witchwood and other expansions did bringing us weak cards
---
Deja Vu.
---
[There are dozens of us!](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/E7lJhhdwewLfa6a4pIWSxRORUm04hoxHSHvskeZmekE/https/www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dozens_of_us_arrested_development.gif)
---
They could have protested outside and not given Blizzard money. Surely, taking a few days out of their lives to fly out and protest outside of the event venue to have their voices heard is no problem for those committed to the cause.
---
You aren't the op, so no I have nothing against you. I don't know you from adam.
---
Also no, I'm not a streamer
---
&gt;Do you tell at kids trick or treating for UNICEF that the 3 dollars they raise for hungry people doesn't matter and that they shouldn't bother?
---
No because unlike standing outside a video game company that actually does something.
---
&gt;I accused you of being a dick shitting on people for not doing enough while you do nothing.
---
&gt;You responded by saying
---
&gt;"Lul fucking sheep barely did anything fucking losers"
---
&gt;That's and interesting way to admit that you're a dick and I was 
---
right but at least we got to the right place.
---
You should try reading what i actually write. I understand that the real world hurt your feelings and that you actually think that sitting on reddit upvoting blizzard bayd posts is doing something. But by all means say i'm a dick and i'm the problem. 
---
And holy shit i love how the only thing you have left is resorting to personal insults. You people and your mental gymnastics is something else. You people do anything to protect your fragile ego, because you can't handle knowing that you are wrong.
---
Early access is bullshit. Because of bullshits like this I don't even care about new releases anymore. Pre-release every "streamer's" channel is just thrash, so I don't even watch them, no matter what they upload. Artificial games against non-meta "friends" is just boring bullshit.
---
1) it‚Äôs the opposite: extremism cause incivility. What causes it? Many things but that‚Äôs not the issue. We shouldn‚Äôt feed into incivility. We shouldn‚Äôt strawman people either now should we? Which is why I replied to your comment.
---
2) touching on the fact of what people think: We all have personal biases that make us think we are not evil or not as bad for the actions we take. For instance, a cop that has pulled the trigger is exponentially more likely to pull it again. Extremists are no different and are further entrenched than most. Saying one has caused the other is very 1 sided. Both have caused the other to an extent. 
---
P.S) we all have very many biases in our system for good reasons. Based on what you are saying I can see where you lie in the political scale. Can you tell where I am? I‚Äôll give you a hint, I‚Äôm a psych major.
---
Man that is so rough to watch. Winner got sent to the semi finals for added insult to injury.
---
The poor guy looks like he just wants earth to swallow him whole...
---
0-7 GrandMaster losing lethal two times.  I am surprised!
---
wow brutal. 2nd time in the past couple months. really shows you how the pressure adds up on the biggest stages. Sometimes we dont realize.
---
Hi surprised!, I'm dad.
---
Nope.
---
He invented Hearthstone
---
Did you take into account the Mulligan ?
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt... let me check that
---
EDIT: If you‚Äôre on the play you have an 8.2% chance to miss all these cards by turn 5.
---
If you‚Äôre on the play that goes down to 4.3% chance to miss them.
---
That‚Äôs why every time I play, I go way past lethal just to do the most damage
---
Its a good board clear, but priest already has a lot of board clears right now. Its still a great card, but its not on the same level as rexxar
---
Can I hear a lot of bleeping out bad language on the stream? Is Feno losing it haha
---
2019 still no option to make trash animations instant.
---
Steamwhedel sniper should (the 2 2/3 from gvg) not this one.
---
I mean Rexxar literally singlehandedly made a class playable in Standard. It's arguably one of the strongest cards ever printed, if not THE strongest.
---
you run minions in your deck though. if you're using academic espionage it could pull something meaty.
---
Ski*doosh*
---
Or, a turn 10 4 mana 8/8. It had other uses than playing it in turn
---
Total stats are not all you look at when evaluating power level.
---
When you‚Äôre literally just talking about total stats, then yea, you just look at total stats and yes, 5/11/1 is overstatted by the games precedents.
---
big oof.
---
It should be underneath your hero portrait when you've selected a deck to play ranked
---
The fact that ANYONE AT ALL thought this was going to set you to 10/10 right as you play it is a downright embarassment.  How bad at card evaluation do you have to be to think they are making an unconditional 0 mana 8/8 that changes the game forever in your favor?
---
Honestly the missles seems like the only bad one imo
---
Bloodyface's facial expression roller coaster when he went from going to stand up in defeat to realising he won is priceless.
---
I think they do this strategically. Starting with a weak expansion and making stronger expansions towards the end of the year dials down the power level on the new rotation and also gives players a reason to spend money on cards that won‚Äôt be in standard as long.
---
&gt;Remember, they called basic human rights a divisive issue
---
They literally did not do this.
---
Malygos's Tome what the Hell.
---
He just got Cabalist's Tome at Griftah's for a discount, holy shit that's good.
---
Wrong use of the meme
---
KEKW
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes when I saw this happen
---
&gt;It's obvious what I meant
---
Or you could say what you mean?  Just a thought.  It's not my duty to assume you aren't capable of expressing yourself accurately and interpreting your words to mean anything besides what you say.  That would kind of defeat the purpose of communication, if I just assumed nothing you said was what you *actually* meant and started to interpret it for myself.  That just opens up an ugly can of worms of misinterpretation.  Maybe one person could interpret it the way you meant, maybe I would interpret it as "I eat shit for fun".  To avoid such issues, it's usually best to just say what you mean, no?
---
There were so many lethals missed. Obviously the extra arms, but also using neferset ritualist to heal the blademaster before divine spirit. Even using the divine spirit and inner fire on either of the 7/9 minions would have also been exact lethal (18 + 7 + 4 = 29). Almost every other play has a lethal. Feels bad for Feno, I was rooting for him to take it all.
---
Lol, can‚Äôt believe he did it again...
---
I'm not digging the artwork.  
---
Get it? 'Digging' because Sir Finley... In the desert...? Never mind.
---
Blizzard unmasked
---
 Request sent.  darksurtur#1694
---
Ouch, gotta feel for the guy
---
HOW LONG CAN HOW LONG THIS CAN GO GO ON ON
---
Did you take into account Nozdormu himself? That raises it to a 5 card game plan.
---
He really needs to go back to school and do something else other than "eSports."
---
Like, he had the heal out ( although it would trigger more draw animations) and extra arms. Really feno? He cracks under pressure.
---
Never underestimate the power of zero cost cards.
---
Definitely abandoned to make Battlegrounds.
---
What crack are they smoking
---
For sure, they probably were only going to give 1 of the five away.... look at the photo,
---
Druids were also the dominant deck at the time, forcing all other decks to be greedier plus all the mirrors.  Playing Biology Project against a greedy deck is bad.  Playing it against aggro is pretty reasonable and leaves them with an unused mana crystal half the time.
---
This card hard loses to Quest Shaman, but it'd be good against something like Zeph Hunter.
---
The timegating sucks ass on the bundles...
---
TIL ^^^^^^/s
---
It‚Äôs the last expansion of the year. It‚Äôs gonna rotate at the start of 2021, ergo, it‚Äôll be the expansion we have the second least amount of time playing with. I think they‚Äôre putting busted cards in because they‚Äôre not going to last as long in standard.
---
The g in malygos stand for gud
---
&gt;streamers create fake "meta" from day 1, and we like to play vs different decks and not the same deck.
---
Or Blizzard could just balance the game so that more than a handful of decks are actually viable.
---
What if instead they live stream police brutality in Hong Kong since that's what some of your money is going towards
---
The fact that you say this card is nuts *even* on Turn 8/9/10 makes me think you believe the symmetrical mana ramp is actually an advantage.  If played on Turn 4 you are granting your opponent an extra 6 mana worth of tempo which is worth way more than 8/8 in stats.  Giving an aggro deck a 6-mana tempo advantage on Turn 5 is usually suicide, regardless of the 8/8 on board.  Against control decks there will usually be an answer so it's a decent tempo play, but nothing more than that and they can utilize the mana nicely as well.  If anything, I would say this card is *ONLY* good on turns 8/9/10.  
---
As for Biology project, that card is at worst an Innervate, which is a card that sees play anyways (while Biology Project does not) so you can't pretend it does nothing.
---
Evolve, resurrection, pull from hand, pull from deck, randomly summoned, cloned, etc.. it's way more common than you think.
---
There's TONS of pics on the bliz subreddit about all the protests? Are u blind or just choosing to ignore them?
---
An aggro deck can only dump their hand into your 10 mana worth of board clears. A control/combo deck isn't going to utilise 10 mana on turn 4 any more than you can. This is only a downside vs tempo/midrange.
---
It's no auto-include, but I wouldn't say it's unplayable.
---
No, not really - what deck is this, that has a very low curve, no good refill, and no way to pressure you with 10 mana on the backswing that can't just ignore your 8/8?
---
It's certainly not Priest, and it's certainly not Rogue, the two fastest decks out there. Priest can do disgusting things with that much mana and Rogue can very quickly pressure you down from hand. There aren't any decks out there that really just play off the top without any kind of value.
---
What happens if you play this card in the mirror? You just lose. That's a great indication of how risky this card is.
---
And remember, this is some kind of Big Paladin deck. Your first turns have likely been pass, pass, Call to Adventure. Vs. a lot of the fast decks (where you're theorizing this card is good), you could very easily be virtually dead with that kind of curve. What happens when you're under so much pressure that playing this card opens up a bunch of lethals for your opponent? That's very real with the shape of current aggro decks. And that's *just* aggro decks. Versus Quest Druid, Quest Shaman, Highlander Mage, Highlander Hunter, this card loses you the game by itself. They can use the mana as well as you can, and you give it to them first. It's the Duskfallen Aviana problem.
---
This card is a guarantee to lose tempo for the rest of the game and  gambles that you can outvalue them. That is not a card I want to build my deck around unless I have a virtual guarantee that my opponents have nothing scary. And if my opponents have nothing scary, then they are doing something wrong or I am already winning.
---
Actually those dragons seem awesome.
---
malyüÖ±Ô∏èos
---
Ermahgod, why are you against blizz? they giving us 6 free legendaries, who cares about china
---
Dude this game is aimed at 6-12 year olds. Be glad there‚Äòs text at all
---
Probably not, especially without any other pre-order bonuses. It seems lately (like the last 4 expansions) there have been later promo's that come along that offer better value. Most recently the 20 packs and a legendary. With no other benefit, $1 a pack and 1 week earlier of content is probably not worth it.
---
Facts. These Blizzcuks are so delusional.
---
You're forgetting this is paladin instead of druid which already has insane board clears like Equality and Duel. This card is insane against aggro if they just dump their hand into a board clear or into a Tirion on turn 5. And lets stop pretending that an 8/8 can't deal with threats as well. 
---
The nice thing about this card is that you don't NEED to play it in bad situations. It's a great card from turns 4-10 to full out your curve whenever you need it that has a bonus of coming with Dragon Synergy.
---
The d in malygos stands for democracy
---
I think i would have preferred a manac reduction to a damage boost on flamestrike. I'd rather be able to follow it up.
---
20 ppl "protesting" while they prepared 4000 shirts... It was fun to watch their livestream yesterday for a while how all ppl around them ignored them.
---
Another board clear for Warrior
---
Seriously, this is exactly why I don‚Äôt bother about anything these companies do. It‚Äôs always bad. So I just stopped giving a shit and just enjoy ma game
---
Cant wait to duel it out into concede
---
Wtf Mogu and Ahmet? 
---
I think we can safely dismiss whatever this guy says.
---
Mean Streets of Gadgetzan
---
This is something I've wondered for years now.  Why blizz only gives Mages meh cards, even as we rarely ever break tier one.
---
Honestly battlegrounds looks more interesting than if they would've copied auto chess. Not sure it looks good, but I'd rather a different take on the genre considering we have auto chess, underlords, and TFT running around right now.
---
Who actually posted that though?  Was it Blizzard or a Chinese version of them that US Blizzard can't really do anything about?  
---
Almost like 2 different companies sort of like how there is 2 different HS games.
---
The 2 drop is bad. Not good on turn 2, not good on turn 4, not really good on turn 10. When is it good?
---
I can see this dragon creating an archetype of a Myra shenanigans, also thing necro blade and elekk
---
&gt;I understand the point of marketing
---
No, you don't.
---
&gt;this approach is the worst one because it hurts a lot of players
---
It doesn't 'hurt' anyone, are you serious? LMAO.
---
That's great! Thanks so much.
---
It also is nowhere near the power level needed to be played in this exp. this card could potentially see play
---
So I can watch them on youtube.
---
Ye i have thought of that and i was wondering what would happen if i barnes into kelthuzad alone.. so i guess i wont make him.. but he looks so cool though. Anyways ye i might add some entombs.
---
Thanks for the fast reply
---
Have you literally ever needed to play consecration when you have the comfort of being able to play a five mana vanilla minion beforehand? And that's even assuming you have paladin's synergies with it.
---
Malygos' explosion sucks.
---
why does paladin have mana ramp? this card makes no sense
---
Just make the battlecry a non-persistent / non-doubling effect like board clear, heal to full, or "evolve into legendaries". All 3 fit the theme of shaman. This way, control shamans, aggro and overload shamans can still run it without any downside. 
---
If you willing to ignore "class themes", then a 'recruit' mechanic would work as well since that means battlecries don't trigger. Shamans will then have to decide on board  presence or battlecries.
---
He's probably fooled himself into thinking he doesn't like it.
---
Holy shit lol you‚Äôre right I just assumed it was. This card is disgustingly good... Between this and the wild growth + draw 1 dragon Druid is looking really nasty.
---
Just wait 1 more month...
---
Worst case (as in regular loot) from 100 packs:
---
A whole bunch of dublicated common cards, ~100 rares (lots of dublicates), ~5-10 epics (probably with unusable dublicates), ~4-6 legendaries.
---
It's shit no matter how you look at it. That's why I stopped to preorder the expansions, it's always a letdown.
---
It's too much random card generation for me. Takes the strategy out of a lot of games simply because myself or my opponent discovers or gets the perfect random card.
---
Feels meh when you get lucky, feels horrible when the opponent gets lucky, basically.
---
Yea your perspective isn't really valid. You claim to hate a core aspect of the game, and frankly that's probably a lie.
---
Most definitely, they take advantage of their situation to the fullest. But, with this post I wanted to kind of state two things 
---
1: I don't buy 50$/80$ bundles. (Or bundles like Hex/Flex)
---
2: I would buy a cheaper bundle w/ a portrait and negligible amount of cards for 20$ or 10$ from the **Hero Portrait** section of the store.
---
I know the devs lurk the sub, maybe the right person would see this discussion and pass this information along somewhere at Blizz in some capacity. Just hoping for the best here.
---
Wait these free legendaries are disenchantable right?
---
No it doesn't. Please shut up about tournament mode. I'm happy we have it but it makes 0 difference in terms of content.
---
Or just anything in general
---
&gt;Then all highlander cards and all tribal cards stop creativity, along with "spells matter" cards like sorcerer aprentice or stuff like spitefull summoner. And we all know thats not true.
---
As a matter of fact there are very limited choises considering tribal and highlander decks. Still they dont seem too bad. Whats bad is giving conditional ramping to the ramping class that has no other ramp tools for a year.
---
  ''So it actually promotes a ramp, big stuff druid compared to "I ramp to 10 in 5 turns and OTK you" that would happen without the conditional ramp. ''
---
Agreed on that but this isnt WG s fault but in fact its the newer cards fault. When you decide to combine ramp with huge draws and huge stall mechanics you get disgusting combo decks. Still ramp has nothing to do with this.
---
This is the most logical reasoning I have seen so far.  Druid is defo spoiled for choices.  
---
Will have to see next expansion what else comes in to replace the outgoing cards and how much support a dragon deck gets.
---
Also less people could be because it bloats the game and diverts the player base. 
---
Why can't you guy's ask for a mode that's actually fun? Like a sandbox mode?
---
Seems like a bigger Millhouse.
---
Yea I'm sure toast would have stuck around if we had tournament mode /s
---
This is something not many people are pointing out yet. This is not like dusk breaker where you want 6 or so dragons to make it highly likely to be active.
---
You‚Äôre gonna want a high density of dragons if you want this card active on 2. With no dragons this is a worse novice engineer.
---
The other thing is non dragon decks never play this. I think this card is kinda like glow stone technician. It‚Äôs a very powerful card in an archetype that will suck.
---
Isn't that how Hearthstone started though? A more casual card game for people who never got into Magic?
---
Impressive
---
I know, but calling this ridiculous because it'll eventually deal 12 damage is missing the point
---
I'd argue that if you have to look up a keyword every time, that's a player problem.
---
Echo was flavourful to the expansion featuring Hagatha, but when they revisited it in Rise of Shadows, they broke that flavour by not revisiting Echo.
---
This form of inspire can be easily 'flavourfied' as the hero leading the charge against Galakrond and EVIL, signalling Dragonbane to fire, signalling Toxic Reinforcements etc.
---
Because the way they did it received a fair amount of backlash. And it would be incredibly easy to just use whizbang builds instead...
---
Literally doesn't effect their bottom line at all.
---
What fucking hipocrocy they have 0 values they diddent boycott blizzard to do anything they did it for attention
---
Not class legendaries, though. Those are pretty generally quite good.
---
Casual players have Google too.
---
He carefully picked that red shirt, he wanted to continue the tradition...
---
He failed miserably.
---
Yeah, absolutely that's possible. Which would be ironic, because the Taiwanese casters were also attempting to get the protest over with as quickly as possible and then move on.
---
Clicked video and expected the rope to be burning and damn just call me ms cleo!
---
Maybe play faster.

"fight for" is hardly what I would call that... That guy wasn't fighting for anything but attention. The only people who are "fighting" for hong kong are those in hong kong getting tear gassed or those actually inconveniencing their lives to support a revolution by donating money or petitioning their representatives.
---
I think C‚Äôthun was also an extra legendary compared to their regular number. 
---
Either way, more cards is better.
---
I mean, rigged how? You think they made the cards arrive in a certain order or something?
---
Team 5 can't figure out how to give us a tournament mode but you think they've implemented a secret tournament rigging mode and none of the developers have spoken out about it?
---
Luckily you don't have to discuss it with me, the proof is up there in the OP.
---
There's a fine line between being lazy and thriftless.
---
I don't know if this guy is a troll but looking at OPs history, I'm at a loss for words.
---
Just here to see the great comments coming from this great sub.
---
&gt;have absolutely nothing to do with Chine's human rights violations.
---
You would be right until they uncharacteristically and harshly came down on a player for voicing his support and then released a tweet saying they would defend china's reputation at any cost or whatever the exact wording was.
---
They got reprimanded by our government for censoring dissent for crying out loud, to say they have no hand in the political controversy at this point is disingenuous.
---
[NA] Have quest. Add me. TheAcer#1931

You must go first. I'll show.

What were they supposed to to? They're contractually obligated to move the stream along according to the wishes of production. And production (evidently, since they didn't cut away) wanted to go on with the interview and presumably did not tell the casters to stop Blitz. Meaning not allowing him to say it (somehow...) would also be in breach of contract.
---
The only other option would've been to walk out, an obvious breach of contract.
---
So, in fact, this option was the one that was least likely to be a breach of contract, since they went along with productions wishes, and the only clause this could violate was the incredibly ambiguous clause that could apply to anything they do anyway.
---
Ooh that would be interesting. Dragon slayer is gonna be the new eater of secrets
---
"I don't like something so no one should get to do it." Okay then.
---
Yes and what I was saying is that negative of running Barnes and Y'shaarj in Spell Hunter was balanced by the high reward of high rolling in the early game, this isn't the case with running duplicates in Reno decks, there is no insane reward where running a duplicate can out value the singleton cards. The situations are different.
---
Maybe wait for a year of the dragon bundle next year (this years sets with a big discount)
---
Imagine the dragon priest arena meta if this expansion, MSG, Grand Tournament, and K&amp;C are in rotation together.
---
I played it several times at blizzcon and it‚Äôs incredibly fun. Will it last and have replay value when I have access to it every day? Who knows. But if it gets enough traction I really think it has potential to be a solid addition to hearthstone, has a ton of room for fun improvements and changes, and will be a great break from the monotony of the game modes we have access to already.
---
People aren't complaining that the positioning doesn't matter. There is some level of strategy to battlegrounds in a lot of ways. The problem is that the difference between top tier positioning skills and "lmao I guess I'll put my taunt on the right side" isn't all that big.
---
It looked like it with the perfect draws but we also had something similar with tom and Pavel's god rng, It certainly takes away from their achievement for people to have those claims but at least they have a girl in the champions hall, congrats to her
---
If this indeed was rigged posts like yours are exactly what China and Blizzard would want. Your moaning about feminism and a sjw boogie man are the perfect defense against cheating accusations. If it really was rigged having a woman be the Chinese player who won is perfect, it gets people like you outing yourself as bigots and reasonable people having to defend her.
---
Yes indeed
---
Yes they were hired to broadcast an event and do it alongside Blizzard's core values:  
---
* Gameplay first.
---
* Commit to quality.
---
* Play nice; play fair.
---
* Embrace your inner geek.
---
* Every voice matters.
---
* Think globally.
---
* Lead responsibly.
---
* Learn and grow.
---
If they would have silenced Blitzchung, then they would have been in breech of at least one of those...

That last game was almostly flawlessly played from her I felt. Well earned.
---
Calling this the new keleseth is quite the prediction lol. Guess we‚Äôll see which one of us is right in December.
---
The emotion she displayed after winning was very touching. Great humility and appreciation.
---
cant wait for her future lion based card next year
---
A protest they encouraged yes. And its far different when you're being directed to engage a protester and when you're encouraging a protest. C'mon surely the distinction isn't lost to you or are you just willfully ignoring details to strengthen your point? I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt...
---
Twitch chat claims everything is rigged all the time.
---
It‚Äôs Twitch chat.
---
I think WoTOG just had more cards than usual in general.
---
No because OP's point is not that the meta is solved - read it again - it is that an ***artificial*** meta forms where specific decks, whether tier 1 or not, heavily saturate the pool of decks immediately at release because the dust has already settled (even if it has settled sub-optimally). There is no phase of chaotic decks all over the place with this marketing strategy - it goes straight to a 'meta', whether optimal or *artificial*.
---
No spoilers for 24 hours
---
Honestly just leave it. Twich chat has and will always be one of the most toxic places ever. I was shocked at first too honestly.
---
Then what would have been the right action to stay neutral? Every punishment for his pro-hk statement is apprently pro-chinese, no punishment would be basically approving his statement and therefore piss off china.
---
I don‚Äôt care enough to keep this going.
---
A new player can't do that if they've closed the app out of frustration.
---
people at reddit are cynics who truly believe they know more than devs who worked on hearthstone for 5 years and, before that, on magic for almost a decade
---
look at mark rosewater's commments on the errors from the time spiral block and how mu h it hurt magic's approachability
---
Gamers are the worst
---
Just seeing her matches made me so happy. Confident and outplayed her competitors. An amazing time
---
It's VKLiooon
---
But why would you want to use Google... when maybe, the game could tell you?
---
That's Twitch chat for you. But obviously they were on their worst behaviour because: she's a woman; she's Chinese.
---
Congratulations! Very well deserved victory!
---
look at how mobile hearthstone (the most popular platform for the game) deal with too many tooltips (zilliax, for example), that's far from an elegant solution
---
also, tooltips don't work if you are watching a stream
---
They are treated like people with a mass following that donates offering to them regularly, and get next to nothing in exchange, explain to me why blizzard shouldn't treat them like gods
---
She obviously played well but I think it does a disservice to her to keep emphasizing how she is the first female champion-it only further draws a line between her and her male counterparts. It's not as if the casters say first champion from X country-so why only make the distinction for gender also?
---
Tbh whoever says free Hong Kong doesn't know how world works
---
That game of Curvestone is not exactly the best example of her skill.
---
EDIT: For those downvoting, I‚Äôd like for you to explain how playing minions on curve and hitting face against a deck that basically passes the first five turns requires much skill. Any other game she played this entire tournament would be a much better example of her skill, which was admittedly quite impressive. It‚Äôs just that the final game in particular was a one-sided beatdown that any Rank 5 player would have won.
---
Don't blame the kid. I doubt he understands the whole situation. Be bloody furious at whoever convinced this kid to do it. Using a kid like this is terrible.
---
I rooted for her simply because she had the hardest run to qualify compared to everyone else who went through the stupid GM system which closed off a ton of hard working pros.
---
Ironically, the first year GM was closed off to an insulated group of celebrity players while China keeps their same meritocracy based system, a Chinese player wins.
---
Well, it was the first time they apologized for the "tough Hearthstone esports incident".  The response the week after it happened wasn't an apology.  And they didn't say they would do anything different in the future except in vague ways that they would do a better job of upholding their values.
---
Cool. Now let Blitzchung back in to GM. Only makes sense at this point if they're going to let people just blurt out Free HK during a QnA session. Whatever side you stand on the issue, at this point they might as well let him back in. If they feel he still needs some form of punishment, just make it a fine or something.

triggered by twitch chat KEKW
---
A simple mechanic that was never seen again for 4 years, keyword or not.
---
Delay's sound more beneficial than they are, in real time 2 minutes is not a lot of time to figure out and react.
---
Mask could be for various reasons, people may not have been in a similar experience and not expecting it.
---
Seamless transition to what? you know how many people probably have to sign off on that decision, it's not like it was something people knew 100% wasn't accepted like say if they saw nudity they would cut without orders. 
---
Again nothing would be any different if they did transition, Blitzchung would have still received punishment for attempting it, we'd still see the backlash after Blitzchung posted about how they cut his segment on it.
---
Think of it as a milestone for Hearthstone esports in general. And one that will hopefully bring more diversity to the scene.
---
everyone who screams ‚Äúrigged‚Äú in the chat and forums better crawl back into the cave they came from. Lion winning GM is absolutely incredible and really BIG for esports in general. i was about to make a post like you did because i am so fucking disgusted by the comments.
---
Incels doing their incel thing, don't pay them the attention they don't deserve. I'm glad she won, a truly heartwarming moment is HS history.
---
Also just saying the reason why people were saying its rigged is that she drew extremely well throughout the tournament-having zephrys in the early turns for what seemed to be every hunter game, Casie not drawing Hakkar, her florist landing double on Malygoys, topdecking Brann against Casie etc.
---
To be completely fair a gigantic chunk of the HS player base doesn't even really know what those things are nor would they care about them. The people who have played other more traditional CCGs and those who care enough to come to forums about the game would love those modes. The other portion of players are probably hyped as fuck to see battlegrounds. 
---
If you even know what pauper is then you are a minority in the larger HS player base.
