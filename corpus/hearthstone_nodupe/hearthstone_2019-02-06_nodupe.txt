Cho'Gall is a trip to play in HOTS. Since he requires to players, the game is four heroes versus five. Cho'Gall is a straight up raid boss.... if the two players can sync up well.

Don't dust anything unless you need the resources to craft a complete deck.

Another HoF Geen and Baku post? How exciting. 
---
The point isnt even it's power, the point is that odd-decks should be about weighing options and sacrificing something. Odd-warrior doesn't have to do that, which defeats the point of the deck.

YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SKIP YOUR HAKKAR VACCINATIONS!?
---
I know I might get stick for this, but my ideal hearthstone would look like pre-Midwinter or late pre-Homecoming Gwent beta. Or, really, something like HS any time from beta to BRM.
---
Not too expensive, fairly well balanced, good deck diversity, interesting deckbuilding, games actually being a constant duel for board factoring card advantage, tempo and value. All gwent decks had an upper value limit meaning that you didn't have super expensive decks and cheap options, but rather you were encouraged to diversify between a number of affordable, accessible options even as a F2P player. You could realistically make 5 or 6 decent decks fairly quickly and cheaply. Great ranked rewards. Separate currency for converting standard cards to premium. Customisation and personalisation options.
---
Not surprising, given that Gwent was essentially marketed to disillusioned HS players (and streamers). Honestly, if not for Homecoming, I'd be playing Gwent over HS right now.
---
I‚Äôm an avid league of legends player and Cho‚Äôgall is my favorite MOBA champ ever. 
---
Every time I played it, they always held their cursor over it
---
I mean, dragon warrior has a pretty decent win-rate at about 52%. If you're worried changing the mana costs would make the deck shit, then both the cards alongside changing their costs. I'm fine with that.
---
The funny thing is, many people use casual as a "safe" place to get their quests done, without any fear of tanking their current rank.
---
So as a result it's all hardcore meta decks piloted by people with expert precision.
---
You can‚Äôt deny the similarities
---
It's this really obscure country call the USA, you might not have heard of it.

Hakkar priest is one of my favorite decks to play right now. It doesn‚Äôt have a great win rate, but it is very satisfying to get to emote ‚ÄúDarkness will consume you‚Äù while watching the Corrupted Blood eat them alive. 
---
It's more that in a lot of cases it's gratuitous.
---
Like, Jaina as a character is focused on her studies and being a good mage, and saving the human race.  She's a bookish type, and sort of direct and good and generic-hero qualities.  A lot like Arthas before he turned, but more oriented toward intellect than valor.
---
Doesn't really make sense for that character personality to go out of her way to dress in sexy clothing; why would she, it's not like she's trying to get laid, and she doesn't seem at all focused on her appearance.  So it just seems like fan service.  Like people wanna see her titties, so the artists oblige.  In that sense, it detracts from the lore.
---
Like if Arthas walked around in a g-string to emphasize his throbbing erection, you'd be like "huh, that's kinda weird, don't see why Arthas would do that, seems impractical and out of character".  It would pull you out of the universe.
---
Granted, I haven't followed the lore since WC3, so maybe they've changed how Jaina acts since then.
---
Hey, congratulations, that's great!
---
Weather is cold af dude, she needs it 
---
I can share it, read the story :)

You can still see Jaina's cleavage, but it cost 1600 dust. 
---
Hearthstone is now officially P2B.
---
This is what kills me. They just refuse to look at the big 3 that basically turned  this genre into the powerhouse that it is today and make the same mistakes they did.
---
The class it exists in and the random nature of the card dictate otherwise.
---
Hopefully they censor Malurion and Garrosh nipples as well. Makes me uncomfortable. 
---
How can we get the hakkar one? 
---
If I cared about card backs I would be mad now. Did not get one even though I played against person who had it.
---
xD yeah DIE DIE DIE

The old bearded wizard from the 'Hearth and Home' short that was released a year or two back. He's also referred to when Blizzard releases guides for old Heroic encounters (I think it's called Malto's Tours or something like that), but otherwise isn't an in-game character (yet).
---
Fucking sjws reeeeee
---
can't get infected if you stopped playing months ago ü§î
---
I'm sure it is, it is a particularly noteworthy event in the history of the game so they probably are referencing it directly. It quite literally killed entire server's worth of players and reduced the in game cities to bone filled ghost towns for real-life days. They had to patch the way the curse works on player minions and then hard reset the servers to get things back to normal again.
---
Just followed you on twitter too :)
---
They used to call it the land of the free, I heard.
---
I love it when people make character judgments based on how they play a video game.  Especially when it's backed up by "See, isn't my way   so much cooler?"
---
Class act.
---
By the way, as for your directing your final statement at me, I don't give a shit about the back itself. I'll get it next time i boot up hearthstone in a couple months with the new expansion. I just hate people who can't stand other people having what they want in a video game they play for fun, of all things.
---
A handful of random people.
---
It‚Äôs also one card instead of a 2 card combo
---
And, like, why not revamp the whole hero art, of all classes, while we're at it?
---
Might be worth making glinda then
---
NA (have) trognostupid#11558
---
1. Not really true. It's be easier to balance than an entire new see every year. Replace this evergreen set with 50-75% reprints and you already know what to expect.
---
2. definitely wrong. This would possibly even lower the price if they rotate that 50-75% between old cards from old sets. A lot of people would already own a lot of these and the longer you play the more likely you'll have them.
---
3. See points 1 and 2. That argument already exists  for the rotation every 2 years.
---
:)
---
&gt;Rotating Classic Set: Neat idea, probably bad in practice. Do you think they're going to rotate a card like Ice Block and then bring it back? In your Heart of hearts, do you think a card the devs considered to be too powerful would see a return to standard? I severely doubt it. This creates a false sense of hope in the player base that specific cards will come and go when they won't. Would these shifts in Classic even make the game feel fresh in the long term? I have doubts there as well. MTG has had aggressive red burn decks forever. Their plan is always similar. Putting a new coat of paint on that strategy by making your lightning bolt a shock thanks to rotation (3 damage to 2 damage instead) doesn't make things feel new. It just makes it more or less powerful.
---
It's also worth noting that the core sets in MTG have to be rebought each rotation. They actually make the game more expensive and add a yearly set that's primarily composed of reprints of old cards. I feel like a lot of people are upset about the nerfs and jumping on the idea of a rotating core set for the Pros without considering the Cons.
---
Nice :)

My dusty golden Akali and Mojomaster will thank you for the play time you're about to give them
---
I am sick of this bullshit with people defending a multi-million dollar company. YES I AM complaining. I have been playing this game for 3 years, I have been playing video games my whole life, I can honestly say they do the least amount for their fans compared to other games. Epic games pumps out free content left and right, events to give free loot. They are fucking greedy. The second people hop off their nuts they will see how little they do for the fans...
---
I don't know if it matters or not but 2nd game on after the update I decided to use my Hakkar druid deck and well... I got matched against a guy with the cardback, probably just a coincidence tho.. GL all!
---
I picked it up in my first game. I'm curious if there was any logic behind who received it first. Maybe there are certain ladder ranks or whatever where it would be more prevalent. 
---

Does it still count even if they concede?

I basically quit HS because of OTK decks. I really love no counter play and everything leading up to combo being meaningless 
---
It's fifty or sixty gold and dust. That's not that much to freak out about.
---
How can you be a female hero, and not show cleavage?
---
Imo you can fix Barnes by bringing back pre nerf tink master. Maybe increase the cost/decrease the stats/both to balance it out but I think that‚Äôs the way to go 
---
That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not really destroying hero, contrary to the explosion from winning. You‚Äôre just winning. 
---
If I run 1 instead of 2, what do you swap the extra with?
---
Yep, I remember that fondly. 
---
The other guy did.  I didn't realize that would negate it.  :(
---
Weird how a 12 year old is handling this more maturely then the rest of blizzards audience
---
wtf are you talking about. Sex is not getting censored in our society at all. Over-sexualization of people in general, women in particular is what's getting more attention. Say what you want, but the gaming industry is full of petite half naked women with big cleavages. Nobody claims that a big cleavage is wrong. What people claim is that every single woman having a big cleavage for your delight is what is wrong because, guess what, women want to feel they mean more than a hot body to the world.
---
tl;dr: You guys are making strawmen when you argue that people want to ban sex.
---
An issue with having a "rotating core set" is that for standard players, pulling a card that isn't in standard or crafting a card just to have it rotate out would become much more common problems.
---
I'm not sure if there's a good way to solve this other than something as drastic as getting rid of classic packs and just give everyone the entire basic/classic set permanently. If they did that, they would be free to rotate cards in and out as they please.
---
Sure, probably one or two
---
Who was patient zero? 
---
I'm not really up to date with WoW lore, but Legion Schemes is an obvious reference to the Burning Legion, which are basically non-existent after the events of the Legion expansion, so I doubt it ties into Battle for Azeroth. 
---
But I bet you're right, maybe the next set is similar to Gadgetzan. I know a lot of people really liked the multi-class cards, so that would be a way to bring them back. 
---
Take 25 turns- 100 g/dust
---
Play 6? 1 cost minions- 60 g/dust
---
or maybe just use polymorph or hex on the barnes token if you're that desperate? tinkmaster overspark is still an alright tech card that has a place in the standard rotation and should stay that way.
---
I have the card back.  80g quest trades!  CrunchTime#1623
---
I think I just went through everyone if I missed someone, I'm so sorry!
---
You are right but I still guarantee you that in 12 hours you will met almost no player who does not have the cardback.
---
It looks just as fine, is just that you are used to the old art and know beforehand that specific piece was placed later.
---

Oh that seems stupid, like I understand if you concede but not them
---
Unplayable now smh
---
Out of the last 4 card changes, there has been 7 basic/classic cards nerfed, and 11 expansion cards nerfed. This doesn't exactly scream out that they are so called targetting both classic and basic. (https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_changes) 
---
I don't recall saying cold blood is the main problem, however I do recall saying baku is the issue. But please, continue to see what you want to see. 
---
It took the fall because it extended odd rogues reach, and how quickly games ended due to cold blood being played, not because it's classic/basic. Hunter's mark was nerfed because it was an auto-include, I don't know how many times I'm going to have to repeat this. 
---
Equality is different, just do me a favour and compare hunters mark and equality for me. Hunter's mark is 2 mana, change a single minions health to one. Equality is 4 mana, change up to 7 minions health to one. Do you see? Do you see how strong and incredibly cheap equality was at 2 mana? I hope you see. 
---
i have one if you wanna play me. im on na
---
Can I get a match against you? ^^
---
&gt; Aviana and windfury harpy basically have pasties in 
---
Hmm, you are not getting why this change though. It's not because tits are bad and sex is bad so we censor it. It's because oversexualization is a thing and lately some companies are trying to avoid / revert it. It's ok to have hot chicks in your game because hot chicks exist in real life. It's not ok, however, to have most women be hot chicks because you don't see any other value in women. You may agree with this or not, but it's the actual reason why some companies are backtracking on their "LOOK AT ALL THESE TITS" approach to character design.
---
I‚Äôm really starting to hate how every big developer caters to anything China. People aren‚Äôt realizing how much of a bad influence China is having on games today.
---
i would have so liked if he could design a card that he talks about is good to have. he said 'dirty rat' is good and cards like that are good, but cards like that are not easy to make without being unfun the moment you drop it, there's a fine line.  
---
i actually think  discard where opponent chooses which cards to discard is good, but problem with that is technology doesn't exist for that yet and i don't think it ever will.

Yeah but I'm not comparing the covered/uncovered versions. I'm talking about replacing the pic with a new pic using Jaina's new costume in BFA.
---
What's the purpose of Wild? Every patch one of your "deck that you can play forever" is killed to a nerf. Why hasn't Blizz considered that maybe, just maybe, it's time to rotate classic out and design a new set specifically to always be in Standard?
---
Thanks, but I already managed to find someone with it.  I guess it's already spreading fast.
---
My current issue is that I can't equip it because my card back collection freezes when I get a few pages in on iPhone.
---
Same, you on NA?

is there a sign up section for ppl looking to play with friends that have it?? 
---
As someone who's been in the video game industry for over a decade this is a viral feature which has been around for a long time and they're actually against first party guidelines (Microsoft and Sony's list of rules and restrictions a game must adhere to before they'll allow it to be released on their platforms).
---
The reason being those companies don't like making Online + other actual players a requirement in obtaining something in game. So yes it's creative, but it's not new or unique, it's just used very often due to said guideline requirements on first party platforms :)
---
More like Jaina Proudnomoore

This cardback is based on the [Corrupted Blood incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident) which happened in 2005.
---
McCree in Heroes of the Storm never
---
I already got it but thanks.
---
**Corrupted Blood incident**
---
The Corrupted Blood incident was a virtual pandemic in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, which began on September 13, 2005, and lasted for one week. The epidemic began with the introduction of the new raid Zul'Gurub and its end boss Hakkar the Soulflayer. When confronted and attacked, Hakkar would cast a hit point-draining and highly contagious debuff spell called "Corrupted Blood" on players.
---
The spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines.

---
Adding you now, you have the back?
---
(Have) NA Piotrsama#1647, who wants this amazing cardback?
---
the Core Set concept works like this (MTG has this):
---
every year, before the rotation, it gets a new release. it rotates out just like the other sets. this allows to release/retire cards with each core set release/rotation. you don't have to collect new cards every time a core set gets released, having an older "release" of the card will do.
---
You updated the app on iOS right?

You are gey

The goal of Trading Quests is adding someone that also has the "Challenge with a Friend" quest. You challenge them and both get 80 gold and then they challenge you and both get 80 gold. So both end with 160 gold.
---
The scam that sometimes occurs is that they add you, you challenge them and get 80 gold and the they remove you from their friends and won't challenge you. You get your original 80g but they get 80 free gold and the chance to keep doing it.  
---
Normally the people in that tread is good people that will trade with you :)

Equality and flametongue are arguably problematic cards. Or at least they were. Flametongue at its best was a 2 mana 4/3 and at its worst a 2 mana 0/3, which is better than most other totems. And as I mentioned in another post, just compare hunters mark and equality. Then you will see why it's an incredibly strong card. 
---
Banning may solve the issue in standard, but it would do nothing for wild. I know barely anyone plays wild compared to the amount of people that play standard, but that doesn't mean wild players don't matter. 
---
Leeching poison was nerfed because it was literally carrying kingsbane decks, this is why you rarely/never see kingsbane in standard anymore. It wasn't random. 
---
but who got the first Hakkar card back?
---
Just give it at random among players that played 10+ games this month.
---
Yes but how did you get two quests I only got one :(
---
Drakkari trickster might be able to snag it from the one person running kingsbane rogue.
---
I was ready to grind for hours to get the card back and ran into someone with on my first game! 
---
I bet my two nurs that 99.99% of players who got it like you will NOT understand what to do with it and just ignore it if they dont like the cardback (ergo dont bother to equip)

Both cards you mentioned will have so many possible outcomes in Wild that even if one is stupidly busted, it'll happen so seldom that it might as well be a complete non-entity.
---
In Wild, one would have to be concerned more with individual card combinations such as Metaltooth Leeper with cards like Galvanizer and Mech Wraper or Molten Giant and High Priest Thekal. The best way to balance them would be to just let them happen. It's an Eternal format, and in most other games with such a thing, balance updates are few and far between. Every deck in those formats can do crazy things and balance updates should only be done when there's a deck that feels absolutely awful to play against as was the case for Star Aligner Druid and Naga Giant decks.

Blizzard, please bring back ~~Tracer's butt pose~~ Jaina's cleavage.
---
server?

Hmm... there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a mobile update available for iOS. It‚Äôs not in the App Store. I also have the cellular data option enabled. Any other iOS users not receiving the update? Feels like we‚Äôre usually last....

Noooooooooooooooooooo

CD Projekt Red would have never censored Jaina like this. Praise Geraldo del Rivera.

Really? All i see is meta decks in casual. I only see weak decks if i concede a lot to lower my MMR.

Either way whenever someone covers up your favorite cartoon titties it's a little pre mature to jump straight to your favorite boogeyman.

Also who fucking cares lol

Might be affected by counter spell

whoa, buddy. Where's your NSFW tag?

Who the fuck is constantly staring at her boobs

No. The cards would not be anywhere near strong enough to justify doubling the restriction requirements.

I played an FPS that had an achievement that was an STD, when you or someone with the virus humped someone after death they got "shadowrun fever"

nice, I don't have nuts now :S

I would love to see this in action. What is the probability of getting this hand by turn 2? Including first/second and second galvanizer/spider tank please.
---
this. This post is made each week. Just dont pick him. 2 drops are really important in arena anyways.
---
Never craft cards in Hearthstone, craft entire decks at once. Crafting cards is a sure way to end up wasting dust when you ultimately don't use the card in any deck.
---
Also I would advise not to craft anything just yet. A nerf patch was just released, the meta will change a lot. Wait to know what it's like before crafting. (And at this point we'll be close to rotation, so if you don't need a new deck to play *right now* I would recommend to wait for the rotation.
---
Yes. Was it a nerf or did she just want to be comfortable?
---
Blizz so woke
---
no, 1x gold is &gt;&gt;&gt; 1x dust. 
---
Hahaa have only seen them on other people's games.
---
iOS players will have to wait til tomorrow, as per usual.  
---
of course, feminists are never hypocrites. 
---
Oh hey, you finally acknowledge that wild exists. Hurray! But the thing is, if a card is an issue in standard and it doesn‚Äôt receive a nerf, then it will also be a problem in wild. 
---
it should be the same as for the "challenge a friend" quests, you have to go &lt; 15 hp. That's just speculation if Hakkar works the same. 
---
"Games are art, and should be free from political pressure"
---
Art is inherently political.  I agree that games are art, it's one of the truths that I am most passionate about.  If games are art, then they deserve to be analysed like art, and political implications are part of that analysis.
---
But that's kind of a minor point here because I don't think it applies.  The cleavage was such a minor point that I cant imagine anyone getting offended by it, but at the same time, it's such a minor change that I'm not personally bothered at all.  Also, I don't think the artistic vision is compromised by covering up a 400 pixel flap of skin.
---
&gt; Also who fucking cares lol don't get your titties in a twist 
---
If you don't care then don't argue.
---
Someone with photoshop skills, hook is up with some heros nerfed with formal attire.

Blizz this is just sexist. Making a woman cover up like that because you think her clevage is evil. That's just messed up.
---
*searches for hex in warlock collection* *searches for polymorph in warlock collection* 
---
2/9&lt;9/9 Sure, maybe not every class should have an answer for this in the game, but out of all of the cards in the game, this is the way to nerf Barnes. Obviously, it would be better if they just printed a new card for this purpose instead of ruining tinkmaster for standard players but i‚Äôm Just trying to get creative
---
If you're willing to spend money to acquire a lot of entirely useless cards that will never see any play in any format, I would hope money isn't a problem to you, and the price would be irrelevant.
---
Anyway, buying enough packs to get all cards is probably a few thousand $.

what about garrosh and malfurion?

they are oversexualizing an unobtainable male body!!! REEEEE

Same here. Playing since beta and just got golden Warlock yesterday. Do thcc'dreally care for ranked as I mainly play meme decks but I'm actually enjoying the meta these last couple months. Sitting on rank 3 right now and gonna try to grind out legend.
---
&gt;  Ripped guys like Kratos are designed to be power fantasies and sold to a male demographic. 
---
That argument doesn't really work considering that most romance novel covers (sold and marketed almost exclusively towards women) have the same ripped guys on them.
---
&gt;Contrary to what most believe, "SJWs" aren't against sex or sexy things, but noone actually listens to what people have to say, so.
---
Remember when people complained about an ad simply because it featured a woman in a bikini, on the grounds that the woman (who looked perfectly healthy, not like an anoxeric runway model) promoted an "unhealthy body image"?
---
https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/29/beach-body-ready-ad-faces-formal-inquiry-as-campaign-sparks-outrage
---
&gt;The vast majority of complainants argue that the ad is offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image.
---
And before you say there is no proof the complaints were made by SJWs:

2nd game and I got it. I have a feeling everybody that plays while this event is going on will get it.

Not on a windfury minion.

Yup.  I just got it and spread it to 3 people in the last half hour.  When I went in to change it, it was already marked as "Favorite" so I imagine a lot of people are spreading it unwittingly.

Why does valve do it then?

Since Knights of the Frozen Throne you have a 10 packs legendary pity timer for all the expansions you haven't opened a legendary from yet. For expansions before Frozen Throne (Un'goro and wild expansions), it only works if you have never opened a single pack from them before Frozen Throne release. 
---
After you open your 1st legendary from a set, the pity timer is back to the usual 40. Epics pity timer is 10 with no exceptions.
---
If you still have a 10 packs pity timer for any set, i recommend opening the packs of that set one by one until you get that sweet legendary, because it's great value.
---
A small number of players receive it just by logging in.
---
It's a reference to [the Corrupted Blood Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident) in WoW if you weren't aware.
---
Can't access my heroic csrsbacks after this update. 
---
Not enough titties. 0/10
---
Too busy fucking with character portraits it seems 
---
One guy said it's conservatives who did it.
---
One guy argued no, it's feminists.
---
You came in and asked for a proof from this guy. So you obviously side with the other one. Burden of proof is on you just as much as him.
---
Is his decktracker messed up?  There's no Lich King in the tracker to the right but he clearly has one on board.
---
This isn‚Äôt even close to censorship, Blizzard chose to change the art. No one told them to, there was no legal pressure, they just did what they felt was right. This is a company acting in what it feels is it‚Äôs best interest, as is intended.
---
How could they ?? 
---
F
---
Please update Anduin while we‚Äôre at it.
---
i leveled up to 500 wins on mage for the first portrait only
---
This only deepens my resolve to never buy or engage with another Blizzard product again.
---
I can‚Äôt masturbate anymore when I meet Jaina in rank :( 
---
Literally unspellable.
---
love it when people fall apart when cards get nerfed. It feeds my soul
---
Yeah, cool, but why cant i use my heroic naxx cardback right now?
---
It's just a burka lmao you're triggered by a bit of cloth stay mad neckbeards
---
Gurubashi stay there for the rest of the game
---
&gt; you might remove the ability of that class to explore that space
---
Exactly. But Blizzard is insisting on nerfing basic/classic cards to open up new space. And that was my point: what new space has actually been explored? Tempo Warrior was replaced with... Rush Warrior? Which tries to do the same thing but worse.
---
&gt; Classes need that solid foundation. When you rotate it out (or nerf it) without replacing it, you can lose large chunks of the class.
---
That's what worries me so much about losing Equality. Paladin is now expansion-dependent on board clears and single-target removal.
---
I don't like that they're nerfing these cards. But if Blizzard continues to target them, I'd argue for a fluid Hall of Fame instead. A small pool of cards could rotate in and out as needed, while still existing unharmed in Wild. Like /u/1point7GPA said, you now can't even play the old Druid decks in Wild without Wild Growth/Nourish. At some point Blizzard will have to admit that Basic/Classic can't be considered "core" anymore. 
---

Stupid sjw company
---
As are the original comments
---
Magic players would like to have a word. Core sets never pose an issue and are actually liked because it changes the format a lot. It gives a break from cards that could potentially be busted depending on card interactions. And that game is money dependant, no free cards. 
---
Im wonder if you want tips.. of so.. the details and the character itself is looking nice  the main flaw is the perspective. The left arm feels lost while the right is clearly point at the viewer. Either the left can get smaller (creating a triangle) to indicate its moving away or enlarging it as it gets closer to the viewer. Of course making the left arm face the viewer isnt a simple make it bigger. But rather considering how we see an arm in front view. What go draw and what to omit to give the illusion of 3d

Blizzard has been targeting inexpensive basic/classic cards though, and I'd guess almost all players would have them anyway. It's not like they'd rotate out niche legendaries after one expansion cycle that people invested in. Worst case scenario give a dust refund.

I found him. I found the person who hates free stuff. That‚Äôs him, right there. 
---
The hell are you talking about, ice block?

I always found it odd that she had her cleavage exposed in that artwork. It depicts a point in time where her hate for the horde reached beyond her peak and would literally murder anything resembling an orc. I don‚Äôt think she had any concerns of looking sexy while doing it at that stage of her life.
---
Firmly disagree. If reddit has shown anything it's that the player base would be open to change. Very few people (if any) have said "man fuck kibler for even suggesting that we create a core mechanic with rotating cards". It allows for the game to become fresh and change the meta around more frequently. They can even create it as a pseudo "4th expansion" of the year. Making an expansion come out each season. 
---
I just really don‚Äôt like playing against OTK. It seems like every game of mechathun is watching the other person play solitaire until he‚Äôs dead or you are. There‚Äôs very little board interaction aside from clears. 
---
So Jaina is suddenly not a paragon of beauty because they bound her breasts? 
---
Maybe he meant the color pallete for the art of the cards. Warlock has aloooot of orange and green art.
---
Well, the only reason you'd want taunt over the bigger body is for defensive play.
---
The ultimate defensive card is the one that says "Too bad, no matter what I survive this turn." 
---
So Ice Block.
---
And the next best thing is obviously a 2/3 with taunt.

If they bring back the Cow King brawl i will be so happy

Yeah. People would have handled it so much more maturely if Blizzard announced the change.

Counterspell prevents spellmaster but not

PC culture is whined about more than most imaginary constructs.  Are you also worried about the hordes of sjws?

Definitely agree DX Rexxar is the main thing that makes Hunter decks crazy powerful. I was honestly expecting a mana nerf for that card
---
Unistalled
---
Ok i wont thanks
---
It's fuckin casual dude. 
---
I read it as ‚ÄúEmerald splash‚Äù
---
In the Lunar update notes we got notice that says "Non-Basic cards can be disenchanted for their full Arcane Dust value for two weeks."
---
What is non-based cards?  
---
I imagined this like you can disenchant common card for 50 dust, rare for 100, etc. Did I misinterpret that? Because disenchant value is still as it was before when I go to disenchant menu for all of the cards.
---
Oh yes because a 2/1, 1/2, 3/3 has a chance to stick on a board after you‚Äôve buffed it I‚Äôve seen warlocks use hell fire on lesser threats. Cold blooded has and always will be a removal option or a late game finisher (as in a last push or after you‚Äôve buffed up a minion with funglemancer in odd rouge but if you‚Äôve played funglemancer you‚Äôre going to win that match so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

As a wild player it is always funny to see ppl not know (or even hover cards to learn) effects of random cards (the different portals, evolve/devolve, wandering monster,...) I laughed yesterday when a murloc pally attacked into my wandering monster and I got a [[Sand Drudge]] Instead of killing it he left it at 1 HP. He conceded on my turn.
---
Ok, I got it the next time I played against someone with the card back.

Shaman is nuts as a draw engine for any burn type deck, it just needs a bit more cheap spells for support. If Aggro Shaman comes to be a thing after rotation, the spirit will surely be a core part of it.
---
Pack it up boys, we cured sexism!
---
Did a message pop up on screen or something saying you got it?
---
legit. i already have it and i played like 2 games before i did, its not that rare
---
Finally my spiteful spell hunter has more high cost spells.
---
Kibler has a TON of experience with TCG gameplay, and he is very eloquent. Great insights.

That makes sense I got a quest when I first logged in then I got a quest when the event went live.

All hakkar card back thread and the normal battle tag excahnge thread are already filled with these. no need for another one.
---
i only made one cause i actually packed the damn thing, wasnt gonna let it go to waste
---
Been playing for years but I have never, not even once, noticed a consistency between hero portraits and class cards. It's a bad excuse to keep certain color themes. Bigger problem is the totally different, rather cartoony art style.
---
Holy crap Soul priest's art is Wow....
---
(Anyway took me way too long to get what this post was complaining about)
---
Mhm. I didn't read it tbh.
---
Ahh the boner killing titkerchief
---
Is there notification once you receive it? I am sure I extremely rarely look at any cardback (and I set every deck I play to another even...). Just so I can use it for others then.
---
You never go full Libtard 
---
Ok I just read it. Apparently you have to play against someone using the card, or use the card yourself in a game.
---
We do not yet grant you the rank of legend.

Active reddit users are a small fraction of the playerbase. 
---
If we had sidedecks you could run furnacefire colossus
---
I still got the card back even though he conceded.  Thanks Blizzard!!
---
Thank goodness. Right now I have to clear the game data and effectively reinstall every time I want to launch the game.
---
Suuuuuuuure
---
I know this is still new a comment, but it‚Äôs criminal that it isn‚Äôt at the top. 10/10. 
---
This is it right here. Check out some china censored movies comparison on YouTube. They'll crop women to only above the neck and stuff like that
---
I highly doubt new players have memorized mana cost of cards, and even then they wouldn't really care why its reduced
---
I had to reinstall to fix. 
---
What do you mean with ‚Äúhit them‚Äù? 
---
This dude is brain damage

A burka wouldn't be enough, I'd expect Blizzard to give her, as well as the other female heroes, the full niqab treatment.

---
Do you know how to read a thread?
---
Are you new to reddit and internet in general?
---
1) THEY is in reference to the post I was referring too.
---
2) I don't KNOW why blizz did it, but I can use what WE call "deduction" and "logic". That let me put 2 and 2 together and draw logical conclusion. (you should try that some times).
---
3) See my previous point. Also nice try on that "do you have an agenda". Too bad you suck at gaslight buddy.
---
In my opinion, if a female character is designed explicitly for men, then yeah that seems a little objectifying. But, even if I agreed with you, Blizzard is just doing this as a business move to appeal to women that don't like when characters are obviously designed with men in mind.
---
Even Riot Games did the right thing and gave Graves his cigar back.
---
If a spell gets cast directly from your deck, is it considered a cast and not a play? Or neither? 
---
Alright, think for a second. Why suddenly Blizzard decided that the artwork was "too sensual" when they were fine with it before?
---
What constant trend can we see at blizzard lately related to female "representation" and feminism?
---
I legit just thought he was trying to be a smug asshole about "haha a 2/3 taunt? you must be stupid" but now I actually feel like he's really confused
---
I mean she would probably do it, she's pretty much a princess and capable of making sacrifices for diplomatic reasons. 
---
Maybe this was her own idea anyway, could be that it's just more comfortable.

You have to cover these filthy female forms. You wouldn't want so "thirsty male" to see them, amirit?

I'm on iPad in North America, I got the update about an hour after it was live for PC. 
---
Baku is a very safe craft because it is so powerful and because they may well nerf it at some point and you'll get your dust back.
---
  
---
  Wizzbang is also great, as a new player you get to try out lots of cards you can't otherwise access.  
---
The other very safe craft from the classic set is Leeroy Jenkins. Will always find a home as long as there are aggressive decks.

---
Is this some sort of bug? I noticed this right away and it looks super odd! Also, they once again forgot to animate his Hero Power....
---
Yes, you can disenchant common card for 50 dust, rare for 100... 
---
Two cards nerfed today, Flametongue and Hunter's Mark, are Basic cards (part of the Basic set). They are given to each player and cannot be crafted or disenchanted. 
---
More or less like this.
---
I've been playing for 2 hours and seen no one with the card. What's the fastest way of getting the card back ?
---
&gt; This argument always comes up in popular fantasy tropes. There‚Äôs an important difference between the two things you described. Malfurion, Garrosh, and Rexxar (all inhuman, by the way) being incredibly buff and shirtless is a male power fantasy, not sexual objectification. They‚Äôre given visible physical strength and agency.
---
Something that always gets ignored is the female power fantasy. People always argue that characters like Jaina and Sylvanas are just eye candy for the lads, but forget that quite a lot of women look up to them as being strong and sexy characters, with characters like Sylvanas still having strong following even after the horrible things she did in the lore. It really shouldn't come with much surprise that it's usually Women that are the ones that wear and request more slutmogs in wow. Why? Because they want to be someone they usually can't be IRL. Even my female friend refuses to play some games just on the fact that they don't offer something slutty to wear.
---
Is this true? Did they really lengthen the white top so we see less of her cleavage?
---
Because too much armor interferes with the magic that tears you apart
---
What if players get matched up with others who already have the card back?
---
https://ddg.co/?q=winnie+the+pooh+china

Dude you have the Explore Ungoro into Hemet combo. Its the only correct play I see here.

classic is slowly gained at every players. oh you left hearthstone 7 years ago? don't worry, you still have your basic and classic cards, those helps you get back on the game if you are f2p'er. It would be just plain stupid to remove the classic from standard, cause then the returning players would have only their basic cards.

how do you know how all men think? I don¬¥t think it is a power fantasy. I think it is just as "sexist" as having a women show cleavage.
---
also how do you know that all women think that showing cleavage is sexist?
---
showing cleavage can give women huge advantages and adency. just look at how many women make thousands of dollars simply on twitch donations by manipulating men and acting like their internet gf.
---
I think what it comes down is just huge feminist double standard and general desire to censor anything that men might like

Let‚Äôs say malygos rotates. Do you ever see a world where they rotate it back in? Because I don‚Äôt 
---
Definitely not a buff. You can use Spellstone in an even package now, but dealing two damage per turn is less useful away from an aggressive strategy. Without 1-drops to buff on turn 2, it‚Äôs much harder for hunter to be aggressive. And by turn 6/7, it‚Äôs that much easier to deal with Spellstones if you know they‚Äôre coming.
---
Besides, there‚Äôs a reason even hunter was never used previously. Consider which even decks are strong (at least pre-nerf): Shaman and Paladin, which guarantee a 1-drop from HP, and Warlock, which has the best draw in the game. Those are abilities that set you up well for future turns. Hunter just deals 2 damage to face. Not nearly as useful a build-around strategy.
---
Maybe it could work in the lower F2P ranks where you can still run neutral draw and battlecry damage cards without being too relatively weak overall, but it still doesn‚Äôt strike me as a great strategy.
---
you have the right to not update and as a result not play
---
reddit used to not link to a place if you didn't close the brackets around the /r/ part of a subreddit link

You go from a 100% chance to get a totem to a 100% chance to get a totem, which is therefore a x0 increase in effect.

---
Not just for the back but friend challenge too I know no one who plays
---
I‚Äôd love to play a quick game if you‚Äôre up for it, card back looks dope. 
---
The Emerald Spellstone nerf was totally fair. The Lesser Spellstones aren't supposed to be that good, but two 3/3s for 5 mana was already a decent card.
---
Is this really a big issue tho? How many times do you encounter someone that do this? If someone is AFK, you just need to wait a couple of turns. So really the only problem is just with people roping all the time for no reason.
---
So, is there a way to change this without affecting everyone else? If so, yeah, go ahead, but if you change all the rope system (affecting everybody) just because once in a while you encounter an asshole, well. Rope is good as it is right now.
---
This is such a spicy meme

---

---
Which deck is it?
---
It's because literally nobody cares when men are sexualized, but a certain brigade of people care way too much about sexualizing women.
---
This is probably because the threats they got from the Chinese censor board a few weeks ago about banning several Blizzard titles from sale there. Expect something similar to happen in Overwatch.
---
Bottom text caption comes from the old days when online meme generators were all the rage. You would have a couple of empty spaces to type the text and they were designated by top/middle/bottom w/e. Sometimes people would add an extra caption by mistake, which would result in a stupid sample text/bottom text caption, so they use this to show how low effort their joker meme is.
---
I consider myself a guardian of the people by doing this.  It keeps the roper off the ladder and away from decent folk longer.

---
At least they left his boobs alone! 
---
So you're saying she can keep the tee shirt as long as she loses the armor?
---
Yes it fits the lore but it's still not original. I already know about the corrupted blood incident and it is a really cool reference but that was accidental and not really what this is.
---
\*Stupid Sexy Flanders
---
&gt; Either the match is so intense that you use their rope time to plan ahead for your own benefit, OR, you have Netflix or something running as primary focus during their turn.
---
Option 3: I'm playing on my lunch break and only have 45 minutes to get enough games in to complete my quests.
---
This is completely a nerf. The card interaction is correct and there should be a dust refund on my golden Hakkar.
---
If it doesn't Work on several iOS devices ... I know this sounds stupid ... But you Guys ever thought about asking Apple for help?

I don't get it why this comment got so many upvotes ...could anyone explain plz..
---
I have no time for ga... ok, one then.
---
"**literally unplayable**" would mean that it's impossible to play. But it's not. You can play Keleseth without an issue, provided you have enough mana to do so. It's just that his battlecry will not not trigger if you have a two cost card still in your deck. Chill. No need to be overly dramatic. The card is playable. Battlecry is conditional.
---
Actually an interesting topic lol. Boobs are boobs 
---
Might be an android thing then because I'm stuck with this card back instead of the Lemonaide one.
---
i got it in the first game i played after i saw this thread. i think this is gonna spread pretty fast, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel special at all. they really should come up with more clever ways in which we can ‚Äúearn‚Äù cardbacks to make the game fun again.
---
You guys are asking a lot of this indie company 
---
Yeah, some sort of bug because my favourite was set to lemonade, then I specifically assigned lemonade to the deck I was playing and it's still picking up Hakkar.
---
Oh well, no refreshing card backs for me.

I'm putting together a budget Dragon Priest deck. I don't want to craft [[Duskbreaker]] because it's going to be cycled out of standard very shortly.  Are there any decent alternatives that do stay in standard or should I just not invest anything into this deck?

I'd pay for that, to be honest. And that's coming from someone who hasn't bought a thing in Hearthstone in years.

You must be playing braindead aggro at rank 20, then

---
Dude this is clearly censorship, it's not like they changed her outfit like they did with BFA Jaina, the only thing they changed was the amount of cleavage she showed despite her having looked like that since the game's release.
---
You can argue the reasons behind their decision, but at the end of the day the result is just that: censorship.
---
One can in fact write such a novel and not only claim to not be racist, but actually not be a racist. 
---
That is the power of fiction. What is written on the page is a fantastic eloquent beautiful convincing lie. Fiction is not meant to be an instruction manual or an accurate historic account. 
---
If I want to see boobs I'll play Shadowverse, but I may be a weirdo that is not horny 24/7 and does not have the necessity to have every single female character in a video game be Ms. Universe.
---
I mean, it's just a mirror of the Corrupted Blood event that happened in world of warcraft many years ago. I'm honestly surprised they didn't do it sooner. 
---
That is true. But there's needs to be a balance between long enough timers so there's high level plays (not just for grim patron/topsy turvey decks and such) but also short enough timer so a single match doesn't last for hours and hours.   
---
But due to the lack of a tournament/custom math mode or whatever, having different times in tournament vs regular in-game would be bad because players wouldn't be able to practice using the tournament time settings.  
---
When reading about this, I think of the time system used in the board game Go (or Weiqi/Baduk). In that game, players have a finite main time to use freely. After that, it's over time, where (depending on the ruleset) is X amount of periods of Y amount of time, where a player must make a move within the Y amount of time or else X periods decrease by one, for every move. Of X reaches zero, the player loses based on time.   
---
But even though we have such a system, there's no culture (and I would imagine it's similar with other games, like Chess) of BMing based on unnecessary usage of one's own time
---
Today I learned that lesbians don't like girls 
---
The rope system as-is is fine. Sometimes, you do need all the time you can get i.e. miracle 'anything' or topsy curvy or any combo/boardstate that just requires more thinking and we don't want to take that away from people. 
---
The issue is the asshat that roped you every turn... and there's no system that's going to prevent an asshat from triggering you. Even if the roping system is somehow reworked, he can still rope you every turn... it may rope quicker but it's not necessarily going to diminish the salt. A 35 min. game becomes a 20 min. is still 20 min. worth of angst. Could of just conceded and move on... it doesn't look like the game in ranked anyways. 
---
it's all made like "this is what you can do with these shrines", and then the triple battlecry guy has keleseth on 2, meanwhile you take the totem and start with 2 two-drops in your deck
---
Probably to avoid PSA of delays, so they probably try to keep the exact timing on the down low to not cause mass posts of news of delay
---
It did! Thanks for your help.
---
Just saw that WoW was on there. Literally the only way they're gonna fix that is either revamping the entire transmog system or removing minimalistic armor.
---
The changing of the various undead cards IS censorship though. A quick google will tell you censorship is defined as "the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security."
---
It's clear that Blizzard's artists' vision for the undead card arts involved them showing bones and other "gore" which they then changed in order to appeal to the chinese market. That is censorship.
---
I managed to get a bot running in a Discord server that just announces every patch to everyone on the server. If you use Discord, you could try a "third party" solution like that one. 
---
Even then, it'd be way better for Blizzard to get their own announcement in their own client... 
---
Did you check on your PC this morning? I bet your quests will look different there...
---
First thing would break the game. Disallows bluffing, which is important. I.e opponent can tell if you have weapon removal in your hand.
---
No fix yet -- here's the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/anqeon/megathread_ios_update_issues/) on this, I'm sure it'll be updated as a solution comes to pass.
---
a handful of random players! 
---
I literally know someone I go to college with who tries to ladder with odd shaman because he's convinced spamming taunt totem is the most op power play in the game. 
---
The difference being HotS Jaina is pre Bombing of Theramore. So it makes sense that Hearthstone Jaina looks different.
---
Somehow I already got it at rank 15 last night.  It happened before I read about the event too.  I didn't notice until I opened a pack of cards and went, 'whoa, that's not my card back. . . '
---
your responses were pretty random, that is why I was responding. 
---
Right on point, mah good sir, anyone who ever played chinese MMO-s can confirm that. Their whole gaming industry basicly lies on 2 cornerstones.
---
1. Ripping off AAA titles
---
2. Boobifieing those rip offs
---
I stopped playing hearthstone a while ago, because I knew this would happen!

what?
---
Can you show us the animation?
---
I mean, you could open up the blinds and maybe you'll see some stars out today.
---
Odd Shaman would be amazing if you summoned 2 random totems (with no totem limit).
---
I think that's exactly the reason why it's being implemented. They don't want the system abused rather than being something cool for people to look at. 
---
After I got the non-Lunar quest on mobile, I closed my mobile client and opened Hearthstone on my computer to see if it was a visual bug or if the issue would "fix itself". I still had my two non-Lunar quests and nothing changed =(.

I'm pretty sure Alexstrasza is more than 400 years old
---
Not sure what the solution is but i agree. That shit is the worst
---
I re rolled my quest before updating my app :(
---
They are copying that hearthstine spin-off mmo. 
---
thx !
---
It doesn‚Äôt have start of game either 
---
This just happened to me! 
---
I was playing odd paladin, got evolve off of my witch cauldron, then a Tess off my Liam. Played Tess, it random evolved a minion into Hakkar, thanks for the win RNG 
---
I'd say its weaker right now. I'm a pretty big fan but gotta say that with the last expansion you've got some pretty good points. Almost zero cards see play, after IMO several solid good hits with solo content (even though I wasn't a fan of Puzzle labs I recognized its contribution), the solo content here was abysmal. I think I've literally played 2 games.
---
I'm gonna have to see something fantastic to make me preorder or spend cash again.
---
ALL THAT SAID, I dont think a game dies until you cant really play. This sub is active. Nerfs are faster. And most importantly I can still queue into game in any mode in seconds. 
---
For comparison my favorite starcraft mode was groups vs the computer. Then queue times went from seconds to minutes. The day that game died for me was when I queue up, went, made lunch, ATE lunch, and the timer was still going. Never played after that even though I was curious about the final expansion.
---
Hey, I contacted Blizz customer support about this and they suggested to try switching to the default card back and it actually worked for me. They said they‚Äôve identified some kind of bug on iOS involving card backs specifically which causes crashing and freezing. 
---
But that's the problem. The cards from Ungoro, Frozen Throne, and Kobolds were too powerful. That's why the last few expansions have tried to lower the power level. If they just started printing OP things like Death Knights again, we'd be back in the same bag. 
---
Its actually a terrible situation because everyone is hoping that once those sets rotate the game will be balanced, and it might be. But it will also be boring. 
---
A year ago every other post on this board was about "power creep." Why are they printing better and better cards, making the basic and classic sets unplayable and the game too expensive (the game is too expensive were the other half of the posts).
---
Now, you never see those. Instead its all "the game is boring," and "I hate the classic set, they should get rid of it," because they have been lowering the power level. 
---
Frankly, I think they should have just kept printing more and more OP cards. At least the game was exciting then, even if it was expensive. 
---
blizzard pls

Hey, I contacted Blizz customer support about this and they suggested to try switching to the default card back and it actually worked for me. They said they‚Äôve identified some kind of bug on iOS involving card backs specifically which causes crashing and freezing.
---
I appreciate that change.
---
he tried with the beetle
---
Yes, the last year has been very poor. I am still optimistic about the game however, because the fix is so clear in my mind. Stop this trend of creating a combo rock-paper-sissor (matchup) coinflip (rng) generator and bring player agency back into the game. Make cards that cause player choice, during the game, to have a greater influence on outcome. 65% win rates are FINE if they are a result of player skill! Ugh, its so frustrating to watch interest in the game decline because of design choices that keep getting impelemented over and over. Change the card pool, give the refunds, shake up the meta, please! 
---
But it would solve the roping problem :D
---
They're pretty good about banning people for doing things unrelated to the game or one of its events if the community wants to get riled up at someone.
---
The moderators of most mtg communities are also pretty bad about targeting and removing people. Fun game though. Just play it with friends. Or only using arena
---
The Shaman Spirit is an incredible card draw engine, that you can have as a two of in your deck. It has already been showing up sporadically in Wild (4 - L) in a variety of decks, including variants of Burn-based Shaman, Maly Shaman and even Shudderwock Shaman (granted, none of these are very popular). I would imagine that post rotation, if standard ends up having a Shaman deck which is burn-based or combo-based, the Spirit will be a very strong draw engine.
---
... It was a nerf
---
‚ÄúThe new meta‚Äù sucks I guess 
---
4 years of working in JS and I never knew I can use it that way
---
Can I join?
---
Even Tinyfin Murloc Rogue let's go.
---
Unless they are changed/nerfed, Genn and Baku are expected to dominate the meta over the next year.
---
I wish roping when you have no move left to make would permanently reduce your turn timer for the rest of the match.
---
It's so annoying when people do this from the start of the mulligan phase.
---
Because they are far better than google?
---
Did you look what you replied to though? 
---
the Chinese public have their own cultural reasons for demanding those changes. What is the reason for censorship like this? who asked for this?
---
I don't mean this in an **'LUL ACTI-BLI$$ARD SUX'** way, but I think people are quite tired of being milked from expansion to expansion, rotation to rotation after so long, and people are losing interest as a result.
---
The required investment to have fun is only getting higher, and even then sometimes the meta just doesn't let you really enjoy yourself, nor does how the game design rewards only winning.
---
Even the goal posts are liable to move between new sets with changes to core cards that brick entire archetypes, which by itself isn't always a bad thing, but more often than not it is resulting in other costly 'fun' cards being rendered unplayable with no refunds offered.
---
I think people are struggling to invest in the game and as a result they are losing interest in the game quicker and quicker after each expansion. Despite more cards being in the game than ever before, Hearthstone still feels stale, and it's really difficult to get as excited about new content.
---
Your mom
---
1) Squelch  
---
2) Open a browser/movie/netflix/whatever  
---
3) Rope them back and chill  
---
lol that plot twist
---
I mean, if you don't craft Duskbreaker, you're forgoing an essential part of the deck for the two months we have left before the next expansion. I'd suggest you craft Duskbreaker if you really want that deck to work, it is an absolute powerhouse.
---
Plus it scales, unlike drain life.
---
It is a small thing, but for some reason it really bothers me.  I think it is the principle of the matter not the titties.  Crap move either way team 5
---
Dusted Kathrena because I thought she was trash. Boy, was I wrong.
---
Even when playing against normal opponents(aggro/midrange) control warrior can waste 25 minutes of someone's else time.

There is a high chance that it might be just you. But... there is always a chance that you are not :D

Yep, same issue. Can‚Äôt wait for NA to get even more packs for this!
---
Quest Mage: Finally, I can take my second turn. Oh wait.
---
It‚Äôs kind of particular. Janina probably got a little shirt because she‚Äôs the front of the game on a lot of promotional content. In-game is usually forgiven but the images in the store are scrutinized pretty hard.
---
I'm not sure that's what we get. It sounds like we get a RR-themed brawl with a classic pack, then a RR pack for doing it three times.
---
For me my pc is like my games console. That's where I come to do my "proper" gaming. The way my job works I don't take work home with me so I do my time at work and then can do whatever I like in the evenings. So instead of watching tv or whatever I'll usually just fire up the pc and play some games. I do find I have a lot less time than I did before to do this but I enjoy it so I make time for it.
---
Wait what? Do I have to actively deselct it again?
---
Yesn‚Äôt

That it has never crossed your mind that it was inappropriate is something I totally get. I'm still only just starting to see that so much I liked or wouldn't think twice about actually has these problematic elements. Because we are raised to think it's normal.
---
Talk to women, and give them a chance to explain what they find problematic about the games we love. If you listen, you will start to see it, just as I did.
---
Considering that Legion and BFA changed a lot of the heroes around a bit story-wise.  Plus, with March's card back being Kul'Tiras, it would be amazing for the heroes to get a new portrait.  Even if it does cost a bit of extra money and/or work.
---
Brian Kibler is one of the most influential HS players on earth. 
---
yknow i got wooshed n didn't read the content properly so big apologies
---
If animations are an issue, then make it an optional mode and in that mode animations are all disabled. 
---
And if it's gonna be *too confusing for new players* then only make it available for people who hit rank 5 or legend at least once.
---
Are you complaining about the actual Elemental Mage (either Kibler's big Hand variant or others that run 10+ elemental cards) or confusing it with Big Spell (Control) Mage which runs maybe 6 elementals? 
---
Oh ok. Gotcha. Nice!
---
Blizzard has the technology to do this? Colour me impressed...
---
She does have strech marks on her hips, never noticed it, thats nice 
---
When I heard about it, I was like cool, I'll probably get it in like a few months with as few games as i play.  I've played 3 games since the patch dropped and 2 of my opponents already had it
---
Hence why I also called it a x4 technical multiplier.
---
Yes; you go from a 100% chance to get 1 totem to a 100% chance to get 1 totem.
---
You also go from a 25% chance to get the totem best for the situation to a 100% chance to get the totem best for the situation.
---
Judgeing the power scale of the Shaman hero power is difficult. Same with Warlock's. But the point is there is a case where you can say it is 4x better. 
---
Compare every single other Hero Power upgraded.
---
Mage [1-&gt;2], Warrior [2-&gt;4], Druid [1/1 -&gt; 2/2], Rouge [2 damge over 2 turns -&gt; 4 damage over 2 turns], Paladin [x1 1/1 to x2 1/1's] and Priest [2-&gt;4] are all x2 multipliers.
---
Hunter [2-&gt;3] is comparatively weaker than all the others at a x1.5
---
Warlock can't be judged, since it's a reduction in selfdamage. Which is actually even a negative in some cases.
---
Shaman is hard to put an exact value on as well. You could say it's x1 in your example; or x4 in mine. We both have valid points.
---
It's usually in comments, because when you actually try to print the proposed rule change on a card, the problems with this approach start to show. In your case for example, "Always starts in your hand" doesn't convey that the following text happens at the start of the game, without needing to play the card. 
---
Oh my apologies, couldn't tell from the pic. It is certainly more annoying in ranked and it's a shame that people do that but you shouldn't let it get to you. 
---
It's always too easy to catch a plague! 
---
&gt; In lower brackets some "players" play the rope game hoping for that 1 in a million chance that your phone will die waiting on them
---
Well, that's why (one of the hundred reasons) why I think Blizzard should do something about it. This is just not fun.
---
Didn't know this was a thing until I played a game and just gained it...
---
Who was patient 0?
---
I played a friend yesterday and got the card back from them, so this isn't true. It's likely their client was out of date.
---
Yes, I would expect that from a smol indie company
---
i got one bfowler55
---
&gt;While they are annoying and overly strong, they are here to stay and will end up fine in Wild as a more powerful mix of Odd and Even cards are printed to diversify the meta
---
I'd argue the opposite is true. As more cards get printed the cost of only using even or odd cards goes dramatically down. You can only include 29 cards in your deck (since one will be Genn or Baku). If there are 100 cards on the level of Doomsayer or Ziliax or whatever 50 odd and 50 even. Why would you not just use the ones that let you get a significantly stronger hero power? Is the benefit of using a few of the good cards from the other side worth giving up a better hero power for the whole game, assuming the cards are of relative strength?
---
We can already see stuff like this happening now with even shaman. The deck is nuts in wild because they have access to a bunch of cards that were printed when there was tier Shaman. The Jade Cards, Thing From Below, Totem Golem, Devolve, Maelstrom Portal, Flamewreathed Faceless, etc. Are just absurdly powerful cards on their own. As time goes on and more classes have access to more cards on this power level they'll be forced to play even/odd decks as well unless they have a really good reason not to (i.e. Big Priest not wanting to add Genn to their res pool).
---
They don't matter anymore? Didn't know that.
---
What is it now? I mean I know tournaments give some (I think?) but what else? There has to be something other than tournaments right, or how do you get in for the first time?
---
Mine's working, but there's no voice audio. Music is playing, just no emotes, Baku/Genn voice lines at the start of the game, etc.
---
Tell it to the OP.
---
Considering BfA lately, we could actually move Anduin over to Paladin and find another Priest to step in.  Though this might make for confusion in Wild with the Death Knights.
---
For anyone confused about why this isn't an event themed brawl, those start February 13th. 
---
Definitely China.

Good news he never said that he said some days he no longer has fun but that is way different from just not liking it all together
---
I was trying to play a few minutes ago and noticed the same thing
---
13th
---
Last May I really liked the [Lunara's garden cardback](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/Z1YT70ZSOY9L1523050012137.png). I liked it so much I jumped on the NA and asia servers on the last day of the season to go and get it there. Turns out I wasn't very active that season and I didn't play 5 games on my main server, EU... I never bothered to check.
---
So the seasonal cardback I liked the most is the only card back I'm missing... :(
---
Jaraxxus because it's the most fun to play
---
It‚Äôs my first iPhone and it‚Äôs sooooo problematic kinda wish I had my galaxy
---
I have three people in my friends list looking for a brawl and I'm in queue for 4 min so far... rough.
---
I like this so much! Must be even more fun when you're in the top too, know who's ahead/behind you.
---
I wonder what you guys think, would it be good or bad if they also listed the players MMR? 
---
It'd be interesting to the 'viewer' for sure, but I'm not sure how it'd impact the people who are in the top.
---
Thanks :) 
---
True. I struggled with text size!
---
Should've played around it
---
I waited 4 min and couldn‚Äôt get into a game. Gonna restart the app
---
&gt; the same problem. Queued against someone with the cardback, he quit/dc'd after a few turns. No cardback :(
---
Not worth the effort until the plague die down. It's spread out exponentially, and pretty much everyone has it already (since it autoset your card back to this one)
---
It becomes your default/favorite when you get it. You can switch off though
---
What about garrosh? Dudes rocking mad pecs and 6 pack. He needs to be censored too.
---
It seems to me the only way to specifically punish the asshat is for Blizzard to implement a report system for unsportsmanlike conduct/excessive roping. I doubt they would ever do this though because the only legitimate reason for an in game report in HS is this exact one. The only other one I can think of is suspicion of  botting. 
---
Again, sexism and sexuality. Learn to differentiate, and eductae yourself about the male gaze.
---
As long as one player gets to 15 health or below, it counts
---
So that's what that was.  I was tapping the screen to start a new game immediately after finishing and I tapped through what looked like a quest finish, which I now recognize as obtaining this card back.
---
Fair enough lol
---
I can't wait for the rotation. I mean I really enjoy playing with Year of the Mammoth cards, I think we can all agree that they still are great cards, just a way too high powerlevel. WAY too high... I don't want games anymore where someone generates like 15 cards in 9 turns. I don't want games anymore that consist of one side stalling the game with heals, clears and delays just to drop a 3-5 card combo and win. We've always whad combo and OTK but not at this, sorry for the lack of a better work, casual level. Exodia Mage always requires you to act precise, plan and manage your resources, just and example. But OTK decks right now are really just stall and play out your hand. Genn and Baku being totally unhealthy for the game is not a question. Tbh the only solution I can see is to just remove them from the game or have them do something different entirely. I don't see a fix to them. All in all, I just can't wait for the cards to leave. We'll have a pool of "not so great" cards but there's also a new expansion coming. And I'm pretty sure there's a lot of interesting stuff we missed out on, simply because some decks have been around for almost 2 years now with minimum changes. 
---
In that case things are happening so you aren't a rope guy, your opponent can easily tell this. 
---
Why doesnthe event start on feb 13th though, that‚Äôs what confuses me.
---
Holy crap this brawl blows.
---
I really wonder if the long queue times are due to not many people wanting to play it. 
---
I logged out and back in and it was there. I would have kms if I had to play skelesaurus hex again lol.
---
Sooo, will they nerf Malfurion¬¥s nipples too?
---
for the first time in not that long for me, but it's been less than a minute each time. My personal theory is that the new cardback is causing issues for the servers
---
When I saw all the threads of people asking to do friend matches yesterday I knew most people haven‚Äôt experienced an event like this. These spread like crazy for the first two months, it would be impossible to not get it through normal play. 
---
And I was just asking. Two totally neutral people having a neutral chat. 
---
Took me like 30 seconds to get in, which is extremely long for a tavern brawl on the opening day.
---
...they are not?
---
Everyone has their opinion on balance. After what I've heard suggested on this sub I'm so glad blizz actually looks at data then listening to people here. 
---
Now that I said that, balancing around a FEELING is so much harder than balancing around win rate. Shudderwock was a good example. Early data indicated the deck wasn't super good, but basically losing to "sit here and watch 6 minutes of animations" felt so horrible they did adjust things
---

Most of the time, the meta corrects itself.  A deck, by itself in a vacuum, is usually not overtuned (another way of saying that is that any deck is potentially overtuned, depending on the meta).  When a lot of people start using that deck, it creates counter decks.
---
Also, because Hearthstone is a mobile game they have to follow protocols for the Google Play Store and the App Store.  If this was purely a PC or console game, they could continually tune it like they do with their other PC games.

Maybe revert the hero power when they're drawn? 
---
That could also work 
---
Started ever since the update for me. In the beginning it was like 0-15 seconds, now it's a minute. In primetime europe...and it's only rank 10 so it should be full with noobs and their rush decks.
---
Bad coding probably. It is probably coded that after the game is "over" to unmute the opponent. So the last few moments they can issue a bit of "bm".
---
I emote, but mostly for good games or to acknowledge that I know they have lethal. A little bm when I play lower brackets and someone plays an obviously bad turn.

It was specifically Even Dragon Paladin the guy was proposing.

It was just to get a ton of people to log in on the update day. I'm sure that the event numbers for CNY are huge.

This is such a huge pet peeve for me. I understand taking your time to make an optimal decision, but this isn't a grand master chess match. It's a digital card game. The stakes don't really warrant it. If you're just doing it to be a dick, that's also problematic.   
---
Already up on EU? Is this a new thing? iirc it was always around 22.00 or 22.30

Well, the only chinese mobage I've played is Azurlane and they definitely censored that. It was a process of slowly ripping away things from those who played on the Chinese server until they stopped letting you on unless you have government id.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I believe it. Especially against lower ranked players. Half the time I'm roping someone it's not because I'm being petty its because it took me the entire 1.5 mins to come up with the "perfect" play. Even something as simple as should I play the secret I top decked or the one I held in mulligan could take a few moments to choose the right play. 
---
Playing mind games is one way to win otherwise unwinnable games. One time I BM'd over and over then held a spell (non hero targetable) over my opponent and they conceded thinking I had lethal, truth was they had me beat the entire game.

Lol. Do you like...know how plate armour works? Anything that can actually smash and puncture plate mail isn't going to care if its got boobs on it or not. A sword does not stab through plate, it can't. You aim for the weak points *where there is no armor at all*, not where the armor is thin because you still ain't getting through.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
What
---
Well "Start of Game: if you deck has only __ (odd/even) cost cards Upgrade/your starting hero power costs(1) but curse it" and if you were to look at it in the collection screen whether that be crafting or just looking you can have a hero power section akin to a hero cards that alternates through the different hero powers. And when deck building would select the hero power you'd have in the class you picked. 
---
Also the Turn numbers have never been directly referenced but you wouldn't need to you could simply put for example "Summon two 1/1 silver hand recruits. Cannot be cast next turn." which next turn has been referenced before on cards like  [[Loatheb]]
---
Lore walker cho is actually mildly playable in even shaman, should try it sometime. however now we lost flametongue so even shaman is kinda fuked

He used to have 5 health and he tried to draw at the end of your turn instead of start of turn.
---
Very early alpha patch knocked him down to 4 health.
---
He got very popular during the beta with many games being determined by one player's Nat Pagle being much luckier than the other player's (imagine both players doing the same thing but one guy draws 2 cards and the other player draws 0, in a format where there's a lot of value trading similar to Arena).
---
With tournaments being decided by the player with the luckier Nat Pagle, they decided to nerf the crap out of him, moving the draw to start of turn.  He was never seen again.
---
You can confirm both patch changes in his notes on this page: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Nat_Pagle
---
Eh, I think it's more likely it came down from above.
---
Shouldn't the buffed version be called "Jaina Proudmost"? 
---
But which is which
---
Fuck you sjws. Jaina is my milf mommy. Noname55 n Dandonfuga make the best lewds with her 
---
See, thats the point. You assume, that I, as a cis male, would be botherd by cocks flying all over the place. I wouldn't be, I have played VN's with homosexual themes and I don't think it woud make me uncomfoartable if it was the general theme. 
---
The next thing is the question, why we compare the chest with genitalia? If every female would rock a solid cameltoe if would understand it, but in that casae the comparison is just false. On top of that, a lot f the male characters are as much fanservice as the more skimpy females.

Lmao yes "it" is: https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/style-and-usage/affect-effect-grammar.html

Something doesn't **affect** you  
---
or
---
Something has no **effect* on you  
---
The former is a verb, the latter is a noun, OP used the latter as a noun, so that's wrong.
---
Affect is a verb.
---
Effect is a noun.
---
They're right. It should be affect.

Rodney Carrington's first attempt at the song.
---
yes it is where the deck gets its power but that initial curve isn't the issue. It is the ability to just do it **every** turn. Halving the amount of turns you can use the hero power both makes draws more impactful as if you don't have a 3 drop on 3 you can't just compensate by getting two more silver hand recruits. Pacing your cards becomes important as you cant just build that advantage every turn. Warriors wouldn't get 4 armor every turn against aggro making the match-up much more winable and inversely you wouldn't need 16 defiles and a hellfire to clear all the tokens from an odd paladin. 
---
The point isn't to outright kill the cards. it's about giving making them manageable which this change I imagine would do.
---
This weeks Tavern Brawl be like
---
1)Play a minion
---
2)Kill it with a "random" spell
---
3)??????
---
4)Concede
---
Don't worry guys, I'm sure the old hero skin will be in the store for $20 soon enough.
---
But taking historical logic, and because female armor is a modern invention, by today standards, boob-plate still looks fuggin dumb. The raised dome is a much more appealing look than two boob plates. (Even taking into account the Greek abs armor).
---
i think it speaks more to the grind. grinding legend is boring. its the worst part of the game.

This brawl is how HS tells you it doesn't like you.
---
7 losses to get a win.  Just... Ouch.  At least a few of them were done by turn 3.
---
U should make one for that druid hero that i cant remember her name
---
Well it is true that other than aggro, the best counter to combo is a faster combo. Hakkar Druid beats OTK Paladin most times as long as the Paladin isn‚Äôt smart enough to keep 10 cards in hand - even so, if the Druid puts 8 bloods in deck then Togwaggles, the Paladin can‚Äôt do much except bounce horsemen.

---
Something has no **effect** on you  
---
The former is a verb, the latter is a noun: **Effect** can be used as a verb in one particular situation, which is not this one.
---
That is true and I agree, but I'm still defending the entire concept.
---
To put it simply, if a badass female warrior wants to wear boobplate, I'm not going to be the one to stop her.
---
The holy trinity
---
&gt;You don't get arrested for dressing like old Jaina.
---
That isn't what he said.
---
In light of the nerf to wild growth, nourish, and innervate, I think the changes to lore and keeper could be examined again. Those were made specifically with the idea of keeping ramp intact 
---
41, damn star inflation is real
---
It was given to random players and then they spread it
---
...you...you really dont remember all the anger about odd and even Paladin recently? I'll give you it's not as bad as hunter but pally has been oppressing for awhile.
---
And even that aside, all the bitching has been about hunter which they just nerfed, so they are obviously looking.
---
No, most of those sources are what gamergate didnt like, so the sources are biased against it. 
---
*Gul'dan steals my life force through his massive cock*
---
Blizzard.
---
You make online games.
---
How can you NOT BE aware of the Streisand effect?
---
You DO realize that Jaina's boobs have received more attention in the last couple of days than the 5 years the game has been out, right?
---
Anyway, thank you for giving me some time of my day back.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between Jaina missing an Undershirt and a game like Force of Will. One of these games has female characters who, yes, have breasts, big deal. The other game has such a focus on the hypersexualization of women that, since I don‚Äôt know the names of any of the cards, refer to the cards as ‚Äúhentai chick,‚Äù or ‚Äúmiss
---
Lifts her legs up too high,‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúhigh queen big tits.‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt care if Jaina wears an undershirt, but it‚Äôs crazy to think that her original state was some attempt to make her deliberately sexy.
---
Oh so you‚Äôre just a straight up bad person, glad we got that settled.
---
If you want to learn how to cho it up check out WowHobbes 
---
The nerf to hunter did fuck all so they aren‚Äôt listening.
---
It‚Äôs like moaning about a cars performance to a company and then coming back with changing the colour!
---
Finally I meet someone with worse Legend pulls then me. Thank you for making this player, who had to dust DK Garrosh, Clutchmother, Lady in White and Cho to make Whizbang, feel better.
---
I've since pulled Zillax, Kangor and Endless Army but for a month or two there I was certain my RNG had decided to give up on me and go to the pub instead.
---
(I was also awarded Gonk as my free Rumble Legend, but I pulled Rhino too, so maybe my luck is starting to turn a little - I'm 3 packs away from the 70 pack pity timers on Witch, Boom and Rumble so let's see what I get next)
---
Few random players started with it, and went to spread the infection.
---
How much did Blizzard pay you?
---
He's a good ladder grinder but a bad tournament player. He's on the same team as ShtanUdachi though. 
---
Paladin was like the second most played class after hunter and the class with possibly the most archetypes.
---
$10 says he just crafted those for the karma.
---
Hah good one.
---
In fact, I pay th√©m to play!
---
Hearthstone Deck Tracker can also show you a timer in a windows.  
---
you can have it in the foreground of any other game or internet page 
---
That is precisely correct. 
---
Funny how you didn't comment this on any of the positive comments. ü§î
---
Yes, I do have 1000's of dust I am not using. The point is there is nothing I want to use it on at the moment! What I am trying to say is unless you want to spend the dust then there is no point in liquidating your cards into currency (dust) as by keeping them in stocks (card form) you have a chance to earn more and no chance to lose! Except in the extremely unlikely circumstance that Blizzard makes dust refunds more stingey.  
---
So for example if I have 4x biology project I already have that extra dust from the spare 2. If I keep it in card form then those 2 cards could potentially be worth full refund value if it is ever nerfed but if I do need the dust now to craft a new legendary or whatever then you can just do it when you need to craft it. No point having liquid dust in your collection. Am I starting to make sense yet?
---
The last time I tried it, the leader was corrupted in-game. So it didn‚Äôt work. The subreddit wasn‚Äôt too helpful. The last update on this was a year ago. 
---
It's so we all get Valentine's gifts this year.
---
A witch!!
---
or just because the set contains cards that support the classic set archetype instead of driving the archetype in either a new direction or just coming up with a new wincon. like how spellstone made the jank that was secret hunter with cloaked huntress and putricide into an actual deck. look at counterfeit coin as a card. it was used in the MSoG miracle but the wincon was again leeroy coldblood/ malygos/leeroy faceless aka not anything new. the set philosophy should also be changed if trying out a new archetype make sure they have something relevant at the end of the year so that we play with that instead of the same old thing we are playing with 
---
Thank you for not denying it and also "them" doesn't have an accent over the letter e.
---
Because it's not piecemeal but by groups. Cards would be internally labelled by  theme. 
---
There are 15 classic cards for each class currently. By focusing on indentity and theme, you know Mage has 5 Fire cards, 5 Ice Cards, and 5 Secret cards in Classic and you can add 5 Classic Elementals by swapping out 5 Ice cards. Then in 2 years, you can add the Ice cards back in.
---
freetoplay btw
---
How does a little bit of cleavage even amount to this comment lmao, it‚Äôs not like every second card has giant tits. Lmao this is sad.
---
False equivalence 
---
It's poking fun at Blizzard playing the public decency police, cracking down on any perceived immorality by changing artworks no one would have really cared about.
---
They are probably doing it to keep the game running in China or something.
---
I couldn't even tell the first time the comparison pics came out what changed
---
Whenever a card gets nerfed, no matter how tiny it is, people abandon the class until some streamer makes a new meta deck. 
---
Second most played here‚Äôs a pie let‚Äôs cut it up into potions give hunter 60% of that, paladin 20% of that and then divide the rest of among the rest, 2nd most played yeh, that‚Äôs a great way to look at it...
---
You sound smug and uncreative, friend.
---
Neither did anyone when they tried to ‚Äúfix‚Äù Tess too. That‚Äôs the problem. 
---
Wee sorry my post shows that to be wrong, hunter has increased and even spell hunter doesn‚Äôt seemed bothered by nerfs.
---
It‚Äôs done fuck all to them and just drove more to playing the class.
---
You also sound upset, friendo. 
---
i didnt read the title sorry 
---
I don't know much about erotic fiction (if you asked me, I'd have said that those book covers were of male homoerotica but sure) so I went and checked those authors to see if it's a pattern. And yeah, it's not. Those book covers seem to have been cherry-picked to make a point, and I'd rather have something more conclusive than that. 
---
...okay. I'll bite. What should they, with their mountains of data and desire to keep a customer base that pays them, have nerfed instead?
---
Good ol equality, average sized boobs are not ok, but muscles so large that even if you downed 30 bottles of steroids a day and worked out every day you would never attain like malf garrosh thrall are totally fine. Not to mention being that big would kill you by 40.
---
I don't think the people who complain about this kind of stuff know what equality means.
