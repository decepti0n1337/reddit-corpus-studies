Agreed.
---
---
---
The entire thing is insignificant. His role is as important as any other player in the tournament, which is to say not at all. They are all just video game players. What's wrong with just playing it out and replacing him next time?
---

---
And I never said any of that. Don't strawman me. You don't need help looking silly.
---
Here's my point, all summed up, in a way even you can grasp through your seething rage.
---
&gt;Any opinion on the matter outside of "Huh, well he should probably quit one or the other or he will keep losing," is ridiculous, hence my ridicule.
---
In every competitive HS broadcast, you actually spend more time watching adverts or just the commentators talking bullshit than the matches themself!  Something needs to be change!
---
Prior to the banker there weren't any suboptimal plays indistinguishable from a concentrated player. That's what i meant. The plays he could have made don't get any magically better the more he thinks about them in holy wrath paladin... You either draw the cards or you don't lol
---
Not sure how much he's getting paid from grandmasters but from I can tell the autochess tourney he was playing for was actually pretty high profile with a $1,000,000 prize pool... which pathetically is more than what hearthstone offers. So it's not like he was just clowning on his phone for a random for fun match. Given he got blizzard's permission to play in both tournaments at once too, well... I kinda like his spirit to try both.
---
Does look pretty good with either of those, but now you're up to 14-mana 3-card combo.
---
The Tundra Rhino one seems the more realistic, since you wouldn't want to run a terrible card like Starving Buzzard that is dead without the combo like you said.
---
This would be a turn 8 play for the first half where you play one cat and the Dire Frenzy. Then on turn 9, you Tundra Rhino and play a 1/2 and three 4/5. Charging damage of 15, but overall much clunkier than just the old Druid Force of Nature + Savage Roar finisher.
---
The good thing is all of the cards are decent on their own, so you don't need to save them for the combo in every matchup. Pretty decent, not busted I think.
---
It's different because Dog continued to be competitive in GM and practiced every week and did his best throughout his commitment.  He respected the audience and the other players who weren't invited enough to put his best into the first season and then withdraw after.
---
What Seiko did was spit in the face of the fans, Blizzard and other competitors who would appreciate the opportunity he was given.
---
The two situations aren't even remotely similar.
---
Ohhh so fuck the people that care about the event because its a game? Why are you here if you dont care about games or the people that play them? Why make this post if it doesnt matter? Its just as insignificant as you claim having games as a job is
---
It's also worth noting that he's friends with a lot of the casters so it's a lot more casual than it probably should be when they interview him.  He's known more for jokes than super serious commentary anyway.
---
When did I ever say "fuck these people"?
---
I didn't. I said you are overreacting. Which is true, you lunatic.
---
If you draw one then there is only one Reno in your deck it would still work
---
Are you dumb? He made the dumbest mistake ever while playing 2 games at once. It actually shows how much attention you need to play hs at a high enough level.
---
It's not a fucking book. 30 seconds worth of text is too long to read? You have attention span of a toddler or what?
---
To end this whole pointless discussion... Competitive HS is significantly more random than lots of other esports. Mostly because it's a card game, which is inherently random. But anyone saying that there's no skill involved and it's just RNG has absolutely no clue what he's talking about.
---
Kinda off topic, but I respect Zalae as a player, he's definitely a smart guy, but does he even really like the game? Whenever I hear him talk about playing HS, it almost seems like he treats playing exclusively as a job. In fact, maybe 5-6 months ago he was streaming with FireBat and he legit said something along the lines of "I consider hearthstone a job, I do other things for fun like going to the gym". Thats fine, I just dont really find him as "fun" as Kibler, fbat, or many other streamers.
---
Yeah, there are very few games out there that have a commander mode (Infinity Wars ccg is the only one that comes to mind for me) in the wide world of online ccgs. While this is not something that could immediately work in hearthstone it is something i could see with a future expansion. There should also be a custom game mode to replay past Tavern Brawls etc.
---
Have you read the other answers? You can't.
---
you don't need to be genius for this Understanding, hs is made for casual players and has nothing lost in esports, they only (tried) to push the game into it to make more money.
---
Oh, I definitely agree and I'm pretty surprised that was their stance on it, but that's a Blizzard issue. I was looking at it from Seiko's perspective, which does seem more reasonable knowing that he asked in advance.
---
Wolf got me again today. He was 3 then.
---
curve 5 have better options differently of curve 4 and you practically lost a turn bcs or you play something and pop up a secret or you lose tempo and losing tempo is practically lose
---
Unseen sabatuer is my favorite card in my quest shaman
---
The poker comparison doesn't work beyond the surface level.  In poker, you can calculate more exact odds, because the cards are just the cards.  The only random element is where they are in the deck and whose hand they end up in and in what combination.  There aren't cards that make your opponent reveal one of his hole cards, or turn one of your cards into another, or discard your hand and try again etc.  
---
The basic strategy might be the same, but hearthstone can't be played at the same level of consistently playing based on the  odds that poker can.  Not even close.
---
it will be a good buff and all this sh*t just because secret mage cant be nerfed
---
If people want to watch good players shooting the shit and not focusing, they watch streams.  People who watch the premier Hearthstone tournament want to see a high quality of play, especially now that these players are basically the brand of Hearthstone GM.  Even with Seiko clearly not playing at his best, as long as he's not the lowest-ranked GM player, it doesn't really matter.
---
Probably just mad bored with the meta lol.
---
The part on showing up in pajamas doesn't affect how the players play, in fact it may make the player feel comfortable and play better. In dota 2, iceiceice used to play in boxers and according to him, it made him play better
---
even though it's tier one and really strong, i'm unsure if secret mage fills up 20% of the wild meta at any rank.
---
This is such a strange post. Why equate single player to multiplayer? Who is spending 20k dust to craft Highlander Mage, and what player concerned about costs spends a significant amount of dust crafting such an expensive deck featuring two extremely controversial cards that were obvious nerf candidates? Why would you list Quest Druid and Quest Shaman as alternatives when there are stronger and more affordable decks like Combo Priest and Aggro Warrior?
---
So you have time to get all the basic cards for each class without getting demolished by net decks early. If you’re confident (or have a hunter deck) though you can totally skip
---
Don't skip. You earn several free packs climbing from 50 to 25 and will mostly be matched up against players with similar collections and of similar skill. Once you hit Rank 25, you'll notice that you're matched up against better decks more often and won't be able to return to the lower ranks.
---
I think the problem is more that skipping animations gives such an advantage, not that players are skipping animations per se.  I don't think animation time should be how team5 balances the game.
---
Whilst it may not be the only reason, it is an accepted option
---
&gt;An alternative explanation has it that the word originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot.[5] These sports were usually played by peasants, as opposed to the horse-riding sports more often enjoyed by aristocrats. 
---
Regardless, football is a way of describing a great many sports, some of which involve carrying the ball, some involve using your feet. 
---
Using instruments such as a tennis racquet, cricket bat or hockey stick do not tend to be in that however

---
its just a game. calm down.
---
the first ranks are there for new players to get to know the game without losing stars when defeated. 
---
Its there to create a more relaxed learning atmosphere and limit the people with meta decks. also you get some kind of reward after reaching 25.
---
the skip option is for old/returning players that already know how to play and want to start immedeatly with rank 25
---
Instead of banning the guy why don't people just beat him?  If he can be a top player and still play another game at the same time, just beat him and let him rank drop.
---
Was it for the autochess tourneys going on?
---
&gt;I'm considering dusting every mage card I have and learning a new class. I'm a ftp player, and don't wanna spend money on the game, so it just makes sense to only play one or two classes maximum.
---
It definitely *doesn't* make sense to play one or two classes max as a F2P player. Playing one class exclusively is a bad idea, but this is an even worse idea.
---
In a game like Hearthstone, there will be times when a class just doesn't have much viability in the meta. On top of that, playing one class exclusively often prevents you from ever branching out to other classes in the future if you do decide to try something else because it often requires you to disenchant everything that isn't for that class no matter how good.
---
Should be a 7/7 here, real ones know.
---
You get a total of 22 packs as you rank from 50 to 25 and can only get them once.  And there isn't much of a reason to grind beyond 25 unless you can get to rank 5.
---
To quote from the wiki entry:
---
 Ranks 50 to 26 are exclusive to new players. New players start at rank 50 (*Brave Rooster*), and earn 3 [Classic](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Classic) [card packs](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack) upon reaching milestones at Rank 45, 40, 35, and 30. Upon reaching Rank 25, the player earns 2 Classic packs and 2 packs for each of the most recent four *Hearthstone* [expansions](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Expansion). 
---
 A player can choose to skip over the "new player" ranks and start at Rank 25, but then they will not get the associated card packs.
---
What about Artosis trying to execute his own Sylvana?
---
Combo Priest is arguably the best deck in the game right now and isn't hard to craft at 5k.  Why even bring up Highlander Mage unless you're specifically looking for an expensive deck to whine about?
---
I sent a request if you're still looking
---
I don't think *a specific* OTK should be core to a class identity.  Having a class that more often gets OTK's than other classes is good, imo.  It means players who like OTK can gravitate towards that class, although all classes should get OTK's some of the time.  Just like boardclears, all classes should have class-flavored boardclear options that come and go, but some classes should be more consistently better at making boardclear decks.
---
This is somewhat where my thinking was.  We've had all sorts of Priest decks over the years.  Previously, we had a lot of resurrect Priest style decks dropping those Obsidian Statues and then bringing them back.
---
And here's the thing- Priest can basically never have a basic rushdown style deck because that's what they're intended to be weak for.  Same reason Mages don't get big class minions, Hunters don't get healing, etc.  So they tend to need some sort of combo or control deck, and right now, I don't think control holds a candle to Warrior or will hold up to Druid.
---
He didn't get mated in 4 moves though. He almost won and he timed out. He was doing alright at it for a while, which I suspect pisses a bunch of people off. He was basically trying to play a poker game and a chess game at the same time and failed. If he succeeded people would be applauding him, but he failed. As long as it doesn't become a habit, I still think being upset about it is dumb as fuck.

Howdy, I got a sentence into your response and saw a personal attack, so I stopped reading. Enjoy your day!
---
Thanks for the heads up. I have more important things to do in my life like roping people in tavern brawl
---
If they called Seiko out for playing another game during his match, it would just spark a ton of anger onto Seiko for it, as we're seeing in the aftermath anyway except only people who are really paying attention know about it right now versus literally everyone who tuned in to the stream.
---
Given that Blizzard apparently gave Seiko an OK to do this, calling him out and sparking that outrage would be entirely unwarranted.
---
and he had asked for a schedule change. They should have just asked the players if they could change some of the match times around so that they didnt overlap. It feels like blizzard failed the community and the players on this one.
---
You aren't in a competition. That's the problem.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also roping because of thinking and figuring out what the best move is, is totally different from roping because you're doing something else.
---
Then play random garbage instead of spacing out turns and throwing. A funny rng deck still wins a few games but a combo deck just throwing away pieces never wins
---
Great! The reality of the situation is still the reality of the situation and you’re still wrong. Have a great day and please actually make sure you know what happened before talking about things :)
---
You're right.
---
What I do is, I keep every common and rare that I open. I never dust those because they just aren't worth enough. But I dust legendaries and some most epics if I know I'm not gonna be learning/playing that class anytime soon.
---
Just replying to say I'm still not reading your responses, keep sending them tho, I like the notifications, they make me feel popular
---
It reeks of unsportmanship of him and frankly he should just stick with one and give up on the other (the match that day).
---
I’m sorry this doesn’t give the players any benefit so we prob won’t fix it
---
Half the time they probably are roping because they're distracted. I rope more turns 1-3 than any other time because I forget I queued.
---
The perspective of why the casters didn't oust Seiko was the point of my reply, which was very much the topic. I simply used Dog as an example since he was the most well known for voicing his opinions on the current state of HS, the reply wasn't about him past the point of contract he had with streaming hearthstone, but boy is bringing up anything related to Dog a touchy subject for people apparently.
---
I don't think they are at fault for telling him he can't do what he wants to do. They aren't paying him like a job. They are giving him something like a stipend for participating in their tournament. If they can ban you from playing another game at the same time they should ban you from reading a book, watching TV, eating food, or hundreds of other activities. The wording seemed a little too loose to me though. I think something like "we highly discourage players from participating in other activities while playing tournament matches but it's not against the rules."

Would be better with some tempo, discover AND summon that minion. Or discover and reduce cost to 0 that way you get the battlecry of the discovered minion

Elise sucks in Arena, Reno x2 is SO much better.
---
Hunter having strong 1 drop beasts is just a recurring fact of life.
---
Did you read the source? They're response was that doing both at the same time sounds difficult but he's welcome to try
---
I think the problem is making a card game *enjoyable to watch* at the professional level.
---
Look at poker. You can play casually or professionally and it works pretty well both ways. But at the highest level, you just can’t play a best of five hands and declare a winner. It’s too random at that scale. You have to play for hours over hundreds of hands for the most skilled players to rise.
---
The best Hearthstone player in the world might be like 55-45 over an average pro. Even I would probably take 35% of games off Hunterace. But I’m gonna win a solid 0% of games against a top Fortnite player. So you just can’t have a format that finds the best player, while also being watchable in a short amount of time. Other card games like Magic have this problem too.
---
[[Crazed Alchemist]] is also classic....

Lol blizzard literally gave him the ok to do this. He asked them before hand. Given that they gave him permission I'd imagine punishing him isnt what they're gonna di
---
cabal is so in right now
---
I know but he original won’t work cause you might have 2 other new Reno’s in your deck
---
No it doesn't
---
Also, loatheb was in the first expansion. Eater of Secrets was always a card they printed because the community complained about there not being a secret safety valve outside of hunter and for no other reason.
---
Ok, this really puts it into a different light. 
---
Obviously, if Blizzard themselves allowed it I can understand why he tried to keep his chances in both tournaments.
---
So, then really it’s mostly a screwup from Blizzard, creating such fantastic marketing value to AutoChess on their own channel... true professionals.
---
There are a few baseline nuts decks that you can try and pick up. One is duplatransmogrifier (make all minions in your deck a copy of a minion) on pogo hopper. Another is just big minions and robes of gaudiness (your cards cost half, but you can only play two each turn).
---
People fail to recognize that Priest's Hero power uniquely synergizes with high health (and thus low attack), sticky minions that have the goal of establishing board control and suffocating the opponent. You see this play out repeatedly in Arena, where neutral stat dumps + steal effects + strong AoE define the class identity much better than it usually happens in Standard (because steal effects and stat dumps are usually inefficient at winning against the field).
---
Divine Spirit gives a win-condition that, if you had to design the game from scratch, would probably emerge as the natural consequence of the way the hero power works. Similarly, Mage, just by virtue of its hero power, is given 2 directions to take games in - burn and control, while Warrior is usually relegated to control.
---
You also see attempts at breaking these "restrictions" for classes in cards like Conjurer's Calling -  which are usually among the most hated cards when they are meta because they give the class something it should not have.
---
Combo activators. I see this as an absolute win.
---
I like your wish... I think I will TAKE IT!
---
WeirdChamp
---
He did attempt to sort his priorities, he asked Blizzard to reschedule but they said no. If he didn't misplay I doubt any of this conflict would be happening.
---
I'm sure everyone knows this already, but as of right now, hearthstone is a game where 90% of wins come from luck. You drew zephrys when yoy needed it? Congrats, you won. Oh, you couldn't draw boom fast enough? GG! You couln't draw single oasis surger by turn 5? Sorry, GG! Of course there are ways to try to combat this, but its still very uncontrollable, and these scenarios are not even that uncommon.
---
Maybe they feel like their choices don't matter, and hence start slacking. I personally don't even give a rat's ass anymore, even in arena, usually playing some other game on the side.
---
You can make a combo priest reasonably cheaply.
---
"Not allowed?"  Commentators are there to provide context to the viewing audience.  There has been a lot of bad play at GMs this season and it's completely withing their realm to point it out.  Imagine watching an NFL game where a QB is playing Fornite on his phone while the coach is talking and he blows the play.  Do you think the commentators wouldn't point it out and call him on it?  Of course they would.
---
Knights of the Frozen Throne: If this doesn't appear in your list, go to the battle.net shop and get it there. It's free. Gives some cards, including a free legendary, but they're in Wild now (so either dust or play Wild). Similar style to the old adventures, but a little more difficult as it wasn't a "Must Play" for cards.
---
Dungeon Run, Monster Hunt and Rumble Run: Free, nothing much in the way of rewards. All of a similar style, i.e. runs where you build up the deck through the encounters.
---
Puzzle Lab: I'm not sure if this still works, as it got affected by nerfs and I don't know if they fixed it. Very much a one-time play, with interesting puzzles such as how to clear a board, get lethal etc. Free, nothing much as rewards.
---
Dalaran Heist: Similar in structure to the Runs, but a lot more to it, with a lot of replayability. Packs as rewards, plus a fairly useless legendary if you complete all five wings. First wing is is free, the rest cost gold or real money. Not cost-effective just for the packs, but if you enjoy the game play definitely worth it.
---
The one that comes out next week is expected to be similar to Heist, with some new twists. Again, first wing is free, it rewards with packs, and you need to pay for the three remaining wings. (Final Encounter is free after the fourth wing).
---
Do you see talkshow guests play on their phones? No, because they can control their impulses for a couple minutes and know it's fucking disrespectful to the host as well as the audience.

No, let's definitely gatekeep chess because those are literally two different games
---
Basketball is not Baseball because they have balls
---
I suspect they are doing it on purpose every once in a while. They push something ultimately crap to wild to motivate people to play standard. -&gt;spend more money to keep competitive.
---
They wait until everyone is mad about it, and everyone who is willing to play standard migrates over there and then they fix the issue. And start the cycle again
---
That's not gatekeeping. Gatekeeping is when a member of a community tries to keep others out of their community. Nobody said "autochess players aren't welcome in chess." And yeah, chess is the better game. There's no serious comparison here.
---
Nope, it was a pretty fair fight, in the end I had like 7 power and he was at 2 then conceded
---
I'm probably in the minority here but I do not see a lot of wrong with it.
---
He played another game while playing HS and lost.
---
What an absolute arrogant cunt. Needs a slap.
---
And how many of these stay above 50% because they get wins off of rogue?
---
The difference between hunter and rog is 8%+ which is insane.
---
My first advice is choose a class and get that class to a high enough level so you can travel brawl. Tavern brawl gives a pack a week for free as a minimum.
---
Personally I rotate quests every day unTIL it’s on my class I’m currently playing with. But daily quests are the best source of income for buying packs as another ftp player (I’ve been ftp for 5 years). 
---
Keep it simple for now in terms of decks, craft cards and dust what you don’t need. Google budget deck ideas for your class and after a while you will find you can branch into others. 
---
Which quest did you get?
---
I just started too. I built one of OldGuardian’s budget decks and it was totally worth it. Have fun!
---
If they are nothing without it, they shouldnt have it.
---
-Blizzard
---
Yeah! I don't see any reason for this shitstorm.

Its a fkn murloc shaman still. Stop flexing your deck building skills until you actually build an original deck.

Blizzard *consistently* makes terrible competitive games and then tries to create an esports scene by throwing money at it. But much like each new iteration of Smash, nobody is watching because it's a good competitive game to watch. They're watching because it's new, shiny, and trending. The melee scene is still hanging on because that game has competitive merit. But a game like Smash 4? That "competitive scene" died *the very instant* Smash Ultimate came out. And the same will be true of Ultimate whenever Brawl #4 comes out. 
---
The main difference, though, is that Sakurai is very blatant about how he doesn't want Smash to be competitive. That's his intentional design decision. Blizzard simply *doesn't understand what makes a game a good esport* no matter how many times they try.

I was referring to the lack of proof gor a popularcall for punishment. Lol
---
Nah, it's more like a class being broken for a rotation and then getting a lot of shitty cards because of the strong cards before goin "This class has too many bad cards so let's give them stronger cards" and then the next Deathstalker rexxar is born repeating the cycle. I don't want everything to be strong, I want them to settle down for a single direction for classes and given them something playable that works with the rest of the deck, not random cards that don't work in conjunction with one another getting something to use as a clutch. This isn't the binding of isaac where watering down the item pools is a genuine excuse for the item being bad
---
Made of broccoli
---
Because hearthstone is not a skill  based game.  Very much in the game depends on the randomness. The problem is that players adapt very quickly to the meta game. Nothing else matters. You know what cards an opponent plays, you can assume that in his hand and all.
---
Sometimes grandmasters get worried or just upset about failure and therefore make mistakes.
---
What does that mean sir no legos
---
So, it sounds like autochess rounds can end up in draws. That brings up the issue of multiple rounds where no one loses life. Now, how is it a poor design to allow for ties then? Clearly a tie should happen if neither player can win in a reasonable manner. It's the standard of all games.
---
When you hit rank 25, you can start playing wild, and be inspired by all the funky decks you're going to play against.

Some very expensive, some incredibly cheap, a lot of different stuff until you realise : This is the deck I really wanna play.
---
Make friends. Your friends can let you borrow their decks in friendly matches, so you can try before you craft.
---
Heck if you're playing EU you can even add me. Yadeehoo#2492
---
I'm a math engineer and you bored me to death in your first sentence.
---
This actually surprised me cuz I'm still having a decent success with the face rogue deck around rank 3
---
If seiko won his games and won the autochess game we’d all be talking about what a god he is.
---
People are definitely overreacting to this because they want something to rage about.
---
Think Aluneth on steroids
---
True, it's not crazy to think you can play both at the same time. I imagine even I could do that, and I've never even played auto chess. 
---
What IS crazy is to think you can play both professionally, at the highest level, at the same time. 
---
The problem isn't that he played two games at the same time. It is that he did so during a tournament (TWO tournaments, even). At a tournament you're supposed to try and perform at your highest level, and stunts like this are the opposite of that.

Kripp talked about "treasure cards". 
---
We'd get a new one (or several) each month to keep the meta fresh.
---
I do among my friends because its obvious what we are referring to.  I certainly wouldn't refer to Auto Chess as Chess on a random subreddit though.
---
And it was on that fateful day that any druid deck not aggro or token was severely neutered. Bring back Wild Growth Blizzard, you cowards.
---
Ya you're right. I had clarified that possiblity in another comment.
---
Yes im just happy i have 1 "lego" and 2 gold pack because I'm new haha
---
One in a trillion, you are the one, Neo
---
Well, blizz needs to give priest a proper basic and classic set and then they can HoF. Currently it has like 4 themes none of which is functional
---
Ok
---
Given that he apparently asked them about it beforehand, I don't think Blizzard can really do that anymore. If they didn't stop him  when he asked if he could do it, they have no real rights to punish him for doing something they previously said he was allowed to do.
---
Please don't confuse Blizzard's PR statement with actual truth.    
---
Blizzard said exactly to Seiko that it was OK for him to play both games at the same time.  This is Blizzard's error.   Their PR statement is worded to make Blizzard look better, but they absolutely gave Seiko permission to play both games, when Seiko asked to resschedule so he wouldn't have to play both at the same time.  Blizzard messed up, and won't admit that publicly.
---
This player asked for permission to do this and the organisers said he could try if he wants to. Stop feeding this trend where you jump on the hate bandwagon before getting facts straight. https://mobile.twitter.com/WickedGood/status/1172986462683500545
---
I counter rope to assert dominance
---
I can't believe this thread. It's witch hunt 101. Stop blaming the individual for the fault of the organisation. He asked permission and the response said he could do it. https://mobile.twitter.com/WickedGood/status/1172986462683500545
---
this is what happends when you turn a RNG dependent game in to a e-sport, there is barely any skill involved its all about drawing the right cards at the right time and using 2% of your brain to not play them in the wrong order.
---
people wont take it seriously and that includes these so called "pro" players, but i agree they should be putting a bit more effort in to their play since they have a really comfortable job in a line of work that very very little people get a chance to actually go for.
---
use your spot in the spotlight wisely or surrender it to somebody who is willing to use their time in the pro scene better.
---
but i will never see hearthstone as a skilled game because it simply isnt, get the wrong cards at the start of the game can just kill the match for you and its completely out of your hands, this is a rng game not a skill game.
---
Today I hit myself in the dick with a hammer. I wondered why this happened then I realized I was holding a hammer in my hand and hitting myself in the dick with it. So if you hit yourself in the dick with a hammer make sure you are not holding a hammer in your hand and hitting your dick with it.
---
I don't think you missed any, you get a message in twitch if you get one
---
Yeah, autochess is fun. Chess is thousands of years old and boring. That's what you're saying right? Yeah, we're saying the same thing.
---
Phoenix was also bonkers when GRN was released.
---
no, understanding does not equal agreement wtf are you stupid
---
AFAIK you should be reinstalling Hearthstone instead of updating because it has some fuck-up that doesn't overwrite the existing data.
---
As long as I get my tasty packs I'm good.
---
A game where the world champion can become champion by pure luck shouldn't have a pro scenario anyway, sure you can be good at the game, but the amount of rng in hearthstone is beyond ridiculous, a healthy card game should only have card draw as randomness, not cards like Box of Yogg that can make a complete 180 in a game that seemed lost.
---
Also winrates at diffrent ranks. A budget midrange hunter can do well at low ranks but wont get you to legend.
---
Isn’t it great then? That people feel like they outskilled you? That’s means they are enjoying the game which is great design! Who cares if they have the illusion of skill, good for them. You are just hating of highlander decks because you don’t like playing them, let others have their fun.
---
Non highlander decks running zephyrs is a more controversial issue which I believe is absolutely fine, it’s a high pay off card that only activates once all the duplicates are gone. It’s also quite difficult to use to make the best plays of course there is obvious plays with zephyrs but overall there are other cards that were so much worse for the game, like keleseth and Genn/Baku which aren’t even comparable to zephyrs.
---
Wotc thinking? Good one
---
Archmage, openwaygate...next turn (with only him on board) the 4 mana make copy of friendly minion..then drakkaro guy and the 4/3 hero is immune during ur turn..makes ur opponent draw 16 cards
---
Where's the Limerick voting thread?
---
I have a deck where i run stonetusk boars and southsea deckhand with handbuff paladin and when you get to buff them with val'anyr its a lotta damage. You can also draw those cards with the 1 mana spell forgot its name.
---
push the button to get the dust to build a cheap meta deck or a servicable budget deck (something like zoo warlock and midrange hunter). use it to climb to higher ranks. the gold you get with the climb is a good resource, and when you hit rank twenty you get monnthly rewards the higher you climb. getting a reliable deck early on is important to expand your collection, so don't hesitate to spend dust on useful commons and rares, especially if they are in the classic set. whizbang will rotate out at the end of march so maybe craft a more reliable legendary, like leeroy jenkins, who will always be relevant, or maybe craft a nice package of synergizing cards, like the classic murloc package.
---
When dusting, dust your extras first, and of those, the golden ones. Don't disenchant everything you have. Maybe the bad cards, if you really need the dust. 
---
As for playing, take your time to think every turn through and always make your strongest play unless you know you will get punished for it. Hasty play and overly hesitant play can cost games even for experienced players.
---
it objectively doesnt have more replayability, whether it's more fun is your opinion though
---
Filling board is arguably even more powerful. If it summons even just 1/1s then that's 14/14 worth of stats turn 3 over 7 bodies in the class that has savage roar
---
6 put of 9? Thats fucking 66% . 66% of the game is playable WHAT A JOKE
---
Why are so many of you aspies in here raging about this. Calm down.
---
Best meta yet for me. I din’t understand all the hate on this sub.
---
Nutty
---
It changes absolutely nothing.
---
Ask yourself, if you're competing in a tourney that's being broadcast, is it a good idea to compete in another tourney at the same time?
---
But then what will people be outraged about?
---
I’m not sure how to respond to this considering Boar did explain pretty well why we should hate on blizzard for someone else’s mistake. Can you please elaborate.
---
They do know dude. They’re not going to let wild dictate what they can make. That would kill creativity, and their options for new cards would go down the drain, and the entire point of wild would be fucking destroyed.
---
Deckhand is a 2/1 though. They can be drawn with [[Salhet's Pride]] though

Just last match, I beat a mcthun warlock using his own mcthun.

Lol that was fun.

As someone whose dust was entirely in Mage and Rogue I'm just pretty salty about how this year has turned out.
---
No. The text combo absolutely works without it
---
Tempo warrior is outrageous. Had a 80+% wr with it from 25 to 10. How much dust do you have and do you have snip snap. Just want to try and make a list for you
---
Too hard to use for casual players. I play the game every day and still sometimes I forget what cards are in Classic whatnot when using Zeph. To use this card well, you'll need to remember all the expansion legendaries or check it up online.

Personally I think the bottom line is, you shouldn't get expected to be payed for something which you've clearly half assed. Going to a professional tournament, and not providing your competitive experience which you're expected to portray, is like ordering a beer at a bar and only getting half a glass. Should you pay for the beer? Sure, but full price? I don't think so. 
---
It's fine if a professional player is having a bad day  and not playing their best as result, but is clearly not just "a bad day". This is someone intentionally jeopardizing their own competitive ability at the attempt to do two things at the same time.
---
I think he is just pointing out how there is nice representation across all classes.
---
TL;DR: Generic apology and BoarControl protecting him
---
(Even other players' games)
---
Reddit should HOF these types of stupid shitposts
---
You can go with the lower curve version that tops off with leeroy. From experience, it's better than the list that tops out at grom. From memory leeroy is the only legendary and the epics are bloodsworn Merc, livewire lance and town crier. It's a fairly cheap and powerful deck
---
If it's possible for someone to take a tournament lightly and still qualify for it then it says more about the tournament than the player.
---
Also, to the people complaining about "pros": there are basically no professional competitors in Hearthstone. Nobody makes a living *competing* in Hearthstone. The only people making a living out of Hearthstone are streamers and casters, aka entertainers.
---
Just because it's not breking rules doesn't mean it's okay. This is common sense. It was extremely stupid of him to do that and it's also extremely stupid on Hearthstone's side to not do anything about it
---
Tirion is "the perfect 8 mana tempo card". Whenever you are at 10, play Zephrys, and dont have too much going on in the board to take all 3 options, Tirion gets offered as a tempo play. If you cant play it this turn, sometimes Ysera gets offered instead.
---
Alright thx
---
Add some stampeding kodo shenanigans
---
If you're talking about going infinite with Undatakah, I didn't know that was in Quest Paladin nor was it necessary. It's my understanding that the Undatakah is simply used for extra gas by cloning yourself some more Mechano Eggs and Whelps.
---
I don't understand what your point is. Studies aren't applied to anywhere close to 100% of a population either.
---
Just get lucky

The Nut is gonna be busted

Oh thank you very much

and by dupe I mean look at old adventures 700 gold for a solo adventure + 1 guaranteed legendaries and new cards lol now if we compare that to this are they not duping??
---
Omega + LuL
---
This is exactly the place to brag, the fact that it's chillwind makes.it even better and the fact that it's against a demonlock makes it VERY SATISFYING lmfao
---
Do something nutty
---
Eww, wild
---
I think it's okay if he printed it for himself, but selling them is a different story

That's not necessarily true if you're looking at Highlander Zoo, Tempo Warrior, or Paladin, though.

wow that's nuts

Shuffle 5 nuts into your deck.
---
Duplicate all cards in deck.
---
Remove all duplicates from both decks.
---
Give your opponent a nut.
---
Fill your hand with 1 1 squirrels. 
---
Turn all minions on the board into squirrels.
---
Transform 5 minions in each deck into nut-generating squirrels.
---
I'm sure there are better things to do at 3:30 in the morning than repost that your extremely unoriginal deck made it onto a website that no one frequents, all the while being a smug dick about it.
---
"Who goes thar?" - " **I'm** in charrrge now!"

Miracle rogue is my favourite deck in the history of HS and now it’s been nerfed so many tines that it’s totally unplayable even in wild. But I can still use my golden valeera to mindlessly hit people in the face with weapons and charge minions and concede if they play a taunt or any healing so I guess that something.

---
Zephrys and my failing brain.
---
Really enjoyed your editing, even if it was just a ton of cuts. That Molten Giant combo was 2spicy
---
I feel the same way but it’s not worth a reddit post. It’s a tier 2 deck so even if it’s unfun it’s not as bad as it could be and it’s easily beatable. Just figure it out
---
If you draw one Reno there are no duplicates
---
At least they still took damage so you could put them to 1 to die to fatigue next turn or remove the secret with some cards. This is more 0 skill than ice block, just buys a free turn to finish your otk or find removal. I know it didn't matter here but it just annoys me they made this card idk
---
Saying you will continue to action doesn't change the fact that this combo is dangerously buggy.  The game is balanced around animation length and that is fundamentally abusable.  Will you change snip snap? Change echo? Change summoning portal's functionality?
---
Without a mention of a meaningful preventative fix, this information is next to useless, and really discourages me from bothering to keep playing wild.  And I don't play standard, so I guess I'll just be playing Dota Underlords instead.
---
&gt; Dog, tyler and thijs used to play on 3 servers at the same time
---
The key point here is that they did not do this in an official tournament that was also broadcasted and commentated live. You can play HS blind with a bongo drum on your stream if you want, but doing this in an pro setting is just disrespectful to anyone involved.
---
I do get his predicament and dont think he should really get any further punishment, but it *was* a dick move.
---
Am I the only one who thinks if Seiko had won that game the narrative would be completely different?
---
"HE'S A GAMER GOD. JUST GIVE HIM THE ENTIRE PRIZW POOL. LUL BLIZZ GAME JOKE. STAFF LET HIM PLAY 2 GAMES AT ONCE LUL."
---
I'd like to give you gold sir
---
I think it comes with 16? Along with the legendary and card back that comes only with the pre-order.
---
the reason it has a limit is the animation.  Remove that and its just an APM-fest.
---
That is the core of this cheating method, getting around the animation, which usually leaves you with a snip snap of over 30 attack, but just barely.
---
20 dollars means 20 packs what's the point it gives na an average say 2500 dust (assuming u dust everything)  u can't craft shit with that unless u get lucky and get the good legendaries which is highly improbable
---
It makes you nut...s
---
Likewise for Dota 2, it could take months for a new player to really find and permanently own heroes they like. Starting off from nothing in any Free-to-play game is never an easy thing to do.
---
Granted, new players shouldn't even be playing decks like that anyway.

Mass disenchant only applies to extras that you have. You don't appear to have any extras otherwise it would be in that on the right in that strangely shaped indent.
---
For obvious reasons, there isn't a button that lets you automatically disenchant your entire collection.
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/hearthstone/23135673/twitch-drops-for-grandmasters-and-playoffs
---
no joking like 4/5 games i won bc of the boxes
---
Lol. Glad it worked out for u
---
You probably mulliganed it away, drew a new hand, and then drew the legendary as your first actual draw of the game on turn one.
---
If it's only a 1/30 chance, it should have happened on SOMEONE'S stream by now and we'd have actual evidence.  Now, you won't always get a legendary card in the mulligan, but if we assume that you mulligan away a one of once every 100 games, then there DEFINITELY should be video evidence by now.  Even if only 200 HS games were streamed in a day, there's only a 5% chance that it wouldn't happen every single day.   To put that in perspective, the odds of it not happening within a week would be 1 in 1 TRILLION.
---
And that's being generous with the estimates of mulliganing away one ofs and very generous with the amount of games played on stream being low.
---
and that grown-up man, had the foresight to ask the organizers in advance if his plans were acceptable or not. he got his answer. he moved forward.
---
Which one? The Highlander (Zephyr Wish) or the regular Aggro Warrior?
---
Grommash is not needed, but I'll be honest, he won me at least 10+% of the games. I once had damaged Grommash on board, the enemy wasn't able to kill it. I dropped 2 Bloodsworn... it was overkill, but if nobody survives 3 Grommash in face (except for Druid or Warrior).
---
And Grommash has been proven to be an important card in Warrior class for past 5 years.
---

---
If there only would be one tentacly card that can easily win vs any kind of secret deck
---
Hmmmmmm
---
have u seen caste play he plays as fast as possible everyone has different play styles that depends on them there's no 1 single way to success u have to find ur own way both in life and in hs

---
Who even cares? Seiko made a mistake and looked dumb on camera. That's the consequence. A player could stub their toe on a desk and be distracted by that, are we gonna bitch at blizzard to prevent that?
---
You can, if you run two Yetis, get the second yeti back if you toss the first.  If you toss both yetis you have no chance of getting them in your opening hand.  However, you DO have a chance of drawing it as your draw on turn 1.
---
Not really for this card but i realised there hasnt been much yet with board limitation.
---
Ie 4 Giant Nuts land on ether side of the board limiring both sides to play 3 minions max.
---
Not really a good fit/theme for this card but something similar could work well in say a druid deck.
---
Just kill Inner fire completely and add 5 mana 3 damage clear back to standard. They won't have to print board clear every expansion anymore and control priest may be alive yet again
---
Standard &gt; Wild &gt;&gt; Arena
---
Arena just isn't for me, though I'd play more if it couldn't give you something ending in 5 gold as a reward.
---
Look at bottle next to crafting, it means there are cards to mass disenchant.
---
Meh. It's my first month semi-seriously playing the ranked ladder and I just kept going "to see how it will turn out"
---
Turns out once both your underlight anglers are dead you just... don't get a lot of value against the Warpath, Shield Slam, Brawl, Plague of Wrath, Rushing mechs, etc
---
Finally I did it 😎💪🏻
---
I play Barnes...
---
Do you only get packs by watching Playoffs? Is it playoffs right now? 
---
(Sorry if I seem like a noob)
---
I hate you
---
I think azari is the easiest if u have decent removals and big minions. Removing two cards from ur deck doesn't really matter if u got good synergies
---
As if half the cards in r/customhearthstone got any real thought about the implications before they were posted. Nah, it's because he can get more karma if he posts to the bigger sub.
---
People saying its disrespectful to the sport and viewers and he needs to have further punishment need to check themselves...that is ridiculous. He made a misplay because of it and that's that. If you think I he owes you or the community in any way you are an entitled cancel culture sheep
---
It looks like he did actually hurt his hand. You can see his mouth open and this sort of surprised look on his face as the pain sets in right after the slam. That just made the whole situation worse for him. :/ sorry to see that happen, and I have definitely done that to myself a number of times too.
---
He's terrible. Went and found this thread because he's so damn grating in GM casting rn
---
What is chillwind? Chillwind yeti is different
---
Your opponent crafts nat pagle's until they're out of dust
---
shoukdve been never nerfed or nerfed and made most rogue spells cheaper for it. its like bladeffury either 4mana or no face dmg, but they did worst parts of both.
---
like yeah prep was a insane card but class was desinged and build around it. they had even said they had considered it for hof which they shouldve have done instead of nerfing.
---
Probably Octodad right? The reload could be a huge swing for you especially if you're in a top deck situation.
---
I don't like to focus my anger on any one specific person, and perhaps he's changed since then, but I still remember [this nice little passive-aggressive jab](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9mg4v1/vicious_syndicate_presents_meta_polarity_and_its/e7ek1tj/) he left on an article by Vicious Syndicate.
---
Wasn't cool, coming from one of the devs.
---
Cleric is really strong and probably limits disign space regarding draw.
---
Divine spirit+ inner fire just gets more and more ridiculous as time goes by.
---
Then they have a lot bad to really bad cards,like the recent radiance,or cards that just aged badly just like the control identity of the class based on its hero power without any actual evergreen boardclear apart from the auchenai+circle of healing combo.
---
Last time I had a deck with YPB, it won the game every time I was able to play it. It's a fun card to play
---
The Nut: Start playing Magic the Gathering with an Early of Squirrel in play.
---
Just like a dream card, but you don't get to pick what it is.
---
Yes you only get packs if you watch. If you go to the stream on Twitch, go below the video and if in green text it says Drops Enabled, you can get packs for watching. If the green text isn't there you cannot get pcks.
---
I'm upset
---
yeah and thats not even the wild only cards, vanish is so much worse aswell now,thistle tea was alreayd garbage,and for standard we got cannon barrage which already wasnt good when could cost 3(now cant even hooktusk +coin + prep barrage anymore) and sprint wasnt very good even with prep(only was usefull with prep outside a pinch when couldnt combo it and really need that draw.
---
Like so many are now unplayable now,and raiding party is what caused the issues in standard,shouldve just nerfed that(or made it not draw weapon but extra pirate or so on combo so its still draw 3 for 3 if comboed)
---
But it should still show the cards in the same slot for both players. Where would OP's opponent see the quest? In the left or right side of OP's hand?
---
The amalgam tavern brawl could be a new permanent game mode.
---
I would say the only good Un'Goro legendary to get off of Infinite Toki would be Tarim. You cannot get the quests because it's only minions, so thats more of a chance you get the garbage ones. Pyros isn't great, Tyrantus is a 10 mana 12/12, Dred isn't great, Lyra and Kalimos are situational, Mosh is sometimes okay, and Elise is good for some value. Based off of these, why would you ever pick Un'Goro over any other expansion, other than The Grand Tournament.
---
Good cards with end of turn or deathrattle effects would be somewhat worse
---
Dying? It was never alive in the first place.
---
Beautiful. I'd love to commission an art from Blizzard employee.
---
He tested this on stream a few days before actually - almost identical situation I believe
---
That looks fun!!!
---
Deck code please?
---
The 4 I had mentioned were the only ones that I remember basically being useless from the Elise pack, everything else was actually relatively good.
---
Most of the cards aren’t good enough to actually put in a deck, but if you get them from a random effect, suddenly they’re a lot better.

And yet, why do we see the same handful of players consistently near the top of most tournaments? They may not win every tournament, but their long-term performance is the best because they understand how to win over time. To say that skill is only 50-70% is ridiculous, it's much more than that when you look at the big picture, which is the only metric that matters. 
---
It's a lot like poker professionals - you don't have to win on a hand-by-hand basis to be the best. That's kind of the fundamental principals of *any* card game, and to say that makes it illegitimate is silly and setting an arbitrary boundary around what you want out of eSports vs what people actually take seriously as competitive games.
---
Example: in 2016, when I was a total noob to this game, I beat Kolento at rank 8 NA ladder. At the time, I thought that was the coolest thing in the world. But it didn't mean a goddamn thing to him. And if you were to just pick random ladder game and say "this is how we're going to evaluate competitive Hearthstone", and you picked that one, you could be legitimately upset because I just RNG'd over one of the best players in the world. But that's not how the competitive scene works, and there's a reason why Kolento is still one of the best in the world. Numbers matter, and it doesn't matter how many individual games you lose if you're winning much more. 
---
HS is not League and it is not Starcraft. Comparing them is pretty dumb. It's a game where long-term stats is *part of the game*, and if you don't like that and want the title of the best to be determined in a single grand finals set, then HS is not the game for you.
---
Yeah, but nobody knew he would be competing at both games at the same time. I think a compromise could've been reached.
---
That’s exactly how he expressed it. You can’t have been here if you think the outrage was anywhere near appropriate.
---
He lost the match before for being over confident and not clearing the board in time...
---
I would assume most leavers are just straight up frustrated and over the game. I know when I leave by closing the client, it's generally because "fuck this bullshit deck, fuck this opponent for playing it, fuck team 5 for making it, fuck Blizzard for making the hellscape casino, and fuck me most of all for playing it."
---
There ain't no log back in.
---
What?
---
I matched against AT LEAST 5 yesterday. Switched to Highlander Hunter and climbed to rank 3...
---
Does it really make sense though?
---
Zephrys decides for nova over twisting nether because he doesn't know whether the deathrattles matter or not. Why couldn't he simply offer both nether AND nova? Why does he offer two heals instead of 2 board clears?
---
Up to eight classes can have above 50% winrate if the ninth class is bad enough but still sees some play.

Lotta people here are discouraging dusting wild cards. I personally have done so and don't regret it, but I play pretty casually and don't care to compete with the ever-growing power level of wild. However, a middle ground between dusting them all and not could be to dust all of your golden wild cards to net you some nice dust but not leave you with no wild cards. You can sort by set in your collection and then type "golden" in the search bar to do so. Unfortunately you have to do it one set at a time and it could take a while depending on the size of your collection and whether you decide to dust all wild cards or just the goldens

Does anyone know how muxh do they pay GMs per game? Dog already said he makes more from streaming so it can't be that much. And let's be honest, in HS you need to be the luckier player to win a tournament. Thats why there are so many new faces in HS WC every year.
---
Can I play with you sometime?
---
Sure
---
Not Vs druid who has cards like hidden oasis and ferocious howl.
---
Highlander Hunter tends to play on their back foot against to decks faster than it like Token Druid or are capable of matching your mid-to-late game plays like Quest Paladin.
---
Quest Druid as a deck has an even match-up with Highlander Hunter or a somewhat bad match-up against it depending on who you ask.
---
If you want to beat Quest Druid more often, play something consistently more aggressive than Highlander Hunter, a deck that is aggressive leaning midrange at best, like Murloc Shaman.
---
This quest is still active.
---
Uh that 9th one is rogue and that is unacceptable
---
Why is the history bar empty?
---
Heroic one looks like scrapped cardback from E.V.I.L expansion, but they decided to put into this expansion we are in right now.
---
Players play a hearthstone subgame, using the remaining cards in their decks as their decks. Each player who doesn't win the subgame loses half their health, rounded up.
---
There are certainly a lot of possibilities in HS, but when any given turn has an infinite amount of possibilities it stops being competitive in my opinion. Can't think of a single game that has more impactful rng and more skewed matchups, and is still considered competitive.
---
Meanwhile Thijs gets 1 damage and loses with one damage off lethal :d
---
Cool! The game is still fucking unfun and expensive. What's your point for this post?
---
I mean, yes, as I said, the optimal deck is "tempo rogue, but slightly worse". Its essentially a deck you made worse by including the quest. Which is what JAlexanders deck seems to fall under. Its still pretty garbage because youre just playing worse tempo rogue, at which point the question becomes "why include the quest at all".
---
The data suggests otherwise.
---
Considering that he was literally one damage of lethal I can't say that it was a bad play
---
I only play Wild because I want to play with all the cards.  
---
Standard is boring, stale, not enough cards to play with.
---
how filthy this play wast*
---
rules for you but not for me.
---
I see your idea of "nuts" and raise you this:
---
'Change all minions' play sound to "prEpARE to FaCE the MIght of MiLLHouse MaNaStORM!!"'
---
It's an annoying bug, you're stuck with the class you last played.
---
&gt; there are too much cancer card
---
Such as?
---
Or SOME dragon archetype.  Sad that there hasn't been an effective one in the year of the dragon.
---
I usually didn't have much trouble with priest. Avoid littering your deck with bad cards is probably the best bet to start. Other than that, I always went with Dragon priest and did fine.
---
I consider mage to be the hardest without cheesing it.
---
Dragon Warrior is playable.
---
Turn one minion on each side into The Collector: eat a nut. After eating one of each nut Add Soul Collector to hand. All other minions become types of nuts. Each different but having and effect, lifesteal, reborn, windfury, etc.
---
Soul Collector: he runs in front of your opponents car, they die, you win. Squirrels are evil.
---
Whoa. My time has come.
---
Wild. Ironically I liked secret mage more when it was more burn cards and an underdog deck. I could rank up quick with it against most decks that didn't get a good start. I'm trying to figure out the right Even Warlock build for the meta at rank 9 because I'm really treading water against all the Reno Decks.
---
I haven't played Standard in a few months since I discovered Wild, and I have had crap luck with my packs from the newest set so I can't build many of the fun looking decks.
---
I like Arena, but I suck at it, so it's just more economical to use my gold and cash on packs.
---
I think people were fatigued from playing the same RoS deck of bomb warrior eventhough it is still quite good. I have matched against a couple of bomb warriors recently with my highlander hunter and felt absolutely neutered.
---
There’s no way you’d make this play if you hadn’t tested it before, as risking your entire game in Zephrys giving you what you need in a fairly vague situation is not gonna happen in a tournament setting. The practice and preparation put in really shows here.
---
Lots of the same combo deck showing up for priest.  Makes sense, if it works, why not play it?
---
Also wow that's a lot of Snipsnaps.
---
How am I the one getting downvoted? Do people on this sub understand basic math and logic?
---
He said blizzard ruined rogue based on op's ranking that states that rogue has 46.1% winrate.
---
On the exact same website, all rogue lists but 3 has above 50% winrate. For this to happen, it means the lists that have below 50% winrate must have too small a sample size. And this guy is arguing that even 400 games is not enough. How does that help his argument?
---
Aside from that, every single class has decks with even worse winrate. When you evaluate the strength of a class, you look at their strongest decks, not their weakest ones because there will always be people who play bad meme decks for fun.
---
It's not even about the downvotes. It bothers me how bad people are at arguing and interpretting these winrate stats and making these terrible conclusion.
---
&gt; I really want a thief priest core set lol
---
Oooh, that would bring a LOT of complaints, maybe more than the DS/IF combo.  Thief priest is one of those decks that people hate losing to.
---
Sort of like complaints about the 'discovered by' meta, but so much worse.
---
I meant that the best-performing version is literally tempo rogue with quest and 2 clever disguises. Tempo Rogue already played Vendetta. And if youre running underbelly fence and Tess, youre running the all-in quest version. Which performs significantly worse than the version Im talking about. And that specific all-in version is an easy tier 4 at best deck. Its the one that has losing matchups to everything.
---
Delicious delicious salt
---
&gt; Mind Control returned to 8 mana 
---
Iffy there.  Zephrys now gives you MC a lot, which could be an issue.
---
maybe 50/50 chance to be shuffled into your or your opponents hand.
