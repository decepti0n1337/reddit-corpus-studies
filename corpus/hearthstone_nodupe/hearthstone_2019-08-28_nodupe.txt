I always accept them. I got to be honest I‚Äôve had a pretty good success rate. Out of my 8, 3 of them have been really nice.
---

---
1 asked to play an 80 gold with him
---
2 told me I had a really nice deck. (It was a Murloc paladin list I created right before Murloc paladin took off. Like right before meanstreets of gadgetzan so it wasn‚Äôt very popular at the time.)
---
3 discussed about some crazy deck run for my dragon priest arena deck I built when Wild Arena was active. (Wild arena is so much fun Q_Q please bring it back Blizzard.)
---
Will miss the show but TBH he‚Äôs seemed disinterested for a long time. It was painful to listen to the Saviors of Uldum episode.. he just doesn‚Äôt know the cards at all.
---
I think it should at least give you the option and let you decide, there are a lot of situations where you would rather trigger the deathrattles than keep the enemy board state.
---
I remember that during the beta this was a rare case, you could pretty much add anyone and have fun.  
---
Now ppl are so salty even on casual that isn't worth the effort.
---
True there are other decks. But maybe he isnt a aggro player? Seems like the only viable choice in the meta is aggro or control warrior. Even the midrange decks are burn focused. Mage was a nice change of pace despite all the hate it got. So I can see why a lot of people wanted to spend there dust on something different.
---
I suppose it depends on whether you care that it is gold or not. If you don't care than the worst that happens is you need to spend the amount of dust you got from dusting it buying it back.
---
Yeah, remember they refused to preemptively remove Genn and Baku from Standard? Me either....

Noradz#11415 NA Looking to trade 80g quests and have a bo3 match or something while at it.
---
It was a completely unfun, polarizing, unhealthy card. Boom is too and I think they dropped the ball on that nerf. But dont get so upset because they nerfed your broken deck. Everybody knew it was gonna happen. Imagine if theyd nerfed it to 6 and it would still be broken. Then the meta wouldve stayed the same post nerfs and that would have been horrible for the meta.

Can I make it to legend playing token druid? I've managed to get to rank 8 this time (first attempt) but find it's getting tougher and tougher each level. I'm guessing a lot of that's down to my skill/decision making, but some down to my incomplete deck, which I'm adding to as and when I can. But yeah, is it possible to go all the way just playing this deck?

not really it isnt really ai it just a series of if and then commands. If enemy has a weapon then give ooze. If 4 or more minions on board give savage roar. If turn 8 or higher give tirion.
---
Paladin has one mechanic for reflecting damage that's playable in multiplayer: \[Eye for an Eye\].
---
I don't know how new you are to the game, so you may know this already - but if your game plan is to sacrifice your hero's health to gain an advantage, you're best off looking into Warlock, which has cards like \[Neferset Thrasher\].
---
Pass all that sage wisdom on to someone who isn‚Äôt done with the game forever. I did save gold, I did disenchant cards I wasn‚Äôt interested in, I waited until streamers and pros told me what to craft. With a combination of the cards I opened and a few I crafted I built four decks: Cyclone Mage, Freeze Mage, Highlander and Big Mage. Staying in one class with a lot of shared cards let me conserve dust. Now all those decks are tier four or worse and I can either start hoarding gold all over again or say fuck it and move on with my life rather than face disappointment again. Yes, I could spend money as a shortcut, but why bother? Leaving this game is easier especially considering how toxic this community is when Blizzard is criticized.
---
More than Mech Hunter because that deck is easy as hell, but overall Hunter is just super easy compared to most.
---
Or I could do literally anything else
---
How your legend rank appears to the other player has been broken all expansion.
---
Hm yeah probably. Depends on the flavor of the card I guess, but functionally there's barely a difference.
---
And I'm grateful to Blizzard for bringing all this headache on to themselves in order to give us something awesome. Just a reminder that good old Blizzard is still in there somewhere.
---
Why?
---
Why though?
---
You should run Octosari for the memes. It's been doing pretty decent for me, but I doubt it's optimal.

I wrote this new one with a blatantly pornographic link so the mods would ban me. Would someone please wake them up already?
---
&gt;I did disenchant cards I wasn‚Äôt interested in
---
Not what I said.
---
&gt;I waited until streamers and pros told me what to craft. 
---
Cost is no issue to streamers and pros. They don't have to worry about resource management at all.
---
&gt;Staying in one class with a lot of shared cards let me conserve dust. 
---
You put all your eggs in one basket. That's a terrible decision.
---
&gt;Leaving this game is easier especially considering how toxic this community is when Blizzard is criticized.
---
This community criticizes Blizzard almost constantly. If anything, it's the other way around where people will often downvote you for suggesting things like the cost of the game is fine.
---
But zeph just knows that your opponent gets a deathrattle, which does something, likely good for him.  Zeph doesn't know that the deathrattle is 3 1/3 taunts.
---
Something something eggs in one basket.
---
So everybody else is right. That‚Äôs my advice, don‚Äôt be stubborn about it and consider it instead.
---
So I shouldn‚Äôt spend money but I should diversify into all the classes without using dust to craft cards in those classes?
---
This is hearthstone's spaghetti code we're talking about. You change one thing somewhere and the house comes crumbling down. It can easily bug out
---
Pretty much. There's no reason a F2P player can't eventually spread out into other classes. Pigeon-holing yourself into one class is a terrible idea for multiple reasons, your situation being the most obvious.
---
At least they weren't replaced with suction cups.
---
Great job! What was your strategy for improving so quickly?

---
It sounds like yours is a little more beast synergy orientated which might be the correct way to go. I know its seems silly to not run hyena in a deck like this but thats the way i decided to build it. Maybe you can share your deck code?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And for sure bro same here. I've been a hunter enthusiast since the beginning of hearthstone. If you want to add me on BNet my tag is Oddler#11353
---
And thus the complete lack of proof. Nice troll.
---
doesnt matter
---
at its face value and cost: no.
---
when combined with prismatic lens ot cheat it out: quite likely
---
When you have something that is overused, it starts to become a gimmick.
---
When you have something, like early days discover, it was a tool. You would use a card to try and find an answer.
---
I am being entirely subjective. But when you have something like Rogue spawning cards from every class with every single card they played, it is no longer a tool. It is just a "oh here we go" as I roll my eyes. 
---
There's not really a quantifiable way to determine the two, because some might see something as a gimmick while others think it is a tool.
---
Joust is a good example. It was a gimmick.
---
Echo - I would argue, is more of a tool. Flood a board, or clear a board. You use it when you can maximize what it can do. Therefore a tool.
---
Thanks for the decklist nerd. \^\_\^
---
quest druid plays  a decent amount of high cost spells but cant play them all at once since your waitng for the added value of tear.
---
plus with druid's overall  mana manipulatino cards you can get an early phaoris while holding the big spells
---
And if it‚Äôs a KotFT pack, you have a good chance of getting a legendary in the first 10 if you haven‚Äôt opened any yet.
---
No idea tbh. I don't think I ever saw him really, as I don't play wild.

dude... sometimes you just need like 11 upvotes to get to main page of this sub. it's not a big deal. and nobody gains/loses anything when something reaches there.

It‚Äôs basically my own adaptation of the aggro Arcanite Reaper warrior from vicious syndicate. I firstly cut 1 wasp for ziliax because this helped a lot against Combo priest and wasp didn‚Äôt feel to great for me either. Only really good against murloc decks. The closer I got to legend the more control decks I faced so I decided to cut second wasp for card draw. To have more juice in the late game. I tried octasari over battle rage and it works great. 83% winrate from 16 to 4. overall winrate with this deck is 62% for me.

I like cards that discover from within your deck.  Then it's way easier to predict what they got, and it's easier to predict the power level.
---
Overall, I think discover cards are generally undercosted though.  Omega Assembly, the most obvious example.  Or Vulpera Scoundrel, the discover effect is priced at ~1 mana, and that's too cheap.
---
I have 66k dust so no issue for me...
---
So, even if we assume to be 50/50, the opinion in the link stills wrong.
---
Craft a golden quest then? This is nothing new. Whenever you get a different hero power from Finley, Justicar, and all other cards that change your hero power, it is only ever golden if the card that changes your hero power is golden.
---
Because Flame Elemental looks too cute to die to TN
---
Otk mage is exodia?
---
Random 2-mana spell. Limits what you can get but also makes it more predictable while not limited to your class - mirror the minion summon lackey.
---
What deck?
---
When you say switch...what exactly is preventing you from playing both formats? Just keep it balanced and play both, you will see what you like and where you want to spend more time. Playing one format doesn't mean you are done with the other lol.
---
Hmmm. This is like Tsaritsino park in Moscow
---
2 things confuse me about this list. 1) only 4x 1 attack minions with 2x crystallogy presumably means a decent amount of the time crystallogy is dead card? 2) no Finley?
---
Always perplexed by the "if it's broke but I don't care, don't fix it" mentality, served with a side of 0 arguments. Why even comment...
---
Only *argument* Blizz gives is they're afraid of making a boring, frustrating deck strong, as if Freeze Mage with **board** freezes hasn't been a thing.
---
Had we been accustomed to actual balancing like that in other Blizzard games, we'd see unplayable archetypes for what they are. Failures on the devs' side, a waste of gameplay possibility. Unless expansions with lots of unplayable content is great game design.
---
This board is so hilariously hail corporate I can't believe it. I didn't craft a single mage card, but it has always been obvious to me that big time meta nerfs should be accompanied with refunds on crucial cards that fit into the same deck. 
---
The game is already absurdly impressive. It's not good for someone to craft a deck and then be unable to play a meta deck for several months after it's been nerfed.
---
That is actually not bad since you mostly cast it when you are losing anyway. I tend to use it as last resort spell which either saves my game or loses the already lost game.
---
This is what makes the game fun and interesting to people tho. If the random effects didn't exist, all the games would be same and ppl would get bored pretty quickly. If complaining about RNG, heck you could also insist on making a set order of draws because "it's not fun when your opponent topdecks lethal at 1 health". The truth is people just don't like to lose and I get it, everyone wants to win. We all just need to realise that HS is a game and games are created so that people can have fun.
---
They mostly do this with cards that have basic effects, like Taunt and Poisonous, and even then they tend to end up as pack filler. They wouldn't reprint a Moorabi or even Icehowl.
---
Where can we find the results ? I followed the stream the first couple of hours, but I can't manage to check how it ended.
---
Griftah is the biggest
---
Nice man. If you don't mind me asking, how often does the quest play a part in winning games?  Because in my experience, the quest can take so long to finish, and by the time its over, you usually win through other means.  But this was before the nerf, so perhaps the quest hero power is stronger now in your experience?
---
Yea, you're right, forgot about that, they're different because they upgrade, that was a bad example. Straight up replacement effects are dependent on the card used.
---
Hmm. I've been running cult master in quest hunter but now I wonder is it worth swapping it for a cauldron. Hmmm, interesting.
---
I would give it a couple more days before the data is at all meaningful or accurate.
---
Anybody is capable of spamming an easy deck at the start of the season, which will place you in top 500.
---
Legend I guess. Current ranked system pushes everyone to rank 5 regardless. So if you're actually capable of winning consistently, you'll hit it.
---
It's mediocre.
---
You're right, prismatic lens is some major BS, too, but only in combination with tip the scales.
---
It's a huge difference though between having a board full of small frogs or a board full of Kalecgos, Tortollan ... etc, etc.
---
Hir'eek! grant me ~~wi...~~ **POWER. INCARNATE!**
---
I only checked for legend ranks
---
People have been saying (something like) this since babbling book was released.
---
A big factor in arena success is whether the game offers you powerful cards or not. 
---
If you have a run where the game offers you the choice of 3 awful, truely unplayable, cards then that's a massive handicap. If you get that more than once then forget making double digit wins.
---
Congrats on making 12 wins, especially so quickly. You played well but, luck was also a factor.
---
Legend is harder mostly because it takes much longer, every game you lose is another you have to win which means it can be demoralising. Also you have to understand the metagame and learn all your matchups.
---
I forgot to play
---
It's not really comparable. If you play enough Arena, you will hit 12 wins occasionally regardless of skill. But it's harder to sit down and say "I'll get 12 wins now" than it is to do a Legend run.
---
I have about 6700 Priest wins and I only play Priest except for daily quests.
---
I just press the button. If your time is valueless, go ahead and spend it manually searching through your collection and choosing what to disenchant, one at a time, so that you might make some extremely small amount of extra dust on nerfs.
---
I murder every single murloc I see in WoW classic now, I've never felt that level of hatred against murlocs before HS.
---
Much harder. There are instances where you can get really lucky in Arena and steamroll with an objectively OP deck. I don't play much arena, so there can't be any talk about consistency and I definitely experienced this and got 12 wins.
---
In Ranked, no matter the RNG, no matter your luck, you simply have to be consistent, time-invested and grind it down. Regardless if wild or standard.
---
I don't like priest for that reason
---
The brawl isn't over yet, this is the last day.
---
ITT: everyone pluggin their favorite HS podcast
---
Big Well Met fan btw.
---
I got 4 commons and 1 rare so... not really
---
The standard way is that the sum of the opposite sides equals seven. (1+6, 2+5, 3+4) But this misplacement fits the theme of everything being random in Hearthstone. So, I'm O.K. with it.
---
Nerubian egg would also still be good in a lot of decks I think
---
The perks of only playing one class I guess..
---
Mana Wyrm then coin into mirror image... That was the dream
---
I'm not saying getting to rank 4 is bad, just that from a stats perspective people will get these runs and they only really mean something at higher ranks otherwise me and my grandma would spam these poste every two hours. I know that spamming post like this will get you hate so here is me educating me you. Also its since I think its safe to assument that the regular even shaman would be build with thunderheards as of now. So you are promitign bad lists on to off beaing a noob winrage poster.

This is why I don't craft the deck. Prismatic Lens is a very abusable card and I am sure it will get nerfed one day. It would suck to waste my dust and get my deck crippled.
---
Aggro Decks want Tempo -&gt; So going first is better.  
---
Controll Decks just wanna react and going second helps with fatique
---
It still is a pretty good turn 1 play on arena
---
I think control Warrior likes the coin because the deck has weak turns 2 and 3 and the coin helps a lot to smooth out the early game and going first isn't that important because you don't really need the initiative.
---
This is our town, SCRUB.
---
Can't wait for 'Classic' Hearthstone.
---
I think it would be in a bunch at best.
---
It would probably make it into Highlander lists, but besides those most decks either don't want 5 drops or they want very specific ones for synergies.
---
Well, that's really the only choice, yeah.
---
But no attack... 
---
Um... 
---
He had other minions. 
---
Stop with your logic.
---
yea but this is new otk combo [https://youtu.be/hxLp9WSthEM](https://youtu.be/hxLp9WSthEM)

Trading 80g quests, I'll show but you go first.
---
And? You clearly dont know what hes talking about.
---
coin into double dust devil is what i thought was broken turn 1.. before learning they basicly killed your turn 2
---
Embrace your cleanliness... Gorge your sponge...
---
That‚Äôs how op he is lmao
---
It probably depends on the deck. Control decks usually don't care about initiative so going first has less value and the extra card means that you have an extra draw to find answers.
---
CW doesn't have a lot of good t2 and t3 plays so the coin can smooth out the early game a bit and I could imagine that Paladin likes the coin because they have so many powerful 4 drops and the coin lets you play 4 into 4 instead of a 3 drop.
---
A big plus for control decks going first could also be that the aggro deck doesn't go first. The aggro deck loses more from going second than the control deck loses from going first but that is pure speculation.
---
no problem!
---
Old Gods was probably my favourite expansion, at least as far as the themes and execution. There were 4 big creatures, each with their own distinct flavour and effect.
---
And they were all neutral so it was about what class to play them in, not what class could play them.
---
Damn. I‚Äôm at 4 atm, maybe if I climb a lil bit higher i‚Äôll face some more.
---
MCT doesn't belong in that list. It doesn't impact the meta like early giants or Leeroy finisher. I get that when the rng goes against you and it takes your best minion it feels bad but it is hardly broken.
---
I crafted Quest Shaman and Reno Mage because I had nearly all the cards except 1 or 2 for them and I didn't care about Galaxy nerf because I already had nearly all the cards for the deck but I won't waste 4000 dust on a controversial deck. It is too much. People here mindlessly crafted Reno Mage when it was obvious that it was a nerf canditate and you can see so many threads about their anger after wasting lot of dust. I won't do that bro.
---
Blizzard: We've talked about it for some time and decided that 1 win quest will be reduced to 25g to match the 2 win one. Thanks for playing our game and we'll see you soon^^TM.
---
Disagree, I'm something like 8-0 against it with Quest Shaman at rank 3. 
---
Ethereal Lackey/Sandstorm Elemental/MC Tech means you should always have an answer to their Tip the Scales
---
I've been playing it after the nerf and won 3/4 games I had the opportunity to coin it on turn 6. It's still very strong, it just opens up time for more aggressive and midrange decks.
---
Magnetic murlocs, what's not to like?
---
I want classic Hearthstone back.
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs shadowbanned. Everyone else can see the comment.
---
Your right it's a midrange deck that focus on hitting u in the face and playing bran. To hit u in the face. Wait this sounds like an aggro deck
---
I remember when people would drop a Sylvanas, and I was like well I lose!!! Now, it's a 5 mana instant play for a Shaman to take 2 of my tokens........
---
Uhhh infiltrator is fine, please don‚Äôt
---
Quest Druid definitely has a higher winrate going second (coin quest) but not druid in general
---
You'd be surprised. Think of it as "Get it now or miss out!" Mentality like a sale. It'd entice a lot more people than you think. It'll entice more people on the fence
---
Its pathetic to see all the other classes always being t1/2 and mage getting gutted
---
Why is this a bad thing ? They had their good deck for a whole expansion and now the meta changes. It's good.

---
Really? I feel like being one card down early is such a huge disadvantage for faster decks.
---
GOD feels so bad to have to waste resources to kill a 1 drop, but only that 1 drop cause it just delays your win condition and if you're going into turn 5 you're just worried about zilliax. God I wish I has a 1 mana 1-3 "hero"
---
And now he Hysteria's and somehow only his 3/3 survives.
---
What game are you even playing? The only deck I can think of that does what you say is quest shaman. Other decks like combo priest, Reno mage, highlander hunter, control warrior have solid consistent cards and minimal discover/card generation effects.
---
I've had some fun with the new standard Paladin Mecha'thun list that uses two Galvanizer to drop the cost of it to 8 and skaterbot to 0. Then you uses subdue to make it a 1/1 with rush and win the game if there is any enemy minion on board. Obviously the wild versions in other classes are more reliable though.
---
It's as good a strategy as any! If lots of minions and buffs is your thing, Paladin would be a good class choice.
---
It did because of the board control it gave early game
---
also you really had to Weight which one you play. Yshari doesnt synergyze with Cthun/Nzoth/yogg (battlecry), you wanted deathrattles for Nzoth, not spells, Yogg was only viable in a few classes, and cthun itself needed so many support cards that you couldnt really afford any other god.
---
I miss quest deathrattle priest.. such a fun deck to play
---
I wish it was 5 I rate it
---
Uh what?
---
I don't understand how they thought a mana fix on Boom was the issue. The deck has a ridiculous removal package that's quite frustrating.
---
Unbelievable! It's still shit 2 years later!
---
Shitpost? Yes. Glorious? ...No.
---
It's...just a dumb post made by a dumb person. I don't see how it was humorous in any way.
---
2 mana 3/2 that can win you the game possibly?
---
Hell yra biddu.
---
Play it more as a aggressive board control deck rather than a ‚Äúif I draw X then I win‚Äù
---
I'm patiently waiting for subhumans to figure out that Control Warrior is still S tier so I can quit the game again.
---
 ALWAYS DEATHWING
---
I play quest shaman it‚Äôs fun and way less expensive. Craft the quest and a few lackeys it‚Äôs pretty good. :)
---
You are grossly skewing data here. Let's assume that all adventure cards were must have's to be competitive both on ladder and future adventure content (meaning you had to have all, not just the most recent). It's 2800 gold to get ***the entire set*** or the equivalent of 28 packs. You could also spend between $20-$30.
---
Neither adventure or expansion is ever going to just hand you a full set of playable cards, it is going to take gold/money but for 2800 gold you get far, far, far more mileage out of an adventure than an expansion. Those 28 packs will get you generally between 1 or 2 legendaries, probably around 5-7 epics, about 30 rares, and around 1/3 to 1/2 a full playset of commons. The legendaries might be absolute garbage (I got Octo, warlock quest, hunter quest, and Finley as my first 4 legendaries, which means I basically got 0), the epics might not go with the legendaries you do get, and you might literally be in the position to having to craft common cards even to play budget decks.
---
Both require investment of gold or money. Adventures take you far, far, far further with it.
---
I wonder if it's a sign they plan to HoF Savage Roar.

*Such is the nature of high-roll decks. You can often low-roll.*
---
Naxx 2 drops would be strong as hell in standard, what are you talking about?
---
Wild still plays tons of naxx cards which is crazy considering how few there are and how many sets there've been since then.
---
this is a great shitpost bruh, congrats, you are welcome to r/hearthstonecirclejerk anytime
---
That isn't a deck which still questions that late.  You push the board a few times in that deck.  Either one of your pushes isn't answered or you've run out of threats.  Concede if the 2nd happens and you'll have much shorter games.
---
Omega Devastator: 4 mana 4/5 with rush that deals 10 damage to a minion, and is a mech. Welcome to control warrior.
---
Seriously. 10 damage to a minion? Flame Lance is 8 damage to a minion and that's 5 mana. How the fuck is this card not nerfed? I get that you need 10 mana, but I've never seen a control warrior that doesn't reach 10 mana
---
Which weapon did you choose, OP?
---
How far u climb so far ?
---
Basicly card generation cards should have worse stats.
---
Best turn 1 is always holy smite to the face...
---
&gt;If there's no thought involved, it means you can just sleepwalk your games.
---
&gt;The problem with relying on statistics is that it doesn't show you how many people are misplaying the deck, but with Murloc Paladin it's almost impossible to misplay. 
---
Yup. My final boss this month was a Murloc Paladin (while I was playing Quest Shaman) and the dude made misplays left right and center, and yet the game was still a game because coin lens -&gt; tip is such a big brainless power-play.  I'm not saying I'm perfect either, but it felt like this guy was playing the match-up wrong  and yet somehow he was my final boss which meant he was winning games. You just play that combo and sometimes you automatically win the game. Thankfully I wasn't too unlucky and his lens flipped tip and warleader, locking his warleader out of the game which slowed him down just enough, but it's kind of disappointing that my final boss was *that*. 
---
Granted, Control Warrior is pretty brainless right now in many match-ups too, Cleaning Commences -&gt; This Place is Scary -&gt; Shield Block -&gt; No Tomb can Hold me -&gt; Unity Precision Perfection -&gt; Armadillo Noises, but at least the mirror requires some thought.
---
Wrenchcalibur
---
&gt; There's no counter to it
---
There are. They're just not fun decks to play. ...but fun is an individual preference sort of thing so who knows.
---
What makes you think that I don't understand the point of this post?
---
I've just said that:
---
&gt;My point is that he's neither a proper, nor a fearsome 8-drop.
---
It was a joke about the card. I was implying that it's a terrible 8-drop. It had nothing to do with the art.
---
&gt; this is one of the only genuinely generous things Blizzard has done in the past few years
---
Free legendary each expansion, pity timer and garantie legendary in first 10 packs, a shit-ton of free adventures.
---
Alternatively, when you play Anduin and have nothing to play on turn 2
---
Bruh
---
Dude just play Odd Rogue and kill them waaayyyy before this happens
---
I played a lot of this brawl. Pretty fun and enabled a lot of cool combos that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be playable. Even though nothing proved to be anywhere close to as good as SN1P-SN4P, it was still one of the better brawls.
---
I think that this is a valid complaint. At the same time, I think that the meta must be pretty okay, right now, if this is the kind of thing that's bothering us.  
---
In any case, Blizzard: fix your shit!
---
Strongest deck = control warrior
---
However if you believe you're a good player and want to unleash your potential, go for quest shaman. I'm currently top 200 and the amount of quest shamans here is ridiculous, it's like 25% of matchups. The deck is really dynamic and has extremely strong early presence but has massive late game too. It's one of the more difficult decks to play but also one of the strongest if played by the right player
---
And I didn't say anything about a discount, just that it's too strong to guarantee it be a 2 mana spell. Just about the only thing keeping it in check is just how many bad spells there are for each class. Making it 2 mana means you're guaranteed to be able to play it either that same turn in many cases or cheap next turn. Some classes have a garbage selection of 2 mana spells but many have really, really good ones.
---
That is a problem. A deck doesn't need to be top tier to be oppressive. It just needs to popular. Since it was popular and it countered other value decks, you basically couldn't play one. It was also a super high roll deck that could just win out of nowhere, and there was nothing you could do about it.
---
Nah, well played is when you have lethal and your opponent doesn‚Äôt know yet.
---
Oops is when you play cards in the wrong order.
---
Threaten is for when your opponent highrolls their way to victory.
---
I laughed at this. And maybe that's where they are going with Extra Arms. Like, you can King blessings but it costs 6 mana.
---
Underbelly angler
---
Ah yeah I know they're nearly opposite lol. I meant one or the other, and not necessarily one deck that is both fun and difficult to play. Also sorry for the misunderstanding but I didn't literally mean the best deck haha.
---
But I understand that fun is completely subjective. I'm just looking for other decks that others find fun that I could give a look into.
---
Uh nope that isn‚Äôt true at all. Maybe we‚Äôll get better spells for velen later but those are far from good enough lol
---
I still play that deck in Wild, with the new cards it's almost good.
---
Every up and down is manufactured by the developers.  Where else would they come from?
---
I like card generation a lot. It's fun and feels like it's taking advantage of hearthstone's digital format
---
"Troggs Rule!" \*coin sound\* "Troggs Rule!" \*Turn 2\* "Rrrrrggrrgr"
---
Yeah this guy keeps complaining for some reason. Well put, but I don't think he'll listen to anything anymore.
---
Sure, after two weeks you can come back and say that Mage was probably nerfed too hard.  That'd still be the extent of your point, but the time off would do you good.
---
Should be the priest card that silences and kills everything then
---
Just wanted to chime in to say micro mummies totally carry the deck in some games and I would wager to say you‚Äôd see an increase in wr if you crafted them. Plus they‚Äôre really fun and annoy tf out of opponents
---
6 perfect cards? Yes please :)
---
Until Blizzard decides Mage needs to die again next expansion, of course. It‚Äôs a cycle. Mage finds a strong archetype, Blizzard takes away its tools. Ice Lance, Ice Block, LPG and Conjurer‚Äôs. Next expansion we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when they decide Frost Nova or Arcane Intellect should be Hall of Famed.
---
I definitely think that the highlander decks or holy wrath pally are some of the more skillful decks in the game. They have a lot of options for how to go about your plays, and a lot of tough mulligan choices.
---
Oof no control warrior pls ;-;
---
But I also thought about Quest Shaman and the combos that can be pulled off can be insane and I don't have a good winrate against them haha. Thanks for the suggestion will definitely consider it!
---
Then realizing your deck had eviscerate and conceding
---
However it seems zephrys always gives that god damn Tirion in almost every situation.
---
I‚Äôve always felt this card is just nuts in a vacuum, but hasn‚Äôt really found a hole since Priests lists have been so ressurect focused. Your almost always finds a card that helps you, with the rare exceptions being Murloc lists where none of the cards are good alone. It makes you more flexible and unpredictable. Aldo, hand reading is much better now that Highlander decks are so prevalent - it‚Äôs very hard to read a Highlander Hunters hand!
---
I agree with you. LPG mage wasn't even that broken - it had counters, lacked early game and depended upon a few cards. It just wasn't consistent. There are definitely times where you could coin out pocket on turn 4 and then auto stomp your opponent, but that just didn't happen as often as people made out to be.
---
Control warrior on the other hand is fucking busted. There are no other decks in the current meta which counter it and Warrior's card quality is beyond the roof. Even after the nerf it's still the most played deck, goes to show doesn't it?
---
What's with the Hireek hype ?
---
But priest actually is bad at draw though. It has to run cards like cleric, wild pyro, and circle that don‚Äôt do much on their own in order to draw cards when they manage to have all 3. Whereas classes that are actually good at draw have cards like Myra‚Äôs or town crier. Even hunter has strong draw these days with master‚Äôs call.  
---
Yes cleric can be potentially very good, but I‚Äôd say that town crier is a much stronger 1 drop that draws by itself. Requiring 6 deckslots to be used to draw cards when you have a specific combination of cards isn‚Äôt that good. Except when you happen to have all the parts, priest draw is weak.   
---
And that is its class identity I guess. ‚ÄúPotentially strong card combos‚Äù but balanced by the fact that they have weak card draw generally and their cards don‚Äôt do much by themselves
---
Quest shaman has both: takes more than average skill to master and is really fun. You should check it out, maybe watch Zalaes stream he usually plays this deck nonstop.
---
To make the claims you are now as if current data proves you right, yes you‚Äôd still be wrong.
---
Why do you continuously choose to misrepresent everything people tell you? Is it really that hard to accept blame or that you‚Äôre wrong?
---
Nop, only classic and basic cards are offered
---
This was ranked?
---
Are the nerfed cards still good?

Apparently the mods are awake and hey just don‚Äôt care, they posted a tavern brawl update less then 50 minutes ago.
---
Only 10k viewers on twitch right now tho. HS team needs to make new game modes not just cards. Many many popular streamers has already left the game.
---
Currently 7-2, lost to perfect aggro draws each time.
---
The original cost 1 mana and had a **Battlecry:** Deal 5 damage to this minion. They decided to heal it up a bit.
---
Apparently they are and they just don‚Äôt care, one of them posted something like 50 minutes ago about the tavernbrawl
---
No, my friend challenged me for 80 gold and then after it, i noticed it landed on 12345 and i suppose no more hearthstone for me
---
Personally I‚Äôve been running Shrink Ray instead of subdue.
---
But yeah, the common theme of ‚Äúquest pallys that don‚Äôt run removal‚Äù is very strange to me.  Like...you have enough value to beat control warrior in a long game; you should run more cards that make sure you last that long.
---
Turn 4 blow out was one of the best for you?
---
balancing neutral legendaries are a nightmare, blizz just took the easy way out.
---
When you compare this to a game like FIFA, pity timer is extremely generous.
---
i guess it‚Äôs because people hate to loose against a turn 4 (with coin) full board of 6/3 murlocs
---
Someone please explain,‚Äù. I am noob.

It‚Äôs been up as long as this post.
---
And then Barnes was nerfed!!!
---
I actually really like the 'powerful but narrow' theme. It makes spells feel really satisfying when you pull them off. It also means you have to think really carefully about how yo spend your resources because of you use spells too freely or too cautiously, you could be screwed. It makes for a very strategic kind of game.
---
But Priest needs a way to get the right spells at the right time. Either some decent discover cards, or some kind of tutor (e.g. shadow visions).
---
Knowing my luck, that is gonna be painful.
---
you can replace mage with any other class and rewrite this exact same comment. all classes get bashed regularly.
---
I agree. It's a bummer that the quest is so Uldom-centric. We're not gonna see any more reborn minions here on out, so there isn't much room to expand it in that regard. I think the devs may have done that on purpose though, I could see the game landsliding to easily with an insane amount of reborn minions
---
Don't worry about it, people apparently aren't yet used to these one class snapshots. It happened to some people with the previous post we did on Shaman as well!
---
1. I see no whining here, although I may have missed something
---
2. Do you mean the deck that was T1 for 3 weeks, while the meta was still not settled? I so much enjoyed those glorious 3 weeks, I will feel euphoric for the next 3 years.
---
Boom is still at a 60% winrate when kept in the opening hand even at 9 mana, so yeah. Pocket Galaxy and Extra Arms are back at the costs at which they saw no play before, and didn't get a ton of support with Uldum, so they're probably out. Conjurer's is iffy. It's Mage's main win condition, so basically, if Mage survives, Conjurer's will be a part of it.

That's exactly what i'm saying old adventures had decent value for $20, the new ones are shit in comparison. Game got way more expensive but some players are totally ok with it for some reason.
---
I'm not sure, the current standard highlander decks are absurdly priced, I'm not sure whether I want to spend my dusts on those. Although I am thinking of crafting some of the missing legendary that I have not had for Wild Renolock, such as Zola and Godfrey.
---
Maaaaaaaybe they think that this post is a "necessary evil" because the other guy really is unbelievably annoying I guess.
---
That said, I have no sympathy for any of them. Ban and punish these toxic people lol, I could care less.
---
If you want the guaranteed wins go Highlander Hunter. Deck is disgusting. Has like 5 different win conditions and each of them are better than what most decks have currently.
---
Or get it up to a palindrome 543212345.... new goal keep you going for years!

---

---
I hope that second brawl is just a deck of one zeph and he shuffles back in every turn...
---
This time around the quests are MUCH easier to complete, and i would say at least half of them are viable to good. Quest Paladin/Shaman/Druid/Rogue/Priest are all being played right now.
---
I was hoping for the adventure related brawl, maybe it'll start next week?
---
Yeah that's a good way to think about it.
---
Also he is male, and bat
---
Yknow, people are sleeping on Hack the System, but a Blizzard bug wiped out all my decks, so I used their deck list for HtS, and it can straight up body the unprepared. 
---
I think with either some ingenuity, an evolved meta, or just more support cards down the road, it can be a contender.
---
I hope they do make it a paid adventure.  That would make my decision about getting it much simpler.
---
I hit legend this month with quest paladin, so it's definitely a deck you can win with. Quest shaman is probably, overall, a more powerful deck, although in my experience the paladin is favored head to head. I don't know what the data says, I can't check it from here.
---
*laughing in keleseth*
---
Still killed him in the main questline tbh.
---
Highlander (and secret) hunter loses Zuljin, Subject 9, Zilliax in the rotation. Also, Masked Contander, Rat trap and Baited arrow. 
---
The archetype might survive but it will quite possibly require a whole different array of legendaries and epics.   
---
My suggestion is going Murloc Shaman (no Scargil) because most of its power relies on RoS. Zoolock should also work but weaker without Soularium (rotates) and Thekkan.  Token Druid (overflow list) will also work post rotation.  
---
Aggro warrior (no Grommash) is also great and relatively cheap - Leeroy and 6 epics, 2 rotating next year though.
---
That‚Äôs why I play a singleton version with sir Finley and a dragon package.  It‚Äôs much more tempo focused.  Getting Finley down early changes some matchups completely.  Best HP is warlock then depending on matchup rogue mage Druid occasionally warrior.
---
I usually play the eggs even if my quest has 2 triggers left to make them waste resources early and the stealth reborn or lifesteal reborn work just as well for late game.  I find balancing how many eggs to keep or pop is tricky and this method to close out has been a little more consistent.
---
Big Shaman is completely pushed out especially with 2 of its bad matchups getting nerfed. I'm at rank 5 with this plus murloc shaman and I am getting better results after the nerfs. Tech cards are big imo in the deck.
---
But I do wish it was better overall since it's such a fun deck to play :(
---
Oh look a murloc deck you must be very high skilled /s
---
It's an arena exclusive card. Looks like it's just a visual bug.
---
Same kind of CW that doesn't run boom, even post nerf. Rank 20.
---
&gt; No other class gets nerfed as often or as deleteriously.
---
There was a time where the only remotely viable druid deck between standard or wild was combo druid. Innervate, Aviana, Wild Growth, and Nourish were all sent to the slaughterhouse. The class didn't have a single viable deck in either format outside of the now forever pitiful jade druid, for the entire rest of the expansion and has since only come back enough to be a heavily mediocre t2/3 class with one deck: token.
---
Also, even all that aside, what solution are you proposing? That CC and LPG not be changed? They make for awful and unfun gameplay. Do you expect the entire dust value of your deck to be refunded to you? What is your end game here? 3 mana to summon an 8/8 is not balanced, especially when it sometimes summons 3 8/8's and you can cast it twice. Spending 5 mana to make your deck of high costed minions all cost 1 is not balanced. These are facts. What is your solution to this problem?
---
Arena exclusive is odd but thanks for telling. I will delete this now.

Understanding positions of power. Being able to tell when I should trade or go face, after watching some newer players play and seeing them make trades when they should have been going face was giving me anxiety lol. Knowing when to trade and when to go face is what makes great card game players
---
Mark has the high ground. Don't try it.
---
I'm gonna add to this question. What happens to the dust value of cards that get rotated out? Do players get dust for those cards? Should they be disenchanted before rotating out? I've always been curious. Thanks.

Literally all of them are good

Deathrattle: Tickle your other minions
---
I wouldn't say it's quite $20 worth of gameplay content, but probably at least $5-$10 so with the extra packs etc. from buying it I think it was worth it, despite a few issued I had with it like the design for the 3rd wing mechanic being pretty terrible.
---
Haven't been playing much standard because I have all of about 3 packs worth of cards for it but I have run into a couple of quest Priests.
---
I think people are just bored of playing it since it doesn't run anything new. I agree that it's still stupidly strong, even against warrior since you have the mech tag and the deathrattles.
---
Any time you have 4 or more 0 cost cards in your Rogue deck, you put Edwin in there.

Crazygolfer#1163 on NA looking to trade the 80g quest.  You show your quest and I will go first.

Nerf Mountain Giant rather than another Mage class card and make LPG either cost six or change its text to something like ‚Äúthe next three minions you draw cost 1.‚Äù Simple. Lots of people were advocating for those kinds of changes anyway because MG has been a problem in other classes like Warlock and LPG at seven is unplayable and there should be a middle ground between broken and unplayable
---
Can someone explain the combo? I see it all over the front page
---
Then a whole week later a legendary quest with TWICE AS MANY PACKS!

Interestingly enough, had you picked hellfire against the mage (your second opponent) you could have won, assuming a soulfire didn't discard the other soulfire.

It's a deck of 30 copies of Zephrys.  /s
---
This must be the best comment on the entire subreddit.
---
&gt;The meta is the same classes it has been for years it seems. Mage in the top rungs of Meta decks with Murloc Paladin showing up again and again and again.
---
Aside from the fact that Mage has fallen out top tier due to recent nerfs, this is such a bizarre way of thinking. Classes naturally rise and fall in the meta over time. Even if you just so happened to return when classes are in a similar position to where they were when you left (which they aren't according to your own assessment), why would you expect them to automatically be different?
---
From early data, it took about 4% off of Control Warrior's win rate.
---
I spend 50eur a month on beer. What will i have after i consume all that beer? Nothing. Exactly. And i threw some heavy dollars on nothing. Congrats to me.
---
What Hunter deck?  I say bull shit on that.  Unless you mean extreme aggro face hunter. Secret/Beast hunter has NO chance to beat Cancer Warrior.  The nerf to Dr. WIN didnt help.  They need to remove the rush tag from the mechs.  Or delete the card altogether and make the game great again.

There is a similar effect for warlocks I believe too. Iirc it‚Äôs when you play sense demons with nothing left
---
The proper use of threaten is just before you make a suboptimal play just for the memes (e.g. play yogg saron when you already have lethal on board)

Do we get something for successful finish of the Brawl?
---
Against what?  What ranks?  How many games sampled?  It aint enough. That data is anecdotal at best, as usual. 
---
The rush tag needs to be removed.  The deck need a low enough win rate so people stop abusing it.  Sick of it and so are most other people.
---
I liked it at first, but it ended up being very repetitive.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah, Auchenai is a card that nobody plays and that makes a class unplayable. Literally we get shit like Radiance because they can't risk making auchenai good.
---
This is rank floor Wild. Not competitive.
---
Hey Mark, big fan. I have an idea for you!
---
Get sorceror's apprentice off of Zephrys and Jepetto into a 1-mana faceless manipulator. 
---
Play mistwraith and master of disguise it so it sticks.
---
Next turn, apprentice, copy it, then go ham with free cheap shots. Running out of stuff to cheap shot? Play a rather large edwin, then cheap shot him to bits. Finally, smack your opponent with your giant mistwraith.
---
I read legendary and was pleasantly surprised. Then disappointed.
---
The way the number is calculated make it seem more trusty that just measuring the success based on twitch watchers
---
And the winrate went from 56% to 52-53%. Woo.
---
A whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooole pack
---
No change to the dust value after rotation. Each card is worth 1/4 its cost in dust (1/8 for commons) no matter when you dust it, unless it's been nerfed or moved to the Hall of Fame.
---
It's the fact that no matter what you do, you die by turn 7 or 9. Rarely do my games go beyond that. That doesn't seen right to me. Boom boom boom GG. That sucks to play against and with and kills a game.
---
Gotta love the asking questions and dismissing the answers before they're even given.
---
You mean from the top of the meta to comfortably within it?  Woo indeed.
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
I miss my blue boi
---
I'm pretty sure leeroy and Nomi are pretty important. Finley is just another murloc most games
---
Haha, you just condensed multiple play styles into one sentence and called them all boring. Why would you even play a card game when you hate every basic archetype that exists in pretty much all of them?
---
&gt;as well as a solid viewership of which 3.1M hours watched  
---
Which means the statement is skewed if not outright false.  
---
My reasoning being that they give away valuable packs for watching streams so many (myself included) have automated this process and don't watch any of the streams at all.  
---
Thus their metrics would be flawed.  You aren't really having an impact if the people "watching" aren't "watching.  
---
Interesting this has been the worst expansion launch for twitch watches (and there could be factors effecting that such as events on) and also July seems to be the worst month for viewership ever seen so far.  
---
https://twitchtracker.com/games/138585
---
Such a long list it is easier tobsay which ones not to dust.
---
So, I'd absolutely keep: Krag'wa, Finja, The Curator, Medivh, Baron Rivendare, Chillmaw, Crystalsmith Kangor and Yogg.
---
Also, as a general rule, don't dust any legendaries from sets you still intend to buy packs from. So don't de classic set cards unless you already have everything you want. And I'd hold on to all Uldum quests and cards like Octosari for now because they might get better over time.
---
Fandral Staghelm is a fringe case. It has not seen play in a while but the effect is strong. Althought it might have just been made obsolete by the new quest. Chromaggus is also fun but probably won't ever be meta. Rhok'delar might see play in the future?
---
Rest is pretty garbage.
---
Got to rank 5 first time with mech/bomb hunter. Deck is still super strong. Gz on legend
---
shudderwock is mando
---
Highlander hunter has always been favorable versus warrior, what the hell are you talking about?
---
Since you seem so interested in the reborn mechanic, this is the deck I'm using at legend, it's about tempo, reborns y deathrattles.
---
You want to keep the ringers in your initial hand, resurrecting them with Psychopomp works as tutor draw engine, Coffing Crashers will help you to pull out the Mechanical Whelps. 
---
There are several combos you can do depending on the situation but there are 2 main ones, one is to use embalming on the mechanical Whelps and clone them with Shadowy figure it will give you a strong resilience board, and the other is when your opponent is at 18 health, you can play Leeroy, embalming ritual and reclaimer for 18 charge damage. Still not quite sure about catrina in there, but every minion is a valid target for her, except maybe psychopomp, but is played as tempo play so the target doesn't really matter that much.

Its a real bad matchup. I got lucky everyone stopped playing it after 2 weeks. You just have to pressure them as much as possible and mulligan for aggro. I also teched in 2  4/3 silence dudes to stop priests shenanigans and get lethal through taunts.
---
But it clearly did....
---
Except how do they collect the data?  For example, where is monthly active players coming from?
---
Excited to see what y'all think of LoE: Revived. 
---
It's a different sort of Dungeon Run, shorter, more narrative-focused. New encounters that are closer to the original LoE adventure. We wanted to experiment and see what we could do with the format. No speed run, no timed rewards, just a few neat fights and free packs (you'll get your weekly pack just for playing once).
---
CS is much bigger than those esports and is the 2nd biggest esport in the west with one of the best tournament callender with a large amount of tier 1 500k+ prize pool tournaments each year. Dota makes more news because of The International, and Overwatch because how ambitious it is. But CS is a much bigger scene then either.
---
I have one too, would love to know if i should too.
---
They're the best brawls by far. No disadvantage to being f2p or being unable or unwilling to netdeck. Everyone is even.
---
"Multiple" either aggressive or health and taunt. Sounds like quite the diverse gameplay within this world now.
---
Which data shows this? Control Warrior had dropped to aroud to 53-54% just before the nerf due to counters and now it'as dropped to what 52-53%?  
---
Where are you getting the 4% from?  You can't compare it to early in the expansion to judge the impact of the nerf, it would need to come right before the nerf.
---
Yeah, I did, but that's not the point. HS started as a small side project from a small team. The fact that it blew up so hard was, most likely, unexpected. They didn't plan years ahead and now they're stuck with many poor solutions. We have no clue how much technical debt they've accumulated over the year, but I would guess that it's A LOT. The chances are that in order to implement a lot of the functions that players are asking for they would need to rewrite everything from scratch.
---
I might be too optimistic, but I just refuse to believe that they wouldn't do it if it was so simple that one person could do it in a few hours.
---
Ah yes. Let me just summon my opponents Maly at turn 4 with no way to deal with it.
---
Insane combo
---
didn't blizzard fire his wife?
---
And I'm not saying that it's unreasonable. My point is something completely different, and you're reading too much into it.
---
Yeah, I get that...but for anyone else honestly interested: Hunter is strong vs Warrior.
---
Looking back I wish there were more "weird" bosses in Dalaran Heist as well. Remember that Jade Guardian in Catacombs with his insane 10/5 minions, but they couldn't attack and would destroy the opponent's mana crystals when killed? Or the Trap Room? I feel like the bosses were made to be a lot more "normal" to make room for Anomalies and Twists, but those factors were a little too fixed, I dunno.
---
She probably does cheat at dice.
---
You can open them right away, but you shouldn't dust extras until you actually need dust
---
Unpopular opinion: New game modes are not that important, and with Arena/Dungeons/Tavern Brawls we get plenty of new ways to play, but only Tournament Mode would make a significant change. 
---
IMO people realized HS was dispensable when the Baku/Genn mess happened and the game couldnt recover well from that. Highlanders being back was a good try though.
---
Talanji was really just to experiment with a legendary I've never used, really doesnt work too well. I swapped it out for a thoughtsteal just for some extra card generation.
---
A couple of interesting-sounding new Brawls and 3 free packs? Neat.
---
Basically warrior is the only class that doesn't have any unique cards to help with the combo.
---
Thats what "long term" is for
---
You have enough for a Standard deck day 1 lol.
---
Once they move out of standard, you just lose the ability to buy with gold. Only real money then
---
This has applied to everything that has rotated, and these new type of adventures are no different
---
I upvoted your comment because you noticed and said it!
---
Ill take a look, cheers buddy
---
He played a few cards that added coins to his hand among others, so I'm assuming he didn't read the quest well enough and thought those would add progress to the quest. Either way I was extremely confused when he conceded having made absolutely no progress on his quest despite drawing his entire deck.
---
Thanks a bunch for helping. I'll keep onto Fandral for a while since i craftes him long ago to play jadesüòõ
---
Octosari seems like 150% garbage if you don't play something like Treachery but you re right.
---
The quest is actually a 1 mana activator for his combo cards
---
Don‚Äôt think this will be the case after the next review, the game has plummeted to its lowest ever levels in viewership/interest and that‚Äôs with a new expansion.
---
Might as well just have it going the whole time rather than a selectable emote the way that "created by" cards are going these days.
---
The game has gone on a long time now though, and people do not consider that just releasing more cards is worth the money they have put in to keep buying more.
---
There's no new features, no replays, no stat tracking, no custom modes, no games more than 1v1, no tournament modes etc.
---
These are all features that have been requested for years.
---
Not to mention decks are far more expensive. Im not paying another penny until I feel the game is more worth it.
---
It‚Äôs about sending a message.
---
Why do they sometimes choose to be uninspiring...
---
How would you get Sorc apprentice from Zephrys?
---
Yeah I guess I just need more practice with the deck. I was climbing up the ranks from 5 to 2 and figured I‚Äôd build a tier 1 deck to get over the hump and I‚Äôm back at 5.
---
zmora#2288   EU 80g quest trade, you go first
---
Make Holy Nova deal 3 + heal 3 and increase the cost to 6 mana.
---
This makes it a solid playable I think (on a similar level to Flamestrike; Flamestrike is 4 damage for 7 mana but doesn‚Äôt heal) but this also wouldn‚Äôt buff it to unreasonable levels (at 5 mana heal 3 deal 3 would be better than Excavated Evil, at 6 mana...probably ok?)
---
I would also make shadow word pain able to kill 4 attack minions but bump the cost of the spell up to 3 mana.
---
Relatively mild changes, not even strictly buffs since they‚Äôre mana cost increases, but just plugs holes in Priest‚Äôs core set.  Gives them a board clear that won‚Äôt overshadow expansion board clears but is good enough to put into decks (like consecrate/flamestrike power level hopefully).  Makes them not break out into allergic hives in response to 4 attack minions.
---
Well... It is as long as you summon it with DK-Jaina ;)
---
I would say the class was frail overall, yes. Blizzard printed support for a few other archetypes (secret mage in standard ha, hero power mage double ha) but by and large the cards that have seen play in this standard rotation have been mostly in support of Conjurer‚Äôs or Luna‚Äôs Pocket Galaxy, be it hand mage, dragon hand mage, big spell mage, even some forms of freeze mage. Let‚Äôs count the number of cards that probably won‚Äôt see play in Mage now that LPG is unplayable and Conjurer‚Äôs Calling isn‚Äôt much better: 
---
Kalecgos. Not good enough at ten mana to see play. 
---
Khadgar. Only really strong with Conjurer‚Äôs Calling, which won‚Äôt see play, and Power of Creation on ten and the prospect of mage surviving to ten in an Aggro meta for the payoff of summoning four random six drops is hilarious.
---
Luna. Cyclone Mage is the only place she might‚Äôve seen play and that list is somewhere around a 35% winrate.
---
Elemental evocation. Without CC Giants will be cut and see above for the problem with running it in Cyclone Mage.
---
Magic Trick: can‚Äôt discover CC anymore, won‚Äôt see any play.
---
I could go on but the Tl;Dr is that Blizzard made CC and LPG indispensable to mages, and then dispensed of it. I honestly don‚Äôt see any win conditions for Mage anymore, they don‚Äôt have the burn to kill the Paladins, Warriors or even shamans, they don‚Äôt have ice block anymore to stave off Aggro decks, and they lost their only dubious distinction which was big swings of board control. I hate it but I don‚Äôt see Mage recovering until the next major meta shakeup
---
You can replace it with the 1 mana 1/1 with deathrattle, add a 1 mana minion to your hand. This can RNG you mogu cultist no problem
---
You just gotta get used to it. Like anything else I suppose. Especially if your playstyle before was different.
---
Working with your wallet works / the problem is that you are ultimately in the minority 
---
So voting with your wallet doesn‚Äôt work? 
---
I‚Äôd like to believe it does , truly I do as it‚Äôs more pro consumer but it really doesn‚Äôt
---
The Storm Bringer seems to have bugs when used on certain boards (particularly murlocs) where minions will display incorrect attack stats even while their stats function normally.

Nozari is a 4 attack minion, not 2.
---
No, that's not what anyone is saying. The fact that you keep acting like it is tells us exactly what you came here to do: whine and complain without learning anything.
---
We're saying that your assertions that the game is somehow in a bad state because of those classes or decks is wrong. We bring up the classes you got wrong because it shows that you clearly don't know what you're talking about and aren't qualified to make any of the claims you making.
---
You keep repeating this nonsense of "I said Paladin was a top class, so how was I wrong?" when that was never what you OP was about. It was always about *why* you called out those classes and decks. You keep refusing to respond to those arguments, likely because it's now clear to you how completely flawed your thinking was. Yet you keep dragging it out as if you'll magically be right all of a sudden.
---
Yeah, murloc shaman sure is a fringe deck

Yup

Highlander hunter isn't a smorc deck lol
