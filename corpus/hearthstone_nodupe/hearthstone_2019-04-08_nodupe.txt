You should probably lead with your evidence in your original comment, because this is a very valid point that is gonna be ignored because you are at the bottom now. I wish this was getting more discussion, considering that base zoo will have a higher comparable power level compared to the new decks right off the bat.
---
---
---
To be fair it would still have rush as the hearthstone dev team plans on continually using rush for multiple expansions to come while recruit and echo have seen very little if any usage outside of a card or 2 every other expansion.
---
I agree, and I‚Äôm not saying it should be condoned or that the downvotes weren‚Äôt warranted. It‚Äôs just that personally I feel when we use words like ‚Äútransphobic‚Äù or ‚Äúracist‚Äù for every little thing it takes power away from when people are actually harboring deep feelings of hatred. When these labels are applied so liberally, someone whom protests a gay wedding is put in the same category as someone making a bad joke on Twitter. Transphobia is a serious issue but the broader the label becomes the less seriously it‚Äôll be taken.
---
I really want to believe in dragon paladin, for me it still lacks some dragons in the package, but it's defnitely something I'm looking forward too
---
Face the possibility that there are more people noticing a trend in poor ring this expansion, it's possible that the pity timer isn't working, it's broken before and it's possible that something similar is happening now.

im also a murloc enthusiast, only wild deck i really play.

I feel the same about Boom at least, what with Boomsday being less than a year ago, but I understand why it had to be him. Someone pointed out that the villains come from five different years of Hearthstone (that had expansions, at least), and Dr. Boom is the only character that suits the Naxx/GvG year. They wanted to focus on HS specific characters (or in Dr. Boom's case, HS relevant- he's not exactly an important character in WoW, but is memetic in HS), so no Naxx character would work. Plus, while KT is really funny, he really would not fit among a group of lightweight villains like the League of Evil. The only other choice would be to take a GvG character, but seeing that GvG had no story content, nobody else had a chance to make an impression in HS.

&amp;#x200B;

That said...now I'm imagining Mr. Bigglesworth as the Hunter representative of the League.
---
isnt the difference that kragwa gives multiple copies of unstable but echo cards you only get one?
---
You're clearly back pedaling. It's fine, but you don't have to act like you meant that all along or that you didn't make a misleading post.
---
Regardless, it still makes no sense to say we should face the possibility of something with zero solid evidence behind it.
---
its simple...
---
That's all fair enough, might craft it come next expansion. Thank you for the replies

Did pirate warrior have card draw I'm not remembering? Did odd rogue before Myra's? Aggro doesnt need draw. Part of why tempo mage before the nerf and the paladin decks recently have been so absurdly broken is that they were fast and also still had draw. Burn is a bigger concern and it probably needs one of the two, but it's getting secrets to help make it more resilient to clears, so maybe it'll be a new variety. Kind of like token druid, which didn't have draw or burn and succeeded by being able to get absurdly strong boards to get under removal and sometimes made it too hard to clear.

You're clearly trying to start an argument because you're too ignorant to consider another point of view based upon trends of poor ring posts within the subreddit.
---
All you want to do is argue 
---
this card brings the community together, what more could we possibly ask for? If this card was playable, imagine all the reddit posts that wouldn't have the light of day. 
---
Can't wait to move on to the next. This horse is so dead.
---
Eater of Secrets is 1 mana cheaper than Chief Inspector which I assume is important for a deck trying to combo things together for an OTK. The downside is it is worse against non-secret decks.
---
Are you sure? Pretty sure it doesn't.
---
This is only true with you get to higher ranks, you can stay at low ranks in wildand have fun with meme decks 
---
Yes, I'm sure. Had it happen before and the wiki agrees: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Gameplay#Order_of_play
---
&gt; Both heroes' health reaches zero at the same time. This causes a draw, although both players will see the Defeat screen. Neither player will win or lose a star in Ranked play, and neither player will be awarded a win or loss in Arena mode. If you were on a winning streak, it will end your streak.

What are you talking about. OP literally wrote:

&gt;1) Zoo has been one of the most successful and resilient decks ever, and has strong support in the classic set, and has virtually never been bad even if it was overshadowed by slower warlock decks at times.
---
&gt;2) Secret paladin will have no burn or card draw and will never recover after it loses the board.
---
I responded to those two points directly. How is that arguing for the sake of argument? This is a message board where people have discussions. If we're not supposed to respond, then what's the point?

Echo shouldnt be on every card just because it applies. Echo is only on witchwood cards because that was witchwoods keyword. Repeatable this turn and echo react the same with kragwa. Repeatable this turn, is just echo put in simple words

I think what most people are missing is the parallel AOE... if it was just her heropower then sure she'd be sweet but the fact that you have to clear your board AND give your opponent initiative kinda sucks. I could see subbing it in as a last resort sorta card but I don't think it's an auto-include
---
It's just your daily pre-expansionn attention whore post, it doesn't matter. I'm sure this guy is fine wasting some dust if it means being on the front of Reddit. There's nothing at stake here.

They should've put in a token control deck.  I think control shaman will be good.

Ah, smart stuff blizzard. Thanks for answering /u/Zulrambe

Well yeah, but the expansion is not out yet...

You'll get the legendary when it releases.

You'll get it on Tuesday when the expansion launches.
---
I LOVE your idea about Mayor of Darkshire Legendary. 
---
Wait why haven‚Äôt they done this yet wtf??
---
He's more than likely playing at a fireside gathering which removes all class card restrictions and lets you put more than the standard card caps.
---
Make sure you really think that through. That combo is not going to be as good as you're hoping. 
---
And Firebat‚Äôs editor puts a pepper in every thumbnail now because people were saying his thumbnails weren‚Äôt ‚Äúspicy‚Äù enough 
---
Speaking of, he hasn‚Äôt posted a video in a while. I hope he‚Äôs doing ok
---
What did you think I missed? Seems like yet another tired "still not enough damage to kill Warrior/druid" joke to me.
---
Oh. That‚Äôs great then. 
---
The ghostly animation on echo cards in your hand is still used on non-ghost cards like Unstable Evolution and Sound the Bells, so I don't think that argument holds out very well. Also, changing the name of the mechanic is fine by me, but if you're going to put a keyword into a game, then reuse the exact same mechanic, that functions the same, then there is no reason not to reuse the keyword. Lets also not forget that the card that was given "Repeatable this turn" is the callback card that is specifically a reference to Witchwood.
---
Tbh when I started playing the game I didn't even notice the tool tips. With card games you want the players to spend more time thinking about strategy and less time thinking about how cards work. And they've said they're only not reusing keywords they don't plan on using much of in the future.

I think it's just the blues of the end of the expac

I disagree, in most control matches your armour isn't that big of a deal and you would much rather higher impact cards. I would much rather get a Dynomatic/Boom Reaver/Omega Devastator/any big minion. I get it can be nice with magnetic, but honestly 2 Wargears still seem better than this and a Wargear.

You're getting down voted because your attitude was pretty shitty.

I've played Hearthstone on a very casual level for 4 or 5 years also, never spent any money on it, try to do daily quests, never take it too seriously, privately hate anyone who BMs but don't let it stick with me.
---
A few weeks ago I made it up to rank 5 in Wild for the first time ever (I'm usually right around 15). I love the level floors because I can try fun decks and different things without losing tons of ground. All it means for me is a few extra gold or whatever at the end of the month, not a huge deal to me, but kind of a fun achievement.
---
I was playing a deck I call Charge Buff Paladin, and maybe there are real versions of it but I've never encountered it even once. Every card is either a handbuff or a charge minion, with a couple lifesteal things. It's pretty fun to burst 40 damage, or steal 20 life in a turn, or whatever.
---
I have only gotten about 7 or 8 friend requests ever. I deleted all of them but one, and he was one of the good guys. But after winning against someone (he was playing some Mage deck with two ice blocks and board clears, so whatever you call that), he requested and I accepted.
---
He proceeds to give me advice and says "playing an RNG deck isn't going to cut it at a high level" and "I used to be legend but now I don't care" and was very condescending. I try to tell him I'm just playing for fun, like why would he think I'm trying to be super serious and assume that I put all my brainpower into this deck? How does he know I'm not just messing around experimenting? And if my deck sucks so terribly, why did he lose? And if he lost, why would he think his advice matters? Then he got prickly and said "I was just giving you advice, wow you're really bad at socializing."
---
Anyway, he's a douche and your guy is a douche also. I hope they play each other and they both lose. And both of their PCs/devices crash and blow up. And they step on Legos. 
---
Dr. Uberthruster is exploding my insides &gt;////////&lt;
---
I crafted a golden one on my backup account and it's been the best investment I've made. 
---
It‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre a new player. If you have any actual collection, it‚Äôs pretty useless. The novelty wears off fast. You can only play randomly selected ‚Äútier 5‚Äù decks for so long before you simply grow exasperated with it. The charm of a card game is using your own collection, assembling decks (even if just tinkering with a netdeck), and having that added sort of existential weight that comes along with knowing it‚Äôs all your own. Whizbang doesn‚Äôt really offer anything to a player who isn‚Äôt new. The only utility is to have a decent entry level way to play &amp; try out cards you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise immediately have access to. 
---
Also the charm and ‚Äúprestige‚Äù of having an all golden deck doesn‚Äôt have the remotely same weight to it when both you and your opponent are fully aware that it‚Äôs really a sort of ‚Äúfaux-golden‚Äù deck. It isn‚Äôt as if anyone higher than rank 25 isn‚Äôt aware of when you‚Äôre using a Whizbang deck. 
---
I genuinely think you would regret crafting him in golden. I think you‚Äôll inevitably wish you had either crafted a different golden legendary instead, or had put the dust towards a new deck. 
---
Its going to be a sub 30% win rate deck, which is fine if that's what you're into. 
---
Because read every other fucking thread where this has already been discussed in depth.  
---
Dr Doom is a pretty rad guy I can't blame him for being a fanboy.
---
It's a cool mechanic that people want to see more of, and keywording it makes it easier to print more interesting cards that use Echo. I love the design of Glinda, and seeing more cards like her would be amazing. Dynamic cards are always the most fun.
---
Well you see, priest is really all 9 classes. 
---
yeah, I was tempted not to because $50 value is worse than the one offered in TBP, but I think i still will. I only have 4.8k or so gold and I don't think that's enough for a few expensive dekcs, considering I got back into HS right before TBP and was playing catch up this whole time
---
Don't play spiteful on odd decks. 8,10 are the best slots to get good minions. This remember one game that I had as odd mage mirror, Both astromancer on curve,I got that warlock legendary Hir'eek, the Bat, so a 1/1, and my opponent got Lich King next turn.
---
I'm more likely to input "echo" than "repeatable" meaning I'll overlook that card, when it does meet the requirement of what I'm looking for. 
---
The difference is there are no MTG cards which directly reference ability words, because they literally have no rules meaning.
---
im curious on if DK Rexxar cave hydra + lifesteal  + divine shield somewhere also works this way or not?
---
Yes, but when would you be searching this way. If you want cheap repeatable spells, there are a ton of generators your missing out on so that still doesn't get them all, and if you want specifically echo for stuff like mistwraith then not including repeatable is fine.
---
If you‚Äôre more casual, love the idea of all gold decks, and have some dust to spare... yes!
---
yes
---
Why are there so many threads on keywords lately?
---
Clap clap 
---
no one knows for sure until Activision-Blizzard tells us
---
*wrangling*
---
I noticed that you don‚Äôt have purchase a preorder this time around. Did you have it in your previous checklists? If so, did you take it out deliberately?
---
Twinion of Medivh
---
Then by your definition, echo and repeatable this turn are fundamentally different abilities so the entire argument of replacing the two is moot. Proven once and for all that the decision to keep it as repeatable this turn is the correct decision.
---
I mean, here the meme is the Echo and 'Repeatable this turn', at Circle jerk it's more of Twinion and  O G E R S
---
Same
---
You very clearly have **ZERO** idea what you're talking about.
---
it's not hard, its just SUPER time consuming.
---
Might just be me, but it looks like an old 3D render painted over.
---
Everywhere I looked said that "mines" don't work with Blastmaster Boom because they aren't "bombs"
---
Also, you must be fun at parties. Can you take a chill pill? 
---
It fits the flavor of circle jerk though..
---
Complaining over stupid shit 
---
But great post though made me laugh 
---
It was stated that the Year of the Dragon will have an overarching storyline so perhaps we could see something like this in one of the next two sets. Good work on the design!
---
Can I ask for help here?
---
I'm new to the game and I can't seem to add my friends on Hearthstone. I even made a new 2nd account to make sure I put in the correct region/country. Does anyone have a solution?
---
He's talking about the hero Hagatha, not Swampqueen Hagatha
---
Wild was easier for me because it seemed like a few high rank players didn‚Äôt seem to have that perfect edge I saw in Standard. However, both formats are going to have a big shake up real soon!! There‚Äôs no way to know which format will be easier when that happens.
---
Thats a great idea! It fits Rein perfectly. Blizzard really needs to do more cross franchise skins. The first few were great!
---
Yup! I‚Äôve gotten a decent amount of golden DKs that way.
---
Don't even need Photoshop, just change the search bar after searching echy or echj or ccho or some shit like that
---
Says the man with brawl
---
No. Not for your main account anyway. 
---
Start an account on another region and craft Whizbang there. 
---
Lol I dusted them all. I never played wild and no plans in playing there
---
They should change it entirely to just a small tiny jade golem at 1/1 And the exact same card art getting bigger and bigger the higher the stats go. 
---
At 30/30 it's so massive that all you see in the card portrait is the jade golems massive weenie 
---
I play barnes into shadowstep
---
*laughs Hungry Crab noises*
---
Most players don‚Äôt give a shit about pity timers. 
---
I actually wonder how exactly they coded
---
It. If we were to have a card like Aukenai, but with wording: ‚Äúyour hero power also deals 8 damage to the opponent‚Äôs hero‚Äù (notice that it is not inspire, and so is tied only to the hero power itself), would it work? 
---
Pretty sure you're a troll.
---
Overwatch in 2019 lol

Lol wrong phaggot 
---
Uhhh... got him as the last legendary so far... not so happy with him.

---
   
---
you think my one word comment is causing "maximum disruption and argument"?O.o
---
Did you noticed the "fluff" flair? ;)
---
In plain English (not in the Hearthstone-specific non-keyword meaing), is literally true.
---
I think your issue is that you are typing "cfg" and not "config" after the dot. It needs to be named exactly "client.config" after the previous steps.
---
Completely different thing.
---
IMO it is a Hagatha / Wolverine offspring in the lower right ... looks young :D
---
I think the main reason for the text difference is for cards that deal damage and also have an effect, like [Inner Rage] for example. In the case of the others, the minion is summoned before the extra attack is added (not that that really matters for them, but in the case of the Ooze, the extra attack will be added first and then the ooze will summon a copy of itself. 
---
Sorry for the late reply, I went to bed quickly after posting the screenshot.
---
There's a bug where if Shudderwock gets transformed and it's Battlecry is scheduled to be doubled by Murmuring Elemental, the Battlecry keeps going. In this case you can see that the Shudderwock transformed into a Sheep, and kept receiving crazy stuff you couldn't see before on it.
---
Also, the reason I have a dagger, Druid cards, and Secrets, is because Yogg (~~by the time this screenshot was taken, a total of about 30 Yogg battlecries had been copied by Shudderwock already~~).
---
*HELlooooo~*
---
Wild is easier. Let me explain why: Laddering is the number of games you can play at a certain winrate in a certain time.
---
Winrate of top Wild aggro decks is higher until rank 5 significantly. 63-65 % vs 59-61 %. 
---
Time spent for one game for those decks is by approx. 1.5 min shorter.
---
Also now the meta will be more stable in wild, the good aggro decks are figured out.  
---
BTW, I got legend last 2 seasons in wild.
---
Yeah, as far as bugs in this game go, it is. Remember how often people complained about the very rare Charge/Rush failure? This is honestly pretty relevant for any deck that runs the card. Imagine being up against Pally's armada of DS minions and not being able to stabilise because of it.
---
Itll be good when they get more resources in one of the next two expansions. Thats what i'm worried about
---
...yet
---
if I have a baku, is it better to dust it and craft it golden?
---
r/ThreadKillers/

Who is? It's a decent card, yes. A decent neutral 2 always deserves looking at.

looks like,but she doesn't have the alligator skin on her head
---
Yeah, I can‚Äôt believe I paid 1600 dust to get stomped 60% of the time by actual meta decks. I wish it was a discover mechanic at the start of the game to choose a recipe, that discard warlock is an auto concede unless you get godly RNG.

I believe so.

How do you have those cards for turn 9 though?

I battlecry everytime.

That wild games with aggro are shorter is a fact, and only logical. At least i try to base my arguments with some data. The sample size is to low to test for winrate differnece. But that games of select aggro decks are shorter is quite obvious, and I am sure that you can not prove this not to be the case.  
---
i once got one from maelstrom portal and helped me winning the game
---
Yeah... this is pretty racist despite your adamant claim to not being racist. 
---
The three things I hate most in HS are
---
-Combo decks
---
-Infinite value
---
-Any kind of "cheating" (mana cheating, cube cheating, etc).
---
So anything that goes in these categories. Half the DK, some quests, the cube, all the priest shit that enabled many combos, all the druid shit that enabled OTK, 
---
The only reason I'm happy to see Baku gone is Odd warrior. I actually enjoyed playing vs odd paladin/rogue. And I didn't mind Genn at all, enjoyed even shaman/lock/paladin as well.
---
I opened a golden Dr Boom back in the day and I can't bring myself to dust him... same with Golden Mal'Ganis... the only legendaries I opened in GvG! (Didn't play much)
---
31h left now!
---
Care to explain why? I don't play a lot of priest but all the channels I watched about HS (Trump, Kripp, Kibler) mentioned that Madame Lazul will probably end up being an autoinclude in every priest deck.
---
&gt;Post summary: This is my opinion on legendary crafting priority based on how cheap their synergy cards are
---
cheap != meta defining, this is just theorycraft on making cheap viable decks
---
Yes they have.
---
Could you elaborate?

My vote is on Uldum, reasons explained [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aw2d4h/the_next_expansion_could_be_sewers_of_dalaran_aka/ehjj3je/) I think it would be dope for Algalon the Observer to be involved in Uldum, the EVIL League trying to use the re-origination device for some nefarious, perhaps even world-ending, purpose.
---
Either we're directed there by whatever group of heroes bands together and we run into Algalon, or Algalon is the one to tell us about it to begin with. That's my bet, anyway.

This sounds more like an "you're a cunt" issue. 
---
Solid cards are actually not viable in general. It might see play as a 29/30 card, but decks want every card to serve a role in today's hearthstone. This card does nothing to counter any specific deck style, and does nothing to progress a deck archetype. It simply does value. And that's not enough.
---
It's like all the people that thought chameleons would be insane. It's alright as a card, but you need more then alright. 
---
Good for grinding out "play 30 warlock/shaman" cards quests I keep getting for heroes I don't have good cards with and can't be bothered to make meme decks.
---
Not fun to be stuck with 6 mana cards that don't get reduced below 4 mana while the opponent plays 3 8+ drops on turn 3 because they all drop to 1 mana...
---
He's basically a coin in Arena. You spend 1 mana on it, your opponent spends 2 mana heropowering it. 
---
Could you send me a link?
---
No, the real problem is that since it doesn't affect hands and boards, unless fighting against combo decks it's almost an 8 mana do nothing spell
---
You're pathetic
---
Silence priest doesn't want her as she is terrible tempo and that is a tempo deck, any ressurect priest doesn't want her since she will upset your ressurect pool, only deck i see her be run in is an otk/late game combo deck and i don't see those be viable atm
---
Not as pathetic as playing academic espionage
---
Nothimg more cuntish than playing academic espionage
---
Cant we do this the old fashion way? stumbling on month one to make a bad deck with the most hyped cards and still wining, until you start seeing what is really good from plays made by others instead of copying deckslists and theory crafts made by streamers that are pretested cuz blizz decided they should get to play with the cards before anyone else.
---
4 Mana that loses you card advantage and does nothing for tempo is... not *that* great.
---
Of course it pays you back pretty well depending on what you draw thereafter. But "stupidly overpowered"?
---
Not a chance.
---
Also your reaction to it is hilariously childish.

I thought being healed back up only works on the same instance, e.g. lifesteal minions which damage yourself. Multiple spell casts shouldn't resolve in a row should they?

Vol'Jin and Illidan already have a card
---
Go to my last post on my profile 
---
We get it.
---
Thats why i think paladin will go for a more midrange version of the deck, like the old secret paladin. I tried making a midrange secret paladin and it looks promising
---
Make 1 good deck if it will be enough (it's still small amount of dust). Also, wait until the end of a month untill meta stabilize, don't try to reach legends after expansion, it's wasting of time and dust.
---
Yeah. That usually holds true. 
---
Secrets never trigger on the player's turn. This has been an explicit rule since before Naxxramas (due to [[Eye for an Eye]] shenanigans iirc). The only exception has been [[Competitive Spirit]].
---
Affinity with artifacts stacks with itself so that is actually moot.

Well some Odd Paladin builds use Witch's Cauldron instead of Divine Favor and it works pretty well. I've played both on ladder and I prefer the Cauldron build.
---
Of course Secret Paladin is a much different deck and may not be able to abuse the Cauldron like Odd Paladin did. But to say that Divine Favor "carries" aggressive Paladin decks is to exaggerate the situation. Remember that Even Paladin has neither Divine Favor nor Call to Arms (post-nerf) yet it is still a contender as the best deck in the game throughout most of the year of the Raven.
---
If Secret Paladin can use neutral card draw (Acolytes) effectively, or use card generation (Cauldron, deathrattle value effects, etc.), then I don't see why it won't still be a strong deck in the upcoming rotation.
---
I'm starting to think that the Secret Archetype coming in RoS is going to be a more midrange-y deck that will have some of the dragon package in there. Still lacking draw, but seeing as it has some higher cost cards, they of course will be staying in hand longer. I actually think that secret keeper won't be making the cut for example. Basic package - 1. Secret. 2. Secret Synergy Tempo Two drop!. 3. 3 drop (even if it is slower on tempo and stats like the deathrattle dragon, the high tempo of turn 2 can make up for it). 4. Bell-ringer or Dragon. At around 4 or 5 is when some draw will be needed I think. Having a midrange style there will be some room for some removal, etc. Hammer of Wrath even? Who knows.
---
I have two question. Just came back to the game after a year break.
---
1) how did you guys get 131 packs to open? There is a few that said they opened 131 packs. Is it by preordering the new expansion?
---
2) is Deathstalker Rexxar beast deck still viable in the standard ladder? Used to climb legend with it. Love hunters.
---
Cheers!
---
good luck to you! If you're on NA, I hope to see you on the ladder. 
---
I mean, Even Paladin tends to play the aggressive role in game, and that does fine.
---
We are entering into a format where Priests may have to play Holy Nova or the old Auchenai-Circle combos if they want to play more than two AOE spells, Warlocks lose half of their useful ones, and Warriors may find themselves dumping a ton of mana into Warpath. 
---
Shadows Secret Paladin's weakness to board sweepers may not be as glaring in a couple days as it would be right now.
---
[[Astral Communion]]
---
Yes! This is what I am thinking. Midrange Secrets. The early tempo plays (Totem Golem and Fiery Win Axe Stats) are super strong, and can carry the game towards the later turns. 
---
i dont know 100% but i hope blizz isnt dumb enough to bring out an adventure with cards that have rotated out just after rotation. like dont make adventures exclusive to people that have a full collection.
---
i dont see the point of golden cards. yay flashy GIF instead of a Jpeg. i dont like golden cards tbh.
---
lets say i get Nomi in Golden, i would disenchant this card 100% because i cant see good use of this card. seems too unreliable right now.
---
i saw many ideas on making nomi good. but i just dont like the card flavor. even if it would be a T1 deck in 1 month. i wouldnt regret it, because i dont like the playstyle this card is bringing. aka go deckout as fast as possible and use nomi.
---
pretty much if i dont get : Nozari, Rhyssa, Kalecgos, Cathrina muerte, Scargil, Elysiana or Rafaam (meme) i will dust the card 
---
Epic cards: same shit as above, no synergy with the decks i want to play or could use in the future = disenchant (or total garbage)

What's your favourite shaman deck? I lack so many cards even though I envy shaman players 
---
I would argue that the act of "countering a spell" is pretty intuitive (you don't actually need a description of what counterspell does), but "Echo" isn't, which makes it hard to compare.

If you get bored with standard, play Arena.
---
If you get bored with that play Solo Content.
---
If you get bored with that go back to Standard.
---
Honestly I've played this game 5 years now and the only time I wished I had some wild cards was for specific tavern brawls.
---
Kibler used it with success in his Hand Mage and I had it as a one of then actually changed to two copies because turns out a 3/3 that casts 3 Arcane Missiles is pretty decent
---
But vargoth says at the end of the turn, so technically all the vargothes activate at the same time (i think) so all the spells they cast must resolve fully even if you are dead (imagine one casted healing rain)
---
I loved oddlock for the memes 
---
OMG, I'm rooting for the more midrange secret archetype to pull through, didn't even think of the Ashmore package! That's insane. The Egg paladin that already exists! With these massive tempo early turns!
---
80g quest share NA Polishiwa#1944. You go first
---
It *did* say 30 cards, not 31. 
---
I disagree because of the nature of Aggro decks. Secret Paladin will have access to several early game tools that can snowball the game like \[\[Mysterious Blade\]\] and \[\[Sunreaver Spy\]\]. Additionally, it benefits from value effects like the new twinspell \[\[Desperate Measures\]\] and \[\[Commander Rhyssa\]\] which work well with the rest of the Secret package. Finally, \[\[Hidden Wisdom\]\] can be added to the list so that card draw doesn't remain much of issue.
---
Looking at the rest of the thread people are claiming that Secret Paladin will never work because Divine Favor is to much of a lose but they mainly forgetting that a lot of the Aggro stoppers and heavy value tools are being rotated out. Standard as a format will become relatively weaker and decks like the current Midrange Hunter and Odd Warrior will not be present to stop them. Moreover, when you take a look at previous meta dominant decks, Pirate Warrior didn't run any card draw effects either and still thrived. 
---
No but its annoying for me when its posted 3 to 5 times a day
---
7pm???? Awwww man
---
I don't know man, I've never been interested in priest decks so I don't regret dusting those
---
Everyone's been saying that they want Echo to be a Witchwood-only keyword, so I took it that Blizzard had said that on twitter or in a reddit comment - perhaps I was wrong. Either way, they should just communicate clearly :)
---
Reviving minions never activated their battlecry. So even if it did revive Da Undataker he would be a vanilla 8/5.
---
Oh, yes, sure.
---
From 131 RoS packs:
---
9 legendaries (Nomi, barista, stalladris, oblivitron, khadgar, nozari, lazul, catrina, boom reaver)
---
31 epics (1 golden, power of creation)
---
Feeling pretty good, seems like a high roll. Plus the two bundle legendaries I get tomorrow and a bunch of dust from the hall of fame cards, so I‚Äôm feeling set for rotation.
---
But stealth.
---
I will craft Blastmaster Sparky anyway
---
Why wouldn't they be? 
---
you can target your own steatthed minions.
---
700 Gold a wing/4 wings or 20 bucks
---
B E H O L D
---
I need to play more stealthed minions evidently
---
I like day 1 crafts I don't craft for power but just the Legendary that allows me to create a interesting deck or one for a deck I wan't to play I have crafted low power stuff at times too.
---
Kamikaze is not suicide?
---
Or not. Most of them suck.
---
Just because you are supposed to be a "good guy" doesn't mean you can't do some shady stuff too.
---
That would be understandable, but then if they printed a new card like that the Echo Keyword wouldn't be tied to Witchwood anymore.Team 5 never said Echo is gone forever, but at the same time having repeatable this Turn means it probably is going to stay as a Witchwood thing.
---
Looks like rather than answer you he'd prefer to spend hours arguing with you as if it's going to somehow change the fact that this thread exists. Just ignore him.
---
Hence the only time I see stealth being from a razormaw
---
50 packs. Enough to get a nice start, most commons, and a lot of rares etc. I will be buying the solo part later so I will get some extra packs throughout the next month.
---
Day 1 craft probably Kalecgos and Khadgar. 
---
That actually sounds like a good recipe for success if the deck works out. Gonna be hard for them to prepare for the combo if they don¬¥t see it coming. 
---
True... But look at that recurring villain card. There is no gray area, he's evil.
---
I can agree that it isn't a full on aggressive deck, but on the aggressive-controlling scale, it's current incarnation does fall closer to aggressive than controlling. When Call to Arms was four mana, it was quite clearly much more aggressive leaning.
---
Granted, if a deck is playing as the aggressor in most of the games it plays, it really might as well be an aggressive deck.
---
Yup i'm fully prepared to switch to wild at this point cause i'm afraid that ppl will ruin standard with cheesy and boringly broken decks within days and in wild you just got a much bigger variety of decks that you can play and actually enjoy it.
---
Your comment as well as the guide posted by OP really show the immense powerlevel of 2017. Glad too see Blizzard toning down on the power of cards now, but that doesn't solve the problems Wild will have with the 2017 cards in the future.
---
The problem is that on average it's just good enough to run, but in some cases it just randomly wins the game. Powerful taunts are fine. RNG wins aren't.
---
Idk was just wondering cause naxx isnt available anymore
---
That's awesome!
---
I‚Äôm definitely crafting dr boom and barista day 1
---
Almost everyone misjudged this card, it‚Äôs was a lot stronger pre-nerf but it‚Äôs still a blast to play.
---
Playing odd Paladin won't make you any friends. 
---
How long till the new expansion hits? (Mine‚Äôs quest mage btw :) )
---
No kamikaze stands for divine wind, ever since that typhoon saved japs from mongol invasion circa 1200 AD
---
Rly? Wild its noncaped game thats all, u can dislike, but dat's the true NONCAPED game.
---
All were standard on start, then become wild in session rotation.
---
Well yeah, he is waiting for others to review the cards and he will rate them something in between. His ratings were always shit as far as i know. after he rated the cards from rastakhan i never watched any of his videos because they are guaranteed to be garbage. and i hate his face. LOOK AT IT, BURN IT WITH FIRE
---
It really fell apart, lol
---
I'm still disenchanting my glitter moths (for obvious reasons) but otherwise I hear you. 
---
You can check it in here https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22938499/hearthstone-update-april-4-rise-of-shadows
---
I agree that hoarding every card is not the best way to go about things, but it tends to be the way I do things anyways. I don't really care too much about having the most competitive deck but having the freedom to make the deck I want with the cards I have. 
---
Kinda sad, but i managed to not craft the deathstalker rexxar and the lich king throughout its entirety in standard lol. Genn and Baku were only legendaries that I didn't hesitate crafting because they are basically non-replaceable cards in roughly ~18 unique deck archetypes. (It's a lot less than that, but in theory its 18) 
---
You can still play it if you own it and with it being free content I could only assume they would still let you. We will have to see I suppose!
---

---
I pictured Khan from star trek wearing a rasta hat
---
Quick Question on what counts for full credit: 
---
The form has the following: 
---
"Most Popular Whatever: Full credit within 0.95x of the top card. (e.g. if most is 20%, cutoff at 19.5% and up.)" 
---
However 20*0.95 = 18. Which way will it work in this case? 
---
80 packs plus the possible 12 so 92. hoping to make Bomb Warrior,  New Shudderwock and a Minion Mage. Presuming I get the cards. I also think thier could be a deck creatable with a new Legendary that could be strong but thats Top Secret and I don't want to have to kill you.
---
Yes, there's a whole spectrum of midrange decks. It's arguable Taunt Warrior is a midrange deck on the other end. 
---
But going back to the original topic Even Pally is honestly more on the controlling side. 
---
&gt;why disenchant cards
---
Because I want to play with new cards that I will enjoy playing without spending a bunch of money, rather than having a bunch of cards I don't use lying around for years for absolutely no reason? I'd rather be able to make the stuff I actually want to play than rather than just resort to playing whatever I've been fortunate enough to open from packs.
---
You have -4 cards that‚Äôs why 
---
I don't think making the game into more of a Skinner Box is going to anything good for the game.
---
This is true, and it‚Äôs not just because it‚Äôs cheaper to keep up once you have a couple decks.
---
Top tier Wild decks are generally cheaper dust wise than top tier standard decks.
---
Opening 3 packs and not gonna craft anything. Waiting for the meta to define before I waste any resources.
---
If you dust a **normal epic** and craft a golden one to dust after the change, you gain **+500** dust.  
---
If you dust a **normal legendary** and craft a golden one to dust after the change, you gain **+0** dust.
---
Or am I missing something?
---
Oh yeah missed that one mb
---
Replace malygos for THE BANCIENT ONE
---
How are you getting more than 3 in a row?
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means
---
I disagree.  Divine Favor was more often a Hail Mary play to try and draw lethal than genuine sustain.
---
Also isn't the point of Secret Paladin to use cards that siphon secrets out of the deck so they don't become bad draws later?
---
These are the end days 
---
Yes. If you have an active arena run, get it to 2 losses and leave it there. When the expansion hits you'll get the rewards and a ticket for a new run for free.
---
I made the mistake of disenchanting every wild card I had when wild was first introduced.  I regret it deeply because although I mainly play standard, playing wild as a break is lots of fun, but my wild decks are so limited that it isn't the same as standard for me.
---
I de'd my cards. I always do and I literally never regret it. I fucking despise this meta, Genn and Baku is something I never wanna see again or play. Its not fun, its not interesting, same shit every game and its toxic to play into. I will and only will play standard. The limited card pool is way more interesting to me then a huge card pool because it becomes to the point where decks are just overloaded with shit. Look at even Shaman in wild pre-flametongue nerf. The deck had everything, the whole "even" idea is thrown out because Wild has so many cards that the negative of not being able to include odd cards is nearly nullified. 
---
So yea, Wild sounds like my nightmare, but I could see the appeal for people with a different mindset and game philosophy than me
---
I have to replace far fewer cards with each expansion because the Wild cards provide a nice base.
---
Lucky, I had 3 legendaries in the entirety of the 131 packs lol fml
---
Wild is garbage that no one plays
---
Yes. If you have an active arena run, your run will end and you‚Äôll get rewards based on however many wins you have. This is because your deck may contain cards that are no longer allowed in the arena(aka rotated sets). For compensation, you will get a free arena entry. 
---
So, the suggestion is always to play arena as well as you can and get to as many wins as possible. Once you hit 2 losses, stop. 
---
Hope this helps 
---
I'd be pretty careful about dusting ones that are really unique and ALSO low cost.  Sonya Shadowdancer seems like a card worth keeping around, for example.  Same with Gentle Megasaur, Meatwagon, Evasion, Bright-Eyed Scout and probably some of the quests.  These are cards that might not be seeing play now, but could see play at some point if Blizzard stops being careful about printing the kind of cards that interact with them.
---
On the other hand, stuff that costs 7+ and doesn't do something really unique is probably dust-worthy.  If Reno Mage hasn't been running Sindragosa in wild, it's probably not going to start running it.
---
&gt; It surpises me to see here cards like Uther, Hadronox, Rin, Oakheart and Val'anyr :S
---
I mean, all of these are hovering around 1% playrate (except Val'anyr which is 0.4%) So like...part of this is just the 1.5% cutoff.  That, said, for these I'd evaluate based on whether you enjoy playing the cards.  Like...hadronox decks aren't popular in wild right now, and typically Druid has had stronger things to do than Hadronox in wild, but if you enjoy the gamplay of Hadronox you should probably keep it.  And who knows, maybe they'll print a version of Da Undatakah with taunt, powering up wild hadronox decks.

Fuck ya, does 2 losses really matter or is that just saying basically win as much as you can to get better rewards (for freeish) but stop before the runs over at 2 losses?
---
I hate this pretentious attitude. Way worse than any deck
---
There is no clear benefit for ‚Äúclean card text‚Äù the same way that there is a clear benefit for lowering the cognitive load on players. That is why the design team is prioritizing card text that does not require memorizing keywords for non-evergreen mechanics.
---
The literal only downside of changing the text is that a couple VERY detail-oriented people on Reddit might make a couple unhappy posts. The downside of using keywords whenever possible is that a portion of the player base will not remember what ‚Äúecho‚Äù means in three years when no echo cards have been printed for a while. That will be frustrating for them and will make the game less fun.
---
You can see why ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do the thing that makes the game less fun for some people, even if a couple people on the subreddit who don‚Äôt understand the idea of evergreen/deciduous mechanics are displeased‚Äù is a trade-off that Team 5 is happy to make.
---
Hopefully with the rotation we will see cards from Boomsday and Rhastakhan a little more since they arent competing with the Frozen Throne or Kobolds cards. We are already seeing Masked Contender see play in secret paladin.
---
People are boring. It‚Äôs the last day of the rotation, and the last chance to try Vargoth with 2017 cards, and nearly every match i played in Casual was still Odd Mage/Paladin. I sense your struggle.
---
Sorry I thought I had link to the game in there. Fixed now.
---
He's relatively accurate for the most part, but every expansion there are a handful of cards that he gets hilariously wrong (i.e. Corridor Creeper, which he gave 1 star but it was probably the most impactful card of the set before its nerf)
---
Something I don‚Äôt understand 
---
If I have one golden Murkspark Eel and 1 normal Murkspark eel - why wouldn‚Äôt I craft another golden one?
---
I‚Äôm not asking for a cosmetic battle pass.  I‚Äôm saying a battle pass to unlock cards/packs.  Our only option right now is to do daily quest to get gold.  The 10 gold for every 3 wins is basically nothing.  Then we have the archaic economy of every card game where we‚Äôre paying $50+ for getting only a number of the cards per expansion.  A battle pass would encourage people to play by actually giving you rewards for playing.
---
The latter
---
I have to agree here. Hearthstone is incredibly expensive to keep up with. You'll have good decks in wild still and can add pieces from new sets as you go. 
---
I guess he had a full board of Vargoth with the card that doubles end of turn effects
---
As if I could forgetti. Listen, Uther, there's something about the plaguette you should knead. Oh no... It's too late. These peopleroni have all been infectedanana. They may look al dente now, but its a matter of thyme before they turn into the unedible.  
---
The most gold-efficient way to get packs outside of buying them outright is gonna be arena. This should also increase your game knowledge a fair amount as far as fundamentals go, in terms of deck building. As for making your own decks, a good way to start is to pick a single good card and build around it. If you start with Oblivitron, the new Hunter legendary, you can build around it by putting in other dearhrattle mechs, and things that trigger their deathrattles. Toy around, put cards in and take them out, and figure out what works
---

It was actually Sargeras, through a portal. It's described in the War of the Ancients series by Richard A. Knaak and even re-enacted in an in-game cinematic in WoW: Legion.
---
I'm still slightly skeptical on Scribe being as strong as you have it. Don't get me wrong, it's a super strong card in this (or any meta), but I think the breakpoint between 4 health and 5 health is very significant. Especially when it comes down on turns 5-7. 
---
We must prove him wrong!
---
I definitely never dust any wild card. Wild is very fun and you meet so many different kind of decks. Dusting 16 epics to make 1 legendary doesn't make any sense for me either.  Everyone's taste I imagine.
---
4 drops are useful. Sacrificing valanaar is logical.
---
Ohhhh you're right makes sense 
---
Spreading Plague is a KotFT card, not an Ungoro card. But yeah it‚Äôll be nice to have it gone.
---
good match! 
---
First [[Weasel Tunneler]], now [[Feral Gibberer]]. This game is going to become literally unplayable without a neutral one-drop with a funny effect!

1/1/1 | After this minion attacks a hero, add a copy of it to your hand.  
---
Because you only get dust equal to the crafting cost of up to TWO of your highest rarity copies of a card. 
---
If you find hunter fun then so be it. Most people are playing hunter because it wins often and easily, and those are the people I‚Äôm referring to. 
---
Because it are only a few (maybe 3 keywords) that I have to learn in any given standart formag or when an expansion hits.
---
But in lot of years it whould be very many.
---
Why wouldnt Blizzard want to learn from mistakes older CCGs/TCGs like Magic did. Magic is such a great game but there are reasons why the coolest formats like legacy for example are dying.

Was the 80 pack bundle available to open a day early?

or 5 stars for forge of souls and warlock quest

Exactly, every single game of bomb warrior I saw played worked the same way. The Warrior would play understated minions or overcosted weapons and fall slowly behind because the opponent was able to remove or trade favorably. They lost tempo and got boarded out, while waiting for the bombs to kill their opponent. That deck is gonna be garbage. 
---
 Crankypants#116646 NA trading 80g quest. You go first please.

Well, Corridor Creeper is a bad example, as the way it worked wasn't clear, so most people rated him extremely bad.

See the other comments in this thread for why this system would suck.

Got ya, cheers! Any one for legendary I‚Äôm assuming

I am an optimist, but I don't see how the meta will possibly be stale. 
---
Genn and Baku: gone
---
SK cards: gone
---
Cubelock: gone
---
Many OTK decks: gone

Another example: new strats are evolving around Vargoth already. I could go on. There's a lot that is changing and a lot to be excited for imho.

Fuck odd Priest

YES!!!
---
I remember thinking just before the rotation two years ago "why would I buy the first wing of LoE, I'm never going to use these cards" and since then I've crafted both Reno and Brann.
---
RIP... I got crap too from 131 packs
---
If true then your MMR should be way down and you should now be queuing into people playing River Croc and Bots. 
---
Just to double check then

I‚Äôve got no Gloom Stags so crafty two golden

I‚Äôve one normal glitter moth so craft 1 golden, I have 2 of everything else so just craft golden commons?

I've lost my rank up four times already, always against Tier 1 decks who high rolled their opening.  As much as [I love playing awful homebrew decks](https://imgur.com/a/WIeToLW) with [low win rate](https://imgur.com/a/8GSyMiK), losing to a tier 1 who high roll his opener is infuriating. What make it even worse is that 3 of them just spammed emote throughout the fight. Dire Maul into Crackling Razor Maw into Hyena/Springpaw? Geez, that sure is a good reason to rope and spam emote for the rest of the match.

To be fair, the ones he gets wrong are usually ones that most people get wrong, like Dr. Boom vs. Troggzor. 
---
He did hilariously rate the terrible warlock quest 5/5 stars though
---
Blizzard should do this worldwide. No one gives 50 euro in my country. I can live for 2 weeks with this money.
---
I doubt they'll ever put them back in. If anything, they'll reprint conditions, like Jan'alai for Rag or having two Bombs in your opponent's deck to make Dr. Boom. It would be silly for them at this point to just rotate them back in, financially. 
---
Thanks for the advice! I didn't know about the advanced AI. You can get 100 gold from beating them all? Anyway, great mind think alike. He got Jaina from Lich king so I made him a mid-range tempo elemental mage and he's at rank 20 right now. Unfortunately, he created his account before the "50" ranks were introduced so I guess he missed out on those packs. 
---
Everyone hates the idea of skinner battle passes.  One that gets you cards cannot be a bad alternative to paying lots of money.
---
I have about 7k gold, so I'm planning to open 70 packs.
---
As a Wild player, I think I will actually use 10 or 20 cars at most for my ladder decks, so I find no need of opening a high number of packs. 
---
I personally think Wild *is* garbage and I will *never* play that mode... But thing is, wild cards are used for more than just wild;
---
Tavern brawl, solo content... If you're not short on dust, keep those in mind before dusting wild stuff. Some of the broken wild cards can often kill solo content on their own, while standard cards struggle. 
---
One of the best expansions 
---
370 packs? Damn might consider buying some stocks in blizzard. But anyway thank you and good luck. 
---
That's a joke, right?
---
Yeah its hard when he has to come up against Mech-thun and doesn't really understand how to properly combat combo / aggro/ control decks. 
---
It was completely clear, people just didn't read the card
---
That and the satisfaction of actually beating it! Priest and Warrior took me forever but man it felt good beating them.

Your mom sucks

Trading 80g Na, baganaz#1905, I show you go first

1. If you have the HoF cards, don't go through the trouble of making a golden one. The dust returned is not worth it? (Yes/No?)
---
Once the cards rotate out, we will get the full dust back into our accounts?
---
1. Unless what they meant is that we will get the full dust back if we choose to disenchant the HoF cards? (Yes/No?)
---
1. You will reap more dust "profits" if you craft the Common HoF cards into golden ones and then disenchanting them after rotation to reap the benefits of the dust "profits" you'll get from disenchanting? (Yes/No?)
---
1: Yes
---
2: No. You won't need to disenchant anything to get the dust.
---
3: This is true, but it is a very small amount of additional dust. If you are confused/unsure about what to do I would skip this.
---
I suppose so, but I learned from a reddit post so what can you expect?
---
‚ÄúI could go for some more Jade Druid in meta‚Äù -Literally nobody.
---
Exodia mage is the best deck ever existed IMO.
---
The MSoG Gang Bosses weren't really the villains of the story in a traditional sense. They are quite similar to the Guild Leaders of Ravnica or the Khans of Tarkir in that they're only the "villain" of the story if your guild or tribe opposes them.
---
Also, Jade Golems are never going to be allowed in Standard ever again. That mechanic, especially in Druid with Jade Idol, was absolutely ridiculous. At best, its going to be a new version of Jade where every card with it will summon say a 4/4 Jade Warrior.
---
i would love to see some of the friendly folks from westfall, or even more of the defias gang. i started playing WoW at a young age, and i wasnt very good, so a lot of my best memories were from the low-level areas.  i think the newest expansion looks really cool, but nothing can change my desire for more WoW-based expansions.
---
That Volcanosaur was pretty good with cannot be targeted adapt
---
Ok makes sense, tyvm man appreciate it!
---
Man, learn do play and don‚Äôt be a idiot!
---
Yes. All of the hall of fame cards will give a dust refund once the rotation hits.
---
You opened them. They are in your collection. You just skipped them not deleted them
---
One can still dream
---
Which isn't the subject of this topic but ok
---
Yeah the new arena format is going to be cool!
---
You learn english first
---
Reddit is not a hivemind and there's hundreds of threads made on this subreddit daily.

/u/filthyluca I'm not crying, you're crying

I just pulled off a three extra turn combo. I used Leyline Manipulator with Time Warp in hand, so I was able to play Archmage, Drakkari Enchanter, and Time Warp all in the same turn.
---
After casting Molten Reflection on Archmage in the 1st extra turn, I just passed the 2nd extra turn without doing anything and enjoyed the animations of the Archmages saying ‚ÄúBehold!‚Äù 10 times.
---
Trumps great. He's insightful enough to be right about some things and brazen enough to be wrong about others in a way that it's entertaining either way.
---
Thanks!
---
Soldier of Fortune is 5/6. And neutral. Moreover, it's in this tier list.
---
Sorry for the confusion. I watch a few streamers (like Trump, DT, etc.) and they talk about how much 1 damage is in terms of mana. This is how they speak with cards like 'Inner Fire' or 'Regenerate' to evaluate their efficiency. Does that make more sense?
---
I'll be very surprised if we see a murloc deck with a value plan. Murlocs are bad if you can't flood the board and Hagatha will sit in on your hand while you lose the board. Hagatha isn't as good as Rexxar either. The Murloc Shaman I've seen Pathra theorycrafted looks much more strong with a more straightforward aggro game plan.
---
How does it work. I have registered.
---
Pretty sure it will be a RoS pack since we'll be a new hearthstone year
---
Yeah I think it's a little below average.  Something like 23packs/lego. I've got a decent chunk of dust and 4400g saved up. Between that and the 2 freebies think I'll probably be able to craft what I wanna play without spending more cash. You might be right on Rhyssa. I usually prefer my pally more control than aggro, but I'll certainly try her out.
---
Well most cards should be 3 stars, yeah.
---
It‚Äôs tough because I still think the card is crazy strong.  It‚Äôs just the discard mechanics suck in hearthstone.
---
Is there an exact time ?
---
Is this a running gag now?
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I was very inconsistent pre-Un'Goro, so that certainly affects my perception, but to me there's always been Tar Creeper lol
---
1 star
---
If you don't mind me asking, what Reno deck gives you the most trouble? I find it to nearly be an unwinnable matchup. Does benedictus cause you grief?
---
I have an extensive wild collection but the decks there just make me hate the game. I really don't want to disenchantment anything but it's simply not fun anymore.
---
Big Priest and Mill Rogue mainly, but once I run into one of those I just log off or go back to standard. 
---
I wish wild would rotate sets monthly or something. Then it'd always be different.

Request sent, I'll go first
---
there was a data mining post saying that there was an event quest chain, not sure if it's going live tomorrow though
---
I finally finished it last week because I wanted to do it before the expansion rotated out. Good job though, really waiting to the last minute lol!
---
I have a weird thing with golden cards. I don't disenchant them (even the unplayable ones) but I regard them as a sort of "savings account" for dust. I generally use the dust I have on hand for crafting but if I like knowing that if I ever need some extra dust I've got a decent number of golden cards sitting around to DE.
---
One day I will really want to craft a specific legendary and on that day I will DE my golden Flame Leviathan but until then it sits uselessly in my collection.
---
Even if so, my other point still stands. Low rank wild is a lot of fun and a a nice change of pace when standard is starting to bore you. You see all sorts of crazy inventive decks. Go too high you start running into big/combo priests, mill rogues, etc but prior to that it feels like what casual should be.
---
Yes but you played a 6 mana 5/5 and a lackey on turn 7 to get that draw 3 spell. Draw Backstab, Prep, and a Blink Fox and that‚Äôs a fucking terrible outcome for you. Stop trying to instigate stupid shit just because I think a card is bad
---
That looks weak af, better wait for another exp or try it in wild
---
I feel your pain man. Exact same numbers here. 2 of my legendaries are Nozari and Boom Reaver :/  Was hoping for both rogue legendaries and New Boom, managed to dodge all 3.
---
if you have it downloaded, just open it up before you open up hearthstone, and it should start working.
---
You still can if you owned at least one wing before it rotated. But yeah, money only if you don't.
---
Haha thank you! :D
---
After MSOG this is my most fondly remembered expansion, but at the same time it brought us so many broken/very high power level cards.
---
Guessing the goal is to create massive Dire Frenzied+Emeriss-buffed Scalehides? Cool deck, even if it's not meta. I'm glad you got some fun out of it!
---
Fantastic!
---
If you have regular copies a card that is getting hall of famed, you will gain no extra dust by dusting the regular version and crafting a golden one. (small exception for commons, you can get a miniscule dust increase from those)
---
It's a different story however if you want to upgrade the card to golden and then keep it; however. Essentially the hall of fame rotation lets you upgrade your cards to golden without any cost.
---
Turn off windowed mode

aren't the control bomb warrior and rush bomb warrior links the exact same?

Nice. Thank you.

I did that once. Pissed me off. Never again will I make that mistake
---
"Other people are dumb so fuck them" what a great attitude.  
---
Yes it's a tantrum. And repeating victimy mantra like "insulting your intelligence" just makes it even more so. The deck slots is at least a reasonable complaint since it's actually consequential.  
---
Gamers and gaming subreddits are notorious for complaining about anything and everything so I don't know why you think that helps your stance.
---
Thanks, I should clarify I am not looking to gain any dust, just gain golden copies of cards. I don't dust any cards unless they are nerfed and play wild a lot so a "free" golden Genn and Baku would be awesome, let alone all the others.
---
I am not able to open the packs even though I am in my fireside. Any ideas?
---
most reviewers make their reviews very vague so that they are never entirely incorrect.
---
You either die by turn 5 or live long enough to become to winner.
---
The problem with Arcanologist is that she's a completely normally-statted 2-drop, but she has a tutor effect that tutors synergy cards attached to it on top of that. She would be okay as 2/2, maybe 2/1(remember that Novice Engineer, which has a worse effect, is a 1/1), not a 2/3. That's not a card you should ever print.
---
It means a lot of reviewers tend to be a little more ‚Äòwishy-washy‚Äô and generous with their ratings. Like ‚ÄúThis card *could* be good if XYZ happens in the meta down the line‚Äù. 
---
Trump on the other hand is typically much less generous and ‚Äòpessimistic‚Äô for lack of a better word, being more absolute in his predictions. He also reviews cards as he predicts them in the exact upcoming meta, not down the road, leading a lot of his predictions to come across as ‚Äòthis *will* be good‚Äô or ‚Äòthis *wont* be good‚Äô. He once rated an entire set‚Äôs Priest cards as 1 star, regardless of how good the individual cards were, because he believed Priest as a class ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt see play‚Äô during that expansion (I believe it may have been 
---
This leads to him, like I said, either ending up very right or very wrong; as his reviews very often don‚Äôt have much middle ground compared to other pros.
---
If you want to own the golden copies then yeah you should do that because you get to upgrade for basically no cost. If you aren't sure then you can do it anyway because you don't lose anything over just keeping the normal versions but you get the option of keeping the gold cards in case you ever want to use them.
---
 If you plan to dust them regardless then upgrading them to gold won't matter except for common cards where crafting gold will net a 10 dust profit.
---
If you end up with a really successful run, then just play it out and get the rewards. If you are bad at Arena or just get a really unlucky draft, probably just get your two losses and then sit on it.
---

But why? You can only draw and play so many in a game. if you're tapping to draw as many as you can the impact to your life total speeds up the game that much more.

Wholesome though. I always had a problem with games that i lost this connection with cards. These games can get very mechanical, esspecially when its competative.

In that case yeah, feel free to craft them golden. It won't cost you anything.
---
He's rarely 1 star off on his prediction, he will almost always be either spot on, or so wrong it's laughable
---
I'm just hyped for the new Whizbang decks tbh
---
Do I need to get rid of the regular ones or will it see the two golden copies and use that as the basis for the refund?
---
Say you now have a regular Baku. You don't do anything. Tomorrow you get 1600 dust and still have a Baku worth 400 dust =1600+400 for a total 2000 dust.
---
Now to your idea. You dust your Baku for 400, Craft a golden one for 3200, get a 3200 refund, and then dust for 1600 = 400 + 3200 + 1600 - 3200(because you had to craft the golden one) for a total 2000 dust again.
---
There is no point. Same applies to rares and epics. You can however craft golden commons for a small benefit of 10 dust per copy.
---
Wait what‚Äôs happening to quests ? :/
---
Its hard to say. A lot of expansions that followed witchwood were dull because the power level was too high.
---
The following expansion is not only exciting because of the new cards being playable but also because of old cards that were previously underpowered to show up.
---
Thanks! Mostly the goal is to have survivability and card draw to be able to get to actually use Emeriss and Rexxar as much as possible. Doesn't really matter what Emeriss hits, it's going to be amazing, but yeah 8/12 scalehides and 6/24 grizzlies are pretty nice.

Is this a Dinosize + Blessing of Kings + a random +1/+1 effect?

So many cards i love are going away. Im really not excited at all for this. We really are removing quests. Why? I understand some DK's are pretty crazy but quests should be moved to classic.
---
I love draw combos so much.
---
Legendary rate is absolutely ridiculous. Should be 1 in 10. Then it still takes like 200 packs to get all legendaries of just 1 set.

1 mana = 2.5 HP. Card + 4 mana = should heal 14. Compare to: Healing Rain. This can only heal face, but it can overheal as well, that's generally considered "even". 
---
Starting at 2 and increment 2 a turn means that on average it has to sit in your hand for 6 turns before you use it for it to considered for constructed play. So potentially playable (mentally compare it to Justicar).

I remember starting playing 2 weeks prior to its release, my mate said it‚Äôs not worth it to buy packs because there is a new expansion coming soon
---
r/woooosh
---
Have you ever played charged Devilsaur?
---
I mean, I love KFT. It was an awesome set and the introduction of hero cards was an amazing idea. I think the main issue is just that the cards on the whole were so powerful that they forced out quite a few other options, much like Naxxramas, GVG, and MSG of old. People don't like when one particular set defines the meta for long periods of time. I think that, at least in wild, KFT will eventually be regarded as one of the best sets in Hearthstone's history.
---
That being said, I'm also excited for the new standard meta beginning tomorrow! RoS looks like it's going to be strong, but with fewer ubiquitous cards compared to the Year of the Mammoth sets.
---
I meant copies of Vargoth :)
---
they could still implement this by giving cards a hidden 'tag' field that was searchable.

They should put the Europe time in CEST to confuse as few people as possible. Literally only one country in Europe uses GMT timezone. Basically all others use CEST, except for Russia
---
Given that when I came back in September 18 to no Witchwood cards, and a relatively new Boomsday set I had two options:    
---
* dust my Wild cards so I could still play standard with a budget Odd Rogue but not play Wild.    
---
* keep my old cards and not have a remotely good deck in either format.   
---
I'm unsure as to whether I'll keep my Ungoro and Frozen Throne cards since as a recent F2P it definitely helps when trying to stay relevant in standard to just accept you can't have the best of both worlds. But at some point I've got to start keeping Wild cards if eventually I want to play that format. It'll just require me to also spend dust on lots of the older epics and legendaries rather than using those to push beyond rank 5 in standard.
---
His review actually is really good here. This is why a star system for reviewing ANYTHING is never going to be accurate. If you listen to what he's said, he knows exactly why this card could be strong and how strong it would be, he just thought the decks that could run Keleseth would not be meta. He was very close to nailing it.
---
?
---
OUT OF MY JUNGLE :(
---
can you share the tips for akali war drum? i found it very hard to win with that shrine
---
Woof, 6 turns just to get it to playableish is still pretty rough. Seems like a real wonky card to balance, which probably means it will be forever untouched. Not like they've ever once made an unplayable card playable through buffs anyway, they make a bad design choice and sit with it.
---
You still can. It's no different than not having her at all, and this way she's 400 dust cheaper. I should state I am in no way/shape/form encouraging this behavior (even though I do it myself but I spend, so bad influence) but owning a leggo already shouldn't really dis-encourage making one golden if you really enjoy using it.
---
Hagatha is one of my favorite heroes easily, and getting all golden spells is just satisfying, so 3.2k dust is worthwhile for a class I plan on playing very often this upcoming rotation for my next 500 wins.

I think it's supposed to be a Sethrak from BfA - https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sethrak#/media/File:Sethrak_concept_art.jpg

There goes my main hunter deck üòí

Probably boom and kalecgos. I got most of the good legendaries from pre-order but I‚Äôm missing those two. Rafaam is going to be fun but ultimately suck.
---
I agree with this. Honestly though, if people really want to dust their rotating cards, then that's fine. But I don't want to hear those people complaining later on when they can't be as competitive in Wild tavern brawls or complaining about the price/unavailability of wild packs and cards months down the line. You get to freely choose what you want to do, and it's not Blizzard's fault to subsidize any regret for decisions that you may have made.
---
I want to own that I missed the joke here. Sorry.

Mate don't, Moorabi will be part of the tier SSS deck that will sweep the meta in 2032 when Return to Knights of the Frozen Throne hits the game

I have plenty of dust and I‚Äôm still waiting. ‚ÄúFun meme‚Äù cards lose their charm after about the tenth time you use them, so I don‚Äôt see any point in wasting resources on them without even a reasonable suspicion that they‚Äôll have the winrate necessary for their ‚Äúfun meme‚Äù characterisic to even be enjoyable. 
---
A card/deck has to have at least around a 40% win rate no matter what, or you‚Äôll never even have opportunities to meme out with it. You‚Äôll just spend match after match losing by turn 6 before any shenanigans can get started up.

the mods did provide a countdown timer on the sidebar for all servers.

the only thing this post is useful is for people who are browsing on the mobile app where it's hard to see it.
---
Why CST is used to Asia and China?
---
Definitely agree. I never play standard though, so there's that. Wild is just way more fun imho, but everyone has their preference of course.
---
Derp. Yep, my bad. Thanks for correcting!
---
Agreed, been playing since Beta and this mightve been my favorite.
---
I've been on a block user marathon this week.  Slowly weeding out these karma bots. Have my upvote sir.

Fair enough, I never noticed that.

Not yet.

The Fiery War Axe nerf was more important to ending Pirate Warrior than anything else.

Kalecgos and Khadgar

That was the run where I realized that simply picking synergy wasn't good enough. I needed to round my deck with removal for the times that I was behind on the board. I think the best Sidekick card was the one cost rush that could discover dragons. It's really helpful for both generating value and for killing opponents shrines early in the game.
---
This is how you know it's official rules text.
---
Elementals are my favorite tribe and I love Dino's also. My favorite expansion (theme wise) for those reasons. RIP.
---
Are there any good draw mechanics for Warlock that you plan on using to get these Legendaries out of your deck? Asking for a friend.
---
Damn, Mill Rogue isn't viable in Wild at all anymore? I guess Mechathun really killed that archetype. That's the  main thing I'd go back to wild to play.
---
&gt;When did you start playing?
---
Beta squad woot woot!
---
&gt;What's your best rank?
---
Either 3 or 5, I honestly can't remember.

&gt;How much have you spent total?

Way too fucking much... Lets say between 2.2 to 3k, possibly more.
---
LIGHT THE FUSES
---
I am referring to freedom time, not metric time
---
anhhh, it will go baack
---
Who the fuck is gonna miss Keleseth? Screw that card
---
It's not just a lack of draw, it's also a lack of burn. Not to mention that it's a gimmick deck; a one-trick pony. The early game secret shenanigans have to be absolutely and unavoidably oppressive or the deck will just fall apart, and frankly if people are underestimating divine favor, they are also overestimating these new cards.
---
Unfortunately they were overshadowed by the absurd amount of unfair cards printed more recently.
---
I played the Vargoth deck of wonders deck and it sent me to -3, then gave me 3 armor, then cast tree of life. I still died
---
That's why it says "some"
---
Why isnt The Lich King a classic card ?
---
Ok, finally looking over the old cards to see if anything looks out of place.
---
**Neutral**
---
Daring Reporter: How is this rated the same as Ogre Magi?  The spell-damage effect on Magi almost never comes into play, and Reporter very easily can live for more than one turn or not be removed.  There's no possible way these two cards are even close to comparable.
---
Backroom Bouncer: Same thing.  You give like 20-30 points to something that might not happen, like drawing a card if there's spell damage on the board, but when you got things that will and often happen, you get 3 points over a generic 4/4 in Tanaris Hogchopper, and lower than something that almost never matters like Spell Damage on the Ogre Magi.  
---
Violet Teacher: Exactly how many spells are you factoring in with this?  Cause, it's better than Sen'Jin, its better than Abberant Berserker, and its one of those things where, I know how good this card is, and usually, its not much more than a 3/5, where I'd rather have an always effect like Taunt/more attack over summoning tokens on occasion.
---
Hozen Healer: 96?  Considering how powerful the effect is and can be, only 96?  I get a 2/6 body is weak, but I thought in the range of Travelling Healer/SHroombrewer would make more sense.
---
Burgle Bully: Compare this to Streetwise Investigator: How often do you actually see stealthed minions?  It happens, on rare occasion, but it barely happens.  People still use spells, and if you have any sort of board control this is going to generate coins as people will have to use spells to get back in the game.  I don't get how its less common people will use spells than it is to not only reveal stealth minions, but do something to stealth minions.
---
Nerubian Prophet: How is this not a premium card?  In your opening hand, its a 3 mana 4/4, better than any other 3-drop in the game, and that's the downside of it.  This card wins games so many times by being a 1 or 0 mana 4/4 which is such a massive tempo swing that people can't come back from it.  Seeing it at a 103, when we know its a super powerful card, is just wrong.
---
**Druid**
---
Jade Idol: Is there something wrong with the tier list where they assume you're drafting Jades in Druid?  I can almost get Jade Blossom as it took forever to get the algo to like Greedy Sprite, but how is this so much higher than other 1 mana 1/1s?
---
Feral Rage: I think you guys always rated this low, and I never got why.  3 mana to remove a 3 or 4 drop, even with face damage, is fine, the Armor does bail your ass out a decent amount, no idea why it would be considered a below average to bad card.  Average, sure, but this is just too low for the versatility it provides.
---
Call of the Wild: This has to be big card penalty, right?  CotW post-nerf was always the #1 card in Hunter in every single tracking metric of Hunter success, so to see it not a 160 is shocking.
---
**Rogue**
---
Anub'ar Ambusher: This might be a personal preference thing, but you could knock 100 points off the card's score and I'd still feel weird about it.  I absolutely hate this card because, even if I free-kill their 4-drop, I can't play anything because it'll just bounce whatever I play back to my hand, so instead of being a 4 mana 5/5, it becomes a 6, 7, even 9 mana 5/5 when I do nothing because it will die and waste my mana.  Keening Banshee was a 139 (not sure if over 140 for Rogue), and this card, which completely fucks up your T5 play, is rated higher than Banshee.  Even in the 7th bucket, I would almost never pick this, so I don't get how this is one of the best cards in Rogue with how much it can and will screw you over.
---
**Shaman**
---
Jade Spirit: Compared to Druid, you are much, much more likely to pick Jades in Shaman.  However, the card is only worth 1 point more than in Druid, even though you should end up with much more synergy.  That seems like something's off with the card.
---
**Warlock**
---
Darkshire Councilman: I get this card on T3 not being the absolute best card, espcially if your opponent plays a 2 and you miss a 2.  But, this card is game winning on its own.  And its rated worse than a simple 3/3.  There has to be something wrong here, its 5 health so its hard to remove, its very easy to be huge later in the game, if you have any initiative this becomes a better Banshee in terms of overstatted minions, a 91 is just wrong for this.  Like, in no way, shape, or form, is Rafaam's Scheme better than this.
---
**Warrior**
---
Grimestreet Pawnbroker: I remember this being like one of the most broken cards in Warrior last time.  Is it just that Warriors won't have great weapons?
---
=================================================================
---
Separate part for Legendaries since I'm looking at them last.
---
Y'Shaarj: I assume late-game penalty?  Not much here, just considering its effect, I figured it'd be a lot higher.
---
Corrupted Hogger: The card is pretty much guaranteed to be a 7 mana 8/8 in stats, with some taunt, with a lot of potential to go higher than that, so I don't get how this is rated so low.  Compared to Ettin or Bog Creeper, I'd easily take this over either of those.
---
Soggoth: Considering how high Mastadon and Sleepy Dragon were rated, I'm shocked this is this low.  You're giving up 1/1 in stats to Mastadon, but you're guaranteeing this card can't be hard removed by spells.  I figured this would be at least a 100.
---
Fandral: I assume 15 is a bug.
---
Cenarius: Considering how well this card performs for top tier player and average players, this feels extremely low.  Like, this vs. Splintergraft, doesn't matter the deck, its Cenarius no hesitation or consideration.
---
Anomalus: I saw elsewhere that its a bug.
---
Rag Lightlord: I get its big, but considering its stablization effect, that it can heal itself if it gets damaged, that it can heal other things if they're damaged, I don't get how this is not a top tier legendary, how in any way this is 30 points worse than Don Han'Cho.
---
Raza the Chained: Are you aware that the card was nerfed to make your hero power cost 1?  The card imagine you show on the screen has it at the old value of 0.  The score also seems real high to make your hero power 1 considering the limitations.
---
Hobart Grapplehammer: This also used to be insanely high on the algo.  Were things fixed behind the scenes to bring it down to normalcy?
---
Bye bye taunt warrior. Thanks for getting me gold border
---
You're much better off to put in an [[Astral Tiger]], and as someone who runs an Astral Tiger/Hadronox/Undatakah deck, it's still not great.

I actually heard the sounds in my head when I read this

Really glad you enjoyed it! Rumble Run definitely took a beating here on Reddit prior to the balance patch, but we think it did a good job of capturing the feel of big champions clashing in overpowered combat. Congratulations on mastering the Gurubashi Arena!

Is it just un goro rotating out?
---
I'm HesAPirate, it's been a few hours so i dont remember this match specifically but i lost to an early crab a couple of times last night.
---
I play as shaman, and I cant wait for shaman class to rise from the last place. I dont think it will be with these murlocs, but I may be wrong. I dont want it to be too opressive like in the days of Tunnel Trogg or pre nerfed Shudderwock. But Hagatha is just epic value now.

See you on ladder.

Un'goro, Frozen throne, and kobolds

You're 12 and your brain isn't fully developed yet. Why did you feel the need to tell us? Just curious.

Pls no vore in my Christian card game

Chapeau! That got refreshingly dark fast.

Someone do one with Zilliax

Yeah i regret dusting some nax cards now i keep them all

Nobody expects the Spanish Fin-quisition!!

lol wut, he missed an e

You know to much

Off to artifact gulag with you
---
Rogue is good, it's just showing badly in stats like this one because it has literally a dozen archetypes, and some are very meme. Thief rogue and Malygos are very popular despite the winrates
---
Oof that sucks dude it's either a high roll or a low roll with that card I swear üòÇ
---
(Also thank you for not being a toxic piece of shit)
---
Ah yes who wont miss coin prince or turn 1 dire mole into crackling.. good memories. Such a fun and balanced meta
---
silence priest will be sick
---
How many times will people ask this? Play wild or dust them. (Wild is better than standard tho)
---
You don't have to say goodbye... you can always play Wild
---
I don‚Äôt remember those, was it just putting bars over the eyes?
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of stuff about this, what does it actually mean
---
Thief rogue looks spicy
---
shit meme but at least I know now what magnetic does lol

flodgrisen#2934 EU, trading 80g quest. I show you go first

Lol pogo rogue op
---
I am finishing my own. This is the last I am missing. Still Warrior and Paladin to go!
---
Wait. Please tell me you are joking with your "you're" correction. The Russian doll of irony would be insane if you are really dumb enough to think "you're" is correct here.
---
Portugal uses WET... but the offset is 0, so is equal to GMT, now they are on WEST and Britain and Ireland on BST. But you are wrong there is one country in Europe that is in GMT... Iceland, they have GMT all year and also Greenland (not a country).
---
Guys, I don't care enough to fight this fight myself but please keep up the good work.
---
Can also make pogo, tak works in both
---
Un'Goro Crater is coming sooner than later
---
I think its a real problem, not a meme. Consistancy is important for the future of the card game.
---
Magic doesn't have this problem, and it has helped them stick around for decades.
---
Caverns get one last kick to the curb üòÇ
---
So what you're saying is Chef Nomi isn't a day 1 craft...?
---
something about a tiny peepee i think
---
it has anti-synergy with paladins hero power
---
yes you got it right.
---
k
---
If that‚Äôs true, then that would mean the next set is Old Gods, which means 4 mana 7/7.
---
US servers used to release earlier than other regions. Sometimes, bugs and nasty things happened, so they got compensated with free packs after fixing them. Other regions had smoother releases, so there was no need for compensations. So, obviously, Europeans often complained about the lack of free packs, and a meme was born.
---
If old secret paladin taught me anything it will be a midranges build running 11-13 secrets. With that number masked is simply a good card even if it's just to thin the deck out faster
---
Oh wow I did not know that, I guess that shows that Rafaam is actually pretty good
---
The site doesn't seem to know how to design for web but it's a fun read nonetheless.
---
It‚Äôs GOLD, Jerry!
---
If you end up with enough dusk to craft a legendary after opening your packs, I'd recommend crafting [Whizbang the Wonderful](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Whizbang_the_Wonderful)  
---
  
---
By adding him to a deck, your deck will be a random recipe(pre-built) deck from the newest expansion. It will allow you to try out a lot of decent decks with very little commitment.
---
U can craft until 1pm est tomrrow once the xpac is active u cannot anymore
---
Considering "knights of the FUCKING throne" was my go-to reaction for a turn 7 Bonemare, I can't really blame you for reading it that way.
---
He's ovedoing the voice. He'd be more underestandable if he spoke normally.
---
Thanks Benny
---
I mean I still think the combo is garbage, but most of those points apply to any combo deck, so they prove nothing.
---
Thanks
---
The other picks are 1 mana so they generate less tempo. You can‚Äôt drop them alongside another 1 drop on turn 1/alongside a 2 drop with coin. Sanguine Reveler could be interesting if you have enough token fodder but is hard to use early and tiller is just a worse leper gnome most of the time.
---
Foul-mouthery!
---
Look whom is talking...
---
I could see just a casual midrange shaman deck with a few windfury minions and bloodlust, people always find some weird combo 'otk' decks that are either convoluted, just bad in terms of resources or b7sted as fuck.
---
Go play a different game there's a ton of cards in the game that you won't consider "healthy"
---
I can't see anything except fatigue, "valuemeta" is CoolStoryBob.
---
How come no one ever posts this stuff about puzzle lab?
---
Something tells me that Faceless rager is going to be nasty, especially if old school handlock with ancient watchers makes a comeback.
---
We even get an orphan!  I like this healthy change.
---
\*its
---
Jerk. He should've let you at least attack with the Dankness.
---
Level x + level y = level z
---
Stardust Dragon time.
---
Why did this guy just post half my decks?
---
Many decks are far off from good builds, try to be pro or semi-pro at least, don't ddos us with 38 decks, half of them stolen half of them unpractical.
---
It, being the rules text here, not the card.
---
"I'll be satiaified if you can provide just one interaction difference" is about the most pretentious thing I've heard all week so congrats to that. 
---
But if it concerns ye majesty, there is nary a difference betwixt echo and "repeatable this turns" other than their names. 
---
Dost this please m'Lord?
---
I welcome the change, but I primarily play odd mage and I'm sad cause I think the deck is really fun.
---
But I'm looking forward to see what it's going to be like once it officially launches. I'm pretty excited!
---
In the US packs cost the same for me on iOS as it does anywhere else.
---
Do not craft any cards you currently have in non golden. There is no benefit. 
---
Only craft missing playable copies, in golden if you have the dust.
---
Because you can easily just look those answers up. No challenge if it's the same answer every time
---
Not sure about iOS, but for Android we can't buy 60 packs, we can only do up to 40.
---
I can hear the sax
---
At that point, they were probably mad they wasted half an hour.
---
Craft the golden legendaries, they will give you the most dust profit
---
At this point I more look forward to his hearthstone stuff than his Overwatch stuff. Its memey and casual but most of all just fun to watch
---
I totally agree ! But still confused on one aspect though..
---
 What do i do with the pack fillers ? Should i DE them ?
---
Why would I play a different game when Lich king is rotating out tomorrow along with more cards that are unhealthy to the game? (Baku, genn, Bloodreaver guldan and frost lich jaina just to name a few)Telling people to find a different game when they bring up a good point against a card you like is never a good argument.
---
My priority are cards that create other cards or similar aesthetic effects. Genn and Baku both give you a new hero power, and if they are gold, your hero power becomes golden. 
---
The other cards that are being HOF don‚Äôt contribute to that one rule I have. So they don‚Äôt take priority
---
Cuz girls don't play video games.
---
Yeah this would never happen
---
Yeah a 2 mana 3/2 is decent. Beast/murloc synergy makes it good. Rush makes it amazing!
---
I‚Äôm hesitant to call it OP, because a lot of the time it‚Äôs a 2 mana 1/1 deal 2 damage to a minion which is decent, but not broken.
---
Good luck partner! I found the extra mana crystal from the start gave me sizable leads in terms of aggression if that helps!
---
Zero golden legendaries for me :(
---
Oh yes I love him. Usually they either have to make bad trades, do nothing or waste removal on a 2 drop. I also like him because the art reminds me of when I was really into WoW and A snail was one of my most used pets.
---
I did forget that difference. Same on iOS.
---
Hm, might not be intended, but then again, very nice pun.
---
You got this!
---
You‚Äòre right. I meant this doom from the old gods. Somehow I thought it‚Äòs still in, Too bad.
---
Don't be stupid.
