I don't really play standard, but vicious syndicate has [this](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/deck-library/hunter-decks/midrange-hunter/token-midrange-hunter/) and [this](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/meatis-miracle-mechathun-druid/) in the most recent report.

I could imagine purity support. I can't image support for this garb.

Perfectly balanced like all games should be.
---
lol I vsed a druid yesterday, found 2 twigs on the first turn into tyarntus, opponent was not amused 
---
Yes I did.  You listed 9 legendaries and costed them at 14,400 dust.  Two of those legendaries were from adventures, thus they shouldn't have been included in your total of 14,400 dust.
---
Nah those just clear my board of large taunts and/or hit me in the face after the zuljin has finished doing his summoning.
---

---
I'm not making stuff up. You can even check Vicious Syndicate/Tempo Storm. After the Spirit Claws nerf Shaman dropped off the map, and didn't get a Tier 2 deck till KoFT, and even then Token Shaman was tier 2 at best. Don't trust your memory. Literally just look up Tier lists from VS/TS which are based on actual play rates. 
---
Learn to love arena. F2P, didn't start playing until after TGT, I've taken a year off and a handful of several month breaks, and I can still craft 4 or 5 t1 decks each expansion. I don't know if I've *ever* bought a pack, it all just goes into arena tickets. Sitting on 2000 gold at the moment as it is anyway.
---
using the same deck, i once concede 5 time in a row before i can met hunter again
---
Zoo several times, aggro Shaman (iirc it was the best deck in the game legendary free for a whole expansion), midrange shaman were all wildly cheap.
---
Don't look at tempostorm for literally anything. The tiers they put their decks in are only slightly less insane than the example decklists they give.
---
"an otk that requires no fucking skill"
---
You're talking about one of the hardest decks to play.

Surprised Hunter is so low. It worked out great for me. Hero power to deal 2 damage even if you get crap cards was pretty good.

Wow thats a throwback, i remember when that video came out 
---
It was so hilarious especially since im german myself
---
I'll tell you why I was so quick to shame people here.
---
You don't have very long to wait, before the very next person here writes things like:
---
- "Blizzard just isn't what they used to be"
---
- "lol HS is such spagetti code"
---
- "Blizzard can't even get card text descriptions right, says a lot about how awful this game was coded"
---
- "I can do better than them. hell even a 10 year old can make a better card game"
---
See that last point there? Yes it was said many a time around here. That just the everyday, average redditor can, on his own...write a far superior code base, draw better art, and voice better voice-acting, market and sell the game far better than a game company with people who have spent decades doing their craft.
---
And they can do it for less, and make the game completely and entirely free to play in every aspect.
---
So that's why I'm calling them out on it. Hey look. Far be it from me to say they can't - who I am to judge?
---
Let's remember together it really wasn't very long ago, that Blizzard was once a small little company called Condor, comprised of Morhaime with a few computer science students(and a few who were not - Chris Metzen had no marketable skills whatsoever). All they had was the the desire to make video games, and a dream. That's it.
---
And look what we have here. It's lightning in a bottle all over again. Brode and the other guys who are dreaming big and shooting for the moon.
---
So when you say "would like, and "can actually do" - actually...don't underestimate the willpower of people who want the good ol' days back. The legendary days of the original developers of *Starcraft*, who were so dedicated to coding the game that they even **brought in their laptop with them, to the delivery room** while their wife gave birth.
---
All of you bemoaning oh Blizzard was so much about gamers before Activision took over. Ohhhh they actually made games worth a damn but that was 20 years ago. Well guys here you go. It's ex-Blizzard's brightest and finest and oh look - before Activision. Exactly everything that you wanted.
---
So what are you waiting for? Just because you're international doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Brode *will fly you over*, and shoot for the moon if he felt you were the right guy.
---
Tough beats when you kann nicht angreifen but wins anyway.
---
I really don't see how you can say "This has nothing to do with Blizzard/Hearthstone/Digital Card Games/etc." when Ben Brode, the popular ex-Hearthstone lead/personality, is a founder along with an ex-Hearthstone executive producer and several other ex-Hearthstone people.

The orc shaman Gul'dan was originally a shaman.
---
[Gul'dan backstory](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Gul%27dan)
---
I’m playing corpsetakers instead of piloted shredders and flying machines instead of upgradeable framebots. It’s a real kit, works well in shaman too (power mace ftw). Looking forward to trying it in warrior and rogue.
---
Though not specified, there are rules of that Shaman Hero Power:
---
1) It will summon 1 out of the 4 unique basic totems that is not in play already.
---
2) All summons are random unless you already have 3 out of 4 of the unique basic totems in play, then it would 100% summon the remaining one.
---
3) You cannot Hero Power once all 4 basic totems are in play.
---
Generally these are not noticeable as you rarely get to summon all 4 basic totems but in certain occasions this could matter, e.g. 
---
&gt; a) when you have [[Tuskarr Totemic]] and need double spell damage totem for lethal, then you should Hero Power before playing Tuskarr Totemic for the chance of double totem.
---
&gt; b) you have a healing totem in hand and desperately need a taunt totem to save yourself, then you should Hero Power after playing the healing totem from your hand.
---
as has been stated multiple times. Representation does not also mean performance. Hunter is represented cause its relatively cheap and there are multiple archetypes.
---
&gt; I hope you guys become the new Old Blizzard
---
I hope they become the new Old Blizzard for 15-20 years and then merge with a large corporation, and then slowly bleed their brands out by gradually shifting their focus onto short-term profits.
---
VS puts it in tempo rogue, check their latest report. It’s also in big rogue in wild, per tempostorm.
---
I didn't think of that. Granted, I only ever play on PC.
---
True balance is no balance. Give your players Cheat Shop and 16 digit attack numbers. 
---
exousic#1139 NA, trading gold

If you took time to read about deck archetypes instead of  complaining on reddit, you’d become a better player. Now you’re just left tilted and pissed at a bunch of people who were sharing common knowledge. Gg, well played. 
---
I thought it was Counter Strike.
---
A good analogy (if we can manage to legitimately and seriously put the prequelmemes aside for a moment) is that the Star Wars Prequels are incredibly polished but they are not great movies.
---
Oh really. That’s weird. When I go into one of my saved decks and click the portrait it brings it up for me. 
---
It could be used as a neutral dampener on burn decks, since it probably pulls meaningful damage off your face as long as the board is uncontested.
---
Brode seems like a smart guy. He probably realized blizzard wasn’t paying him what he could make elsewhere. Based on them being funded by marvel and this sub generally agreeing to buy anything he sells... it seems he was probably right. 
---
What about the card which remove your whole deck before use the academic espionage? and You dont use Edwin? 
---
Pretty heavy handed nerfs I would say, they sunk the class completely, but I’m honestly glad they are gone for a while. 
---
They had some of the most oppressive and mind numbingly boring decks to play against for what felt like an eternity. So a break from them is more than welcomed.
---
Odd paladin and zoolock are probably the cheapest decks currently
---
What about Edwin? And the card which draw the whole deck? To use after Espionage, uhm... This is very difficult to set up IMO
---
Mage has wide board clear, that’s how it is. That’s how that class gets to work. Hunter doesn’t. Hunter however has pretty good single target removal. Deadly shot, baited arrow, kill command, etc. Mage doesn’t get single target remove cards. Great into this new hunter meta. Bad against super common Lich King, twilight drake, anything that has high health. You lost 2 games in a row because you are playing a deck that is weak to it. Play a deck that can deal with it and you won’t have a problem.
---
there’s a gadget and the two fans as well. 
---
elekk and shark sound good, but really they’re just overkill. you’re never really gonna need to shuffle that much into your deck, so they’d just be taking up spots for cards that could help you survive
---
PS4 isn’t doing that though. It has some of the best exclusive single player experiences, with no micro transactions.

The mod responded and they made an exception this time because of certain reasons.

---
Loatheb is fantastic in wild, proably in all my wild decks. 
---
Aggro decks are fine for fast ranking, greedy big priest you should blow out 2/3 games. Spell hunter is popular too some anti secret tech should let you overrun it pretty well.
---
I don't see why you can't get to rank 5 with a classic zoolock. I tend to play secret mage/hunter and discardlock all of which I can get to rank 2-3 with without too much trouble

Both definitely viable cards and I have used both. Myra’s unstable element (draw your deck) is a nice last ditch effort card. It’s so high cost, and this is essentially a miracle rogue deck so you already have last ditch efforts as your deck so it’s not commonly run. Edwin on the other hand is very common and a good big drop. I don’t really like him but I last played this in a meta where an Edwin could get killed a lot easier than this hunter meta and was usually useless, but it’s up to you if you wanna run it, maybe it can survive now, I really haven’t tinkered with it much recently so maybe your testing can help me.
---
But what decides which one goes and which one remains?
---
Answer : RNG
---
nice! still have my first, a golden jarraxus. only other one i have is golden tyrantus. 
---
I genuinely enjoy watching Reckful get, well, Recked.
---
Just because she’s evil doesn’t mean she’s a warlock. 
---
I totally would if I had it haha. I call this deck of mine a combo stealer deck because I try to play their entire combo with talanji before they can
---
yeah the order they’re played matters because that’s the order the deathrattles will trigger. he needed the Abomination’s 5 damage to hit his Mecha’thun and kill it. Meaning he needed to play the Coffin Crasher first, so it dies first, summons Mecha’thun, and then the abom’s 5 damage kills it for the win.
---
It can be tricky!
---
congrats! i think i was around 80 when i got my first, it is not that easy a lot of times. first was with the armor warrior and ive done 9 in total now. 
---
Which control decks got nerfed? The only one I can think of is Kingsbane but that does not really qualify as control deck. Druid was almost all combo, Shudderwock was combo, Odd Pali was aggro.
---
picking bad classes was the goal here, unfortunately if your opponent did the same thing you’re both wrestling with trash haha
---
watching boarcontrol play this was fun. it started as a meme and then he just kept winning
---
They're both correct answers
---
No it wasn't. Each given card had a fixed order, but you had to know which cards took precedence, hence the formalisation during naxx to make it based on play order.
---
right, but Misdirection is the actual name of the card haha
---
Same :( I was so disappointed. Never going to actually play that card in any format
---
I Psychic Screamed a couple of Spirit of the Dead totems into a Druid’s deck right before he got off the combo. Turns out you can’t kill them or get rid of them since they’re 0/3s. He plopped down MechaThun anyway though which actually was a huge problem cuz then I’d had to deal with a stream of 1-mana 10/10s... ‘cept that’s why I run Mind Control too :)
---
Only an incident with trying to pass Monster Hunter Online through the censorship committee without showing the full game. The stuff about LOL/PUBG getting banned were all fabricated.

dont do it. You get free packs on your way to 25. Skipping makes you miss out on them.
---
Ha! Classic Stephen.
---
I've found that it only recognizes the code from the Collection screen if you go to the Colelction screen, tab out, copy the code, and then tab back in. If you already have a code sitting the clipboard when you start Hearthstone or w/e, you have to click "new deck" and then it'll usually recognize it.
---
Ok, it's just that my friends is like rank 19 and they started at rank 25 :/
---
You can skip by going into your settings, theres an option called "skip to rank 25" i think
---
They changed it at some point. New players nowadays start at rank 50. Believe me with a brand new account you dont want to be at 25. Especially since you get some freebies. Just grind your way to 25. Since you cant lose stars its not that big of a deal.
---
Yeah, i see it but im good. Want those packs
---
At least its not Mayor Noggenfogger who I tried out in  casino mage deck before realizing that a 9 mana 5/4 was not good enough.

Druid is no longer running the meta.  Good.  Druid looks like an utter disaster, especially after rotation.  Bad.  Kingsbane players got dicked, dust-wise.  Bad.  Kingsbane doesn't exist in Wild anymore.  Good...? (I don't play Wild but it seems like a lame deck.)
---
Great content! Earned my sub! Looking forward to more in-depth analysis of different decks :)
---
Has anyone done an analysis of rotation impact on his discover probabilities? People are getting way more 'rush /lifesteal' 'rush/poison' vs previous history. Thats the main problem, imo. 
---
They wont nerf it cause it is a legendary and rotating soon. They might nerf Zuljin or play dead. 
---
Game is so awful now, wow. 
---
Yes. Doesn't matter which order the EOTs trigger, either it gets healed for zero, then killed; or killed then no longer considered a character to be healed.
---
Reckful in 2019 lol.  
---
I hit legendary when I grow the boot
---
Yes it is 
---
If you would've totemed first the totem would've died because it was summoned first which mean its end of turn effect would trigger first then geddon 
---
Depends on play order 
---
People may disagree with OP but people seem to forget that jaina is actually broken lol
---
I could be wrong but don't games made in Unity that have the license paid for not have to splash the big "Made in Unity" logo at the start just games that use the free version? That's why people associate it with shitty asset flips and other half assed games.
---
I mean if you're gonna look at it like that don't forget it cost the opponent two mana and a card too which technically could make it a better Phantom Militia.
---
But that 2 mana secret worked towards 5 mana 4 3/3s so it kinda sucks again.

No, they don't. It's a flat 50% chance to attack something else

When Rexxar and spell stone rotates this is honestly the only chance spell Hunter has of being any good at all, no need for a nerf.

Play midrange Hunter. And add inspector and flare. Total of 4 secret removal.

If you're talking pure relativity kinda, but otherwise this would only be true if economics were a zero-sum system, which it is thankfully not. (We'd all have to share the same pool of money that existed 2,000+ years ago across a fraction of our population if that were the case, which obviously we don't.)   
---
Only for people who knows Hearthstone, a person who wanted to find out if it's a real game, might be turned off. 
---
Dunno I see it about like those idiots who edit jokes into wikipedia. 
---
You’re missing the point a bit I think which is that the middle is gone. People used to call control warrior “wallet warrior” because it was extraordinarily expensive and you had a good amount of decks that were on the middle. Middle cost decks largely don’t exist any more.
---
Even those decks you listed are often more expansive than equivalents in the past. Odd rogue needs Baku, Leeroy, Edwin, Myra’s unstable element and two vilespines. That’s 7000 dust! That would be a middle cost deck, probably on the high end of middle cost once, but now it’s considered cheap. When this game launched I had a pretty good midrange shaman deck that ran either one epic, or later one legendary instead, and that was it. Aggro decks existed with Leeroy as their only legendary and some even cut him, like aggro shaman.
---
There is one more part to it too - a lot of the extra legendaries and epics we need now fit only one deck, so your ability to fill out multiple decks at once is severely diminished.
---
i already won this game a long time ag
---
Either that or Poe’s Law.
---
Certainly not by following my „tips“ I’d assume
---
I mean, he's not wrong...
---
OP's talking about the patch in the bottom right.
---
That hero power's pretty terrible for this brawl.
---
I usually stay around rank 5-3 each month on my main account, but I just created a new f2p account yesterday. The rewards for new players is great right now. Right now you get 6 packs of Rastakhan's Rumble cards, a legendary, 2 loas and 3 classic packs each time you hit ranks 45, 40, 35, and 30. You also get 10 packs once you hit rank 25. In addition, you can easily get another legendary by playing the first step of the icecrown solo adventure as well. So by the time you hit rank 25 you would have earned yourself at least 28 packs. With all that being said, you should keep your old account but create a new one and try it out. New player benefits are great right now!
---
Triple boot is the way to legend.
---
Crafting is probably a better route, but if you need dust then you’ll have to drop green on packs. That said, while Rumble brought some good dragons and dragon synergy cards, I think most of the key control priest dragons are from sets that are rotating (duskbreaker for instance). Even though you’ll want that card, I’d stick to buying classic packs and stuff from Year of the Raven, and then craft anything you still need from the rotating sets with your leftover dust. (If you spend $100 you should have the equivalent of a few legendaries I would think). 
---
But as you craft keep in mind a bunch of cards (Anduin, duskbreaker, psychic scream, etc) will be rotating in two or so months. 
---
Also, if you are gonna drop that much money, you might want to look into the Amazon coins method of buying packs. You’ll get a discount based on how much you spend. But you’ll need an Android device with the Amazon AppStore or an emulator to actually purchase with Amazon coin. Google it, there are plenty of walkthroughs in how to make it happen.

my guess is he used unstable evolution on the mountain giant over and over since he has the totem where spells cost 2 less, rolled a mana wyrm off evolving a totem

I think this could mean blizzard has a descendant!!

Thats what you get Activision!!
---
I disagree. 
---
Proper card back is essential in psychologically tilting the opponent leading to a win.
---
As a man who got to legend (once), I think propose choice of a card back was essential for my success.
---
/s (just in case)
---
I would try not to dust any legendaries until they are rotated out of Standard (last 2 years of expansions + Standard). They may not be relevant now, but they could be relevant in future expansions and dusting them is a huge loss (400 dust  vs 1600 to create).
---
I would try and build decks around the legendaries you have opened or budget versions the decks you want to play. Trying to copy a particular deck when just getting into the game can be very expensive in both dust and $$$.
---
Thanks!
---
Azor#11603 NA looking for quest trade 
---
Become? It has always been this way since beta. Things like Molten OTK are nothing new.
---
Ummmm, it was already addressed. When the card came out people (like the ones on reddit) complained it had a limited beast pool which were great to begin with and was "bugged" to not include the beast from current expanions. They fixed it to include all beast that qualify (with exceptions with ones with long text) and added cheap beasts with rush, lifesteal etc. and now people are complaining again. Oh well. 
---
How exactly is odd quest warrior worse or even remotely bad against anything?

Assuming you don't play or plan to play wild:
---
I wouldn't sink significant resources in to mammoth cards (prince Keleseth). Right now I'd recommend you go odd paladin, or something else that isn't rotating several legendaries and epics you don't have
---
As for getting dust, I would look at mammoth cards you have and don't use to disenchant
---
Im really happy seen this hero cards that generate unlimited value gone, cards like Jaina, Rexxar and Valeera. Some Quest also are very powerfull too and need to go. Can't wait to see Glenn and Baku gone now.
---
I would like new Quests. Those are cool cards.
---
maybe shirvallah just really likes forging weapons, but needs to know they're only made of the best materials
---
Never lucky...
---
Ay caramba indeed!

Oh damn really?
---
Do you realize they received investment from Netease (a company running Blizzard games in China, and the company that develops Diablo: Immorta)l?
---
Their first game is a contract job from Marvel, and I doubt they will have too much freedom. It seems to me they started a game studio that will produce mobile games with MTX for other companies. The games will not be very original.
---
I'm pretty sure that it gives X+1 Health depending on the Attack of my minion. That's been my experience at least.
---
Exactly....well said.
---
Ben's appearance as everything, he was a glorified PR rep because he spent more time explaining why his mistakes were beneficial to the game and community. But hey, he has a fun laugh and did a rap, I guess we can ignore the fact that he wasn't good at his job.

Emperor Cobra comes to fuck your shit up
---
Poor you /s
---
Excellent!  Take a look at my list above.  Got any suggestions?
---
I did think about Warbears, but compared to those, felt Charged Devilsaurs were better.
---
I think its a bitter joke. Pay to win games can be frustrating. 
---
Receiving 30m from a company that loves microtransactions comes with strings attached.
---
Green and yellow are indeed very similar colours
---
/s
---
Thanks. I'll maybe try some priest builds. I presume Duskbreaker is key.
---
yes.
---
Stats on Humongous Razorleaf (its attack) do matter, because with 4 attack it can often kill the minion which triggered secret.
---
because pure rng is skill
---
Yeah, starting to learn that now, thanks. 
---
Aka Summon a 4/2 with Charge and a 2/4 that buffs other allied minions
---
no, what im actually saying is the content should be easier to access with an option to also pay for it because it is a free game, just because you exaggerate my point doesn't make you right
---
Did you upload the right file? It's got bleed marks.
---
Hello. I think $200 is going to surely be enough to reinvest in the game. Ideally, I'd try to tough it out until the next rotation in April, and focus on cards in Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan. I would personally also disenchant any bad legendaries (like obscenely terrible ones) and maybe even bad epics if you're brave to craft some cards that are guaranteed to see play.
---
Wow dude how did you get so good at hs? 
---
If I had to guess you’d need around 150 packs per expansion. You would get at least half of the cards in each set and then enough dust to craft most of what’s left.
---
Which is pretty ironic since that’s the kind of stuff r/thirdsub was mocking. 
---
No joke.
---
hmm are you fully funded?
---
&gt; (4) What type of deck is "fun" to play? It's absolutely insane. You don't like aggro because it's "brainless," you don't like OTK because it's "solitaire," so I can only assume EVERYONE on this sub likes to play control. 
---
It's almost as though the subreddit is made up of a large group of individuals who have differing opinions on what's good and bad for the game.
---
I describe a control rogue to a deck that can clear board with the intention to get late game and over value/combo to the opponent
---
Uhm, Mecha vs Hunter is not too good I think...
---
He's been able to pull if off consistently at rank 23! Just you wait in a couple of weeks he will be rank 22 lol!
---
&gt; It's almost as though the subreddit is made up of a large group of individuals who have differing opinions on what's good and bad for the game
---
My point is that the vast majority of posts seem to imply only one style of play is "good." 
---
Soo whats the probability to get a 2 or 1 health minion. 
---
I think somebody calculated it and it was between 200-300 packs per expansion. I may be wrong though. 
---
CatsGoBark#1461 NA 80g quest trade.
---
Where can I find the other classes?
---
[removed]
---
It is pretty accesible tough. New players get a shitton of free cards in the "new player ranks only" that are 50 to 25. Also, every new expansion, a legendary is gifted to everyone, along with 6 packs, that normally do contain a legendary (first 10 packs you buy from an expansion have a legendary guaranteed) so even new players have to use 0 gold for 2 legendaries and a ton of commons/rares to play with. Also, you can do the free prologe of the Knights of the frozen Throne adventure for free to get a free legendary hero card. You dont even need a deck to play the prologe.
---
With daily mision and playing 30-1 hour a day, its normally a pack per day. Thats more than enough for a player to stay F2P and competitive. Of course, day 1 or month 1 you wont have a lot to play, but the collection will be growing more and more and more the more time you are in the game, and the more expansions they release (3 a year, 2 legendaries for free from each just by being arround) so eventually you have enough to play competitive decks, and play your own built decks too with all the cards you have. Of course, this can also be accelerated by paying, but being f2p is pretty effective without having to put a lot of time into the game either (but playing once every week wont get you far, of course, but thats expected).
---
I dont know if you are really a new player or just some random dude that has been playing for a week, but the game is pretty affordable for f2p players. I understand that free players could get even more free stuff and that would be cool but the line has to be drawn somewhere and this is where its actually drawn right now. Hearthstone needs to make money, but also cater to free players so that the playerbase is high and people can get games quick. If you want a full colection, pay. If you hate the feeling of having to "constantly needing to catch up", then F2P games arent for you.
---
Why? You know ER is gonna do up to 6 damage, you know counter spell exists and freezing trap exist. WM you have zero idea. If I know his one trap is probably WM, do I attack with my big dude on the off chance he rolls a cobra and I just lose? Or do I attack with my little dude and he gets a Mukla and has board control because of it? I'm sure it's equally irritating when my small thing attacks and he rolls a 1/1 or 1/2 or something garbage. I would much rather have something consistently overstatted, even a 3/3 all the time would be fine.
---
Thanks for doing this.
---
This made me laugh though:
---
&gt; I guess I only remember the low rolls
---
Describes 90% of RNG whining on this sub. Funny how people never complain when they high roll...
---
This deck is wildly inconsistent and not good. The wild meta is incredibly strong, this is like tier 5 (meme status)
---
Unless you’re a troll and I’m falling for it...
---
It’s just standard, can see the filters on the bottom of the image 
---
I got prince liam yesterday but I ended up getting awful legendaries and still lost (to be fair I was losing pretty badly already, other dude got super lucky hallucinations)
---
Ah, my bad then.
---
Anything with [[Zentimo]]
---
It’s pretty cool! If you already use their deck tracker, it’s very easy to set up!
---
Ideally there is no reason they couldn't create it again in the f2p model though.  
---
They still target the most money earning through rng packs and arena tickets.  
---
Perhaps its deemed too much development time for little reward vs less dev time on the likes of dungeons runs and heh ... brawls.
---
It was at this moment that he knew...
---
I guess you loved running Bear Trap back in its heyday? Though I guess its not exactly the same since the bear got summoned after the attack.
---
Valeera doesn’t generate unlimited value
---
Just to be fair if you wanted every card from the start of hearthstone it would have cost you 10k$. And I’m not joking 
---
I pulled a flappy bird from WM today. It survived the attack and I won the game two turns later.
---
When I read some of the comments:
---
\&gt; Was MtG broken?
---
Yes, it has been. Multiple times. Hence the numerous card bannings throughout the games' history. When oppressive decks were allowed to dominate tournaments (For example, during Mirrodin/Kamigawa standard), tournament attendance plummeted. 
---
Ez upvote Ez
---
Still, “they” feels less disjointed than s/he
---
Blizzard don't really leave much choice for the casual spender/f2p who wants to be successful in the game though.  
---
It's either dust most of what you have to try and keep 1-3 viable decks or just sit back being mediocre for many months until you naturally build up a collection.  
---
So when the nerf bat hits hard and makes a deck/class powerlevel drop so hard it becomes unviable in ranked play then yes, people do have cause to complain and vent.  
---
I had one once that used Feign Death, but it turned out to be more consistent without a 7 mana 5/5.  
---
Thanks, I did read that Pat Nagle's nerf made it pretty much unplayable so I dusted him...but others I'm not sure.  I have Katherine Winterwisp or whatever, my best success comes with midrange hunter or even a cheap face hunter, but I rarely find she helps with what I'm trying to do (she seems slow or too expensive to me to be relevant, I'm sure I'm wrong here but it's a perception).
---
I have Velan, Lady in White, a gloop and a floop, Hagatha, Gral Shark,  Clutchmother Zavas, War Master Voon, Mulka, Tinkmaskter, Capt GreenSkin, Hogger, Marin the Fox, Nozdormu and maybe a few others.
---
If any of those seem dustable...would you mind letting me know and why?  I'd like to learn the analysis part of it.  Thanks.
---
YIKES. Three different attempts to get rid of Kripp's board and the opponent got jacked by the coinflip on all of them. Kripp would've been super salty if that happened to him lol
---
NONE WILL SURVIVE
---
And resident sleepers.
---
Oh, welp, that explains that.
---
Doesn’t help that they’re both tiger loa too.
---
What does this have to do with hearthstone?
---
Thanks for the trade.
---
Not all who wander are lost.
---
I used to be upset then I started playing Magic.
---
It's complicated, I feel it's engaging, it's not free but if you get could at drafting and constructed event you can grow your collection. I feel the free stuff they give you is way better than HS.
---
It's not perfect (5 card is kind of weird) but I actually focus on the game instead of alt-tabbing on HS writing this comment and posting memes.
---
Can't recommend it enough, there are tonnes of events and modes to play and the meta is pretty diverse. I actually watch streamers to get better instead of watching them to rage at RNG.
---
Blizzard, on the other hand, is lazy, no new game modes, super tough to start out and they take their customers for granted only communicating when they want your credit card. They're just lazy and entitled (Wotc ain't perfect either). 
---
I'd rather play a game that's growing and has a bright future than a game that's dying.
---
In aggregate, Yes. The point is that the population's win/loss rate is not guaranteed to be the experience of the individual player. One particularly famous example is APM OTK Priest which famously has something like a sub 40% win rate in the stats, but in the hands of professional players has been played in tournaments and at high legend rank with good success. The win/loss rate of the deck is a result of the number of players messing up the combo.
---
What I'm saying is this: "easy to play" decks will always have the highest AGGREGATE win rates because even poor players can play them. That doesn't mean they are "OP" or "unbalanced," it means they are uncomplicated. There can be equivalent, or even better, decks which won't achieve the same win rates in the hands of ALL players, but might in yours if you know it well and play it well. 
---
Surprised to see Spellstone that low, I assume it's just due to the mana cost (which would also explain the high winrate)
---
They have done a AMA it's a small company I believe 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7jsvm6/we_are_the_team_behind_the_wendys_twitter_account/
---
honestly though, is there actually any heathstone competitors when it comes to online cards?
---
A board this big, and a life total this small...
---
Yeah when you can homebrew a dragon deck with any class now people should be trying that instead of netdecking. I've managed to make nearly competitive to competitive one for ranks 1-5 since release, and that's just with one tribe. There are other tribes with support, new archetypes like spell shaman that have received no testing, and stuff like hand mage and fatigue warrior that people forgot about before they received lots of new support. Most people complain when they stop experimenting, and this has been the best set in a while for that.
---
There is also a huge discrepancy between what people like to play and what people in reddit like to play. In the Overwatch sub, only 17 percent of the people play DPS (according to a recent poll) while the actual number is much higher. Same with aggro in Hearthstone. And since you will get downvoted for enjoying an aggro deck or a combo deck, those people keep it quiet.
---
It's going to trickle down... people don't want to think for themselves so they take what others are saying as their own views. Then that leads to what we have right now.... enough people saying HS sucks, so now the majority is saying HS sucks. 
---
Baku is really good as it is played in Paladin, Rogue, Warrior and maybe Druid. There is also Gen which is only even cards and reduces your hero power by 1. He is played in Warlock, Paladin and Shaman.
---
Or discarding Rhok, Rexxar and Zul’jin with a single Howlfiend. I laughed at it so hard because getting upset was just pointless.
---
Serves me right, playing WM with those in hand =p
---
if youre going to craft a shaman epic i think shadow visions is the one. that card is so flexible and even though shaman sucks right now outside of even shaman i think this card will be in an upcoming meta deck
---
You've gained between 11 and 15 stars over 15 games. That's a minimum winrate of 67% without winstreaking, probably closer to 60% assuming a streak or two. Good luck keeping it above 50% past rank 15.
---
I've been enjoying Kibler playing the frogvolve decks. No zentimo he doesn't seem to add much. 
---
Hell yea.
---
It’s called a meme deck for a reason
---
There was a time when 50% of my warrior wins came from grommash (non arena)

shine#11696 NA SWAP, you first.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks
---
Ziliax has rush and costs 1 or 0, depending how much cost reduction you have room on the board for. And it also gives divine shield, life steal, and 3 attack. ;)
---
It's an OTK if you have a minion survive from a previous turn; no mechs have charge. Hence having the stealthed mech drop the turn before.
---
Ah didn't load properly, thanks.
---
Since you have all three horsemen they're probably just doing it to do it, they know they lost.
---
\&gt;  You add them, type "Wow, close game! Better luck next time xD!!!" and delete them. 
---
Honestly this sounds just as petty and salty as the person trying to rage. And also this just assumes anyone that adds you is only doing it to rage. A number of my requests have been from people who just want to have a genuine conversation or discuss our cool decks. If I did this I would have come off as a asshole to them. 
---
Replying with something as condescending as a "sigh" with the all mighty attitude when you arnt even my equal in play level is why i dont seriously debate these things whole heartedly.
---
Swaz#2831, EU, 80g trade
---
People enjoying the game are playing it, not posting on reddit
---
Well, it's not like they'd have kept printing Charge cards *instead* of Rush cards.  Charge has always presented balance problems when you look at the game over the years - Leeroy and Arcane Golem both have been nerfed, and some of the strongest strategies in the game right now involve using Carnivorous Cube to generate multiple Charge minions that can end the game quickly without allowing a response.  
---
If I had to guess, I'd say the only reason they added Rush instead of just changing the entire Charge mechanic was that it would have pissed so many people off.
---
P.S.: I will say, though, I do think aggro is *slightly* broken in Hearthstone, due to the way attackers have a very strong advantage in Hearthstone's rule system (as compared to Magic or Artifact). So board advantages tend to snowball as attacker's take preferable trades.
---
I'm an above average player and i currently rock aggro shaman at rank 5; i win like half my games and im having fun. Can i play for more than 5 games currently? no! Do i have fun playing a deck that i like? yes! Make the best out of it or just take a break ;) after DK rotation i think its going to be fun :)
---
**Card Rotation Analysis: Druid**
---
Don't play.
---
I don't like the game because I don't like the time-gate keeping me out of Legend ladder and then I don't like that Legend ladder isn't transparent with our MMR. The only representation of rank or skill in this game weighs the "time played" variable far too much.
---
Yes i agree with you. But luckily there Are stormwind knight and stonetusk boar for pulling out some amazing OTKs
---
Well hagatha is gonna last until 2020 so we have a long way to go, im so sad that shudderwock isnt getting played now, ive been testing another types of shudder but its not the same
---
Thank you very much I'll be here all week.
---
We might get one or two next year, but blizzard doesn't like charge as it lacks interactivity
---
Why is volcano here? WTF
---
I would choose bombsquad here
---
Talanji is definitely my favorite card from this last expansion. In dragon quest priest she's sooooo fun
---
People are always dissatisfied because hearthstone is fundamentally a bad game.
---
Bruh it's right before B
---
The initial release of the rogue quest, Spirit Claws, Spreading Plague, Call of the Wild, just to name a few. I think think Ultimate Infestation is one of the worst cards they've ever designed. They just decimated the rest of the druid shell enough that it doesn't matter. They regularly put broken cards out there that make no sense to seemingly most of the players.
---
Explosive Runes is 3 mana
---
Pick both of those 3
---
Hey, Shirvallah! What time is it?!?
---
Yeah you're right, actually I hesitated to include him or not, but since only its attack matters, and since you cannot do anything with it would it survive (unless maybe you're willing to use one of your owl zombeasts on it), I decided not to put it alongside the other minions. However I did at first calculate the Un'goro average stats with him included, and it didn't differ that much from the average stats without him, so I don't think including him changes the overall averages stats by a noticable margin.
---
You realize OP is the spell hunter right?
---
Rush didn't kill Charge. The team has been reducing the usage of charge for a while. If not for rush, we'd get a lot of "Charged Devilsaurs". Rush allowed them to make "attack on its first turn" cards with less words.
---
Now when they formulize "armorsteal"...
---
Usually the correct play is the one that increase your win rate the most, not the one that considers every possible high roll possible. Let’s say all that’s on the board is your full health Yeti and you know the trap is Wandering Monster. It’s almost always suboptimal to not hit face on the off chance that you’ll run into a Muklah
---
Yeah, they should maybe make an MMO based around the hearthstone cards, would be a cool idea
---
Not far off about the 10k, with my luck it would be 15k
---
