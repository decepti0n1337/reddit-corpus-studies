when I played a couple of hours ago there hadn't been any changes to the card nerfs. I'm guessing the update hasn't hit just yet.
---
---
---
Yeah, turn 2 leveled up, turn 3 hero powered and grabbed the zerus that came up, turn 4 he turned into the bear and then I sold my t1 buy and bought these guys.
---
I do not. I tried it with both Renounce Darkness and Kun, neither of which I own
---

---

---
One tier 2 Reno deck, I'm guessing you thought Reno Priest was tier 2, when in fact it's tier 4.
---
Hopefully, but knowin Blizzard, they msot likely aren't.
---
Umm ... You mean that data based report that is very good for standard but doesn't have enough data for wild? Or do you mean you use hsreplay winrate?
---
I’ve never spent more than $50 on any expansion. And $0 the last 3 expansions. I don’t have every card but I have enough cards that anytime I put in a deck code I might be missing 1-3 cards I can craft. Granted, I’ve been playing since release so I don’t have “catch up costs” of a new player, but most of the time people exaggerate the costs of this game. I’ve also taken long breaks from the game.
---
He's not trying to join the design team, he's just throwing some ideas out there. Doesn't need to be that fleshed out. It's fine as it is. You want tiers, make it yourself, instead of bitching that someone else should have done it for you.
---
Wouldn't it be a -$1798.51 return? That $1,800 is gone.
---
It just give it taunt :0
---
Well i tried removing them all and adding them manualy, nothing changed
---
I hope it would this way :
---
Someday the battle of bans brawliseum return.
---
Then everyone will get a preloaded run with their current score.
---
I didn't want to say he's probably full of shit, I just want people to think critically. But, he's lying or an idiot.
---
Seeing three choices at the start of a round of Battlegrounds is at best a nebulous advantage that ultimately won't win a game on it's own.
---
Lol are you even listening to yourself. You would rather take the words of some Wild "experts" than actual statistics? Even if VS uses a relatively small sample size in Wild, it's much more accurate than the tiny sample size of the Rankstar team.
---
Random question, but I was kind of curious about the history of the auto-battler format since I never played the DOTA one. It kind of reminds me of an old WC3 map Legion TD, which involved shop rounds and battle rounds. You were split into teams, random shop offerings, placing units that would auto-fight a round of enemies and then every now and then the other team, so kind of an auto-battler Tower Defense hybrid. 
---
I was wondering if that might have been an auto-battler ancestor or if they all came from another inspiration point. Mainly because the WC3 custom maps (and to some degree Starcraft map editor) were kind of the primordial soup that created the TD and hero team battler formats (as well as a sort of lab to for a Warcraft RPG), so it just would kind of amaze me if maps the player community made for a 25 year old game was also at the rpot of yet another popular game format
---
I I wouldn't say it has the slickest UI. The huge buttons look kind of ridiculous IMO. It does have a very simple UI because it isn't cluttered with items, passives, or information about your opponent. They also save a lot of space by having a one dimentional battlefield.
---
I mean he literally just took some cards from the game and that's it.
---
There's no ideas. Just cards slammed into one picture
---
Oh cool. Thanks for the info.
---
The 1 gamemode I'm referring to, is BG. This sentense is more of ironic, because it has the most attention, while standard is suffocating from evolve, wild from snip and tavern brawl too. The quoted post of CM was pinned for a few days, but got removed and no communication came after. So I decided to post to potentially accelerate the decision process, because less than a day left until new brawl week.
---
I consistently reroll and get 0-2 cards of the new tier. Her power saves me a coin on the reroll but also a guaranteed choice of 3 from the new level. Not awesome, but doesn't suck.
---
Reno = dragon confirmed
---
I hope Bob becomes the final boss of something where he keeps giving you cards that strictly benefit him but cause a severe side effect if you never play them.
---
That’d be awesome! The power felt a lot to me like the Warlock tap - you can’t just use it willy-nilly, but used at the correct times and it would really smooth the curve and develop a strong position
---
But people see a “0” and just mash it xD Maybe a “pay life to tier up” that you can only use twice, or something like that would be more intuitive
---
I don't know if it's different now, but the achievement procced before I revealed the cards in the pack for me years ago.  I think I got Gruul as my last classic card.

---
there is some rng, but much less, because there are built in heuristics for target selection. for example units will attack the nearest enemy first, unless you are an assassin which attacks the furthest enemy first. or for example certain spells will target furthest enemy away first, or highest hp enemy first, etc. however if there are two enemies that both match a criteria, then there will be rng involved.
---
while rng is still involved, the player has MUCH more control over the rng by understanding the mechanics and rules of the game.
---
I had the same thing, the new MMR rewards higher placements a lot more, seems far more variablity in terms of rating swings.
---
where are these averages coming from that you are referencing? whos the source?
---
Maybe now they'll get motivated to optimise the app.
---
10 seconds to reconnect is ridiculous and pretty much makes you lose a turn
---
So in short, you had a bad experience one time and no amount of logic will get you to reconsider at this point in time?    I don't think that's the way to go about it.  It might be a top tier hero, but I'll take that effect over a half dozen others currently out there.
---
It's the last one that gets me time and time again. I am constantly losing time as if try to hit reroll whilst my hand is open after buying a minion. Very frustrating.
---
newly summoned get seem to get attacked first because they are almost always the most numerous.  the most common example without taunt is rat pack and replicating menace.  they are placed to die as late as possible to ensure spawning the maximum number, and at that point more than half the board will be spawned tokens.  so you'd  have a much greater chance to hit a token than not, in the case of rat pack, you're often looking at 5/7 are tokens, which translates to a 70% to hit a token.
---
&gt;Yes they did explain it. You quoted the whole comment so you obviously read it, work harder on reading comprehension and less on writing dumb comments. 
---
&gt;The flaw in your logic is assuming that more people playing battlegrounds means fewer people playing normal HS.  
---
Take your own advice.  
---
My whole post revolves around that which I quoted originally also.  
---
There is no flaw in the OPs logic to assume that if people are playing BG they aren't playing "normal HS".  In fact it is a very logical assumption to make.  
---
Take it a step further and if they aren't playing normal HS then they don't need to spend money as it stands and thus monetization of HS is inevitable.  
---
Think before you reply in the future.
---
I wasn’t having any issues a few games ago but I just lost horribly because the reload time on Bob was so long, I couldn’t even reload 10 times, and I reloaded basically instantly. I lost the final round because with like 5 seconds left and the reload still frozen I put the 7/7 snake down and it was on the field, but wasn’t “really” on the field so opponent killed me. Losing two turns at end game is so infuriating.
---
Awww....but I won the most with Lich.
---
Unless I'm mistaken, you're not guaranteed 3 of the minions will be from the same tier.  I'm pretty sure I've upgraded to a new tier and a refresh hasn't provided a single minion from the new tier, let alone 3.  Just because you went up to Tier 4, doesn't mean the 4 minions (or whatever number  it is, the game is still new to me) will be Tier 4.  The discover effect does make the minions that particular tier.
---
When he says "Let's see if you can stay on top!" I just hear him passive aggressively wanting me to lose.
---
What does it mean when you play against Kel with 0 heath?
---
Seriously though, playing the game should be the reward if you’re looking for “rewards” for playing a game I think that might be your problem.  especially if you had “fun” playing.  Maybe your mmr is too low so you aren’t getting challenged by your opponents yet.
---
Right so you don't actually have any data to support your "data suggests" nonsense.  got it. ;)
---
Ugh. Was wondering why I was still getting 27s for 1st.
---
How does Sindragosa work? I've never seen a minion frozen in battlegrounds before
---
"If" but you know there aren't. That's also not quite right math since you can't get duplicate options. Lastly, I don't care what your (or anyone else's) opinion is, I don't enjoy it.
---
I don’t play but my guess would be that it means to play.
---
Please read our rules on civil discourse, final warning.
---
Keep choosing afk so I can rank up on my smurf accounts ;)
---
This right here is the correct answer.
---
Sometimes the hero power doesn't matter if you make a strong build. And patches isn't horrible, it has the same impact as Ragnaros if it hits bubbles
---
How about turn off the animation all together and just make the damage numbers icon green when it's poison?
---
People like to misinterpret things and then blame everyone else
---
Shaman has a slightly unfavorable winrate against aggro shaman/warrior, but If you have the full deck (a deck that can easily climb to legend), you should not have trouble beating rank 17. Without knowing anything about your plays it's hard to figure out the issue, but this might be a mulligan issue, or a strategy issue, likely not adapting to play against the deck you're facing.
---
I would advise to watch a few streams of people playing the deck in legend, and see what they're doing that you're not.
---
Might be hard right now given everyone's playing battleground, though.
---
&gt;only 4600
---
then shaddap
---
You should never craft lone cards just because "they're solid". You should craft decks that you're ready to use. 
---
Crafting lone cards almost always end up in wasted dust, because even "solid cards" only see play in a small % of decks. 
---
Plus, commons&amp;rares are found all the time in packs, so you'll likely open packs and find the stuff you spend lots of dust on.
---
Had this yesterday. The final match, me, as Ragnaros, at 6 Health, and my opponent as Curator, at 3 Health. While I am building my board, I see that my opponent's health is 0. I fought Kel'thuzad. I lost. I got my first place. All seems logical but still, very weird.
---
Thank you so much!
---
What do you mean by card upgrade tier? Is number of golden cards you have?
---
"I'll show you REAL magic"

---
I think it should spawn a sleeping 0/0 until they find an appropriate nerf for it.
---
although bronze can scale right with lightfang as well.
---
Most buff units give +2 +2. Some can give more (all taunts, all mechs, all murlocs hp) If you can find 3 of them per turn, bronze will give you +6/6. Lightfang gives +8/8.
---
A really good bronze turn can scale faster than lightfang. I think the biggest issue is that 5 stars are things like lightfang, and things like a 5/7 that spawn 3 1/1 murlocs.
---
Rather than nerfing her, finding ways to buff other units (a 5/6 star unit that silences on attack would demolish lightfang strats) and provide counters might be the better way to go.
---
1/15 murloc games
---
Correct.
---
A land where the tiny sub-ten stat'd cards spawn other tiny cards that do things when they die. Turns out Ghastcoiler's pretty good.
---
KillerBullet#2102 trading quest. I’ll show but you go first.
---
It's rather simple, 
---
Simulate a battle for everyone with previous board state, sort the power level.
---
Lower have reduced chance to higher.
---
And some special rule like AFK always queue top hp guy to even things out.
---
It counts as Battlegrounds mode too xD
---
You can freeze minions between shop phases to lock them. Sindragosa's ability gives those frozen minions +1/+1.
---
What‘s wrong with not using a webcam? I personally enjoy streamers that aren‘t using a webcam more because the gameplay is the absolute focus.
---
The amount of money required to voice act/draw the hero surely can't outweigh how much revenue it generates.
---
You probably had deathrattles that summoned microbots or other 1-1s. The secret only procs to the SECOND minion and it works like the last deathrattle effect of that second minion, so if it has "summon 7 1-1s" it will never proc because your board will be filled, and then it won't have space to summon the minion that just died.
---
Just started battlegrounds and I'm at 4800 and climbing
---
About 1 in 170 to get 3 of a kind turn 1.
---
Until you buy 30 dod packs
---
wait, how did it show him playing against a KT?
---
"Away for more than a month" don't think I've seen that before.
---
It's more like usually it's rock paper scissors. Now it's more like God rock paper scissors, but 90% of people always pick God no matter how much of a degenerate it makes you and how unfun it is for everyone else who came to play rock paper scissors.
---
Its kinda bad tho.. u level up and dont want to freeze the board, because you have only 1 star minions on the board
---
I didnt find sindragosa great to play anyway.. got some value out of it later in matchups when gold was a bit easier to come by
---
"Incredibly powerful"  
---
Hard disagree. You're really over selling how 'good' her hero power is. Its an ok hero power, but by no means 'incredibly power'. An incredibly powerful hero power would be something like Nef's, where every match, you literally get to wipe all the divine shields off your opponent's board for 1 coin, while your minions keep their divine shields.
---
No, she isn't. She's by no means busted at all.  
---
Want something that's busted? Use Nef. 1 coin and you literally wipe all enemy divine shields, while your divine shields remain in play.
---
Exactly, some people are overvaluing her hero power. I would say her hero power is actually among the worst.
---
In TFT, you can influence the flow of battle by positioning much more radically. Get a ranged heavy hitter in the back, brick him around with tanky heroes and he is safe from direct attacks. Or play assassins who immediately leap towards the furthers target in the beginning of the fight. Or have heroes with abilities like blitzcrank that hooks a target and brings him directly to your backline, etc. Than you can completely spin this by 360 degrees if your opponent positions in a way of anticipating all of this and you got a real strategy behind positioning and the automated part is just reflective  of your set up.
---
4500
---
Gold your brann first
---
No, he isn't. Lmao, out of the four, Elise is the weakest.
---
It's a complicated question. For the way BG works, it should be close to 4000 plus the cushion that your first games make, divided by every player that play those games, so probably close to 4500, assuming you win more games than you lose in your fist tries.
---
im pretty sure people like me keep it at around 4500 because im at 3097 lmao.
---
Lmao!I'm the idiot right. I probably read  more literature, plus the pulp fiction books, than your whole family in their entire life, but please continue to make assumptions on my intelligence level lol. You are the definition of narrow minded bigot idiot based on your responses. The kind that would decide for others what is acceptable to do or not, Are you American by any chance?
---
Aren't all autobattlers F2P without being strictly pay 2 win? I honestly don't know, but if that's the case, they must be making money somehow. Blizzard will just copy their business model. Perhaps Hearthstone and Battlegrounds will be separated at some point?
---
No, what matters the most is the card arrangements. Hero power is secondary.
---
The only reason you want Voidlord is to combo with Juggler. That's literally it.  
---
But for some reason, a lot of people don't invest into juggler, even though once you do have a setup for him, he's actually insane.
---
Why is murloc tide hunter tier s
---
junkbot is now 5 gold.
---
Game gives you 10 packs anyway. You can save gold to buy 10 more.
---
Uhh did you not read all the smiley faces and thanks? D:
---
Every card that diminishes the cost of another card is broken in the long run. Nobody tought Handbuff would be good, heck, it was extremely bad until they got around magnetic/handbuff. Now you get a 20-24 windfury minion on turn 4-5 if you get the 1-2 mech that reduces costs by 1.
---
It's just a visual bug. You can take note of your mmr before every game and when this happens you will see.
---
Tfw you lost against the ghost anyway
---
Here were some of the stuff I played and saw in Top 3 (didn't get to play Battle of the Bans):
---
(a few variants for each)
---
- Patches, Mark of the Lotus, Savage Roar
---
- Ice Block, Frost Nova, Research Project
---
- Fist of Jaraxxus, Soularium, Silverware Golem
---
- Coldlight Oracle, Flobbidinous Floop, Naturalise
---
- SN1P-SN4P and friends
---
- Whirlwind, Eternium Rover
---
Played a few games of each; always like these brawls!
---

---
Such is MMR.
---
I would love Wild to have a "Unlimited" games where you can do all the broken shit you want with all the unnerfed cards they have printed, and a "limited" format where they balance and nerf cards. This is a Digital card game, they surely can do that like they do in tavern brawls.
---
Problem is, leveling up turn 2 means you can get an Amalgam turn 3. Which almost everyone wants.
---
You'd think they'd add a better reward for sinking so much money/time on this game. I guess their small indie studio doesn't have the resources to add a new cosmetic.
---
Let me tell you, I managed to lose to the ghost on more than one occassion
---
What's going on there?
---
There were times where I have to concede because it’s over the time limit, but almost always 15 mins is plenty of time for a game
---
Where did you get those stats?
---
I'm always up for some easy gold.
---
Friday it was  Fist of Jaraxxus, Soularium, Silverware Golem  then switched to  Patches, Mark of the Lotus, Savage Roar 
---
Then as the druids came in,  Saturday to Monday I played  Patches, Evolve, Beakered Lighting
---
From Monday night things got messier and no deck could guarantee lot of fast wins...
---
I always gived free wins to mages since the games took too long
---
I have over 150 wins this brawl, by far most of any brawls in 1 and a half years since I'm playing.
---
im sure there are plenty of humble hard working streamers that noone knows about male and female. Iv noticed certain streamers give streaming a bad name.. i think it might be time to try and give other people a chance to shine im sick of seeing the same streamers over and over again. Besides wingsofredemption there is plenty of content on his stream....
---
Yeah, 5 Rats being summoned one by one with Mama Bear takes too freaking long.
---
You’re playing a game made by the laziest company (Activision-Blizzard) in gaming history. Why is any of that a surprise?
---
Demonade*
---
&gt; in normal game formats it never was that apparent
---
&lt;shudderwock flashbacks&gt;
---
Jade Idol is not broken because you can put  Skulking Geist into your decks.
---
Secret Mage is not broken because you can put Eater of Secrets into your decks.
---
Snip-Snap is not broken because you can take a break.
---
the fact that battlegrounds gets a balance patch in a week and wild gets it never showed prove to anyone that the core reason for pathetic balance in HS is to sell more packs.  keep people chasing the meta cards as long as possible.
---
&gt; Lots of reborn die, all at the same time

“Wild is exactly as the name suggests, WILD!” is just a bullshit statement. Wild is not the dreamland where every class has a good deck and the games are basically decided on the first few turns. Have Snip Snap? Win the game. Dont have Reno? Lose the game. Didnt play any secrets on the first few turns? Lose. It is really fristrating.
---
Well, at least for now, you definitely can roll a 50g into a 60g, I've done it on the single 50g quest I got so far. I don't if you're supposed to be allowed to though, but I don't think Blizzard stated anything about limiting that particular case.
---
It makes me really sad when i see people throwing money at this mess of a game from a AAA Game studio.
---
But thread conundrum is deciding what to drop to play it
---
Well, it wasn't used at all on Gadgetzan and that means it was weaker thatn everything else right? I mean, you can also play a deck with only 7+ cost minions and that won't make it good even if it's very strong.
---
I refuse to believe people can say things like this with a genuine confidence in the idea that it’s a meaningful thing to have said. First of all, having a “main” in a card game is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way first and foremost. 
---
More importantly, Shaman as it exists now in Standard is unlike any other deck we’ve had at the top of any meta. Mill Rogue can be prepared against, teched against. You can anticipate it, play around it, and win based on the decisions you’ve made in those regards. Same goes for whatever you mean by “death rattle Priest”. I can think of a few examples of what that has popularly been over the years, but it’s never been an oppressive deck. A better example of an “oppressive” deck would be the old Undertaker Hunter, or the recent Control Warrior we saw frequently before the nerf to the Dr. Doom hero card. 
---
Even *those* were fine in the sense that you could at least defeat them. The biggest complaint was that you had to use a select few decks in order to ladder, not that they simply steamrolled literally every deck option. I reached top 500 Legend during the height of that Control Warrior deck a couple of months ago using a homebrewed Shadowform Priest, for crying out loud. There was even still room for experimentation. 
---
_________
---
Shaman right now is an entirely different beast. It’s not simply another example of “the meta”. That class in and of itself *is the entire meta*. There is no way to plan against it. There is no way to tech against it. There is no deck archetype that is favored against it. The closest that you can get to a “counter” is something like Quest Hunter, and even that isn’t really a “counter”. It just gives you about a 52% winrate against Shaman if you happen to be an above average player. 
---
As many have said before, Shaman right now isn’t a class that you play against. It’s just a class that ***happens to you***, and the entire match is out of your control. They simply have too much variance, too much of a power spike at every point in the match, too much removal, too much healing, too much hand refilling, too much tempo, too much value, and too much of every other single aspect of what makes a Hearthstone deck good. It has no weaknesses. It literally does everything, and it does everything better than anything else does.
---
They are riding the hypewave and the tournaments blizz is hosting to get more hype, if standard is monotonous try wild.
---
Card pool is finite. Odds of discover are equal.
---
Blizzard doesn't mention it here, but I'm 90% sure that MMR adjustments also factor in your opponents' skill level. I've had games where I lose MMR for 4th place or gain MMR for 5th place, likely due to me being well above or below the average MMR of the group.
---
no it isnt. the only difference between wild and standard is the cardpool.
---
as far as im concerned, the only reason wild exists is because blizzard doesnt want to deal with potential repercussions they d face if they just removed all the old cards from the game.
---
then they claim that they dont want to change things in wild because wild is the place for old decks, and naive 12 yo kids on reddit  buy into that narrative. (yes, you)
---
Oh right thank you, how could I forget this dumb card
---
I watch Twitch on TV while doing other things so this doesn't help the small streamer at all as it feels weird to not be interacted with.
---
But I do agree if you can interact with the streamer, support smaller streamers as it does motivate them.
---
Today I finished a game with a friend and it completed the "Play 1 arena game" quest for me.
---
Mama bear provides depth. Repeated sources of damage are going to chip through any set of divine/poisonous murlocs, because the shields aren't relevant when you have 15-20 mama buffed minions running into your board. 
---
The menagerie comps can absorb all of those chip pushes from beasts, because their boards are built on pure stats. They can take hit after hit, but they lack the depth to beat a whole load of divine shield poisonous minions. This is because once a minion gets hit with poisonous, it dies, no matter if it had 7 health or 700.
---
Therefore, beasts best divine poisonous beats menagerie beats beasts and so on and so forth.
---
&gt; dust is 1:1 with gold in value
---
New packs can easily exceed 100 dust value though because a card is worth much more than what it dusts for. Furthermore, dust can't be used to buy arena runs.
---
"No you aren't, but what else are you doing to do? Go outside? Play standard or Wild? haha, no. so just enjoy this amazing new game mode" -blizzard
---
I will make the optimization target configurable later. You are right that expected damage taken is probably a better default.
---
My plan is also to add a way to automatically figure out the strength of a board. That way you don't have to specify the opponent to optimize. My idea is to just put in some board states at various turns in the game, try them, and see at which turn the given board has around a 50% win rate. The program could even report things like "you are weak to poison", although that might be a bit trickier to program.
---
All these new players dont know the pain and strugle of patron Warrior.
---
It'd a new game mode (genre itself) that deserves to be given a chance ad it had potential. 
---
It's practically a new game (issue is that it kin of deserves it's own subreddit /r/bobtaraven too small I think and should been called /HS/battlegrounds
---
Everyone's simply waiting for the cards to be moved back to Wild, I just want to enjoy the deck I built without Evolve Shaman, Quest Druid, and Secret Paladin comprising 90% of my games.  It's not even frustrating at this point, it's just boring and repetitive.
---
Yeah I think I’ve won one fame with putricide when I had a couple cleaves in the game and then the sniper.  
---
I’ve gotten second a bunch of times w secrets guy and that was only because I got ice block like 4 times in a row and also got mirror image with a giant poison divine shield taunt amalgam. But even then I couldn’t win because all you need is one bad round of secrets and you are out.  
---
Patches is the worst. Hmm let’s see.  1 mana = 2x 3 damage  bombs. Vs Rag 2 mana = 2x 8 damage bombs. The math doesn’t even work.  Meanwhile Nefarian wipes out 7 divine shields for 1 mana (he should be nerfed to 2 mana)
---
Don't worry, given how the HS team operate in the past, this will be pushed to the side within a week or two of the expansion launching. Maybe a small monthly update. Then things will ramp up just in time for the next preorder period "See? We care about the mode :)".
---
When was their a brawliseum?  I don't remember one happening since the beginning of the expansion
---
theyve literally already said they were going to fix it. this post is not useful.
---
You should post this on the official bug forum and/or open an official ticket to get an answer about it.
---
I play hearthstone to play hearthstone, but Blizz seems to only care about BGs atm. Hopefully we'll see a little bit attention for the former main game modes when the expansion comes close. At least as a wild player I am used to the devs not caring.
---
It's practically non existent when it comes to wild.
---
Yea, bottom line they’re all pretty shitty when compared to curator, patchwerk, rat king, or daryl. However, thank God that most ppl don’t know how to play Daryl so they always end up 8/7/6th:)
---
Mogu Cultist, Time Out!, and Crystology was my deck of choice.
---
They nerfed Barnes, you can’t day they’ve never done anything
---
This..... is requiem
---
By "network" I just mean the way they set up the network infrastructure for the game, like the way the game is set up to communicate information between 8 players
---
The Junkbot was in my hand for 10 rounds actually.
---
I think it's a great mode but way too much about luck. In other auto battlers I have the feeling that you need at least some skill and gameknowledge.
---
In Battlegrounds I feel like the RNG has too much influence on the game.
---
But well that's just my opinion. Would be interesting to know what you guys think.
---
They can't even fucking balance standard.
---
whenever you get stucked, you should restart fast. It's more a visual bug than an actual bug.
---
That makes more sense, thank you for pointing it out
---
The previous 100 identical posts were also a solid hint.
---
The new heroes are kinda bland tbh.
---
Except Elise which at least has some uniqueness.
---
I feel the others will just end up being “Play as if you have no Hero Power and just be happy when you get a nice little buff”
---
Much prefer design that has more intentionality, where you really want to play a certain way from the start.
---
If I could give the developers any concerns it would be to quickly address the Amalgam problem and to make it a design goal to develop heroes as more strategy-enabling and less passive.
---
The first exclamation mark on your quest is upside down too.^/s
---
You you’re referring to [this article ](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/15955974/) then that information is very outdated as there have been significant changes to ranked progression most notably the additional of ranked floor (rank 20, 15, 10, 5 and legend).
---
That's one way, or you can just play Brann hero with Brann minion. I had giant amalgams and some other minions near 100 health. The downside of making such giant ass minions is that their tier levels tend to be low. I was smashing most opponents but they were only taking like 10 damage a turn. Gave them time to find poisons and stuff, like that ghost who killed me.
---
Nice.
---
Im starting to think poisinous is way too common, 90% of games are divine shield pousinous taunt that just clean house, maybe remove the 1/2 murloc and amalgam cant just have poisonous every game and leave the later  tier 6 poisonous minions (Maexna and Gentle Megasaur)
---
When I started watching Zetalot, he had about 20 viewers at a time and was the best radio station on Twitch.
---
This would only make sense if you couldn't take damage from the ghost. It's absurd to suggest I have everything to lose and nothing to gain.
---
The only thing I'd say should be changed is if there are an odd number, the last place person should by default be the one who gets to fight the ghost to give them a little chance to catch up. If they fought then last then 2nd to last plays the ghost.
---
It's stupid that in 3 players the 1st place should ever get matched to a ghost.
---
Nobody wine with demons anyway ;)
---
bro quit smoking. It is bad for u. We all care about you, you should also care for yourself. You can do it❤️
---
The hero we didn't know we needed.
---
Just ignore the pink heros then
---
It was oppressively good back when the patrons could get charge
---
Or you lost the brawl is run before the closed it and got that reward AND the pack for the replacement brawl
---
Finely either needs to be targetable or free whenever you sell.
---
This game is a nightmare to play on mobile. The touch interaction is different from normal game, it's not as smooth and you need to watch the animation before you can actually interact with it.
---
No matter how fast your APM is, if you play against deathrattle team you're going to miss some action. I've had a match loss because I was trying to evolve my main guy and didn't manage to put him in time.
---
And no it's not my phone, it's the game.
---
I was referring to the chances of seeing a good or bad hero in the opening pick, not rough chances for each individual hero to win the game. I can agree that right now, the good heroes can wholly outstrip the bad ones when all else is held equal. 
---
However, the amount of times you'll see one of the good ones isn't greatly increased because you saw three to pick from instead of two (I believe you're only about four percent more likely to see any one specific hero with the current pool size of twenty-four), and once DoD is properly released, the disadvantage seen right now will completely evaporate.
---
Zoolock is not a thing in wild an Tekhan is already too slow in standard
---
Literal MMR hell where it’s completely impossible to leave.
---
You were never like, hey, what does this buttom do? Let me test it!
---
Great post!
---
However, sorry for being cynical AF, but...
---
Blizzard doesn't care. Not the HS team - Blizzard.
---
They only care about their bottom line. The player experience can go off a cliff for all they care, so long as the coffers are filled.
---
Wild is not being cared for not because the HS team doesn't care about it.
---
It is not improving for the same reason that we don't get quality of life improvements, new modes, new features, free dungeon-run like modes, etc.
---
Its because it doesn't make money. Pure and simple. It doesn't sell many packs, so not a single man-hour will be allocated towards it. It simply is not profitable for big-daddy Blizzard.
---
As far as Blizzard is concerned, the entire Wild player base can quit the game tomorrow, and no tears will be shed.
---
The good news is that if you can cause enough of a shitstorm, Blizzard will happily divert resources to fix wild and "listen to the players" if they can avoid the bad PR.
---
i still don't get the strategy with Elise, what's the deal with her? How do you use that awful hero power?
---
This would probably be the best solution.
---
Gentle megasaur is still usefull (come on windfury!!), but Maexna is generally just useless.. 
---
"Ohh a poisinous 2/8, now should I sell one of my two Poisinous, divine shield, taunt 30+/30+?"
---
Took me about a minute to figure it out. Thought the power was junk when first reading until I remembered the freeze button.
---
That bug exists for 42 days; since 15.4 update. Some has zero basic cards, some has 4 or 6 copies of basic cards. I encountered it once, didn't do anything, next day it's fixed. Weird.
---
Play means play.
---
Blizzard defines play as "not concede turn 1" and as "one hero dies, or someone concedes after one of the players reached less than 15 health".
---
True, not that impressive but i got carried in the middle of gold in 3v3 overwatch the first time i played ranked
---
I‘m absolute dogshit, play like 3 champs half-decent for a bronze- silver and am playing with a somewhat broken controller on pc
---
Top 10 anime deaths.
---
That's why I said when since once DoD launches, getting seventeen more packs will be quite easy.
---
A turn 3 would probably beat mage if they didn’t get the coin.
---
Mine is research project, sorcerers apprentice, and primordial glyph. Turn 3 you can run through almost the entire deck. Seems like a direct counter to the disco lock.
---
This works too but loses to snip decks
---
Perhaps their data shows otherwise.
---
*Peppy
---
Some sensible ideas here, and the heroes you've mentioned do seem weak.
---
I think making Soul Juggler a T4 unit is a crippling hit to demons though. Often I'll go for demons *because* soul juggler turns up at T3. If it never did, I wouldn't choose demons very often. Soul Juggler with stunt demons is a phenomenal combination in the midgame, but at T4 you couldn't get it with any kind of consistency.
---
I'm sure these RNG fests are fun for some, but I'll be one and done for the pack.
---
Turn 1 one-drop into [[Twilight Summoner]] deathrattle.
---
Never even made it to turn 2.
---
imagine downvoting this
---
When I have two or minions in hand in BG I cant freeze or reroll the board and it is seriously detrimental to playing on mobile.
---
&gt;periodic bans/restrictions on cards or sets
---
Yeah, no. Quote from [this blog post](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/19995505/) three years ago:
---
"In terms of gameplay, nothing is changing for Wild: you’ll be able to finish quests, earn gold, rank up on the ladder, get card backs, earn Legend rank, and use all the cards you’ve already collected to build a Wild deck, just like you always have". Both Team 5 AND people on this subreddit were pushing Wild with the idea that "You'll still keep all your cards! You'll still get to use them!"
---
If cards I have are banned temporarily, I can't fucking use them in Wild, can I? "Wow Armorend, using a blog post from three years ago to make your point? Things change!" Yes I know they do. Which is why it's absurd that Team 5 sold Wild to myself and many others this way.
---
The only reason I ever tolerated Wild was because Team 5, and those incessant pieces of shit on the subreddit who kept saying it was fine, was because I was continually promised that I'd be able to use all my cards IN Play mode. In spite of my rightful worry that, hey, if a card is temporarily banned that still means I can't use it. 
---
"When it comes to banning, it happens in MtG too. The only problem? It does exactly what people are saying isn't going on. "Your card isn't obsolete, it's in Wild now!" "No it's not. It was part of a broken combo and got banned." Since cards in Standard are the only ones having genuine attention being paid to them, any card in Wild basically ends up with the potential to be banned. Any card that falls down the pit will have the chance to become obsolete, effectively fucking over anyone who invested in it." - [Me](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/447n8n/a_few_concerns_regarding_unbalanced_cards_and_wild/) in 2016. Don't get me wrong, in this context I was referring to cards being temp. banned because Team 5 needed to come up with a way to fix a broken card. But it's the same exact principle! If a card is banned from Wild even temporarily, it becomes obsolete/unusable for that time.
---
Which I wouldn't be opposed to if not for the fact that, again, Team 5 told us our cards in Wild WOULDN'T be obsolete. When I can come up with a scenario that a team of professional game designers/developers apparently can't, or don't see worth addressing, that's pretty shitty. And it's not an unreasonable scenario either! It's not like "Oh X card is OP in Battlegrounds, why didn't you plan for it back in 2016?" This is something that they damn well should have had foresight regarding because... Why not? The situation I presented in that thread is much more realistic than the current one in terms of things they could have seen coming and been like "Oh we have a plan for that".

I got the "Play 10 deathrattle minions" as a quest today.
---
Thank you Blizzard, very Cool.
---
I think, if played correctly, Sindagrosa can be very powerful. If you have a token generator to pick T1, grab it and then freeze. T2 - upgrade then freeze, T3 youll have the first two minions with +2/+2 another with +1/+1, sell the token generated and buy two minions. Afterwards, freeze when you feel its the best time to do so.
---
Their data shows evolve is OK too.
---
Jade idol is too slow dominate even some Reno decks. Far from unfair now.  It’s more control Druid than control buster.
---
The point of this post is to tell the upvote farmers to stop. We get it, your phone is bad, spamming it won’t help, blizzard is more than likely already working on a fix
---
How about lifesteal minions which when you win a match, you gain a specific amount of hp? They are generally weaker than other minions so you're giving up power for long term sustainability.
---
How do you get 60+ in third place I consistently get 40 in 1st
---
He played vargoth on curve. I killed it but then he revived it with reborn so I bounced him. 
---
Then he played ragnaros. I killed rag and he dived him with reborn. I killed both of them. 
---
So he had 3 rags, 1 vargoth, and 2 of the revive dude in his pool. 
---
His revive hit 1 vargoth and 2 rags. Then vargoth trigger and it revived another 1 and 2.
---
I just wanted to point out that conceding below 15 health was NOT tracked as a played game for me multiple times, which opposes what you said and how it works for challenge a friend.

Actually, you are. Stating that a corporation does what it needs to do to make money isn't indignant, it's reality. And it doesn't make the corporation dishonest.

You came onto a game forum and decided that a game post was about an international conspiracy.

Seriously, take a step back and calm down. You don't need to get this anxious.

Thank you for your service

I like the sound of that, they'd have to have no tribe or else they'd be too powerful with buffs though

I’ve never had this problem myself. What kind of phone do you have?

That is definitely intended, you are playing minions that gain a deathrattle not playing deathrattle minions.
---
Do you need a hug? Are you okay?

Im excited for the expansion,escpially cause dragons.
---
As someone else mentioned, Blizzard most likely looks at their statistics for everyone, meaning every rank. I would wager that at low ranks, it really does not matter what hero you have, since people are not good enough to make use of it. Then taking into account that "low ranks" are actually the majority of players, it ends up heavily swaying the statistics. If i remember right, there was a statistic shown early on that like over 60% of HS players were between rank 20-15.

Honestly dude, I'm not. It feels like all my favorite game companies are trying to outdo each other on who can be the shittiest to their fans all while maximizing shareholder value. I miss video game companies caring about their fans. I'm tired of just being a consumer to milk.
---
The video game industry lacks... morals, I guess? It just sucks because this is my main hobby, it's how I get away from real life stress, and I just can't find it anywhere at the moment. I can't remember the last game I bought that felt inspired and not just a thinly veiled addiction loop that's been monetized in the most predatory way possible.

hoyhoy#21560 EU, 80g quest. I can show you, you go first.
---
I was super anti-battlegrounds at first, I thought it looked so mind numbingly simple and boring.  I didn’t even try to play for the first week.  However, the meta is so terrible I eventually caved and gave it a try and am now absolutely hooked.  As long as this game mode is active I don’t think I’ll even do quests or buy the new expansion.
---
No reason but mechwarper would give people 80 dust so it still wouldn't be a reason not to nerf.
---
I agree. Most of the quests were poorly designed to promote such linear gameplay. The issue with Druid quest is that it isn’t really a quest, it’s more of a timer. If you don’t kill them by the time the timer goes off- you lose. If they did remove evolve from the meta I don’t see any other deck competing against quest Druid or quest shaman. Both offer way too much value for such a small price
---
Thank you, his post actually answers my question:  The pool of minions is shared. So if everyone goes for the same minion, then it's harder for all of them to get the triple.
---
We’re they from different sets due to the free pack reward quests? If so, that would explain it. You’re guaranteed a legendary within the first 10 packs of each set, and its weighted such that you usually get it before the 10th. If you were opening packs from multiple sets you hadn’t opened before, that tilts the legendary odds drastically.
---
who the fuck cares about expensive cosmetics. they put a gameplay advantage for bg behind a paywall, thats something worth getting upset about
---
I made a post about this yesterday that got no traction at all - but mobile players shouldn't even bother playing this mode. Any legitimate Dancin' Daryl play is just moot because of animation times on each buff.
---
The fact that we have to toggle into and out of the cards in hand makes Battlegrounds unplayable on mobile.
---
Hi im DeckbotHS and im starting today with posting Decklists, Guides, News and more.  
---
I created this list of budget decks you can play in Saviors Of Uldum.  
---
I hope you can climb some ranks with these decks :)
---
Tell me what you think in the comments!
---
Just needs to be bumped up to 4 stars imo
---
They adjust the point that u got from winning on today's patch. So it's kinda easier somehow to climb now.
---
I'm excited about the pissed off looking bird.
---
now you have battlegrounds, why you still open and collects cards?
---
In the future you can just log out and log back in if you don't want to sit through the end a match. You'll wind up in Bob's Tavern.
---
The server-side calculations of who won/lost is already determined long before the match actually plays out.
---
That is a lot of heroes in the "junk tier".  But Tides is *pretty* good, so I guess they must be accurate.
---
It's pogo-power, man!
---
Zero interest.  So fucking boring I didn't even finish the tutorial.  Noped out of there and rerolled the quest to play it.
---
Nobody dare to +1 nor -1 that comment, it’s reached the *un*holy number.
---
it seems impossible to lose the battle to bot
---
but what are the doubts actually?
---
Summon Barnes again...
---
This one thing puts mobile at a clear disadvantage with APM compared to PC. PC it's click and buy, drag and sell, and so on. Mobile it's drag and buy, open hand, drag, sell, drag and buy oh wait my hand is open, ok rope's burning, refresh, fuck, wait, hand's still open, close hand, refresh, ok the hand closing and refresh animation took too long, and I'm done.
---
&gt; its simply not a deck casual people can play to climb
---
The hell you talking about? Snip is one of the easiest decks in the format. Which says a lot because basically every deck in Hearthstone is laughably easy.
---
&gt;Like, I cant believe people can simply go and say "if its playrate is not that high, then the deck is shit" instead of looking at the actual winrates and playrates trough the ranks, instead of trying to do some supositions about what they think the winrates of the deck is trough the playrate.
---
Win rates mean nothing, we dont have official Blizzard statistics. Win rates also come from people who have *data collection software*, something only skilled people bother with. I have literally *never* hit the R5 wall with less than a 70% w/r. But that's not how averages work.
---
I want you to articulate why Snip is a problem. Every other deck in the format comfortably wins on turn 5-8, why is it any different for Snip? Every other deck in the format basically plays solitaire, why is it any different for Snip? There are like 50+ different archetypes that are legendary viable, why is Snip problematic?
---
If a deck was warping a format, something everyone is saying Snip does, it would be destorying ladder percentiles. Yet, Snip is less than 4% of the entire meta. The only time is sees a spike (10-13%) is in the legend bracket. That is not indicative of a problem deck. To pretend otherwise is, you're being delusional.
---
Rag not in the bottom tier. I've been telling this to anyone that will listen. Good to see someone so respected say it too.

Ultimate chad for typing this out

Nov 29th cuz the lightning? Dragon
---
You would be surprised. If u have dust and cards go for it
---
We should just have no animations and once the timer is up a score is displayed and we never leave the tavern
---
And going reno is never bad idea i mean wild has so many cards no dupes is hardly any drawback
---
It shows you your opponent’s minions’ gained deathrattles when they’re played, it’s even in history. But hovering doesn’t tell you anything
---
Yeah, that's a way to know what DR gained, but then you just have to remember.
---
I'm not saying it's not wrong, I just liked the difficulty.
---
Nice of the game to tell you this. Like, if only there was a practice/training session for it that told you information like that.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about this mode
---
I'd be more concerned about Mech builds running loose. They tend to be able to swing for 12-15 pretty consistently in the mid game before menagerie manages to take off. Making menagerie an even later build will just force everyone into mechs
---
Spoiler!
---
&gt;!I lost...!&lt;
---
Big shaman is my favorite deck at the moment so I hope you're right.
---
I don't get one until 6 stars now though
---
Do you have newer information, or were you just guessing? I of course concede that the information is old (which is why I brought that up), but I see no evidence that the ratios have changed dramatically.
---
My new favorite:
---
(on a frozen minion) Divine Spirit, Divine Spirit, Inner Fire, Silence
---
HAHAAAA!
---
The chances of 1/8 people not needing the entire time is so remotely low it makes no sense to add one, you would just rage about that.
---
Everyone's talking about the OG stuff, but I started HS last year and OG for me and my only deck was Fire Imp-Coin-Voodoo Doctor-Happy Ghoul-Happy Ghoul.
---
Had to take prep instead of another step on the spell lackey towards the end cause was running out of time sadly. Still the biggest Edwin I've ever made / seen.
---
Getting close to that "Flip a coin each turn. If tails, you lose" brawl.
---
Yeah but then you’d say that’s bad design or oppressively unfun, but not just oppressive which implies it’s oppressive within the meta which is far from the truth
---
I like playing her. I like to use it on token (minion that spawn a minion) and then snowballing by selling the extra minion and buying a card from the same field in early level. It's basically strong early. Turn 2, freeze a 2/1 murloc and a 2/4 taunt to become 3/2 and 3/5.
---
Downside may be no nightmare but you could also take advantage of extra minion that are crummy in stat to be greedy. Rank up , sell, reroll. 
---
Rank 3 6/3 divine shield minion can be a 7/4 early on just by using this tactic. Its pretty rng but a 1/1 buff blanket is nice.
---
It's especially nice in late game when you reroll but cannot buy until next round on triples or magnet card. The freeze stacks too so if you freeze for two turn it's 2/2.
---
Ree ree!
---
They literally broke standard and perfectly okay letting it stay broken. Idk what you expect from a team who doesn't care anymore.
---
It's a quality of life feature that makes a lot of sense. And the main hs game already has this feature, hopefully it doesn't take much coding to get it in to battlegrds.
---
Its beta, rewards may come later ?  
---
I don't see how you consider it the same. I also don't see how you consider all the other modes the same already.
---
FOOOOOOOOLLLS
---
Shit, I recently sold that Amalgam wuite early by accident because I had to rush my turn and I still ended up winning. The early game advantage with fast tiering can really make a big difference.
---
But in Standard/ladder it is obvious what I am conceding. In Battlegrounds it is not as obvious whether it is the round or the "tournament". Actually, instead of a "are you sure?" they could just change the button text to "Leave Battlegrounds"
---
I'll try and ask him. Patches at 1 mana to pop bubbles I can understand, but 2 mana to pop 2 random bubbles is so bad
---
i've seen it in every game. it is especially visible when you make it to the end game. You start seeing those amalgams showing up again or lightfang enforcers when people that had them die. Remember that a triple holds 3 copies so if someone has a golden card means they removed from the pool 3 cards. it is often the case that people are also holding on to cards just to deny others getting them. I certainly do that in most games when i reach top 4. Certainly not gonna let that other player get a golden junkbot for ex if they already have one or two. if i can spare the gold i'll buy it and keep it. 
---
Also it's a time based thing, in the sense that people refresh the cards in the same time window as you do so maybe you're not seeing the card because they snatched it before you could refresh and maybe find it. The cards you were looking for may also be rare. Like the T6 cards are 3% chance to find for ex
---
but most likely people are holding on to cards. in the late game it certainly happens a lot
---
Yeah, but it's not obvious I just HAPPENED to notice it and was able to guess the rest hence my comment confirming. Needs to be actually mentioned. I didn't know and have literally gone every round refreshing looking for 1 or 2 minions in particular.
---
I love Hobbs so much. One of first people to get me into hearthstone
---
Are people deciding not to use r/BobsTavern ?
---
I mean.....I play all the time on my iPhone. It's fine. I get wins, I get top 4's, I rarely (if ever) feel like I'm unable to do what I want.
---
You've had swings of over 400 points?
---
I guess it fits in with there "class identity" lol
---
Lightfang, lightfang, lightfang
