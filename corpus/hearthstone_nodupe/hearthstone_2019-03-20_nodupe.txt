Or you could just not buy anything, be smart about your dust and gold, and be okay with probably not experiencing every single new deck.
---
---
---
Has that been confirmed? For all we know they don't want the same Standard deck to run both Booms.
---
They took your money? 
---

---
or did you actively give the money? It is stealing if you get something. Sure, it might not be what you were hoping for, but they clearly give you 50 packs. So I think you are being a little over dramatic.
---
You can just not buy it. So there you go. Problem solved.

Oh, cruel fate. They'll never be together in one deck.

they were good, until the lackey and pact nerf

How soon until Blizzard hires ramzykamen
---
Shudderwock Shaman isn't even a good deck in Wild. Malygos Shaman is a better deck, and there are far better and more "degenerate" combo decks in the format.
---
It's not worth worrying about.
---
I do. It wins me games.  Sometimes I draw all my dinosaurs, dire frenzy allows my later Katrena to not be an 8 mana 6/6.

I prefer the 78% of the time I haven't been facing hunter on ladder but if I had to choose 1 flavor of Rexxar this would do just fine
---
I legit thought this was art spoilers for a new card. I only opened up the thread to see what the card did. Nicely done human person. 
---
Do Schemes stack until 10 or do they have a limit?
---
Crowd Roaster’s got the pure epicness factor going for it, though...
---
Fairly consistent 0.5-0.6 legends per 18 packs (rounding would put the answer somewhere in the middle) so what do you mean by increasing chances? 
---
he's gonna use it with sneed's for sure
---
Fucking amazing in Wild, especially with Shadow Visions, Shrinkmeister etc. My Thief Priest grows stronger!
---
Cards like this are the reason I quit Hearthstone.
---
Hmm? 
---
...What exactly is her scheme?
---
Same with arena drafts, having to use discord to share screen with friends is a bit of a hassle
---
Well hunter always gets the worst legendaries (or at least in the bottom 3) so it’s not a surprise, hopefully there will be better late game then what we have now.
---
If you like random, you can make tesspionage rouge
---
The dust number I used is the dust for that tier, subtracted by the previous tier. So the dust that can be linked specifically to the last 10 packs. 
---
I hope it doesnt work like how it says. Let's say we have two mechs one of them has deathrattle, other does not. This can summon the one that doeant have deathrattle but i think it should prioritize the one with dr

I think you don't know what interactive means.
---
This card is super interactive. you can see when your opponent is setting up for it, you can play to have a board clear for when they want to do it, after or before.
---
If your opponent has 3 minions, one of my favourite things to do is freeze the middle minion and then, even if they use Fungal, they are only getting half of his power.
---
Either you are not good at this game, or like I said, you don't know the meaning of interactive.
---
Oops
---
What about Shifter Zerus and Chameleos then?
---
it's probably pretty strong if you just started playing and have around 2 cards for warrior that are rare or better.
---
Me too, fuck hunters
---
Do you need a hug?
---
Yes
---
I love his streams on twitch. All his decks are hilarious to watch. My personal favorites are his infinite armor decks and his stupid shudderwock combos. 
---
Thank god Void Ripper is cycling.
---
&gt; something as expensive as an alternative hero
---
lol
---
To be fair they’re all legendary. Let them be unique. 
---
They all have the effect of full your board with x, but are worded completely differently, technically is we ever get the ability to get &gt;7 minions Nomi would only summon 7 but that isn't a realistic possibility
---
Thank god. 
---
Name a more iconic duo than hunter and shitty legendaries
---
Dr Doom?
---
Day9 is quickly becoming one of my favorite streamers. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all just one clip you drop it on the front page and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a ton of karma to use later in the game.
---
You forgot "I believe the prices are unfair, but I will be purchasing both bundles anyway because I can't stop" as an option. Pretty sure this is a large portion of the player base.

6 mana 3/4 lol garbage
---
That moan at the beginning is very disturbing.
---
Exactly. It's irritating, unneccasry and should just be a thing already. It's literally just some QoL that a lot of people will appreciate and the ones that don't can just get rid of it by pressing a button.
---
Lol, plenty of control decks existed with Jade. Renolock, Reno mage, control Warlock, Big-Spell Mage, Big Druid, Dead Man's Hand etc.
---
Oh sure it’s not an autoinclude, but that’s good. There should be thought that goes into including a spell
---
I didn't say it was unbeatable , I said it was the most cancerous in the game and I stand by that statement.  
---
Dr. Doom the character is actually based loosely off of Dr. Boom.
---
this clip gave me anxiety
---
Gadgetzan first, easy.
---
I think Witchwood was the best content of its type, and I think Blackrock/Naxx was the best rewards vs KFT. Packs are cool and all, but exclusive cards for completing the content is way better
---
Can confirm. Fuck Jaraxxus.

---
MechaThun my dude

Tinfoil hat they slow reveal so people cant theory craft too much shudderwock was leaked remember!
---
Oblivitron + Fireworks Architect + MechaThun
---
Mages have been dealing with that with Jaina for two years and it's really not that hard to find time to play a do nothing 9 drop in games where you want to play the do nothing 9 drop. It's really only ever hard to play her when you're behind an aggro deck, not stabilized and low in life.
---
That's assuming you don't buy any packs out of the arena or play more arenas for more packs, which is insane. Are you saying some people just play an arena once for a 1 pack reward and never buy more of that pack to hit pity timers, so it's better value on average? And because of that the median is better? What even is the point of calculating a median value, if you assume you are only gonna open 1 pack for it? How is that ever gonna be useful? If i'm opening packs, i'll open them until i hit a pity timer anyways. That's probably gonna take tens of packs. So if i wanna estimate how much dust i'm gonna get from them, i'll use the average dust value from a pack, not a median of 40. 
---
Also, i didn't even mean buying large amounts of packs at once, just that you will have bought a large amount of packs once you are finished opening them. So the pity timer would make the value of your packs a lot better. 
---
If there's ever a way to trigger a battle cry with a spell or deathrattle, there could be a reason for the difference.
---
You said the cards didn't seem to require building a deck around.
---
It's a 2 card combo,so you need to have drawn both cards by the time you need it,with one of those cards needed too be drawn early enough so the 2nd card isn't dead.
---
Card sure is interesting,and could have some nice highlights,but it's lows are to low and it's highs require too much setup for not big enough of a payoff.
---
Needs myra before this. 
---
Pint sized potion was so hated though, It almost single handly killed kindly grandmother.
---
yeah. Eternal is like on a complete different level.. Its overall a much better game in my opinion.. Much more complex mechanics and much more difficult strategies. And the meta is like 30 different decks.. Its got like insane variety. There's a deck that you do it right you can draw out all 70 cards in 1 turn and kill the opponent at the end of it.. its insane lol..   And eternal gives u like a shit load of cards, I spent like 50 bucks in that game and I have like 100% common and uncommon cards and like 7-8 really good meta decks and some random fun decks too. Its a blast 
---
I had a 60% WR vs them. I'd argue that if both players play correctly then the DMH deck was favored.
---
When will we get in-game tournament mode? That alone will solve many issues with competitive scene of Hearthstone!
---
Hearthstone has a Senior Global Franchise Lead? lol
---
I would like to see that. 
---
I see what you're saying, specific strategies vs. specific synergies. Thanks for clarifying.

Pretty sure it doesn't.

Wait what? I dont think ive ever actually seen mysterious challenger played.

---
is wizbang deck actually good?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I wish this card wasn't Epic. I think this card sucks. It is so reactive. I think it will be too slow or the value is still going to be you trading this card and possibly another card for something. 
---
Epics are already so rare and if you get a shirty one like this it feel bad.
---
The game froze or the client crashed (great connection or not).  Your opponent has not likely done anything.  (game breaking bugs like this are immediately known and hotfixed)
---
Exactly. This card looks like absolute garbage and it is an epic so if you get it in a pack it feels terrible.
---
Recruit hunter was great too. Cube version just did the same thing slightly better. 
---
Same. I definitely wanted to spam "cheater" whenever I see Roger's face.
---
Maybe we can spam cheater in chinese. ;-)
---
So 6 mana two card mind control that requires one of the cards to be in your hand early on? 
---
[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCanon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCanon)
---
The “competitive” folks are inherently dull. Because anyone smart can see competition illusory.
---
Just play for fun. Make your own decks. You can make legend viable decks with janky meta countering decks pretty easily. Or just play casual. 
---
Ladder in a card game is ridiculous, conceptually. It doesn’t even make sense. So try to give less cares about it. 
---
I actually bought his announcer pack on SC2 and have never changed it:)
---
But if Tess P screams into your opponents deck they get the effects.
---
&gt;Our failure should not diminish Roger’s accomplishments.
---
Yes it does. A known cheater who was caught not once but twice was declared the World Champ.
---
For years many people have been calling Competitive Hearthstone a joke and you just validated them in the worst way possible.
---
6 mana 3/4: put the zilliax you’re saving in your hand before you’re ready to play it and get it killed
---
Blizzard
---
I think you mean second legendary. You are guaranteed a legendary within your first 10 packs. I typically go until I get my second legendary, which is at most 50 packs.
---
Fireworks tech isn’t a mech so that helps
---
This card becomes worse once you realize you have to have 2 mechs *in your hand as Hunter after turn 8* if you wanted your 6 mana 3/4 to be able to trigger when it died if you played Fireworks tech on it. 
---
It’s a 4 card “combo” that just puts some stats on the board
---
It still baffles me that Pint-size Potion and Shadow Word Horror was actually used
---
That’s a good point, thanks!
---
BTW is thus a reason for a perms or temp ban? Do you happen to know this?
---
I think at this point, it is a feature1
---
This is awesome and you are knocking these out of the park. 
---
On this one though, I do have a bit of criticism: I didn't recognise Jaina until I went to the comments because I was trying to figure out what race the character is. Purple skin and glowing blue eyes actually *ruled out* human for me, but no long ears/eyebrows so not night elf, and no horns so not draenae (or daemon), and no visible decay so not undead, no long teeth to indicate troll...
---
Basically I think this would be better if the lighting didn't so drastically effect her skin tone, so she still looked human*. Such an iconic character deserves to be instantly recognisable. 
---
* ^Or ^she ^had ^horns ^and ^wings ^to ^go ^with ^her 
---
^dreadlord ^skin ^colour ;)
---
yeah right now cube lock is irrelevant but I think Cube itself is one of the strongest cards in the year of the raven and I'm so glad it will be gone soon. Just to shake things up and get new stuff.
---
Barnes into blood of the ancient one, shadowstep, play it again.
---
Ez rank 25
---
Well, its' mech-deathrattle synergy makes it playable into MechaC'Thun combo with Oblivitron+Hunter's mark+ArcaneShot  
---
Otherwise it's bad.
---
Something tells me they tried that and spaghetti code made terrible, terrible things happen.
---
FTP are an asset, it lowers queue time for playing customers, furthermore, they provide the background against which paying customers and whales can flex their collection. 
---
How many would pay for entire golden decks if you'd face such every second game? How valuable would be playing that expansive niche deck if everyone and their mother could afford it. Of course the rarity and cost of these decks are not the only factors the paying customers consider, but these are facts and they do increase revenue.
---
A strong player base is free marketing for new players, both paying and FTP, which again increases revenue (development and management cost does not scale linearly with # of players). It's free advertising, it helps player retention (a paying customer is much more likely to stick out with the game if he has RL friends that play too, even if FTP). Hell having the option to not pre order for a couple of expansion and still keep playing as partially FTP helps retention a lot.
---
Lastly, FTP is a very strong gateway into new paying customers. When I was younger I couldn't afford to spend money of computer games, but I am not a teenager anymore, I can drop quite a sum on games I like, I imagine I'm not the only one.
---
dragon priest is the one that generally works well
---
dragon paladin is doable in standard, not nearly powerful enough to compete in wild

Necrium Blade, Petal, Kobold, Maly hopefully drawing into backstab/prep
---
Do you have a place to donate?
---
Haha once you dust you can’t go back bruh make up your mind XD 
---
Could you link it? Everything I've seen and remember states that they're Hearthstone originals. Or rather, they first appeared in Hearthstone's Journey to Un'Goro set.
---
right now the only class that can remove a big minion on turn 3 is priest with shadow word death and hunter with deadly shot, however only spell hunter runs deadly shot and mulligans it away vs a rogue (or at very least should) and I haven't seen shadow word death in any competitive priest list for a long long time 
---
They either nerfed her or were going to, but then changed it because people said it was a nerf to make her behave like yogg but they were not offering dust refunds.
---
I wish they would unnerf yogg in wild though. Its hardly like he would warp the meta when you have so much powerful shit early... 
---

I once beat this opening as tesspionage rogue with something like backstab backstab prep fan si7 and that was my peak as a player
---
Why can't I see this on the card feed? Was this screenshot taken right after he played the card that discovers a spell?
---
At this point in time I would keep every legendary you get. The reason for that is that we don’t know which cards will come and maybe there  will be crazy synergy cards coming next expansion. So keep al cards. Even epic and rare...
---
if you've come for sound card analysis, you've come to the wrong subreddit, my friend
---
He stopped enjoying Hearthstone and so is playing a lot of Magic instead. He still does some HS stuff when new expansions come out but it's not his main game any more.
---
This response is better than everything we've gotten so far, it's a good step forwards and thanks for that /u/BlizzMilkfat, but could you give more details? What was their involvement? Depending on which of the different versions this punishment could be too little or even too large. There has been too much misinformation flying about that I do not think it's a good idea to leave question marks. I am satisfied with the response, but I know I'll be hearing/reading about this far too much because others wont be.  
---
Gang gang
---
I would suggest you wait till a considerable amount of Warlock cards have been announced. Based on how the theory crafting for the class is, if it has any merit, then keep it or else dust. 
---
keep until all cards are released.
---
you can see at the left that cards played after are hex and flame elemental.
---
I love odd hunter. It's not strong but I love playing it :D
---
Now this is an interaction I haven't seen in 5 minutes (since the last dragon roar giving two deathwinfs post) 
---
Some people just want to practice with a "tryhard" deck before taking it to the ladder.  Stop crying.
---
Glad they reversed the change. 
---
just play it when it leaves the minion at 1 attack and steal double health topsy turvy combo wombo
---
I mean, they could hire more than 20 people for a team and etc. But will they? No. Welcome to western business model, where in the most successful year of the comoany's existence they lay off 11% of the staff because it pleases the share holders (or whatever they are called)

And you need an empty board for maximum value. With Defile rotating out you lose your board clear to make it even.
---
A 8-mana fill your board and waste your turn doing nothing relevant is just too slow. He is even worse than Celestia in my eyes, maybe even worse than morrigan
---
Don't craft it if u low on dust and want to be competitive. Only craft it to have fun
---
Why is this a legendary? It should be epic at best weak stats and weak effect in hunter especially since we are losing Terrorscale Stalker and Play Dead for extra activations it's just slow and shitty.
---
Dark iron bouncer
---
He might as well could have been a Rogue Epic. 
---
The new adventures are not worth the price if you prioritize increasing your collection.  You get far more value spending the gold on packs.
---
Man, I was in suspense for that whole thing
---
U can always craft the 400 dust version
---
Idk still to expensive for 'wait a turn and hope'. He would've great either cheaper (e.g. 5 Mana) or in Paladin/any good buff class.
---
It's the classical pack filler and was my free legendary', but as said: I found no way to play the card.
---
Pirate rogue not being a tryhard deck?
---
Pirate rogue is one of (if not) the best decks in wild right now. Just because you dont know it doesnt make it more fair.
---
You are just salty for playing against decks you already know. Casual is not "play bad decks", its play what you want but it doesnt matter if you win or lose because you dont rank up.
---
There is still mmr, so if you win a lot you will face good players with good decks, and if you lose a lot you will face people playing river crokolisk.
---
If you want to play bad meme decks against other similar bad decks, get some friends (add people randomly after games for example, or ask in forums) and ask them to play with you. I have some relatively new players in my friend list and i sometimes offer them to play with my own shitty decks with my wider colection, so they get to play cool legendaries and i get to play bad shitty decks without nobody having a bad time at all.
---
/r/nononoyes
---
It's correct...
---
Does it work with mechs without deathrattle?
---
Seems buggy
---
If anything, obviously this will be for shadow madness plus divine spirit inner fire shenanigans 
---
I mean in the end you can climb with anything in wild, i just got to rank 5 with [murloc priest](https://puu.sh/D2GKx/ec29616643.png) for example lol.
---
I think the problem for OP is that he simply isn't good at deckbuilding since im very sure you can rank up with a lot of fun off-meta decks (probably legend aswell if you know them inside-out)
---
Didn't do anything because money was given by the Chinese to not take action. Now that that has been cleared up, you're able to try and save face. Integrity of any eSports Hearthstone material will forever be a joke. Too little, too late.
---
whatever, whatever, Deathtalker Rexxar, Whatever
---
Wild grief Nerf is simply ridiculous considering all the alternatives printed for the same cost. 
---
We can basically add wild growth power creep to the bingo card now. 
---
General consensus on this is always:
---
If you’re not enjoying it anymore, take a break.
---
Can't tell what the worst part of it is... Probably the smiley at the end. Fucking hell
---
I personally don't think it's the right time to quit hearthstone. I completely agree with you that a lot of the games start off irritating these days but I feel a lot of those issues are with the genn and Baku effects which will be leaving standard.
---
There's plenty of development which hearthstone could see so for me I would say try out the new expansion for a month or so and see if that changes your feeling about the game state
---
Does this mean that the arena fanatic and similar cards affect all Hireeks, not just the 1st?
---
Actually I always find the motivation to play to rank 5 and doing my dailies and most of the brawls. But it's a game which is supposed to make fun so quit it if you dislike it.
---
For me i see no alternative. magic isn't interesting atm because I saw how OP some cards are (and therefore pretty expensive). I could never hook on gwent, the rng factor of auto chess doesn't appeal to me. And artifact? Just lol.
---
So I stick to hearthstone, a game which provides me with a couple of fun hours a week which is pretty good for a f2p game. 
---
I thought she left because she had no time for games.
---
Add in being able to spectate them deckbuilding as well.  Been waiting for any/all three (3) of these for a long time.
---
cool.
---
Uff.. No one here has any reason to be jealous of you.. You don't know how good he is at the game or how entertaining he might be. But from your comment alone we can all see what kind of "streamer" you are. 
---
I'm not prepared to do that.
---
Also Kalimos, Primal Lord
---

---
You can USE IT whit shaw for s instant attack plus 2 mechanikal dragons
---
"Prepare to face the mighty Millhouse Manastorm!"
---
God such a broken 2 drop...
---
That response just shows how shitty you must be at streaming 
---
Why didn’t you take the print with the coin in your hand? Nos there’s no way for us to know if you’re lying or not.. 
---
Join the Kabal, they said!
---
It would get real boring real fast, so Blizzard wouldn't spend the time to make it
---
Doomguard is being rotated because they wanna add more hand buff cards. They didn't explicitly said this but their argument is that charge was problematic for their plans in warlock.
---
Because one can assume more hand buff is on the way, a more support for Hi'reek could come.
---
Wait until all cards from the upcoming expo is revealed and then dust if needed. You aren't going to craft anything now, so might as well wait for the new cards to show any potential synergies.
---
If no synergies are present, dust. Not worth waiting another 3 months for a chance to play an otherwise bad card.
---
1. Some people would prefer it if they aren't constantly watched by others.
---
2. If you for some reason need to see your friend opening packs just screen share with skype or any of the other hundreds of screen sharing apps.
---
Stupid idea.
---
&gt;While Roger and Reall may still compete in Hearthstone Masters Qualifiers and Masters Tour events, due to having two rule violations last year, they will not be invited to the inaugural year of Hearthstone Grandmasters. Grandmasters will be the highest level of competitive Hearthstone, and its competitors will be held to higher standards, not just in performance, but also in conduct.
---
This sounds.... just horrible.  
---
"Oh, we will allow XY shady conduct in little things like ***THE HEARTHSTONE MASTERS TOUR***, but not in our super-secret newly formed Grandmasters.  To play in that, you have to be REALLY above the board."
---
This makes Hearthstone esports sound/look a little ridiculous.  
---
How about you make rules that are ethical, then make people adhere to them?
---
And you have different statues you can carve out. I think there are 4: Murlock, Hs logo, Lich King and a mug?
---
Why not a Pauper format instead? Ban Epics and Legendaries, but instead of keeping it stagnant with only Classic/Basic cards (which itself sounds very imbalanced), you have only the Basics/Commons and Rares of existing sets.
---
It can result in mostly Aggro/Midrange metas developing, but that in itself is not the worst thing in the world, since it means the meta mostly revolves around minion trading and board control. Plus, far less broken interactions from cards like:
---
1. Quests.
---
2. Hero Cards.
---
3. Hadronox/Tess Greymane/Shudderwock/Undatakah and similar flexible Legendaries.
---
4. Carnivorous Cube/Immortal Prelate and similar cool but wonky Epics.
---
In Auto Chess its more like "I made the right/wrong decisions with the choices I was given". Rarely do I ever think it comes down to something as simple as luck. There's even multiple different strategies that people can use to win games at a high level.

Nomi summons six (which will fill your board), Hir’eek “fills your board,” and Onyxia “summons... until your board is full.” They are all mechanically filling your board / summoning six things.

I think you meant Old RAFAAAAAAAAAAAM, THE SUPREME ARCHAEOLOGIST.
---
Go on hearthpwn, there you can find people for trade.
---
Nice
---
Holy crap!  This was always so disappointing to me to only get one sculpture per game on this board.  Knowing I can get more is going to make getting roped in Wild so much more tolerable.  Thanks!
---
Why is this cool?

RAFAAM THE CHUNKY ARCHAEOLOGIST

I defend the existence of Big Priest. I think they are a valid anti-Control deck, and that if people are arguing with me that Eternal is meant to be Eternal, that Big Priest deserves to remain untouched so that future generations can play the deck. It's also mostly a Tier 2 deck right now.
---
That said, it can absolutely flip the board on Turn 4/5/6 depending on what Barnes draws. I've lost numerous games as an Aggro player because of their ability to build a wall and persistently prevent damage. I don't see Yogg as being that different.
---
It's always the right time to quit hearthstone.
---
If you're like mtga more just play that.
---
Yes, and if I want to have more cards after using around 6000 golds, I would play some arena. 
---
Depending on where you look, it's tier two despite the changes to ramp effect at least in part due to some decks it has strong match-ups against rising up in the rankings.
---
Mill Druid is still better generally, yes, but there really aren't many terrible match-ups for the deck right now. Granted, Jade Druid does beat out Mill Druid.
---
Imagine being able to look at you friends’ collection of cards.
---
*distant brode laughter*
---
The first time I hit legend was with a tempo-Yogg mage and I faced 80% of aggro shaman between rank 5 and legend. Yogg was only an issue because it feels bad to lose a tournament with money involve on a random factor. It was neither broken or overpowered compared to other old god legendary like N'Zoth and C'htun and actually offered something a bit different than being crushed by an army of Shaman all the time.
---
In many situations Yogg just effectively casts [[doom!]]. His reputation is so tainted because the word random is on the card. If people treated yogg as a consistent board clear plus some card draw then it wouldn't be nearly as hated. Yes, there are outliers where it does crazy shit but I'd be willing to bet that outliers from a maelstrom portal decide more games than an outlier from yogg saron .

Complete your side of the board with 1/1s
---
Absolutely agree. Current yogg is a joke, not just competitively but also mechanically. Watching 15 spells go off Was fun, watching 2 spells isn't. Regardless of the end result. 
---
Agreed. Back in college my friends and I would sleep over at one apartment when new expansions launched, staying up to craft cards, watch each other open packs, hate on me for being stupidly lucky, and test out decks. All of us that didn’t open Yogg crafted him (my roommate actually crafted him golden because he loved the idea so much), and we all made the most ridiculous decks to synergize with him. We did the same thing with Surrender To Madness and Explore Un’goro.
---
Once Yogg got nerfed and subsequently rotated out, we stopped playing so much. Most moved back to MtG, and now I’m the only one who plays HS, and I only play once a week or so.
---
I want Yogg back! (And a few other major changes, but I digress)
---
Is it just me or is that article written very oddly? I struggle to understand what it's saying.
---
Has he ever streamed rastakhan? I don't recall seeing anything from him since boomsday
---
Lol that looks like a perfect combo
---
F course Trent s white.  
---
You ever seen a brother named Trent?  🤨
---
You're letting a known cheater compete for the World Championship.  This should go well.
---
Shhh treants
---
I mean all reviews are at best previews. They are just predictions without hands on experience. We just all agreed to call them reviews so it gets more views on yt
---
Nah, they managed to survive to elekk + academic espionage. 
---
Because Yogg transforms a Control vs Control matchup in who draws Yogg first and who rolls better with him. Yes, there's stuff like Dirty Rat and Deathlord, but to see a long game just to end with a Yogg is so miserable that half the time you are "Why did I play for". At least, for how Barnes gets (rightfully) hate, it's a 4 mana card, so it's not a waste of 20 minutes and it's less frustating.
---
I was here the month before the Yogg nerf, everyone was sick of him, the ones who played him, the ones don't and the ones watching tournaments.
---
known scammer, beware.
---
Other than highrolling Barnes the deck doesn't really do anything particularly unfair relative to its competition. That's why it's only tier two on most Wild lists.
---
I agree. They can even keep the overload nerf. But please re-vert him to full-casting through death. 
---
I think all nerfed cards should be unnerfed once they hit wild.
---
Congrats, keep chugging along in arena tho. You'll get to 12 eventually the more you play. Warlock is really good right now, might be worth trying them if you're shooting for 12.
---
I only played it a few times when i got him in brawl and every time it was incredibly funny but 7/10 times he killed himself within 2spells and it ended there. Dissapointing.

Is it a consistent effect? Do other cards stop their battlecries if they die?

Eh, people post their pulls here all the time so I thought I would post mine. I’d say it’s pretty crazy that I got 2 legendarys (one being golden) within the first 15 classic packs after the first 10

3/2/2 Mech | Magnetic Deathrattle: Destroy a random enemy minion.  
---
People probably just hold Tess until the end for maximum buildup, play her as a hail mary at 1 hp, and die.
---
Honestly, I loved playing Yogg, I played a tempo mage and would continuing playing with lethal in hand just to up the spell count, and rather than outright kill I let Yogg decide.
---
On the receiving end, it's just as fun because you see amazing things happen.  Given that the spell pool will continually get larger Yogg rolls will only become more and more fun.
---
Why the hell should the vote require a supermajority? If you're going to have a referendum, don't stack the deck against the outcome that you don't want. 
---
Yogg is a 100% RNG card the requires no hand limit playgrounds, no set up, etc.
---
It’s not an OTK deck because OTK decks have a lot of micromanaging they need to do to the moment up until their combo pops off. Yogg is just play any random deck and then drop a card if you’re about to lose.
---
I honestly don’t understand how anyone thinks this is a good idea. If they unnerfed Yogg is probably just quit. I don’t understand how there’s so much (warranted) hate for RNG Barnes, but everyone loves Yogg. 
---
Mind boggling
---
When nerfs hit, out of all the epic/legendary cards I normally DE, Yogg had been the only legendary that I could not get myself to disenchant. 
---
He'd been the first Legendary I opened in my WotOG packs and I still remember being so excited to get him that I greeted him with a little jingle: "Hey, Yogg! Welcome to the party!" I've never been so thrilled to get a legendary since I crafted my very own Fandral Staghelm, 1 year after OG rotation. 
---
I strongly disagree. Imagine what a poker would be like if you decided the outcome purely on the luck of the draw and not on actual decision making and trying to outplay your opponent. That is a key component in any card game. Pre-nerf Yogg was so strong that it could negate let's say a solid 20 turn game and essentially decide it on a simple coin flip. Being on the receiving end of that is not by any means fun especially if you were the one constantly making the correct decisions all game long and just because your opponent has a single card they can win the game. The card just doesn't make the expereiennce fun for both players. For all I care, pre-nerf Yogg might as well read: "Cast Pyroblast until a hero dies". I suggest you go look at all the highlights from insane Yogg's in tournaments and look the reaction of the player on the receiving end.
---
not rng if all minion in the res pool is valued more than the ressurect card cost
---
There are others however that may argue agaisnt that though. I am one of the few who hate 1 card do 6000000 things. Any repeat card feels bad to play against imo. I dislike shudder, tess, zuljin, and TOG minus cthun. But even cthun is meh imo, not guitly of the same design however. It just feels so lazy to me to just replay everything I already did from a designer perspective.
---
I understand this is just my opinion, if Yogg was reverted I would be terribly upset. At least that battlecry isn't every card you already played.
---
I always dust golds I have no immediate use for. If you value the shiny at all, wait a couple weeks and see if it gets enough support. Currently it's unplayable.
---
I don't think I said TS doesn't use data, it's that it is opinion driven.  The opinion of the pros will outweigh the data and this has made some inconsistent meta reports in the past.  I personally found VS to be far more consistent over the years but I don't want to knock TS too hard because more community content is always a good thing and I know those reports take a lot of work.  TS also were the first to create and popularize meta reports in Hearthstone.
---
Personally, I've coached low ranked players with meta decks and it isn't always a  choice or time.  Lower ranked players don't know their mulligans, win conditions, or how to identify their opponents deck. (they don't know the meta decks or what to play around).  And they certainly aren't thinking ahead a few moves.  The knowledge or skill may be minimal to bridge that gap (learn mulligans) but the outcomes could be big.
---
I think it also depends on your data set, but if a Top 100 player, and a Rank 10 player are getting similar winrates in similar matchups, it's more the deck then skill.  If you can squeeze out an extra 5-10% winrate, we start to see it is more the player then the deck in certain matchups.  And for Standard, VS definitely has enough data to do this.  (Wild more debatable).
---
whats hero power have to do with recruit synergy?
---
&gt; Sure, and why don't we just undo all the nerfs in wild so that everyone that has their personal hardon card can their personal fetish back? I liked Kingsbane, so can I get healing poison back as something other than a single-turn use?
---
I'd be down for that. Already, people are resistant to nerfs to their favorite archetypes that have dominated the format for months, so I'd be down for playing with archetypes that I used to love playing.
---
Aren't you the optimist 😁
---
yeah, total shit card
---
No, assembling a combo is different and a perfectly fine way to win. Combo decks keep control decks in check. Assembling a combo is your game plan and win condition and usually your whole deck is built around achieving this goal.
---
The difference is Yogg is not a win condition. You don't build your whole deck around casting Yogg (unless you're Casino Mage but that's a jank drik and beside the point). Yogg is something you throw into a deck to give you a snowball's chance when you've otherwise completely lost the game. You dont cast Yogg when you're ahead and winning a game, only when losing.
---
You may not like losing to combo but at least the combo deck was actively trying to execute their game plan from the start of the game and not relying on a coin flip to bring them back into an otherwise lost game.
---
Yeah, but doesn't change the fact that stuff like this card and Voidlord are still balanced when they aren't cheated out.  
---
They arent problem cards. 
---
My instinctive reaction for Warlock is a return of the Cursed! cards [[Curse of Rafaam]] gave you. Perhaps his Scheme will give you a scaling amount of them.
---
Still bullshit
---
I never said he was an OTK deck, I just said that's how OTK decks work. When your opponent has played a million 2/14 divine shield taunts I don't see how that's supposed to be more fun than yogg.

2/-/- | Give your opponent a 'Cursed!' card. While they hold it, they take 2 damage on their turn.

if you think this game is more about skill and decision making than RNG I've got a bridge to sell you.
---
Some of the most fun games i've played in hearthstone were Yogg offs vs my friend in the days pre-nerf. We both built very different versions of Yogg and had a blast, mine was mass spells Rogue, his was value mage, those games never failed to make us laugh, and I was very sad that they nerfed it, i understood that competitive balance had to come before fun, but yeah wild is for fun and they should revert it.
---
They did it as a Tavern Brawl a couple times, but it's not likely as a permanent mode any time soon.
---
 I strongly disagree. Imagine what a poker game would be like if the outcome was decided purely on the luck of the draw and not on actual decision making and trying to outplay your opponent. That is a key component in any card game. Pre-nerf Yogg was so strong that it could negate let's say a solid 20 turn game and essentially decide it on a simple coin flip. Being on the receiving end of that is not by any means fun especially if you were the one constantly making the correct decisions all game long and just because your opponent has a single card they can win the game. The card just doesn't make the experience fun for both players. For all I care, pre-nerf Yogg might as well read: "Cast Pyroblast until a hero dies". I suggest you go look at all the highlights from insane Yogg's in tournaments and observe the reaction of the player on the receiving end at the exact moment when their opponent slammed Yogg. 
---
As soon as MtG Arena releases a mobile version, I will be playing far less HS as well.  
---
That was before cataclysm, void contract, defile, demonic project, psychic scream, treachery and research project that can really mess with the caster, though 
---
I saw this topic and the first thought was "this guy is watching Thijs playing Wild".
---
Wild?
---
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE THIS IS THE BEST CARD ON THE GAME JUST UNNERF IT ALREADY
---
I'd rather see a limit to X spells max, but uninterruptible than stopping with his death/silence/removal.
---
VS is actually still quite lacking on the data front. But even the best players will have trouble when new to a complicated deck. Tempostorm assumes correct play, which is completely different from a statistical tier list. The example has been done to death but Grim Patron didn't show a particularly stellar winrate at Legend either. And I'd argue that there have been a lot even more complicated decks since.
---
Kinda sad and funny at the same time seeing so many people pretend wild is a serious gamemode when even the devs don't give a damn about it. I'm a wild enthusiast myself but let's not lie to ourselves. We have turn 3 coin Barnes turn 4 double res, or early voidcaller into Mal'ganis, or hell, turn 2 Tyrantus from academic espionage, tho that one is still a standard card. Those are absolute coinflips that decide the game on the spot in most cases. Why would Yogg, an actually cool card that perfectly captures the random fun that's clearly the main phylosophy of the game, be special? 
---
Silver hand recruit is the name of the dudes
---
I 1000% would rather play and lose against a combo deck rather than lose to Yogg induced RNG fiesta.
---
Got me
---
My point was that the feeling he described of having a single card sometimes swing the game was bad is the same as someone instantly defeating you because they had drawn their entire deck and threw all their cards away then murdered a single card. 
---
Combo decks require far less thinking most of the time than any other deck. Draw cards, play cards without care, then play cards that wins game after having done nothing but freeze or clear the board or have 5 ice blocks in a row.
---
Right. After Tess came out the changed her to work the same way, and then changed her back to work the way she works now.

RNG plays a role in the game but so does skill. Yogg removes all skill and makes the game pure RNG. Keep that shit off of ladder.

5-0 and I haven't had a game go past turn 4 yet because everybody concedes when they realize what is about to happen.
---
they also unintentionally made a few broken archetypes as well, and had to nerf them swiftly.
---
They also dilute your deck, no?
---
Feels pretty slow when they ban Golem.
---
Against Mechhunter or Discolock, no. And if the other player is anti-fun, they'd ban your Yogg. Of course you can then concede immediately, so power to you.
---
I'd try Innervate, Biology Project, Living Roots, and Yogg. Maybe replace Innervate for some extra draw, maybe Nourish. Mulligan hard for Biology Project, hope you're playing against somebody fun.

What fun is there in random spells? Literally takes the skill out of the game and fucks u or ur opponent. Randomly. Such a great card.
---
Congratulations ! Are you planning to re-release Khadgar ?
---
I’ve had a lot of success with Springpaw, Crackling Razormaw, Scavenging Hyena, and Animal Companion. No matter which card is banned you still have a formidable aggro 
---
Gloop sprayer doesn't and won't see any play because needing to have 2 minions on board that make duping worthwhile while also having 8 mana to spare is too much to ask for. It's way too slow and most of the time it's an 8 mana do nothing the turn it's played.
---
"Yogg-Fucker!"
---
Thank you. I like how you put effort in all posts you make. Really good to have you as a mod.
---
Please bring him back, my favorite deck of all time is my Yogg deck. I refine it with every expansion!
---
No, Yogg is one of the worst cards of all time. He's all that's bad about Hearthstone's way of handling RNG. 
---
Yogg alone can result in the rest of the game not having mattered at all, and his average result is positive. Well played countering everything I did, here's a board clear and double Call of the Wild. 
---
Unpopular opinion here. Cthun should be able to damage your face and friendly minions since now it can flip a losing match. Blizzard plzz nerf. /s
---
Hagatha saw play(she is just too much value). Ashmore will likely be much more playable with the draw 3 cards tutor
---
No, but you did include both a Shaman card and a Druid card in the list.
---
My opponent has holy wrath, shirvallah and DK...
---
I did something similar. Mechwarper, Annoyotron, Faithful Lumi, and Metaltooth Leaper. 
---
If Mechwarper gets banned, then it is a little slower. If Leaper gets banned, then Lumi does his best. And if Lumi gets banned, then the oponent is screwed.
---
Currently 4-0 with this. Annoyotron has come in handy for blocking any enemy minions they can put down.

---
What is your opinion on the randomness of the Mulligan, the order you draw your cards in, the opponent and what deck they play? This game is nothing but coinflips, skilled players can make that coin slightly weighted but if you want a truly competitive game this isn't it.
---
Hmm. I think it kinda makes sense. If you know three of the cards, then you can choose to break up an obvious spiraling combo and hope that the mystery card isn't worse. Since it doesn't tell you the mystery card unless you choose it, you have a slight disadvantage of not knowing the full deck of the other guy. 
---
Or you can choose to play against the combo you already know, and see what the mystery card was, and then know whether you chose correctly or not.
---
DKs going away was expected, Genn/Baku getting HoFed wasn't.
---
&gt; Yogg is played for fun. If you want to win the game, do not use Yogg. He is not meant to be competetive card
---
This! When you arguw about Yogg beeing fun: He us a solid play right now and still fun. It's only that he has slightly lower chances of winning a game from nowhere - could still happen though. Old Yogg was so strong that every spell heavy deck played it. No clue how going back to that would make it more fun. Imho seeing him much moe often would reduce his fun factor.
---
This deck is some of the most fun I've had in a brawl in years.
---
Wasnt fiery bat named after firebat?
---
If they did and it broke the game, then people will complain about why blizzard prints stupid shit (see baku/genn problem). If they dont, they get blamed for not experimenting (right now).

omg yes, my thoughts exacly,
---
 i member whey i run him in my maly druid as a board clear.
---
My reaction every time my opponent played was exactly, oh, let's see what's going to happen!
---
I think this card is being slept on but what do i know it might be shit lol.
---
Would you really boycot an expansion because a wintrader did a tournament?

Onyxia is worded a bit more in detail so new players can understand the basic mechanic better at first glance.
---
Was that right after Blackrock mountain? Blackrock mountain was my personal favourite. It introduced the if you're holding a dragon kinds of cards and I love that shit. Like when I was a kid playing yugioh and they came out with actual synergistic sets instead of just seeing regular beat down decks everywhere.
---
Probably my cleanest idea of jeklik + soulfire + succ + renounce. They ban jeklik and you renounce everything. They ban renounce and you got jeklik in the starting hand of a disco lock. 
---
Whole lot of fun haters for me too...
---
The last month before an expansion is so dreadful and stale I wish there was a new game mode that can remedy that, I got bored of standard went to wild got bored of wild now just waiting for new cards to be revealed I hate this cycle I have to deal with three times a year
---
Having an absolute blast with Protect the King, Drywhisker, Warpath, and Yogg. 
---
I never said anything about common or rare cards. Your going to disenchant and re craft every time you want to play a new deck? Sounds super fun! and not tedious at all. 
---
Worst case scenario there is always a fix for something like that if it is viewed as a problem. They could limit the frequency of disenchants, so that if you play with "15k" dust your stuck with those cards for "X" amount of days. Or put a cap on how many disenchants you get in a day. Like 3 disenchants per day or week even. Or even go so far as to set the game so you could only disenchant a card once ever. It would allow you to toss away the bad legendaries, while completely blocking you from swapping back and forth between different decks.
---
Also, they could meet us halfway and make the disenchant value of legendaries 800gold and the disenchant value of epics 200gold, which would solve your problem. 
---
Never mind that there are tons of games that are top tier right now that require 0$ to have access to everything and sell only cosmetic things and are quite successful. 
---
Ach! Hans run! It's the Grauselhurzl!
---
The difference is that you can't just plop Barnes, Keleseth, N'zoth or Jade idol into all of your decks on their own and increase their winrate.
---
Unnerfed Yogg was an "oh shit" button that you could always try to play if things didn't go your way and it way too often dug you out of the hole you were in. You can't compare that to cards that do crazy stuff if you build a deck around them.
---
Your opponent's spells cost (0) next turn. **Upgrades each turn**
---
Every single effect that summons an x amount of minions, instantenios or not, willalways trigger knife juggler with every minion
---
Oh man, secret pally with Cauldrons and Yogg. I think I know what deck I'm making today.
---
Same goes to you. Just because not all players didn't mind playing against Yogg doesn't mean that that is a significantly large group. I see a lot more people who either disliked Yogg or are fine with Yogg's current state than those that want it unnerfed. 
---

Do you play much wild? If the answer is no, we don't care.
---
That's the thing though--yogg is not conditional beyond 10 mana. Kingsbane rogue has buildup and can be teched for, same with mechathun--you know you are playing against a kingsbane or mechathun deck early in the match based on the cards they play. Yogg is a 1-card high-variance play that only requires that you play spells, which most decks do. I also love unnerfed yogg and while he is interesting as a last resort-card, he can provide too much value for 1 card. I'm not saying that it would happen consistently or have a &gt;50% winrate, but even decks with low winrates that are extremely fun to pilot but feel bad to lose against can still be bad. If there were a neutral tech card that prevented the next battlecry from triggering (why don't we already have this?), then I'd agree yogg should be unnerfed (and I think he will be eventually).
---
Pretty bad when they ban pogo hopper. Replace zola with counterfeit coin and at least you have the threat of a big tempo Edwin.
---
This is not a thread about the costs of Hearthstone, and everyone knows that F2P means "you can spend time instead of money" regardless of whether they argued about it the "correct" way.

---
There are various criteria that you can choose to apply to dusting when expansions rotate:
---
1. No disenchants
---
2. Disenchant goldens only
---
3. Disenchant 'bad' non-goldens (you can go [here](https://hsreplay.net/cards/) and filter for wild only, pick which expansions are included in the list and which rarities you are interested in, then sort by in % of decks from lowest to highest, and then select cards below a certain % to disenchant. for example i need some extra dust for HoF and looked at the card quality at various %s and decided to disenchant everything below 0.2% - NB that these are the values only for the current wild landscape and may change in the future so there is a small risk)
---
4. Disenchant certain rarities of cards (you lose more absolute dust by disenchanting higher rarity cards, but a smaller relative percentage of dust)
---
5. Disenchant all
---
Don't disenchant for dust until you actually need the dust as there is no downside to waiting, but there might be an upside.

95% chance it'll just be a spell with a murloc getting killed by it in the card art

He doesn't play wild, so of course his opinion should matter more!
---
Ok, I know what the wife and I are doing tonight.
---
I'm playing mech rogue with Mechwarper, Iron Sensei, Zilliax, and... Pogohopper. People keep banning the Pogohopper as if that's the problem card!
---
Dude the sword at April 1st. Is the Turalyon sword?
---
"get pack log out"
---
And yet people still play stuff like 4 mana 7/7 in wild and you're comparing a 12/12 on turn 10 with 42/42 on turn 7. Plus this would be used in a Rogue deck that is proactive so you most likely will fight for the board up till then as well as using whatever you drew from Myra's to secure it.
---
Thank you
---
As it pertains to this topic? Nope. Well said.
---
Bans, huh? It looks like they're testing some tournament mechanics this week. 
---
If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword.
---
With PWS and Radiant you can spam endless boards of 2/6s or 3/3s. Not great, but better than a lot of decks people are coming up with.
---
Try replacing Flamewaker or Apprentice with Luna, means you're guaranteed card draw at the cost of some kill speed. They ban Black Cat and you're dead in the water after a few turns.
---
Ur welcome good friend
---
Haha, so you hate the cost of the game, but jumping through a few hoops to get *infinite value* is where you draw the line? Interesting argument.
---
Even with your proposed "fixes," there's no way they'd sell *more* packs through that system because they're still offering playing nearly infinite amounts of value for little to no investment. Would you personally spend more (or any) money on the game if they had that kind of system when you could just easily have access to the decks you wanted for free? I don't believe that for a second.
---
Try Menacing Nimbus, Earthern Might, Bloodlust, and Electra Stormsurge. They always ban Electra like fools, not realizing that they leave me open to almost always have a full hand, and a strong board.
---
Yes.
---
Other viable cards in this are Likkim and Totem Golem. Not nearly as strong, but if you don't have League or Mean Streets cards it still makes people concede on turn 3.
---
No. April 9th
---
Didn't bunnyhoppor run hooktusk in his rogue deck? 
---
How many games swing massively because your opponent gets Keleseth on turn 2? This is a CARD game. By definition there is randomness. Stop crying about it or go play chess.

Thanks!!

It uses machine learning in combination with Blizzard's own internal win rate data to build the best possible deck with the cards available to you, and tries to use them correctly with other combo cards. Basically almost always builds good decks now.
---
[[Magic Missile]], [[Forbidden Torch]], [[Black Cat]], some other odd card has been fun as hell.
---
If it's fun for you then enjoy! I'm not sure it's fun for them.
---
**TO FACE**
---
One card tomorrow and then nothing for 4 days?  Why not take 2-3 of the cards being mass dumped later on and add them over the weekend?
---
Seriously, what a daft release plan.  
---
Too good.
---
I know how machine learning works.  I've also experimented with the actual feature, and it behaves how I have described.
---
Put in a sufficiently off-meta legendary, it craps out an unrelated meta-deck with a card replaced by the off-meta legendary.  Put in something it does recognise but lack all the cards, and it dumps in random "OK" cards that are often anti-synergistic.  For example, I put in some spiteful summoners, and it gave me a recognisable Spiteful Druid, but I don't have quite all the cards for that deck so it gives me Savage Roar.  That isn't some arcane wisdom from machine learning, that is just bad, just like when it puts Benedictus and a lone Duskbreaker in APM priest.

It was updated just last week, now it tries to build you the best deck it can based on blizzards internal data and your card collection.
---
In theory, it will also use the cards you supply and build the best deck it can find that uses those cards.
---
In practice, if you have a big collection, it'll do a good job of making you decent meta decks. If you are trying to build something off-meta by seeding it with appropriate cards, it will still build you meta decks with those cards added.
---
And if you have a poor collection, it will do a pretty bad job of building a coherent deck, but it will have a mana curve!

**THE MIGHTY**
---

---
I don't understand the discussion that Yogg is some magical coin flip that instantly wins or loses you the game. In most cases, I feel like people are forgetting what can happen. I would say the majority of the time Yogg was not a great late game card. Normally the thing that kills you is card draw. I've had yoggs that draw me 10+ cards.
---
I get it. It's not the most fun card to play against, but you usually win against an opponent who plays it. I seriously don't get the idea that it somehow would be a competitive card. You know what cards don't make it into competitive decks in wild? Sometimes broken combos. There's enough certainty with other broken combos that Yogg wouldn't be a top tier card. It'd be a meme card that sometimes wins you a game in an otherwise impossible situation. But it's not like people are going to start throwing it into competitive decks as an upgrade.
---
Wild is about doing broken combos consistently. Not having chance at extra broken combos.
---
Must have been one of those Dark Souls Chests.
---
I always thought haunting visions was cool because it makes ANY spell you play that turn cost 3 less. Contrary to glyph. 1 mana Hex you already had in hand etc.
---
i think the second one he is referring to is March 27th, a book with a dragon on the cover. My guess is a priest card with dragon synergy that is not a dragon.
---
ealRay atureMay
---
First of all, keleseth isn't relevant in wild so it's not really a good example. 2nd of all, yogg is probably the most random of the randomness. If you are completely winning a game and then suddenly lose with no way to prepare for, it is an absolutely terrible experience. (From a competitive standpoint, saying this as a member of the competitive wild community)

My comment only points out that people are complaining about blizzard experimenting too much and you complain about blizzard not experimenting enough. So blizzard is fucked by the community either way.
---
Like you, I do preffer if they experiment with higher powerlevels as long as they are fast to step up if things need to be fixed. And right now i think things are pretty okey, even with baku and genn in the mix (maybe too stale, but nothing is too strong and good deckbuilding is still rewarded, aslo new archetypes do emerge like the recent odd mage). But im not complaining too about it because at the end, its a desing decision team 5 must do, and either being more experimental or more conservative are both good ways to approach the game.
---
Also, refrain from calling "downer" people that just make a remark in one of your comments. If you dont want a disscusion, just say it, no need to be rude to each other.
---
Yeah something like that would be really cool. It’s asking a lot of blizzard though, don’t think they have the budget for that sort of stuff...
---
I see side boob, I upvote.
---
Masked contender and Kirin tor are powerful. If even a little secret synergy is printed it could work. We also don’t know what might come in the new set this year
---
I've found that running prep, myra's unstable element, academic espionage and pogo hopper usually gets the pogo hopper banned. The deck is still pretty bad, but it can be amusing.
---
Yeah, when fungalmancer comes down only a few board clears have come online. On turn 8 litterally every board clear has been available.

---
they already confirmed somewhere (gotta find the source again) that they are not printing hero cards for the next 3 expacs. 
---
Ok I'm not convinced yet. I made a druid deck test. Did the double beast health card and a few beasts. It made a mechathun deck otherwise. Added no beasts. 
---
Possible that beast druid sucks sp it just ignored the cards
---
I have tried both, sometimes with raptor I ran out of cards in hand. Usually the 1 attack changes close to nothing, but a beast in hand can help. Imo more than the 4/3 in the deck
---
Oh wow I always thought he was a troll
---
I've done a few games with mechwarper, metaltooth leaper, cybertech chip (there are better cards than this), and malchezaar. its pretty dumb, your opponent doesn't have a great chance of getting mechwarper and you can just blow them out real quick.
---
I see cartoon side boob, I sigh and can't relate to those who upvote.
---
Banned card doesn't deserve anything
---
But doesn't Togwaggle and Mechathun cancel each other's combo? Mechathun requires you to have nothing left and for that to happen you have to play Togwaggle+Azalina which will add more cards to your deck/hand and destroy Innervate/Naturalize and even Mechathun itself.
---
My jaws that bite, by ass needs a scratch!
---
Oh, ok then, I'll drop my desire for Yogg to be awesome again. I wouldn't want you to throw a hissy fit and abandon wild and its 20% chance of a game-changing Yogg table flip.
---
I agree
---
I put 2 Pogo hoppers and it gave me no bounce effects. Not even shadowstep. Glad you are having fun though!
---
When i put in Dragon Soul it made me a cool miracle priest deck with Grave Horror

Cata helps wipe nasty enemy boards. Jeklik can work instead of zavs vs burn decks. Won 20 in a row so far
---
I'm not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing that Yogg should be un-nerfed, per say ; it's an interesting question. That said, I kind of agree with people saying that Wild has some far more broken shit these days than a potentially good turn 10 play (specially since, again, Yogg kinda keeps getting worse).
---
Aluneth Mage is definitely a tier 1 deck with its great matchups against Big Priest, Kingsbane and the Warlock spread. Only real bad matchup being paladin.
---
** *CUE CATCHY GNOME MUSIC* **
---
I don’t have prince malchezaar. Love to hear how it works for you. I’ve played this deck like 5-6 times today before getting bored with the brawl and I’ve lost one. 2 were insta concedes after realizing what I’d done. 
---
I'm curious. Do you think that the unnerfed Yogg would enable a competitive wild deck? I'm not arguing that wild is a less competitive format here, I just think that Yogg, even unnerfed, wouldn't really be all that strong and mostly a 10 mana board clear, aka too slow and kinda irrelevant against a lot of currently played decks. 
---
Then why are you on this Subreddit if you dont like the game?

Maybe it's just me, but in both this thread and the earlier one today, the anti-Yogg people seem more consistently to be asshats than the pro-Yogg people. I see far more attacks and putdowns from the anti-Yogg people than the reverse. Maybe it's a sign that y'all need to add a little fun into your lives.

Dude that could mean fucking anything

it pretty bad
---
Have a few Tiny Knights on board followed by two soulariums and it can get out of hand pretty quick. 
---
I believe he’s much more balanced now, being able to kill himself. Still can have lots of random fun... but the nerf was warranted to make him have more chances to flop. To make him have less chances to succeed with competitive players, meaning those who play high ranks. Even though he’s a great addition to just-for-fun decks, when you take in the whole picture, things are better this way.
---
The last two cards are left to Thijs and Kripp to reveal. Interesting
---
You're absolutely right. Without seeing most of the new set, I would guess the meta will speed up just with the DKs rotating. I've been farming Odd Pallys and Midrange Hunters on ladder.
---
Yeah. Let’s not forget what it was like lol
---
Agreed. Maybe we would have been ok with the current Yogg if he'd always been that way, but we remember the glory that was unnerfed Yogg. The current Yogg is a pale imitation who only does something cool about once every eight times now. The days of unnerfed Yogg were among my most memorable ever. Maybe the game now is more balanced and fair, but it's not as fun and memorable.

GODGATOR#1348 NA.  looking to trade 80g quest.  I'll show, you go first plz.
---
Hi Zubbzi,
---
I'm a relatively new player--I started playing around the end of KnC--but I have reached legend a few times and have by far more wins with rogue than any other class. 
---
I would highlight two big mistakes you made (or at least things I would have done differently) in this game on turns 3 and 6.
---
First, you definitely should have played the fledgling on turn three instead of the tar creeper. The longer the game goes on, the higher the likelihood that the hunter will have an efficient answer to fledgling. Flappy bird is best played as early as possible (preferably with the coin) to maximize its chance to snowball out of control. Because your opponent spent the coin on the animal companion, I would have seized the opportunity to get the fledgling out that turn to evade a flanking strike. Your opponent did have kill command, but if they play kc then they're not playing master's call, which if you look at the turns following, was the real reason why you lost the game.
---
Let's look at this line:
---
Turn 3:
---
flappy bird
---
\-kill command
---
Turn 4:
---
hench clan thug
---
Now your opponent has to master's call on turn 4 and can at most play a dire mole. Then you drop the tar creeper; the thug is protected and is a huge threat on the board. And oh wait, they don't have kill command anymore because they used it on the flappy bird!
---
In other words, by playing the tar creeper, you allowed the hunter room to make a value play (draw three cards) because you're not putting any pressure on your opponent. Then the hunter was able to use that value to come back on board. I believe this is the main reason why you lost the game.
---
OK, next:
---
Fungalmancer was fine on turn 6, but you should have played deadly poison and face tanked the hyena. Then you're at 17 life, which is still plenty, and you keep a 5/5 on board. You missed a good tempo swing to preserve some health; I think that was a big mistake. Perhaps you didn't want to use deadly poison because you only had one charge on your dagger. But the tempo from keeping a 5/5 on the board greatly outweighs saving half the value of deadly poison in my opinion.
---
I'll stop here because after that, your chances of winning the game were next to zero. There was nothing you could do that would've really mattered.
---
In general I would say you played too conservatively. You played a one attack minion instead of a card that could win the game by itself, then ceded the board instead of sacrificing a bit of life. Anyways, those of my two cents. Good luck with your climb!
---
True. Just saying he is referenced in the Violet Hold which is related to the expansion. So if any place to put him, it would be here
---
I picked Tarim,stonehill, call to arms, and tirion. Oops
---
Some that I haven’t seen mentioned - cathedral gargoyle (better than shielded minibot, just needs the dragons worth running), Mulchmuncher (with enough treant support), juicy psychmelon (post UI rotation), venomizer, sul’thraze (sees some play already I know), dragon roar + war master voone.
---
Maybe not the absolute most powerful but I can imagine a lot of these seeing play with the right support and after rotation of infinite value deathknights, most otk combos etc.
---
Meh.  Much uglier than Murloc Tinyfin
---
https://youtu.be/0TmoYBcLul8
---
its banned now.  no more fun
---
Look at any competitive sport and try to find a lifetime ban for cheating a single time, it just doesn't happen because its ridiculous overkill. In sports people generally accept that people will try to bend or even overtly break the rules to gain any advantage and giving lifetime bans is crazy because most of the time the cheater learns their lesson and stops.
---
I would probably waste my entire week playing patron warrior in that brawl
---
That's a glove.
---
Plus playing fungal on a pair of 1/1s is still good. Not so much with gloop sprayer. 
---
Most card games actually line up their release dates to the end of the spoiler seasons rather closely. For most players who would actually pre-order booster boxes and other similar products, what's in the box itself usually doesn't matter to them.
---
But... nevermind
---
I feel like the odd requirement doesnt allow you to run enough dragons for a dragon package to work. You also have to cut duskbreaker, bone drake and firetree witchdoctor, some of the best dragon cards.
---
That being said this deck looks interesting. I myself have built/ played control quest priest, odd quest priest, dragon quest priest and a bit of dragon-control priest; since Boomsday. Very fun decks and playable up to rank 10 and even 5

When you mill the new legendary... you know you’ll have made it. 
---
Thanks. They seem to remove these ahead or schedule. Perhaps there is an internal dollar limit that automatically triggers because this isn’t the first time
---
This will make a fine addition to my collection
---
Its just a spam account report and move on
---
It's because the deck with elementals in them is worse than just a generic deck that happens to play the cards you added.
---
The problem is that Yogg is basically "do you play more than four spells? put this in your deck as your oh shit panic button".
---
If Yogg were unnerfed I could easily see decks like Even Shaman and Warlock auto-including it just for the highroll game finisher despite them not running that many spells.
---
It's probably the Bandersnatch.
---
Yup, definitely thought this brawl was about showing off the new deck autocomplete feature.
---
I'd guess that they banned malchazaar after you created the deck
---
They took it away, but reverted it after community outcry since it was considered a non-competitive card.

Druid of the Swarm ?

40 hearthstone packs opening. (you won't believe what happens)

Only if it evolves film a grimer
---
I was living a lie
---
That's a bold statement.
---
I feel like having 8 Kelseths in your deck might not be as effective as you think it is
---
MTG previews cards the same way and have done so for quite some time. 
---
Oh right
---
No beast tag. 
---
I've never seen them put these up and take them down so quickly. Nor have I seen a deal timer like the one I got this time. You are probably right about a dollar cap.
---
Companies pretty much have this stuff down to a science. Other card games do it as well as certain video games, movies, TV shows, etc.
---
Analysis from streamers isn't particularly effective in determining whether or not a set is a good investment anyway. But even if that is a concern of yours, most streamers will likely still try to push out reviews before the set comes out since that kind of content rapidly loses appeal after release.
---
Or they don't find this brawl fun and just want to get their win quick. I play nothing but meme decks, but I'd still have banned Yogg in my first game for the free win so I could never touch this brawl again.
---
looking at you, countess ashmore.
---
I'll be disappointed if the mage villain isn't Infinite Toki.
---
The last expansion was Boomsday, what is a rastakhan? 
---
Yogg compares well to Deathwing. If Deathwing were a neutral 10 mana board clear that *didn't* also discard your hand to play him it would be in almost every single deck as a last ditch effort card.
---
But that wouldn't be nearly as offensive as unnerfed Yogg is.
---
So just think if you would want to play with a Deathwing that didn't have a drawback and was just a neural 10 mana twisting nether with a 12/12 body. Thats how Yogg almost always ends up behaving, except it draws you a ton of cards, often hits your opponent for a ton of damage, and might summon you a full board of minions.

*Maelstrom Portal Intensifies*
---
wow I was wondering what was going on... some guy played odd warrior and it showed me some random shit cards. Then he kept consistantly clearing my board with spend all your armor cards I was so confused. 
---
Same deck, same results. Easiest 100 gold per day of my life.
---
I still think this statement should have been released quite a while ago.
---
Use book rather than fireball - if they do ban apprentice I have options. 
---
fair. I run a one of tolvir warden in most of my versions, so it usually ends up pulling out at least 1 raptor patriarch if it's pre-quest 
---
Couldn't it just be like a hulk hand? It doesn't quite look screwed on to me,  not sure though. 
---
*Plays spirit lash*
---
Elven Minstrel is going away we might need other reliable tutors. I really hope it can become a thing, it's the only standard deck I  play.
---
So should be unnerfed Yogg!
---
that would actually be decent combo disruption for control mage
