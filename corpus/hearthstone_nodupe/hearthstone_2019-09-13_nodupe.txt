Are you sure you're searching in "All Cards" rather than "Standard Cards"? All of the secrets are from Kobolds and Catacombs.
---
Are you searching in standard? There are no rouge secrets in standard right now, so that might be your issue.
---
I would be pissed off is someone gave me a free win to rank up. Would make hitting a level feel pretty bad
---
turns out rogue doesn't have any secrets right now which confuses me, my friend played thief rogue with me and had, like all secrets??
---
Spear is far from the one of the best cards hunter has. It‚Äôs good, but clearly gets outclassed by other cards, such as eagle horn bow.
---
Marked shot is a consideration for midrange, but most lists don‚Äôt run it.
---
The best version of midrange rn is hybrid hunter, and there‚Äôs no way you could fit those inclusions with Subject 9, Hyena Alphas and secrets.
---
Would this prevent the opponent from  targeting their own minions and face (like, they can‚Äôt buff their own minions)
---
you can order 1 piece, the option is below
---
I really wish people would look for other posts about it
---
Why would they HoF Divine Spirit instead of Inner Fire? By itself DS is the better card and has more potential though i wouldnt imagine either seeing much play alone.
---
Either he played secrets from other classes because it‚Äôs thief rogue, or you were playing a wild duel
---
I also had this experience once before, although I was playing Evenlock and my opponent only conceded about a few seconds after seeing the Genn Greymane animation.
---
Maybe because he hated zoo or Cubelock, but was fine with Evenlock
---
Rogue has only ever had 3 secrets. Thief Rogue would steal secrets from other classes.
---
I apparently have a lot to learn, thanks!
---
okay, I must admit I never thought I should do it at 5, good heads up!

I think mdonais in his recent stream said they aren't doing any buffs this expansion.
---
Wow classic has crushed HS
---
Climbed from 10-5, 63% wr since yesterday with this  list that u/dekkster used on his stream not long ago.   Play control, survive until turn 5 and your odds of winning improve drastically. Survive until 9, drop one of your big spells and its basically gg even if your opponent thinks they can still somehow pull it off.   Good luck.

Oh alright yeah same problem here üôÑ
---
Well, infinity is weird, but the way I see it is that you could go an infinite amount of time without it hitting face, but in an infinite amount of time eventually it will hit face. It's really kinda a paradox.
---
How does it get outclassed by eagle horn bow?  They don't even attempt to do the same thing.  If you're talking about win rate or something then you're just wrong as desert spear has a higher win rate than bow in almost every deck that runs both according to hsreplay data.  The highest win rate midrange hunter deck on hsreplay does not play the secret package nor any weapons what-so-ever.  The second highest win rate version has desert spear and its the best card in the deck after Zul'jin.  Considering how versatile the weapon is, the synergy it has with the class cards and how good its stats are, I think it's the best card that that hunter has at this moment.
---
but if you discard the Wish you don't get the other wishes!
---
Yeah, check this article: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/4_mana_7/7
---
It's not a big deal to some, but a Big Demon Control Warlock in Wild let me take the win despite him having lethal many times over in order to push me from rank 16 to 15 for the first time. I tried to reach out to him to tell him thank you, but he never accepted the bnet request. Either way, it was really nice of them, and now that I feel more confident getting to rank 15 now on my own with my decks, I'm going to pay it forward to folks at rank 16!
---
The thing about limits to infinity though, is that whatever value you get for the limit is actually a horizontal asymtote, which means you never actually reach it.
---
Your reasoning is wrong. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But you're right. Blizzard's game would crash within a week or something to update the servers. Also ISP failures would cause a disconnect end game.
---
If you're 5 and opponent is 6 isn't that the giveaway? I only ever play rank 15 opponents when I'm one away from going to rank 15 myself.
---
OP: Look at me. I am the owner of this account now.
---
Honestly, they probably saw the word ‚Äúminions‚Äù at the end of the description, and went dummy autopilot and thought it said ‚ÄùDiscard your lowest cost minion.‚Äù
---
The best hybrid list is listed as secret hunter on hsreplay, not midrange. It has a higher winrate than the best midrange list, and it‚Äôs not even optimized.
---
I usually play in windowed mode, so that could be the cause of this, judging by the weird black lines at the sides too.
---
Hey ObiPawns my friend, what a small world üòÇ
---
Personally I love that everyone else plays net decks. It's pure advantage for me. If you play a good deck and know how to pilot it why would you ever complain about netdecks? That's just free wins, unless you are bad at deck building and just wish everyone else was too.

I mean, it‚Äôs not the craziest idea to start recording before playing Yogg or his puzzle box.
---
Priests entire basic and classic set needs to be rebalanced. Just because the rest of it is trash doesn‚Äôt mean an overpowered one drop should be allowed to stick around. They are gonna have to deal with the issue eventually.
---
That‚Äôs what so many ppl say and I‚Äôm  only a teen lol
---
You find nothing wrong with people using the same fucking five decks over and over and over? You don't like variety?
---
But thats the only way we could theorize what would happen given infinite time. Otherwise there is no question. Either we calculate chance at say 1billion years and get a non 100% chance. Or we calculate chance given infinite time.
---
Basically, we know that the game will end, but we dont know when.
---
The reason netdecking is more painful in hearthstone is the fixed 30 card deck size and fixed mana gain, reducing the randomness. Eternal Ccg has a more varied meta because of nonfixed deck size and Mana gain, allowing people to play around with high risk decks that are still viable. Try eternal ccg imo it's better than hearthstone but unfortunately the production value doesn't match Blizzard's polish
---
I think it's fine that the artists are different, since the other 3 explorers look completely fine. But everything just feels wrong with the new reno art on the cards.
---
Ha, well, my opponents always used it turn one and consistently drew the second and third every game after I finally stabilized, while I use my first to get out of a bad board state and never get it again...
---
Or their deck just randomly has two Antonidas or something else ridiculous.
---
If you can tell him good luck in his climbing
---
Honestly, I think this is a terrible thing to do. It feels so good when you win that final game to get legend for the first time, and I think that would be diminished if the opponent concedes a game you would otherwise have lost. 
---
I will certainly screw around with janky decks, or decks I‚Äôm not familiar with, at the rank floors. And if I‚Äôm at legend playing a rank 1 player, then yeah I sort of hope they beat me. But they will actually have to do that if they want the card back.
---
Well I feel stressed now

Already deleted everything, even nuked every trace of Battle.net with Revo uninstaller. Will try deactivating Windows Defender though!
---
Who said anyone misplayed?
---
My first time into legend was with Healadin back when Miracle Rogue was the most popular deck (a deck I conceded to turn 1, absolutely hopeless as they could put 30 to face in one turn with Leeroy, 2x Shadowstep, 2x Cold Blood, Prep, Eviscerate). Fortunately I faced the same Warrior three times in a row to break in.
---
Can also use Shadowstep as rogue
---
I wish they did it like elder scrolls legends where you "discover" the highest rarity card in the pack
---
You outlaw these things for kids.

Oh this decks feels like Token druid.. why not sea giant?
---

yes

like copying whatever deck you find first when googling for highlander decks
---

---
&gt;I just imagine its a 14 year old dressed like fred durst. 
---
Oh man...I dressed like Fred when I was 14...
---
That's fair, tbh my opionin on Zephrys only really shifted over the last couple of days.
---
Dragon+tempo/control/mind blast/ds if, quest priest+benedict, big/gallery/wall priest, spiteful, raza, mechathun, apm priest, weasel. Even if you consider ds if decks only, there are variations that run dragon, resurrect, mech package...Same deck for sure.
---
But 100% fun though, right?
---
My main beef is with hunter and Druid tbh :p My potential fix would be that it could only give you cards from your own class, though that is a BIG nerf
---
Restrict his discover as any other discover. Use all available sets instead. Bam problem solved
---
I think ultimately when a card is played as much as he is then people will get tired of it, regardless of how cool the design is.
---
I'll look it up. Thanks
---
&gt;Playing on the receiving end of things, those kind of stats feel pretty representative, though once again, small sample.
---
You have a non-zero number of games against quest singleton hunter?
---
Chairface#1280 trade 80g. NA region
---
All kinds of combo plans fall to Dirty Rats (and other hand and deck disruption).
---
The Highlander limitation isn't quite as much of a limitation though, because of the time in which you play him and because of how these interactions work in Hearthstone.
---
You don't need a full highlander deck to play Zeph, you just need to thin the deck enough to make him activate. Which isn't too hard to do, and considering that you want to play him late game as a finisher anyway, then it's a lot more likely for him to be active.
---
Don't get me wrong, Zeph is a great card. It's the kind of card that can only be done in a digital game like Hearthstone. It's great fun and interesting and takes some amount of skill and practice to be good at him. But by the time he rolls out of standard, everybody is going to be happy about it.
---
Any deck that appears In standard that wants to cheat out big stuff can use collosus as one of the threats. Shaman only has fountain and alakir, warrior doesn't have much, paladin only tirion and shirvalla. And all those 3 classes have cool ways to cheat out minions into play right now (Eureka, muckmorpher, boomreaver, boomship, the 10 mana warrior spell thing, duel, prismatic lense).
---
That's why I think that if any big deck gets more support in the next expansions, one of this classes would absolutely use collosus. But mague quest can't really get better than right now, and right now is useless, so that's why I said that in my opinion collosus is a better legendary.
---
with fix you mean it should care about the mega-winfury? ...that then means that every new set, they need to change zephrys by a lot. They won't do that. You should be able to learn what you can expect from zeph, and once you did, play accordingly. having zeph change with each expansion goes against that and is not worth the programming effort imho.
---
Didn't think of that; Dirty rat is in wild so you can ignore it by playing standard, but there's also the warlock one. 
---
Ah well, add this to the rock paper scissor pile!
---
Obviously NOT, because in real life pokemon/magic etc card packs are also not classified as gambling.
---
My question is why the best battlecry in the game is on a 3/2 body. Shouldn‚Äôt Zephrys be a 1/1 for 2 mana?
---
In dalaran heist : Got the ring which normally costs 9 mana : discover a legendary and summon 5 of them. 
---
And in the shop I got lucky and bought the effect which reduces the cost of one of your card to 0. I got lucky and it hit the ring. And basically I had it in my starting hand
---
So real quick, not trying to brag I‚Äôm just really really hyped on this shit!!! I‚Äôve been playing this game for 4 years and it‚Äôs always been a dream of mine to build a ‚Äúmeta breaker‚Äù type deck and it‚Äôs finally happened! I wanna thank everyone who‚Äôs tried it so far and I hope it really sticks and shifts the meta! I really wanna become known as an amazing deck builder so I will have more decks to come! In the meantime enjoy steam rolling people with fishies!!
---
i¬¥m good with it. i¬¥m just frustrated because the card does not give me always the perfect card. they should lower the chance of cards like argus being offered when you need value, and update his knowledge of lethal situains / sustain situations.
---
Kobolds revere Rod of Roasting as true skill testing card!
---
Oh ok. That's pretty broken lol
---
If you start tilting take a break, watch pros play your deck so you find new ways of playing that you didn't consider before.
---
Have you ever stepped on a lego? It ain't no joke man
---
This is a common misconception but having 0% chance of something to happen does not mean that it can not happen.
---
Let's for example draw a real number between 0 and 1. So lets say you have drawn the number x after that.
---
Drawing the number x had a 0% chance this time, yes it even has 0% chance that you draw a rational number. But this does not mean, that it "can not happen".
---
Take that sweet L, fam.
---
Still can't play
---
Not really, I think you just remember it wrong. They said that a puzzle box cannot cast another puzzle box, but Yogg himself can cast it.
---
I think they said puzzle box can't cast puzzle box
---
Its high-roll city out there.  The skill/strategy is long gone and has been replaced by "did I draw my busted stuff before you did?".  Game is 100% RNG/draw luck now.  Thats fine but it does suck most of the fun out of it.  Dont spend a nickel on it..... please dont.

crushed some battlecry shamans with my vault hunter...worth it ( ‡≤† Õú ñ‡≤†)
---
I'm not saying the strategy involves having something on the board for all those turns. It could be a strategy that ends up with you  setting up a board on the last turn that the class normally couldn't deal with.  Then rouge suddenly throws down a Twisting Nether or whatever the case may be. Couldn't you play around Twisting Nether?  Sure, but the point is then you often end up in a situation where there's something else you should have played around because of Zephrys.
---
Nice
---
I don‚Äôt think the logic works here. Rat is only one card so the control deck can still have some efficient removals in hand with it to deal with aggro, and the rat body itself is actually great against aggro decks. Also, control decks potentially don‚Äôt even have to draw rat until after aggro can‚Äôt win anymore if they get to pick their draw order. They just have to draw rat before combo decks get to their combo.
---
Zephrys is quickly becoming one of my least favorite cards. It's just too positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at two mana your opponent drops him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives him THE PERFECT CARD to use later in the game. And they also get this aannoying 3/2 that is too big too ping.
---
But more than that Z is just so damn annoying. He comes on the board like "Of course I'm perfect" and I'm like "Here we go again, fuck this shit" and when he attacks he's like "Alakazam" and I'm like "Isn't that a Shaq movie you dumb POS" He doesn't say some cool macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "nah Imma go with a magician cliche" And he looks so smug and stupid. I mean this is a genie literally living forever by magic. He understands his life is a permanent magical gift and the dude is just fucking full of himself. I mean look at his face he's just so smarmy and full of crap.
---
I am literally always sad when Zephrys is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) is a pretty stupid card
---
I think the biggest problem is people including it in non-highlander decks and just drawing a ton to make him online. Maybe the card should say ‚Äúif you started the game with no duplicates in your deck‚Äù activate
---
I strongly disagree. Even if it's design is arguably cool, the problem is the spike in power that the card produces. The card, if used right, can win games by itself (and even worse, games you have no business on winning). The card can be compared to Yogg-Saron, and will be hated for the same reasons.
---
use hearthpwn. theres always a thread open that trades the quest.
---
This is an intresting nerf for him, blizzard please make this a reality!
---
No
---
Zeph is another example of Blizz saying "fuck you" to what used to be a strategy game. We already had to deal with decks where the old construction limits have no meaning and it's impossible to try and play by deducing what cards your opponent might have in reserve and play around them and now we have to deal with people being able to just pull cards even from outside their class out of thin air.
---
&gt; much less fun.
---
It would be way more fun for your opponent
---
Aarh the ol‚Äô shame-concede - we‚Äôve all been there
---
Give him a couple of weeks, he will hate him as well.
---
Recently got back into ranked and went from 15-5. I found the biggest difference between going from 15-10 and 10-5 was that you have to learn the other meta decks to know how to play around them rather than just relying on your own good curve and combos. You learn this just by playing but if you‚Äôre really serious you can write/type out notes for each class/deck you play against with notes on cards and combos you need to watch out for.
---
Good luck!
---
I‚Äôm holding onto it for now with my fingers crossed
---
The faceless manipulator would keep the buff though, so it wouldn't be behind
---
So what, rogue just togwaggle schemes 10 copies of zeph into their deck and never loses?
---
Just In time for tombs of terror
---
This would be great but it would be about 10,000 times harder to create since they would have to create 18 different perfect card pools, and they would have to update it vastly every expansion.
---
God bless Classic WoW that allows me to ignore this dark ages. I don't know why but I always end up enjoying the pre-nerf meta way more than the post-nerf (the decks I hate always end up on top after nerfs).
---
Happens when you don't have the golden animation downloaded
---
Rover is also an expansion card that'll eventually rotate out and they've said that expansion cards are supposed to be stronger. Yeah, they should definitely do something to Cleric. I personally think they should HoFed her as she's a card draw engine that doesn't fit Blizzard's idea of Priest identity and limits what cards they can give to Pries if they're really into this class identity thing.
---
that would be even stronger...
---
Sounds like you got unlucky fam
---
For decks that totally destroy aggro no matter what, it is definitively a fun match up to have, a warm up for the next opponent.
---
Run a baleful banker
---
I barely managed with Tess... but how‚Äôd you win with Toki? She‚Äôs killing me more than the bosses.
---
How about "if your deck starts with and has no duplicates"? (Don't know how to word it better sorry English is not my main). This wouldn't change how Highlander deck at all and non-singleton deck can't abuse the effect.
---
I would love to do this... for a reward. I can only take so much hearthstone before I alt-F4 out of pure rage or boredom.
---
I'm sure you think you do, but you definitely don't.
---
There was someone else in another comment thread complaining about my username on this same post. I‚Äôm done replying to people who aren‚Äôt asking questions about the deck as of right now this is straight annoying. You‚Äôre welcome for the list everyone! There will be more to come!

Play wild. There's plenty of cheap good decks. Secret mage and mech hunter are prob most common, but people are increasingly running counters to secret mage like eater of secrets. I have at least 5 decks that can give an easy 5 with 2-3k dust cost.

I won with Toki by getting Double Time and Robe of the Magi and getting card buckets which have spells relying on RNG. If you get bad results just hero power and try again. Good luck.

I honestly don't remember... But it was fun ;)

Same here but without the emote. It was a Warlock, which conceded directly and let me finally reach legend. I'm still thankful for that tbh, because now I don't care much, if I'm reaching legend again. Games from Rank 5 to legend became much less stressful now.
---
I thought the "master volume" slider changed the levels of ALL sounds coming from the game, including music?

...why would you run Singleton without Zephrys
---
I don't have him....
---
I've gotten 160 gold from doing this.  A fair price to pay for removing that tiny bit of competition.
---
Looks preeeeeeeety highrolly. You need to get finley fast. Looks fun though when it works.
---
It reminds me of the unstable evolution shaman, that would risk it all to get a radiant elemental or sorcerer apprentice from evolving a 1 cost minion (like the spark tokens and similar), and then create a big board of 10 cost minions + a 3 cost minion. Its unstopabble when it happens early, but it depends heavily on getting a specific random card.
---
Yes, exactly!  It‚Äôs terrible for the game long-term and destroys any semblance of class identity. It‚Äôs also why the only control decks in this meta can rebuild their value over and over (quest shaman, quest Druid, quest pally, control warrior), because anyone who builds one uniquely strong board state is facing an automatic mass dispel or brawl by turn 7.
---
What a letdown. Could not have been anyone but TeddyKGB.
---
I skimmed it the first time, went back after reading your comment, and my face involuntarily scrunched up.
---
That's true
---
More like you've been experiencing variance.
---
Most quests are worth fifty gold as it stands anyway.
---
Granted, the fact you're keeping track of this is a little obsessive.
---
As with most 'handicaps' in hearthstone, they are not severe enough or people find a way round the downside to abuse. "Summon a 1 to 4 mana card? I'll only play 4 mana cards!"...etc etc.
---
Singleton decks isn't much of a downside with the insane power creep we've been seeing this last year or so. Look at the new quests? We think Blizzard wants to move away from 'infinite value' hero cards, then they introduce new quests like shaman and paladin, that will only get stronger over time with new cards....like, why? Oh right, to sell packs, cause all you guys complain when a new set isn't full of busted cards.
---
This is the best fan art I have ever seen.
---
Would be great for me, I play Zephrys rogue but hate being hard countered by bomb warrior. Not that I encounter that many bomb warriors anymore, but this would completely negate that counter.

Ah, makes sense.
---
Have you made sure you won‚Äôt hit the turn limit? Because it would be heartbreaking to not win after all this.
---
Zilliax is the most popular card in the game and boom is probably the single strongest card effect in the game, so they are both extremely safe crafts if you want to play control.
---
Bro this is HIS LIST! He actually created murlocs in wow
---
It‚Äôs a question!

I think you're baiting. But still you can certainly play other classes to counter warlock.

Yep. But first: that is only one card; second: it is neutral so any class can use it and third: there is still has a randomness flavour such that you cannot use it as a part of OTK (though there were some attempts).
---
I am not saying that it will not nerfed, it is just one of those cards which has a lot of use cases which do not necessary break the game.

Great drawing! I'm sure Blizzard didn't realize it, but there are times when Hearthstone is just enough nostalgia to sate me from returing to WoW. Seeing an Anubisath like this is one of those times. Thanks for helping keep the MMO cravings at bay!

Thank you for caring to us lazies! Haha

Hmmm nice

I hope when they do dual class arena again they unrestrict the arena rotation entirely to include all Wild sets, even HoF.
---
I‚Äôm not baiting, it‚Äôs just that a 3/9 that drops 3 1/3s on turn 4 every single time is totally cracked an not fun to play against, if I have to play a deck totally filled to the brim with hexes and polymorfs or throw my whole board then have to deal with these taunts are crazy

Zoo ist just a bit weak right now and I would actually recommend running highlander zoo. Just for Zephrys.

I‚Äôm super happy.  Love the meta.  Love Zephrys.  Love blizzard.  Theres no edge in my reply to your comment.  Just truth.

Great rebuttal.  4 stars.

I love to counter-BM though. I had one of those "Hello" "Hello" Big Priests earlier and I was playing Big Rogue. He's BMing as he plays his Shadow Essences and I counter with Sap, BMing as he plays his first Eternal Servitude. He stopped BMing when I hit my power turn after Anka where I traded my Silver Vanguard to pull out Kel'Thuzad, then Backstabbed my own 1/1 Sylvanas to steal his Ragnaros.

Thank you.

H-how about a f-funnel cake for desert
---
looks really good; but honestly could just remove the pupils to give it a look like "bad cop with sunglasses"
---
IMO Zephrys were like DKs
---
Awesome... for one expansion and that's it. Zephrys is not a good card for the game
---
If you can affect your mana before playing, to the cost of the card you want you have a good chance of getting it.  
---
Could you imagine this sub if it was perfect haha.
---
I think he would have been better as a adventure treasure or something. That's what he reads like
---
Despair... so delicious.
---
Gotta love stealing big priest minions, it limits them so much.
---
Very nice. Great skills.
---

---
Argent#11448 trading 80g quest on NA, I show you go first. Check my history of many past trades.
---
My biggest problem with Zephrys is class identity and they even admitted that dual class cards where a mistake so why contradict yourself by making this card?
---
This shit legendary braw
---
I saw a YouTube video where he offers lethalwith spell damage. It might be a recent change tough.
---
Im hoping theres an armor pierce mechanic where any damage the card does is doubled against armor
---
Thanks :D

Worked here! You need to restart the computer.
---
Don't blame things you can't control. Focus on your own choices. If the meta is aggro then you can run double giggling or double Mc tech. Don't use aggro meta as an excuse. I saw in your comment that you are running swamp queen h and arena fanatic. That is a mistake in general but especially in an aggro pocket meta. Those cards are too slow and clunky.
---
 Your deck archetype is fine for getting rank 5, I just did it with 70% w. R. but note that it's not the easiest. There are many better archetypes VS the laddermets right now but I doubt it's worth crafting them VS learning your deck.
---
Yeah I did. But Im glad it exists. It was created to destroy big priest and it finally has enough support. Its probably gonna be nerfed soon though, either flakmage or cloud prince
---
I opened the new brann so ive been trying to summon 3 krushes in a turn
---
 Also made a super "anti-counterplay" deck that is just quest shaman with mill and many dirty rat kinda cards to counter secret mage. Ran it for a few games b4 legend but didnt want to drop rank so much. But now its free real estate
---
Those are the games that make me yell "get rekt!!!" at my screen
---
tasty
---
I'm running lackey zoo and my win rate is just over 60%. Made it to rank 1 earlier today, gonna push for legend tomorrow. It's not that I'm not winning games, it's that I'm playing a more board centric deck instead of control and I'm really starting to realise how much of a nonsense card zephrys is.
---
You'd best get rid of those onions, boi.
---
That would be absurdly broken and be hall of famed or changed drastically  only weeks after release
---
OminouS#2451 EU 80G trade.
---
I don't think OP is saying they invented Murloc Shaman.  Changing 6 cards in a deck makes it their 'version' of Murloc Shaman.  Just like the popular Quest Hunter deck is known as Firebat's Quest Hunter, even though there's only so many ways you can build that deck and the only really non-standard cards are the Ursatron and Bone Wraith.
---
Be quiet you rank 20 pleb. Imagine thinking Soul of the Murloc is better than Siamat
---
i don't enjoy using the word "yikes" but I have to
---
I eat the cheese after twirling it up with a fork like speghetti, I then lap up the sauce with my tongue, finally I roll the dough into a little burrito which I push down my throat without chewing so it lands in my stomach like a little lifeboat.
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
Your story doesn't add up considering you can't drop from 5 to 8. On top of that, what you're claiming would have been discovered a long time ago considering the massive number of games that are tracked. No one has ever shown a shred of evidence that this kind of rigged matchmaking is happening. Not only that, it makes no logistical sense. There's no way they'd be able to execute something like that effectively in a way that would benefit them while evading detection.
---
I love this, keep up the good work, I really like how the Anubis is like a rocky statue
---
He‚Äôs insanely tilting when you‚Äôre playing Zoo, to the point that it feels like he‚Äôs singlehandedly preventing Zoo from being playable.  Sacrificial Pact being an option from him destroys your entire gameplan since the 5/5 from EVIL Recruiter is a demon.
---
I‚Äôve thought since the moment he was revealed he was far too strong and inherently unfun, but he fits in perfectly with the ‚Äúunpredictable, wacky moments!‚Äù vision that the devs have for Hearthstone.  He‚Äôs just one more generated card that you can‚Äôt play around.  He also massively reinforces the idea of a swing turn rather than playing for incremental advantages, which also can make games feel hopeless and frustrating when you‚Äôre on the receiving end of a swing.
---
So yeah, agree completely about him being unfun and annoying, but he‚Äôs sort of a perfect distillation of what the dev team wants the game to be.  I‚Äôd be absolutely shocked if they ever adjust him at all.
---
But how did it taste?
---
Hahaha, well props to you for putting it together and sharing with us. Have a cool weekend.
---
I think Nomi is more important than Zephrys. Zephrys gives you answers to whatever your opponent does but doesn't really give you an endgame. Leeroy is more versatile for having cheap aggro decks that are competitive. I crafted all three. 
---
I was mostly playing paladin since I'm trying to get to level 60 with all the heros. If I just wanted a cheap competitive deck I probably would've stayed with mech hunter since you only need zilliax in addition to Leeroy (and snip snap which was free)
---
This is just false.  The old adventure system was much cheaper than the current one, because the current one launches alongside an expansion, not in place of one.  It is so easy to see that 2800g is cheaper than whatever you spend on Uldum packs to have enough cards to make deck, especially if you're *also* paying 2800g for the PvE as well.
---
I play PvP, but I also like to have the option of PvE.  The new system pretty much forces me to choose one or the other, as a f2p player.  I don't have an extra 2-3k gold to hang onto until the adventure drops, and the adventure rewards don't make up the difference.
---
The solution to armor is not to introduce a mechanic that undermines the core concept of armor. What should a card that ignores 29 armor to kill you by dealing one damage cost?

Noggenfogger's rules are weird, targeted spells won't hit elusive (e.g. Faerie Dragon) minions but stealthed minions are fair game and so is face in case of Icehowl and Fool's Bane. Hero/minion attacks will never be redirected to friendlies however and neither will spells that specify enemy characters.

Because when has this EXACT decklist been posted on Vicious Syndicate? When has anyone hit top 100 legend with this EXACT list before me? Never. Wanna know why? Because they didn‚Äôt have my list. This is my list not only because my name is literally on it right there, but also because I‚Äôm the one who not only created this exact list, I‚Äôm the first one to take it to top 100 legend. Then after I gave my list to my friend Carnation he took it to top 25 legend right after. And if you think Leeroy and Siamat are bad cards than you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. They have 2 of the highest winrates in standard.  Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt say shit when firebat or dog make a deck and call it theirs after only changing 4 cards. So why do I need to replace 15? Or 30? Or what ever amount would satisfy you salty fucks lmao. I‚Äôm done replying to you, keep using my list tho
---
OK, so, you know about hero cards? The "original 9" Were Death Knight versions of the main heroes. 
---
The Paladin one, Uther of the Ebon Blade, has a hero power that summons a unique 2/2 "horseman". If you summon all "four horseman", you win the game straight-up, Mecha'thun-style.

This was the first "true exodia"-style card introduced.

Sweet thanks
---
Yeah, still hate the original Reno. all highlander vs aggro games in that meta revolved around drawing reno or not. the entire rest of the match, mulligan, etc didn't actually matter.
---
The quote you posted is when OP was already on a salt binge, originally OP was just happy that VS put 'FU4FREE' on the meta report.  Which I can understand, I made a guide for a value/control hunter deck last expansion and it was pretty gratifying to see it pop up on hsreplay after I made the guide.
