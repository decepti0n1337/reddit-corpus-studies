An opponents Freezing Trap destroyed my shrine on boss 8 once. I lost that match. :'(
---
0 mana zillis my friend, pretty OP
---
I did misplay in another way though: I shouldn't have attacked with the first Zilli before drawing, should've seen if I drew a second/third one, then attached them and heal for 6/9 even 12 if I were really lucky. Even if I did that I'd have died though, so I was screwed regardless.

---
Oh, I looked up the deck online before I commented.
---
This expansion was an RNG filled balance nightmare and one of the most unfun metas in history. I'll glady forget it.
---
Me losing? Not today.
---
I play my decks only in ranked too. I share them with the community. My only purpose is to let players have fun with fresh decks... 
---
IDGAF to the meta, to my rank, or to win or loose, IDGAF at all. It's a game, and people like you are taking it too seriously (risking what? Losing stars? Is this a joke?) in casual too.

When she said "You have no idea what I'm capable of!", she *meant* it.

Well that's weird because ass hat is the proper saying, if you say hat ass, people must think you're insane

---
"I must not got complacent".
---
Iiiiiii'm not sure that word means what you think it means...
---
Yup, seriously. Not only was that set super unbalanced (Hello Shamanstone, hello Spirit Claws and Maelstrom Portal) but it was also filled with dumb random card generation (Swashburglar, Babbling Book, Portals)
---
Look up midrange hunter. You can make that deck pretty much with beast master and what ever other beasts you have.
---
you can spend your time arguing semantics if you'd like, but my intended statement was clear and valid. perhaps reread it a few times until you understand it better
---
[removed]
---
Guys I'm so fucking ready for this movie
---
So he likely went second and burned a lot of resources. It’s not like rogue can often completely reload their hand on turn 3. They we t all in and it’s not common, hold that shit
---
Miscreant I personally don't think needs a nerf. It has to be comboed and if you do it on turn 3 you do nothing else on that turn. Stats wise it's also not very aggressive so I think it's okay now. I'm down with the raiding party nerf though.
---
please add more rng cards into a cardgame.
---
designed by morons for morons. gj.
---
Summoner mage looks so braindead compared to Big Spell Mage.
---
I picked a god my guy
---
Yeah. That's where it doesn't make sense to me
---
"That didn't quite hit the mark"
---
It's better to break their spirit early before they get sucked into the game.
---
When an expansion releases with crazy taunts black knight will be in decks the first couple weeks.
---
It's got at least 14 hs logos.
---
Mobile all the way. I bought my Galaxy tablet just to play hearthstone on a bigger screen.
---
I decided to add the Archmage Vargoth and it is working very well with this deck. Thank u for suggesting a legendary or else this would have flew over my head!
---
r/lostredditors
---
I would love this
---
Somebody set you up the bomb.
---
I am by no means an expert, and there's probably a lot of nuance I'm glossing over, but I have some time lol. When building a deck you want a goal:
---
For aggro, it's usually filled with cheap minions that you use to build up advantage on board until you can switch gears and go for face damage. 
---
For midrange, it's to play on curve minions (meaning you're using most of your Mana every turn on the largest minion possible) and you play a more controlling style vs aggro while playing a more aggressive style against control decks.
---
For control, you react to your opponent with aoe and removal until you reach your win condition, which can be a combo, some big minions, or just simply grinding out your opponent's resources.
---
There's other deck archetypes but these are kinda the basic ones.
---
So for your deck, if you want to go more aggressive, you can lower your curve, play more 1 cost minions in place of your control cards (flamestrike, polymorph, mirror image) and try to finish out the game with burn/chargers like fireball/ leeroy jenkins etc.
---
If you want it to be more midrange, you want more value out of your minions, so maybe a mech package, with mecharoo, framebot, harvest golem, replicating menace, wargear. Notice they flow into each other, every turn you have a minion to play that uses all of your Mana.
---
For control, you can replace your low end with more aoe, like Blizzards. Though I'm not really sure what you can use for you win condition. You could do like Antonidas + cheap spell generators to get enough fireballs to burn your opponent's face. Or Alexstrazsa + burn.
---
hey im crazy drunk rn but i really appreciate what you do man, concatenaing the best of hte customehearthstone content into one post isn't a huge effort but damn i look forward to every saturday becuse even thouse these cards arent that well-balanced or inline with team 5's policy they are usually super creative.
---
and i say this even though i know you're not /u/coolboypai, thank you for doing this every week (directed at you coolboypai) even thoufh i think in the last few weeks i don't remember you posting and i'd forgotten about this, i love it, thank you. i checked out thees threads every time you posted and people were like 'wow these cards are so imba' but it doesn't amtter, they're so fun and innovative i look forward to each saturday because its so fun to read peoples creativity. thank you! i've been wanting to say how much i love these Top Cards posts but i've never gotten around ot it. they havent shown up for a few weeks and i forgot what they were like but man. i love them! thank you!!!!!!!
---
omega-lette is awesome, i've been playing shufflelock like crazy because its so fun to get the most out of fel lord whatever with the draw thing, shit like dereanged doctor and safeguard popping and giving you 30 health in one turn? magic. imagine getting oblivitron and summoning a load of cool shit, fuck yeah!
---
pegasus FUCKYEAH! its like you can get a ton of value at no detriment from your opponent apart from having to sit throug tons of legendary animations. i wish they added more animations becuase they're so fun. i like deathwings. imagine if every murloc you played did th edeathwing fire!
---
armed chest is like the shark guy but different and not legendary. i played the shark guy in tesspionage rogue (my second favourite deck next to Renounce) but having more ways to get the lifesteal weapon. so good.that weapon is the best because if they dont have two oozes (wjo has two oozes in this day and age? come on) you can gain like 9hp per turn by hitting the guy in the face. like, yeah you can use the spell that draws pirates and a weapon but if a chest could eat it i'd run that too. a 2/4 for 4 mana is pretty decent too. please stop running spellbreaker as a one off so i can have fun please.
---
i dont know who kill jayden is (never palyed wow) but that scheme is so cool . i love the new demon cards that shuffle rush guys into your deck. i love bomb warrior because it makes me feel like kira yoshikage. you never knwo when that shit it gonna pop up! boom 4 guys with rush and 2 attack to fuck you up. i assume the upgrade is to add guys and not attack/health so that's cool. suddenly your deck fills with rush guys! choose when to do it perfectly so you don't fill your board! awesome card. awesome tie in with the effects introduced in dalaran height or whatever this current expansion is. so much better than the current warlock scheme. that just caps off at 7 because of board space! dont make it cap. the coool thing about the schmes is that they go into infinity (OR the turn limit if you want to be pedantic). like 50 armor from dr boom scheme! full heal from hagatha scheme + lifesteal! thats what makes em cool!
---
kobold giant is okay. yeah the schemes are cool! shuffle 20 of these guys into your deck with togwaggle and play em all as you draw them. awesome.
---
start of game cards are hard to balance but man tribal synergy and equality is the best. i love amalgam! its so cool how you can get it form every effect and you can suddenly do so much shit to it, like eat it with the crabs! god i love that card! blizz please print that card every rotation, and another whizbang, and another renounce. thanks! OH and the dragon/murloc card is cool too, i love dragon paladin and if it had the aggro pressure from murlocks it would be crazy!
---
YES you know how i said i love renounce and espionage? i love darkmoon faire because it's so much fun and you can save the coina nd do a 1 mana mind control on the guys zilliax. add this card righ tnow!
---
god i love the doomsayer corruptions like that old gods one that suddenly became a 7/7. this one slowly gets more and mor epowerful, and its kidn of bad compared to the regular doomsayer, but i love her! the art is so cute and i respect the card designer for choosing such a cute art.
---
I AM MALGANIS I AM A TURTLE FUCK YEAH and it summons him like that mage card summons ragnaros? seems very strong for a neutral card but i want to make a portal deck that suddenly draws a bunch of 4/4s and FUCKS YOU UP! yeah!!!!!!
---
and finally the last legendary is so cool and neat and compliments a fatigue game AND increases the skill level by making your opponent think about positioning. amazing...
---
in conclusion thanks for reading and im not sure if all of this will fit into one reddit comment. but i want to stress that i love you op and i love cool boy pai and your contributions, and to all of the members of custom heartstone. this isnt a joke, i legitamitely think that creativity in this form is excellent and i used to post ideas for weapons and stuff in old tf2 forums in my spare time and this really activates my nostaliga. thank you for bringing this up and keep doing so every saturday. i missed you when you didnt post even though i didnt realise it. thank you!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Toki was the only one I was able to finish with
---
Probably forcing the game to run on Directx 11
---
Been there. Done that.
---
'left' is a concept that is the same for both players, it's like your facing a mirror. but i agree it isn't entirely intuitive. it's a weird one and it's probably the reason that cards the explicitly mention 'left' or 'right' are kept solely to adventures and single player content. as long as there was some way to stress that one player's left was the same as the others, it would be lots of fun to play around!
---
i think the boss that uses 'your leftmost minion' was in blackrock? i'll go look it up
---
Funny thing is that guy does (or did?) have an ad going - for the tri-class cards
---
\*Opponent plays equality\*
---
Behold, the duality of men
---
I ruined two wild decks by mistake cause of that shit, had to go back to my deck tracker and look for previous versions of it
---
I believe there is an argument here to be made about river crocolisk being a bit better than the raptor? sure the raptor is a 3/2 for 2 mana which is more damage? but a 2/2 trades into it easily, while the crocolisk being 2/3 is slighly harder to remove in the early game? Idk that might be outdated thinking, but i think generally you want to go for high health minions if they don't have effects.
---
Is that your favorite card?
---
I’ll do quests whereever I feel like with any deck I want.
---
Thanks though.
---
You’re the bestest snowflake ever.
---
“Still lost”
---
Wasn't Abyssal Enforcer banned as something you could get back in the day? Why did they unban it for this 'arena-season'?
---
Holy crap that was a beautiful play. 
---
I did not see that at all.
---
but... but he already did.
---
This is really cute
---
Gratz!
---
They're not downvoting facts, they're probably downloading incorrect interpretation.
---
That's one deck, with around 100,000 games recorded, and a dozen or so variations of the deck with one or two cards different each time because it hasn't been optimised yet.
---
If you filter for games played, which is probably a LOT more applicable for post about meta diversity, the top sixteen are Token Druid, four variants of Tempo Rogue, four variants of Mech Hunter, Spell Mage, two variants of Control Warrior, Midrange Hunter, Big Shaman, Zoo Warlock and Dragon Mage, which isn't exactly low diversity.
---
(Last 3 days or Current Season, All Regions, Legend-10)
---
Darkest Hour warlock absolutely loses to aggro, both in my personal experience (which, granted, is only 30 or so matches) and according to TS's latest snapshot. DH lock doesn't lose as hard to kingsbane rogue as BP, but it loses harder to aggro druid, odd pally and murloc shaman than BP does.  Both decks do well vs even shaman.
---
Besides, whats your point?  Both decks should probably be nerfed.
---
&gt;Even if scream is nerfed, people will play dragonfire potion like before kobolds and it will still be unfun losing to barnes+resurrect when it ocassionally high rolls.
---
Ugh, I don't want scream to be nerfed.  I want Barnes and/or the res mechanic to be changed, as I said before.  I also don't want to see more Priest clears having to be printed from now to eternity.
---
&gt;You just dismissed all the data that doesnt support your narrative. 
---
No, I'm pretty much dismissing all of HSreplay's data.  I'll say it again, HSreplay just doesn't have enough data to be a reliable with such few games recorded and with so many of those games being played sub-optimally by one side or the other.  
---
Pretty sure we've said all we have to say at this point.  Good day to you, sir

10 mana 3/3. Battlecry: destroy all legendary cards in both players decks and hands
---
Pandaria!
---
You’re probably thinking of Heigan the Unclean in Naxxramas.  Not destroy, but damage to the leftmost minion.
---
Heartharena
---
TF2 Hunter?
---
No cause you can play baron gedonn and end him.
---
On mobile sometimes it's just your connection fucking up so it could be a red herring
---
Time to play Control-Your-Feelings Warrior
---
They removed the odd and even quests plus the two different single player quests that gave classic cards and increased 50g quests alot
---
Who say im gay?
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk boutta go off
---
Or in this case, all 3.
---
We get at least one post every week how Zilliax is OP because *the statistics show he's on the majority of decks. And that single point of data means it's OP* I gave up on this sub when it comes to people making points like this. Every now and then we get a real gem from someone who sits down and actually does some research to back claims with data. But most of the times it's post like this.
---
There's Northshire Cleric. If you draw it, of course.
---
Yeah if they nerf rogue thats where we’re headed. And I almost think that would be so horrendeous they would have to scrap Specialist mid season. Unless they want it to suck so they can defund the esports
---
Don't be bummed about the CompHS reddit situation. The mods there fail to grasp what makes a community thrive - if you say the water is wet and the sky is dark brown when it rains shit, they will ask you to support it with data instead of opening up the discussion.
---
On the topic here, Specialist is a trainwreck, and the HS Grandmaster league is a miscarriage of the type of the Overwatch league. Blizzard has no idea how to make esports work, and it's a shame.
---
I experienced the same.
---
This should be fixed ASAP
---
Thought r/CompetitiveHS was a joke ...
---
Ironbeak shadow word d aldor peacekeeper walk the plank. And honestly. Just blame rng. Its just unlucky he drew those like 5 exact cards 30C5 (30 combinatiom of 5 ) is like a 1 in 3937484864 chance. Lol idk do the math urself. Its like me saying ok. I play mana addict turn 2. Turn 3 sorcs appeentice coin double mirror image four ray of frost mana cyclone. Double mirror agn four ray of frosts.  Turn 3 KO. Or turn 4 fireball
---
You can still have 3 mirrors in conquest.
---
Rogue's HP has made it a top pick in arena in almost every meta since release. Rogue has also been good to amazing in almost every meta since release in constructed.
---
It's by far the highest tempo hero power since you get 2 pings for the price of one.
---
Saying it's more situationally dependent isn't even true, you can almost always HP go face if nothing else. And saying you can't if you have a weapon equipped is like saying if your board is full you can't Paladin or Shaman HP, or Priest can't heal if nothing is damaged. Technically correct but it doesn't mean much at all.
---
Warlock HP is #1, Rogue is #2 no question.

Well done **OkayChamp 👍**
---
Madness is just too swingy. Not necessarily too strong.
---
Nobody got the packs yet. They get distributed 1-2 weeks after HCT.
---
u gae
---
Not showing the tophalf of the deck, to hide all the evil geniuses^^
---
Nah. Drawing with the wand gives you a great amount of resources, especially considering you're very likely to draw at least another Zilliax which gets you out of lethal. It's *not* worth it to not make that play because you're afraid of the less than 1% chance of this happening, especially since there's a chance just as big of that happening anyway on your next draw. It's an extremely small risk with a very big reward, op just happened to be in the one scenario where it backfired.
---
Apxvoid is trash xd
---
Why hate?
---
&gt; unless it had flavor text
---
What the hell? do I have to memorize all flavor texts now?
---
JK  I know what u mean :)
---
That did(n't) quite hit the mark.
---
Why then was the top points earner the champion?
---
that sounds really cool, you got a deck list?
---
Before the rotation, I streaked like 5 ranks with Standard rush warrior in wild. Go figure. Sometimes a deck is *just good*
---
It is. Bunch of mediocre players taking a childrens card game way too serious. A horribly balanced one at that. If hearthstone was meant to be competitive youd see actual card game pros going over to play competitively.
---
Me either.but dude,not any rumble pack for participating?
---
But is aggro really skills?
---
Thus happened to me and iirc it showed visually as taking the damage first and then getting healed, but since I didn't die maybe the game calculated it in that order under the hood?
---
(Side note: ended up winning that gsme. I take back everything negative I've said about her haha)
---
Well trade your pups before playing Geddon, he has at least one at 2 health.
---
You are very correct. My apologies.
---
Harth should be Hearthstone's version of [Shahrazad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=Shahrazad)
---
They could do it if each pack is priced at about 3-4x it’s usual value (for the same EV they’d make if you bought a normal pack instead).
---
Would you guys buy a pack that’s like 350g each, but contains only class specific cards?
---
Could have cleared the giant with wrath. Token decks aren't pure face decks, you gotta establish board control first.
---
I track every quest I complete and also attempt to maximize the number of 60 or above. 
---
Looking at the same number of days after last expansion vs this one I’ve actually completed one more 60 gold quest this expansion. I did complete more quests that award a pack over that time frame last expansion. 
---
Granted that is just one data point.
---
What the hell is even that

anyone who promoted this game, rpgs, or card games, or fighting games in the us is a hero in my book.
---
people only play fps here so...
---
Captain?
---
Warpath, batterhead and omega devastator saved me so many times
---
Nobody cares because the solo game is so poorly balanced that people cannot keep playing it.
---
Personally I would consider LoE midrange shaman, patron, huntertaker, beta miracle rogue and KoFT druid to have all been tier 0 in their day
---
That's the difficult part, right?  It's in the patch notes, I think there's a message when you log in, but what do you do about the people who don't understand?  I bet this happens in HS when cards rotate out or get nerfed and some players are gone for awhile
---
Draw a card is before take 2 damage in the text, so that part happens before the damage applies.
---
You know that a standard deck is valid on wild, right?
---
It is already the way you wanted to be. Plus the clear indication on screen that is wild( all the roots and stuff).
---
Big priest players don't have the brain capacity to screenshot
---
Every frigging time something RNG-related happens, people start insulting Blizzard or its employees. Classic.
---
Haven’t seen a 50g+ quest for 3 days now.
---
# DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY!
---
And the argument is flawed, because even if they were cheaper, it still wouldn't make sense to buy GvG or TGT packs in order to get the small number of cards involved.
---
Most of the time, when your enemy has emptied his hand to buff up edwin and is now topdecking, removing edwin is a huge tempo play and is very back-breaking.
---
The reason you're being downvoted is because you're objectively wrong.
---
Busy casting the shadow
---
Well maybe people run it cause there's no reason not to and they don't like auto losing Control matchups.
---
I honestly think the card should be completely reworked as a deck disruption tech or straight up not exist. In the way it currently works it's just too much value to pass on and effectively breaks the fatigue game.
---
You are welcome!
---
What Rank are you?
---
r/hearthstone = r/hearthstonecirclejerk but pretends it's not
---
Thanks, I’ve seen zilliax to be a really good card across various decks. Is it worth crafting, and how long has it got left in rotation?
---
Is scargil a must for that deck, or just a big bonus?
---
Exactly, so if I go to play standard I need 3 expansions, if I go to play wild I new like 10 or something. (Haven't played in ages)
---
I already struggle playing standard as it's too expensive, so I'll never play wild ever as all my cards from then had to be disenchanted to play standard. 
---
The argument is that blizzard have a whole wild section that is seriously untapped because standard drains everyones dust/money, I'd honestly prefer wild as I hate meta deck matches.
---
Just play mill rogue
---
Yeah but unfortunately I do not have those cards :/
---
Zilliax is probably the best neutral legendary in standard right now. It came out last year with the second expansion (Boomsday). However, while it's a great card, it's not a core card for many decks. Think of it as Rag: if you have space for it, then great, but you generally don't build decks around it.
---
Rastakhan
---
The effect is fine. I agree with the OP that making it 10 mana is the most appropriate nerf.
---
I understood that reference
---
Warrior sucks in wild and while bomb warrior is not an issue at all, it is [one of the most popular warrior decks](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=WARRIOR&amp;gameType=RANKED_WILD)
---
I’m an idiot, and I enjoy being treated as such. Speak for yourself.
---
Hes by no means a problem... likely because as I said the game has moved towards that style of game instead of away from it. THATS MY COMPLAINT.
---
&gt;HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ⛏⛏
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ⛏⛏
---
Alright well if you are trying to help me out, then cheers. I am trying to think outside the box, trying to think of unique decks. For this reason, i play a lot of decks which are initially bad, so i go down in rank, but after i refine them, and make them good, i make the video. I will take your criticisms on board, play more games with the decks, and rank up to a more respectable rank like 5 or better before i make the video.
---
On another note though, i do also need to spend time promoting myself / working on the youtube/video editing part of it. theres more to the video than just the deck and the games.
---
Anyway, peace
---
Lol this post could actually be a pretty funny copy pasta

Warnoq#2127 EU - trading 80g
---
The Find-a-Friend thread is still really active.
---
Mech hunter because you obviously want to reroll the low value 50g quests for a better chance of getting more gold ^(smirk)
---
Would be interesting to try and play a mode where you have to kill yourself as fast as possible.  I guess it would be a toss up between warlock self damage, rogue "Mill yourself to death" and priest self heal with cards that make that damage you.
---
You will continue to loose to all bullshit decks...
---
Would rely too much on rng
---
You can craft any card without buying the packs, even the ones that have rotated out of standard. If you do want to buy packs/expansions then you can do it from the blizzard store online. You cannot get old expacs/adventures by spending gold. 
---
If you want to play wild and are willing to spend money, [here's](http://wildhs.com/ultimate-budgeting-guide-for-wild/) a slightly outdated but still relevant guide on the best ones worth investing in.
---
Two queues:
---
Standard (Basic/Classic/Sets of the last two years) minus cards that were sent to the Hall of Fame, for example Sylvanas
---
Wild: Every card ever printed.
---
Both ranked queues are competitive, but the standard one is more popular and tournaments are mostly standard too. 
---
Obviously it is harder to get a lot of decks for Wild, because the cardpool is much larger. BEcause you can craft cards, it is not advisable to buy all expansions and adventures. You don't need every card ever for either gamemode.
---
Buy standard packs, get dust, craft whatever you want.
---
[I understood that reference](https://gph.is/1pRMMAH)
---
and its ten outa ten thirty outa thirty, nope just kidding its 0/1 ITS A FUCKIN FROG!!!!!!!!!
---
Ughhhhh
---
Standard is what you care about. Regardless of what a vocal minority might tell you about wild, wild is a shitfest with synergy and power levels so high that they strip the game of most of its fun and skill factor. It gets old within a couple of sessions. You can ignore its existence peacefully.
---
Hahha nice one!
---
Never heard of F2P &amp;&amp; P2C (pay to cosmetic) ?? /s
---
How?
---
By here, I think they mean where they live.
---
You need to have friends for that
---
When would this card ever be good if it's a copy lol? Seems like it only helps your opponent in most situations.

I won as mechathun priest having 2 minons by killing enenmy undertaker with spell it had destroy 2 minons xd.

Wild is where it’s at
---
You ever notice how people who act like smartasses on the internet never understand that something is sarcastic? Weird coincidences indeed, kinda crazy

Each set has its own pity timer

I've had a 11 winstreak at ranks 5-3 last night, maybe i've been lucky but i guarantee, it is a strong deck.
---
My winrate is around 68%(48-23) and i'm Rank 2 with control.
---
10/10 high quality shitpost
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Honestly, it’s awful. Down there bottom five cards from classic. 
---
But god
---
You get some funny moments.
---
Mechathun OP
---
Way too analytical for me. I just see I win 2 games for every one I lose right now, and that’s a good motivator for me.
---
That’s where the gourmet meals are. Dijon Mustard Jerry. Caviar. Filet Mignon. FUCKING HAMBURGER HELPER
---
Tell me about it. There are still plenty of Classic Epics I'm missing yet every time I hover over a new Epic when opening packs, I know in my heart that it's just going to be yet another copy of Far Sight.
---
I don't see how the moderator did anything wrong here. The rules are simple and well known. In case of dispute, players must provide screenshots. Without screenshots, there is no way for anyone to know who actually won. And just because a guy is known to have cheated in the past, doesn't make it right to always believe anyone who accuses him of cheating without evidence.
---
It sucks to run into such problems specially when you are just looking for some fun playing HS. This is the reason why in game tournament mode is so needed so that you don't have to worry about screenshots and stuff and just focus on enjoying the game.
---
I’d check out YouTube. There are some pretty decent budget decks that can help you. Most involve play Murlocs and go face
---
God help those poor noobs fighting net decks at rank 50 not pictured:
---
2X Eternium Rover
---
2x Slam and execute
---
2x Dead yetis
---
1x Concede
---
Makes sense, thanks for the info.
---
Not sure about the changes to arena... I drafted what I thought was a great deck and went on to my first 0 win run that I can remember (first time?). Haven't tried again lol
---
I’m not your buddy, guy.
---
You are the only one with hurt feelings though?
---
I wish that folks like VS and HSreplay would regularly include a polarization rating.  We've been hearing nonstop since the first report about how much of an issue it is, but without data it's hard to know for sure.
---
Sorry to hear about your case. Its baffling that the devs haven't made a tournament client or in-game tournament game mode to hose such types of events and kill a lot of cheating like this.
---
yep i see this point of view in it, but he didnt have proof either, so why am i penalized? They werent responsive, otherwise the obvious conclusion is we should play again, they hit me over a "slow" response time, there isnt even a rule for that. They ignored the fact he was ban avoiding too and let him play on and even gave him extra time (30minutes over 15 minutes) to turn up for his next game.
---
Again, i saw my fuckup i wanted to play again and couldnt even do that.
---
I guess not getting hit in the face with Wagglepick is even better :)
---
I know nobody plays it, but jave you seen how long the game pauses for Lorewalker Cho's animation? It's like 5 seconds for adding 1 card to a player's habd.
---
Because being an esport is far more reliant on entertainment value than any fairness or 'competitiveness'.
---
I don't want to make a total bummer post so here's a pic of the world first Magma Rager lethal, he survived 3 turns and the unique Cinderstorm https://imgur.com/a/vEZXmqU

Thunderbluff from March 2016
---
At 5 wins if you arent playing Warlock or priest, its over.
---
So a real gamer then?
---
NEVER
---
A lot of taunts and early game for tempo. Destroyed slower decks but got wrecked by the first board clear.
---
Draft priest, mage, or rogue. Control, control, and high tempo. I’ve gone up against all these fools, but if you draft the right stuff then you can make high wins too.
---
Blame activision execs. Devs just follow their orders. I'm sure plenty on team 5 would love to see tournament mode if management actually approved work on something other than "print new cards"
---
Toast
---
Yeah I don't have the Militia Commander cause they're useless but the rest is basically the same. But Nomi decks completely shit on it. And CC/Creation Mage. And Mech Hunter.
---
The list of counters to that deck is so long it's not even funny.
---
Ty
---
K I'll be chilling in legend waiting for you. If you have trouble with nomi save your bombs for when they empty their deck. It's really not that hard.
---
How did he have Goblin Bomb in his deck in first place?
---
I'm using precedent from other games I've played, like LoL, where items and buffs which increase max hp function that way.
---
Im pretty sure he actually put it in his deck
---
Yep, I agree. There is literally no skill involved in any of tier 1/2 decks right now (not even in CW), pure RNG and aggro.   
---
I gave this game another shot with this expansion and I am considering leaving it for good this time (I know that Blizzard does not care about one person but still).
---
I am not even mad about lost games, it happens but it bothers me the way I have lost them. In many games, there was not even a single trade just bum, bum, bum in my face.
---
Wait what? This is a standalone card? I always thought it's only a token created by Bomb Toss, Flark etc.
---
What am I looking at? Looks normal.
---
Can someone actually do the statistics of this?
---
Yeah, you can tell because it has a rarity tag
---
I also taking precedent from other games I've played. Imagine a rogue-like game and you find an amulet which increases your max hp by 8. Using your logic you could use this amulet to fully heal any time you like by equipping and unequipping it which is totally stupid.  
---
Generally speaking in games increasing max health either has no effect on current health or it will increase/decrease current health as it is added/taken away. It is never one without the other.
---
TIL
---
If you say so. Bet you are one of those people that just rushed to Legend with some braindead aggro deck and now claim they did it with Warrior. I'm actually willing to bet 100 bucks that you're one of those idiots playing Rogue 90% of time anyway.
---
The minion could not be targeted by spell or hero power, but a random effect is not targeting his minion.  He was sad.
---
Can't be targeted by spells or hero power. Yet gets clapped by a spell... great game ay
---
How do you lose to nomi priest? They literally draw their whole deck just kill them with the bombs.
---
Woosh
---
I mean yeah, it's lucky that they got it from Shimmerfly and that it hit your big boy, but that's nothing unusual in Hearthstone
---
Can't be targeted doesn't mean immune to spells
---
And it wasn't targeted by anything.
---
I wouldn't exactly call it obvious that when an "end of turn" phase is triggered within an "end of turn" phase, that trigger is saved until the next "end of turn" phase.
---
It would make the same amount of sense to discard that trigger, or to trigger it within the original phase. It all depends on how you program that interaction.
---
First off, your two sentence OP about the game moving towards shudderwock in no way shape or form represents your actual opinion, but that’s fine. You’re saying this game is dead, and that it isn’t the same as when it launched, well I can wholeheartedly assure you that if we were still out here playing curvestone and face hunter the game would of died years ago. A game needs to evolve to stay relevant and complaining about the direction it’s going in without proposing an alternative is pointless. I’m sorry hearthstone isn’t a magic ripoff anymore, that blizzard decided to have some fun with their game design, that card synergy has become more important than individually overpowered cards, and that the game is still growing despite everyone and their mother calling it dead (HS is the COD of CCGs, it’s never going to truly die). Is there still stuff to complain about? Absolutely, just look at all the posts on this very sub by people that actually know what they’re talking about. Is the RNG and card generation egregious? Yeah, but it doesn’t ruin the game and it still takes skill to pilot decks (even ones full of card generation) and win when the RNG isn’t on your side.
---
It's because they make sure the 8/8 opponents have a perfectly synergizing deck where you won't usually have that luxury. Once you finally have a deck that matches their powerlevel it mainly boils down to who drew the super OP non-collectibles that you get to pick between battles.
---
yikes.   Back in un'goro i had an interest for entering tournaments and testing my competitive mettle, but its just not worth. People are so shitty. 
---
I know its easy to clamor for tournament mode , its not that easy in practice.  Think about an entirely game run tournament mode, and the potential problems that it would cause, (not to mention the file size vs. the number of people who would actually play tournament mode).  
---
Using battlefy + screenshots is very imperfect, but it is what it is. It works if you're vigilant and takes screen shots.  Its contingent that you do that, can't rely on the opponent. 
---
Shitty that people don't have better sportsmanship, but it was always on you to do that , especially for a an online tournament.
---
Tog or Nomi will be around in standard a lot longer than flark.
---
U rite
---
Dear lord, salt the icy driveway that is your soul. Every class has had some kind of gimmick throughout every expansion. I’m guessing you lost and conveniently forgot about your own gimmick you put in your deck yet failed to pull off.
---
I used to be naive like you until recently where I made a rogue deck due to it being one of the classes I've yet to get my 500 wins from.  
---
Wow, FAR harder to pilot than I used to give it credit for.  
---
There is playing rogue and then there is playing rogue well.
---
The shrines are fine, you can see from when you're beaten by them (especially at round 6/7/8). The problem is the deck building, you have this specific game plan but can't get cards to support it. Some buckets are just garbage, leaving me stuck drafting "good stuff" that still doesn't have the power to finish out the matches.
---
Bye.
---
its mostly down to the organisation, i dont want this to turn you off it, most stuff done on battlefy is actually really good and mostly safe (the best we have i dare say). Anything outside of that like ESL however is a total free for all shit show, support let alot of these guys fly, as you can see.
---
What are you playing though? Seems teching against rogue would be a good plan.
---
Oh another rogue player who is afraid of this kind of posts...  Nerfs are coming ;)
---
idk, all you guys are acting like your opponents are regularly going all in on 14/14 edwins, which is pretty rare in my experience.
---
The more common case in my experience is that your opponent plays a 6/6 or 8/8 edwin on turn 3, not using any of their cards inefficiently to do it, often even going +1 on cards. 
---
In terms of tempo, you're using a 2 mana removal spell to get rid of their 3 mana minion, which is +1 mana in your favor. 
---
Often times, doing something like frost bolting (2 mana removal) a blink fox or fledgling (3 drop)  is your best play, but it's not insane tempo. You still don't have initiative just from that alone. 
---
It's not comparable to, say, sapping a rotten applebaum or similar, a case in which your opponent spent their whole turn playing one card and then you sap + 3 drop, which is +3 mana in your favor. 
---
On top of all this, Edwin is a safer play than ever due to things like prep raiding party and evil miscreant, both of which are cheap ways to activate edwin without emptying your hand (though this is a question of value rather than tempo, but I digress).
---
Lmao I'm fucking crying
---
Don't get me wrong - team 5 definitely has blame. Did they drop the ball? Absolutely. 
---
But what I'm getting at is the decision to outright quit and cancel it - I think Activision execs do have some level of say in that.
---
Like any big project - there's deadlines/schedules. And high level managers can absolutely say "ok you have x amount of time to put something together - show us the goods or we are done and re allocating the resources to another area"
---
Team 5 most likely needed more time to iterate and build a viable, good tournament mode. Considering how small their team is anyways, that would not surprise me. 
---
Activision execs can easily say "you know what, we need this, if you need more time, will give it to you, let's see this through, let's make it happen for the community" 
---
But lol, they ain't gonna say that. Because they still are greedy fucks who are nickle and diming everywhere possible. 
---
Did team 5 fuck up? Sure. I 100% agree they definitely could have and probably did. 
---
But executives make executive level decisions. They decide ultimately when to cut this shit and move on.
---
Are you talking on wild or standard? Standard control shaman should have a good matchup with the hex, silences, removals and other tools. Wild I don’t know much to say something.
---
I faced an 18/18 around the same turn yesterday ... was like "wtf".
---
Funnily enough playing as rogue but didn't have the SAP unfortunately as that would have been instant concede in my favor.    
---
Does Silence work on Edwin? I assume it does.
---
according to hsreplay , murloc shaman and big shaman is the worst matchup for hunter.
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/248/mech-hunter#tab=matchups
---
This is almost precisely the deck I built right before expansion using only the cards that would still be around. Ursatron gives it the draw it was missing.
---
Standard. I'm running Elemental Shaman, Dragon Shaman and classic control Shaman. You rarely get the needed cards in the mulligan, and once you do. They have spawned a huge board, or they play something even bigger the turn after.
---
I dont think this analogy is sound
---
0 mana Ultimate Infestation is PRETTY good though. 
---
That shrine is bonkers in the hands of the AI but not as good for the player. The opponent always starts on the coin so he always gets an extra card meaning he's that much more likely to have UI. The opponent also gets an extra mana crystal or two (as well as extra HP) depending on how far you are into the rumble run, so he doesn't have to last as long to do his "big nut" turn of drawing and playing his entire deck. I mean, I'm sure you can win with it but it feels like the shrine is way stronger for the opponent (compared to some shrines which are better for the player since the player can be smarter about using them).
---
And then at the end of my turn
---
Thank you very much, I will only play Murloc Shaman now.
