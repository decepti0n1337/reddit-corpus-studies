Yes he says it feels repetitive , but not because the r4-legend feels grindy. Rather because there is not teching involved, meta gets solved too quick and the current card design is bad. If there were better designed cards and more ways to tech against certain decks so deckbuilding becomes relevant again the game wouldn't feel so repetitive.

Thanks for fixing the issue of me wanting to log in!

Wow, that seems so absolutely greedy of Blizzard.  
---
Midrange hunter and zoo have a bone to pick with this comment, as well as myracle rogue, spiteful decks, secret paladin, wall priest, control priest, etc etc.
---
I do that but when I see a deck list that was awesome I want them to send me a copy.   So toxic environment is around when RNG come bringing his 1 Mana cards.
---
So they can do hotfixes for bugs.... I heard the technology wasn't there.
---
Why
---
Appreciate the feedback taco, not a bad idea for sure! 
---
This is also hinted at in Mean Streets of Gadgetzan cinematic trailer where you can see a large dragon sitting alongside Aya, Don Hancho and other notable citizens. 
---
Didn't know that! Makes a lot more sense now.

---
Though I gotta say that that mysterious leader looks very familiar.

There wasn't one front page, and it looked like everyone was just making their own topics... IDK.

is this actually good?
---
Blizzard fucked up quests by catering to drooling retards.
---
Originally, quests were supposed to be zero mana, but they found that a small percentage of morons would forget to play them when the quest was free.
---
So they raised the cost and completely rebalanced them. The end result being a card that was either completely broken OP or unplayable trash. 
---
Because at least idiots could play them. 
---
Big Priest is a "synergy" deck, but where you draw the line between "synergy" and "combo" is blurry between different people.
---
I would call Deathrattle Hunter a "combo" deck, but it's clearly midrange.  Most people use "combo" to refer to control decks with an OTK, but then at the same time you've got Control Priest, which is a soft-combo deck that uses Mind Blast + Mind Blast as its 'combo'.  Old-school Miracle Rogue with its 18-damage Shadowstep Leeroy turns also had a "combo" finisher, but people didn't really call it a combo deck.
---
Long story short, I think "combo" is a matter of degree and that Big Priest falls farther than the midway point on the combo side.
---
Totally not the bad guys lmao
---
No problem :)
---
Good luck with it!

It‚Äôs addictive dude

---
And a permanent slog for wild :/
---
This is a poorly formed thought so forgive me for sounding stupid, but I think the cards from Raven that have seen play have largely seen play due to their synergies with Mammoth cards, and ability to slot into pre-existing Mammoth archetypes. To pick out my personal favorite card from Rastakhan, Oondasta is a lot of fun (not as viable after Hunter nerfs), but he's so good mostly because he bellows "PUT ME IN YOUR KATHRENA DECK" from the mountaintops.
---
In a stronger year, the cards from the same block all play well together and create dominant archetypes independent of the last years cards (last year's cards slot in somewhere, but they don't necessarily drive every single archetype)  
---
I see your point about Wall Priest, but Wall Priest is mostly just Big Priest 2: Electric Boogaloo. It certainly feels different without Y'Shaarj and Barnes, but make no mistake that the chief enabling cards are all still the same: Shadow Visions, Eternal Servitude, Diamond Spellstone, Anduin, all Mammoth cards. And the only thing that makes the 2/14 good is that it's an Oakheart target! Another Mammoth card! I think if you print any fat vanilla card with 2 attack that deck emerges.
---
Bring back highlander decks
---
Gee I played so much i forgot what I played. I think there was some even and cube warlock in there as well. Soz
---
Yes, finally Blizzard is focusing on bugfixes!  What's next, fixing that bug where when Nozdormu leaves the game for some reason other than dying (evolve, etc.) the super annoying visual effect persists for the rest of the game?
---
Oh, they don't get money from fixing that one?  Damn.  Guess we'll see it for another few years.
---
(Wasn't Artifact going to save us from all the Hearthstone bugs?  How's that going........)
---
The only glaring ‚Äúbad card‚Äù I see is the felsoul taunt guy. Otherwise, these are decent picks 
---

---
I would say Hearthstone is relatively shallow as far as class identity goes, though.  And this makes it easy for players to make the mistake OP made.  It tends to be "mechanic = class", rather than a translation of any given mechanic into a *theme* that fits the class.
---
Mana ramp.  Handbuff.  Armor.  Totems.  Combo.  Weapons. 
---
 Secrets.  Board buffs.  Healing.  Certain classes get these mechanics, most classes don't get them in any way.
---
Why did they nerf Leeching Poison?  "Because Rogue isn't allowed to have persistent healing".  I mean, to me Leeching Poison seemed like a very Rogue card that wouldn't have fit into any other class.  It fit the theme of Rogue, but not the mechanics that Rogue is allowed to access, so it had to go.
---
We will see by Blizzcon at the end of the year if anything is changing or it‚Äôs just Iksar trying to get good PR.  
---
I feel like it‚Äôs too late anyway tbh, it‚Äôs a lot easier to retain players with qol changes and new game-modes than to get people back.  
---
They have been asleep at the wheel too long.

Gee that sucks. I had the same thing happen to me: R3 5 stars all the way down to R5 1 star. I didnt buy the whole "tilt-streak phenomena" where you should take a break but maybe there's something to it
---

Another potential variation I could see (which Blizzard would probably be more likely to do) is that instead of getting a new golden card the copy being used gets upgraded to golden. So, basically, people who dust during rotations will get more dust from upgrading their most commonly played cards to gold throughout a year while those who do wild get the chance to eventually upgrade their favorite deck to all golden (and I'm pretty sure I could climb to rank 5 each month in wild more or less indefinitely with my favorite deck in wild if I had an incentive and I would love to also get to revisit and maybe work on two or three other decks..... although some of my old decks can't compete anymore with wild power creep like tempo shaman..... but I would definitely come back and play a ton of wild if it meant getting to upgrade my Reno dragon priest and death rattle jade rogue and handbuff paladin to gold!
---
In the future we just shouldn‚Äôt spread these news, Blizzard will never know since none of their employers have ever touched a Blizzard gamr
---
Might be good to let people know what it is you stream, whether that‚Äôs Standard Legend ladder or rookie ranks in Wild, particular decks/classes you specialize in or if you meme, etc. and also give a sense of the vibe you‚Äôre going for (relaxed, lots of interaction with chat, serious laddering, explaining how to play the decks, etc.).  Good luck.
---
r/ArenaHS
---
And those would be put on the field from the deck with call to arms
---
So when priest plays the double your damage or healing from your hero power minion, it goes to 8 damage instead of 4? Surely that's a bug
---
Im pretty sure its cuz of the troll language
---
Getting toxic over a rng card game lol

That‚Äôs what I though too!

Thank you for the advice! I'm going for relaxed with interactions with the chat. I'm not really focusing on anything in particular, just playing ranked on some days, tavern brawl on others, and sometimes facing people in chat or my friends who play hearthstone!
---
And yet, they still didn't need it.
---
not exactly... I was winning most the games I'd play with mage. Some of the champions just suck ass. Ranked gets boring and redundant...  the brawls are fun cuz they're random. What fun is it to play against the same old decks all the time and know exactly how to counter or play?
---
The only good ones last brawl were paladin, priest or mage. Warlock seems extremely OP this brawl so far. 
---

Last time, someone on compHS did a giant simulation of winrates between everyone's lineups, and ended up picking bloodyface for the statistically best lineup.  That got me a cool 3 packs, I hope they do it again :D
---
I want a tournament mode where normal players(with some minor restrictions e.g lvl60) can start their own tournament ( with custom rules e.g. allowed sets) and set a standard entry fee e.g 100g or 150g. The entry fee is then pooled with 10% going to blizzard and 90% distributed as prize pool for top placings( depending on number of entry)
---
This guy gets it. The last thing we need is more sets, with hundreds of packs we must earn to have a decent sized collection of  those cards.
---
No, thank you. Make the game intersting from its core and you won't need to add so many new sets ever so often to keep the game interesting.
---
Among my circle of friends 4,000 to 5,000 is a common figure. 
---
Don‚Äôt feel too bad though, because that‚Äôs what you end up spending on packs anyway; your approach is basically just buying 40 packs over the course of a few months after the set drops, whereas if you save, you get them all at once. 
---
It‚Äôs a tough transition to make however, since if you start saving from a coupe weeks after launch, you won‚Äôt get many packs of the current set.  If you do a
---
preorder bundle it is a much easier proposition.
---
Good luck! 
---
Hearthstone has been on a steady decline for 2 years now. 
---
Yes, it was. Now we do get adventures too, but not as wings we have to buy.
---
Every new expansion is now a colelction of 100+ cards, and we need to buy pack after pack to fill it slowly...
---
Looking back at meta decks, and ticking off what cards were seeing play from each expansion.  Pretty simple "35 cards were used, 135 cards per expansion, X%" kind of deal.  Looking back through old meta reports like tempostorm and VS, things like that.  As well as relying on memory of meta decks, though that's a bit more shaky, so double checking occurred.  
---
Now, usage may be higher by a percent or two for some expansions, as I may be missing a card or two, but I've been careful to exclude meme-y decks.
---
More frequent nerfs actually decrease the cost of the game, for people with enough foresight to keep copies of powerful cards in order to get more dust out of them after nerfs. It's not uncommon to get thousands of dust after a nerf if you kept all your copies of the nerfed cards.
---
Top 500 is where I'd consider it starts to get serious and then top 100 is where it gets super cereal. 
---
He probably tried to have so much value that he could kill you the following turn. But because of the secret you probably had lethal with heropower and weapon
---
It doesn't
---
Personally I wouldn't mind them being banned, as I would love to have a more deck building focused meta, but realistically I know that won't happen. Net decking is just something we will have to live with sadly. 
---
probably just the tag warning
---
The problem was exacerbated by KFT and Kobols high power level but during those times it was fun.  Witchwood was "ok" because Genn/Baku were new as well but then things stopped changing.  These past two expansions have been demoralizing for me and it feels pointless to build/tech decks at this point to solve meta problems.
---
Eh, this bubble is gonna burst at some point. Companies collapse under their own weight all the time. 
---
XD
---
hah nice. I love that deck
---
Yes the wildly successful Heroes of the Storm, that's a game we really want to emulate in all aspects :) 
---
He gets my vote.
---
Is that a joke?
---
Worst? What about bran + mages loa that summons a ragnaros interaction? Game crashed, has been fixed. 
---
Yep, it's more a case of perception than anything grand changing about Blizzard. I'm noticing a lot of people throwing around the phrase "I feel" without really analyzing Why they feel that way - instead, the same anti-Blizzard sentiment is reiterated as if feelings and speculation are fact.
---
Wrong.  Path of Exile is a FANTASTIC game, absolutely insane value for the money (well, it's free and you can play the whole game without paying anything, but still, I put a lot of money into that game).  I've heard similar things about Warframe.  Recently I played Hollow Knight, jesus CHRIST that game is amazing, and it is **15$.**
---
**Hollow Knight, one of the best games I have ever played, was developed by 3 people and costs $15.**  I was actually angry when I played it and realized that I couldn't pay for the DLC, I'm going to buy the game for my brother just so I can pay Team Cherry again.  Thank god they're coming out with a new game soon, so I can pay for that too.  They deserve it.
---
That game really opened my eyes to how absolutely shitty AAA studios are.  You fucking kidding me?  $50 to get some of the cards to play Hearthstone for 4 months, and it's stale after 2 weeks?
---
The only AAA studio that still has it together is Nintendo, which actually puts out quality products.  Even if they have slumps, it's never felt like Nintendo was "going down a dark path" the way it is with Blizzard.  More just that they had a few misses, which hey, not every Nintendo game can be Mario Odyssey or Breath of the Wild.
---
Yes, I do think Blizzard games were better in the past.  But I also think that's because Blizzard was better in the past.  Now?  It's like OP says, I feel like they're just trying to squeeze me for money, not trying to provide an experience that makes me *want* to pay.
---
Site doesn;t work for me?
---
By not matter at all, I wasn't referring to who wins or not. I was referring to the fact that all the damage you caused is simply removed (and worse, by adding 10 max health). That's exactly the same problem people had/have with Reno decks, though in that deck it simply depends on being lucky to draw Reno early enough.
---
Yep! Full clear and draw 3 cards
---
I'm in the same boat. I specifically didn't log in at all from reset till brawl release so I had an extra shot at the 60g daily for 3 wins.. just to find out I've now missed a daily due to no fault of my own.
---
I know Hearthstone usually leaves you salty.. but this is ridiculous.
---
Experiencing some burnout is normal, otherwise we would still  be playing Pacman. But I wish they'd bring in some new game modes so the game could feel fresh again (\*cough\* tournament mode \*cough)
---
Anyway, the fact that it seems they are not even doing the Wildfest this year is making me really pessimistic about the future of hearthstone..
---
But it gets registered as a draw. For example in ranked, you won't lose stars for a draw
---
It has the Blizzard stamp on it, it was unveiled at Blizzcon, it's a Blizzard game.
---
META
---
Shame it can't face the rogue steal a card totem, then you could steal those cards and use them against the priest since the healing enemies damages them instead works both ways. 
---
You're not as completely wrong as the votes would suggest, but the number of returning players is indicative of *something*. If the difference maker is lineup prep then you're probably better off waiting for lineup. Anyways you're probably better waiting of for lineups, even if you're right, especially if you're right. If their level of play is practically indistinguishable between each other (which is your point, right?) then whoever has the better lineup has a better shot.
---
If you harass people, you'll get banned.
---
I must protect the wild, with recycled cardboard.
---
Lol, keep going then. Hard to say if you're lucky or decent without watching you play. I want to encourage you, but I feel like you're fishing here. Lmk if you feel the same once you hit rank 20

---
&gt;I'm not making the initial unverified claim, you were.  
---
Completely false bullshit. You said that it doesn't end your winstreak. That's an unverified claim. Verify it, hypocrite.  
---
&gt;Anyway, this is the edit that put that on the wiki [https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Gameplay&amp;diff=104260&amp;oldid=104114](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Gameplay&amp;diff=104260&amp;oldid=104114)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Yep, that's been wrong on the wiki for 4 years. Better think again before trusting it, man.
---
Oh because it's there 4 years it's wrong? What kind of bullshit argument is that. Oh, I gotta think before trusting something that's been on a wiki for 4 years and *hasn't been changed* in that time. Isn't how long it's been there actually something that favors the credibility, because if it were wrong then that's a larger period of time where it could be corrected? Maybe *you* should be the one to try thinking*?*  
---
&gt;It's fine if you want to keep thinking it was right, though, I really can't be arsed to go on a winstreak then find some way to a draw just to satisfy you, lmao
---
Oh, no. You don't have to do that. Just realize you're some rando making some statement so why should anybody believe you? And when asked, out of freakin curiosity, to back it up you then try to bullshit your way out of it instead of providing something, or admitting you don't have anything to back it up.   
---
I just wanted to know what is up with winstreaks, but you only seem to care about "winning" or some bullshit like that, you win. Have a nice day. Enjoy your arrogance.
---
It just feels like blizzard is putting all of their apples in the OW basket, but I don't even think OW is doing that hot either (considering how much attention it gets from blizz).
---
Have you even played rumble run? If they got their last shrine they would instawin against this week's paladinshrine. 20 is still not a good sample size for a 1v1 game. 2000 games is as well so unless you collect a bunch of data from other players you have no argument. I would believe they could have a winrate of 54%, which is high, but Okey for a tavern brawl. Mage has had more than 60% in other brawls I'm pretty sure. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about an extra slot. I think they should add a completely separat queue with unlimited length for evrnt quests. Then dailies would never be interrupted.
---
This is the case with most modern games. Games used to be made by small groups of a few dozen passionate nerds, who's goal was to make something they thought was fun. Now games are made by teams of hundreds of people, and the design doesn't come from passion, it instead comes from focus groups and marketing people.
---
This is why retro gaming is a thing. 
---
Dude, your initial unevidenced claim was that it did end winstreaks... Are you insane?
---
To add to that  
---
Overwatch -&gt; Upgraded TF2  
---
HotS - A spin on the Moba genre 
---
Like they do with Overwatch? The loot crate tracker for special events doesn‚Äôt supersede the regular weekly Arcade tracker.
---
&gt;Dude, your initial unevidenced claim was that it did end winstreaks... Are you insane?
---
If I did do that it's easily provable on your part, so link to it.
---
His point was the DotA was sort of created right under their noses and they blew it by only responding with HotS.
---
what are you laughing at :'( 
---
I'm crying
---
Whoever I was replying to did make that claim, I didn't check if that was you. Figured it was because of the amount of butthurt in your initial reply to me
---
I know. I just wanted to point it out.
---
i think his point was more the fact that DotA was created via Warcraft 3, a Blizzard game. they had arguably more data than anyone when it came to creating the "perfect" moba, and they botched it in favor of catering to the 'casual' gamer (which, to be honest, is what is hastening the downfall of WoW, the catering to people who think they should have the same stuff as people who play 40+ hours a week while they play ~5 hours a week). 
---
Why is are there arrows pointing toward Kobolds and Catacombs logos?
---
Nice!
---
The guy beofre you was merely stating a different opinion. Don't take everything as a personal attack.
---
I feel like Overwatch is still doing good 
---
Don't you mean !Activision! Blizzard
---
&gt; (they tried to shut down Melee tournaments???)
---
[Yes, they wanted to block Melee streams at Evo.](https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/10/nintendo-blocks-smash-bros-melee-streaming-at-evo)
---
Is it really though? Their products arent perfect but they're still high quality. The whole thread reeks of nostalgia where people remember the "good old days", when in reality the difference is that those good old days were when gaming was young and we were all kids and far shittier lower effort products were far more tolerable and appealing to us. 
---
I'd also point out that 10-15 years ago Blizzard had a reputation of having hardcore blind fans that would love and defend anything the company does. The company was acknowledged to make polished popular games, but it was hardly as universally loved as you make it out to be. They always priced their products in the most premium ways, hardly ever had sales compared to anyone else and starcraft for all its praise killed the entire rts genre by shifting focus to competitive bs even before mobas showed up. 
---
Blizzard does deserve plenty of criticism, but the whole "they used to be great, they're much different now" is just rewriting history. 
---
Sure they do. No choice left after Blizzcon.
---
However I might not be interested in tjat game given their latest games and behavior. :P
---
seriously. every available metric has D3:ROS well above the playercounts of PoE. just because PoE has a better dev team doesn't mean more people play it. 
---
&gt; First Jaina's boobs, now our 4th quest.
---
A different opinion to what? I never stated a different opinion to what they stated. 
---
I member
---
shame too because they had by far the best devs. Yes, better than Kaplan.
---
&gt; Please note that if you have three quests at the time of the Tavern Brawl, the Season of Rastakhan quest will replace the one with the lowest reward.
---
This is not true. I had an 80 gold Challenge a Friend quest that got deleted and got left with a 60 gold Win 3 with Warlock/Priest.
---
Because they lack any good board clears in their basic/classic set so they have to keep getting new ones to avoid being dumpster tier.
---
&gt; Witchwood was "ok" because Genn/Baku were new as well but then things stopped changing
---
i would argue that once the novelty of odd/even decks wore off, people stopped playing (during witchwood at least) because the meta stagnated into odd paladin and like 2 other decks. and speaking from experience, odd paladin isn't fun to play or play against. 
---
What, are you suggesting synchronised burnout amongst Hearthstone streamers?
---
The future of money in gaming absolutely is in mobile and especially in mobile + gatcha or micropayments. In terms of investment to payout it is an absolute no-brainer right now.
---
Now, that may change as the mobile market becomes even more oversaturated but Blizz-Act is banking on the idea that a known IP might be able to get a slice of that stunningly massive piece of pie. I think they fundamentally misunderstand that market but what the hell? I can't blame them for trying.
---
I would like to see a new Arena format more like MTG draft. Higher entry fee but you're allowed to keep the cards you draft.
---
Yeah, I have only one ‚Äúdouble ‚Äú, and should deal 4 
---
I didn't say the wiki is right, nor that I definitely trust the wiki, nor that I don't trust you, I said I trust it more than you.  
---
 The edit was made by one rando but the wiki is a group of randos. If they were wrong somebody could have corrected it by now. So the worst case for the wikis is it's one rando stating something + 4 years of it not being corrected. You're just 1 rando stating something. The difference may be big,  small or minuscule, but the wiki definitely gets my vote.  
---
BTW out of the unsupported claims on the wiki and on r/hearthstone comments which do *you* think has a greater percentage of correct statements?  
---
You want to know what is closer to seeming like the product of a laughable mind? Somebody, not us, previously made a statement that differs from yours and you think you don't have to supply evidence to support your claim but should provide evidence to support a claim I didn't even make!
---
Could you make a quiz with multiple choice answers instead next time? I spelled Moroes as Monroes and lost hope for the rest of the quiz.
---
Reno/Highlander was pretty much the mechanic for the Kabal's legendaries, anyway (it was supposed to be something about red mana crystals, but that was scrapped late in development).
---
Having switched to Magic Arena when it came out it was an interesting experience for me suddenly seeing QoL improvements coming every 1-2 months instead of every 2-3 years.
---
I didn't even know you could do that!
---
Has China overtaken Japan on the mobile total-spend metric? Japan is obviously far less populous but they were absolutely dominating in terms of per pop and total expenditures as recently as three years back.
---
What depth is there to HotS?  I'm genuinely curious what part of the game you can describe as having any semblance of depth compared to the the titans in the MOBA genre.  For the record, I probably have well over 1000 hours into HotS.
---
Last-hitting and gold are not interesting mechanics. Heroes is about team-fighting and macro. It removes the pointless busy work to focus on substance (which is weird for modern Blizzard!).
---
^ now THIS is epic üòé
---
Yeah I guess the light gets both pally and priest so that'd be fine
---
Gold I kinda like, but last hitting can burn in hell, yeah. What a dumb uninteresting mechanic that promotes passive play to boot. "Yeah I'm just gonna stand here while the minions fight and try to click on them just before they die. Such fun!" 
---
The fact that it is such a huge problem only highlights the problem with the hunter class, there are no good alternatives. Hunter has no healing, good aoe or draw other than master\`s call. Also, it is not just 6 mana to play. It is 2 extra to draw a beast, which makes it slow.
---
The argument that it completely changes the class, can also be said for controlpriests which rely on their hero and 2+ mind blasts to finish of the opponent, Dr. Boom in Warrior which has no other win condition than fatigue, control mage with Jaina etc..
---
Squirming Tentacle has left the chat
---
They cancelled the official esports support and moved some devs off the game. It sucks, especially because the news that most people heard was "Heroes is dead," which isn't true at all.
---
People like buying stuff because of advertising. Beats by Dre, some Apple garbage or in gaming, No Man's Sky, Fallout 76 or Diablo 3. Reviews went out about how bad they were but they'd never looked on the game itself before buying. How hard it is to wait for a month to see reviews from players and not some vgjournos who get payed to leave a good review?
---
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH IT
---
For me I think it is just burnout. Looking back at previous years I think the current meta is good and that they generally have been getting better at keeping variety in the meta as time has gone on. For me at least, I don't really buy the polarization or lack of control reasons, I don't think these are really any worse than when I played a lot.
---
But how long are we really expected to play the same game? The longest I've stuck with a game has probably been 6-7 years. I didn't think it got worse at the end, I still think it's a great game. There was a big mod community so there was always new content to consume. But at the end of the day, the basic gameplay doesn't change and so it gets less interesting. I found something different to play. 
---
If that's the case it would take something fairly drastic to drag me back in. I can see some things potentially keeping me engaged for another few years but I think at the end of the day games have a natural lifecycle for most consumers and it's not necessarily they stopped playing because the game got worse.
---
Are you trying to start and argument or something? Why continue to ignore what I say?  
---
That guy said it's fine to discuss other games as a reply to a comment that **does not** say anything on that matter. I never had a differing opinion to that, never stated a differing opinion to them. I actually agreed with it being okay to discuss other games, in the comment *you* initially replied to. I just also questioned them replying to me because they're comment did not have anything to do with my initial comment.
---
I remember seeing he Warlock vs. Paladin interaction.  
---
I was just like... ugh... quest to win with Warlock, well at least I can play Brawl untill I win, no hassle of lacking good warlock cards etc. Turn 1 play flame imp. "Ha, take  that 3 dmg... wait...wha-hahahaha oh no I'm so sorry mister Paladin sir, ahahahah."  
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
Find the one with the most awkward puberty face and reap your rewards. 
---
are we though?
---
the automaton doubles both your healing and damage effects.
---
Your hero power heals 2, so now it heals 4.
---
When you use it to damage instead (with shrine) , since it is still a "healing" effect, it becomes deal 4 damage. Automaton doubles it again. Automaton interacts this way because the hero power is still a healing effect, and when used into the enemy its also a damage effect, benefiting from both parts of the effect of the automaton.
---
Its  a weird interaction that we normally dont see since most of this effects are actually "your healing spells deal damage this turn" (shrine is "your healing effects deal damage to the enemy cards") and therefore dont stack this way (they are only considered healing, or damage, therefore only getting one doubling effect), but something similar its seen with cards like velen + spirit lash, where spirit lash deals 2 damage to all, and from that damage, you heal the double again. Basically healing 4 times more that you would heal without having velen on board, not 2 times more.
---
Its consistent with the rules and the wording of the cards. Its just a bit unintuitive since the doubling comes from the same card, both times. Its easier to imagine it if you had one card that doubles your healing, then another that doubles your damage.
---
Sorry for the bad wording, its a weird interaction to explain, but dont worry, its not a bug or anything.
---
Yes, sorry.
---
All good.
---
If I may help here.
---
I was around the heartpwn forum when this topic came up about drawing.  
---
In our case though, it happened in arena so it was easy to see the result. 
---
The screen said Loss just like it did here. But they didn't lose their arena run or gain any loss markings. All if the stats remained as is and they were free to keep playing.  
---
Others confirmed that draws didn't take away their win streak in ranked. Not one person refuted any of it.  The OP was arguing at first thought, but they were only going by the screen at the end of the match, not on any of the stats once the game ended.
---
This why we say that a draw is treated as a draw even if it tells you it's a loss. Because many have had it happen to them and seen the results.
---
This is what happens when the upvotes decide and there are no submission rules. It happens to every sub that's not moderated strictly.
---
think you're fine buddy, warlock is imo the easiest one to clear with after druid (some people might argue the other jade/cthun classes are on par or superior, but i personally found warlock to be a breeze in both of my runs). no reason to feel that combination cheapened your achievement!
---
congrats to the OP, clutch dreadsteed win :)
---
Article might not be that good, but it's still right about numbers. Last year mobile games generated 51% of sales in gaming as a whole, and it's expected to keep rising so i kinda see why Blizzard would keep investing more into the mobile gaming industry. It's not that i agree thoroughly as my phone sucks and i love gaming with my PC and consoles, but yeah, it's easy to see why they are getting more and more into mobile.
---
What is undertaker Hunter I have spell hunter
---
I enjoyed this Brawl
---
no kurwa
---
Dota isn't the biggest MOBA either
---
The boomsday class cards were pretty good but the neutral cards are severely lacking, aside from gigtling, subject 9 and zilliax, I can't think of any other neutral card that saw relevant amounts of play 
---
I don't see them consciously buffing anything but if they had to I bet it would just be undoing a nerf to a standard card after it goes to wild, like Saronite Chain Gang creating a copy of itself again (is that really any different than Dopplegangster?)
---
If they hypothetically ever did buff a classic card just to buff it,  it would probably be one that has more importance in WOW lore. I don't know much about that but from what I've heard Illidan Stormrage is significant,  so maybe make him cheaper or give his 2/1s Rush or something.
---
Best != Biggest
---
The problem is that Activision-Blizzard sees things like RoS as failed games when they were objectively smash hits. They are never satisfied and just kill their own games as a result
---
I know this is a joke but in reality this is the opposite of thoughtful, right?
---
Thijs and Zalae feel like the only two left who care, and are committed. I still watch both regularly.
---
And I feel like people hate jaina as much as rexxar

Not counting quotes you've used exactly 1049 words in this thread replying to me. Can't believe how accurate my guess was. Another win for me /s Can't shake the fact that you only keep engaging me in the hope that I'll finally oblige you to try to prove my claim. Can't wait for you to track down that guy who edited the wiki four years ago so you can waste his day too. Let me know how that turns out, ok?
---
Viper at it again with Murloc Paladin. Mrgrgglll
---
The worst thing about this, for me personally as a former die hard blizz fan, is that it's not only that one game that gets driven into ruin but it's the entire company and with that, every game they will ever produce.... I guess it's just a part of getting older, watching things that mattered so much become irrelevant.
---
I like to imagine looking at blizz like at a grandma. As a kid, you play with your grandma and it's fun and awesome and stuff.
---
As a teen, you know she'll die at some point.
---
As an adult you either watch her die or you turn away from the sad fact and leave her beforehand.
---
By still playing at this point in time, I'm watching grandma blizzard die. It's sad but inevitable.
---
Why is not buying vision a strength? Having vision control let's you exploit knowledge imbalances which makes a richer playing experience.

hmmmm
---
J Alexander as in miss j runway coach diva extraordinaire?  
---
The thing is, in theory, having fewer quest slots incentivizes people to play more regularly, to keep them clear for situations like this. But there's playing the game more because it's been made more enjoyable, and playing the game more because you're given more work to do. The latter will definitely not maintain a healthy fanbase in the long run, I really hope they realize this and try to turn the game around for the better. I'm very interested to see what they do in the next few months.
---
It's so obvious that Activision ruined Blizzard. Just look at all the decisions that were made AFTER the acquisition. WoW went full casual, 3 games for SC2, real money AH.. and as a result all the top people left the company. 
---
I get this but at the same time find dota2 turbo mode fits the bill much better and is infinitely more fun that HotS ever was. I wanted to like HotS, but I could just never get past certain aspects.
---
The main issue is that us hardcore blind fans are now starting to see that the company is turning to shit. To me, that means that there has been a significant change, because Blizzard is the game developer that I've spent the most time and money with in my 26 years on this planet. These days I just play a bit of HotS with my friends, I just quit Hearthstone, I never really got into OW, never played Diablo 3 (probably should have, but didn't have time/money), and I haven't played WoW properly since WoD.
---
Deathrattle hunter maybe?
---
HoTS 2.0 improved the game, imo. I really don't want the game to die.
---
Its gonna be in limbo and eventually die. SC can live without adding alot of new things due to the fan base and gameplay which mostly just require the same stuff while games like Hots needs updates to stay floating
---
Right lol. The fact that they're just ASKING this now, when all of this had been out there is a bad sign. Half of this stuff should have already been addressed.
---
1. Rexxar is 1 card wall priest is an entire deck 
---
2. Core cards in wall priest are rotating with rexxar so your logic doesn't really sit here.
---
This is 100% true. I am looking forward to April, as is the whole community I imagine. The Raven sets were so powerful it's no wonder we're still playing the same decks.
---
I'm an on and off WoW player, but after WoD and Legion... ESPECIALLY Legion... I just can't anymore. I love mythic+ running and raiding, but I just can't keep logging in and doing *chores* every day just to keep up. I can't keep running the same content over and over for a minuscule chance at a good roll on a good item. It's like a second job and I just can't do it.
---
It just had e very rocky development - it went through several name changes, not to mention it came out when the Moba bandwagon had already left the station. All in all - probably my favorite moba, but came out just a bit too late.
---
90% of my collection is useless.thats why hs costs so much.Just because those 10% powerful cards.How can there be any new decks with 10% powerful cards and 90% weak cards.
---
Even only one card is overpowered will ruin the game.It will ruin everyone who doesnt play this.I like those creative ideas.But please make it balance.Cause there is no any fun in an unbalanced game 
---
Thank man :D
---
It‚Äôs fine. Just ignore it
---
????
---
It is a big event because for the last 5 years they have ignored any feedback. It is a big event because for the last 5 years they have not done it. And for some strange reason, when the Team 5 sees everyone leaving the game they suddenly ask that question... Nope it all seems fine here, nothing different going on here. Just a normal post asking people why they are leaving the game.
---
The only feedback I think they have ever taken is was more deck slots which was the biggest joke in not having it and they still didn't do it well. People were just desperate enough to accept what they did put in.
---
Every thread talking about this tweet mentions this as well. It is a good idea to not just read the headlines and actually read what people are saying in those posts.
---
And again, THE LEAD DESIGNER wants to know how to get people to play the game again. Why do you think this is okay, why is this not a warning sign or a confirmation for you. They spend 5 years ignoring almost any input. We have every personality playing other games instead of this game.
---
And once again, you don't actually provide anything that makes me seem wrong, you just ask how that makes me right. What makes you right? What information do you have that makes you dismiss this. Please why are you so confident that you are right and the majority of this sub (the people who are most interested in this games well being) is wrong?
---
I have provided tons of content proving me right. You have provided nothing, you just say I am wrong.
---
True and ironic
---
If you want to suffer for a hundred games or so, then fall in love, Dota 2 is definitely worth checking out. 
---
I love HotS and used to play it a ton, but now my friends only play Dota and I've come to really enjoy it. It feels really strategic and dangerous. 
---
As a game though PoE has what the original post talks about. Its got atmosphere, soul, its been crafted with love... d3 did not and d4 wont either the way Blizzard is going. PoE had been created to be great, relying on that to produce profit. Not the other way around like every modern blizzard game. They've got to distance themselves from corporate, stop whoring their IP. When this is even showing hearth stone you know they've got problems.
---
I still check out the sub, but have left the game a while ago. Un'goro was my last expansion and it seems like the problems are all still the same.
---
One big thing that did it for me was how averse blizzard was to rewards. Love the golden heroes for instance, wish there were more stuff like that. I bet there is a lot of other players who are mostly FTP but don't put enough hours to reach legend and would love some rewards. After playing since beta and having all the relevant cards, it became a choir. Play for the gold, so you can get the next expansion for free, and play it for the gold...
---
And the cost for returning to the game now is just borderline insulting (not that I see any motivation for doing so anyway).
---
You typically don't make a good game better by removing features, you make it better by replacing bad features with good ones.
---
Honestly I was always expecting a mobile release, I was really surprised it never materialized. The simplified gameplay would have worked much better on mobile. 
---
&gt;The games used to keep me playing hours on end, because they are good; now, I feel like they are just built to keep me playing for hours on end.
---
Beautifully written
---
&gt; I have shown 0 reasons why I'd do that
---
And that's your problem. You have no issue with that rando wiki editor making an unsubstantiated claim 4 years ago, but you do with me now. I tried pointing out how dumb your double standard here was about 4 times now, but to no avail. Let's hope you'll never rely on information of questionable origin in an actual critical situation
---
Are you sure its not the games that are killing your will to play them
---
I think you're very right, and I think most of the streamers seeing some others jump ship and still having a healthy viewer base was a big factor
---
Man, I know I am going to get downvoted for this, but this comment is so edgy it's untrue!  What do you mean "Every time there's a new expansion to sell"?  There isn't a new expansion to sell!  There isn't even a new expansion announced!  It's true that there will be another expansion 'soon' if you qualify 2 month's time as soon.  And if you do that means for 6 months of the year there is a new expansion 'soon'.  So basically for half the year anything Blizzard does that is 'nice' can be framed as "they're just doing it to sell the new expansion".
---
And even then, maybe if Blizzard only did this kind of thing in those 6 months and not the other 6 months then just maybe you would have something of a point.  Except they don't!  Just a month ago they sent out a survey asking people their opinion on various things regarding the game.  Don't you remember?  We had a major freakout because one out of the fifty or so questions asked if we would quit the game if eSports were cancelled, there were multiple threads on it.
---
If we're going to frame any kind of community outreach as something negative, is there any surprise that they don't outreach more?
---
Greetings.

You win this time.

If you use the same item build every game in LoL or DoTA, you are a terrible baddie. 
---
baku and janalai are still there, thats convincing enough for people to build around and there's already non-secret versions
---
.. and that's just sad. Before I just hoped that they don't have resources to help us not lose gold, but it turns out that if we there's a threat that a player will not lose a chance for additional 50-60 gold they will find resources immediately. That's just sad.. 
---
Not the opposite, no. It‚Äôs not really thoughtful since the opponent probably didn‚Äôt mean to give away an extra voidlord for free, but the opposite of thoughtful is rude or inconsiderate and this definitely isn‚Äôt anything like that.
---
I think the real beginning of the decline was shortly after the release of SC2 WOL. Heart of the Swarm was the end for me
---
Does anyone else think the meta is fine rn? Its diversive and doesn‚Äôt feel too polarized.
---
It was a game manufacturered to be an Esports first before being an actual game itself and then an Esport coming as popularity rises. 
---
I remember looking forward to tournaments, like seat story and Blizzcon. But now, I can't even watch competitive HS it's so fucking boring now. And whenever I check Twitch, I have to scroll down 3 or 4 streamers before I find one that isn't Russian, or CHinese. Ill wait and see what happens in the spring with the rotation but the double whammy of HS not being as fun, and the Battle Royale genre basically being invented and taking over both hurt HS.
---
Sustainable and passionate player base isn‚Äôt what blizzard is looking for (in case you don‚Äôt get it...)
---
Implying there's not optimal item builds for 90% of the games

In part.
---
Are we talking about the same companies here? There have been 2  battlefronts released. What games have hurt their profits?
---
Yup
---
Bfa pls
---
Well, maybe. I think there is an arguement for it though. To me thoughtful means someone put thought into it, this is usually associated with something nice someone does for someone else. The opposite of this would be thoughtless, so someone does something without thinking and this is usually associated with, like you say, being rude and inconsiderate. However, I think being thoughtless could apply in this setting here where they just didn't think about the consequences of their action. Perhaps careless sounds like a better word for what I'm describing but I do think thoughtless can be used in this way.

I mean i know these are just cosmetics, but just take a look at the most recent event skins. A lot of the models and textures just look unfinished. Much lower quality than the ones from early in the game's life.

Valve has all of tho- oh you want them to be polished? Nvm then...
---
This isn't just Blizzard. It's the whole gaming industry.

Think the term would be that all of these are enchantments, the positive ones are called buffs while the negative ones are debuffs
---
This is the way corporate sees it too and this is blizzards problem. Give me a list of the 10 greatest mobile games ever. It's all soulless fodder designed to milk the playerbase. The control systems have always been bad and this is yet to fixed.
---
 We can indeed blame them for sleeping at the wheel, killing all their ip through stagnation  while they dream about mobile gaming market profit margins.
---
But paying 2 cards makes it worse than mind control in most cases, even considering that you also get a 2/1 out of it, as you won't be able to attack with the MCd minion for an extra turn this way. 
---
Judging by last years schedule, something should be announced this or next week .
---
Yeah, no. I played about 15 matches with the hunter deck before I finally won one. You have to get lucky with two things. 1. Draw some low cost cards, because your deck is incredibly top heavy and 2. Face a non aggressive deck that drew poorly. 
---
Can't change servers on mobile
---
It's the same every rotation. Some will quit. But if we don't have rotations, it means people in standard will play the same cards forever and ever. Then you'll see a lot more will quit.
---
Valve is close. Their stuff has been out long enough so that they have a decent amount of polish compared to the old days (obv not on Blizzard's level)
---
Artifact is the most polished game valve has ever put out (production value is near perfect). Only sticking point is the gameplay since it's the niche-ist game I've ever seen.
---
Artifact isn't a bad game, it just appeals to a very specific audience, that's why some people think it's the best game they've ever played and on the other hand it doesn't break 1k concurrent on most days.
---
Idk how to even describe it: it's like playing all the matches in a bo3 at once with a built in sideboard and like a million decisions you have to make. The design and depth is the most amazing thing I've ever seen, but most people don't want that kind of depth.
---
The monetization is an issue, but since the game tanked you can literally buy an entire collection for around 60$ last I heard
---
League of explorers was amazing tbh 
---
Mechathun Druid is very annoying. I got one down to 1hp and he gained 35 armor on his next turn. Should not be a surprise that I quit after that
---
Same here , I hate Priest since 2k14. 
---
 But that‚Äôs what happens when they give a class several ways to OTK you, also additionally the best Aoe in the game..
---
Oops ;)
---
thanks!
---
Of course he should've.
---
Everyone saw it pretty quickly after he was released.
---
Everyone but Fail 5.
---
Even that aside, they chose the worst nerf possible, just summoning him instead of changing Charge to Rush, like you've said.
---
Rarely do they make perfectly reasonable nerfs, but very often when there's a pretty obvious one (read: the majority of the community, pros and whoever else agrees with it), they do a complete 180 of that, killing the card instead.
---
I feel like Iksar's latest twitter post, asking what would make us come back to the game, is so fucking pitiful he should've gotten zero answers, just to let that sink in and actually FEEL what disastrous state they've pushed the game into. For one time, everyone could ignore their assess, give no feedback (it's already been given to death before) and just cry in their corners, helpless and hopeless. That is what they deserve, but of course not what's happened.
---
People still believe in them, still answered his tweet and gave ideas (majority of which repeated before, of course), and they'll do JACK SHIT about it once again. How many times have they fooled us? This won't be the last one either, aw hell no.
---
Literally the only substantial edit I made in any of my comments here was one for your benefit. I corrected out the wrong initial claim about you originating the thread instead of the other guy. It was a simpler time, back when I still naively thought I was conversing with a sane person. Other than that I only corrected some typos because I posted most of them from mobile and made one tiny clarifying edit in that comment you went ballistic over. I don't think any of them were even stealth edits, except that last one. You're even more delusional than I thought if you're suggesting I substantially altered the meaning of most of my comments. Yikes
---
By increasing the mana cost or limiting the beast pool.
---
Same i hate priest in general too
---
Tbf that was really fun in singleplayer. I didnt even think about it when suddenly the opponent was just dead. Shocked. It was great 
---
Increasing rexxars mana cost may help I guess. But limiting the beast pool to what? 
---
Its Activision's fault.
---
activision has been the scummiest publisher in the industry for at least a decade.  IDK why EA gets all the hate.
---
Yeah, because players have been asking to focus resources on fixing the stupid game rather than puking out skins or content. Jeff said it him self.
---
Surprised no one mentioned the fact that TenCent is slowly taking over Blizzard ( i think they have something like 20%, but i could be wrong)
---
RD2, Witcher, Breath of the wild and many other proof you wrong.

&gt;Mandatory Steve Jobs Interview 
---
I dont think wow really started it. Yes, it was a major success, but their first 2 expansion were incredible (burning and lichking). They improved the game a lot and really did their homework. What happen is the fanbase started to move on from wow after that. It was still the most popular MMO, but when the sub started to dropped, even slightly, the shareholder start to scream. Also, the Activision merger happen in 2008. The creative and passionnante team that was Blizzard got burried under pressure to perform and get those sub back. Meanwhile, a small team developped hearthstone. No one paid attention to them, so they released an amazing game. When Activision corporate understood what a success it was, it start sinking that ship too, try to monetize it more. They will eventually killed all the Blizzard Franchise until. I watched a video from Jim Sterling recently and he summerized the problem with the AAA game industry (or every major corporation). I higly recommend it : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmW0GhdDOvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmW0GhdDOvw) . 
---
The thing is, the way you remember things as a kid and reality are probably very different. They didn‚Äôt change, you did. 
---
For Standard. Next exp info should come a little after. 
---
&gt; We're doing better on more frequent balance patches
---
People need to stop saying this. We had the regularly scheduled nerf and then we had ONE additional nerf after that. This does not indicate a new trend of frequent balance patches unless they continue it throughout 2019. As it stands its more likely that they wanted to gut some of the meta decks so people spend the last two months of Rakastan blowing their dust reserves.
---
Anyone who was deeply invested in hots and didnt have a back up plan after hgccheer failed they probably deserve what ever state they are in
---
Logout and change the server.
---
The last straw for me is when they release Warcraft 3: Remastered, and they do not allow own custom contents like the previous game, I will be done with playing blizzard games.
---
That's exactly what I did. I never really enjoyed deckbuilding, but part of that was because it took so much work to find something that could work ok at lower ranks, never mind higher ranks. And if you had a good idea that required a legendary, you crafted said legendary, and it turned out to be crap, well you're out of luck and out of dust. Instead, what I think a lot of people ended up doing (including me), was wait until the meta settled a bit and then craft what was necessary for the best netdecks. Just sucks the fun right out of you.
---
Thanks. Great thread you made.
---
Thanksss that helpedd!!!
---
You‚Äôre welcome. 
---
Well you never know. Or it could have to do with another blizzard game.
---
Oh, twisting my words are you? Did I say you made substantial edits? No, never. I said edits. There was one where you totally changed the meaning, but in most of your comments you've added parts of sentences or full sentences. Hence my edits where I reply to something additional. 
---
I do also consider what you recently did, by adding the part about my first sentence to be a substantial edit for that comment.
---
  
---
Now you're trying to rewrite history or something. Why didn't you say a thing when I mentioned you editing almost every comment earlier? Maybe because you hadn't yet decided to try and gaslight me. 
---
And I'm the one who is shown in bad light here? Dude. You're gaslighting. Freaking GASLIGHTING. That's horrendous shit. 
---
You give a minion 'At the start of your next turn, gain control of it'. 
---
That is the (de)buff that the minion then has, when a minion is copied, it's copied along with all its buffs/debuffs and effects, therefore when the next turn starts you gain control of all the minions with that associated text.
---
I see absolutely no reason that the opposing player should get to keep one of them. That's what would be inconsistent in my opinion.
---
You probably should not participate in the tournament if you don't know what to choose.
---
Why don't you people just complete your quests instead of constantly leaving your quest log full? Especially when they announced there would be an event quest on Wednesday?
---
Well you actualy know quite a bit. Because it will be pretty much like all the others. 
---
Sure you were. 
---
If odd and even are too powerful (which they probably aren't looking at their played rate) then introducing contradicting but powerful deck restrictions would be a good way to counter their (moderate) popularity. 
---
Just keep making cards like Reno or the prince cards. 
---
Okay, so a lot of people missed the point that this was turn 1, before the other player got to do anything. 
---
They're totally cool making money man.  This is why critical thought is a necessary chore in this world.
---
You're an idiot if you think people want more inspire cards over awesome cards like Baku/Genn. Or more inspire cards period. 
---
Who do I blame for this unjust hatred for these cards? Dog? 
---
**Rotating**
---
Shaman:
---
* Primalfin Totem
---
* Volcano
---
* Spirit Echo

---
* Crushing Hand

* Healing Rain
---
* Murmering Elemental
---
* Lesser Sapphire Spellstone
---
* Unstable Evolution
---
* Grumble, Worldshaker
---
That's not what the card says it does.
---
With no new features, QOL improvements, and general good faith from the devs in taking and rebutting fredback; it's no wonder we all hate the game.
---
They went for short term profit, that was always their goal. Run the game into the ground while milking it for everything it's worth. That's why they made the switch to expansions. That's why anything added to this game is purely to put money back into their pockets, not to **improve** anything.
---
I usually play ranked for the 5 wins. I like the cardbacks, but other than that there is absolutely nothing rewarding or motivating enough for me to keep grinding the same 2-5 tier one decks. I mean it's fine that ranked is how it is, it will always be like that. It lies in the nature of the format. But I like playing and playing against fun/interesting/unique/meme/gimmick/whatever decks. You'll play enough competitive decks in standard anyways. 
---
Eh you can just make a new adapt with a new set of choices. 
---
Still would of preferred Anduin nerfed to only Target Minions rather then what they did to Raza. :(
---
I knew this would happen eventually when Activision acquired them.
---
yep, but still not "exact copy" anymore
---
This is why the game is dead...
---
I played HotS as my main game for years, and I truly loved my time playing. But let‚Äôs not deny that the game was a flop in the market from the day it was launched. Blizzard dumped time and money into it for 4 years and it just never took off.
---
I think the sign of a healthy company is one that understands when something is failing, can realistically assess its future, and make the hard choice to walk away.
---
Well ... ah, you got me. Cant argue with that :)
---
Clearly no one in this thread plays wild, Patches is still one of the most played wild legendaries, nerf be damned.
---
Wow, you are very defensive. But I'm standing buy the non-interactive statement. Certainly it takes skill and knowledge to win, but better players don't even watch their fights while they instead cycle through their buy options or scout other boards.
---
how big is the player base? last time i played a few matches (like a year ago) i got paired with people way higher lv than me and the queue times were pretty significant... wasnt a nice experience at all and and even when my expectations werent high at all
---
Priest corrupts voidlord, warlock copies his own corrupted voidlord, both voidlords switch to the priests side.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the cofusion.
---
C-Could you repeat all that please??
---
[[Beryllium Nullifier]]
---
Yup 
---
Except there is no way the third largest moba was dying. Blizzard didn't make the millions daily they expected with it and so they took it out back and shot it. That's way more greedy than announcing the ending of support to a game that is actually losing you money.

Magnetic is such a fun mechanic. It took me a while to appreciate it.
---
Thank God HotS is dead.

Making a moba game in a saturated market was a horrible idea. Artificially keeping alive a dead Esports scene is a waste of Blizzards time and resources.

you abbreviating Leeroy Jenkins makes me unreasonably mad. 
---
Honestly, MTGA is what finally got me to leave Hearthstone, and I've been playing since beta.
---
The reward system is MUCH better in MTGA. You get daily quests and separate daily rewards. I can easily earn a pack a day.
---
I actually like the mature fantasy seriousness though. I'm 28 and goofy murlocks and tit-covering napkins have their place, but I've warmed to the more mature look. Magic and Hearthstone have wonderful art styles, but there is just so much more content in Magic. 20+ years of expansions will do that.
---
I think the thing that really changed everything for me though is the interactivity. Being able to respond to someone making plays during their turn is like a breath of fresh air.
---
Counters, instants, these things add tactical value that Hearthstone just does not have. A working graveyard adds so many more interactions. Being able to block creatures. There is just so much more to think and do!
---
After a couple days of playing Magic Arena I sadly can't go back to Hearthstone. I thought the sunk cost fallacy would keep me invested and playing, but the fields here are so much greener.
---
That board wipe that spends armor seems like a huge loss.
---
You ignored my points again and just restated your 'capitalism ho' opinion. The only certain thing is Blizzard moves its production fully into the mobile market is that its reputation with it's current customer demographic goes in the toilet. Stop equating me to 'screaming kid' who doesn't understand econmics when you don't even try to rebut my points.
---
Who care's if Baku stays? If you nerfed Odd paladin it would pretty much just be odd mage on the ladder.

It will depend if they will announce something to change the state of heartstone. If they continue to milk us with little to no effort on changing the state of the game then no, i wont pre-order.
---
Yeah, always odd how people call it the Pirate Warrior Meta. I enjoyed the meta a lot, but Shaman could actually win long games against control, for some reason, while also winning instantly against Warrior with Maelstrom.
---
I'm not convinced this works, but if it did why wouldn't you just Treachery then Faceless.
---
Overwatch still kinda fun, but the new map (Paris) is kinda bland and super unbalanced (Defense can choke attackers in 3 main points around the map)  
---
Hearthstone I've been mostly playing ~15 games a month (brawls + win 5 games + games I lost + bored playing)  
---
WoW I can no longer afford the sub fee, since it rose a lot on my country, not to mention the guild disbanding after the amount of grinding not being fun anymore. And BfA doesn't appeal to me.
---
So, Blizzard has became quite boring to me
---
&gt;They literally implemented a rule purely because it was only constant complaining everyday about the state of BFA. 
---
And the mods enacted that rule because the positive people were complaining about all the whining! So again the blame falls back on them and people should take it up with them.
---
Only way is quite a strech. Did you try doing it in incognito?
---
Never leaving a minion on the board against wall priest is actually a bad idea. For many of their minions, it's much better to leave them at low health than to kill them. If they stay at low health, they're useless. If you kill them, they can be revived and come back at full health, where they're much more dangerous.
---
This ain‚Äôt it boss
---
Inner Fire, Divine Spirit and Mindblast combos have all been non-existent or complete meme tier before Radiant and Shadow Visions and will be again. MC is a terrible card. Control priest before the last year or two (excluding when Razakus was overpowered and big priest, which also dies at rotation), is exactly what you want a "vanilla control deck" to be.
---
There has been a lot of discussion about Genn and Baku, one of the options the developers mentioned was rotating them out early.  
---
I mean new game modes would be great. But that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this post. 
---
&gt;About the WoW Reddit on BFA, new rules were implemented to prevent the shit show of complaint topics that were opened every day. 
---
Will say to you what I said to the other guy: Blame still falls back on those who like WoW for not wanting to see the game shit on. Those people complained so much they got other complaints removed.
---
just play another class
---
I thought Smite is the 3rd most popular moba
---
It's right there, fourth from the right, next to Zilliax! Easy puzzle!
---
have you ever played an aggro mirror going second? 
---
Blizzard made games that was fun, and thus attracted a lot of players.
---
Now, they make games that attracts a lot of players just long enough to make them throw some money at it.
---
Everything Blizzard makes now feels like a CEO robot went through a petabyte of excel sheets, and tries to create games with it.
---
WoWs latest expansion feels so formulaic and artificial its downright dizzying how quickly the fog of newness and immersion breaks. Nearly instantly you see the overly, extremely finetuned systems that is all about drip-feeding you juuuust enough at a time to keep you coming back.
---
I never thought I would come to dislike Blizzard so much, but right now they are not much else than EA holding my favorite game related IPs of all time hostage.
---
Blizzard just keeps trying to appeal to everyone and ends up satisfying almost no one. Then they can hug their MAUs until reality sets in. Their loyal players are leaving, and the short-term players are no longer interested. 
---
Blizzard has mostly been this way for awhile, if not at least since WoW was released.
---
The biggest thing though, and the one I have never forgiven Blizzard for, was Naxxramas.  They released this raid with full knowledge their servers could not handle it.  The server I was on could barely handle the instance with only my guild in it, if anyone else ever tried, everyone was fucked.  We had to schedule the weirdest hours so we wouldn't crash the server and be unable to do anything.  Then they announce server transferring.  For a small fee you could transfer to a server that was stable!  They were upgrading their servers and you could pay to transfer your character(s) to a server that was now actually able to run the game you were paying to play.  My server was not one of the early ones being upgraded and we had a serious problem.  There was no date on when we would be upgraded.  Blizzard would simply dump info and say this week these servers!  Many of our people wanted to wait, surely it wouldn't take too long.  Others said this was stupid and wanted to leave.  We lost several people who just transferred because they didn't want to wait.  We had people who didn't to transfer because they had several alts and the transfers would get expensive.  My guild ultimately died as too many people transferred.  My guild died because blizzard stuck us on shitty hardware which couldn't run the game and then charged us to transfer to a server which could handle the game we were paying them to play.
---
To me the whole server transfer thing is the biggest horseshit blizzard has done and I've never given them the benefit of the doubt on anything since then.  This was in 2006 I believe.  It has been almost 13 years since, and they have only gotten more brazen in how they want to exploit players.  They haven't cared about the players since at least the launch of WoW and to think they did is simply looking back optimistically.
---
This ignores all of the other shit they did during wow.  They have an absolute love of sticking which shitty mechanics even when they don't work or everyone hates them.  They love extolling their "internal numbers" even though literally everyone else knows it is bullshit.  Even when they say things which are simply untrue, they would quickly deny the original statement and claim they were misinterpreted.  This company has been shit for awhile because they had too much money and were too successful.  They didn't care then and they certainly don't care now.
---
So it's okay to say Blizzard sucks for putting out shitty products, but it's not okay to say people suck for BUYING those shitty products? Because that's what I'm thinking. Not outright targeting and harassing people but calling them out on the relevant subreddit, whether it's related to the game or the developer/publisher.
---
Okay, but to assume that they're doing that in a discussion like this is just intellectually dishonest
---
thanks guys :)
---
&gt; I just took a look and you're right, there's about 40K active players on right now. Honestly I didn't realise it was still that popular to this day.
---
It's one of those games with so much replayability and just fun feeling classes for so many situations.  The random goofiness and spontaneity makes it a fun, casual experience.
---
Awesome movement options and a general case of skill shots make it a blast.
---
From a business standpoint, stable is dead.  If you're not showing growth you are going to get maintenance resources to maintain your stable customer base while resources are put towards other projects that are growing or have potential to grow.
---
Riot is still living large off of League of Legends and that game was released a decade ago.  That is the kind of lightning strike these studios are looking for, and HotS clearly isn't it.  
---
NA?
---
No, that's actually bad strategy as it helps them resurrect stuff. Much better to leave their minions alive at low health against minions without enough attack for them to die into.
---
I honestly think they should HOF [[Divine Spirit]] and don't touch my boy [[Inner Fire]]. The source of this entire problem is the x2 health for that cheap mana. Whenever a minion with high health being introduce, there is a chance Divine Spirit can break the game with it. Some deck can't even deal with 30+ HP taunt minion though, or having very limited direct removal for that. It limits the design space of high health minion so much for me.
---
That's is my rant about it. Please Blizzard, don't nerf it but HOF instead so people who actually like the deck can still use it.
---
TL;DR: Blame people for supporting a company's shitty practices. Don't EXCLUSIVELY blame the company. The reason the post is so long is because I have to clarify for all the idiots out there that I'm not shilling for companies. I just don't think they deserve ALL the blame when any """""greedy""""" company only BECOMES greedy when consumers accept their mediocre products at increasing prices. It's like No-Face from the movie Spirited Away. People give the company what they want, so they continue to demand more. If people stopped giving them what they want, they'd either back off or die. Both are positive outcomes.
---
They're pouring money into OW league, trying to make it relevant but let's face it. The core gameplay isn't fun to watch...They really fucked up on this one.
---
An battle royal mode + unique OverWatch heroes would save the game but it's already been in the market and it's called Apex Legends. 
---
I don't know what they're doing but Blizzard's been behind the curve for awhile, none of their games doing well ATM.
---
From what I recall it was pretty unanimously agreed upon that The Un'goro Meta was one of if not the best we ever had. The meta was constantly changing, pretty sure just weeks before KFT came out people were still coming up with new decks that were gaining traction in the meta. It's the only expansion where I played pretty consistently from launch until the next one. Usually I play for a month or two and then barely at all until the new expansion starts getting hyped.
---
And to be fair, I think that under normal circumstances that would often be the case with the first set of the year when rotation hits. Even though there's less cards to go around, so many established cards leave The Meta that it takes a lot longer for everyone to figure out what works and what doesn't with the new card pool. And I think it's pretty clear that we didn't have that same feeling with Witchwood because the rotation at the time was just so much less significant, because so many of the meta defining cards weren't going anywhere. But this time, we are going to be left with so many cards which have never seen play but will be people's only options in conjunction with the new expansion, so it could be pretty interesting for a while. I want to hope that Blizzard isn't putting all their eggs in that basket, that the rotation of the overtuned sets will just magically fix everything wrong with the game, but it wouldn't surprise me if they intend to see what happens first before implementing any bigger changes beyond Hall of Faming a few cards.
---
Honestly I think it's partially because of the power level of cards they released in 2017 that have yet to rotate out now. Once Keleseth is gone along with all these very powerful neutral cards, we can finally get some other cards to see play again. Baku and Genn are a problem too, but it's unlikely we'll see anything on that end.
---
And the polarization. A lot of end game fantasy cards that was *sick* on release (hello Bloodreaver Gul'dan, DK Jaina, etc) were simply too good for the game. There's a power level that is simply too high for Hearthstone, and they hit that. Hearthstone didn't have a lot of win conditions other than "out value your opponent" and "beat them down quick" but once the big combos and DKs came out, suddenly there were very strong specific win conditions, and it was just hard to top that with new sets. OFC there have been stupid string win conditions or cards before too (hi Patron, Patches, and other decks) but some of those were relatively hard to play, and IMO was more of a problem with the balance team screwing up than the design team.

Two current mechathun decks die, and mechathun druid loses so much survivability, removal, and draw.
---
The issues with WoW aren't "catering to casuals," it's releasing fuck all in terms of content more than anything. I had my full T2 in Classic, my full T6 in TBC, etc. Raiding is straight better now than it was a long time ago. It's more better if you don't want to join a 4 night guild and adhere to a strict schedule, but it's better anyway. Fights are interesting, mythic raids are hard, etc.
---
But you can't develop an AAA game every 3 months and that's how they've priced WoW, so they cover it up with a bunch of endless make work bullshit. Now it's Azerite, Legion had Legendaries, AP, war supplies and Argunite, etc. They used to do it by making even more basic stuff tedious - kill 20 times the monsters to level that you would now, monsters would kill most classes in a 2v1, etc.
---
The core issue is that eventually you can't stomach the fucking grind any more, and there's so little gameplay outside of it that it's insane. Legion, despite that mess of currencies above, is the most fun I had with the game since my guild died in Wrath, because I came in as a new dad with limited time and could still actually access gameplay. (And I came in after NH released, so there was actually a decent amount of content.)
---
As an exclusively OTK player, mechathun is getting much weaker. Not a single one of my current decklists will be valid come april
---
The extra card + coin is required to balance the odds for the player going second.
---
Going first is still typically preferred.
---
I honestly don't think they are a problem at all. There might have been singular problematic decks (like odd and even paladin, but that might just have been dude pally being too strong), but Genn and Baku facilitates so vastly different decks, that they enforce a diverse meta just by existing.
---
But then again, I'm a wild player and an advocate of keeping the power level of wild high. In my opinion, the restriction is really harsh and just playing good stuff (which a lot of those decks are) is going to be worse and worse compared to playing specific synergies.
---
Puck Friest!
---
Thanks vs for report!
---
Idk, mobas have been kicking around quite a long time now, and they really are the best team game esport format. Games like csgo and r6 are ok, but as a spectator sport dota 2 and LoL are just better than anything else. That‚Äôs mainly why I think battle royales won‚Äôt last - I just don‚Äôt see how something like fortnite is supposed to work as a spectator sport. 
---
To be a really popular and long-lasting esport, your game has to be fun to play, have a lot of depth, and be easy to watch. Games that don‚Äôt tick all these boxes just won‚Äôt make it. 
---
nah.
---
TL:DR; sideboarding
---
Yep, I'm not as actively following things and as "Wow, that's so amazing, this is so fun!" as when i first started playing, but I still have a good time most days when I play for a half hour or whatever, and there's enough deck diversity to have fun with things.
---
Glenn/Baku going to HoF maybe the best way to ensure we don‚Äôt have a stagnant meta

Incognito, clearing cache and cookies, diferent DNS, tweeting HS for no reply, just like other people, using data my own WiFi and other wifis.
---
This is a problem that from what i see only happens in Portugal, not sure why.
---
Im just sugesting to use TOR to login and pick a champion, since it worked for me and others.
---
One thing that really keeps me from playing anymore is retarded cards like Mecha'thun. Nothing feels more downright terrible than absolutely dominating a game just to be instantly killed by one of its stupid combos. I always get comments like "just play an aggro deck LUL", but I actually want to play decks that require a bit of thought or meme decks when I play the game.
---
I thought it would be better if I just dropped ranked entirely and played casual only, but the only thing different is that Ranked is just Hunter every second game and Casual is Hunter or OTK every second game. I have no idea how, but this game needs a mode where meta decks are forbidden and it needs to NEVER EVER print cards like Mecha'thun anymore or any kind of cards that can confirm an OTK in any way (DK Paladin hero power). People will always find a way to make it work in an OTK deck and no one is gonna have fun playing against them.
---
From where I'm standing, in wild, the meta is very different now than just a few months ago. The nerf to kingsbane shook the meta real hard as well the changes to various dude paladin decks.
---
It is hilarious to me that Hearthstone is moving toward sideboards while MTG Arena wants to move toward a Multi-Deck format.....
---
So I guess "Year of the ..." updates and HoF stuff will be tomorrow?
---
Or you live long enough to see yourself become the villian.....
---
I'd say how to do sideboards without having to waste time waiting for players to swap cards out, which is fine. This is designed for a viewing audience. Still, it feels convoluted. Overall, I'm not feeling especially enthused by this. 
---
Wow I sure love preemptive side decking. The entire point of sidedecks is to have cards that help in specific matchups. This is like going: ''let's prepare for only 3 matchups, coding is hard.''
---
I swear there‚Äôs some catchup mechanics I got some insane pills after getting back into it too recently 
---
/s?
---
I don¬¥t understand something. I really like the idea of multiple decks but are we playing only with one hero? WTF
---
Is more power creep coming? The game experienced a huge spike when KFT was released (and Un'Goro looks high too)
---
unless you enjoy the challenge of, you know, winning
---
You have 60 cards in normal MtG with 15 cards to add. Rarely anyone adds the full 15. 5 is probably the average. Two 30 card decks with 5 new cards is perfect.
---
Yes, he is a dragon. The card depicts his troll form. Just like the card for Wrathion, who is also a dragon, depicts his human form.
---
My dude, I totally read your list after Googling yesterday, heh. Thanks for compiling. I just wasn't sure if the "pity mechanic" would be in effect for (1) the intro set cards and (2) anything that was on sale :P
---
So, let's say I buy the welcome bundle and have 10 packs + the ones I earned in the intro quest. I'd have 14.
---
What set(s) should I focus on next in terms of saving up gold? I will ignore the three that are rotating out. Do I want to acquire 10 packs before I open any of them, or just be sure to stick with a set until I hit that first Legendary?
---
Cheers!
---
Unless you're a pro, you won't need to because it won't be available to the proles.

I like the Elemental Shaman list with 25 elementals, shudderwock, (2) Earthen Might, and (2) Hex.  You need to mully strategically but I am better than 50/50 against priest and its like a 70% WR against the Odd Secret Mage.
---
Even if this was a 10 card sideboard (which it isn't), it's actually a smaller percentage than an MTG sideboard when you account for lands.  Usually 24 or so of your 60 are lands and aren't typically things you're boarding in and out, so really the 15 card sideboard changes up your 36ish actual spells.  To get that same percentage change in a Hearthstone deck you'd need like a 12-13 card sideboard, and this is two different 5 card sideboards.  
---
Inner rage I can see in a very different (ie no kelesseth) build of the deck which runs a lot of 2/3 drops to help get early pressure. In a deck with amani berserkers, inner rage makes sense to me. Also, if your committed to acolyte, inner rage makes more sense to me as well. But in all my games, I've only once run out of cards in my hand, and that was against a wall priest who either couldn't draw his combo or was enjoying watching me suffer against his taunts, and even then I was down to the last 3 low power cards in my deck anyway. Added, low pressure draw wasn't winning that match for me anyway. Though, speaking of that game and the insane number of wall priests, cutting spellbreakers is risky because getting through the walls is the only way to win that matchup. 
---
Just wait for Warcraft Auto Chess. It'll be sweet.
---
Please tell me this means more Pirates!
---
Hah, let me tell you, we won't......
---
Pshh, a regular common card? Pack is obviously trash.
---
But their old games are what are really taking a dip because of the change of developers. Activision also doesnt care as much about making fans happy. I also don't wanna hear yo shit about getting tired of memes. Give me the facts and stop complaining fam. If you want me to understand I'm wrong, dont throw in that meme shit. Tell me what's really going on
---
That makes no sense. Power levels change based on the context. If you're changing the context every single month, you risk changing power levels way too frequently.
---
what you need to compare is winrate of same deck without dire frenzy. here you can see that the deck with the highest win rate among 10 most popular midrange hunter decks doesn't have any dire frenzy. https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/137/midrange-hunter#tab=similar
---
Still has the enrage keyword on angry chicken (1:26).
---
Bliz can't even be bothered to update their images
---
Doesn‚Äôt say if wild tournaments will also be held within this but it‚Äôs blizzard so of course they won‚Äôt.
---
Yup same as above comments.
---
Inconsistent results from top players. Extremely dependent on matchups. Lineup-prep felt useless. 
---
5 cards was just enough to stop decks from switching archetypes so at most people could make some tech changes. 
---
It's not a 15 card sideboard to a 60 card MTG deck.  It's a 15 card sideboard to a 36ish card MTG deck because the other 24 cards are lands that are rarely sideboarded in and out.  These 5 card sideboards are minuscule by comparison, it would be like having a 6 card sideboard in MtG.
---
I'm sure there's still no way to practice the competitive format in a in-client queue... lol 
---
It's meant to function like sideboards in Magic where you're essentially bringing one deck but can adjust it to react to your opponent.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve been enjoying zoolock tbh. No game seems unwinable except odd warrior, and that‚Äôs really just a tossup of openeing hands
---
GIVE ME THE ADMIRAL PROUNDMOORE AND SPECIAL INTERACTION WITH JAINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
the most boring format ever, good job once again blizzard, bravo.
---
I've been playing since launch. I've had a 12 win arena run, despite focusing more on ladder, and I have golden portraits on all 9 classes. Never played enough to reach legend, but I used to have a ton of fun with the game.
---
I was on vacation recently, and didn't have time to work on the dailies. Once I got back, I realized I didnt miss it at all, and that resuming the daily quests sounded like a chore, rather than fun. This quest "bug fix" this week was the last straw, and I uninstalled.
---
It was fun while it lasted!
---
Would it be another Artichoke?
---
Sorry. I'll see myself out.
---
There absolutely is and should be. This could be the next big wave of strategy games. You can't tell me people wouldn't lose their shit over "Warcraft Auto Chess" or the like.
---
*Me before watching:*
---
‚ÄúOh sweet, like a format where Fibonacci can bring multiple Warrior builds and battle Zetalot‚Äôs multiple Priest builds?‚Äù
---
*Me after watching:*
---
‚ÄúOh, just sideboards. At least it‚Äôs something.‚Äù
---
magic is not really 60 cards. if you have around 25 lands, you have 15 cards for a "35 cards deck".
---
Without actually looking at HS servers no one ones, because it could be completely possible to build big data analysis of how many times players win when card X is drawn in the first turn, and then weight the chances of that card to be drawn early.
---
Slip by? What do you mean? Are you suggesting that they not match pally against pally? It's working as intended, it's not an oversight.
---
This actually happened to me yesterday, I had 3 quests and was hoping that this bug still exists. I have had so much college work and I work part-time so I haven't had any time recently to play Hearthstone. Was pretty sad that I lost a 50 gold quest.
---
What new mode
---
They've stated the tournaments are Bo3, except for the finals which are Bo5.
---
it's good job
---
MTGA implements it by having Bo1 and Bo3 be the same ladder. If you win a Bo3 match, it counts as 2 wins for the purpose of ranking up, and if you lose it counts as 2 losses. While I think separate ladders may be a better approach, it splinters the player base too much, and the current system works quite well. 
---
It's a smart way to bring a sideboard mechanic if you don't have a lot of time and it wasn't planned beforehand. I hope they implement a fully fledged sideboard given time, but with hs you never know.
---
They never said there are client-side changes to verify that the deck requirements are met (and there doesn't seem to be). So no, there is actually no coding, just like there was no coding involved for the previous competitive conquest format.
---
Part of it, I think, is that they qualify it as "one of the biggest changes coming to Hearthstone in 2019" when it is obviously far from that. Honestly, it's not really even a change to Hearthstone, so I can see at least some of the ire.
---
Not agreeing or disagreeing either way though, just trying to provide an explanation.
---
This just looks stupid. Not available to most players and extremely limited in deck building options. What‚Äôs the point of this? It just looks like tournament rules but bad.
---
Time for Graal the shark meta 
---
Hopefully
---
I am not jealous
---
this is canon
---
Firebat is very inconsistent, and has been DOTA'ing a lot. Kibler is great of course, but still only spends half his time with HS. His heart will always belong to Magic, and it shows.
---
(made fastly by non-native so you know)

---
What happens is, like with John Scolly (?). John cames from PepsiCo. And they would mostly change they're product once every 10 years, like for them a new product is the new sized bottle.
---
So if you're a product-person you couldn't change the course of that company very much. So who influences success of PepsiCo? - the sales and marketing people. Therefore the one who got promoted and therefore they're the once that run the company.
---
Well, for PepsiCo that might be okay, but - it turnes out same think can happen to  it companies that have monoplyes. companies like IBM or Xerox. If you're a product person in these companies - so you make a better computer or printer - so what? When you got monipoly market share the company is any more successful. So the people who can make the company more successful are sales and marketing ppl. And they end up running the companies. And product ppl get driven out of decision making forums. And the companies forget what I means to make great products. The product genius that brought them to this monoplyes gets rooted out by ppl running these companies who have no conception of a good product vs a bad product. The have no conception about the craftsmanship that's required to take a good idea and make it a good product. And they really have no Feeling in their heart to help the customers.
---
Go ahead and dust the whole lot?
---
The game has been stagnated because they lack these features.  This is an improvement for 0.001% (less?) of the population.  Most aren't going to bother with any tournaments for as long as they are on some weird third-party site.  
---
Im currently using a deck from the Disguised toast website and can surely say it has good and bad days.
---
Im looking to make a more fun deck when I get more dust or get more luck with cards.
---
No worries, mate. Unless you‚Äôre a pro Hearthstone player, you won‚Äôt have to! This new format has absolutely nothing to do with the client whatsoever. That‚Äôs right, Sir or Madam, this new update has ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PLAYERBASE. 
---
‚ÄúThank God, I don‚Äôt have to deal with any new confusing features or modes in this game‚Äù, you might say. You betcha! Team 5 has got you covered. They know that 90% of their playerbase will get horribly confused and stuck in the menu if any change is made to UI whatsoever. Remember when Tavern Brawl came out? Most people were lost for weeks before they figured out how to start a game. With this convoluted change to pro rules, they keep the burden of scary new changes on the people most equipped to deal with them. 
---
&gt;They get away with it for the most part by throwing a ton of money at their esports so they get good production value for the events but they are terrible at actually managing their esports.
---
This. They visually look good if you only watch for a few minutes, but that's about it. Overwatch is a great example. That game simply did not grow as an esport on its own despite the fact that in the BETA for it people were trying to start leagues. It turned out to be too hard to put together a competitive community and it wasn't interesting to watch. Nothing has changed except now they pay people a shit ton of money to make it look more professional on the surface.
---
In contrast, R6S had a pretty active competitive scene long before it started getting big funding. Same for LoL.
---
This is probably a last minute thing, maybe they do something more meaningful down the line with enough time to do it properly. If this stays like this it doesn't seem enough of a change.
---
If only they had a billion dollars of revenue to do add a feature for the first time in 3 years...
---
who asked for this
---
Way too many expansions, way too little dust from disenchanting things, way too high of dust cost to craft cards you need to remain competitive after each expansion.
---
I fucking loved Hearthstone when it first came out, when I was naive enough to believe that every card I was obtaining would be playable forever (there was a time where Wild came as a surprise; one of the original pulls was that this game wasn't like Magic with standard constantly rotating around. Smart people called it would have to get there after a few years, and were right, but I didn't listen, I didn't want it to be true.)
---
Arena was super fun, but even those rewards weren't really good enough for the time invested unless you played really really well. And even when you did, the amount of time you'd have to pump into Arena to get all the cards you want... Either play the game full time, or spend $50 twice a year.
---
Honestly if it was spend $25 once a year to keep up, I might have stuck with it. But the fucking whales showed them that the correct business decision - short term mind you - was to milk the shit out of the whales.
---
And the fucking ladder reset every month. Making it nearly impossible for a casual gamer to ever hit legendary without devoting an entire month of most of their free time. The number of times I got to rank 1 and got close, with only a few days left, and then ran out of time... Super disheartening. I might have stuck around longer and played more if the seasons were like three months long. But with only being able to play one or two, maaybe three decent competitive decks on latter without pumping in a lot of money, it felt really fucking shitty every single time that rank would reset and I would go from rank 1 to rank 17 or whatever it was. 
---
I spent $15 on Slay the Spire and I feel I've already gotten more pure enjoyment from that game then I did with years of hearthstone. I don't have to worry about that game suddenly finding itself behind a brand new, $40 paywall. Wow!
---
3.5-4 is better. Priest, Hunter and Paladin will almost certainly be represented. Question is whether Rogue/Warrior are as well.
---
god forbid we actually get a new format in the client. 
---
How so?
---
I commend your comment commenting on how one should not comment before completely comprehending comments. 
---
Nothing kills thrill of new expansion better than opening 6-8 useless epics and 3 meme legendaries in your first 50-70 packs
---
Forge of souls is a garbage card definitely get a supercollider. I‚Äôve been playing Odd Warrior from rank 20 to 6 and supercollider wins games 
---
That doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad thing.  This is the quickest way they were able to develop the feature.  It‚Äôs better than waiting forever.
---
Wait. Does this replace the current HS pro format? Seems rather boring to watch matches with so little differences within the decks.
---
That is the risk. However if you find the deck that counters the best class deck you should be ahead. So you should maybe find the deck that counters that one, and so on and so on. And if this format works we will see players get more of an identity, like in the beginning when Ek0p was mr handlock, Amaz was the only one playing priest and Thijs was a druid player. Im excited, but worried :)
---
You gave me birth, now I'll give you death! 
---
A-ha!
---
Hey at least they're removing MSRP
---
They're better print some pretty good tech cards. then otherwise it's just a coin toss of which deck counters which.
---
Well that's a good change at least. Glad it's not perpetuating the fireside gathering crap.
---
im sure they will for the pure fact in the past there hasnt been a huge use for sideboard like cards. they have always sprinkled them in to sets but most of them havent been used in normal decks. also if you wanted to you could add a couple greedy cards in one of the decks to try to swing a sideboard match up. you could also use a package of combo cards to change up a deck
---
Zalae is a robot programmed to win at any cost, so he really does not count. /s
---
It wouldnt tho. It would be so your toggwaggle beat my malygos? Time to change to anti-toggwaggle malygos druid
---
You can be creative with the nerfs, especially if you're willing to  change the hero powers then you can do other changes. Here are some ideas. You could add an additional, negative, start of game effect to balance it, like skip x draws, or shuffle x bad cards into the game. Or you could change the triggers. I like swapping them, by making the odd card reduce the cost and the even upgrading the hp. Also possible is make it non odd/even based. Perhaps make baku trigger if your cards cost 4 or more and make genn trigger if your cards cost 4 or less?
---
Still doesn't change much if you intend to come up with a home brew deck you cannot test because you cannot afford it. 
---
And *my* point is that the rules are in no way a 5-card sideboard. The fact that you are restricted in how you can sub in the 10 cards doesn't mean you only really have 5.
---
You couldn't be more wrong. He still sees play in pirate rogue, a tier 1 deck. If being an auto include in a tier 1 deck classifies as not "making the cut" I have no idea what does
---
Realistically, we‚Äôd get different complaint posts every week is what would happen. :)
---
It **was** pretty great when everybody played Volcanosaur for a week.
---
Warcraft 3 was released 17 years ago. And all they are doing now is re-skinning it for a moneygrab instead making a new WC RTS game.
---
But all three decks are almost the same, for both players. Imagine a mirror match going to the ropes. Five matches where 90%+ of the cards are the same? As a viewer, I find the prospect of different classes and decks to be more exciting. A bigger sideboard would bring some much needed variety, even if it was just a couple more cards like 7 or 8 total. 
---
Haha really? I missed that, must have been living under a rock.
---
Ideally the company would not ask for extra money and make the prices available themselves, but obviously that is not the climate at Activision Blizzard at the moment.
---
So the good thing is that this can make the scene self-sustaining or even directly profitable, which is cool.
---
except its not a sideboard, its three decks... because adding a sideboard would mean Team 5 would actually have to do something other than churn out expansions
---
Or when Blockbuster turned down Netflix.
---
To a lot of old magic players who started playing HS. Magic has always been the more interesting game, and now it‚Äôs even easier to play it and grind for decks than hearthstone. 
---
Brode oversaw the sets that created the problems we've been experiencing all year. Stop acting like he was some hero who left because he didn't want to be associated with some evil force. He left so he could be part of a company he would have a personal stake in.
---
Thanks man. I might tech that. Haven't met too many mecha'thun players on ladder though.
---
You missed my complaint about the slow ass animations 
---
Thanks for the advice guys.
---
That is definitely what I'm optimistically hoping for, but I can't really tell if I'm going to like or dislike this change until I see the cards next set. I'm definitely excited for some new cards for the first time in a while and will probably go back to grinding out dailies and saving up gold for next set.
---
Well fair enough.  (Although I‚Äôll note that mtg also doesn‚Äôt have a mobile client, and that my Hearthstone mobile client lags quite a bit going into deck construction screens for some reason; but sure, 1:30 might be enough time).
---
&gt;So later this year, we will introduce a limited-time-only esports bundle in the shop. A portion of all sales will be distributed across the base prize pools of each of the three 2019 Hearthstone Masters Tour events.  
---
I don't keep up on the whole competitive format too much but with the full article is the prizes offered still the same as last year?  
---
If so then this is cool, extra possibly prizes for competitors.  
---
Great idea. Too bad it's an indie developer :(
---
Well the problem still is that it is extremly uncovenient to play in those tournaments. Especially true casual players will not participate in them.
---
We played it in Tespa when midrange shaman was the only deck viable on ladder and there was 3 main decks that were played.
---
So can Cubelock and a number of decks. I don't think that necessarily proves the sets were busted, although of course they were.
---
I wonder how extensively the team at Blizzard tested this concept and if they tested both from a viewership and player standpoint. I'm definitely gonna watch it and see if it's interesting but on paper, it seems less fun than conquest. 
---
This is actually pretty cool.  Think about this:
---
The world championship will actually determine a specific class that is the world champion, not just a player.
---
Interesting! My random thoughts:
---
* Amusing that Magic is doing a Hearthston-y format for the upcoming Mythic Championship whilst Hearthstone moves to a Magic-y one.
---
* Quite intrigued to see how it goes though some concerns the format could be too narrow (lots of people bringing the same class).
---
* Would play this a lot if Hearthstone introduced a BO3 ladder along these lines (or shared BO1/BO3 ladder like Magic Arena). It would be amazing to get to play the 'pro' format in client. I really hope this is the endgame for this approach. This could be the new thing that Hearthstone needs to refresh it. I don't want to hope too much but it seems to me it being BO3 makes it so much more likely than with a BO5 format like Conquest (particularly with bans), where rounds can take hours. Tournament mode incoming? Hard not to hope just a little bit.....
---
Yeah honestly they probably waited to implement this format because they weren't confident they could balance the game effectively.  Since overall game balance has been pretty superb lately, they were probably more comfortable with it.
---
Yeah but he doesn't see play in that deck because he's good, the deck is good, patches isn't. Good decks can use bad cards for special case synergy, it's not unheard of. But if I were to make pirate rogue, I wouldn't include him, I'm sure there are at least 5 good replacements some of which are probably better anyway.
---
Real sideboards with be much better but this inherently allows for so much variety in matches.
---
Completely agree, HoF it.  It definitely limits design space as proven by wall priest and if they don't we are effectively stuck with wall priest for another year since 2 of the main taunt cards remain in rotation.  
---
And keleseth
---
When is the hyper aggro paladin cancer going to go away? Mid range huntard as well while you're at it.
---
adventures: $20 = every card in expansion
---
packs: $20 = 5% of expansion, $200 = 90% of expansion and 20% of legendaries
---
I don't think there are too many combo decks. Their strength might be a touch too high, but there are no more of them than of aggro. It's my favorite deck type, and it deserves a place in the game just as much as any other.
---
MTGA \* already has nailed it with Bo3 but they try to hide it and try to promote their new garbage format. It baffles me how incompetent these guys at wotc can be
---
but they used to put out games that were made out of passion, not made to squeeze out as much money as possible
---
Understandable. Looking thorough that approach it makes more sense. As I mentioned earlier having those options would be nice but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs entirely possible to make that case for every card. [[Sharkfin Fan]] is a great example of an interesting card and quite a good one at that. Would be a lot better if we had those types of cards instead of the [[Ultrasour]] of the past. 
---
?????? what the fuck
---
***REEEEEE they're trying to make money!!!***

10/7/14 Beast  
---
&gt;Depending on the format certain decks can go for huge favorites in game 1, like 90%+ down to huge dogs after sideboards like 20%.
---
That seems like such a gimmick, playing a deck to win game 1 on "surprise" and then praying to ben brode that you win a 20% somewhere later in the matchup? As soon as you go into a BO5 or BO7 the deck is unplayable. I really don't see justification of not allowing sideboards game 1 just so that these kind of decks can exist, those kind of decks just shouldn't exist and that's partially what people complain about in hearthstone's current BO1 ladder today.

Biding time* back and forth between app and chrome on android. Cause for some reason video wont upload on the app. And I cannot edit the original comment on either app or web. 
---
Zombie chow was never in standard. Nor was it in facehunter, mech mage and other real aggro decks.
---
If you think Zombie Chow is good design, you're fucking stupid.
---
Zombie Chow is the retarded minion that snowballed the deisgn into a spiral of high tempo one-drops. That brought us mechs and dragon hatchlings and those brought us Tunnel Trogg to counter balancing the unplayable time of shaman.
---
We would have never needed a Tunnel Trogg if Zombie Chow was never made in the first place.

Only if you are sure that you can get enough of the packs to hit the 10 packs pity timer before the rotation.

At least it‚Äôs in Vegas, you could probably get a flight there from most places in the US (Sorry South America) for about $59 and as long as you don‚Äôt stay at a place with a ridiculous resort fee be around that as well.
---
That already happens now. 
---
People, very recently, have come to tournaments and brought all-aggro, or all-combo (or anti-control) or all control decks in anticipation of hard countering an expected tournament meta.
---
I don't dust cards (unless i have more than 2) and I don't spend more than the 50 dollar discounted set at the beginning of every expansion and I'm doing just fine.
---
That being said, yes I do play pretty much every day
---
OP doesn't have a single comment in this thread...
---
How is a new player expected to save 3500 gold? The cards couldn't even be crafted. You're basically asking new players to do nothing but farm gold...which isn't fun or rewarding and they'll just quit.
---
I'm not an MTG expert but this just sounds like sideboarding with a lot of limitations and needing 3  decks.  The format has worked for MTG so I don't see why it wouldn't work here.  But why not just make this simpler by having a sideboard/tech tab where you can place 10-15 cards and build between rounds?
---
Sometimes people are far down a rabbit hole to innovate the wheel that they won't even acknowledge the simple solutions.
---
Oh it won't be every game. But it means that any control matchup is going to be a long series. 
---
&gt; Zombie Chow was a 2 of in every single Aggro deck while it was in Standard.
---
I don't really follow the meta or remember small trends very well, but I've been playing since just after release and I can't recall one aggro deck that used zombie chow and saw any success.
---
The closest I can think of is Warlock Zoo, but even then it wasn't common.
---
Even browsing popular decks on HearthPwn and I can't see anything aggro in the best rated decks containing Zombie Chow. It is all [Midrange and Control](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-contains-card=86712&amp;filter-deck-tag=1&amp;sort=-rating).
---
What decks are you referencing when you make this statement?
---
As a new player, this is exactly how i feel. When i can kill one big taget consistently, they pop thier entire deck as 1/1s, and I have to kill them because thier effects are so powerful, then swoop! ressed them all with thier original stats.. THREE TIMES IN A ROW! 
---
Some blizz fans drink enough koolaide where it becomes basically pointless having any kind of discussion with them
---
 How long can this go on
---
I'm at a point where i only log in once a month and play to get my monthly card back. Micro-achievements will help in keeping me playing longer for a while however after getting all the achievements i think i may go back to what i do currently. Its a very welcome addition that should have been in the game ever since. I loved how SC2 had tons of micro-achievements to do so i wonder why HS only had the golden portraits and a few hidden missions.
---
i've played against it a couple of times it can generate a lot of value with the battle cry card generation and Hagatha but I think it really lacks any true win condition.
---
I'd say its an interesting deck but not one you want to try grind ladder with. 
---
just fucking pay $20 and save gold for packs because its 10000x more efficient
---
Mtg is removing sideboards?
---
Quick question about those tournaments - I'm not sure I understand. So currently attendants would bring 4 decks, with one banned. Is this now saying that all attendants would only have 1 deck to play with the whole time, with just 3 variants of it? 
---
If that is true, how would that work? Would a finals just have two people playing the same two decks (with variants again) in a best of 3 or something?
---
Ingenuity at its be$t.
---
Yes, I was going to write the exact same thing. I was hoping this was going to be some sort of new format for me to play. 
---
Oh wow nobody has pointed this out yet
---
IM IN CHARRRRGGEE AGAIN 
---
Nah dude, you didn‚Äôt just get the cards if you buy adventure. You have to win them. And to do that you need to buy card packs. It‚Äôs pay to win in a paid game. This is supposed to be the thing that all gamers everywhere are supposed to be united against. Or something. 
---
MTGA is encouraging BO1 play.
---
Right now you can still make a Mechathun, Hakkar/Togwaggle, and Malygos lineup in this format.
---
Oh, China has a much, much larger population but Japan is considerably wealthier on average and especially in the demographics that tend to spend money on mobile games. It's also historically far more interested in mobile gaming and especially the mobile games that a serious money pits.
---
The population difference will tell over time of course. 
---
You can DE them for dust.
---
Complain about the dust for money exchange if you want, but you can't say they're worthless. If you think you're buying cards rather than dust with money you're thinking about it wrong.
---
Tinfoil hat seems to have fallen off this guy
---
The sooner you realize that the hearthstone system is predatory the sooner you can quit letting them rob you
---
So is Hearthstone just going to be releasing things a year after Eternal all the time now? 
---
I like it for the volleyball.
---
Yeahh, but fuck Mage, though.
---
Well, yeah.  You have have your standard version, Prince Liam version, and your Witches Cauldron version depending on what you need :)
---
I think the point is to make it simpler like MTG where you bring one deck and are expected to win with it.  However, using his format means there has to be a lot of player agency and ability to make meaningful tech choices.
---
It also doesn't affect the people manning the International Space Station or the population of white rhinos. So if it doesn't affect you... ignore it?
---
Not much of a sample size but I've played against it as Odd Paladin in ranks 2-4 a few times and lost.
---
Nevermind, just figured out what you meant. Ranked mode. I'm not to worried about that right now. As far as Zoo Warlock, I don't like playing that way, the whole rush down thing isn't very fun for me. If you have any recommendations for building a better control deck I'm all ears though.
---
In my case I don't usually watch streams, I see YouTube videos on how to get better, but I don't enter twitch generally
---
You're right, that's what I did, but I specifically mentioned F2P players.
---
No, but it briefly looked like they were trying to get away from them. Luckily, whether they saw the outrage or it was never a plan in the first place it seems they aren't getting rid of it just yet.
---
Though their newest tournament announcement didn't specifically say it's BO3 - so some are still skeptical. But most are banking on WOTC not being stupid enough to try and cater to BO1 more than BO3
---
Well, that is where reads on the meta comes in. If your opponents doesn't have good enough sideboards against your deck then you are looking at far better odds. It should also be noted that Bo5s is VERY rarely a thing in MTG. And that pre game 1 sideboarding is only really relevant when you know things that you really shouldn't. 
---
Why are you here
---
During this time you also play arena, have daily quests and special events though, which is more than enough to save up for 50-70 packs (even if you only average 4 wins) before the next expansion.
---
You can very easily get self sustaining if you never dust cards unless you have more than the playable amount and pick only a handful of meta decks to play when the dust settles around each expansion.
---
Wow, the specialist format is a janky as hell version of sideboarding. I guess when you're unable to update the engine in any way, shape or form this is all you can do.
---
Unless I missed something critical in the last few months, they aren‚Äôt working on a tournament mode since they announced a lack of plans to develop such a mode back in September. 
---
Yea I am quite ignorant, I barely played HOTS it just felt like LoL/DOTA lite to me. Companies can't really say they're closing down the esports scene soon because then nobody will sponsor it, nobody will invest. Projecting confidence is the only way to make money. They probably knew there was a chance it wasn't going to work out, but they cannot tell us that.
---
Of course thats scummy, but capitalism is scummy.
---
I've been playing since beta and have had at least 1 top tier deck at all times and I've only ever bought the welcome pack, and pre-ordered one expansion (boomsday). During that expansion I had like 3 top tier decks and the dust to craft a bunch of memes I liked.
---
thats not really something i care for, there is usually always only so many classes used in each meta for the most part. i think its more interesting to see what they can do with the sideboard decks as 2nd/3rd games can cause mind games with your opponent due to not knowing what changed between the players 
---
Of course Zombie Chow was in Standard. Standard is defined as the cards available to play in the Standard format. Yes, it existed before Rotation existed and was part of the first Rotation but that doesn't mean it never existed in Standard. 
---
As someone who played the shit out of Mech Mage, Zombie Chow was definitely in the deck. It was also in every aggro deck that used Undertaker. Face Hunter was not an aggro deck, it was a pure face deck, literally every card in the deck was designed to go face.  
---
&gt;Auto
---
Agreed... I watch a lot of TrumpSC and he's been playing a lot of autochess and kinda abandoned his hearthstone play which is very disappointing. I appreciate streamers trying to mix it up and bring new, arguably great, games to the forefront of Twitch but I believe they should do 50/50 of new games and what fans depend on them for. 
---
I can ensure (i feel you) you its not just frustrating for you. 
---
Thankfully Radiant Elementals and resurect spells rotate out soon.
---
Actually i cant even blame people for playing OTK or aggro decks to counter this BS.
---
Yeah, in Magic i feel like sideboarding works because some cards are very specialized with narrow use. In Hearthstone however, most cards are pretty straightforward, therefore sideboarding looks unnecessary apart from a few tech cards.
---
I'm new, how is sideboard different from what we already are playing?
---
It‚Äôs 2019 everybody is a social media expert. Toss a couple official tweets out, post something on Facebook, post something on Reddit and pay for a few hundred upvotes to get it started. Congrats you now qualify as a social media expert. 
---
I will ignore it, just like I'm going to ignore this game I used to spend $100s of dollars on and spend a lot of time playing.
---
Your argument is stupid and so are you.  We are on the Hearthstone subreddit because we all play and are invested into this game.  I am giving my opinion on what is called "a huge update" which does nothing for us.  Please make more sense when trying to argue.
---
Assuming each of these has a 256 player limit, and they are going to be single elimination, you get at least 1 pack for every bo3 that you win. With double elimination that's for every two wins, but a lot of people drop out as well. Big time reward farming opportunity.
---
Can someone ELI5 what sideboards are?
---
I totally forgot to include Smite in that category because it is a totally different game. HoTS is a really similar game to the big 2.
---
[Welcome to my life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/58a1zm/you_know_i_really_like_chogalls_battlecry_but/)
---
Oh good. You've built two standard decks, or a tier two modern deck.
---
It's a five mana 3/4
---
It didn't work because there wasn't enough counter tech. If this new set comes out wiht tons of counter tech as promised earlier, it could be more successful.
---
At least it's something.
---
Side board would be better
---
I remember how in my time people would play video games for fun. Not for the never-ending stream of praises and achievements.
---
Not like achievements aren't important, of course, but they aren't the cornerstone of video games. If the game isn't fun to play, then why even play it?
---
&gt;He needs direction.
---
No, he needs better cards.
---
I hate to use the defence, but it‚Äôs a card game, and let me tell you most CCG‚Äôs cost a hella lot more (per pack) than Hearthstone.
---
Wow, at the end of the rainbow I find that somebody else actually read through all that!
---
MTGA sideboarding is super smooth. The UI has a lot of areas to improve but Bo3 UX is not one of them.
---
That's not really how things work though. The texture guy isn't going to be doing anything related to that kind of thing. Unless they just fired some of those guys because the game wasn't doing as well as expected (very possible), it doesn't make much sense.
---
Besides content, but we were talking about poor quality cosmetics, not a lack of content.
---
Except with those 2 standard decks, I can go to FNM and get packs. Or GP and get packs.
---
And then resell it for 50-80% of what I paid for it.
---
Please don't tell me how magic works. I only played it for 15 years. Thanks. 
---
They can't even do sideboards right lmao
---
Ah got it, thanks!
---
Destroy all minions except shrines.  Then diacard your hand.  Oh wait shrines are minions, now destroy them.
---
MTGA gang member here, we are having our own issues with WotC at the moment making a ridiculous format for competitive play instead of just using the sideboard (WHICH WORKS FANTASTICALLY IN THE CLIENT)
---
rogue, mage, warrior and druid all sound reasonably fun. I can't say I've tried 4 different ones yet this week or the last.
---
Eternal Servitude is 4 mana and no minion but I guess it's still considered worse since it lets you discover the minion and Bishop is random?  
---
*Plays Whizbang The Wonderful*
---
Blizzard- ‚ÄúHey u cant do th-...‚Äù
---
Good.
---
I mean I think that managing your graveyard gives games another level of complexity, and in certain decks polymorph effects provide a counterplay. At the same time, I also find that priest resurrect and Warlock DK are absolutely infuriating to play against. Mana cheating effects like resurrect (which is really what the mechanic is at its core) are very highrolly and unfun to play against. Moreover, I think that the disparity between classes that have transform effects and those that don't is also problematic. For instance, odd warrior currently runs tinkmaster simply because they need a transform effect.
---
 " ...you are just out to take my money by exploiting psychological tactics similar to gamblin" That is correct and what i hate. In every kind of way. The passion was left behind, the loved community was left behind. Blizzcon this year felt not like a big family, that time has end. Immortal will be the first Blizzard game which I wont ever touch. That tells enough.
---
&gt; denying
---
By not mentioning it even once, and providing the "new" format as a fresh idea. Yes.
---
Spiteful Priest never needed it and neither did the dragon priest I first ran when I started.  
---
Neither deck seemed so bullshit as the resurrect mechanic.  
---
Guess I'll grind then, like I said; I've been winning a lot in casual with this deck.
---
i think that is not allowed
---
Damn, nice prediction
---
‚ÄúIf hearthstone used to be your main game and it isn‚Äôt any more, what would bring you back?‚Äù
---
Not this.
---
Just so you know, a huge expansion for Magic is coming out in April. I firmly believe WotC is out for blood against Hearthstone and I have no doubt Hasbor/WotC is going to kick Blizz while they are down. The next expansion is going to be a climatic end to a long story line and I think it will blow a lot of people away. 
---
It was so irresponsible, pro teams like Team Liquid even announced their full rosters and guys who played through grueling qualifiers were left in the cold. 
---
There already are hearth players like this: zetalot, fibonacci, mr yargut. it hurts them in old tournament formats so this will be a refreshing change there I think.
---
Nothing against the guy, but I just can't stand his delivery. 
---
In MTG, we have about 35-40 non mana cards, and a 15 card sideboard. So we can replace about 40% of our deck.
---
This sideboard is about 16%. So yeah, would agree with you and argue it‚Äôs not enough optionality to warrant the confusion or options LHS provides. At the very least, think should be 10 card sideboard.
---
Why would the sideboard format matter (kinda a noob sorry)
---
It thins your deck tho
---
I see your point but when the resummon effect is discover based or summons so many minions at once even the interruption of transform isn't really that much of a hindrance as it should be.   
---
Also I wonder if they thought it through with resummon mechanics and the 1/1 copy cards where the resummon brings back the original minion instead of the 1/1 that died.  
---
I feel it should be the 1/1 that gets resurrected as that was what the minion was and it wouldn't also bring back a 2/24 enforcer since that was a 2/12 to begin with.  
---
Maybe they always intended for people to summon 1/1's and bring them back as full strength? If they didn't I fail to see how they didn't see that happening in designing the cards as it's a massive oversight.  
---
 
---
Outstanding move! 
---
I have enough MtG experience; you‚Äôre correct, everything is better than standard duo. WotC is better off just using this format if they still refuse to do Bo3.
---
Feel free to offer suggestions and how that is working well for you?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that they moved on that changed things, I think people moved on because things changed. I think the problem is Blizzard wanted Jeff Kaplan and Co. to recreate WoW‚Äôs success in a new, fresh franchise (Project Titan) and all the leaders of the WoW team since just haven‚Äôt had the same game knowledge or passion as they did. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence the game‚Äôs player base saw a permanent decline after the shift in staffing.
---
This is some convoluted bull shit. 
---
Each of the games in a bo3 match could end in 10 turns.
---
&gt; why would rewards scale? 
---
Because you're playing essentially 2-3 games instead of 1. 
---
Do you really took the hypothetical "bo3" change in vacuum an only exert the increased number of games from it? It doesn't helps the argument nor works like that on practice.
---
Stags are known to be part of druid. You have to think about the themes of the classes. Beasts are druid. Changing beasts are druid
---
 If genn and baku are only for 2 classes then they wouldnt be as good as they are. Those classes wouldnt even use them since you want to take them out of the classes they are. Its like restricting mechathun to rogue. Or hakkar to druid or cthun to mage. They are neutral legendaries for a reason. I like the idea of nerfing them but i have no idea how you would do that besides changing the hero powers. 
---
The hero power changes that i would think of is
---
Pala odd: summon 1 2/2
---
Mage: odd: deal 2 damage randomly to your opponents board
---
Warrior: odd 3 armor
---
Rogues is fine
---
Warlock 1 mana tap is already a downside since the life drain. But its a problem because of the 4 4/4 demon that gets +3/+3 when below 15 hp. 
---
Odd hunter isnt that great
---
Lol look at all the wannabe police in this thread.  
---
Probably not the right place to post this due to sub rules and yes the account can get deleted if Blizzard catch on. There are plenty of places on the net facilitating player to player account sales though and looking at the share volume there is I'd say Blizzard aren't overly concerned about this practice enough to strictly police it.  
---
Team 5 has verified that they have taken ideas from /r/customhearthstone.
---
I'm not sure why you're giving Dinosize as an example. I climbed legend with even paladin this month with a 71-46 record and I can say that Dinosize is one of the best cards you can put in the high drop slot. You'll always have a dude around, and that means it's direct damage or great board control. Not to mention if you somehow manage to Dinosize a Corpsetaker/Harpy it's basically game over.
---
The reality is buffing interesting cards that are absolutely garbage because of stats/cost would do as much to shake up the meta as the 4-5 nerfs they do every few months. But they actively avoid that due to either lost profits or laziness.
---
It takes a LOT before you buff cards like Holomancer to Arena Patron to KFT/KNC power levels.
---
Literally awesome line
---
spaghetti dinner for a spaghetti coder
---
that feeling when you queue into a ranked game but then you have to leave and do something
---
This is why I keep saying it. It's great Iksar is finally engaging the community... but its soooo freaking too late. They should have been on the horn with us months ago. Hell, maybe a year ago.
---
It really feels like there are two camps in Blizz HQ right now trying to bring back hearthstone to its prime, but neither is talking to each other and so it just makes the other camp seem like they are doing something at the worst possible time.
---
I quit playing and caring for HS, stopped watching Amaz, Toast and Savjiz. 
---
But kept watching Kibler. Even though I dont like HS anymore, him playing it is still entertaining somehow. Maybe because he can play all those interesting brewed decks a normal low spender low time investing player like me cant afford. Also Shiro.
---
But Since MtGA hooked Savjiz and Amaz, I started to watch them again, and with Autochess I went back to watch all my former HS streamer (Amaz, Dog, Savjiz) again - well, all except for Toast :(
---
Blizzard corporate culture would've ruined osfrog should they get him. His condition was rumored to include the fact that he will be given free reign to design and balance the game with him as the ultimate authority, and would answer to no management. Blizzard couldn't have given him that, but valve could. 
---
In fact, considering their corporate culture, osfrog and blizzard was never destined to be. And I'm glad it was that way. 
---
It wasn't a blizzard run tournament, was it?
---
&gt; tournaments arent for casual players
---
... Yes they are. FNM is a tournament and casuals FUCKING LOVE FNM. 
---
Lol, the irony of MTG moving to Multi Deck and Bo1 formats while Hearthstone moves to weird sideboarding is hilarious....
---
I will take a look.
---
Found the alt Mike Donais account XD
---
no but seriously. you are defending blizz with outdated stats. Like seriously, where have you been for the last 6 months? Shit is going down, and it really doesn't look good for blizz (at the moment). Yes, they are trying to bring changes... but it really does feel like this change shouldn't really be the "priority". Now mind you this is just because champions is coming up, so no matter when they announced it, it would have this effect. But I think many people are frustrated because this game has been out for 5 years and very little has changed in terms of the core game. Tavern Brawl and Rotation. That's it. And yet we lost Adventures, so we are at a +1 for "new features"
---
Would you prefer sniping specific cards for a set amount of gold/$?
---
Or just play MTG arena and stop funneling money into blizzavision.
---
lol 20 packs.
---
Hey you won and wasted your whole week. Here's $30. 
---
I‚Äôm really not that well versed into other card games. This format seemed a little convoluted and everyone is talking about sideboards. Could someone explain it to me please?
---
RainbowJack#1345 NA 80g.  You go first please.
---
damn. i stand corrected...but that makes the point even more. 
---
Thank you for the kind offer. Maybe one day. These days, I think I am getting far enogh into the old man territory that I am OK just standing on the sidelines, remembering the sweetness of the past and watching those that made it over the hapiness line and the new folks doing it all over again.
---
&gt;  Stags are known to be part of druid. You have to think about the themes of the classes. Beasts are druid. Changing beasts are druid
---
You're right.  I edited my previous Stag suggestion.  
---
I'm not dead-set on any particular changes to the odd/even class cards.  The point is, there are only four of them, not 40.  They are not an obstacle to restricting Genn and Baku.
---
&gt; If genn and baku are only for 2 classes then they wouldnt be as good as they are. 
---
Yeah, that's the goal.
---
&gt; Those classes wouldnt even use them since you want to take them out of the classes they are.
---
I wouldn't put them in classes where they are totally useless, like Baku in Shaman.
---
&gt; They are neutral legendaries for a reason. 
---
That reason is "Blizzard made a mistake".
---
Ever since those money hungry assholes at activision joined Blizzard it all went wrong.
---
