No, no no they are off limits!!!!! They had nothing to do with this!!!! Don’t threaten someone just because they still play blizzards games.
---

---
Mods lock this shit!
---
---
---
It would be nice if someone in Blizzard PR actually explained this to us mere peasants.
---
If you think that somebody here in the US has any control over the Blizzard Weibo account, then you need to get your head checked.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Blizzard-Taiwan is obviously in China's pocket and is running around ruining Blizzard's name while the community eats it up and even helps them do it.
---
Of course it does, but, just like with the overwhelming majority of these type of things, it won't.
---
This community dumb as shit!
---
Wait so do you or do you not want blizzard to punish people?

Looking at stock prices is a pretty good indicator in real time of what’s REALLY happening. While ActivisionBlizzards stock took a 4% hit on the news, most of that loss has been made up already. That tells me people with deep connections to Blizzard are either really out of touch or they don’t think this is going to have any significant impact on earnings.
---
For me this isn't a "It'll blow over" thing. I'm actually done. I have banned Activision, Blizzard, and Tencent from my PC. 
---
Then when they apologized to Beijing this got added to my list of Psychotic Fucking Hatreds.
---
Ah yes, the time when slavery was legal and EVERY AMERICAN OWNED SLAVES
---
Except no, they ducked under the table.
---
It’s called sparkles - Feb 2018 card back.
---
I think the Blizzard mods misunderstood.  It's pretty simple, just ask them to screenshot the modlog and it will say if Admins took action though.  It seems like people are prematurely raising pitchforks to me.
---
We will protest at Blizzcon too. Blizzcon will be another fail :)
---
Their stocks are dropping and we will make sure it continues to.
---
You're underselling it. Mike Donais regularly posts here and he's the damn lead designer. Brode before him. Those are big deals that the leads of such a huge game would interact on an unofficial forum. I remember Ben saying in 2016 they look to this sub more for input than they do the official forums. 
---
It's nice to have their opinion show up from time to time and also nice to know they've not tried to influence how this sub is acting in light of the controversy. That's not how it is on all gaming subs (coughleagueoflegendscough).
---
Nah you won't get people to stop, and you can't make anyone stop, and you know that and are complaining anyway to see if your opinion is validated.
---
It isn't.
---
A decently large portion of the player base is quitting the game. I thought it'd be smaller but there's actually a lot of players (whales included) leaving the game. Not going to kill the game, but certainly not helpful considering the playerbase has been dropping for a while now.
---
Also, there's definitely NOT "hundreds of millions of players each month". Wikipedia cites 37 millions, and that was over a year ago, so I wouldn't be surprised if the actual current number was smaller.
---
When an employee screws up really badly, he loses his job.  
---
When a leader screws up really badly, losing his job is how the company shows they hold themselves accountable.  
---
The leader not losing his job shows they don't care.   Customers can react accordingly.
---
That would be you, yes.
---
&gt; this reminds me a lot of football players kneeling during the national anthem and being called unpatriotic
---
Hmm, that sucks how they were fired for having an opinion.
---
This. Fuck Blizzard, I will never buy another product from them. I hope Blizzcon gets wrecked by protesters.
---
Context in the comments of op
---
Hmmm
---
Oh I didnt realize you were going to leave your mothers basement and go to blizcon in that case please continue
---
r/facepalm
---
The Winnie the Pooh masks must be expensive, none are made in China, lol.
---
they already have your money, they don't give a shit.
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Because I think the outrage is ridiculous and don't have much interest in the circlejerk of keyboard warriors.  Pretty simple.  
---
Best part is that in the end, I'll be right.  While everyone else is desperately trying to stoke the fading rage, I just have to play hearthstone and wait.  This week's tavern brawl is fun.
---
What if you were already f2p?
---
I heard a rumor there was to be an all-employee announcement meeting today or tomorrow on this subject. I bet we won’t hear anything more publicly until that happens (which is the right thing to do imho)
---
Nobody deserves bondage. Wtf.
---
Pressuring streamers and influences to make statements is fine.
---
But do *not* paint targets on them. It is very easy to, from our positions, ask others to endanger their livelihoods. That is a big ask. They are not to blame.
---
The difference is, what you just said is the individual choosing to censor content for themselves, instead of the government censoring the content for them.
---
Why I can’t check multiple boxes?
---
They are too busy shitting bricks trying to figure out how to un-fuck the mess Blizzard-Taiwan put in their lap.
---
I won't, but many will. We dress up at Winnie the pooh and heckle during the Q&amp;A. It will be glorious.
---
Someone give this man a medal, I'm broke. I just bought my mask from amazon.
---
Rich and stupid if you get another one lmao
---
Bobby Kotick in a Blizzsuit.
---
Hi all. I do some volunteer work for a human rights agency that's been working with some individuals in HK to help out. I am curious what members of this community have done. A common problem with issues like this is people discuss their outrage, maybe even boycott a company, but do little else. I would like to get a sense for what members of r/hearthstone have done. Thank you
---
Depends if China is giving him condo deals at the time like they were last year.
---
Oh yeah that right you're probably allergic to being outside, you know from being a reddit goblin 24/7 my bad
---
And on top of that those boycotting are using devices made in full or in part in China, and buying other products made in China
---
&gt;  almost got banned from the Overwatch League for posting a pepe 
---
(kek)
---
Kind of like r/The_Duchebag but Chinese
---
lol.  wow.  the naivety here is quite astounding.
---
It's been kind of fun to see these Hearthstone kids mature over the years, from impulsive teenagers to thoughtful adults.
---
Still, this is a good example of the ignorance rampant in this whole mess.  So many people understand so little of what is actually going on and just want to get mad and jump on the anti-blizzard bandwagon.
---
I fear (but expect) the outrage will die out and people will feel fulfilled after some sort of punishment is given to blizzard. Once that's done, everyone will go back to their lives and forget that Hong Kong is still protesting for their rights.
---
This is the information ive been looking for, what part of the GDPR specifically refers to proof of identity? Because if its left to blizzards discretion in the very near future i see them asking for birth certificate, proof of residence, and a family members information to confirm proof of identity. And what exactly is to stop them from doing so?
---
Edit: ah, here we go. https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-verify-identity-of-data-subjects-for-dsars-under-the-gdpr/
---
Some interesting excerpts;
---
"How can I be penalized for doing my best to authenticate the data subjects?
---
Basically, if you make it too difficult for the data subjects to exercise their rights, by creating for them unreasonable and disproportionate requirements, you will in fact infringe the very basic rights of the data subjects. This way, you risk the highest administrative fines, that is up to 20,000,000 euros, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 percent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
---
It is highly recommended that you do not obtain clearly more sensitive or potentially more harmful data, for the purpose of authentication, than the data that is subject to the request. If you actually need some additional information, it should be the minimum amount and only what is relevant in the given context. This is important not only because of the principle of data minimization, but also to ensure purpose limitation and fairness.  
---
Accordingly, the highest administrative fines, as provided by the GDPR, may fall upon you."
---
And:
---
"What should be specifically avoided?
---
Asking for a copy of ID document, passport or other official, government-issued document, such as a birth certificate, as a standard way of verifying the identity of data subjects should be definitely avoided.
---
The obvious reason why is because it is disproportionate and not always relevant. The less obvious reason is that this is not considered a secure and efficient method of authentication, and the level of assurance as to the real identity of a person, in contrast to what some might think, is quite low. 
---
Authentication in an online environment is widely disputed, and most people will tell you that you should not use the information that basically stays the same for all your life or for a long period of time, such as Social Security numbers or government issued identifiers, as it is likely that such data may already be in possession of unauthorized persons, simply because they exist for a long time. Also, if this would be a prevalent practice, many companies would be, and sometimes already are, in possession of such information, and they very often fall pray to breaches and hacker attacks.
---
Last but not least, by collecting such information, you will create additional risks for data subjects, as such data may be used, for identity theft or fraud, for example, and you will need to protect it with higher security measures than for the innocuous data that is subject to the request itself, e.g., history of purchased items or the like. Quite likely you would need, under the GDPR, to conduct the data protection impact assessment before implementing such method of authentication."
---
Not only HK but also many ethnic minorities..
---
And the point is not blindly hating on Blizzard...
---
The point is hating people who do not support this gracious, awesome movement in Hong Kong
---
Why support the Goliath, when they're clearly wrong?...
---
Blizzard is not getting 'harassed'. They made a choice and they got fair repercussions for it..
---
Our brothers and sister in Hong Kong cannot be silenced. Democracy HAS to win...
---
In addition, the mainland might see some of this and start their own protests, which would probably happen in some cases but not blow up....
---
Anyway, the point is.....
---
We have to stand up against China and stand for Hong Kong, Blizzard not supporting human rights and free speech is appalling, and their fanbase rightfully finds it so....
---
If you don't want to personally delete your account, that's fine, no-one's forcing you, their games are addictive, i'll give them that.
---
But you cannot deny what they're doing for money is immoral.
---
I do understand there's rules about keeping politics out of the streams and whatnot, but taking the prize money away, the banning and apology to China?????
---
Yeah, nah. Screw this company.
---
Grunde Almeland is a man. *The* man if you will.
---
I bet the blizzard name will cease to exist
---
You can still enjoy your old NON SUB blizzard games (everything pre 2010).  
---
EVERY SINGLE 'recurring profit" GAME can suck our collective dicks. And *every* new release.
---
The way this whole thing has blown up puts paid to your claims.
---
The stock is way down from it’s high last year
---
Grunde Almeland, venstre.
---
Is there a none option?
---
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
---
lmao if trump tariffed this
---
I did not open HS since this happened, trying to have good times in the new Mario Kart
---
Influencers, stooges, vetting, censoring, hiding player counts... It's all just one big flimsy deception. Anything to avoid facing reality.
---
37,000,000 players each month is still a huuuuuuuge amount. Maybe 1% of people will actually fully quit playing blizzard games from this
---
Decklist?
---
I love that Blizzard's response to people revolting over someone being handed a wildly over-the-top punishment is to *ban them for a thousand years*
---
Call me neckbeard all you want. At least I don't support money over human rights. FUCK BLIZZARD.
---
I thought the dollar signs were pretty explicit.  With no context, I would agree with you.
---
I'd have so much more respect for these if I just saw one that wasn't using a referral link.
---
A Person is smart, People are dumb, ignorant masses.
---
Good point, I guess you are "going (to continue to be) f2p".
---
That was supposed to be the answer for people who are going to play but not spend.
---
Think of it like the joke, I used to like Mitch Hedberg. I still do but I used to too.
---
You are a disgusting human. Truthfully. You probably don't stand for anything and you distract reality with constantly playing hearthstone. Pretty obvious from your response. 
---
Here's a real reality check : peoples livelihoods are more important than you sitting at your computer and playing a game. When you finally wake up and start taking a stand, you'll understand.
---
Just reading this message should tell everyone how delusional you really are. Are you currently wearing a tinfoil hat so that we can't read your brain and such? If not, you should really get on that. 
---
Also, Trump is a reptile that is being controlled by Chinese aliens.
---
I once sold my ferrari for more amazon points.  I feel you bros
---
If that was the cases they could have literally immediately come out and said:
---
"Sorry guys, local blizzard fucked up, they were too harsh", and rolled back part of the punishment.
---
Besides, we're talking about withholding 10k Dollars from a guy. That decision was definitely not made without the involvement of the parent company in the US.
---
Blizzard Taiwan is still a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. And Activision Blizzard has complete sway over them.
---
You do realize I am just wasting your time so you stop spamming this sub with shit right?
---
Boycott Blizzcon or everyone that goes, have a T-shirt that backs HK or says fuck China =) so any video's or pic of people  will make China mad =)
---
Currently you’re oversea or accessing VPN?
---
They banned me on the forums without any explanation.  
---
Fuck Blizzard and fuck China!
---
I'm going to change my username to alter geo-political relations

LOL
---
Downvoted for speaking the truth. This timeline is truly the darkest
---
lol
---
I can assign from mobile. Fair rule, should stay active. Bad redditor imo
---
Thanks!
---
Lol Trump has been harder on China than any President in the last 40 years, plus openly criticized NBA figures like Steve Kerr who are constantly talking about the need to speak about important political issues yet issued a “No Comment” when asked directly about the HK/China situation.
---
Get a clue. “LoL tRuMp BaD”
---
there is a screenshot posted by a mod somewhere in that tread bro its not a misunderstanding. i get you are just fact checking but this is real my friend. go search through the comments.                                       "This submission was not removed by any of our moderators. This image was removed by Reddit. The Reddit Admins has terminated their account. Please do not contact us about it.

Before or after praising Xi for becoming president for life?

---
\#FUCK the NBA.  No 2nd chances with freedom.
---
Be careful because stuff like this casts a bad light on the protest,
---
Well you just responded with that comment, so you obviously had some idea to respond and to which you did.
---
That's because the US-based blizzard did not punish Blitzchung, Blizzard-TAIWAN did.
---
This is wrong. Talk to them. Do NOT target them.
---
It's not like we didn't know it was political since the beginning, but "glad" to see a confirmation.
---
honk kong mei cosplays plz!!!!

Pls get help dude!
---
The meme has come true. This sub has truly become r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
an account with data in it is still an account with data in it. this accomplishes the same as just not paying for a sub.
---
bro you just posted cringe -500 credit points gl trying to use the subway now
---
[removed]
---
Yeah man - same. I only make mention of it because one of my law professors worked a lot with the SEC and explained (off-handedly) how a market makers job is to essentially “manage” the market by only allowing so many purchases to occur at any given time. So the stock market is supposed to be organic, but there’s a lot of artificiality behind it (which is why it’s so closely regulated). If I knew more I’d share more!
---
Trump's already Russia's bitch but I'm sure he's not against taking a little Chinese side action....if ya know what I mean ;)
---
It's been too long for any change in message to have any semblance of sincerity, they've already lost "the west" and have pretty much no choice but join the "PALS FOR LIFE" and stick to the plan, chums.
---
Since you're speaking from a brand new account, I can't tell if it is you guys, but if it is, you have my respect. 
---
What you guys did was both ingenious and courageous. With a business model such as Hearthstone's, streams are a major part of their free advertisement, and I applaud you for throwing a wrench into those works. I can only hope that other popular streamers and casters follow your example. 
---
#FreeHK #BoycottBlizzard
---
their greed is no different than blizzards. in the end, i wont care anyways bc i wont be watching nor will i watch them on any other future projects.
---
Investor's are not going to panic unless they see real numbers. Analysts are saying hold for now while few argue that the incident could lead to a corporate culture crisis that could tear them apart internally.  Investors know Act-Blizz still has a lot of potential to grow in the Chinese market. If they see signs the brand is falling part and it affects their bottom line, then they will start bailing.
---
The difficulty with the Diablo mobile game is that it's taking a PC hardcore genre and aiming it towards a different audience.
---
"Hey we're hyped to show you this game that's aimed at none of you. Give us a round of applause."
---
Offensive? Really?
---
Aw, did it hurt your feelings? I guess you can talk to mainland China and share stories of being offended.
---
Gimme the option to buy a charity hero portrait to support a human right organization representing Hong Kong and my interested is piqued.
---
Hearthstone streamers have more backbone than the NBA and its players/ leaders, Disney, Apple, blizzard, and vans shoes (etc.).
---
I've uninstalled hearthstone. After 5 + years and 1000 of dollars. It's the least I can do to stand with Hong Kong. My heart breaks for those fighting for freedom. Stay strong community, we must vote with out wallets
---
Oof. Respect
---
[Deleted] Means the user deleted it.
---
[Removed] means the mods removed it.
---
Admin actions say something different but I don't remember what. It's something like [Removed by Reddit for &lt;Reason&gt;]
---
This was not removed by Reddit but by the *user themselves.*
---
This is pure hysteria nonsense.
---
That was a stupid overreaction by the community, I have ZERO problem with the comment and the people who did were dumb keyboard commandos. This is nothing like that and the parallel is dumb. Stick to what is going on now, trying to drag up old things that weren't worth the attention they got will just allow them to distract from the issue they really need to defend themselves on
---
Upvoting these threads helps?
---
*cough* Panama papers
---
Obviously Blizzard is committing tactical suicide in order to bring about this awareness and shift in perspective. /s
---
Dude literally every single country in existence shits on their own people and we trade with ALL OF THEM
---
Man, I wish I had tickets. So much fun to have.
---
Print this on the shirts
---
Yeah I know it's a joke but this, in this climate.. I don't like it.
---
To be fair. Y’all are parakeets.
---
None of you gave a rat’s ass about the Uyghur Genocide.
---
It is highly suspect that this will make beyond a minor dent a Blizzcon.
---
Maintaining high energy for a long time is exhausting. 
---
It would make more sense to be methodical, have a plan, and then make a statement at blizzcon
---
I don't think you know what the word communism means. There is a difference between communism and the actions of communist regime. Although they are usually non-mutually exclusive you could theoretically have communism without the totalitarianist aspect.
---
RIP that dude from Grandmasters.
---
China is extremely oppressive about how it can be represented by companies doing business there. Anything outside of completely falling in line with the CCP is not tolerated, and would have resulted in retaliation against Bli$$ard. Chinese censorship of Western products in the West is quickly becoming pandemic (see https://caffeine-overload.github.io/bandinchina/ for a long list of companies curtailing to CCP demands).
---
Blizzard has not and will not apologize for this incident because it would jeopardize their relationship with the CCP and by extension their ability to do business in the Chinese market. This affects not only new products (i.e. Diablo Immortal) but also existing products, including WoW.
---
In short, Blizzard had to chose between appeasing the CCP and appeasing the West, and chose the CCP. Blizzard took a gamble that the inevitable backlash from their actions against Blitzchung would take the standard form of most "gamer activism", and would follow the trend of an intense but short burn of outrage that dies out and ultimately doesn't result in much long-term revenue loss. We will have to see whether the recent outrage can manifest into any long-term repercussions.
---
Thank you. I encourage everyone to support your favorite streamers that boycott Blizzard products and stream other games. After all, half the reason for watching is for their unique personalities and reactions to different games
---
Wouldn't it be funny if everyone who bought a blizzcon ticket just decided to not show up.
---
Off topic, but really just want to say that between HOMM3 and MechComnander, we clearly would be gaming buddies.
---
I knew something was about to come up when you guys were fist bumping minutes before you held up the sign. Kudos to you guys!
---
Maybe Kibler told his mods he doesn't want any HK spam. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
So all of this harsh punishment being rained down on his head is only because of the rules you say? Let's look at [Blizzard's statement](https://i.imgur.com/O74OdtS.jpg) on the matter. In essence "We object to the expression of political beliefs on our platform. Glory to China!" Oh yeah, it's totally about Blizzard trying to be impartial and not at all about them picking a side. 
---
Liberal America... uh yeah? America was founded on Liberalism. In fact the revolution DEFINED Liberalism. What you were doing in that statement was trying to make a slight against Progressivism, i.e. the Democrats, but you're too poorly educated on the fundamentals of political science to understand that both political parties are Liberal. Granted Neo-liberal in the case of Republicans and most Democrats, but still Liberal.
---
So they should just ignore things? And everything will be fine? U can't possibly be serious. That's not how things work. Do u think the Chinese government will just ignore a company supporting HK?
---
Remember they let him speak they didn't stop him. But idk why they should ignore it when he's doing something that's against the rules.
---
Giving everyone a voice doesn't mean they should endorse everyone's opinions. And that doesn't mean the tournament should become a place to discuss politics.
---
What if a neo Nazi came and spoke about how Hitler did nothing wrong? Should they just ignore him too? And not punish him for breaking the rules? Should they not make a statement that they don't support neonazi ideology? What if a Chinese came and said HK should t be free? Who do they agree with? 
---
And again even if he won HE BROKE THE RULES!!!  WTF HOW CAN U NOT UNDERSTAND THAT? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT. IT'S A FUCKING RULE YOU BREAK IT U GET THE PUNISHMENT. NO MATTER IF HIS CAUSE IS JUST OR NOT RULES ARE RULES. 
---
they weren't in a position to do something right. it's a 2 sided conflict what is right for you is not right for the other side and u shouldn't force a company to decide which is right. It's not a simple issue and that why it should stay away from a video game tournament and be discussed with care in an appropriate environment.
---
I’m Xcelsior, one of the other players from AU. This message is indeed from us.
---
Hey they can play hearthstone cant they
---
U so right
---
The Japanese currency? Can you get packs cheaper that way?
---
Take another look at what the channel moderator said about it.
---
I came here to post this. I'm a whale and have played hearthstone since day 1. Played Overwatch since beta. I'm certainly not an esports competitor, but I have bought a lot from Blizzard since the very first Warcraft. 
---
**I'm not buying anything from Blizzard until they come out and officially acknowledge that western values and freedoms and CUSTOMERS are more important than Chinese government censors.**
---
It's them alright. One of the guys retweeted this statement.
---
He can get other esports jobs by continuing to gain experience in hs esports
---
It's a drastic and sudden change. People have been building up their careers for years on hearthstone, something that they're a fan of for a very very long time.
---
It's hard to deal with that whether you decide to keep going or quit.
---
That's fucking admirable
---
With the Tracer pose drama it was about a week before they posted a reply about it. They may do the same here.
---

---
This made me curious so I did a cursory search.
---
[38.8% (6,332,000) of U.S. servicemen and all servicewomen were volunteers between 1941 and 1945.](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers)
---
So, not most.  The majority of service members were drafted.  Even so, volunteering in 1941 was a pretty sweet deal.  Coming out of the Depression, it was the best option for tons of people.  Not exactly a selfless sacrifice for democracy.
---
That would definitely be something tangible. I have already severed ties but it would certainly make me feel better about the willingly ignorant.
---
Wish Admirable did this too
---
But is he still going to play blizz games on stream?
---
Then why is making fun of supporting Hong Kong still allowed in Kibler's chat?
---
This is reddit and you KNOW what everyone was praying and chanting....
---
*PLEASE don't be pornhub!*
---
Ah shoot sorry. Yuan.
---
Just wait. Anything interesting's going to be on youtube in no time.
---
He's wrong. It was not removed by Reddit and the user account was not removed by reddit.
---
/u/laylow_lofi's account says "This user has deleted their account." A banner user's page says "This user is suspended."
---
I dont like it when anyone makes a mockery to anyone flag. Thats someone country show some respect. Issues are one thing common decency another
---
So many companies you probably buy from do. Like Disney and Apple.
---
Yes, this shit was originated from China. Historically it was written in the laws of every dynasty, basically something like one person commit a crime then their family/friends would also get slaughtered. I think the cultural influence has persisted until nowadays and has an impact on how Chinese people process their logics.
---
What is it you believe in then? You believe in totalitarianism views? That no matter HOW BAD IT GETS YOU LISTEN TO THE RULES! Fucking sit the fuck down, enjoy your shit we give you.. and if you don't? You lose shit that you worked for.
---
Fucking awesome man! Sign me right up. Actually that sounds so good maybe i'll move to Hong Kong. Wanna come be my roommate for a bit to see how awesome it is? 
---
You are an awesome floor mat.
---
Same, I wanted to check out the event but I just got annoyed after logging in. Been playing since beta.
---
Don't you guys have human rights?
---
what happens if you change it to #fuckyoublizz
---
We are so very proud of all three of you and you did the right thing. Thank you so much!
---
Never thought they'd top last year's debacle, but they managed it before it even started
---
Way to be racist
---
"Dont you guys have a shred of decency?" Would be my response.
---
Are you on mobile? Have you allowed all background data to be downloaded?
---
Now is always the time to be Woke because tomorrow may be too late and yesterday has already passed.
---
People can’t reverse what they’ce ignored or were ignorant to, but they can push to prevent a toxic future.
---
The best answer was
---
"Hey blizz, you wanna get fucked in the ass"?
---
"No"
---
"Why not? Dont you guys have buttholes?"
---
Oddly, I couldn't find any mention of who asked him to remove the tweet. Presumably Blizzard, but no actual statement to that effect.
---
Boycott blizzcon, nothing speaks louder than the silence of empty chairs.
---
how is the skin colour an issue at all? Am I missing something or are you just talking from your rear?
---
EA learned. Will these?
---
I thought this was a serious list until I realized Epic was one of the only two companies that supposedly wouldn't censor you. As I understand it, Tencent (a gigantic Chinese company) owns more than 40% of Epic and relationships exactly like this are what China uses to leverage companies like Blizzard, which Tencent only owns 5% of, into doing what they want. I'd also point out that Tencent is also featured in this list as a company that might censor you.  
---
Yeah, the CEO of Epic didn't miss the opportunity to take easy pot-shots at Blizzard, saying Epic would never do what they did. But are we really supposed to believe Tim Sweeney, a man who's gained some measure of notoriety for lying to and generally bullshitting consumers about his company?
---
I believe that you don't go to an event like that to push your political views. Plain and simple. 
---
Don't like it? Fuck right off and hop back onto that bandwagon. Also, stop telling people they can/can't support Blizzard/continue playing their games. 
---
Like I said, you have no moral highground here. 
---
Now begone.
---
This is how the power of many has slowly eroded
---
Don't forget Weibo is watched by the CCP closer than a helicopter parent stalks their 18yo kid once they go to college and leave home for the first time.
---
All of this is either propaganda, brainwashing, and/or if they don't, their social score goes down along with their organ count.
---
Agree completely. Their only hope is to pull a "duck and cover and hope this all blows over as people get outraged by a new thing" strategy. 
---
We simply cannot let that happen or their cruel gamble will have worked.
---
If China could punish the people watching the broadcasting, they would in a heartbeat.
---
&gt; That was a stupid overreaction by the community
---
Exactly.  It was a joke response to an honestly stupid question.  "Are you guys going to port Diablo: Immortal to PC?"  Uuh, What?  Diablo: immortal is us porting Diablo 3 to Mobile.  We already HAVE Diablo 3 on PC. Plus, why would you want a game designed for Mobile on your PC? Do you guys not have phones or something?"
---
Everyone acts like "Do you guys not have phones" was their response to the outrage surrounding Diablo Immortal.  It was Not.  It was a resp9onse to the question "Are you going to port Diablo: Immortal to PC", to which the response "Why, do you not have a phone?" is a perfectly logical and humerus response. that hte community took WAY out of context.
---
And yet the community gets pissed when developers give super political and non-committal responses to questions.

It feels as if its a troll but it's just real enough that if anyone tries to take the bait and make fun or try and tell him not to play he'll pretend it's real and get upset.
---
I'm not asking them to openly condemn China. I just think his punishment was too much. Disqualifying him from this tourney and stripping his winnings is harsh but understandable. Banning him for a year? That's really harsh. In esports, that could be enough to force him to retire.
---
I'd be happy if they only banned him from this and the next tourney. That's still a pretty harsh punishment, and it gets the message across.

hey there, call me bot or whatever, or ignorance if you wish,
---
i'm listing a few stuff 
---
**Spain**: [Puigdemont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont) overwhelmingly winning a referendum, then got charged and forced to leave the country, it's been four years.
---
**France**: [Benalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benalla_affair) , president's bodyguard, hitting yellow vest protestors, having contract with russian oligarch, possesses gun illegally, yet still holding diplomatic passportS and received president's support privately AFTER the revelation, while the media revealing the case got searched by the police. it's been a year now, he got briefly detained, then going freely to leave the country, get hired, rumor says he's running for a mayor. on the other side, the one got hit got prosecuted long before.
---
**Austria**: there were a joint government between right övp and extreme right fpö, then a leak of fpö [scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza_affair) by whoeverknowswho, then fpö quits the goverment, övp winning record high votes in european parliament, then got sacked, by left and extreme TOGETHER! now övp wins again, let's hope they can form a government :D
---
**Italy**: same story, parties formed a government, despite totally different ideologies, inevitably broke (not even because of different ideologies, but only because one part [thought he can win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Salvini#Deputy_Prime_Minister_and_Interior_Minister) , but got punched hard), then form another government [of two completely different parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_(Italy)) (as long as one is on power, who cares :) lets see how long it lasts
---
**UK**: brexit; biggest joke i've seen for a little while, all started with cameron's personal gamble, then politicians on both sides trying their best to lie about consequences. yet only after the result delivered, during the negotiation phase did they realize the improbable backstop issue.  three years, now parliament blames PM for dictatorship (can you believe that :), PM dares parliament [an election](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-general-election-brexit-uk-study-opinion-poll-a9147376.html) . now snp pushes for independence again, shall we allow them to vote? no ? populist ? ok, and NI [felt deserted](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/nobody-wants-us-anyway-fears-of-the-forgotten-on-the-northern-irish-border-brexit) . 
---
Question here: do you know what were you voting for exactly? do you think you really were equally entitled to those who were more directly concerned? Tusk said very well: [hell for brexiteers without a plan](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47143135) (did anyone vote for him btw)
---
**Korea**, the south one: every single recent ELECTED president got fucked up, [arrested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye) ,  [arrested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak) , [arrested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roh_Tae-woo) , [suicided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roh_Moo-hyun) , and the current one got [record low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/support-for-south-korea-s-moon-hits-record-low-as-woes-pile-up) again. At least they have justice right? [sure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jae-yong_(businessman)) and [sure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Ja-yeon)
---
Oh **canada**, everyone loves canada and its liberal president, until you realize that he is actually blackface president, now either
---
\-nvm, he apologized, why did opposition fixating on this tho, they are instrumentalizing, leave him alone !  or -he should resign, hypocrite, why he no resign?? 
---
who is the righteousness ? nah, whoever is louder.
---
**Youknow**
---
let's leave those sprung up countries aside (Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Ukrain, Syria, Afghanistan, [Chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#U.S._involvement) , [argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War#United_States_involvement_with_the_junta)), or cherished ally Turkey and Saudi. (that's exactly the reason why many chinese are so sensitive to you-call-universal-they-call-western values, cf. the end)
---
No, let's talk about something else. have you heard recently about Ajit Pai? smollett? epstein? or brock turner ?  or [this](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/millionaire-ehsan-abdulaziz-who-said-he-accidentally-tripped-and-penetrated-teen-is-cleared-of-rape-a6774946.html) ? oh sorry it's uk. No ? do you want to change them? did you change them? will you change them?
---
do you know what happened during the purchase of Alstom? ([here](https://www.lemonde.fr/m-le-mag/article/2019/02/15/tombe-pour-alstom-frederic-pierucci-veut-sauver-l-industrie-francaise_5423916_4500055.html) and [here](https://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/politique/le-bilan-de-la-vente-d-alstom-est-catastrophique-pour-l-emploi-et-pour-notre-souverainete-20190604) ,use google translate, it's pretty accurate) i guess France is at least more of an ally than Kurds right?
---
or the situation of Trump, Biden and Pelosi, everyone proclaims to be the only incarnation of justice, who would you vote for to guide the land of the free? hooray btw.
---
oh sure it's still way better than china where no one can speak out anything. does it make a difference? you have your one vote, you can speak out freely, (like hopefully what im doing here, long live freedom of speech), how much does that make you feel better? do you remember last time you say "spread the word" on whatever the subject, then what ? 
---
ask yourself one question; you are saying fuck china because that china oppresses people, you want hongkong be free, you want china be free, OR ACTUALLY,  the same reason that you calling chinese eat dogs chinese tourists annoying chinese buy everything chinese shit on the street chinese sell cheap shit (worth every penny you paid for) chinese pollute a lot (by making world's consumerism shit, and dealing with world's waste)?
---
pollution, while china still emits less co2 per capita than US, it plants [more trees than any other country](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) (page 18) in the world, or [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/human-activity-in-china-and-india-dominates-the-greening-of-earth-nasa-study-shows)? (the country did the worst elected an president that "nobody" in the west likes) . (and here is canada, everyone loves canada, [except this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada–Philippines_waste_dispute))
---
did you see that in the news ? certainly not (now you search you can find them, but im pretty sure you didn't see that before), the reason is simple, because that "independent" media doesn't mean anything. read the guardian website "available for every one, funded by readers", they cannot be virtually different than a state or privately owned propaganda machines, they don't have the daily mail headline ^('Arguing with Coleen Rooney would be as pointless as arguing with a pigeon': That's the WAG-tastic response of Rebekah Vardy in this blistering exclusive interview, as she gets her claws into her rival and insists she has been betrayed") , not because they dont like it, but their reader dont like it. no one would fund anything in this case. the same way that your non-brainwashed society wont allow (passively, it's a free society intit?) the news above on mainstream media. the same reason you see only oppressed exiles, only if not oppressed, if not exiling, you wont hear them
---
speaking of propaganda, is there ONE REASON that "pro democratic" wont do so ? ONE REASON that propaganda belongs exclusively to authoritarian gov ? all these memes, posters here, they are impressive &amp; inspiring, without argument, all comes from one side without reasoning (so obvious dont need you may say), is the exact definition of propaganda.
---
The end:
---
Is Freedom, democracy fundamental ? maybe, [maybe not, according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)  
---
Especially when some countries set bad examples. 
---
While in terms of physiologic, China is having the most significant modernization, revenue increase (by selling cheap shit), convenient payment shopping, commuting and lodging, expanded and *punctual* high speed rail (yeah by stealing ), very well covered 4g, even on trains or everywhere in subway (do you have that in houston?), that's why the dumb guy asked don't you guys have phones, he thought anywhere else in the world can play with phones easily as in china. 
---
video surveillance and social credit? it doesn't bother that much if one doesn't hate commies (check that Maslow's stuff again, where would you put it ?) like you do.
---
it actually bothers people more if someone not punished for smoking on the train or littering the road. oh chinese shit one the street, now they want to stop that, it's violation of the human rights. 
---
also that's how people feel safety (or in your word, oppressed) in China, there is no place in china like, sorry, but [slough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdvyxXWtYwU)
---
hongkong:
---
i have no idea what's in authorities mind , but for many chinese: freedom -&gt; examples -&gt; chaos
---
i dont expect my propaganda change your mind, but hope it at least let you know something you didn't know before,
---
If you just want to see what they say then why not just wait till it's on YouTube or see what they tweet or just check Reddit
---
I feel you. Everyone processes things differently so we have no right to tell you how to feel about it, but I hope you realize you dont speak for all victims. I was molested as a kid, but I can still see the humor in this. Being able to laugh gives me a sense of power over what happened to me if that makes any sense.
---
The difference is Blizzard could be a profitable company without causing this whole ridiculous incident. The other casters might need the money for food or rent. 
---
You can't expect all the other castersand every blizzard employee to step down because while they might care about the issue they also need to eat
---

FTFY
---
It seems like people just want their single serving outrage.  They don’t care that all the major tech companies are also complying with censorship.  Microsoft and Apple bowed the Chinese government in order to operate there long ago.  
---
It seems like there is a lot gatekeeper and hypocrisy on who we should and shouldn’t boycott.  If someone chooses to overlook Blizzards actions, they are considered a Nazi or something but those same people calling them a terrible person are choosing to support companies that do the exact same as Blizzard.   
---
The main driving force is that people love to shit on Blizzard, it’s like video games get them all riled up yet all the work Apple, Microsoft, etc do with the CCP is overlooked.
---
I've had Kibler's stream open since the start of Omnistone, I scrolled from bottom to top and there's not a single post making fun of HK. 
---
Given the fact that his chat has been on slow mode AND sub only, top to bottom is a lot of time.
---
EDIT...
---
&gt;Will there be more discussion of the Hearthstone Grandmasters Asia-Pacific Ruling during the mailbag portion of the broadcast or "nothing to see here"? 
---
&gt;Will you guys be talking about the American University team forfeiting? Seems like the latest news.
---
Those are 2 questions I found only scrolling a little bit. It looks like they are not banning people asking real questions about the issue, they are banning braindead spam.
---
Oh my gosh! Lol. I can’t go for that discount then! My wife is from Hong Kong. She’d kill me if I had Chinese money. Can you imagine?
---
Get a free vpn most paid ones have a free version or cost like 6$/mo
---
I love how you cant translate your own english. Welcome to the club. Anyways, I think you're lost. Blizzard had two responses to Chungs actions. One to the wrst in english, one to the chinese in mandarin. Both released at the same time. The west got mad at the english version. Then we found this one and are also mad at it. Just because the person who made the title sound a bit misleading depending on how you want to read it, doesn't mean blizzard is okay in this situation. 
---
Sorry if that was a lot of words for you. I know your english isn't the best.
---
Thank you Mr. Moderator!
---
Lol hate speech. In China anything positive towards Hong Kong is considered hate speech. No such thing as hate speech, only free speech.
---
THANK YOU! You did the right thing, you are a good person.  
---
This aggression will not stand, man. FREE HONG KONG, MAN!
---
The only difference is he is a gm member and you are not. Gm members are held to much higher standards.  
---
I'm not defending blizzard or taking a side, I support hong Kong. Just saying this isn't 100% the same situation
---
If ATVI has been losing for longer than a day then you’d be hard pressed to pin this situation on a trend that’s much older than it.
---
I’m not making an assumption on 2-3 days. I’m making my assumption from the stand point that the “universally” hated EA is still very profitable, and that the internet is in general has ADD. Activision Blizzard is going to be just fine long term. 
---
It breaks my heart but there it is.
---
When I press make favorite outside of the deck creation screen it closes the window and does nothing.
---
We can't let this be forgotten by then.
---
If you’re so outraged that companies are suppressing free speech in regard to Hong Kong to protect their Chinese interests, then maybe you need to quit Reddit if you believe r/blizzard is also compromised.
---
I don't see what they could have done better in that scenario. Would you rather they stopped him and then what we will have now is the community going after them and them losing their fan base. They don't have broadcast control as casters. Either they let him speak and Bliz culls them or stop him and the fans disown them. I say they chose right.
---
they’re being enablers. some things in life are more important than video games — such as this (not to say you can’t enjoy video games if the company cranking them out isn’t behaving as horrendously as blizzard)
---
Admittedly your style of casting did not appeal to me much at the start, but as time goes by, I look forward to your hype moments every weekend on Grandmasters. Your pairing with Sottle was nothing short of pure entertainment, and it adds so much value to the already tense competition in EU.  
---
Your statement moved me to tears. Thank you so much Admirable for taking such a brave stand. If Blizzard miraculously gets their act together, I do hope to see you back on  the caster deck.
---
That's not what they are punishing him for, tho. They are punishing him, for using their platform, to make a political point, regardless of what that point may be.
---
It's not the job of Blizzard to give a platform for political ideologies. They are obligated to make money.
---
The ones that have failed us, are politicians. Or better we failed Hong Kong and the Chinese people, by electing bad politicians.
---
Why would we want someone who does a halfass stream with ads once a week to comeback to hs?? lmao no thank you go back to obscurity
---
Won't happen LOL. The kind of person who goes to Blizzcon is way too neckbeardy and sycophantic, they just want to see the vidya games.
---
Didn’t say they aren’t on your side I said they do not have your best interest at heart. That’s very different than “they aren’t on your side” 
---
People can unconsciously be shitty, they can be so defeated, so downtrodden that the very words they say are infectious to your mind. People mar very well be trying to brainwash wash you, but it ain’t the state.
---
They're a giant multi million dollar company.
---
They'll be fine long term.
---
I think people are sufficiently pissed off and anti chinese government sentiment  and blizz hate has reached meme status. Something the Panama papers failed to achieve.
---
I think it'll sick
---
You...are not very informed about the situation in Hong Kong, are you?
---
I mean, I am not from Hong Kong and I have only been paying cursory attention to the protest, but even I know that the majority of protesters are young people; just today, an article made it to the front of this very website that quotes Hong Kong police chief saying most protesters arrested are under 18.
---
Games are not political, but it doesn't stop people from using it for political gains, that is not something neither you or I can stop.  
---
Furthermore, CCP has always treated entertainment product as a battleground to influence people's mind, whether it was during the cultural revolution, or in recent years with CCP funded movies that promote ultra-nationalism and militarism.  
---
You may wish peace and for games to be a bridge, but you are the absolute minority among your people, and your stance is certainly not that of CCP.  So ultimately, even though you mean well, it is really all just futile.
---
Depends what sort of "cyber terrorism" they're being hit with. It wasn't specified. If a DDoS, yeah that's easy enough literally anyone can do it. If something more complex, that'd really depend what it was.
---
I will not be using any Blozzard products until after Blizzcon, and will continue as such until Blizzard takes action acknowledging their mistake, and what they are doing to make up for it.
---
No I'm not. It is what they do. And I explained in detail how and why. It isn't silly. It's factual that they decieve, manipulate and stage things to suit there interests. Is it not silly to think people like that wouldn't do the same to try and save there skins?
---
What drugs r u taking ?
---
Difference between kids bandwagoning for karma and adults who understand actions have consequences.
---
 If you don't stick to your values when they're being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies
---
To expand on the first point, it is *especially* insane to use the "games should never be political" argument with Blizzard, who have managed to work in themes of resistance against oppression into literally every single one of their franchises as central points. What was the entire Terran campaign about in Starcraft? The Orc campaign in Warcraft 3? The entire backstory of Overwatch? They have already committed heavily to political themes, even if they aren't explicitly commenting on real world political entities. To now turn around and pretend that their games "should not be political" is absurd.
---
I think they will hire actors If we do that, maybe a big crowd with hk t shirts will send a bigger message
---

This is exavtly what I meant. I don't endorse any physical violence.
---
 If you can't protest pirate the event.
---
Dude this blew me away. I’m really impressed by your conviction - I honestly don’t know if I’d have the guts to do it.
---
If China doesn't want to follow the basic rules of freedom and human rights in the 21st century, it will have to do so alone in it's closed borders. If the population doesn't agree with the path their leaders are following, since there is no election, only one corrupted, ruthless political party, there is only one way to change things. When everything from the west is banned in China, maybe people will go down in the streets and request changes. You did a good job in 1990, now it's time to finish it.
---
Try kingdom rush. It's a tower defence game, and there are a total of 4. The first is free and the rest are like $5 each
---
Didn't for me.
---
I don't see this issue as an free speech issue.  Even in Blizzard's punishment post said they stand for free speech.  I think NBA is a different issue because it was made by a GM.  I don't have a strong feel about Jayne's issue.  The high rank you are in an organization, the  more responsibility your speech has.  It is like, if a Janitor of the Rockets tweet about HK, I don't think China would be pissed, but GM is different, you see what I mean?  I do really agree with that they need to address why AU weren't punished totally a double standard.
---
Funny that you criticise my pristine English yet you can’t even write your paragraph with proper grammar. Also thanks for conceding that the post was misleading, that was exactly what I was waiting for. Good job shooting yourself in the foot hahaha.
---
I haven't seen any headlines saying so. Either way, Blizzard isn't to blame for this either.. They might have reacted badly, but the initial situation in China, goes on the countries, that financially support the current government.
---
Hi, thanks for the reply. As I will research more into this issue, I would also like to point out that this is not the official respond from Blizzard but from Chinese social media operator. I can vouch for that one since it says in Chinese that this was posted on Weibo. FYI, here is a reply on this matter[https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfi5rh/blizzards\_official\_response\_we\_highly\_object\_the/f34z875?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfi5rh/blizzards_official_response_we_highly_object_the/f34z875?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
This is hilarious
---
No desktop.
---
Because he caught a DQ in Magic, lol
---
One thing to note: people on reddit are disproportionately high spenders, so in dollar terms this is a bigger hit to Blizzard than if you just look at number of players.
---
yea
---
what do you think would happen if they went against china?
---
Perhaps, but in that case I would expect a genuine hedge funds or IA to be relying on internal research; and a wide variety of external sources as part of their investigations. 
---
In my experience with finance free "analysis" websites are seen as a way that unscrupulous bullshit artists con unsophisticated amateurs who think they know more than they actually do out of their hard earned. You might browse them just to see what the sharks are spruiking this week but you don't take them seriously.
---
I see what you're saying now. What you're talking about isn't wrong, but irrelevant. As I originally said before you got distracted talking about random facts you happen to know, they are make money from Chinese citizens but have to play by the government's rules.
---
Nah I literally thought he was bitxhing about Diablo Immortal. I've seen that like 3 times today bro
---
That was admirable.
---
Baldur’s Gate II! HMM III! Ah good times from back in the day
---
I mean, I'm not going to be mad at every Blizzard employee who keeps doing their job. I'd be mad at my bosses for making this shitty decision, but you still have to pay bills. Don't shame people when they don't have the option to stop working, that's the asshole mindset.
---
&gt;Blizz hasn't said anything yet, and it's hurting them to the point where it's becoming hard to salvage. They probably can't get all these people back at this point. The tournament is in jeopardy.
---
That's exactly why now is the right time for casters to be doing this: it puts pressure on Blizzard to take action.  Blizzard still has a chance to try to rectify the situation, but if the community doesn't put any pressure on them to do so, they won't.  Ultimately, we don't want to just punish them for making a bad decision; we want to try to steer them in the right direction, and showing them that there are negative consequences to abandoning their core values is one of the few ways of doing that.
---
It's almost like this is an important issue or something.
---
Exactly, everything works fine with the old portraits. I couldn't find anything on the Blizz forums indicating it was a known issue. Guess I will try again in a bit.
---
I was at least going to wait for Blizzard to respond to the Hong Kong stuff, definitely not spend any more money, but this...
---
This made me uninstall battle dot net.
---
I will consider playing hearthstone again if they remove this pedophile elite.
---
No they are not.  
---
But at the same time, if the company starts censoring more and more and you said nothing, then you're part of the problem.  
---
Companies are accountable to their customers.  If the customers don't hold them accountable then they'll keep doing it.  
---
I'm all for the idea of boycott until they put in provisions to ensure that this doesn't happen again beyond 'token gesture'.  
---
I want to play Diablo 4.  But if they're going to kowtow to CCP, then I don't want to play that version of Diablo 4.  
---
Play the games.  Enjoy the convention.  
---
But don't take credit if Blizzard changes course because of the rest of us boycotting.  Don't complain if you don't like the future direction of Blizzard as you had your chance.  
---
If however, they keep producing stuff you like, then you win.
---
It's a flag.  So what?  The Canadian flag gets toyed around with by replacing the maple leaf with a marijauna leaf and it's no big deal.   There's plenty of jokes made about the American flag.   And Nepal's flag is an easy target of a joke as well.  
---
You can make fun of a flag and play around with it while respecting a country or whatnot.  Just like you can disrespect an oppressive government while not feeling any ill will towards the people they rule over.
---
Nope. Just in general.
---
As Brian Kibler and others have noted, the punishment didn't fit the crime and speaks of Blizzard making an example of the player. The fact that American University players weren't punished shows that Blizzard is not simply following the rulebook. Lastly, Jayne of the OWL was directed to take down a tweet critical of Blizzard's actions. This was before the recent surge in outcry on Twitter.
---
Meh if they are still working there they can expect to get chewed out, it's the only way the higher ups will notice is if we protest against the employees as well
---
The point isn't just to "know about the issue". It's to continually pressure Blizzard into releasing a statement on this instead of letting them wait it out until the community forgets this ever happened.
---
Some things are more important than talking about DOOM IN THE TOMB. I know that may be an inconvenience for you, but its the entire livelihoods of many other people.
---
Care to PM me where you watch? Unless it's stupid easy to find... I've just never looked.
---
Some things are more important than games.  It's really disappointing that people get upset over their entertainment being disrupted over millions of people fighting for their freedom.
---
Give me liberty or death if it ever comes down to it this is what I’m about, if China ever has full control over our entertainment(movies, video game and social media) then I would be happy to take my happy ass down to a lake and fish for my food and wipe my ass with some leaves then to bend the knee to China.

I was contemplating selling my atvi shares as an act of protest. The only thing atvi cares about is the stock price.
---
So Hearthstone and TF2 have something in common!

I agree with what you said, but I don't think we are talking about the topic.  There is a reason that Microsoft doesn't call them a Republican company or Google calls themselves a Democrat company.  It is because they don't want to take a stand on these kind of stuff.
---
Who the fuck are those other scrubs tho.
---
You kids have guts. Keep being awesome. (: thanks for setting a great example for your fellow person.
---
The punishment was harsh, but it is the penalty that is written in their tournament rules:
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
&gt;*"nawww you sad that you can't speak? shame.*
---
What a dickhead attitude.
---
It takes big events for things to get noticed.  Bellyaching that they didn't notice before is a waste of time.  When is the right time to take a problem on?  Just use the attention itis getting now to get the word out.
---
Then Blizzard needs to clarify its stance on free speech. This is the closest thing to an official statement as we've gotten.
---
Reynad, Lifecoach... I'm sure there's plenty more.
---
Could give 2 fucks about making money to “live” if I gotta take part in censoring other countries and standing idle to it.
---
Then the America fan base would be happy, but guess what there’s more to the world then the US. They made a choice and they stuck with with, better then most can say.
---
Thoughts and prayers are one thing, but when push comes to shove, talk is cheap and actions speak loudest. What people don't seem to understand is that by doing nothing, you're also implicitly choosing a side.
---
You can think  this is the political correct in China.
---
I'm a chinese from mainland, and I know TW is a special problem, but most of us shall not be so angery like this...After all, we need a visa when we go to TW.
---
It is confusing to most people because most people do not respond to human suffering with, “I can do nothing, so I don’t care and will tacitly take the side of the oppressor.”
---
So, I find myself forced to pity you. To live a life without hope that things can get better, or than you can make a difference, sounds like an awful existence. 
---
Good luck.
---
Protests are supposed to be painful and hopefully have consequences.  Anyone targeting the Devs is an absolute asshole. 
---
Not protesting because the little guy will feel it could be argued for every single protest every held.  Ever.
---
Human Rights are worth a protest and boycott.  If the Devs are hurt, that sucks.  It doesn't mean I don't care, it just means the company is so bad it would punish its workers for executive bad policies.  So, another reason to protest and hopefully a good company will pick them up.
---
Yeah, or anything else that actually kills it. Zeph is an idiot.
---
Nah don’t worry I’m republican and I still upvote liberate Hong Kong memes
---
Hey, I’m pro-HK I just wanna relax on my bus ride home
---
Agree. Blizzard could learn something from the mods.
---
Hasn't been really updated yet. The week is ongoing.
---
Let's face it, no one here really cares enough about Hong Kong to inconvenience themselves. Very easy to boycott blizzard behind a keyboard as long as you don't actually have to do anything.
---
If everyone cared so much about human rights they would start by looking back home at all the human rights violations their own countries are also committing and should be doing something about that instead of suddenly caring out of nowhere to go with the crowd.
---
Indeed. This would have flown cometely under the radar hadn't they gone over the top to please their overlords.

I have a dinner ticket, and as it stands right now I think I'm not going to go.

Ah, see. You tried to hide your true thoughts and feelings, yet, here you are. Showing your true colors.

I understood it as, "If you don't have them, we'll loan them to you."  I'm upset I can't use the gold cards I spent dust on and didn't disenchant.

Lichess, Shadowverse, Gwent, TES: Legends
---
It's amazing. I've done on-the-ground activism before, and every 5 minutes some concern troll would mention how worried they were about violence when literally NOBODY in the group of protesters had brought it up. It's a constant straw-man.
---
stop being a drama queen.

I posted this to show the sheer grasp of Chinese shills in the HS community.
---
You don't know what it would take to feel the deep need to stop supporting a company, until it happens.
---
Well, looks like you got it figured out. Amazing.
---
Except when its pride month blizz got jump on that political bandwagon. 
---
They only stay politically neutral when it suits them.
---
Uldum was more impactful.
---

---
This is 100% accurate,.
---
Blizztard has already "spoken" they keep banning Hong Kong rates stuff at their games and media. Fuck Blizzard and fuck China!!!!
---
I just want to thank you for being very open minded. The other guy was harsh though but bear in mind that people from other countries do indeed know about so many atrocities that the Chinese government has done to its citizens that everyday Chinese citizens might not know of.
---
Monster hunter Iceborne came out recently so I’ve been set for awhile, just more incentive to never come back to hs. Even while bored at work and on my phone.

You know I normally am one to say how much i hate anecdotal evidence as an arguing point but...

Nah.  This is the kind of stuff I love to hear.

I know better than to look at someone's reddit history. Even though now you've made it more tempting. But I still won't. Probably.

You despise that I’m right

People are being arrested and raped in the police stations. One girl stood up and recounted her experience at a Hong Kong University recently, while an underage boy claims he was gang raped by male police officers while detained, and that one of those was someone high up in the police force.   
---
There's also the disproportionate use of force and policing tactics being used to deal with the demonstrations, and many instances of the police force trying to provoke the protestors so that they have an excuse to pull their firearms on them. 
---
There's a lot of video evidence about this. Check out /r/HongKong.
---
Lol, thank you Randy
---
It's not like Blizzard Taiwan can just ban players and fire casters willy nilly without the approval from Blizzard HQ. The regions may be separate, but they are all in the same league and competing (and working) internationally.

Thank the god Icefrog Valve grabbed DotA. We had a similar incident with a player named Kuku...except he was still able to collect winning and play at the biggest tourney.
---
You've the right to support that.  I'm actually glad that you acknowledge the violence unlike a lot of other posts.  I just disagree with this form of "protest" and I don't think it will achieve their aims.
---
And you can 100% verify it was legit and approved by Blizzard HQ? That it wasn’t some fake picture and or just from their Chinese department?
---
"Vote with your dollar" Has to be the dumbest phrase ever developed. You might be surprised to find out that your dollar doesnt mean shit to the millions from China lmao.

As far as I'm concerned Taiwan is still the rightful heir to the China invited by the United Nations.  Doesn't mean that the ccp are crazy people who are willing to bring weapons to bear against the thought that Taiwan isn't chinese taipai

It's not left wing, lol, HK are literally fighting against self proclaimed ultra leftists (CCP).

you're right. it didn't. lots of countries including the US ignored the atrocities of germany until they were brought into the war.
---
Thank you for standing up for what is right. It must have been a massive undertaking but I will always remember that you did the right thing when it counted. If I see you casting somewhere else, you’ve got my view.
---
“Boycott Blizzard”. Proceeds to compete in tournament. Lol. Okay. If this was anything other than virtue signaling they would have pulled out altogether. Should have just gotten on screen and roped every turn if they really wanted to send a message.

Twitch/Mixer will have people streaming it.

Lovely.  I especially loved the sounds of the gas shells being lobbed.  Really brings home the feel
---
I think regardless of this event, the stock isn't sufficiently stable to stay where it's at.  Their properties/ pipeline are waning or depleted.  There were already several canaries in the coal mine that the stock isn't on solid ground, such as poor employee moral and terrible management/ judgement, which is continuing to be played out during this HK crisis.
---
&gt; we have to keep this up for 21 more days.
---
Won't happen. 
---
This subreddit represents a microcosm, a pitiful single percentage point, of the entire userbase of Blizzard. 
---
Blizzcon will go off without a hitch, with more than half the audience pulling the lame ass "dOnT bRiNg PoLiTicS iNtO mY gAmEs" shit.
---
&gt; As far as I'm concerned Taiwan is still the rightful heir to the China invited by the United Nations. 
---
Legally, it probably should be.  But if the UN actually gave a shit about justice and fairness the security council members wouldn't have veto powers over everything, so whatever.
---
Note that I am not associated with this in any way. I just think it is a great idea and want to support it.
---
It’s obvious you’re just trying to do a troll now. I can’t really keep talking to you if you can’t scroll up and see the 4 times you’ve replied to me trying to defend not boycotting.
---
&gt;Anyway. How much should I spend on this game? And which packs should I buy? I don’t wanna spend more than $750. Is that enough?
---
I see that your post explains why this is a bad position for blizzard to have put themselves in, was there another point? 
---
Of course its a shit situation for them, they decided to censor someone fighting for human rights, they 100% deserve to face this backlash and hopefully take some lasting damage for it.
---
Just because not every gaming community wants to be overrun by off topic spam like this place? Use your fucking head. Wanna do something useful, send money to Amnesty International instead of playing Internet revolutionary.
---
As long as we keep it peaceful that can't remove us from the premises
---
I feel this. I was actually super excited for the upcoming event with all the cards coming back but I can't support Blizzard in this one.
---
The same would happen if these same casters, coaches, and players tried to send a message in support of the Houthi’s in Saudi Arabia during an official company stream. Or if these same people would come out in defense of the Kurds.
---
This is not some unique situation that only happened because it was against China
---
You are right.  I can be a tard, won't even try to pretend otherwise
---
For what it's worth, I can only upvote you once, mate
---
Garage mods, all of you
---
Our lord and saviour: the April fools guy
---
But it would be nice to see a study how big the percentage is if nobody buys from China. Why would huawei panic that way if they could just sell in their homeland. Currency exchange and how cheap they pay people plays a big role I think. 
---
Trade is important to them. They actually just stole an island from the Philippines. They could have waited for UN and stuff but they didn’t and just declared it theirs. 
---
So if you starve them from globalization, they need to figure out how to maintain the wages they are enjoying plus where to sell the stuff if their own people can’t afford it. The world is giving them the money imo.
---
Sorry, English it's not my first language, sometimes I mess up things xd

How so?

Shadowverse as well as hearthstone alternative

If you all actually go to blitz on wearing shirts like that, probably want to wear something over it so they don’t block you from getting in the convention. It would be more effective if you were seen on stream, fellow attendees, or members of the press.
---
Do they pay you by the post or per hour?
---
I'd like to say i only support the violence because of the inhumane treatment they're being met with. If it were people just going around randomly burning stuff for no reason, etc, i'd be against it. 
---
These people are evidently desperate and will fight with whatever they have. I think there's an almost inconceivable bravery to be found in that.
---
You'll be sorely disappointed. I thought I knew who you were but some things about your post history makes me question my thoughts.
---
The issue here is Blizzard's actions in relation to the Hong Kong situation. People are starting to vote with their wallets and cause a massive PR nightmare scenario for Blizzard.
---
This is a boycott against a company because of their stance. This is a step removed from being directly involved with the Hong Kong situation.
---
Nah, wage theft is the real wage theft. Loser.
---
As an investor of Activision I'm happy with their choice. Makes sense, but the way they went about it angers me. As a person I'm upset they went this route but understand the pressure they are receiving from investor's, their China market, and their Western audience. They can't win either way, so they'll minimize damage.
---

TO BE FAIR, you can at least sort of cash out after a cocaine-like spending spree in MTG.
---
You make many assumptions here, about sameness of groups of people and overlays of their ideals.
---
They are a private group and they have the right to mute you. 
---
How the fuck do you know they are Chinese shills just because they refuse to talk about the situation? Is Thijs a Chinese shill let me guess?
---
Why, may I ask? I genuinely want to know if you could afford to do the same thing if your company did the same thing.
---
We do have many loanwords, and googling it we supposedly have a lot of words in total, but vast majority of them I imagine aren't used in common speech.
---
What I know is that nearly everytime I talk with family I end up having words I can't translate properly and trying to google them doesn't provide me any new norwegian words I didn't think of already.
---
Soggy being one such example.
---
And yeah I imagine the nordic languages suffer this issue a lot more than spanish due to the germanic vs romance language groups.
---
English also has a tremendous amount of loanwords as you point out, which is why I think it is one of the most ideal languages now, since it might be the language in the world with the most loanwords, making it cover a lot more than any other, I feel like I always have a word for things in english that anyone fluent in english will understand.
---
Not sure that's true.  A pro team posted a Liberate Hong Kong poster and they were not punished at all.  Aussies I believe, they made a post tonight confirming they were not punished
---
Overwatch and their other properties are now a symbol of the HK revolution movement.  I predict it's not a question of if they're banned, but when and how hard the hammer falls on them.
---
Fuck the Chinese Government!
---
Thanks for joining the boycott man :D hopefully we can make a difference.
---
Woah OK the rape is really scary if it's true. But I've seen the videos protestors claim to show police brutality, and some of them, especially the one where protesters beat up and off duty cop, show that the protesters obviously instigated it - they were gonna beat him to death if they weren't stopped I swear. If protesters threw petrol fucking bombs at the police in USA, they'd just be dead. Shot on the spot. Feel like HK police have been restraining themselves, with only a few rogue brutal policemen I suppose.
---
Netease is a verified account that is blizzard approved speaking on behalf of blizzard on weibo. Saying that they are a blizx distributor doesn't absolve them here. I am sick of that excuse.
---
Bringing politics at work is a terrible decision as a general rule.
---
Don't delete, put them to good use. I've already paid for this month of WoW, so I've been submitting helpful in-game "Suggestions" (read: harassing Blizzard and hoping there is a Blizz employee somewhere laughing their ass off at my submissions)
---
I agree with you exactly. I am completely f2p and I haven’t a paid a dime to Blizzard for a long time.
---
LOL. If we're making this a competition, I think stalking a random stranger online because he offended your snowflake heart is the cringiest of all?
---
No worries lol
---
China's human rights issues makes america balk. Don't do the both sides routine please

No dude... it was just a mistake, the only reason I commented is because I imagined Chinese secret service wearing a Gorila costume and laughed out loud LUL
---
I have a friend that went there and got the chance to visit him there at the campus. All the people that go there are very politically passionate and aware. I had a feeling we would see another headline with them if nothing happened changed.
---
..and he want to learn how to play online poker lol
---
Solidarity!
---
True, but it's still more of a statement than doing nothing.
---
&gt;If he would've made a political statement that didn't involve China, I doubt he's even punished.
---
We don't know that, I think he would've. Has anyone ever made any other political statement? Bashing on Trump, for example? I don't think it has happened, so there's literally no evidence on wether they'd punish him or not.
---
I know I won't change your mind on this, so I'll give this a rest.
---
Feel free to add anything else you'd like to say though. I like reading different points of view about this whole shit storm .
---
&gt;	censor proclamations of support for Hong Kong
---
You wot mate.
---
It’s always nice to see those with minority opinions sharing, it’s almost as if that’s the focus of this post except when taking place in Hong Kong and then you made it selfish by trying to belittle admirable and kibler’s casting ability when I bet they have 100x the game knowledge that you ever will
---
Lmao
---
Yeah, basically.
---
To be more precise, according to Xiaose, he reported the incident to Netease, and Netease told him that they had already reported to Blizzard-US.
---
I ended the turn and he shot a fireball at himself and died
---
No, this is EXACTLY what Kibler warned us about. Not everyone can afford to make the stand. Don't get mad at the little guys who have to survive, focus your distaste for the ones calling the shots.
---
Freedom is a Natural Right not even just for humans... That's not politics.
---
This is why civil arguement is impossible.
---
Toast I do not how much you add in profit for them but to the public you are a major part of hearthstone. Keep on keeping on and hope you are doing well outside of the meta.
---
&gt;edit: guys i was kidding, rofl. please stop messaging me.
---
My sides LMAO
---
I hope in the finals the winner says something like "I want to ironically thank Blizzard for bowing to our new chinese overlords because only by banning so many of my competitors, they allowed me to win this tournament. Thank you BlizzChung!"
---
Your message was not political, not even close. It was attention seeking.
---
Blitzchung is an actual HK resident and he knew the kind of political message he was sending by putting it on stream. He used the hearthstone tournament as a political platform which it is not supposed to be. 
---
If his message, or yours, is about human rights which you claim, why did no one hold up Free Tibet or Free Xinjiang signs in HS tournaments before this? Or bring attention to the rest of the human rights abuse in the world?
---
Blizzard's reaction to Blitzchung was heavy handed, and their customers are free to react accordingly. You merely draw attention to yourselves for your own interests.
---
If you truly believe in HK's democratic cause, nothing is stopping you from flying over there and joining them with your placards, then posting that over here. Otherwise, just spare me and keep your "political" message out of a video game tournament stream.
---
Yeah? Show me where I have done that in the past.
---
I don't think Blizzard's actions (or lack of them) in the collegiate scene is directly comparable to their actions with Blitzchung.
---
  
---
I am very curious to see what would happen if one of the Western pros did the same thing as Blitzchung on a Western broadcast. I'm willing to bet that they would be banned the same way Blitz was. If not, then it would definitely prove the point of hypocrisy. In fact, it would have been true bravery if AmnesiaSC went the extra step to support Hong Kong during a live GM broadcast. 
---
Basically, I think you're arguing apples to oranges here. There's too many distinctly different variables here - the main one being that Collegiate games will never be held to the same standard as the highest league of play for any esport.
---
I don’t think either of those would have been punished. MAYBE the Trump one, because of the (well deserved) hate felt by a majority of Americans. But if he would’ve said “feel the Bern” or “Romney 2020” he wouldn’t have even been reprimanded I’d wager. I personally believe the only reason he was punished at all was pressure from China.
---
Most respectable sites have algorithms against review-bombing. Is this news to you?
---
Values aren't values if they're easy or cheap. Only you can determine if your ethics, morals, and principles - and those that you want to teach your sons - are worth the sacrifice.
---
Good news is there's no penalty for political statements during the actual game. So protest away!
---
do whatever you want and let your sons do whatever they want with the games. it's a personal decision to make, and you shouldn't force someone to quit the game even if you think it's the right thing to do in this situation. we are in no way obliged to quit the game which we've been playing for ages just because of some dumb decision made by the higher-ups of blizzard.
---
Political philosophy is ethics extended.  You know that the idea of natural right originated from political philosophy right?
---
Hahaha. Somehow I want to believe that interaction was intended. Was there any special dialog?
---
I been looking around and it seems like some people/investors think this will blow over eventually or are a vocal minority. Still I am hopeful if this is kept up then they will see otherwise and we will see the drop in the share price.
---
Do the Naruto run!
---
Dozens are not that much when you see the amount of other people.
---
Refer to above poster, I agree punishment should be held or else this HS tournament is going to become a political shoutout stand. But the problem is the punishment is so harsh it makes one wonder if this is a signal to others that this is their end if they wish to support HK, and this it self seems a very political move.
---
Well fucking said dude.
---
They merged/removed a lot of threads so I cant find it
---
It’s only a natural right if you’re born in the right place. And even then many seek to take that right from you and some vote to give it up for themselves and others.
---
Sadly not, but it was entertaining
---
I’d just like to point out that I said I doubted he’d be punished. Not that he certainly wouldn’t. I personally feel if he would’ve said “Feel the Bern!” Or “Romney 2020” he would’ve been fine. Just my opinion, and why I think the whole ordeal is so disgusting.
---
LMAO is that really the angle you want to take? Calling me a shill for pointing out facts? Get over yourself.
---
can't find the statement either. 
---
For Americans, Freedom of Speech is a right we may take for granted. For Taiwan/HK that right doesn't exist. Would be a really important figure in this situation, as a taiwanese player and probably the most well known player in APAC.
---
Um not to be a dick but I think you got the wrong subreddit
---
&gt;Overnight Blizzard had a huge mess in their lap that they had no part of in creating other than the fact the people responsible had Blizzard in their name. And now they are getting all of the hate for it.
---
If they didn't agree with what happened they've had days to correct it. What have they done in that time? Absolutely nothing.
---
It’s possible! It’s just something I’ve been thinking about.
---
I believe the reason he was punished so *harshly* was because of China, but I still think he might have been reprimanded for any other political statement. Which makes sense to me, because like I said, if you start allowing those kinds of things it can really snowball and they don’t want that as a company.
---
I watch the OWL and I could for sure see a player being punished if they shouted “feel the bern” in a post match interview.
---
No. You get to play fucking Rag, don't complain.
---
Yes,I an creating my reddit account because I want to understand the views of Western netizens and need to learn English.Before that,I only browsed Chinese social software.
---
Oh they care my dude, top posts are all Hong Kong related.
---
He can set a example for his sons by taking a stand against a company that has unambiguously sided with tyranny.
---
I'm going to start by saying 18-19 is not mature enough to understand.  I only say that because I didn't understand human rights issues at that age.  Hell I didn't really grasp the importance of human rights outside of my own county until I was maybe 30.
---
They aren't old enough to have a beer legally, I don't think they can fully appreciate the outrage to silencing someone who was shining a light on the oppression the Chinese government forces on many of it's people.  You could try to explain forced organ donation, labor camps, and social scores, but it's not in their world which doesn't extend past their home town.
---
A boycott happens because you can't support the company anymore, not because you are trying to make a difference.  If making a big difference is the goal, tone down the expectations.  If not supporting a company because you feel they have been immoral in a way you cant ignore, then do it.
---
Don't judge them too harshly if they don't care.  Dont judge yourself too harshly if you don't care.
---
All the people shitting on others for being outraged are pricks.  Anyone who says you must be outraged is a prick.
---
You can boycott and be a voice if you are truly outraged.  If you don't really care, play the game and enjoy assuming your kids are in the same boat.
---
That really does suck, and voting with your wallet isn't easy. Here's hoping that they'll make it worth coming back, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
A time machine might be more easy to acquire?
---
The return of the king

I took a moment to do the math, but damn if you are right. The math checks out. April 1st, November 1st, 6 months apart.

I’m not even into Blizzard’s games but I am getting a huge boner thinking about this year’s BlizzCon.
---
How Admirable of him
---
Fine I’ll go back to wild... *grumble mumble*
---
It isn't wotc that would be worried about their future in China, it would be Hasbro.
---
If there is anything I learned from r/freefolk it's that the internets determination is suprisingly scary
---
Well, we may not have gotten to area 51 but we can sure as hell get to BlizzCon
---
Thats why people in the crowd need to wear shirts that show Pooh or support Hong Kong. They won't be able to show the audience and they can't kick out everybody because then they have an angry mob right outside. They are banking on this blowing over. If the outrage can last til Blizzcon, they will really feel the hurt.
---
Top-tier software engineers have never wanted to work for Blizzard; good point about hurting recruitment though.

You're not wanted back toast

To be fair, Blizzard set the bar low.
---
"imprisoned for a 1000 years...."
---
Thank you for posting this, good to see blizzard continuing its censorship campaign, its nice to have another log for the fire. Let's keep the pressure up.
---
Fuck China and fuck those who kowtows to them.
---
Many teams at blizzard have access to publishing content on blizzard sites. Tons of teams have CMS access based on their needs. The HS esports teams definitely have access even across regions, because they have to post results and such frequently. They also are usually pretty autonomous. Posts like that usually don’t go across PR editorial desks. That team mostly edits officially company wide statements, community blogs, press releases, etc. they don’t even approve forum moderator posts (there were more than a few times we had to walk back over reactions from community managers and issue apologies. )
---
Queue in Toast's post. We'd love to see streamers not play it but we also have to understand why they need to. We shouldn't force them to not play it. Personally, I've kept my Hearthstone channels subscription, felt like a good way to remind myself everyday that Blizzard colossally fucked up whenever I open YouTube.
---
Hmm I think we'll need to see admin logs for definite proof ( if they ever post it) 
---
Here is the removedit link

---
Sure. But affording to walk away from your employer without being too affected financially like Kibler is also privilege.
---
Cause if we force others to fight for anything, how are we any better than some communist governments?
---
1.  This looks like witch hunting
---
2.  These obviously aren't the whole discussions and could be cherry picked.
---
3. Sounds like she is just pessimistic on the outcome, thinks it is unrealistic to make streamers/entertainers take a stance, people aren't fairly representing both sides, and is likely frustrated that someone on Grandmaster called her a "worthless insect" is going to be overshadowed.  
---
Really the only controversy here is what she might deem as "fair" for Blitzchung's punishment versus what others might.  The other things seem entirely reasonable and not everyone can be expected to give up their job/income to speak out on foreign issues they might not even understand.
---
This really touched a nerve. The game is so expensive and ungenerous, you almost feel compelled to min/max. It starts feeling more like a job than a game, to me at least. I'm glad to be rid of it.
---
Blizzard uses more than dollars spent as user metrics to attract investors and advertisers.
---
Have you got literally any source on that last part cause I think you've just made it up
---
Amnesiac representing my hometown in a good light. Well said, man.
---
If you want to keep playing the game then do so. Why do you need the approval of random strangers on the internet to do so?

That's no country I ever heard of

**Communist Party of China**
---
The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is the sole governing party within mainland China, permitting only eight other, subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the United Front. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

No streamer is going to do that and risk a Twitch ban on their job.
---
I imagine most of the NBA's revenue is still based in the US - It's just a safer bet to keep Americans happy because Chinese fans aren't exactly filling seats at the Staples Center.
---
You’re gonna need to do better than that. Actually quote me saying anything like “people shouldn’t boycott”. 
---
Or, as is apparent to anybody following along, admit you’re wrong in your assessment of me and need to practice better reading comprehension.
---
I've seen worse bait I guess.
---
Tespa is partnered with Blizzard.
---
&gt;  which in my view is an "essential" service that only a few provide
---
The airspace competition in the US is reasonable. You can easily switch all your flights to Delta or American. People don't because they don't **really** care. Sorry to burst your bubble but that's the truth.
---
Speaktivisim is easy. There is little to no cost with the anonymity of the internet. 
---
Hurting your own convenience is difficult. Why do you think $5 tees are still all the rage everywhere? You think *anyone* will come out and say "I support sweat shops in south east asia/subsaharan africa"? 
---
This phenomenon, called the attitude-behaviour gap is **well studied** in business ethics. And the literature is fairly conclusive. **Ethics** don't matter, even if it causes "international outrage". Because at the end of the day, your customers are not all enlightened 17th century philosophers, they are **human**. And the drive to satiate your own desires comes **far far far** before the drive to be ethically fulfilled, and as a corollary, that's why so many people will post in support of "the right thing", you get free social fulfillment. 
---
My prediction: this blows over in 2 weeks time. Minimal to no long term damage. Prove me wrong.
---
Why is that relevant.
---
They definitely did. I'm trying to find one of the full transcripts of that interview, but god knows which of these dozens of threads I found it in...
---
They told him to "say it clearly, then we'll cut", "say the 8 words", and even complimented him on the gas mask.
---
I was initially misled to think the casters were basically blindsided by the message, because that's a common talking point in this sub at the moment.
---
In the wise words of Ricky and Elliot, they're just gonna stfu and hope this whole thing blows over.
---
Being unaware of a political issue is not a crime. Almost everyone who was aware still cared about HK protests. Everyone who didn't know didn't care. I don't see the hypocrisy. 
---
This dude did an amazing job of raising awareness, and Blizzard actually helped by trying to sweep this under the rug.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
By recent comment do you mean the one on weibo, the Chinese Twitter that was written before the outrage and press coverage, once again done by their entity in China, the OP is right this situation isn't black and white, I don't condone what was done in this situation by any stretch but people in China, under Chinese rule reacted in fear of the evil Chinese, go figure.   
---
I don't support or condone one single abuse that goes on in China but to hold Blizzard to their level of human decency is absolutely absurd. Blizzard is full of 100 if not 1000s of individuals who make games out of a love for their art or to make people happy, a lot of their employees aren't happy with what has happened either and are taking a stand and good on them for that but as stated this issue isn't black and white and while you can take your moral high ground if you're going to including any sort if profiting from China in your list of those equally culpable of human rights abuses your list would be endless and include entire nations including the UK or US.  
---
Maybe it is naive of me to think Blizzard might pull out of China, I'll grant you that one but outside of that again this issue is much wider than Blizzard and includes many entities, corporations, governments and a lot of bureaucracy and if you think people can't support Hong Kong or any other human rights issues because they still enjoy certain products or want to just go on living their lives I mean, I can't fathom what you want from people, this issue, the actual issue is never going to be solved by just not buying stuff made in or exported to or from China. It's likely political intervention, war or internal reformation of the Chinese government that's the only solution.
---
It's honestly way too late for them at this point. No level of half arsed appeasement should get people to forgive them
---
I've noticed a lot of people making the false equivalence between political speech and bringing awareness to social issues like climate change and human rights violations being committed right now claiming that they are 'too political'.
---
At what point in the modern days did using a platform that you have earned to highlight key social issues like human rights violations or climate change become politicised so heavily?
---
I feel sorry for the game devs.
---
I get why there's so much hate but it's all being directed to Blizzard as a whole while in truth there's only a handful of greedy motherfuckers who make those calls on whether they're going to bend the knee to their Chinese investors or stand up for what they think is right.
---
In the same way, boycotting Blizzcon might get great media coverage but at the same time we're shooting ourselves in the foot. I was also looking forward to the new WoW content, both classic and retail.
---
I put a lot of time into Blizz games and got a lot of joy and new friends out of their games so I can't help but feel really sad watching this fold out the way it is right now. Investors have taken over the company and the way the upper management shows its true colours right now is disgusting to say the least. Somehow I wish they never grew so big and just kept the old devs around who cared more about standards and integrity instead of economic growth.
---
Its reaching a point where the west should probably intervene and end this once and for all.
---
For far to long have the chinese people been oppressed , for far to long has a family of madmans rulled a country with a heavy hand and without consideration for the others.
---
Something has to be done , even if its just using our voice and causing ruption between American enterprises and China .
---
They've gone down the Winchester for a nice cold pint and wait for it all to blow over.
---
It’s more the phrasing that sounds silly, but to add onto your point, pretty much any fandom has the possibility to go apeshit over something and be unrelenting until whatever it is is fixed or goes away.
---
Lol so this sub would have been happier is these university kids got sanctioned as well?  Give me a break.
---
Found the chinese bot!
---
Even better, people are trying to turn Mei into a symbol for the HK resistance, if it gets enough traction China may ban Overwatch from the country entirely.  Happened with Winnie the Pooh
---
So now it is ok to just stalk people and copy paste conversations and post it around to the world? All this talk about human rights and look at how low people swoop to witch hunt people that dont go along with their point of view. This is just disgusting. I do not support or condemn the subject of what she says but I certainly condemn this type of behavior. Everyone entitle to their opinions nothing is black or white. Just cuz you feel passionate about something doesnt mean everyone has to as well and if they feel differently they are not suddenly a lower class being. 
---
You wonder why most streamers are banning hk in the chat you guys care less about the issue and more about catching some slip up or finding some drama to fuel your karma farming.
---
It's a shared poweruser account. Several people operate it to moderate subreddits and so they can negotiate with advertisers for money in exchange for not banning advertisement posts for a certain amount of time after they're posted.
---
Admirable happens to be my favorite caster, I knew I was a good judge of character. xD
---
Honestly, the livelihood argument is pretty weak. At this time, Blizzard would be too stupid to ban anybody else from just putting up a statement. You can continue to stream/play but at least say something about it.
---
fuck blizzard i know their CEO, piece of trash
---
One circle.

Disappointing as I've always enjoyed watching Frozen play  but everyone is entitled to their opinion and speech.  Even if we don't agree with it.

Plenty of people have been doing, saying, being active for years with no one listening. 
---
Plenty of people care, they just don't know what to do.
---
Plenty of people are capable but didn't have a cause.
---
When events like this happen it can be a rallying cause. 
---
The masses can join the people who have been screaming. Maybe only for a time. Maybe it's crazy what people can be do.
---
bringo
---
She doesn't realize that because she's ignorant.
---
You live in a dream world if you think video games and politics are, or has ever been, independent. While one can wish for more or less of it, politics has always been intertwined with it.
---
So if the playerbase stopped all transactions to Blizzard today, would they simply use active accounts as a way to bring ads in and then run commercials in game? I dont mean to waste your time on hypotheticals, I just dont know the inner workings when it come to advertisements.
---
&gt; Really the only controversy here is what she might deem as "fair" for Blitzchung's punishment versus what others might.
---
You don't think her saying it was 'easy for him to speak out' is controversial?  Because that was kinda messed up, in my eyes.
---
Didn't think so lmao
---
Fair enough, popular YouTuber then.

Exactly. Let those who don't to be involved, remain neutral. A well-written post, man :)

There isn't any proof this is getting the attention of people who drive this company's decisions. The guy who wrote the post on this website isn't an investment analyst, he's just a blogger.
---
This post is fluff, completely unproven. It's one amateur guy with some interest in the tech sector and amateur investing writing an unvetted, unproven analysis - albeit a pretty reasonable one! - based on his opinion of a current news event.
---
There is no evidence that investors or investment analysts are marking Activision-Blizzard down as a result of this fiasco, and the OP is taking this far, far too credulously.
---
It’s wrong to feel sorry for the company that created a job for him? You guys throw blizzard under the bus for banning someone that used their platform for a political stance. Wanna know who is suffering the most? Not blizzard, not the guys boycotting. But the people that want no part of this, because it’s none of our business.

What they currently doing now is what Nazi do , ethnic cleansing of muslim minority.

Fucking deplorable
---
Being realistic, you're correct that you quitting won't have any effect on blizzard. What they did was certainly pretty shitty, but I'm not going to stop playing because of political views. You shouldn't feel bad about enjoying a game because of the company behind it. If you feel strongly enough to then don't spend any more money but I don't see any reason to stop playing all together
---
Sure, clear translation without adding explanation is difficult in a lot of cases.
---
I just thought the point was that there's things that can't be explained.
---
No apology wanted. They have made their position known loud and clear. Now it's our turn as consumers to hit them in the bottom line which is the only language they understand. Don't buy their products. Don't play their games.
---
How hard can it be to just stick with talking about the game they just had? Maybe the rules about what's off topic is vague, but is anyone really going to claim that they thought the HK protests would have been a kosher topic?
---
Let's move to league if legends

Exactly my thoughts. That was contextually tone deaf.

If there is no more news on it then it will. This sub cant be peoples opinions spammed over and over again

sad.
---
Difference between simply saying "China is infringing on human rights." And wearing gear of Hong Kong protesters and declaring support for the rioters.
---
First is a statement about a country doing something. Second is directly showing support for a political civil unrest movement.
---
You're the only one who can't differentiate the two.
---
In a lot of cases, you're absolutely right. But it'll often bounce back over the next week or two after the outrage has blown over with no significant loss.

No, it doesn't. That's speculation.

Let me offer additional speculation: Making any political statement would have resulted in some sort of punishment, but the fact it was a statement which angered the Chinese government is why the punishment was so overtly excessive.

boring....imho it's a private company who hasn't broken the law by not wanting this kid to express political views in a gaming setting...this is getting old now...they are well within their rights to not want or want something as long as it's legal.

the kid spoke things in a place that didn't represent him. it wasn't his own channel, nor his own project or product. if blizzard felt a way about it then as long as it's within the law it's all above board.

The revolutions in Poland and Estonia went through because they were allowed to, because communist regimes there were propped up by a foreign power. Once Moscow decided it was not economically feasible to maintain control and withdrew its armies, of course everything broke down.

The situation in China is not like this. Xi is not Gorbachev. He will not back down in HK and he will certainly not back down in the mainland.

Trump supporters were first to react when the Hong Kong protests started and started waving around the flag, which is why you can peg people like Avi Yemini in Hong Kong quite a ways back.

You're new to this because it affected a game you play. Don't spread completely and ridiculous falsehoods guised under "orange man bad".
---
Are you from China? In the rest of the world breathing is not a privilege but a right.
---
I guess dusting legendaries and harassing hs streamers did nothing afterall. Who would’ve thought that.
---
  If blizzard had shown little bit of resistance or try to protect the players or   if they got pushed by Chinese government first and  paid  Blitzchung to release him  from the tournament, It would have been less ugly.  There are no signs of inner conflicts . This is the most scary part.
---
I cannot disagree.
---
He comes across as very very young at heart. Maybe I am harsh, but he is legally an adult earning big money and has massive community clout. He has responsibility and needs to wake up.

Nearly a 1000 children have been detained in Hong Kong. These kids are much younger than Thijs and are risking their lives for freedom.

Activision isn't some new company that is going to be price sensitive to events like this. Investors will trust the long financial history and assume they can weather this storm out. Most likely they'll wait for quarterly reports. If enough people dropped Blizz they'll take the hit then.

Really important to highlight this I appreciate what you are doing
---
Karmawhore more sure that will fix everything
---
Ah I can't find it now, but I was pretty sure someone had more accurate numbers.
---
All I can find for certain is that Asia Pacific (encompassing China+Korea+Japan+Indonesia+Australia etc) is [12% of revenue](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial).
---
Many people are incorrectly reporting that as "12% of revenue came from China", but that's an upper limit where none of those other countries spend a cent. The Register [report](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/08/blizzard_beijing_ban/) less than 10%, but they're likely just extrapolating as well. I'd say 5% was understating though, they probably represent over half of the region (6-9%).
---
I think instead of pressuring them to stop, we need to pressure them to voice their opinions. People like Thijs are just acting like nothing is happening and that's the real problem. Most people understand that they're not going to give up their entire careers because the company that owns the game they play did something immoral. However, not speaking about it might as well be an endorsement to their behavior. More people who are important to the Blizzard ecosystem need to speak out against this. Kibler and Toast have done great things with their statements. Bellular and Asmongold, from the wow community, have both spoken about it. We need a larger percentage of them to speak up.
---
As someone also in QA and who has played Borderlands 3, you can see the areas they've done extensive testing and areas that they've been a bit negligent about. I believe when developing the game they created the Story and Map first, way before the characters, so the characters dialogue fits into areas of the map and story, not the other way around. This means QA have had a lot longer to go through the maps, playtest environmental bugs, story triggers and assets. I have also yet to notice any guns bugging out, so they've probably been fairly extensively tested.
---
The areas that are bug ridden are performance (often when more than 1+ players is active) and several of the character skills. I imagine this is because the skills are one of the last things worked on, QA have had the least amount of time to work with them, and quite possibly it fell into the "nice to have" pile if they were having actual game-threatening issues like working on the epic store, server issues or incompatibility issues on some platforms.
---
A characters skill not working properly might seem really important to the player, but it's pretty low down in terms of actual priorities, and they have a finite QA team size and time.
---
No, of course not.
---
It literally takes nothing away to be able to use golden Doom in Tomb cards in standard. It's just lazy that you can't switch. Nobody is complaining about people getting to try them for free...

It this a out of season April fools joke?

Hahah. You make it sound as if it was Blizzard direct who passed the law causing the protests in HK.

Totally agree. How embarrassed must the big heads at blizzard be after seeing the reactions

Dude you're trying so hard to make them sound evil. I give up.

---
&gt;China is a long term bad investment
---
How could one even slightly think that could be the case. They're the biggest economic superpower in the game right now, and they're only seizing more power by economically taking over other country's through investments.
---
*Even in the context of games* this isn't accurate.
---
What does the populus turn to in times of political unrest? Coping mechanisms to make them happier such as games. What games are the most accessible? Phone games. 
---
The chinese mobile game market is also totally different from ours. Our most popular games are casual shit like Candy Crush, their most popular games are more serious like League of Valor (and soon to be Teamfight Tactics lol). They also spend TONS of money on games in comparison to other country's, it's kind of a more "flex" culture.
---
Blizzard's current market penetration in China is very low for what it should be. Their recent ventures into the mobile market have been successful and lucrative. Their current market penetration for NA has almost peaked - their growth hasn't be as large as they hoped. It's more beneficial for them to focus their efforts on a country that have more potential customers in a more lucrative market, even if they lost a small margin of people from these protests.
---
Though, I don't know how successful this protest is. They have the numbers. Personally, I think it's the right move *for Blizzard* to side with the Chinese here, but I don't think it's the right move morally in any regard.
---
*promotes you to head of hr*
---
 ...This all literally started from a player saying: 
---
&gt; "I support everyone willing to fight for freedom and democracy" or something?"
---
So yeah. A bunch to lose, taking a stance might hurt his streaming career and future relationships with blizzard. Given that Thijs' main popularity comes from hearthstone, it doesn't take a genius to know that he risks a lot if he picked a solid side (Blizz or Community).
---
Five Demands, Not One Less.
---
Im also having this problem, on NA
---
Thank you, I am super happy I made this comeback. I was about to concede until I saw he was missing 1 damage and DIDN'T play supercollider.

---
So I wasn't the only one? I don't even know why it hit me so much. All I know I'm thinking that he's just repeating what Kibler said and all of a sudden I'm all emotional.
---
Brilliantly written.

This was a joke. Or a blatant insult thrown into community face.

Apologies, for not mentioning it tho, but I totally agree with this guy's outrage.

Hi everyone,

You could also use a free app like [tapmydata.com](https://tapmydata.com) to send all these requests. It's a simple, easier and automated way to send subject access requests to organisations.

Blizzard features on the app and it's free to use for anyone. Available on Apple and Android plus they don't collect or hold any personal data.

Just a thought and could save everyone some time :)

Every Voice Matters
---
For sure. All my IRL friends I've talked to think taking away Blizzchung's tourney winnings was a dick move but none goes as far as these posts on all these subs. It definitely feels like it's the same group of people (who may or may not even play Blizzard games) who are upvoting all these HK support posts.
---
They announced Diablo for mobiles. Which resulted in outburst in gaming community.
---
It certainly got you talking about it a lot everywhere ;)
---
Maybe you'll accidentally inform some new people about the struggles in Hong Kong with all your pessimistic posts about how nobody does anything good enough to please you.
---
Free Hong Kong! *Logs into WoW*
---
The second part is obviously a tongue in cheek joke, even if they reversed the ban he's probably not coming back, he enjoys TFT way more right now and gets a similar amount of viewers.
---
Blizzard now becomes a disgusting company. Double standard, and a hypocrite.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the Communist Party of China's various shell companies were buying big to try and "counter" the outrage and make it
---
This is no reason to stop voting with your wallet. I'm still not going to ever again support a company that turns a blind eye to people who are being cut open alive for their organs and being put in camps, or Hong Kong's struggle.
---
Literally only Reddit and Apple are the 2 companies I personally use from that list.
---
I swapped my shoes from Nike’s to Sketchers.
---
Had an iPhone prior to the protests, but I’m not buying anything through their App Store anymore.
---
Reddit is the other I use, because they might have gotten money from Tencent, but talking pro-democracy isn’t getting anyone banned.
---
I’m taking the car to go snowboarding this year, rather than the plane I initially had planned.
---
wow that's so smart of you to say, let me just go drop out of this quarter and buy a plane ticket with all this college student money I have
---
People are definitely not inherently bad for wanting to have a fun Blizzcon, no.  However, those same people don’t get to continue to claim outrage and anger at the direction of the company while doing nothing to beyond hand-wringing to show the company that they are upset.
---
Without question, if Blizzcon goes off with a vast majority of the attendees treating it like it’s the same old Blizzcon, the company will know they might the right decision here. They may hire some well-paid PR person to find ways to candy-coat these sort of things in the future, but they will keep on the path they are on because the fan base will have shown that they don’t “actually” care about any of this.
---
So, again, no- trying to have a fun Blizzcon doesn’t make someone a bad person. But doing so and thinking that their inaction doesn’t mean something is naive.
---
Lol your username tells everything about you
---
I have zero doubt Activision is sleazy enough to buy reviews.
---
Weak effort.
---
fuck HKers fuck china fuck blizzard and fuck human rights. Let's talk about HS
---
Blizzard is actively and openly censoring free speech and supporting the oppression human rights, Reddit is not.
---
this is just karma farming at this point.
---
When did AB become Activision blizzard and not Antonio brown?
---
Also GGG is owned by Tencent and will likely go down the same path as AB...
---
Blizzard is gonna try and ride this out and pretend it never happened. Let’s not allow them to do it.
---
I get what you mean, but I disagree that we should let it pass, just so people can keep their jobs. It sucks for those people in particular and they are largely innocent, but I want principled morals coming first. Just because Blizzard has "hostages", doesn't mean they are worthy of my continued support. Same thing with content creators, I stop consuming all of them now to not indirectly support Blizzard anymore.  
---
Also, Blizzard has shown blatant disregard for their employees this year with the massive lay off. They cut off hundreds of jobs, despite growth, so I don't trust them in regards to worker treatment either.
---
Almost like politics should not be welcome in (e)sports
---
oww cmon with your god damn logic, i just crafted a new tin-foiled hat... :-P
---
But yeah, you are totally right, they work together and obviously spoke about that matter with each other... they probably even drafted their texts together. It's definitely not Blizzard or even China forcing them, it's more the community forcing them to take a stand and thus they do...
---
Bullshit. 
---
If Blitzchung had said “there is only one China and the Chinese people support Xi Jing Ping!”
---
Do you think the Chinese authorities would have demanded blizzard take action? Do you think Blizzard would have done more than it originally did by warning people not to bring politics into the tournament?
---
If one of the players said “Support Crimea!” Do you think a loss of all winnings and a one year ban would have been levied? No, because Russia is not an important market for Blizzard.
---
Blizzard is no victim.
---
Hong Akon gets is a victim.
---
The population of Hong. Kong are victims.
---
Blitzchung is a victim.
---
Yes keep links to the statements of the many people who have taken a stand (Hearthstone Personalities, US Senators, Norwegian MP's), while at the same time having "new" section which includes any new statements since the last post.
---
I ended up 4 minutes over the goal, second to last boss took forever reving the best reborn minion ever turn
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/de1ysj/china_accused_of_genocide_over_forced_abortions/f2tzhxi
---
Blizzcon is not cheap either
---
By posting shit on forums and upvoting posts you are doing completely nothing to support them.
---
I mean it's a pretty easy job when you can shove it in a megathread and freeze new posts.
---
Stepping down is actually a smart move for some casters. Because part of what Blizzard will most likely try to do to be able to show its face again is reuniting with casters, streamers etc. This in turn means they will most likely sit at the table with better leverage than before and ultimately strike better deals with Blizzard. 
---
That's what I'm hoping for. I'm also hoping for people to be fired at Blizzard/Activision, the ones responsible for those decisions leading to the latest scandal.
---
Also very admirable of Admirable.
---
Bad take! Being a freeloader doesn't really help Blizzard any significant amount. Huge difference between that and continuing to *spend money* on Blizzard products.
---
The OP's suggestion to continue playing but put your $80 per expansion to charity will do *vastly* more good than this doom and gloom shit.
---
If you want to build a successful movement, it is actively unhelpful to criticize people for not going the absolute farthest they could possibly go to help the cause. This will just cause people to burn out and leave the movement, and you'll be left with a small movement that can't accomplish much. It's much more productive to encourage people to help out, but also not get upset at people who want to, at the same time, take care of themselves and enjoy their own lives.
---
Unless, of course, your goal is just to *sound* as morally righteous as possible, irrespective of whether that's what's best for Hong Kong.
---
Having a policy that prohibits political statements/activism isn't anywhere close to Blizzard supporting Chinese Oppression.
---
These types of policy are commonplace in most major organizations. No religious messages, no politics, etc. They are enforcing these policies to avoid conflicts of interest in the best ways they can. It doesn't matter how passionate about the topic someone is. If it violates the ToS, Code of Ethics, or doesn't align with the company's missions statement it gets taken down.  It is a simple concept. 
---
Personally, I support Hong Kong and I support their cause. I also support Blizzard's decision to remove the player and anyone else they see fit. Blizzard is in the entertainment industry. They do not host livestreams and tournaments for people to make statements that are unrelated to gaming or their products. Contrary to what the current majority on this sub will have you believe, most of Blizzard's viewers/subscribers are also fairly uninterested in those messages as well and would rather just watch the game.
---
Clearly I know nothing about that tournament. I thought they showed the sign because they had already lost the game and had nothing left to lose.
---
Thanks for re-educating me in this difficult time, China! :)
---
But like I said, it is a double standart regardless
---
It's more like letting the devs decide whether they want add certain themes in games or not. So that you can vote with your dollar. If you like these themes, you buy the game. If you don't like - you don't buy. As for now we don't have much choice, because it's not us who decides.
---
Oh, I wasn't talk about how easy it was relative to the pay, just the moral bankruptcy of it.
---
More like 5%
---
And you're not doing any better, either.
---
At least the people that uninstalled stopped contributing to a company that censors free speech and encourages violating human rights
---
This needs to survive until Blizzcon
---
I don't have a ticket
---
...political drama...
---
&gt; Except the Hearthstone Collegiate Championship has the exact same rule that was used to penalize Blitzchung. From the 2019 Hearthstone Tournament Player Handbook:  
---
Wrong, the GM league has it's own rulebook:  
---
[2019 HEARTHSTONE® GRANDMASTERS OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES v1.4](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/w4/W4NWIBHB74T31564507077190.pdf)  
---
And from the GM rulebook rule 6.1 (o) is not the same as the rule you linked:  
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damage’s Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.  
---
The 2019 Hearthstone Tournament Player Handbook doesn't list clear punishment for breaking rule 6.3 (b) as the GM rule 6.1 (o) has, even though both do include the "public disrepute" words.  
---
Also on Tespa's own site:  
---
&gt; This brief overview is not intended to replace the Official Tournament Rules, which can be found [here](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/98/98EP04HKUVE91565623454873.pdf).  
---
Only mention of the Player Handbook at Tespa's site or the HCC Fall 2019 rulebook is here:  
---
&gt;All matches will take place in best-of-5, Conquestand the Standard format for deckbuilding. A player wins a best-of-5 match when they accumulate 3 game wins in that match. For more information regarding Conquest rules, see the Hearthstone Tournament Player Handbook [here](http://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/px/PXYB9IHSRQLF1564507343607.pdf). Conquest format follows these rules:  
---
So only mention of the Player Handbook is used to source about format discussion, in no other place is there any mention of the Player Handbook.  
---
Though if any Tespa players can show they had to agree to the more General Player Handbook as well when signing up, we can maybe expand the discussion.  
---
Also in your link on the punishment at 7.14 is says:  
---
&gt; Punishments **may include**, but are not limited to the following:  
---
Which is very different from:  
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image **will result in** removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.  
---
GM rules allow no leeway if it is determined that the incident caused public disrepute, even if looking at it the punishment might seem harsh, hence a lesser protest at HCC (with even if the Player Handbook was applied) doesn't mandate as harsh as a penalty (a thing everyone complained in the Blitzchung case).  
---
So yes, this is just peolpe being mad because they want to be mad.
---
Why he had to be Tibetan then? It mainly takes in Nepal so just have him be Nepali and we're done. Granted, the movie version certainly is unique in her own way.
---
I have..  I know about it.  Do you know how I know you don't?  
---
You haven't addressed 1 single argument of mine.  Not one.  You reacted emotionally.  You reacted without any proof or discourse.  
---
Thus you reacted to cognitive bias.  
---
Now prove me wrong. Here's what you have to do.  
---
Go back to my original comment and reply intelligently with rational discourse and not "ermagerd you don't know cognitive bias".  
---
I did with my reply.  You haven't.
---
We need to be active in the chat when they stream blizzcon
---
Nepali perhaps?
---
I suggest everyone does the same this Saturday, 7pm gmt
---
In the long run it depends on artificial intelligence and technological revolution.That will change the structure of [geopolitics.So](https://geopolitics.So) I appreciate Andrew Yang for his far-sight.But now I can just keep cautious optimism.
---
Actually we know the protesting in HK is started with non-violent cooperation in June but end up with violence now,that push majority of chinese to support China [government.At](https://government.At) first China could only block the web for separate Chinese from HK,it was afraid of that Chinese would give sympathy.But when it came to violent China opened the web and reported only violence,then nationalism aroused.
---
I do expect that Carrie Lam can compromise on some demands to appease HK protestors.But I'm sure that radical containment from western world will scare China and HK government and they will act more conservative.What I don't want to see most is it become another 1989.The correct way in my opinion is just keep denouncing by official voice.If everyone joined the protesting,it will make China become unpredictable.
---
What the fuck does this have to do with having business with China?
---
I give your post a tiananmen square/10
---
Tell that to Zalae
---
Good for him.
---
No. This statement needs to be made. Messing up a few weekends is an easily justifiable cost.
---
That's a weird statement to make... And one people like me are tired of.

Not a bug. It's a choice if you don't want anything added to your deck if the other choices are bad.
---
I care since the beginning, i would care after. If you dont care is fine i already told you. Just dont complain. Love russian people you have the best videos on the youtube 😂😂😂
---
That's still anecdotal, I used to crash every hour for a few leagues (played since beta) but now the game works smoothly... But I don't go and post about it ont he poe subreddit so you and others won't know.
---
Ofc I know there are a lot of tech issues with the game and they do need to fix them.
---
Youre the reddit equivelant of thoughts and prayers. Youre not changing anything, youre making it worse.
---
The problem here is that there was a lot of misinformation regarding the two casters. They encouraged the player to say the 8 words (free Hong Kong..) and then after he did, ducked under the table for whatever reason. So it's not like the caster did nothing, they practically broke the same rule. This was mentioned in most of the posts talking about the casters but none of the posts edited them into the main text for whatever reason.
---
Which is why it's incredibly important to force their hand now.
---
tHiS
---
thats not how double standard work...
---
&gt;a rule or principle which is unfairly applied in different ways to different people or groups.
---
the rule isnt applied to the social media post so there isnt double standard between the 2 situation he posted
---
Making a scene might give you what you want initially, as you'll get the attention you want your cause to have. But Blizzard doesn't really care what people think of them, they care about how much money people can make them.  Because of this, the only real way to actually upset or effect Blizzard would be to stop buying any and all of their products. You cannot say you don't agree with or support a company and then go ahead and still buy their shit; that would just make you two-faced.
---
Which is fair play to them. I enjoy their casting. And they've specifically stated what they think. 
---
It will be interesting to hear if they're given more matches after this season though as Lorinda hasn't casted for a while and there are ready made replacements, him being just one.
---
They all said they would fulfill contractual obligations. After that, who knows?
---
This comment only purpose is to maintain in life this thing

Ok thoughts and prayers man.

Wtf is wrong with these companies just censoring individual reviews
---
self posts don't give karma retard
---
It doesn't make you a good person either.
---
Honestly, it's his choice, we live in a free society - luckily, but with success comes responsibility. He is not only part of the community, he is a figurehead, whether he likes it or not. His actions reflect and carry.
---
Do you think Kibler likes where he is? Do you think Kibler enjoys losing a great caster position? Kibler is being socially responsible. Now I don't expect Thijs to go as far as Kibler - not everyone has that much moral fiber, but completely blocking any conversation and putting your head in the sand says a lot about how much you really care about others - not just your typical appreciation for donations and subs.
---
In this current day and age inaction and suppression is a political stance too. It may seem unfair but it is the reality.
---
Would anyone else be interested in protesting outside of Blizzcon if they haven't apologized and made things right? I'll be in LA for the last day of Blizzcon for unrelated reasons, but I would definitely spend a few hours outside with a big signeith Mei and the seven words.
---
The Guardian is known to promote censorship in other instances, this reeks of hypocrisy.
---

&gt;he problem was (and is) in severe punishment to casters
---
They were pretty damn unprofessional
---
No

&gt; me giving my ten cents
---
The expression is actually two cents. I guess your employer is on your mind a lot right now.
---
Yet you still wrote this on a phone/pc made in china.
---
Only way it will hurt is if the miss the deadline and hit by fines for breaching GDPR, but if they can prove that this is a concentrated effort to make them breach the regulations I'm sure the data compliance office will take that into account
---
Free Hong Kong! Kick out all those Chinazi shit.
---
Very valid points. Maybe what I'm am trying to say is corporations shouldn't be controversial? Like what does a gaming company have to do with a revolution? Nothing. So why should they be getting involved? I feel like Nintendo is the best at this. They keep it strictly about the games.
---
What about OW then? That game simply happens to prove Blizz is still capable of making great things. Sure, it's not perfect but it's still a joy to play indeed.
---
I wouldn't be so sure.
---
Nobody said anything about China in the original post; you are the one who mentioned that. I was just describing one way that a company can be forced to consider the long term effects of their actions through a systemic change rather than 'infringing on their freedom'.
---
Isn’t that like DLC
---
Just be sure to keep up the hilarious Engrish
---
While I don’t endorse their silence on the matter, Blizzard has not posted any apology to China. The Hearthstone Weibo account is run by NetEase. 
---
I hope Blizzard has some kind of response soon instead of this apparent strategy of waiting until it blows over.
---
[This is not the case though.](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1182409678371934212?s=19)
---
It doesn't get taken down if it violates TOS. Unless it does get taken down.
---
&gt; Blizzard's viewers/subscribers are also fairly uninterested in those messages
---
That's so sad. They should care about things that matter all the time. It's wonderful having principles that don't depend on what you're watching. Otherwise you're just watching circuses.
---
The casters were in on the protest. They knew what the player was going to do and even told him to "say his 7 words" (liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times). For me it is the opposite, ending their cooperation with the casters makes much more sense than the harsh ban they handed out to the player. It make sense for the casters to be under stricter rules than the participant.
---
One deck ,Two classes
---
Mum said it's my turn on the karma

Free Gaza from Israeli tyranny!

Liberate Palestine in our time!
---
Give CCP time to fix everything is obviously impossible.I am telling you that nationalists and CCP are not stand together.There is space for us to lead nationalist be punished by CCP.If CCP and nationalists go to conflict there are opputunities for a breakthrough in HK.
---
asking for actual elections is not the same as separatism
---
Are you OK?
---
Did your mom sleep with someone else?
---
LOLOL
---
What's the reference here with the pickaxes
---
In what way do you think Blizzard got the message?
---
Very nice Jessica !!!! Master Xi and Communist party happy long time you post to distract and deflect. Please make post to try and get more subscriber, you check will be deposit shortly !!!!
---
If anyone is actually boycotting BlizzCon I will gladly take your ticket.
---
Yeah, right... Look, I am still playing HS and OW no matter what. I won't let such silly things taint my games no matter what. There's after all very little we can do about the situation at hand. Unlike them, I'm in no way delusional here.
---
Hearthstone is a very fine game. Very fine. Made by a great dev. Just great.
---
&gt; Yeah yeah sure downvote me I hope you all cowards actually prove me wrong, go to blizzcon and security shoots up all of you.
---
&gt; I hate you all SIEG HEIL
---
Oof
---
It's not just a company abiding its own rules, as has been stated repeatedly, the heavy handed overreaction by blizzard is the problem
---
What sort of class action can be taken against Blizzard because they banned someone who, from their perspective at least, broke the rules he agreed to?
---
&gt;seeing people be passionate about something
---
Yeah lol the top few comments are mostly geniune, some might be paid, and down there in the filth are buttloads of people who blurt out "fuck CHINA" or "free hk" typing on their chinese phones into a partially chinese owned website.
---
 What i find funny tho is that the protests are going on for a while now, but reddit only really picked up the pace when NBA and Blizzard got controversially involved, someting that the typical redditor can connect to.
---
 And other subs joined soon to the fiesta with posts for karma, but somehow a Blizzard comment is always near the top comments. Its like people care more about Blizz than the actual HK protests.
---
Please explain to me what exactly the casters did to warrant the punishment, because the accounts of them asking him to say what he wants to say as part of the interview seem completely detatched from the scale of the punishment imposed?
---
And why are you defending company that so gladly supports slaughter of innocent people, rather than help them in their fight for freedom?
---
Oh Blizzard was definitely within their rights to fire the casters. They were both incredibly unprofessional. If this was a different issue which directly targeted Western or American audiences, people would be saying the least Blizzard could do is fire the caster to make sure everyone knows this isn’t something Blizzard supports.
---
Oh right! I didn't failed to mention it, because I know where it was. But that doesn't change anything. Rules are rules. Are you saying that if it happened elsewhere, they wouldn't had the same attitude ( based on their Rules ) , towards the band? That's conspiracy theory 101%.
---
Beautiful
---
Oh, bother...
---
Really want to protest? Don't go to blizzcon, don't subscribe to WoW and stop buying their games and microtransactions. 
---
Holding up signs and making posts online while still giving them money is hypocritical.
---
Also, read their annual report it'll tell you what their up to when it comes to more games none of us want.
---
Traveling to China and physically and actively protesting for the stuff you are talking about on the internet in som random hearthston forum/reddit. Because doing or saying stuff on the internet won‘t change a thing in China.
---
Direct your outrage at capitalism. No corporation would pass up on profit to advance human rights. They are not our friends. They will let you suffer if it saves them a cent. Child labor. Genocide. Bleeding us dry for healthcare. More and more money and power to the 1%. Destruction of the planet. All incredibly profitable. It can’t continue forever. It is good to see people begin to get upset for the right reasons. Don’t forget why this is allowed to happen.
---
Now, that’s different,  and I didn’t mention that since most people aren’t even doing that, if you cared so much you will be posting links to where you can do that.
---
Thought “boycotting” a company won’t do shit, since their main market is China. Did you like, think about it?

How to get a sub on everyone's block filter.

Go back to school

Direct support of the protests is the only way for them to get my business back. After this, there's no way I'm supporting them while they're on good terms with the Chinese gov.
---
I WAS the same type of Hearthstone player as I was as a Magic Player. Play my own game and my own deck and grumble about netdeckers under my breath when I come against 2-4 turn kill, aggro decks.

I’m suprised they haven’t just set up a filter yet
---
The sub is literally unusable for HS discussion because the company did an oopsie. I think that's retarded. You can call me a shill but a shill for what? I don't care about this situation, I just want to browse a gaming subreddit  for the purpose it was made for.
---
I can say with certainty that the sub gave few fucks about hong kong before the drama and now it's all it can talk about
---
While I agree that the side to choose is easy, that doesn't mean it is acceptable to bring that stance onto a live broadcast representing a company who has asked you not to bring personal stances to their broadcast.
---
If you are truly upset at Blizzard for wanting to stay neutral as a company, then you need to boycott 95% of items and businesses in America since most everything has ties to China and most everything is made in China. While I don't agree with what China is doing, I have no issue with a company staying neutral on this, or anything else.
---
&gt; If this was a pro China move that got banned nobody would care
---
If it was a pro North Korea move that got someone banned no one would care. If it was a pro Erdogan move no one would care. If it was a pro Maduro move no one would care.
---
You know why. You might disagree. You might not care. But you know why.
---
If this was a pro China move Blizzard wouldn't have cared.
---
You're correct that noone would care if this was a pro China move that got banned, and that's simply because the spirit of the Hong Kong protests is something a lot of people can get behind.
---
Blizzard are not just exercising their right to keep political speech off of their platform, but they are bending over backwards to satisfy the desires of a government that restricts the freedoms of it's people.
---
It's hardly surprising that between a peaceful protest movement that just wants the freedoms you and I enjoy, and an authoritarian government that routinely suppresses it's own people and is making a concerted effort to influence western media, people want to support the former.
---
Besides if this were an actual pro China political message, Blizzard would have never have banned it, which is entirely the point.
---
If I had gold to give, this would get it
---
Let's be real: this isn't going to go anywhere. Lots of kids on Reddit will upvote this and virtue signal on Reddit, but I would bet that VERY FEW people have cancelled subscriptions, not enough for Blizzard to notice or care. 
---
Blizzard supposedly has a major game announcement coming by Blizzcon, and if it's something people really want, all will be forgiven.
---
Play Blizzard games = support CCP.
---
Saronite Chain Gang sound effects.
---
despite calling for a calm discussion,I still don't call for slient.It Blizzard who deserve it.They brought politics and they pay for it.
---
I had give up Hearthstone for two years for it was running like a pay2win mobile game.But I didn't expect "do you guys no have phones?"and bowing to Chinese capitalists today.Blizzard always suprise me.
---
Account created 5 months ago, first comment 8 days ago. Suss as fuck.
---
They apologized to China. Lol, how much does blizzard pay you? I have to know so I can make the smart decision to turn down lots of money in light of being an actual decent human being. Seriously, did you not read your own message before you posted and realize how much of a HUGE FUCKING SHILL you are?
---
Don't let a chinese Joker be born !!
---
He’s from r/sino, he’s view is already warped.
---
Honestly if people in Hong Kong can go everyday on the streets for four months then I can at least spit in Blizzards face once a day for the rest of my life.
---
I love blizzard!!! They did nothing wrong!!! I love hearthstone!!! Democracy bad!!!
---
I don’t even play Hearthstone, but I proudly stand with all of you and for FREEDOM. FREE HONG KONG
---
Then you should throw all your stuff away cause these have chinese parts in it. Every PC, every phone. I dare you.
---
Exactly. Gave me a chance to actually reflect on what I was supporting.
---
Except... it wont :)
---
Contract breaking is not real reason, thats just statement they try get away with this thing. You can see that from international statement vs china statement. Only first states contract breaking as reason(not that it would even count as political drama)
---
Fuck blizzard. Fuck the chinese Gov't. Xi wears lipsrick.
---
I get that this is a Hearthstone forum, but considering what this ruckus is ultimately about, don't you think it'd be a nice idea to link a charity or two where people can contribute directly to helping the HK protesters?

[Hong Kong Free Press](https://www.hongkongfp.com/support-hkfp/) (reporting actual facts in Hong Kong)
---
[612 Humanitarian Fund](https://www.dimsumdaily.hk/612-humanitarian-relief-fund-set-up-by-civilians-to-cover-legal-expenses-of-arrested-protesters-who-are-charged/) (legal and medical expenses of portesters)
---
Play the game, play any game you already own and use the content you own, if you care to "protest" in anyway, id say just stop buying, play hearthstone all day long if you want, dont buy packs, people around here expect instant results for some reason, and its not happening, so go ahead and take your time playing the games
---
Blizzard is just another company where money speak the loudest. We blame them for what they did, but it was natural based on the fact of how large the company is, and how strongly it will grab on to money.
---
Makes you wish money and politics didn't walk side by side.
---
No need to thank me, but you're welcome all the same.
---
You have to pledge your loyalty to Mao Zedong for it to show up
---
Counterpoint:  Their response has already been made, and you shouldn't hear out anything new they try to spin.  If you do business in China, you *must* do business with the Chinese government.  As long as they are in the Chinese market, they will be influenced by the Chinese government.  Until either they decide to abandon that market or the Chinese government decides to change its ways (lol), you should not trust any promises they make to change.  To take an apology to do better in the future would be total naivete.
---
conspiracy theorist
---
The example are there because you know them.  Too many just not on news because if everyone is allowed to do that, the sports show will becomes a shitshow.
---
As a Chinese citizen, I see no problem of having a sub called anit\_US. So your country is starting a trade war and you want my good attitude? No way
---
Look towards human rights injustices back home and rise up against your own government. You might be able to make some changes closer to home than you would in China.
---
dont forget to throw away all ios devices
---
What a wuss... Look, I get it if you hate Blizz cuz of China. But honestly, all I can think of you is that you're nothing but bunch of delusional idiots thinking that your actions actually matters.
---
Protest will already be out the front, that is already being planned.
---
People are talking about hiding costumes under clothes. Is blizzard going to clothes check everyone? All it takes is one voice during the AMA to say something on live stream for it to be disrupted. We don't need a question read out, we just need people to have their voices heard inside if only for a minute.
---
Have faith.
---
I wish gamers gave as much a shit about female, gay, and trans rights as they did about this issue.
---
Yes, but the economic situation will sharply decline and, as the OP said, if the collapse is not conducted peacefully we might have Civil War, separatism or pocket revolutions in our way. In any case, it will take decades for the Chinese market to recover, since it is already proven that market reforms do not mean an easier transition to full market economy after a communist system collapses. 
---
Weirdly enough, the only way that the Chinese have to maybe delay the collapse is by trying to go back from a "post-totalitarian" system to a full fledged one, and that will mean the end of operations of foreign companies in China anyway.

---
That's exactly what I'm saying, though. Boycotting the company entirely makes a much more obvious show than just complaining about it.
---
People can whine all they want, but if they keep playing blizzard games, keep buying blizzard products and inwardly supporting them, they'll stay in power and keep defending scumbag companies like tencent and countries that treat...well everyone like waste.
---
Man, I thought maybe the last paragraph of my comment was too obvious to include but threw it in, yet here we are.
---
I will reiterate, this is not all or nothing, something is better than nothing.
---
Let’s see how long Blizzard playing the silent card
---
This is a different case. Blizzard requires you to provide identification when you are deleting an account because you know, if not someone could log in and delete you account.
---
OP is mad because he has to provide an ID of him being the actual owner in order to delete his account.
---
Lol grats on going masks off and just saying you were lying about agreeing with the protestors. You're mega worm brained.
---
I am not technically correct. I am literally correct. And doesn't change anything that they got fined 2 days later, or in the same day. They still applied their Rules. They stood strong in this matter and others, which also happened within Eurovision and they had the same exact approach. 
---
Now, I won't comment if you see or not Eurovision as an exemple, because we are going into the...conspiracy theories, which are bad for brain ( in general ). 
---
Point is, rules are rules. Keep shit politics elsewhere.
---
If you care that much go and protest with the others out in the street. The Chinese gov. couldn't care less about someone's legendary collection of cards getting dusted (how ridiculous does that even sound?)
---
Depends on where they were pushing their message. Professional broadcasts need to stay professional and the message had no place on hearthstone masters. As I have already said multiple times, the punishment was completely deserved.
---
And in all this, just a friendly reminder that Thijs was better positioned than most to do the same but chose the complete opposite route and should be vilified for it.  This has really shown his lack of character.
---
The first reports of why they ducked off screen was to cut the stream to commercial so did they have that power or not and if not they sure as hell had the ability contact someone that did. 
---
Maybe they didn't need firing but any company the size of blizzard would have done the same in their situation regardless of actual political standing to stay neutral
---
Only thing I want to point out is number 1. Number 1 is counter productive, both because people tend to ignore obvious review bombing and most stores, as I've recently learned in this sub no less, actually have counters for review bombing. So it's a waste of time. Rest seems solid though.
---
He's huge. He brings blizzard money. Tons of people care what he does
---
Same here. There are core values, that matter to me. Freedom of speech is one of them. I'm from Germany, with a german mother and a syrian father and even though, I was too young to remember the times, when my country was divided, I know one thing for sure:  we live in a dangerous world, if we will be punished for our thoughts and hopes. Blitzchung did demonstrate peacefully. He only wants to live in a free world. To censor these hopes are the worst sign they could send.
---
My father died four years ago in Syria. Hate, war and crimes against human rights are a huge part of my world, even though I'm lucky enough to live in Germany. But now I had to response to kids here, which told me, Im doing my little protest on Reddit because I want to farm karma. So ridiculous to read. I'm too old to even understand the koncept of digital karma. I believe in real Karma though. We all get what we deserve, sooner or later.
---
I guarantee Frodan does not comment on this. He hasn’t tweeted since it all went down. The funny part is that one of his last tweets mocked Trump.
---
Depends on the person.
---
&gt; Thijs is absolutely massive in China
---
Is he ? I thought twitch was banned in China?
---
If Blizzcon is streamed in China, that'd be the best way to go.
---
Yes, Blizz followed their own rules. And, yes, Blizz is also following the rules of the oppressive government and trying to please them, even if the cost is millions of lives that will be lost once Chinese government decides that he's had enough with those pesky protesters.
---
Do we have to continue supporting Blizzard after they showed to the world that they don't care about peoples lives and freedoms? No
---
Do we have to keep quiet and not call them out on their shitty decision-making?  Hell No!!! We're not in China and we can show Blizzard that, unlike them, we do give a fuck about what happens to HK people.
---
The Chinese government thanks you for your support
---
People like you are why dictatorships arise in the world.
---
Imagine if someone you invited into your home drug you into a battle you wanted nothing to do with and threatened your livelihood. Imagine how you would react. That’s what this situation is and it’s unrealistic to think that somehow a company that has a Chinese company as a large stake holder to just give way to any of this. It’s not their fight. 
---
Do I agree that they should take action? As an American I think we should all fight communism whenever it rears it’s ugly head. 
---
Did you care about it it any other time before now? No you didn’t you were complacent while they tortured and beat their people. While they force abortions on women who already had one child. While they censored their entire country from the world. Many many other atrocities that you ignored before. Don’t act like a freedom fighter now.
---
The examples are there because they were recorded, and broadcast during their day and age, and they were done so because they made waves at the time, and are remembered for posterity's sake. 
---
Plenty of athletes do what little they can by way of activism, whether it's wearing a shirt at a game, or sitting the game out or speaking out after it.
---
PS - Not my country, not an American.
---
Nah I agree with the desire to have freedom. I have freedom to do whatever I want, so that’s what I’ll do, but at least I’ll do it consistently. You’re illogical. And your life shows it.
---
I've uninstalled and deleted my account. Changed my review on the Play Store to 1* and explained why. I can't do much more, but they won't be getting any more money from me. Congratulations, Blizzard/Activision, you lost a whale.
---
I mean he literally said he'll return to HS so I think you would assume he didnt play anymore.
---
Hurting the bottom line of all companies that side with China would force them to rethink making so many concessions to China which would in turn weaken Beijing. Obviously I fully suggest sending letters to your local government as well asking them to speak out against China and in favor of HK and to make your stance known. But hurting companies can indeed help.
---
I wouldn't know what to do now If I would be them because in my eyes they can't win anymore.
---
Thanks for the discussion :)
---
Go look at the other top post on the sub.  The day 3 don't let this die one.
---
Yea calm down white knight
---
I'd rate it 2 stars and make your comments look legitimate
---
Still gonna hurt em and they might leave it
---
Oh we gone forget this real quick
---
in taiwan, it shows not found😢
---
How all things should be. Higher degree of publicity should mean higher punishment. Where I come from your simple family father will get fucked in prison for not paying taxes while the well known billionair pays a fee and moves on. That's fucked Up.
---
Says the mod used to deleting people's OC lolol get out of here
---
We stand with you, please know that. I'm doing everything I can to help you guys earn the freedom you rightfully deserve from so many thousand miles away. Americans, or well most at the very least, are on your side. This censorship is disgusting and really proves how abused Hong Kong is. I hope this can end peacefully soon enough, but I understand why the protests and happening and certainly are not mad at them. 
---
I'm here for you Hong Kong.
---
Sure, but the PC market is still pretty damn huge. Seems too early to me to completely ditch it.
---
Questions will be handpicked and they will just read them. Easy to do.
---
Hell, isn't that why Bin Laden was so angry at America? They promised to support him if he helps fight communism, and then just fucking bailed on him.
---
r/Blizzard mods have basically soft locked the entire subreddit, all posts must be moderator approved, as of time of writing (BST 14:01) no new posts other than the moderator sticked posts have been up for 11 hours. Keep pressure on Blizzard corporation and r/Blizzard sub through any way you can!
---
Because all they want to do is complain
---
Bobby kotick was in jeffery epstein's blackbook and is part of the pedophile elite.
---
Your comment is the only thing coming across as attention whoring here buddy 😬
---
It's not just about one guy and losing their money.  It's about China censoring America's art and speech.  You should check out that South Park episode on it.
---
With all the publicity this is getting the numbers are up, and tbh twitch making the most of it with ad’s much more often.
---
Everyone is bad regardless of actions if you assume their motives are profit and nothing more
---
I uninstalled the Blizzard launcher on my PC yesterday and deleted the HS app on my phone.
---
I'd been playing Hearthstone since January 2015 and having just gone through my transaction history I'm actually shocked and ashamed over how much money I've spent on this game.
---
My Hearthstone expenditures amount to €1640 in total - the large majority went to my own account but I also gifted some stuff here and there to friends.
---
Holy shit balls MacGuyver, I'm quitting cold turkey.
---
Unless things drastically change, Blizzard isn't getting another penny from me.
---
https://imgur.com/4i1l0uB
---
I'm sure some are, but either way it's not a healthy way to express your feelings, since it can so easily be misinterpreted and cause unnecessary discomfort. I'm just asking for a bit more of empathy.
---
I stand with Hong Kong!!!
---
You act like tencent owns reddit in its fucking entirety.
---
Because someone was trying to cash out on the drama. That app was not helping people in Hong Kong at all and 1 starring hearthstone will also not help Hong Kong. Rather than bitching about hearthstone, how bout you actually do something that will help spread the word rather than fuck blizzard reeeeeeee
---
Using their platform to announce politics is not ok. The fact people are raging about it is ignorant. If your business was on tv and an employee announced personal beliefs as something your company backs how would you feel about that employee? Nbd he can say whatever he wants? Or no this isnt his company to use for his personal beliefs.  Wake up
---
Have you seen the frontpage? Look at it and tell me we're deleting "every post"
---
Thread removed.
---
nah, it's both zonkyslayer
---
Hey, I’m gonna advise you to keep playing if it’s something that’s helping you heal.  Burn out is real in any kind of protest,  and there’s nothing to be gained from exhausting yourself physically and mentally.
---
If you’re feeling guilty playing the game,  there’s plenty of other ways you can support the riots.
---
1.we know these things（of course government wont report.......）on Weibo we have many accounts post these things everyday，but many things proved to be edited videoclip or fabricated lie，for example 8.31 massacre，these victimes have no family members or friends or even names......anyway，I think most chinese support a commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality，i dont know why hk government dont agree this......
---
2.sure they didnt，but many Chinese though our government did so bad in 1989，before hk’s protest.......since witnessed so many violence among hk’s protest，we believe our government did very well in suppressing that riot......and we also found out that western media is full of fake news......
---
3.I understand hk ppl want full-autonomous, but since hongkong is part of China，beijing will not agree a universal suffrage which cant ensure the leader loves China。I think both sides should compromise to solve this problem......
---
4.most chinese hope hongkong maintain western system, but not in this way. Smashing shops, disrupting traffic and beating people will only hurt Hong Kong people themselves，If they protest peacefully for 4 monthes ，I think many chinese will support them ......
---
Also, China isn't even "communist"
---
I agree please sell everything you have ^^^so ^^^I ^^^can ^^^them ^^^in ^^^two ^^^weeks ^^^for ^^^cheap
---
The money spent on this post, the device it was posted from, the chair you are sitting in and the shoes you are wearing gives China the money it needs to make tanks and fuel to run over a new generation of protesters.
---
And you act like they own Blizzard.
---
Companies are openly allowing China to oppress American free speech. Last time I checked that's the First Amendment.
---
At least in America

We dont have to ban everyone if we just shut down the stream, we smart :)
---
It's easy for nobodies like you and I to uninstall Hearthstone and make a statement.  Hearthstone is literally his job, armchair warriors are pressuring him to give up his primary source of income for something that, truly, has nothing to do with him.  Kibler made his statement but was still playing Hearthstone yesterday, I'm sure Kripp was too.  It's not his nor any other streamers obligation to make any sort of political statement if they don't want to.
---
Should have played around it.
---
exactly, im not sure what boycotting blizzard will do for the people in hong kong. even if blizzard switches sides, it will just fuck them more then it will help hong kong.
---
It's been the motto on this sub since the game existed, so it might as well expand out!
---
What a stupid fucking opinion.
---
Go play wizard poker then, you dont need to frequent the sub. Hearthstone is where it all started.
---
Huge monetary losses, yes. "Big points" doesn't mean more money. Actually, the opposite probably... It involves them being less greedy and doing the right thing. Often times in life that means you don't get as much material reward.  
---
Funny, I think it's actually your lack of reading comprehension that's confusing you. I didn't say I think they *will* apologize. I said that's what it would take.
---
Cmon man you cant be serious. Just for the record, I'm 28, not a kid.  What's wrong with me posting in this sub? I love HS. I don't know why you're coming at me. The guy literally said that the human rights violation going on "is dumb" and "he couldn't care less". Wouldn't that suggest to you that such an immature position on this human rights crisis that he's most likely about 10 to 13 years old? He can't grasp the gravity of the situation.
---
There is not a single thing here about trying to please some government, they took a very neutral stance of following the rulebook word by word when the incident happened.  
---
When in the AU case the the rules didn't state as clearly on what the punishment should be, they were more lenient and didn't bow to the oppressive government you claim they do.  
---
So facts point the other way in these cases, but people are just too stupid and emotional to see it.  
---
The real discussion should be that are the rules too harsh and in the future should they be changed, sadly someone has to be made an example first for people to wake up (but this person choose to do it out of his own free will).
---
Without a doubt. His regret likely has everything to do with his risk assessment prior to doing it.
---
I bet you were upset with Trump when he started the trade war...
---
See how quickly people’s opinions change when they see something they don’t like?
---
Trump may not be the best President, but he is the only one not bending the knee
---
But not from Blizzard.
---
This I absolutely agree with. The transition from innovator to establishment is complete. But it’s profits will no longer come from making killer games. It will come from marketing strategies.
---
Honestly, I hope not everyone that’s going to that event feels like you. Sitting down one on one with dev is the perfect opportunity to talk to them about putting more pressure on the people above them.
---
Worst case scenario you make them uncomfortable. That’s a small risk to take to maybe cause more friction between the people who didn’t create their mess and the people who did.
---
I’m not going to tell anyone how to use their ticket to that event, but asking them directly about this issue is an excellent idea.
---
Keep a tight watch on TikTok...it's a Chinese owned company too.
---
Thank you my friend, appreciate for all your support. And I just discovered the upvote percentage is not too friendly to me... Which subs is more appropriate for post like this? Sorry but I am not that familiar with all the subs and don't really know the way to go.
---
Acceptance, tolerance and diversity until it might lose them money
---
Fucking Hong Kong Police
---
Why come to his defense?
---
Where are you from?
---
What are your sympathies here?
---
Who are you?
---
Knowing corporate culture in Australia, more likely it was just those involved were friday-arvo smoko. Partially joking, but yeah. XD
---
It's maybe early, but we will see in the future.
---
Under this path I expect a grim future for Blizzard games
---
Nah. 
---
Censorship in the name of empathy is still censorship.
---
I'm sure the oppressed people of Hong Kong see you as a hero for your actions !
---
He said talk about
---
You expect people to give up their job in solidarity? Also the fact that he post in the donald is irrelevant
---
If there had been another game everyone migrated to while all of this was developing that's when real change would have happened. In fact, Reddit became what it is today partly due to a similar situation. DIGG was big and pissed off their user-base and people migrated to Reddit and DIGG died.
---
I did not know about that, looked it up and was disturbed...
---
How many of Blizzard's PR people do you think know Chinese? NetEase probably haven't even notified them on that text, and Blizz is probably staying away from negative news, so they most likely don't even know about it.
---
Hey man, heaps of us are standing with you. I'm not sure if this will last long term but the backlash to this is big. 
---
At the moment it is definitely having an effect.

good posts.
---
No. I play video games to *get away* from the horrible shit in the world. they’re an escape for me. 
---
I’ve been aware of how fucking awful China is for over 20 years. I try not to buy any goods manufactured in China, at all, when possible. Further, I try to be globally aware of any political leanings of companies in which I give my business above and beyond giving money to the Chinese economy. For example, I don’t shop at Victoria’s Secret or affiliated businesses because I don’t like the way the owner uses his profits. 
---
I have been keenly aware Blizzard does business in China. The events the rest of you are fucking clutching your god damned pearl necklaces over from this past week are seriously the fucking top of the iceberg of the ways companies regularly bend to the will of China to do business in China. No one even got physically hurt or detained in this case. 
---
Almost 2000 people have been arrested and detained over the last several months in the Hong Kong protests. A kid got blinded by being shot in the FACE. While people were marching the streets, a kid was playing *video games* for money. That kid lost his “job” and earnings and now the rest of you people are fucking woke. While that kid was playing video games, people were marching in the streets, being beaten. 
---
So don’t give me shit and accuse *me* or people like me who just want to play a video game or read a subreddit about it without having another sub’s newly found social justice alarm constantly ringing. 
---
If you want to be aware and make the world a better place, that’s fucking fantastic. But don’t limit your scope to Hong Tong, don’t limit your action to quitting Blizzard games, and don’t sit on a Chinese funded site like reddit to bitch about the atrocities of China.
---
why is it stupid
---
yes! only just found out myself
---
PC, mobile, and Switch!
---
So triggered by the truth lol.
---
Just a comment to that this gets bumped up. Great
---
What makes Blizzard so different?
---
I wasn’t seeking approval. I was seeking advice.
---
This isnt a sub about the geopolitical situation in china therefore it isnt the right place to talk about the HK protests. 
---
I'm sorry I dont like the sub turning into "China Bad give me upvote"
---
This is true. My 1 star rating from yesterday has been removed. Guess I'll repost it... Every day I have to.
---
Mate you are so fucking privileged it is insane.
---
I saw even big streamers Just fucking die because they decided to swith their main stream game.
---
Dyrus was a lol streamer who decided to take a break from league and went from 5k average to barely hitting a thousand on the good days. And then he decided to jump back into league his numbers never recovered.
---
Amaz lost so many viewers coz he started playing autochess games and still didnt recover.
---
Smaller streamers Just cant switch their main game on the fly unless they established themselves as a variety streamer.
---
Imagine the country or state you lived in did something horrible like blizzard did. Can you Just say, yeah okay i have been setting up a career on my job for a few years here, but i am ditching this shit, moving away and start over to like a quarter or even less.
---
If you think this is reasonable to Just forget any time investment you had into anything only because something out of your control happened you are extremely privileged and delusional.
---
Scanning your post history looking for posts about the human rights abuses in China from before 3 days ago.  Scanning.  Scanning.  Scanning...
---
It kinda looks like the x-box logo
---
sick burn  bro
---
This is disappointing because I admired him for his competency as a caster. I can understand his point of view but I do not agree with it
---
It has blizzard's name on it, if they dont agree with it, they should distance themselves from it.
---
Triggered by the truth of what?
---
Gwent is coming to iOS in two weeks.
---
It is a cool game. Highly recommend to try it since it is very f2p friendly. 😎👍
---
SPAM THIS GAY TO FREE HK!
---
Even if they are saying that I highly doubt the players are going to risk their careers. Hong Kong Esports is owned by Derek Cheung and he’s known to be pro China.
---
WITNESS ME
---
Let people play the game in peace if they enjoy it. Playing the game doesn't make you complicit.
---
Thanks for being awesome.
---
It's isn't about what you want it's about giving a pass to a company that is running point for a tyrannical government.  
---
Again though you obviously only care about yourself so I'm wasting my time.
---
Lol we got downvoted bro . I'm a pure gamer like you dude. 
---
I don't want any political things involved in games. 
---
People just don't freaking understand that unlimited politicalizing eventually ruins everything thus only pain and wrath of divided people remains.
---
Why can't let the game be the pure happy land far from politics?
---
&gt;Amd btw the big deal here is honkong situation, not destroying blizzard at any cost lol
---
Really?  Because that doesn't seem to be the focus here at all.
---
Because it works off of the premise that the sole reason that the guy posted this is to 'karmawhore'.
---
I don't post about it. I read as much as I can about it. I spoke up this time only because so many people were complaining in this thread. 
---
What's your point, anyways?
---
I can't take HK protest seriously because majority of people inside HK and outside HK who support HK's freedom are mum about East Turkmenistan. Not a single HKonger is in concentration camp. But millions of Muslims are put in concentration camps by China and thousands of them are being forcibly raped by Han pigs. So unless you guys support total and absolute freedom of Muslim in East Turkmenistan,  I can't support HKong. And if East Turkmenistan is to be subjugated by Han pigs, then so should Hong Kong be ruled by China and just as brutally if not more brutally. 
---
I hope East Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan gets absolute freedom. But if East Turkmenistan doesn't get your attention and freedom, then Hong Konger must also suffer under China. Else where in the world we want Palestine, Kashmir, Rankine state in Burma to get full and total freedom.
---
It's extremely easy to demand other people do something, knowing that you won't have too.
---
Why not have both a place to talk about the blitzchung situation and not disturb people that want to talk about hearthstone. By making a megathread
---
Oh absolutely i agree with you. There is a ton of overdramatic posts and karma whoring etc, but at the same time, I feel the amount of time that "china has been china" is irrelevent.
---
If there is a problem, any exposure is good exposure. Even if the posts are just meant to generate karma for an individual person, they still accomplish a bigger goal of making more people aware of the situation. Maybe that prompts people to buy less chinese products, etc.
---
I dont want to get into the ins and outs of this situation. My original point was really just meant to say "yeah there is a lot of karma whoring and hyperbole but complaining about it isn't going shut it down." Also wanted to point out the HS sub is actually pretty relevant to the issue
---
Hong Kong or Blizzard? I'm losing focus of the bigger issue with this post.
---
If you are about helping China, I would sugguest more attention to their cause.  Yes, Blizzard is a turd, but keep the importance of the big picture in perspective.
---
One last thing, you are concerned for Blizzard showing support for China.  That is excellent!  Arbitrarily though, didn't China big business buy some of Reddit last year?  I may be mistaken.  If they did buy some of Reddit, aren't we all in some way going against the cause?
---
It already is a thing, and a lot of them are getting removed because they're lazy karma grabs like this one. Leave a real review if you want it to stick. You can still rate it one star and say that Blizzard's actions have ruined the experience for you. Just be honest and put actual effort into.
---
This sounds like an out of season April Fools joke to me.
---
It's tooooooooo funny... 
---
I can't breathe without laughing.
---
Ok thanks for taking time to clarify 👍
---
Five HS Grandmasters casters issued statements so far - 2 of them stepped down (Kibler &amp; Admirable) and 3 didn't (Sottle, Raven and Darroch Brown). The latter are all British. 
---
But saying that only Americans have conviction to step down is drawing hasty conclusions. Sample size is 5.
---
I also want to stress out that that those who did not quit their jobs aren't doing anything wrong. I've seen some people comparing them to Nazis who are "just following orders". (!!!) I wonder how many of people protesting here would readily quit their livelihood like it was nothing. 
---
I'm absolutely pro-HK and against Blizzard's decision, but people who take it to the other extreme aren't really helping. Instead of trying to force others to step down and quit their jobs, they should just send a part of their paycheck to support HK protests.
---
Thank you
---
Kids love a good brigade.
---
One hearthstone player breaks the rules he agreed upon, and suddenly everybody cares about HK and prepares their vendetta against Blizzard.
---
Group thinking at its finest.
---
That's the point. That never happened. And oh boy, we tried many many times. Once you have a system that requires incorruptible leaders and honesty across all of the society, it is destined to fail. Any attempt to make communism work is destined to fail and create environment for suffering and corruption.
---
They'd have to organize behind the scenes and they can still be fired, just less likely. Don't forget Blizzard is now an agent for China. They follow then CCP handbook which is scorched earth solutions for the tiniest annoyance.
---
Vote this hype!!!!
---
People's rights are violated every day and nobody cared while we all played Hearthstone. It's only now that propaganda has invaded that we are all forced to do so on this subreddit.
---
Do not give in to despair, hopelessness or laziness. Stronger organizations have been forced to change. Start with Blizzard, put little cracks in China's power and ultimately it will fail
---
Yep. Seeing the world in black and white. Typical extreme thinking. This cant be good.
---
It wasn't my intention to make you look like an idiot. I just saw yet another person say something along the lines of Hong Kongers are protesting because they want independence. I see this sort of thing CONSTANTLY posted everywhere. It's people that have no idea what in the world they're actually getting behind and then they're loud and annoying about it too while thinking they're actually contributing something
---
There was a thread last night asking for donations to send a HK team to a Overwatch tournament to represent their "country". Donations that would go to Blizzard, the very company people say to boycott. People somehow thinking they're doing their part. Sticking it to someone.  Who? I don't know. It's just what is trending right now. Of course it quickly hit the goal. There's so much misinformation and irrational shit going on you can't even wrap your head around it.
---
And I'm no expert in Asia. I'm just going totally from memory. I don't go to Google beforehand. While I might not have been totally right the point still remains.
---
So, if they punished you, it would be more censorship = Blizzard bad.
---
If they don't punish you, it would be Western favoritism = Blizzard bad.
---
Wow, sure looks like you all are giving Blizzard a chance to do the right thing. Not like this is a pointless tantrum or anything. Quick question, did holding up a sign on a webcam save anyone's life overseas? Lead to policy change? Do anything constructive other than give you your 15 minutes of fame?
---
Didn't think so.
---
Because sadly Megathreads ultimately stifle discussion.
---
Because the point alot of us are trying to make is that China violating human rights and the Hong Kong protests are two separate things. The protestors aren't protesting what's happening in China, they are protesting how china treated the protests back in June. All the bad shit China is doing has nothing to do with Hong Kong, in-fact the only bad thing China did in Hong Kong was try and enforce an extradition law.
---
All the stuff the police are doing in Hong Kong sounds fucked up until you  consider that the protests were catagorized as a riot by the police. Police in america would treat Riots the same way. Can you give me other examples of China censoring the Hong Kong situation?
---
League of Legends is having its World Championship right now, and Riot Games (the creators of the game) Issued a public statement saying that they won't ban or penalize players for speaking about it. and Riot is 100% OWNED by Tencent. And have a team literally named Hong Kong Attitude.
---
People are twisting and contorting the situation to be far greater and far larger of an offense that it actually is. People are uninformed about the Protests, and twisting the Protests into something they are not. Listen to yourself "more than one tragedy can play out at once", and what's happening in Hong Kong has nothing to do with all the other bad shit China is doing.
---
If the biggest company in China isn't censoring Riot Games about the protests, why would they be censoring Blizzard which they only on 5% of instead of 100%.
---
That's TF2. TFT is Team fight Tactics
---
Thanks. Is there a way to propose a stream that would be in keeping with the rules? I'm not really interested in advertising my stream, I just want to do something for HK.
---
Do they though?
---
Gotta get that sweet, sweet karma!
---
Yeah I totally agree with you, this is really going too far, no one even cared about this Honk Kong situation before all started with Blitzchung. Yell as much as you want folks but that's it. There are people out there who still enjoy playing hs and there's no right to simply downvote their posts or cutting them off the topics. Go discuss politics elsewhere, China is under tyranny from so many years if you didn't know that, and I'm sorry but no player should put it into politics during an eSports tournament, even if he's right that's not a professional behaviour.
---
When even Tim from CAD can easily dunk on you B^U
---
It's not even 12%. It's 13.3% for the **whole Asia-Pacific region in 2018.** Chinese market value in companies eyes mostly comes from the upcoming decade or so and that's what they don't want to miss out on. If we equate "company's growth may stagnate if it doesn't enter Chinese market" to "death", then yeah I guess company will "die" and won't be able to grow endlessly. But I'd like to think that a line needs to be drawn somewhere.
---
What are the ‘real issues’ you’d like to focus on, then ?
---
... the America that appointed Saddam Hussein as a dictator, the one that staged 3 coups against democratically elected leaders in Guatemala, the one that paid for a genocide in Guatemala, the one that turned Iran into a Theocracy, the one that invaded Iraq and Afghanistan to support Haliburton and Saudi princes, the Iran Contra America, or the America that went into Vietnam and pretended to make it better?    
---
It's *really* hard to tell which of those America's would've helped Hong Kong.
---
I'm a little shocked blizzard has been quiet on this. They haven't even made an attempt at damage control. They're probably trying to wait out the outrage they they'll release some half measure attempt at appeasement without addressing the issue.
---
From.. your account:

https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/u/Daros-2263
---
No one cares about how long you played WoW or had a B.Net account.  We're talking about how you created a forum account 3 days ago and then spammed it.
---
If you believe that's all it is,  that's fine. 
---
If other people believe differently,  that's fine. 
---
What research did you want people to do on this topic to have the 'proper' conversation?
---
Who is blaming the devs? This is a strawman I only see more often from Tencent employees.
---
They are openly allowing China to oppress US freedom. Do you even understand how bad this is? Think of how quickly this could grow. Oppression in China is something we can't control, but we don't fight wars and spend trillions on military to get our freedoms openly removed just because corporations are afraid of losing a profit. 
---
It's anti American and last time I checked Blizzard and a lot of these companies are American. I don't know how old you are, but you need to wake up and see how bad this could get in a 10 year span.
---
By continuing to play and opposing Blizzard they essentially are saying "Balls in your court Blizz". Does Blizz want to start banning a bunch of HS players and have all those headlines running in the news? The more people they ban the longer this continues, but those players will continue to use their platform to oppose Blizzard's decision. Honestly, this is a pretty good way to force Blizzard into action.

Look at what's happening to the NBA. Activision-Blizzard wants none of that. Why would they apologize rather than waiting for this to blow over?

Your sceeen is going to have burn out pixels over the ignore reports button area :)

N'zoth is my favorite card they have made. I love playing dumb deathrattle cards and having the old God bring them back.

I just hit Act 2 and now I can't play due to randomly facing 3+ full seconds of lag (most often when I'm in town where it doesn't matter and when I'm in the middle of a bunch of mobs with 30% health or less).
---
I haven't actually seen any comments like this, at least on the subreddit or on the couple of HS vids I have watched in the last few days (I still wanna support firebat &amp; regis)  
---
But I haven't opened the games or watched any streams. I'd struggle to imagine that it's a large number of people being nasty about things, I think we're best to ignore them, move on and maintain the positive push for changes that we've managed to cultivate so far.  
---
I'm very proud of the HS community right now. Don't waste your energy giving these negative and silly commentors any attention. That goes double for you content creators, who I imagine are already feeling very insecure about your future in Blizzard games related content. Ultimately, you guys owe us nothing, and most of us still want you to succeed. Do what is right for you, do not aim to appease anyone, because appeasement is what caused this problem in the first place.  
---
Support to you all, and if HS really does fall to pieces, may you find new success in other places.
---
Because they are lead by people, and SOME people have ideals. Now I no longer trust Activision or Blizzard because they agents for the CCP and all their products should be banned by the governments in all countries outside of China. We don't need impressionable young minds being brainwashed with Chinese propaganda or being spied upon by Chinese spyware.
---
The reason why we want a megathread is because it has been 3 day of basically identical post that have little to do with hearthstone
---
What do you want Blizzard to respond??? ''sO sOrRy, WoNt Do iT aGaIn".   
---
I mean come on, it's a pr mistake, they'll just go with it and that's it.
---
Keep it up man, you are making a big difference !
---
Could easily be considered lying and defrauding investors.
---
What sacrifice did you make for hong kong?
---
Email support, that should definitely not be happening.
---
I agree with you totally. He shouldn't have bought politics to Hearthstone however just his cause may be. Blizzard had to punish him otherwise every gamer will use tournaments as a soap box for their own politics which no one wants. Blizzard were a little harsh, but it's very much a case of making an example to fend off future political outbursts.
---
Keep Hearthstone about Hearthstone.
---
&gt;This must be one of those brainwashed persons from mainland I hear all about on the news.
---
A lengthy post full of clear and verifiable arguments and examples that - among other things - calls out the idiocy of brainwashed Westerners believing their news to tell the truth even though it has been conclusively debunked... and this guy literally repeats what he hears on the news.
---
This guy genuinely believes Chinese people to be brainwashed. Apparently not realizing that the average Chinese person knows everything there is to know about the US straight from American sources while he knows absolutely nothing about China and literally considers Chinese opinions "brainwashed" and "propaganda".
---
I literally called out people like him in my comment and he completely ignores that fact and just repeated . This is what brainwashing looks like. Chinese people having an opinion different from yours isn't brainwashing.
---
Westerners rejecting the evidence of their eyes and ears and repeating the propaganda they were led to believe despite being fully contradicted by arguments is literal brainwashing. 
---
I rest my case. Absolute insanity.
---
&gt; People that are so brainwashed to rely on the government to provide for them, "keep them safe", and to tell them what to think. 
---
Read. Read what this person is writing. Read the brainwashed nonsense he believes. He literally parrots what he has been told by the US government and US media while believing it's others who are brainwashed.
---
He has been fully contradicted. Everything he believes has been explained to be bullshit and clear examples proving the opposite of what he believes have been provided... yet he keeps repeating anti-Chinese propaganda. He keeps repeating memes. This is literal brainwashing.
---
&gt;The actions of the police alone, the brutality, the complete lack of respect for human life is disgusting.
---
Listen to this person. He keeps repeating propaganda memes.
---
It has been explained how that is wrong. It has been explained how authorities and the government in his own country are objectively and verifiably worse. He refuses to acknowledge facts. He refuses to do his research. His mind has been fully taken over by brainwashing. He has been literally mentally disabled. He was turned into a zombie incapable of rational thought. 
---
&gt;When a person no longer has to think or worry about existence, that is when creativity is snuffed out. Look at how long it has taken China to rise to a "super power".
---
He doesn't even see the irony of 
---
This is late stage capitalism. This is the true evil of American empire and the true elimination of humanity within the American state. This person no longer is capable of critical and differentiated thought. He has been successfully lobotomized. This is what the US does to its subjects. And they project the evil of their own nation unto others. And they think it's *good*.
---
To answer your assertion, u/whoareyouyesterday: China has risen to a super power in the shortest time in human history and is taking over the US in every way, *especially* fast when it comes to innovation. Never in human history has any nation ever developed faster. 
---
You are literally brainwashed, you don't seem to realize this. It's fucking absurd how insane your comment is. You know absolutely nothing about reality beyond propaganda. It's actually scary to see a person like you talk. You even believe me to be Chinese and think others are brainwashed. Do you honestly not see how bizarre your behaviour is? Do you honestly feel like you are a reasonable person who is sufficiently informed about the topics he is trying to discuss?
---
Because the people who made hearthstone did it to a hearthstone player at a hearthstone tournament. This may be just me but there is alot of hearthstone in that statement.
---
Well, maybe that sort of mentality needs to change then. Obviously, we don't think that "company wants to make money" is a valid excuse to support any possibly immoral action, right?
---
We as society need to draw the line somewhere. Why not draw that line at "don't bow down to regime's desire to limit free speech".

I don't think you did if you quit out of principal without it significantly impacting anyone you love. You had the option, some literally don't and if they quit then their kids go hungry. Stuff like that you gotta consider

there was a easy way out , they could just post a disclaimer/message like " we blizzard are company and as such we are neutral in political issues and the player actions/views are his own"
---
and ignore or just ban the guy for some matches or give him a warning , with that  nobody in the west would give a shit about the case

easy peasy

but they had to take chinese goverment side and descend the punishment as hard as possible ,

i have no sympathy  for blizzard for what have they done and how they have done it

I don't even play Hearthstone, this post is on the front page. I started playing WoW Classic when it launched, and I've quit as a result of this fiasco. I hadn't played WoW in over 10 years before that, so... yeah, not really a big deal for me not to play their games anymore.
---
And you may think writing your representatives is useless, but at least I'm aware and if they don't support the bill, then I, and the rest of their constituents will remember that come the next election cycle. Being an informed and active voter is the whole point of democracy and the only way it continues to function. 
---
So go ahead and talk shit about me and others giving a fuck about the world. At least you'll have your circus to keep yourself entertained while the world burns.
---
If you need a place to talk about hong kong go to r/hongkong
---
Yeah, i think they do.  I think they work for things like 'match threads' in /r/rugbyunion/  where the main match thread is just about what is happening Right Then, but specific incidents can and do fall out of that and become their own topics as the main megathread moves on as the match progresses.
---
When it comes to discussing more loosely related topics though i find them, hard to work with and that in turn discourages discussion.  There's a reason Reddit isn't just all megathreads and that, i think, is because the normal format works better for most people.
---
I wish they would show solidarity and stand with Kib and Admirable. Kind of like crossing a picket line. Sure it’s fair, but is it the right thing to do? The right thing to do isn’t always the easy thing to do.
---
Consider anything over 5-10 years a permaban and stop worrying about 1k.  It was a fresh account that instantly posted spam.  Just because it's topical doesn't mean it's necessary.

We'll be waiting forever, they will say absolutely nothing and expect it to die out before blizzcon.
---
Sort by controversial and you might find a few posts about the actual game. People seem to be downvoting them..
---
&gt;(that's totally fine with me)
---
That's a start. Not caring is part of the package, tho. It's kinda expected... /S
---
This is not about China. We don't expect great things from China since the Tinanmon Square "incident".
---
This is about an US company trying to impose censorship to please the Chinese government. Blizzard made it political by doing it - that's why US senators are talking about it, that's why EU politicians are asking questions.
---
Finally, it's not about the rules or keeping games free of politics. The AU players weren't punished after protesting for Hong Kong on stream.
---
A lot of people want your money and goods, but they won't put up with Chinese dictatorial rules for one second. They would rather do the human rights thing...
---
Wat

Not sure if it's the same in Hong Kong, but most of the "Lennon Walls" in Taiwan definitely include a [lot about East Turkmenistan and Xinjiang](https://i.imgur.com/ttWh6oP.jpg).
---
Yeah that's what I was wondering too because of their wording specifically. They might only be in it until the end of the year and then they'll see how blizzard handles things going forward, which I think makes sense for them.
---
Like cigarettes have pictures of lung cancer and birth defects, we should print pictures of Tiananmen on China Quislings.
---
Do you see this post being banned?  No, because we're not on the official HS Bliz forums, genius.
---
Don't let a little thing like facts get in the way of your armchair activism.
---
Blizzard's actions, and thus Hearthstone's relation to the topic, isn't a human rights issue.  If you want to talk about China's human rights problems, that's fine, there are plenty of places to do that other than a Hearthstone forum.

The UDSSR collapsed, that's why the cold war ended. Part of that vacuum existed and was filled by China, other parts by the EU, yes. 
---
The US entered the war, because they failed in Cuba, plain and simple. That was Kennedy's POV.
---
You are caught up in your ideology. HK people have that better life, that "was promised". China isn't a communist country. This is a struggle for democracy and not Capitalism vs Communist. China has given up on Communism ever since Deng Xiaoping. They are a totalitarian state, that's what the people of HK are fighting against.
---
China is trying to ignore their contract with Hong Kong, the issue is far deeper than one bill. You know what happend in Tibet, right? You know, that China has a on-going genocide against a minority that is refusing to bow to their values? What do you think will happend to political enemies in Hong Kong, once the CCP has full control?
---
I don’t think JAB likes this. I know JAB as an acquaintance. He just likes making games.
---
Maybe a stupid solution, but what's stopping you from just posting HS related topics here anyway? I don't see why the sub can't engage with both.
---
The same situation is now happening in Russia. The government created those 'nationalists' they now cannot control. If you give them time they will make some shady deal and things will go to the old status quo. If you are truly a liberal your true enemy is CCP not some misguided, manipulated mass. CCP will not change itself on their own.
---
sorry for being a degenerete but whats Duel Masters?
---
Direct your anger at the Hong Kong posts at Blizzard they started it and they can stop it.  TY:)
---
Obviously Blizzard is in the wrong here, but if they dropped Diablo 4 and said “Preorders start now, at that table over there, buy now and get a playable demo today” two things would happen.  One, wallets would fly open, and 90% of those Winnie masks would be in the dumpster.
---
It's almost Impossible to find post about the game under the slew of hong kong posts
---
what do you call the detention facilities on our soutbern border then?
---
Also, being a condescending prick is uncalled for
---
yes... go spam very helpful review of the application...
---
You complete morons are trashing the game which is itself is not related to whatever political situation is happening.
---
&gt; this sub is no longer about hearthstone and became about karma whoring bots 
---
OP, your projection is as astounding as it is tone deaf.
---
&gt;near infinite legal leeway (so it would be impossibly difficult to sue)
---
Not really. You can't agree to a conract if the terms within aren't supported by the law in the first place. 
---
Retroactively taking someone's prize money from a competition is very likely illegal under federal law, even if it's stipulated in their contract, it cannot be enforced. 
---
The ban is obviously at the sole discretion of blizzard, but it doesn't mean that they can't be sued.
---
I never once promoted the use of another sub or linked to one. Go on, scroll back and look.
---
I’m just a person who refuses to sit idly by and be accused of “burying my head in the sand” because I can see a need for a venue where I don’t have to sit around and read a bunch of people circle jerking their newly found education into the sort of shit that happens in the real world with companies who do business with China every.goddamned.day. 
---
And you still haven’t answered me as to whether or not even in places of free speech, you’d expect your employer to happily support your right to say whatever you want if it would adversely impact the business’ income. Can you not answer because you’re not a member of the workforce?
---
Yes, the west should learn and start handling these companies like China.
---
I actually don’t need to do anything. Especially when you’re so desperate to troll you come here sucking on Communist dick for a reaction.
---
Now there's a reference I haven't heard in too long.  
---
\- looks at blizzard's shambling soulless corpse  
---
"Oh my God.... She's so drunk"
---
&gt; because I’ve never seen such love for their country
---
North Korea comes close
---
Good, good, good. One step closer to this nonsense blowing over. Would be nice if I could come on the hearthstone subreddit and actually see content about the game. Who knew that would be such a ridiculous request?
---
"news" lmao
---
Empathy.  It's a shame you don't have any.
---
So is that an admission that you were just talking out of your ass?
---
Hong Kong has protested for over 18 weeks and counting. We should go for at least as long as that.
---
Exactly...people on here only care when they're "forced" to care. The rest of the time they're more than happy with the suffering OTHER people have to endure, as long as it doesn't interfere with their games or with them personally. Like you're doing now...
---
You wouldn't care if people got killed, raped, murdered, tortured, boiled alive, none of those stuff matters, because it isn't happening to you. Your greatest concern in life is playing a card game.
---
So you didn't say anything different from what I said, you merely proved it. Sure you might try and justify it by saying "we all need to escape reality sometimes", but honestly...That's a child's way of thinking. Only children run away from problems.
---
But I won't hold you any longer. I'm sure you're dying to log back on and occupy your mind with the real meaningful things in life, like a card game. Good day.
---
I hope you guys realize that boycoiting blizzard solves nothing.
---
For starters I actually researched the situation in just Hong Kong. Learned what the Protests are ACTUALLY about. They have nothing to do at all with the genocide that China is also commiting. So I looked into that issue. China's harvesting of organ's is a by all accounts real thing, but it is separate and isolated from the Hong Kong situation. China possibly committing genocide by forcing abortions. A real problem, does need to be address, but separate from the Hong Kong situations.

The whole reason Freedom for Hong Kong is coming up is because the Chinese government was handed the city by Britain almost 20 years ago. Part of the Agreement was that the two entities would essentailly spend 50 years assimilating governments. The Chinese government is jumping the gun with certain laws its trying to enforce. That is most of what the protests are about. The extradition laws, but in protesting them they got labeled as a riot. The Current protests are about the Extraditions laws still, being labeled as a riot, police brutality (that stemmed from the riot classification), amnesty for protestors, and wanting Equal Suffrage rights.
---
One Can also look into Riot Games. Blizzard is owned 5% by Tencent, because of this people think that they succumbed to Chinese pressure. Riot, who is 100% owned by Tencent, issued a public statement that they would not be punishing any caster or player that voices an opinion for support of the protests in Hong Kong.
---
Now tell me,that when people are mad that Blizzard didn't want to be used as a Political Platform in support of Hong Kong, they are endorsing a Tyrannical Chinese Government and supporting the suppression of freedom and basic human rights.
---
Can you see why some of us are trying to diffuse the situation?
---
Wut
---
wait so just so we're clear, your current stance is that every normal living outside of hong kong are counter-protesting the protesters from hong kong? lol talk about a stretch
---
Im tryin to understand this. Imagine yourself being in some executive positions in blizzard. Fact is china money are big money for the company. China is like "HK is our thing, agree or bye". What would you, internet warriors, do in this position? Sure you can do the right thing but you can also expect some cut downs. Maybe because of your politics, you would have to let go half of your employee eventually. Maybe it would destroy the company at all. What do we know about that? You are so sure and extremist about everything. Wait ffs, try to think a bit deeper. Ask yourself "but what if". You are just so full of hate with your "I 100% know what is right".
---
rats
---
Read it again, “Wut.”
---
You cannot avoid the moral double standard that you are applying to streamers and Blizzard execs though.
---
The higher ups at Blizzard who make these decisions are in the same catch 22. Damned if they do, damned if they don’t.
---
What this movement is failing at miserably, is the fact that you can either hold everyone accountable or no one. 
---
It scales up for sure, ex: players who play HS right now hurt the cause, streamers who stream hurt it a bit more, Blizzard PR people who help Blizzard snake out hurt even more, all the way up...
---
But you can’t just draw a line and say all people below this line are not responsible and all above are devils.
---
It's better to try something and fail then do nothing at all. You have the attitude of a loser.
---
POS? Funny acronym for Perpetrator Of war crimeS. PoWC would work better
---
Imagine you were fired from your job for goading and allowing someone to break competition rules  on a livestream.
---
have you heard of staying on topic?
---
I would guess nearly 95% of the posts about blizzard are related to either china or hong kong. But yeah I’m wondering as well
---
No it's my unwillingness to converse with CCP and oppression apologists. For the motherland!
---
You are just baaaaaaing the same ignorant bullshit that the rest of the herd about the trending outrage topic and when confronted by how little you actually know , just keep repeating the same crap. Just like religious fanatics. To hell with the facts, reality is what I think it is, eh? And  people like you want to make a difference rofl
---
Thanks.
---
See that is a reason to hate on Blizzard even more, because it's hypocritical. They cant even stick to a policy, it makes them look like they don't know what they are doing.
---
That's where you are wrong. I don't believing what any government tells me. I believe that every human has the right to choose how they want to live, and not have their life dictated by a third party. I look at social media, especially those between Mainland China and Hong Kong. I see as much as I'm able to, and everything I see is the people of Hong Kong fighting for the right to be free, and the idiots such as u/nomordisinformation, that only regurgitate what the government tells the. To.
---
No government has the right to dictate how any person lives.  Not do they have the right to attack, injure, main, and kill it's citizens.
---
Finally someone who can think, thank you
---
Btw that's actually not rafaam but gg
---
What is the point of your trolling? What point are you trying to make, really? That we should all just shut the fuck up and not do anything at all? I'm seriously asking, because I honestly don't understand why people are being so hateful about any small action people take to stand up for their beliefs.
---
Yes, that's really the point of all of it. I couldn't express myself in better words.
---
Whats wrong with people voicing their opinions over a shit company that is clearly in the wrong?
---
Well I just want to know who’s not allowed him to talk about stuff he wants to talk about. 
---
He can talk about his stuff and others can talk about the Hong Kong stuff.
---
And you’re correct, it normally isn’t a Blizzard/Hearthstone issue. But since so many players and casters stepped down because of it, it became out. 
---
And people aren’t even really discussing politics here. It’s more a discussion about the complete overreaction on blizzards size. A small fine a 1 week ban or should have been fine. Nobody body have bet an eye since it’s in the rules. 
---
There are people that cheated that got nearly no punishment. That’s also against the rules.
---
So why go ballistic when someone breaks the rules with politics? Thats the Problem people have.
---
You know a very small fraction of their revenue is actually outside NA and EU.  
---
I believe the Asian market accounts for roughly 12%, the rest being NA and EU.  
---
I would've guessed the easy choice would be to NOT piss off the people responsible for literally over 80% of your revenue to favour the Chinese accounts. But hey, maths and logic must be absent from the mind of Blizz execs. Would make a lot of sense, if that were the case.
---
Go to Chinese servers. All this is censored there and you can cuff your ears and close your eyes all day long.
---
I gotta say, that was a better use of a colon than I usually see from ESL speakers
---
Go cancel your Modern Warfare preorders too. I know it's Activision but they've already seen a surge in cancellations and it will effect Blizzard.
---
I thought you meant OP's post here broke the rules being "low effort" or something.
---
No need to throw a fit because you were vague.
---
Or maybe "Hey, should we punish the US team?" "Are you joking?  We literally lost 40% of our player base, don't do anything."
---
Did I say Every? Nope, But you are assuming every person in Hong Kong supports said protests, which is also a stretch.
---
My original point stands, there is a group of people that may have been offended by Blitzchung statement, because they don't agree with the protests. They can exist outside the Chinese government, there are people here in America that don't support the protests, Jackie Chan, the lead actress for the live action Mulan that Disney is producing.
---
It doesn't really matter how many or how few they are, the point is there are still normal people who can and do disagree with what is happening.
---
No problem. Thanks for keeping a level head. I just hate the philosophy of there being a right/wrong place to voice things of this magnitude as policing really only benefits the people who aren't involved in the first place.
---
Like, we are talking about a sub that gets flooded with hundreds of pics of blink fox and turn 1 dungeon boss OTK's, but a HS player getting banned/punished and the fallout behind shouldnt be posted here? Haha
---
imagine thinking China is communist lol
---
One of his thread titles is "Get over it" and the other is "Mods got double standards" no surprise that they got removed
---
Seems like that should be a legitimate use as apparently corporations have no morality other than optimizing $$ unless people actually care enough to not patronize them.
---
There is nothing wrong in that, this sub is just the wrong place.
---
If I went to BlizzCon, I'd much rather be wearing a nice 1st Amendment T-shirt with US flag, colors, text, the works. These are readily available in may, many nice designs in your preferred choice of color, and I would hope that no-one in the US would have a problem with someone wearing that in public (even if it may be seen as a bit cheesy).
---
I can see Blizzard banning Winnie the Poo outfits, and shirts with pro-Hong Kong slogans.
---
But excluding someone from BlizzCon for wearing the text of the 1st Amendment of the United States Constitution? Pass the popcorns, please.
---
American company bending for China’s censoreship in order to be allowed to stay in the chinese market. This is why Facebook is banned from China, because Facebook is actually poor free speech platform, who only censore what facebook wish, not what china wish. 
---
Multiple american compines bend for china, just recently Nike removed there pro-hong kong shoe, because it could lead to have nike removed from the Chinese market place.
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain. I don't disagree with any of your points, thought I agree with some more than others. Calling the writing unvetted is the part I don't agree with, but I also won't disagree because I don't know the guy well enough to go either way. It did seem like he provided proof of past analyses that were also reasonable, which does speak a bit to his consistency, though again we don't know what his true motives are as he has little to lose with the SEC not investigating like it used to.
---
I suggest deep breath exercises.
---
The struggle my dude... maybe we should move actual HS discussion to r/hscirclejerk
---
While you're fighting the good fight, encouraging others to spam the subreddit is not fine- one "daily thread" is enough
---
Yes I know it's a whole new level of being messed up. I am just reminding you that this is not something new for them. Being so detached from reality and only profits oriented.
---
The N'Zoth meta is very disheartening. Almost every deck is a N'Zoth deck.
---
The meta was more fun before the event, and I look forward to the event ending. I am pro Blizzard changing what cards are in the classic set, but I hope they choose not to include N'Zoth in the future. Especially while Khartut Defender is standard...
---
Well, Jason Russell wanted Kony arrested, but ended up walking around butt naked and getting arrested.
---
So, number of arrests:
---
Jason - 1
---
Kony - 0
---
Guess Kony won this one.
---
Wait uninstalling hearthstone wont magically free hongkong. Sarcasmim aside i hear you and agree with. Most of the people doing this stuff will probably move on to something else within a month and they will go back to forgetting about hongkong.
---
This seems like the only blizzard related subreddit that isn't kneeling hard and trying to defend blizzard. Does anyone know why the hearthstone fans/sub doesn't suck blizzard's cock like the others?
---
Imagine not being able to comprehend "ideologically communist".
---
The funny thing is, I'm actually far more excited for Blizzcon now than I was before.  
---
I had 0 expectations after Diablo Immortal.  
---
At least now I can expect some fireworks.
---
"Job security" is less important than freedom. No job is ever truly "secure" and most employees are replaceable at a whim. If an employer would fire you for expressing a globally respected view (e.g., human rights should be protected) then you can make the economic decision to not work for them. View-point discrimination is a thing, and Blizzard (for example) has employed it to result in this whole fiasco.
---
I totally agree with you that blizzard shouldn’t have punished any of them. But they probably got hit by the ban hammer because it is super heavily implied that they knew EXACTLY what he was going to say and let it happen. Virtual even says to Bltitzchung something that roughly translates to:”Just speak the 8 words and we’ll get on with it.” and then ducks his and Mr Yees head to let him say it (implying that they knew it was going to possibly get them in trouble). Not to take away from how wrong blizzards reaction was, just wanted to clarify it for none Chinese speakers so you guys can focus more on blizzard being political in their reasoning than them being unreasonable in general.
---
Just like voicing your political views on a game stream is the wrong place.
---
This died 15 minutes after it happened. The Mei memes are already dead
---
I've not talked about what the right solution for Hong Kong is.  Or what the Chinese borders should be.  I'm well aware that i'm not wise enough to solve those problems, better people than me have tried and failed.  I've not talked about the other things you mention, although i have strong views on most of them, to the extent i've made previous efforts about them in real life.
---
What i have talked about is a Hearthstone Tournament and the decisions made in it by it's both it's participants and organizers and the fallout from each of those.
---
Those are appropriate and reasonable for this sub.  Just as i have tried to be.   I certainly don't feel superior, i'm not revelling, i am sad that i need to be here, writing this.
---
Oh look, more China spam to cover for Trump.
---
We're literally looking at the end of democracy in the U.S. Stop it.
---
This is my favorite card back. Good choice, I would love to see it more.
---
"You're not doing enough and not doing it in the right way, so you should do nothing" is that your conclusion?
---
love being "ideologically communist" but not practicing communism in any way shape or form. It's like calling yourself ideologically pacifist and doing wars all the time
---
lol the fact that you have a pre-prepared list of celebrities against the protests by hong kong civilians, is extremely fucking concerning. Thats like Scientology level of deranged propaganda. What is wrong with you? Are you being payed to say this? Are you under threat? What is the matter with you?
---
Downvoted, but considering how much money NetEase gave Second Dinner, I have serious doubts Brode's going to be saying much.
---
This is why it's hard to take some of your seriously. Telling people to go find a safe space when you've afforded exactly that despite the rules (which is fine by the way considering the situation), being unable to respond with a relevant argument when called out on it, calling anyone who points out how you're weakening your own cause names that don't actually apply because you have a narrow understanding of the situation. You make everyone else look bad when you post nonsense like that. Not everyone is against you just because they're pointing out how detrimental you're being to your own cause.
---
Brit here and the opium wars is one of our biggest shames. But if you think HK wouldn't be in better hands right now under British control  you are delusional.
---
Let the kids enjoy there brigade. Most of them have no clue how widespread Tencent and Chinese money and influence is.
---
One could even say perfect.
---
Review bombing doesn't do shit since basically nobody reads those and that's especially true for something as big as HS. It's just a meaningless gesture to make people feel like they did something despite the fact that afterwards they probably used products from 5 other companies that bent to China.
---
If you really wanna do something hit them in the bottom line. Delete your account/boycot their products, write to your rep if you're in the US, ask them for all your info if you're in the EU, donate to HKFP if you're able to, etc. Don't just leave a 1 star review and then claim you're "standing up against a company that is censoring people due to the pressure of an authoritarian regime"
---
I feel like you're overgeneralizing.  
---
If you found out, today, that the company you work for did something similar to Blizzard, would you walk out, right this minute?  Would you jeopardize going hungry, losing the roof over you and your family's head, just to make a statement that really won't make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things?  Because that's what people are asking Zalae to do.  Toast even said in his statement that going after streamers who keep playing isn't fair because to them it's their livelihood.
---
&gt; without alienating China and risking access to the market
---
i wonder how much money is china going to be spending vs the rest of the world? guys, put your money where your mouth is. don't buy anything. if this shit happened before i bought tombs of terror i'd have saved 20 bucks.
---
I mean it can singlehandedly ruin an arena game on its own, but I guess that kind of crazy rng is what hearthstone is about to an extent.
---
it also carries over to next clean run . I completed 8/8 bosses and the dog is still in the deck for subsequent runs.
---
This is not by Blizzard, but by the company that distributes HS in China
---
The child's way of thinking is forcing your beliefs upon other people who have no regard or relevance to anything happening far away. You're forced to care, but there are more people dying of more basic needs than the people of HK. We don't care about them because they don't have zealous advocates like you. You only care because it's affecting you right now, while you never stood for any human rights violations in your life. That's an extemeists way of thinking.
---
&gt; Nobody cared about HK before blitz got banned. 
---
Once again...Exactly my point. Nobody cared, just like nobody cares here now. It's only an issue because you wanted to log on to read some posts that will help you in your game, then you got inconvenienced with nonsense like other people's suffering.
---
You can’t its literally impossible, all actual Hearthstone content is downvoted into oblivion.
---
Uh, yeah? Google and Apple have algorithms and staff to remove review bombing. If it isn't about the actual app, then they will remove it as irrelevant. Reviews are there to determine if the app works well and if game play is fun. It is not there to determine the morality of the owners.
---

---

ONE person killed 60 people and injured 400 in Las Vegas 2017. Do not underestimate what one deranged psycho can do.

Good point. I think a lot of the people in these comments are making the companies pick sides.
---
We’re going to have to deal with probably a couple weeks of this shit...
---
That’s not how life works, mother fucker.
---
Remind me to come to your job sometime to shame you for things your employer does that is completely beyond your control.
---
What, you want more than one mass shooter?
---
If you think this has achieved nothing you are not paying attention. It has generated tons of attention for the issue in global news, and has started the question of “should Western companies be allowed to pander to the Chinese government without consequences back home”. Sure, Blizzard won’t go bankrupt over this and Hearthstone won’t die, but that’s not the point. The point is that people are waking up to Western companies pretending to be pro-freedom/human rights while throwing all those views away the second it threatens their income from an authoritarian dictatorship.
---
I'm talking about all the shit that is being spammed all over new
---
&gt;The silence is deafening - Blizzard MUST respond
---
Why?
---
Invest in winnie the pooh right now for maximum profits
---
Just don't stream Blizz games, profit.
---
Cool if you're done, I'll only engage with one thing.
---
Prove to me that it was exclusively because of money, and demonstrate that my argument is false and you got me buddy. Problem is you cant, because it's emotional. So your bringing in a bunch of other factors to pretend to bolster your argument.
---
Also remember that right now it IS just Blizzard we're talking about. Cant let ya sneak that one in on me haha
---
It doesnt belong here 3 days in a row, in a constant barrage of posts... Theres 100 million HS players. Europe, Africa, South America. Also, players from places where human rights are being ignored *daily* in a much worse manner then HK, and no one is raising a voice...Theres political subreddits where this should be discussed. Theres an option of sticky posts. Holding an entire subreddit hostage to get a political message across is kind of hypocritical
---
You know they gonna bounce back with mw coming out
---
A: It shouldn't. Proportionality is big in EU law, everything needs to pass the test, you've basically done the test in your first sentence: Is it proportional that a company that only has limited personal data on me and I've never made a purchase require a poto ID? The answer, in your case especially, is no.
---
Yea lucky for you.  Are you going to boycott all businesses that have a nexus with China now or just the ones that make card games?
---
and dont ruin all the side businesses, most locally owned and operated that count on these types of conventions for their survival, including being able to pay their employees, who count on their salaries for THEIR survival.
---
And mobile :/
---
I think blizzard would argue that if they hadn't taken action then they would have been endorsing a particular political belief.
---
Even still, you’d think Blizz would have a tight leash on what they say right now.
---
Why farm organs when you can farm karma
---
Didn't delete any games but I defeated the Ottomans in Civ 6 so that should cover it.

Hopefully you and your whole family get put into a chinese concentration camp

I really don't think he should have been.
---
When Rosa Parks was removed from a bus because she broke the seating rules, the boycott of the bus company (and discussion thereof) continued for over a year before a supreme court decision ended the need for it.
---
Blitzchung may not be Rosa Parks and i doubt this will take over a year to play out, or require the supreme court, but this is not over yet.  Far from it.
---
I was a huge fan as well. A fangirl if you want so. Defended Hearthstone for several years. Got tired of the game and didn't play as much anymore, but still couldn't let go. That incident was the final straw for me and I guess for other as well. It's not only the recent events, which made me finally quit but they were the icing on the cake.
---
Why I'm still here? Because I still love the Hearthstone community and I'm proud of every single tiny protest against Blizzard. I want to read them, all of them. Not because I always hated the game and wanted to see it destroyed. No, because I was maybe one of the biggest fans of it over the years. Blizzard has to learn, like all other gaming companies, to care about the player. It should stand on our side, because we are the ones who made Hearthstone a huge success. Show us the respect we deserve.
---
They decided to punish one of us in a ridiculous way. His voice matters. And ours as well.
---
Exactly, the amount of HK shilling in this subreddit is atrocious. Never would I have imagined so many people could be brainwashed at once
---
Could say the same about all the Indian tech scammers trying to rob your grandmother. It doesnt mean I have to respect them.
---
Yes! Such behavior should never be forgotten, never be forgiven!
---
Praise NBA!
---
&gt; Activision is just as much in on this as Blizzard
---
Are you guys not aware they're the same company? It's Activision-Blizzard for fucks sake!
---
Nice! You did absolutely nothing but waste your own time. People from HK are proud to have people like you!
---
Ya they picked a side here big time haha

Yea sorry but they have been acceptable for decades, that’s when we decided international trade was better than a Cold War, and China is actually much better and more free now than they used to be as hard to believe as that is.  They used to be a MORE repressive regime and partly because of international trade they’ve adopted some western values.  But sure if you want an isolationist policy and to go be a hermit that refuses to interact with everyone go ahead.

I read your post to mean that you believe corporations hold enough power over foreign governments that protesting them will result in change.
---
I mean, that's what the thread is about, so I assumed that if you're arguing that protesting by way of boycott is an effective tool for creating change in China, that I would point out 1) how you might actually make change, and 2) convince you to consider the change you're actually making by going down this particular road.

Hey man, I'm sure by dusting your whole card collection, you helped a lot of people in HK! At least with 40k powder,  you will be able to craft some pretty decent deck once that whole thing blow over

Its currently the maximum point with an upward trend, its definitely a deviation.

There has not been enough time to collect data to compare it to long term yet.

I'm just happy the HS channel has BTTV enabled

Would have done more good if they participated but conceded. Too few people will know they just didn't show up.
---
Why are you worried. You guys keep saying this will blow over in a few days and be forgotten. I would just ignore it if I were you.
---
I’d get Zephrys if you haven’t yet. He is and probably will be the best legendary for a while. Plus he adds a lot of variety to your hs experience by making Highlander decks a viable option for you. I recommend watching Kripparian’s Zephrys guide to understand how to play him.
---
&gt;Just what the title says; 90% of the posts on this sub now encourage people to take action against Blizzard so why are they not banned?
---
Do you really not see the issue with banning 90% of posters on this sub? Or are you just going for Social Credits?
---
Damn you two are shameless bootlickers.
---
Congrats they still have your money.
---
So you think the blizzard stuff isn’t related to Hong Kong ? ...are you seriously that blind ?
---
I have a better idea, dont show up at all.

Easy they sent an apology to China.

Pretty sure it's the other way around, at least on the Chinese Twitter.

No one gives a fuck what you want. There’s more important things going on than some nobody being mad that their subreddit temporarily has less memes and shit posting. Buy a fucking clue, jobber.
---
Or maybe you could realize that fake review bombing is fucking stupid and does absolutely nothing for China.
---
I posted something about the was pro blizzard and I got removed, so not sure what’s going on with that
---
I guess tournaments, the community and account rules got nothing to do with the game. In fact the player that was banned was never playing Hearthstone. Must be it!
---
fair enough
---
shrug.jpg
---
How is that any different than what the Blizzard execs did? It's literally the same logic they'll use. "Our shareholders want us to make money"
---
Again, that's not Blizzard. That is a company that distributes HS to China. And since it is a huge Chinese company, it does what Winnie the Pooh wants
---
Yeah this bot is low key racist...
---
There has been no evidence supporting the claim that China forced them to do it. We need to stop giving Blizzard a pass by saying things like "it was because of Activision" or "China made them do it". Until further evidence comes out, this was a decision made by Activision Blizzard execs in their US offices, especially considering they're waiting for COD Mobile to be approved in China.
---
to do so china needs to eat some nuclear bombs first : )
---
-I think In China, about 50 million people are as rich as the developed countries. 300 million people have received a good education and live a good life. but there are still 1 billion left......Hong Kong people should realize how backward China is，and propose a universal suffrage plan acceptable by today‘s China。
---
- I think we are like Singapore, we can say anything but bad things about the government. But we also have our own way of supervising the government. For example, we have live TV programs almost in every city. People raise questions about livelihood and government officials solve them on the spot. but Most of China is still very poor. Democracy needs to develop slowly just like the economy. And stability is the first priority in China，Otherwise China would have split into dozens of countries......

Who the fuck cares about karma dude this isn’t about karma
---
Then you're not the person this thread is aimed at
---
blizzard should add winnie the poo into the game
---
Lmao perfect timing.
---
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the irony of username "kommunistparty" spamming free Hong Kong copy pasta?
---
Which one of those is Hong Kong?
---
They only ever threatened preseason as far as I'm aware?  Preseason is worthless anyway.
---
Even still, if they had threatened the whole season anyone that knows China knows that's a totally empty threat.  Their own people would start rioting if NBA wasn't showing and the government knows it.
---
For who? Them? No, it won't.
---
That's the point. I get your sarcasm, but I'm not leading anything. It's truth, there isn't much I can do from reddit comments - but we're just showing support for a greater problem at hand, that overshadows Blizzard, NBA, apple, or whatever company it is.
---
Free Hong Kong.
---
I remember reading that when it was popular yesterday, from what I gathered on that thread the translation isn’t fully objective and very geared towards the anti China crowd, and people started posting other versions of the translations. Chinese to English translation can never be word for word but the pictured translation definitely has an agenda to it.
---
The way you write is unreadable (having a stroke)
---
The point I was trying to get across is that although the Blitzchung incident has no relevance in terms of the quality of HS as a game (ie. Gameplay, graphics, etc), it is still an important metric as to whether someone should support the game.
---
You've made it clear that you're quite invested in HS, otherwise, you would consider moving to a different game. In which case, the Blitzchung related reviews would be relevant for newer players or people considering to try HS despite these reviews providing no insight into the quality of HS as a game.
---
Ron's Coffee?
---
I will just point out that while this has been upvoted into the high heavens and has been all over gaming reddits with *millions* of subscribers - /r/gaming has 23 million as far as I am aware and /r/Overwatch has 2.6 million - the actual subscriber growth of /r/HongKong has been 30,000 subscribers between October the 8th and now.
---
That's a growth of about 11% to 285,000 subscribers.
---
If a big portion of reddit was really all about helping Hong Kong, then that growth would be intensely higher. The link to their subreddit gets posted everywhere and is associated with many top comments across reddit.
---
While this certainly had a very positive impact, there's no evidence that this is the focus for most.
---
It's a game where intentionally gimping yourself with 'the worst decks' is still viable enough to become the top 1% of players - and that is one of the reasons it's so easy for streamers like Toast to become bored with the game. 
---
Can you imagine the NBA if a team tying their shoe laces together only changed their winrate by a little bit?
---
Exhaled hard from my noise. Funny shit keep it up
---
Nobody is suggesting that people should watch Hearthstone streams if they no longer wanted to support Hearthstone.  I mean... that would be a crazy suggestion.

Shadowverse also uses Unity engine tho

You realize that every coder and designer is paid hourly and couldn’t give a shit what the rating of the game is, right?

However, there are winnie the pooh unisex sized jumpsuits in the women's section of sleepwear at target.

Godspeed revolutionaries.
---
October is bloody diarrhea awareness month! How timely!
---
I could get a question through at r/CompetitiveHS, you should go there if you want to actually discuss the game.
---
True. It was more to make a statement about what they would do if other people spoke up. I absolutely believe that if other players or coaches come out in support of Hong Kong China will pull the games entirely. It becomes more an issue about saving face than anything else
---
BLIZZARD IS AT PAX AUSTRALIA RIGHT NOW PRETENDING LIKE NOTHING IS GOING ON
---
Needed that social credit boost real bad didnt ya bud
---
The people with actual brain are playing the game instead of whining on the sub for attention

&gt; Imagine basing your desire to be a subject
---
The data shows there are many more mass shootings in the US compared to other countries. You got data showing otherwise?
---
I don't. You clearly do, which is why I said it as I did.
---
You said they aren’t even remotely related. They clearly are.
---
I didn’t realize you speak for HK and apparently you know they don’t care about the Uyghurs being rounded up and put into concentration camps. 
---
Oh and apparently only westerners care about ethnic cleansing and organ harvesting.
---

---
Oh shit except for this. Oops time for a new narrative.
---
Seriously what is it to you what other people say on the internet? Fuck off.
---
Read the post you want. If everyone is upvoting and posting only about the issue, then that's the interest of the players that otherwise would make the front page.
---
Hmm, it doesn't seem to have removed my review, and it's gone down from 4.2 to 4.0. Maybe because I'm in Canada? Anyway, this is what I said in my review:
---
&gt; A game that has a lot of potential, and I played it for many years, but the developer clearly values money over human rights, so I'm not going to give them any more of my time or money, and you shouldn't either.
---
Sorry, but even if a law is stupid, and they are, you coming to our country and breaking one deserves punishment. Laws are stupid and should be changes, but you guys are suggesting the dumbest little thing be the cause of giant repercussions. You guys are thinking “I’m just one guy.” Well guess what? So was Blitzchung. He’s ONE FUCKING GUY. You want me to lose everything over one fucking idiot for not understanding rules? You want the other 100 million of us because of ONE FUCKING IDIOT? 
---
No. Fuck Blitz. If he respected rules in the slightest, EVERYTHING the last few days wouldn’t be happening. 
---
Stop blaming everything else. We’re trying to make change here. We’re doing what we can. Most of us, though, are NOT breaking laws to do so. Every protestor has the right to be arrested. And for the record, protestors in the US often fall under that same right because of trespassing. And police there have arrested thousands at once. Don’t pretend this only applies to us.
---
I don't try to be a 'bully' to anyone thankfully enough. While what's happening in HK sure is noble from my perspective, I'm just confounded that you wanted to drag blizzard games into this mess in first place.
---
They were made because a bill that's dead now.
---
Since then they've just kind of gone of on a tangent about police accountability, which really it seems like hong kongs existing independent investigations apparatus are sufficient...Obviously there's violence on both sides. And it's obvious the rise in violence from police is reactionary, and being responded to by the government about as well as you can hope...
---
There other demands of having Lam step down, and all protesters in prison being released shouldn't even be considered their so ridiculously...But even those the governments extended olive branches. 
---
Yea I think these protesters are on the wrong side of history. And you know I can't be a bot cause my account is too old.
---
When did the champion link get posted? I haven't seen any of them for GM.
---
Did I say any of that ?  Just that you'd have to being living as a hermit or something to not have heard about the situation in Hong Kong.  
---
They've been protesting for, what, 5 months now ?
---
He has demonstrated that the front page is relevant, and if you believe not enough relevant content is being posted to new, report what isn't relevant and feel free to post your own content to new, which I can see you haven't even tried to do.
---
China has more internet users than Entire NAs population. I think it’s safe to say blizzard is fully committed to suck them Chinese teats. NBAs primary employees are black and politically conscious. They can’t have a business without the ball players. So IMO the situation is a bit different
---
Yep that’s humanity for you. Nothing new though.
---
The sad thing is, I feel like a lot of people could move on if they just said "we messed up, we are reinstating the casters and drastically reducing Blitz' penalty. We are sorry, we have heard your concerns and will refer to our core values in future"  
---
I don't think that would appease everyone, but I do think that it would go a VERY long way toward fixing things.  
---
I think, regardless of what your opinion on the issue is, that it would be in Blizzard's best interest to try and resolve things.
---
Judging by the upvote/downvote ratio of your comment, it appears that you're full of shit.
---
We care, and we stand with Hong Kong.
---
You can play American games if you try hard enough. I used to play DFO on China servers when the game originally shut down.
---
An article posted since Blizz screwed the pooch actually [defended that in some respects.](https://www.esportsheaven.com/features/blitzchung-blizzards-pr-rock-bottom/)
---
&gt;What’s ironic is that in many of these past cases, Blizzard’s core actions can be justified. They make sense. Heroes of the Storm esports needed to shut down, because it was a failure from day one and was oozing money year after year. *The massive layoffs in February needed to happen so that the company could go back to actively developing games again, and not just rehashing 20-year-old franchises and lying to investors that the Overwatch League is the bomb.*
---
&gt;Blizzard’s crime, however, is how these actions were “explained” to the public. In Heroes of the Storm’s case, people were fired ahead of the Christmas holidays, with no forewarning and weeks of silence and uncertainty from HQ. The February layoffs, on the other hand, were put in the context of Blizzard’s most successful quarter yet, creating a massive PR dissonance that naturally caused a worldwide hatred for the company. Even if these were the correct decisions for Blizzard’s business, its executives could not find a better way to explain it to their community. Instead of a discourse, all fans heard was the sound of the greedy getting greedier at the expense of everyone else.
---
Upon further investigation, [Polygon also published an article explaining the situation](https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions). It sounds like the original sin was poor planning, and the crime was poor communication (or lack of humanity, if we really want to cut to the heart of the matter). As is the usual situation in US capitalism, the workers are the ones who pay for the oversights and pratfalls of the executives, as they are the ones that pick up the slack when the business decides to, "rightsize."
---
I finally found something. It says that Blizzard makes only 5.2% of its revenue in China.
---
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-blizzard-faces-corporate-culture-crisis-following-gamer-suspension-2019-10-10
---
If this number is fairly accurate then it's even less than I thought and Blizzard is being insane.
---
 每个声音都很重要 !
---
I tried to make a more midrangy style deck since finley’s effect kinda seems made for it. Also can you give an example for a strong battlecry? Nothing’s coming to my mind rn
---
Good lord your entitled. Thinking the world revolves around your values. Thinking when you go to other countries that you don’t have to follow their laws because it’s not your country. 
---
I’d hate to know you in person. Walking into guests houses and shitting on their floor because, why, you do it at home? Sounds reasonable.
---
&gt;Only the west cares that organs are literally being harvested from prisoners? 
---
Yea hate to tell you but I guarantee the most sympathetic ears on that are, by far, in the west.
---
&gt; If the Chinese are doing this now, imagine what they'll do to HK in retribution for putting them through this.
---
Literally nothing?  Do you think this is the first protest or tensions with mainlanders Hong Kong has ever had?  This has been going on for years.
---
Your country's government is putting ethnic groups in "re-education" camps (uighur Muslims) and has been condemned internationally for its treatment of its national citizens. It still refuses to admit Taiwan even exists as its own entity like some petulant child throwing a tantrum and the same goes for Tibet being its own nation.
---
Trump looks like a fucking Saint compared to DECADES of what China has done.
---
Tiananmen square 2.0 electric boogaloo could very well be a reality before the end of the year, and your concerned about losing your escape in the form of digital entertainment. Shameful.
---
There are definitely people who don’t know. I’m on lunch right now as I type this and my coworker I’m eating with didn’t know. We work in healthcare, so this is a rather educated person. Don’t assume.
---
Old news at this point.
---
Boo hoo, can't enjoy your video game forums because that's more important than human rights and concentration camps.
---
They should have given them all to us all in gold, it's not like we can dust them.
---
Good for you bro, good for you
---
I said you argue like a dickhead because you do. Saying stuff like “the problem is you don’t understand the full gravity of the situation” is arguing like a pretentious dickhead. Taking away his prize money and removing him from grandmasters is in their competition rules, but banning him for a year is ridiculous and unfair. I also have no idea why you think that they banned him for 12 months bc they think the protests will be over by then and not bc they want to make an example out of him to appease their Chinese consumers/shareholders. He didn’t advocate violence, he didn’t advocate genocide, he didn’t support an authoritarian government, he supported the Hong Kong protests. Blizzard isn’t banning him bc they thought his statements were immoral, they are banning him bc his statements offended Chinese people. Personally I don’t enjoy seeing an esports competitor’s livelihood unfairly fucked up by a multi billion dollar corporation bc of a political comment he made on stream, but you do you bootlicker
---
I'm with you bud! #deletehearthstone
---
Brave Move guys!
---
#freehongkong
---
This dude is a real hero here.
---
Maybe if it were like them yelling "tianenmen square" bad, but otherwise I seriously think banning NBA in China would cause legitimately bad civil unrest.  These guys really eat drink sleep and work basketball, like it's beyond what people consider mega fans in the US.
---
The megathreads are stickied to the top of the sub so I can’t think a better way for it to not get buried. 
---
Honestly if a player said something pro China and blizzard banned him I doubt this sub will bat an eye. I rather see the company stay away from politics and alienate either side their fan base. It will only result in mass layoffs for legitimate workers if they lose the business in China, the layoffs might not affect you but it affects thousands of innocent people.
---
&gt; I don't think you understand the situation most of these people are actually in. Their options are continue working or quit for a minimum wage job until they can rebuild their career from slightly more than scratch. And that's assuming they aren't in a contract. 
---
&gt; They will likely lose their home because they can't afford it while rebuilding their career. And if they have a family, their decision is also to lose their children/SO's home. They may never actually be able to rebuild their career - possibly permanently turning from a provider to a financial burden.
---
I understand fine. That's why I said I wouldn't blame them. But it doesn't alter the situation
---
&gt; I suspect you're still young enough that you haven't had to worry about these decisions yet - but it would do you well to try and understand just what's at stake for the individual employee.
---
You suspect wrong.
---
I am not going to change your deluded mind anyways. But let me guess a few things about you:
---
\-You are a white american from a lower class background which you blame for your lack of education
---
\-you are very unatractive becuase you eat like a pig
---
\-you have never learned tolerance and are victim to populist media
---
\-You don't understand what communism nor capitalism truly are 
---
\-You take pride in being an american because it is one of the only things you have
---
\-You are afraid of what you don't know
---
So instead of standing up for the rights of people you just wanna collect your virtual cards, cause that’s way more important.
---
The core issue should be the horrible stuff China is doing to it's own people but the Outrage is still on Blizzard being against free speech and while that is wrong I do thing the Internet Outrage is directed at the wrong thing
---
Wow this will show them!
---
When you realize Blizzard's stock hasn't even dipped anywhere close to last's month, and that was without some virture signaling pity party going on.
---
Spam this kong to play ping-pong
---
🤡
---
Yes, that’s what this sub and hearthstone is about.
---
Wait should I play or not play hearthstone
---
Are you an Oxford comma guy, too?
---
I'll get back on topic but first what's the origin of that leaf charging symbol?
---
And someone who plays the game on a professional level got banned because he was standing up for the rights of himself and his people and was BANNED for it. You don’t see how that’s relevant?
---
The authorial leftists often called Tankies
---
wait a minute - people are spamming the same thing over and over again in Twitch chat?  Whatever will Hearthstone do?
---
Yes. Everything published or developed by ATVI/Blizzard should be on the “NOPE!” list.
---
Wont they just have twitch ban the icon?
---
To be honest, it still surprised me that the rest of the world take such a hands-off approach to the problems of China.  I mean, I've never lived there but it just sounds like their government is inherently evil, yet all that other governments of the world can see is a trading partner and a country they're too scared to offend.
---
I'm uncertain of your stance here. You both admit that your government is in the wrong but believe they should be appeased anyway because... it offers short-term benefit to you? What about the actual issues regarding your country? Or Hong Kong? Or Tencent? Do you just think it should be left alone because you benefit from it? When do things get to change, when you die of old age?
---
(just play gwent)
---
Yet HS players in GM and casters who are not stepping down have made comments without being impacted. Perhaps those running OWL or the teams themselves are trying to stay out of the equation, but it doesn't appear there is a larger Blizzard directive to silence people. No one has been able to corroborate that Blizzard specifically even requested Jayne to take the tweet down, only that someone directed him to do so. Blizzard is certainly a likely candidate, but it would also make sense for the team to request it if Dallas Fuel have Chinese interests or are looking to recruit a Chinese player.
---
The people who lost their jobs lost them because *blizzard chose to fire them*. You might notice that this is what everyone is mad about.
---
Blizzard being banned in China would’ve costed thousands of people their jobs and there would be a Grandmasters at all over there.
---
My man

Rogue deck in tavern brawl has a spell that fills your hand with coins.  Opponent’s passive copies spell casted.  Filled my hand twice, played all the coins, then played Edwin.
---
I don't see how? If blizzard ban both then it'd be fair.
---
You know, streamers can get a real job instead.
---

What blizzard is doing so far is nothing neutral. The word political neutral if you look at public administration is that no matter which party steps up, it will execute every order. But now what blizzard is doing is definitely not neutral

There’s one of two aspects in any business. One causes a business to crash. The other causes success. Neither is about money. You care about the person or you don’t. The money shows which side you take. When a company starts not focusing on the person, the crash. 
---
Blizzard has shown time and time again that they still care about the person. If they don’t, that’s a new change as of 3 days ago. And they will fall because of it. That said, there’s no evidence suggesting that they don’t still care about people. After all, their games have saved lives of depressed people. If I were them, that would be a driving force for me to publish worldwide in any way that I can..... 
---
...except China? No. If I was them and that was my driving cause is to help people, then I would abide by every single Chinese law to be there. I would do this knowing some people will get angry. That doesn’t automatically make it so the people there don’t get a sense of relief on my games—help with their depression, whatever it is. 
---
Even though it’s not about money in my scenario, I wouldn’t publish my game in a country that brings me substantially into the negative with no profits unless it’s made up for elsewhere. It’s not about the profit, but I cannot maintain a business like that, which means nothing for anyone. 
---
You’re talking to someone who has done his fair share of entrepreneurialism. I’ve traveled around the world and seen how business operates everywhere. I know how this all ends: no change and everyone forgetting about it. Because ultimately, these stands are not the right method of fixing things. They’re the wrong method. It’s not peaceful—and that’s a problem.
---
It's easier to read. It's now 200times more popular than it used to be

You don't seem to be capable of reading.

Communism is literally a replacement for capitalism. Nothing can be both capitalist and communist. They are mutually exclusive. Communism is not when the government does things.
---
That's my beef with boycotts. It's never just "I'm going to stop buying X because I support Y", it eventually also must include "you're a bad person for not doing what I'm doing too how dare you"
---
I won't go so far as to call this the outrage of the week, mind you. It's a multi-faceted issue with no good answers, and alot of misteps made over the last 40 years lead up to our current situation with China. This whole thing is just another stone on the path of nobody knowing how to handle it.
---
Ah, yes, the "One joke"
---
I'm not the person you respondied to, so as a third party, I'll just say he wasn't vague.
---
This is mostly an OWL thing, though I agree that it's an issue with all Blizzard esports.
---
With the OWL though, the control is iron-tight. There exists no free press regarding the OWL.  You either are in Blizzard's pocket (via access), and report on things only Blizzard allows you to, or what makes them look good only, or you turn into Slasher or Richard Lewis and just focus on reporting shit that other outlets won't report -- which in 9 cases out of 10 are controversies and other dirt that would make OWL look bad.
---
With mystical mirage, magic mirror and stone fox statue, i get these good boys
---
I never referred to myself when I said support, so maybe learn to read. The definition of the word also includes: "to be actively interested in and concerned for the success of". The best part is, I knew exactly what you'd reply - have you ever had an original thought?
---
Quit attacking Storm Troopers, this is how they put food on the table. We need to focus on the Death Star. ...the fuck are you talking about? Anyone playing or watching a blizzard game is directly supporting Chinese censorship.
---
So, you're ok suppressing free speech as long as you dislike the message 
---
Free speech doesn't mean "free to express opinions I agree with it". You're either all in or you're not, judging by your statement
---
Newsflash
---
 Twitch chat is ALWAYS a crazy mess. I don't think they really care
---
Yeah, this whole mess does nothing to Activision/ blizzard, thier stock has risen since this event and in the end only thing that matters is impact to investors
---
The classic wow community is notoriously trash.  This is not a surprise.
---
I fully agree with you and those saying thats not true are naive as hell. If Blizzard does anything in terms of banning pro players and such they will essentially be stepping on a second landmine. Anyways welcome to mob mentality whereas it no longer matters about all the facts, just the ones people care about now.
---
Some of it *is* karma whoring and/or ineffective.
---
Leaving one star reviews of the app that say nothing about the game is lazy and won't actually help because they'll (fairly) get removed for not being actual reviews.
---
Spamming protest comments in threads about gameplay is obnoxious and immature.
---
Claiming mods are censoring for deleting the umpteenth repost of a meme we've seen a million times this week despite their allowing tons of protest related posts that would have normally broken rules (the right thing considering the situation) makes the cause look ignorant.
---
Likewise, there definitely *are* some anti-protest trolls here, but a lot of people here are too overzealous to realize they're hurting their cause.
---
Which brings me to a point. China is 12% of Blizzards overall revenue. They’re choosing to keep 12% of their revenue which they actually stand to lose in the NA market after all of this. They stand to lose more by catering to China. I really don’t get the thought process here. If it were me, I’d pull out of China.
---
I think if you’re spending your time posting on reddit but not emailing your govt representatives  then yeah, you’re just making yourself feel better by karma whoring and not doing anything to help the situation. Think this applies to you? Then do something about it and stop spamming everyone else.

Educate yourselves and do something instead of jumping on the outrage bandwagon for a change and then people will take your argument seriously.
---
"Oh no. Those bandits who are trying to kill you for your money needs to feed their families too, you gotta let them get away with it"
---
Corps do not get to use their employees as a human shield when their wrong doings comes back to bite them. Especially for a corps who have demonstrated that they do not give a shit about the employees in the firsr place.
---
Yeah none of this changes the fact that the employees got fired, OR justifies it. I don't care how you frame it, a single employee being let go is WRONG when Bobby kotick is making whatever ungodly amount of money it is. Explaining that the decision was objective, to raise the bottom line doesn't do anything.
---
The fact you use the laughing emoji on Reddit tells me more than I need to know.
---
Sure, but blizzard hasnt had the chance to apply the rule to anyone else.
---
That'd be like calling a teacher sexist for punishing a boy for cheating, but not a girl, even though no girls tried to cheat.
---
Lol, reddit at it again with thinking they’re hurting a giant corporation in the slightest. Also , stop talking about it like we’re leading a movement against the worlds greatest evil, you’re deleting an account from a video game company lol.
---
If Blizzard doesn't care about their reputation anymore, the only thing we can do about it is make sure that everybody knows it.
---
this might enlighten.
---
I'm gunna make the assumption that he isn't alt-right, he's just "alt-right". Meaning you think that anyone who isn't on the left must be "alt-right".
---
But to be frank, chinese market is very underdeveloped, because it has only opened to gaming companies recently. This is why all game companies are rushing to it and trying to get the best spots. It's not about the current revenue, it's about the long term revenue, they're already planning to leave the saturated north american market. With the boom in mobile gaming in Asia, they have all the reasons to go over, from a business perspective.
---
Why are you getting mad at the truth?
---
It is just blatant karma whoring. You really think you can topple an entire country by spamming shitty memes on reddit? Especially one that's as fucking huge as China?
---
I'm not supporting China and I don't agree with what they do, but  if ppl really think the world will change cause some idiots spam Winnie Pooh and Mei pictures 24/7 you are just dumb and delusional
---
Plus there's hardly any game related contant left, it's just karma whoring day in and day out. HK good, china bad, updoots to the left. Gib gildings LUL XD
---
I was talking about the fairness of the ruling. If you back on side while censoring the other, you cannot say that you are fair
---
I think thats the example our people are so stupid......I It happened in Wuhan，government is just going to build an environmentally friendly waste incinerator plant，and haven't decided where to build it yet ，but the people believed the rumor that the plant is toxic and will be build near their home......the government also made mistakes，I think since the protestors didn't use violence the police shouldn't use violence either。In the end, the news was bound to be blocked, because although it is only a second-tier city ，there were 12 million people in wuhan....... in democracy I think we  still need at least 20 years of development to reach the level of US。

He has? Never heard of him.
---
The people of Hong Kong have protested since June, risking their personal safety, jobs, reputation and even lives doing so. So it's not too much to ask that we support them for at least a few weeks, online and risk-free.
---
Anyone using reddit is directly supporting Chinese censorship moron.
---
In a lot of chats Hong Kong is banned. But Hong “word” Kong is not
---
Why are you assuming I didn't email my government?
---
I do think it goes for OWWC &amp; OWC aswell (Ellie story for example)
---
Imagine you're making demagogue shitposts like this meanwhile the worst of a lot of people's problems all over the world, are being shot in the face, dying in protest, starving and actually living under the thumb of extremely oppressive and literally genocidal regimes. Every fucking day. Where was your outrage a week ago? A month ago? A year ago?
---
You're absolutely short sighted and entitled. You can take a back seat with your issues, bud.
---
I'd prefer if, instead of making such general statements, you specifically said what specifically I should know about the topic that I don't.
---
Logged in yesterday for the first time in months expressly to delete my account.

I've never been a diehard Blizzard fan, but now I don't see how they'll ever get my business again. Vote with your dollars, don't let this die, free HK!
---
And I would have had a better time believing that they did it for apolitical reasons if they have not prostrate before china in their following statements. It makes it seems like it's not about politics, but about them not wanting to offend china
---
Was just banned for spamming that exact thing. exactly 3 day ban(enough for them to silence me and others through this GM weekend).

Most people would rather bitch and moan in an attempt to act morally superior they won't ever try to achieve real change. Know why? Because as long as it doesn't impact them they dont care.
---
 They wont throw away their pcs or mobile devices which all generate revenue for China, they wont stop drinking apple juice, they wont stop wearing Chinese cloths, they wont stop eating products made in China,they wont stop driving cars made in China... Give them a one dimensional bad guy and they'll bitch forever.
---
Yeah this it's the major problem a lot of people seem to be having trouble understanding.
---
X category of person breaks some rule.
---
No one in category Y has broken this rule yet, and this no one category Y has been punished.
---
You're saying, look the only people they are punishing are people in group X, without considering no one in group Y has broken the rule.
---
Is the 2010 red shirt guy someone I should know?
---
I'll answer to you the same as people requesting that the issue become a megathread instead of big time spam: just wait a couple day, then come back. It's all gonna be over pretty soon
---
I keep trying to get people to understand this issue is like being concerned with a rust spot on the boat taking on a little water while ignoring they’re on the Titanic and just hit an iceberg. 
---
I’ve been trying for years to do what I can to limit my family’s contribution to the Chinese economy  by not buying Chinese made goods when possible. It’s my belief any company doing business with or in China is part of the problem. To do business there, you have to agree to the government’s ways. 
---
I’m not quitting my Blizzard subscription: I’ve known all along Blizzard was doing business with China. I’ve known China was oppressing others. The only thing that’s changed this week is that they told someone one their payroll they couldn’t use Blizzard assets to risk their business dealings and really, that’s true anywhere in the world. I can’t go to work at a butcher store and expect my boss to keep me employed for yelling Meat Is Murder every time someone asked me for ground chuck. It’s going to cost my boss business. 
---
Since you’re educated, I’m wondering if you’ve given up your subscription or plan to?
---
"You took a stance when you began trying to explain that they did this solely because of the rules and nothing else."
---
I didn't say that anywhere.  You could maybe infer from what I said that I think Blizz was within their rights to punish Blitz, but I definitely never came close to saying anywhere that Blizz was right to do so or that the rule was their only reason for doing so.
---
sounds like a shitpost... if you were asking a real question you would post the naming guidelines...
---
&gt; were not informed their baby could no longer drink the mother's milk.
---
Slight correction; Nestle pulled out of most of those programs when they were in the spotlight for how immoral it was convincing some of the poorest people in the world to spend what little money they had on formula when it wasn't needed. But, rather than do a controlled and phased withdrawal, they up and left.
---
Mothers stop producing very early after childbirth if they don't breastfeed so when the formula suddenly was unavailable, there were newborns, infants and toddlers whose mothers hadn't breastfed at all so weren't producing.
---
Communities were literally running their own 'donor mum' programs where any woman who could produce would try to help anyone else.. It was a disaster, infants mortality rates jumped so high in all the effected places.
---
Extream punishment? The punishment he got was the exact punishment outlined in the rules. Dude knew what he was getting him self into.
---
We're deleting low effort meme posts.
---
But what about the casters? They clearly encouraged Blitzchung and only giggled and hid behind their desks when it happens instead of doing what they contract said, which is: Act in the interests of your employer.
---
When Blitz showed up with the mask during the interview they immediately needed to intervene by saying something like "Please lets not get political". Something along those lines. They could have defused the situation a lot, even if they only made a statement immediately after the interview that Blitzchung only spoke for himself and not for Blizzard blah blah...
---
It may sound harsh, but as an employer you can't afford to have people live-casting your events you don't trust 100%. With that action, they lost the trust of their employer and thus getting fired is the expected consequence...
---
I haven’t made any reviews so I’m not sure what your talking about. 
---
My entire post is predicated on the fact that a massive Hearthstone update hit at the same one as the outrage over blizzard’s censorship debacle. There could absolutely have been legitimate reviews, both good or bad, about the game after Oct. 7 that would get caught up in google’s blanket deletion (which is another example of censorship).
---
So I guess there wasn’t a rule against cheating, since Roger was allowed to compete for months afterwards and attend the world championships? Apparently some rules are just a little more important than others
---
How does this card work exactly?
---
Agreed but at least it isn’t blizzard and the game itself is infinitely better than hearthstone to begin with

If you are support human right, don't play the game until the company says something.

If you don't care, I don't have much to say
---
Great Article bud. I deleted my apps from pc and phone and removed the battlenet launcher. I can't bring myself to play those games right now. If I do end up being OK playing, It will be as free to play. Not giving them another cent. But I am taking atleast a week or two off to evaluate if I can even play free to play without feeling dirty. This many days of silence on Blizzard's part is sickening. Take the loss of Chinese market and reverse your decision with Blitzchung and the casters, what is wrong with Blizzard.
---
I would go to blizzcon and protest outside, but I'm in school :(. I feel like it would add more weight to blizzards actions. In order for it to work we would need a ton of people to show up. It would be cool if there was Mei cosplayers with face masks and Winnie the Pooh.
---
You could argue that, but the solution isn't then to continue making political statements.
---
You forgot spaghetti code
---
Dear Redditors, I feel that the voice of Hong Kong is only heard in a single direction and there is more than what is being told to us...i find this comment quite enlightening.
---
good bot
---
"Dont let HK be forgotten" lmao be more dramatic will you
---
I'm going to give a rough translation on the answer with highest votes:
---
The first paragraph: It's normal. Anyone who understand Blizzard's e-sports are clear that it has nothing much to do with NBA (refers to Morey's), as Blizzard has been always serious about the penalties on their e-sports players or stuff who violate the rule (refers to  Section 6.1 of the 2019 Hearthstone Grandmasters Official Competition Rules) of no racial/political/gender statements are allowed to make: from warning and paying fines to firings or banning from competition.
---
The second and third paragraphs are two examples of penalties (OWL player with sad frog meme, and  Chinese players who made offending comments on a hostess being punished) imposed by Blizzard.
---
Edit: removed quote
---
&gt; Where was your outrage a week ago? A month ago? A year ago?
---
Do you follow me around or something, or are you using me as an outlet to vent your non-issues to, trying desperately to delegitimize the entire HK movement (which involves people talking about this).
---
It's pretty sad that Hearthstone posts, of all things, lead you to an "everyone has problems" rant during a fucking massive protest to protect the rights of its people. You're a disgusting person.
---
There are no good platforms to F2P online.
---
I don't understand why you're so against the idea of analyzing yourself. 
---
Instead you're just more interested in repeating what you've already said for a third? time.
---
What damage did the original cause that deserves to be punished so severely?
---

---
Yes if anyone is boycotting Blizzcon you can send your ticket to me at TotallywontresellonEbay@notascalp.com
---
Very easy to downplay losing your rights when they aren't your rights.
---
Sure, but then this is in direct odds with their statement that if they pulled out of China, the lights would go out. Nor do the numbers support the thesis that the workforce in Blizzard would be cut down in size if China was not a market they could pursue.
---
You need to consider the totality of their actions.  People have cheated in Hearthstone tournaments before, literally illegally stealing prize money... and Blizzard doled out a less severe punishment less quickly.
---
There would probably be zero outrage if Blizzard had said "You're out of GM if you do that again" or even "We are counting that match as a loss because we don't allow discussion of world events."  But they ruined Blitzchung's career and two innocent caster's careers.  That was a little too much for the people that provide 88% of Blizzard's revenue, and we're pushing back.  If Blizzard wants our money, they are going to have to be more reasonable with punishments in the future.  They can't throw 3 people under the bus because China wants them to.  Well they can, but they may find that their funding dries up quickly.
---
Bellytony and motherbird are either Chinese or trolls. Surely no one outside of China can be genuinely serious about welcoming China
---
&gt; Sorry, no, that’s a corporate shill excuse to use them as meat shields.
---
That's not an *excuse*. It's the reality of the situation. An excuse would be reasoning not to do it. What I've told you is the simple objective fact of who will suffer if what you wish for comes to pass. You will be hitting the working-class people like you. Not the people responsible for this decision.

Ok I’m all on board with fuck Blizzard. But Reddit has this obsession with using stock “drops” as a way to show how we won and the “damage”. Even though it’s always negligible and goes back up the next day.
---
&gt;“Some of us are afraid to go to work now because our fans and employees are angry and want answers I don't have and shouldn't have to give. I'm afraid that as people leave us in droves, my job will disappear in another round of layoffs. I'm sure most around me wonder the same thing. I want to be principled and join the brave folks standing outside our gates or around the orc, but I also know how hard it is to get a job I loved as much as this one. I still love my project; I love my coworkers; my love and respect for Blizzard is diminished.”

---
Yeah but then... China.
---
Explain how what is happening among consumers and being described on Reddit is only an "online petition."
---
IT. IS. A. FUCKING. OFFICIAL. BLIZZARD. ACCOUNT. YOU. ABSOLUTE. MORON.
---
&gt;&gt; an **official Blizzard account** run by the company's Chinese publishing partner Netease took a tougher stance.
---
NETEASE PUBLISHES BLIZZARD GAMES IN CHINA. Do you really want to sit here and tell me that because ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD's AMERICAN BRANCH didn't publish this that it's not from Blizzard, when it was made using and, again, an **OFFICIAL FUCKING BLIZZARD ACCOUNT**? And you call ME the idiot? You're so unbelievably dumb it's hard to even stomach.
---
It took my a minute but now I see what you did. Take my upvote.
---
How would you justify a chargeback.  "I don't agree with their stance on human rights" isn't a valid reason your credit card company will accept.
---
&gt; It's just the unfortunate reality that in any conflict (war and financial), it is always the people at the bottom who suffer most.

And it's easy to say that "any war needs sacrifice" when it's not your buttocks getting fired at by the enemy.

Well considering Cuba is communist....
---
This is what happens when you bend the knee!!
---
The good it would do is to show China that Blizzard won't export its totalitarian notions of what speech is and is not acceptable.  By your logic, no company should ever take a stand because another company might not be as principled.  That's exactly what China is counting on.  But it has to start somewhere and I'm hoping that Blizzard will decide to be a leader.  If every company just goes along for the sake of profit, nothing will ever change.
---
I never considered some people are curious about Hearthstone just from this controversy.
---
They are making a choice supporting themselves by playing a game made by people who are funded by people who do not support human rights. 
---
No one is forcing them to play HS, no one is forcing them to stream, no one is forcing them to only stream HS. This is a choice they are making, and by not changing the game they play and trying to spark change in peers, they are being silent. 
---
That's all I'm saying, if HS streams/streamers don't change anything then this issue will be forgotten. 30k people watching GM right now, 30k people are silently giving the okay to be censored by money and by China.
---
That's always the response to keep people in silence, isn't it.
---
I don't think not buying Blizzard games will impact China's political party in any way. You can't outcorporate corporations. The only thing that would work are tariffs and sanctions.
---
Only a gold? This needs a platinum!
---
Except he's proven it wasn't a fresh account.
---
“Sir...you’ve been in a coma for a week.”
---

---
I don't expect them to do good. I do not project moral obligation on them. I am saying we should punish them when they do wrong. Again being a company obsessed with making money is not a valid justification. It is a reason. Reasons do not keep someone from being punished when they do wrong.
---
And all the hardcore fans that goes there year after year after year to meet friends and coworkers will not feel any bit of pity if you're disrupting the event for them. At that point you're just another asshole.
---
This is about human rights. Yeah, boycotts and protests will likely have a negative effect on Blizzard employees, many of which are innocent and have nothing to do with the situation. Does that mean we should stop fighting for human rights because it might hurt a company's bottom line? 
---
Lives are at stake in Hong Kong and any show of support from the rest of the world could help change things for the better. It sucks for Blizzard employees but if we don't act because they might get hurt then we have chosen a company over innocents facing down a dictatorship. One is more important than the other.
---
&gt;So politically and legally google may not have done anything wrong, however ethically I disapprove of that practice of censorship.
---
Personally I would say that is going a bit far to suggest that it is unethical *not* to flagrantly break the law in a country like China.  So unless you are suggesting that Google should pull out of China completely (and honestly I think that hurts the Chinese population far more than banning any app could) I think they took the only course of action they reasonably could.

---
They could have killed him.
---
&gt; “In a year of corporate trauma, this is yet another wound that will take years to recover from,” the employee said. “We have had crisis after crisis this year thrust upon us with little or no warning.” In February, Activision Blizzard reported record profits of $2.4 billion. On the same earnings call, the company announced it fired 8 percent of their workforce, roughly 800 people.
---
Context is important. These employees have already been traumatized by bad event after bad event even just in this year.
---
In addition, I think people commenting in this thread are not realizing what protests can lead to.
---
This kind of stuff is supposed to happen, the ones on the bottom line will suffer unfortunately, and Blizzard will most likely punish them.
---
That's the system in place in America. With no government regulations the only way to punish a corporation is to starve them on money and as always, the people at the bottom will suffer just like any other time when they are making slightly less money than usual.
---
If you don't want such PR disasters to affect people on the bottom so much, then keep this in mind for the next elections. This isn't a problem specific to Activision-Blizzard and neither do I think should any political movement silence itself just because the higher-ups who already have acted immoral will fire their employees to compensate for losses. These higher-ups will take any reason to fire and re-hire people for the same jobs just to save money (which they already did this year).
---
But if both the internet and the real world didn't get so involved in this, the higher-ups could have just kept pushing the envelope further, possibly even censoring Western players (like the American University) during HS tournaments if you dare say something negative to China.
---
I can understand if you are tired of this entire debacle. It's fine if you just want this entire thing to already have blown over, but please recognize that to a lot of people this is important and that worker's despairing isn't something that people on the internet are at fault for. It's a complex matter and it's ultimately the system working just as intended.
---
If you don't want this to happen, then you recognize that our system needs more work. We can do something about that, too.
---
I don't think they did anything wrong either, if that wasn't obvious.
---
A business isn't a moral entity, and in my opinion they had no obligation to platform any political speech.
---
Only that in this case, they *would* be my civil rights, so your statement about his statement is absolutely stupid.
---
41:07 ... sigh ...
---
this guy gets it.
---
Best thing is probably to start organizing planned protests in front of Blizzcon right now to get media coverage. Making this story as public as possible and letting Blizzard dig their own grave in the west.
---
Hey! I'm just here to watch it burn and for posts like this now.
---
Yea i guess, but the horsemen's minion has his own fireball passive, and that passive just kills him while i assumed i had to kill off that minion by myself
---
You can stand outside with the "God hates gays" and "Jesus will save you" crowd and shant. But do not interrupt the main stage with a protest, the crowd will turn on you in an instant.
---
&gt; you can't keep the lights on when we lose income from China
---
Horseshit. This quote makes it seem like propaganda to lessen the blow when they announce that they're still buddies with China
---
Update name checks out.
---
I’m saying people expect them to willingly throw their jobs away but it’s a lot harder to do that then to say they should and  most people would not do that
---
They had no obligation, yet they are obviously biased in their ruling and hypocritical in the extreme. It is their right to do whatever they want on their platforms but their justifications were flimsy and I don't think people are happy with that
---
The American University team held up a "Free Hong Kong" sign right after this and wasn't banned. Again, Blizzard could have imposed a lesser penalty but chose not to because it wanted to appease a totalitarian regime.
---
People joining stream to spam?
---
I'm guessing thousands to tens of thousands deleted accounts, cancelled subscription, and otherwise voiced their concerns. As far as the internet is considered, this is pretty fucking huge. 
---
This controversy has brought more direct attention to the China issue than ever before. Don't be negative, this is all a good thing.
---
How about pretty much anything Jim Raynor. He spent two games branded as a terrorist for fighting against oppressive authoritative regimes.
---
Lads about the stock part, I'm aware the stock has gone up now and that the market was down that day, I just thought it would be funny to play on it, I feel the bigger issue here is more important
---
There are a few ways. As Blizzard already proved, it's not just about being in the green. If they suddenly make a lot less than they thought it could lead to downsizing/layoffs. They undoubtedly have whole departments dedicated to projecting future revenue. This not only dictates their future plans, but expectations are baked into the stock prices. Actually cutting off a region that is 10% of your revenue and expected to exponentially grow in the medium turn would tank their stock. Being publicly traded also leaves them with a legal obligation to their stock holders ("fiduciary duty") to maximize the value of their company.
---
I'm sorry.
---
You could have checked the action bar history thing to see what generated it.
---
Like "Created by xxx"
---
Feel free to point out those censorship actions so I can review and judge for myself.  Not sure how you can relate my comment to this though.  I didn't unsub, I said I don't watch content from Blizzard, as I won't watch content from Reddit.  But Reddit is more of a platform than a content creator.  The people who are posting are the creators.  Just like I will watch youtube, and other videos that those streamers and youtubers make.  You seem to want to build a straw man to knock down.  You may want to review your stance.
---
For many, doing something is better than doing nothing.

Never listen to stock talk on gamer forums. They have no idea what they are talking about. They see a drop and attribute it to something, they see a slight raise and attribute to something else.
---
You have the freedom to not care. You also have the freedom to support a company that supports horrors. And I am free to inform you that it makes you a piece of shit to support that company while turning a blind eye to the atrocities they openly and unabashedly support. Everyone's free to do as they please. I mean except the people in HK who are getting beaten, tortured and killed but hey, not giving a shit and supporting the company that supports it doesnt make YOU a bad guy. Except it does.
---
Rather be delusional and in the right than give in myself. 
---
Sometimes it’s about reconciling with your own moral system, regardless of the more widespread effect. 
---
Do what you will, and I will do as I will.
---
Unfortunately the answer isn't easy. International government pressure is the only thing that could potentially ring in the CCP. Trump, love him or hate him, has been applying more pressure than anyone via the trade war, regardless of whether you think his intentions are pure or not, yet even he was reported to turning the other cheek on Hong Kong just so that trade talks could progress.
---
The sad truth is the world is busy domestically as this Hong Kong situation isn't even the worst thing China is *currently* doing. It's important to remember that they are *currently* engaging in the genocide of their ethnic-Muslim community. However, the US is busy with Trump's impeachment which includes now the Turkey/Kurd situation, the UK is busy with Brexit which is holding up the EU, and we all know that Russia could give a fuck less what China does as long as it doesn't affect them.
---
So the three biggest entities that at least rival China are busy with incredibly problematic, domestic disputes or simply don't care. This is part of the reason, I would imagine, they are so emboldened at the moment. There are people in front of the UN stating that the Uighur people are *having their organs harvested*, yet the only action that has occurred is the US applying some sanctions and visa restrictions on some Chinese nationals.
---
Realistically, Activision Blizzard could stand with Hong Kong and maybe start a wave of other game developers following suit given how China will tell Blizzard to fuck off. That can be financially risky, however, and while I wouldn't be shocked to hear the Blizzard side of the company being okay with that risk, we all know how the Activision side operates. In fact, there was an article written yesterday that said the Activision brass may have been the ones who okayed this call as they are still waiting for Chinese approval to release their mobile Call of Duty game.
---
TLDR Until the world can get its shit together, China will just continue down this path. The issue is the longer it takes, the harder it will be to reverse.
---
*50% of the world population disagrees with this comment*

Make sure to listen to the Chinese anthem and watch videos of Mao while you play.

Easy to downplay human rights in hong kong because your afraid od losing your job too. This employee is making it sound like theyre in a howtage situation.
---
Freedom, you violated the right to not have Freedom
---
Because as long as Activision can keep its name out and let people keep blaming Blizzard, they're fine.
---
Right, they deserve much worse but we're taking it easy today.
---
What are you speechless about
---
Damn my fastest is 12 minutes, nice
---
There isn't one. Best you can do is to not spend your money where companies are doing things you do not agree with.
---
Not really invested in any of those companies but I've played Blizzard's games for many years and spent a lot of money on. I'm not perfect but this was something I felt that I could, and needed , to do.
---
You do you, brother. Don't let anyone pressure you into a position you're not comfortable with. Life is hard enough as it is. If playing Hearthstone makes it even a little bit better, keep playing and enjoy yourself.
---
If you wanna help support the cause, maybe choose to not spend money on the game and get packs with gold only. You can also avoid their official streams and not give them views. Or hell, anything else you might think of.
---
I'm telling your retarded ass that China requires most companies to publish and engage their products via a middleman Chinese company. Do you honestly think blizzard, apple, or any other fucking company doing business in China has any say in what happens with their product unless they want their ip stolen and produced by a knockoff Chinese company? You honestly don't understand how these situations work. You are a dolt and an imbecile. You can't fathom that once the product or company is running in China it's essentially out of their hands. Not to mention if they were actually in control of it instead of netease and didn't comply some of their employees might get arrested or worse. But no that shit doesn't matter to dumb fucks like you. You get to sit over here in the west on your high horse like you actually have to deal with the fucking repercussions you fucking tool.
---
Fuck yes. Keep the momentum going.
---
You're probably arguing with a literal teenager that doesn't rely on a job, just a heads up
---
I've been looking everywhere to find a source that China accounts for 5% of Blizzard's revenue. Only found stats regarding Asia Pacific. If you can find those articles can you link them please?
---
What do you mean continue censoring? They haven't censured anyone as of yet.
---
Find me 180k upvoted post of the new blizzard flag that was basically blizzard on the china flag. 
---
Funny how that's gone...
---
Whether people agree or not makes no difference on whether they were right or not.
---
People hate this ruling, but what their other option, lose the Chinese market completely?
---
It's easy as non-Chinese citizens to say that, but what about the millions of Chinese gamers who would no longer have access to blizzard games?
---
&gt;It's an official blizzard account that is run by their partner netease
---
Oh, I see.  So it's an official blizzard account.  Thanks.
---
I often here the employees are the ones who represent the company so they have to act appropriately. But I'm believing more and more that shouldnt be the case. Its the Company who should be acting appropriately to represent its employees.

I understand that people feel for the employees. Hell I have a good friend who is in the middle of all of this. But all the protesting, all the angry is not directed at that single person. The company as a whole is failing to show the ideology that many employees do have. I understand that maybe not everyone at blizzard cares so much about certain political issues or even what just occurred and just wants to earn their pay check. But the company is the one who decided to act in such a way that endangers their own employees and to put them in that situation.

You know how moms always ask whether you’d jump off a bridge if everyone else did it? Well, same concept here. Just because others AREN’T doing the right thing doesn’t mean you and I shouldn’t.

Do you have a portfolio or website of your photos you could share? Personal hobby

And that is the crux of the problem with Beyond meat. I would buy a Beyond Whopper or Beyond famous star when I go to get fast food, but it is the most expensive thing on the menu.
---
Fake news they have 0 control of that account.
---
Thanks for presenting these in a reasonable way and being neutral and respectful even though your last comment was downvoted to hell. But I'm afraid there's some sort of confusion going on here. 
---
Your first link, which you titled "Only Playing Straight Characters" has nothing to do with 'straight characters' at all. The guy got banned for only picking Torbjorn, and not being willing to swap for any situation. I personally don't agree with that decision, but it has nothing to do with politics.
---
Your next link, "Offsite 'Toxic' Comments" actually opens with the article writer stating that Blizzard had come forward and said that their words were misinterpreted. They aren't banning people based on their Youtube comments, rather they are banning people who upload Overwatch videos where they are being toxic--such as when xQc reported all the members of his team after HE decided to start throwing. I have strong opinions on xQc.
---
Your last link is a little harder to argue with, because it's such a weird issue. As much as I hate xQc, it's genuinely hard to tell if spamming that one emote of a black guy's face is racist or not. But I think what happened here is that Blizzard perceived it as racist, and they needed to send a message out to the public. So they chose to use xQc as an example. 
---
And although I do remember people jumping down people's throats for saying Ellie was a guy, I really don't remember anyone getting banned. I believe it's a possibility, but as I don't remember it I'm not willing to take a stranger's word for it, no offence /:
---
Source?
---
Yep especially when they have a superior competitor that's still private. The value is there for long term nonmeat options, but they are putting too much on just them.
---
Ez blizzard.
---
I genuinely feel awful for the myriads of creative teams within Blizzard. This article does a great job highlighting how dramatic the rift is between the artists and designers working on projects they love with the games they grew up with; and the corporate fuckheads who are blindly following the green into the laps of the CCP.
---
Blizzard isn't a homogenous entity and I'm sure this situation is absolutely mortifying for the low-mid level employees who depend on this job and love what they do, who now fear retaliation from both their higher ups *and* from their fans.
---
If there's a silver lining to this, it's that this article reveals that the pressure is working and cracks are growing. We've got to keep the pressure on. In an ideal universe, corporate would get absolutely nuked for this and creative would get to be basically untouched. Unfortunately this isn't an ideal universe and I'm afraid there's going to be a lot of collateral damage done to a lot of good people.
---
But if that's the price, then unfortunately that's the price. You can't put a tag too high on basic human rights.
---
MFW WoW babies think they're hardcore
---
Well, that is the problem i guess.
---
Sadly, for lots of conservative Americans half of Europe is per definition "socialist". Guess what? Those "by-american-standards-socialist" states (like Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway...) are by far the most free countries in our world, ranking top ranks in pretty much any survey about personal freedom and such...
---
Some Americans really need to learn that the cold war is over. There is a huge middle ground between full-fledged capitalism and authoritarian communism... From my perspective, both these extremes are really, really bad...
---
I wish this post was higher, even on r/all.  It’s an important addition to the discussion, and the account of the anonymous employee is heartbreaking and needs to be read by more people.
---
Something needs to be done about consumers and companies (not just gaming ones) as a whole not being so damn reliant on the chinese market
---
Liberate Hong Kong

Wow now everyone can write a history book. LMAO

Chart Party made that video a while ago explaining Kaepernick’s situation from a numbers standpoint
---
Nobody cares about some unknown card game getting cyber attacks. That story would never have a chance of going international.
---
It's easy for you to say that when it's not your livelihood on the line. Losing 12% of revenue means thousands of layoffs. It's not fair to ask people who have nothing to do with the situation to just accept losing their jobs because of some greater good. 
---
It goes without saying that Blizzard has made a terrible mistake and needs to fix it. But its ignorant to demand they just give up their entire China market. People's lives depend on this.
---
i only trust /r/wallstreetbets
---
Sick of these posts.
---
Here's an idea. You keep posting your shitty little video game memes. We keep posting what matters.
---
You don't bitch, and we won't bitch.
---
Seriously, what's with the fucking defeatists. You should all be ashamed for thinking so pessimistically about humanitarian crises. God forbid your countries ever experience turmoil, you'll all just roll the fuck over.
---
Soo blizzard lost 1% of Thier money? Is that good?
---
You can't read every other word and say you read the message. It is very clearly satire. I understand if you struggle seeing it, that's fine, it requires experience. But don't be so confident in something you cannot see.
---
It's really not, though. I'm going to have to disagree with you on almost every point there.
---
Yeah, sure, California is expensive, so is my part of the country. I've even been laid off before. Layoffs generally come with severance, and unless Blizzard really wants to fuck themselves in hiring going forward, they'll do that. California has good unemployment insurance and benefits for people who get laid off. These engineers are presumably well paid and probably have a good amount of savings. 
---
There are more jobs than there are engineers, even in California. It's not intensely competitive if you know what you're doing and have good experience, and I'd wager that employees at Blizzard are near the top of their field, so I'd guess they'll be snatched up. 
---
Like I said, yeah, maybe you can't do video games anymore, or just not right away. But it's not like these people only know how to write code that makes games. There's tons of other kinds of tech companies that always need engineers. Might be hard to find the perfect job, but come on. These people can find gainful employment fairly easily, and with the benefits available to them, I doubt they take a significant hit to their savings. 
---
And AGAIN, not a single person has asked for anyone to quit or 'walk out on principle.' Please read the comment you're responding to. I said I would quit on principle, but that's mostly because I'm single and don't have many major expenses. I understand not everyone could do that. Which, again, is why I'm not asking them to. And I also hope they don't get laid off! Maybe Blizzard won't totally fuck this up and won't have to lay anyone off. That would be the best result. But if they make the choice not to try to fix this, they'll face the consequences of their actions just like anyone else. 
---
But really. Save the crocodile tears. These people will be fine.
---
XinnieThePoo works. Gotta love subjective enforcement!
---
I've never seen someone explain sarcasm before, it's really weird to see it explained in that way lol
---
You mušt be the funny guy
---
Are we forgetting that activision fires employees when they're doing better than ever? Like, literally this year? They never had job security.
---
Question because I really don't know much about the power of Unions. If a compare is laying people off instead of firing, is there anything a Union can actually do?
---
There have been historical examples of where breaking the law for the higher moral cause is the correct thing to do. Slavery, civil rights, women's suffrage, for example. Wearing a Winnie the Pooh costume to a gaming expo is the last place you should be concerned about "following the law" given what our ancestors have done by comparison for the moral cause.
---
&gt;therefore we're cutting ties with Activision
---
how exactly would they "cut ties" with Activision?  They merged, my understanding is that their no longer "Activision" and "Blizzard", but one entity known as "Activision-Blizzard".
---
Even if my understanding is wrong on that, I doubt they're allowed to just "cut ties".  
---
On a side note, I think the Blitzchung punishment was obviously over the top, I don't think anyone can really defend him losing his previously earned winnings, that's ludicrous to me.  The casters though, you have to recognize that they were at their JOB, and they encouraged/allowed this shitstorm to start.  They told a guy in a gas mask to "go ahead and say" a statement they knew was going to be pro-HK.  
---
You can't let that shit happen as an employee.  Release the winnings, reduce the suspension for Blitzchung, but the casters fucked up big time.  No matter *what* happens now, those casters are directly involved in intentionally letting an act happen that will probably cost Blizzard millions of dollars.  That's just not something you can do as an employee &amp; keep your job.
---
You're missing the sarcasm thing.
---
whoa, found the guy who was brainwashed by fox news...
---
You guys really need to re-think what is "anti-american" and "traitorous", your definitions are way, way off. Like i said before, lots of (mostly conservative) Americans never realized that the cold war is over... which is sad.
---
Whenever you bring up children in Africa you are already lost

If it was truly satire then he would have quit the game.

The karma train will run its course and the slacktivism will move on to something else in a few weeks.

The bottom part is confirmation I sent a GDPR mail to DPO@Blizzard.com
---
The content is heavily filled with personal information, so not gonna share that.
---
I think everyone agrees with you on that.
---
You alway have to play him when you have mana that can you a board clear...Obviously i cant see what his choices were
---
BUT
---
For Him to give Brawl and it leave the one 1 minion that basically cancelled out the brawl....not a very "lucky" card was it?
---
Honestly though if they’re in development or something it’s not that hard to get a new job. Company might not be as famous but tech jobs are really plentiful in California.
---
And before it had some sort of counters with hunter and maybe quest druid, now with the evolve plus the 5 3 mana drops this deck is just too retarded
---
I'm hoping it's a case of the meta still developing, but at the moment it does look like Shaman is trending towards being tier-0. It's only bad matchup is Control Warrior, which is thankfully now unplayable. 
---
People usually say that its performance will drop as people start teching for it, but how do you tech for three four drops and an eight drop being played on turn four?
---
Well RPG in which you still suck after 100 hours and die to every other pack of mobs? That I call hardcore. What are some of the games you consider hardcore?
---
In all seriousness, remove the turd and keep the pastel background, make it more festive, and you got a solid Darkmoon Faire card back
---
That's obviously not what I mean and not even in the spirit of the rest of my post, so please use some reading comprehension and don't twist my words. I was alluding to the clear growing internal rift in the company, this insider opinion is demonstrative of the fact that corporate is in full damage control and losing. Obviously people fearing for their jobs and potentially their personal safety is never a good thing.
---
I know what you're trying to do is commendable, and I respect that, but this design is kind of shitty.
---
Does it help? I was trying to be helpful. People tend to forget to put themselves in each other's shoes and misunderstandings happen because of it where two people on the same side are arguing with each other.
---
yea.. reach. 
---
On a side note, there is a lot of usefulness with regards ro plastic straws. In hospitals and for the disabled they are necessary tools.
---
Orisa.
---
Well thats weird AF in moments like this i Guess, Thanks anyway
---
So the response to people rebelling is to stick them in camps where you "re-educate" them? Take them away from their families? Take away their culture, religion and language?
---
What about the practitioners of falun gong? They were subjected to systemic torture, false imprisonment, forced labor, organ harvesting and murdered.
---
 Are any of these things a proper response to people being upset about being paid shit money? Now look what China does is what China does. As Americans we hardly have the right to tell them what to do. I don't like to comment on their matters because of difference in culture, society and politics.
---
With that sai the shit that Chinese Government has been doing is nothing short of crimes against humanity. There's no justifying that.
---
You do understand that its just craving for attention. People use sensitive content to get that. I just disagree with the way people are showing their 'support'.
---
But I guess that the while media created all this. We learn from what we see.
---
Am I the idiot?
---
If yes then why?
---
Was she used as a symbol before the blitzchung incident?
---
I'm on your side w/Blitzchung, I don't think taking away his earnings is right at all.
---
I'm still against your position on the casters.  Maybe it was a split-second decision, but they still chose poorly from a business POV.
---
Yeah, I'm Chinese Canadian too and whenever I rant about the actions of Chinese government I always preface it by saying it's not the people I hate.  
---
I love my culture, my people, and my family, but the CCP is just pure unbridled power grabbing.  It's always been like this, and absolutely none of it is the fault of the people.  They are just completely unable to see the truth under the veneer of "social progress through infrastructure and money in the big cities."  Because that's all they can ever see.
---
Don't be quick to attack pro-China people.  The CCP is the enemy, not the people brainwashed by them.  They don't deserve to be antagonized when their views were an inevitability in the first place. 
---
End rant.
---
There's one more reason to do this, I suppose. In the said 10 to 20 years geopolitical standings might change and the ban might be lifted for 1 reason or another.   
---
It's also kinda clear that doubling down on the decision is the wrong thing to do, because this would mean immediate failings, the fires would start again leading to MORE deletions, cancels, etc.
---
I guess not buying a game who's company said China is their main country is too hard for folks. I won't throw anything at a blizzard employee but no one can force me to open my wallet at gun point; this isn't The People's Republic of China.
---
I drink plenty and have never pooped blood.
---
 i doubt that's going to be easy, you can't just doubt your ''hero'' that you've born to learn to love for the last how many years
---
The NBA game in Shanghai was sold out, full seats. Turns out your everyday Joe cares more about his hobbies than he does about supporting his government in oppressing Hong Kong.   
---
We might not hear it because people won’t be allowed to openly say it, but Chinese people will not be happy if they lose access to sports and video games because of their government, especially when most of them have never even been to Hong Kong
---
I’m pretty sure people can come up with some sort of deck that counters shaman, but I mean that deck might only counter shaman and get shit stomped by every other deck so its not even worth it making one for it.
---
I play the combo paladin and most of my wins against shaman come at a 50/50 holy wrath since i cant even draw through my deck in time cause it just fills the board every single turn even better than pure aggro, not to mention it also sometimes even outdraws me which is absurd
---
Well China can roll the tanks in next week and in 3-4 months, it’ll be a Crimea situation - no one will care.
---
everyone going should show up in mei cosplay with free hong kong signs and umbrellas. i dont see anything in the blizzcon rules that would forbid it.
---
I think I have already told you somewhere that I don't. Guess I'm morally wrong, whatever. So is pressuring people to join your crusade. Either they join of their own free will or you're not any better than what you're supposed to be fighting against.
---
 Boycott
---
equals stop spending money and time on blizzard games anymore
---
Not equal to Burning what you traded with money. You look like an idiot
---
No one ever said anything about supporting China, the issue in the post was that this is a sub about playing video games, not a political sub. There are better places activism and opinions could be directed someone doing another 'I deleted my account' post IMO. 
---
If OP had said, "hey guys, China is right and everyone should do as they say" then I would agree with calling him a shitty person. But from the post all they wanted was to talk about a game on that game's sub, which does not warrant an attack.
---
Absolutely. I have a resume which shows 7 positions in 20 years. Some will say it's too much, but that's just how the market is nowadays. My longest engagement was 5 1/2 years, my shortest 5 months. You cannot stay somewhere where you are not happy. I have left one job because the CEO claimed to be tolerant and yet had no issues letting go older employees as part of a major layoff. I have left another because the CEO made fraudulent claims on federal forms. And another one I left because there simply was nobody at the helm.
---
My longest time in between jobs was after a termination and only because I had been waiting for a promise of engagement that never came. It took them 3 weeks to tell me no. Meanwhile I drove Uber and even went on to finish in the money and at the final table of a regional poker tournament (too home something like $.... oh nevermind, Mister IRS).
---
The term you're looking for is Stockholm Syndrome. Now go play something else that doesn't try to impose Chinese rules on you.
---
Was looking forward to playing as King Anduin this weekend too. :P

---
Real easy to stay neutral when it's not your human rights on the line too.
---
And people have already stated that the issue is not that  Blitzchung got punished, but rather the **severity** of the punishment, combined with the statement that their official representative in China then posted in Weibo. Several have stated that they wouldn't had been outraged to the same extend if Blitzchung perhaps just had gotten a 2-3 month ban or something like that and the casters hadn't been fired.  
---
Adding to that was the AU college team that didn't get punished for essentially doing the same thing.   
---
Either the AU college team should had been banned too, or else Blitzchung should have his ban reverted, so his punishment matches the one the AU college team got. None.
---
All signs points toward that Blizzards actions was directed toward punishing and making a public example of Blitzchung, to discourage other players from doing the same, so that Blizzard can appease the Chinese government for financial reason.
---
Why else would Trump be infatuated with Duterte, Putin, and Kim. He’s jealous for the power of dictatorships.
---
Yes I played agro shaman 😓
---
I was talking to my brother on the phone a few days ago about this issue and told him that I was considering quitting for the foreseeable future. Me and him both started playing in 2015 and it had always been a shared interest. He's not quitting and told me that I should at least log in for the free packs for whatever event theyre having. I did. Being on the game even to open the packs felt kinda dirty and bad and I logged back off and haven't since been on.   
---
   
---
Anyway, for other people with a stupid card-game shaped hole in their life whose reading this, perhaps invest in Slay the Spire which is a dungeon-run style game. I dont own it (yet) but I watched Trump play it and it looks like a good temporary time burner replacement.
---
Even if Kaepernick was blackballed, he was done because of a public outcry. Not because of a corrupt government...
---
I give it 2 more days and it will die out. Sadly.
