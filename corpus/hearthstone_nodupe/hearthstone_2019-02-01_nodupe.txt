My opponent was playing Mecha'thun freeze mage, so from turn 2 onwards my whole board was frozen every turn. After a Hemet on 6 I knew I was going to lose anyway so I just began stacking up void anomalies to see how big I could go
---
---
---
This is correct. Pala removals are absolute garbage and Equality has been the crutch for a long time now. This latest change makes it so you absolutely have to hold on to the board pre t6 when you can Pyro+Eq which severely dents Control Pala even more.
---
Just to be clear we are talking about a childrens card game you play on your phone or tablet but ok mate I see your point also
---
Because then you need the card to do something in the same nature as the previous card. You can't just make it like "Heal your hero" because that doesn't make sense with the card.
---

---
Also it's easier to completely trash a card rather than making it to something else. Because if you make it sightly too powerful without any playtesting, then you're back to square 1.
---
_Hello hello hello hello..._
---
I either like or can tolerate most of the changes but equality? That makes me both sad and angry.
---
It’s sad because sure pyro/cons + equality is strong, sure, but it’s a two card combo (and there’s plenty of other very powerful things you can do with a two card combo) and it was THE paladin board clear. Now paladins have either twisting nether or sort-of lightbomb, but it’s a two card combo and takes twice as much deck space as either of those. What’s paladin supposed to do against aggro before turn 6? Tar creeper is rotating out so everyone’s much worse at stalling now. Do all slow/control paladins have to run doomsayer and double righteous protector now? I can only hope this means blizzard must be about to print a strong paladin board clear and this nerf is to pre-empt that.
---
It makes me angry because as many others have said, this nerf is clearly massively influenced by genn and baku. Nerfing classic cards because of the influence of temporary cards is a worrying bad balancing method.
---
An non-immunity Candleshot would maybe see play in Spell Hunter where they have limited early game options. As it stands now, it sees play in all-Hunter decks. And actually pretty much every weapon gets run in Hunter because they want to have ways to interact with the board and preserve minions. But this is going to be too in-depth for you to understand, because all you can do is go "worse than light's justice."
---
In the past 2 years control and to a part midrange paladin is the only thing I played. Got legend multiple times with it and all other times rank 5. I cant understand this and I dont believe it. I dont even play any mainstream paladin decks. Never did. Always control and midrange. No baku, no pirate or Murloc. My decklist has like 9 standard and 7 wild paladin decks. I haven't played for a month and I'm not sure if it's worth trying after this.
---
Cold Blood has been a problem for them for ages. It was what enabled Rogues to OTK in every archetype bar the Malygos one from Leeroy to a number to other charge minions
---
You're absolutely right. Tunnel visioned on the OTK decks, but Rexxar is also forcing out grindy stuff.
---
&gt; on the flip side, if say a card like Healing Rain was in Hunter's basic set, we'd rather rotate that than nerf it. Hunters shouldn't be about big healing spells.
---
this is confusing: each class's identity is dictated by their core set so if healing rain was in hunter's core set then healing would 100% be part of their personality. 
---
just look at the converse, priest which is supposed to be all about healing and yet we have a card that can literally only be used for combo burn decks in the core set
---
Wizards of the Coast (the guys who do Magic: The Gathering) running into some tough competition in the field of terrible decisions
---
make genn a 9 mana 1/1 and baku a 10 mana 1/1
---
Nice to hear that you're having such a fun time! I honestly think that the deck has the potential to be tier 1 next expansion, and right now it's still pretty good. Hooktusk is an obscenely good card. It can struggle a bit against Odd Rogue, but it performs excellently against non-secret Hunter.
---
The cold blood nerf is gonna hurt, but Hunter is gonna become even more prevalent after it, since control Paladin archetypes are gonna get nerfed super hard. One way or another, Leeroy and Southsea Captain are still classic cards that have seen LOTS of play for a long time and won't ever rotate out, so they are safe crafts. Lich King not so much since he'll be rotating with the next expansion. Gral has definitely worked for me as a tempo efficient draw, so I would consider keeping him.
---
Have fun!
---
shaman got trampling for no reason, mean while 'resurrect priest' gonna be supper toxic
---
answer. just quit hearthstone
---
&gt;
---
Priest has had this as a chronic issue from day one, and it can only be fixed by adding the missing core cards INTO the basic/classic set
---
Weirdly I just got back into the game after missing two expansions and could build the Resurrection priest easily as I got the legendary spell in my free packs and had everything else
---
So a core set, but Blizzard gets free money for reprinting boring staple cards to gum up packs.... 
---
What is it?
---
Wild is the place to gauge the power level of a card because every card or synergy in wild needs to be busted. 
---
Odd and even decks have been tier 1 in wild since their inception. 
---
Baku and Genn are the failures, there's nothing wrong with classic
---
It's been there, but it hasn't really been meta, has it?
---
It’s not losing argent squire.
---
I tried to guess what these nerfs were going to be before clicking on the link... 
---
I can't believe that neither Rexxar or Zul'jin were touched. I thought there was also a decent chance that Mind Blast was nerfed to 3 mana. All of these changes are really weird to me other than Hunter Spellstone. I didn't realize they were that oppressive. 
---
I actually played against you as well. 
---
Given that between the release of Naxx up until roughly the Witchwood, aggressive decks have consistently been **the** force forming almost every single format, it make sense that Team 5 would probably like to see the game head into a different direction, and try to create more balanced formats generally that are made up of more than aggressive decks and the decks that seek to counter those aggressive decks.
---
There's a Dragon Shaman variant with Zihi&amp;Shudderwock that can at least hold it's own against Combo decks.
---
Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
---
Maybe their effect can include a downside? Max health is set to 25? Lose a mana crystal or health when the card is drawn? Three random cards in the deck cost +3 mana?
---
No probs, just trying to help! And there’s the semi cheap odd rogue without some of the legendaries but I don’t know if people still run that. If you look on hearthpwn or similar sites you’ll be able to look at a giant list of decks people have built and if you just put the keyword “budget” in the filter a bunch of decks will come up and you can pick any of your fancy, their not really meta decks but can help you climb as a new player. There are the rare budget decks that will let you climb to high ranks posted there.
---
Yuuuup. Some staple cards I honestly think are fine to have around forever if they arent oppresive. Control/midrange paladin hasnt been tier 1 since before the first standard rotation , I'd doubt anyone would argue its an overpowered archtype.
---
Well, now we are guaranteed to never see a control paladin in the top of the meta, unless Blizzard FORCES it to happen by printing UI, Spreading Plague, Drakonid Operator and Dragonfire Potion level bullshit. In which case I have little belief blizzard would be able to do without making it a Shaman Tier in Karazhan.
---
RIP midrange and control paladin, the next time we see you, Itll be 2021 at the earliest.
---
But hey, at least we have Genn and Baku so we can use our hero power and maybe even a couple of cards in your deck to win 56% of your games. Fuck Genn and Baku. 
---
&gt; Wow. It’s been a while since I last saw someone fail this utterly to understand.
---
&gt; The base definition for auto include, in a card game, is a card so fundamentally and widely good that it goes in all archetypes be it aggro, tempo, combo, control, even though it doesn’t have any special synergies. 
---
And with this I can stop reading further.
---
The lack of understanding is on your end, not mine. I already addressed this in great detail. This definition is so limited as to be unhelpful. Useless.
---
Do you know how many "strictly" Auto-Include cards there are in the game? Let alone in Classic and Basic? I'd guess less than 15. So you go ahead and make a comprehensive list of cards you deem to be "Auto Include" and I'll *happily* apply your psychotically narrow definition to show you just how useless it is.
---
Until then, see ya jackass.
---
Woooow, they didn't even kill equality, they Thanos snapped out our of existence
---
Baku and genn are also, like, must-craft legendaries, and they make free to play MUCH harder. I think when we have a discussion about Baku and Genn, or of the Classic set, we do need to consider the economic aspect of these cards and how they shape free to play, and the economy of the game in general.
---
dusted all my cards and made golden nat pagle and milhouse, keep nerfing what used to be the only good purchase in this game, and the only thing that would keep their classes feeling like actual wow classes 
---
This, it's a straight buff to the card.

Baku and Genn are cancer
---
Come to think of it, "mend pet" is an ability in WoW. Healing minions/beasts would fit quite well
---
I was afraid they'd nerf dopple like they did with chain.
---
My stomach dropped when I saw "balance changes".
---
If you have a bunch of tokens while your opponent has a bunch of high statted minions you don’t have the board, but can take it and dictate trades with equality. 
---
You have to be being obstinate on purpose at this point, I’m gonna stop replying. This is blindingly obvious. 
---
True dat!!
---
I love how he seemlessly combines OTK and genn/baku as if they're somehow the same problem.
---
Genn/Baku provide immediate bonuses with very little downside that vastly warp the tempo and playstyle of the game. OTK decks on the other hand are for the most part sub 50% WR and only a bother on ladder if you're playing a boring greedy control deck.
---
Absolutely identical.
---
OTK paladin is borderline playable. Name one other OTK deck that's &gt; 50% WR. Hakkar druid? Sub-50% WR. Exodia mage in any variety? Well, well below 50% WR. Any Mecha'thun deck? Well, well, well, well below 50% WR. Anything else? If you lose it's your fault for playing a deck whose win condition is your opponent's concede button.
---
Genn/Baku are a problem because *from turn 1* they fundamentally and radically shift priorities and playstyle to the point where *most decks* are made fundamentally worse by your opponent playing with a card they hope to *never draw*. On the other hand, OTK decks are absolutely hard countered by all but greedy control decks but because Kibler's favorite playstyle is slow decks, he finds himself on the losing end of OTK.
---
OTK is a necessity to balance the god fucking awful boring control 40 minute match meta that would otherwise arise without it. Without OTK decks there is literally 0 reason to ever not play control. You're favored to both aggro and midrange and a 50/50 to other control. I for one do not want to have every game be half a fucking hour long.
---
But, hey, Genn/Baku and OTK are the same fucking thing, amirite?
---
There is a way to nerf them. For example make it so that you only get the upgraded hero power when you draw them, and show it to the opponent as well.
---
Yeah....let’s bring wild cards back to standard after 75% of the player base began dusting all wild cards right after that game mode came out. Could you imagine the backlash? Terrible idea. 
---
That card needs reset and HoF
---
Fair enough. I also liked what /u/SoupAndSalad911 posted.
---
In part I responded as I did in the original string because of how I saw you were responding to the original OP, including downvoting his disagreeing statements (rather than leaving that to the court of public option) and generally seeming very combative.
---
That said, my behavior wasn’t called for, and I apologize for that. 
---
I love control priest so much 
---
I recently came back into HS in September and first thing I did was save dust for Baku because Odd Rogue is budget as hell. It's still enjoyable but I can imagine how irritating it must be seeing the same Odd Warrior/Paladin/Rogue decks for those playing since Genn&amp;Baku were released.   
---
The reason I left HS in the first place was after Malchezaar was released and as someone without Malchezaar it was pretty much an auto concede as soon as that game started. It was just frustrating and dull and I didn't want to be forced into having to have that card in order to have fun.    
---
There's a definite drop off in interest from the majority of popular HS streamers, these nerfs aren't going to alter that.
---
There are a lotta cards that have been nerfed more recently that *haven't* become entirely unplayable. Innervate, Ironbeak Owl, Fiery War Axe, Spreading Plague (yikes), Hex, Wild Growth, Nourish, Corridor Creeper, Possessed Lackey, Dark Pact, The Caverns Below (what a tenacious one that is), and Call to Arms.
---
Others got pretty much neutered, and I think the Flametongue Totem and Cold Blood nerfs are overkill. The other three though? I think they're spot on.
---
Do you like to play with... MAIEEEV?
---
not when you're dead on turn 5 it's not :(
---
I don’t think you’re reading my posts either, so fine by me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

---
sorry, you have pro players bitching about how shit the game is right now, but -IM- demanding the game be tailored for me?  fuck off.
---
Elegant? Not really. Most effective? Definitely. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In all seriousness the effect itself is a mistake. Hearthstone at a fundamental level is balanced around each classes hero power. When you have something that so enormously buffs it with very little downside its honestly just shit design. Those two cards are going to warp wild until they inevitably fuck up again and make something even more degenerate and format warping. 
---
Because I'm really good at this game with minimal effort and when there's a decent meta it's fun.
---
No it's not. The fact that Pyro-Equality is strong means that Paladin doesn't have to worry about value or tempo and can OHKO or generate infinite value off of cards like N'Zoth, it's mediocre without. 
---
Not particularly different uses. Duskbreaker is anti-aggro and ok for tempo, Scream and Hysteria are mainly combo cards and ok for control. 
---
You could play many types of Druid in non-tournament settings, most people just didn't because they were bad/lazy.
---
No one forced them to dust anything, i never dust cards becuase i do sometiems play wild, and like to try things out.
---
I’m literally shaking right now !
---
Just quit lol games not worth playing anymore
---
Auto-include would just be a card that is too powerful to not include, lest you want to be at a disadvantage. 
---
Think of it this way: your car engine requires gas (core cards) but your 3 cylinder engine isn’t going to keep up with a V6 (auto-includes).
---
They both use gas, but the v6 has more effective parts to use that gas.
---
Will the base sets ever be rotated or will we just keep nerfing them because *gasp* people are playing them?
---
I don’t think the game will ever truly feel fresh until the cards we’ve been playing with for years and years are out of standard. 
---
So people that don’t play for a while can come back and still have cards that they can use. 
---
If that is real I am very confused. Like since when is hunter's freaking mark an issue??? Why is cold blood even an issue compared to the other 1 mana spells? Why in the world is flametongue totem getting nerfed? Is blizzard high?
---
I agree with the spellstone nerf. At minimum you were getting 6/6 for 5 mana which is already good. What other card gives you a 12/12 for 5 mana?
---
The other nerfs? I don’t know. I guess cold blood makes miracle harder if that is going to be a thing again.  
---
I feel like I disagree with flametounge. But 3 mana isn’t terrible. 
---
4 mana equality? That is crazy but at the same time I think people are going to play it. 
---
Don't remind me of the days of Midrange Shaman... Turn 1 Trogg, Turn 2 Totem Golem, Turn 3 Flametongue, Turn 4 Thing From Below and *Concede\*. 
---
Damn, your battery isnt dying!!!
---
When saying it was toxic, I wasn’t saying that every last member of the community is toxic. That’d be ridiculous. I understand I didn’t expand on that context, but suggesting that I would be pro-censorship of criticism in the sub is a massive leap from feeling that we treat genuine attempts at answering our questions as a positive thing. 
---
Not every act the devs take can be attributed to malice, in fact I’d argue that none of them are. To insist that I’m trying to control people by pointing out how negative the reaction to a well-intentioned post is unfair and totally not the point I’m making. 
---
Druid and priest DKs are just good, not broken.
---
Shaman DK is unreliable and has one of the weakest hero powers. 
---
Rogue DK is only really good in wild. 
---
Paladin DK only recently started seeing any significant play since kotft and exodia pally is still just a tier 3 deck. 
---
I almost forgot to list the warrior DK entirely because it's so underwhelming. 
---
Mage, warlock, and hunter are the only broken DKs, and I say this as someone who loves Deathstalker Rexxar. 
---
Opinions on the specific nerfs and game aside, I am delighted that this expansion they've begun to set the precedent of more frequent and rapid balance changes. 
---
Wow. Now this is too much. Been playing since closed beta and spent prob 1k+, but there continuing butchering of classic cards makes me finally feel like giving up the game...ugh. Sad. 
---
Wow, just nerf all aggro decks so i can enjoy watching my opponents draw their whole deck and kill me without ever doing anything. very fun blizzard!
---
In your post all you did was complain about your experiences and didn’t mention any pro players complaining? Just change the way you play the game? The meta is always changing and if you don’t enjoy it at the moment either change the way you play the game or wait till the next expansion or nerfs
---
Were the basic cards a problem at higher ranks? The only that had me going "fuck that card" cold blood. I usually play up till rank 15. 
---
I think OTK pally is still gonna be all right.
---
That's one matchup lol. I've definitely seen Odd Rogue without ever drawing cold blood.
---
starts in your starting hand, can't be mulliganed, and is like a 9 mana 4/4 or 6 mana 2/2 or some shit awful.
---
Other than a mild satisfaction which is a mere sliver of the frustration you've experienced up to that point? Nope.
---
If APM priest is played right, it is unstopable 
---
Yeah strongly disagree. I came back and looked into what decks were good, all I saw were decks with legendaries DKs etc. Crafting Baku though meant I could have a bunch of commons and rares and climb ladder to 15 or so comfortably. After that saved dust and crafted some Vilespines instead of using assassinates. Baku as filthy a card as it is, is a massive F2P help
---
To be fair for spell stone, traps were looking to be borderline unplayable when cloaked huntress went out as it came in.
---
Then blizz just kept shitting out more trap support. 
---
&gt; The same really applies to cold blood; odd rogue is losing dire mole soon. 
---
We don't know what Rogue is getting in the next expansion.  Blizzard does.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah. Ur what happens when that rotates out?
---
Artorias#11507 NA. Will show, you go first. Looking to play some friendly games, not just concedes. Meme decks a plus
---
Just play secret odd mage and farm Combo/OTK decks. Only aggro deck that’s not getting hit by the nerfs, if anything, it will see an increase in play with other aggro decks being nerfed. 
---
For this tavern brawl I just took every direct damage and charge minion I could along with cheap removal since it is almost impossible to taunt.
---
The FUCKING EQUALITY NERF MAN I CANT CATCH A BREAK
---
Probably cause it's cheap to just Nerf card that doesn't give dust/ or much dust instead of legendaries/epic. 
---
one of the worst patches ever. LOOKS LIKE BLIZZARD STILL SUCKS AT BALANCE!
---
seriously though, nothing new to see here. blizz has been shit at balance for years and years in multiple games. blah blah blah, hearthstone core set continues to go down the fucking drain along with this company.
---
The only good Commie is a dead Commie. 
---
Please, just retire the whole classic set in a single time. Can't endure such pain continually.
---
So you are salty that you werent able to hit rank 5 or legend? Then you come here to cry about it because you think its the games fault? 
---
Let me burst your bubble ... not being able to reach a certain rank isnt the games fault. Its yours. Let that sink in for a second.
---
Now you will say: "but i only lose because of others playing aggro!" Unfortunately thats not even remotely true. There are ten-thousands of players that reach legend every season and probably hundred-thousands of players reaching rank 5 every season and no ... not every single one of them plays aggro or combo.
---
If theres no way to change them, I would simply remove them from the game period. They are that toxic and boring.
---
That being said, they could start in your hand (while increasing Genn's cost if needed) or they could provide a limit to the times you can use the upgraded hero power. Sadly, Blizzard won't really do much outside changing mana costs.
---
Ok, its honestly just odd paladin.
---
In what world are odd decks creative deck building? All the build arounds we have ever had (reno, cthun, jade, etc) have been easily the most brain dead decks to build. Here is your flowchart for making a baku deck.
---
1. Pick a class with a not shit hero power
---
2. filter by odd
---
3. select cards that aren't shit and synergize with hero power
---
4. fill the rest of the deck with the other odd cards that are of high power level
---
Thats it. Its the same thing with reno, cthun, jades, etc. On top of boring deck building baku and genn are objectively bad design in terms of warping formats. They are two of the most objective mistakes the game has ever seen. 
---
OG Freeze Mage seems positively quaint when you're taking 40+ from a Clone Priest in one turn.
---
Hall of Fame wouldn't even make sense since they'll rotate eventually. For the sake of all game modes, something needs to be done about them
---
Remember when Trump made legend with a free deck? Yeah fuck those people, buy more packs.
---
N
---
What’s the point of classic set? Might as well get rid of the whole set if the plan is to make the entire set complete garbage. People pay money for classic cards, so it should be treated as equal to other sets, but clearly T5 views Classic no differently than they do Basic cards: intended to be flavorful but shitty. 
---
I hate these posts
---
happy cake day :)
---
That isn't why I left, I left because of the price of having a decent collection. And these changes are nerfing that collection...again. 
---
That said, of course there are going to be powerful cards in Hearthstone; but there doesn't need to be overpowered cards. I'm not sure of the point you are trying to make there. 
---
Blizzard loves big priest so it won't be nerfed
---
As someone who still plays wild a bit, hall of fame won't be good enough for me
---
Thanks :) 
---
For Blizzard card changes = nerfs.
---
Have they ever buffed cards since after the beta?
---
I can only think of Bane of Doom summoning from the pool of all demons and adding the beast tag of Silithid Swarmer that they forgot.
---
Kibler always hates on OTK decks because in Hearthstone when the OTK decks draws near perfect answers, you feel like you had absolutely no say in the outcome of the game. 
---
I understand that, but I myself hate the midrange/aggro metagame because they all feel so boring to me. Play some minions, trade favorably into one another, win the the board win the game. 
---
I wouldn't consider it a good thing at all if odd priest or whatever else became meta. You'll just see the card even more if every class has a viable even/odd deck. I cant think of a single instance where a neutral legendary being viable in every deck was fun (eg: patches, keleseth)
---
And Candleshot rotates in 2 months!
---
I'm not really all that angry at these nerfs (other than Equality) like the last set of nerfs, but nerfing over Hall of Faming makes no sense to me. Rotation is in two months. The meta currently isn't great but is fine. Just wait for rotation.
---
Except Spellstone. Spellstone should've been nerfed a year ago.
---

Was it the only card that was nerfed twice since beta?

---
Well? How’d you do!
---
I was thinking a mid rangey kind of deck, with the hero power consistently applying pressure on your opponent while you smack down high value card after high value card. Then DK rexxar and zuljin(which i also notice is even) will win you the gamr by providing insane value in the late game. Oh yeah, Flanking strike is also even, so there that too.
---
To be fair they have themselves confirmed that they have nerfed things for reasons other than balance. The oldest example is nerfing mind control to 10 mana because, and I quote, "The cost was balanced, but we felt that it felt too bad to play against so we increased the cost from 8 to 10 mana".
---
And for an example where they behaved dishonestly for profit, they didn't give players dust refunds for Mekgineer Thermaplug when they nerfed leper gnome from a 2/1 to a 1/1, even though that was a very direct nerf to the card itself.
---
Put those point together and distrust, while unfortunate, isn't unreasonable.
---
For Wild's sake, yes, absolutely, this will hopefully be great for the meta. I only wish Shaman had some other deck to turn to in Standard, but with Shudderwock dead and Even's demise looming, it just looks bad.
---
shit meme
---
..5-3. 5 times out of 8 I had keleseth on turns 1 or 2!
---
Whatever they said about Leeroy at the time of the nerf doesn't matter after 4+ years of development. They can change their minds over time. But these statements conflict right now.
---
I've been running Wild Even Reno N'Zoth Hunter ever since Genn came out and honestly it's been pretty legit  
---
Umbra, Shaw, Rexxar, Reno, Cairne, Sylvanas, Sneed's, and N'Zoth are all even. Plus you have Mad Scientist and Glaivezooka to help with the early game. The damage adds up. These two cards will help me out a lot.
---
In the movie the Dodgeball trainer Patches wore a scarf like Zul'jin and had a similar phrase!
---
Why would he lie about why they nerfed the card when there's no nefarious reason behind it? Even if they nerfed it because of Odd Paladin, why would they like about it? These conspiracy theories are fucking ridiculous.
---
To me, the worst feeling in HS is when the match starts and I pretty much already know the outcome by turn 1 or 2. It's been a really long time since I had a close game where I felt like my gameplay decisions mattered more than the deck archetype I was playing at the time.
---
&gt; When you go to build a paladin deck you do automatically put in 2 pyros and 2 equalities and then go from there (unless it's odd). And that has been true forever.
---
Lets rewrite that part, but this time with how it is in reality:
---
&gt;When you go to build a  *control* paladin deck you do automatically put in *the only way of clearing a big board that the class has an is necessary for a control deck to exist* and then go from there (unless it's odd).
---
Now it's suddenly a lot less auto-include and a lot less an issue of Equality.
---
You're either trying to just survive to turn 10 or kill your opponent by turn 10. There is no in between any more
---
Yeah, but was it really being run in so many decks that it required a nerf? Don't remember seeing it in any recent deck lists. Of all the cards getting changed, it jumped out at me as being strange.
---
Sure it's fun to have interesting deck building challenges. I loved making dumb Reno decks and the few tavern brawls that limit the playable cards are super cool. 
---
It makes for interesting decks and using cards that don't normally get played.
---
However, the meta decks right now are so dominant, that cards that were never problematic before are getting nerfed, just so they don't have to figure out what to do about Baku. 
---
Odd Paladin and Odd Rogue are so problematic in standard that the classed as a whole have taken huge hits, and I'm not happy about that.
---
Hi guys!!
---
With the new balance update in mind, what would be a good deck to craft which will last me through the 2019 expansions as well?
---
Thanks!!!
---
(knights of the frozen throne, journey of the ungoro, kobolds and katacombs rotating out, bif oof :() 
---
Every proposal I've seen is either way too little or way too much. The only thing I think would work is allowing the player a set number of upgraded/discounted hero powers per game and even that might not be enough.
---
Oh I misread
---
No he means you start with the effect but you basically have a dead card in your opening hand.
---
Still too goddamn soon ಥ╭╮ಥ
---
Doesn't help that I just rewatched GoT either.
---
Succubus next best thing
---
For the value, I'd say it's worth. A guaranteed legendary is also super nice, got Deathwing out of mine and I can't explain how many times it's helped me out of sticky situations
---
That would delete the cards.  My version leaves the cards in play but costs players a turn (to trigger the battlecry) as well as denying them activations before turn 4.
---
Yeah they need to make them all not playable in the same deck
---
Well this way the new cards power level is closer to the the 'drawn winrate'.
---
wtf. Or you could just..you know, collect everything and never have to dust anything. 
---
So you basically want them to be removed, nerfed or changed to have another cancer cards!! Hm! ok...
---
Reno's condition made decks *less* consistent though. Having 30 different cards kind of makes every game different so it's less boring to play against. Baku/Genn on the other hand, create more consistency than anything we've seen before, and that's why it sucks. 
---
There's around 10^50 atoms in the universe iirc. You have better chances to pick a random atom in the universe and have someone else pick the same one.
---
FTP doesn't mean you play a game that's free to play, it means you spent no money on it. I've been ACTUALLY FTP for that time and I'm still a long ways away from creating the deck i want. I need something like 5 more rare wildcards. They are as stingy as hearthstone from my experience. 
---
A lot of meta decks do indeed use classic cards. The welcome bundle has the best value Vs other bundles by far, 10 packs plus one garunteed legendary dragon (3 of the 5 are very good). It is worth it no matter how long you've played HS
---
Vanilla stats are underpowered though, so if this is the legendary you build your deck around I'd be find with an extra point.  They might still be too weak.  Stuff like Evil Heckler never saw play and it was better than a straight 5/4.

Skeleton Knight is a big ole GoT reference as well.

---
OTK would be my agreed-upon gripe, but Baku I don't have a problem with.
---
The thing that facilitates OTK decks more than anything else, is too plentiful card draw(something pointed out by Brian Kibler even back in the days when Patron Warrior was oppressing the tournament scene). Notice how much worse that deck was, when you didn't get Battle Rage and other draws when you needed them.
---
Today - OTK decks and all the other "solitaire" decks slot Novice Engineers or double Loot Hoarders. When decks such as OTK pally have cards such as Crystalogy, Call to Arms, double hoarders, Potion of Heroism and Flash of light to constantly draw and keep themselves safe...it is inevitable that they assemble all the pieces they need.
---
OTK needs lots and lots of draw. Take away or nerf the neutral draw engines and you'll see an enormous difference in how quickly they assemble everything. It's *because* they draw so well, that makes the combos of equality + consecrate and equality + pyromancer all the more glaring.
---
They’d be beating Druid down more than that dead horse meme I used
---
You got some manner of list for secret odd mage?
---
I brought up GvG because the powerceeep of that set was INSANE compared to the cardpool before. GvG permeated the meta of the time HEAVILY, basically the exact opposite of Boomsday. Not because its still so powerful, but because it changed how the game felt at the time. Games got significantly faster, end game cards finally saw push, etc. Because of the power creep compared to the cards available before. 
---
LOL, ActivBlizz...
---
I've quit this expansion. Looks like I've to quit HS all together.
---
They're saying that a hypothetical even spell hunter would want to run to my side. Whether they want to run genn is a different matter, especially for the reasons you stated. 
---
Make it say “passive” instead of “start of game” so players that run Baku or Genn effectively get one less card in their deck that they can play. Like how the passive treasures work in kobolds and catacombs single player runs. 
---
They just need to add counter play that punishes decks that use their hero power every turn.
---
Legendary: The Mathmagician, 7 mana 4/4 taunt: deal 2 damage to each enemy, repeat this battlecry for each hero power used by your opponent.
---
I don't even know if this card is viable or good, but if you add something like this to the game, it completely removes the polarization because you have some kind of counter play.
---
It's not necessary, but some meta reports says it's viable. So it's your personal choice which is not affect you winrate. I took my build [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/af3rsf/standard_rank_11_legend_odd_paladin/), I do run exact same list, so no Liam, no witch cauldron.

---
It's impressively advanced, not broken
---
Yeah, I think if aggro hunter could make an even deck it would be very effective, but hunter just doesn't have the right cards for it.
---
People love nerfing in theory and hate nerfing in practice. Whatever the nerf would be, it would be met with disdain and frustration. I don’t mean that in an anti-circlejerk, “Reddit is stupid “ kind of way - it’s just a factual dynamic.
---
The thing about nerfs is that they’re just so conceptually simple. It’s like a cooking an egg. People like eggs, but everybody likes their egg prepared a different way. Scrambled, sunny side up, boiled - there’s three dozen ways to cook an egg. There’s no single way to cook an egg that will make everybody happy. Or even a majority of people happy. But if people are really hungry, then you just cook the eggs the best way you know how and serve them.
---
I think there needs to be a quest-like drawback to these cards.  Something like "starts the game in your opening hand" and you can't mulligan it.  Give them SOME sort of drawbacks instead of nerfing everything into the ground.
---
Yeah there’s so many rng, for someone it’s nothing but for some people like me, it effect the way i look at the game. I don’t mind grinding for cards but for card drawing, it kills me. This game is good. The art, gameplay, music, soundtrack, i really want to keep playing but it’s just kicking me out so i’ve decided to stop. Honestly, i don’t know a card game, only hearthstone (clash royale is a card game? If it is then i know two). I’ve played elder scrolls but i don’t know it has a card game. Is it on steam? I’m gonna try it because now i don’t have anything to play. Thanks!

---
It definitely the more established and agreed method. 
---
My view of the blizzard way is they always try something different and iterate until they eventually get to a place the community is happier. Sometimes this leads to the same place the community has been screaming for years and sometimes this leads to groundbreaking ideas that revolutionise the gaming community. 
---
In this instance I have a lot of faith they will keep making changes until they see a need  to move to something like full rotation or give us a new format. 
---
We have to remember mtg is 20 years old and hearthstone is 5ish. Once we hit 7 or 8 then we have a lot of sets to play with. 
---
Other than the fact that OTK decks have existed every single freaking expansion, you are right.
---
Collect the dust
---
&gt; A board of legendaries shouldn't be able to be taken out by 4 mana
---
this. People cant see that equality has taken 6 spots in any paladin deck that want to stay beyond turn 8 to do some wacky thing for wayyy too long. Just look at priest, Yeah they ll have to print board clear for them every year, but I ll be more happy playing those new cards than the old auchenai+circle combo bullshit. 
---
may as well just reprint Justicar Trueheart at that point.
---
The reality is that the most broken thing you can do in hearthstone is mess with the hero power, since the game is balanced on them.  
---
Rotating core set could be similar to the way core sets in Magic used to be. No new cards. Just re-releases of existing cards from past sets. That way people could just hold onto their cards and maybe eventually they'd be reprinted.
---
Reno was awesome. I think the trick was to consider Reno as *an* out and not as *the* out. 
---
Thanks! Yeah, it mostly helped me with secrets. 
---
Even if they don’t get added to the classic set, they will dominate Wild forever.
---
You should craft Baku
---
Wild even shaman is also busted because it runs a full jade package AND a 2 mana 3/4(overload 1) AND a 4 mana 7/7(overload 2).
---
Which is insane single card value
---
okay i can see that
---
&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong,
---
HS replay has your win% against Deathrattle hunter at 24.8% over 3600 games. Maybe you are \*really\* good.
---
It should be a 1/3 dagger. A 2/1 dagger is not even better than a 1/2 dagger. 
---
Paladin one seems really confusing, summoning a 2/1 or a 2/2 instead makes it a lot more eloquent.

There you go, give it a shot.
---
Make midrange great again! 
---
&gt; I'm really not sure how you can say this with a straight face. Are you claiming Jade Druid was more interactive than Hunter?
---
Wait, hold on a second let me reread my post. I don't *think* I said JD was more interactive than hunter, but maybe my memory is hazy. Hold on a second I'm rereading it. Okay let me reread it one more time I want to make sure .. nope, that's what I thought. I in fact did not say Jade Druid was more interactive than Hunter. I did not say that at all, but I certainly appreciate you putting words in my mouth.
---
What I *did* say is that people *complain* that certain decks are uninteractive (and if you read carefully, you'd see I was referencing people saying decks like JD were uninteractive) when in fact what they ***really*** meant is they want to be able to interact with their opponent's win condition but don't want their opponents to be able to interact with theirs. Jade Druid was a jack of all trades, master of none. It couldn't snowball faster than aggro, it couldn't control better than a control deck, it couldn't outtempo a tempo deck. It just did all of those fairly well at the same time. The result is the control player was able to control the druid for the first 8 turns but then lost long term when it couldn't control anymore; thus JD is uninteractive because the control player couldn't maintain control forever. The aggro player could outdamage the druid for the first 8 turns but then lost long term when it couldn't keep up the pressure anymore; thus JD is uninteractive because it could defend and control too well.
---
Jade Druid is the tortoise that won the race and most people just want to play the hare and bitch and whine when they don't win the race.
---
As a post-script, you linked a vs report from fucking 2017. We didn't even have the fucking Ungoro rotation and the class has had no less than 5 cards nerfed since. Even if you want to make a case that it was too strong then, it most absofuckinglutely is not now. And unless you want to say that HM or Spellstone is going to be the deathknell of the class, it isn't going to see any abatement pre-rotation. The 2 strongest varieties (mid-range and deathrattle) don't really even care that much about Spellstone and aren't particularly broken up about HM either.
---
And lastly, as a post-post-script, my entire response was about how you said, and I will once again quote, verfuckingbatim, "when one class is dominating the meta." Can you, hold on let me quote you again, "how you can say this with a straight face", not say hunter is dominating the meta? If you say no, you're lying or delusional. If you say yes, then that's all I was trying to point out: your original assertion is purely and utterly false.

nerf their stats and make them "**start of game**: draw this card"
---
One bad draw early game draw should be enough to slow them down a bit.
---
Dust it bro, not worth to someone who just wants dust
---
Wow I didnt know this combo o.o
---
The thing killer has been advocating for isn’t a rotating core set, but rather an ACTUAL core set. The expert and base level sets of hearthstone cards were never designed to be the backbone of the game, but were shoehorned into the position years later. Rather than constantly remove and nerf cards from the set, design a set from the ground up that you are comfortable being in most standard environments. If cards like leeroy are problematic every other set, simply don’t include him in the core set. Likewise, you can remove many high impact cards that some classes have access to, and adjust accordingly. Aoe would be much more interesting if warlocks didn’t always have twisting nether, mages having flamestrike, etc. it opens up much more design space, and would still be completely F2P accessible
---
Mostly my own deck but some is mind blast priest, odd warrior and spell hunter. I have a full deck, not missing anything. I have done that. My friend play this game since the start so we sat together for whole day try to figuring out why i’m so bad at this. His answer is “bad luck man” because even if he sit right there watching me, i’m still losing most of the time. Maybe not 2:20 win:lose but more like 5:20. Still, i can’t have anyone sitting and helping me out every game right? I still want to play this game by my own. Thanks for your suggestion but trust me i have tried everything.
---
I think a 3/1 would end up being stronger with that extra attack to take out 4 drops. The decks would just need a few changed cards to make that work.

Guess we'll have do deal with Mechathun until it's rotation. Good find, op

Pity timer indeed exists and is functioning as they originally stated.  Epic every 10 packs.  legendary every 40 packs. etc.
---
I'm glad that they're doing changes more often but dang that Equality nerf hurts.
---
I'd largely be fine with it as long as those hero powers were made specific to Baku and didn't affect either Justicar Trueheart or the other sources of Upgraded basic hero powers.
---
Granted, a 1/3 or 1/4 weapon would be a clear upgrade over the basic Rogue hero power while stepping the intensity of the 2/2 weapon down reasonably.
---
^^^(Incidentally, Jade Druid hasn’t been in standard for about a year)
---
you think it's better than nerfing all of them to oblivion eventually?
---
&gt; And consistency is the whole purpose of their designs from the very beginning admitted by Team 5 themselves when Genn and Bakue were first revealed .. Granted, the pendulum did probably swing too far in the other direction with at least Baku
---
That's kind of the point. While Reno is a horrendously designed card (who would have guessed a 6 mana 4/6 that healed for 30 was badly designed?), it was as you say entirely dependent upon whether it was drawn. Draw it? Win. Don't? Lose.
---
But Genn and to a much greater extent Baku is not just the other end of the pendulum, it swung 10 times further. It's too consistent. A 2 mana 1/2 dagger is powerful but very rarely game-breaking. A 2 mana 2/2 dagger is however far more than twice as strong, especially when rogue gives up very little for it. Eviscerate, maybe Prep, maaaaaybe Sap, and an extremely limited selection of other even cards. It's too consistent. For odd rogue to lose a match it's favored to win it has to get an incredibly unlucky draw. And matches where it's favored, having double the power from its dagger giving it a hunter hero power at effectively half the cost can win some slower games, too.
---
The main reason why they're so powerful can be seen in the cases where they *aren't* powerful. Odd/even druid decks, even priest, odd shaman, even warrior, and every other permutation that doesn't work. The trade off of losing half of the available cards isn't offset by the hero power. The cases where it DOES work shows that for the few classes that can really take advantage of it do so because the majority of their strong cards (class or neutral) all have the same parity, which means they give up very little to gain a lot.
---
As a wild player, it's truly absurd to think that Flamereath Faceless would literally be *nerfed* if its mana cost were lowered by 1. Same with Cold Blood, Mountain Giant, Sea Giant, and many of the other odd/even staples.
---
&gt; Lastly, why go so extreme with your example at the end there?
---
To prove a point as how powerful a permanent effect can be. Baku would see exactly the same amount of play if she were a 0/0 minion. You don't actually ever play her. Southsea Deckhand is very powerful but if it provided a permanent effect to the game it would be absolutely broken. You could even have far less impressive effects and it would still be overpowered. If Stormwind Champion was a 99 mana 0/0 minion with "**Start of Game:** The first minion you play each turn gains +1/+1" it would be in literally every single aggro deck ever. Even if it was just "gains +1 health." That's a really minor effect most of the time but you would still play it for the permanent compounding boost every single turn. Ever time you untap as Baku you gain a little bit of an advantage over a non even/odd deck.
---
That worked out great for artifact 
---
Tracking is an AMAZING cards. People are very set in the mindset that you must always pick X cards, when instead you should simply pick the best one based on your strategy for the game. 90% of the time in Spell Hunter I will not pick Rexxar as it is one of the weakest cards in the deck, but people struggle to grasp it because they are stuck in the mindset of value instead of tempo. Same goes for Zul'jin, you don't need it if they die on turn 8.
---
For those who dont know the cards? I've been on a break since MTGA came out.
---
The thing I don't like about nerfing Classic is that these are cards that have been in the game since day 1, they have countless stories attached to them now. Nerfing them destroys that identity and this was exactly why Brode decided to create the Hall of Fame system. 
---
I agree with the 2/1 dagger and the 3 health; odd rogue should get the option to to 2 dmg for 2 mana to inflict pressure without too much efficiency (4 dmg for 2 mana is a lot imo). Pally imo should summon a Recruit and give it +1/+1 (only to the latest recruit tho). 
---
Thank you for a reasoned analysis amidst this othewise salt-tier thread.
---
A third of all cards played forever coming from the classic/basic set is terrible for the long term health of the game.  On the other hand, an evergreen set that sees no play in any meta game doesn't serve the original intent of having an evergreen set.
---
I play almost exclusively wild. Standard is a horrendous boring cesspool of flavor of the month decks propped up by whatever broken card(s) Blizzard decided to make in the most recent expansion.
---
But, please, continue. Tell me how I'm a secret agent for jade druid. I'm sure you'll find some way to show how I secretly wish jade druid had a 100% win rate from this response, too.
---
TIL: using a very common abbreviation makes you unprofessional 
---
Continually nerfing Classic would be detrimentally to new or returning players because the one set of cards they have that are still Standard legal would see less and less play. 
---
Psychic scream?? No? Ok 
---
This is the wrong question entirely. Any and all changes needed to keep HS fresh and functioning are welcome and which set they belong to is immatey.
---
don't mean to hijack, but I think a better idea would be to rotate one old set back in for the year after they rotate the 3 out.
---
So for example, maybe we get TGT in for the year, next year it rotates out and we get Nax 
---
that 2 mana 4/5 giant is fucking annoying 
---
The Flametongue Totem and Equality changes seem sloppy. At least when they are nerfing them so hard, they could add also a slight positive - to not completely destroy the card, just change its purpose. Flametongue at 3 mana could have 4 health easily, it still would be a nerf overall. Equality doubling mana is one of the most absurdly overshot nerfs in history. At least add something like it heals you with 1 hp for each affected minion or anything even remotely redeeming for the card. Good grief.
---
... which every druid is already doing for the auctioneer draw and/or early removal...
---
It was a symmetrical boardclear that required two cards and left enemy deathrattles behind. It was never OP, and has existed since *literally 2014* without being a problem, seeing zero play for months or even years at a time. Not only that, but it was the only option Control Paladin *had*, because Blizzard has seen fit to never bother printing another strong boardclear in Paladin to replace it.
---
People don't run PyroQuality because it's OP, they run it because it's just strong enough and quite literally the only option Paladin has.
---
because they have no idea what they are doing - you can count the number of ppl in their balancing team on one hand and even the patchnotes read that they are exited to see what happens after the nerf...
---
 they fail to come up with any more interesting new mechanics like discover or even just the hero cards (probably because they are afraid to make the game too complicated for the casual crowd), so they resort to nerfing everything that's frequently played to oblivion and think that makes the game feel fresh. 
---
I guess this lack of creativity and poor design philosophy is at least part of the reason why brode left, by now hearthstone feels more like a habit than a challenge to me, not because I am better than others, just because the game did not offer anything really new and exiting in ages. 
---
My problem isn't their power level. It's the fact that Blizzard is nerfing cards that are not problematic in order to deal with the archetype instead of the root of the problem. They've limited their design potential by making these cards and refuse to fix the problem at it's source.
---
I would be for a pre Hall of Fame, exclusively for Genn and Baku .
---
No one has to worry about restrictions and everyone get the dust from those back.
---
Yes. I'm fucking shook.
---
loved the last nerfs, really dont understand these. none of these cards felt oppressive other than maybe spellstone, but spellstone at 5 feels right for wild where itll be soon. 
---
Eqaulity? 
---
Some nice ones in my opinion to...
---
They could HOF them with the rotation in April 
---
The only deck that still runs call to arms is exodia paladin, and I'm fairly certain that it's only because it thins the deck and gets you closer to combo cards. 
---
This card no longer fits into any other deck.
---
Yeah sv classic had so many powerful wincons that they stopped printing good cards for forest and held back for rune though. That set literally had to go for long run health of the game.
---
They need to be Hall of shamed and just completey removed from the game
---
Playing minions and forcing your opponent to make decisions?
---
They’re all perfectly fine in Wild, so nerfing them now would be a super shitty thing to do. 
---
2 mana increase, otherwise Baku pally had an answer to big boys
---
The whole point of the cards is to be able to fill the curve with your hero power, right?
---
Not according to what blizzard said
---
Baku is fine, but Genn is more unplayable than Evil Heckler. Even decks get their strength from using multiple early hero powers to round out their curve. With the proposed effect, even decks would always do nothing on turn 1, always do something weak on turn 3, and always do something weak on turn 4, while also starting down a card in the mull. 
---
Did they increased equality to 4 to prevent odd paladin from using it?
---
Lmao Kripp is literally saying standard becomes shit after 3-4 weeks into each expansion and arena is the only thing thats worth playing. If he is, he is a terrible shill.
---
91 people were close together, like the biggest coincidence in the universe?
---
It's not because they were close, it's because he got paired with an opponent much lower in the rankings and lost, so he loses a billion MMR. It's a horrible system, because you can't chose what opponent you get, and while you should win more against lower opponents... Rank 4 legend vs rank 5 legend will be like 50.1%/49.9%, and rank 4 legend vs rank 100 legend will be like 52%/48%. 
---
The massive rank loss you suffer on a loss makes no sense.
---
It's a system based on Elo systems like they have in chess... Well picture Magnus Carlsen going into a tournament and he has a bad day and they pair him up against a much lower player, Carlsen loses and he drops from #1 world champion to 95th player... That'd be extremely stupid. 
---
Its upvoted now
---
Aye. Baku's actually fairly decent. Everyone's running out of resources and whammo, here's a pile of overcosted vanilla beef. 
---
Well, Blessing of Might is 1 mana give a minion +3 attack. So 1 mana give a minion +2 attack, combo: +4 is perfectly balanced. Even 1 mana 3 attack is better then 2 mana 4 attack.
---
And Rogue known with it's aggresive nature. I don't get that nerf. someone explain to me?
---
So maybe he's better as a 2/2 for 2?  Aka Keleseth?
---
Yeah, the problem being that the upgraded hero powers on turn 1 are just way too powerful.
---
If they had more odd/even synergistic cards than just 1 or 2 and they changed Baku and Glenn to “when you draw this” from “at start of game” it might be fine, and deck building might actually be more interesting.
---
First of all, I play hunter and I am biased. I just came back after a 2 year absence from the game. I can understand the nerf to Spellstone and equality, but not so much the nerfs for rogue and shaman. These \`fast\` decks are not really defining the meta. There are not so much fast decks anyway. Mostly hunter decks and controlly decks like otk paladin, odd quest warrior, (odd) control mage and all variants of priest decks. I do not know what hunter will get for new cards, but it will probably be a lot weaker in the next expansion with the most important cards rotating out. I dont understand why priest is left untouched, although it will also lose many important cards. I dont understand why they need to nerf hunter and paladin (which I think is fair), but leave priest untouched. How about Mass Hysteria to 6 mana or priest Spellstone one more mana?
---
I think a bigger issue is Baku. I really am not looking forward to play the coming year against odd warrior/odd mage/odd pala. Two years ago I had to play justicar truehart to upgrade my hero power. I dont think the drawback for Baku is too much of deal for the huge advantage some classes get.
---
Also, I am missing druids in the game. The occassioal Mechatun druid is really unfun to play against.
---
Like exactly the same or slightly different? I've never played shadowverse 
---
ye he finished 97th :D
---
Reno &amp; BakuGenn are shit design ideas.  they both sit at unreasonable extremes.
---
oh no 2 mana kill a minion how bad
---
I think Hearthstone's appreciation for Ben is really fucking weird, since under his lead, we had Meanstreets of Gagetzan, arguably the shittiest expansion in the game's history. Also, these deathknights that make the game an overpowered shitshow as it is now, were also during his tenure. Not to mention pre-nerfed Shudderwock. 
---
But I guess he can meme-rap, right? What is this Parappa the Rappa? 
---
If it wasn't because of him, when why does him leaving change anything?
---
The real issue around dust refunds is that blizzard is so desperate to give players as little back as possible that it’s hurting the basic and classic set as a result. At least if they nerfed expansion cards in the decks eventually the game would return to normally after everything rotated out, but as it is the basic set’s getting pulled apart as a result.
---
It's the warsong commander effect, not a "start of game" effect
---
yeah, now the comment you replied to is downvoted. there's no winning. =p
---
Really fun ideas overall, but that 'Executus Priest' might as well be called 'Line-up-the-stars Priest', lol. It's gotta be pretty fun when you eventually pull off the combo if your opponent doesn't insta-concede, though.
---
Yes
---
**I have an idea**: At the start of the match, **flip a coin**, if you get face you have the benefit of baku/glenn in odd turns, if seal, in even turns.
---
Same. I play time to time (down from every day) but every time I run into a odd/even deck I just roll my eyes, and take my loss by turn 6 or whatever it usually is.
---
It's amazing how overpowered those basic cards are !!
---
Is it better to nerf powerful classic cards, to rotate them or to just do nothing? This discussion has come up before.
---
Ben Brode talked about it before he left [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5mrkl0/potentially_modifying_the_classic_set_is_a/dc617z8/).
---
A [http://www.strawpoll.me/12064450](strawpoll) at the time showed that the majority of us would rather you rotated cards than nerf them. Only a quarter of people thought nerfing was the best option.
---
Class identity shouldn’t be the sole consideration, it should be about preserving cards and decks we know and enjoy, even if that means rotating them into wild (see molten giant).
---
Admittedly, I’m a much more of a wild player, but I’ve already lost many of my favorite decks over the years, and that feels awful. Typically I’m not even playing the decks that get targeted by the nerfs in the first place, my decks are just collateral damage (e.g. Raza nerf broke my janky Shadowform inspire priest).

Frost bolt and fireball are currently not even played.

understandable but i just thought if the card ever had a full rework it would cost 2 then do that

in that case they should make them 10 mana 1/1s. :D

if Genn and Baku is still strong. we can just add 1 mana to it. Problem solved.

I think I've used about £10, I bought the welcome pack and some other packs.

What packs should I buy with my coins? I play standard, not wild as I don't think I'll even have a chance haha.

What do you mean by legends? 
---
Rest in pieces to literally anyone who crafted legendaries for control paladin, odd rogue, or any of the 1 million variations of hunter. Have fun making your new deck with a l l t h a t d u s t. Honestly you should be able to refund all of your class cards when standard cards are changed. The entire class has changed, and blizzard is p much telling us to go fuck ourselves for crafting cards. 
---
I played N'zoth immediately before Twilight's Call too, so if the game truly believed it was a deathrattle minion due to a bug, both cards should've summoned a copy, but oinly one of them did.

Hunter hero power is quite shit if you sacrifice your burn reach

No. its never worth it to buy anything on the EU store. Manually type the US store link into your browser and buy from there. IT will be 20$ which is cheaper than 20Euro. It will ask you which server you want the packs for when u buy so it doesnt matter which country store you use.
---
It should be incredibly hard for control to win. They design their decks to have slow, resource based win conditions. Control should have counters(aggro is not a counter as control is usually favored when built right and given the right tools). No one wants tank up warrior where the game is decided turn 5 but you have to play till turn 40. Combo should lose to aggro, that's what I was saying, their clear and removal are too good, with removal also usually able to activate their draw engines(gadget+spellstone, acolyte+pyro+spells, acolyte+defile). There should also be more mill and hand manipulation to counter them. Their win condition isn't the problem, it's their ability to draw so quickly and remove everything.
---
Is Arcane Tracker any good? I've seen other's use it before but haven't checked it out myself. Would you reccomend it?
---
If this is honestly your take on this, then you don’t realize what a bad decision making these cards was. It doesn’t matter if they cost next to nothing, or if they include ten legendaries, the fact that there are even SOME viable decks mean that blizzard is severely limited in their card design and nerfs. Every odd and even cost card must take these two cards into account, or they might make the odd/even decks completely broken. Mana nerfs, like equality, have to become extremely expensive, effectively gutting the card just so it can’t be used in odd paladin. Blizzard has screwed the rest of the game over just because they didn’t have the foresight that even a SINGLE viable odd or even deck would mess with their card balance for the foreseeable future. 
---
yes, just like some cards in the brawl that has "Start of game: draw this card" (IIRC, well the text can be a bit different), which mean that it will always be the first card you draw after mulliganing. It ll make any baku/gen decks less consistent to their game plan, and like quests, it gives a huge card disadvantage early game.
---
congrats.. if you can quickly nip into 5 then you have a whole month to try that legend push
---
u got a nice epic as well :)
---
Yeah but no pretty pictures!
---
Yeah i agree, it would be a smart nerf
---
does the US store will connect to my HS account on mobile too?
---
can we not just go back to nerfing druid?

even though it isn't really a problem
---
Most definitively. Just make sure you know which server you play on the mobile and when u make the purchase you choose that option when presented to you.

5/5/5 | Battlecry: Shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck. When drawn, it explodes for 5 damage.  
---
I second this, I moved on months ago and I have zero regrets. People complain about mono red and nexus decks, but the real beauty of magic is the side boarding. I play best of three so if I come up against braindead burn decks, I get to alter my deck with 15 pre-chosen cards in between games to give me more heals and early removal. Much more interaction, and a better F2P system. I miss Nzoth however
---
Yeah, he did. Downhill from there. Before of that we had ups and downs, but overall the game worked.
---
Secret Keeper at 1, Eaglehorn at 3, Masked Contender at 3. Sounds really cool but improbable!
---
No way requires more skill. Getting 10k requires you to win matches and lose some on purpose. Getting rank 1 requires you to win matches. How is it harder?
---
Did i get wooshed?
---
Every year they pick some classic cards that are evergreen and removecthem from standard.
---
They usually remove auto-include cards or stuff that combos way too well.
---
You are speaking for yourself. That's cool. 
---
Just don't expect everyone to share your views or reasons. Different people have different reasons for playing a class. For example I find it unnecessary for people to stick to a specific class (or classes). Everybody should play every class (if we assume everybody has access to all cards). Sure some classes will feel more natural than others but that doesn't mean that you should just play that or those.
---
new keyword: hereditary "its effects are only applicable while this is in your hand, this starts in your opening hand" would be more interesting, you can mulligan but once you draw it again the effect goes online again.
---
So by that logic nerf every strong deck pointlessly without purpose while destroying the playability of the classic cards which  new players need.
---
Currently none of the nerfed cards beside Spellstone were logical,
---
Neat
---
Well, yeah. Dragons fire and voodoo doll are literally removal, one of which synergizes(?) Great with jaina, and the other two are elemental which are significantly weaker without jaina up. 
---
The odd variant of big mage is slightly less reliant on the DK but it's still one of the most DK reliant decks around, falling short of just paladin combo. 
---
Did you click on the link?
---
Baku is pretty high on their watchlist. High possibility of nerfs in July
---
Hall of Fame isn’t a good enough solution now that Wild has a growing card and player pool. Flametongue, for instance, is hardly a problem in standard but in Wild, Even Shaman is one of the most annoying decks to play against. And Flametongue is a particularly annoying card in that deck.
---
But otherwise I agree. The cards are only problematic because they underestimated the power level that Genn and Baku would have in certain classes. The obvious thing to do is to nerf those cards/archetypes rather than slowly raze the Classic set to the ground.
---
True, didn't consider that. The shaman and paladin were really hard
---
the mana cost won't change it at all, which is why blizzard haven't moved address glenn and baku. the only way to nerf the cards is change them to 1 and 2 mana minions and have their affects be battlecrys which would make the decks less reliable and thus less likely to be played.
---
you could change there cost to 50 mana right now and it wouldn't affect them, because if you are playing an odd and even deck the cards you never want to draw is glenn and baku which is totally wierd given that I don't remember any other deck in hearthstone where you build a card around a card you never want to draw.
---
Liar, your post about being downvoted is upvoted! I shall downvote your lie about being downvoted. 
---
This has been mentioned before: while the cards would likely be played for the effect alone, regardless of stats, Genn actually has good stats, while Baku is always bad for tempo.
---
No not really 
---
I thought of that, but that'd still be pretty decent. And random cards are WAY worse than Discover x2 for an awesome minion. Instead of getting a 5 mana 5/6 Rush, Lifesteal and Can't be targeted, or an 6 mana 3/8 All your beasts have charge, you get a Booty Bay Bodyguard, a Harvest Golem or a Blood Imp
---
It's miraculous that any of you are, to be frank. I stopped playing shortly after Grand Tournament.
---
They could change the effect to be more like quests so it starts in your hand as a spell and you need to play it to get the effect.  One fewer cards at the beginning of the game and essentially skipping an early turn would slow down even/odd decks.
---
I started playing during Witchwood and I'm quite a big fan. My friend got me into it he's been playing since old gods iirc 
---
When you have different decks with strength and weakness you end up with a meta where you start with a big disadvantage depending on your deck choice.
---
When you have a deck that can potentially win against everything. Everyone uses that single deck and you see only that.
---
We can't have it both ways. Players have to choose what they want.
---
I personally prefer a meta like this where players have 16+ deck to choose from.
---
 It was good and refreshing for the competitive aspect because there was more than the mere game skill. There was the preparation and thought on the lineup the plays a big role in it. And players with forward thinking got rewarded.
---
Compare that to when everyone played Elise Control Warrior or Renolock. Only sometimes matchups where decided by skill. Too many other times, games where decided by who drew Justicar First or Emperor First. Or in the case of Cubelock meta, by who had more Mountain Giants in opener hand.
---
If I have to endure a meta, where everyone plays the same fucking deck and then games are decided by chance anyway. I say fuck that. I'll take 16 decks everytime of the year.
---
Yeah this is what I was thinking, seems like a pretty easy and well deserved fix.
---
Rekuraab#2831 EU
---
Trading 80g but you'll have to go first, also looking for people to practice with and have fun, can also help rushing other quests and share whatever decks i have.
---
There's always Shadowverse if you want something on android. While it has its own issues it did rotate the classic set, does nerf more often, and even buff cards as needed, and is very generous on the free to play front.
---
That'd be a nice condition, actually.
---
Have Baku/Genn stay the same, but "If you draw this card, reverse this effect."
---
So you either keep the card in your starting hand, or try to discard it, or have an unkown countdown to how long its effect will last.
---
I dunno, I think Shaman is still overpowered.
---
Hex should be nerfed to 5 mana IMO.
---
:(
---
Is it any wonder that my winning run did not include him? I'm still not entirely sure how I beat Bristlemar, and the only reason I survived the Lava Chamber is because hero power minions don't trigger that boss' hero power.
---
The OTKs nowadays make you jump through more hoops, e.g. Quest Mage, Exodia/Shirvallah/Anyfin Paladin, any Mecha'thun deck, even Togwaggle Druid and Malygos Rogue are kind of wacky, we've just gotten used to them.
---
These decks are all heavily built around the OTK vs. the Rogue Leeroy package back then. Kind of like the old Druid combo didn't require anything special except putting in Force of Nature and Savage Roar.
---
I will say that even shaman is my most played deck right now. The deck has a long way to go to down before it isn't top tier. This is a hit of course, but isn't going to change it's #1 status in wild.
---
It kind of sucks because ideally you'd like a nerf that only hits even and not every other shaman deck. Since nearly every aggro and midrange variant (elementals!) that isn't combo runs flametongue. But that's the problem with even shaman. There isn't any 1 standout card that's either exclusive or shapes the deck itself besides Genn. You can nerf one or two cards and the deck will still be fine, and easily find a replacement in the future. The deck is just even goodstuff.
---
I got 10
---
This has already been done here
---
Virtually all of the "meta is stale" complaints are sparked by new expansion cards that are just absurdly powerful. The only card like that targeted by this nerf was Emerald Spellstone.
---
No need to flex on us rank 10 peasants
---
You even could’ve dealt 12 damage by targeting your armani berserker
---
It got nerfed twice at once.
---
Damn I made this comment on Kripps video last night 😅
---
There’s at least three Malygos on board
---
Why does everyone suddenly want a Baku Genn nerf?
---
I don't think Hunter decks with Spellstone would feel this old if they didn't also play Animal Companion, Eaglehorn Bow, Kill Command, Snake Trap, Freezing Trap, Explosive Trap, Tundra Rhino, Scavenging Hyena, etc.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
I really don't agree with the flame totem and the equality nerf, blizzards phillosphy to nerf these cards are the reason i don't think they should be nerfed. They have been prevalent and a core class cards since classic. 
---
dude, activision has been a part of blizzard since 2007, if they were the cause, then hearthstone wouldn't have been changed, because it would already be affected by them.
---
I’d settle for making it start in your hand, and being a “once drawn” effect.  Basically forcing the decks to have one less card in their hand at the start.
---
I think those are totally valid claims, even shaman and odd rogue are definitely the boogeymen of wild when it comes to aggro. But these nerfs won't change too much. The decks are just even/odd goodstuff essentially, none of the cards are critical to the decks success and they'll easily find replacements soon.
---
I would argue the other decks in those classes get hurt more. Even shaman won't drop much in power, the deck is just so good in wild right now. But a flametongue nerf hurts something like elemental or any midrange deck that runs it. And those decks didn't deserve the nerf.
---
This isn't even a design space nerf, it's a power level classic nerf. But there's way more problematic cards in classic. I don't see many people advocating for a flametongue nerf actually, it's such a hallmark card to the class. It's like saying frost bolt should be nerfed.
---
No. It gives people who don't need golden cards some extra dust and it gives whales an opportunity to spend thousands of dollars for a golden collection so the game is lucrative enough to Blizzard that F2P players can remain F2P.
---
I like this comparison, but the only deck in which duplicates kill your win condition is Raza Priest. In other decks having Reno activated a couple of turn later shouldn't be much of a difference right? Also since witchwood we have been having quite a lot of cards that can draw your dups (town crier, witchwood piper, raiding party, sand binder, etc.).
---
I feel like this would be pretty hard to use consistently in a Reno deck, but maybe you can exploit the Genn/Baku neutral quest limitations.
---
And how did that play out for Starving Buzzard? That's the whole point of the post. Cards that had their mana cost doubled generally don't see any play at all.
---

---
... How would that even work? Rotating the classic set every year or two would effectively mean there is no classic set, only yet another set that rotates out that you need to buy cards for.
---
As for the base cards, it would just be giving us some free cards overtime to replace the other free base cards. It's doable, but this is Activision, I don't see them going for a solution that involves throwing out a bunch of free cards.
---
But at least you have some dust! Hopefully. 
---
I think not being able to put it on either leeroy or the 2/1 with divine shield and charge will lower its burst and the time it takes to kill their opponent. I think it will still be a good deck due to the replacements you mentioned as well as just the rest of the deck being powerful however, I do think the change will be noticeable.
---
I mean the community was asking for major changes starting last year and we got quests, death knights, legendary weapons, Baku/Genn, and legendary spells. All of them were new ways to change up the meta. Now that they are too strong we complain about the death knights and Baku/Genn, but honestly the game needed something to change.
---
I ran a Reno deck with 1 dup back in the day, and honestly, it was all right. Feels bad when you lose a game only because of a non-active Reno, but with 1 (*maybe* 2) cards, you have pretty good odds. I definitely wouldn't go above 2 though, and I also don't think the Baku/Genn effect is powerful enough to warrant waiting until you draw specific cards, especially considering it's most useful in the early game (vs Reno which is most useful when you've lost a lot of HP and have enough mana to play it)
---
Basically, if Justicar saw almost no play outside Control Warrior, it seems incredibly unlikely a "quest Genn/Baku" deck with a few bad cards would be worth running, since you'd activate the effect about as late as Justicar a lot of the time, with a lower mana cost but also a signfiicant deckbuilding restriction + what essentially amounts to "1 discard" in the quest card.
---
Shitpost. 
---
But really, that doesn’t solve the problem. They are just as bad, if not worse, in wild. 
---
 True, but would prevent them from using coin, hitting u for 2/4 damage and then reloading on turn 2 without playing a single card from their deck. Would impact all the heroe powers. 
---
&gt; In the end those clears, with their up and downs, remove interactivity and enable solitaire play.
---
If you have to build a board back up to win, all clears do is reset the game state.
---
It's the cards with extra victory conditions, i.e. Mechathun, Paladin DK (to a lesser degree Warlock DK and Mage DK count too), Togwaggle, Hakkar, that make clears and stuff like Spreading Plague particularly uninteractive.  When the only strategy that promoted board clears was fatigue, which required skill to maximize, clears weren't so bad since they weren't essentially auto-wins, you still had to play it out.
---
Also don't forget them Hall of Fame-ing Ice Block because it led to states where Mages could ignore opponent's boards while doming them to the face protected, then printing Time Out, which is an Ice Block that's immune to Secret counters and can be played on demand.  It's funny that they nuked all the dodgy win con decks like Freeze Mage but then immediately put in super Toys 'R' US versions of them that just happen to require lots of new legendaries.  Like what do you expect to happen to the metagame when almost all aggro decks suck, you get clear heavy combo decks or decks with lots of mid range sustain with sticky creatures or ways to revive/make more (i.e. Hunter/Warlock DK).
---
I don’t think you don’t know what missing lethal means
---
The problem, IMO, is that the upgraded hero power was designed around Justicar Trueheart, a 6 drop that you may not get, and had to invest resources into a bad body for.  Putting those powers in a Start of Game effect is silly, the powers should have been rebalanced for the effect.  
---
Should be noted that they're performing very poorly economically too, and that Activisions way of increasing prices to increase revenue instead of making great games to increase revenue is spreading to the Blizzard part of the company.
---
Eternal#2164[EU]

Trade 80g quest, you go first  
---
Online right now
---
Will update when completed!
---
Glad a fellow essentially f2p could help. The decks controlling the meta are picture perfect. Nothing wrong with throwing a curve ball
---
You should buff then by dropping the cost 1 instead.  
---
Think about it 
---
At rank 50, you get 3 classic packs upon getting in rank 45,40,35,30, and getting in rank 25 gets you 2 classic packs and 2 from the 4 most recent hs expansions, making that a whopping 22 packs just for getting into rank 25
---
I realise it's their only board clear but look at other classes and their "board clears". Arcanosaur is 6, Flamestrike at 7. Priest with Psychic Scream at 7. Brawl is at 5 but there's no guarantee to clear a board. A full board clear at 4 cost is too cheap.
---
would you consider it a buff if they changed the text to "all enemy minion's health change to 1" and still keep the 4 mana?
---
If you are serious about getting better I highly recommend it. At first it teaches you simple things like knowing what cards are in your deck. This let's you concentrate on reading your opponent's plays better. You can also srr what turn your opponent drew each card. So if they had a card on turn 2 and didn't play a turn 3 play (against aggro for example), you can probably guess it's either a tech card or higher cost removal/creature.
---
Programmer laziness. Maybe nzoth looks at a cards attributes for deathrattle while twilight's call looks at its attributes for an on death trigger (and yes, they're different! Silverware defo has a death trigger to move but does not have the Dr skull)
---
This isn't even remotely noteworthy
---
who even plays geist anymore. It only helps against 1 deck that is barely played on ladder. I do not get decisions like this
---
I thought wild was a clusterfuck anyway tho. 
---
So this talk about something being around till april referred to the april of 2020 or is that a different batch of cards that rotates out?
---
It’s actually not that bad. I played it for some time and it’s good fun. It’s not a T1 deck but it definitely isn’t ass.
---
thunderust#1184 80g trade Asia i show u go... reply here for faster completion
---
As for as pally identity goes:
---
Aldor Peacekeeper and Humility, which reduce the minion's attack to 1.
---
Other pally cards such as Dark Conviction, Sunkeeper Tarim and so on are all about the central theme of changing attack/HP totals of minions, in many cases not outright kill, but bringing them to their knees all the same.
---
Nerf to Equality + Pyromancer combo has made way for Shrink Ray. Yes it isn't a board clear. But I don't dislike the direction they're pushing things, less solitaire and more minion-to-minion board interaction. Shrink ray everything down, then bump the big threats away with your own stuff or even your equipped weapon.
---
I expect to see the return of Aldor Peacekeeper and use of Shrink Ray as a control tool. Follow the rules!
---
With most mages being odd, would that even matter?
---
Yes. The fact that next to nobody, including Blizzard, gives a shit about Wild. They'd never nerf Standard cards for Wild.
---
I have invested around 150$ in the first two years of Hearthstone then had a 1.5 break and I was pretty disappointed seeing how I'm basically unable to play meta decks in standard anymore without disenchanting all my older cards. I agree that Genn and Baku are a nuisance right now but the real problems with Cashstone are never actually addressed. Genn and Baku will be nerfed or rotated out to appease the reddit mob and they'll just introduce something else that polarizes the entire ladder experience all whilst having larger and larger cash-gated barriers of entry.
---
Which archetype is killed by the new nerfs? If call to arms didn't kill even paladin and level up didn't kill odd paladin, do you think flametongue will kill even shaman? 
---
Got the lunar new year bundle and only opened 1 legendary which was lady in white. 
---
Let me know if you ever plan on selling them. I’d love to commotion my favorite card Raza the unchained pre nerf. 
---

i played shudder combo half year.
---
but I have not played HS for the last a month.
---
i wanted to be a legend with shudder combo in wild.
---
Even 1000 hours it was not enough.
---
and you killed me.
---
Well, it only completely \*destroys\* one deck, it helps against every druid and also messes with evolve shamans pretty heavily. Even hitting 1 card with a geist is pretty helpful in my opinion
---
Well, some of the nerfs are really hard to explain other than that Blizzard has a new card to replace them. Other nerfs (except for Hex and the original Hunter's Mark nerf)  have been a direct reaction to the meta.
---
You forgot divine favor lol. The pilfered power of card draw. 
---
I say it's a bad business model because it generally feels bad to have something that you've spent money on be invalidated. I also assume most of the player base doesn't own all of the cards, and can't just switch decks whenever a balance update happens, and I think a fair amount of players will just leave the game rather than shell out more money.
---
Putting that aside, do you think that these are good balance changes that will contribute to a better and healthier game overall? To me they feel like a pretty adhoc response to a stale metagame, just like their last balance update. All that happened was that the tier 1 decks that were untouched remained tier 1, and some tier 2 decks shifted up.
---
I had to read the comments to understand the joke. I'm an idiot haha.
---
No, but it's weird and surprising enough on Day 1 that it can win many games against unrefined decks.
---
Thanks for your thoughtful input.
---
It didnt had the winrate that naga warlock, star aligner druid, or even shaman had. I do think something should be done, but better than a nerf, some actual graveyard tech cards.
---
Yup - exactly what I've been saying. They can draw into their clears, heals and OTK combos as easily as they could, because of the crazy amount of card draw and deck thinning. 
---
I think prime targets for HOF are the Loot hoarders and novice engineers. Notice how many solitaire decks use these.
---
https://i.imgur.com/bFU1fek.gifv
---
Not according to hsreplay, and if a deck is good then need to be nerf? I don't even have it, I play with hunter in ranked and watch streams, always seems to me that depends a lot of know how to play it, and even if you're good doesn't mean you're going to win always. Aggro and combo druid usually are faster in killing you.
---
Nerfed to 2 mana
---
SpencerRice#2648 EU LF 80g quest trade, I show and you go first.
---
Honestly, my favorite solution would be to enable aggro so it could keep decks honest - you never saw super greedy OTK decks before they nerfed aggro cards like Arcane Golem and Leper Gnome.  I could count on one hand the number of Prophet Velens I saw when Face Hunter was good, and no way could a deck with a 10 mana win con depend on making it that far with a super loose deck construction like Cloning Gallery Priest.  It would also do a pretty good job reining in stuff like Rattle Hunter since they couldn't expect to make it to turn 5 with their light removal package and start doing the degen stuff it ends up doing.
---
Other than that, I think the OTK cards are where you go.  You can't really nerf something like Mechathun or Togwaggle without Warsong Commandering it and changing it completely, and maybe you keep one around like Topsy Priest since that actually does require some skill to pilot, but they've been where the primary stale-ness seems to come from, since once the optimal deck is discovered, there's no point in trying to innovate on the metagame anymore.
---
Same!!!! Anyfin is one of my favorite decks to play in wild, and this will hurt it a lot 😨 
---
I hate this approach to card nerfing: it’s broken? Increase its mana cost! 
---
And the fact you had to have a 2 card combo to wipe the board of any non-divine shield minions is not broken. This plus hunters mark nerf makes me feel like they are trying to gut 2 classes that don’t have any hard removal, for some reason
---
And advice. You shouldn’t craft a single card 5 months or more before the rotation. 
---
Now the nerfs hit almost every class there. I can bet for a future priest otk nerf too. 
---
Play smart and save your dust and gold (and dollars)
---
Eeew damn pepega hunter
---
blizzard has been known to shit all over decks right before release, for example egg hunter in KFT, and Meatwagon decks
---
Will never understand people like you and the hate boner you have for Kibler. Guy has been playing and designing games for 25 years, so I think his opinion is worth something. But somehow, people who obviously don't watch his stream or know what he's about like to scream "bias!!!" whenever he states his opinion on Hearthstone.
---
&gt; He hates OTK and can't play control mage/ priest.
---
Like this is just LMAO. 
---
It could cost as u stated with it always being in ur starting hand like a quest for example
---
Discarding a card is still a huge deal.
---
he burnt both naturalises tho
---
Sent you a request man, have the same quest
---
Stop comparing cards one for one when they're in other classes. Paladin doesn't run Lights Justice because it's hero power affects the board. Hunter's doesn't. Giving it a Rogue hero power + 1 durability + immunity for 1 mana is probably maybe too good.
---
Odd Paladin is a tempo deck. Imagine if you drew Baku every game _and_ missed you 1 drop.
---
The idea is if they're not played at all anymore because they're so bad, you might as well remove them entirely
---
Those 4 Reno’s beg to differ
---
Totem Golem and Thing From Below are both 'fair' cards. Totem Golem is a 3mana 3/4 and Thing From Below you invest the mana into discounting it. Even Shaman in wild is a deck of fair cards that comes together because of amazing synergy.
---
Unidentified Maul.
---
Cool. It would be okay for some Hunter cards that are really good not to exist.
---
Only against Control Priest. The matchup is winnable, but only barely, probably around 30 percent. Quest is pretty much an auto loss.
---
I’m on the Odd Shaman train myself /s
---
Every Druid basically means one deck. You can put better cards.
---
It is ridiculous we don't have these options in a multiplayer game in 2019. I remember being amazed with Perfect Dark on N64 and its multiplayer options.
---
Less broken than the current version.
---
This seems pretty dam clever fix!
---
Rank 16 rope plays
---
Ah, yes, so delightful
---
maybe next year
---
I don't dust 'em unless they're duplicates! I strive to have as close to a complete collection as possible. Never know when you'll need them down the road!
---
The best kind of plays
---
True, Cult Master is probably best played the same turn you trade minions. It'd probably work best with Snake Trap like the tweet you linked mentioned.
---
Thanks for letting me know about this card.
---
What the fuck? I mean maybe you don't remember but aggro pally was always super strong and those were staple cards of that deck
---
I think that's because at first most were just happy that they were doing anything, even if it was mediocre and stingy, and hoped it would lead to more of the same, and eventually turn into thoughtful and good changes.
---
Then after a year or two they're still just mixing things up, not really making many solid improvements, at least none that should have been done immediately, and none that would cost them serious dust.
---
When I said he can't play I meant not his skill.
---
I meant that he can't afford to play that deck.
---
I'm not a designer and didn't want to influence the survey but if you're curious as to what I would do, I see a few options:
---
* Start the effect after a certain turn (like turn 5 or 6) - I quite like this one. Would reduce explosive starts while adding to the value game
---
* Nerf the enhanced hero powers - would be really tricky to balance
---
* Make the effect a battlecry, reduce the costs of Genn and Baku - not too different from Justicar, probably wouldn't see much play
---
Any other ideas?
---
Pray to god they don’t highroll. Mages and shamans can hex and polymorph, but every other class is pretty much screwed. Maybe a demonic project to hopefully hit Barnes? Sap can also work for rogues. 
---
You seem pretty angry about a children's card game, so I'm going to just move on.
---
I just learned about them and none of them look that bad to me. I'll particularly love seeing Flametongue removed from the Even Shaman's kit (it's oppressive af in wild). I'm guessing that people are upset because some classic cards are being hit this time? Either that or people were invested in their own idea of what to change and were disappointed that the devs chose other targets.   
---
I dunno, man... this sub is always bordering on toxic and never more than one bad meme away from exploding. It's always been like that. 
---
You really seem like you either really want to quit or you're trolling so I'm conflicted about replying to you but, for the sake of conversation, I don't think anyone here is going to believe you've "tired everything". You've mentioned some of the decks you're using in some of the replies, no matter how bad you are at this game those decks should pull 80%+ from rank 25-rank 10. You'd literally have to TRY to lose with those decks.
---
Here is an example of 0 legendary, 960 dust, budget deck Krip used in that rank range and was able to go 24 wins with 0 losses. I'm in the middle of editing a video of me going from rank 48 to rank 5 in my alt account with 80% win rate within one week using a very similar deck, except mine has 2 legendary cards. Anyway, u/squiggly_itme is right, there are some that would probably coach you out of the kindness of their hearts until you understand the game better. Shouldn't take more than 5-10 games, it's really not that complex of a game.
---
Man, some people really struggle to admit faults without a caveat. 
---
Is this famous anti-big priest shaman deck?
---
Then why not nerf all the core cards so they're barely playable? That would solve the "balance every single expansion" issue. It would also drive customers away and create a high barrier for entry which would decrease profit.

&gt;control Paladin can still function ok
---
wew thats a big assumption to make lad
---
People keep saying there's no good way to nerf them but there clearly are. My suggestion would be for the upgrade to be time-delayed (start of game: after 5 turns, upgrade your hero power), or only have certain number of uses (e.g. 5 upgraded uses, then reverts back to normal). Or, my favorite, the former for Baku and the latter for Genn.
---
Should be all the key pieces are still there, not sure if you can make it viable
---
If only Blizzard wasn't just a small indie company and could actually provide us such things...
---
&gt;nobody, including Blizzard, gives a shit about Wild
---
And why did they nerf Aviana some months ago? IIRC it was because of domination of Star Aligner Druid, which became very OP
---
\&gt;  Now Paladin need 8 cost to clear field without pyromacer. 
---
Equality + Consecrate is 6 now. Not sure where you're getting 8 from. 
---
Kibler is always right, but unfortounately, this is probably part of why blizz is being dick mode and giving him fewer casting opportunities. 
---
It's used against aggro in Even Pally which has been tier 1 for a while
---
&gt; What they did to Equality not only wrecks class identity by removing Paladin's only decent classic removal tool; it completely pushes any non aggressive Paladin variant out of viability, at least until they print new stuff. 
---
Lack of hard removal is supposed to be a weakness of Paladin the way Blizzard designs it.
---
They purposely give Paladin **zero** options to remove a card safely without triggering it's deathrattle.
---
It was his last "fuck you" to the HS community after MSoG, KoFT and KnC.
---
Imagine Team 5's balance team is a doctor and the playerbase is the patient.
---
The patient can tell the doctor where the pain is (what decks are overly-dominate on ladder), but most likely be unable to properly diagnose the problem properly. 
---
Quite often, the patient may actually have a suggestion that could be quite detrimental to their health (recommending Team 5 change power plays such as Voidlord and Ultimate Infestation rather than those cards' enablers such as Possessed Lackey and Nourish).
---
Mark Rosewater actually spoke on this in his GDC talk [*Twenty Years Twenty Lessons Learned*](https://youtu.be/QHHg99hwQGY?t=3355) as Lesson 19.
---
Nothing wrong with diplomatic wording, especially when you're representing more than just yourself.
---
Does this really have to be seen as a negative? People should be happy that he's talking about attention being directed towards specifically Genn and Baku.
---
The obvious reason why he may not say "Yeah we're definitely not happy with Genn and Baku right now" is glaring you right in the face: *they didn't change Genn and Baku,* so stating that outright just looks like they're being inactive for the sake of being inactive.
---
Both hit face, EZ Clap

No, my defense is of the free and open discussion of ideas, and absolute disgust of authoritarians like you who want to be able to control what other people say and think and read and write and listen to.
---
Every word you write demonstrates this presumption - you don't believe I am intelligent enough to decide for myself what I listen to, or what I say, or what is or is not appropriate. No, it is you who has the otherwordly knowledge to make this decision, for the rest of us.
---
Please, keep saying things like this, just as loudly and clearly as you have here. It's good to know who the enemies of a free society are.
---
Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. I usually get downvoted asking questions, I didn't realize it reset every month. I should have a new card back then, since I reached level 20!
---
Don’t listen to all the haters... “I knew that since kindergarten”... I didn’t knew that and I play a lot of hearthstone, and know how to pull of the fireworks and volcano combo
---
Imo make wild a free for all and instead of rotating sets just use a band list that's a page out of yugioh that I'd love to see HS take. Then you can balance by banning cards from standard and make cards for old arc types again like More gang cards more c thun cards more cards for all the other mechanics that they just tossed away heck more jade druid but band idol could be fun
---
Tip: Don't play the second giant on 4 against priest. You could have been mass hystera'ed. You were lucky :)
---
Perception is reality. People were complaining just as much and in mostly the same way about Hunter decks as they do about other decks.
---
&gt;They do not care about changing a meta for the sake of it.
---
Are you going for some kind of record of not making sense? Addressing the meta when people are upset with it (and when addressing it will ultimately result in a net positive) is ultimately better for their bottom line. You act like anything that's in Blizzard's financial interest must inherently be against the best interest of the players. That runs counter to the way good business should work.
---
Maybe you *did* work for Blizzard and they laid you off or something because I can't understand how someone could be so eager to find a reason to fault them when the truth is so much more obvious and harmless.
---
"We talked a lot about what the right thing to do with Genn and Baku, they're both very very powerful cards that are seeing play in a wide variety of different decks, that's a great thing, we want expansion cards to be powerful and see play in lots and lots of decks, but they are absolutely the kind of things that are defining the metagame right now in *probably* a way that isn't super healthy.
---
It's been a long time that these are the best cards in the classes that are playing them and some of the best decks in the metagame right now, so we're investigating what the right thing to do with them are. They're not seeing any changes in these updates, we're updating a handful of cards - some of which are good in Genn and Baku decks - but Genn and Baku are very much something that we're looking at for the next few weeks and next few months."
---
It's not the project he worked on seemed to have succeeded that much. Just saying...
---
No, it does not need a 2.0 for "long term survival."
---
Literally just by more rapidly rotating in and out cards from the Classic and Basic Set they can achieve much of the effect they want.
---
This 10,000 free gold and deck size increasing bullshit just sounds like someone who naively believes that they are one of the very few people in the world who "truly understands" what Hearthstone needs.
---
Taunt = Cheat
---
I do this a ton, and when I say HS players should do this in this sub, I get downvoted. So strange. A nice thing to do for someone that costs you nothing, but gets them a whole lot. Grats on rank 5 - now you can experiment with the nerfs without concern.
---
Maybe they could have mechanics similar to a quest. Something along the lines of "Start of Game: If your deck has only even-cost cards, enable Pursuit of Baku." 
---
Similarly to playing a quest card, this is activated-"Pursuit of Baku: Play 5 odd-cost cards to upgrade your hero power."
---
You get the same upside, and you don't have to wait to draw the card to upgrade your hero power, but you do have to wait a few turns.
---
JawZ#2897 - Trading 80g NA - You go first.
---
But almost all the issues with odd decks are that the hero powers are balanced around coming down on turn 6, not on turn 0. There is a reason Hunter, rogue and paladin don't run justicarr when they do run Baku. 
---
Baku is saying what is balanced at turn 6, is also balanced at turn 0 in exchange for a single bad card in your deck (because let's face it, outside of odd warrior, there is more than enough good cards to make up for losing even cards in odd decks)
---
still interested? I just added you
---
Npne of these cards are general purpose nor autoinclude
---
&gt; Did any of those changes make the meta feel "fresh" for any lasting period of time? 
---
Yes, definitely, hitting agressive Mage and Warrior out of meta, decks that we have seen forever, absolutely made meta more fresh. Burn mage was menace for rogue for a long time, and experimantaion with it would be futile if it would still be in game. Not "really" fresh, that's what we have rotation for. But it's healthy for game to hit some old staples from time to time. 
---
&gt; It'll be fun to watch that die out again within a week. 
---
That's what people said about Spell Hunter. And look where we are.
---
&gt; Odd Rogue will swap for literally who cares.
---
I care? There is no earlygame card that is even close on powerlevel to Cold Blood. Deck will be worse without it. No out-of-meta worse, but having no Cold-Blood openings and losing extra reach will make some even matchups worse. And then there will be rotation - make an experiment. Try to do Odd Rogue with no cards from Mamooth year and without Cold Blood. It's really bad deck. Zoo was said to be evergreen deck, but changing metas and losing Power Overwhelming hit them strong enough.
---
I'm not saying I like strength of Baku for Rogue.  I'm saying Team5's solution is good enough right now, and better in long term. Ultimately, we want to see every expansion change meta a bit, and strong classic cards are blocking it.
---
actually you can evolve snowfury giant... mountain giant
---
I think they have just worked themselves into a corner at this point. The issue with having so many  class choices is that its is impossible to ad cards that balance out for all the decks. The hero powers and class specific cards which make the game unique also leave it vulnerable to the issues of balance and flow.
---
IMO the only way to fix the issues with the balance is to create a new mode that is focused on balance. offer a form of play that allows people to restrict the value of cards you are playing with. as an example label every card with a 1-100 point value and offer the option to play games at specific point values. This creates options where OP cards can be balanced by simply making it more costly to put in the deck. THis would also create much more unique match ups as people would learn to create strategies around cards that are less valuable.
---
As for flow the issue comes and go the only real issue with the flow  is that the variance in the meta means we have too many rush decks at a time or control decks at times making games feel to fast or to slow. 
---
I think this would be a harmful decision to the game. The meta dictates decks you’ll encounter often enough that you don’t need confirmation that you opponent is playing a certain deck. However, there’s a benefit to playing other decks by having the information revealed after mulligan. 
---
As for revealing information of what card is in other hand, this takes away the aspect of playing around a card, knowing when to push for a win, etc. 
---
In short: yes.
---
&gt; Give everyone 10000 gold to adapt to this massive overhaul.
---
Right. Why would they do that?
---
Basically nothing gonna change while people play and buy stuff. And they'll do they best to keep it that way without changing the game drastically. This whole year they were releasing low power level expansions, this is as drastic as it will ever get. This is part of the big plan, you're living it.
---
The added text of genn could say "if your opponent doesn't have baku, upgrade his hero power as well." And something similar for baku.
---
So in an odd vs even match both have better hero powers but in a different way.
---
I don't think it will happen but if cards are ever banned from standard play before they rotate (that aren't hof'd) it will be these.
---
Unless they seriously gut their power level somehow.
---
 \[NA\] 80g trade - longbow0921#1683
---
So...l this isnthe worst thing happening for you since beta? Doubt.
---
:) I noticed you were definetly talking more about the even decks just couldn't help myself. 
---
Short answer is: No. Tracker reads data from your device and browsers don't allow scripts to read data from the device for security reasons.
---
I put up a bid.
---
It may not be classic causing the issues, but you will never make a game fresh by keeping it the same. Your problem with the meta doesnt seem to be that classic cards were nerfed but that classic cards were nerfed to make way for even more oppressive/bland cards.
---
My philosophy is that cards should rotate in and out of the classic set when new good cards are released and when the old cards are too oppressive or end up in every deck for too long. 
---
Yeah i know, but the urge of having it on the board was more important :D
---
He played [[Spiritsinger Umbra]] the next turn and just had infinite value. I was able to clear a bit with [[vile necrodoctor]] but it still wasn't enough.

Oh true, but then mountain giant doesnt evolve after that. My bad XD

Well, but then again we all know what *on the radar* can actually mean...

Everybody knows that the face is the place

---
If the face plays taunt, me still go face
---
That's just wrong. If you copy novice engineer with faceless do you expect to draw a card as well?
---
In case of Yogg'Saron, he was specifically nerfed to be that way.
---
 There is a huge difference between reno and odd/even. Sure they both  have restrictions that make for interesting deck building for a couple  of days before they get all figured out, but the great thing about even/odd  decks was the variety it had with most games being played with different  combinations of tools. Reno was the exact opposite as drawing it won a game by itself versus on archetype.  Even  if he got new better cards it doesn’t change its gameplay revolved around drawing him.
---
Consistency of Odd/Even decks is something good. You know what you play against from start of game. And, especially even, has a lot place for experimentation, cause there is something you will not believe - hitting button does not win game by itself (unless you are a warrior). You need cards for winning. And, oh boy, We had toads in even shaman, dragons in even paladin, handbuff in Warlock and Paladin. Yeah, you see the most popular builds all the time, but restrictions actually make decks more open for new cards and experimentation.
---
And even before that, Patron and Midrange/Combo Druid were even more powerful than those, as was prenerf Pirate Warrior/Shaman, as well as pre Spirit Claw nerf Shaman. It's hard to compare powerlevel of cards since old decks don't exist in Wild either anymore due to how many times things have been nerfed (it's a meme of how infrequently T5 makes changes, but hearthstone has still had a LOT of nerfs over the years). 
---
Alright, for a complete explanation instead of having parts of it in replies:
---
No, Silverware Golem doesn't have a deathrattle effect. Under any normal conditions, Twilight Calls won't summon him. This bug was reported to HearthSim over a year ago due to a reddit post and they couldn't reproduce it and due to the very unclear picture they had to work with, they assumed it was far more likely to be related to a bug that existed at the time with the sidebar causing a random minion to appear next to unrelated effects. 
---
Through some discussion about Rumble Run shrine interactions, Silverwear Golem was mentioned to have the same GameTags, so decided to check if it would also behave the same way and it did!
---
The key here is that you *have to give Silverware Golem a deathrattle effect through another card*, I used the minion that gives "Deathrattle: Resummon this minion" in this scenario, which enables the Deathrattle tag (so it can display the little skull). So the bug is that an internal tag isn't being properly cleared for cards with InvisibleDeathrattle, causing the dead minion to be considered for resurrection.
---
Then I decided to try to play N'zoth and was actually very surprised to see that he doesn't resummon him as I expected he would. But since this is a bug in the first place, that means that N'zoth's only inconsistency in this situation is that it works properly.
---
If Silverware Golem is given a deathrattle, then bounced back to your hand, [it will show the Deathrattle tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6915139/52116107-5628e980-25de-11e9-989a-b87510f914d1.png)

---
Honestly, even if Equality is still playable -- and I think it will be -- I think it marks a bad direction for hearthstone. Hearthstone needs more good board clears, not fewer.
---
And I don't think it was closing off design space. Actually, I think equality *created* design space -- it made control paladin an option, whereas, without a board clear, no amount of late game bombs will really justify a slow deck, and slow paladin fantasies will forever go unfulfilled.
---

The big numbers are units sold last month, all prices CNY. This is not my screenshot however I checked it myself back then (2 weeks ago) and they were real. However I can't access their shop anymore it seems. Their ebay store was disabled recently too so it might have been something with that.
---
Should we really care about the opinions of players who log in once a year?
---
or just ignore wild.
---
For starters, can we can the idea that the dude who gave us Frost Lich Jaina actually knew what he was doing...?
---
Thanks for your answer! Do you think it is documented somewhere? Everyone has a different opinion on it, and it's not a trivial question..
---
as long as it  didnt mean the addition of a whole new crop of classic cards to fill out the ranks, and the rotations not only rotate out, but back in at a later time, then sure.  
---
Having minions on your side doesn’t mean anything at all. 
---
How did he not win? He should have. 
---
Cold Blood is strong because it constantly threatens to turn shitty minions into real ones, thus prompting wasteful removal against otherwise harmless minions like Firefly. That and the 5/3 on turn two coinflip, an often gamewinning gamble against the opponent's mulligan.
---
Neither can be achieved by Sinister Strike.
---
Card should be changed to "discover a neutral taunt minion"
---
Pretty sure that /u/Jetz72 meant that if you play a charged devilsaur from your hand and then copy it that same turn, the copy also cannot attack heroes.
---
It seems that the warrior card charge's effect should actually read something like "Give a minion charge. If it can only attack due to charge, it cannot attack heroes." and this is a permanent effect.
---
100%.
---
Odd Rogue snowballed a lot of games starting on turn 1 because of Cold Blood and their Hero Power.

Also worth noting - Peter Whalen noted that they are experimenting with more frequent card changes and shaking up the meta, and seeing how the community reacts to those. They've also had some engineering upgrades that makes it much easier to make card changes on the fly (with less patching, etc.)
---
I'm *very* psyched to hear this, I've appreciated all the mid-meta nerfs they've been making this year, and I'm hoping that this means in the future, if something goes abysmally wrong with a card, they can react quickly.
---
no i’m pretty *annoyed at you for being illiterate but acting otherwise*. peace. 
---
I’m from Oce
---
You mean *like this*?
---
Was confusing wording. Removing it from every single archetype is not the goal. Removing it from being a core card in every single archetype but still viable in some was the goal.
---
I can't agree with your solutions, but Hearthstone does need a fundamental change in its rules. 
---
The core problem of Hearthstone is that everyone gets one mana per turn (mostly).
---
This means that the game often becomes what has been referred to as "curvestone". You play the best card you can on the earliest turn possible and you maximize your chance to win. At some points the meta has been pure curvestone, and people were very upset they were making so few meaningful decisions in the game. Just hope you draw cards in the right order and play the best card on each turn.
---
They fixed curvestone by introducing lots of mana cheating cards. Recruit mechanics. Revival mechanics. More insane ramping. Jade was also a way to cheat out way big minions at a low cost. It was all about getting unbalanced stuff that was worth even more than the mana you spent would normally be able to generate. Looking at the game now, this is clearly OP and not so fun.
---
I don't think any cardpool, no matter what the cards are, can solve this fundamental problem. You either have a curvestone meta or you have some bullshit where players cheat cards out above the curve. To fix this, some fundamental change to the core rules of Hearthstone related to mana must be put into effect.
---
That would be weird at the very least.
---
A card that searches for another named card in the opponent's deck rather than general type of card (minion, spell, weapon, etc.) as Cloning Device does. Stuff somewhat like that can exist in other games, but, say, Nobleman of Crossout in Yu-Gi-Oh looks for cards an opponent already played and with Pithing Needle in Magic you name the card.
---
It's not so much that the idea isn't doable, it's just probably too weird. Like, imagine playing a physical card game, and you play with a card that says you need to reveal it to your opponent at the start of the game even before you shuffle your deck and when you do, your opponent has to then reveal a particular named card in their deck if its there. That's just odd.
---
Correction: Iksar has lied out of his teeth that the equality nerf to 4 was unrelated to baku, the rat fuck.
---
Reno was hated at the end of its rotation the same way Baku/Genn are right now. And all cards with restriction reward good deckbuilders. Almost all Even/Odd decks have many ways to build them. We are just seeing most popular ones. Exactly the same as during Reno times.
---
Oh for sure there have been plenty of even stronger decks, was just pointing out some recentish ones in case he hadnt been around for forever.
---
One thing to never expect from Blizzard is admitting a mistake. They have an entire PR department that's a constantly spinning circlejerk echo chamber which relays the same message on a daily basis - we weren't wrong, we just saw things in a different way than we do now.
---
Admitting fault is cancer to modern PR professionals.
---
Simple, the zone cards go to when discarded and the zone cards go to when they die is the same zone. 
---
This is great because it makes the templating of Deathrattle and Discard effects identical.  
---
It gets even better when you consider that Battlecry therefore probably has the same templating too.
---
&gt;Card.isEnteringNewZone(zone).performAction();
---
All deathrattle effects can be templated with zone=graveyard.  All battlecry effects can be templated with zone=battlefield.  Spider Ambush, Mimic Pod, Thistle Tea, Flame Leviathan all template with zone=hand.
---
Is that similar to deck tracker? 
---
I don't think Rexxar has been an issue in wild, though this is obviously subject to personal opinion. If we ever felt the gameplay was a major net negative in Wild we'd consider changing it, that just isn't where the opinion on that topic is right now.

I'm actually really excited for the Brawl they did recently, where you could only use the cards from the four expansions (and not Classic). I'd love to see how that changes their view on the sets and possible future designs.

Hey Blzerlo, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Keep it up! And good on you for buying Alleria
---
I thin it depends how they do the balance changes.  Nerfs that are like "your deck is now just bad and so is anything else in that  class archetype, and you get no dust refunds because we nerfed a basic card" can't be too frequent.
---
The only ramp spell that could ever be considered tempo-negative is wild growth, but that comes down on turn 2 where it does not really matter all that much to lose a turn. Would you rather play a knife juggler or a wild growth? If you answered knife juggler then you're an idiot. As for the other ramp spells:
---
Nourish? Gives you back two full mana crystals the turn you play it.  
---
Darnassus aspirant? Passes the vanilla-test as a 2/3 for 2 mana, does not slow down your tempo in the slightest.
---
Jade blossom? Gives you a 1/1 at the absolute worst and +1/+1 to every following jade card.
---
Greedy sprite? Slightly below curve, but still an okay creature if you consider the ramp aspect of it.
---
Innervate? The definition of a tempo-play, giving up an additional card to ramp out a creature ahead of curve.
---
I don't really see any cards here where you "lose your tempo" by "spending your whole turn ramping". Even if you did lose tempo by playing those cards you can make up the lost tempo on the next turn by having more mana available and from then on you are permanently ahead of your opponent.
---
If you coin out a wild growth it's like you changed from "going second" to "going first". How is that negative tempo again?

equality and flametongue nerfs suck, but this coldblood thing was long overdue, kinda stupid to give this start to  rogues without any real counter most of the time... and hunters deserve every single nerf they get, stupidly dumb and overpowered class...
---
Wow I thought that Warsong was OP but with that new information I can now confidently say it's trash tier
---
I loved that brawl!
---
I want more of it. It was amazing to see what the game was like sans classic. 
---
He talks about Even Shaman (and Odd Rogue) being a powerful deck and uses this as a justification for the Flametongue nerf.  
---
Yet the Data Reaper reports clearly show that Shaman is the least played class in the game (3.7% of decks), and has been in a pretty sorry state for over a year now.
---
Only Shudderwock temporarily boosted Shaman numbers until it got nerfed and that deck didn't even run Flametongue.  
---
Is Even Shaman actually overpowered right now?  
---
It’s 10 face, a 2/2 break the shield, then they 5/x and a 2/2 kill Tyrion, face with the 5/3, the 3/1 and a 2/2
---
Raising health does a really good job for aggro as well though.  If an aggro deck could choose minions with +2 health, they would definitely take it, probably over the +2 attack unless you're face hunter.  
---

Have you defeated the mode with every shrine, or do you have a few favorites that you revisit a lot? I recently started attempting to "100%" the mode by winning with every shrine and am currently at 9/27 complete.

I don't find the a fault.  Its a business decision, QA/developer resources that would be better used on the next set have to be re tasked to this set.  The idea that they are doing this for LOLs in the middle of a healthy meta, instead of prepping for next year's rollout, is ludicrous.

You don't know anything about this industry, you are just a fan.

Right now Shrink Ray may replace Equality as a board "clear". 6mana Wild Pyro + Equality to clear the board still isn't bad. Even 8 mana Equality + Consecration still isn't that bad. It will definitely make the combos much less of a swing though because you can't immediately play your own minions on the empty board.

10 mana 1/1 and still broken

That only really affects one deck though, and only makes them more vulnerable to more aggressive decks.

So they'd work if they were in your opening hand, right? This change, along with making them always in hand pre-mulligan (so that you can choose based on the matchup to throw them back and get a better card, or keep them and have the upgraded hero power) would actually be interesting. Probably terrible, but interesting.
