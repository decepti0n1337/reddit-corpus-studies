yes, after i believe karazhan, they said all future solo content would be free to everyone. now with this one you either have to pay money or buy with gold despite what they said before hand

How long did those animation go lol
---
How did you get a mana cyclone
---
Is there any specific time or is it just find what works for me.
---
Ever since they nerfed offering rates on the most powerful Rogue class cards (miscreant, contract, etc.), less impactful class cards have been disproportionately offered, including jade stuff and most notably jade shuriken. It's not uncommon to be able to draft a decent Rogue deck with an emphasis on jade, and it doesn't hurt that shuriken is already a good arena card.
---
That's already in Whizbang.
---
So is Tekahn!
---
right ? idk why is there so much hate, i just want content, like people have nothing better to do with their time tahn complain about everything ...
---
remove delivery drone from boom

myra's costs 10, evil miscreant has 3 health.

I know right? I always thought HS was being developed by a group of 5 people in a garage who offered you cookies and milk when you agreed to play their game...
---

---
Any physical game with random boosters should also be affected too, no?
---
Ah, a fellow Zetalot viewer.
---
Just realized that this thread is 2 days old... hopefully one of you guys still checks it out.
---
1) With the additional information about the new adventure release, they informed us that the first part is free (most likely similar to how the old adventures were set up). Any idea if that will reduce the price (in gold) for the complete adventure or do we just assume that they added “an extra wing” and still kept the price at 2800.
---
2) I have read that the adventure will come out in waves. Did I read that correctly or is everyone still speculating there?
---
Well, we can always pretend it's Activision or some "bean counters" and the managers of the Hearthstone team have nothing to do with. They are just good guys.
---
Despite what a lot of comments are saying I didn't find myself having a hard time with Mr. Chu. Though I had a lot of armor cards drawn to help me survive until late game. which is when he's pretty strong.
---
Personally I'm having a huge problem with Sephira Dusktalon. I lost the most with her. It seems every single game I've played I get the hero down to where they are just about dead. Fatal next turn, and then they do something that denies it and I find myself the rest of the game unable to get that last little bit of dmg in to their face cuz my opponent is burning all of my cards and of course RNG has to give me the useless ones first for my hand then burn the stuff like swipe....
---
I grasp that there's many permutations within the meta, I'm just talking about what I use, and I fully acknowledge that my build is probably far from the highest min/maxing possible.  It's been an expansion or two since I used it to the point that I'd want to seriously update it, so maybe I'd move along the lines you suggest.
---
Although [[jade idol]] usually means they’re a fatigue deck anyways, barring geist.
---
Can he help me have better luck In  hearthstone?
---
Cool, thanks

No, absolutely not.  Unless you're 100% positive that you would never want to play a deck with Nomi in it.  Like, seeing your deck empty makes your eyes bleed or something.  Nomi is a good and expensive card so you shouldn't disenchant it.
---
Also the heroes.
---
The 2 drops that nets you an elemental.
---
I almost won with him using Boomship and having the evolve skill where it turned one of my minions into Deathwing. I lost, of course, because I was against a rogue player who seemed to have a handful of removals such Vilespine &amp; Execute. Only skills I have found useful for him are Hagatha's &amp; Lazul's. Not much can help him since he apparently has more Brawls than minions in his deck. Good luck.
---
*cries in hex*
---
the problem with blizzard though. They like to make the FIRST style as high quality, then degrade it in quality until they move onto something else. See adventures, then dungeon runs, and this will be next
---
So what’s the best way of going about leveling up heroes, unlocking/earning cards? Or will I need to eventually spend money to build decks?
---
Complete your quests to get gold buy packs.  I use HSreplay and Hearthstone Deck Tracker to see good decks I'm close to finishing, then dust bad cards and make good decks.  I have f2p accounts that can field many meta decks just by doing that.
---
Lol, I got this emoted to me and it hit me a little too hard.
---
Well, yes but no. It being expensive can be the thing that makes it gambling. You cannot label everything that involves chances as gambling. If each pack for example costed 10 cents, you would be able to get everything off of just dust with a reasonable amount of money. In which case people who buy packs are not really gambling. A similar real life example would be McDonalds and happy meals. You get a random toy for less than 50 cents. Even if you want all the toys how much will getting all 5 toys going to cost? No one would consider it gambling, because you can get what people would consider the thing that is wanted for a cheap price.
---
Similar logic applies to dust system. If we got more dust in return, that would also make the game less gamblish. Because the number of packs you needed to buy would be less relevant to collecting all the cards you wanted. A real life example to this would be a real estate company letting you spin a wheel for up to $100 off your first months rent based on a wheel. You are signing a year long lease that costs a shit ton more than that hence the wheel does not really have big implications to what you will pay. If it was up to $10k however now you would consider the expected value of the wheel to the rent you are going to pay when choosing the firm.
---
So being gamble related and predatory business models are very connected to prices etc.
---
Nope. That makes sense to me, thanks!
---
Option 3: get rid of packs and start completely, and make it a Living Card Game model, where you sell the entire set so one purchase gives you every card, and load up on microtransactions for cosmetics such as alternate art cards, alternate voice lines, alternate game boards, alternate card backs, etc.
---
Sounds like this level of butt hurt is just the other side of the coin for those who enjoy trolling.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Oh. Nice.
---
Fair point. I do believe the recent animation is their aim towards a different, younger playerbase but i can see the side appealing to the maturer playerbase to their love of disney style animations.
---
At the end of the day, Blizzard's main revenue source is the older demographic who have the disposable income. But definitely see your point in that definitely something they should consider.
---
Do I need to level up all my heroes to 10? I’m using mage at lvl 11 right now because I had already invested time. Should I start on the others, or is their better ones than others?
---
Am I missing something? 4 attack's always been pretty good against priest? Sure there's attack reduction + Cabal but that's a pretty fringe case in arena?
---
If only. Would be a dream come true.
---
Anything that is below $15 that does not give you a whole game.
---
No, you aim for the highest rank, rank 25!
---
Best way to get cards (without paying) is just playing and doing quests. Every 3 wins you get 10 gold, couple that with quests that can net you anywhere between 30-100 gold. 
---
I also find the best way to learn is also by playing online. You’ll get stomped sometimes sure but it’s the best way to learn how the game works on a strategic level. 
---
Do tavern brawls also. They give you a free classic pack on your first win (classic cards will never go out of rotation which is good when starting out).
---
Chiming in to point out that the third strongest class right now (Hunter) also has an insanely strong evergreen set that often flies under the radar when talking about the similarly powerful Warrior and Rogue classic sets. Hunter has about half its evergreen cards in 10 percent of decks or more, while Rogue has about 7 cards that dominate its decks but has mostly trash cards in the evergreen.
---
Money is higher value
---
So what’s the point of leveling up heroes? I’m using a lvl 11 mage because it’s what I had available to use. Should I start leveling up another hero? 
---
What the tavern brawl? Thanks again, I appreciate it.
---
I love old people who blame video games for everything.
---
A lot of dlc are below $15. Also arguably if a game has dlc and is priced under $15 from a sale or naturally it could be something sold to you that doesnt have the whole game. Plus you can still get around it with premium currency. You dont sell the currency for under $15 and then sell items for smaller divisions of the premium currency. 
---
Your definition can easily be circumvented with current practices and can make very reasonable practices illegal.
---
Mech hunter isn't really that crazy to play against unless you're warrior or some other really slow deck though right? Like, we have a lot of warriors because of rogues prominence. So, there is a lot of mech hunter to beat out the warrior decks. Less rogues due to nerfs means less warriors, which in turn may mean less mech hunter. You can't be sure. Plus, mech hunter loses to token druid, Murlocs, and zoo. There are so many different variables.
---
&gt;And Pay-To-Win Microtransactions  
---
So I guess then the cosmetic micro transactions would indeed be safe.
---
The most cost effective way is to use in-game gold because then you're getting it for $0 instead of $20.  If the only thing you care about is packs then just buy packs and skip the adventure altogether.
---
Treespeaker druid rn, or OTK Shaman. What feels bad is I haven't been experimenting because you literally can't experiment anywhere
---

---

---
Or just players who find it more fun to play HS in a chill with more weird combo decks, rather than push to R5+ and play against exclusively meta decks
---
Thats a lot of light, anduin
---
I'm relatively new as well, but I would think the best option is to save and invest your dust in 1-3 cheap decks that are good (like zoo, midrange hunter, etc.). When I get quests for classes I don't have a good deck in, I either reroll or see if the tavern brawl is a mode where you can choose a class.
---
I know, what I meant was that I dont want to disenchant them and then unbox a non golden version of the same card.
---
Thanks hunterace! I opened my 18 packs and got 2 legendaries!
---
First and foremost: It’s going to be a lot of fun. Try out dungeon run, especially if you’re new to it. It will be like, but better!
---
Second: You get a 12 pack value, and golden classic, as well as 2 card backs.
---
Three: Fun!
---
-.-
---
man im just makin a shitpost after playing 10 rogues then going to casual to go against 3 more
---
&gt; So it's literally just Whizbang 2.0?
---
Yes it is literally exactly what they told us he was going to be.
---
Thekal
---
Right, people also routinely forget that just because something is hypothetically valuable, that doesn’t mean it’s cash.
---
Say you’ve got a card that retails for $10. You can’t just walk into a game store and exchange it for $10. The store will expect to make money on re-selling it and will offer you maybe $5. Or you can try your luck and sell it yourself on eBay for the full value. Easy enough to do with 1 card at a reasonably big value, but a box of 1000 rares that *maybe* retail for $1 each is basically a nightmare. No ones going to be interested in your big box of jank, so you’d have to sell them individually which simply isn’t worth the effort. A store might buy them as a lot, but again won’t offer anywhere near retail.
---
I usually play decks that have won by turn eight, so yeah, go ahead, increase the turn limit.
---
Apologies, I am a bit confused still...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I get 12 packs for completing all the solo adventures? I started the "Jumgle Rumble" (sorry forgot name) one and got to the 7th (out of 8) boss 3x and died.
---
Blizzard wanted to show that they are open to the idea of reverting a nerf by moving a card to the Hall of Fame, but haven't done it since.
---
Yep only hunter, mage and warlock have damaging hero powers without help from other cards. Priest can do it but they need auchenai or the other things
---
I usually let the RNG gods decide. First class  legendary I open is what I build around.
---
I feel like Blizzard is going to far charging money for additional chapters. LIke people dont pay enough already for packs. I know it was a boardroom decision because they have investors to please, but just how greedy do they have to friggin be?!
---
How do I get a legendary? Don’t believe I’m come across one yet
---
most of them give you a cardback if you beat them.  if you're not interested in that, then no reason.
---
This minor quibble would have been largely irrelevant if if you had been paying better attention because we already knew the wings could be bought with gold.
---
But not double giant, like thekal can do.
---
Not from a death knight.

AH, thank you. It is less lucrative than Arena, so to F2Pers like me it makes me think "wtf why would I do this am I taking crazy pills?" But for nonF2Pers, $20 for 15 packs and worst case scenario 1900 dust is quite good. Well have fun yall, count me out.

We're always complaining that we want there to be more expansion events, spreading the expansion out 8s one way of doing that.
---
I don't see any reason why single player needs to be released the same time as new cards.
---
I'm trying to think of the cards you need for wild even shaman that you would not have.
---
[[Devolve]] (rare)
---
[[Maelstrom Portal]] (rare)
---
[[Thing from Below]] (rare)
---
[[Crackle]] (common)
---
[[Totem Golem]] (common)
---
I think those are needed, which is about 760 dust.
---
And then most even lists also run the jade removals so like
---
[[Jade Lightning]] (common) [[Jade Claws]] (rare)
---
But honestly these are pretty replaceable, I think you'd do fine with Stormforged Axe and Hex, for instance.
---
If you had all the legendaries from standard Even Shaman, you're probably set on legendaries (the one I was running was this one: https://hearthstone-decks.net/even-corpsetaker-shaman-5-legend-omtylpupxnanyxg/ which uses mostly legendaries that were used in the old standard Even Shaman--Lich King, Hagatha, Al'akir.  Aya's only good with other Jade cards, so she can be swapped out for a Fire Elemental or something).

You can find garrosh in some versions of [[Dead Man's Hand]] warrior in wild. It's useful to activate stuff like all the [[Execute]] and [[Sleep with the Fishes]] (if you run it) you might shuffle into your deck. Also good vs decks like odd paladin and token druid probably.

5/4/5 | Inspire: Add a random spell to your hand.  
---
They were open about this from the start, both that the single player would come a month later and that it would be released in segments. You might disagree with this release schedule, but it wasn’t ”dropped”.
---
Also, only buy one at a time, maybe you get the legendary in your third pack and you wasted money on the other seven
---
Token druid in wild? lol. Thats why Im keeping him, but all of this expansion ive been spamming standard zoo lock to get my golden portrait. Hopefully ill try it out at some point.

9/9/7 | Deathrattle: Replace your hero with Ragnaros the Firelord.  
---
Yeah it’s pretty crazy right?
---
Fun fact: in Italian they called them **Paolo** and **Dino**, which are legitimate names and together sounds like **Paladino** (paladin).
---
I guess they could have called them **Paul** and **Dean** even in English.
---
Can I open this new legendary from rise of the shadows pack after it has been added?
---
Since you mention variety and creativity, have you considered Arena? Might be what you’re looking for.
---
Man, Aluneth card back might get my lazy a** to do the heroic adventure for the first time. 
---
It would be even better if it whispered to the player from time to time (just copy-paste WoW quotes)
---
I can attest to that but any mode blizzard makes would get infested by people trying to win. Best to just roll with the punches if you’re trying to make it work
---
Huh? Kinda sucks for those that crafted Whizbang, that and does this have custom cards or just premade decks?
---
Feeling real dumb rn for spending 3000 dust on a zoo deck
---
I play this deck all the time and managed to get to rank 8 so far.
---
And I almost love every singe game of it.
---
There are many versions of the deck tho.
---
A lot of people here believe that the team pricing Hearthstone is friendly and will put player happiness over profit, or value it just as much. Blizzard is actually very cutthroat and calculating with Hearthstone pricing. A lot of what they do is manipulative, like the pricing and timing of this adventure.
---
Apparently I'm not allowed to wish for something more entertaining without it instantly being whining. Speaking of overdone tropes, assuming OP just lost a game when he makes a post...that's the biggest fucking assumption on this entire sub. Oh a person makes a comment about the game...obvious rager is obvious...that's the comment 90% of the time.
---
Winning against net decks over and over is just as frustrating/boring as losing to them, so not sure why you have such hard on for wanting to paint me as a rager. I'll stop making fun of people for being 12 if you stop assuming ever post is a rager, deal?
---
[deleted]
---
the biggest noob mistake probably is to completely rely on Nomi while grave horror carries a lot of games with a big board swing and actually seance on grave horror - if you get like 3-4 grave horrors against any aggro/midrange deck it most likely is GG  
---
also the best use of mass hysteria can sometimes be difficult to calculate and the fact that you only want to play cleric in a very limited scenarios on turn 1 (which goes against a lot of the playstyles priest decks in the past had) and use it has a draw engine instead
---
I do play as much arena as possible. It's a considerably more enjoyable format. I wish the drafting made decks with a bit more consistent synergy but overall it's a fun mode.

Nox didn't work for me (You device is not supported), tried BlueStack with Galaxy8 profile. Worked like magic!
---
That is absolutely correct. It would be most economically wise to save some of the Gold you use to buy Packs earlier in the Expansion.
---
I see however, how you may want to play the game with the newest content instantly, instead of waiting for 1,5 months.
---
All I'm saying is: If you really want to purchase this with Gold, it should be absolutely possible, even if you are low on resources right now.
---
you would have known if you could actually read
---
i refuse to dust any golden card. I got golden betrug. So i play plot twist lock. I got golden warlock quest so i played discard quest lock every expansion until this one
---
But no adventure, then.
---
If you want packs, buy packs. If you want the adventure, you pay 2800 for it AND 15 packs AND golden classic card pack AND a promo golden legendary.

I went face with DIG DAY and CC'd it into TWO KING KRUSH'S. I had an 8-damage fireball in hand granting a total of 36 total damage in one turn. Absolutely insane luck

10 mana boom would matter for sure. By turn 7 they typically still have enough health to just jam boom for 0 impact while behind on board, then they win board super easily turns 8-9 and on 10 they refill with assembly. If boom would be 10 mana, they have a much tougher time fighting for board turns 8 &amp; 9 (no rush), and might even run out of steam because they need to play something else on turn 7. There's also no way then to play boom =&gt; shieldslam in one turn or boom =&gt; hero power. Since you can't be boom before turn 10, you can play assembly on 10 only if you don't play boom that turn, meaning you'd still need to spend an entire turn playing boom before you can use rush on those mechs you got off assembly. That's awefully slow, better off playing boom on 10 and then assembly on 11. So essentially by boom being 10 mana you're also pushing their refill turn back by 1.   
---
Problem is that they probably don't want to change the mana cost (7/7 meme)
---
If you go to the store and try to buy packs, you can spend $20 on 15 packs and $10 on 7 packs.  Where are you seeing a better deal on packs than those?
---
If 50 people like the post in under an hour and its literally a picture of the most famous hearthstone player then I would say its "Related to Hearthstone" it was literally under the Fluff tag anyways.

Getting 3 of the packs regardless and the legendary isn't playable in a traditional sense.

So is it a sort of whizzbang?
---
Pretty hard to check without losing your win condition when you are facing a board like that and you have ran out of saps. Maybe the 2-1 pirate with charge.
---
Except all of the solo content they have put out after the adventure change has been sub-par at best. Nickel and dimming you on top of lazy half baked content.
---
When the unavoidable nerfs to Rogue &amp; Warrior happen, I just hope goblin bomb will be hit as well, or else we will go from a Rogue shitshow towards a Hunter shitshow (again!!). I'm just tired of these Rogue then Hunter aggro metas.
---
Don’t... They are both great cards in Wild.
---
I mean, that's true with a lot of decks. Tempo rogue's winrate is surely also being brought down by bad plays and bad tech choices

George and Karl are referenced a few times in the game. They're a pair of paladins who got [[Lost in the Jungle]] while exploring Un'Goro. They were freed by someone wielding [[Vinecleaver]]. Then they returned as a boss in K&amp;C. Now, this tavern brawl features Karl as playable, for the first time without George, who is presumed dead.

40 dust is the minimum dust per pack,  not the average...

I run Crowley in my bomb warrior. He doesn't survive often enough to go face, but he's definitely nice to have. He's pretty good removal and then becomes a threat they have to clear.
---
I don’t think things ever work out well for anyone who picks Mr chu
---
...THIS IS NOT HOW YOU COLLECT FOR WILD.
---
Oh yeah I knew Pick was from RoS, I just wasn’t sure Party was from Rastakhan or something else. 
---
I didn’t play much during the post round 2 nerfs pre RoS though, so I can’t say, but I don’t think Kingsbane Rogue saw too much competitive play since I was still checking Hsreplay stats.
---
100% disagree, this is the perfect time for the release.
---
A month ago we saw an entire rotation and big changes to arena. Now that it's been a month and that novelty is wearing off, having this to turn to now is great. 
---
Blizzard uses the drip feed model in WoW for new content and it typically works pretty well. Spaces out the content.
---
Chu can win vs Ivan if you never draw your minions and use your secret portion of the deck that does nothing vs Chu
---
Owners of a tag team card that the AI drooled all over and never used properly.
---
I got Crowley but I don't use him. In this meta I find a Spellbreaker more important. But it all comes down to personal preference.
---
The whole crux of this discussion is that control warrior is keeping rogue in check, which is an entirely false statement. And as you have so succinctly stated, it is indeed bomb warrior that's the counter. and not control warrior. The grindy control warrior is not going to beat the current standard rogue list that will be prevalent across all ranks of play.
---
Your argument that it's not applicable to all ranks of play is just that, argumentative just for the sake of being argumentative. The current trend across most ranks of play is to tech Nomi in rogue. There's always this trickle down effect of top legend decklists. Besides, having a discussion based on suboptimal decklists that are prevalent only in lower ranks of plays and asking for nerfs based on that is just counter productive.
---
P.S. Bomb warrior is separate archetype as stated in the Vs article, with its own strengths and weaknesses.
---
Interesting, i'd compare it to [[Forest Guide]], which also doesn't really see play in mill druid (i think).

---
The content they are releasing now looks long and fun though, something they couldn't do when it was a bottleneck to unlocking cards in the mode most people care about. They did something simian with frozen throne where the few legendary wad given for beating only one round in a super easy fight so the rest of us could get on with our loves. No one wants to spend time developing content people are going 5o view as a chore.
---
Occasionally asking the questions of, "What would a Druid deck look like with weak or entirely without Ramp effects," or, "Can Tempo Mage work without something quite like Mana Myrm," and so on are questions worth asking from a game design perspective.

That is one thing I feel MtG could actually use now and again, but with the highly solidified color identities, it is very hard to do.
---
I love this weapon in Tempo/Midrange Warrior decks. I really do not like the Elysiana fagigue battles, but Warrior has been my favourite class since 2014 so I play a more Tempo oriented Bomb Warrior list without reactive/value cards like Brawl, Shield Slam, Omega Assembly and instead play Frothing Berserkers, Armorsmiths, Battle Rage and one copy of Sul'Thraze for some surpise face damage to finish people off alongside bombs. It works surprisingly well because people waste their Oozes and Harrison Jones on Wrenchcallibur so Sul'Thraze is free to do 16 face damage.
---
No. What we had was hearthstone precons that required you playing ai eith convoluted rules in order to unlock your cards. It was a chore.
---
Favorite expansion since KFT. Loving it.
---
Shows how broken it is*; they had to make the rest of the deck unplayable to keep Mr chu balanced with such an Armor gain powerhouse
---
for kingsbane it was bit to good for standard really, but then they did a super quik nerf that destroyed multiple cards (ramp,chain gangs buff synergies instead of shudderowkc who is a big design limiter really,leeching instead of raiding). 
---
it was gonna be pretty high tier most likly but due super quik and super bad nerfs (imo atleast i found the nerf wave of that the worst by far theyve ever done escpially in recent ones)
---
Definitely not as popular as jade, because that's the better druid archetype, but it's still there.
---
Token druid and mech Hunter are good decks to rank up and conjurs mage is really fun imo I run a dragon variation of it and I love it
---
I dont really enjoy rogue so that is not the issue. Plus ctrl warr has close to a 50% win rate with just about every popular deck right now.
---
I just dont find 10-15 minutes of removing each other's minions and using armor up fun then to both drop ely and then whoever gets better rng picks for cards to drop determines the winner.
---
Esp when your trying to rise on ladder and you have a 20 minute game. Win or lose thats just way too long
---
In no way are those cards dead in matchups where you don't need the combo since especially Boomship is a great tool to close a game against board based decks.
---
I got weasel of maestron... was fun as hell
---

"I'M TELLING MOM!"
---
I think it would bring the power level just a bit down, but yeah. It just isn't fun to play against warrior right now. Is it even fun to play warrior? I'm not sure to see the appeal.
---
Yes! I do almost the same thing! I run the improve morale card that gets you a lackey though.
---
It needs a damage nerf not a typing change.
---
It was rare 10 days ago when I started using it.  Now I run into it quite often, even in Legend ranks.
---
Dealing 5 dmg is enough
---
Hmm, i’ll try your deck then, thanks!!
---
If the issues is with how many of them can be played in a game, then wouldn't it make sense to instead deal with Omega Assembly?
---
What do you mulligan for?
---
Time for my favorite game! Guess who just lost a game to Myra!
---
The references in german are also always top notch. 
---
It amazes me how much work they put into this.

---
Which one? All hints and Gags and changed.
---
Hey, I didn't even report the post.  I'm just letting OP know for future reference.
---
And he's a stag
---
That’s a good call. I might end up crafting Hagatha if I start seeing more success with this deck. I think linecracker is a good add if I didn’t have al'akir the windlord.
---
Can someone explain this post and it's comments to me , I don't understand anything.
---
&gt; has never hit legend
---
&gt; aggro too easy to grind to legend with
---
Ok, so current control decks have very little potential for misplay due to Elysiana being a card. In aggro games, if you misplay your mistakes have a way bigger impact due to the shorter nature of the games. One bad mulligan, or one bad trade/go-face decision can end you, while with control since you see way more of your deck, both mulligan mistakes and play mistakes mean less.
---
That's awesome
---
If never seen her either 
---
Dame there good at there job
---
How do I assign a flare?
---
Serves you right for being a BMing POS. People like you are the cancer of the HS community and I hope you lose every single game to come.
---
Why is there no card reveal discussion on competitivehs? /s
---
His biceps have a 6-pack
---
Still don't understand how it works honestly. Is it for adventures only or...
---
Candle + Togg is busted. Ivan with Lazul will outlast anything with good tempo and George with Boom is crazy hard to stop.
---
I agree somewhat however zuljin is pretty much just a spell. What I will say is that there needs to be more hero cards like jaraxxus. Jaraxxus has downsides of playing it while every other hero card just seems like a win condition and super good. Zuljin was one they did pretty alright I think  as its basically just a yogg but hagatha and  boom have severe problems of being extremely strong. Like newer hero cards should have downsides and maybe not even give armor at all. Jaraxxus sets you to 15 hp which can be good if you are under 15 but you still cant heal past 15 and it costs a shit ton of mana which means you have to play it on curve already where as hagatha has a board clear, zuljin can have a board clear depending on spells and boom gives 7 armor.
---
Under the title you see "share save hide give award" etc, one of those should be flair
---
Below the post title and options there's one that says "assign flair". You choose whatever suits better and accept it!
---
I've reached turn limit for the first time yesterday.  
---
I play control/elemental battlecry shaman with Elysiana &amp; Shudderwock when get frustrated with all the aggro decks, 9/10 times when I use it I get queued vs warrior with her.  
---
What do you know, yesterday Elysiana decided to give me two more Shudderwocks . . . after 45 minutes we both lost.  
---
I play custom meme decks once at rank 5.
---
Sixception
---
Van Cleef at least has a trade off of spending cards to become big.  While the high roll moments on turn 2 may seem nuts, he requires decent draw RNG to be good early, and if countered with silence, brawl, sap, freeze trap, etc. then the Rogue is very far behind in tempo and value.
---
Thank you.
---
Imagine, a hand full of golden Lorewalker Cho's!
---
You disconnected.
---
Isn't there an OTK Hunter deck now with Jepetto Joybuzz, Alex and Maly?  
---
But yes, you're quite right, OTK has been nerfed heavily and there are anti-OTK cards right now with Saboteur and Hecklebot if OTK starts to take over the meta again.
---
He kinda sounds like Adam Sandler
---
I love Tess rogue, but is almost an auto loss against rogues.
---
Token Druid is too easy to tech against to do well at the upper ranks. When it got popular a few weeks ago decks started tossing in Mossy Horror, Fan of Knives, Abomination, and Baron Geddon which all really mess with that decks gameplan. It's doing fine at lower ranks right now since there's more deck diversity and even when decks get popular, players at lower ranks are less likely to tech against it. The deck isn't really a huge factor in Ranks 10-Legend.
---
I'm loving their personalities, Blizzard did a great job with this entire thing
---
KIngsbane Rogue begs to differ.
---
Nah, took is right in context
---
One of my 3 go to movies of all time.
---

---
it should be unique and different from Whizbang
---
So it's like 30% winrate, cool shit
---
Does anyone play arena on mobile? Seems I’m getting recked on mobile since I don’t have heartharena and as far as I know there’s no way to get draft help on mobile?
---
I beat the evolve character with chu, pretty easily actually. You load up on bombs until you transition to full control warrior with the boom hero
---
Sorry about yesterday.
---
If you haven't traded yet I'm available now for the rest of the evening.
---
Myra wrecks Vex. Her curve is better, she can trigger deathrattles with her hero power, and she gets all of Vex's benefits.
---
You might be right; I'm just lucky to like never ever meet Kingsbane Rogue on ladder so I just forgot about it. 
---
I suspect that Big Priest just folds to it, so it should be together with Tempo Mage?
---

But.... there's 5?
---
Yep I meant Volatile Elemental. I just got the name confused because of his voiceline.
---
Play ressurect/wall priest and just beat all the hunters and rogue! Then curse warriors. Wait. That doesnt help
---
oh and that's nothing, you don't get the "free" legendary until you complete all 5 wings
---
Hagatha got less THICC
---
The reason why i replied to this comment rather than my own comment is because I'm going with the joke and saying that it could be a loophole
---
&gt; Wait time will become meaningless once it launches
---
Not true at all. By now many people probably have the cards they want, so there will be people who don't play the single player at all because there's no need to pay for them for packs
---
Here's the explanation: An OTK means that your opponent has no chance for counter play. Therefor cost reduction set ups count because your opponent can't undo the cost reduction. The closest you're going to get to counterplay on an OTK are things like \[\[Dirty Rat\]\] or \[\[Unseen Saboteur\]\] If you have to leave something on the board and hope they don't do something to it, that's not an OTK.
---
ah, but in decklists was he a sleeper
---
^(this is the real question)
---
Popular streamers manage to win most of the time, but rng does get the better if them. I'd suggest watching a few videos on YouTube. Maybe not all the cards are the same, but new cards can replace others that got nerfed

I found the druid, rogue, and paladin player. #fuckdruid
---
Khadgar is fine, he was made to combo with power of creation which is 8 mana. 
---
Im glad you arent one of the people that want to nerf Edwin. Miscreant needs less health, he is too much for tempo. Brawl is fine. Dr. Boom not fine. Prep needs to stay, plus HoF rotations happen at year rotations so haha. 
---
If these changes happened then combo would rule the meta once again and we would have people complaining to HoF malygos again. 
---
Raiding party and waggle pick are super strong those should be focused on and not the classic set like everyone thinks. Hunter is also fine as is. Why the frick would you want to nerf hagatha what did she ever do to you? 
---
Not every class needs nerfs
---
What which one did you end up picking? They all seem meh
---
Hunter runs venomizer and spider bomb and taunts don't event count as a speed bump form them. Rogues use Sap, and by the time taunts start coming online you're low enough that they can kill you from hand. It just doesn't work.
---
News flash Brian doesnt work for blizzard
---
Since you were so upfront in the op... /s
---
It heavily depends on how many packs you've opened from RoS. If you opened 0 packs, then it's more like a "break even" thing.
---
The value drops significantly if you already opened ~70 packs of RoS compared to spending the gold on the next expansion because extra cards mean less dust than cards you do not own.
---
I won't buy it. Considering the overall quality of Blizzard games, I think I can't do better on Steam. I'm already saving gold for the next set.
---
That data includes all rank. However, the truth is token Druid crush bad warriors, but once in higher level, will get absolutely crushed by warrior, not exaggerating 80%
---
when you get 0-3 because Yogg-Saron insists on casting DOOM on a full board and drawing you to death
---
On Togwaggle's pile of Dalarans
---
Best solo player content, its a shame that it is down in the same menue like boomsday, rastakhan and other stuff.... it demands a button in the main menue!
---
Omg didn't notice the ancestral healing at first, thought it'd be left with 1 hp.
---
I'm at work rn I wanna play hearth so bad now lol
---
Hall of Fame inductions are not going to happen outside of the start of a new year. I am not taking that recommendation seriously as if it were to be made to Wild only during the one period of time it would be, Raiding Party, the card Preparation is enabling, would be moving out of Standard at the same time.
---
In that example hand I gave you, Shadowstep really wouldn't be doing you a whole lot, and I was just listing off cards I knew Tempo Rogue plays since I don't personally use the deck. Sorry about that minor slip. Imagine I said Captain Greenskin while you have no weapon equipped instead of Hench Clan Burgler if that makes you feel better.
---
...I'm missing some context here.
---
If someone bought ~70 RoS packs already, extra packs are essentially dust + random garbage epics + maybe 1 semi-random legendary.
---
Burglar is a pirate and is used with raiding party along side deckhand. Shadowstep leeroy, si7, miscreant, toggwaggle, edwin, nomi are all strong plays
---
Shut up idiot
---
According to VS, deck is pretty much 50/50 against rogue and warrior, only slightly favorable against mage and hunter. There is really no reason to play a 50/50 deck when you can play the 4 classes mentioned above for much more favorable matchups.
---
&gt;An OTK means that your opponent has no chance for counter play
---
That's not an explanation, that's the argument. There's no reason why this comes out of the term "one turn kill". There's never an explanation *why* leaving minions and hoping they survive isn't good enough for an OTK. 
---
I also find that it's often very horribly phrased, to the point that it's either inconsistent (where cards like dirty rat would invalidate it, or setup like thaurissan isn't accounted for), or doesn't actually fit with what the people themselves consider an OTK.
---
I have a suspicion as to why people think this way, but they never mention it themselves. It's the OTK decks: there have never been OTK decks that rely on minions sticking around, because such an OTK is too inconsistent. People confuse killing your opponent in one turn with the combo's that OTK decks pull off.
---
You also shitpost while driving I see
---
Dont forget the acornbearer on turn 1!
---
I don't.
---
I don't want to die.
---
She be thicc,
---
hit like bricc,
---
but most important,
---
She teach tricc.
---
That's kind of the point of control decks, they're heavily etched against aggro. The matchup is bad for you because warriors have access to so many clears and Dr. Boom provides a ton of value.
---
To answer your question, there's no real tech card choices though you should take bigger risks. You'll never win the long game so you have to go all in early sometimes even if it means playing into board clears. If they don't have an answer, you punish them hard.
---
Why are you still getting downvoted? You're a good sport about it and it's not some evil act. Reddit is pathetic sometimes lol
---
"Undataker" and a terrible gnoll-ish guy iirc, but they sorta count as dust, just a little less liquid. Once I need dust, they're gone. HS team doesn't make enough good cards, so they are surviving.
---
Why do you run upgrade?
---
Wrenchcalibur
---
And I went 12-0 as warrior with 30 wisps in my deck the other day
---
So what happens with those extra bombs then?
---
Aka the omnislash crew lol
---
Why do people use can openers to open a can when they can use a rock and butter knife?
---
There plan is too obvious
---
Greetings, traveler.
---
Eh I find that the khadgar and the 8 mana spell/7 mana bird + mountain giant package is too much for me to handle.
---
It's not an argument, it is an explanation. If what you are saying counts as an OTK, then literally everything is an OTK.
---
We’ll take Dalaran and PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!
---
Best league of villains villain tbh
---
Warriors players be like "fuck warrior too" the mirror is a pain in the ass.
---
...I guess apparently I didn't vote.
---
rip
---
&gt;literally everything
---
Only if "literally everything" means going from an opponent at full HP to a dead opponent before their turn starts.

They pop up periodically when Tempo Rogue is a heavily played thing. Basically they get you one minion ahead on board in the mirror.
---
PEAK RAGNAROS
---
He has been saying it for the last couple of expansion now. If it does happen it is not because of Brian Kibler.
---
Convincing Infiltrator is reallt good in this match up. Dont be afraid to waste a seance on one to get an extra kill. You can't afford to drop Cat on T8 and you cant wait till t10 for her. 
---
Also Vargoth+PW:replicate is CRAZY. 17/21 in stats for 9 mana is as good as khadgar+power of creation. The mage cant cast 4 polys in one turn. So it get into the rez pool as well
---
Good meme
---
Be sure to mark it as spoiler though
---
*Let me change your mind*
---
It's the adventure.
---
How are you supposed to beat druid and warlock zoo with rogue? I mean I'm rank 3 and got rank 1 last season, mainly because I am good VS other rogues... I would be legend EZ if it wasn't losing to random classes.
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/126/murloc-shaman#tab=similar
---
Look at these, look at what cards are used. I'd sort by winrate too and look at the top page only. As you can see most of the Legendaries aren't needed at all although they do offer cool possibilities. Hsreplay is pretty much the way to know what is good, realtime stats of all decks so you know that what you are crafting is worth it.
---
i mean rogue still wins so ...
---
Uh, 1.1k sounds pretty good, could use some super cheap learning deck. Thanks, isn’t that deck from his video, where he made a f2p deck and went to legend with it?
---
This meta has been the most trash meta ever. EVERY top decks NEVER run out of cards. SO MUCH fucking card generation what even is the point of 30 card decks anymore?
---
It's a pretty even matchup. You can fill the board more often than they can clear it, so Warrior kinda relies on getting value from Dynomatic and the like. Which can easily be played around. Just take a slightly greedier mulligan and learn how to not overextend into removal.
---
In his video he only went to rank 13 I believe, as for the stream I don't know but his video didn't show after 19 straight wins
---
It's true I've done it. Especially because I'm missing toggwaggle so I have elysiana in there to turn long games wacky
---
Just to point out, I’m playing token Druid (I know shame me) I just climbed from rank 9 to 5 with very little loses. No one is teching against it anymore.
---
Nice, thank you, I checked a deck from tempostorm, it got me thinking about murlocs, i’ll look in to these decks
---
High rank should also have better Token Druids that don't overextend.
---
For Druid, I went Jades with the double Battlecry treasure. Mage took the longest for me, I constantly reset until I got double Robe of the Magi (+3 spell damage) and always went for the spell buckets, grabbing things like Fireball, Arcane Missiles, Cinderstorm etc.
---
I think for Warrior I went for big minions with the Scepter of Summoning (minions that cost 5+ mana now cost 5) and recruit cards.
---
For Warlock I went with Scepter of Summoning and Molten Giants. That made them an easy turn 4 16 damage minions.
---
For Priest I went all in on C'thun card buckets. That and the double battlecry treasures won me my games many times, as well as saving me from a quick loss.
---
For Paladin I went double Captured Flag, which gives me a 2 cost 3/3 minion every turn, unless I got the Justicar's Ring, which makes it 2 1-cost 2/2 minions.
---
SMORK?
---
The symmetry!
---
Oh ok, I guess i’m booting up my pc to check this deck out
---
&gt; Go ahead and play venomizer. Holy smite shadow word pain and mass hysteria say hi.
---
Who plays venomizer naked? You magnetize it. Infiltrator is good, but sucks when the opponent goles wide with small critters, guess who plays explodinator and replicating menace. Wall priest is a cute deck, but in the current meta is just a couple notches under viable.
---
Personally I'd go with Jaina's emotes, tbh.
---
I am having some success versus Rogue as a Hunter by playing the Secret version who included the lifesteal rush beast.
---
He used an emote programmed into the game intentionally, stop being overly sensitive.
---
Do not kill anyone, please.
---
Get used to rock paper scissors it's been around for ever and blizzard doesn't seem to care as they want classes to have specific strengths.
---
That is bad play. The promising way is all in and pray no clear.  Hard to fight warrior in a long game.  Once you hit turn 10, you basically can’t win.
---
I wish. My mulligans hate so much that I always have mark of the loa :/
---
I think he is trying to say it would still replace your hero but work like the more recent Hero cards and just provide 5 armor instead of setting your health to 15.
---
Laughs in murloc
---
Ok, but what do you mean by higher level?  Go look at ViciousSyndicate level 4 to Legend.  Also, OP is almost certainly part of the "All Rank" category of people...
---
They dropped the ball with the Taiwanese players recently, but in the past they *have* given out one year bans even for “only” win trading (Naiman etc.).
---
And the somewhat late ban from GM for Roger and Reall is pretty big too.
---
Lol but Rank 5 - Legend shows Lackey rogue with 38% representation so you're wrong.
---
WHAT
---
He means the aspect that jaraxxus lacks compared to other hero cards. Jaraxxus sets you to 15 health and caps it at 15 health. Every other hero card doesn't do anything to your health except give you some armor. So if you were at 10 health with a Max health of 30 and play hagatha, you are still 10 health, max 30, with 5 armor on top.
---
Me too xD, marvel right?
---
He must want to play a game that isn’t HearthStone ladder. 
---
Maybe casual is is more his thing. There’s people branching out all the time there. 
---
If you play on ladder, you play to win with tools available. Believe me, if I had the missing pieces for that deck, I’d be playing it too.
---
Would be left with 2 hp, there's only 10 attack on the board.
---
Hunter in February had a 40% representation in Legend - Rank 5.
---
He's talking about the freeze mana cost being applied to the respawn value
---
For Mage? Pretty much. With the spell damage treasure, even the boss that summons troggs/draws cards whenever you cast a spell isn't too hard because every blizzard, dragons fury and flamestrike is a board clear.
---
I have golden valeera yet i'm not playing lackey rogue because there is no skill or satisfaction in playing what is definitively the best, nor do I want to play mirrors all day. 
---
summed up? im not a degenerate
---
"Makes no sense to HS players"
---
I'm sorry but the very basics of MTG is known to the vast majority of HS players. If you don't you're either less than 15 years old or have lived under a rock all your life. 
---
I don't know enough about MTG anymore to post on MTG sub, I'm hoping to get feedback from HS players that know the basics of MTG considering I'm talking about basically playing Hearthstone with physical MTG cards.
---
Boy exactly bright are you
---
that's a nice looking donut
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/7/token-druid#tab=matchups  
---
token druid has 47.9% winrate against control warrior and 53.6% winrate against bomb warrior. idk why so many wannabe experts are vomitting ignorance when the stats are readily available.  
---
you have 2 wispering woods and 2 forest's aid (4 with twinspell). they have 2 brawls and 2 warpaths.   
---
mulligan for acornbearer, wispering woods and the forest's aid and it's not really that difficult to put up more wide boards than they have the clears to deal with.
---
It's a genius plan. No, It's a me, MARIO!
---
I'd put 2 Dire Frenzies instead of the extra copies of Snipe and Rat Trap.
---
If you Dire Frenzy pretty much anything but hopefully Wyvern (and than Dire Frenzy again when you Zul'Jin) you outvalue Warrior.
---
Having an 8/8 rush minion for 5 is hard to counter, even with Omega Balance and you may have 12 of those on your deck (2 dire frenzies + 2 Zul'Jin dire frenzies)
---
It’s the greatest card game I’ve ever played, so I am biased toward a yes on this one.
---
Not a bug, its a timing issue with magnetic
---
This is kind of nonsense. You may want to read on case of Alex Bertoncini. Wizards may only go harsh on cheaters just recently, because of how blown out was this situation. But they are still far from "teaching others on how to deal with cheaters".
---
If MTG had a proper mobile game I'd probably be playing that instead.
---
I mean... it’s no artifact kappa
---
Firebat and RDU both utilized it at the Hall of Heroes tournament last week. Firebat made the Finals with it and got a lot of people talking about using Wisps in Tempo Rogue. Since then, Firebat and several other streamers have been trying it out on ladder. Not too sure if any were doing it on stream before then, but it's possible.
---
I feel most alive when rapidly approaching my death!
---
From what this sub says and my experience, causal is filled with tier 1 decks
---
I don't understand how you can say Wizards didn't handle their cheater problem better than hearthstone, but hey.
---
Honestly I have no clue, there's a reason why I'm not a contributor in r/customhearthstone and it's not because I dislike the subreddit
---
CCG.  I'd imagine Poker beats it a million to 1.
---
And backstab from every tempo rogue (I play it, so I would know).
---
That’s ok, control warrior always has eternium rover on turn one, same principle
---
You didn't save a single brawl? some warriors do take Nomi.
---
If you play wild: yes.
---
Do you like to keep collection: yes.
---
I reckon those are the reasons to keep the wild cards.
---
Get 3 Bombs in a Row and you win nothing
---
No, it obviously is a 0 222222 murloc /s
---
Priest: Greetings Dickface
---
Anyone realize her art is really low res for some reason? It may just be a mobile issue but it's really blurry for me
---
Then they're not worth keeping for you. Disenchant them as you need the dust.
---
God I miss Futurama so much. :(
---
I seen ControlTheBoard do that.
---
He usually plays wild, but played some standard tournament the other day with rogue that included wisps.
---
I had one. Brawled the first board. Could not handle the second.
---
Lol right? I only get the urge to play Hearthstone on my phone once every two weeks or so, and I open up the app to find this. And then I'm done. My motivation is shot.
---
I know, doesn’t really make much sense either, I would go to the local Dunkin in a heartbeat for some donuts and packs
