---
Same problem here.
---
First of all, i don't know either should i be amazed or shocked of how much bugs you guys can produce in the past few weeks.
---
Second, i was 11-0 before you disabled the mode so i hope we will get some compensation for all this hustle. Since some players did get rewards and most of us didn't either because of bug or you disabling it. That is just not fair. (Plus some people spent their gold on it)
---
I also want to say that i too, still can't play the brawl, since it's still bugged for me.
---
Welp mech warper and snip snap seems unbeatable
---
Odd. I just play fairly and haven’t had an issue in 6 years. You should try that instead of sticking to pve
---
That's just not true-maly druid can beat nzoth, and a bunch of decks can beat nzoth since they rush you down before you develop a bunch of deathattles. Also nzoth is so much fairer than priest killing you on turn 5/ out of control secretkeeper etc
---
Only to be defeated by a divine shield taunt poison murlocks that are 1/2
---
so now you can use wild cards? fun...
---
what about snip snap? your druid deck looks slower than that. I would say the warlock one too.
---
OP was kind enough to provide me info that allowed me to take a look at the account action. I will not publicly disclose what was discussed with OP, but I will say that the issue is considered to be resolved.

Same problem here

To ensure battlegrounds are a success, at least enough to warrant further investment by those who hold the purse strings.  The folks in charge of allocating resources won't be able to parse out that the simultaneous dip in standard and eager adoption of battlegrounds is being fueled in part by a shitty standard meta.  
---
Would make sense for devs to do this, because from their perspective they know the game needs to grow and expand into new modes, and probably had to fight tooth and nail just to get higher-ups to approve this experiment.  If it were anything less than a success the brass might be heavily inclined to push the stale three expacs a year cycle and simply blame devs for "bad game design" as the player base continues to decline.  I'm not a huge fan of battlegrounds, but i hope it's a hit, because I want further game modes.
---
Looks like almost everyone in this subreddit was 11-0 before they disabled it (:
---
I dont understand why that would get him banned.
---
I wonder who the artist for Bob was.
---
I had ten wins, which I **paid** for the privilege of obtaining. Didn’t get to finish. Give me compensation.
---
I was 3-1 and haven't been able to log into TB since yesterday morning.
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^.
---
Replace shiv with patches as it's a better card draw
---
For those who don't understand:
---
Regular Deathrattle x1
---
Rivendare Deathrattle x2
---
= 3 deathrattles
---
If there was a "hell of a lot of luck", then players like TidesOfTime wouldn't be able to consistently place top 3 basically every game
---
Summoning portal?  I would beat this deck every single game.
---
Displayed rating isn't actually the matchmaking rating used for matchmaking.
---
Lucky you then lol
---
Controversial.
---
And then 50 years later they would start lewding punctuation marks and making body pillows with them. No thx
---
This is fake as trump.
---
I'm familiar with how similar systems **actually** but here in hearthstone everything is opaque because the devs don't give us any information.  A good system like SC2 would reevaluate me and put me through a new set of placement matches if I suddenly won a lot of games in a row. This system will not. This means if you genuinely had no idea what you were doing a week ago, but now you do, good luck ever getting to an equilibrium point where you are correctly rated.  If I'm winning 80% of my games (that is,. Top 4 minimum) then I'm definitely not correctly rated yet.  And apparently I haven't been for at least the last 50 matches I've played.  That's a broken system.  That's not how this **should** work.
---
So is he still banned or what.
---
It's pirate warrior though.
---
Its literally all luck. You are given random minions of random power levels who randomly attack random opponents. Yes there are ways to make it more consistent but ... Cmon now.
---
FAKE NEWS!
---
I guess his brother played 60 Sn1p Sn4ps in a single turn.

---
here's a hug big guy.

Wow that's super degenerate. How did I forget about it?

I just played Radiant Elemental, Topsy Turvy and PW Shield, and despite winning 3/3 of my games, I feel like a fool for playing it now.

My issue is more that OP wrote to Blizzard looking for more info and got his ticket closed with a copy/paste response and no helpful info. Then he makes a reddit post and gets a human blizzard employee to offer up info and reverse the ban within hours. Doesn't seem right.
---
Now that he's super banned, I hope he tells us what he did.
---
Don't get me wrong, it feels like you guys just didn't want people earning quick (somewhat arena) packs and rewards
---
If skill doesn’t equal winning then Tides should have just as many losses as he does wins. Except that’s not reality. There’s a skill involved, just not what you’d like it to be currently
---
By faster he means your initial run of games. The more wins you get in your first 15ish games the more mmr. After that it starts to level off. I’ve played over 100 games and just hit 5k. I didn’t start out well.
---
*says the dude on reddit*
---
Same for shifter zerus
---
&gt;Sounds like
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Look, we only have two pieces of information:
---
  
---
OP claims he isn't a cheater. But that's not really evidence is it? It doesn't prove anything.  
---
There is literally a CSR in this thread that says, yup, OP fucking broke the TOS.  
---
Sounds like OP is a lying piece of shit to me. But ultimately, why should we even be involved? This is between OP and Blizz. There's literally nothing we can do and no way to tell if he's lying. Posts like these are fucking pointless and 99% of the time it turns out the OP is a fucking liar and a cheater.
---
I dunno, this looks like a Dragon comp to me. I hear they're pretty strong right now.
---
My tavern brawl is still bugged. [This](http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1573782019301.png) is what I see when I go to the tavern brawl. I cannot even retire or start a new game.
---
I didn't realize how yoked Bob is
---
Does Lazul’s snake have a name?
---
I was 0-1 before it broke, but it would still be nice to get a pack or whatever the reward was.
---
BEHOLD!!
---
Same cant find match but I cant even retire
---
Thanks, great response

Poker is a game where you get random cards playing against random opponents at the table who also have random cards, then a few more random cards are dealt from the deck and you have to guess which random cards your opponent may have been dealt. A lot of luck involved there, yet I have a feeling you'd get stomped by Phil Helmuth. Games of luck can still involve a lot of skill, so to say "it's literally all luck" is pretty fucking dumb. Even within a game with many random elements, there are still enough decisions being made by the player that skill becomes a fairly significant factor when you average out the results of many games.
---
Yes, the initial Brawl was giving the same reward as the Arena rewards.
---
it’s a shared card pool only a certain amount of each card in the whole game split by all players
---
Not condescending at all you're just sensitive if you think you can play a mode for a few hours over 2 days and expect to understand everything about it. If anything you are condescending for thinking that is possible. I've been watching streamers who play for 4-5 hours per day for the last 10 days saying the same thing. Sorry you are mad.
---
The RNG detects your theme and gives you the opposite. So you swap cause hey a Pogo.
---
Surprise
---
No more pogo
---
So you have 13 top 4 finishes. That is such a tiny sample of games.
---
Yea but gwent sucks
---
****
---
Same. 4-1 (lost in a mirror match) with my rogue deck. Can't retire, can't play. Really sucks.
---
But dude, don't you know...
---
He felt a sense of pride when he completed his ticket and hit enter , the following 24 hours were in terms of stress , equivalent of pacing back and for in the waiting area while my wife was giving birth to our first child .
---
Thanks for the tip! Patches + Evolve = instant concede from opponent, easy pack.
---
I've been so confused by that ..... How are the logos hitting 50+? Just buying every pogo that appears in the shop?
---
You attacked with all of the Patches but your opponent has 30 health? Sure man.
---
Your whole post is pretty silly - claiming buffs don't matter by it being countered by a... Buffed amalgam. The entire BG is buff based. Every game is just buffing your tribe with maybe 1 or 2 support or incremental types like hyena or junkbot. Each tribe plays almost the same - THAT'S the problem.  
---
There are four unique tribes but all four have the same inherent playstyle - buff minions with (something) of their own tribe. The whole point is that the tribe really doesn't matter, because you do the same thing with each one. Buff. My issue is one of variety, not of balance. Mechs are already the strongest class to a pretty absurd degree, and the fact you haven't realized that means you probably need to play more games yourself.
---
Why do we accept this from private companies when *habeas corpus* is the most fundamental tenet of the public justice system?
---
I know the answer is "private companies can decide who uses their service", but *why* is that the law? Why do we give legal protection to one-sided contracts that allow the effective seizure of (digital) property with no recourse or even transparency?
---
If companies want absolute authority over a virtual domain, they should be held to the same standards as the government institutions that have those powers over the physical domain.
---
This was what i intended this post to mean but it turned into a guilty/not guilty show .
---
Try playing mechs every game and see how far you get :)
---
Some people think Pirate Warrior takes skill.
---
Just go face.
---
Because almost every game I've played I see the same comments. Blizzard has said they'll adjust the uncertainty, so maybe they see an issue, or maybe they're just trying to respond to all complaints because the game is in a bad spot PR-wise right now. 
---
I know you see it as you're DEFINITELY correct and I'm refusing to be wrong, but I really don't see a clear issue and only hear a few anecdotal stories here and there. We have almost no data, there's nothing to "admit".
---
Depends what you mean by "not that hard". I've hit Legend many times. I don't consider it particularly difficult, but I'm decent at the game. For most people it's out of reach. 
---
&gt;you can hit legend with whatever deck
---
Nope.
---
Why the store? Do you mean the App Store?
---
f2p btw
---
Tripling up pogo, double battlecry if shudderwock, brann, etc. But yeah buy every pogo in the shop
---
I understand your point, but I disagree for one simple point. I spent more than 100 hours watching/lurking on battlegrounds streams waiting for a drop than never came. During that time, amaz was 6k thjis was near 6k, Kripp was up there as well, and so was savjtz. So when I got access today, I started at 4K like everyone else and am immediately 2k below the “pro/established players”. 
---
Additionally We are in a position where people know what is good and therefore the games are automatically more difficult than when the streamers and pre-orders started, because we don’t have the luxury of “exploring and learning”. If the idea is for fairness/competitive integrity there should definitely be a reset. They could even just wait for the end of the year to reset, because great players will rise organically and you’re not stymying the growth of new players who could possibly be great players. And I’m not advocating for a monthly reset or anything like that, just a fresh reset when it’s officially released, and then maybe a yearly reset in order to make sure the top players are consistently playing and not just players who got so high that other players just can’t reach them.
---
Shamanstone is already problematic in the 1st week and they just let the meta ROT like that??!!!
---
Remember this when the next time Blizzard acts cute and pretend to communicate with the player base suring pre-release AMA.
---
Actually more people are playing muilt tribe buff boards that are often more successful.
---
Same :(... ı just want my reward for my wins as i am really going to 12 win you locked me out at 8. I am ok with 8 wins though :(
---
Nah, neither is good late anyway so you just wanna take advantage of the cheaper HP to fill out some curves. Patches is winnable.
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
yay santa hat!
---
"Tin foil hat" is a bullshit excuse.  How many times have we seen threads were people were banned with no reason, no opportunity to appeal, and thousands of dollars in the whole, only for them to come to Reddit, make their defense, and suddenly "Hey guys!! Got in contact with an admin and they looked over my account and I got unbanned!  Thanks!"
---
If your system means innocent people are getting fucked out of thousands of dollars, then it's a shit system.
---
I mean, if they have mech warper, you probably ban it and make them have to spend 9 mana to drop a 6/9.
---
Thanks for your personal information, nerd. Expect your bank account to be drained tomorrow.
---
Patches isn't weaker than Rag though, it's just different. There's no clear consensus on which is better (but there's some consensus that they're both quite bad). Tides rates Patches higher than Rag.
---
Malganis (Sorry, I forget how to spell it)
---
Also, when the demons are sold, I believe they return to the pool.
---
*WE SAID SO
---
I was thinking that it would be great if there were an equal amount of time in recruiting round, but there would also be a button "ready". So if everybody is ready, then you won't need to just wait sometimes a whole minute in the late game
---
Yes
---
See how glicko(which is why most games use) works
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system
---
**Glicko rating system**
---
The Glicko rating system and Glicko-2 rating system are methods for assessing a player's strength in games of skill, such as chess and Go. It was invented by Mark Glickman as an improvement of the Elo rating system, and initially intended for the primary use as a chess rating system. Glickman's principal contribution to measurement is "ratings reliability", called RD, for ratings deviation.
---
Both Glicko and Glicko-2 rating systems are under public domain and found implemented on game servers online (like Pokémon Showdown, Lichess, Free Internet Chess Server, Chess.com, Online Go Server (OGS), Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Dota Underlords, Guild Wars 2, Splatoon 2, and Dominion Online), and competitive programming competitions.

Yeah, better to randomly assume it's like much different games and spread misinformation. Now this BS is gonna keep popping up.
---
Bans PW shield.
---
Yeah wtf? My deck from the other day is showing up with 4/3 cards in the deck. Chalkboard is still bugged too.
---
cry some more
---
It really depends on the faction you're going for. If you're doing mechs for example, a golden junkbot could be the only gold you need, for demons the one that gains hp based on your hero's lost hp.
---
It's not about making the deck. It's about knowing exactly the kind of degenerate aggro nonsense that will be literally every deck.
---
I just did a beast Daryl run and had so much fun. I was inspired by Kripp's video and it helped me a ton... Early game just stockpiled alleycats and tidehunters, then got a 6/6 hyena and 8/8 rat pack on like turn 5, then from there just kept buying garbage and selling it to buff remaining good stuff. My triple hyena started at 22/22 and it was pretty much game from there. The funny part was I kept finishing matches with just the hyena left, so eventually it got down to 4 people and I just kept doing 7 damage at a time over and over lol
---
Ooo, neat
---
you've triggered my trap card, I play Time out/Crystology/Mogu Cultist
---
Tides has said several times on streams that he suffers diagnosed insomnia, but you are still right about the problem of people trying to replicate streamers like tides.
---
It is skippable! Just enter and the concede button changes to "skip tutorial"
---
Actually I am a little surprised, because if they do play the game, then they'd know about all the issues and imbalance we face every expansion. Yet things go unchanged for months or left until the next expansion to fix.
---
Dont know if people often try to level to tier 5 early despite being low on units.
---
It's just tempo mech wars now.
---
Preordered yes but refunded. Still have packs tho and can buy new preorder
---
You gotta watch him play. There's way too much to go over but a big thing is how aggressive the higher tiers re. IMO tides will prioritize early game power for late game scaling. That's probably why he puts dancing Daryl, not late game heroes like nef or george, as S tier. He even rates Yogg over Nef.  
---
He's still not playing optimally as he doesn't take notes on opposing boards and messes up occasionally. But he does a lot of minor things well.
---
Oh crap really? Deleting this post then lol
---
The onerous of truth is on you dude, not them.
---
This seems to be a 'problem' in every online game I have ever played, yet in decades of gaming I have never once been banned from a game ever and nor has anyone I know personally.  This seems to suggest to me that not only are most of the people who post 'wrongly banned' posts outright lying, but even those that end up getting unbanned are usually not telling the whole story and have partaken in some irregular activity.
---
I bet you’ll lose the packs from the first preorder
---
Whats the mindset behind that? "I don't want to build a deck on my own?"
---
I vastly prefer building my own decks over playing with random stuff.
---
It's simple...
---
Don't make me kill you!
---
minions are people too! they are my precious children that I send into needless violence and death.
---
Again, nobody is talking about the significance of in-game variance to your rank over a large number of games. The comment you initially replied to was referring to luck/variance in a single game, you just misunderstood and decided to argue with a straw man. It was very entertaining, now please go learn how to read :D
---
It's only one tier up (they would need 3 tiers for megasaur).
---
Your battery level is giving me anxiety.
---
Here are a few videos from streamers playing Deryl in the past 36 hours or so:
---
- [Dekkster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnO0a42y8e8)
---
- [Kripp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQGKmbltb4s)
---
- [Amaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFyGfkZkM2M). Direct link to [dance turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFyGfkZkM2M)t=275) (this was a pretty insane turn)
---
Was really fun to watch and it blew my mind a bit how it could be utilised. I definitely won't pick him much though since I don't have enough APM for normal heroes as is!
---
No, the implication was that Tides attained his rank thanks to "a lot of luck", which is nonsense.
---
There's no luck whatsoever regarding placements and ranking over a large enough sample size of games. You absolute moron.
---
Only change I would make to it is if you magnetize a minion, it has summon fatigue.
---
Would have made Mech Hunter way less oppressive.

---
That’s at leas three cards more than I can be bothered with.
---
Is it like a mtg draft where you can deny other people from getting cards?
---
No it wasn’t lol, the implicit AND explicit message was that getting stomped by a 56/56 pogo or a full demon build with all the key pieces required your opponent to be lucky and hit the pieces. It doesn’t invalidate their skill, just acknowledges that luck plays a part. If there was no luck then you would be able to get a 56/56 pogo every game, since there is no opponent interaction when it comes to your team comp. Clearly this isn’t the case, so again I encourage you to go learn how to read instead of arguing points no one is disputing.
---
Lmao, mate please explain your logic instead of just insulting. It's debate 101 in the public school system, usually taught quite early even
---
It’s really good art. I wonder how they’ll use the card for battlegrounds! If only someone in this thread could potentially hint at such a thing - and perhaps create a healthy hype by doing so? 👀👀
---
Did anyone ever see that Jade art when it was in standard? It’s so cool looking but so hard to get to.
---
What turn can that deck pop? It seems susceptible to Druid Patches deck.
---
The shifter doesnt count as the triple golden until you play it. If thats what you're asking. Which is annoying as hell at time vut i can see why they have done it.
---
For the record, what exactly did you DO that could have resulted in the ban?
---
You basically have to go mech or beast to win, demons just dont carry well to late game without a golden reaver early and snipe amalgams where you can. Then if other people get good taverns and snipe all the junkbots, hyenas, great wolfs, mama bears before you you are basically dead in the water.
---
Thx
---
Underlords has actual alliances to play with (not just +stats), the 'option' of going for combining an additional tier of unit or going wider (the meta is stale towards going wide but that's getting fixed) and heroes that can be built in different directions.
---
Hearthstone misses all of that and so get's stale quicker. That's the problem with 'simplifying' games. They get boring quickly because the permutations are much lower.
---
That board gets annihliated by most late game boards in my experience. It's a decent mid game comp, but it rarely can close games out.
---
1 mana 1/1 pirate that gives you a 1/3 weapon. patches and captain. you are welcomed
---
GvG and TGT have to cost the same as long as the dust in them is worth as much as the dust from SoU or DoD.
---
Did you see the other post of an upcoming tier 5 Murloc card to bridge the 4-6 gap? Battlecry and Deathrattle: Give your other Murlocs +2/+2.
---
I went silence, Ancient Watcher, Arcane Watcher. I can silence mine or yours!
---
Yeah didn’t fight anyone who had mass dispel as one of their 3 cards...
---
Actually demon are quite decent if you have a good strategy
---
Cheaters never win - "Bye - Bye"
---
I think that's the dancing murloc pet aka Murky from wow (also the white murloc is also a color variant of the same dancing pet).
---
On this note all I'm going to say is that we need a Murky vs Daryl dance off expansion to happen after descend of dragons

This brawl is great because the matches last like a minute and you can clear those “play 3 games as” quests in like 5 minutes.

I don't want to disappoint you...

Just tell me i can handle it :)

His amalgam does not combine with the normal amalgams though

But you haven't completed the 5 games of the month...

I think there needs to be a minimum shop time at the very least, or a larger minimum shop time if there isn't one already. 
---
You shouldn't ever be punished for having a long fight.
---
What cards did he have?
---
Which is good because you want to spread the stats to not get destroyed by poison.
---
You realize you’re talking to the lead game designer, yes?

IT LOOKS LIKE A BATTLERATTLE!!?!?!?!?!??!111
---
Blood Knight as a 6 cost. It might be too extreme still, but I like the idea of having cards to counter strategies in different ways than randomly silencing a minion.
---
Haha accurate
---
This gets absolutely destroyed by my killer Barnes, Deathwing Dragonlord, Biology Project deck. Every time deathwing is naturalized you just draw more which are instantly put into play.
---
Instead of togs scheme I had spirit of the shark in case my opponent didn’t concede on turn 2
---
Can someone explain the joke pls I don't play on mobile
---
They need to add the 1/1 reborn murloc along side mega fin at 6 with the same battle cry before murlocs become viable for high ranks for all heroes imo
---
There's a ton of reasons, but the clearest is that it stops the argument of "That wasn't me who did that bad thing, it was my brother!"
---
Then of course there's dozens of other more nuanced issues, like that it's not okay for one person is Legend and one person who is Rank 15 to share an account and lead to games of alternating stomps around Rank 8.
---
The purpose of starting at the start is that it allows you to fluidly shop right away, since you aren't able to spectate others' fight.
---
What about patches, mech warped, sn1p-sn4p?
---
I have seen murlocs do well with early game heros but I agree that I have rarely seen them get 1st place (if ever).
---
I won every time with it (fatigue)
---
This was a big long text of nothing. Very vague and seems to be trying to pander more into emotions than giving any real detail and information.
---
Well when you look at the amount of players a game has and the amount of people you know personally in a game is so small and insignificant. You cant really draw an opinion for that pool because in fact its so small. So claiming people are out right lying or not telling the whole story is very short sighted of you. 
---
Also this is much more common in larger scaled games. People can get banned from addon's that don't break the ToS but get triggered with an update, Authentication server bug out's, a macro that was once allowed is now being flagged. Automatically assuming everyone is lying is what gives these companies the power to keep shitty customer service.
---
Also the fact that Blizzard-Activision is the company that it is, dosnt make me question this person at all.
---
Weirdgus#2403 EU Trade , I can show if you want, you go first! 
---
Multiple successful trades on reddit thank you!
---
It's possible to go hardcore on a game in periods and have a healthy life otherwise, just looks at some of the WoW Method players lol
---
Kangor summoning a Sky Golem and a Sneeds can ruin someone's day as well
---
How is Jaraxxus so low? His hero power is what got me my first 1st place finish and i've only played 4 times.
---
What did I just read ?
---
AFK isn’t bad, you’ve probably just not played her very well.

Subliminal messaging at its finest. "Play HEARTHSTONE Modes"
---
Why?
---
So many bugs lately, they've clearly but the "C" team on basic hearthstone management.
---
People still cant use the internet in 2019.. oh god..
---
Fool! It's the only minion in an entire third of the deck!
---
Well arent you special
---
So many bugs lately, they've clearly put the "C" team on basic hearthstone management.
---
He's right though. The more weight luck has, the more variance results will have.
---
If good players can win consistently it means there isn't that much variance and hence luck isn't all that important.
---
One issue is that trackers will soon handle the remembering part for you
---
Had my first match on mobile, I almost never finished buying minions before the timer hit 0, it got so bad that the last 2/3 matches lagged so much that I skipped the inn fase entirely, even if that was probably because of my shitte phone
---
Lich King should be D. Reborn on deathrattle minion doesn't cut it, it's just extremely weak.
---
Patches should be B IMO. Great for top4, bad for top spot.
---
THE ZANCIENT ONE
---
Meanwhile, I’m over here incapable of retiring/playing my deck and the Tavern Brawl will likely expire before the devs can fix the issue... thanks Blizztard
---
While we’re on the subject of issues. There is this login reward that we get when we login from 13 Nov to 27 Nov. I have done so numerous times, but no reward. Am I missing something?
---
It's 3 cards and there is already a pretty clear cut top tier.
---
I find it weird that there are Dragon buff cards, but only the Nightmare Amalgam can be used for them. It really makes the Amalgam OP for its cost. The difference between getting one and not in a Menagerie setup is insane.
---
Fun Deck but will not win\^\^
---
Keep up the momentum... Keep it right up to madness!
---
What's crazier?  
---
Seeing people posting this several times a day.
---
Here is the official page explaining what it is:
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23156373
---
You can also just play it in game and it does a tutorial the first time you play it.
---
DEMONS! They suck the soul out of mortal beings! Apply directly to the forehead!
---
No you don't.
---
Evolve Shaman needs no nurf.
---
They would've had to make  certain minions immune to poison for it to be balanced. Or have minions that punish the opponent for getting poison (killing them triggers a 4 damage death rattle).
---
OMG this.  The thing I love most about battle grounds is that it is fast. I have how other people rope every turn and have wanted a "speed mode" of some sort for ages (ideally a mode with no animations and a turn timer of 30 seconds every turn, but battle grounds will do).
---
Not sure, 4-6 times usually?
---
&gt;his effect makes a board full of minions rotate around until the music stops (stopping randomly).
---
God, please, no.
---
Zalae hung dong 🍆 to free hong kong 🆓
---
Y'all got any mech powers? Cos mechs are OP, all my first place/top 3 wins are mech, if I try anything else I generally come last or near to last, usually dying to... mech.
---
Foe reaper is the most OP card
---
Heroes that buff anything other than mechs just encourage you to go non-mech, so you will lose. 
---
TLDR: Mechs
---
Yeah, this is my opinion.  Granted, I've probably only played 6-7 games so far, so I could be waaayy off.  At first the possibilities seemed endless  and awesome.  And after a couple/few games I realized that it's really just a dice roll to see who can get a larger ratio of their preferred tribe on the board (for the most part).  I'm still enjoying it, but that realization has been a bummer.   I haven't even played that many times and I already feel it's 2/3 of the same Beast, Mech or Demon board that I face.
---
But that's my whole you... you'll never not wait after the shop. You can either wait a bit before, and wait a bit after, or you wait a bit more all at once.
---
The 2 reasons why all at once is better is that :
---
1. It rewards the winners for winning faster (and technically rewards A. F. Kay in the second fight for losing faster).
---
2. It allows them to tell you exactly how long you will have to wait, since you're waiting on a timer, rather than waiting on a random fight that you cannot see.
---
Same for me :(
---
With Bartendotron I often just try to rush to 4 to get a Cave Hydra and that alone will often carry me to a top 3, even if I don’t get the full beast package. Other than Patchwerk, there really isn’t anybody who can just straight rush to tavern 4 to get the best picks first, however it is a very luck based strategy, but it seems to work fine most of the time for me.
---
Nice
---
Hopefully they fix it before the end of the brawl...
---
Pogo+shadowstep does it for me. 
---
Handle the patches strategy with betrayal.
---
Mukla should be A and Pyramid should be F-
---
Most of the time, this is true, it's a huge problem on the runescape sub reddit, where people make long winded posts calling out Jagex support for falsely banning them, then a moderator responds saying the ban was valid.
---
ooh are we doing memes, now? Are the mods sleeping?
---
Why? if opponent has minions you are not guaranteed lethal if no armour involved
---
I don't even use the discover reward cards if I have less than 20 seconds to go. Even if the game doesn't end up "choosing" my reward for me I won't have time to play it and usually will end up with gold to spare.
---
Occasionally friends will spectate me with their iPhones or PCs and on average I lose 15-20 seconds thanks to these animations.
---
Kripp said the same aswell. So yeah that seems to be the case
---
That card seems waayyy OP to me.  I've had a couple games where I kept rerolling to get the card.  Once I never did, and the other time I got two of them.  Otherwise, same sort of build/luck.  Guess which one I lost and which one I won?  I feel like that card that buffs when a mech dies shouldn't be included honestly.  That card, and the card that grants beasts +4 attack seem OP to me.  
---
Looks like a fun game though.  I do enjoy games where the final battles are like that one.
---
That's why you have to be lucky 
---
I never said its good or works 100% of the time.
---
People with Boomer APM can relate
---
I'm missing something. What is the 1 mana spell that buffs all the patches to +3/+3?
---
It’s better as a tempo deck
---
I learn more when I don’t concede. This is my first month playing, every moment even at the end teaches me something.
---
Soul Juggler
---
And yeah, there have been times where the game will offer me 2 of them and a random demon and I'll just pivot into them. The nice thing about demons is nobody runs them so you're not competing with other players over pieces.
---
You do you boo
---
When your opponent toys with you, I see it as an opportunity to teach them just how long the turn timer actually is.
---
Mechs are very high roll, and you often have 4 or more players in a match trying to play mech, often making it hard to get specific mechs since they usually get taken by other players. Foe Reaper is insane, but is a tier 6, and Cave Hydra does the same thing at tier 4. I only go up to tier 6 in about 1/4 or 1/5 of my games, so most of the time the only way to get a Foe Reaper is by getting a triple on tier 5 and getting lucky. If you can get an early Pack Leader, Cave Hydra, or Mama Bear, beasts are insane too. Mechs are the most surefire way to win if you can pull it off, but sometimes playing for a consistent top 4 is better than trying to go all-or-nothing on a win. I did put Millificent above Mulka on the tier list even though their hero powers are very similar because I do agree that mechs are often better than beasts or any of the other tribes.

 trading 80g on EU, you go first - ive done many trades in here
---
Kai3333#2637
---
Honestly, the only thing that drives me bonkers is the attack RNG. 
---
For instance, in my last game I had a super strong demon board, he only had one taunt. Dispatched it easily enough, but instead of one-shotting his junk bot while it was still relatively weak (still double digits mind you) my 20+/20+ demons go for his stupid 1/1 mech spawns. I don't get that. I can handle the RNG factor of the draft playstyle, but losing because of mechanics like that just feels bad.
---
why would you say something so controversial yet so brave
---
I'd much rather face this then the druid patches deck.
---
When you purchase a video game, you don't actually purchase the game. You purchase access to their game for a set amount of time. Consider it a rental. When you die, or stop paying a subscription fee, you have to give it back.
---
Yes, it's a money thing, but it's fair. It's also been a thing since ever, and they put it in the contract you sign before purchasing access to the game. The OP is old enough to remember the birth of pirating and why it was considered illegal. He's also old enough to know that you should read a contract before signing it.
---
Don't reroll 60g quests, they will now always end up as a 50g.
---
Don't even know what he said but I upvoted anyways
---
It’s actually probably not doubling imp, Doubling Imp use to actually be in the game but they removed it because it broke the game basically. So I guess unless they change how it works it isn’t coming
---
Or first floor of Ice Citadel, that's way faster
---
Thanks!
---
Lmao. Glad I’m not the only one. 
---
Looks sweet af though. Props to ya.
---
Just found him recently, some of his music is actually so good
---
Looking to trade the 80g quest on NA. I'm happy to play either Standard or Wild. I'll show the quest, you go first. 
---
Volknur#1326
---
Cleave poisonus isn't possible right now and I hope it'll never be
---
Maybe it's cause the people screaming the loudest about it finally left the sub and the rest of us who understand whether or not we play a card game has no impact on HK are tired of comments like this?
---
u2x#21853 EU trading 80g quest.

10/10
---
Opened an Alexstraza which will hopefully find use during the next expansion.
---
So I guess ladders just don't exist anymore...? Time to rename Hearthstone to Battlegrounds and just made ladder a side mode?
---
I’m almost certain selling a golden copy puts three back.
---
Because Snip, Mechwarper, Target Dummy Warlock is utterly broken.
---
Lmao how the fuck did you get to anything over 3 mana in this brawl? Longest I got to was 4 and that's because it was some idiot who filled his board with patches and didnt inculde buff cards
---
You are your hero!
---
Top 4 gets a "win" similar to play mode, 3 for 10g. For rank there's an MMR system and top 4 generally means your MMR will increase, though not always. There aren't any pack rewards to my knowledge (but if anyone reads this and needs to correct me please do so)
---
I mean... why would you play the Goblet?
---
She has the third highest win percentage: https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/7048-innkeeper-now-supports-battlegrounds-top-5-hero
---
Same problem - just delete my run and keep the rewards - I am missing out on a brawl which might be good ROI
---
My goblet runneth over.
---
Ahhh I see
---
Buy it on pc, i don't have the same problem, but i was was unable to buy it at all using gold.
---
I will agree that summoning a 4 cost ending up summoning a 6 star card in Battlegrounds feels very unintuitive.
---
It should be changed to summoning 4 star creatures for Battlegrounds
---
Does the free amalgam form a triple with the one you can purchase?
---
Good job, my best was 118 so far. :)
---
Why moltens and not arcanes?
---
They should make Kabal Crystal Runner a 7 mana 5/5, that would open up for an Odd Secret Mage (without Aluneth).
---
Sounds reasonable except Kabal Crystal Runner. That stat nerf is too harsh.
---
Exactly what a lowlife netdecker would say. I actually get excited when I see Create Deck.  Building competitive decks is challenging and fun, especially in tavern brawls where the rules are different.
---
go away
---
I think it's more because Battlegrounds came out and he was one of the main guys behind it.
---
Game Mode is still in Beta... i am sure there will be quests when it comes out of beta
---
Dream on
---
Uhh, why am I getting downvoted? I genuinely don't know. Was I rude? Did I write in a bad tone? Is my issue irrelevant? Are there too many posts like mine? (Believe it or not, I browse freqiemtly and I didn't see a single one) Did I make lots of grammar mistakes? Did I trigger someone? Am I anti Hong Kong? Did I evolve desert hares?? I'm so lost
---
Well now some games you can play with the mechs and some games you can play with the beasts and then sometimes it’s your turn to be bottom 4!
---
Are you trying to say seppuku?
---
[https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/battlegrounds](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/battlegrounds) You can see all of the Goldens here on the official website, just go to the card you're interested in and check it out. (Sneed's summons two random Legendaries.)
---
No I just went back to the menu
---
Shudderwock + cold light seer is strong late game
---
It's been bugged for a lot of users too. I think it should be fixed over the weekend.
---
Same for me, here's what mine looks like: https://imgur.com/a/vXogBW4
---
I finished 5-3 and it has looked like this since. I don't really care if I don't get rewards or whatever, but would be nice if I could queue brawl again lol.
---
The guy’s comment got deleted. Is that the same person who posts ‘thicc black girl’ on this subreddit on a daily basis?
---
Wait what? Ra is an uncollectable card in standard and mogu isnt in battleground. In neither game can you get Ra off of (i assume conjurers) calling
---
Pretty sure it's based on health before the round. So if 2 players get knocked out in the same round the one with more health before the round will get the higher rank.
---
What was your normal cards to bombs ratio?
