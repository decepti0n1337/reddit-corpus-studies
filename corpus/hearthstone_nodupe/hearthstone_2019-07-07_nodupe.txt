Paladin wasn't in a great place up until the Rise of Mechs card updates. It really doesn't take much to propel a class from the bottom to more than playable. The lowering of two numbers on two cards and SN1P-SN4P were enough.
---

---
The same sort of thing happened between [ONiK](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-09-18) and [MSoG](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-12-18) (when Drakonid Operative was released) for the class three years ago and between [The Boomsday Project](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2018-11-24) and [Rastakhan's Rumble](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2018-12-24) (When Mass Hysteria was released) just last year.
---
The Year of the Mammoth saw set after set of extremely strong Priest support (Shadow Visions and Lyra in Un'Goro, Shadowreaper in KotFT, and Psychic Scream and Duskbreaker in K&amp;C), which helps explain why last year was a relatively weak year for the class. 
---
Taking all of that away did definitely cripple Priest, and, yes, Rise of Shadows didn't instantly fill those hole, instead choosing to support what turned out to be a weak returning archetype. It's just not Priest's time right. Give it a few months.
---
On frost nova, you’re largely right, but looking at the current iteration of cyclone mage games often come down to who has more freeze effects. I don’t think that’s particularly healthy, the can of worms that is conjurers calling notwithstanding.
---
Sorry sir but the word “force” sounds a bit too violent for kids, I’d like for you to come up with something else to replace that word.

Lmao. I'm cringey because you can't afford to spend some money? I like hearthstone. Imma spend my money where I want to. Have you thought about getting a better job or something homie? It might help with your own anger issues.
---
Idk why you are accusing me of anger for making you read more. Is it hard for you or something? Either way, go ahead and hop off my dick about this, and maybe work on getting your own expendable income up to the point that a few hundred bucks a year doesn't break your bank.

Undying Cat comes back immediately wheras Dreadsteed does not. It is essentially a 2 card twisting nether that also kills any deathrattle summons
---
You need 4gbs or more for this to work.
---
yea that works, but i wouldnt say thats the same as removal
---
I'm not the one down voting, but you might as had simply said "Hey. The Classic and Basic sets should be completely revamped now and again. Here's a list of cards I think should not return in such a set," rather than going on a fifteen hundred word essay on how much you hate aggression.
---
It's cool and all, but it is not a big deal
---
Good news! You can now re-roll those quests! kek
---
It's obviously Hearthstone is killed by the new auto battler games(TFT, Dota underlord)
---
Just like RTS games(Starcraft) was killed by MOBA (League,Dota2)
---
Blizzard is always the loser.

Really awesome love League, although unfortunately I only have a phone.

this actually might be a viable strategy since it's so near, I hope OP see this comment.
---
At the same time, Hearthstone isn't the new, hot piece software on the market any more, and actual, quality competition in the Free-to-Play Strategy game market has been showing up in the last couple of years between Auto-chess stuff and MTG: Arena.
---
If Team 5 have to compete to keep Hearthstone as the King of CCGs/Strategy games, that is good for the game.
---
To put more simply, faster and more format adjustments and the recent Rise of Mechs events would not have happened if MTG Arena, Dota Auto Chess, and TFT weren't released.

I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard was testing the reaction for Diablo Immortal to see if it was worth pushing for mobile with Diablo 4.
---
Funny thing is it wasn't like that 1-2 years ago.
---
This is Roffle’s deck, and the only change I made is substituting Finley out for a Stonetusk boar since I didn’t have him. However, the boar is still a good card in the deck.

?
---
Finally free of that blasted little friend.
---
Wtf?
---
Please wait until the double gold fire festival to complete it, it'll be so worth it (and you'll be like the only person to ever acheive it)
---
I'm mostly talking about actual magic the gathering, where alot of the cards can get expensive depending on the format you want to play, like Mana Crypt is around $200 or a little less on it's own, and it's one of the best cards in commander
---
No, magnetizing works as if you're playing a minion and then attaches on. This is expected behavior.
---
From what i heard, the old admin wanted to keep it going but they wouldnt sell the site to him, so he reluctantly made the big announcement that they were closing down. 
---
Then they heard about someone else buying the website and didn't like the news very well. The new owner isn't to blame, its more the decision from Twitch/Curse that's weird.
---
Also, if you're curious, the new owner is the founder of HearthSim, who made Hearthstone Deck Tracker and HSReplay.
---
And so then OP brings across a possible solution to fix his problem?
---
It’s pretty disingenuous to say that he’s just bellyaching about something that is inherent to the genre and can’t be fixed while ignoring his solution that is right there.
---
makes zero sense, the minion is being fused meaning the end result is still 1 minion. seems like an oversight.
---
This is why i never play wild lol
---
Why do you hate priest so much? Having a bad spell doesn't compare to priest having a shitload of bad spells in the name of "Identity" as most cards for this class are unplayable or overcosted for 1 when it should be the other way around. Priest is bad because it doesn't have good ways to get early game stats, middle game is only stats, and late game is mostly spells. That makes weirdly inconsistent decks that don't work most of the time. Healing is not a weapon that can be used most of the time, Auchenai combos "look" good, just because the developers think having a 4+ dead cards and suddenly drawing an Auchenai effect that consumes your hand and leaves you with no cards is a way of winning. Answering a board, without playing anything afterwards is awful tempo. Specially since priest depends so much on getting those answers and other classes just deal problems that win when unsolved against priest.
---
What kind of argument is that? both dota and auto chess used to be (community) mods before - they are clones aswell
---
This is very relatable. I often do the same thing. I have more fun theorycrafting than I do actually playing the game, and the weeks of theorycrafting always ends up just losing to the decks from last expansion. So this is great advice here.
---
You missed the point by a lot. 4/12 would've been the spikeridged paladin buff that went out of standard before the devastator. First it buffed a minion with 2/6 and taunt, and when it died you got another 2/6 taunt. 
---
Its hard to compare cause stealing it with the secret also disrupted 6 mana from the paladin. And not only could you get a total of 4/12 and 2x taunt for 3 mana and 1 card, you also prevented the paladin from getting 4/12 and 2x taunt at the same time. 
---
Against a warrior it can disrupts as little as 1 mana. But its one less removal, usually 1 out of 4, and before turn 10 its often 1 out of 2 of their big removal. So it preemptively sets up a protected turn for giants or other conjurers calling plays next turn, or even a few more turns down the line.
---
So it can still be very powerful and very much worth to pick in a discover sometimes. While other times it would be a dead card or a tempo advantage for your opponent if you play it.
---
Thats why it gets stats like this. Its rarely that good. But when it is, it improves your winrate by a lot. So you gotta pick it based on what situation you're in. You shouldnt start picking it more often just because this chart suggests that it is undervaluated or that it'll improve your winrate more than other picks from the discover effect.
---
Ah I see. Yup, all this has been proven in arena, its amazing there due to lack of silence.
---

You do realize that a very big portion of those 1000 employees are not making a new game right, most of those 1000 employees are trying to make sure Riot servers don’t explode, fixing bugs, and making new skins.

I personally disagree. I think the exciting aspect of watching card games (or any competitive game) is seeing the decisions live, as well as reactions and conversations with chat.

Mtg Arena exists now so you *can* make a competitive decks for free but man is it not easy, the economy is pretty harsh and is getting worse with new updates.

Can confirm.  Rank 5 floor is Warriors. Rank 4 is mages.
---
As far as I know Arena only has Standard in it, which is excluding EDH, Vintage, Legacy, Modern and quite a few other lesser played formats, Standard right now is a toxic pool of things like Izzet, i'm going to stay far far away from Arena.
---
It's spam, they keep posting this vid everywhere with different clickbait titles.
---
Hearthstone is gonna be ResidentSleeper until the big streamers stop playing TFT (if they do), or until the reveals start rolling in.
---
There is literally nothing abnormal about the quantity of expansions being released in this game.....magic has 3 themed expansions as well as a new base set every year and on top of that they release eternal cards in new sets as a way of soaking up even more money.....blizzard is pretty mellow compared to it's competition.
---
The game got bigger and they haven't optimized it
---
They could, but at the same time, Team 5 and Blizzard want people to play Standard as it is the format newer cards will have a serious impact in and does sell cards far more effectively than any seasonal format could. Then there could be a whole issue of selling cards specifically for a format where they're only playable in that format for a couple months out of the year.
---
Wow. Not even close.
---
July = new season. July 8 is today. 5-7 hours since July 1st.
---
Ouch. Right in the feels...
---
Never ever conjuerer's calling your opponent's minion (especially when they are 8 drops...) Unless you're looking for a doomsayer to clear the board, or it's a 10/10 Edwin or 12/12 magnetized galvanizer in mech hunter or mech paladin.
---
Works well on mega magnetized mechs that started as a 1 drop
---
No it’s not. Maybe that’s how *you* play it, but your statement is objectively false.
---
Dota created an entire genre of game, and League is in that genre, as one of its second pioneers.
---
League and Dota are both MOBAs. They are top-down, player versus player battles where you attempt to destroy an enemy base  by systematically destroying towers along three lanes. Each game is controlled in a very similar way, with four main abilities you use to fight ai-controlled minions for domination of the battlefield. Hell, compared to some of the competition, both even have some incredibly similarly-used mechanics, like last hitting and the item shop.  
---
Are they completely alike? Hell no. But they are very similar in a lot of ways.
---
Explanation: I play a 2 Times towagle and pick the "draw 3, they cost 0" i wait until I have all the piece of the combo then I myra. 
---
After that I play Staraligner and then towagle scheme. Next turn I play my 2 tresure and the shark. Total damage :14*4=56
---
Druid is definitely not dominating the meta right now. 
---
It’s pretty much hunter and warrior with some rogues and mages. The rest pop up occasionally. Maybe it’s the rank you’re at.
---
Ok what is happening here omg 😂
---
These are actually pack fillers from SOU
---
The game is shit what did you expect?
---
Thank you very much for censoring that naughty N-word
---
No it wasn’t. They dropped some mechanics, stats and itemization styles to create their own. Str/agi/nit gone and replaced with AD and AP scaling as an example. 
---
Also, their hero design styles were much different than DotA’s. DotA’s terrain/trees can be destroyed, League’s is not. Along with some other things.

Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like
---
Tell me about it. There was some point last week where I went to Twitch and found that everyone I normally watch was playing TFT. I ended up watching Kibler for twenty minutes. I decided that TFT wasn’t for me, and switched over to watch Good Omens, which was a fantastic adaptation.
---
Recall that Dreadsteed had to be nerfed from something more like undying cat.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7RgN9ijwE4
---
I feel like control warrior is the worse thing about this game rn and it has become so stale and boring
---
That quest isn't from the frozen throne era tho right ? I remember that quest during the boomsday period
---
Everyone's talking about Heartstone being dead and I'm sat here looking at Recettear wondering if it's a good game.
---
(I mean it had 4.3k viewers, it must be alright, right?)
---
What where you playing+? If you were going to win trough fatigue damage then a bad elysiana would still win him the game. And that looks like its what happened, since you wouldnt win after he spent 3 turns playing only one minion per turn without much board impact (okey, alex does have impact, but if you were winning then hit face and win right there).
---
If he elysian-ed early (with still a decent amount of cards in his deck) then he was just realicing he was going to lose, and played ti his outs, the only chance he had to win was to ely into something good, and he got it.
---
In both cases, you werent really "winning", and he didnt really need too much luck to win you there. Alex and 3 blaastmasters was lucky, yeah, but im 100% it was just overkill, with half of that he could have enough to win the game.
---
People also talked shit about fortnite and look where it is now. If riot backs it with enough resource, it's not going anymore soon.
---
I feel autobattler genre is the new battle royale and I've heard streamers talk about it, there are a lot more companies developing similar games.
---
Downloading works just fine. Actually playing on the other hand though...
---
Is still remember these from KOFT.
---
Warlock on fire's lines were just great.
---
[ASMR]
---
You mean Malding.
---
No I am pretty sure I remember they added a fourth slit for special quests
---
I add random people and get this a fair bit, it's a good strategy
---
I want this in gold so bad. I play big shaman in both standard and wild and this card gives the deck flavour.
---
Kale is really nice in freeze mage, love playing it for 1 mana.
---
Favourite deck to play- Bomb warrior, there’s something different about playing a deck with a different win condition
---
Least favourite to play against- Pogo rogue, feels like jade Druid all over again.
---
If you are right there should be a at least a Reddit comment somewhere.
---
Still dont know how to initiate chat with stranger in hearthstone
---
The only way this could be better is if you had also used a doomsayer and they got hit by the frozen Rag.

This is one I've been playing with, I'm a bigger fan of the Nozwhisker Espionage combo than Tess, when I used Tess I found it was just dead in hand a lot of the time and wasn't really performing.  I've been testing out Face Collector instead of Double SI:7 and it's been pulling it's weight, especially in the control games but also Vs Tempo you can pull a legendary from another class to turn on cards like Vendetta.
---
Ah yes, thanks
---
I love mage and I know that CC is broken, It’s good even on 4 drops like keysmith. The problem is that CC is the only card that keeps mage alive right now, without that card it’s almost impossible for the class to sustain the value of other classes ( infinite hordes f Murlocs, endless streams of removals, endless lackeys etc etc ). I hope that they release a good ( but balanced ) card in the new expac and then they nerf CC.
---
I still have this quest too thanks for the heads up guys
---
but doesn't the GM's alone have more views than simply a combines total of 4.3? For example, now it has almost 9K views and it's Asia-Pacific region playing
---
Khandoo#1647 Asia    Just need to do the quest.  You don't have to have it

FuZyOn#21198 - I'll go first if your reputation is better than mine, otherwise you go. EU.
---
It works if you add them after.
---
Anything mage right now is annoying as fuck to play against.
---
Love control shaman and tess rogue
---
Can you post your deck list please?
---
I don't know why he said 2. Maybe he was trying to get across that it was a 2 player quest or something idk lol
---
The issue is it will be nearly impossible for new players to enter into it.
---
Two thousand dust is the maximum one needs to upgrade say Murloc Shaman into its Wild incarnation, and, baring card changes, they'll always be able to play it as likely a top competitor in the format.
---
Seasonal would require potentially constant investment, especially if no two adjacent seasons share any sets other than the newest, for someone who missed out say the first handful of expansions.
---
Would it really make sense to say craft a Dr. Boom for a season where GvG is legal specifically for seasonal when GvG is leaving the format in a month and might not be legal in it again for anywhere between six and twelve months?
---
He can't speak neither spanish or english trust me
---
The period right before previews start is inevitably always the lowest point of an expansion excitement-wise. It's also one of the biggest holiday weekends of the year.
---
So, hopefully 1 epic, minimum 1 rare per class; maybe no rares in a particular class, not a single legendary, and a bunch of commons that don't do shit in a card pool of 800. I'm going to go spend $90 on a game just to get these packs asap!

Lol you clearly didn't play against worgen OTK then. All they had to do was lay down pyromancer and acolyte of pain with commanding shout and you'd draw through your entire deck in two turns.
---
At least patron warrior required skill and experience to play it and if misplayed could cause you to lose games.

Of course, it all depend on perspective.

---
I'm glad someone knows exactly how I feel on this one.
---
So much this, having to clear once seems fair but knowing that you have to clean the plate twice is disheartening.
---
I totally agree - Boom's hero powers are totally unconditional, so while they're a little less consistent individually if you're looking for a specific effect, overally they're way, way better. Also, I think most would argue having Rush on your  Mechs is miles better than a 3-damage board clear to all minions.
---
Combine that with the fact Dr Boom is one mana cheaper, and that he gives more armor, and I think it's fairly obvious he's overall better (though don't get me wrong, Hagatha's still a very good card, just not as powerful)
---
I played both as and against it. It was nowhere nearly as insane as Patron and wasn't even considered a tier 1 deck when it was nerfed.
---
As someone playing the game from the very beginning, I don't mind losing against strategies that are either creative or at least allow for some counterplay.
---
Yeah! We focus on the offensive unfairness but CC is broken on defense too. It's way too good in too many situations

Y'know jokes aside as someone who only just recently came to the US I don't get the hate towards GameStop. Sure half the store is merch not games but I actually really like it. I can't think of anywhere in the UK I could have gone to get as much merch as GameStop does. Yes the UK has Game but the ones where I lived had no where near the level of stuff GameStop does.
---
you asked, i answered
---
Favourite:None,unfortunately there's no Deck right now that I truly enjoy playing at least in Standard,Wild has many nice Decks but the sole thought of having to deal with Big Priest makes me stay away from the format...
---
Least Favourite: Control Warrior,that thing makes any kind of slower Deck obsolete because there's no way to outvalue a DK+Omega Assemblies+Elysiana and it's not even bad against Aggro.... Hopefully we'll get some nice Combo/Control tools to deal with it this expansion though...
---
Of all the random bullshit in this brawl you decided to pick on Curse of Weakness?
---
Unless there is something like Academic Espionage for Warlock i doubt it would be a good deck
---
I agree entirely. In some directions money grubbing can be an issue. I haven't played MtG Arena but I played a lot of the physical card game back in the day and I played a lot of the other big card games (Pokemon, Yu gi oh) before settling on Hearthstone. My issue with each of those games is the price, or rotation styles. When you NEED four-of cards to remain viable or when you rotate TOO frequently, or not frequently enough... Long story short my money was going to go to a card game regardless but I've a much more complete Hearthstone collection than I ever got close to playing any other card game and I've sunk WAY less money into it than I have any other card game.

Try to put both stalag and feugen on the board as quick as posible, kill them, then ressumon them over and over, with the normal ressurect spells or the twilight call always giving you both of them (and when they die, they both summon an 11/11). It can normally start rolling the thadiuses at turns 6/7 and with the stalling tools of priest its not very very hard to survive untill you can start comboing.
---
And then, explorer hat hunter, with djini of zephirs, some mechs, play dead, terrorscale stalker, fireworks artificer, and the 2 mana splitting ooze from nax. You put hats into the minions, activate deathrattles to get more hats, when they die they give even more hats, and eventually your hand is full with fucking explorer hats. You can play 2 arcane giants (will be cheap quickly) and if you have, zuljin, for the ultimate hat-madness. Hats from zuljin can go inti opponent minions so be carefull.
---
That is a dumb combo, but I think he did it in the right order for the first one at least? Pyromancer will proc first than a 1/1 will get summoned.
---
Well this is where such reasoning fails to me. 
---
First and foremost, this has nothing to deal with game economical mode. The more a game is played, the more it gest revenue, in one or the other. If a new player comes to HS because of an existing mod, there is a great chance he'll explore the rest. And whatever, attracting people to the game is a win-win trade. That's for the economical model.
---
Second, important point too : player's behavior of min-maxing things is your friend, not your ennemy. Don't refreign yourself from doing something because some might abuse of it :
---
*  They will abuse of it, be sure of that. WIll that kill your game? probably not, because ranked is still the "gotta" of your player accomplishment. Will it increase your income? Certainly, thanks to the influx of people who try it.
---
* To a certain extent, someone creates a mode that is more efficient / more fun / more exciting than your game? Congratulations, you've got a new game mode concept developped by a team of fanatics, at the cost of pushing the technology your developpers have a bit further onto live, this while creating the opportunity to hire the talented and devoted users that developped that great game mode idea (and raise a middle finger to the past yelling : " yes I'm looking at you Dota, I'm not missing this one" :) ). 
---
Third, and last, "revenue loss anxiety" should be put on balance with the reason why you're making games. It's first and foremost to make great games. Generating revenue is a consequence, not the goal. You don't make great games to make a huge income, you make great games because you want to make great games.
---
But its an elemental, which makes it better but still not playable. 
---
P. S. We also have a 2 mana 2/3 beast type too.
---
I'm sold. Brb moving out of my country
---
And if I recall, lifesteal’s retroactive addition was limited. They didn’t change Life Drain because it was a basic card and Wickerflame’s flavor is sort of weird with it. 
---
Even something as vanilla sounding as Elusive is problematic on a card like Tyrantus, flavor-wise, given it’s portrayed as towering stories above the treeline
---
'after this match', i usually just concede right away for these wonderful mate
---
Because most people in the US get shot...
---
Am I hating America properly?
---
As a warlock main I agree. Tap for 2 and get a free card sounds mediocre at best. But 9 more cards to go so who knows.
---
I didn’t even use Murlocs I didn’t know it was viable, but it makes sense in hindsight
---
Harrison actually does kill the weapon twice drawing you double the cards
---
*carousel creaking noises*
---
Yeah somehow I didn’t even know that was a thing at all. I guess I didn’t even have a Reddit account so there was no way I could’ve known
---
Finley seems like a cooler match to Mage and their recent Hero Power mechanics. Reno had sane healing (one-side) effect as new Paladin Dragon Legendary so a new healing interaction would’ve been cool.
---
Huh, fair enough. Thanks for the info.
---
It's still better when you have reno, dk, barnes all at once. It's kinda switch full wastelenad for something that potentionally could be better or not so bd at least. Also they can switch it every 2-3 months and do it manually, like they did with arena.
---
Their main weapons are fear, surprise, Conjurer's Calling and an almost fanatical dedication to the Pope
---
There is a difference between a critique and a criticism. You correctly identified that I gave him a critique. What you failed to grasp is that critiques aren't bad. They are meant to be helpful. If OP actually wants Blizzard to read what they wrote, then a long-form essay won't get the job done.
---
Here's another critique: consider working on your temper.
---
Well maybe if the wild meta wasn’t so oppressive it would have more active players
---
Because this isn't MTG
---
I mean, if that were the case then tyrantus would be a card people intentionally put in their deck. The same goes for fairy dragon or spectral knight or arcane nullifier. Elusive is not very powerful except on volcanosaur memes. I wouldn't mind if it got pushed a little harder, but I can see why the dev team doesn't want to (it's not very interactive per se)

In my case, I had Zola and dusted her which I now regret. Faceless was a solid alternative though.
---
Agree, I played Mech Hunter before Snip Snap and it was pretty good. After Snip Snap, it’s amazing.
---
well i mean ...  
---
you can't really use that point when its now very different than before as its now a dedicated game for riot/dota not fan made and in its own catergory etc..  
---
\- explain your point on content support? because these tournaments seem to be doing well e.g pokimanes own tournament got them to the #1 game with over 200,000  [https://twitter.com/pokimanelol](https://twitter.com/pokimanelol)   
---
\- and you can't really use content and then in the same argument say "its only new" because of course they are  going to get new content/characters (they already have) and actually are doing well with what they have.  
---
\- also TBH hearthstones content is only really a new expansion that lasts 1-2 months for the big numbers.. so i mean... HS isn't really a  good example for that point either yet it did well for years. im sure the same was said for HS especially since it only focuses on standard  
---
\- also " The fact that it took till the last month of RoS to reach this point " isn't that somewhat irrelevant since TFT wasn't out?? if theres not a good game out ofc hs streamers are going to stick to the game with the viewers. not to mention i disagree with that point besides the kripp/thijs/tournament numbers  
---
\-so many big HS streamers wouldn't have been so eager to leave it if it was in a good place.  
---
\-lastly my original point was more on TFT being expected to stick around and not on HS struggles etc.
---
&gt; Perhaps they just find it unnecessary to throw bolted on tits on every 'female' creature.
---
Well, duh. They've done a great job averting that their entire time of existence.
---
&gt; No one is saying anything like that.
---
But in treating representations of bigger than a B or C cup are automatically sexual just by their very existence, they are acting like it.
---
Part of the hate is also based on their practice of offering you like five bucks for a game that came out recently that you bought for $50 three weeks ago.  Oh you want cash instead of store credit?  Best we can do is four dollars.
---
80 patio tables with umbrellas?
---
your text is too ornery
---
I agree, as a general standard-wide deck the winrate is inflated because it's cheap, people will be playing mech hunter vs basic decks at rank 25, won't be the case for warrior, mage or rogue mostly. I also agree it's good people can play it without too much investment and experience in the game, gets players hooked.
---
it is based on stats and reason .
---
I play Wild on occasion, so to me that feels like incentive enough to keep all the good ones (and even some of the less good ones because I like experimenting with weird decks).
---
&gt;  It would also mean a lot less incentive to become a medical professional as I assure you the US government would not be paying the same amount for medical services as the average person walking into an American hospital would.
---
Why is there an extreme surplus of people wanting to become doctors in basically every country in the world, even in Europe where doctors makes 50-60k a year instead of 300k like in the US?
---
Can it be that people actually like to save lives, and that they just dont do it for the money?
---
I think you need to be about three smidges less sarcastic and two smidges more snide and you'll hate America just like all the Americans do.
---
at rank 5 i still meet hunters half of my games .

I’m just started streaming casually about a month ago as a hobby. I’ve been playing Hearthstone since May 2015. I love talking strategy for matchups and anticipating what the opponent will do. Come and hang out when I stream (typically after 8pm ET). #ChillStream
---
I don't think Galvanizer would be playable at 3 mana. This is a longstanding difficulty in balancing Hearthstone: a single point of mana can swing low-cost cards from overpowered to unplayable.
---
Yeah, but when do they join battle. Is it the Second War? Because they were forced to
---
I didn't say gun violence isn't a concern. The guy made it sound like most Americans get shot. I sarcastically agreed. Do you think that most Americans get shot? If not, we agree with each other...
---
Because bugs
---
Multiple times. The Second War they were subjugated by the Dragonmaw, that's not siding with mortals. War of the Shifting Sands, the Northrend campaign, much of the warrior artifacts in Legion were red/black dragonflight related.
---
Ah. The old "someone shows me facts about how I'm wrong now I was joking" meme. The best meme...
---
What did you just call me?
---
I thought Shifting Sands was mostly just the Bronze? I may be mistaken. Northrend, yeah. (Unless your talking about the first campaign) That makes sense, but they joined to fight literal Death. The scourge goes against everything they stand for so I'll give you that one. Artifacts does not equal endorsement of fighting.

Did purple win the series?

I had this game up while running errands all over my house. I got everything done and it was still going on. Jesus christ. Please do something about Warrior Blizzard, its not fun to play against or even to play as.
---
Why is that a bad thing? Most cards are nerfed with the intention of removing them from widespread play. At 3 galv would be mostly used for janky mechathun combo decks, which is perfectly fine. Aggro shouldn't be cost reducing their curve.
---
How about we remove the turn limit if we are going to have cards that extend your deck indefinitely.
---
interesting about this card is the thing it doesn’t copy a passive hero power from the bosses in Dalaran Heist. I wonder if it will work in players passive hero power case
---
Wow that's hilarious. Poor Purple. He played it so well despite the 8 Devastators.
---
Dude, what the hell? You watch jerma? That streamer is FUCKED
---
Lol fam trust me the community has been dying for a tournament mode for about half a decade

Could image how fucking boring this match was

Hey, if I could work with the Clutchmother I opened in day 1 of Un'Goro, you can work with your Hir'eek

I'd say Mech Pally and OTK Pally are both meta-viable, Mech Pally isn't some Tier 4 garbage IMO, I think it's doing nicely but isn't that high tier

Only the past 2?????

But yeah, it sucks.... :(
---
I'm pretty sure in the lore she's trained as a Druid...
---
It's Spanish. A Portuguese speaker already said it was close but Spanish.
---
He isn't that bad. Let me tell you what you the condition you need meet before getting 8 devastator:
---
Drawing Dr. Boom and survive at least 7 turn which you rarely do against face deck because they just concede seeing the tankiest class.
---
Then you need to Win the 1/5 lottery every 2 round to get the Mech Hero Power which you probably not get because it is higher than the change of Rag fire ball you in the face at full board every single time
---
Get the OMEGALUL Devastator from one of the 3 discover option which you also do because it is a card game, it has some luck element for surprise and etertainment.
---
Considering how hard these condition is, I don't think Dr. Boom is that OP
---
It depends. At rank 20 you'll be at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to player skill, but most people here will still be somewhat competent and have meta decks. Depending on your skill, it may be easy enough to compete with these people to complete your quests. You'll come to expect how people play in ranked because most people want to win and will play the typical cookie-cutter decks to achieve that. (which means it'll be easier to understand how to learn to play the game the right way)
---
On the other hand, casual has a hidden mmr, meaning if you lose enough games you'll eventually be matched with players which you "should" be able to beat. However in casual you're more likely to face players who are playing some really bizarre decks since there is no penalty to loss and they may be just trying to complete their quests. (a deck filled with deahthrattles to complete the deathrattle quest for instance) It may be easier to complete your quests in casual, but it may be harder to understand how to actually get better so you're not struggling to complete your quests in the first place.
---
Optionally, you can just decide to complete your quests with someone on your friends list. This is by far the fastest way since you don't actually have to work for it if you're friend just lets you do what you need to do. 
---
You can also just reroll 50-60g quests that say "win X games", as they are much more difficult to complete than the other quests which naturally complete themselves on their own by playing the game.
