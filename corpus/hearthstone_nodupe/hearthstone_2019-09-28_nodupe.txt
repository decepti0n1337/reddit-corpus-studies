Warrior Quest at 4 would be such a buff.  Then two 2-durability weapons would complete it.  Now you need at least one 3-durability weapon.

I'm brand new. And that's good to know. It was super disheartening to see a deck where I didnt recognise a single card and they just pulled of ridiculous synergising combos I know I have no access to.

You mean it hasn't been randomly generated, right?  We're talking about Mage here.

Yeah it would be pretty interesting over a temporary time frame.

Either way this event is going to shake things up and giving everyone the cards for free ... awesome.

I usually keep music turned off and play my own for normal gameplay, but I make it a point to turn it on for new adventures. There are always a few tracks exclusive to solo mode and they can be surprisingly catchy, especially the end bosses. Not sure if it's Stockholm Syndrome but my favorite is probably [The Lich King's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qet8EuKhKZg&amp;list=PLJaKbPlXXQon3TLMKh_Gm3rSKwPV9dm4w&amp;index=50).
---
Hmm, what should it cost though?  Surely we shouldn't release it at 8 right?  Because then it'd be too strong with Youthful Brewmaster and Baleful Banker, right?
---
That, my friend, is not an average deck.
---
You would think if Sylvanas is coming back she would‚Äôve been featured in the blog post. One of the most popular characters in their game.
---
What are those cards in your hand, yikes.  
---
No wonder you lose.
---
Medivh would be a great one to bring back. I barely see him played in Wild.
---
There's a leak for which cards are supposedly coming back.
---
usually how i use elven archer: 1. ping my own acolyte, 2. subdue + ping a big target, 3. ping away the minions that were reborn w 1 health
---
there are some weird occasions too like v zoolock if they play flame imp on turn 1, idm pinging it to make a 3/1 vs 1/1 board. 
---
the last use is related to handspace. sumtimes ull end up hving too many cards in ur hand, and ur not in a position to burn cards (as combo pieces might still be in the deck) so i just play elven archer, ping face. so that my hand goes back to 9 cards or less.

That‚Äôs just wrong... even shaman was the best deck in the game for a solid amount on and off all throughout Baku/genn‚Äôs reign.
---
Even paladin with unnerfed call to arms was in my opinion the strongest deck to ever exist at least in standard. When witchwood came out it absolutely terrorized the meta with a 56% winrate at rank 5 thru legend **and it was still climbing when nerfed**.  This was when the power level of standard was the highest ever (KnC and Baku/genn).
---
People hated odd paladin because you could truly be brain dead and win and it took much longer to get nerfed but even paladin was an absolute monster it‚Äôs just that CTA got nerfed quite quickly.
---
Mightymouse#1933 NA trade. Both show
---
Those are 2 completely different styles of decks lol what. Even shaman shares a ton more playstyle wise with aggro/overload shaman. Quest shaman is much more similar to say quest rogue but much less powerful.
---
Yasu#1509 NA trading an 80 gold quest. You go first.

---
Honestly Giorno as a priest makes a whole lot of sense
---
Oh sure thanks I didn't know about that
---
There was a sick combo I used with earthen scales and Gnomebliterator. Got to about 300 damage.
---
Treants r definitely duplicates cuz they all discount mulchmuncher regardless of art, idk abt sheep but it likely works the same way. If u r unsure u could always just make sure u have a yellow border arnd ur highlander cards before playing them
---
If it's vaporize, priest wins automatically no matter how he plays it, so there is no such thing as a good or bad line of play against vaporize.
---
Yeah.  Let's remember guys, if this quest becomes GOOD, then we will hate it a lot more than some of the current meta decks.

What do i think of Northshire Cleric?

Zephrys is weird. I was playing highlander hunter against some form of control mage, the opponent plays \[\[Bone Wraith\]\] **and buffs it,** I play Zephrys, and what do I get? NO SILENCE, but I got Shadow Word Pain and I had some minions on board so it was fine.

I don't mean to say "but your point is irrelevant," but I'm currently about halfway through 100%ing the third Chapter on Normal difficulty, and I've only lost to either of those bosses (Illidara Sunsdawn) once, and that was because I was running a jank Elise deck just after unlocking her. 
---
I should note I am really not that good at the game in general. It seems possible that you just had trouble one time and decided that the boss was unfair...
---
Echo of Jaina in End Times used both Frost and Fire spells. But yeah, she's mostly an iconic Frost Mage.
---
I thought so.  That might explain it then.  You keep your health from your previous match, so in drawing it sent you back but it didn't reset your life, because, well... the anomaly carries your health over from your last match, and your last match was you at -17 health.
---
Seems like it‚Äôd be awfully boring to play though. Much prefersBob‚Äôs other decks.
---
Got I felt like I just watched a yugioh episode
---
Stealth = hide
---
Happy Cake Day OP! :-)
---
Ah, the good old days of Warlock with Bloodreaver and N'Zoth. It was fun to summon a neverending wave of Void Lords.
---
Um it‚Äôs not hard, I only play Reno and I clear it every single time. It‚Äôs not hard but it‚Äôs annoying when there is like 4 berserkers. But it‚Äôs quite easy if you focused your deck around a strong point like spell slinging
---
If only you could include ALL NINE of your Divine Hymns in your deck...
---
At this time of month, rank 5 is filled with people who got there using streaks giving them bonus stars.
---
So here's your argument, it's not OP because aggro decks have a fair chance to beat it. I think it's OP because it's too easy to play and completely dominates mid game having more than enough potential to immediately pull itself out of the "low tempo", ever heard of Nourish? Not only can it catch up, it can immediately pass you by supplying itself with extra cards and mana crystals. Next turn, since choose one cards generally have a low mana cost they Immediately have board presence/ board clear. After your minions eventually die from the enemy summoning over 4 minions with relatively high ap and hp minion constantly throughout the game, turn per turn.
---
That's the main strength of the secret, you can often get away with playing a bad secret just to force your opponent into a potential missplay.
---
It's really difficult to categorise! I think that is down to their expertise once again though; the sounds adapt to the themes of the set/adventure so well. I've been trying to find songs that evoke a similar set of emotions for me and they're all cinematic themes or overtures. The swelling Overture of Bj√∂rk's 'Selma Songs' soundtrack has a similar feeling of power, albeit more slowly and simply delivered. And listening to it directly before the final song from that soundtrack ('New World') makes you really appreciate a good leitmotif in action.
---
It makes a big explosion on the enemy board, and then flies back into your deck.
---
Underbelly = curve
---
When else would it trigger? What do you suppose "when you fight it" means?

Not if you have a deathrattle heavy deck and copy hero power :D
---
Rotum#21126 want to trade 80g on EU, i'll show, you go first.

No. There has always been this misconception OP is thinking of, but it wasn't in the game.
---
10 + 1 is not 10. No, it doesn't do things that are not in its cardtext.

And what if we need a taunt minion, we have Hobgoblin on the board and Houndmaster in hand. Will our silver boi finally be the perfect pick and get the love he deserves?

I suggest you buy packs from Saviours of Uldum and Rise of Shadows first as they are used in the meta a lot, especially Saviours of Uldum as it‚Äôs the most recent expansion. These 2 expac came this year so they will be in standard until 2021.
---
Then I suggest you buy Boomsday Packs as a considerable amount of cards are still being played, especially if you plan on playing any Mech oriented decks.
---
Witchwood and Rastakhan‚Äôs Rumble have a lot of unplayed cards so I would go with them last. Just open packs until you get your guaranteed legendary (within 10 packs) and stop after that. Any card from that expansion that you want for a deck, you should craft. 
---
For all of the expansions, start off by opening packs until you get guaranteed legendary (within 10 packs). After that you can either open SoU, RoS and Boomsday packs or you can save gold for the next expansion so that you have a headstart over others.
---
First of all, 20 packs from which expansion?
---
Here is the deckcode I use

At rank 4-L EU. I think there was a Control Shaman in there but can't find the game. But let's not pretend Control Warrior is that hard. Buff's more relevant because it allows you to pressure. N'zoth also gets screwed by Warpath because of Khartut Defender, which otherwise isn't a very useful card to them.
---
Oh dear god, it's a baby combo priest
---
Yes yes yes

Because cold is what slows down decay and preserves bodies, isn't it?

Nah man, that's [Baruka from Sololevelling](https://solo-leveling.fandom.com/wiki/Baruka).

No, this is pretty much what you'd expect.

It‚Äôs on my profile! The degenerate dragons one. Pretty fun and surprisingly good against secret mage!
---
I'M JUST DOING WHAT THE SONG SAYS TO DO!!!!!
---
Still, yes.
---
When he restarts the plague lord it is at one hp
---
When you face the boss again, he starts with whatever remaining HP it has. In this case - 1 hp. Hence OP quit his run and restarted immediately.
---
Imo Blizzard needs to go through basic and classic, but really focus on priest, warrior, and shaman. Those three classes have the most issues - warriors had most of their basic set nerfed and/or the support for the theme (charge, enrage) dropped from the game. Cards like Circle of Healing, Charge, and Totemic Might only make things harder by distraction new players while reducing the realistic options in the classic set. Give Shaman a basic big heal, like heal 15 for 5, that way you only need to print new shaman healing if you want a smaller option. Give priest a board clear, like 5 Mana for 3 damage to all minons - you can always print competing/better options, like Blizzard does for warrior and mage.
---
Btw my case for nuking CoH: Auchenai Circle hasn't been a playable combo in ages. The card fits narrowly into enabling priests draw engine with cleric and pyro, not something that necessarily needs to be supported every year.
---
ME GO FACE.
---
Still haven't got VIP yet.
---
Because all the cards I were playing were just RNG cards, that's shit gameplay to me. Doesn't matter if it's not the actual matches, that's 2 thirds of the game just total RNG snorefest

Dark bomb was such a nice card. Could run it in every single warlock deck pretty much

So this is the ideal deck if you‚Äôre a standard player trying to get into wild. Very similar to the current mech hunter list in standard, just added the cards from Wild I felt we‚Äôre good. This list might already exist for all I know but I don‚Äôt care lol. 
---
MULLIGAN GUIDE 
---
KEEP: Cogmaster, Fireworks tech, Mecharoo, Spider bomb, ANY DISCOUNT MANA MECH, venomizer 
---
These are all great keeps but you need to use your judgement or you‚Äôll get that ass tapped. A lot of people will say it‚Äôs a mindless aggro deck that takes no thinking, but a lot of people are not legend. Use your brain, make smart plays, win more games. 
---
THIS DECK IS ABOUT TEMPO MORE THAN ANYTHING. This deck will value trade if it needs too, goblin bombs are very expendable. Whatever you need to do to establish tempo early and keep it rolling, DO IT!
---
There are too many decks to name in wild but this is what I noticed most often as far as MATCHUPS are concerned.

(Secret mage) - very winnable, try to get bomb toss out when you know there‚Äôs not counterspell. Keep deathstalker for this one IMO. 
---
(Odd Paladin) - GET MISSLE FUCKIN LAUNCHER AT ALL COSTS AND DISCOUNT IT IF POSSIBLE. If you stack a venomizer on that shit against odd pally it‚Äôs brutal 
---
(Mech/combo paladin)- VENOMIZER IS THE MVP ALONG WITH MISSLE LAUNCHER. GET THAT DOWN AND YOU WIN! 
---
(Mirror) - TEMPOTEMPOTEMPOTEMPOTEMPO WHOEVER ESTABLISHES IT FIRST USUALLY WINS 
---
(Any priest deck) - Honestly just fuck that man up.. SMOrc like you never have before but kill their high health stuff and northshire bc that can get scary lol 
---
Any questions? Comment or message me. Let me know how it goes for you and good luck being a degenerate!
---
Her glases should have had a small crack

*adjusts glasses* AHKSHULLY, while the Faldorei are a canon example of nightborne/nightevles becoming spider-creatures, the Faldorei were created by a massive experimental treatment of arcane energy gone catastrophically wrong. The nerubians, on the other hand, were slaughtered by the Lich King and raised into his service, and so are more in-theme as the arachnid inspiration for a death night character.
---
It changed its command in the middle of the video, and the timing is slightly different between commands (though this can be from latency). It's probably a bot, but those two things make it a little weird
---
Joking aside, it definitely seems that the one player can outplay the other, yes. Control mirrors are very poorly understood in general, even at higher ranks.
---
Wait isn't nerubian is already a nerubian before they were ....ressurected? Why would a kaldorei suddenly turning into a nerubian?
---
Julan #21466 looking for someone to trade the quest with on EU. I'll show mine but we do yours first :-D
---
I picked up this game literally a couple days ago, so you'll have to forgive me for not being up to your standards, I guess?
---
Still seems like a Night Elf for the most part, or some kind of caster Night Elf. It‚Äôs a great illustration, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I just feel like something is still missing to give it that ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù look of a Death Knight.
---
Minions that cost (2) or less have poisonous btw
---
It is, why the quotation marks
---
You lost
---
Its like the darkness from evolve
---
You say that as though bots aren't a quintessential part of being aat rank 20

NEVER SKIP DIG DAY !
---
Seems pretty good for early bosses, but could really backfire against later bosses/plague lords, since you‚Äôre thinning your deck *real* quick. Can you say fatigue?
---
The passive treasure that shuffles two one-cost copies of cards you played could make it work, but alas, you can only have two of them. That, and the fact that you're probably rarely *playing* minions.
---
Wow that is absolutely beautiful. Nicely done.
---
The problem is that you get a copy of Topsy Turvy back, but the Test Subject dies without being resummoned.
---
The only way this works in Standard is to use Zephrys to pull a Sorcerer's Apprentice, and use a combo that involves copying the apprentice twice and using a 0-cost Vivid Nightmare to summon multiple copies of Test Subject.
---
Not to mention that the Mana Addict must stick to the board for one turn for this to even work. APM Boar OTK is better, but very difficult to pull off in Standard.
---
I think what happened is that it's programmed to go face when it's minions are given charge (due to Tundra Rhino), but for some reason they didn't program to override it's *attack taunt* command whenever a card has charge. As far as it's concerned, if the card has charge, it HAS to go face.
---
During gvg release there was this post saying that, but it isn't really, because both classes work very differently.
---
Had questing adventurer, the new classic card which gets +2/+2 whenever you cast a spell, etc, which snowballs.
---
You just kill the boss real quick, so there's no question of fatigue.
---
Actually, they start at whatever the lowest HP total you ever managed to get them to was. That‚Äôs also a big part of why this one‚Äôs first phase is such a royal pain in the ass: he can very easily create a board of taunts with lifesteal that ALSO destroy one of your minions when it dies or he uses his first hero power, which makes it borderline pointless to get in whatever damage you can to his face once it becomes clear that you‚Äôre not going to be winning that round, since he‚Äôs just going to heal it back up as he beats you down.
---
Won't he always find lethal if you have it?
---
This is also the reason why cards like [[Hellfire]] and [[Injured Blademaster]] have emphasis on words that cards now don‚Äôt.
---
It stays so you can use it again

If it doesnt say itll remove it from your deck, then it wont

Where's Krul the Unshackled?
---
The third one is full pogo-hoppers
---
I wonder what would happen if they played that card. Would the match have reset?
---
Chose it twice and never used it
---
Hey FishFishFishFishy, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
I once had two Disks of Legend and playing Khadgar filled my board entirely with them.
---
It also revealed Khadgar's true calling: Singing in offset unison.
---
How can they possibly reassess something that came down to pure chance?
---
If anything, with the amount of Lifesteal healing his deck has, I‚Äôd argue that this was actually the objectively correct play for the AI in the context of this match, ignoring the obvious fact that his persistent HP just got reduced to 1.
---
I just did one in solo yesterday

Good point/

CarmenOhio#11495, NA, Trading 80 G Quest.  You go first, I can show if requested.
---
Yeah, it's a bot.
---
I ran into the same thing where it kept trying to bypass taunt until their turn ran out.
---
I managed to beat him by borderline just ignoring his minions. Just go face and pray to the gods above
---
I'm sad reading this
---
That‚Äôs basically been my runs so far. I‚Äôve had it 3 or 4 times and only drawn it once.
---
I am 0 and 4 for fights after the VIP ticket and given the number of times I've shared that stat I clearly have some unsustainable salt levels.
---
Adding a popup to an already long tutorial is one of the worst ways for a game to teach you something. The more information they throw at you at one time, the more likely it is that you get overwhelmed and fail to internalize something. Generally, game designers like to teach you stuff as part of the play experience when possible, since it's both more interesting and allows them to spread out information more.
---
Hi i am 0 and 4 for fights after the vip ticket and given the number of times i've shared that stat i clearly have some unsustainable salt levels., I'm dad.
---
Until mods stop stifling my creativity
---
It is time to kill the process running your bot.
---
It either does or did reset the boss health, depending on if they fixed it since that time I used it or not, cause boy I wasn't a fan of that turnout.
---
You're the real MVP
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this
---
I like Chorus. What other cards of this keyword were done?
---
This game doesn't have a real "casual mode", unfortunately.  The best you can do is try to get to a rank floor and play meme decks there, against other people at rank floor playing meme decks.
---
12 teams had to design a card with Chorus, [you can find them all in the polls here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/dagujo/rcustomhearthstone_80000_subscriber_battle_royale/)
---
10000000 IQ play
---
Fireball was from Antonidas. He knew his whole hand, he should have played the weapons project to prevent lethal next turn.
---
You clearly know nothing about game desing if you think the only thing they do is sit arround and desing bad cards.
---
I understand your complains, but telling them that they are lazy and that their job is really easy is not going to make them listen to you better. In any case, you increase the chances of them not comunicating with you.
---
He was well aware of what his opponent had, he just got so focused on offensively clearing the board that he forgot to play Weapon's Project defensively.
---
What? Definitly not.

---
Yeah pogo hopper only deck, probably the weakest one of the 3
---
On Hellfire and old murlocs, it was also fun flavor. Deal damage to ALL CHARACTERS!
---
This kinda makes me think what would happen if the boss got a Tree of Life or that Paladin dragon that full heals.
---
&gt;im mentioning what WAS in play, flameward, and **how he could have played around it**
---
So ... you are talking abou what ifs. You also said "he made like 80 mistakes", so I'm trying to say that the only mistake is playing as if there was no spell damage, otherwise the play would have been fine.
---
this happened to me on my hardmode run of chapter 3 and then i was stuck with only 5 slots for the boss battle i was so pissed

You seem to be profoundly confused as to what a developer does.
---
\- If you lost a game, you may want to reconsider your life choices.
---
\- New deck slots will be released over time.
---
Not sure about the lag, can't help there, but those icons are unrelated to Firestone. Those are the in-game assets that appear in the tomb when you click it, and Blizzard just stores the graphic assets off-screen over there. Your screen is just so wide that they didn't account for them being visible.
---
It takes you to Bob‚Äôs tavern.
---
Right, and I praised them about those features in the OP. Good for them.
---
That would be a pretty big bone from Blizz to throw us. Honestly, I'm fine as it is. If you have any trouble clearing quests you can do it with friends
---
You're either misunderstanding me or straw manning me. I didn't call him lazy. I didn't say he should announce the state of the game regularly. **I said if he doesn't want people to criticize the state of the game, then he should fix the game's problems.** The same problems that have been around for 6 years.
---
Why are you against making the game better? Stop apologizing for them. They should be held accountable for their game, leaders always should be.
---
Yogg-like effects need a key word, how about madness

Hailskins#1633 NA Quest Trade
---
damn that's cool... does the poisonous animation go even if the minion would die without it?
---
You wanted proof that constructive feedback gets changes made.  Plenty of the changes there were community requests.  You want proof that petulant feedback doesn't get noticed by the devs?  See if this post makes it to the front page.
---
No u don't understand this guy is legit. He uses the heart of the cards to summon the black lotus onto a Charmane with 5 fire energies.
---
No just not play a minion that essentially deals 299 damage to itself.
---
Your art is insane, seriously good job :) I would love to see this and Magni in game.
---
Weird, looks like it‚Äôs silenced in hand
---
Man, you can even complete them against friends. Just queue up against one and ask him for doing the missions. You can also reroll the ones you dont like.
---

Turn before I had 3 1/1 mobs left with the chest going to be a mecathun after 3 mob deaths. Boom got the Mecathun THEN he silences and destroys my entire field... BUT I was 2nd phase (revives each players first minion to die so I got him back 10/1 to suicide him next turn for the win :)
---
I see that That's a plot twist here
---
Hearthstone does a terrible job at helping returning players. The only real solution is to pull out your wallet.
---
MY DREAMIMG ENDS 
---
YOUR NIGHTMARE BEGINS
---
Its not diverse at all, pretty much all good decks are singleton or quest based, that means they play around zeph/reno and call it a day, the only ones that doesnt stick to that are murloc shaman and maybe aggro warrior, the rest of decks  'attempts' are a joke.
---
xDDDDD
---
EU since the id starts with 2, na starts with 1 and asia is 3
---
They changed that like two patches ago
---
Ohh thanks.

Like... 3? Sundial of the Infinite. Torpor Orb. Command Beacon.
---
Umhiguss#1220 NA quest trade
---
The animations times really need an overhaul.
---
That doesnt exist, you can only play about 20 snip snaps in a turn
---
10 months of nothing? Do two expansions with many Hearthside Chats, Balance Patches, Adventures, Special Events, and AMAs mean nothing to you?
---
This guy's an idiot.
---
It also loops if both players have one.
---
If Frostbolt was available in Warlock, it would always be run over Darkbomb. (Or they would be run together, if a deck happened to require that.) Likewise, Mage would always pick Frostbolt over Darkbomb as well. Frostbolt is strictly, *objectively* better than Darkbomb.
---
Oh I am dumb. I was thinking about only addict+ test subject + topsy. And totally forgot that I won‚Äôt get a new subject every time...
---
Thats not playing competitively then. Lol
---
I would love to get rid of my Garrosh portrait but I'd rather take Grommash over Silvanas.
---
I love this anology
---
No, that makes no sense at all. The point of quests is to get you to play the game, not to do 10 health damage in a minute without any resistance.
---
I think the off meta decks went on for a bit after the layoffs though. I might be wrong.
---
7.5 percentile. thats an 92% grade.
---
It's not a third party program. Just a simple change to the game files.
---
So I managed to cast Gnomebliterator 16 times (due to primalfin champion and Jr Navigator). Thus, Hearthstone card is turn 1 lethal for 320 damage. Second picture [here](https://imgur.com/B9IhvuP).
---
That's not entirely true. Animations do last shorter for the player who uses them if queued up. +/- 30 snips should be doable.
---
Platinum Angel
---
That would be the best creature you could get though tbh. Phage wouldn't kill yourself because evolving doesn't make enter the battlefield triggers.
---
Ooh I like that idea.. it‚Äôs a small thing but given the new class portraits for 1k wins it makes sense.
---
Edit: I‚Äôm an idiot and didn‚Äôt realise it came with a clip
---
Now I want Reno DK.

I don't dig into tierlists or decklists, have simply seen it in Quest Rogue a lot.
---
Unfortunately that is just how card games are going to work. I haven't played any other online tcg but I'm pretty sure they're similar. 
---
It's very similar to paper trading card games when you buy the cards but you don't get to hold the assets. Of course, that is worse but that's your choice and what you pay to enjoy online player base and digital features. But still the same, if you stopped playing any trading card game that you played with actual cards, you'd have to re-up your collection, most likely opening random packs trying to get the right ones.
---
Compare it to other triple A games where you have to buy the content yearly. Sports games are literally reskins with new player models but are resold as new titles. Same with rpg or shooter games that need to be repurchased yearly. COD &amp; others even make you pay more for other features and skins. 
---
Of course hearthstone is expensive and could be cheaper. The general idea is that it is a business and just like any other game you pay for what you get. 
---
Just imagine spending $20 on the game as going out for bowling for a night. You spend your money where you enjoy it. 
---
I had immature spending habits with gambling, drugs, and others and found spending money on hearthstone is much more enjoyable than losing money online or getting drunk. Plus I get to continually enjoy it. 
---
Once you have a certain size collection, you do not need to spend or work so hard to build your collection. 
---
I have spent a lot in the game and will honestly say I have spent way more than I had too. I just got addicted to pack opening.
---
You don't need every competitive deck even, just a handful that you enjoy. 
---
After all, you won't enjoy playing every single deck.

We need to have this be a bigger deal
---
Had the treasure that reduces costs by 1 for every odd card played and the 1 mana draw a card that costs 2,3,4 and 5 mana. From turn 10 I was dropping 0 mana C'Thun's with rush every turn
---
Doesn't make you right
---
No, it needs more cards. I think highlander hunter is the best deck, that I‚Äôve seen played. Just wondering what everyone else‚Äôs opinions are.
---
The only playable priest deck, or murloc paladin if your feeling lucky
---
Whizbang does update...?
---
And yea still can‚Äôt be beat by retards like you
---
To me Murdock paladin isn‚Äôt that great of a deck, unless you get really lucky. I‚Äôve been playing some janky ass beast deck and only lost once in 4-5 times playing against Murloc paladin, but they went second and got really lucky. 
---
What priest deck?
---
