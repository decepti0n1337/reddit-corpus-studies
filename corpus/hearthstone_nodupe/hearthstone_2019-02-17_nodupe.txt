&gt; “Ice block isn’t in standard anymore, so there’s no secret that can save him here”
---

---
Yea this is really fun when it happens. I think there were some nerfs too that happened just before a rotation so we got a few days of a tweaked meta.
---
I mean, when volcanosaur dropped just seeing 1 new card in a few decks felt good. 
---
I guess the icy winds of northrend consumed your opponent's soul.
---
What about Ziliax 
---
Rank 20 play right there.
---
Sure, I'm just saying that if you don't want to spend the dust on leeroy right now, wolfrider + hero power is nearly as good.
---
This post made my day, if you hate the deck that lots of people are playing right now (I’m basing this off of the post, I don’t play standard so I wouldn’t know) then maybe take a break from the game instead of blowing your salty load onto reddit and making yourself look like an immature child.
---
No he's just been spamming this on this sub for the past 2 days. I have no idea what the fuck he's doing.

Mby i don't play enough these days ... wall priest isn't new, i've seen the deck before but was just a worse version of the priest decks we all knew (and hate).

Thank you for this list

Most players are probably like 12, what do you expect accepting requests straight after a match?  
---
Never accept them unless you want to have a good ole laugh at the rage or just want to troll them to make them even angrier.  
---
Infinite value is just fine if its slow enough that aggro can easily punish it.
---
My wild casual experience is definitely mostly janky decks butting heads. But it really depends. If you play silly decks, you'll lose against anyone who plays serious decks, and eventually your MMR will be bad enough to only play against other true casuals. If you try-hard in casual, you'll end up bumping into others who do the same.

---
I once got this exact offering off stonehill in arena. After agonizing I took Tarim, which proved the right choice in a knock down drag out fight with a warrior who had double dragon roar and the omega spell.
---
Never lucky.
---
I wouldn’t craft Leeroy to put it in this deck. But I’d craft him to also have Secret Odd so I could switch to it depending on the meta I’m encountering. Which is what I did. 
---
Only playing those 2 decks at the moment (a control list similar to yours, and secret odd mage with Subject 9)
---
Leeroy is a pretty safe craft and very useful in almost any aggro deck. If he happens to get HoF’ed this rotation, you will get full dust back.
---
People love to complain
---
It is when this is at least the 9^th time this account has posted it.
---
Or just deny it, because this community is full of piece of shit assholes
---
He was almost out of cards. That may have been his last chance. All his eggs in one basket, and all that.
---
95% of people playing this game are miserable, so I mean that seems like a pretty easy guess
---
This, ironically.
---
Tho we're not bots. It shouldn't be so easy for him. I fucking love Luigi but I fucking hate warrior. 
---
The innocence 
---
whats up with all these bots spamming this 
---
Because netdecking exist and (most) people don't have infinite money to try janky decks I strongly believe only cards which generate other cards (Etheral Conjurer, Shimmering Glimmeroot, Blink Fox, etc) can make the game not utterly stale.
---
Is there an exact date for the rotation?
---
While I wouldn't mind because I don't hate Baku/Genn as much as most people it seems...
---
If you hate them *now*, wait to see how it gets when the decks power level goes way down (less cards) but their hero power stays the same... Even more oppressive than it is now, because cards people will use to counter it will be worse.
---
I had tremendous fun when the game was just the classic set.  A month of four sets would be just fine.
---
Depends when you’re doing it, most people shouldn’t be against replying to a greetings, but anything past that could get construed as bm. 
---
Exactly. Urza's to Mercadian Masques and Mirrodin to Kamigawa are great examples of this in action in Magic. Ravnica followed Kamigawa and became one of the most popular sets of all time.
---
People are so hesitant to treat Hearthstone like the card game it is when it comes to analyzing it's success. Instead, they insist it's a video game and that it's over the hill by the time it hits five years despite being based on WoW and made by the same people.
---
I hope you get fucking stomach cancer dude what the fuck is wrong with you
---
Cool you got good rng
---
In which aggro players complain about the Druid cards that allowed them to actually win against early game onslaughts. 
---
Same.
---
Cool.  Or they can bring back a 2 mana fiery war axe and build the next set around it accordingly. They are changing the identity of the classes, and more importantly, the game in an uninteresting and bad way.
---
Let it go. 
---
I agree that a better route forward would be unnerfing those Classic cards and then reprinting when appropriate in expansions. But class identity goes beyond what's competitively viable. Also, essentially removing cards like these from Standard makes room for other cards that can play into that identity in new and interesting ways.
---
You flip the decks between wild and standard. Unfortunately it is a little more hassle to sort wild decks ;)
---
I miss Kazakus. 
---
i typically unpack all the legendaries before i do the epics
---
Yea, I get that, but having a yearly rotation happen a week early is a much smaller change than rotating an expansion out every 4 months.
---
It'd necessarily be larger, since a strictly greater number of people will play the mode than were it a tavern brawl.
---
If it's a brawl, people will play a game or two and stop. If it's the actual standard card pool, people will still want to climb ladder or just play game, especially since most people play standard as their main mode..
---
So make people play the mode because they won't want to on their own if given the option? 
---
Seems like a rough idea
---
thanks i cummed
---
*Technically*, you can hit legend with a 1:100 win/loss ratio, you just need to play a LOT of games
---
Did you just jump in from another timeline or something? Naga Druid wasn’t even a deck. 
---
The reason Naga Sea Witch got nerfed was because Giants Warlock was just another Big Priest level swingy deck that often forced a concession on turn 5. 
---
Because I can't pay proper attention to things this is actually how I thought it was going to be, I was really disappointed when it was not.
---
This is a weird looking Magic The Gathering Arena setup. Is this custom?

---
I mean, people generally like when an expansion drops, but will simultaneously will only play a brawl that's only restriction is a different card pool for a game or two. It because there's no reward or incentive to play brawl outside of the initial win.
---
People will definitely play it more if it's the actual standard card pool.
---
that time? are they announcing new set soon? (genuinely dont know been out of the scene for a while)
---
I much prefer Drakonid Operative to all the resurrect cards Priest gets. Drako lets you adapt to the match-up, it's terrific value but you're not cheating mana.

Oh yes, I didn't think about polymorph in my odd big spell mage. 
---
Wild Growth was an OP card and drawing it on turn 2 could decide the games. Nourish nerf was weird tho.
---
&gt; it hasn’t been talked about in a few hours
---
oh boy i was getting worried.
---
So what should be done?
---
Omai wa mo shindeiru
---
Honest to God, I want less “good” cards and more “okay” cards in the future. It probably won’t happen since they need to push packs, but the fact that there aren’t enough cards comparable in power level while also being less than completely batshit insane is what ends up making stale metas.
---
That's the point, those murlocs have strong on-play abilities and you are essentially paying 2 Mana for a 2/2, which is nowhere near strong enough to see play.
---
It’s the same conversations every expansion. Nothing ever gets better, no one will ever be happy, the game could always be better if they gave us what we want.

I only log in to do  dailies every few days at this point and its always a chore to make myself do it because I know i'm gonna have to play against some stupid OTK decks while trying to get a win for a quest

They should just set aside 8 of their fillerISH cards from each expansion and then release two cards each month (for free as a tavern reward or whatever)

if they scale back esports, feelsbadman.  Pro Hearthstone is kinda like my 4th sport i follow. I like following the seasonal playoffs/championships , and always learn a lot watching guys like Muzzy, Saiyan, Amnesiac, Dog, etc.   And if not, its fun hearing general TJ/Admiral buffoonery. 
---
"frequently" lol using the only/one of at most 2 silences you have if it's even in your hand at the time otherwise it's still a Divine taunt that gives you a buffed up Arcanite Reaper. 
---
He's not wrong. Hearthstone is fun but it's a shit economy. I quit playing magic because that's a rip-off, but hs is even a bigger rip-off than magic.

All I see is a regular game with Priest

I'm so looking forward to this piece of broken shit card rotating out soon. Hopefully nothing alike follows after.

This is perfect, nice work!
---
Shut the hell your mouth
---
That's really just your opinion though since you have no idea if a fictional card is so weak or not if applied to the game. The only "real" metric the card can be judged on is the design competition, and since it won, it clearly has some value even if said value absolutely doesn't translate beyond the realm of fiction. I mean, I can name maybe a hundred real cards that have way less theoretical value than Reef Encounter, and I wouldn't call those cards poorly designed, just bad.
---
Thanks dude. I am missing ratcatcher, how important is this card in this deck?
---
So you made a screenshot and decided to  take a picture of that screenshot and post it. Instead of posting the screenshot. Why?
---
Unless they unnerfed the cards from classic, it would likely just be handlock and freeze mage at this point. Heck, even with the unnerfed cards, it would probably still be mostly handlock and freeze mage, with some extra druid and rogue thrown in. Those two decks were just really strong
---
Have you not seen Cancerdin?

5/7 taunt, rush bear as well
---
It’s pretty good if you include two war bears in addition to Akali. It’s also one of the highest attack rush minions, so buffing it with Akali is insane. 
---
If you don’t need the dust, don’t disenchant legendaries, because if you disenchant it you can get one again from opening packs. But if you keep it you can get different legendaries from packs.
---
Haloid#2254 EU 80g quest trade you go first :D
---
Resurrection has to be the most broken mechanic ever introduced to a card game, and the only classes that can deal with it consistently are shaman and mage with poly and hex, and as you pointed out, even that doesn’t work all the time. Not playing mage or shaman? Don’t have hex or polymorph on turn four? Screw you, then, priest just wins. No decisions, no trading, no thinking through plays, they just win. Why even play the game at that point, if you just win thanks to a bs mechanic? Where’s the fun in constantly playing the exact same way every game? The only thing that changes for priest is which massive minion they resurrect the entire game. 
---
Not quiet right, there are two small misconceptions:
---
"1/2 to get war golem first times 1/2 to get magma rager second = 1/4" --&gt; It's 1/2 times 1/3 = 1/6, because the first resummoned War Golem is removed from the pool of possible resurrections. So when the second minion will be resurrected, only 3 are left, beeing War Golem, Magma Rager and Salty Dog, so 1/3.
---
The rest is right. If you go down that path with 1/6 instead of 1/4 now, you'll end up with 50% of getting exactly Magma Rager (or Salty Dog, same with him).
---
The second minor error is re-using the 1/12 from your first line of thought wrong. There, you wanted to evaluate Magma Rager specifically. Now this is not that important. To explain it with your approach:
---
The probability of NOT getting a War Golem is 1/2 during the first resurrection (2 minions = WG, 2 minons = not WG), and 1/3 during the second (2 minions = WG, 1 minion = not WG). So it's 1/2 times 1/3 = 1/6 for not getting a War Golem ... so it's vice versa 5/6 getting at least one, or 83,3(33333)%.
---
Catchy, I like it.
---
Well, that would be never.
---
Sometimes there are promotional bundles, but that’s it.
---
Not really sure what answer you want here.  You got a bit lucky, they got a bit more lucky, they won.  Results over a sample size 1 game are almost meaningless.
---
On the other hand if you just started this thread to get free karma because you say bad things about Barnes then.... well, enjoy the internet points I guess.

You can actually use it as part of your OTK, too. Play depression with nothing in your deck and then Toggwaggle and then it's a  mechathun deck that doesn't need you to empty your hand and gives you AOEs.
---
I climbed to rank 3 with Oondasta Rush Warrior, but that was before Hunterstone. Freeze trap messed it up hard...
---
Now it might be viable again...
---
It just used to be there and now it’s not. Personally not a fan of the decision because I feel sorry is a really good emote to have, also for actual communication, like when somebody puts down a voidlord to avoid lethal and you have polymorph or comparable situations. So yeah, I think sorry would be nicer than for example Hello. To me it would be fine if the heroes just automatically said hello and that slot would be used for sorry again, for example.
---
They tried to do exactly that and then people complained that the new cards weren’t good enough. There’s genuinely nothing that will make everyone happy.

good arena player, not me. 
---
Name checks out
---
It would be nice if the rotated out Genn and Baku too. 
---
Another problem is that hearthstone uses randomness to balance. 
---
The reasoning is that if a random effect hits 100% of its potential half the time and 0% the other half then you can make the card twice as powerful since the chance level balances. 
---
In reality you have a sad player 100% of the time, when the randomness hits it's the opponent, when it missed it's the player.

---
Why beg for scraps when you can have a whole meal ?
---
I suggest a monthly rotating core/classic set and that portions of new expansions are released monthly. 
---
It usually takes the community two or three weeks to solve the meta to stagnant status. 
---
that potion was not the perfect answer. The answer is not allowing them to get ysarg into the res pool. He may have played ressurect and won a 50/50, but he may have eternal servitude and it wouldnt have mattered.
---
You constructed your deck in a way that by only having 1 ofs, you get to use powerfull cards like reno, kazakus and solia. Big priest also constructed his deck with few minions in order to have the chance to pull them out early, at the risk of having to play boarclears and survive untill turns 8/9/10 to play them normally, and with barnes being possibly a bad pull from ressurect, spellstone and more importantly, shadow essence.
---
Your points do make a lot of sense, but you reach a conclusion that its pretty bad. You played the best counter you could for that deck, but got beaten because the counter wasnt good enough. The problem then its not "that deck shouldnt exist" but more "better counters should exist". The amount of barnes into ysarg into whatever is very very VERY RARE, and worse than just playing 2 molten giants and shirvalla, and playing holy wrath on 5 and trying to win right there with luck. Yet we dont ask blizz to change how holy wrath works because the winrate is also not oppresive, and there is certain counterplay with deck manipulation and spell disruption, appart from just armor.
---
Blizzard should start printing more graveyard counterplay, better than just things like cornered sentry ot saronite taskmaster. Actual cards that can revive minions that died in the opponent side of the field, or effects that transform all minions that died in the opponent side to some vanilla mid-stated minion (so future ressurects would target those minions, instead of things lie Ysarg or Statue). Also, cards that avoid players from drawing extra cards or pulling cards out of the deck would be cool, and are common in many other CCGs, so playing it could avoid or slow the big priests plays, giving enough time for the opponent to actually develop a board to fight back, or to play better counter cards (the 10 mana kazakus potion that transforms all, maybe. Or just 2 polys for both ysargs).

Would we? KFT was the second Mammoth set, asssuming we‘d have six expansions active at all times we‘d have KFT around for six expansions instead of five like we do now, which is more like 4 months more.

---
Okay, power creep isn’t the right term, how about just becoming progressively more broken as new tools are added? My point still stands that I don’t like playing against wild decks, because the interactions and synergies are becoming so ridiculous, it’s an absolute clown fiesta. 
---
I used to do this with the paladin murlok too in ungoro. It was a cool way to complete the paladin quest, since you always have a cheap minion and cheap damage spell to keep proccing it.
---
Of course, it was shit xD
---
Not drawing Barnes on 4 still leaves you with a strong deck that doesn't lack threats and ways to bring them back to life, though.
---
Also:
---
&gt; yet
---
24 mana value
---
Could just not be a child and letting someone emoting in a card game get the best of you. 
---
Survive until turn 10. Have mind blast and holy smite in hand. Play Zarek's Cloning Gallery for 9 mana. You will get Prophet Velen, Radiant Elemental and Malygos. Your Holy smite is now free, and deals 14 damage. Your Mind Blast deals 20 and costs 1. You just won.
---
Basically the trick is to hold on to your Mass Hysteria and your Psychic Scream for as long as possible, and save Shadow Vision for whatever combo piece is missing.
---
Some times you HAVE to play like you're gonna get lucky, instead of burning cards to stay alive slightly longer. 
---
No, why would you ever want a full collection? I can understand having all Legendaries maybe or full Standard set or full Warlock set. Or even full set if you're a whale. But wanting a full collection without spending any money is daft.
---
I guess selling one skin for $80 just didn't make enough for them to have 9 skins for this.

 about ready to leave this sub reddit
---
Because they dedicate embarrassingly little resources to a game that generates outsized revenue relative to its development costs despite having changed very little since it was made by like 4(?) guys in a few months in Unity.
---
Also, even if you start with another class, I definitely don’t recommend disenchanting Akali. Once you can afford the deck, rush warrior is a lot of fun. 
---
I meant I like it more than normal big spell mage. Guess I did a good job of clarifying that.
---
Apology accepted
---
I wouldn't really recommend advising a new player to hold onto cards that enable a deck like Rush Warrior if they have a more practical use for that dust. Rush Warrior is *crazy* expensive, especially for a mid tier deck.
---
All I see are excuses mixed in with lies.
---
Is that harbinger celestial I see in you hand?
---
Yes, I indeed exagerated, but it seems to me that cards like Raza, Patches, the old face Hunter pre nerf cube lock, the tempo rogue with Keleseth+shadowstep+keleseth were more a shitshow than Genn and Baku brought.
---
Yeah we have Odd Paladin and Odd Warrior that create some extreme polar decks, but I don't think we should judge genn and baku because of these.
---
Genn and Baku highly restrict deck building, and contrary to popular belief I don't think it restrits new cards. That always happened when a certain class was strong they didn't print more op cards for that class - like druid with duskfallen aviana and G O N K. I believe that Genn and Baku overall made HS a better game.

Of course it was, it was a good card that druid's sets have been balanced around. Thats even worse than complaining that comtrol mages all run flamestrike

It was  broken since witchwood. Reddit wanted rexar to be usable with the new beasts, and team 5 delivered. Now we have that abomination of a card autowinning against control decks.

Good job reddit! It was either letting DK rexxar be what the designers wanted it to be, or not printing lifesteal cards or not creating the rush mechanic at all.

I have started to go though all of the Adventures and playing them. Pleasantly surprised how fun they are but not many rewards. Renolock sounds like a good plan, May have to invest in some GvG packs because I'm missing a lot of good cards from that expansion. 
---
Wait, taking a break from a game puts you behind everyone else??? You sir have found the secrets to the universe, congratulations.
---
Thanks I'll have a look into the Midrange hunter I remember making one for ages ago when Un'Goro came out. although i find decks like Freeze Mage and Miracle Rouge much more fun to play but I'm guessing they aren't really viable anymore. 
---
Yeap resurrecting the same minion over and over it's broken, remove from the dead minions pool till it dies again is a really good idea!
---
Just you wait till turn 2i! 
---
I have a golden noggenfogger and this is basically why i've never disenchanted him.
---
When I spent the dust on Rexxar, I expected him to work with all beasts. Limiting it the way they did without communication was them not selling what was advertised. The beasts are not the problem. The card is under-costed. They could bump the mana cost by 2 or remove the Consecration effect. They could make the HP cost 3. Leave the beasts alone.
---
Will you fuck off with this 
---
Someone tag the emote meta guy.
---
Unless they nerf the Dust Requirement for epics I'd rather have Fun legendaries than ubiquitous epics. As a mostly F2P player epics can get really expensive and prevents me from trying out alot of deck archetypes just because I don't have the epics needed and crafting legendaries to build deck around in helps me play a bigger variety of decks

Of course, Standard just seems nonviable due to the vast amount of money required. Baku looks like an amazing card! Ill look into the Odd Paladin deck, I've always wanted to make a paladin deck but they use to be so expensive and never unpacked good classic paladin cards.

Also have they increased the amount of gold from quests or am I just being a pleb and remembering much lower gold rewards?

NGDeathmark#1405 NA, 80g quest trade.
---
I'm online right now
---
I understand his frustration, and also sympathise with his hatred of Big Priest. However, his behaviour throughout the entire match was disgusting in my opinion because his opponent had done nothing wrong, of course they will play big priest if it gives them the highest chance of winning a tournament with a $30 000 prize pool. 
---
I also disagree that he didn't intentionally try to stall the game out, however I also acknowledge that I have no hard proof - you could be right, it might be an accident that happened to work out for him. However, I know if I tilted out and ragequit after a high stakes game and then realised I had kept my opponent waiting while I had a tantrum, I would sincerely apologise and even feel a bit ashamed - not type MB LOL and gleefully gloat to my chat about it. Also, why would he log back in if he had really just ragequit, if not to avoid the penalties associated with disconnecting for more than 5 minutes?
---
In the end though, it would still be unacceptable if he was doing this in front of 1 or 2 viewers, or even off stream - but the fact that someone like this is sponsored by Fade2Karma is eyeboggling to me.
---
Just steal the DK, lol.
---
Was it with that one card buff that brings a minion back to life at 1 health?
---
Witchwood no hesitation
---
We prefer the term cardtypically challenged.
---
get the new "new player bundle" they updated it so you can get it even if you got the old one
---
otherwise i'd wait til April and get the new release
---
if you insist on buying something now, I'd say of the sets that will stay after 4/2019, witchwood is easily the strongest
---
Nah, I agree with Control not being very mature in that situation, however it wasn't as bad as you describe it. Some people get more emotional about their loses, it's just the way they are. It was very professional from his opponent to wait even though he clearly won, I admire that.

*Hey Mom, grab the camera so I can be the thousandth person to show Stonehill Defender offering three great picks for Paladin!!*
---
Ah shit. C’mon, control, what the fuck? 
---
It’s really down to luck. Try to curve out, control the board. Down to the wire, she will run out of minions and only have spells. 
---
There’s one in particular that makes a mega minion with stats the size of the mana of all her spells. If you can, save a removal for that. She will give it mega windfury and kill you. 
---
There is one spell that I was able to get called Amalgamate, which destroys the whole board and makes a minion with stats of all the minions. That would be useful at the very end of the fight after she has created hers
---
I'm not sure you know what tempo is at all, and it's really odd that your reply is so confident given that lack of crucial information.
---
Because in card form they might gain value. Cards get nerfed and raise in dust value. Dust stays dust.
---
So in general, only dust cards if you need the dust.

Trading 80 on EU, Snake#21590

I wish I could explain masses of Standard players who don't play the game professionally how fun Wild format is and how much more variety there is even months after new expansion.

Being a Wild player for a while now, I honestly couldn't play a single month against same three top tier decks starting on rank 20.

You mean people getting faux-outraged on behalf of others? No thanks. That's a punk-ass attempt at witchhunt.
---
The opponent literally said "its cool". Case closed.
---
FUCK yes I was thinking of that one! I disenchanted him back when I was really bad at hearthstone and thought 400 dust was basically everything
---
I dont really get it. He was salty on his stream, and then seemed genuinely sorry that he forgot about no diconnect in friendly games. I think you are exaggerating.
---
turn 6 actually 
---
I play odd pally and sunkeeper has won me so many games. I fucking love that card. I get mad when I don't get it as a stonehill option. 
---
If you want to be perfectly technical, in the first clip he engaged in minor Unsporting Conduct per section 7.12 of the Tournament Handbook "Excessive Swearing or Profanity" by saying "fuck you", "fuck this guy" in reference to his opponent multiple times, and then yelling "this game's shit". 
---
He literally disconnected intentionally, and anyone who's played hearthstone for a few weeks (let alone every day for years like Control has) knows that quitting the game leaves your opponent waiting for a few more minutes before showing the "your opponent left" screen, and if it's done intentionally it's never in good spirit.
---
As for streamers getting mad and complaining after a BS loss, that's really not relevant and you know it because there's a difference between getting mad about a loss and then handling your emotions maturely, compared to getting mad about a loss and taking it out on your opponent in an extremely unsportsmanlike and distasteful manner.
---
You're right, I don't like the guy. I don't like him precisely because he does stuff like what I've outlined in my post and again in this comment. 
---
If you don't like this post, hide and ignore.

---
Leave jesse alone dude. He is a good lad. Also, fuck big priest
---
&gt; Then I have been extremly unlucky.
---
No, stop. Cant you stop and think that maybe you just played bad? You said in other comment that you are relatively new. Maybe the card buckets you chose were bad, maybe you didnt realized of plays you could do that would give you the win. There are so many variables you arent even conscius yet, but you still blame rng for that.
---
It doesnt matter if she plays Alternate timeline, its perfectly possible to beat her when she plays that (I beated her first time and she played it once against me that time).
---
&gt; 50% of the games I got horrible draws or misplayed (unlucky, but ok)
---
Misplays are your fault, and yours only. Bad draws when having a mulligan phase and a deck creation trough the entire run means you chose bad buckets and had a bad curve/inconsistent strategy. I understand it can be bad luck in the buckets you get offered, but as i said before, this pve mode has been played extensively by many players, and its perfectly possible to beat it a high percentage of the time. Im still sure it was mostly your own fault that you lost. You will beat her once you realize this and start looking at what could have you done to improve your chances to win, instead of blaming it in something you have no way to change (RNG and luck).
---
If your standard only, then craft neither.  If wild Sonya is a nice one where I play her in Big rouge,Jade's, Death rattle Nzoth.  I can honestly say I never play Edwin now.  Having one giant creature isn't as sure win like it used to be.
---
I'm not really triggered, I just hope that people realise this kind of behaviour is unacceptable in the tournament scene. 
---
He can recharge it with that much POWER.
---
Even though Liadrin is in the cover, it's actually Maiev's intro video, he's confused because I guess he didn't know Maiev has a video, your confused before you thought he was talking about LIadrin
---
You even have enough information about how to add a deck tracker to your game, you have that level of understanding. 
---
But you can't take a screenshot?
---
Regardless of this incident I'm glad that fratboy didn't make the finals.
---
No, it is not easier. You're just ignorant on how to do it more efficiently. 
---
Probably get away kodo, the redemption secret, and the spell that gives deathrattle: summon the minion with 1 hp. I should try building the deck again to see if its as good to complete "play paladin cards" quests as it was before.
---
So playing a dominant class with DK Rexxar plus 29 cards that don't matter you beat a guy trying to enjoy Warlock before all Warlock decks die with rotation.
---
Best paladin card
---
I feel this game left you cold.
---
Wached his stream once. Our world is dying with this kind of guy. Just ignore him. He is just stupid. 
---
\&gt;He is a good lad
---
I'd beg to differ based on what I've seen from his last stream, but if you have evidence to the contrary please divulge.
---
FvckAIIah #1809 NA.
---
Yea Tarim is garbage he keeps turning my 8/8s into wimpy 3/3s
---
In general yes, but certainly not now when they are about to announce cards going to Hall of Fame.
---
As a ps4 player, I support this.
---
I think the other issue around resurrect is the form of the minion that Barnes summoned. The point of Barnes is to cheat out a minion with good text, not stats. You shouldn't be able to resurrect the full stat version of that minion. Any of these cards that are "summon an x/x version of a minion" shouldn't enable broken resurrection antics. A resurrected Barnes target should still be a 1/1.
---
Instructions unclear please advise
---
&gt; and mtg
---
In theory, it should be simple, but somehow WotC makes it way too complicated to know what's standard legal.
---
I am currently on a roughly/probably one year break from another game. The moment I log in I will definitely have the most up to date equipment and cleared all fights. I am certain of this.
---
There's always the chance someone doesn't know what Celestia does and they drop their Ysera :P
---
oh man, Un'goro was the first expansion I experienced and has some of my favorite cards. can't believe it's already been 2 years. 
---
Lyra... no.... 
---
Even if you tried, you would randomly disenchant something else.
---
Or because you might disenchant another random card
---
I think you're blowing this way out of proportion, man. "MB LOL" is pretty tame.
---
The fact that you readily admit you have no hard proof he did it intentionally would make me rethink having posted this in the first place. HS drama tends to be pretty tame but gee whiz, this is a big nothingburger that you're trying to stir up.
---
Also, you complain about his fans brigading. Guy gets like 150 viewers, that's not a brigade, it's a book club. He seems like a shit but I feel like you're overreacting. 
---
Unless you have plans for sonya in wild then edwin is the obvious craft here

I don't enjoy priest at all either, it seems to be a one trick pony (stall and OTK) and I just can't see myself ever investing in the class.  I do like their 1/3 one drop and mind control for casual when I get the quest but don't see myself investing in a priest deck unless they get some kind of attrition style option in the future.  I don't mind mage so much but also find it kind of "blah" to play though odd mage looks sort of fun.
---
Not as dramatic but got my first win off an ectomancy filling my board as well, fun for you, not for opponent (it was a mirror match too)
---
Yeah seems this sub picks and chooses when to enforce that rule.  
---
3 hours old this thread is - how is it still up?  
---
zmora#2288 \[EU\] Trade 80g quest. You first.
---
They really should nerf it as soon as rotation hits because I am sick AF of seeing my decks nerfed :(.
---
Kobold is a two part battlecry and the drawing of the card happens before the damage to the hero. With Power Word Shield the card draw is the last half of the two part function and thus does not trigger the spellstone. 
---
Kill yourself
---
Zentimo is a weeb ay "sorry 02"
---
Because the kobold draws the card then damages you. The spellstone isn’t in your hand when you cast power word shield. 
---
&gt;He really, really, really, really hates Big Priest  
---
So? If you're the self proclaimed best wild player in the world ... you play around it. ;)
---
Yeah, and at the very least it forces them to play around it if they have a big guy. 
---
The best advice I ever got was "don't craft cards, craft full (or nearly full) decklists
---
I always told people craft baku but I'd wait and see if they get nerfed after rotation first
---
A man can dream!
---
Even if this was relevant, what's the point in a clickbait title when the thumbnail literally shows it's nothing to do with it
---
I've been playing since GvG but I never had more fun in this game than I did right when KOTFT came out. No one knew how to use the cards and it was awesome.
---
Kobold says: Draw then take damage.
---
PWS says: Buff then draw. 
---
That’s a cool list. Thanks for sharing!
---
Kobold Librarian does his battlecry in two steps
---
1. Draw a card
---
2. Do 2 damage to your hero
---
So first he draws the Lesser Amethyst Spellstone and then he does the damage, doing 2 damage
---
Power Word: Shield works differently
---
1. Gives 2+ health
---
2. Draws a card
---
When it draws Lesser Diamond Spellstone, its casting ends, so it doesn't upgrade it since it already happened and it doesn't count 
---
How’d that Mind Blast in yo ass feel
---
This is why I don't watch streaming in the first place.  
---
Too many edgey fuckwits.  But hey, apparently many of the less mature audience like this sort of thing. ;)

r/customhearthstone really loves cards that are either complex or unique, has great flavor, or has good art.

Just terminal.
---
Casual 5 legendary draft
---
Lol the card text is great, I’m probably not going to be able to unsee him as huge whenever he comes up in my rogue rumble runs from now on
---
Normally I would choose **Sunkeeper Tarim**, but we already have too many six drops, and we really need an eight drop, so I pick **The Lich King**.
---
Wait for the rotation to play ladder. Meta is not that great rn. But there’s probably 2 months worth of solo adventures that you can do.

This information is false. Can the mods do something about this?

I never got to coin Thekal so I had to settle for a turn 3 Thekal into two Giants. My Even Shaman opponent (pre-nerf) dutifully conceded.
---
I don't want to spend money on game, so i have to craft him, if i want to have him in collection 
---
To my knowledge, Kripp doesn't do it directly to anyone he knows, nor does he do it in a tournament setting.  Pretty sure he does it on purpose now on stream for viewer entertainment.
---
OP, you're a piece of shit. No one likes hall monitors. Go kick rocks or something instead of trying to get people kicked off their teams and banned from events. You're an ugly and small individual. 
---
I completely agree. The common and the rares are way way more useful from witchwood.
---
How many brain cells died for you to think anything you said in this thread is meaningful or witty?
---
Thanks mate, my friend Player671 was really worrying about their decks and trying to find out counterpicks
---
I’d eat that shit. Too lazy to make it tho.
---
This is a complete overreaction as well as a massive exaggeration.
---
Part of what OP has said is not even true.
---
Also looking how he has responded to others in this thread should show that he should not be taken seriously.
---
Mods this is a poor attempt to witch hunt and hurt another player because OP got triggered.

I hope this post gets taken down.

If you craft Kel'Thuzad, you have to play the Big decks (Big Priest, Big Rogue, Big Warlock, Big Druid, etc.) Those are loads of fun.
---
To be fair, Tink exists.
---
no zilliax lol, trash card
---
Hooktusk is also pretty good. In tempo rogue the winrate for getting it in your opening mulligan was better than keleseth.
---
I did give it a Flair. Check again.
---
I just started seeing this deck on the ladder 
---
Loses to a smart CW player 
---
No, because i like to play wild more then  standard, because as bad as one turn kills are and how out of control combo or infinite value decks are i can at least play with counters to them..
---
 Like taking a weblord if im facing a lot of shudderwocks, or playing singleton deathrattle priest to piss off aggro players.  And who maybe someday blizzard will put old wild cards into standard again with a rotating classic set like every single pro player has said needs to happen to fix the classic problem.
---
It'd be the most expensive thing ever in hearthstone. You couldn't afford a house if you bought this.
---
50% it either happens or it doesn't. Obviously 
---
Oof
---
Oh no, that’s unfortunate! However, that matchup is favored according to HSReplay. The best way to win against Warrior is to either find an opportunity to Cube the Mech Whelps, or to do a ton of damage with Cube on Devilsaurs. It’s a tricky matchup, but rewarding when you win :)
---
Any cards that limits deck building with a huge upside where most decks on ladder are slight variations of net-decks means the deck-building restrictions are negated.    
---
So cards like the princes, baku/Genn etc. Don’t actually have a downside, they either make a broken deck or they are quest hunter.  There’s no choices there, the deck is pretty much already built, it’s either good or it’s bad.    
---
I play hearthstone to deck-build, it used to be my favourite part of the game. Pre-built otk packages playing Rock Paper Scissors on ladder with pre-built hero/quest/odd/even/only spells hunter is not fun.   
---
There have always been synergies that we’re fairly obvious but now we are really spoon fed, the first iteration of this was C’thun but it felt a cool idea at the time to have this one archetype/deck for new players that was pre-built but It started getting out of control in mean streets when they turned Reno from a cool card into 3 pre-built decks +jade/goons, since then they have continued down this route with lots of different pre-built decks that give the illusion of choice but quest rogue has 26 cards that always need to be played.  
---
I feel like the last expac was pretty good because there was less of that(make an argument for zul’jin) but the whole standard rotation is clogged full of it and Wild is even worse. Next expac please no pre-built decks.
---
Um, even when I play off-meta decks I am only one half of the game. I can be all kinds of innovative and special, but the meta will still feel stale if I play against the same tier decks all the time.
---
Pretty much everything I see on pinterest fits this description

I won't dust anything until I need the dust to craft whatever meme legendary I decide to make a deck around.
