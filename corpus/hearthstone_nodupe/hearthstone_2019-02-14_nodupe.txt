You already saving up for the next expansion?

I mean, you can look at the numbers. Shareholders want growth. Bliztivision has been growing. The only way to really grow further is cut on expenditure. They do make mountains more money year after year, including the new CFO with a new 15 million dollar bonus just for joining.
---
Because it costs them money. They have to use these numbers to determine if this makes casuals play more (resulting in them buying more card packs). If it does, they‚Äôll continue to do it. If it makes people play more but pay less, they‚Äôll stop. 
---
the shark
---
I saw someone with over 30k on twitch a couple of days ago, so yeah, I‚Äôm sure lots of people have over 10k. Still awesome though, 100 lovely packs for you next set, even more since we‚Äôre still a couple months away.
---
I‚Äôm at 6k myself, closing in on my usual goal (80 packs per expansion) 
---
Because you can only hold 10 cards in hand.
---
The playoffs were mostly in non-dev positions.
---
The jop openings are mostly artists, testers, designers and programmers. And I presume having 140 openigns is not related to the layoffs and they usually have many open positions
---
Working as expected I'd think.

I don't see what's subjective in a 50% stock drops + layoffs + the bad press. But yeah sure it's me being all "subjective" and the outlook is really great. Get outta here clown!

2/2/3 Mech | Your Mechs cost (1) less.  
---
[https://hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net/downloads/) does it, download their app, link your account on the site and once it's done your collection should be sync'd with the online deck lists, and so should the dust prices be. there's even a "decks you can build" link to click on the homepage which shows only the decks that would cost 0 dust
---
My understanding for some of those legendaries is I have to complete the that content to get some of the legendaries. I can‚Äôt remember which deck I was trying to craft but it wasn‚Äôt an option to make some of the legendaries. 
---
Watched some old trump review videos for the lulz today, and found out dead mans hand never had a good winrate. What? Is this true? 
---
DMH Warrior is probably the single strongest deck I‚Äôve ever played. Losing coldlight was a big hit, but I still play it to this very day. It‚Äôs still completely viable.
---
How did a deck that was one of the most brokenly strong decks I‚Äôve ever played, that is viable years later, never have a good winrate?
---
Ohhhhh right, I forgot this is hearthstone. And you lot are far and away the dumbest community of people in the history of gaming. And that something simple like DMH warrior would completely destroy your tiny, tiny brains.

 YOU FACE JARAXXUS

&gt;I never lose, I just chose not to win
---
Even her concede quote is so much better. 
---
I hate conceding for example with Rexxar because he says
---
"Well fought. I concede." But sometimes they just were really lucky to win so it feels bad having to congratulate the opponent. 
---
You never played with any other class?
---
Yes, it is made up. While there are some women who believe the most important thing a woman can be is desired by men, you gave zero proof as to how many. 
---
And more importantly, you gave zero proof  that the women who do slutmog do so because they think that is necessary "in order to be wanted and desired all".
---
&gt;You, however, are making unfounded blanket statements
---
What unfounded statements?
---
&gt;No it's not OK at all. Though likewise midrange/aggro type decks can get that same feeling against control decks after a few turns depending on RNG.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I guess against true control decks you can adapt a deck to combat it but many of the decks people are calling control right now are combo/otk in of themselves or can make a single play that can flip the game to the hope of no return that it mgiht as well be an OTK.  
---
&gt;Priest with Mindblast, Mage with Jaina, Warlock with Guldan/cubes, Hunter with Rexxar (not as massively as much of a swing play but more of a long term inevitable loss if your control without resources to put on the board).
---
&gt;Interesting point to single out OTK when you can get that same feeling playing against control decks too.  Clear, clear, clear ... big minion time if not "I win" combo.  
---
&gt;That's not fun to play against nor is it often interactive.  
---
&gt;An example would be running a midrange hunter deck ... the only answer to beat the likes of odd warriors shouldn't be incredible luck of playing infinite value rexxar ...
---
I'm sorry, how do you propose a control deck actually *wins*? You think big minions aren't interactive. You think face burn over a few turns isn't interactive. You think cards that generate massive value swings aren't interactive. You think that just lasting until fatigue isn't interactive. So what win condition for a control deck would actually be "fair and interactive" according to your standards? 
---
SMOrc NICELY DONE
---
Is this supposed to refute /u/kinglordnonk‚Äôs statement?
---
Sounds like something a Little Mac main would say
---
Not a good look when someone decides to return after not playing in a couple years, only to open 6 packs with not even so much as an epic or a pack with more than one rare.
---
Ah yes these are shrine bosses 1 and 2. Next week should be 3, 4, 5.
---
Should someone like me, who hasn't put any money into the game, be able to build literally all decks (literally every single deck seeing play, including all off-meta budget busters like nerfed OTK Paladin)?  If that's your minimum for playing as a f2p then even most paying players can't "compete."
---
Again, ladder would still exist.  How would I as a f2p player lose the ability to play competitively if an additional format is added?  The only thing that would happen is that I would have EXTRA avenues for competitive play, not less.  It is only a positive.
---
I love the idea of a sideboard. My only issue with that is the fact that unfortunately in some match ups the difference between a win or a loss is exactly one card. So I think that sideboard will make some epic aggro/tempo/midrange mirrors, but will make combo/control players miserable: 
---
Just to clarify, I meant that they have done *nothing* with a tournament mode in 5 years, they've obviously done other things in that time. And my point is they don't think a tournament mode is worth their time because they think other things would be better for Hearthstone, possibly due to its casual nature.
---
I am still unclear on your posistion. Are you saying they *are* working on a Tournament Mode and they just haven't told us about it? Because I'd love for you to be right, but I just don't think that thinking is realistic.
---
Magic seems to be dealing with this currently as they try to make single matches relevant because of Arena. From what I understand, there's an increased number of meta relevant modal cards (aka Choose One cards) in recent sets which enable players to run typical sideboard abilities like enchantment removal in their main decks since they're attached to cards that have more generally useful options as well.

That's also how it is in other card games.
---
MtG has cards like Blood Moon, Surgical Extraction, Leyline of Sanctity, Pithing Needle and a myriad other cards that can quite easily determine games on their own.

This shit ruins so many of my shrine runs too. 
---
How have you not completed lunara yet?
---
Yeah guy who went first rekt me and snowballed from there. 
---
no....  they are hiring game developers and they fired non game development (e.g. marketing, esports) positions yesterday.
---
they are reallocating resources.
---
dont know if it works this way in rumble run, but i used hellfire with the warlock shrine, it did 6 damage to me (makes sense 3health cost, 3 damage from spell) but i killed my shrine and it also cost me the 3 mana. i figured if it did 3 damage for the cost, then also costing 3 mana is a bug.
---
&gt; Actually build a board throughout the game whilst maintaining control? Thus offering something to interact with. This whole "do nothing but clear until the end" mentality is incredibly boring.
---
Dragon Priest is a deck based around that. Odd Quest Warrior is based around that. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Blizzard only made them because it‚Äôs more profitable to add more cards than to give dust refunds for the popular op cards.
---
I keep saying this.
---
We praise Brode, but I honestly think he was responsible for a lot of this mess. Year of the Raven in my opinion is a success! It just isn't successful right now because the other stuff is just too ridiculously op. If we want hearthstone to devolve further, than Raven would have had to overshadow Mammoth... and that would be a slippery slope.
---
Both of the legendaries in it are good on their own, it‚Äôs just that surrender to madness is such a shit card that it spreads it‚Äôs tendrils of garbage to Bwonsamdi and Zihi.
---
That‚Äôs a hell of a pack. Don‚Äôt dust that doomsayer!  Probably not this year, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if it got nerfed or HOF‚Äôd someday. 
---
How have you not played any standard games (or at least mot won any)

They finally started putting event quests in their own slot.
---
You can actually have a pretty fun time with that quest if you go for an infinite shadow visions miracle deck. You just gotta make sure you draw 2 radiant elemental before you draw two shadow visions and you‚Äôre good.
---
No it should be "to each his or her own"
---
/s
---
I hit an rng miracle and pulled 8 mana‚Äôs worth of shadow visions
---
Nope, wall priest is cancer. A lot of priest decks are.  And it‚Äôs funny because they seemed to nerf hunter for over-representation in the meta, while now it‚Äôs just changed to priest. People argue that there are different priest archetypes which is true, but it‚Äôs the same as it was with hunter. And before that it was the same with Druid. I‚Äôm just starting to wonder if we‚Äôre always going to have this cycle. If so, it‚Äôs really unhealthy for the long term life of this game. It‚Äôs not fun to play when it‚Äôs like this. 
---
All these heroes should be permanent skins. Like why not let us use them? They have full hero powers and voice lines and everything already done.
---
The audio assets have been made optional on mobile devices. Go to options in the in-game menu, and you should see a prompt to download the audio assets.
---
I think the point a lot of people are trying to make, is that in fantasy tropes women are always drawn as sexy and in more revealing clothing or clothing that highly accentuates their body more then their male counterparts. I mean look at almost any fantasy representation of a female knight and she will be wearing half the armor of a similar sized male and for some reason her boobs need special niches in the armor to stick out in even though it is completely impractical. I mean even both Jaina and Valeera are drawn in poses where they are curving their backs to stick out their chests, and have clothing that further highlights them in case you missed.  I‚Äôm not saying this is bad to do for one or two characters if you write a plausible reason they might dress that way, but when it is your only two free female heros and their male counterparts have more traditional or lore fitting clothing it kind seems unbalanced don‚Äôt you think? 
---
I know the cards themselves have a wider representation of character types and their are alternative hero‚Äôs to purchase but these are the only female characters to play as for F2P players.
---
Judge me by my size do you?
---
Living in Irvine is probably twice as expensive as Columbus so the pay won't be nearly as high.
---
I'm not going to advocate for companies uprooting their entire staff, but the amount of extra money they could make if they moved out of places like NY and Cali is pretty large, they could just moved to other warm weather climates like Az or Tx. Your recruiting benefits for the younger crowd won't change and the cost of operations is much lower, not to mention you can pay staff less money while still increasing their spending power.
---
Or they could be new?
---
Without combo decks, Odd warrior would likely be the best deck in the meta, and even now they're quite strong. 
---
If you think combo decks are boring, strong control decks will actually bore you out of your mind if you queue into them with an aggro/midrange deck.
---
Meta is boring for a whole lot of reasons, and combo decks being strong is just a symptom of how weak aggro is now since the archetype took so many nerfs (It's actually seriously making me lose confidence in the balancing team but that's neither here nor there)
---
Should cut back on finance, those fuckers are just vultures that get in the way of the development staff anyways.
---
At least no DK.....
---
Never heard of Rust?
---
The meta is much more diverse atm, at least from my experience. I see a fair share of priests, mages, warriors, paladins, warlocks, rogues and druids. Still, similarly to the OP, I don‚Äôt enjoy the games as much.

On October 12, 1998, Wizards of the Coast released a little set called Urza's Saga. A number of the powerful cards in this set and the previous ones were either mana producers, card draw engines, or ways to spend a bunch of mana to win the game. 
---
It turns out when you combine those three things, you get an absolute monster. The most famous example is probably the infamous 1998 Academy deck, often considered the single most broken standard deck in Magic history. It worked by playing a bunch of cheap 0 mana artifacts, Tolarian Academy (a land that taps for mana equal to the number of artifacts), a bunch of cards that untap Tolarian Academy, and card draw. Its win condition was forcing the opponent to draw their entire deck in one turn so they instantly lose. Academy could easily win on turn 1 or 2. 
---
I like how [this article](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/evolution-of-magic-banned-and-restricted-combo-winter) described combo winter.
---
&gt; People would joke that early game was the coin toss, mid game was the mulligan decision and late game was turn 1.
---
Rush Warrior is great, I've played it quite a bit since the new set dropped too. I think the main issue is just that it's too expensive (a lot of legendaries that don't see play in other decks), and other decks do what it does just as well too.
---
I play Lich King and Akali in mine, and the Corpsetaker package (my choices were Sunwalker and Storm Watcher).

Absolutely. I've seen a few restructures happen at the places I've worked, but none as ruthless as this one. Not even close.

---
[removed]
---
As far as I know you were playing vs paladin and the card is called "sound the bells" it gives +1/2 and has echo for 2 mana... Now in order to steal that from your opponents class you would have had to be playing priest or rogue and to go infinite with it you pretty much had to be priest. Anyway to answer your question: yes you could have gone infinite with that card.
---
No. 
---
Yeah, that would be stupid. 
---
DUUUUDE

---
I was so over whelmed as a casual player when I logged on today and saw 4 quest, so I just uninstalled the game
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs Rank floors at 20/15/10/5 and Legend. You can‚Äôt go back to previous ranks once you reach them. 
---
9/10 of my matches are against priest doing some resurrect bs, the other games are against hunter. This meta is not just stale, it‚Äôs fossilized. 
---
You would just ban your worst matchup class and have an easier climb.
---
It‚Äôs not gonna happen.
---
Yeah but everyone would so everyone would climb then?
---
If you try to reroll a quest, though, it deletes it. 
---
No hard numbers obviously but Blizzards financial reports and all the indicators pointing downwards (google trends, twitch, youtube, unique visitors on sites like hearthpwn etc.). Also Iksar expressing concern over this.
---
All that would be used for is taking away your deck's most prevalent bad match-up, artificially increasing you winrate while also make getting into a game take noticeably longer.
---
I mean, you can technically ban any deck using say Blood Moon when playing a Tron deck in Magic or any deck playing Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring in Yugioh, but you would have to take a loss whenever you do.
---
We Guldan now
---
Besides the point. Bans are fine in tournaments, on Ranked you should be able to queue into anything to keep winrate % in check.
---
Not saying I wouldn‚Äôt love it, specially now so I could ban the annoying priests, but it‚Äôs just not healthy for Ranked overall.
---
Yeah but then your opponent could also be banning their worst matchup too right? Then you also don't really have to worry about playing against "broken decks/classes" (like druid a few months ago). About the queue times, idk I play League and have sat through 15 minute queue times so an extra like minute or 30s or whatever shouldn't be that big of an issue. Also if you notice your queue times being to long, then switch classes right?

---
My position is they know exactly what they are doing and are making the best judgement call with the information they have. And if they don't, they will quickly be snuffed out by good ole free market capitalism and replaced by people who can do the job better. 
---
Idk I found it really helpful in LoL. Being able to ban your worst matchup in LoL but that doesn't necessarily mean your win rate is inflated because there are usually more than just 1 counter to your deck. 
---
In any other card game, you can't just refuse to play against a particular kind of deck without taking losses. 
---
At least in a competitive environment, you shouldn't be able to influence your match-ups in a way that doesn't involve how you've been playing up to that point.
---
If you have prince liam you can play a liam+hakkar deck and bonus point for the hakkar card back 
---
Tedious.
---
$10 well spent
---
But they already do this in a competitive environment (ie tournaments). Choosing your deck, the cards in your deck and a matchup you don't want to play against gives further options for players to express their skill.

If there were 100 classes then I could see this being an argument.. 
---
You misspelled 10 of my 100 armor points *laughs in odd warrior*
---
Lol has 143 characters and 10 bans. So yeah if HS had like 14 classes it'd be easier but I don't think 1 ban makes it that bad. It also gives the balance team real data for which classes need to be nerfed/buffed(for future expansions) and why.
---
Removing people from non dev positions. Adding more people to dev positions.
---
No wait, I tried it again, you were right.
---
Nothing, I was wrong.  
---
I'd argue the deck exists because it's possible to consistently get more than 2 copies of a spell (particularly Mind Blast).
---
Duskbreaker isn't anything like a build-around.

2/2/1 | Battlecry: Silence an enemy minion with Taunt.  
---
There's actually the MLG arena in Columbus: see the Black ops 4 CWL that's going on from now until August.
---
BM?
---
I‚Äôm on my sixth win currently and I‚Äôm now in rank 6. I‚Äôm nervous for my next two games why did you have to tel me that I don‚Äôt lose stars at rank 5 lol
---
Bad manners. 
---
Body and effect, 2 very different things. Silence a minion works for buffed stuff, not just taunts. For 2 more mana it‚Äôs just a better card overall. 
---
It is all about sending a message.
---
Lotis Greetings emote is just an inferior Anduins Greetings and it is rated waaayyy too high compared to our boy
---
Oh come on. The concede quote being positive is a wonderful part of the game. Always be sportsmanlike, my dude.
---
Hahaha I‚Äôm sorry, but you‚Äôve got this. Keep your head in the game and you‚Äôll get there! Best of luck. 
---
Spellbreaker can just more. He silences a minion without taunt e.g. the Cube and makes it useless.
---
Shieldbreaker is a cheap black knight in my eyes because the taunt even stay. Cool the Lich king has no taunt more but he's still a 8/8 on the board
---
Bitch this is a BM thread 
---
Pirate Warrior in wild runs Shieldbreaker, I believe. 
---
I‚Äôd be on board with this. Hooktusk is the only rogue that isn‚Äôt  a grimmdark mascara hooker.

Mother fucker I am allowed an opinion even if it's unpopular

Can confirm, I did one greetings and it ended up being a 25 minute game. Don't mess with this guy.

been trying priest after i got wrecked by one, i dont have have anything good fro the shrine.

i could win yesterday against mage who bm me, but he summon rag 3 times so i lost (im playing priest)
---
in BM culture, this is considered a dick move
---
HIGH QUALITY SHIT POST
---
*laughs in 6 reaper*
---
You sound really upset for someone who doesn‚Äôt care.
---
Yeah I saw people commenting the like, but then a lot of people thought that aggro mostly uses silence for taunt anyway so Shieldbreaker was a good mana cheap option.
---
I'll have to look at the lists. Thanks.
---
Bad Manners, ie spamming emotes, roping, slow rolling you for no reason, killing your board when they already have lethal, etc.
---
I've been pretty succesful against it with control mage.
---
The combination of polymorph, meteor, and blizzard does well.
---
I run two keysmiths, who can drop a vaporise/mirror image too.

Nothing better than seeing their resurrect turn up nothing useful.

I mean... they'll never do it because she'll be old news soon and they never planned for it in the first place. That being said she is the best and deserves a spot alongside Houndmaster Shaw
---
My 3 games just now. 
---
Won Hunter vs Hunter. 
---
Won Rogue vs Hunter.
---
Won Shaman vs Priest.
---
The hunter I focused on his totem early and traded often while pinging face.  Saved my traps for late game against his big minions (king krush/savannah highmane)
---
The Rogue game I had an easy time by flooding the board.  The thing is they always have stealth.  Always.  Even if they attack.  So just flood the board with pirates, attack face.  I may have gotten lucky but I think like you said Hunter was bad.
---
Shaman game was against priest.  I spammed all my overload early on and filled my hand.  Took out their totem early so they couldn't get many spells. Got behind a wall of frogs.   Got really lucky with Murrloc synergy.  Finished him with Old Murk Eye
---
Why is it unethical for a company to change THEIR OWN CONTENT? Was it your intellectual property they altered. Were they your tits?
---
I'm starting to think 2 mana isn't much in hearthstone. In MtG (where I'm originally from) 2 mana is a million. I need a bit of an adjustment I think.
---
Don't do it! Your gonna make him uninstall
---
Good! Eat it for contributing to the netdeck plague.
---
If it only happened once or twice in a game, they may have alt-tabbed or be busy with something else. If it happens consistently, they're likely griefing.
---
Oh ok. These seem to be meta considerations I am yet to encounter being a big old scrub. Thanks.
---
Priest can be nasty too. If they get down two Radiant Elementals with the totem up it's GG
---
Wow
---
Someone who can compete with the orbit commercial girl
---
I think it's just the deck creator called it wall priest, and the name caught on.
---
Lol, I love Maiev but you‚Äôre right, rogue needs some different energy to it.
---
Haven't played HS in a while but I came across the post. I'd say "taunt" relies on summoning taunt minions with good stats per mana and effects, while "wall" relies on summoning, buffing and resurrecting big, beefy taunt minions. Many taunt vs Big taunt.

Take you friends with the artists? Did he/she tell you this? I want screenshots.

It‚Äôs not about running it faster. It‚Äôs about the initial download size. The best way to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù the download size is by cutting stuff that aren‚Äôt essential to run the game (but still have a huge file size) to a separate in-game download, like sound. Which is exactly what they‚Äôre doing. 
---
Don‚Äôt blame your lack of understanding of how software works on Blizzard. 
---
Running faster has nothing to do with how much space the game takes up. 
---
Someone's gotta play Jek'lik against Kripp and spam threaten the entire game.
---
This sub said the exact same thing when for example Reno rotated or when Patches and Jade rotated. "Now this time, it's gonna be good. The OP cards are rotating, it's gonna feel fresh again"... A few months later we got the same old complaints about how stale the meta is. Mark my words, it's going to be the exact same thing this year. The first two months everybody will be psyched and after that we will have the exact same moping like we always do in this sub. Nothing will change, it Blizzard doesn't radically change the system.
---
I just got back into hearthstone. I gotta remember this one lol

playing hearthstone?
---
The icy winds of Norweigh will consume your soul!
---
Probably because they were tri-class heroes? It's very understandable why they wouldn't want to have the same hero on 3 classes, that's just confusing. Adding that in with death knights and changing hero powers, oof.

Oddest thing bro, its more played in wild since its a 2 drop and works better with the older aggro cards and more things have taunt in wild so it hits more than standard.  In standard its better to have a generic silence.
---
Yes, that's why Medivh and Maeve are so unpopular. But Shadowreaper Anduin and ZulJin feel really better when conceding 
---
Id rather just buy them. 
---
Do you actualy know what ince means or have you found this week old thread through SRD and came here just to feel superior and insult people?

Doesnt impact me at all. As long i have fun il keep playing. The Firing sucks for the people but we dont know full details. And Firing is normal for buisness espcially if its from destiny which they dont own anymore.

And again doesnt impact me

"HAPPY NEW YEAR!"

Oh so thats how its gonna be huh? Wishing me happy new year just like that ya piece of crap? ITS ROPIN TIME

BY THE HOLY LIGHT!

Psssht, I will take bad manners over every other hearthstone player playing an overused, unoriginal net deck any day of the week.
---
Probably wasn‚Äôt at the beginning of the game. 
---
you drop it on 1 or you are no tru SMOrc 
---
You shouldnt have won. You took 50% for lethal when you had a 100% lethal in your hand.

It's about sending a massage 
---
Blizzard is really bad at making ‚Äúfun‚Äù decks. Priest is clearly the best one by a long shot in this tavern brawl.
---
Me too!
---
What are you applying for?
---
Dragging your turns as long as you can until the timer expires
---
The burning rope is your timer. He lets it tick down and slows the game to a halt.
---
On the one hand, they'd be kinda wierd, since all of them already have cards, especially Zul'jin. On the other hand, I WANT THEM! 
---
When the rope appears for the turn timer countdown
---
This is incorrect, on two accounts.
---
The HOF cards (if there are any) will likely be announced in late February, [just like last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/80ojbd/the_year_of_the_raven_soars_ahead/).
---
They will be officially inducted into the hall of fame when the new set releases and the year turns, as it has been for the past two years, not a week before release.
---
/u/Swagwala 
---
Letting the time run down. The rope burns when you have 15 seconds left in your turn.  
---
Why should they? Just because you are triggered by it existing as much as they got triggered (and forgot by now) about an in game art changed after 6 years, because soccer moms compained?
---
Never clicking the Done button and just letting time go by and the rope burn out, so the game is as long and boring as possible.
---
obligatory "uhhhh the art is actually chillmaw, not sindragosa, you **fool**"
---
Hoping for either initial design or mission design. I screwed up and forgot to submit a custom card with my application (LOL), so I had to submit a support ticket to cancel my application and resubmit. 
---
The guy u/ProgramIncomplete played out did you by nearly 2000 attack, gotta bump up those number
---
Turns are limited to seventy-five seconds. A rope appears and starts burning when there are twenty seconds left.
---
"Roping" means the player takes a long enough turn that the rope appears, and in particular usually means that the player is intentionally stalling their turns to annoy the opponent. If I dropped my Chillwind Yeti in the first four seconds of the turn, but I don't pass the turn until the rope starts burning, that would be roping.
---
If anyone wants to know the exact Priest list, I believe it's this:
---

---
2x Regenerate
---
2x Test Subject
---
2x Northshire Cleric
---
2x Power Word: Shield
---
2x Divine Spirit
---
2x Shadow Visions
---
2x Radiant Elemental
---
2x Vivid Nightmare
---
2x Extra Arms
---
2x Nightmare Amalgam
---
1x Dragon Soul
---
2x Twilight Drake
---
2x Duskbreaker
---
1x Lyra the Sunshard
---
2x Power Word: Replicate
---
1x Zerek, Master Cloner
---
1x Ysera
---
I totally forgot about that since mlg isn't really a thing for PC games. I love the downvotes from my above post though, good stuff for speaking the truth.

It‚Äôs not like the two are mutually exclusive.
---

Hello there.
---
*screams in icy-dragon language*
---
I made this comment/observation back when they made the Rumble Run balance changes and I still think I'd rather have some way to earn these as alternate heros, rather than pay for them:
---
&gt; I spoke to a Hearthstone dev at BlizzCon and they mentioned that when they have voice actors come in to portray a hero, they always have them go ahead and record every single emote (even the hidden ones like "Sorry"). If that is still true, that means you have playable alternate heroes now available for every single class.
---
? Why can't they be alternate heroes for players to use? Wouldn't those unlocks be a great reward to increase replayability?
---
&gt; Since you are now tracking which shrines have gone 8/8, maybe if you beat Princess Talanji with all 8 other classes, she is unlocked and you can now play as her, and so on.
---
Plot twist: He was referring to the Hir'eek-Sanguine Reveler deck that's meta at Rank 42.
---
Yes, Wild Pirate Warrior is about the only deck that runs it. It's really only useful in aggro decks, in tempo or midrange decks you would rather have the flexibility of unconditional silence. Standard doesn't have powerful enough two drops to justify including Shieldbreaker over a Keleseth build. In Wild, the current aggro decks are Mech Hunter, Pirate Warrior, Aluneth Mage, Kingsbane Rogue and some Odd decks. Mech Hunter can't afford to run Shieldbreaker as it would compromise their mech density that allows them to close out games by turn 5. Aluneth Mage gives up the board eventually, and Rogues have Sap and Doomerang. Basically, the synergies in most decks outweigh the benefit of a Shieldbreaker.
---
They would be cast as 4/4s, however Lynessa's Battlecry would then give them +3/+3 for each instance of Dire Frenzy that you've **cast** this game. (Assuming no shenanigans, this would be two instances max.) After each instance of Dire Frenzy goes off during her battlecry, 3 4/4 Lynessas would be shuffled back into your deck.
---
TL:DR - Lynessa enters the field as a 4/4, gaining +3/+3 or +6/+6 depending on whether you've played one or both of your Dire Frenzies that game. 3 or 6 copies of Lynessa are then shuffled into your deck as 4/4s.
---
A) please stay in SRD
---
B) what if I told you that most of us wouldn't give a shit, Conan Exiles for example has dong physics. You see any dudes around crying around? 
---
You‚Äôre flat out wrong. Censorship is when someone forces YOU to stop or cover something up. If a private company changes their own model of their own free will, how tf is that censorship? I know you think it‚Äôs a bad decision, but it‚Äôs not censorship. 
---
Zoo decks can only be played in a actual Zoo. If you don‚Äôt your phone/computer will explode.
---
They're sort of correct- if you've played two Dire Frenzies then she would enter play as a 4/4 and then get +6/+6 becoming a 10/10.
---
They definitely did. Ever since "don't you guys have phones?" it's been downhill. Uninstalled d3 instantly, and moved from hs to the new ccg in the block. I am not looking back.
---
Other guys view was up here as well
---
Check the server you are logged on. 
---
Hope he doesn't do tavern brawl.  9 new characters with minimum 54 emotes to try!
---
BM when you have lethal, checkmate
---
Whoa, I literally just played against this guy today.  As soon as he got ahead in the game he BMed the rest of the match.  Total hypocrite.
---
it was a lowcost version i dont have the code anymore
---
but it was the version with the undatakah an the beetles
---
Yeah, I kinda don‚Äôt get the hardcore BM hate. Especially when it comes to like, Greetings at the start of the game and Well played at the end? I emote greetings to, yknow, greet. 
---
At the end, i emote well played, whether I know I have lethal or I suspect my opponent does. I‚Äôm expressing that I think the game was well played. I didn‚Äôt spam, I wasn‚Äôt reacting obnoxiously throughout the game. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt really raised with manners because of how my parents are, so I‚Äôve had to actively make an effort to remind myself to ask people how they are, greet them, thank them for opening doors etc. greeting in hearthstone, from my perspective, is the same thing. I like to shake hands with my opponents regardless of who they are, who won,  or what game we‚Äôre playing. is that really so offensive? 
---
F
---
Duskbreaker is a buildaround because it's the main reason the deck has a dragon theme. You include minions like   Dragonmaw Scorcher because they activate Duskbreaker. Yes, they're fine on their own, but certainly not the best option in a vacuum.
---
I do think you have a point though that being able to get multiple copies of Mind Blast (thus being able to threaten the opponent at higher life totals than 10 without Anduin) is a major part of the deck's success.
---
Dam I had that combo too but my opponent conceded before I could pull it off.
---
Who says no to Mentos
---
A) Beauty of Reddit is I can comment wherever the fuck I‚Äôd like. 
---
B) it HAD dong physics, along with breast physics. Both were removed to avoid a mature rating. 
---
Where are the games which predominantly feature Male bulges and dicks but not the same on women? As of now, there‚Äôs hundreds of games with scantily clad women that lazily appeal to the Male fantasy. 
---
Majority of decks that would want to use it are either Odd or run Keleseth
---
&gt;Bad Manners, ie spamming emotes, roping, slow rolling you for no reason, killing your board when they already have lethal, etc. 
---
&gt;~~outraged~~
---
 while Damaged 
---
That's exactly how it feels.
---
I know Zentimo has dialog for running out of cards, though...
---
I love roping my opponent to see them getting pissed off, some of them tried to rope me back, but i‚Äôm watching youtube so i don‚Äôt really care.
---
Maybe you shouldn't play competitive games if you don't like the concept of there being a meta.
---
there are laws against that.
---
I think Jara is the best at the Arena
---
How can you force something on a character who *isn't real*?
---
Man that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs from. I always just assumed it was because it was ‚Äúlike a miracle‚Äù that the combo clicked together to form something impressive. 
---
I stole his shrine with Holy Water and copied the elemental. I got cocky with it and the animations started taking reallllly long, almost didn't get the attack in.
---
was wondering what happened to my 60 gold quest. bummer. 
---
Yes that seems likely
---
Sure, Barnes or Shadow Essence gets a big drop on turn 6 or so on average and as early as turn 3 on a high roll but good agro wild decks like odd paladin, rogue, or even (2 meanings!)  Shaman (RIP flame tongue) should have you on the ropes well before that. Nothing quite like both players taking the first 6 turns off before finding out whose ludicrous upside is greater today over the course of half an hour though to warrant a (hopefully) funny whinging post.
---
Toast is an asshole.
---
If you're talking about messing up a priest's rez pool you can already do so. Play Leeroy, Marsh Drake, Gravelsnout Knight, and Hungry Ettin. No need to un-nerf a classic card to become broken again.
---
For information: If you use Potion of Madness on an enemy shrine it dies straight away on your opponent's side of the board.
---
Impossible to answer. From blizzards perspective, the game is healthy when there is a steady base of players and income. We don't know these numbers.
---
Personally, I have been very vocal that the game is not in a good state for the longest time, the lack of game modes is the biggest issue here, but I stopped bitching after jumping on the MTGA bandwagon, that game gets my ‚Ç¨ change. I still like HS, but I treat it as a good mobile game, thats that. And I abandoned eSport following since a long time in favor for LoL eSports so its really just not that much to it.
---
You‚Äôre showing your true rank 25.
---
You coin hero power for max Smorc damage. 
---
This was probably the most outrageous two turn swing I've ever been the victim of in arena. Oondasta pulled another Oondasta, which thankfully had the courtesy of pulling nothing until my opponent top decked their third on the ensuing turn. Worst part is that it completely negated my Walk the Plank!
---
These give them a bad minion to resurrect. What I mean is with Tinkmaster you can transform their Rag, Lich King, Y'Shaarj into a sheep in all 9 classses. 
---
Don't forget about that army of slivers!! 
---
If you're looking for someone to watch, Asmodai still plays hearthstone and his chat is pretty nice. 
---
Priest is also good if you summon a Ragnaros from your opponent's deck and duplicate it so you have 4 by turn 8 
---
Well here's the thing. You can play a card and not have it's battlecry trigger. Because Battlecry states "Does something when played from your hand".
---
Such movement. Many motion sickness.
---
The death knights are rotating out. That's a huge change. Maybe this is wildly optimistic....but it's possible that conserving resources and maximizing the value out of your cards becomes a thing again. 
---
As I understand it he bans a lot of people. Or others do on his behalf, not entirely sure how it works.
---
It's bad enough to that there's a post of this everyday, but this one doesn't even have a photo. Go to r/hspulls and time how long it takes for your post to get pulled down.
---
Huffers gonna huff.
---
75 seconds not 25. Rope comes at 15 seconds not 20.
---
&gt; You however provided no proof to refute it.
---
Any argument made without proof can be dismissed without proof. 
---
&gt; That makes no sense. Why is it not ok for a fictional character to show cleavage?
---
Because :
---
&gt; That is why it's ok for a girl to wear slutmogs mogs but an issue for a fictional character **who has.no agancy to wear it**.
---
&gt;try playing all your hand when you have lethal already on board
---
I do that if I have a quest like "Play 25 spells" and have a hand full of spells.
---
Is it appropriate to tell him to fuck off and stop boasting?
---
No, it's Bowel Movement. They are shitting. 
---
&gt; I don't see men having a go because Male characters are half naked with unrealistic body proportions.
---
Except they did with at least one male character of final fantasy : https://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-costume-sexy/
---
Is the hand queen deck the one with astromancer? Could you give me the deck code please?
---
Honestly, i don't see the big fuzz everyone is making about that. The positions they cut where mostly e-sports/HOTS related, i have heard. And lets be frank, hardly anybody cared about HOTS e-sports. While the game is good, the e-sports scene hardly took off. And now they seem to focus on making actually good games and hiring new engineers. It still sucks for everyone laid off, and i hope they land on their feet, but in the end if it leads to quality products, this is good imo.

last time in China when they ban wintrader, surprisingly there were a big backlash from certain part of the community there, they even threathen ggnydra who wrote article about it. i wonder if they are reluctant to punish Roger for wintrading because of that, yes China and Taiwan are different but over the last couple of months, they got involved in some cheating scandal like ghosting a major tournament event, etc , when someone posted the video link there were a lot of "trolls" suddenly spamming the post.

---
BM when you have lethal in hand but not on board then rope him and kill him at the last second. He is forced to wait for you to do something because what if you dont have lethal and you‚Äôre just bluffing?
---
Gotta suck at the sweet teat of capitalism and pray for a drop. 
---
It‚Äôs probably one of the strongest decks you can make for its dust cost. It has a strong matchup spread and rexxar (if played optimally) can win you games you have no right to win. I play it often and enjoy it a lot more than other aggro decks like odd pally. It should take you to rank 5 with relatively little trouble and if you grind it out you can take it to legend. 
---
Jeez, that's insane. Thanks for the info!
---
I greet deathknights.

Try playing Hearthstone everyday for 8+ hours every single day for multiple years. You can only fake happiness for so long. If you truly wanted to support him, then support him, not because he's playing game you play.

in the lower ranks its even a win condition if you do it from turn 0.

The last popular iteration of Zoolock with its heal synergies was aggro. You wanted to stay ahead on board as long as possible, and eventually close out the game with doomguards or soulfires,even after you lost the board. I think it used to play Spellbreakers, but that was because it played Keleseth. When Keleseth rotates out, it is not inconceivable that some aggro decks might choose to use Shieldbreaker. Try it out, it might be good.

Brode was just "the guy" behind hearthstone... The day he quit the job... Hearthstone changed... Not sure how to explain.. It's a feeling.. You know?

the most common bm is that you do unnessary stuff in your last turn when you know you have leathel, like spamming emotes until roping starts, or intentionally wait with your last attack, or what was very common for quest mages that they fireball everything in their 2nd turn, instead of only going face so that they make a full boardclear instead of just fireballing your face x times.
---
That is a) not true b) you're playing a video game, conserving time is hardly a priority and c) while I have never been the one who BMs, I have my doubts that they don't already feel good about themselves. You seem to be someone who does, so tell me, if your opponent plays swiftly and efficiently, inspite of losing, don't you just assume they're gritting their teeth and quietly getting tilted?

cannot say when it started but i had some matches where the oponent intentionally roped each turn.

ofc i didnt care cause i do play it for fun and not for the competitiv factor.

also i play it way to less to take it seriously(still no legend and i started on day 0 - 1 last day of beta with breaks obviously but never played the op decks, even if i would have every card aviable).

I‚Äôm playing it since I just started and don‚Äôt want to craft any cards until the next expansion. It‚Äôs a fun deck to play especially when you get to combo all the buffs and win by turn 5 and 6.

That's how the term is used these days but it's a much more recent deck. I think Miracles were introduced in like 2012 but the miracle deck I'm talking about, where miracle rogue took its name from,  goes back to like the late 90s.

Mean Streets came in with a bang and shook the meta dramatically.  It's funny. The set's was the war between 3 major gangs. However the gameplay was defined by a minor gang and a minor Shaman class theme.

Playing budget decks and not opening any pack (?)
---
Every CCG I have seen does stuff like this. First they print a card that has a drawback. That card makes sense when you look at it entirely on its own. Yeah, it's OP, but the drawback evens things out. Totally cool and fun. Make a sacrifice in one area of the game to gain an advantage in the area of the game, and try to win that way.
---
But then they go ahead and make other cards that cancel out the drawback! Now you have something that is just plain old OP assuming someone can draw two cards together. In a game with 30 card decks, and lots of draw power, it's going to happen very frequently!
---
e.g: If Warlock's drawback is losing health then it should be almost impossible for them to heal or gain armor ever. Get that lifesteal stuff out of here!
---
I have a lot of gold saved up from not buying a lot of packs this year, but this? This I do not understand. And the idea of sitting there opening all those packs? Oy, painful. 
---
Yes.
---
And was still overnerfed even with kingsbane 
---
As with Malacross' "What a show of skill" emote, it is good for a variety of situations.
---
RNG favored opponent?  Hard counter it.
---
Opponent following an extremely common/netdeck line of play (e.g. wish I could have said "What a show of skill" when my opponent played a turn 5 Greater Emerald Spellstone before the nerfs)
---
And obviously, can be used if your opponent misplays.  But that's almost too obvious, you might make yourself look petty.
---
Did you win? Because you have an uncastable stuff (dragonfire can give you another uncastable spell) and he has 5 turns to kill you.
---
Wish I'd heard this 16 hours ago

Big spell mage or control priest.

Yes, it's Miracle Rogue, not Auctioneer Rogue. The 'miracle' refers to the big swing turns.

I mean I know you're memeing around but according to the most recent VS report that dropped today the meta is actually in a state of experimentation and several cool new archetypes are up-and-coming, so really things are looking up overall in terms of meta variety

Whizbang is better for people that fall in/out of playing Hearthstone for months at a time. 
---
You can long back in when a new expansion is released, fire up some Whizbang decks and get a flavor for the new cards. Decide if any of the decks excite you enough to want to craft them (so you can tweak them to win more).
---
That's why I play it lmao. I just don't have Garrosh DK, replaced him with a Gorehowl. All the other legendaries I got from packs as well and finally I can put them to use. I was convinced Akali would sit in my collection unused until it's gonna rotate.

this expansion/rotation better change something up
---
What if they have the quest?
---
No! That‚Äôs what ‚Äúwow!‚Äù Is for!
---
How is the deck performing and is it fun to run? I only lack the epic overkill minion and I may craft it. 
---
Hey thanks chief
---
You are right that they fired hundreds, but from the sounds of it, most of them was not developers, it was community managers, PR and other such stuff
---
Mech Paladin? I dont remember such a deck. I remember Mech Mage which played Cogmaster -&gt; Mechwarper + Gnome -&gt; Shredder or another Mechwarper etc. Then there was Secret Pally.
---
Do you at least have a decklist?
---
I blame friar john. 
---
I just had a 6-2 run with it. Which overkill Epic minion? Maybe we're running different versions, there are quite a bunch atm. 
---
That was MY brake! Give it back!
---
Is that not a good thing tho? One thing that Blizzard aims for is for match ups not to be polarizing. Sure some decks might be here and there but it's bad for the game to so many polarizing matchups. Allowing players to ban out their most polarizing matchup makes it more fun for players because they're playing in games where their decisions matter more (on average).    
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
                   
---
I think it can also be healthy to play against decks that are just not fun to play again. For example, in Boomsday, I loved playing dead man's hand control warrior. My worst matchup was probably warlock (zoo was most popular at the time) but it didn't feel bad for me to lose those matchups because I felt like I could've played every game a bit better which could've allowed me to win. Even though the game was polarizing, it didn't feel bad to lose. On the other hand, playing against hunter at the time felt horrible because it felt like the sooner they drew Rexxar they would just slowly win with tempo. I had a better winrate against that deck but I really hated playing against it. Bans could allow overall enjoyment of the game to go up.            
---
&amp;nbsp;          
---
Concerning your last point, I don't think there's any evidence to support your last point. Their are bans in other games and in HS tournaments which allows for a lot of room for strategy. Even though you can ban out 1 class, it doesn't mean you have an automatic guaranteed 80% matchup. 
---
I am sorry. I meant epic overkill weapon. Sulthraze may be its name. 
---
he‚Äôs just smurfing on em
---
Any warrior is a definite hard counter. Controlling Priests and Mages also do extremely well against it. It's also hardly the top deck.
---
I rerolled before I saw this, quest disappeared, but it still showed up and made progress when I completed the brawls and completed just fine. 
---
Is there a server difference? Or rank? I feel every second game in wild is some boring big priest. 
---
As long as they're different you get em both.
---
He had a bunch of Excavated Evils in his deck so he barely had any usable cards. Eventually I used dragonfire but I got another spell I couldn't cast. He was deeper in fatigue and I had my hero power so I pinged him down and won.
---
&gt; Blackwing Technician is bound to be a staple in new dragon-centered decks. As a 2/4 for 3 mana, it enjoys healthy vanilla stats for the cost..
---
Oh, how times have changed
---
But three righteous protectors makes me rage quit.
---
A lot of the average players can't get past rank 15. So Kudos and good luck. Use a decktracker if you don't do so already. Helps improving and playing around opponent cards.
---
I love those quests, but having them really shows how bad regular quests are.
---
xddddddddddddd i love this sub every time people link it i laugh out loud because its so funny please continue doing so everyone loves top tier comedy like this
---
I opened it too. One of the few useful legendaries I unpacked. 
---
Even though I appreciate the dual nerfs this expansion, Psychic Scream needed to have it's mana cost increased.
---
Yes u draw all of them.. unless u have non-beasts minions still in ur deck..
---
How?
---
Your argument is self-evidently stupid, and you should have realized how stupid it was.
---
People who use a MAGA hashtag are not a random selection of people. Obviously, people who support Trump are far more likely to use the hashtag than people who oppose Trump.
---
Now, look at a slutmog hashtag. Obviously, people who use the slutmog hashtag are going to be mostly the people who are doing it. And we can see that is the case, because the users of the hashtag are posting pictures of their characters.
---
Meaning that users of the hashtag are a random sample of people who do slutmog. 
---
Meaning that we can look at the hashtag and it tells us how many are male and female.
---
Now, like I said, it's not 100% proof. Because it could be that female slutmog users were proportionally more likely to use the hashtag than male users. But that seems unlikely given that the majority of twitter users are male. 
---
Your arguments are extremely stupid.
---
He's using internet explorer
---
something something confusing to new players 
---
Ah, a fellow Call Pet player, nice one mate
---
I use it in my Quest Rogue deck to pull a bunch of cheap lifesteal minions in late game. Then I use Valeera to summon them with free copies. Works alright if I make it that far 
---
Man I totally agree with you. Learning matchups are so important in Hearthstone and having to learn how every Whizbang deck stacks up against every meta deck is basically impossible for a new player. 
---
That and the decks sometimes have werid win conditions and absolutely no tech cards, they are plenty of players Whizbang holds back rather then helps.
---
Those look incredible! But if she didn't go so far as to put Millhouse Manastorm on the back of every one of those you should probably divorce her.
---
Your entire deck is made to kill your opponent before turn 7,8.
---
If you get to 7,8 your opponent drops costing cards that you simply cannot overcome anymore because your curve ends at 5 essentially with 6 as a leeroy jenkins.
---
You want to spend all your cards, then turn 5 draw your deck and try to kill your opponent before 8 rolls around. Youre dead anyways, might as well draw your entire deck and see if you drew 2 cold bloods and try to end the game turn 6.
---
Ya its all good, I get all that.  Some people consider winning fun, and I just consider fun, fun.   :)

---
I rerolled to get a 100 quest over a 60...rip
---
Myra's connects it ("draw a bunch of cards in 1 turn) and Edwin, but it's a stretch.  Myracle is an aggro deck, Miracle is more of a midrange deck.
---
That said, it doesn't look like people are playing more traditional Miracle builds currently, so it's okay if this is the face of the deck.  There won't be confusion.
---
tbh I don't like how half the cards are used to continue the sentence but the other half repeat what was just said. :x
---
I guess you didn't read the vS report? it literally says odd paladin is the #1 top deck right now.
---
To the part about people playing it "as soon as they can"... that's probably a mistake on their part. If you end up with 10 cards and no deck on turn 5, you better be about to win the game. Like other people said, it's a great card for either reloading so you can pull off a desperation play, or when you know you're a few turns away from lethal and want some extra tools and don't care about fatigue. All in all it's a card that requires you to have an idea of what the next couple turns could/should look like.
---
Priests are now bigger scumbags
---
[It is?](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aqnncd/class_winrate_and_popularity_brawl_of_champions/)
---
There's no viable non-odd warrior deck that have those cards. The only non-odd warrior deck rush warrior, does well against odd paladin, with slightly favorable win rate, but is far from a hard counter.
---
Im surprised druid is so low. She plays a pretty insane aggro game. 
---
A good version of this post would have used the canonical wow names

They could be like the worgen cards and switch everyturn, with the human form a 5 Mana 3/4 and dragon 8 Mana 6/9, both with really good effects of course

Fake news
---
Gagetzanish flavor bank hiest expansion. Each class gets a legendary theif and rough a new hero card.
---
There always is a shift!
---
Some decks (like raza priest and big priest, Jade druid, and N'zoths, Pirate Warrior) were just gone, and some come out of fucking nowhere (Odd/Even decks, Shudderwock Shaman). 
---
So, some decks will no longer exist in standard, Like Spell Hunter, Cubelock, Egg Hunter, Kingsbane Rogue, etc
---
When Witchwood came out, cubelock had take a Huge Nerf and was not THAT great anymore, Big Priest was very strong, with a Vellen Malygos deck (as far i can remember). 
---
You can expect a some brutal changes (Since the mammoth has a huuge powerlevel) and also, if the powerlevel of next expationt is a tiny bit higher than raven's, a lot of new cards will see play to avoid playing with the 'old' crap ones
---
As many as you can bring.
---
If HSReplay is including data from ranks 25-5, you're just not going to get an accurate picture of how the deck performs against good competition. This is why people use VS in the first place, because they provide the highlights of this performance information for free. Additionally, even if you want to use HSReplay's stats, Dire Frenzy has the lowest drawn winrate in the deck, which supports VS' claim that it is overrated. The Midrange Hunter decklist shown in the report doesn't run the card because their data supports not running over the alternative.
---
I'd argue the reason it still sees play, despite not being optimal in the lists that run it, is simply because it feels good and it's a fun card. There's nothing wrong with that, but the immediate impact you get from the buff is inefficient, and in many aggressive matchups the value you get from it is just too slow.
---

like exodia mage players who insist on fireballing every single little minion on board and then post WhY DiDnT yOu LeT mE kIlL YoU
---
Ignoring the new miracle rogue lists, the two aggressive paladin decks, and control warrior, yep hearthstone is basically just priests and hunters.
---
wink wink
---
They can't right now. Odd Paladin is Baku+29 other cards that only need minor synergies, so this deck will just continue to exist after rotation as well. They would have to either introduce proper tech cards, create an extra dude hostile meta, not introduce any odd cards (for the archetype) or nerf the Baku hero power. I don't expect them to make a third balance change before April.
---
&gt;If you don't care about board presence, you don't play Duskbreaker. You play Mass Hysteria and Spirit Lash.  
---
Bullshit. You play whatever is the optimal play. You aren't going to waste a spirit lash if it's not going to board clear, likewise with mass hysteria depending on the board setup.  
---
&gt;And why is it a massive bonus? Because it can attack the opponent and their minions.   
---
Yup but that's not the main reason for running it.  If you had a card that was "deal 3 damage to everything" for 3 mana you'd likely want to run that instead (you'd probably run both). I say 3 mana because without a minion it's probably a bit over valued.  
---
&gt;When you play a Tar Creeper to stop the opponent from attacking your minions, that is board control. When they play a Tar Creeper to stop you from attacking them, that is also board control.  
---
Which is not what the decks I mentioned in my original post do.  
---
Control priest for example is not a control deck. It's a combo/otk deck depending on how you want to define either.  
---
Imsokewllawl#1317

Trade 80g quest

I disagree when the combo is that original you let it play

No, 3x Flaming Claws + 3x Rocky Carapace + 1x Volcanic Might is a 10/10 adaptation.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uhq1G6LhxWg
---
Exactly. The deck basically wins by itself if you just play the cards you can play at the time without thinking about a game plan or something like that. Works even better with midrange hunter. For bad players, it just comes down to drawing the right cards or not, without taking playing them in an intelligent and correct manner into consideration.
---
Im absolutely positive that the game needs easy decks that can be competitive at the same time though. Gives new players the illusion of achieving something and hopefully motivates them to play "real" decks in the future.
---
I would have, for sure, that's a really neat combo
---
just plays devils advocate really

That's gonna cost you some roping and BMing /s

Personally I liked hitting face with a 40/40 totem on turn 3 as priest.
---
 \&gt; Just because it technically counts as censorship doesn't explain why this censorship -kinglordnok 
---
Nope. You just contradicted yourself and admitted it's still censorship. Then you play coy and pretend nobody address the question, when people already did with presented fact and dictionary definitions that debunk your mental gymnastics. You just played yourself. 
---
 Why is this bad? Because it makes people delusional. Just like how you can keep repeating the same question like a broken record and expect different results from reality when facts are inconvenient. 
---
&gt; It is in no way proof that most people who do slutmogs are female.
---
Yes, it is. As I keep saying. Because it's a random sample of people who do slutmogs. 
---
Not conclusive proof, but still proof.
---
&gt;You are stupid because you don't seem to understand we are talking about g about all wow users.
---
No, again we are not. You're too stupid to even understand the discussion. We're not talking about all WoW users, but only the ones who do slutmog.
---
&gt;We need to first know
---
&gt;How many people do slutmogs
---
&gt;How many of them are women.
---
Except if we knew those facts, then we wouldn't need to do a poll. We'd already have the answer.
---
&gt;So we need an accurate sample size of the over 100 millions people who have played wow.
---
Ok...I'm blocking you because you're too stupid to even understand what we're talking about. 
---
Cairne is currently featured in the highest winrate even rogue list on HSReplay. That deck struggles with meaningful plays above 6 mana so its pretty good when curved into bonemare
---
Last rotation changed almost nothing due to some very powerful decks not losing anything. After those decks were nerfed a couple months later the meta shifted a lot more.
---
This year should have a much larger shakeup, but I am worried it won't feel different Genn and Baku aren't nerfed. If post rotation Odd Paladin is still the best deck and Odd Mage, Even Warlock, Odd/Even Rogue, Even Paladin, etc. are all really good that is going to suck.
---
&gt; BTW it does say "summon a random totem" so I don't know why you're complaining.
---
Obviously OP knows this. The whole point of the post is to suggest a way to make shaman better by altering the hero power.
---
He's not there for the synergy. He's there to seal the deal against Odd Pally and other flood decks.
---
I feel like we are part of the problem. There are some interesting off-meta decks in compHS threads, but nobody to compile them in single post. And even if somebody will do it, they have short expiration date - even if it's possible to climb with them, people will jump to decks with which is easier to climb.
---
But if you have something interesting, always post it. That's the only way to propagate something.
---
Agreed. If you have the win, take it. If you're gonna get greedy looking to get more quests completed or wanna show off your annoyingly long combo then you're just disrespecting my time so I'm gonna concede and save myself the waste.
---
Seems pretty normal to me. A Wisp with four Wind-Up Burglebots is pretty meta nowadays

Did she make them or order them?
---
&gt;  I've played multiple decks to winning records that didn't have an archetype on hsreplay, and tbh it made it feel a little bit futile.  I knew that no-one would ever notice this deck, because it doesn't exist anywhere besides my own client.
---
I find this kinda a strange statement. If you can build your own decks with winning records, then you have the advantage of it not being posted everywhere, and being teched against etc. Then, you get to legend or w/e and make a post about it on competitivehs or something and you can get your acknowledgement too.
