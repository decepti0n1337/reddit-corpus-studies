&gt; no means a WoW lore expert, but from what I know, the Mogu are heavily Pandaria related, and have nothing to do with Uldum.
---

---
*Cracks knuckles*
---
*Actually...*
---
[Lei Shen the Thunder King,](https://imgur.com/MQOlPZo) who you might remember from the greatest Mogu Empire to ever exist (which is around about the second greatest mortal empire to ever exist on Azeroth, just behind [Queen Azshara's ancient kaldorei empire](https://imgur.com/9P6hAOh)) and [the newest Shaman Hearthstone Hero](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Thunder_King) from around abouts the time of Rastakhan's Rumble actually *met his demise* at Uldum.
---
Now, for anyone who doesn't know, Lei Shen is [one of the most badass mofos](https://imgur.com/3YrdJOF) when it comes to power level. Granted, he would easily fall to the likes of the leader of the Burning Legion, Sargeras. I mean, [the dude could cleave Lei Shen's planet in half.](https://imgur.com/0oAJbxj) But let's take another famous villain who we know he could beat one-on-one. [The Lich King.](https://imgur.com/3eDZIqy)
---
Yeah.
---
Lei Shen can beat the Lich King, [according to Dave Kosak.](https://mobile.twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/759552173579591680) And for what it's worth, Dave Kosak is a pretty good authority when it comes to Warcraft lore. [Word of God](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod) and all that.
---
So, how did Lei Shen and his Mogu+Zandalari troll armies fall in Uldum?
---
Well, one thing I pointed out when [I first speculated that Uldum would be the location of the Year of the Dragon's second expansion](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aw2d4h/the_next_expansion_could_be_sewers_of_dalaran_aka/ehjj3je/) five months ago (let's just kindly ignore that I was wrong about Algalon the Observer showing up) was that Uldum is for all intents and purposes, a Titan superweapon. One capable of wiping out nearly all life on Azeroth.
---
But hey, at least Uldum has a dial the Tol'vir could use to tune it down a notch and make sure only *the entire region of Uldum was obliterated.* The result? A lifeless desert, devoid of Lei Shen, Mogu/Zandalari armies, and even many of the Tol'vir's own.
---
So... do the Mogu have anything to do with Uldum? I would say that their short-lived relationship is, despite its longevity, very significant. Their presence in Uldum marked the end of the greatest (not necessarily nicest) Mogu Emperor to have ever lived *and* the start of the fall of the Mogu Empire.
---
Don't get me wrong - going to Pandaria and seeing the Vale of Eternal Blossoms or something would be utterly fantastic. [There's](https://imgur.com/yuNJyBm) more [than](https://imgur.com/EL2B7x2) enough [badass](https://imgur.com/TYkjYku) Pandaren [art](https://imgur.com/FPX7fNR) out [there.](https://imgur.com/pIRn0Y7) But I wouldn't say that the introduction of the Thunder King (especially during Rastakhan's Rumble, where Zandalari trolls got their fair share of representation) is a great indicator of that.
---
I don't care where they go so long as they give me my bloody Algalon the Observer, damnit.

Just log in after launch of the expansion
---
You get the new Hunter or Paladin quest, then you get a new Tavern Brawl which rewards a pack from the new expac at first and then over the next few weeks it gives packs from older expansions and you may get something extra like double gold from quests if they're feeling very generous.
---
That what I theorycraft made a Mech Quest Paladin 
---

---
Then why can't you heal him with minion healing only effects?
---
I used to buy the preorder every time but haven’t for the last 3 or 4 because I felt there wasn’t enough value in it. Now because I had a good amount of cards from previous sets I just save gold starting from like 2 weeks after the expansion until the next and that will get you enough gold for 50-60 packs which is more than enough for me now to make the decks I like.
---
so the only way to get the cardback is with real money? not coins?
---
It's just a small indie company, stop nitpicking, they're too busy nerfing Quest Rogue.
---
One of the best
---
The thing is Dr Boom is an infinite value card in a meta where no other deck has access to that. And nothing has changed because none of the quests are on that level (a good thing). So until Boom is changed there is no room for any other control deck.
---
Why even include the quest in this
---
There is absolutely no difference at all. Pros will always theorycraft decks in advance and play it from day one and post it on their social media and people will immediately copy any deck that shows signs of success.
---
It will be merely hours before you will see the same decks over and over and over again because streaming and social media spreads the stuff no matter them streaming the decks in advance or not.
---
Nothing will change for the average joe. Plus, as multiple ppl pointed out, nobody forces you to watch it.
---
Did you guys know that over 74.6% of statistics are made up?
---
ok when hearthstone releases your favorite animal as a card back NOW THATS AMAZING
---
Litterally one of the main complain about Hearthstone is running constantly against the same few meta decks again and again. Now we should also complain when people get creative when building decks ?
---
You think the people who don't look before they post are somehow gonna see this?
---
Son of Getty Images
---
8 mana 8/8 draw 8 makes more sense, octopi are all about the number 8 anyways.
---
No problem, to each their own!
---
Most people just play slightly modified versions of the same decks anyways. A new "OP" deck won't emerge right away.
---
4 if you count today's patch "consistency patch"
---
Oohhh... *Oooh.*
---
See, I remembered Siamat, but I forgot Zephrys was an Elemental. That is indeed very important for a No Duplicate deck to have greater consistency in drawing one of its strongest cards.
---
Cloud Prince could be a thing, but I'm not sure you want to play a Gnomish Inventor in a deck that seems like it would go as ham as Secret Mage would. But it's worth keeping in mind.
---
But what does Pot of Greed do?
---
if you’re still playing bomb warrior when this expansion drops you’re a fkin nerd
---
Yes it’s for all your minions.
---
look up hearthstone gamepedia. You can look up every card in the game and at the bottom of the page for any given card it gives you every patch note for that card
---
Was she at 4 Mana? Probably gave her a good minion to play the next turn. Or if she was at 5 mana left, that turn.
---
Thanks!
---
Do you still have your quest?
---
80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first.
---
EU Lykan#21100
---
The pool of random cards and discover effects is still the old rotation too
---
let the pAiN speak to me
---
you play naga ahead of time to set pyroblasts to 5 each forever. Then you play malygos and sorceror's apprentice for 1 making pyroblasts 4 mana apiece. that's 10 mana 30 damage
---
1st card: new highlander pally sir finely that lets you choose an upgraded hero power
---
2nd card is zyphrs which uses ai to pick a good card for you based on board state, life totals and number of cards in your hand. used to pick priest minion that makes all your heals do damage.
---
3rd card is prismatic lens, which draws a spell and minion from deck and swaps their cost.  used to get a nozari down to 1 mana.  The nozari(dragon) has a battlecry: heal both heros to full, in combo with priest minion, it would kill you both, but....
---
you play the pally card "time out" which makes you immune until the start of your next turn.  so you then play nozari and otk your opponent.   its really a two turn kill, but if you just assum you droped sir finely way earlier in the game it is effectively an otk.
---
Who that
---
&gt;leggos
---
Sorry what?
---
It's not an unpopular opinion.
---
Blizzard are spoiling the Hype of the entire HS community with retarded decisions.
---
For me and my friends, expansion night is an event, we gather at someone place order Pizza open our packs (get salty when we don't get enough legenderies and envious at the one guy that get 8 legendaries in 70 packs).
---
Try to invent some cool decks and watch streamers struggle with us on the same time.
---
The highlight of the evening for me is usually when I don't have the strength to play anymore and I just sit and watch Dog   figure out on the fly one of the best decks, try different stuff and eventually get rank 1.
---
Most of this is spoiled now.
---
It's spelled 'rogue' you dumb dumb.
---
This is the opposite of power creep...
---
Did he float off on the same rope he road in on?
---
We tried to warn you it was a slippery slope ...
---
These it’s not a nerf because it’s a consistency change shenanigans have always been bullshit. I guess there is some hope since they reversed the Tess one.
---
From the wiki "Yugi also discovered that the Rare Hunter was using fake cards, and he destroyed them (in the dub, the cards were real, but marked with invisible ink)."
---
 In the dub out was implied that they were also fake due to Weevil throwing yugi's copies (the only ones in the world) into the ocean season one.
---
I was wondering the same thing lol
---
No. They changed how the quest works which had consequently changed hiw Sonya interacts with it. The Quest is now a 1 time stat change rather than an ongoing aura.
---
Too bad in Australia it's $109 😔
---
I'm not interested in playing decks that don't win more than 50% of the time and I'm not smart enough to come up with the next meta deck
---
Yes if you want to you can get the golden legendary of your choice by unpacking all the other cards. If you have all legendaries then you will get a random golden copy.
---
I totally get not wanting it spoiled and that is why I don't watch. I guess I don't understand why it matters if other people partake in it, that doesn't affect my enjoyment level of the new content at all. That is unfortunate if it does for you though.
---
Can we please stop tagging very popular opinions as "unpopular opinion" so it gets more upvotes?
---
No, read the patch notes. They changed the quest from an ongoing aura to a one-time stat change.
---
Almost perfect! The way he described it is "Add the perfect card to your hand." rather than "Discover the perfect card." 
---
Incredibly impressive, nonetheless.
---
Umm, you’ll have 8 cards in hand on turn 4 if the only card you play is a.i. on turn 3.
---
i think you forgot about earlobes
---
If you want to buy packs in preorder, do it before Aug 6.  This video will tell you what is in order.  You get cards on Aug 6th.
---
I don't get this. If you win using fakes, do you still win? What's stopping kaiba from just making an entire deck of blue eyes? If you use fakes in the shadow games, do you still win?
---
Ghostlyboo#2432 NA want to trade 80g quest, ill show but you will have to go first
---
Yeah i found that out later, this one is the biggest problem though to my understanding.
---
I'm more just imagining him kind of flying away a la Team Rocket ; my expectations are high for this
---
Quest Druid seemingly the most powerful, while Quest Shaman was seemingly the most popular.
---
Imagine using card backs
---

What about that time in the dragons arc where the bad guy had a monster with infinite atk points. Yugi fused the knights together and was like, "THEY HAVE AN ATTACK BEYOND INFINITY!" Then the bad guy was like "What, no... you can't!" and Yugi just goes, "I JUST DID!" and sends that bitch to the shadow realm.
---
I don't get what the black and red part is. Is it supposed to be in shadow? Does he have a spiky afro? Tbh, it doesn't even look like hair. It's just kinda part of his head.
---
It's not about that really, the fact is that the first week of an expansion is so beloved precisely because we lack information and have no clue what's good. The best streamers aren't going to work out all the best decks, but they will work out a large number of them, and those decks will he picked up by the player base much faster. 
---
essentially people are unhappy because instead of getting to open their presents on Christmas day they watched someone else open them a week earlier. presents are still great, but it has lost a little magic
---
That's the pharaoh, not yugi.
---
It's a co-operative game, so ideally you're playing with members of your guild (where you want every to have good gear) and not everyone needs the same stuff (greed typically means you're going to disenchant it or vendor it). For example, a healer might want a piece of damage gear for their off spec for pvp, so they'll ask if anyone minds if they roll need.
---
Also, if you're a jackass that rolls need on stuff you clearly don't need there's a good chance the party or raid leader will give you the boot.

---
Quest Rogue was in no way an aggressive deck in any of its incarnations.
---
Sure, the Sonya combo was neutered, but it's not like the deck was doing crap in Wild with or without it.
---
I've done this before
---
Neither was the event
---
it was more about other card that have a ongoing cost reduction like corriodor creeper and the one that gets cheaper by how many totems you have summoned
---
Crystal core isn’t an ongoing buff anymore. So basically when you cast it all cards in hand or deck are 4/4’s. any new cards generated via any means, such as Sonya , firefly or murloc tide hunter that has their original stats
---
Was priest as powerful as everyone thought it will be? Or too hard to activate?
---
I was playing fatigue mech warrior list virtually unchanged from today on Day 1 of the expansion. Netdecked.
---
Yes but 2 months after expansuon release probably
---
Devil's advocate here - people will see the new cards are good sooner and will shut the fuck up about how "Control Warrior makes all the new cards pointless". Like, god damn, /r/hearthstone are such negative nancies when it comes to new cards. The new cards look VERY FUN and VERY STRONG.
---
which leaves mountain giant costing 5 since it costs 1 less for each OTHER card in your hand.
---
I thought it was a really funny and cool interaction, (+secrets), but he basically became obsoleted by better forms of infinite value that don't force your health total down, had better consistency, and/or were stronger tempo plays.  So I feel like sac pact is a very...misguided thing to blame.
---
Asa#22590, go on, I'm kinda noob too xD
---
When you log in at 7PM or whatever on launch day, ladder is full of janky shit, it's pretty fun. It won't be with these pre-release events.
---
Hey! Yes I did post on the relevant post there, but I had no interaction or discussion.
---
And a lot perfection
---
I dont have an sd card
---
Thanks! I’ll check these out!
---

---
Simple, they were not thinking of anything.
---
Oh my bad.
---
Take two seconds to look at the sub for your answer.
---
Yeah I would assume it's better for them in that case since they saved 5 mana
---
All this is really doing is moving the "spoiler day" closer.
---
I watched a bit of the various streams. And here's my "unpopular" opinions:
---
- None of their decks were actually competitive. They were all memey decks that wouldn't stand a chance even on the current ladder.
---
- They were all heavily incentivized, with a *Blizzard rep sitting beside them*, to showcase the effects of the new cards. 
---
To be quite frank let's ask really the real questions:
---
a) How many people out of the entire playerbase had the time to watch these streams, especially during a timeframe when most of us in North America are at school, or at work? As for the rest of the world - were those terribly favorable timeframes to sneak peeks? maybe yes maybe no.
---
b) If we're honest, we're just a little salty that other people got to do something that we have to wait on. They got to taste the honey first. And we don't like that. Because they're streamers and we're not?
---
I don't really care that much to be honest. The pre-release day is only a few days away if you want do that.
---
The fun doesn't change between you and your friends. All the cards are already long spoiled on all the 3rd party websites that collect this info. All of us already know every single card that's released, their potential interactions, and more. Even portions of the meta are already figured out.
---
This is to be honest the worst part of things, and it's not the game's fault. It's the fault of the Internet, where we can share ideas at blistering speed. We all want the good ol' days of the playground where no one knew all the cards were, and seemingly everyone got different cards in their packs. And we ooo and ahhhed over this card this lucky other kid got that we didn't.
---
Those days are gone. And what we have is today. Let's be honest, it's just salt that others got have something sooner than us. That's all it is.
---
Can’t wait to find lethal with this card.
---
Hey, that's also one of my favorite decks! Just crafted Reno for it a week ago.
---
member when barnes didnt shit out an ultra powerful minion every time it went off?

That Duel is one of the weirdest in the entire series.

---
What's the yt link for
---
Nice
---
Pinata created by Omega Assembly too!
---
Anduin going "wow"
---
If Thermaplugg never gave dust back then this won't lol
---
So does the Vulpera count then?
---
Kun is still very powerful without Aviana, and the combo decks are perfectly playable with Innervate. He existed without Aviana in standard and saw play, particularly in jade druid. Just like the mana change to Molten Giant only impacted Holy Wrath and nothing else, the card still functions and is powerful (hell, there's a post on the front page with Molten Giant right now). 
---
The change to Crystal Core and Sonya fundamentally alters the deck's ability to compete in the late game. Sonya herself is fine and will see play in other, non Quest decks so no refund is needed there. Crystal Core however is going to be extremely limited as it's now stuck with a finite amount of resources.
---
It's good to get millhouse out of your legendary pool. Noz you can meme with at least and screw mobile users. Krush could see play in a highlander if you can cheat it with new cards
---
&gt;deck isn't unplayable homebrew garbage
---
&gt;""""""""""TOOOOOXIIICc!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!1!!"
---
This won't cause a buzz, quite pollen my leg.
---
Because it's FABULOUS
---
Pre nerf quest rogue (5/5 minions) was a powerhouse in wild. The 4/4 nerf killed it.
---
This is fantastic!!
---
Cards like Humility, Dark Conviction, and most importantly Dinosize. As it was before, you could opt to save cards that buff stats straight until after you got a Dinosize size or Dark Conviction off, then use them, then Lynessa would play them in that order.
---
As it is now, you can end up rolling Dinosize last after your two blessing of kings, two spikeridges, two blessings of might, two divine strengths, and the 6 sound the bells you got off and go from a 27/37 to a 10/10 just because rng rolled the order wrong.
---
kinda. depends.
---
not like either of us are big streamers to speak from experience but there are a lot of streamers who will actively play low viewer shit, although it's usually the ones that are too wealthy to care if their stream tanks for a month or two
---
... yes
---
I'd give up. Youre conversating with a brick.
---
Reno was definitely a win condition.  "Don't lose" isn't usually a win condition - but when "Don't lose" gets spread over 4-5 turns, that's a reasonable win condition.
---
You should be able to open any packs you have plus your pre-order packs.  You just can't buy more packs with gold to open.
---
Touché. That makes a whole lot of sense too lol.
---
Never thought about how well the mech package fits into the new hunter quest. Do you think we could see a more value focused version of the current mech hunter with quest and a few board spam cards?
---
The quest reward is essentially metaltooth leaper's battlecry for all minions lol
---
This has never been and never will be an unpopular opinion
---
Wasn't this exact same post and title made last expansion? including the unpopular opinion part
---
I stopped playing this game because od that.

---
I did once and they were indeed using a Lackey pacckage. They completed their quest on like turn 6, so not that late. You know what happened? They died next turn because I was playing Darkest Hour Warlock and pulled a full board of Chargers, Mal'Ganis, a Voidlord and a Rag.
---
That's why it's not played in Wild.
---
I better be playing with dudes who don't know how to count then!
---
you are a mech tho
---
/bigthonk
---
Who needs plot armor when you have the Plot Pot?
---
Given hearthstone's track record for AI, I'd be utterly shocked if the zephyr attempts to play around secrets
---
eh. I'd take hero cards over stupid otk decks.
---
No, because that's what people were planning to do with him the second it was revealed.
---
I definitely know I at least will be running that lol. The hero power seems busted especially because if the opponent doesn't board clear (and at this point they should be running a lot, a weakness I can see is getting to 7 minions on board and unable to clear them which magnetize sidesteps) your board gets bigger and bigger to hit face with.
---
Study Communications.
---
That's an F if I ever seen one lol
---
Is it just me, or did blizzard flood the legendary pool with crappy ass legendaries so we would keep popping packs for the right ones?? Im sure I ain't getting even one legendary I wanted outta the 130 packs I'm opening
---
Exactly like, I'm down to play 9/10 in stats every turn and zeph when needed. Seems stupid good tbh
---
So don't watch their streams?
---
r/egg_irl
---
Generated minions will still be 4/4s, this only affects things that set stats to a specific amount.
---
It sees literally zero play in Wild. It might as well be deleted.
---
Yeahhh I noticed that a little bit after I made the post, thanks for clearing it up for everyone else! 
---
Regardless it’s still a nerf, a pretty signifant one at that
---
Pirate Warrior is by far my favorite deck of all time. I get why people hated it but it just felt really broken to play and the mirror matches were super fun and interesting (in Wild at least). It's definitely my most played deck of all time and last week's Brawl was super fun as a trip down memory lane.
---
I lost against this deck before. My Vargoth keeps ressing doomsayer over and over again until I realized I should kill it (the Vargoth) if it appears. Then he also cheesed me with infinite defile + howlfiend using grim patron. Good times, I was laughing so hard the whole match! :D

Aw man, that made me sad all over again. Gonna miss that era and Geoff
---
He played cataclysm meaning he won
---
Oh I didn’t see it in the feed
---
Dude of course I won 🤔
---
What platform? Could be a storage permissions thing?
---
But what does Arcane Intellect do?
---
PTR, test server
---
okay thanks! Thought I missed a limited challenge or something (sorry I’m a newb)
---
Yes.
---
Certain streamers have early closed access to the expansion. Bug testing and hype purposes
---
Similar to zayle who appeared in packs for a while.
---
Well... that’s pretty cool I guess
---
Pretty sure, yeah.
---
Maybe the default folder hearthstone is being installed to is a partition that's smaller and has less remaining space? Or do you have SSD and HDD? If so make sure you're installing to the one with enough space. Good luck.
---
Yeah I guess it's probably in the pool for the events running the set early, just thought it was a neat bug
---
Would you say it's the bee's knees?
---
I guess you could say... this guy played the Hearthstone card that summons bees with rush that then attacked one of his own minions, causing said minion to double in attack power repeatedly until the attack power was equal to or greater than his opponents remaining health and then attacking, thusly securing the victory for himself... IF you catch my drift.
---
Or 3 mana gain a mana crystal. That way it effectively costs 2, but can’t be played until 3
---
I think the, seemingly endless, Classic WoW Beta did the same thing. It went on for way, way too long with streamers playing it.
---
Meta solving so we don't have to...
---
My only gripe with this whole system. The excitement will last like 2 days for this expansion... and the streamers will be the ones who got to have all the fun
---
That seems like a bug
---
They do it to maximize last hour pre-purchases
---
What would be REALLY cool is if it could learn match-ups too.  
---
I'm a wild player and let's say I'm playing a singleton deck against a big priest. I want it to give me polymorph as an option, maybe sap as another, instead of other removal spells after they played their Barnes.
---
I watched a little and have no idea what's good,and its remaining that way
---
If anyone was wondering how I got a board full of lucentbarks, I just used vargoth, the resurrect spell and Catrina. I didn't know that the resurrect spell would actually revive a lucentbark despite a dormant version of it being already in the board.
---
Grinder Mage will become a top tier deck. Since Reno decks will be slower it should be hard to get aggroed out (tho the Shaman quest might be really good too).

I don’t like it either. I despise the fact that hearthstone becomes a net deck fest after a few weeks, where the vast majority of your games are against the same extremely powerful decks. The best part of hearthstone is the post expansion three weeks where everyone is trying shit out, I love it, and every now and then I come up with a beast of a deck and do really well.
---
For me, the biggest downside to hearthstone is the netdeck/copycat situation, that is completely understandable, but in my view part of a negative experience. My last few weeks have felt like 60% hunter mech decks, 40% mage/rogue. I can barely remember the last paladin or priest I’ve played. And I’ve been trying to win with a heal Druid lucentbark Gonk shitshow.
---
Gets a bit frustrating, and dare I say it, boring. So the more unstable the meta is, the better.
---
Quest rogue is my favorite deck and I moved to wild after rotation because that's where your supposed to play your old favorite decks. Sonya carried hard and this change takes the deck from meme tier to unplayable. I don't really care about dust refunds, reverting this change or one of the previous nerfs would be better.
---
Starting a post with "Unpopular opinion:" doesn't mean it's an unpopular opinion, it means "read this and give me upvotes to show you agree with it".
---
Which is all the reason you need to downvote it.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if HDT reveals the cards that were swapped for the first day or so of the expansion, and is then patched by the devs to hide that info. This has happened before.
---
I believe when this comment is 9 hours and 35 minutes old preordered packs can start being opened. I would assume it’s the same time for all regions regardless of time zone
---
Someone just posted that they evolved into the Darkness.
---
Thank you
---
Lmao Boom aint shit in wild
---
But the average player queues up against people on day 1 using streamer's refined decks.
---
It's time to turn this duel upside down!
---
EU/Android too here and I am on the same page, app stops at the splash screen
---
You gonna receive a deadly mindblast in your face next turn...
---
If your deck has no duplicates add the 5 pieces of exodia to your deck
---
But a hero portrait is different then a card that becomes your hero and gives you extra powers
---
Guacboy? Is that you?
---
Yeah but imagine getting this on turn 3 or turn 2 with coin. It seems like a instant concede which is crazy
---
I think that if you enjoy the game and hate to have no cards to play memes deck and fancy expensive decks such as quest warlock AKA full value deck with plot twist and Rafaam, you should definitely invest in both bundles (if it doesn't hurt your economics irl).
---
But if you're the type of guy who just enjoy climbing the ladder and don't need the full collection but just a deck or two to achieve the golden epic at the end of the month, then you can just invest gold in Arena and have fun anyways :)
---
Or to Blizzard
---
I saw the legend icon and was like "OMG did someone from Blizzard respond?
---
Then I realized that it just meant gilded hahahaha of course Blizzard doesn't give a shit at all, go buy more preorders and then buy some more several months later more money, no refund for nerfs, just buy no think.
---
3000 gold won't get you very far, unfortunately.
---
But if you preorder both bundles (50 and 80), you probably *still* won't have all the cards from the expansion.
---
It's probably that he gets stuck mid-air in the middle of his entrance. Here is a [video of Brann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1nWKbdK3i4) where you can see his spectacular entrance!
---
#Prepare To Face The Fury Of MILLHOUSE MANASTORM!!!
---
Yea that's the card that makes it viable imo
---
Don't bother assigning a flair.
---
This will get deleted, because believe it or not, EVERYONE HAS ALREADY DONE THIS.
---
Also the 3 5 rush and the add 2 spells
---
Little late for that, but better late than never.
---
I think this is a very popular opinion. If they give streamers early acess, they should only be allowed to play tge deck recipes.
---
I feel like they should just remove all battlecry minions from the evolve/summon pool. They've been the source of endless frustrations and exploits
---
Power of the wild can also work, but further I can't see any cards that can  win you the game there
---
I completely agree with this. it take the fun out of exploring and being creative
---
If you're unable to reach r5 playing a tier 1/2/3 deck with win streaks still available, then the issue is your piloting of your deck. You can blame matchups and RNG all you want, but the truth is you're not very good at the game and should focus on improving. Watch streams and youtube videos, read deck guides, play with a friend, etc...
---
The meta always develops around the strongest classes/decks. The only classes not seeing much play rn is warlock and priest. It's not the greatest, but its certainly not as bad as you say (especially at r13 since it only gets worse the further you climb).
---
IMHO the problem is not so much about the streamers, but the viewers. A lot of decks make their ways into the meta just because they have been created by popular streamers. I’m sure most of them are very good deck builders, but so can you and everybody else.
---
Here is the real problem: people are lazy af and love to play those 60% win rate decks made by the pros. We end up only with a few decks in Standard. So who is to blame? The streamers? Or the players that only copy/paste decks from websites like HearthPwn and never try to bring anything new to the game? (i.e. most players)
---
Have you heard of 0 mana smell my bowels?
---
I've seen glitchy Branns screenshots countless times on this sub. You should find a few if you use the reddit search function.
---
Complaining about Warrior, I bet he was playing hunter or rogue, smh
---
What type of guy enjoys climbing the ladder?
---
Subdue SW:Death hex polimorph freezing trap give minion poisonous sap deadly shot
---
He can't give you Shadowstep.
---
Happy cakeday
---
It's allready broken. It offered Allie [[Harrison Jones]] versus Druid with no Weapon on board, in hand or in the deck. Even further she played it t6, had 4 remaining mana making her unable to play Harrison this turn and a very bad tempo play t7.
---
Didn't offer silnce or polymorph versus a mean deathrattle with attached reborn for papajoneshs.

mhm sorry if i sounded a little harsh there. The thing is youre right it is a direct counter and its gonna suck playing vs bomb warrior as highlander but it really is okay. Not every deck out there is gonna play bomb warrior because its gonna get hard countered by other decks if its played too much. We are just gonna have to wait and see how the meta turns out. 
---
It just annoyed me how last time highlander decks were a thing everyone was crying because there wasnt a counter and now everyones crying because there is one :D
---
I love driving on rodes.
---
Im still using him rn so no?
---
So a nerf that doesn't change how u win with an already unplayable deck? Ok...
---
Best answer!
---
I mean we have zyle but i find his decks meh
---
Holy shit, dude, you did it!!!
---
It's a SMOrc face, and they say it gets quicker
---
You're on 20 now, wait till you hit turn eight
---
But the Control Warriors beg to differ
---
Judging by the 19th Omega Devastator
---
The face we SMOrc, is getting pretty low
---
The Blood's on board, so you might as well play Barnes
---
My Weasel's on board, how about yours?
---
That's the way I like it, takes a month to get bored
---
Hey now, fuck this meta, get Uldum cards, go pay!
---
Hey now, bullshit Jaina/Rexxar/Garrosh(alternates each verse), get the fuck out, I'm Priest
---
And all those Lepers are GOLD! Only get Huffer from my Zul'jin.
---
Scimitar is a weapon so Prep will not reduce it's cost.
---
Even worse imo is people just playing the established aggro decks from the previous expansion with no new cards. It really sucks to finally play the deck you theory crafted and getting shit on by aggro
---
Nice.
---
Tbf, it's what Harrison is based of but they're the same character anyway..
---
i thought he rotated out because the reward for dalaran heist is basically a rebranded whizzbang
---
do you want to see the screenshot I took where I pulled Golemagg off of Raffam's hero power?
---
&gt;2 mana just to make Battlecries trigger twice does not seem like enough payoff to me, especially after you've already played six of them so it'll be like turn 7.
---
There are a lot of good value lower cost BC minions that Shaman would love to play anyways. If you have more low cost battlecries, that 2 mana is an amazing price for drawing / generating 2+ cards. I thought very hard about reasons why a non-aggro Shaman wouldn't want to run that card, but I really can't (doesn't mean I'm right tho).  Against another control deck it gives them more value, against faster decks putting lower cost battlecries makes your deck faster and more capable of surviving. I aggree with most of your points in your comments, but on this one I will bet against you.
---
Shadowstep is banned for Zephrys csrdpool, like the 2 Brewmasters. But it will offer you Winfury which gives lethal for 2 mana.
---
I think you have your psychographics wrong, Spikes are the players that tend to go for the best decks. The Paladin quest seems pretty Johnny to me to be honest.
---
I down vote every post with it, regardless of whether I agree with it, just out of the poor form alone.
---
While it's hard to name a *less* iconic duo than Hearthstone and consistency, "summon" effects seem to trigger off whose side of the board it is rather than who caused the summon (dirty ratting out a taunt works progress your warrior opponent's quest, for example).
---
Thanks for the detailed feedback. So we largely agree, then? =) You'd just switch Priest and Warlock as worst and second-worst.
---
6 zephrys. You play one floop too (as Elise), which then duplicates two zephrys and one floop in hand.
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
&gt;I honestly hope this isn't a bug.
---
Uh, if this turns out to be intentional and stays in the game I can *guarantee* you'll regret saying this *very* quickly. Making any 3 -&gt; 4 Mana evolve potentially give a fucking 20/20 will literally be the most rage inducing interaction in the entire game, and will legitimately lead to people leaving Wild in droves. Having evolves give a dormant Darkness sucks, but there's a very good reason for it.
---
or just frost nova.
---
Then cone of cold in next turn.
---
Then frost nova and doomsayer.
---
Works pretty well.
---
Or replace it with THE (b)ANCIENT ONE
---
ffs, why is that I can ONLY think of the shrek version of this song
---
Because this ones in plain sight they're just gonna make us play the entire trailer. Don't even miss a second per note
---
If I get the right cards in packs I might try highlander quest beast-mech hybrid hunter with Amalgam and the Hench-Clan thing. Will probably be pretty bad, but worth a try.
---
Stop whining, noone gives a fuck
---
Raiding Party dude, imagine old Prep with the actual Raiding Party, with 4 mana you drop a 4 attack weapon and 1-2 free Corsairs.

It's not a mech minion, Jaraxus is a demon minion.
---
Unity. Precision. PERFECTION.
---
Who is Noone?
---
The simplest answer therefore would be to just remove the darkness from the pool of evolve targets.
---
We had the same posts last expansion - as long as people upvote it, it'll never stop unfortunately.
---
damn dude I think you are right
---
Right, thanks guys.
---
What if you only have three mana left?
---
Then there'd be no point of the main summon mechanics, for the regular battlecry
---
it's a little much, yeah
---
Give a refund to Thermaplugg, Kingsbane and Shudderwok as well while you're at it
---
Sorry, but if you've spent 3 mana to "do nothing" that isn't a 7 mana swing for your opponent. It's a 3 mana swing. Later you go on to say that discarding a card is -1, that would mean that it's only a 4 mana swing to your opponent when you roll a dormant darkness.
---
If it's finding the perfect card, it shouldn't just be throwing in one random card from a bucket of "kind of similar" minions. The perfect card is just the biggest five drop if there's nothing else it can base its decision on going on in the game. 
---
That said, it's almost certainly using win rates like others mentioned. Harrison played on 5 might have a higher win rate than any other classic card on turn 5 (besides Leeroy if they're 6 or less).
---
No need. Ping+velen+ping+mind blast+ping+cheap spell+ping= 24. More if the cheap spell is holy smite or kazakus potion with damage
---
but that's the Fandral Glow! Everyone loves the Fandral Glow! It means every card that has the Fandral Glow is gonna be Fandraltastic!
---
but shudderwock and lynessa are VERY different cards. Order matters to a much different extent for different cards/combos. 
---
&gt;And just because something doesn't see much play, doesn't mean the nerf it's given isn't BS....
---
it was not even necessarily a nerf to "order matters" cards though. like dinosize with random order might actually be better than set order because you have very likely played more than +9/+9 of buffs before dinosize comes down. with order matters, dinosize is just dead or is a net negative to play. with random order you could get lucky atleast. this is similarly true with dark conviction.
---
\*I had no idea what to rhyme with AOE I'm sorry I had so much fun in Kobolds\*
---
even in standard, you can get Frost Lich Jaina from Toki
---
Dude great find!
---
Its the price for the nerfs. Its hard to believe the plan was to still have Baku in standard at this point.
---
What's funny is multiple people have now come to your defense thinking it was a genuine argument.
---
wow I thought everyone else also used the random cardback
---
Just got it out of miscreant too...
---
Where has Hagatha got to anyway
---
Unpopular opinion: A lot of people have poor self-control, can't stop themselves from watching pre-release streams to show it's not wanted, and complain when their expectations get shattered.
---
Play the whole League of Explorers MainTheme!
---
only the 146846234525th post about it, thanks
---
Does not work with either. I tested
---
The only reasonable time it would give you magma rager is to be used is if you are a warlock and want to combo it with shadow flame.
---
 3-cost rager +4-cost shadowflame +\_2-cost zephrys = deal 5 damage to all enemy minions  (without hurting your stuff). I could see this being the ideal play in a specific scenario.
---
Probably unpopular opinion, but I love Genn Greymane. Even Paladin, Shaman and Warlock are all some of my favorite decks.
---
Why would you include Leeroy in a double Battlecry deck lmao
---
No one ran sac pact even when Jaraxxas was in the meta so honestly I don't see the big deal. If someone wants to gimp their deck with that shitty spell then they deserve to have an interaction in their favor every now and then.
---
Yes, individually they are quite disappointing. I think Reborn Paladin has a chance, though. We'll have to see how things pan out.
---
If you queue overload shaman into control warrior you drop dead lose from turn 1, it's not that deep
---
Honest question: why didn’t people disenchantment it the first two times it was refunded?
---
Where did you get these card ratings?
---
Rasthakan had a secret too, when you played with drum and the harchet you got fireworks from the gate on the upper left side of board
---
wait they nerfed quest rogue again? what is this like the 4th time?
---
I mean, I haven't watched anybody yet the whole expansion.(and I follow guys like Kripp pretty closely) I'm pretty sure dwindling views would show the hs team that we aren't interested in the pre-release content, it just takes a little bit of feedback and self-control on the part of the community.
---
Or change the mechanic to trigger his Battlecry when it go dormant.
---
Id say is more bc of the huge amount of support for it. Shuffle into your deck and bounce effects are everywhere for rogue
---
r/wooosh
---
N'zoth, the Corruptor. The one card that i was saving up dust to craft golden.
---
Abusive Sergeant
---
The effect is basically divine shield Though.
---
It completely saps my excitement of theorycrafting upcoming decks and playing with new cards :(   The deck building element of Hearthstone is already minimal as it stands.
---
Unlike other "spoiler" content, I can't just ignore it either.   No matter what, the freshness of the new expansion is tainted. 
---
This is coming from someone who watches most of the popular Hearthstone personalities on Youtube.   My favorite of which are the pre-release reviews and the post-expansion re-reviews.   Analyzing and figuring out the best strategy is my favorite aspect of games.  Sadly, that is going away and games are now more about execution of well known strategies.
---
Cruel Taskmaster
---
I believe it's dormant off Barnes. Only transform effects make it come non-dormant
---
Hackerman
---
Stop with these fucking posts
---
Today 10 am PT if you are on the NA Server. Keep in mind you have to set up fireside gathering.
---
Probably today!  6 or 7 PM GMT
---
Toki gives you a minion.
---
Yep, that one. Fits the whole screen
---
And I played against the Rogue Quest more than any other single deck on day 1 of Un'Goro. It wasn't like that deck took a long time to figure out, Dog sat on rank 1 Legend with it for hours and everyone was already copying it by the time I got home to play.
---
Here is an actual unpopular opinion: I don't think theorycrafting streams significantly change how quickly the meta gets solved.
---
If something says it makes them a 1/1, it should make them a 1/1. The interaction in Standard is if a lackey is shuffled into your deck, "I'll make toys out of you" draws them as a 1 mana 1/1 as the card text describes. Maybe it is fringe but it's not inconceivable that these cards exist together in a deck and sometimes interact with each other. The way they work now is the logically correct way they should work, in that an active effect overrides a passive effect.
---
Can you take a screenshot and share it?
---
inconsistencies
---
REALLY? WE POINT AT MANY OF THEM IN CARD TEXT AND YOU DARE TO TALK ABOUT INCONSTANCY WITHOUT FIXING IT?
---
I’m on na and can’t open them
---
Blizzard nerfed the witchwood hoard bard, shame really, was my favorite class.
---
Yep, if the meta is still face hunter and mage having an 8/8, 7/8 taunt, 2/2, and four 0/2 taunts on turn 5, AND they have more cards than me because cyclone, then I quit.
---
Ha how rhe tables have turned. All those games I rolled this guy and he took up my board space. Granted it wasn't too many, but it was enough to remember when evolve shaman is my main deck.
---
It is not 10 am PT yet.
---
What do you mean by "pre-released"?
---
Zephyr only looks at public info, it doesn’t take into account what is in your hand
---
I just played 80g with a friend and yes, the new lackey is already in the game
---
It's a bit weak as of right now. You could theoretically get to legend, but you will need to play a lot/ be a very smart player. It's pretty weak since you're pretty much dead to Warrior amongst other things. However, next expansion is out in less than a week. Just hold out for that because I think warlock is going to be a lot stronger. Who knows though. Could still be terrible.
---
They usually only release on keyword for set though
---
&gt; look what they did to Paladin this expansion. Literally none of what defines the class in their eyes was printed. 
---
Strengths: Minion swarms, minion buffs and debuffs, healing, Divine Shield, Secrets
---
Ok let's see: Tip the Scales is minion swarm, Pharaor's Blessing is minion buff, Ancestral Guardian is healing, Subdue is minion debuffs, Sandwasp Queen is minion swarm, Making Mummies is minion swarm.
---
Argue as much as you want about the cards being weak or the absence of strong synergies, but they're in line on what they want Paladin to do.
---
&gt; Also Hunter got shit it "shouldn't" have either IIRC. 
---
Limitations: Card draw and generation, board clear, Taunt
---
Weaknesses: Healing
---
Swarm of Locusts if used as board clear is an expensive Arcane Explosion, it's minions swarm that can be AoE, so it's limited in its use. Wildtamer and Hunter's pack are limited generators, the first is based to have a beast in your hand (plus eventual RNG) and the other one is from a limited card pool.
---
You can argue about the power level, but they seems fine and nothing really that breaks those rules.
---
I know wotc have been experimenting with limiting meta information for mtg. They used to post meta lists with high wins every week or month or something, but now they just post 5 random archetypes which when 5-0 in a league. So you can sort of see what the good decks are, but the statistics are harder to make out. I personally think most of the fun of a game is actually trying to build a deck and match your skill vs others. So not having "perfect' information about the meta can really increase the fun you have (imo)
---
Class cards are weighted so it should be significantly higher than that, and that’s not the way to calculate the probability anyways.
---
I thought it was all public information. So after a card is played it becomes public information. I don’t know how this works with things like bouncing back to hand or reshuffling into the deck. Wonder if that’s been answered?
---
Kingsbane
---
It’s too late, it’s already a 4/4 woke darkness, it can’t be both version at the same time. Muckmorpher used to not be able to target dormant minions, but it changed in the latest patch.
---
Because that's not a pre-released card in intended definition. A pre-released card would be able to be included in the deck building phase, be neutral, and be announced.
---
Just spent 81 dollars on the coins for pre-purchase, and now I'm stuck since no update is available in the Amazon Appstore. Did you guys find anything useful?

Sigh, so when it's druid and its "combine two" it's always the most optimal outcome, but when it's for priest then clever interactions are bad :(
---
Okay. Are you on the 12.9 or 11in?
---
THE INFINITY TOES
---
This only makes me want to hear our future more.
---
If you limited down the secret choices to one do you think it would play around it then? Or is that more so inferred public knowledge then direct public knowledge?
---
Jarek#2589 EU quest, I can show you go first
---
Joke ≠ sarcasm
---
sadly sometimes you get shit packs. Rise of shadows, all I got was dimensional ripper and that "summon a copy from your deck" legendary warrior got.
---
Aaaaaand it was awful.
---
IM Boom 0&lt;0
---
asking the important questions over here
---
You’re own anecdotal experience of what you faced is just that; Moroes was in dogs original quest list for gods sake. If anything it only confirms what I’m saying in that everyone netdecks the best decks (shudder is in this list too) but finding the best decks a week earlier means the probability of facing someone who has t caught on decreases
---
I think it's all right now, I've played for a long time and I probably forgot that it's 5 wins instead of just being above rank 20 now.
---
the difficulty though is that it existing does impact the meta even if you choose not to watch it. It gives people a chance to figure out what decks actually work. While yes there's theorycrafting, it's really hard to understand what actually works till you try it.
---
12.9
---
You can only make one wish!
---
I agree. Some classes get more value from "The Coin" then others. For example rogue can also abuse "The Coin" to buff Edwin VanCleef. 
---
The question is, was the idea behind "The Coin" to give the player who goes second only an advantage of an extra manacrystal for one round or also the advantage of an extra card+spell.
---
But if we remove the card and spell properties from "The Coin". Is it still a valuable compensation for going second?
---
Maybe the implementation of a class-specific "The Coin" could solve the problem. "The Coin" would then have a different effect for each class.
---
No idea. I know that Amet works this way regardless.
---
Definitely seems like a bug, maybe it's somehow procing off itself?
---
Doesn't the expansion come out next week? Confused!
---
Well, this one works. Blizzard is inconsistent
---
⛏️ HOW ⛏️ LONG ⛏️ CAN ⛏️ THIS ⛏️ GO ⛏️ ON ⛏️
---
Thats what I thought, felt bad as it basically won me the game
---
Damn I wish I had a chance to watch that! The quest seems like it was designed for reborn and deathrattles for sure and it has me hyped! Essentially infinite egg or whelps if they can't stop you all at once. Could even slam in the guy who let's you use your hero power a second time and have 3 total eggs. Very powerful.
---
Alright, in that sense then, the comment is sarcasting because it expresses the argument as if it were a satisfactory answer to OP, even though the new lackey doesn't fit the bill.
---
Cyclone Mage will still be stupid, but for some reason they won’t nerf it
---
If Zephrys could pull Floop, you're looking at INFINITE value.
---
With Choose both, there was no rules about what happened, so they had ro make new ones. 
---
But with this, it actually follows the rulebook; what's on the card.
---
Not sure if you’re meme’ing or not but prevent combat cards are standard in like every card game ever.
---
Source: Pillow fort magic decks are no fun, *fogs for days*.
---
Not to mention there’s like a fucking bazillion different prevent combat cards in MTG.
---
You should just be lucky mage doesn’t have any direct prevent combat damage cards like those that are in MtG.
---
Why are you so offended? Did that comment hurt you that much? Stop crying.
---
what a wild ride this conversation is. it was blatant sarcasm and who actually loses sleep over downvotes
---
play the full theme and the opponent insta-concedes
---
I wonder if they considered this and decided yet another symbol under the minions would be one too many
---
I mean if u look at the board those really are the perfect cards for the situation. I dont think its intended to give u the most broken game winning cards, just gives you cards to help in any given situation
---
Doomsayer is fine, dormant cards that cannot do anything are \*not\*.
---
I'm aware of that.
---
I was trying to figure out what the other person was talking about.
---
But how if there is written Starts Dormat?? Doesnt make any sense
---
Could not agree more, whenever I see a streamer using the cards they just don’t feel as interesting and I feel that I already have a familiarity with them.
---
&gt; blatently unhealthy
---
Welcome to Wild, enjoy your stay.
---
Why? There's so many bad matchups for it (odd pali, dude pali, odd rogue, mech hunter, cyclone mage should all beat it even completely reverted tbh), and it's a fun deck to play.
---
Kibler was not having much luck when I was watching last night, but kripp seemed to be having a blast
---
Zephrys doesn't consider what cards are in your hand.
---
who hurt you?
---
1. IDK
---
2. I'm f2p but I play just for fun (I'm rank 10 btw)
---
3. I don't know what are you're asking. Every class has its own cards. There are cards that you can play with any class you want, it is called neutral.
---
4. Players are pitted against each other based on their rank.
---
Thats exactly the problem, its such a polarizing deck that it crushes control and warps the meta. Its fine as it is (or was before this patch) do not buff it.
---
This wasn't an intentional change, I will look into it. Thanks for the post.
---
Yeah it’s in standard too. Seems like the lackey and the new map are already in game
---
Siamat would be good choice but because he's probably going to be in the majority of decks Blizz probably doesn't want to give him out so can make more money off packs.
---
When I'm deck-building I want to make a deck that "beats the meta". For instance, my first time I hit legend I did it by putting together a Spiteful Priest list teched to beat the early iterations of Cube Lock. It felt really good to win dozens of game in a row by predicting and beating the meta.
---
**You can't beat the meta if there is no meta**. That's why I approve of this initial streamer refinement period - total clown fiesta crap that's unviable gets quickly filtered out, and we start to see a meta that looks like a real meta. I don't want the deck I'm testing to face some clown crap that I can't play around because it could have any retarded clown card in the deck, it's a waste of time to think about the match-up or make cuts to my deck off getting clowned by a Deathwing in an aggro deck for instance.
---
Programmers are gone crazy😁
---
Very useful for people like me that are always hyped for the golden animations.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah I don’t get why people have to ride, it’s a valid question and my guess is you’re still fairly new to HS. Even if you aren’t, I get it, it was an irritating interaction in-game.
---
&gt; So either you get shafted or your opponent gets shafted.  What's the optimal solution?
---
Removing it from the evolve/random pool entirely, as people have been asking for since the cars was released? This isn't rocket science, a very simple solution exists.
---
&gt; Not only that, but keeping it dormant is far worse.  If you get the 20/20 your opponent can still react to it, with board clears, hard removal, or at least taunts to put in the way.  If you get the dormant minion, you have not only lost whatever minion it used to be but also permanently reduced your board size by 1.
---
You're assuming the other player is playing a class or deck that even *has* those things, or can afford to waste it on a single literally random 4-drop. And that they have the answer in hand on exactly the turn said literally random 4-drop shows up. And getting screwed because your 3-drop randomly became a dead board space is a *lot* less bad than your opponent suddenly getting a random 20/20 that can and will probably kill you in the next 1-2 turns. Hell, the dead board space only matters when you're actually able to fill your board, which is far from every deck. Getting a random dormant The Darkness is bad and can cost you a lot of momentum, your opponent getting a random 20/20 early game just means you're going to lose.
---
Which would be why they should just remove the minion from the random generation pool entirely, because *both* options are polarizing and lead to unfair and uninteractive gameplay.
---
Wait so are we only getting a free quest when we log in? No free 6 card packs like usual?
---
It changes almost nothing that's the point. Even if they find good decks, they are playing in an echo chamber, there are no old already refined decks to go against, they can be good decks against those 10 people but not good against the thousands of Mech Hunters, Warriors or Cyclone Mages. It's just a showoff to get an idea of how cards are working ex I saw a fast Trump video about Highlander Hunter and I saw that Zephyr is incredible, I'm just going to instacraft him Day 1 no matter what.
---
It's a deck that wasn't competitive anymore, so presumably you were playing it for fun. Are you no longer going to play it for fun just because of one changed interaction? One interaction that, unless the wild version is a ton different from the standard version, doesn't even change much, given that Sonya was normally the broken way you instantly finished the quest and not a card that you used after the quest?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They've demonstrated before that changing mechanics rather than a card's text doesn't result in refunds and I think that it's just as fine now as it was when they changed Faceless.
---
Wouldn't it have required at least 5 wins to move up those ranks?
---
love going second and coining out Galvanizer then two mecharoos haha so many rage quits.
---
Nope, its intended to give you the best card in every situation and out of 3 different classes. It could in fact give you the most broken game winning card, except its locked to classic-basic cards only.
---
I think you're conflating the base stats on the minion with the effect of crystal core.  To me the "active" and "passive" distinction itself doesn't make much sense.  There's a conflict between two cards: crystal core says "all your minions are 4/4."  Then along comes Sonya and gives you a minion that's not 4/4.  I think it's ultimately arbitrary and not intuitive which one of the conflicting cards ultimately wins, because it's not really all that clear which is "active" and which is "passive."  I mean, once Sonya makes a minion 1/1, it's every bit as "passive" as when crystal core made it 4/4 - there are two cards which dictate what the minion's attack and defense are, they conflict, one has to trump the other, but again it's ultimately arbitrary to label one as "passive" and one as "active" and it's not particularly intuitive.  I could argue it makes more sense for crystal core to win because it IS more "passive."  It flatly states "complete the quest, play the cards, for the rest of the game your minions are 4/4." The way it's worded sounds like it will trump any other card effect which might change your minion's stats, including things which would BUFF your minions as well.
---
To be clear, I think it's fine that one wins and one doesn't, and having Sonya's effect trump crystal core's is as good an outcome as any I suppose, but I don't agree it just logically flows from how the cards are written.
---
This must be an error.
---
Great job as always, Blizz.
---
Same. Amazon is always slow to update.
---
I think it's more of an unpopular opinion to say that you're ok with it.  As someone who isn't into theorycrafting or deck building this has zero effect on me, in fact it just gives me a better idea what to play on day 1.
---
It's already the way it worked for some things - like how you could Equality them. Are you saying Equality shouldn't make minions buffed by Crystal Core into 1/1s? Because that'd be fucking stupid.
---
He said "Amazing" because he hard runs vaporize in his deck and hes about to put it on the battlefield
---
If the Hunter quest ends up being good Hare will be in it it's a beast so you can still run Master's Call and it summons 3. Whether the Quest will be good is the really questionable part.
---
How about day 1 Bomb Warriors?
---
yall just wait until my beast handbuff paladin takes me to legend. already got to rank 5 with it last season and it's getting more support
---
And thus Brann became a Dinotamer
---
Mainly for Hunter Quest and that's about it. Hare is better in Hunter Quest than Microtech because you can still run Master's Call.
---
And remove doomsayer too
---
What he said.
---
Usually this type of stuff is supposed to rhyme...
---
Because it's cool.
---
(Also the card's very existence is a puzzling enigma. Truly spooky, just like the rest of the Witchwood.)
---
Defending is just attacking where you already stand.
---
Ever wanted to run bloodlust in hunter? This is the price, singleton deck, +2 mana. But now you get to play UTH bloodlust.
---
if you're a divine shield pally running that one card thst gives your 1 health minions divine shield.
---
Microsoft stores are also hosting fireside gatherings for this pre release.  Check your local stores.
---
If you play darkest hour warlock in wild its very possible to get legend with
---
Yeah i agree it's wierd but funny
---
  New Crystal Core Implementation
---
We have updated the functionality of the Rogue quest reward 
---
[Crystal Core](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/41221-crystal-core) in order to address some inconsistencies. This new functionality also applies to Dark Pharaoh Tekahn’s Battlecry effect.
---
* After 
---
* [Crystal Core](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/41221-crystal-core)  is played, the base copies of your minions will now have 4/4 stats. The  stat numbers will appear as white, instead of the green text indicating  a buff. This means that if your opponent steals or silences your  minion, it will remain as a 4/4. 	 
---
* Additionally, minions currently in play will receive a onetime  effect that sets their stats to 4/4, overriding current enchantments and  clearing damage.
---
* Some interactions will change under this new functionality. Cards  that create a copy of a minion with specifically stated stats (

[Sonya Shadowdancer](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/45263-sonya-shadowdancer), [Prince Taldaram](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/45341-prince-taldaram), [Barnes](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/39941-barnes), etc) will now work as written on the card text. For example, the minion summoned by [Barnes](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/39941-barnes) will be a 1/1, instead of a 4/4.

---
In the latest patch, The Darkness only goes dormant on summon, not transform.
---
Priest is not an easy class to play. But it now has a fair amount of "Injured" cards in the pool, which we can heal to get early value/pressure. It has one of the best draw engines in the game. It received an absolute board clear. And the new crop of minions that have decent value.
---
There are a few decks I'd like to try. I don't think that Amet has much promise besides inconsistent combos. But all the other cards given have the potential for play.
---
Huh, my bad. I did mean to use a classic card, but confused Regenerate for the newly added classic priest card that heals.
---
This wins, I think?
---
You are right
---
is bug
---
the fact that rogue can potentially get 50/50 van cleef from burgle prep burgle is not something i want to see xD
---
Happy cake day!
---
Zephrys only gives cards from the basic and classic sets, regardless of which format you're playing in.
---
Would that be such a bad thing? It’s a really cool card.
---
Shouldn't be hard, ya just gotta think real hard.
---
Malygos only for otk decks but Ysera doesnt see play at all. Alex is the best one by far
---
Malygos is the best to build a deck around I feel, Alexstraza is the most versatile as it can go in so many decks and Ysera is excellent in slower metas.
---
Onyxia and Nozdormu aren't really worth putting in a deck (and to my knowledge have never been key parts in any decent deck). I still wouldn't dust them though, owning them at least means you can't re-open them.
---
Neat!  I was looking through some other cards and it does seem like its still in process (some Uldum lines not added yet).  Thanks again!
---
Get out of my swamp.
---
The average players don’t even know a new expansion is coming and don’t watch streams.
---
Auto losing to RNG 20/20 feels much worse than being at a disadvantage of a RNG dormant minion
---
Not sure who you're mentioning but Malganis says "I am Malganis! I am eternal!"
---
 And loot hoarder says
---
"Mind if I roll need?"
---
Last time I was able to host a private one and have it work immediately
---
Blizzard messed it up see Tar Creepers in arena and the new Lackey already available.
---
I tend to pre purchase for the free legend/cardback/hero but then I save up all my gold for a few weeks to buy the adventure with that
---
I meant loot hoarder. That’s always what I thought he said but what does it mean?
---
So I why dust anything? Cards become good as new cards are released. You cost yourself 16 packs.
---
Don't dust stuff.
---
Is it still happening for you? This should have been fixed a few days after it started
---
You mean Blizzard doesn't put in all the changes...
---
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings.
---
Jeeze this is a lot of work. Thanks
---
I can see your point, but dropping us 4 ranks it more of a time sync than actually proving you deserve to be a certain rank, anyone with a 50%+ win rate can climb the ladder.
---
Maybe floating watcher, cause as your dying he says YEEESS
---
Just a bunch of aggro Paladin cards.
---
No card back can beat Naxx’s card back.
---
I don’t get this take. Even if you don’t think it’s a big deal, why would you NOT want free dust?
---
My favorite as well just because of how epic his opening line and music is. I opened him golden but havent had the chance to play him unfortunately
---
Make your own sub
---
For sure, and more so if you see the ridiculous stuff that other classes can do this expansion. I'm just saying it shows promise.
---
Oh really! Thanks for the clarification.
---
Zephyrs only offers cards from basic/classic tho
---
Or, just play Mogu Cultist. 
---
Then play Mogu Cultist.
---
Then you summon the ®️Ancient One!
---
\[\[Vivid Nightmare\]\] says: "Choose a friendly minion. Summon a copy of it with 1 Health remaining. " (Back me up on this pls cardbot).  
---
Based on the wording I would have thought that it's summoned with 1hp left, not summoned then reduced to 1.  
---
This also has me curious about Reborn minions. Does 'Reborn' count as a summon for Amet? If so, does he buff them before or after they're reduced to 1?
---
I would disagree, but okay. Aggro decks are always good at lower ranks when players have less skill to survive them, but it isn’t abuse

3/-/- | Choose a friendly minion. Summon a copy of it with 1 Health remaining.  
---
No, it isn't. Look at the issue tracker on GitHub. It's piling up with unresolved bug reports. Only commits are card updates
---
In Year of the Dragon? Ha! Get real.
---
This system has been tested and proven efficient over and over trough multiple other competitive games with a ladder and season format. You aren't the new genius that can discover that the system is flawed.
---
I understand you feel bad for having to sink 1 hour every month to reach your previous rank (except if your previous rank was legend), but since meta shifts every now and then, keeping up with the metagame is an important skill that the season system evaluates.
---
Something in wow about a need or greed system.

Both are inferior to [league of explorers](https://youtu.be/P8yBrsCagyQ).

You got to keep it.
---
Yes I know because I have a short attention span and I get bored with the deck I'm playing so I go to create another one but I don't have the cards so I need dust to make it....I'm not saying it's the right way to play and I'm sure I cost myself a lot of money doing it this way....luckily I have a good job where I can afford to be stupid like this and it doesn't really affect me....I honestly wish I had the will power to just never disenchant stuff...
---
Damn right
---
How many hours until it is?
---
Ofc This post is more of a humorous post, you knew that, I hope?
---
But what about arena?
---
Just sharing my opinion mate.  ;)
---
The problem with the quest is highrolling to get the reborn minions. And most of them are bad neutrals.
---
But once you complete it you become near-impossible to control.
---
They’re giving people a quest on release I think we can wait 4 days.
---
I would disagree, but hey I like disco a bit more than anthemic music, so it’s really not surprising
---
Uldum is stuck in my head from every single ad on YouTube being that.
---
I always thought it was weird too but there really are f2p's playing hearthstone
---
That does seem weird
---
*don't
---
Perhaps, I'll check again, but there's still very little point for people without pre-order since you can't buy more with gold.
---
Paladin received a lot of weird and different cards this expansion.
---
Yet, I think Murloc paladin is the sleeper of the set and will take most people by suprise.
---
Sorry, I'm just a Swedish idiot.
---
I dont understand this post
---
If someone plays murlocs against you, do you auto lose because you're weak and getting abused?
---
Can anyone confirm how Moroes interact with the quest after this patch?
---
Wow you must be the first one who got this
---
Brightwing
---
oh god, you're right. time for a ton of stuff to test
---
People way over exaggerate how much it speeds up the meta being solved. They're all playing unoptimized decks vs other unoptimized decks. They aren't playing the old meta decks, even though they'll surely be powerful and beat a ton of these optimized decks, because they want to play new stuff. If you don't like it, don't watch it. I don't know why people struggle so much with self control, because the "it's solving the meta whether I watch it or not" argument is just bullshit. I'll gladly take the meta slightly being advanced in exchange for actually being able to see what I'm paying for. Cyclone mage took so long to be found and finally optimized, these streams don't mean shit.
---
I was hoping for some kind of Paladin reborn tutor - or something that buffs your reborn minions. But it seems like they stopped short and you need to use a lot of terrible neutrals while just hoping you draw them.
---
Then you mess up order and you send the darkness into a freezing trap
---
Oh no, this is gonna break mech decks in wild!
---
its bugged for me using the 3/4 shuffle beast aswell. ive tried multiple times and it wasnt shuffling an additional 3 in their deck...
---
What region are you?
---
Quest Shaman is much better than it initially appears.
---
Aggressive Shaman decks are already running Sludge Slurper, and the new **EVIL Totem** provides a soft taunt because of the threat of generating as much value as EVIL Miscreant, alongside **Weaponized Wasp** for tempo in the early game, and burn to close post-completion in the late game. 
---
The new **Sandstorm Elemental** provides incentive to include an elemental package, with Bog Slosher helping to activate the quest, and Menacing Nimubs providing value post-completion, alongside Earthen Might for buffs and even more value.
---
This deck has some bite as an early tempo build, and you can tech your deck to last against control styles as well with cards like **Siamat**, Swampqueen Hagatha, and Shudderwock.
---
Not an unpopular opinion at all. The majority of the community feels the same way.
---
The issue is this game has gotten so hated and so unpopular now that this free advertising with Blizzard giving streamers early access is one of the only ways they have to get people to actually buy the cards.
---
Would've been cool if he got all the options with the druid quest hero power.
---
Crafting him day 1 if I don’t open him in packs. I don’t care if highlander decks are all gonna be tier 3 at best because bomb warrior exists, he’s gonna be the most fun card to play in standard by far
---
I watched firebat play quest shaman and he seemed to outvalue the quest druid but the quest druid he played against seemed to  just throw every single choose one card in the deck. The quest shaman seemed very promising though.
---
Damn. This is really a bruh gamer moment
---
If you have a Steward of Darkshire on board and a mage spellstone in hand on turn 5, Magma Rager should be the best 3-cost minion to play alongside Zephrys.
---
DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY WITH FIRE??!!!
---
I made one starting on the hour and it doesn’t work.
---
yup!
---
You got me :o
---
How current?  I thought he dropped Academic Espionage in favour of Toggwaggle Scheming a dozen Tesses into his deck.
---
Serpent Egg and Wretched Reclaimer in the same pack. Insane synergy!
---
Gamers who ignore politics IRL
---
Yeah it’s pretty annoying
---
Absolutely agreed, I usually watch HS streamers every now and then, but during these periods where they get to spoil the game for everyone else with exclusive access to new expansion, I avoid them like plague.
---
I think its a terrible move on Blizzard to treat players/streamers unequally and spoil your content they way they do.
---
They where still 4/4s when silenced prior

On fireside gatherings

"I met a traveller from an antique land,
---
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
---
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
---
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
---
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
---
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
---
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
---
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
---
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
---
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
---
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
---
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
---
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
---
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
---
Incoming poly
---
Uh right, forgot about that one. Then let's just put a Kobold Monk and a Wee Spellstopper on the enemy board.
---
Can I start one that no one else can join
---
Alexstraza is one of the best followed by Ysera then Malygos in my opinion. Onyxia is pretty meh in constructed, Deathwing is only a last ditch effort kind of card too and Nozdormu is really only for forcing your opponent to make decisions quickly on how to deal with him so they don't have to worry about being roped.
---
:')
---
I feel like people might be sleeping on Ancestral Guardian. Not saying 5 stars, but could turn out to be a 4 star card.
---
It's a lot less durable than a piloted shredder, but really annoying to deal with unless you're a mage. For the other classes, the "optimal" ways to remove it involve healing your opponent for 8 while trading 2 cheap bodies into it, or maybe healing for four and using up a removal resource on a 4 drop.
---
Lightning can strike twice?2?2
---
in the first couple days, yeah, that's ideally how you'd play.
---
Bomb warrior zzzzz
---
80 gold quest trade Euw ; EDetTOMATO#2776
---
Basically defining generations and outing your age.
---
They’re both NOT
---
This expansion is just a lot of piles of stats with a few gimmicky cards thrown in the middle.
---
I came back to Hearthstone after a long hiatus right before they announced SoU. I was amazed - I still am, actually - by the general theme and the return of the Explorers but when they announced the cards - and now that we can see them in play - they were underwhelming. Not in a power level pov, but creativity-wise.
---
The Reborn mechanic is, in the end of the day, just more stats in the form of sticky minions.
---
Forcing synergies for the sake of making them playable is just lazy design. We saw what happened with Dragon Priest back in Gadgetzan. We may see it with some of the archetypes in this epansion as well (the impact of some new Secret Mage cards in Wild will be huge).
---
If you guys have been following Thijs stream today, the Druid quest deck is pretty powerful. We all know that Fandral's effect is powerful and when you're able of summoning double 5/5 Rush for 5 mana, you know you have a strong effect at hand. 2 mana 1/4 "at the end of the turn, draw a card" is also really strong.
---
And then we get some cards like "swap the top card of your deck" which we all know won't have much of an impact overall.
---

&gt; *Doot doot doot doot doot \[Pause\] Doot doot doot doot doot DEE doot doot doot doot doot!*
---
Well you are gurenteed a legendary in the first 10 packs...
---
Because they didn't intend to give it to us. Come on man, it's really not rocket science.
---
&gt;because freezing is fun and interactive
---
Disabling your opponents minion so it can't kill you is the definition of interactive. You can even interact with freeze.
---
Hard removal lmao
---
noice :) wish I had a pic of darkmanes evil smile from that jojo meme video by footballhead
---
You can only open the preorder packs
---
You can register an unlisted one, but I'm not sure about requirements - you'll need to ask google for more info.
---
At least you got good leggies! If it makes you feel good, I got bad luck my last opening, it happens. :(
---
Hmm, I like it.
---
Why would people want to play single player content during a fireside brawl that doesn’t make much sense.
---
From the reveal stream, Kibler was able to pull off the quest at around turn 5 which is not bad
---
Kalimos, and I dont even have him. Elementals are just fair and a lot of fun to string together
---
he implied that it was uninteractive which is just ridiculous.
---
It wasn't originally like that so technically it is a new idea.
---
These packs even at this sale price aren't even close to a good deal
---
No. Zephyr is a coooool card, every one wants him. So. They. Buy. Packs. Its industry, think like a big company.
---
#1600 dust fk u Blizz lel
---
Wat did the expansion release already????
---
Reno mage looks fun! And some people speculate quest deathrattle paladin to be quite decent. Don’t underestimate it yet! :)
---
No it's a nerf to how a single card works, just like the saronite change, which resulted in a refund for saronite but not shudderwock, which is why ppl want a refund dust for the quest but not for sonya.
---
And fuck you for telling me to stop crying. I don't care about the dust but a blind fish could see that this is a nerf.
---
Zero mana ring the bells was worse
---
It looks even sadder when you think the reborn mechanic is not going to have any other support in the future
---
How did you get it
---
These were probably changes made to implement the new legendary that makes your lackeys 4/4s.  Who knows if these were intended side effects though.
---
Wow, your hunch may be correct! 
---
I opened Zephyr on my fourth pack, Corrupt the Waters (shaman quest) on my 8th. Was a really good start.
---
 A bit disappointed I only ended up grabbing one other leggo in my remaining 45 cards, on my 27th card (Dinomancer Brann), but I guess I really can't complain with an opening like that, haha.
---
Hopefully my freebies aren't the mage quest and sir Finley cuz I already opened crappy Reno and the paladin quest. Bunch of garbage.
---
decent deck or win position equals sure disconnect for me no matter what internet i’m on.
---
"Am I the only one who..."
---
No. No you are not. Regardless of whatever you plan on typing next. There will always be someone who agrees with you. You don't need to fish for agreement.
---
I'm not misunderstanding you. It does not affect the meta. Everybody saying this has no understanding of what meta is and how it takes millions a games and thousands of decks to develop. This is what I am arguing here.
---
Do you write have a good day after every post? No, you don't. You were being passive aggressive. Own it.
---
Damn man, that sucks. Hope you get a good golden legendary!
---
Oh right... I guess I mean what if you fucked up your turn ordering then lol
---
Well there's a lot of build arounds or legendaries that shape decks this time around with quests and highlander. Just look at those options and choose what interests you the most.
---
Golden rafaam is really cool, little bit jealous. Its not very good in plot twist tho :( since you have specific minions you want to get out. Its fun in zoo tho, but i understand that you dont like it. It might see play in the new lackey warlock? Which legendaries you are hoping to get from the real release?
---
They don't have the internet? Don't be so hyperbolic and ridiculous. I obviously meant they only play the game casually and do not consume content from those platforms.
---
I don't watch streamers, literally ever. I don't get it, I never have, and probably never will. Others like it, that is fine, but Twitch just isn't for me.
---
Furthermore, no I don't have "proof" in terms of having access to Blizzards numbers. 
---
If you haven't met anyone like this you are either living in a bubble or you aren't looking. I have more irl friends that play hearthstone but have never been to the hearthstone subreddit, twitch, or watched hearthstone youtube videos (unless I have shown them highlight clips personally) than irl friends who engage in those platforms and play hearthstone. 
---
My wife is a classic example btw, she plays hearthstone casually on her phone but has never once even been to twitch, reddit of any kind, and while she watches plenty of things on youtube none of them are hearthstone related.
---
1 mana ocotosari, Baleful banker, mischief maker, hecklebot, double prep, walk the plank.
---
Yeah, I have the same problem. Unsurprisingly still not a single response from Blizzard about this
---
The best jam is a toe jam.
---
Yeah, I didn't rank it strongly purely on the not-amazing quality of reborn cards.
---
I will open around 72 packs or so with gold so better luck Tuesday I guess.
---
Wait , really lol? Any other decks/decklists? I have a tourney on sunday and tavern boss said its with these decks
---
133 packs 6 leggies any of my fellow brothers on suicide watch?
---
When you are playing against a mage.
---
Quest Warlock will be insane, but only in zoo version deck
---
People actually try to climb ladder in 2019? Do you guys hate yourself?
---
Just posted this above, but I think this works when they are on fatigue:
---
Good point. This speeds up the "wait for the meta to settle to craft" part. Don't think people consider that. 
---
I won't be pre ordering this set, can't afford it at the moment. Which means I'm gonna be dust and card starved. 
---
If decent decks show up by launch, I'll have an idea of what to build towards pretty early on.
---
I think you wont get duplicates. You will get the legendaries at the release the 6th
---
As someone who plans on playing totem shaman at launch, mind if I get a decklist?
---
Who cares
---
Do you have difficulty reading? I said “do they not go on the Internet?” Not that they don’t have Internet.
---
“I don’t have proof I just have a strong feeling therefore I’m right.”
---
You expect people to preorder $80 knowing nothing about the set save for maybe the new mechanics? I'm a whale and still haven't preordered even after all reveals and would never again without reveals.
---
Of course Blizzard disagrees. They don't want to give out refunds. Doesn't mean people shouldn't call them out when they nerf decks, but call it a consistency issue to avoid giving out dust. 
---
Also downvote doesn't equal disagree.
---
This is what I wanna know. I got insanely lucky this pack opening. 11/23 legendaries(2 golden). Getting the free quest and two golden legendaries that arent copies would be awesome.
---
Does it only work for preorders or can I spend gold to open packs?
---
Where have you been when Dalaran Heist final wing came out? Every 5 minutes a different dumbass would post a screenshot highlighting 0 mana Sound the Bells, and I still see a new thread almost every day.
---
Priest quest seems super easy to complete, pally looks rough
---
Thank you. I am 100% with you on this.
---
Can you please just remove it from the pool?
---
Amet is a whenever effect so it happens early. The wording on Vivid Nightmare says summon a copy and then set the health to 1. When the minion gets copied, Amet is setting the health to 7 before the second part of Vivid's effect which triggers afterwards to set the health to 1.
---
ya the paladin quest has lots of potential. it looks pretty awesome in the streams.
---
[removed]
---
Wait, does that mean the Uldum cards are already available in Arena?
---
Still wish we get wild packs again someday. Still don't have a guaranteed legendary from unguro
---
Yeah sorry it’s such a delayed response, I saw the OP was being mentioned as someone significant after he posted some flavor text so I looked through his post history, saw this post, saw your comment, responded and then realized it was 127 days ago. My bad man, it was just in regards to you saying bombs should still go off when drawn even if your hand is full.
---
Are those doots meant to be du's
---
I'm torn between what I should spend my gold on. My funds are limited, so I can't really purchase anything, but I have 2,000 gold saved up right now, and probably more by the time the set comes out next week.
---
The problem is, is that I just got back into the game after being away from it for a couple years, so I don't have any of the last few sets that are currently in Standard either. Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan all look amazing, I love their themes, and I really want to get them, but each pack that I buy is one less pack from the new set I will get.
---
Another problem, is that Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan all rotate out of standard before Rise of Shadows and the upcoming set will, so there's a better return on investment to get rise of shadows or the new set then those.
---
So what do I do?
---
Sometime after turn 5 in the "wildest" aggro seas...
---
Better than Nozdormu, Onyxia, and arguably Deathwing
---
Say it ain't so, I will not go
---
&gt;That would yield you a general value for each card, but it would not at all take into account the current board/game state.
---
No, the heuristic function would apply to the current board state.
---
&gt;You would have to calculate a value for every single possible game state against every single available card.
---
No, the heuristic simplifies from that.
---
In Standard, sure. This is Wild. A 1/245 chance to get a 20/20 isn't great. But if we're talking about high rolls, *in Wild* remember:
---
Warlocks can put out 35/36 in stats on turn 3 that makes spells cost 4 more.     
---
Paladins can drop 19/19 in stats on turn 3.     
---
Priests can put out 14/16 in stats on turn 3 that will pull two minions from their deck at the end of their next turn.     
---
The Darkness should probably be hard removed from the evolve/devolve pool altogether. But honestly, having it be a 20/20 is so very much healthier than it being dormant. Nothing quite like a Shaman devolving one of your 5 drops and now you can only have six minions.
---
People are forgetting that all that happened before this  was people played old decks longer into a new expansion. I remember facing tons of pirate warriors and cubelocks during this glorified “experimental” phase in years past.
---
Odd Warrior was fucking stupid, the hero power negating 4 points of damage a turn means aggro has no choice but to overextend right into the inevitable boardclears.
---
Tbh I didn't mind the Even decks that much, they were all just solid midrange decks.  But the Baku hero power was one of the worst ideas.
---
Something about playing for free?
---
Are there any extreme low rolls in standard for yogg box? I don't think so anymore since they all rotated out.
---
And the last time they made a consistency change like this (Dreadsteed to allow for Defile) they offered a dust refund. So what's your point?
---
No worries! Just threw me for a loop for a second haha
---
I’m using it in Tess rogue it’s not bad
---
What about if u had that priest legendary onboard that gives ur minion 7 health turn 1
---
Played zepherys turn 2, then a turn 3 5/7 is pretty good?
---
Not played these, will definitely give thema go. Have you got deck codes by any chance?
---
 Looking for somebody to spectate for a pack
---
NA: Tango#1367
---
Thanks :)
---
Omg someone give a prize to this guy, posting about the new lackey for the 1000th time.
---
It is quite a full leg under the average.  First 10 pack is guaranteed a leg then you go to guaranteed 1:40, average 1:20.  So average for 53 packs would be a bit over 3.
---
[Tempostorms says](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/wild/2019-07-26) that Odd Rogue, Odd Pally, and Even Shaman are all T1, with Odd Warrior and Even Warlock in T2.
---
You act like half the minions odd pally runs arent 1 hp minions. It also gets divine shield from [[Steward of Darkshire]]. This will be included
---
Epic teams
---
The treasure that replaces ALL cards for both players with random legendaries. He had a token creature of his turn into Majordomo that I killed for an easy lethal.

3/3/3 | Whenever you summon a 1-Health minion, give it Divine Shield.

Might be the feeling of having a 1/1 turn huge then slapping a face?
---
DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY WITH.. MAIEV!?
---
Hearthstone spaghetti code is ridiculous...
---
Can u please hit myras on turn 6? Im still trying to do it!
---
Achukachu#2723 EU Trading 80g quest. Please go first. See my log to verify I have done this many times.. thanks
---
F
---
For RoS I only got 3 legendaries + 1 free golden from the 80 bundle. I'm hoping I will have amazing luck this time because it wasn't fair last time lmao.
---
Yeah thats probably it lmao
---
I don't think that's it, since most similar cards work. Also it specifies "if you control ANOTHER mech" so even if the effect would have been delayed to the end of turn, it still shouldn't trigger off itself.
---
But I also don't have any explaination about why this suddenly stops working like it's supposed to. HS bugs rly amaze me, I think to at least have a vague idea how games work and then stuff like this happens which I start questioning everything.
---
Thanks man, this used to be on hearthpwn, but they skipped last two.
---
Dammit! I knew I was forgetting something!
---
It's be a pain to look or do another Yogg Analysis.  You basically gotta break each spell down to categories and outcome.  Board Clear, Draw, Amazing, Bad, etc.
---
Opened 133: 11 legendary 31 epic 26 golden. 
---
Also of note I got 164 rares of which 8 were grand mummy, 7 were plague of madness, 10 were tomb warden (including 2 golden) and 8 wrapped golems. I hated seeing the same ones over and over but lots of dust I guess.
---
Not today Satan
---
That's a good one. That and Maly druid are my wild decks because I like playing them.
---
Yes and no, I got zephrys, but no other singleton one, got the priest quest which could be nice. But to counteract that I got collossus of the moon which I consider the worst/least interesting.
---
You can do anything, I’m just saying I don’t think it’s good almost ever
---
Hey Sharkonabicycle, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
I don't understand why you people think this needs to be explained.
---
I just wish they would ban the cards or rotate them out instead of shitting on them.
---
Damn this is funny
---
Got only 6 legendaries in 133 packs, same result as Rise of Shadows... rng gods are failing me :/
---
Yes. It's a casual deck that I like to play.
---
I got 11 in 133 and 3 of them golden. Am I lucky?
---
Actually 13. Forgot about Elise and The quest
---
It's not that hard to have a secret in play. The new secret is pretty good and there's even a new card that adds a secret to your hand. Even if you play it on turn 5 it's still a 4 mana 7/7 with no drawbacks in one of the best decks of the set. Sounds pretty good to me
---
Well the pic says that "Minions that summon minions will summon 4/4" so I can bet that Moroes will summon 4/4's
---
Weird flex but ok
---
&gt;bad in the mirror
---
For what? Having one health?
---
It can just end the game if it's behind a taunt minion so why wouldn't I play it?
---
No, you can look at resources like pitytracker.com and the ratio of rarities in packs has never changed.  2 million+ packs data set.
---
He's saying he's lucky to get a legendary for every 30 packs he opens
---
Crazy man... which legendaries golden? I was 6/133 =(  only a golden arm (but I like taunt warrior - I loved the quest taunt war), but at least of the other 6 siamat, rogue/priest legend and dark pharoh were included.... \*looks down and to the side\* and that lame druid 1 of each card....
---
- Approximately Alfred
---
Poor warlock not getting any love
---
I can also confirm that I've set up a fireside gathering, and we're experiencing the same exact problem that the OP is. This is pretty lame, I gotta say.
---
&gt;So do I, in trhingg to run a control quest mage with Janali, khadgar power of creation, etc. Hope it works with the value from spells every turn
---
I ran power of creation for so long but found it lacking sadly, sometimes I got minions that were just really bad.

I mean, he's dismissing OP as not that unlucky, when OP is as unlucky as mathematically possible.

That has nothing to do with the piano unfortunately. You can open and close the gate by clicking on one of the stones in front of it. This reveals an item belonging to one of the four explorers.
---
He also makes some incredible budget deck guides. Can't wait to see what budget decklists he comes up with for SoU.
