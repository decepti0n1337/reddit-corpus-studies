I don't know how many murlocs in standard currently have battlecries - I can think of three. [[Sludge Slurper]], [[Murloc Tidehunter]], and [[Coldlight Oracle]]. I'm thinking it could maybe see play in a more midrange shaman, where Whitemane could potentially let you swing the board in your favour by trading in your murlocs against other board-centric decks, because even unbuffed murlocs can be dangerous. Shudderwock might be overkill in that sort of deck, though.

They clearly only care about putting interesting cards in packs. Writing about it now is really making me think about how fucking greedy they really are. I up-voted your comment three times btw, its just the same as doing it once.
---
Because they've never printed cards that alter the meta in future expansions...  :p
---
Right, that would be 3 mana. Why does it cost 5?
---
Do we know when the update hits? We‚Äôre a month and a half away from the next expansion, so it‚Äôs not crazy early and it may make their lives easier to do it sooner than the set.
---
Maybe someone spectating you? Haven't played in a while though so I don't know
---
So how the fuck do you describe *every copy effect in the game* as card gen just because it can be used to copy card gen?
---
Do you call Faceless Manipulator a charge? Do you call it a mana cost reduction tool? Do you call it a taunt? I sure as fuck hope not.
---
Sure it has a huge difference in consistency but also gives you a 2/2 weapon as well. True you only get divine shield every 1/4 times but even if we add a mana for consistency reasons (which seems to be how blizzard handles consistency given cases such as implosion and feeding time) it‚Äôs still around 4 mana if you include a 2/2 weapon. Honestly it seems like they intend to make classic cards as horrible as possible.
---
&gt; classic cards are playable: ‚Äúgame is so stale it‚Äôs the same decks over and over‚Äù
---
Rubbish. Having more viable decks does not make the game more stale just because some of those viable decks were viable last year too. What makes the game stale is overpowered decks that reduce the meaningful size of the deck pool, and degenerate decks that make the core mechanics of the game break down.
---
ooh, I like this idea
---
Flavorwise, they would know. But you still want something that ties it in, the basic set is meant to be a showcase, a collection that shows off the classes mechanics.
---
They still do interesting cards, but in expansions not basic.

Yea. Basically. I didn't shred any commons, and i opened a playset of the rares i wanted, but i shredded everything else and got 4240 total.

Once I saw the laughing Turkish guy weigh in on the Dev Insights, I know one of the OG reaction memes had to get in on the program.
---
Okay my friend wants to play along.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My friend opened a double golden legendary pack (both are insta dust never used) as well as a few more and plenty of epics.  My friend was so lucky!!!
---
Your friend could have never opened one of those packs and since the pity timer is at 10 they could technically never open a legendary and get hosed.  Really depends on your friend's pity timer and how many cards they own.  I would say if they just straight dusted everything 3-4k would be normal.
---
Get outta here with this blatant repost
---
Thanks!
---
Man, context, seriously. What people are jumping to conclusions in our comment section (not the whole thread)?
---
Our replies were about Vanish and Mind Blast being common cards or not. Even I told him about him saying about the dust part "why are you adding this?" Referring that I don't nor he does not know they're adding dust so it would better not to discuss that as it doesn't give anything of value.
---
The original commenter never mentioned that we're getting dust nor did I, so I don't know why you are adding this as we don't know anything besides the cards are getting HoF and becoming common now.
---
Still feels cool to play though as a casual f2p newb
---
Thanks for this! I guess I was just unlucky facing a bunch in a row. I'm playing mage but my strats at this point can probably be summed up as "uh, it seems like these cards work together", so I'm probably just losing because I'm bad.
---
Would still lose to Haro Setting Sun.
---
Ahh okay. I don‚Äôt remember but it‚Äôs a good possibility. I seem to have a 50% success rate with screen shots as opposed to turning off my phone.
---
Interesting how Thrall summons 3 Tauren totems (or classic totems for Horde) and 1 Draenei totem
---
Power creep but when the older card are better. This card will never see wild play I guess.....
---
My god, is that legal?
---
Please don‚Äôt
---
I'm doing God's work. Needs to be done my friend.
---
&gt; should clarify that these are our current and future identity goals and have changed from what we've previously been doing
---
Thats literally the fitst passage of the blog post is but noone read it anyway
---
The nerf to the mage one does make this card seems more reasonable
---
They literally did too.  "Please give us your feedback."  They didn't say "please only give us your praise."  And people would laugh at them if they did.
---
Congrats! Mage is great in this arena meta. My mage runs have been amazing and my non-Mage runs get beat by mages a lot
---
The idea is that if they didn't HOF Vanish, then they're prohibited from creating more Pogo-ish type cards in the future.
---
I tend to agree with cycling Classic/Basic cards but I don't blame Blizzard for not wanting to go down that path.
---
No
---
Lol it's a kid's game
---
True as that may be, classic cards that are garbage in standard are even more garbage in wild.
---
Is the statue also a card in heartstone i dont know about?
---
Nice thank you I love you too
---
I think their plan for the future looks really bad, and looks like a departure from the class identities that have existed in some form, more or less consistently, since before Naxx.
---
I like the kind of Rogue decks that use Vanish.  Always have.  If Rogue isn't about playing clever, tricky, fragile value decks, but only face all the time, then I guess I don't want to play Rogue.
---
The class identity is meant to be represented in the basic and classic sets. Meanwhile rotating sets will be able to bring in new cards that fill weak spots if blizzard want to push that for whatever reason. Hence losing the classic card naturalize while cards like mulch exist.
---
The first king of Amber.
---
I mean, MTG's Modern format is a world where decks that can't win the game by turn 3 had better have a _ton_ of interaction or disruption, because otherwise you're gonna get whacked by a Death's Shadow, or Tron's gonna stick one of the Karns to start locking you out, or Burn is gonna finish depleting your health total, or Hogaak or a swarm of Arclight Phoenixes are going to burst out of the graveyard to wipe you out.
---
And that isn't even the proper eternal format, since Modern only goes back to 8th edition. For that, you want either Legacy (all cards with a reasonable ban list) or Vintage (all cards, no ban list, a handful of cards restricted to 1-ofs in a deck), and now you're talking about turn 1 or 2 kills (like sticking a 20/20 Indestructible or an 11/11 Infect, Trample, Indestructible on turn 2). Or you can get into Commander, which is super casual... unless, of course, you find yourself in a _competitive_ Commander game, in which case your deck better threaten an infinite combo in the first few turns of the game with a variety of redundant support or you're going to be a redundant fourth wheel at the table.
---
Magic gets bloody _disgusting_ once you get into eternal formats, a consequence of the game having 25 years of questionable design decisions and an utter inability to patch cards post-launch. There's a good chance that the Magic Arena eternal format will be a bit fairer, since it'll only have an extra year or two of sets... at first. Give it a few years, though, and I'm sure it'll move towards the same place that Modern currently rests.
---
You investing into while ages either through excessive daily play for years or just like you paid money back then.

I somewhat disagree with this. If every class had almost everything, then what would be the whole point of classes in the first place?
---
I'm sorry, WHAT??
---
If you think the 4th most played class is "absolute shit" wait until you see standard Priest and Warlock both played about a third as much as Shaman. I agree though that card draw is such an important part of card games that making it a permanent weakness for some classes is a poor choice. If they kill off neutral ways to draw cards then some classes will have even more trouble making viable decks.

True... But idk i wouldn't care 5g are 5g.

I think we've passed saturation already. Have you played much Lyra of late? With 7 zero mana, 14 one mana, and 13 two mana spells, you tend to get way too much junk to make Lyra very useful in Wild.

---

---
cool dots
---
Wait for the next expansion. In 6 weeks the meta will greatly shift. Then, just craft a decent budget deck.
---
If you don't have the patience, then craft a deck that uses as many cards from your (small) collection as possible. You can connect your account with HSreplay and browse through decks and see what they cost for you specifically.
---
I assume because vigilance is secondary green and flying is secondary black (...not sure what happened to blue, but I guess it's more black than red)
---
I'd make themed decks. At that point, assuming I have access to all cards, packs are no longer something I want, so gold and therefore winning games is useless. So, I'd just make decks like "The Mega-Mech Deck" or make the most broken aggro, midrange, and control decks possible. Druid armor + warrior's armor synergy + rogue's fatigue would make for great 45 minute games. Really, when you can use all carfs, you can ignore each class's weaknesses.
---
...with a 1/4 chance
---
They need to keep up the pretense of accessibility to new players
---
Better than the bile and self-righteousness you must be chugging down to genuinely believe that you're justified in making personal attacks against people because you don't like the decisions they made in the design of their game. You pathetic child.
---
I mean, they've been trying to push deathrattle synergies, so they keep printing good deathrattle synergy cards, it's just... Rogue doesn't have any deathrattle cards that are actually good themselves lol

As I replied to your other profile:
---
I can understand C'thun for sure, that's a clear case. Nobody likes having all the acolytes without C'thun, and it makes sense to prevent dusting or people would dust and then regret.
---
But I still feel Vargoth and Marin to be on the same line.
---
The purpose of basic is not to have playable and competitive cards.
---
Hooktusk rogue is currently unplayable trash.
---
If you are F2P and intend to stay that way you have to accept the fact that you won't be able to play a large number of meta decks and might have to settle for budget versions of them. Now, if you intend to play this game for a longer time, dusting cards is usually a bad idea. Unless they are absolute trash no matter what, like the Warrior Scheme or Duskfallen Aviana etc. 
---
The best idea is to think long term. Be smart about what you dust and even smarter when thinking what you want to craft. For example, a Legendary might be a perfect fit *right now* for a certain meta deck, but before crafting think is that Legendary good enough to stand the test of future expansions? You can safely assume stuff like Zilliax or Leeroy Jenkins will never go out of style, but a Heistbaron Togwaggle or Barista Lynchen can be very niche. Figure out if a certain card is absolutely necessary to make your deck work and if so, craft it. Usually the case with a legendary  is that the deck is slightly better with it but you can do without it, unless it is a build around card like Captain Hooktusk. 
---
The case with Epics is a bit harder because having two of them can sometimes be essential to make the deck work, but the same niche thinking applies here as well. A Crystalsong Portal can be a perfect card for spell-heavy Druid builds but once that archetype falls in power that card will essentially turn useless and you can have success with that type of Druid without that card. Then again a completely opposite case are cards like Doomsayer, which will forever be a useful tool for slower decks to help aggro stop in its tracks.
---
TL;DR: only get rid of cards that are totally useless, and in the case of legendaries, only after you have stopped buying packs for that set so you don't open the same bad leggo again. And make that dust count, don't craft cards you will only use for a short time.
---
vorgoth is part of a set. marin was more like a gift card designed outside of the set which has almost no effect, and was released early. cthun was after the first rotation, there were so few cards that they felt like people need something they can at least play, probably.
---
By the way, that's only a hurtful "insult" if you're homophobic and insecure in your sexuality. 
---
So perhaps, instead of crying over a card game, you should be considering what your posts say about yourself and looking to better yourself. Have a nice day
---
AI is controlled by servers, so no
---
Addionally to this - when Nozari (also a bronze dragon) was released in Rise of shadows people pondered if they were a reference to Reno as they restore Both players to full health while Reno restores only his player to full health.
---
Pretty much - there's a few ways things can get a bit uglier (non-targetted removal, of course) but overall it's a combo that goes from stealth being "ok but not great" to "wow, OP". In particular, even without any supporting cards like Mal'ganis it's also quite good in act 2, provided you can get the Obliterator boss (it shuts down his hero power, which is the hardest part of the fight).
---
Am I the only one that thinks this is a money-driven change though? Removing the stronger basic cards so they can 'redefine the meta' every rotation to me just sounds like they want to sell more packs each rotation.
---
They can do what they want but that doesn't mean people have to put up with it.
---
Hits hero, EZ game.
---
but random is useless at this statline, look at weaponized pinata
---
if you convince blizzard to rewrite their ai and the way they store your cards, sure
---
and then you smack it with multiple magnetics and it never gets off board. Genius
---
But to be honest here, Blizzard is the epitome of lack of understanding of game design and what the fans actually want. You talk about a company that let DoTA slip under their nose to a competitor cause they didnt realise what they had.
---
How many times have you used Weaponized Pinata?
---
he is right tho even though he said that in a rude manner.
---
When the Axe breaks, it gives a minion with Rush +2/+1.
---
Dr. Boom passively gives your Mechs rush, so the buff applies.
---
The same thing would apply to a minion buffed by [[Rocket Boots]], or any Pirates pulled by [[Captain Hooktusk]].
---
Its the cyclone that makes the deck bullshit and sadly it massively overpowered quest mage in wild.

---
Any deck that can take the board quicker. Then you just kill all their mechs so they can‚Äôt magnetize anything and just win through board control. Rogue is usually a good counter cause you have tempo cards like backstab and si7 agent to take board quickly.
---
In that relevant time frame blizzard spend most of their resources and 8 years of work in order to develop a little game called "world of warcraft" you might have heard of it. It was decently succesful i'd say... 
---
Also riot games and dota 2 was founded by parts of the original dota team. 
---
And until september 2018 blizzards stockprice grew insanely fast, they produced one hit after another.
---
Then they crashed and discontinued Hots esports.
---
Then sales and their PR began to crash as their long term games became slowly old  and they had a few PR problems but until then.
---
They created so many well designed gaming hits they are definitly one of the big quality game design companies out there. 
---
Warcraft 3 sold 3 million times, overwatch and diabolo 3 over 30 million copies. 
---
Blizzard is know for clean game design, they take their time and don't rush releases that's part of why they lost the dota race. 
---
(Originally they planned to support the starcraft 2 world editor modding scene in order to keep the warcraft 3 mods alive and developed Hots as a starcraft dota mod in the beginning)
---
(But that didn't work out)
---
You can say a lot about blizzard and you can criticise them for many decisions (especially in the last few years. (You can check for those things on your phone assuming you have one)
---
But one thing is clear:
---
"Blizzard is the epitome of lack of understanding of game design " 
---
Is such a bullshit statement that i had to write a whole god damn wall of text about it.
---

---
Try mech priest. It contains mostly common cards and snip snap. My bf made this deck and it‚Äôs super powerful. I don‚Äôt have a list of all the cards he uses for it but it‚Äôs pretty easy to build.
---

---

---

There have been plenty of people who come on /r/wildhearthstone and admit they dusted all their Wild cards and regretted it. Had to recraft Reno myself, too. 
---
Anyway, it's up to you. Seems like you might be scrounging for spare dust to fuel a standard deck. Instead, you can try to invest in a good Wild deck and only update it every so often whenever we get a new expansion.

Dworkin tho?

It's easiest in the sense you don't have to have a large collection and make specific decks for each boss. I'd say because it's self-contained it's the most fair.
---

Thanks.
---
Imagine my reaction when I opened about 40 booms day packs and my second legendary at 37th pack was morrigan.
---
Dr. Morrigan does not deserve her own legendary spell
---
&gt; Look at the discussion around Rotting Regisaur in M20. It's (probably) terrible but it's getting a lot of discussion and it'll see a lot of playtesting. That wouldn't happen if they made sure no card was ever "bad."
---
We're talking about cards that are bad by design and not just because balancing a huge upside with a huge downside is hard.
---
&gt; You don't need to, but it makes for a more interesting game when you do.
---
Which is more interesting: Rotting Regisaur earning a place in some Madness/Hellbent deck somewhere, or throwing Rotting Regisaur in the trash when you discover it's never worth putting in any deck worth playing?
---
Of course there's support for it, they've been making cards like that for 2 expansions now for Mage. Doesn't change the fact it can be used for removal. If it wasn't meant to be flexible, it would say friendly only. Like I said before, the card is used how it's supposed to, but I don't think Blizzard intended for the giant interaction as much as you'd like to think.
---
gz! Now try every other class with anomaly mode :D
---
even crazier synergies, every run is different, I'm really enjoying these.
---
blizzard is modeled by their chinese micro transition masters now
---
A website that removes messages that have been downvoted, and people seeing downvoting as not agreeing, is automatically awful for discussion. Not sure why forums are "obsolete and archaic", but any sort of flat system without filtering is a much better indicator and much less prone to the circlejerk.
---
Yeah, I did mention those things in my problems section. But since this topic is about an issue in design philosophy, I think it's helpful to look at it from the perspective I took instead of what is meta or not.
---
And my counter point that most people are ignoring is that cards like Kragwa, Underbelly Angler, and Hagatha require you to make inefficient plays: play a 6 mana 4/6 instead of addressing the board or spend 8 mana on a minor board clear (that clears yours as well) so you can generate random cards next turn. Angler is more efficient, but it's also in the "strengths" bucket for Shaman as a murloc.  
---
I don't know what you mean by this though
---
&gt; Not to mention the post wasn't about the current set of cards anyway.
---
&gt; The resource generation of Hagatha is enough to spawn a deck that relies enterally in generating resources with Hagatha.
---
From his post:
---
&gt;The main problem is it is difficult to assess combo potential/ meta/ deckbuilding this way. It's also hard to assess cards like Hagatha that generate a lot of cards over time. Debating the efficiency of Hagatha could be a post of its own, but if someone wants to talk about it, that's fine.
---
Want to argue? Want constructive criticism? Do a good post about it with every card draw/generator weighted based on their power, don't just spite poison.
---
Literally UNPLAYABLE.
---
I had an opinion and made an effort to demonstrate it using facts instead of memes.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
There is a huge difference between an 6/6 that costs eight and 4/4 that costs 10. At 4/4 most removal will work 6/6 is much harder to remove with 0 board presence.
---
ok, i suppose this means isnt true cuz orange guy...? an interesting argument
---
Get ready to fall in love with Loatheb

Just like what you did requires banana buffoon by turn 3 and elemental evocation, mountain giant, coin, conjurer's calling by turn 4?

Thank you for being responsible and searching for answers yourself rather than just lazily asking in the comments when there might have been hundreds of people who have already answered the question
---
BRAIN INFECTED
---
It's really strange Priest has no cards that perform favors for the opponent [restore 10 health to the enemy hero] to hit them in other ways [destroy their minions].
---
&gt; has shaman been designed with a comparatively weak ability to draw/generate cards?
---
Well, I think not, or at least not lately. In Withwood shaman got a lot of cards that generates more cards (spells mainly). If your objective was  to rise questions, I think you should had writen the post in a way that invites discussion, but it felt like " you are all wrong and here's the statistical proof.
---
I would call that control shaman with a plan other than exhaust my opponent of resources. I'd call it a late game focused token shaman at worst. Even if we do say that list is aggro-overload shaman, you said that Hagatha was good in those lists.
---
It's difficult to find a stereotypical control shaman with enough games to not have a warning sign about low data. But here is VS's most recent control Shaman https://hsreplay.net/decks/kfYbNXfQEtqIxPbEEUBoZc/
---
Hagatha is very middle of the road in that deck when played and drawn. It has the 3rd best mulligan winrate, but also only 580 games played, so the stats are quite unreliable. Do you have stats to share?
---
&gt; Sometimes you do lose if you hit zero but would have gone back to positive health.
---
Do you have an example?
---
Morrigan‚Äôs Mulligan
---
You're stretching way too hard.  Conjurer's calling is not inherently a big minion card, it mostly gets used to summon big minions because of the neutral giants.  It would actually be a pretty strange druid card, druids are about growth and nature, not sacrificing their allies for a completely random outcome (random card generation being very much in mage's wheelhouse).  
---
If anything it would probably fit best as a warlock card, with the sacrifice theme.  But nothing they say about mage suggests it shouldn't be a mage card, mage's biggest strength is just spells, and calling is a pretty good spell.  
---
It's ridiculous to treat the statements they made about class identity like this.  They provide a general theme for what the class should be good at, not a measuring box to stick every card in the game into to make sure they fit.  Cards that do something a class is explicitly supposed to be weak at really well (like spreading plague) look odd, but there is a lot of grey area and saying calling doesn't fit in mage is drawing a pretty arbitrary line through that grey area.
---
I play moonfire and pounce in my Nomi Druid deck! No *wonder* the win rate is so low /s
---
What‚Äôs your decklist like? And is the deck rather hard to play?  I would say I‚Äôm only an intermediate player.
---
Hmm, That's not the way I meant it. I'll work on that.
---
Some of the pros were putting wisp in their Rogue decks before the nerfs, so it makes sense they wouldn‚Äôt be bottom 5.
---
Jerk it harder, jerk it better
---
Jerk it faster, makes us stronger
---
More than ever, hour after hour
---
Jerk is never over
---
I respect Dr. Morrigan for her decision. She understands that the true value is in the science, and not in having your name applied to your life's work.
---
Yeah man. It's a game finisher, but what good is a game finisher if 4/30 of the cards are a card that requires minions to be viable? I doubt anyone would put a 3rd or 4th in their deck in constructed even if they could lol
---
If I told you mages could auto-win games because of pyro-blast, fireball, and frostbolts, ... would you agree? 
---
I mean, opponents start at negative health, right?
---
Also, for the argument not to be biased, you would have to do a complete inventory of all heal and damage spells for every class.
---
Wisp is played in some Tempo Rogue builds - I've seen a few at high Legend. It's rare, but happens.
---
Moonfire, on the other hand, is useless now, because slow Druid build suck (ramp was nerfed and best cards rotated out with RoS) and Sac Pact doesn't really make sense when there are no Demons in the meta. So no real surprises here.
---
The chart is about what's played RIGHT NOW, not how good the cards are. I'd say that in general, both Moonfire and Sac Pact are better than Wisp, just not right now.
---
Not I'm questioning when I saw it. It was definitely one of those "play back a series of event" type things, and my opponent was, I think... Warlock? Now I'm fuzzy on the exact timing; **But the point remains that there are tricky situations where you can have negative health and not be dead.**
---
Wisp saw play relatively recently. 
---
I don't think he's the pioneer, but [Firebat](https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/firebats-wisp-tempo-rogue-rise-of-shadows-deck-list-guide) put Wisp in a Lackey Rogue and played it in a tournament. It was one of the tech inclusions in Rogue before the most recently nerfs because it guarantees a combo enabler for EVIL Miscreant on 3.
---
Bogdanux#2208 NA 80g quest trade. I can show you first, but I‚Äôd appreciate if you went first. Thanks!
---
Honestly can't believe this ain't hotfixed. If it was standard it 100% would have been by now for competitive integrity on the weekends.
---
Its only wild though. No fix in wild requires immediate attention apparently.
---
I should get the set right. My point is still clear that they have no good reasons to add cards like that into the game at it's current state. Totemic Might was printed when the game was released, there's no reason to do anything with it. My issue I have is blizzard feels fine replacing decent cards like mind blast with cards like radiance.
---
But that's the point. Brawl is supposed to be whacky and fun, not just ladder with a new coat of paint.
---
Errr this is weird but your opponent seems to be rank 2, and at least not Legend, (also why would OP clumsily hide his opponent's rank), meaning that this is from an early day of the season, so what is this post doing here on the 26th? 
---
Given that the player's name is also hidden it really feels like OP is posting someone's else achievement.
---
nope
---
Would you be ok if they take cards from other classes and replace them with simple, boring cards like radiance? Sounds like you're defending them for putting 0 creative effort into the basic set.
---
No the game has already determined which cards you got
---
Yup. I don't even bother. If I have to play a deck I'm constructing, I'll play ladder or casual.
---
Yes you can get the new cards from packs saved from now on.
---
I have been saving classic packs for a little while now as I have a complete classic collection.
---
All the variants have a core base, whitch you can use as a base for your deck... You can change some non core cards because sometimes you dont have the cards or the dust to make the exact same deck.
---
Honestly, yeah. PoG is decent, but is also basic set access to card draw, which blizz has said they want to limit for priest. I honestly might make it a little stronger, probably heal 6, but a simple basic heal is fine for priests basic set.
---
Remember, what blizz is trying to do is lower the power of the evergreen sets while making sure they better align with core class identities. Radiance does this pretty well.
---
I was looking for this comment.  And I agree.  Do you smell that?  This doesn‚Äôt smell right.
---
I'm currently climbing ladder with a lady deck.  Seems to surprise a lot of folks.

7/6/6 Dragon | Battlecry: Your opponent takes two turns. Then you take two turns.  
---
Nope. You can never fall below 20 if you reached 15 once.
---
So is ladder.
---
Came here to say the same, and glad I wasn't the only one who felt that way.
---
But this is arena, you just play on curve. Of course you build your deck around those two card. The goal of your deck is to have lions stick on the board, and with mechs being so prevalent it's pretty easy to do (shout-out to the 3/2 weapon that give +2/+2 to a mech)
---
*2/30 not 4 btw
---
My answer to the first question is: very good, as long as you have a good early curve and focus on swarming.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure Apxvoid was hanging onto 1 the last day or so
---
Thanks! I'd definitely love to see the list expanded on, or even maintained somewhere as a living document that could be referred back to as time goes on and philosophies evolve.
---
I very much like your suggestions, too. While I was considering my "oddities", I found a lot of instances where I wanted to indicate a class had better than average access to something without having to go all-in on calling it a Strength. I ended up marking most of those as "S/L?" but Limitation seems to pretty clearly mean "less than average".
---
And all of the tribal callouts felt a little strange for sure. And why list Totems, Murlocs, Elementals, Beasts, and Demons but not Dragons or Mechs?
---
You see, the minions are no longer big.
---
agree
---
&gt;Try to get most of the commons and rares from all the standard expansions. Otherwise you will loose a lot of dust crafting something you would probably get from packs.
---
The evergreen set should be limited and simple. Leave crazy stuff for expansions. Make it new and fresh and evolving. Leave evergreen simple and easy
---
Seriously. I can spend $$$ on packs no problem, but making friends? You ask too much, Blizzard.
---
Is Forrest aid even good here? All my matches have ended on the second or third double turn.
---
I'm ok with having it heal 6.
---
But you sleep well tonight

---
r/quityourbullshit OP.
---
A golden Leeroy. Now that nutty.
---
Why do I need to play a fast deck though? Why does blizzard allow for a deck that always wins in the long run?
---
Do you need 2 copies of every card, or just one?
---
What control warlock are you playing? havent seen a non-mechathun list in a while
---
I wish for this to become the next copypasta template
---
Because that's the entire deck archetype? Control warrior isn't anything new dude this is just the newest variation. It's nowhere near as oppressive as armor up control Warrior has been in the past. This meta is actually really balanced when compared to the past five years of Heartstone imo
---
I feel ignored :P
---
I think Shaman has a lot of card generation but it wasn't the case for a long time. I think Shaman's actual weakness redundancy. They are jack of all-trades but master of few.
---
How did DK Rexxar evolve from being a weak DK to the most powerful hero card? I only know him as being strong.
---
Rade#11701 NA Trading 80g quest. I'll show, but you go first.
---
Or just not print a 12 Mana 7/8 taunt so "just smorc them down" works more consistently
---
Warlocks are non-conformists.
---
That's where Neutral cards come to play.
---
That is not at all what that means. It means the basic tools that a class has must come within those limitations. Hunter's weakness is draw, does that mean master's call can't be printed? Mage's aren't supposed to flood the board, so conjurers calling can't exist. Not at all - these cards give the class tools they otherwise lack, in ways that synergize with their stated strengths. Hunter can draw, but only in a beast only deck. Mage has access to game changing powerful spells that allow them to flood the board. 
---
How are these cards different from just not having this whole class identity thing? Simple - they are limited and temporary. Hunter doesn't always have card draw, but it does for a bit in a beast focused deck. Mage can't always flood the board, but it can for a bit by relying on the power of conjurers calling and kadgar. 
---
Also note that neither of these strategies give these classes access to the things that the other is good at *in classic*. Mage has amazing card draw in classic through AI, and hunter has great board flood through hounds/timberwolf shenanigans. Mage should always have an efficient, but not overpowered, way to draw and hunter should always have a way to go wide, that may or may not be consistent/powerful given the other tools available.

Players alternate being 1 turn ahead, I don't really see how going 2nd is an autowin.
---
I'm not saying this will up-end the meta, but it being 5 mana does mean it interacts with cards like Sunreaver Warmage and Arcane Dynamo.

---
I thought it was really fun to watch during year of the Mammoth and most of Raven. Ever since Boomsday, though, it's just been an extremely dull meta to watch (and play, honestly).
---
Part of that may also be that I started playing in Mammoth, so I was learning quite a bit by watching others play. These days it doesn't feel like that's happening as much.
---
I will soon
---
Oh ok makes sense. Thanks for your reply.
---
I'm sorry what lmao, you clearly didn't read my whole post if you think I'm jealous you can netdeck dude, but since you clearly need it here's a tl; dr
---
Feel free to be proud of your accomplishments, congrats on legend, I know how much of a grind it can be and it's an accomplishment no matter what deck,  just don't try and act like you have a revolutionary new deck when you use the same list everyone else does
---
I figured as much. Thanks for the reply.
---
It affects the Daleran Heist as well. If you go up against the one that shuffles your leftmost card into your deck you can end up drawing a blank card
---
All sweet. I used to consistently get to rank 3-2 but never hit legend. So i can understand the hype when you get a deck going that just clicks. Not gonna ruin that lol.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know why demon tags even exist.  You can‚Äôt do crap with them.
---
I m not like I have a revolutuonary deck I am just over hyping the sht out of it with sarcasm. I know, trying understanding the meaning of written sentences is tuff tho. Gl

If they're going to replace the classic/basic cards they HoF with pure unadulterated shit like they are clearly, intentionally doing, then yeah they may as well just get rid of it. They're too lazy to design around a core set, they legitimately just want the evergreen cards to be unplayable. Nothing illustrates that better than the cards we're getting in the upcoming patch.
---
and its a snowball effect too, if i play my fun deck and just keep losing against net decks eventually i will switch to a net deck just to get my pack and move on. tbh at this point for 99% of constructed brawls i check the sub reddit, copy a recommended deck, get my win and move on
---
Hafu averaged 6 wins per run in vanilla arena. Was Chakki that good? I never even heard of them.
---
Not a crap reason. Entertainers have different energy, quirks, styles, etc... If there's something you find offputting, that's a legitimate reason to stop watching them.
---
Correct, second player gets the first double turn.
---
I can be your friend... if I had an account
---
And then they fucking puke it out all over you
---
Chakki was respected but not as popular as he should have been. Still goes both ways and both suck. Knowing you're good and not getting recognition sucks, but so does getting recognized as a great player but no one cares enough and rather watch the funny guys.
---
may you have a sunny day my good sir.
---
fair enough, i was just curious since i actually did the opposite of you and chose to invest in wild, but i play it all the time to de-stress from standard so we get different value from it

Making an account is the easy part. Having anything more than the basic cards is the tough part.

Genuine question, what keeps you so interested in the game after playing for so long? I started playing HS back in GvG and at this point i can only play a few games in one sitting before i need to do something else. I miss being excited to play the game :/
---
I'd assume you would play Kragwa the turn after clearing the board.
---
I think Amaz made a new bet/game style of Arena where the goal was to win 100 games in 10 consecutive arena runs. This was a lot harder than averaging 7+ wins because one bad run would probably end you. I don't remember if anyone won or who did the best, but my guess is this helped Hafu gain more respect because things like the Arena leaderboard were only based on your top 100 runs or something, which made the averages inflated and favored those who had more time overall.
---
I used a Shufflock that had a SN1P-SN4P/Summoning Portal/Coppertail Imposter combo as an emergency switch
---
Windfury Shaman.
---
He'd be really strong with all the imp flooding spells as well though. Plus you'd have to remove him instead of going face which gives you another turn in survive in many cases.
---
Low key one of the best HS streamers. Such an entertaining stream
---
They aren't trying to do the class a favor. They're trying to keep the game fresh^(tm) while also never printing another card that anyone wants to play. 
---
They probably looked at their big pile of farmed data and determined that frustrating^(tm) effects like instant damage (burn that goes face, charge, mind blast) and stalls (vanish, ice block, etc) cause new players to quit the game before spending money. 
---
They certainly have not printed anything meant to engage experienced players since roughly K&amp;C so one must presume that they're trying very hard not to alienate players who only understand trump trading.
---
I pray for what is about to happen to your karma
---
I *want* to like him, but he‚Äôs so boneheaded. His streams are .1% clips like this, and 99.9% losing with the same shitty deck for four hours in a row at rank 10 while complaining about netdecks.
---
For a game based off WoW, Hearthstone has sure decided to drift away from the fun callbacks.
---
It was also good with the draw shrine and gonk.
---
Does blizzard just hate the idea of control style rogues ever? Why‚Äôd they rotate it I‚Äôm so confused.
---
r/flamewanker more like

Having a blast with handbuff charge paladin.  Time Out! is totally broken - you can stall for those crucial 5/6, 6/7, 7/8 turns.  Once you have 15 charge damage in hand it's over unless they have a taunt (and I haven't seen one yet).  Would be even better with Leeroy obviously but I don't have him.

the issue with Neptulon is there's literally a rare card that does his job but better. Hell, the quest does his job better.
---
I‚Äôd play that tbh

Manup#2508 NA trading 80 gold quest
---
I always thought Rhonin was Classic
---
Right now? Zoo...when there's not a bunch of warriors out. Japetto shaman is fun too...
---
Because Twitch is an entertainment platform. Being bad and entertaining will get more views than being good and not entertaining.
---
Even the people who watch with the intention of improving will pick the 100th best player who explains their decisions well over the 10th best player who doesn't.

He knew what he was getting himself into.

Y'know, all these posts reminds me of Mark Rosewaters old GDC talk: https://youtu.be/QHHg99hwQGY

Players are great at identifying a problem, but not that great at fixing it.

Yeah, arena should be free. It sucks and makes no sense that I have to either grind for a week for 150 gold or spend $1.99 just to play 1 round of arena that you make might just get destroyed on your first round and waste that hard earned 150 gold. Arena was SOO fun when I unlocked it and now I can never play it again cause it‚Äôs to expensive. Plus Tavern Brawl is only out for 3 days and gotta wait 4 days for it to come back, plus it might be something you don‚Äôt like. Then all you have is ranked/casual and solo adventure left to do. They need to understand with Arena how many players would just love to play the super fun Arena for free like every day as like a weekly challenge to see who gets the most win streak and your rewarded on your # of your most wins you got.

"we want to be careful with their power level so that Hearthstone can continue to feel fresh with each new year." is what they said, to put it simply, expansions fresh=new/old players pay money for em, classic buy and keep like a souvenir
---
Meh, at this point it would be much more beneficial to watch Old Guardians educational Hearthstone videos.
---
How does he not fit? Charge minions can also "rush" enemy minions... Or go face... Ya, always go face
---
Hit them in the face until they have no life and you win the game.
---
'Your buffed minions have +1 attack.'
---
Done and done!
