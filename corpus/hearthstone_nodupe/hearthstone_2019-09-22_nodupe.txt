Dalaran heist definitely does.  I ended up in a lock against the "only take three damage" guy since he'd stolen two of my three elder tagawags.  So each turn had us play a tagawag, clearing the other sides and shuffling them in.  No one would win, but it was a pretty good run and he was boss 7 so I decided to go for turn limit.
---

---
It took a while, but we did draw and I then fought him again and won.

RDU do answer questions but not generic ones. Go to smaller streamers for those and if you managed to find a streamer with a track record of high legend finishes or placings, you should ask them questions when you can.
---
Highlander Hunter, Murloc Shaman, Control and Aggro Warrior are tier 1-2 decks favoured versus Combo Priest
---
Good post. Short and sweet, since I joined discord 
---
I have defo learned a lot.
---
or just be good lmao
---
btw legend in this meta doesn't mean much in terms of skill but gz i guess
---
Yeah I completely agree. RDU and the other big streamers do the best they can and explain their plays, Ive just found a lot of success with smaller streamers because they can dive into it more without having to keep up with chat.

I mean, you can get it to work (with luck and if RNGsus decides to give you the secret card picks...), but usually in order to get it online you need to stall quite a bit; it doesn't come early enough in a match to actually help you win.
---
Just trying to give back to the community that helped me out my dude!
---
well the thing is animation time shouldn't be the way you nerf a card that's busted or remove otk potential, that's not how hearthstone has ever operated
---
It’s so much fun haha
---
sorry when i reread it, it sounds pretty disrespectful but i didn't mean it that way
---
No no I get it! Trust me I know I have a ton left to learn, and expect the ladder to get more competitive with the changes to GM, but figured I’d try and help out someone else who might be stuck. 
---
I didn’t think it was rude you’re good!

---
what i don't like about the snip snap bans is that you're essentially using time per turn to nerf a card which isn't fair
---
no card has ever been nerfed solely by animation time to limit otk combos and time has never been a factor to balancing cards or even part of the game (only exception is nozdormu)

Nah he always had minions on the board, well like 98% of the time, so I was always able to attack something. I don't think I used Jaina on it once.
---
Literally never lost to her, are you getting her late in the run or something?
---
Class identity pals /s
---
I dont think it would gain more damage with maly, but you can abuse it with clockwork automaton
---
The theory is that the game checks for the next phase every time the boss takes damage which resets the animation.
---
Yes, it's called Pusab.
---
Explanation: I had 3-4 snip snaps in my deck, and with VIP membership passive treasure and Bob I reduced their cost 3 times (2 natural tavern visits and then one by using the Hearthstone treasure on the final boss, hence the less than 300 health). After stacking 100 snip snaps it autoattacks due to the second wing twist, giving a turn 1 lethal on a "full health" plague
---
Reno-card: "We gonna be rich!"
---
Reno-hero: "And save the world!"
---
Looks the best to me
---
No way Odd Rogue is the best wild deck. Sn1plock and Secret Mage are far better. Even Shaman and Mech Paladin not far behind.
---
Seems like it would be just like TFT: way too luck based.
---
The times are upon us when you want to squelch... yourself rather than your opponent.
---
I'm also talking relative to the first two wings of Heist. As I said...
---
&gt;Then again, its the first two wings, so I may be wrong. It just feels that you have far more potential to get absurd decks, the card buckets impact your game far less than the treasures relative to previous adventures, and there's some wonky interactions that just aren't fun.
---
Yeah that’s a good suggestion there’s a TON of cards I’m missing so my options for wild would be limited. Arena’s next!
---
Yeah, he is great.  
---
Sounds a lot like the Tick.

can a mod pin this every week? more than being easier to find this comment, it'd look very neat.

You can play the shitty version.. the 5 mana 5/2 base card (I think) with charge for a similar effect.

---
It's just a troll, think about comments like this as if a person saw a sign on a store saying "lessons on how to make your bread better" and just walks in to say "people who have time to make their own bread have too much time on their hands!" it serves no purpose besides getting people a bit upset, just ignore it, if you answer they win a puppy dies, GabeN postpose HL3 1 more year and Blizzard takes away 1 deck slot.
---
I disagree with that. In most games 1 extra damage to face is marginal and you would get more utility from the divine shield.
---
Nah every priest deck is cancer. Inner fire is a shit arch type as is mind blast as is big priest. What priest deck isnt cancer if strong?

I wish I could upvote this 10 times.
---
Leeroy is played to close out the game with more aggressive decks. Yeah, it can be used in a meme deck, but it's absolutely a great card used majority of the time as a serious inclusion in meta decks. For instance, aggro warrior, which can burst for 16 damage by duplicating Leeroy + Inner Rage.

If they just made echo mechanic limited per turn, say 10 max...PROBLEM SOLVED

Maybe I'm not the best judge of meta since I've only been playing the game for a little over a year, but I certainly think this meta is more competitive than previous metas. I'm sure you don't need that validation, but I wanted to say it anyway. This meta is in my opinion more diverse and interesting than the past year when you still had infinite value death nights and the incredibly stagnant even/odd decks. Even with the introduction of the quests, I still think it takes more skill to succeed currently than it did at the beginning of this year
---
Strange, when I joined HS it seemed like druids were the strong class to meme on. Something about infinite armour.
---
I play my one 7 mana card and summon malygos and profet velen from my deck. Mind blast mindblast gg.
---
wait how did you fatigue the boss, i thought you couldnt do that
---
If you’re playing decks that don’t reliably draw a playable card until turn 5 then no wonder you’re losing to RNG.
---
Not even that anymore, for rogue now its just "gets cards" because it isn't even reliant on their class now.
---
It literally did exatly literally what it sais, what is the point?
---
What a great rebuttal.
---
Believe it or not, I'm not making any of this up.

The terms floor and ceiling have been used in the exact way I'm using them for years (perhaps even around the inception of the collectible card game) [even outside of card gaming](https://esportsedition.com/general/skill-ceiling-skill-floor-esports-terminology/).

TIL the priest symbol is not a bible, but the end of a cleric's staff.
---
I'm speaking as in with rng I dont draw anything. I just played a game with highlander hunter which is a tier 1 deck. I drew not one playable minion until turn 5. Which was zillax. If course I drew spells. Which was snake trap but I had no minions for him to attack to activate it. And freezing trap which I didn't want to play yet since it was a quest shammy and didn't want to give him no more card gen.
---
god damn the level of stupidity in that comment. poor fool
---
Still takes two turns tho.
---
Not just maybe. Alex doesn't work in all singleplayer content because it's easy to combo it and kill them.
---
Priest has been using the same combo for five years now. So glad they hall of famed mind blast instead, or gave them other tools.

Wild is so easy to go rank 10. I think that rank 15 in standard skill is about rank 10

It'd be good if that thing said what the upgrades did or what the tokens looked like. Also there's already been a gorilla bot.

You literally do not need to be active on any internet forum to netdeck, you only need google

Thanks for your insightful reply proving me I am wrong.
---
It’s definitely rare and the package is kinda sucks too but I think Mystical Mirage(refresh mana and get a new hand) helps a lot in Jr. Tomb Diver run. I won Heroic Murloc because of activated Tomb Diver.
---
That’s only really true in super high legend, where the matchmaking is narrowed by a lot, and skill is roughly comparable.
---
Variance can make it a bitch, but, holy crap, there are some very bad players, even in legend, and there is a night and day difference for me on WR when I’m well-rested etc vs not.

Agreed, already lost 2 of my wild decks because of this and I don’t remember what cards where in the decks

I agree 100% that's why I dont like playing it anymore , such a hit or miss
---
Depends on how viable you need it to be. I’m sure there’s something you could come up with that is good enough to get to Rank 5. Legend might be tough, though.
---
It’s an issue. One miss-click and the deck is gone.
---
She's 9 Mana so maybe you can convince her to come out if Zephrys is 1 mana? Also, a 9 Mana 8/8 that doesn't impact the board is terrible value so maybe you need to have 15 damage present for lethal to increase the odds. Your health also needs to be high so that it doesn't think you need healing, and your board can't be wide or it'll offer board buffs, and opponent can't have board or it'll want to give you aoe.

Indeed. In the dungeon run copies, alextrasza isn't in any buckets, but can be discovered and recruited in a tavern.

“Have fun with all that mayhem and chaos you’re causing!”
---
That's because they've virtually always gotten something completely degenerate like Raza Anduin or Rez archetypes or inner fire wombo combo decks. And that's exactly why I dislike the priest as a thief archetype, because it’s a cop out. Blizzard can’t come up with decent decks that don’t suck one way or the other so they just say “fuck it, we’ll have two rogues and people will love it.”

You know hearthstone would be more interesting if took a tip from WoW we get 3 sets a year and when I played WoW there was 3 talent trees for each class. So it might be more interesting if each set was themed towards a particular talent tree line and maybe have 2 cards that support a different tree. Because for priest it just seems to be heavily focussed on the holy side shadow rarely appears and when it does it's just for 1 or 2 removal cards for the year.
---
Warlock is similar with a heavy use of demons big thing of warlocks were the DoT spells and we don't really see much of that maybe a short debuff but only DoT was curse of Rafaam the bomb mechanic would be nice if had something similar.

I Understand where most people come from, and I respect your Opinion. Losing Sucks for a lot of people

Maybe I'm just Old? I Stopped Caring about Losing (and esp. Losing Streaks) in multi-player games a long time ago.
---
If the end result of a human VS human game has a "losing" side by necessity, I just started to accept that "Losing" Happens all the time, (and as World of Tanks taught me, "Losing Streaks" Happen all the time too, even with Average WR. Those drive people up the wall and make them salty &amp; Toxic in that game).

Accepting that losing is both an inevitability and Common made losing more often a lot easier to swallow for me

Yea I stopped playing it, I've been trying quest pally and I've had better luck with it.  But yea just feel unlucky more then lucky 70% of the time

True that, but as farvas i know, flooping is not a generalized term for copying...
---
I'm curious what you mean by "the practical application of the cards". On paper at least, looking at the percentage of cards in a set used in the meta seems like a good idea. I was wondering if you could clarify for me why this is not necessarily a good gauge to use?
---
yeah, it'd make sense in a drop-down menu, but with the way the menu looks now it'd be an unnecessary click. I could see a similar mechanism where you'd have like 90 slots over 10 pages sorted by class, and the collection tabs at the top to instantly turn to the first page that class appears in.
---
It's simple. while alexstrasa can be generated through discover/random gen in cobolds and catacombs and co,they decided to remove her because she would be even more effective against the plague Lord then against other bosses. you can't evolve into her,you can't add her to your hand usw.

It's too polarized. Games feel the same just like with Genn and Baku.

I'd balance it by removing the passive ability. It would cost 1 or 2; just like Shaman quest reward if you want the value you gotta push the button.

I would say that in general we're not downvoting you because of the "suggestion" (hell, I think most of r/hearthstone would kill for more features. You're being downvoted because you phrased your "question" in the form of "Blizzard is lazy and terrible for not adding a feature I think is important. I mean seriously, just listen to me and your whole game is better. How dare these idiots not do what I say."

Also, much like "Wizbang for classic set" and "animation speeds dur" this is something someone posts about every week or so. The bar for putting up with entitled sounding comments is a lot lower when its the same entitled comment every few days.

I have a theory about Bob. It isn't fleshed out enough to make a post but in short the theory is Bob is a dragon and the main protagonist of hearthstone's year of the dragon. He's a dragon hiding in human form and he's going to be the big reveal for next expo.   
---
Bob has casually been playing both sides - First helping evil and now helping the league. Bob is ridiculously powerful, he provides the strongest modifiers and owns strongest decks in the game. He is suspiciously friendly, no one is that friendly. He's hiding something! He's hiding that he is a DRAGON! Not worked out what he's planning yet though...
---
Is that the one that replaces your deck with treasures?
---
He is now. You can't change my mind
---
This guy warriors
---
hs deck tracker is already doing that.
---
dont expect as a native future anytime soon
---
That’s a great catch! But I have to say that as much as everyone seems to love Bartender/Bazaar Bob, his writing is pretty immersion-breaking for me.
---
Hey WesleyT245, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".

Yeah IF you get caught. What are the odds?

Soul of murlocs. No but seriously I would probably cast Yogg Sarons puzzle box for maximum value!
---
I'm glad he survived the ~~war~~ arena

You're right that Secret Mage is the deck to beat right now, but Taunt Warrior is the best deck that Warrior has. Even as the best deck for that class, it's low tier 3 at best. All it does is play the Un'goro quest and a bunch of minions with taunt to try to outvalue the opponent in the midgame.
---
Well, ANY card I can think of should be in the Zephrys pool, unless there is a strictly better card in the basic/classic pool.
---
If I am looking for 3 face damage and have 5 mana and the opponent has a mage secret up (in Standard), I should always be getting Nightblade. I highly doubt that card is in the pool.

Blizzard and other corpos love to use [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) these days.
---
Yep
---
Great until they decide to ban you for it.
---
It's extremely strong. Even if it steals a Wisp, it gets more stats than for a 3-cost minion. Stealing the strongest minion is unbearable. It maybe gets 9 mana value, maybe more for only 3 mana.
---
It limits not only the board space, but also the design space. *On a 7-slot board, you better not play more than 3 minions.*
---
MC Tech is just a bad tech design like Kezan Mystic and Skulking Geist. And double battlecry makes it worse.

Zephrys likes your gambling spirit. He gives you [[Togwaggle's Dice]] as a souvenir.

You usually don't hit Elysiana though, to be fair.  In the cases where you want to hit Elysiana, yes obv it's better to do 10 or so fatigue damage to the Warrior.  10 Fatigue is like a second King Krush.

I had this anomaly "you start run with 100hp but don't heal between battles" and I've been choosing only healing cards for Finley, but I also got nozari. At plaque Lord I managed to bring him down to 60 hp but I had 10hp, nozari and 4 6/6 minions waiting to hit me in the face, but I was too scared of healing him to 300 hp so I conceded.
---
Edit: I mentioned wrong dragon
---
If you’re going after gold with only an hr to play per day, you should get a cheap hunter deck to win in casual. You can prob expect to win abt 4-6 games maybe? So that’s 10-20 extra gold on top of 50 guaranteed per day.

Yes

Hearthstone is all about RNG, unless it is that one time RNG can help you. Them in that case we make sure to hard code it to make sure RNG is not on your side.
---
I mean, yes, it would make the plague lords obsolete , then again , those bosses are annoying enough ( not hard, just annoying ) to deal with the normal way.
---
Maybe dont let alex be an option in the tavern, but at least let us have a chance to generate her in game either by Zephrys or dragon generating cards.
---
How?
---
Ooh, this is cathartic, right here. I can almost hear the faint “wow”
---
Is that a black WoW character?

Surely stealing your identity would be taking your actuals cards like Priest though? Your version is much worse.

My quest pally does ok va aggro warrior. Tbh every single matchup in the game feels winnable. Priest though... Combo priest is an insta lose.

A person who steals your identity doesn't become you. Just pretends to be. I didn't say mine was perfect, just that if I were to phrase it I'd try something like that.

I have 2 questions:

1. Are these offered on Heroic only or Reg mode as well?
---
2. Is it only offered on the first reward screen?

Then you run into Plague Lord of Madness who has 2 copies of Plague of Madness on each phaze - 6 chances to kill your weapon.
---
Huh?
---
If they nerf mech warper, they should also nerf all cards that cheats mana to 0 cannot cost less than 1 as for the giants they cant cost less than 5. But this is dumb will gut otk mage no more infinite fireballs for sorc apprentice if this unicorn patch happens.
