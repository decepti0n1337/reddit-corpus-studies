Not defending him, just my best guess on it: Maybe he doesn't feel, maybe he doesn't *understand* that what he's talking to is *actually* a real person, that his words could actually hurt someone (although clearly not OP). Well, whether he can "justify" it or not, he's a dick.

Perfect, a pure paragon

You can ask any Jaina or Gul’dan 
---
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
---
I love kazakus and Zephyrs, but that's not the kind of card generation I'm talking about. Those are very specific, targeted generations, stuff you can reasonably guess at and play around. I think a certain amount of card generation is healthy.
---

---
It's when decks like control warrior can generate over 16 random cards a game, and mage and rogue can do the same, that card generation gets out of control.
---
P.S. I think brawl and Ragnaros are some of the best cards this game ever produced. You know what to expect and you can play around them. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't, that's the nature of a card game.
---
Question was about crafting dust but yeah this is helpful rank 25 is impossible to win in omg I demolished kids before this and now I can’t even win one xD
---
I wasn't aware it was mandatory to enjoy playing as every class to have fun in this game.
---
I'd like a refund on dusting my priest cards now,  please.
---
I like the theme, some mechanics and some cards.
---
However, the game got so expensive i barely can make any cool decks. Just look at highlander mage - you need a minimum of 7 legendaries to make it work and like 8-9 epics - for **one** deck.
---
What exactly is tournament mode supposed to be like in hearthstone in your opinion?
---
Hmm. Ressurect priest uses it quite well, I really can't complain about the winrate. I wouldn't want it breaking the meta anyway + as someone mentioned, it still takes quite a satisfying amount of skill to play it well + Priest was always supposed to be the quirky class. I have 99 problems with the current design of HS, but the Priest quest ain't one.
---
To be fair, you needed to be a deranged piece of shit to be playing Patron Warrior.
---
Isnt print screen faster than picking up your phone and opening camera?
---
Say sike
---
The dust requirements are becoming obscene and this need to be changed ASAP, the game is already dying, Uldum got the lowest viewership on Twitch.

---
Armor is fine if you keep up board control. Its problematic if your opponent gains armor and kills every minion you have on board.
---
Arena rewards gold, cards, packs, and dust. It's the best way to farm a lot of nary used cards to disenchant into dust, as well as dust itself. And of course, if you want plenty of it, you'll have to be a decent player.
---
Exactly, I put some money in at the start and could put more in if I felt like it, but the value you get for the money is so low I dont even bother, as you said you need probably a couple hundred every set to be able to experiment. It's a shame, most of the player base just has no other option FTP or not, after experiencing the punishment I got for brewing I'm never putting money in again.
---
Barnes isn't the (main) problem, it's the crazy res cards. Remove "friendly" from Eternal Servitude and Resurrect and it'll be a fairer deck.
---
Are you perhaps only playing once a week? I'm curious because just by completing the daily quests you can easily open 50 to 60 packs per expansion "for free".
---
Ok 👌 thx I’ve only ever played priest so idk how well I’ll do with other characters to get arena xD
---
Cheat it out your deck meaning you can cast it without having it in hand if you didn’t.
---
This game has always been fulfilled with contradictions
---
Do I need Kangors endless army for that? I have most everything else
---
Seconded. It's a good mechanic, but its supposed to be a survival/comeback mechanic, not a steamroll one. There's should be better ways in interacting with armor, since there is currently nothing except attacking it.
---
I can't see anything objectively rude in op's reply. They are entitled to disageee with you and didn't say anything inflamatory.
---
I would rather trade, cause I don't get how to build a deck that wants to use as aggro tool that isn't very good at making sticky boards.
---
I am coming from league of legend, you know the game with the so called worst and most toxic community ever, and when i started HS back in mean streets i discovered that this is just as or even more toxic of a community.
---
Definitly, even though aggro is pretty strong against the deck its just dumb that a control deck instantly has an almost impossible matchup. And with Catherina and Archmage Vargus from RoS its even worse
---
Sorry to hear that. I'm not even sure why I keep playing. I knowethe meta well enough. I might switch to arena and play it on and off from standard.
---
A classic
---
That's very true. People who don't play too often can also still use the decks they are familiar with.
---
Thats why I think the expensiveness of the new decks is a big Problem too. Its a beaten horse at this point, but a man can hope they change the dust system for the better.
---
It's interesting, I'm in a couple of communities of "priest players" and the numbers dwindled down extremely hard this last expac. but a lot of players came back with this release... the thing is not even a week has gone by and the community is dead again, it turns out that priest players are not into the "our identity is not dealing damage and not having card draw", for me Priest was The Control Masterclass that could get value from the opponent, but since our identity changed and Warrior does everything we could as a control class better it's no longer the case.
---
Congratulations :)
---
No response is also a response the community hates, making the argument a moot point.
---
If they say nothing, they are saying "we don't give a flying fuck about what the community wants, and go fuck yourselves"
---
I'm ashamed I preordered this time.  I like the set well enough, but every expansion I leave sooner and sooner.  And when I'm around, I just stick to wild.  At least there I can find some deck diversity, even if it means facing big priests and odd paladins
---
Like I said I’m f2p.  I end up with all the commons, around 80% of the Rares, and then whatever Legendaries and Epics I need for the decks I play or otherwise opened, and I always have a lot of dust sitting around.
---
If you just don’t repeatedly dust 1600 worth of stuff to make 400 worth of stuff, dust 400 worth of stuff to make 100 worth of stuff, etc. you’ll end up in a very good position.
---
That’s not to say the game is perfect for f2p as I can’t play every deck and I miss out on playing new decks in the early meta while I build up my cards from the newest expansion, but unless your plan is specifically to only play the game for a short period of time and max out those 3-6 months then quit, it does not pay in the long run to be dusting cards to make cards.
---
At 7 it was absolutely terrible.  I tried making it work so many ways and it just could never make the cut.  The buff made it playable but not op.  I happen to think it’s right where it needs to be currently.
---
Hahahahaha......the point is everything is relative. If you can’t afford to play then don’t.  What I said went way above your head much like the decks you wish you had.....out of reach man. Good luck on your life’s journey.
---
I made a token Druid quest where I had low cost minions (like acornbearer, mecharoo etc.) do that in the early turns I can still put out some cards whilst having unspent mana at the end of the turn. I finish the quest around 5-6 mana and then the cancer begins where I put down all the choose one cards. Don’t have Cenarius or Loti (I usually get them from the discover a choose 1 card). Everything is pretty much classic,rare or common (except Druid quest).
---
Me too, these decks just aren’t too exciting; at least the ones that have good winrates.
---
Good luck on your journey.
---
Yep exactly. Everythings too expensive, Meta gets stale, I fear the game is dying even though they do many things right, actually.
---
Yes
---
Because I dont like the decks that beat it and I dont want to have even less fun because of one single card.
---
So I rather stick to my tess rogue with scheme so I can at least win some matches by outvaluing the warrior with luck
---
I regret spending money on this game.
---
Don't worry, everything is on their radar and is coming soon^TM
---
Devs won't answer since their hands are tied and even if blizz employees have great vision for  any of their games they most likely get shut down if those ideas don't mean more money for the company.
---
For example tournament mode is good for players since everyone would have an easier access to enter competitions. This would cost money to implement but they either don't know how to do it or don't want to, I would say it's the latter since it doesn't make them immediate money even though they could charge money or gold as entry fee.
---
You actually forgot graveyard implementation.
---
I wouldn't play hearthstone were it not for card generation and single player. When I want a physical card game I play MTG.  
---
My problem with Hearthstone is the fragility of minions, weak flavour, and the existence of decks that are full of stat sticks. And Dr. Boom because of the REPEATABLE card generation that doesn't cost a card.
---
Yeah why the heck are we limited to so few deck slots??? There’s way more different decks than deck slots??
---
Try Mage and Shaman. They have fairly solid Basic and Classic sets.
---
I hear you. I follow the rule of never crafting unless I need it and let the pack opening push me. This has only kind of worked me. I'll never be able to play a control deck or a combo deck. I want to try maly druid but I can't test drive the deck. So right now I have midrange hunter, mech hunter, nomi priest, and a home made tempo rouge I took to legend last season called gifting rouge. Sometimes you get lucky.  but now I feel like playing arena the first time as expansion comes out. Just to invest.
---
Will do
---
&gt;People defending Acti$$ard to this extend
---
I'm not defending Blizzard or Activision or anyone. As I said to him, I just want people to get their fair dues. Blizzard/Activision deserves shit for making shitty, greedy decisions like $80 pre-orders being the only way to get heroes, still no "no-duplicate Epics" rule, and the entire shitshow that was WoW: Battle for Azeroth's launch which is still shit from what I've seen on occasion when I go back to the subreddit.
---
Look, I've been on the WoW subreddit. The Hearthstone subreddit. The Fallout 76 subreddit (Though that was more for the outrage than because I played it; I've never played the game). The Pokemon subreddit. Something all these places have in common from what I've seen over the past couple years (for the first two) and past year or so (for the latter two), is that they have a subset of defenders who will defend the company no matter what.
---
And a point I've made is that others will just let these defenders exist rather than criticizing them, addressing them directly, or downvoting them. In fact quite often the defenders get positive scores too, in spite of all the people talking shit about the game. And I don't get it.
---
If you want your voice to be heard, and if you genuinely see issues with the game, why would you ever tolerate people who are saying "Yeah don't fix those issues" or "Those issues don't exist"? Or how about those who say the company isn't greedy/lazy, or that in turn that YOU/those who are voicing their displeasure are entitled? 
---
You want better games from Blizzard, other people want mediocrity. But you and so many others are perfectly fine with giving those who want the latter, a voice. And you don't consider the possibility that you, yourself are entitled. So how does that work? If you're "objectively" right and the game should actually have more features then don't let people who are wrong propagate their statements. And if you're subjectively right, then yeah, there is 100% the possibility that maybe overall game standards have just gone downhill and demanding more at this point MAKES you entitled.
---
But that's not the case, right? So how do you reconcile with people who say "Yeah I'm happy paying for a mediocre product because I think it's acceptable :)"?
---
Yeah, definitely report him. Imagine if he said that and the person on the other end was an impressionable kid. Never take that talk lightly.
---
I think every class would be happy to get the Shaman quest.
---
Can’t say I have much sympathy for you, getting the best quest when you wanted the worst one.
---
The exact reason I’ve stopped playing the game altogether is the lack of new content. New expansions get boring after a while
---
Pretty much this. You'd almost always avoid dropping Astromancer for an 8-drop and would definetely not play conjurers on any 8-drop as well. Especially with Khadgar in play as well.
---
I’d also like to see a more noticeable difference between a minion ready to attack and a rush minion. The green border is very slightly different on a rush minion, but you have to know what you’re looking for.
---
Also don't use your Astromancer to get an 8-drop in the first place. Compared to the giants, the pool is not that great and actually dangerous as of the newest expansion.
---
POPENTIAL ! They will said 🙄 Just feel good stop spending money on HS for the last 3 expansion, it just doesn’t feel “right”
---
Oh interesting. I haven't played magic in a few years so I didnt know that card existed
---
Perhaps the Rogue one was a tutorial type deal if it was your first one?
---
I played a game against someone a few days ago. They added me on steam and flames the crap out of me then removed me and blocked me. I thought it was weird and I spent like 10 minutes trying to figure out who it was. Then I realized and I just went oh. They just don’t want to get banned on blizzard xD
---
You know what works best with ropers? Start to rope them. I have a really slow nightshift job so plenty of time to play hearthstone. You regularly run into people already starting to rope in the first 3 turns. And that's when I start as well. But don't just rope. Play your turn as you would and THEN just let them wait. Even answer their emotes if they do. It's hilarious how fast they stop to rope and spam emotes.
---
Hearthstone already has its core consumers, its not like the game is getting the same constant flow of new players anymore. So blizzard is just milking the people that are gonna play this game no matter what for all they have.
---
I can live with that.
---
How do you know they're bots?
---
I’ve never played Whizbang or Zayle but I don’t understand the hate for these types of unique attempts to give variety to new players (with small collections).  On day there will be a Magic Mirror Card that gives you exactly the same deck as your opponent (or the Innkeeper deck for your class if you both play it) and people will complain about that.  They will do a card that always starts at the bottom of your deck and when you draw it you heal to full health.  Eventually we’ll see a card that gives you a random deck for your class that was used recently used at the legend rank.  
---
You can please some of the people some of the time, but you can’t please all the people all the time.
---
My wishlist is a legendary quest slot that can be rerolled once a month where you get a gold pack or a legendary card for beating it.  Give it an epic level requirement like deal 1000 damage or play 1500 cards or summon 500 murlocs.  That would make me happy.
---
As those are two of the only three hero cards that i own: yes please bring on the duuuuust.  
---
Hagatha is fine in wild, funny how boom is less viable there.
---
Freeze/ CC Mage is probably better.
---
Since you don’t have to rely on Mana Cyclone/ Conjurer’s Apprenrice combo to eek out wins against Aggro decks, the deck is incredibly consistent.
---
You have more answers in regards to swarming your board than Control Warriors have removal and it’s super fun.
---
Who’d have thought that creating a 10-mana Yogg spell card without needing to cast 10 spells in order to use it would end up becoming incredibly overpowered? King Osiris is so good; after exhausting your opponent’s removal options, it’s often a guaranteed win if your opponent can’t deal with your added board state.
---
The new 4-mana 2/5 Reborn card along with Arcane Keysmith to Discover the new 3 damage AoR secret is a god send for early board clears until you can get Blizzard or the new Tortollan minion. It also helps you build board early on and I personally believe is a bigger pain
---
In the ass to remove than any Giant ever was.
---
I suspect Mage is going t o catch up to Warrior as all these new tools and spells have any so significantly lessened the learning curve. People just haven’t caught on to it yet.
---
Actually, I’ve thought about how these intersect before. Card generation may be too powerful, but it’s a good option for new players or people missing legendaries.
---
You touched on it with "More deck sluts and rearrangeable decks", but one of the big quality of life improvements I waited for when I picked up the game, and kept hoping for even as I drifted away from it (now I don't play anymore) is just an overhaul of the Collection Manager.
---
Seriously, can we have a decent, comprehensive, non-clunky way to search for cards, with a list of keywords actually **written somewhere within the game** we can use to search - like health:5+ (perhaps, oh in some distant future, even an "advanced search")? Can we have tokens, summoned minions, and generated uncollectible cards like Dream Cards and Death Knight cards **written somewhere within the game**? Can the usable shortcuts ***at least be written somewhere within the game*** (like for instance, right-clicking a card in a deck to jump to it in the manager)?
---
And yeah, more deck slots, and a better way to make decks, and just, in general, ways to browse the manager without feeling like we're trying to sift through cement to get to specific cards.
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification.
---
Aggro decks, near instantaneous mouse movement, suboptimal trades; things that you notice from playing against bot AIs throughout the years
---
N u m b e r   1 5
---
Nope it's not. The best Mage Deck in the game doesn't even have much card generation. Freeze Mage is insane right now and way way more cancer than Warrior. I'll take this brief moment to talk about how much I fucking hate Mage. The only two archetypes that Mage ever has success with involves almost never interacting with your opponents board and then killing them. Burn Mage is just throw spells at the enemies face and hope you can kill them in time. Freeze Mage especially the current variation is no better stall, stall, stall, play Alex, get lethal. You designed a real good class there Blizzard good job!
---
Oh yes I sound precious because I enjoy playing the game. 
---
When all your fighting in CASUAL is net decked T1 decks it’s pretty pathetic. 
---
Can’t play my jank decks when warrior just keeps the board cleared and mage just outright wins trough bullshit
---
I wouldn't really bet on it, it's a 6 year old game. At this point they're probably just gonna have a skeleton crew rehashing shit over and over until people slowly phase out.
---
Always mage. Always.
---
Ya but all those profits are picking up the slack from the other games that are floundering
---
the Zayle decks aren't even that bad honestly, the only thing disappointing to me about the card is that it doesn't update the decklists. On some level I appreciate that tho, because it's a card symbolic of the expansion pack it came with, and a representation of the cards that came with it. 
---
With that said,  the control shaman ,tempo rogue, and bomb warrior decklists zayle offers are pretty damn good for what the card is. The control shaman tears up control warriors. 
---
I could reasonably see any intermediate hearthstone player climbing to rank 5 with the decks offered from Zayle, and I don't think that is unreasonable of a PvE card.
---
Yeah,  I'm torn between "this card should always provide the perfect answer" and "this card is already really strong,  does it need a buff?"
---
 I actually think the biggest improvement I would like is it not prioritizing a playable card for that turn so much.  If I drop it on turn 10 with 3 mana left I'm probably thinking next turn.
---
That's a very good edit. At this moment I don't happen to agree with you but I like the way you've made specific complaints and I hope you get some more eyes on this to keep a healthy discussion going.
---
It's day 5, and I already switch from any streamer playing warrior or mage, which includes most of them.  I refuse to watch that cancer.
---
Gotcha
---
Thanks for the positive criticism!
---
Even with discover Hearthstone is a dumbed down MTG as of now.
---
I still love hearthstone, but it's pretty far away From MTG in general.
---
I played bomb warrior during the last expansion because I had pretty much all the cards except Elysiana, a wrechcaliber, and a few stray rares. Every other deck required crafting multiple legendaries. 
---
Also, the cost of the deck is inflated somewhat because it requires 4 epics from the classic set which you probably have if you play every tavern brawl.
---
The game offers nothing to do, if you are a veteran player. Playing new decks/cards is like fun for a very short amount of time and you have to pay insane amounts of money to even try out new cards. 
---
They didn't even dare to change the stupid ranked system with monthly resets and the super volatile mmr in legend.
---
I preordered and crafted 2 legs and a couple epics and have almost no dust left. I play so often that I dont need to spend anything else and I usually get most cards I want to make the majority of the decks I want but the 15k dust is a ridiculous lie. You're spending the same as me with that much more dust sounds farfetched
---
Gotta drop a /s or something man.
---
I don't complain anymore, I just don't play the game. Still fun to watch and I miss it, but not enough to be financially stupid.
---
I really wouldn’t mind some deck sluts OP
---
No, you have less ability to run synergies that might be between 2x epic and 2x common.  Instead, you run generally versatile, high-quality cards.  That often means you're running more legendaries, because you don't need anything special to make use of Houndmaster Shaw or Siamat or Floop or whatever other strong, generic legendary.
---
I participate there pretty regularly. The people there generally don't give a shit about race as long as you love America.
---
And the few asshats that do get downvoted.
---
Fact! Dumb people keep giving them money so they keep up with their bullshit
---
I was so happy to open the quest lol. Cause I was probably gonna craft it... (though it’s still good...but I was playing control shaman anyway)
---
Same here. Left after Frozen Throne. Came back for single-player stuff on occasion. Then they started charging for that too, so I just burned what gold I had left on Dalaran Heist wings 2 and 3, and haven't come back since.
---
Now I just watch Trump Reviews and Trolden because the new cards are usually interesting... Just not enough for me to spend stupid amounts of money or time trying to get to those fun cards.
---
I do not. Would not mind crafting a copy or two if needed
---
All I want is an unerfed mode, and maybe I'll consider returning.  Just feels all sorts of bad when cards you've played with for years just don't work the same as they used to, and I would be OK dealing with all of the other OP non-sense.
---
I mean, there's a reason why there's a Legacy and Vintage deck classifications in Magic....
---
If only they let the playerbase decide the fate of Priest...
---
What's the difference?
---
I still don't know why we all use Zillax.
---
He has 2 health, and is usually only able to get off the initial hit from rush. For 5 mana.
---
I use him, but I have been unhappy with his utility. I could use a stronger rush minion, or add a burn spell and have similar results.
---
Yea man lackeylock has become one of my favorite decks.. I never played warlock but the new lackey cards have made the deck amazingly fun. You literally farm all quest decks lol have fun man
---
I have a really fun deck if you are looking for one I'm actually going up on ladder with it then again I'm only rank 16 but an improvement from 18
---
I honestly don't think it's a break
---
He pulls a lot more viewers with TFT and I think he enjoys it more too
---
He's probably going to stay there, unless Blizzard does something about the game's situation...
---
&gt;Or you could play a really greedy deck that had too much late game value to compete.  
---
  
---
I used to love how skill testing Elise Control Priest vs Elise Control Warrior was. Now Control Priest vs Control Warrior in any form has devolved to *plays threat* "SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST!" *plays threat* "SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST!" *plays threat* "SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST!" ad infinitum until you run out of threats and they kill you. It's depressing.
---
Ideally you'd give players a customizable mode with lobby-style matchmaking. Create all sorts of custom rules and restrictions much like in weekly Tavern Brawls but let players mix and match to create their custom rooms to play matches. Add to that a tournament-type room, where each player is given the opportunity to create a tournament once in a given timeframe and the winner and tournament creator get a reward at the end.
---
Maybe because wild is cheap. People has lost faith in new sets.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Yea please share it. I've been playing budget decks all last expac and decided no more. What class and archetype is it?
---
Doesn't matter if you removed the Sand Witch, once it's played all the spells that were in hand go to 5 for the rest of the game.
---
Just shared hope you like it :)
---
I saw that too. That means there's some person who works there, who has years old hearthstone photos on their work computer.
---
It's a shame...
---
They brought back nostalgic characters, especially ones that remind me of my early days playing, yet, they do it in a bad way
---
Elise, Brann, Finley, Reno and Rafaam are amazing characters, but they've been done badly(except Rafaam, this time around...)
---
Sigh.
---
[removed]
---
Was he made redundant and then had his job which was made redundant from advertised for?
---
I spent around 300 on the last 2 expansions and I also have a job that allows me to play Hearthstone while working. So I grind everything and then some, yet I still miss a ton of legendaries and epics in every expansion. So either it's just you that are supremely lucky or I call you bs.
---
You know what they do give us. $50 expansion set packs, 3 times a year, that allow us to scratch the surface of the set.
---
Rogue my fave.. I'll give it a run for sure. forgot I'm missing Myra's :( I was focusing on Tess and the burglar theme
---
Used to dump $200+ an expansion on this game. Then I wised up. Sadly this was after $2k investment. Haven't played in last two years because of the reasons stated by OP.
---
That’s not a bug
---
I really think you overestimate the strength that not purchasing things in HS would have over the decisions.
---
If a large enough collective group of people stopped buying expansion packs and such, then eventually Activision-Blizzard would notice the decrease and just shut the game down. They wouldn't care. They got their money.
---
Unique content? Really? More reski.ned dungeon runs lol. 
---
There maybe some blizzard hate boners popping off but there's ALWAYS white knights as well coming to defend blizzards every move as perfection and that we should be so lucky to have been blessed by their execution of gaming development.
---
The fact of the matter is that they wouldn't increase their profit gained by doing any of these things by enough to offset the cost of actually developing them. None of these things bring in new players and very few of them would bring back old players (besides MAYBE new game mode). At this point anyone that would play hearthstone probably is or has.
---
They should have this message pop up before every game against Control Warrior.
---
Pun intended? FACEing death
---
Then people complain about who draws the hero card first wins
---
This isn't a problem of Blizzard or Activision or video games.
---
This is just the end goal of any company under capitalism.
---
The set itself isn't very astounding. Hearthstone has simply lost its appeal. They put everyone on this cycle that simply isn't fun or appealing. The game is to damn expensive for 1.5 months of play.
---
Did you read them or just like, skim over the first paragraph of a few? Increased risk of cancer, metabolic disease and diabetes. You cherry picked out some parts about caffeine content being misrepresented, and that particular brand you enjoy being linked to liver disease. Some of those links also talk about addiction to artificial sweeteners. 
---
This is the issue with trying to provide evidence to one that's asks for it but isn't actually open to changing their mind. You got several people saying the same thing, and you got the links you asked for. At this point it's willful ignorance. Don't pretend otherwise. But you will. Smugly.
---
Old blizzard would give you those things.
---
I would like some cards that are epic or rare to be common or rare instead, and there are a lot of powerful legendaries. I think that you should be able to buy the entire set for X amount, and not *need* to open card packs. Or, you buy the special card packs that have no duplicates and every single card from the new expansion.
---
Like, if you want to take your chances and buy packs, that's fine, but there should be an "ultimate" option. It's just activision/blizz being greedy trying to cash in on the whale market. Imagine if every new expansion was $40. Hell, I know a LOT of people that would come back to HS if it was even $60 or $80 for the set guaranteed and they didn't have to buy packs and disenchant stuff.
---
You are forgetting one thing though: Hearthstone didn't have much competition for awhile. There were other digital card games, but nothing like MTG Arena, and the autochess genre which HS now also competes with since it's a strategy game instead of twitch games like Halo/League/Overwatch/DotA/etc. There are a lot more choices now for the audience that Hearthstone wants, and they're losing market share because of it.
---
Pally is better at cheating it out in my opinion
---
I don't understand, I'm completely f2p acc that i started a few months ago and with I have been able to make multiple fun deck including control warrior,murloc shaman, quest shaman, mech paladin. For the new expansion i only opened 15 packs and got the hunter quest and colossus of the moon.
---
Didn’t look like it
---
Voltron was never an option, by the way. Can’t get Tokens.
---
Would you rather keep playing Hearthstone with minimal updates
---
Or have Activision-Blizzard shut the entire game down? As far as I see it, those are the two main options we have. And I tend to enjoy spending even a little time in Hearthstone as a fun game to waste some time with at the very least.
---
If you want to quit because you don't get tournament mode, more power to you. But I can patiently wait for something that won't really impact me a whole lot.
---
Yeah, I'm not saying Blizzard's perfect. Spending $130 for half an expansion is fuckin atrocious. There needs to be a better pricing model. While we're at it, I'd like some better f2p models, too. 10 gold a win, and keep the 100g cap. That'd be much better.
---
However, I take issue with misrepresenting data to push an agenda. Which I think this post is doing far too boldly.
---
It’s less that card generation in a vacuum is bad - but rather than card generation should be narrowly focused and limited - hero powers that generate card value out of thin air are fundamentally broken. Likewise, if there is a high power level card that can be generated repeatedly, like devastator or shaman spells that generate board presence - it becomes difficult to overcome it without your own unlimited value generator.
---
Things like Druid’s choose one quest and paladin’s reborn quest have a significant entry fee and the value is limited by specific factors (limited card resources or minion size)... they’re still borderline broken because they effectively remove constraints on your cards and deck. We need to move away from infinite value and instead the devs should be finding unique ways to generate value in a limited fashion.
---
Seems cool if your playing with a friend
---
Didn't they add the built in deck tracker like a year ago? You can export/import decks in the collection manager.
---
&gt; I don't feel good taking something away from someone without knowing what will happen then
---
I've been in that situation before and I regret not reporting it/sticking up for myself. Everything until the last comment was *mean*, but you can just shake off as dumb people on the internet. That last comment is a threat and if people want to enjoy things, *they shouldn't make threats about killing people*.
---
Report that mf. They should have their account suspended, at best.
---
Lack of this stuff is why I stopped playing over a year ago. I don't consider myself a "whale" but generally I owned all common/uncommon/epic cards and at the time when I stopped I was missing about 20 legendaries total.
---
Unless this stuff actually starts happening I won't be back.
---
When they decided to no longer do adventures that was pretty huge, too. Advwntures were giving you *all* the cards in their set for around 20-25 bucks IIRC, or 2800-3500 gold. Even considering that those sets were smaller, I think they were over all better value then the card pack-expansions.
---
Bring back the “sorry” emote.
---
Yeet

It cant be green because green is the aura for when a minion can attack.

Thanks
---
Same. I am completely lost on the appeal of auto chess in general. Let alone someone can play it it every day for 8 hours and still love it. It just seems pretty fucking basic.
---
Druid quest will definitely be around.. not sure if it'll ever be tier 1. To have the full competitive version of the decklist youll need flobb flop, wardruid loti, and maybe even Elise.
---
shit didnt think thatd work
---
Conjurers calling is not a 1 card swing the rest of the game in your favor so I have to disagree with you.
---
Basically, It's expected a player to open around 150 packs once in three months.
---
If someone wants to play HS in standard mode, this needs to be considered.
---
Congrats my dude
---
Good lord
---
Lots of praise during Rise of Shadows' "honeymoon" was about old cards being rotated out of the pool rather than about new cards being added to the game. When players are more excited for losing cards than they are for the opportunity to get new ones, I don't think that sheds a positive light on the state of the game either.
---
That's a lotta dust. Nice!
---
I play the game to very high ranks every season and spend $0 on the game.  I only have at most 3 standard decks to use, and I sometimes have to dust nearly all of my cards to build one new deck when the meta shifts, but hey, I play the game for free.  You can stop giving them money and still play.
---
Captured Blizzard's response beautifully, no?
---
My theory (and this is less of a theory than a fact) is that Priests have a fairly simple, basically foolproof win condition that can be achieved using basic cards. This would be why they’re fairly common at low ranks.
---
I was a priest main and this was my #1 game for years until mid last year.  At that point I had switched from my main and favourite class to rogue because rogue then became the class doing all the things I liked about priest, but better.
---
For me, the game just took a turn that really ruined it for me with all these one turn game ending matches.  I liked playing cerebrally, responding in real time in matches where my decisions mattered.  Then over time it just felt that most matches were heavily decided before they begun once the decks were locked in.
---
I mean, I know there was always good and bad match ups, but they started to really feel worse and worse.
---
Think I still lurk this subreddit occasionally in hopes of seeing some big difference that would bring me back, but I haven’t even logged in, in probably a month.
---
To be honest, playing against patron warrior may be the only time video games cause violence.
---
Just Hall of Fame the card, rather than nerf it.
---
Rngzus &gt; babygzus
---
Holy fuck. Edit in some punctuation and I’ll try to make sense of that later.
---
crazy
---
Because when they were introduced, the most dominant decks included pre-nerf old Quest Rogue, Aggro Druid, Pirate Warrior, Murloc Paladin, Token Shaman and Midrange Hunter. The hero cards were control tools that needed to offer a little armour to ensure that you survived till the following turn. Even with the armour, imagine trying to play Frost Lich Jaina against any of these  decks. *If* you lived until turn 9 at all, that is.
---
Yep. I only stay subscribed to this subreddit to see if Hearthstone has improved at all and to bring others out of this toxic community.
---
Damn some of these F2P nerds on this thread seem a bit mad at the P2W players.
---
They should add auto-squelch in the options
---
Yeah. Back in the day, Blizzard was (essentially) just a bunch of dudes who wanted to make a game. Your average dude isn't going to try and bleed you dry. The average person is pretty decent.
---
A 6 cost card that gives you something okayish if you meet a specific parameter is iffy at best. Shieldmaiden is a realistically better card since it not only guarantees you get armor at all when you play it, but you also gain the armor up front without having to attack something for it. This sets up shield slams and reckless flurries better while preserving weapon swings for when you want them rather than being forced to swing suboptimally just to get 5 armor that will be lowered by hitting a minion (thereby ruining its synergy with shield slam and reckless flurry).
---
Cool our fifth dungeon run we need to pay for.
---
Thanks Activision, very cool!

As in there's no way to remove that immunity... it's an immune immunity in this game
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And I don't really get to pick my deck... welp
---
The best part are the two highlander decks with only half the cards. Lol
---
Same.. I'll actually let it play out and most of the time they will BM or do some unnecessary crap. So instead I'll emote "well played" then concede right after.
---
But c'mon most everyone does it, myself included. Especially when you have 10 dmg on board your opponent is at 15 and you do all this unnecessary trading, waste 4 face dmg spell on a minion, vendetta your own dude, then leeroy his face lol I'll admit I do that myself too. Especially if they're BM'ng early game or making super annoying trades all game.
---
Does no one remember they fired a bunch of Blizzard employees?
---
Some decks require specific expensive cards, but there are a lot of decks that you can make by using alternative cards. Its a lot of fun testing which cards in your collection work the best and honestly hearthstone is about having fun.
---
Seems as though Blizz now requires Android 5+, and most emulators run on Android4.
---
Its awful they gave away 5 packs for the new expansion. Whats honestly wrong with free login packs the week of release?
---
&gt;trophies you could display on your own board 
---
Nah, that's really different from how boards currently work. We should just have profiles like in every other Blizzard game; it would be something to look at while not in a match / on your opponent's turn.
---
Not exactly true. The Shaman one is very good in Jade Shudderwock Shaman.
---
I noticed blizzard milking this game some years ago, since then I decided to not spent any more money on this game.
---
Well you can experiment with the shaman one at least.
---
I have 15k gold and 40k dust i never have to spend money on this game again
---
Perhaps we will get a response on Monday, this being a weekend and all.
---
This needs to get so many upvotes it lands on reddit's main page.
---
Flare was the perfect card, doesn't matter if it assumed it was any other secret cause if that was the case Rag would have killed regardless.
---
Karma is a ... fine women
---
Thah way above avg. I hope you got the ones you want.
---
You got a link?
---
And like I said before cc on its own is not the problem everyone is complaining that mage makes two 7/8 taunts on turn 5 but for that he has to have 3 cards and had have passed allmost every one of them  + imagine cc on its own turn 5 and using it on a 2-3 mana minion to get two random 2-3 drops "so powerfull" there is a reason why mage had like 50-52% winrate last expansion because if they dont high roll they allmost allways straight up loos.
---
Okay, let me rephrase it.
---
"I'm already losing anyway, fuck it."
---
Wow...
---
I haven't done that encounter but wiki says she's immune when she has minions, doesn't it say that when you hover over her Hero Power?
---
They have 0 aoe have to use minion trades for everything. Basically if ur rogue or mages reborn means nothing
---
*Well met!*
---
*The problem* is that even if pre-purchase sales drop for like 75% they will still do absolutely nothing about it and just watch the game die slowly. Look at Twitch viewership rating for this expansion compared to the previous ones, there's even a post on the front page, and yet there's no sign of any change whatsoever.
---
I stopped when they said they would not make adventures anymore where you get the whole set, it just showed which direction they were going to with the game...
---
Yeah in game deck tracker with a match history and replay feature would be sweet
---
It is currently the highest win rate mage card when drawn lol
---
In my experience some people start to emote spam when they are in a really good position in the game. Mages hello is considered one of the most annoying ones I think.
---
You don’t need those legendarys to play the deck and can fairly replace them withe the FREE neutral ones.
---
*Tyrande Whisperwind would like to know your location*
---
While 70% winrate is great, it is not the winrate I want when I am hating something. I want Control Warriors going against me to have the same feeling as Freeze Mages of old had when Warrior pressed Armor Up on turn 2 and they knew that there is nothing they can do. I want to make them despair.  
---
I am not a good person =/
---
If Dr Boom gets nerfed then so should conjurers and magnetic (maybe something like if you magnetize something it can't hit face that turn to stop ridiculous burst)
---
Not a single sentence you said makes any sense.
---
The last control Warrior double brawled my 4 whelps and then the 7/7s.
---
Played a Mech Egg + Hero Power next and he conceded
---
Congratulations! You've earned every card in the basic set!
---
Reward: 40 dust
---
Bruh.
---
Based on the fact you bought 80€ worth of packs, chances are you should be able to make a really solid quest druid and zoo warlock deck. Not to mention you could have a lot of fun with anka as well.
---
I genuinly dont know why you are complaining after these pulls, I bet half the HS players would happily spend for what you have.
---
I agree with your statement, but your drops are too good to complain about and it is sort of a bad example.
---
&gt;It's the most shit deck in whizbang imo
---
Secret Paladin begs to differ
---
They should answer fast enough, and unfortunately that's the only safe way to get the account back. Hope everything will solve and be fine for you!
---
And the only complaints are about Conjurers Calling and Control Warrior, and we know why.
---
So satisfying.
---
Used to be like that with me for overwatch, you still enjoy the game but only if you don't run into certain characters
---
You can spend zero and build lots of budget decks.
---
if you "oops" me for every action I take, you better expect a "well played" from me on my lethal until the last milisecond of rope
---
Here is the code:  
---
AAECAa0GBPgC1grQ/gKppQMN5QT2B9UI0QrSCvIM9wz7DOX3Aq+lA9KlA9OlA4SoAwA=
---
I think CC is a lot easier to balance than Dr Boom.
---
As you mentioned, increasing the cost of the card to 4 or 5 would stop Mage from having insane swing turns too early. Removing the Twinspell status would also be something to consider (especially with the new Tortollan card and Magic Trick where you can Discover upwards to 4 more copies per game).
---
Dr Boom is much harder. The Warrior class is so dependent on that card that any significant nerf wild effectively shelf the class until next expansion.
---
There’s no easy answer... and that’s 100% Team5’s fault for having such short release cycles where constant tinkering of cards is not possible (and also they don’t want to alienate the majority of the player base who would loathe constant balance changes) and for creating cards with absurd power levels because of their “it’s fun if it’s powerful!” mentality implemented by Ben Brode that they have never dared question/ change even after his departure.
---
Sometimes, fun must take precedence before balance but Team5 isn’t interested in creating a balance, competitive game. HS is still primarily a phone game after all and will be developed within that context.
---
Are you talking about this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cojxij/its\_been\_6\_years\_despite\_record\_profits\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cojxij/its_been_6_years_despite_record_profits_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I don't think many people are discontent to the point of not playing Hearthstone - in fact quite the opposite I think. I think people WANT to play more, especially since the latest expansion brought some really cool and creative cards. Zephrys e.g. is so ingenious, and a card like this is just not possible in physical, tabletop card games like MTG. Hearthstone right about now looks like a very compelling card game to play.
---
So, with all the attention that Hearthstone gets, there will be a lot of people who want more improvements to the game. Tournament mode in particular has always been a big demand, since professional Hearthstone gameplay is quite fun to watch but there are a lot of convenience features that are missing from tournament spectating. Given that Hearthstone has been played competitively in big tournaments since what, 2014 (five years!) I'm honestly surprised these features are not in development, let alone be implemented.

---
I think this will be third of the top complaint posts
---
nah I'm with you, there's no point reaching legend once you get a card back
---
He could have died faster with a murloc deck.
---
Incoming -320 fatigue damage.
---
Can you read the title? I'm saying it was an annoying moment... Nothing else. Zephrys was my only chance of winning the game.
---
Reallh expensive if you want to craft top tier decks. Each has around 5 minimum legendaries
---
Priests identity is being an underdog class. It's the ultimate hipster class in HS. 
---
It used to be control class. Now it's nothing really. Though this expansion has given me hope, I like the new cards.
---
She will be missed, if "she" there is.
---
Yeah, CC is super balance, it's just people that are overreacting /s
---
Eh, I'm actually okay with only one class getting a hero card each expansion. Having only one Hero card that's a core focus of the new expansion actually makes things more interesting... as long as they don't have ridiculous effects to compensate.
---
Hagatha and Zul'jin are really thematic to their expansions and honestly pretty balanced. Powerful, but not oppressive, and having a hero card occasionally in the meta I think is good for the game. Really this issue is just... Boom.
---
Last 3 Months have been Warriors and Mages.
---
I personally don't like arena because the fairness takes a nose-dive with the amount of wins I have. 7 wins and onwards? Prepare from some absolutely scuffed shit when you get hit by a Hunter with 6 copies of Baited Arrow and 4 copies of kill command.
---
Well, yeah, that's what I meant by the nerf.
---
I myself never played during the machine gun priest era, but I heard that a nerf was well-deserved. Just not the way Blizzard did it.
---
Though Blizzard has implemented a refreshing hero power with the new Warrior quest this expansion.
---
Cyclone's issue is in tandem with stuff like mountain giant.  Though admittedly the random generation of spells can lead to frustrating stuff sometimes, access to extra freezes, for example, is just PAINFUL.
---
For me its twisting nether, fireball, or savage roar 80% of the time
---
Uther was balanced, if it was oppressive, it's because of Beardo or the bounce cards.
---
It wasn't really oppressive though.
---
&gt; For the last months, there was only one viable deck, TempoQuestMage.
---
We're talking about wild here, right?
---
I've played against 13 control warriors in a row at rank 7. So diverse.
---
Every card game ever has had graveyard decks. Whether it's MTG or Yugioh, they all had decks that played around their graveyard. However, the biggest problem in hearthstone is the lack of the graveyard itself.
---
Even if pre-purchase sales drop by, let's say 80%, I'm pretty sure nothing will change, except the game we all love will only die quicker.
---
Just look at Twitch viewership ratings, HS is at all time lowest by far and most other companies would start considering some drastic changes at this point to preserve what's left of the game.
---
3 damage and 3 healing as a hero power, crazy. 
---
Ping and spawn a water elemental as a hero power, crazy. 
---
The only issue with Boom is that the other classes don't have their own hero card to fall back on. He's very average in Wild. That's why instead of nerfing I'd rather see the devs HoFing the card.
---
Change your mind that you'd be more incentivized to reach a higher rank if the reward was greater? I don't doubt it.
---
Problem is that people might feel pressured to reach legend or risk losing out on a big reward. Instead of reaching a rank you'd be happy at, like rank 5, you'd feel forced to keep grinding further. That's not fun.
---
Doubt Blizzard wants to give such a large amount of dust to people, especially to those that are reaching legend. Those are the people that are the most likely to pay for packs.
---
Nice ones there, I had more fun reading them then facing control warrior and cc mages, thank you.
---
If that’s so obvious tell my why everyone’s bitching about how busted Boom is when it literally isn’t, it’s just pretty good. Oh and how many reddit posts were made of people bitching about Jaina? Where was the wave of people screaming for Blizzard to hof Jaina? Also imagine saying all of that without being such a fucking condescending asshole
---
The game was designed to be addictive for a reason
---

The easiest solution is to stop spending money on the game. The game makes a disproportionate amount of cash compared to how much content it has. 
---
I still enjoy the game casually, but I stopped pre-ordering (still bought the E-sport bundle), and I can still craft the cards I need. 
---
Also, I have always seen HS as a casual game that you play 1-2 games daily or less. Given how much money it makes, it should have more content, but it doesn't truly need it.
---
If you play HS multiple hours daily, that's your choice, but you shouldn't put more effort (and money) than its worth it for your entertainment.
---
I understand some discontent and threads about what HS could change, but not in a post about some person enjoying a silly joke, imo.
---
Hoping to get a platinum. Yet what he gets was downvotes
---
True, why don’t they just make the game for nothing? Haven’t spent a cent since beta, 50k dust in the bank. Don’t craft control decks everyone week and you’ll be fine, and play arena instead of busting 100 gold packs every chance you get.
---
It’s a shame to see him leave, but I understand that he’s not going to want to play the same game for 6 years
---
Doing an edit when you get an award makes the comment less interesting.
---

I’m gonna do what they call a “pro gamer” move

It was solid top decking! I just kept thinking "don't have Vanish. Don't have Vanish."

---
I know that feel bro. That’s why i moved to control warrior
---
Despite all the (justified) criticism Blizzard gets right now I must admit that I having the most fun playing Highlander decks since several years. It feels extremly great to play Zephrys each time. The bug fixes for is AI also really helped. 
---
Wild &amp; cards like this and Reno are what keep me play Hearthstone.
---
I came up with the same idea for the hero power nerf.  Just pulling off armor as a possible roll makes it far riskier to play Dr. Boom.  There's many games I've seen that were determined by high rolling the armor hero power, making it nearly impossible to ever push down health enough to matter.
---
Nerfing Omega Devastator by losing its mech tag would help a lot as well.
---
I mean golden legendary, sorry
---
Ha!  I actually tried my old Silence Priest deck after making my comment, lost horribly, then decided it still wasn't for me.
---
I mean, Northshire Cleric is a pretty nuts card in a vacuum. Pre-nerf Patches and Small-time Buccaneer as well.
---
What is the 3 mana card? I can’t catch it on mobile.
---
Releasing more of these is probably the least healthy solution for Dr. Boom. Instead of one oppressive card, you come with potentially eight more oppressive cards for the coming two years.
---
When I do that, I'm mostly trying to finish a quest of playing this many minions or this many cards of this class. It's not to annoy you.
---
I guess that it still depends on luck, and the deck seems to be more popular in Legend than 1-5. But I've met at least 10 of them since new expansion's launch and I've been playing some games with the deck myself too. Amet really makes a difference (the card's an MVP), so does Psychopomp.

I hate these screenshots and gifs where we're meant to assume the opponent is a dick because they emoted once. For all we know, the OP has spent all game playing like shit, roping, emoting and getting bailed out by absurd luck and his opponent finally had enough of it.
---
Of all the replies twitter mobile showed me from the iksar tweet there was one tweet saying they disliked the new Murloc Paladin every other tweet disliked Conjurer Mage or Control Warrior. I’m expecting nerfs right after Master Tours Seoul is over next weekend.
---
No. You're not going to get to fatigue as a Rogue very often without Myras even if you build a really bad deck focused on getting to fatigue.
---
If Nomi without Vanish is even playable? Yes, absolutely, Nomi + Myras just work well together, but Nomi's never been that great of a card; even if you run it it's one of the worst cards in the deck and the first card to cut for something else.
---
Consider this, for Nomi to be good you need to 
---
a) draw him b) draw Myra's c) be able to play him in fatigue without dying d) your opponent not to have an answer and e) not being able to win after Myras without him.
---
That is very unlikely.
---
It's "discover a legendary card, summon 2 copies of it"
---
Whereas any regular deck may contain 2 of that copy. So technically your right but in this sense your wrong when comparing to any 2 of decklist.
---
The reason why Highlanders need support is because RNG is increased twofold. Not drawing the card you need become more of an issue and having only one copy of removal or AOE makes it even more inconsistent. Of course strong cards help but that is the case for any deck period. Zephrys was simply a design used to help Highlanders deck catch up from inconsistencies and allow them some wiggle room. With that being said, another card with equal strength would put Highlanders over the top. But maybe a highlander epic or rare card that tutors draw (of minimal power level) or Highlander spell that gives you 30-40% chance to have positive affect would help.
---
Maybe he meant more that they really earned it. Yep, they did everything right and won. Props, good game. Rather than the games where all you do is watch them misplay constantly and still win because of deck imbalances or crazy highrolls.
---
Yeah absolutely. How much I hate a voiceline at least for me is strongly connected to how good or borderline op the class is and how it feels like to play against it and warrior is way up top currently.
---
Oh I was just testing decks, I'll probably be reaching 10 or lower this season depending on how much I play
---
Two vee fucking Two.
---
I always enjoy games much more when theres a random team mode. Really mixes up the gameplay.
---
I used to play a crapton of 4v4 random team in Warcraft 3. I'm currently hooked on 2v2 in Minion Masters. 1v1 is stale. 2v2 is so chaotic, I love it.
---
Unlucky, killed my 6 win spree I think :c
---
... Hey, you know what?
---
I hadn't thought about that. That's actually a really good counterpoint that makes me reconsider my original position.

What do you even expect from reddit

For "months of content" see starcraft franchise expansions, og and II.  In starcraft you payed @30-50 bucks for the *entire* game, every unit, every mission, and every cutscene.  Could you imagine having to pay $200-400 to get full access?  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I understand the f2p aspect of hearthstone complicates things, maybe they could sort of copy starcrafts model by steeeply discounting rotated card packs while maintaining Standard as the preemium/freshest content for paying players.
---
Here's an idea.
---
Instead of just getting a bunch of packs when you pre-order an expansion you also get to vote for an implementation idea for the next expansion.
---
That way you are truly voting with your wallet (not just not buying an expansion) and Blizzard get a clear image of what they should implement to make more money.
---
That’s a pretty fun deck. I’d stick with it. Only disenchant cards you know for sure you’ll never use or are from classes you don’t enjoy. Try to do your quest every day for the gold. I will usually make a wild deck to complete them fast if I’m at a spot where I don’t want to lose ranks. Slowly you’ll be able to improve your deck and add better cards to it.  Good luck.
---
Less polish in what sense? The music, voice acting, and legendary animations are all quite polished.
---
Ever since they started this $80 pre-order Ive stopped paying for packs, last time was Rastakhans Rumble because the pre-order was only 50 and I loved the Rastakhan hero, but i will never pay 80 bucks for a preorder, and the 50 dollar one now is just not worth it either
---
I did not even finish it...
---
Ironically, it was completely the opposite. It was designed as a desktop game and hastily converted to mobile.
---
1. Ziliax is one of the few exceptions since its a neutral legend that serves multiple purposes. Like ysera is a good card but u would nvr see it in an aggro deck. The thing abt class legends is that they should all at least be playable on a consistent basis. Hireek is easily the worst loa and was only playable just before the rotation (ik from experience cuz i got it as my free loa and made a deck to fit my only loa from rr) which means that now its just worthless without significant buffs
---
2. Good cards being behind a paywall is pretty bad for the most part considering the sheer no. of legends. Meta stats put most decks at arnd 10-11k dust on average. 1 epic costs 400 dust but only gives u 100 dust and ur incentivised against dusting legends since u technically guarantee a 1.2k dust benefit for not dusting it since youll nvr pack it again. So its basically impossible for the average player to play more than 2 decks (3 if very lucky) per expansion and thats just sad
---
It should be discover a spell that costs 2 less. And maybe you need to casr 12 spells to balance it out.
---
But then again we are talking about blizzard actually caring about their community.
---
Handlock worked like this for years and no one complained. Same goes for the current quest druid. Some decks just work like that, it's not necessarily faulty. I agree, however, that Pocket Galaxy on 5 or not has way too much impact on the game. It would probably be fine to increase CC to 4 mana and pocket galaxy to 6, as both cards are problematic because they are playable so early.
---
I haven't read everything you typed but I read the question if it's pay to win and it's sorta both yes and no.
---
You don't necessarily have to pay to win. You could technically survive on the daily quests alone, hell I have never spent a single euro on the game and have quite a collection if I do say so myself. Admittedly I only play wild so I have a lot more cards available compared to what I would have in standard but still, it only took me a couple of years to collect it. Also a bit on and off playing. Some weeks I would play nearly every day and other times I wouldn't touch it for weeks or months on end.
---
TL;DR: not necessarily play to win, you can build a fun deck without paying, but you probably won't be getting high up ladder. 
---
I have the same, but I play for fun, not to do very good.
---
Ye, why healing (passive) would be ever better than silencing (active)?
---
Thats the joke
---
Yeah- was late and autocorrect was playing up it seems
---
I see priest and having some of the best removal is something that hasnt changed since i left hearthstone.
---
I learned that today, too.
---
Lol. Blizzard caring.
---
80€ is almost an entire month of *eating out* for me and definitely a whole one if I do something myself on weekends. I can't imagine spending so much on random virtual goods.
---
In an indirect way, they *do* listen. Because when people complain and aren't heard, they get fed up and either stop spending money or leaving. And after listening to the shareholder call earlier this month I can tell you that they *do* notice that.
---
Isn't Barnes a pseudo-finisher though, a bit akin to Tip the Scales?
---
I don't and still can craft almost every deck...
---
Hunter and Druid DKs weren't Oppressive. 
---
UI and SP were the problem with Druid.
---
DS Rexxar wasn't good until all the broken card were rotated or nerfed and the met slowed down until hunter could play it.
---
true
---
Whatever gets them more money with minimal effort I guess.
---
What's that minion he has on the board? With an opponent at 6 health he might just have lethal without the board clear already
---
and why is that huge issue? its better then reward being so great (like golden legendayr evrytime + other rewards from before golden epic and all) and having to grind legion, cause elseyoure missing so much
---
(getting  like 5times as much dust total instead of 400 and bit you got 2000 and a bit). 
---
Legend rewards should be better but shouldnt be huge difference from rank 5 so that people loose out on alot of they dont grind legend(which is a pretty big grind for average person/player)
---
I think I know the deck you're referring to, my quest shaman got wiped on turn 5 and since I had all the the cards I decided to try it out. Fastest board climb of my life but it feels so cheap and unsatisfying.
---
Not shown: he has 3 health and opponent has frostbolt
---
hahah get fucked ma duuude haha i want to see ur face when tjis shit happens
---
but ye i gad soularium and myras alrdY
---
No because if you ever want to start playing then now is the best time.
---
It’s like planting a tree, “the best time was 15 years ago, the second best time is now”
---
i dont play hearthstone that much but i do appreciate this meme lol
---
You can make money playing pokemon?
---
For real, i still play spiteful decks and it could totally be 6 mana in wild. Also hunter spellstone doesnt deserve to be 6 mana in wild.
---
she must have got him from a pack. whizbang is marked as not playable or craftable until you reach rank 25 but it's not free.
---
Its zephRYs!
---
Oh well that explains it then!
---
i really like this deck, alot of fun
---
Shaman was godo while 1 mana evolve was in game.
---
I just don't get why we can't at least buy deck slots.
---
I mean I see what you're saying but I've never had the cards for most of the decks you mentioned so wild gets kinda boring for me. I have a decent odd pally and a mage otk but getting a fun control deck is so hard when you dont have many neutral legends. I'll admit I've been super unlucky though dusting is definitely more expensive in the long run you're right. But I'm talking 2 mukklas, pagle, 2 millhouses, corrupted mukla, lorewalker, it's been fucking rough. I wish i hadnt played until they made legendary dupes impossible it's such bs getting 400 dust instead of a new legend.
---
Valeera took the longest to find a home, IIRC. Only played in the grindiest versions of Quest Rogue after the 1st or 2nd nerf.
---
I'm all for brainwashing and shit. but please keep religion out of my video games.
---
I'm sorry to tell you this is no humour. It is the core Hearthstone exprerience, with unwinnable match-ups, bugs and missing features.
---
You'll get used to it eventually.
---
I'm a casual player and don't remember cards by their name, what does the 4 cost card do?
---
Short: yes. Long: yes. Honestly this game is grindy as fuck and starting now without dropping money is gonna be a pain. Will take you at least 6 months to get a halfway decent competing deck. But most Digital CGs are similar (magic arena is a bit more beginner friendly).
---
If you're gonna spend money buy an adventure IMO, since it's most efficient. If you want to stick F2p that's fine too, as long as you don't mind possibly unfun grinding. Let me assume you're gonna have time play daily, mostly:
---
1. Your long term goal should be a cheap aggressive wild deck. It's immune to the rotating standard format and can allow you to reach rank 5. (sounds tall now, but the reward is worth it if you keep at it.) you can find lists online, so wait till you can craft one fully and go at it.
---
2. You can also play arena only. Which is the most viable way, but not fun for me. There are tools online that help with it though.
---
3. Save your quests. 50G is the mininumum reward, so you should look to reroll  one each day to get more gold out of them.
---
4. You can also grind money through daily wins, but that's super slow so I don't recommend it.
---
5. Google for beginner achievements/newbie experience. There's some gifts you can get, and before you get stuck at rank 20 there's still a lot of rewards around for you at this point, which might change your opinion.
---
6. Stick to buying classic packs for now. They suck, yeah, but they resist the rotation. There's a sweet spot where you can swap, since you'll always get classic packs through events and quests, but you're not at it now.
---
The game is honestly fun... To a point. The grind sucks, but the design is classic blizzard, though it it's frustrating to not be able to play the cool stuff. It's up to you in the end.
---
I have no bombs in decks, it was discovered
---
Rogue runs EVERYTHING! Haha!
---
Dank
---
I don't think the dev intend to make it a target, i agree. But because how expensive it is to build a deck (i'm sure you heard stories about people spent hundreds of dollar only to get a portion of the whole expansion), i'm sure many people treat it as a daily goal. Especially F2Ps. F2Ps will always find a way to progress, because they want to catch up to non-F2P. They *had* to get that 100G daily. What i'm afraid is they get burn-out after a lot of grinding. People stop playing = no matchmaking =  no game.
---
&gt; who plays more for 3.33g per win?
---
That's right, it's too low. That's why i'm suggesting an increase.
---
I don't know, control warrior (in standard, reno decks for wild) has always been my favorite deck to play and I have been really struggling this expansion.  Murloc Paladin can often kill you despite your sweepers, and aggro decks drawing the balls just run you over.    
---
I am maybe not playing the single most optimized list and it is just anecdotal, but I have been struggling to find an effective one.  On the other hand, I run over anyone and everyone with the Druid Quest deck which is an entirely new archetype.
---
Riftcleaver text hurts me :&lt;. Stonehill Pretender is also on point.
---
Overall - great post!
---
Good sportsmanship
---
Oh that deck. I've never lost to it with Control Warrior, played it maybe 3-4 times. Never once did I felt like I was in danger of losing.
---
Meanwhile when mages have a 2 card otk, warlocks draw an entire deck and still lose to crap like shaman or druid
---
But classic Finley’s *sweet abs*
---
It’s hard enough as it is. It would be nearly impossible to watch their hand closely enough to do this while playing out your own turn. Further, it would make _not_ constantly shuffling your hand around a misplay. There comes a point where making things harder no longer makes them more interesting.
---
I’m just saying, people are weirdly committed to being shitheads
---
boooring
---
Honestly Gagdetzan was the last time I spent real money on packs and that was simply because I really liked the Mafia theme.
---
Before that I was almost entirely F2P but I would spend real money on the adventures because I felt they were worth it. You knew exactly what cards you were getting and you had to "earn them" via a storyline mode.
---
Now, with the lack of a story mode and a barebones (storyline wise) pve  simulator that recycles most of the same mechanics I'm barely in the mood to play nowadays let alone spend any money on the game.
---
Ultimately, this might be my last expansion. The game doesn't offer enough to keep me interested and this comes from someone that spends a lot on physical tcgs.
---
9+1 and 10 are two different things in Hearthstone
---
Control warrior = downvote
---
When you get out of middle school, you’ll understand
---
I am the unluckiest person ever... 47 Packs 1 legendary in this expansion
---
i belive it's because this is not permament mana, thats why you cant coin them out
---
Fucking amazing card though. He almodt always hits the right target
---
Why?
---
I got no idea why dis got downvoted.
---
You don’t have to drop hundreds on this game and certainly not thousands. Look up budget decks, they are plenty good enough to compete with they just require more skill and knowledge to use other than “drop legendary and win”. The new Zoolock in particular is really good and can be made for under 2000 dust.
---
I would do waht dota did. Everyone has all the cards and you only buy cosmetics golden cards, portraits, cardbacks, etc.). It also would actually make them balance the game properly because everyone has everything and everyone can play the most busted start always, they can also nerf cards way more safely because people didn't invest anything into those cards and have everything else to play with.

6 mana for a 5/5 beast with Rush is very good. But then you add in Dire Frenzy's, the Animal Companions, the Master's Calls, etc. and now Zul'jin gives your opponent four 5/5's (or bigger) some other beasts, a full hand, maybe some 4/7 scalehides....all with Rush or Charge. The fact that all of the cards leading up to Zul'jiin are quite good, and then with a single card they can repeat all of it is what's stupid about it. Massive swing turns that have no counterplay are just bad, lazy design.
---
It's a bad expansion - the quests are a bad design, leading to degenerate gameplay, going up against what was already a degenerate meta. You can't have good Hearthstone when traditional minion-based decks are completely overmatched by quests, mega-board-swings, quasi-infinite value, otk, etc.
---
I paid like 40 bucks on packs and i reached rank 4. I dont see the problem, just craft stuff u want and disenchant all golden cards and u fine i think.
---
Don’t listen to the people telling you PG, you never run pocket galaxy in cyclone mage, you run that card in freeze mage, which doesn’t seem to be what you are trying to do here, Antonidas and kasha’s are your better options. Antonidas is in fact good against the warrior match up but he can also be your last ditch effort when your giants have been delays with and you have no more big minions, usually a couple fireballs will do the trick. Kadgar can also ensure 4 big threats to deal with instead of only 2 which would require a full board wipe which many classes lack.
---
oh yeah, for the Naga Sea Witch nerf right?
---
[[Conjurers calling]]
---
yeah for a 1/4th dust return... If you own cards, you should be able to disenchant them as you please. Hearthstone is already expensive enough, it’s not like they hand us free cards all the time, so being able to disenchant a useless golden legendary seems important.

---
Because they want their art designers to "feel good about it"
---
Well, he hasn't cracked them yet
---
I'm not convinced tournament mode is what the games needs. But they could absolutely update the UI, add achievements or challenges for people to work towards, etc. It wouldn't be very difficult at all, they just need to stop being to lazy (or greedy) and put in some effort.
---
Always thought of this approach since seeing the results of the person who paid for an ad everyday to get Naga Sea Witch changed. I'm glad you're trying to keep them accountable OP and I hope your dedication with this post can get them to give us what we (both veteran and new) players deserve.

I think twinspell is the most problematic thing here. Having at least 4 copies of cc is too strong. At least 4 because you can discover it through the magic trick
---
Why is top of picture white?
---
I don't disagree but it is still a "I'm f2p but i want more free stuff" thread. I would be happy if a card pack gave you 7 cards but it isn't the reality. 100 gold cap isn't meant to a target.
---
Ya it's hard to come back when there really is no good incentive. And its just going to get worse as new, innovative games pop up and hearthstone stays the same ol crap and stuck on maintenance mode.

Just change it to "play 3 games" instead, with the requirement that is already set up in friendly matches where one player has to drop below 15 hp, just to prevent abusing

Yes I follow completely.
---
My thought on that was that only lock can really tech against jaraxxus since sac pac is a class.card.  emp being neutral means everyone could tech it in, so it's more likely to happen consistently.  Ergo make it not an instant loss when it happens, but VERY hard to recover from.
---
These features are possible in the future, we are actively monitoring player feedback and will consider implementing. Also on our radar, other PR bullshit etc  
---
There, that's your dev response.
---
That doesn’t seem like a bad system but I can see how the current system would make way more money. 
---
The risk I see with make hearthstone cheaper is the possibility of it becoming a lower quality game. Right now it just feels nicer than other mobile games. If it wasn’t a huge cash cow for blizzard I worry they would reduce the quality of the game. And it probably isn’t even that big of a cash cow now.
---
You can't really deck-build when the best archetypes are as powerful as they are now.
---
I like to think globally
---
I run the mage quest in my Reno mage because I opened it and mind you I’m completing this quest at around after turn 10. Not because I’m playing a bunch of low cost spells like cyclone mage (I’m running very expensive spells). However, this is essentially a tech-in for any high IQ CW matchups or if they are just able to deal with my threats.

A majority of the solo content is not free. The base game is free, but that's minute compared to how much of the content is paid for. The time investment to make the game "free" is massive and in my opinion that's not free. Fornite is free, LoL is free, HS is not free.

At least it happened on turn 9, better this than losing on turn 5 to Tip the Scales IMO.
---
For me it's depends. Maybe people consider what I do as BM? For example the other day I got the puzzle box of yogg saron randomly in arena so I emoted before I used it as a way of saying "yolo, lets see what happens". I just think it's fun. I lose that match because he later topdecked a korkron elite and he greeted me and I just thought it was hilarious.
---
To be honest he’s making it into a lot of non highlander decks too as a lategame drop to search for lethal/board clear just to give you a slight edge that your opponent can’t really see coming.
---
Im having a great time, the meta is the best ever yet.
---
Oof
---
I talked about gold cap because someone uses it as an excuse to discourage botting, instead of for average player's benefit, which is dumb because the gold cap encourage botting more than doing anything to prevent it.
---
I barely ever care about gold cap. Be it 50 or 100g, it doesnt affect me one bit with the current pace. I can't play more than 4-5 games a day anyway. It has always be something for people with unusual time investment in this game, or bots. Well, I am invested for only one day each month to reach rank 5 and if climbing 8 ranks is considered not invested enough, this game has a shitty progression design.
---
We should just merge r/hearthstone and r/hearthstonecirclejerk at this point.
---
I'm pretty sure they printed it exclusively for e-Sports.
---
Looking at their viewernumbers they probably gonna be desperate to get people to watch somehow and they probably think that this will do it.
---
That's a good question, I think it was somewhat early, but still longer than Day 4.
---
Yeah, that's the new combo Druid. I even generated over 5000 armor once, because I managed to duplicate my hand with Elise.
---
The strategy is to generate so much Armor, that your opponent can't kill you and will either give up or die because of fatigue.
---
The main counter of that deck is Geist though.
---
Well it’s not rng, it offers a way out, but you need to know what you are trying to get in order to ensure that you get it. It’s a high skill card. Additionally there is counterplay with bombs.
---
I'm pretty sure his point was they didn't destroy the card in one swing, as it took 3 seperate nerfs.
---
I'd be hesitant to even called the third one a nerf, more like a side effect of them changing how mechanics work?
---
Thanks. Don't play much (so first I'm seeing of that card) but I love trying to keep up with all the crazy plays.
---
 Pictures taken before disasters.
---
He’s not RNG. Most of the time you play him you know exactly what you’re looking for. 
---
Also pretty sure they’ve never banned a card from competitive play, so I seriously doubt they would start now.
---
Not at all safe
---
And yet even after all of that people still played the deck in tournaments.
---
Chinese bar at the center of the city. roughly 4€ for chicken with rice and some extra of your choice, up to 6€ on more fancy meals.
---
Mind that I'm living outside Euro zone so while probably respective buying power of our currencies within our countries is similar. Yet assuming we have similar jobs paying out national average you can get so much more if you bring your payment here (and vice versa, me going to Germany or France would pay 4x on food).
---
I think by now they should've cut the dust prices of everything by two but they still haven't
---
Nice! It looks fun to play.
---
If the other guy hadn't played shudderwock yet there would be no good reason to play generous mummy
---
I feel like I’m the only one who isn’t that bothered by Boom.  It’s strong, but I’ve never felt like it was OP.  With no DK or quest, I’m consistently out valuing it with Reno Mage.  As Bran Hunter, I can usually just kill them.  Quest Priest usually out values them.  So does mass res priest.  I’d imagine that quest hunter bears control warrior, too.
---
Idk, maybe I’m crazy, but it just doesn’t feel like it’s over the top in value.

I meant lucky by getting more golden copies of cards than usual.
---
Good info, I didn't get new quests Wed, Thu or Friday of this week.  However, I got new quests yesterday and today.  Did I miss out on other legendary quests (I completed the play 100 cards and got 3 packs as reward) or are the legendary quests refreshed once a week?
---
&gt; I talked about gold cap because someone uses it as an excuse to discourage botting, instead of for average player's benefit, which is dumb because the gold cap and the gold acquisition we have now encourage botting more than doing anything to prevent it.
---
I completely disagree. Since the gold cap was put in and the wave of banwaves came out I've come across maybe 2 botters? The 100g cap certainly deters botting, really no point in risking your account for 1 pack a day.
---

---
You're exactly like me and I agree with the above. The cap doesn't affect me, it isn't a good argument to increase gold received from wins. The cap is there to discourage botters while at the same time not affecting normal players. It does just that. Sorry to hear you missed rank 5 last month.
---
Toxic drinking water =/= bad tap water.
---
It's definitely fun, but struggles against aggro.
---
You're too fragile if you think spamming thank you is toxic
---
I think it should simply be 10 gold per win. If the cap per day is 100g then winning 10 games is actually a lot.  Realistically that is at minimum an hour.  You could give 20g per win capping at 100g per day and it would still be difficult for people with a job/family/other hobby. There is motivation for such a low reward besides greed.
---
Average daily gold is closer to 57 now i believe if you count card pack rewards as 100 gold. Packs dont usually contain 4 commons and a rare but that os the minimum reward. atleast 1 in 10 packs contains a rare and 1 in 40 contain a legendary guaranteed. you can get 4 or 5 packs a week from just buying them with gold and tavern brawls. Playing arena well will return higher rewards however.
---
This statement is a little off topic - But I don’t know why everyone loves cards like this. Maybe I’m just not *WaCKy eNouGH* for Hearthstone, but it just entirely takes the wind out of a match when someone wins due to something like lethal off of Zephrys. It just elicits feelings of like, “...*okay*?” Why did I spend ten minutes on this match? Why did I bother going through the motions of almost defeating you just for you to pull a spell out of your ass that doesn’t exist in the deck you created? 
---
Am I truly the only one around on this sub who feels like win conditions should actually *exist*? How does the novelty of something like Zephrys, or that Yogg spell, or even simple Burgle Rogue, not wear off after a day or two? How do people enjoy winning on some weird accidental technicality?
---
Why are played winrates so different to the deck winrates? Who has their quest an doesn't play iy

---
Pretty sure deck of wonders was banned, possible Yogg too.
---
I'd agree that it could be quite powerful - it's given some massive swings both for and against me this last week, but it you do ban it - it sort removes singleton from competitive play doesn't it? The other cards need it I think to justify going singleton. 
---
Plus like u/PsYcHoSeAn says - it'll make great videos and streams especially on the big competitions - it's bound to be contriversial either way.
---
I guess I haven’t enough with him to be able to predict what he offers. How are bombs counterplay? Just because if you dig for him you might hit them?
---
I don't play any giant in my Reno Mage and I am still doing great, all you need is Luna's pocket galaxy and if I RL need that giant I can still get it from Zephrys
---
why is there only 1 choice there? Shouldnt discover mechanic show 3?

---
They are. But it is a physical collection at least and there's a lot of people out there who collecting things and keeping them, passing them on, etc....could be anything..rocks, baseball cards, watches, etc etc.
---
Hearthstone however, is not a TCG. It is not trade able. You can't give this stuff to anyone else. And if blizzard decides to pull the plug one day, where's your collection? It's all digital lol. You don't get shit lol
---
Good for them. HS doesn't operate like that. 
---
By the way, I have a free account on the EU server and it has quite the significant collection. I've been able to make several tier one decks and a few janky decks for fun, and never spent a dime. How did I manage to pull off that miracle if HS is only p2w?
---
By the holy light!
---
I will think Siamat is the safest.
---
&gt; I always bm even if I'm about to lose
---
Bombs are “counterplay” (lol) because it means that your deck contains duplicates, which means that Zephrys won’t work.
---
Major city in Poland, could just stated this right away.
---
Siamat might be the only safer craft in the deck. He feels like this expansion’ zilliax.
---
That being said, zephrys is incredible
---
Yep.  Versus a 10 mana opponent.
---
Yeah unfortunately i was trying out a taunt warrior so not much aggro there lol.
---
Everyone got one for logging in during launch I believe? I’m pretty sure if you log in you’ll still get one.
---
There is literally no deck that “pilots exactly the same every time”, unless you’re at rank 20 and don’t understand how to alter your decision making in a way that actually garners a positive win rate.
---
deck code ?
---
I’ll just assume that this is sarcasm,
---
Because she only meta decks have been there for several years and are most likely not to be replaced unless if blizzard 
---
A) nerfs cards
---
Or
---
B) makes a Modern format
---
Wait do you mean conjurer mage will have 2mountain giants &amp; 2conjourers calling jg in hand?
---
They may know how to make the most money but they then keep that for themselves rather than improve the game. They know how to make the most money, they don’t know how to keep their player base though
---
I stopped playing in last season.
---
Welcome to the meta.
---
Is this satire? Increase conjurers to 7 mana? Dr. Boom passive is like Guldan battlecry? Wut lol
---
Am I freaking out or something? There's no name calling, no profanity, I don't even come off as particularly upset. How much more chill can I get while expressing my opinion?
---
Like 11+4 and 15
---
starting f2p now basically means you won't be competing at any level until your cards you're getting now rotate out of standard and you dust them. or you could mill entire classes to focus on one. otherwise this game is exactly like you're fearing. pay or be left behind.
---
they deserve to have a playable hero card, like every other class. I definitely would prefer both Hagatha and Dr. Boom get HoF:ed, rather than nerfed. Neither card is even close to problematic in Wild. They were basically created to compensate for Warrior and Shaman's shitty DK cards, and should really have been rotated out alongside Genn and Baku.
---
If you want to see something even more hilarious play wild, it's like standard on cocaine

I don't think that l have the needed dust to make a deck that would counter warrior in my big boy pants.

As a Player who only plays, when a new expansion is released, because the meta is "solved" too for my taste, this subreddit is really entertaining. The complaint threat is literally a joke, with features that are completly irelevant. Coming from league of Legends and beeing a long time real life Yugioh Player, you guys seem so fcking spoiled.  
---
A new permanent game mode is a redicoulos complaint, its not like these are easy to make. Having something that is enjoyable and isnt rotating is hard, look at League of Legends, where so many tries have failed and got retired, until recent TFT.  
---
And useless things like Auto squelch. Holy, like, you get a new expansion, climbing the latter is quiet fun, and you compare about "auto squelch".   
---
Getting angry while typing this, I'll stop now to enjoy the expansion hahaha.
---
It sounds like your deflecting from my very valid criticism of you "opinion ". Very unchill
---
Maybe
---
 I would definitely like more transparency, especially since they’ve claimed that they’ll get better at it
---
Should be fine... Just pretend it's the last card in the deck every game.
---
This is kinda not the same thing though right?  Complaining about how expensive it is, if you graph the complaints somehow, probably comes up MORE at the beginning of the cycle, as by the end more people have more cards than not.  As for the other thing, the features are on a different cycle.  You don't expect new features every few months, but after a few years.  So that cycle is longer and just happened to coincide.  The "cycle" of expansions is that people complain about the DECKS.  Its a complaint of a different kind.  I don't see to many of them yet.  Someone is ALWAYS complaining, but not many about the DECKS at the moment.
---
i agree. priest is really good
---
You’re right. Rofl. Thank you! Apparently I didn’t notice it when I logged in so I just ignored it along with the other cards I’ve earned recently.
---
Better even stop giving it just for wins. And even better, decouple it from just the number of games and instead have playtime rewarded. Basically do a meter similar to experience and give us 10g for 20 minutes of matchtime or something like that.
---
Players paying lots of money doesn't ruin it for the rest of you, those players are the ones keeping the game free
---
hunter quest is the worst quest its unconsitent so i suggest just dust it to get a worthy legendary not sure what is it depends on what u like
---
Same thing happened when I tried to buy the welcome bundle. Here is the solution, log out (switch account an quit the game), delete cache of HS, turn off your phone, turn on your phone, login to HS again. Idk if this works for ios but it worked for my Android
---
I don't care if he gets nerfed or rotated but whatever it is needs to happen sooner rather than later.
---
i dunno why but the way you moused over them tilted me more
---
just log in and u will get a quest for free ! if u didnt get the notification just check ur collection ur find ur card
---
It's pretty obvious in my comment that I wasn't being literal
---
Glad if my typing helped u
---
It’s pretty obvious you’re misguided either way.
---
In mirror matches it basically comes down to whoever draws Dr. Boom first.
---
I'm playing the deck because if it's not a mirror match it's basically a free star. I feel like a heroic boss in adventure mode. He absolutely needs to be nerfed or retired.
---
I was enjoying playing the new Aggro Rogue, but then I realized even with a pure, focused aggro deck, you still can't avoid RNG elements because of Miscreant.  And that leads into even more RNG because 3/6 of the Lackeys are RNG.
---
take the 6 mana 4/6 one, much better than the 4/6 one.
---
 I would never dust any quest cuz they will probably get better in the future.
---
The only one that I can't imagine ever being good is Warlock's one, but still Blizzard might surprise us.
---
As for crafting:
---
-I would say that Siamat is a save craft it is kinda similar to Zilliax but a bit weaker and it will see play here and there for next 2 years
---
- Druid's quest is probably the best quest for now but will see how meta look like after nerfs that  everybody expects
---
-Zephrys super good and super flexible in every Reno deck. Id say that we have tier 1 Reno Mage and tier 2 Reno Hunter right now, so if you enjoy any of them go for Zephrys for sure
---
Ohh... :(
---
What a shame. If I could, I would give you mine ;)
---
I don't know, when you started to play the game, but I remember the time, when Warrior was absolute trash. After the nerf of War Axe and with the introduction of Jade Idol, Control Warrior was unplayable garbage. He recovered a bit with Baku and Quest, but only became very strong again recently with Dr. Boom as an option. So yes, Warrior deserved Boom to have the possibility to play Control again. An archetype which a lot of player loved in the past, including me.
---
It's not the fault of the Warrior class, that other classes didn't get the same treatment recently. It's a shame, that Priest for example, still didn't get enough tools, to beat aggro constantly. I remember, that there was a time, in which I could handle aggro very well with Priest. In fact, I played tons of Control Priest with the original Elise, Entomb and efficient Board Clears like E. Evil, Dragonfire Potion etc. Plague of Death is an effective clear against slower decks , but it doesn't help you against aggro at all.
---
Boom maybe needs to go, but he shouldn't be nerfed.
---
Just did that. Thank you :)
---
Wild is definitely more fun, I agree. I'm not playing that much anymore, and when I do it's arena mostly. I was playing Even Shaman during it's reign of terror because it was cheap. I had a lot of fun, especially when I met fun decks like Even Recruit Warrior. But once I got to the R4-Legend range it was the Big Priest/Odd Rogue/Even Shaman/Renolock quartet basically only. It gets really stale at that range, plus there are some degenerate combos in there that is no fun to play against, such as Darkest Hour Warlock or the new Linecracker Druid. I remember the times in Star Aligner meta, that was pretty freaking cancer.
---
Keeping people happy - namely your consumers - is 100% a science, though. That's why behavioral economics and associated psychological fields exist...
---
Nerf Pocket Galaxy.
---
really you dont own tess? you dont own zilliax? you living under a rock or something?
---
Should probably remove barista it probably a more game losing addition.
---
No but that's a good idea,  i diddnt even think of using that card!
---
I only play wild f2p and really enjoy it. There are endless insane home-brews I can try, a little Uldum, a little RoS, a dash of classic. I even win once in a while. =)
---
Control Warrior was okay last patch, but this patch they buffed it significantly, which was a very silly thing to do.
---
Negative. Not any any official Blizzard tournament anyways. Though they did eventually nerf Yogg he was never banned.
---
For anyone wondering, I think its actually "Stop copying me".
---
&gt;If you expect to spend $130 and be able to play every deck archetype in the new expansion you’re delusional.
---
Nobody *expects* that, you goober. We’re saying that the game is simply priced in an obscene way.
---
It basically means that by mulliganing and getting something to play early game your winrate goes up which is kind of funny.
---
Wild is and will be fine. The best Wild decks are not very expensive and there is no revolution about to happen where Reno decks come back to the top of tier lists.
---
However, Wild is still a turn 5 format the more competitive side of which is made of hyper efficient aggro decks, so if one doesn't enjoy that they might not enjoy Wild at all.
---
Define "competitive". Subject 9 is really really good.
---
Keeping him at 7 cost just because of a old unfunny meme is insane. I expected better from Chakki. People leaving the game dont care that he had a internet nickname stop ruining the game for a meme.
---
T H A T  I S  N O T  F 2 P
---
I've been playing a ton of Highlander Hunter, more than any other deck personally. You can run the deck just fine without Subject 9. I would argue it's the least important legendary, unless you were to replace the entire mech package of Ursatron/SN1P-SN4P/Zilliax with something else, which seems like a bad idea. 
---
The idea behind Subject 9 is that you want to get your secrets off as early as possible since they are cheap cards and synergize with early game cards (Secretkeeper, Masked Contender, Hyena Alpha, Eaglehorn Bow). So if you don't draw enough, you can slap down S9 on Turn 5 and get them all, which is a great play because it allows you to have your secrets but also thins your deck so you're drawing more of your mid- and late-game cards afterwards.
---
Without S9? You'll get your secrets off less consistently, sure, and you may topdeck them later when you don't want them. I don't think it'll tank your win rate. And if you're low on dust, I don't think S9 is a worthwhile craft just for this deck if you've got everything else.
---
Yes, League tried several alternate game modes with varying degrees of success before finding one that worked really well.
---
In 6 years Hearthstone has tried.....zero. Zip, zilch, nada, never even attempted it. Like, I am not asking for the perfect new format on the first iteration, I just want them to *try*. Also, MTGA isn't even out of beta and has more game modes than HS.
---
I'm sorry to say this but I stopped reading after seeing quest. Warriors quest is just bad and not worth playing in any deck.
---
Normally I hate the angsty posts but for as much fun as RoS brought us, SoU had destroyed it. So many potentially fun decks to try. Tons of bottom T2 or T3 options. But as so many others have put it, can it beat Boom? Can it kill an 8/8 turn 4? Can it compete with Pocket Galaxy? The answer is almost never yes.
---
Quest paladin trumps Boom. Great. That's 1 deck. And nowadays virtually every ladder viable t1/t2 deck is near or in some cases well above 10k dust. As much as it's ruining the game for me playing against it, I'd like to actually try the control mage deck but I'm not crafting Khadgar, Kalecgos, and Phaoris for 1 deck. The deck is nearly 16k fucking dust from scratch.
---
Honestly CC doesn't need to be touched directly, they need to either HoF all giants (Mountain and Sea please) or preserve mana costs on minions once played from hand. If you're playing that giant for 4 mana then he's a 4 mana 8/8. How can he be a 12 mana minion if you only paid 4 for him?
---
Frankly, I'd prefer HoF of giants and Boom and increase Galaxy to 6 (7 was stupid but 5 is way too cheap) or maybe just HoF that too.
---
Yeah I was referring strictly to official Blizzard-run tournaments. If you count everything then Firebat hosted BatStone which had several cards banned, including pre-nerf Fiery War Axe and Patches, IIRC.
---
I personally think anything less than 6 mana is unacceptable
---
HIS WHOOOOLE CAREER!!!11
---
Nah, I love smashing hopes and dreams like yours with my Control Warrior. God bless this game.
---
&gt;CC to 6 mana
---
Immediately lose all credibility, lol
---
It's not. You're in ranked mode. Just because it's 20 doesn't make people don't take it seriously.
---
I recommend we don't go down this particular rabbit hole. &gt;.&lt;
---
I've reached legend several times, but I think I've reached 30 wins in a day 3 or 4 times since release. 
---
I feel like the only people getting 100g a day regularly are streamers.
---
I understand that but even before the expansion came out this was happening. I know I’m bad but it’s just frustrating.
---
Yea. The giant CC thing is a problem I hope they fix soon. At least the game ends rather quick at that point.
---
And yet that is why hearthstone still dominates the market - hearthstone is losing box playerbase and twitch views but mobile is mostly uncontested and as long as it remains a dominant force they will not be motivated to innovate on the client. The devs specifically said they’re hesitant to complicate the client because mobile players might feel overwhelmed or not have the real estate to handle it... I *hate* the mobile client ui because it tries to hold to this “real card, real board” feel in a cramped space that would be served far better will dropping some of the “pretty elements” to make it faster and more functional.
---
I don't recall Benedictus being in Big Priest.
---
I would totally pay $50/year to have access to all currently usable cards. I actually really wish I could do this. I took about a year off and I'd have to pay hundreds if I wanted to have any competitive decks in standard, let alone wild.
---
It's frustrating that in the mode where you win at all costs, people are playing the best decks?
---
That's nothing, still missing like half of em bro
---
what i am actually mad at is the rush like I said.
---
the discovery is just a bonus card generation that gives clear combined with the rush. omega devastator is just the extreme example

---
I know right? Sometimes you totally whiff, sometimes you jsut get the right cards and most often you just get decent cards that give you juuust the edge to overcome your opponent.
---
I'm not gonna waste my time here. Because I know how this ends. But you need to open your eyes and realize you're missing the point. If you're missing it with something this obvious, you're probably missing larger issues.
---
It's funny that a huge amount of people (including me) thought Kibler was crazy for saying classic and basic cards should get HoF'd.
---
Who knew that a MtG pro and card designer was right all along.
---
Dr. Boom might be fine if they just remove mech tag from Omega devastator. And no need to refund dust!
---
Here is my idea of nerfs to both
---
For Galaxy 7 was too late but 5 is too fast, let's see how evening it out to 6 does.
---
CC: HoF Mountain Giant, can't play out the combo as early
---
Pauper which is Common only cards, could be Standard or Wild or both.
---
Peasant, which is Common and Rare only, again Standard or Wild or both.
---
"Tournament Mode" usually refers to any format that is not best of one, i.e. something that the pros play.  Maybe Bo3 Specialist, maybe Bo5 Conquest with a ban, maybe Last Hero Standing.
---
"Co-Op" Dungeon Run is a thing I've heard suggested, but that seems super hard to implement.
---
Sealed "Leagues" where you are given a small pool of cards to build a deck from.  Kind of like Arena, but the card pool is given to you all at once and for numerous different classes and you have to decide which one to build.  Usually small amounts of cards are added to your pool over time allowing you to reconsider deckbuilding options, before the League resets, often on a monthly basis.  The Eternal CCG has this and they are really cool.
---
Two-Headed Giant is a "team" game of 2v2 which people really want, but again that seems like a super hard to implement game mode compared to the others.
---
Those are just a few off of the top of my head.
---
nope
---
Calling sexist people out for being sexist (if that is what this is, which my money is on yes) then I have no problem fighting that fight.
---
I'm using decks from hsreplay and streamers. I used to think that rank 20 meant people don't have all the cards, or like new players. But now I realize i'm just really fucking bad at this game and I don't know what to do.
---
I've opened 76 boosters, totaling 380 cards. When I tried to dust the duplicates, i dusted 190 cards. Half of them were triplets+. You cannot expect from the average player to spend 80+50euro in preorders, only to get half their money's worth in playable cards! That is obscene, absurd, preposterous, to say the least!
---
I'm just saying if you really got that in 50 packs that is incredibly lucky, the "average" is one in 20 packs which means with a 50 pack bundle you usually get......3.  One in the first 10 packs guaranteed, then two in the next 40.  If you got 16 that is crazy good luck.
---
They may be using a card called “Whizbang” which lets them use deck recipe decks, which may appear to you to be what “pros and streamers” use. 
---
They also may be someone who simply hasn’t played the game in a long time, and have therefore been pushed back to rank 20. 
---
They also may just be 14 year old whales who used their mothers credit card to buy a huge assortment of cards, but are still terrible at the game, so they never get past the rank 20-15 range.
---
Thanks for the info. Some of those definitely seem like they would be fun and not super hard to implement.
---
To be fair, hs circlejerk has more competitive stuff than the main sub
---
Should I keep playing a deck even though I lose to learn how to play it?
---
Im just asking for a better way to farm gold
---
I’m convinced that if the hero power wasn’t random and instead went in order, the card would be much more manageable since you could know what to play around and the opponent couldn’t lucksack ito back to back discover and armor all game
---
^^^HULLOOOO
---
Probably because the money to dust ratio is much higher than through random packs.
---
I know this a repeated sentiment but this game could get hella expensive. I understand the argument that other trading card games cost tons to get most of the cards but this is a digital card game so there isn't the same as all of the scarcity is artificially created. It doesn't even have to be more free stuff necessarily. Just give me more incentive to actually buy packs.
---
If it’s any consolation, the vast majority of players are below rank 15.
---
They COULD. But it would have to be implemented in a way where it comes out of what YOU have, not from the ether. The inherent issue with that would be the obvious abuse. That, and they'd have to limit the total number of times you'd be able to do that per day, per week, or per month/season, UNLESS they didn't allow you to send it to your friends, and only allowed it in both ranked game modes.
---
Dungeon Keeper mobile was free as well. Your point?
---
They don't look here
---
Why would I agree with a nerf if I see no issue with it?
---
Do we already know if the new Solo player content from Uldum can / has to be paid with gold again, like the last time? Has there been any kind of information about this, do I need to save my gold?
---
What does that tell you? Maybe something's wrong. Better cover your hears, run away now!
---
Still to expensive tho
---
I play bomb control warrior without Dr. boom because I’m nice. Plus I know my opponent fears me playing it at all times so I enjoy the mental torture of me never playing it.
---
Sometimes I think they make new accounts just to lurk
---
Nada
---
Yeah, I'm probably super biased towards MTG cause I'm good at draft
---
Are you really asking if you have to practice with something in order to be good with it?
---
Well *of course* you do, mate.
---
You should figure out if it’s the deck or you. If it’s the deck, change your deck. If it’s you, study the way people who play well with that deck play it and learn to play it properly.
---
Since she was introduced as a card i’ve been only playing her decks. It’s the only deck I actually have fun playing because each game is different and I have to be on my toes to win.
---
I don’t really know how you manage to always loose as mage, since Giant+CC early on means defeat for them most of the time
---
Mecha’thun Warrior also beats it pretty much every time.
---
I’d like to shoutout the guy again who argued with me for a few days about how good the hunter quest is.
---
I’ve heard the “preserve the when-played cost” suggestion before and liked it. It might be a little wonky to program in the weird interactions (When a giant is sucked out of your deck is it 12? What about when it has a reduced cost in-hand but is sucked out via that new Hunter scorpion minion? Stuff like that.)  
---
But honestly it would be fine if they just preserved the cost if you played it from-hand in your turn.
---
Actually I don't mind playing against warrior until dropping that card (despite the annoying brawls and warpaths). Unless you use Dr. Boom you're not going to spoil my mood lol
---
Well if you want to seek out help for the game there are a lot of resources, including people on this sub that will help. But that's what you should be asking about, not why your opponents have good decks.
---
Damn straight. Exactly my thoughts.
---
Bomb Hunter, Combo Priest, and Zoo Warlock come to mind. Hunter list is the same as Rise of Shadows so no crafts from Saviors necessary. Combo Priest has Ahmet and 2x Psychopomps that are expensive but the rest is budget. Zoo Warlock did get upgrades from Saviors so is more expensive than usual but the core cards are cheap, are mostly evergreen, and have generally been relevant in most metas.

Yet you are still on the subreddit moaning, what are you, like 10?
---
Pretty smart of him to play excavated evil. Roping was rude, but maybe hoping for a d/c? Lol

---
I opened Warrior, priest and warlock quest. GEE GEE.
---
Maybe that started when they started with the rotating sets. But I'm sure you couldn't disenchant adventure cards before (except for the gold cards because you had to craft it first).
---
Priest and mage :( was very upsetti spaghetti I didn't get rogue
---
I fully agree with that decision.
---
Absolutely someone was though, fucking relax you god damn monkey.
---
TIL there is a 100 gold daily cap for winning games in hearthstone...
---
In my years of hearthstone I have never played even close to the number of matches it would take to hit that cap.
---
Yup, you can climb with cheap and mediocre decks, but that's only if you understand the game. Every newb whines about how much decks costs cause they have no idea how to make their own decks and just think they "must" use streamers decks with a million legendaries to win.
---
Have you checked out disguisedtoast.com?
---
I main mage and I am fucking loving it.
---
Wow is better anyways
---
Its been less than a week since release. Relax dude, damn.
---
Crafted golden warlock quest, no regrets.
---
Well they did take away jainas cleavage, so I guess thats enough renovation for blizzard
---
Actually it shouldn't tho since it was specified a lot of times how Zephrys does NOT check what's in your hand but only handsize.
---
I'm not the type of guy to work all day and then come home and continue worrying about getting more money at night. I like to blow my free evening time on whatever catches my eye.
---
Bevause we only got like 3 new features since the original launch of the game.
---
Don't ask for too much, small indie company bla bla....
---
Honestly I keep hearing the same thing and it’s getting to me that they don’t talk to us only when money is involved.... I feel like I’m there sugar daddy
---
"Being able to build 1 new deck a year"
---
LOL, sounds like you need to git gud. Newbs like you just copy streamers decks and think decks with a million legendaries are the only ways to win. You're just bad dude. I've made a dozen decks all without legendaries and have reached 12 wins in brawliseum a few times with them.
---
I dont agree because 3-3 is the average so you should be given approximately one pack's worth of value. The 50 gold you "lose" is compensation for getting to play cards you otherwise wouldn't and it's the tradeoff of doing arena. If everyone always comes out ahead in arena, theres no incentive to ladder. I think it would also lower the satisfaction from the arena pros that work super hard to get to the point where they can go infinite by lowering the standard for everyone
---
Average amount of quests complete in a month is 13 according to my last ranked email from blizzard, cleverly most of the community doesnt even finish half of the real incentive to come back everyday, no wonder everyone complains its pay2play
---
Negatory
---
Honestly, I do not think it's that bad. But maybe its the decks that I play (mostly mage). It's a very predictable play. You can mulligan against it. Earlier today I played a keysmith, he thought it was counterspell and played around it. It slowed him down that much that I ended up winning.
---
But maybe for some decks (druid maybe?) it's hard?
---
This doesn’t even scratch the surface of how bad it is, too. I have a full collection but still see “new” cards all the time.
---
And the fact that every class either has hyper aggro or  insane card generation. For all they were starting to do right they took some big steps backwards this expansion.
---
Yeah. I play about 5 games a month of ranked on average, some months I miss, but my 70% was 70% of games played since whizbang released.
---
The expansion did almost nothing.  All I'm seeing are Mages and Control Warriors that maybe play 1 or 2 new cards, if that.  It's awful.
---
RDU is one of the best streamers right now. No rage or "guys you are awesome, i love you too"...
---
Why is it absurd?  Running it in non-singleton decks mean you add that extra risk in running it, since there's no guarantee it will go off.
---
That's not a good excuse for lazy development
---
I'd rather it be 5 gold per win. This way you don't have to actually play 3 games if you are missing just a little bit of gold for something.
---
Is there some other reason behind this, that i’m not seeing?
---
I've crafted quest shaman and it's really good
---
I disagree. I demand they answer my questions or I’ll complain. That will show them. I might even threaten to stop playing. They wouldn’t like that.
---
I have no interest in the Latest Expansion. I still enjoy all of the expansions before this one.
---
Also, how about you buy a better insult? At least the insult would be better than this expansion.
---
From what ive seen, he tends to give an answer, a value play, and a tempo play, probably so he can fit all deck archetypes, not just focus on one play style
---
My opponents seem to highly dislike pulling a Mountain/Sea giant or Kalecgos from my hand.
---
Jokes aside tho, it's a pretty neat combo breaker and I don't get why it's not neutral as such.
---
Fuck, here an upvote sir
---
They're just not going to.
---
So true!  Just crafted Malganis (finally!) to go along with Zephrys. Having so much fun playing wild Renolock and Reno mage right now!
---
True, but there are decks that can make clever plays, such as deathrattle rogue, since those cards are versatile. Big priest and control warrior CAN’T, because their cards are extremely straightforward and don’t really allow for any creativity.
---
I see that guy around a lot, he's by far the biggest manchild on this sub.
---
But most people are, especially not new players. You can't realistically base an average F2P experience on that. For people who average 2-3 wins in drafts (so most of people), it might not be the best strategy.
---
It’s absurd and streamers should pay more attention to people not being able to spend this much money. It creates a very unfair disadvantage
---
Why would they ban a deck that’s not even top tier?
---
