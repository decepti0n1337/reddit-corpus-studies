Yeah I learned that yesterday, such bullshit
---
---
---
Definitely a big part of it, always seem to get a broken combo that wins every game.
---
I've got her to work twice. The deck sucked, only made it to 2nd phase murloc boss in heroic.
---
Indeed, I took him from 300 to 30 just to see his health be at 170
---
It is a bug that started last night. It is not intentional. Theres no way to fix it yet but blizz knows about it.
---
&gt; Rhastakan's Rumble was bad, no getting around that. Poor story and poor replayability.
---

---
You can't select the shrine you want and the game does not track the shrines you already won.
---
How there would be replayability this way?
---
It's totally random as far as I know if there are 2 copies that would meet the criteria.
---
Play heroic, beating them feels like an accomplishment. Imho that boss mechanic is the only improvement tombs of terror brings.
---
If theres more than one, its random, consistency will always plague discard warlock
---
Especially since most of the decks beside the starter one seem to be very lackluster.
---
that's clearly a facetious question; every game has progression otherwise why even play them
---
Yep it's a tavern card usually costing 4 coins and there's a massive range of decks you can get from him. Tho even getting the tavern card is tricky to start
---
I can't win 'em all
---
Shoulda played around it
---
It's actually caused by simple mathematics.  High cost cards tend to stay in hand for longer since you simply don't have enough mana/opportunities to play them.  Since they're in the hand for longer, they get exposed to more discard rolls.  Since the get exposed to more discard rolls, then end up getting discarded more than cheap cards.
---
I played a lot of Quest Discard Warlock back when it was in standard :)

Got it for my first treasure right after seeing it hyped up on here, then proceeded to immediately lose the 2nd fight. RIP in pieces hopes and dreams
---
&gt; I think I like it even less than rakastahns rumble’s which is kind of sad.
---
Rastakhan's Rumble was quite quick but a lot more enjoyable than this one. And I'm not even talking about heroic.

This is intentional

I was having the same issue on Android where it said checking version... but I let it run long enough and it finally prompted me to go to the play store for update. Not sure if that helps, sorry if not!
---
I don't think moving it to 2 mana is the right solution. Now that Extra Arms doesn't come down on 2 and buff it out of control, it's not overwhelming on 1. The problem is that as a 1/3, Cleric gets value against pretty much every other 1 or 2 drop in the game. There are only a few minions before turn 3 that contest it: Ooze, Pyro, Flame Imp, maybe tempo Zephrys. I'd like to see it dropped to a 1/2 stat line and kept at 1 mana.
---
Repeatable too. At that point you either kill him by turn 4 or you die to the psychic scream spam.
---
Also tip the scales into 3x megafin is just stupid.
---
Also whatever hp he is at when you start the fight is his Max hp
---
I got the final boss down to 20 health and an empty board.  A win in 1-2 turns.  They top decked random murlocs with 2 Old Murk Eyes for 18 damage to face and had four more damage in hand.  Was the hardest loss I have ever had.  280 of 300 health damage done lose to random murk eyes.
---
Got [this one](https://i.imgur.com/fKEh7Bo.png) today with a lot of treasures from old adventures.
---
Ok, thank you.
---
Thirty actually.
---
It is possible to get Nemsy nowadays?
---
i feel like it's really highrolly - i barely got past the 3rd boss on my first 2 heroic runs, and then got some crazy passives that let me take out the plague lord in one go the next time. you probably got pretty lucky with the treasures.
---
I looked again. Woah
---
Assuming each game is like 10 minutes long you'd spend 2 and a half hours every day at least which is literally inhuman, good job
---
OK, thanks.
---
Lol ty ty
---
yeah it's like muscle memory to me why I didn't attack first. I wanted random cards/draw resolved before I give the finishing blow. Thinking my opponent only had 9 hp left and I had a weapon with 4 gave me the confidence that Zephrys will give me a reach of 5 or even 6 damage but it didn't.
---
It’s not my favorite. Just looks kinda derpy imo. I’d expect a bit more heroic in his portrait but he looks like a bad Facebook photo where you’re in the back but don’t look too bad, so you settle for the profile pic.
---
If he was looking for lethal he should've figured it out that the opponent has 9 left, I had a weapon on hand with 4, and the taunt minion is stealthed.   
---
My most probable explanation is that Zephyrs can't distinguised a taunt minion from a stealthed taunt
---

---
You mean the worst hero power to copy. Husam, Octosari and some other hero power is fine and can win you the game against the plague lord
---
While this is generally true i just had murloc plague use tip, grab 3 ol murkeyes, all face, i clear, get a strong board that can windfury for like 50 damage, and the double twist into two more ol murkeyes for lethal
---
This is maybe incredibly broken, does random mean 0-infinity or 0-7, because you can play cards that summon over 7 minions and only 7 get played. Worst case it’s 1 mana draw a card, on average it’s a 1 mana 3/3 draw a card
---
Opposite for me. I lost fast w Finley lol so u stuck with reno all the way :D
---
But he has the coin.....
---
/s for stupid people
---
Some of these new deck upgrades are insanely powerful it seems
---
Different offer rates *I suspect* but also there are more treasures now than before too.
---
I don’t think there is, but honestly I don’t really know if there is a workaround if you change game files. 
---
In the options Ingame you can’t however
---
Update: I just did another run where I got one of Bobs Bombtastic decks and wrecked the Murloc plague lord with pogo hoppers :D 
---
I wish you the best of luck on your future runs!
---
Nice, so they have sorry emotes as well, just hidden.
---
Bring back sorry emote
---
Really? Which?
---
I had a run where I got double Glyph of Warding which basically had the same effect. Turns out it's really hard to do anything when all your cards cost 2 more. My deck wasn't anything super special, but I just had so much tempo against every boss.
---
Sounds like someone didn’t watch enough Indian coding tutorials
---
stonks
---
That's unfair. At 10 mana it can summon a Murloc Raider!
---
Maxwell the Noble Steed and Power Up the hero power is a pretty nuts combo. Easy 14 attack windfury
---
I was playing vs quest Shaman which had coin.
---
I tried this one too. I thought the same as you did.
---
He gets a 4/4 and you die
---
When you steal that hero power you take damage when a Murloc dies too. Problem is your health total is much lower.
---
its gotta be exact. you can only have 5 mana or 2 mana left after playing zeph boy.
---
You really aren't the first.
---
Interesting. Thanks a lot!
---
Archmage Vargoth is hexing you now for forgetting his name
---
Wowza so ramp must've been great I legit just hoped and prayed I got cards that lower the mana cost of my stupid expensive cards lol
---
no problem! zeph is kinda annoying to manipulate if you want a specific card.

\-Khadgar's Wondrous Wisdomball
---
That shaman turn all minions into murlocs card is lame.
---
The issue is having more than 2 of these types of cards. If they were only allowed to play one like the legendaries it would be better. Priests can plague of death to reset the game twice. Shaman can plague of murlocs twice. 3 mana is far too cheap for a card like that, they can turn their 1 mana minions into the same minions as my high cost ones.
---
Glory to heroes!
---
It's pretty bad for the first phase but excellent after that. I played a run last night where Bob also discounted all my cards by 1 meaning turn 1 was 4 pogo hoppers. 
---
And for what its worth, I was offered the "draw and shuffle" card package after every single win. Not sure if it was luck or if there is something about having a deck of low cost minions that affects the packages you are offered.
---
It either happens or it doesn't
---
1/(total number of dragons in the game)^2
---
If you're new I suggest you focus on the standard format. There are a couple cheap lists out there that are quite good, and I don't think you can keep up with wild for now.

🤷‍♀️ I had fun. Discover a Treasure is really ridiculous.

That's exactly correct. I used that anomaly.

That's how I best the second wing first try

---
I'm personally not a fan of that idea. We don't want to discourage anyone from making cards, especially sets of cards which tend to be more interesting and of higher effort. What I might do is revert back to album form, showcasing multi images, whenever the need arises.
---
How the fuck did you cast 100 spells lmfao
---
How is Sous-Chef confusing? It works like this, for example: Arcane Intellect, which draws (2) cards, will draw (3) if you have spell damage +1
---
at 5 unless ti stats are buffed it still wouldnt be veyr good.
---
akali then 7maybe or slightly slower stats but 5/5 at 8 is way to weak. And cannon barraga no ti wont, control/combo decks ot a ton of aoe's and pirates aretn that hard to clear and even then what would odd rogue cut for a unreliable finisher(isnt guaranteed to hit ) and at 6mana escpially with preper nerf its garbage tier in wild. Odd rogu wouldnt run it(escpailly not 2) fungal mancer would be better in most sitation and itsnt even really core for the deck.
---
And in general pirates are quite eays to kill,and dont have million feloads and board buffs murlocs have(lik(bloodlust,scargil,finja,the quest,megasaur,warleader,old lurk eye, angler,seer giving hp,soul of murloc protecting agaisnt aoe,anyfin can happen,evryfin is awsome,tip the scalse,o,r sea devil stinger from warlock))) cannon barrage wouldnt be a issue at all in wild.,) murlocs got way betetr support,and are harder to clear then pirates and got betetr finishers then cannon barrage would be even at 5mana.
---
and if it eventually would become a issue so what? can just put at 6again. its digital game afterall. its cetainly better then not buffing it a really weka underused card even before prep nerf, if pirates get way to eb super sticky and constantly reload/create new pirates then we will talk about cannon barrage being a issue . Cause currently it wouldnt be at all.
---
and rumble bauncer  the buff makes it not garbage never gonna even considere it out of evolve decks, but a option against aggro(like oddpally for decks/Classes that dont have much or any real aoe)and fo that sue it needa  buff,it still would good for evolve decks and be a option otuside them as its a really weak card a lot worse second rate bruiser)
---
Husam is beatable but still kinda dumb.
---
Banker is extremely strong in wild with DK Uther.
---
It's still horribly bad design. Imagine getting Ra/The Ancient One (to a way lesser extent, since it has to survive a turn, but even then it must be dealt with via Polymorph/Assassinate type effects) or maybe getting a 2/2 treant and kel'thusad's cat
---
I understand the point in linking the post is to address exactly this, but the hero power/other similar things for quests/other similar cards really should just be included in this image somehow.
---
Sorcerer's Apprentice and Echo
---
Yea I crafted leeroy, ty
---
For sure. Good luck and have fun
---
OTK pally isn't so common in the meta. It's fun too
---
What about polymorph? Turn a minion into two sheep? 
---
Frost Nova? Shadowform? Mirror entity? Heavy metal? Crushing walls? Call of the wild? Shadow word: death? Charge? Noble sacrifice?
---
Agreed, it's almost the worst design imaginable
---
Does that work with single player content?
---
Sn1p lock is probably the #1 deck, but other than that, I can’t think of any other meta deck that’s consistently better than Odd Rogue in the right hands (Secret Mage is very overrated). It’s definitely close to the #1 spot. I agree that Cannon Barrage won’t fit into Odd Rogue, and I also agree that Hooktusk shouldn’t be 7 mana.
---
For almost all functional purposes, a card costing 1.5 mana is just a going to be a weak to mana card, a 2.5 mana card is going to be a weak three mana card, and so on.
---
It really won't add much if anything to the game other than creating a whole bunch of weak cards that only become slightly better when you're playing a deck full of them.
---
Man.  I can't even play effectively on one server.  I can't imagine trying to play and maintain three separate accounts.  I'm mostly in it for the single player content now--I only play against people if I have to get gold (such as to unlock wings).
---
Well don’t leave us in suspense.

Yeah I agree with you there. Nothing wrong with healthy scepticism.

Huh, thumbs up to Blizz for the rapid response

---
I could barely stay in rank 17 with big paladin in standard. Same deck in wild got me to rank14. People are just more willing to play stupid shit in wild than in standard. I suppose it's because if you sacrifice the dust to keep up with the standard rotation, you actually want to win games.
---
While in standard I have met secret paladins (ok that was me) patron warriors and all sort of not really working anymore decks.
---
What? Is there a phase 3?
---
Funnily enough, control warrior doesnt lack quality 1-2 drops anyway. If it was 1/3 however it'd be borderline broken?
---
Ah Yes
---
The decks that play giants on 4 are rather limited early game, and aren't big of a threat until the big turns come. Face them a lot? Play midrange or aggro. 
---
Quests.. Druid and shaman are good with those, and  both are quite beatable. The other quests are mediocre at best.
---
The fact it has a higher winrate in legend than it does at rank 10 sorta proves what he is saying

1/1/2 | Has +2 Attack while you have a Mech.

Yeah, priest is mostly based on healing/divine spirit+inner fire in most decks.

I've used your guides for pretty much everything since dungeon run. They are always top tier.

Uh oh, not a christian so Im not educated on biblical quotes :/

...I posted this comment 3 days ago right when the brawl hit. Mech Hunter is just what I used. Like I said, one and done.
---
I’m not a Christian either, but I think it was either Jesus or a saint who didn’t perform miracles on command because it would be a “vulgar display of power”
---
Well, overshadowed for a damn good reason since we got a bonkers card like Radiance, amiright? Aimiright??
---
Sure, no reason to keep playing if you don't want to. Personally I haven't played a brawl this much since.....well since the previous build a block brawl. I freaking love these things even if they do get "solved" eventually. I haven't played Ladder since it came out and I seriously doubt I will while this is active.
---
gg i was the priest
---
Sounds similar but he definetely isn't lmao
---
Ah I see
---
Dalaran heist definitely does.  I ended up in a lock against the "only take three damage" guy since he'd stolen two of my three elder tagawags.  So each turn had us play a tagawag, clearing the other sides and shuffling them in.  No one would win, but it was a pretty good run and he was boss 7 so I decided to go for turn limit.
---
It took a while, but we did draw and I then fought him again and won.
---
RDU do answer questions but not generic ones. Go to smaller streamers for those and if you managed to find a streamer with a track record of high legend finishes or placings, you should ask them questions when you can.
---
Highlander Hunter, Murloc Shaman, Control and Aggro Warrior are tier 1-2 decks favoured versus Combo Priest

Good post. Short and sweet, since I joined discord

btw legend in this meta doesn't mean much in terms of skill but gz i guess

Yeah I completely agree. RDU and the other big streamers do the best they can and explain their plays, Ive just found a lot of success with smaller streamers because they can dive into it more without having to keep up with chat.

I mean, you can get it to work (with luck and if RNGsus decides to give you the secret card picks...), but usually in order to get it online you need to stall quite a bit; it doesn't come early enough in a match to actually help you win.

well the thing is animation time shouldn't be the way you nerf a card that's busted or remove otk potential, that's not how hearthstone has ever operated

---
sorry when i reread it, it sounds pretty disrespectful but i didn't mean it that way
---
No no I get it! Trust me I know I have a ton left to learn, and expect the ladder to get more competitive with the changes to GM, but figured I’d try and help out someone else who might be stuck.

what i don't like about the snip snap bans is that you're essentially using time per turn to nerf a card which isn't fair
---
no card has ever been nerfed solely by animation time to limit otk combos and time has never been a factor to balancing cards or even part of the game (only exception is nozdormu)
