Welp, first adventure I won’t buy. Really tired of the dungeon run like content. Peace!

---
---
4 20 blaze it
---
Completely agree, there is just so much synergy with almost all beast cards, I particularly love playing a dire frenzied timber wolf with a discounted tundra rhino, trading into my opponents taunts and watching their reaction when I play a 2 mana spell that ends the game. It is also insane with Deathstalker Rexxar. Played a lot of games where my opponent conceded after me reviving two powerful zombeasts. It just gives hunter so much more board presence and forces the opponent to continually play around it if they know it's in your deck.
---
Yoi get the 16 packs for beating the solo adventure. Buy it, it's a good deal
---
Gee I wonder why they rotated Old Murk Eye
---
You get a legendary and a card back for spending an extra $5
---
Yeah, in wild, its even better! I use it with the plague of locusts to help pop the wuest and then hero power. A lot of value in the card
---
Lack of innovation
---
Yeah well my dad owns Blizzard.
---
I don't understand people like this who add you after a game and then are just rude or idiotic. It's not like their life depended on HS. Just move on to the next game.
---
Yeah thats the joke, I dont own shirvallah, but if I let hs autofill me an empty paladin Deck, he still tries to build me the Deck. Which Makes no Sense obviously
---
Good friend eh. Noob. I have an uncle
---
This game is a joke now
---
The issue is that people have different play styles and you can apply a similar argument of being helpless to every archetype. 
---

---
“I don’t like control since all they ever do is remove your board constantly. I literally can’t do anything to push damage since it’s always removed. And then they just draw their win condition eventually and it’s just a shitty, drawn out match where I had no chance.”
---
“I don’t like aggro, no matter how many times you clear everything they keep pushing face. It’s a fucking mindless deck and you never get to stabilize since they always kill you before that point.”
---
Yeah well my uncle owns the internet. Say bye to Reddit. You think you can post here? Think again, degenerate!
---
All I've played since Uldum launched is 4 different versions of Battlecry Shaman. I'm still 2 legendaries off of making Highlander Hunter and 1 Legendary off of Highlander Mage so even a month later,  Battlecry Shaman is the only fun deck I've got.
---
The higher your rank the more people will play around your stuff, and there will be fewer  misplays
---
Inb4 opponent plays Millhouse manastorm as a pharosis tech.
---
Fifa gameplay  has been the same since 94 and i don't see them complaining.
---
No, more, my Rogue deck for example was a kingsbane/c'thun deck. Block my c'thun buildup and kingsbane ramps, block my kingsbane ramp and my c'thun shoots up
---
Literally Unplayable.
---
done
---
It’s a known interaction but not something I’d expect anyone knew to figure out without experiencing it lol. I only know because I used to play thief rogue. If you use a hero card from another class, rogue cards will increase the durability of spectral cutlass as well. :)
---
You realize The Caverns Below was nerfed twice right both times shortly after the card proved to be decent, right?
---
Pirate Warrior quickly fell out of prominence after the release of Un'Goro.
---
Depending on how the buckets work, the dual class stuff could lead to some interesting deck building especially if you have taverns
---
Same. It took about 10 minutes for me thofh
---
Didn’t work but thanks for the suggestion :/
---
It would have been great if they had doubled down on the choose ones even further.
---
Hero Power - "Choose one - Your Choose One minions have both effects combined this turn; Your Choose One spells have both effects combined this turn."
---
Good luck fitting that into the text box though.
---
Yea very fun game. You must REALLY think so to have spent thousands though lol.
---
And it still dominated even being neferd twice.  That's the kind a deck mages never get.
---
It goes away after a while. Happened to me during preorder
---
It got nuked and like a roach it rose from the radation alive and kicking.  No mage deck has ever survived a nerf, much less multipul.
---
Not the hero we need but the hero was deserve.
---
I think you must have fallen and knocked a few memories loose.
---
Even after being nerfed twice it was still dominante.  The only thing that saved us was it rotating out.
---
I've had this happen to me. Worst part is you think you're gonna win by that point so the defeat is all the more crushing
---
No? All are seeing play on some competitive level. Brann and Finley are \*very\* good, and Elise and Reno are just plain good. All see play, though. Don't know what you're on about.
---
I thought Hakkar was cool when I first "obtained" it but I've been too lazy to change it out lol.
---
Also I don't have many cardbacks since I don't play HS that much, just started getting the ranked chest every month. I really wish I could still get some of the cute pink/purple cardbacks like Exodar, or the Rainbow cardback, or the goofy ones like Pizza. At least Suramar is gorgeous though.
---
If you read my post you would have saw I mentioned freeze mage, yet you reply as if  I didnt.
---
&gt; Tempo mage got dabbed on by cube lock 
---
Cube Warlock was a great match-up for Tempo Mage. Tempo Mage from that time only consistently lost against decks faster than it.
---
&gt;Now compare those decks to Quest rogue, cube lock, pirate warrior, patron warrior, Shudderwalk shaman, Jade druid, big priest. 
---
And? Mage has occupied tier one just as often as about every other class. Granted, various mage decks could beat each of those pretty consistently other than Pirate Warrior and maybe Jade Druid.
---
Firebat boosted the numbers
---
Control Warrior is strong tho
---
No my memory is correct.  I never saw mages once I hit rank 10 on the climb to legendary.  Mages were trash compared to jade druid.
---
A deck isnt good if you dont see it played in tourneys, or past rank 5.
---
I use Whizbang and I groaned when it first gave me a Quest Hunter deck. Now, I’m more than thrilled when I get it! 
---
It’s easier than you think to complete when you finish it off with Unleash the Hounds and then hit the HP for the win!
---
This guy gets it.
---
Still no suspension or contact from Blizzard.
---
Your username is oddly relevant though
---
I mean we were told it will do it’s best to find lethal... just happened to find lethal for your opponent lol
---
I came back today. Got my butt handed to me in wild, and when I added players after game to ask them about the new combos I’ve seen them pull off got nothing but toxicity.
---
Just stay away if you’re gone. I deleted the app and will find something else to occupy my free time at work.
---
Not applicable. Besides I've been playing off and on since launch, probably wouldve happened before now
---
The monthly rewards is different. Other than that, i personally dun feel much different between them...
---
Quest Priest above 50% win rate?
---
Hold my beer.
---
It would fall in line with every WoW xpac. Both sides have their own thing going on while battling the other side until they have to team up to take on a greater enemy.
---
Control Warrior: A troubled orc finds himself trapped in a snoozefest by a mysterious goblin. Will he be able to give this neverending story a new ending?
---
For me it's the worst since i have most of the legendapries from that expansion thats being used in the meta so paying it with money doesnt feel all too attractive to me
---
Blizzard keeps nerfing/removing mill in standard
---
The answer is clear
---
You've got the best deals anywhere!
---
Cuz burgle is tier 1
---
Costs twenty I get it...
---
So he would still not show pyro even with pre-prep?
---
[Most recent Beginner's Guide which includes some starter deck advice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bisn5q/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_dragon/)
---
Overload(2)
---
If you don't have fillers, you will quickly realize that the meta becomes insanely stale.
---
Burgle synergy cards. Fencer, vendetta, and especially Tess woukd be complete bricks in mirror matches.
---
Choose one - Your choose one cards choose one of the choose one options chosen in the previous game; you become the chosen one and must choose one other person to help you choose one bottle of wine for your best friend's choose one party.
---
That's a really bad argument. If u/hiimsubclavian shipped a literal $200 flaming turd of a comment, is it still a fair comment?
---
Like you said, if someone is enjoying the flaming turd then its worth it. If you like flaming turds keep playing it. If it triggers you and makes you salty stop playing it. Its pretty simple
---
Was that better?
---
The deck is only made up of spells, so unless some minions have been shuffled in there through the course of the game there is nothing for recruit and like effects to pull out
---
Don't think there are minions in the deck. Nothing for you to pull out.
---
You mean my $2000 collection of pretend cards? Definitely worth the .50c a day to grind the 80 gold I'd not get myself...
---
Yea and 2 of my main decks had him as a pretty important component
---
They said they are going to print cards with "from another class" instead of your "opponents class" in the future. Why haven't they changed cards to mirror this design choice? The dev team seems to be really discontent on changing cards from previous expansions, I imagine because you would get dust refunds (making bliz less money) and if they didn't give them out there probably would be mass outrage.
---
Just have some fun, drink some sodey pop, play some new interesting decks. : )
---
If you read every card the video will become very long (obviously not reading duplicates). I think more people would enjoy only reading the epics and legendaries.
---
Nice
---
That's only the 80$ expac pre-purchase. As if they would sell them to you for 1/4 of the price again...
---
Rouge Plauge?
---
Probably because it was auto set when obtained, and the majority of people just didn't bother changing it after that.
---
I'm at a loss here. If you don't expect to win, than why are you saying p2w?
---
Have a nice day :)
---
But... but... you spelled it wrong. It's Zephrys ;\*
---
I think it's more of a "riss" than a "reese", at least regarding Zephrys
---
Nobody can afford to play control warrior in the main sub. So we couldn't take such screenshots unless our opponent is a p2wscum. f2pbtw
---
Hi there Logik\_Hawk, I'm Account\_Bro! I'd just like to quickly verify your email and password before we move on. Is that OK?
---
"No room for creativity" - motto for the next expansion :) I feel sorry for you being downvoted. I created this topic to highlight the problem, Druid lovers think I can't win against them.
---
If you preorder now, first you have to wait for the solo content to be available than you have to wait almost 1 more month for rest of the wings available to get all packs.
---
This is not like exp preorders where you open your packs first day of the exp where most decks are playable.
---
Dont know your collection or how competitive you are, so I cant comment more specificy but there are build around cards in SoU if you think you can hit one go for it or dont
---
Oh shut the fuck up already.
---
Everyone knows it's a dungeon run style adventure.
---
God I love having some brian
---
Zilax can't "save" you from 2 5/5's like siamat does, but it disincentivizes making small trades into it because the more attacks you have to put into ziliax, the more you heal back. Lifesteal and taunt basically mesh very well with eachother, making non-minion damage or silence much more important to deal with it.
---
I feel like that rule is kind of silly unless you post their account number as well. I'm sure there's at least a couple thousand people with the name "Unruly", y'know? Maybe I'm an idiot, though. :)

I was struggling against him, too. Somehow my friend who agreed to help me beat him in the first try. He used secrets that change enemy's attack direction, and burned Kingsbane by playing cards into Fel Reaver.

Sadly I do not own Thaurissan nor do I have the dust for him at the moment. Is he necessary?

Yes but it just refuses to kill anything, so I built a deck around it :P
---
&gt;It's a wild meme deck

Except is weirdly viable

Ya fuck warrior
---
Why didn't you put that in the opening post, instead of shit posting?

Hey, that's illegal!

nah I am gonna talk pretty much beck ppl like u r destroying the game stupid fuck
---
I've been around since the beginning, and I was not able to afford the new expansion SoU, but I've bought all the other ones.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It just wasn't worth it, knowing I'd be lucky if I got 3 Legendary cars from 50 packs, it just isn't worth it.   
---
I know Sales were down with the explorers bundle released so early after expansion.
---
Playing both sides to maximize karma. Very impressive.
---
There are certain things that the AI won't do. For example it won't attack taunts if they are gonna be revived with Kel Thuzad unless they can kill him same turn. Just this week I had the endboss Gallywix not attack my taunted Mechanical Welp because it would have spawned 2 Dragons.
---
Those things are fun to discover and you need any advantage you can against unfair bosses.
---
my average sorry for not defining it properly average dust I get from packs
---
Post it on comedy heaven
---
everytime someone says "ryt" instead of "right", I expect very low intelligence
---
PLEASE share your decklist, I need some inspiration. I tried building a control quest Mogu rogue as well but that was TERRIBLE (and I crafted tak for it, f2p btw). It was fun while it lasted though. This actually sounds a lot better, I have to admit.
---
The last example here, Blademaster, has "odd" capitalization because it's a worded for new players. The first time you see a card injure itself, it seems strange and bad. The hundredth time you understand why and how it can be useful.
---
No, your average is about 100. Stop the fucking circlejerk.
---
I guess you were right
---
I wrote it ryt now sigh
---
Yes. This set has a lot of cool legendaries and packs are packs so really it’s “do I want an excuse to buy those.”
---
It’ll mean I have a crap ton of gold and dust for a while though...hopefully they don’t have a cool skin next expansion lol.
---
I will fuck ur mom in her ass and sump her in garbage bin so stfu up now or else it won't be good for u

I'm sure you did. Since it took you all of 30 seconds to type it out. 😂

It's in every game, having an optional "Chat With Opponent" option at the end of a match would be interesting.

But he didn't.

Besides, I only played it when I had lethal

Super Bang Bros
---
I think the burgle cards as well as the quest are exactly what this type of deck needed. It supplies several options for removal and it also makes the deck a lot more fun to play. I played it myself and I’m having a blast. If it weren’t for rng I’d say this deck could be close to meta changing! Thank you for helping me with this :)
---
Pretty easy to complete.
---
We'll never know...
---
I automatically Squelch my opponent, so emotes don't matter.  
---
I never accept friend requests because I have no need for friends in HS.  My wife plays, so we can easily complete any quests that need friends.  Other than that, friends aren't really of any use in this game.
---
Thats what I said though. If people want packs, they better buy them alone and not buy the pve preorder bonus. If someone wants the pve, they either buy it alone, or with the preorder bonus that includes packs, or they simply pay with ingame gold.
---
But saying the pve preorder is bad JUST by analicing the dollar per pack ratio is wrong.
---
Could play quest rogue with a stupid bounce target of Amalgam.

What do you mean resurrect through a spell? Like Mass Resurrection? If yes, that also triggers Juggler.
---
A minion is summoned any time it appears on your side of the board, no matter from where / how. And all of them trigger Juggler.
---
*your opponent* : i think i'm gonna play-
---
*You* : no
---
You’re obviously right. Sometimes I just rope for fun
---
Around 120 I guess.
---
&gt; you need to remember that "filling your board" counts as "summoning" as in it will trigger [[Knife Juggler]]. 
---
I'm sorry, but is there any instance when putting a new minion on board doesn't count as summoning?
---
nah ur justa washed up fan boy ur wrong
---
I like this.
---
Yea man unfortunately he's probably a must need. I've played him a handful of times and Everytime he made a huge impact. Usually sumo hand first go face and drop him and opponent will concede.
---
And that mosquito is Blizzard
---
It's bizzare how lacking the cosmetic customization is in the game given its F2P nature. More cosmetics could also be given as ranked wins rewards beyond 500 wins.

Who tf has a water bowl just laying around?

Full rag would be if there were a live, angry tiger there too, but you hit the mosquito anyways.

If you think that then this conversation is pointless. I agree with you, if to be considered powerful in wild a card needs to be in t1 decks then finley isn't powerful, but neither is any neutral legendary except patches and loatheb.
---
LIke taver brawls? Or does TB get the same cards as yout collection?
---
Yeah, I have the same feeling. They seem pretty pointless except for showing off to your opponent. But I guess most cosmetics in other games are the same way.
---
&gt; would also not affect the power level of evolve mechanics in shaman/other classes since they don’t use mana cheating except in the case of Mogu flesh shaper.
---
How about the wild evolve decks?
---
You have to wait for it
---
Tirion isn't so necessary. Any other big finishing minion. He's nice to have to protect your smaller minions or help with tempo to get board control back. 
---
As for sir Finley he's really what gives you tempo and
---
Just give us more events Blizz lol. It's unbelievable how they managed to skimp out on events this year when even the years before were nothing special compared to other F2P mobile games.
---
I originally had thought about this as a Tavern Brawl that gives access to a full collection, and it still could be implemented this way, but I decided to represent it as a general event idea.
---
You never go full Murloc...
---
Buddy read carefully. It states for golden cards section :) You are welcome for that $5 legendary.
---
Agreed, but I think the flavor of the card itself is part of the reason that the text is worded that way.
---
He DOES scream "argh... MEDIC!!!!!"
---
decklist?
---
Maybe he played all classes equal amount of time, warrior games just take so long he can play any other classes 4 times per warrior game.
---
That's the one thing that annoys me: if you want to bitch and vent, I'm fine with that, but if you're going to use me as a punching bag, have the fucking decency to hear what I have to say it response.
---
If they land somewhere where you don't have much fat you can tense the muscle and they can't retract their needles. Then you don't have to be quick to squash them. Hell use a tissue if you want. You got as long as you can keep the skin tense enough.
---
How would a predatory wasp pollinate? Its not going to spend much time on flowers.
---
Yeah, it's like a mistake you might make once or twice, and then you figure it out. Should Mad Summoner's card text say "Fill each board with 1/1 imps, by the way this counts as you summoning the imps on your side if the board and your opponent summoning the imps on their side of the board"? Summoning means a minion appearing your side of the board, pretty simple.
---
I laughed way too hard at this.
---
No, Mage is always \*picked\* a lot.
---
For it to be offline they would have to bring some amount of source code right into your pc. There are shitload of bad things that could happen if they did that.
---
This is not a no brainer fix. This is not safe for them.
---
You're basically saying you play HS for yourself to enjoy and should not be held accountable for any type of use of the game as long as it's not breaking the policy/rules. It's fine and you're obviously free to do so, but it's an inherently individualistic POV.
---
There's a community that is indispensable to you enjoying or even playing the game and you are part of that community. Many people who achieved HS basics (hitting LEG; 12 arena win; golden heroes) are quitting because, with Blizz 1. not reconsidering the ladder system; 2. not adding new modes &amp; 3. doing nothing against polarization, the other only thing that can keep you checking in is FUN!  
---
Past R5 you SYSTEMATICALLY run into metadecks and go through more or less the same turns each game.  
---
WHERE'S FUN!
---
I wonder when is it that people are gonna stop being individualistic and rather think:   
---
I am playing HS for myself AND for other people to enjoy, since I AM other people.
---
I believe a collectivist society in which our minds deeply grasp the importance of us being one entity will lead to a world-wide revolution against the financially bought politicking oligarchy.
---
I would have laughed if the secret was Repentance (reduced creatures health to one).  Although now that I work it through you could have just Bees'ed his minions.
---
I don't like either wording on the middle one.  should just say (minimum 1)
---
\&gt;&gt; Oaken Summons and Psychopomp

T E C H
---
Highlander Mage is built around a ton of value cards which can generate other cards. Making your hand size pretty big. Which is why Mountain Giant works.
---
Quest Shaman is essentially a token deck that relies heavily on lackeys for board control. Which is why Mogu makes sense in that deck.
---
Well, patches is à pirate :P
---
Or it could have something to do with the fact that WoW classic just released and seems to be peaking at Twitch right now?
---
Not sure how you'd Cheat it out. If you think any 1-Cost minion with Battlecry will work you can attempt it with the Sludge Slurper that's in your hand and see that it does not work.
---
hearthstone is based on warcraft and wow
---
Wish I had seen this earlier, logged on and only got the quest pack but not the legendary :(
---
That's exactly what he just said. Blizzard can release an expansion for 300 dollars and you can both say "That's pretty stupid" and not buy it. Except in this case you still get to play the game and slowly grind your way to having the whole game.
---
Then that's kind of a shitty wording from blizzard
---
Keep the downvotes coming you little fucking cunts
---
I approve of this message and your initial post. 10/10 would shitpost agane
---
Well I guess you need to improve your english my boy. Good luck with that! :)
---
And say goodbye to your legendary!

---
Thanks combcombo, that's great to hear! I'll hopefully have an early version of the platform up by October, so stay tuned!
---
Get used to that.
---
Maybe a "fly mechanic" which allows the minions to float above the battlefield and bypass taunts. (Maybe even dodge certain AOE effects).
---
Could add a new level of strategy to the game.
---
No this guy is wrong. $5 legendary is much better than 5 packs in average.
---
In this case, very very shitty wording
---
Wouldn’t that require you to play out your 8 mana murlocs?
---
Lol projection much?
---
Patron was a deck with no legendaries (aside from thaurissan, which you needed to get grim patron already) that could be the best deck of the meta if played correctly. Cheapest top deck ever. 
---
After warsong commander got nerfed it ran Grom and Dr. Boom as it’s only leggos so it got a bit more expensive, but those were both really good crafts. 
---
Pirate warrior was cheap as well, only legendary was Leeroy, which is a crazy good craft also. Finley was from league of explorers so I consider him to not be a legendary since you didn’t need to craft/open him.
---
Wow, you're gonna be embarassed when you ever come around to reading it!

Bit more info (spoilers below, obviously):

- After you beat Finley, Sir Finley of the Sands gets added to your deck.

- Next challenge after Finley is Brann.  Guessing the singleton League cards all get added to your deck, something to keep in mind when strategizing.

Anyone know if finishing the Brawl gets an additional reward?

I wish there was more to play for, 2 packs is great and all don’t get me wrong but I don’t have any motivation to play that much of this
---
thanks for the update, u/joemag_HS
---
say u/czihong , you may want to edit your top-note to reflect this info
---
Completely understandable. I normally don't check the website, ever.
---
I really don't like how they edit these animations.  Looks so bad, like a couple static images being panned.

Again, if you get unlucky. You’re not always going to draw Grizzly or Blessing of the Ancients. If everything doesn’t align, you’re going to have 2 8/8’s pounding your face in while you’re struggling to stick a minion on the board for longer than 2 turns.
---
I think it wasn't great, got 2 mechathun wins out of the 7 wins, for a 50% winrate at rank 5. The other games I won were due to a good early Murloc curve. Subdue kinda messes with Prismatic Lens and you need a few too many turns to play all your cards.
---
Cool fucking story
---
Like Hero Cards' Hero Powers
---
Don’t wasps compete with bees for territory?
---
They usually run through the last day.
---
Well, your opinion on the matter differs from what Team 5 feels should be the case. 
---
Using Mutate on a Mogu Fleshshaper is a strong play, but it is ultimately conditional in when it can really happen with a random result. Summoning a random eight drop and dealing three damage to a minion at the cost of two cards in hand around turn five or six really is not busted.
---
Again, only one of the Evolve-styled effects has ever come close to breaking the game, Conjurer's Calling. That card has been dealt with, and until the mechanic itself is consistently causing issues, it is fine to function as it currently is.
---
Then why is anyone fucking surprised by the outcome? It's like leaving Thaurrisan up and wondering why you get shit stomped
---
Can we get a netflix series with these four? Please and thank you.
---
No one is surprised by the outcome, just the misfortune of facing a double Brann in Arena.
---
As long as your quests align with Druid class/cards, Priest Cards, or general play it is a good spot to do quests.
---
gg dude, but you missed lethal about 4 times, and that highroll of a hero power has broken me as a person. Luckily, I believe in karma and as such am looking forward to my reward for this event. I wish you well in your future games, but my rage cannot be sated by man nor beast.

No playing is allowed

-Secret mage, probably
---
Hero Power + Attack 7/8 + Savagery on Zephrys = 12 Northshire Draws.
---
Probably more with some Floop + Bees on 7/8 + Elise.
---
Why doesn't blizz "fix" these things? Because they are absolutely inconsequential and only the most petty and picky of people have issues with them. They have no impact on the game whatsoever, and blizz shouldn't waste 5 minutes on it.
---
Because the opponent managed to draft both Branns, draw both of them and play Dinotamer while the other was on the board while having no duplicates in his deck. That's not really to be expected.
---
there are enough games where you can "upload" your archivements and get rewards after that.
---
Only publisher who wanna save money dont provide that.
---
Mortal kombat at switch has the same issue. Its pathetic when people pay so much money and need that still Online to play sth.
---
That's mostly due to the fact that they actually ARE a couple static images being panned.
---
Did you read the original comment in the thread? It was about how the guy had 3 mana left, which meant Brann went down the turn before. We're not talking about double Brann, that's in the fucking title.
---
Lucky, or you hit the pity timer (you're guaranteed to hit a legendary for every 40 packs of an expansion to get, so if you were at 39 packs with no legendary, the 40th is guaranteed).
---
Followed. 
---
Wild main, always welcome wild streamers.
---
Yep. Exactly.
---
My Sylvanas Windrunner took control of the sand and despite the boss not having any he remained invulnerable so I had to concede.
---
I get what you're saying, and the vast majority would agree, hence the response to my comment being pretty negative.  But at the same time I honestly think that this kind of mentality is one that society would be better off dropping, and being capable of taking the higher road.  Vengeance is fun and feels great but in the end you're still an asshole for "Spitting on someone," "Stealing someone's lunch," or taking spite on your neighbor.  Geez, why is this concept so negatively conceived online.  The opposing toddler mentality assuming that being a good person doesn't make me feel as good as being as rude as the one who slighted me, and therefore I shouldn't do it.  People online are horrible, including me for taking the time to explain that being a dick makes you a dick regardless of the other factors.  I can't believe reddit is arguing that you shouldn't be a good person because rude people exist.  It boggles my mind how people can think that it's justified when blown out of inconsequential proportions.

So you essentially want to see what differences two decks have?
---
You could use [yaytears.com/specialist](https://yaytears.com/specialist) 
---
Note: this tool is not designed for this, but it kind of works. You can easily see the differences between decks. You need to have three decks, but you can just put one twice if you are only comparing two. Also, it for some reason doesn't work with wild decks.
---
True, dragon priest was a decent mid-range deck that didn't really benefit from the combo.  It also almost solely existed off the back of draconic op.  Plus the deck didn't cycle very well, and instead generated it's value.  I absolutely concede my argument about there not being a reason not to run the combo.  I will still argue that it existing hurts the class more than it helps.
---
Just thought I would try from the beginning.  Thanks!
---
In my experience yes, but I had some good luck with The Muscle and good mulligans
---
Not a first time when Sylvanas ruins storyline.
---
Looks like you don't play Shirvallah Paladin much. Control Warrior is at worst a 40/60 matchup and most pros agree that it is close to 50/50.
---
Unfriend - ASAP!
---
Ok but do you think that guy should lose out on potentially hundreds of dollars hes put into tue game because of a name trick people have been using for decades? Seems excessive and honestly, I dont see why a username should be taken so serious
---
Have you played any of the dungeon run style solo adventures? The new adventure will be like that. The rewards will be packs of the latest set but less total than the adventure will cost (you'd get more spending the same amount of money or gold to buy packs directly). 
---
If you like the dungeon style adventures this will be a good purchase, otherwise just buy packs. 
---
The latest set is higher power than some sets recently, and has some fun and interesting mechanics.
---
Posted before, and Im pretty sure the hero has an "aura" that makes him invincible if a sand on board, much like how you couldnt silence an old rogue quests 4/4s
---
So you don't use prismatic lens? Do run tip the scales? Hell...do you have a list?
---
Exactly. He looks at the board, health, handsize (mountain giant), and decksize...I'm fairly certain. But he does not look at individual minions or cards effects (besides doomsayer). So it's understandable that he wasn't offered circle of healing, not because he didn't didn't see opponents decksize but because he doesn't understand clerics effect.
---
Is it only me or anyone else is getting bored of this "dungeon run" stuff? It is not that satisfying anymore. I will get pissed if Tombs of Terror offer you the same buffs as we had through previous expansions.
---
we did it boys. we ended bad sportsmanship
---
He would do anyfin for love
---
Horribly.
---
I guess the code works like this:
---
&gt;If Sand is on the board, give your hero immunity that is removed upon the Sand's Deathrattle.
---
It's some kind of aura effect that automatically applies to the hero whenever it is on the board, and is only removed by deathrattle.
---
Any tips on beating the final boss ? What to build/pick
---
Looking at deck size is just to not bother giving you draw if you are out of cards. It's not calculating how to fatigue or mill your opponent.
---
Yeah I rolled the last boss but only because I had the reduce to 5 cost card and the left most card costs 2 less card. Very hard final battle without good treasures and passives
---
There was that brief glorious moment when control N'zoth rogue was viable. 
---
I understand it was miserable for everyone else but the mirror matches were amazingly entertaining
---
Well, the most important thing is to know what class you're going for. Another thing to consider is that if you're f2p or on a budget, you'll probably want cards that won't rotate for a while. Furthermore, I recommend you start with the best neutral legendaries:
---
-Siamat - in standard for a good amount of time, very strong card to help close out the midgame, a 6/6 Rush Divine Shield is really good, fits in a lot of decks.
---
-Zilliax - rotating fairly soon, but he's so powerful that I recommend him anyways. He just does some of everything 
---
-King Phaoris - lategame card that can pretty easily build a giant board that wins you the game if your opponent can't clear it. Great way to close out a game 
---
-Zephrys - Every single class except Priest has experimented with Highlander decks, because this card is just so strong. Definitely worth crafting.
---
-Archivist Elysiana - excellent card in control decks, just a good thing to have in your collection
---
-Malygos - staying in standard forever, and there's almost always a viable Malygos combo deck. Not necessarily Tier 1, but usually Tier 2 or 3, and it's a very consistent centerpiece card. (Elise Malygos Druid is pretty good right now)
---
Tell me which class you plan on playing a lot and I can tell you more
---
How do you get that hero
---
Help me understand. You found out about this deck, obviously knowing what cards go into it and how it's played. It's a relatively cheap deck and, if you've played for a while, you should have most of the cards necessary. So you craft a couple legendaries and get going only to realize "Oh shit, my win condition is based on RNG", then you proceed to blame Blizzard.
---
You're about as braindead as that deck you crafted, chief.
---
Ok, most of the legendaries aren't played or very good anyways, probably not missing out on much.
---
No I just stopped feeding the troll.  No constructive communication could come from responding any further
---
Hey can I dm you on what I got in my collection ? Also, yes I’m a kinda F2P player but I did spend a few bucks when frozen throne was around because it looked son cool.
---
He was the clowning jerk of the LoE that touched things he shouldn't have in the museum.  He gets one shotted as a scoundrel in One Night in Karazhan.  He's the Jar Jar of the bunch.
---
I'm finding Highlander Hunter to be pretty fast and consistently good. It it's a rather expensive deck though so do with that what you will.
---
cg, i get 2x 40 dust
---
Yeah, KoFT was an awesome expansion. Anyways, go ahead
---
You probably want to run him in token druid too because of the nice buff potential, but honestly that deck is like tier 4 right now.
---
We gonna see blackrock mountain vs league of evil and explorers. And get a Naxxramas 2 tease for next year.
---
oooooh yeah, that would be good.  matches the event's themes. and I started playing like 3 months after that, so I would love to add it
---
maybe, IDK.  Reno's already down as a Mage/Rogue tho
---
That was the worst experience for a first run I've had yet in a dungeon run. A token deck with a bunch of 1 up minions against a 1 damage board clear with no buffs. Who the fuck thought that would be fun.
---
Found another way to dodge the name question, I'm impressed. Mods should delete this shitpost because you're right, there was nothing constructive here from the start. There was no offensive name, you just wanted attention because your feelings were hurt right?
---
I filled my board with wisps and Krush died because he hit face and there was no board slot left for him to switch to.
---
ALRIGHT so I didn't know people had posted this before, sorry 'bout that. Still think it's an odd little interaction
---
This should not be posted here
---
I only had 1 open space. I got the first quest. Did I miss out on the second one?
---
If you had just shared the name, maybe you would have gotten some help. But instead you decided to dodge the question, threaten me, call me a troll, and just be an ass all around.
---
Fuck you Aiyao FuuuuUUuck youu!!
---
A neutral weapon would break the game honestly.
---
It was. Anymore complaints?
---
if there is sand finley is still buried
---
Eh.  I dropped murloc paladin pretty fast myself.
---
In the Brawlsoleum I was able to get 6ish average wins with a deck I already had, tried a few runs of murloc paladin and went like...3-3 and 2-3.  Switched back to a more reliable deck.
---
Like...yeah, it can win sometimes?  But it also loses to itself sometimes.
---
I fail to understand the attempt of sarcasm, please elaborate
---
The keyword was explained half way. New players would be confused af

I was expecting that, and I was not disappointed

GLove#1360 NA trading 80g quest.  I show, you go first.

Mechathun has a deathrattle where if you have no cards in hand and deck you win when it dies. The skater bot on the left can fuse with the mechathun to let it attack a minion on board. The spell on the right will turn its attack and heath to 1.

Yeah basically there are two parts, piles of sand grant immune but any pile of sand being present still stops you from digging up Finley. Can see how that could be a little confusing.

average  legendary  is 20 packs, not 16-20
---
I see it now! Thanks
---
Double starting health, clear his board so he summons a bunch of imps. AI fucks up and you can slowly chip his health down, it's as fun as it sounds.
---
Okay my guess is this, each wing is one of their artifacts like renos gun and then the last is something huge to stop Dalaran.
---
Hold on, let's not be rash here. This might be the Finley you play *as*, not one of the Finleys you play. So he should have enough health to survive a couple high energy blasts to the face.
---
Yeah completed it was fun, had cards halfed then just put high minions out and he couldn’t deal with them.
---
No, that's not what it means.
---
You can get just the adventure (without the cardback and legendary) in a separate deal later, but only the bundle is available now.
---
Using Galvanizer would have tipped off the Mecha'thun deck and he would have killed OP much earlier.
---
...You don't have to buy both.
---
Yeah, we were indoctrinated during the game monetization class we took in third grade. No one likes the game, anyone who says otherwise is mind controlled by drones.
---
idiOt
---
Literally unplayable
---
Seems unnecessary...if you own a console you own a computer (hearthstone also doesn't require good specs).
---
The game requires like 5 apm and doesn't benefit at all from being on a console. Seems like work for no reward if I owned Blizzard.
---
Didn't you see the sign coming in? Please do not feed the Blizzard!
