It's alphonse elric

In the most recent set, yes. Not older sets though.

Also wouldn't recommend dusting Legendaries unless it's really bad

---
Unless they changed it that's not true. I remember making f2p accounts and you'd always get a legendary in the first 10 packs of every set. Not just the most recent.
---
That drawing looks amazing i love it

I think the same there would be no mechs without him and is funny when u see everyone going for mechs and u know someone will fuck up cuz there won't be more of that guy

JOJOLION

Lol

You can outvalue them if you play the whelp deathrattle
---
And you can outvalue them pretty easily
---
JUST 11

Do you have Aluneth? If not then go Face Hunter in Standard.

Wow

[Ixlid may be useless, but he has given me some great memories with my longneck bois!](https://i.imgur.com/Me05HS1.jpg)
---
He's just refuting the statement that having a ton of viable decks makes a meta good.
---
Having the flexibility to choose any number (1 to 20) when rolling a d20 doesn't make the activity inherently fun or interesting, despite having so many options. In the same way, you can have a lot of viable decks and still end up with the "worst meta".
---
I think one point that he makes that I agree with is Leroy often sets up scenarios where the best play is just hope they don’t have him and if they do, u lose and if they don’t you win. (if u didn’t draw ur counters like taunt). He’s just got janky card design. 6 damage for 5 mana has proven to be slightly game breaking.
---
Are you factoring in that humans are shallow and pathetic, generally speaking?
---
Isn't Gross Gore married with a kid?
---
It’s a really fun card. It’s not as useful as it once was, nor does it really have a place in the meta. Go to hearthstonetopdeck . Com and search for decks with that card. Not saying you gonna destroy the meta, but should have fun in the higher ranks
---
Handbuff Paladin in Wild.
---
For real, can you imagine how successful he will be putting the same amount of effort in any other game/things in general? Competitive cointoss is such a waste of time.
---
Imagine high rolling the poison fish boys as Nefarian lol
---
Full set completion is possible f2p in mtga.  That is not really true in HS, especially not now that they're charging an extra 2k gold for the singleplayer on top of the gold for opening packs.

Umm dude, the pope said that, like this year
---

---
Part VI when?
---
After obtaining a complete classic collection, I’ve stopped opening my weekly TB packs bc it’s likely another Legendary gets rotated and replaced with something new.
---
If I had to guess I’d say Alexstrasza.
---
I could see Elon pulling this off
---
It takes about 24-25k gold to complete a set and buy the PvE.  You get maybe 1k gold from bonus events every expansion, and can get let's say 80g a day from quests and winstreak if you play diligently (so almost 100k per expansion from quests/10g rewards).
---
So you need to farm about 14k gold to get a complete set beyond what your daily quests will get you.  Doing some very rough math on how arena rewards work, you can make 50g an hour playing Arena if you're pretty decent at it (5-3 avg).
---
So, 14k gold at 50g/h is about almost 300 hours.  That's how long you can expect it to take to grind arena for set completion per set.  Sets are 4 months each, so 75 hours a month, or almost 20 hours a week of Arena grinding.  At that point, unless HS is your job, you don't have any time to play with the full set you collected.  Thus, it is not reasonable for an f2p'er to collect a full set of each expansion.
---
You keep all the cards you open in draft in MTGA, which helps a lot with building your collection.  By the time you draft 30 times, if you're smart about it, you'll have half the rares from a set, and you can use your quest earnings, wildcards etc. to finish the rest.
---
How did you pull it off
---
They kinda do, when they're under lethal range and none of the choices can help to prevent it
---
Is this why I'm getting ass fucked currently? Everyone is racing to the finish? For about 2 hours I thought I was getting better. NOPE. back to 20 rank!
---
That's good to hear. Am excited for what is to come. Waiting for the dragons too
---
Lolol right
---
haha idk if everyone is rushing because of season end but i been grinding to get it before the year ends
---
And I explained how OP’s viewpoint is out of context and inaccurate. At that point, you’re supposed to actually respond to what was said. Instead, you went off on this tangent about complaining about complaining. You can’t just claim I’m not considering other viewpoints when you aren’t even addressing the actual relevant discussion.

I would take 2 Chos depending on situation. Very rare I’d take patches over cho.

I feel like he’s part of other horrible trinities, but getting two vanilla 4/4s is far from your worst option here.

Yes, now.

Start of game, not battlecry

It definitely made me come by this sub a lot more. Lots of solid funny memes. Shane it had to end
---
We're aware, but it coincided with a period of time in which most of the moderators won't be spending much time at their PC, and we had to call it something.

Highlander effects require no duplicates, and he was quoting Reno Jackson’s entry line.
---
You’re in dumpster legend right now. It is actually a lot like being at rank 5 but with higher quality players. Although some are trying hard to get into high legend, a lot of them are just playing for fun and messing around with lower tier decks or home brews. Source: someone who is occasionally in top 500 legend but is usually around 1000-1500.
---
Hir'eek and Flik in the same Shudderwock Battlecry seems like it shouldn't go well
---
It's AI, so it is random. Just behaves like when it's casted by Yogg or something.
---
I'm not offended as I'm not a five year old calling someone a noob, but the paladin deck is extreemley annoying just wait until it gains popularity. Also I did not say it's like the rogue deck.
---
r/wooosh

he made the reference because I was playing as Reno

I think around 25 hours from now
---
Kind of ironic, but ok
---
Damn I’m the one who got woooshed
---
I just had a game where I faced the same 2 people all they way until they both died lol. It's completely broken.
---
Personally glad it’s over; memes saturated the sub way too much. I wouldn’t be against weekly meme-threads or specific days of the week where memes are allowed, but the sub was much worse for actual quality content while the event was going on.
---
I'm glad it's over. Can go literally anywhere else where Hearthstone players gather and find endless waves of memes.

Is there a place that shows total games played? I am curious my win percent and top 4 percent.
---
Galakrond-Rogue. Necro-Rogue. Quest-Rogue.
---
And title comes from the fact that I saw how easly facehunter reach rank \~13 in less than two hours. Saw it from different perspectives
---
Honestly, it's not. Heal or armour up like 10, play a strong board control game and, if you're galakrond warrior, you can actually do comparable face damage, while actually setting yourself up in case the game goes past turn 7. It was basically designed to counter prenerf gala shaman, and not much else. It's very easy to tech against, and is pretty much locked into a single deck list with little to no room for variance, so yeah. Let the f2p and new people have this one.
---
The Holy Trinity of 3 1/1s. Patches, Zerus and Chameleos.
---
Down
---
What was your full board that you had mecharoo? 😂
---
How is Rafam HP not 2 gold yet?
---
How is Nefarian HP not deal 1 to all minions yet?
---
The balancing team aren't very good at what they do. That or the initial hype for the (completely f2p) mode is done and so is the short era of quick response balance changes.
---
I'm feeling pretty cynical about the whole situation. Auto Battlers get popular overnight so Team 5 gets thrown under a bus and has to crush one out in 6 months. The result is the most unpolished ~~Activision~~ Blizzard game ever released.
---
It's the enemy the one who play this. His hand is full.
---
I mean the list, like what cards are you running? Also, you said you don’t have dust for highlander, so what is within your means? Do you own and run Zilliax? Togwaggle? Kronx? These are important pieces of information if you want help to beat a metadeck.
---
Stole an amalgam.
---
Oooo face hunters make me cry u make me cry sir
---
Priest and Shaman both have T1 decks. Idk what you're talking about OP.
---
Well I was just thinking that because if your one big maexxna gets hit by a poisonous minion, then you’re out of luck, and the health buff meant nothing, but when you have two, you can have two chances at killing more poisonous minions because it can survive longer. Maybe I’m thinking too much into it, and I think you’ll win with this board anyways, but maybe long term I think it would be better to not triple it.
---
Doesn't that get complicated because of timezones?
---
I second this
---
There are theoretical ways to pull it off. It's just not very realistic.
---
They had an update less than 2 weeks ago. Chill.
---
Define "Weekend".
---
If you cover all timezones, that's almost half the week. If you don't cover all timezones, it's messy.
---
Yea and I work on weekends so my weekdays are pretty much my weekends so I couldn't participate
---
Yeah true, 2 good minions is always better than one, but after I tripled 2 6 stars I decided to triple as many as I can. And this team isn't even that good I just got super lucky with tripling high tier shit.
---
I use it as default, glad to see others like it.
---
Never bm
---
    You don't need to complete each set. That's an odd thing to have as your bar. I played MTGO for years before MTGA arena was a thing and the notion of owning every card was impossible so you never even considered it. Instead, you completed decks. One or two competitive or fun decks per expansion plus a competitive 2 headed giant deck was enough to aim for.  I think hoping to complete each hearthstone set is a counterproductive bar to set unless you play loads daily.  Just getting a few viable decks is enough, and that's very possible F2p and even easier if you play wild because you only add a few cards to your strongest decks each expansion and only rarely is there a whole new archetype.
---
Lorewalker cho and chameleos

I was a big fan of Memes. If there's content to talk about and discussion to be had, I trust they'll find their way to the top anyway. The memes are better content than all the screenshots imho, I'm pro having them around

Guy disappeared after i went first , scam beware.

Yeah, he may not be raging but I do think he's slightly salty about it, considering that I won our match with my laughable deck (vs his quest mage, if I'm not mistaken. Sorry, noob here).

I admit that I suck at the deck-building aspect of this game (broke college student and only started playing a month ago in the middle of finals season).

Did you win?
---
What do you mean, it clearly powercreeps Dinotamer Brann, I have no idea why people don't play it.
---
You need to open ~215 packs to get all the rares from the new set (the same as HS, coincidentally enough).  That doesn't account for mythics but it also doesn't account for wildcards.
---
MTGA has daily quests that offer .5-.75 packs' worth of gold.  Then you also have the daily quest line that gives ~.5 packs across the first 4 wins daily, and if you keep going then it's another .2 packs plus the individual card rewards and mastery xp.
---
So you earn a bit more than a pack a day.  Across three months, that gets you the gold to open about half of the new set, plus various other rewards.
---
You get my downvote for upvote begging lol
---
Old Guardian made a budget version of Galakrond Control Priest, you can look that up on YouTube
---
Flame imp to assert dominance
---
Probably Gruul.
---
Siegebreaker is a nice addition to Warlock’s Galakrond’s pool, and that’s about it.
---
I’d take memes over fanart every day.
---
Look I’m not going to sugar coat it, that deck is really weird and pretty bad. 
---
But since you’re new I can understand! This game is so overwhelming when you’re new. I’ll try and give you some tips:
---
1) Go to HSreplay and look at the decks you’re playing and substitute things you don’t have with suitable alternatives. For example you’re currently playing a highlander mage, go to the website and try and think of alternatives to the cards they put but you don’t have. 
---
Furthermore, using that website you can discover some really cheap but good decks like treant token Druid which should be around 4K dust. 
---
2) Some cards you have in your list really don’t fit the deck. For example the shield of galakrond card has weak stats for a 5 drop but it’s secondary purpose is to “invoke” galakrond and this way the card makes up for it’s bad stats by giving you extra value. However, since you’re playing the mage class, which doesn’t have a galakrond, it’s pretty bad. 
---
Think of alternatives for this 5 drop. Either in the collection click on 5 drops only and look for a better alternative or research online. If you really want a 5 drop with taunt, I suggest Rotten Applebaum which is a 5 mana taunt that has the exact stats as shield of galakrond BUT when it dies it will heal your hero for 4 health. This is a common card so it will be very cheap to craft. Now I’m not saying craft this card it’s strong in this deck, I’m just telling you how to look for alternative cards. 
---
Good luck!
---
Wow. That was a waste of time to watch
---
He might not be salty at all but that's just your preconceptions. I added someone recently who super high rolled me with highlander paladin and I was joking about how good that hand was and they got really defensive and mean when all I was doing was trying to laugh about a high roll.
---
If you want to be build your own deck, you probably want to know types of deck first. There’re aggro deck, midrange deck and control deck. Aggro deck will focus on the early game, deal damage to the opponent and rush them down(opponent might die by turn 6). Control deck, on the other hand, will try to stay alive and kill minions on the board, sometimes running the opponent out of resource(games will sometimes go to turn 30 or something). Midrange deck is somewhat a hybrid of these two. Just build your deck with these strategies in mind. Zoolock is an aggro deck and Handlock is a control deck. That being said, building good deck is hard but I find it enjoyable to build my own deck.
---
There’s also combo deck. This type of deck is like control deck but they like to do flashy combo at the end.
---
Not gonna lie I haven't bought a single pack since rastakhan.
---
I like your deck and can understand your hatred for handbuff rogue. 
---
What do you think of replacing the EVIL conscripters for dead ringers to draw you albatrosses and your mindflayer?
---
Also as a f2p player I don't have a acces to mindflayer kaahrj and I am still missing the shadowy figures and fate weavers. Do you have any good temporary replacements for the epics and a replacement for mindflayer? And which of these do you think I should craft first?

I made a similar post a while back during rise of shadows single player
---
People commented that they consistently saw the AI chose absolutely awful choices from discover
---
Seems like AI is programmed to just pick the worst option.. for some reason..
---
&gt;Or maybe the numbers support people just getting sick of bullshit mechanics and paper, scissors, rock gameplay that it's become more than ever. This expansion has only made it worse.
---
There's nothing to support this? If the numbers were to show a rise in interest during the more calmer expansions like Rastakhan, I'd agree with you. However, [if you look at the statistics](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/386559215562653697/661551881302310932/rastakhan.png) (Red circle peak being Rastakhan and green circle peak being Rise of Shadows, the rest of the peaks you can probably figure out), you'd see that it's been gradually going down since around Ungoro (maybe even before that, but it doesn't go that far back). Changing the power of the expansion has had minimal impact on the effect of the gradual decline in viewers.
---
So now that there's no statistical proof of either argument, I can concede that my opinion is purely subjective, however I can also see that yours is as well. But I have a feeling you will not be so keen on admitting that.
---
The numbers are the numbers.
---
Yeah, fuck people who can't afford expensive decks yet still want to play the game
---
I'm also not a fan of face hunter or any aggro decks for that matter, but shaming people for the deck they play is stupid
---
AI always discovers randomly
---
So it’s toxic because it’s easy to play and can win games?

BigAT #1796 for 80g quest trade

What's the frog for? I'd be interested in seeing this decklist!

Well but, crafting togwaggle will give me sinergies y this deck ;-;

---
They seem to have an aversion to providing any sort of win% stats.  The monthly report never says anything about it either.
---
I guess for some people it would dissuade experimentation and fun and just feel bad for some players to be rocking a 30%.
---
Sounds like you know which one you want already.
---
Duskfallen Aviana and Nat The Darkfisher
---
(by the way, the guy Bread was my friend)
---
Nono, I'm very hesitant ;-; because siamat is really good and I can put him in many decks
---
Androids &gt; Iphones
---
It's on January 12th at 2pm btw
---
&gt; because that’s like the cheapest they ever sell for.
---
Truth, but old packs have less value than newer packs for a variety of reasons. 
---
1. Players are unlikely to pull something particularly useful from older packs as they've crafted or pulled what they needed previously.
---
2. 3/5 of the packs rotate imminently. 
---
As far as I'm concerned, that bundle is paying for 30 packs worth of dust. That's not necessarily bad, but it's certainly not exciting.
---
If you tank your MMR hard enough (in legend rank) you can sometimes get matches up with ranked players. I thought they fixed it, but it must still exist when you can't find anyone else to play.
---
In the first few years of HS, it was a common screenshot to see a (tanked) Legend player playing against rank 20-25.
---
I would go with Token Druid. The most expensive cards are Goru and Forces of Nature, but you can get by without them.
---
Oh yeah. He cast flamestrike the next turn and I wasn't able to recover.
---
Yeah, I was also eyeing Token Druid, and I did unpack Ysera, Unleashed, but idk what to do with it.

You have to watch the second battle. The first battle is setting the scene.
---
Wrong. Discover battle cries get automatic chosen with Shudderwork battlecry. So you just happened to get Shudder from your opponent's hand.

If only battlegrounds was ranked like that you might be right...

4th is still counted as a win.

of course someone who posts on hearthstone circlejerk would make a new reddit account to add HK into his name

i find it actually hilarious that a subreddit dedicated to making fun of the stupid and annoying trends is populated entirely by people who lack any drop of self awareness whatsoever
---
Honestly, I'm just happy we can share this lol, but I'll be damned if I wasn't just a tad bit salty she managed to RNG a Leeroy out of a classic pack
---
They need to put in all the tribes honestly. I know it would take a lot of balance testing but it's going to get stale quick with what they have now.
---
They need a half-dozen more heroes and the other tribes and figure a way to implement more keyword abilities. Right now it's divine shield and poison late game most of the time and that's mega boring.

Mr. Stonebrew, I don't feel so good.

I doubt you are a veteran with such a lack of knowledge about the game lmao. Enjoy crying in the Runeterra subreddit after its release because of X unbalanced deck.
---
Not to make you saltier, but so did I (many moons ago, it was definitely my happiest legendary pull, I hope you told her how lucky she was to pull it)
---
This is a really stupid idea, as dumb as when people suggest it shouldn’t count as a spell, or a spell that didn’t start in your deck. It’s an intended interaction and a way to leverage your disadvantageous position when going second.

If you're talking about the 5 Galakrond Dragon cards then yes.
---
Just checked the replay, I did use all 4 of them. Maybe there's some issue when plot twisting Galakrond.
---
yap.
---
Prolly leeroy and ragnaros, he just chose it for the theme... Lolz
---
The five legendaries are Galakrond, kind of like a C'thun that only 5 classes can use, but it's slightly different for each one. Logging in gets all 5 for free, as well as two enablers.  Just like how during WOTOG everyone got C'thun.
---
As for what to craft, Kronx is a pretty safe one.  He's a key card in ANY Galakrond deck.
---
&gt;Just checked the replay, I did use all 4 of them. Maybe there's some issue when plot twisting Galakrond.
---
It sounds like you are still building a collection.   I would say siamat is the Ragnaros of this generation.  It’s a very powerful card that can go in a wide variety of decks.  It will most likely always be good, and will probably be relevant in wild for a long time.  I would craft siamat and then the card that draws elementals from your deck
---
Before I read I thought all of that was for Battlegrounds. Anyways thank you!
---
I do hope we get dergons in battlegrounds though.
---
No prob. I had to do a double take, too.  Really looking forward to getting a bunch of new cards so soon.
---
Not all heros wear capes
---
Baron wouldn't have died if you choose a 1 attack minion. Again, lots of outs, OP was pretty favored from what was provided.
---
&gt; galakrond warlock
---
I think the problem with it is the 7 mana cost. A board clear and refresh at 8 mana is a bit on the steep side for what Galalock is trying to do. Basically, he wants to flood the board and keep it flooded for control and face. Very zoo, really. And while this combo does indeed maintain board control in a big way, you usually have invoked a lot and then drew Galakrond for 4 minions by then, so you already have board control, or you're dead. 
---
Flames+Whitemane is good if you can flood the board with cheap minions first, but if you did that already and didn't lose it immediately, then you probably are already winning. So, the combo is kind of a win more combo.
---
A few Galalocks run Plague of Flames already, but since the minions they're burning off to destroy the board tend to be the 1/1's from the Scarab Eggs, there's not much value in spending 7 mana to get them back. Whitemane only makes sense if you have a board full of reasonably good minions, hit them into face, then wipe board and bring them back with full health. It's a hell of a combo, to be sure, but you have to have a bunch of good minions to make it worth while to do.
---
That sounds about right
---
I'm actually somewhat fine if it counts as a spell for effects but for combos it's shown to just be completely game warping going second and coining out their early combo cards.
---
It's been 2020 for me since like around 2 hours ago, and after reading the comments I suddenly remembered the existence of timezones

To be honest as an ftp player HS is not very enjoyable at all at the moment. I agree that the meta is balanced, but I get the impression that it is so due to just a number of equally overpowered decks, which somehow balance each other out.
---
This means that just a certain number of cards dominate the meta. I have never not conceded immediately when the shaman or warlock galakrond are played. In order for a deck to be viable it needs 7 mana spawn a shit ton of big drops, or 9 mana spawn 3 dragons. Even simply a 5 mana "8/8" with rush is op in my honest opinion (note that galakrond decks use legendary cards like kronx and a bunch of epics like sion) 
---
This means that we ftp players are forced to play cheap aggro decks, but even pirate warrior requires you to have Leeroy and Ancharrr. 
---
So I'm essentially left with no other option than to play braindead facehunter - not fun for either side.
---
They intentionally don’t so you get no info about their comp.
---
Your days are numbered, bot.
---
they are max 12 hours apart iirc.
---
I reckon you're just insecure
---
TIL
---
This is just powercreep rearing it’s head. Sister should be fine for cost but isn’t anymore, so the whole card suffers, and on and on it goes.
---
There is no good combo deck in the game lul
---
We're trying to minimize the value of Psychopomp, as giving minions reborn is particularly good with the priest quest. That means it's better to avoid letting priest minions die until you've got Hex or Earth Shock available, or something similarly strong. There's a bit of a tradeoff because instead the priest can just attack and then heal your face, but it's usually worth it.
---
Sorry. I didn't actually really want to do this one because I personally ran through all three on Whizbang decks.
---
First note, Combo Priest is not meant to be run on putricide... It's for sindragosa. Combo Priest on Putricide is not going to work because of freezing trap. For Putricide, I recommended running Secret Keeper (who will get buffed for every secret putricide puts down) and eater of secrets (who will both eat putricide's secrets and gain stats based upon the number of secrets he eats.)
---
Yeah but the odds are roughly 1 in 250 000 so it's pretty unlucky.
---
It crashes on my X.
---
Not as bad as other people have been complaining about, but I get frequent crashes on loading into a new game, it gets stuck in the &lt;player&gt; VS &lt;you&gt; screen.
---
I think kill the app and restart Hearthstone, and it usually doesn't notice that I've got a game going on...so I queue for a new game, and HS crashes again, reboots, and reconnects to the game.
---
That means I sometimes have to start the game three times to get into a match.
---
I have a theory about what's going on in my case: I think it's that HS was closed long enough that it's not really connected to the servers properly...if you go into your collection after leaving the app for 30s or so, it will usually freeze right now.
---
It was pretty obvious from the beginning that the whole "reconnect" option they've tried to add is pretty broken - it fails to reconnect as often as it succeeds - and in this version I think they released some changes that were supposed to improve that, but they didn't fix everything, and instead, you can now be "connected enough" to queue for a game, but not "connected enough" to actually connect to that game...and sometimes even restarting the app won't even get you properly connected anymore.
---
Its existence nerfs the evolving 6 drops.
---
There has been little change since DoD dropped until this post by the mods.
---
really cool! Good work :)
---
More expensive? Oh joy... As far as starting like I'm a new player again thats definitely what I feel like with all of this content.
---
It's not worth attending when 6 out of 7 are minimal effort garbage either...
---
Would you reccomend playing quest resurrect preist? I just got back into playing the game and I'm planning on climbing the ranks next month.
---
thats a good play, now you dont have to worry about drawing them.
---
i was just think today... "maybe the galakrond dogs are actually a bit op... imagine turn 6 elementalist and turn 7 coin into Electra + dogs ... that a turn 7 and 4 taunt 5-6" ... but i guess this is better :D
---
Velentina#1665 na 80g

With Galakrond, rogue has a lot of opportunities to generate lackeys.
---
poo year 😳😳
---
How about neither.
---
Battlegrounds is free and honestly the best part of the game atm
---
Priest Plague was the reason I made a control shaman deck. Pretty good against every class but Warrior.
---
To be fair, it really seemed like it wouldn't be enough. The deck was so oppressive, it's crazy how those small changes made such a difference.
---
Yup. It's good to have all that content because it will keep you occupied while you do your daily quests, hoard your gold and wait for the next expansion (and rotation). 
---
Try to find a budget deck you can live with (in the meantime) that doesn't require cards that are going to rotate soon.
---
There should be a reasonable amount of time between sessions. If the game is closed at work and immediately opened at home, in such a short amount of time that the user could not have traveled the distance, then it looks like a bannable account sharing.
---
If sufficient time passes between sessions such that the user could have reasonably traveled from one location to the next, then it shouldn't be flagged at all.
---
Quest hunter. The only rng is the draw order, animal companion, draw from diving gryphon and where the ping from knife juggler hits. And can do good in this meta.
---
Congrats! Happy New Year!
---
Yup 100%, ive given up playing on mobile until they “fix” it.
---
Ya they try to trick them for the early hits. I’m talking turn 4-6 where you could potentially do around 6 dmg most ppl seem to think “oh ya well if they don’t have anything that’s a fair amount of dmg.” Expect they always will have something, it’s more likely your helping your opponent with that mid game dmg then you are helping yourself.
---
Doesn’t seem like that’s performing super well is the only problem
---
Battlegrounds on mobile is literally unplayable for me as it is.
---
Why do you tell people to run face hunter?  Maybe you should encourage something else than a braindead deck for brain dead idiots....
---
I thought that was part of the battlecry but I might be wrong
---
You're really not understanding what I'm suggesting
---
I predict reno, finley, brann, and Elise hero cards.
---
It’s the kid’s first time hitting r10 in a while. Why do you feel the need to shit on his progress? You’re subject to your own opinions. He hit a goal, I’m congratulating him for it and telling him to ignore cynical narcissists like yourself.

Not that mods generally police memes that well anyway - there almost always seems to be a few on the main page.

I did so and I managed to win
---
It shows the damage dealt which is what is being discussed here.
---
It was meant as a joke.  Face hunter meets the criteria for new players, in that it is cheap to craft and has a decent win rate on ladder.
---
I completely agree that neither of those criteria change the fact that it is no fun to play or to play against.

Trash legend here, you play for value, if you tech specifically for them you lose to other stuff, quest w barista should always out value them, you won't be agro enough to beat them unless you are like pirate so either add some value and anticipate , they have 2 revives 4 board wipes and a lot of taunt clears, gotta slowly draw it all out and barely win at the end, if you can mass.hex their stuff early them their revives suck but they put big single minions, and vice versa, so it's just slowly grinding it out or hope to god they miss all their early and you get the nuts
---
Are you retarded ? Obviously buff your other minions not the 1/1
---
Umadbro?
---
I'm surprised you can even play it on your phone. I don't see the point, it's too slow for me, a good way of lowering my rank. But okay. An unsell button wouldn't be abusable, onlu for undoing the most previous sell. For Deryl it would just have to undo the sell buff. I don't know if when you sell a minion if it immediately goes back into the pool for other players, so if you sold your Cobalt Guardian (whilst the others are all owned) and then another player refreshes their tavern and rolls your Guardian, they could buy it, and you could undo and reclaim yours, meaning now there's 7 off them in the game. Then again with the introduction of Raffam there's no real limit to how many of a single minion can be in the pool.
---
Was it Hysteria who conceded a few hundred games at legend in Wild until he got matched against a rank 20? This was going back a few years now.

Woodoo#2727, EU trade 80g quest, you go first (I can show if you like).

---
&gt;There's nothing to support this? If the numbers were to show a rise in interest during the more calmer expansions like Rastakhan, I'd agree with you.   
---
You're calling the period of odd/even calm?  That power level alone was driving many people away for the same reason it does now.   Decks where you've lost before you even started.  
---
So not sure how you are defining calm or a fun meta anymore or even power level for that matter.
---
Do any go back when you triple a minion? Like hotels and houses in Monopoly? Or is it only when a player gets knocked out or sells?
---
If you level, freeze this, and don't hit a token generator the following turn, I think you're then meant to sell a wrath weaver to buy a wrath weaver, just to free up a space in the shop.  
---
Probably best is just to level, but that's less fun.
---
Just close and relaunch the game...

And hope you can actually reconnect to the game.
