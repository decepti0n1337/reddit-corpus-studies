It sais that if the game has good 2 drops, you don't want Kele. Agro paladin doesn't play it, kingsbane rogue doesn't play it, zoo doesn't play, the list just keeps going
---
And all you get for it is 25% of the cost of another legendary. Frankly my advice is just not to ever dust any playable copies of anything. Takes some patience, but you eventually get to where you can build basically any deck even if you're f2p.
---
You can finish it...
---
It's a meme lol, he knows that Naxx was out in 2014.
---
Dude you have no idea what you are asking. We used to have 9 deck slots and then, after years of research, they added 9 more. A lot of casual players where so confused that they quit. Adding more deck slots now would kill the game. Think of the casuals for god's sake.

How is this different that just having a rotating brawl each week as we do now?    
---

---
You're then basically asking them to develop a monthly brawliseum on top of the weekly brawl?  
---
Whilst anything new would be nice I don't personally want just another pay to play game mode.  
---
&gt;I think the success of the most recent Brawl is proof that there is large demand from the player base in nifty formats like these.  
---
Success? What success? You mean the large amounts of gold/dust that people who had access to the overpowered otk style decks earned?  
---
If I were to guess I'd say this would have been the least successful brawliseum in terms of overall population participation and total amount of games played but that's just my hunch.  
---
Normally on a brawliseum I'd pay for a few runs but this one was once and done, it was horrible.  
---
Except there are multiple things that can prevent it.

Well done my dude, I recall this fight being an absolute bitch to beat

What good does tracking do in your opinion because i hate the rng of discarding 2 cards that i need for more options
---
If the combo *requires* shadow visions to go off on a turn before playing the combo, it’s not an OTK.
---
If the combo uses shadow visions as a way to speed up card draw, it’s fine. 
---
?
---
It absolutely matters, a card that is good in a vacuum has a significantly higher chance of seeing consistent play rather than a meta dependent card. It also will see play across a wider variety of deck archetypes, which allows it to be played somewhat regardless of meta. 
---
Purify is a bad card in a vacuum, that saw play in 1 archetype for 1 meta. Firefly is a good card in a vacuum that saw play in virtually every archetype in every meta in nearly ever class for 2 straight years. 
---
The absurdity of imagining a meta situation where firefly is 1 star is hilariously convoluted and forced. Whereas it's the exact opposite for a card like Purify, where to make the card competitively viable requires quite convoluted levels of support to make up for it's inherent weakness in power level.
---
I get you're being sarcastic, but I remember beating plenty of tempo rogues who opened with multiple keleseths -- seemingly because they ran out of steam

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
A few notes: 
---
*Van cleef and sherazin are not replaceable.  They are very core to this deck.
---
*Its not the easiest deck to pilot, but soooo satisfying when you get the hang of it.  If you remember how miracle worked during the conceal days, it’s kinda like that.  You have to know when to just kinda go all in on a threat and hope for the best.  It requires reading your opponent.
---
I just got a quest I can't even do 
---
So then my Five Tharussian ticks into two pyroblasts and two fireballs is an OTK. 
---
I was able to do it with the rogue steal shrine, and with good RNG you steal their really OP cards
---
Your definition would exclude many accepted OTK decks: mechathun (all the versions that use Galvanizer), uther OTK (either need to generate a coin or bounce guys), Anyfin (have to play murlocs), maly rogue (pre-play the weapon), maly druid (via twig or florist), etc. Now that's not wrong per se, but it doesn't reflect the common understanding of what the phrase OTK deck means.
---
I think the point others make when they argue that one Thaurissan tick is fine is that a) it cannot be prevented by an opponent (ignoring dirty rat, secrets, etc which could screw with your definition of OTK too) and b) it doesn't matter what turn it is played so long as the right cards are discounted. This second part is what distinguishes a Thaurissan tick from say a shaman board flood one turn and then double bloodlust the next.
---
The definition of OTK deck that I am aware of is: 1. the deck can do 30+ damage in one turn, and 2. it can do that damage with no minions on board at the start of its turn.
---
Yep, for all the complaints and constructive criticism we may give it really is a great value product overall when I think of how much engagement I spend in the game and all for free.  
---
So Happy Birthday Hearthstone. :)
---
Yeah but that’s pussy shit. It’s easy to say “may or may not see play” about every card, but that means you have no balls. 
---
That's most of Reddit.
---
have to admire that dudes gloop sprayer though...
---
I thought genn and baku were going to be bad, boy was i wrong.
---
Did you forget to demagnetize the mechs after the last game?
---
I dont recognize this adventure. Is it still available? Am I just being dumb? Probably
---
Imagine getting this offended after being wrong about what an OTK is.
---
those decks weren,'t  good until the nerfs hit, and weren't great agter either...
---
I’m offended by the terrible reading comprehension. The fact that you’re wrong about OTKs is just icing on the cake. 
---
Used to play hearthstone, now i play mtga. Unlimited deck slots means people like me have to spend 5 minutes a month deleting jank decks
---
So wait...you're argument is they can release strong cards for the Odd/Even archetype in future expansion. It's almost like the same thing can happen for other archetypes as well... Pirate Warrior is literally 1+ health away on Small-Time Buccaneer from being the most dominate deck in the format.
---
And besides the point, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a deck being strong. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a deck seeing play.
---
I'd say clearing Dungeon Run is way easier than Heroic in most adventures, even when you consider you need to do all classes. But maybe it's because I've played tons of roguelikes in my time. Good luck.
---
It actually comes down to the fact that I get sick of facing the same deck archetypes no matter what mode I'm in. Every time I see a paladin, I know I'll either see Genn or Baku at the start. Every time I see a druid I know it will be malygos or togg or both. It doesn't matter what game mode I choose, I'm playing against the same decks. I might as well be playing against a brainless computer player because all games turn out the same.
---
After a balance chang, which nerfed all the strong aggressive decks
---
5 years ago we had Play Mode, and Arena. Today we have Play Mode Arena and Tavern Brawl! How far we have come. Happy birthday HS! 
---
An otk is generally regarded as reducing an opponenet from max health or near max health (25-30) to 0. In some cases, health doesn't matter. Otk paladin, all mechathun, maly priest, maly druid is all otk.
---
I really like that you had to say. Now, I really wish I didn't DE my cards from last rotation. I should be getting a good amount of dust from this rotation tho. It's' that and I started playing during Karazan so I don't have cards from Naxx to Gadgetzan. Would you still recommend a dual focus?
---
Basically the thread https://www.reddit.com/r/KFTPRDT/comments/6lqxei/comment/djw1dib
---
First of all, not knowing the definition of a word has nothing to do with R E A D I N G C O M P R E H E N S I O N
---
Also, if you're in the minority when it comes to arguing the definition of a word, you are objectively wrong. That's how language works.
---
Well, to be fair, I imagine that the development team has exactly zero say in what the cost of the game is, so they are probably unable to give any answer other than "Well, that's what accounting says we need to charge...."
---
The future outlook question is interesting, the fact that they avoided questions on game modes or features says pretty plainly that they are not working on them. Not unexpected, but lame none the less.
---
sounds post hoc as fuck. 
---
Aka shit F2P people can feel competitive in.
---
Aka shit that removes the extreme need to get better cards to be relevant and doesn't make Blizzard money.
---
Aka shit that will never come to this game.
---
Exactly, it's funny the first time you see it. And every time someone reposts it, a few hundred people see it for the first time.
---
The eternal hunt has begun.
---
The eternal hunt has begun. 
---
Obviously it is not, because Genn/Baku are being sent to HoF in an unprecedented move.  1) They're being sent after 1 year in Standard, 2) they're not Classic/Basic cards.
---
So clearly team5 agrees that Genn/Baku are a problem, enough so that they're willing to solve that problem for Standard players.  But Genn/Baku are equally as dominant in Wild, so something needs to be done about them there, too.
---
I'd be interested. Should probably form a discord or something for people who want to find games.
---
I totally bought the hype, opened Prince 2 and 3, and dusted both in disgust. ha!
---
I'm going to assume it wasn't silenced?
---
It is still not the 11th in the US
---
They could also make Psychmelon cost 6-7 mana, which might be a fair cost for its effect.  4 mana draw 4 is pretty fucking broken, 6 mana draw 4 is slightly undercosted compared to Sprint.
---
I do this often.  
---
When someone concedes and saves me having to watch through them making a play even though they've lost I thank them for it.  
---
It's really not BM in my eyes.  
---
"Greetings" on the other hand ... BM.  
---
The distance between your hand and is face seemed huge dude, must've been a big representation of the board. Lookst fun! Did you build the client yourself or how does this work?
---
Upvoting this for how ridiculous it is.
---
We tried folks. That’s what counts. 
---
Damn y’all spoiled. 2 hours ago you didn’t even know this was a thing and now you’re complaining that you haven’t gotten free shit for it yet. 
---
Both are good decks.
---
Blizzard wants the game to go longer, you are not going to spend money on crazy legendaries that cost 8 mana if games last until turn 6. 
---
By my frozen heart!
---
Even i rogue saronite was a better anti aggro tool
---
It's funny too, because if we want a safe place to try competitive play, then it makes sense that people play meta decks. No better way to practice for the real thing than to play against the real thing in an environment where winning or losing literally does nothing (aside from netting you 10 gold after 3 wins...). So this guy is contradicting himself while also implying that everyone agrees with the contradiction.
---
Honestly, casual wouldn't be a problem if the gold was reworked in my opinion. Instead of 10 gold after 3 wins, they should just award 10 gold after 3 games played. Some people will try to abuse this, to which I say you implement the same rule for playing against a friend. You can't forfeit until your health is at 15, and if your opponent forfeits, you can still get the reward because it wasn't a forfeit on your end.
---
Ugh I remember packing weapon removal almost solely for freaking Skulls of Manari during those Cubelock days. That was one of my least favorite metas.
---
It's not actually infinite. Defile has a limit on how many times it can trigger, something like 14 times if i'm not mistaken. The closest combo to being infinite is probably topsy turvy otk priest as, if not for the animations, your apm is the only thing that limits your damage. There might be others in wild but I couldn't tell you what they are.
---
So if I am rank 6, and I can't get over the hump to rank 5, I have to just YOLO my rank back down to 10 and hope I just master the deck along the way.
---
Get out of here. I have every right to play whatever deck I want in casual, even if it means practicing a t1 deck.
---
Good in a tournement where you have bans, and have to bring multiple decks; does not mean good on ladder
---
I mean it's sad but it's true, I would absolutely pay for it as long as it was a fairly reasonable price. It's almost kind of pathetic.
---
How does that relate to practicing a new deck though? The way you worded that implies you're playing a deck you're comfortable with, which probably isn't the intention of the other guy.
---
Prince 3 saw a lot of play when Cubelock was super popular.
---
if you pull via dirty rat or burn a key card from any OTK will prevent it before....
---
Druid with armor refills mana, the special minion that gives mana crystals on play and is always in your hand at start of game, just enough armor gain and TONS of late game was my first win, one of the best hearthstone experiences to date
---
Premature post. New expansion could make this largely irrelevant.
---
If you want this to matter, re-evaluate and make additions to this article, after all new cards are revealed, and post it again.
---
No disrespect to your work. Actually, out of compassion for your time and effort, I would be sad for it to be inaccurate.
---
I agree, but  even miracle rogue cut prince for saronite, multiple bodies make that card so more efficient
---
I don't buy the underlying 'everyone is a special snowflake, oppressed by the cruel meta' idea behind any of this.  People play meta decks in Casual for the same reason they play them in Ranked.  While I'm sure some feel forced to, many if not most do so because they find better decks to be more enjoyable.  Or be like me and find deck creation to be a horrible slog because they won't shit on a decklist and call it special.  You iterate and improve.
---

a better version of this comment would have you in a more celebratory mood. armchair commenters...
---
Yeah Reddit sucks at evaluating. A lot of the pros said the same thing, it doesn’t fit into decks rn (at the time) but it will when 2 drops stop being as good, or if it can win without a 2 drop on 2 every game. More or less correct.
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/community/leaderboards
---
Yeah pretty much. The response was more upvotes tho, which was obv more correct.
---
This card is bad.
---
This card is SO bad.
---
This card takes out all of your 2 mana cards for what? Mistcaller's effect and mistcaller did not see play. Not only that it also has a worse mistcaller effect because this does not buff your hand.
---
Every deck runs at least a few core 2 mana cards and this thing is never a good replacement. Even in a deck where you can find a spot for this thing it is very unlikely to even be drawn in the early game when it is relevant because this can only be a one of. Even if  you draw it early it is only a 2/2 that has no immediate effect because it still does not even buff the hand.
---
Its effect is so slow it might not even make a difference until a few turns after it is played while your opponent builds up against you while you have no answers because you can't run any 2 mana cards which tend to be a lot of the good answers in the game to early aggression (FWA, frostbolt, SW:P, Eviserate, Wrath...).
---
In terms of bad legendaries I would go so far to say this is worse than Millhouse Manastorm because you can occasionally find an opponent that doesn't have a spell in their hand and millhouse can be good, while this thing cripples your deck before you start, is a tiny minion at only 2/2, and its effect is almost never relevant.
---
And while this thing has been mentioned as a build-around card, those cards are supposed to have the strongest effects in the game such as healing to full health, summoning a massive board, or making your own spell while this thing just has a bad mistcaller effect.
---
Even if there are other cards that support not having 2 mana cards, this thing also is 2 mana and would be really bad there too.
---
I like it because it’s the excitement of reveal season each week mixed in with the bliss of never having to play against that unbalanced bullshit (and the occasional really interesting card with a unique effect).
---
My first completed hunter run had 5 rexxars and the aoe plus armor gain was almost always relevant. Consistency plus powerful effect was really helpful
---
Correct, they should both simply follow the ruleset of their formats.  There clearly is a need for both as both have significant number of players.  If you want to argue for a third mode, sure, but I disagree with taking something away those who like to run good decks in Casual just because you don't want them to.
---
I think he dropped this \^/s
---
The "it might be good, it might be bad" reviews are far more useful. They at least include some speculation in decks or metas the card might be useful in. Go look at an Odd Paladin list sometime and compare Trumps review of those cards vs Kiblers review.
---
Right, wrong or otherwise you're still being a defensive asshole over a pretty silly technicality. Have a good night.
---
That’s a good point. People immediately said Juicy Psychmelon and Star Aligned would be broken in Wild and it was, forcing Aviana to be nerfed.
---
Then Thekal + Molten Giants was immediately theorycrafted and it’s now part of Tier 1 decks 
---
Any variants stemming from a WowHobbs-style Lorewalker Cho deck. 
---
&lt;Hello, friend.&gt;
---
How was Razakus Priest the best deck of the meta? Tempo Rogue spent way more time at the top of Tier 1 then Razakus Priest ever did. Look at Vicious Syndicates meta reports at the time 
---
Wasnt that just people who were working on destiny that got let go?
---
Never mind, it’s just semantics 
---
Maybe you misunderstand me, I'm not suggesting we ban anything. 
---
You can and should practice on casual mode with meta decks. This change will make that goal much better than casual mode currently, i.e. if I'm looking to practice on casual with a meta deck I don't really want to do that against people just trying to complete their daily quest as quickly as possible. What I really want is to play against other competitive players and taking the deck MMR as a factor in the matchmaking will make that experience much better.
---
A shame you only got Alextraza just after the brawl ended.
---
This is the next level type of plays I watch my girlfriend make who's trying to get into Hearthstone.
---
This hits too close to home.
---
Casual currently uses MMR for matchmaking. It is ladder essentially, except you can’t see your rating.
---
To your second point, if you want to face meta decks with a meme deck, you can do that today on ladder.

While this is true, many streamers have proven that even without rexxar they can climb very high using budget versions (toast reaching legend with super budget deck, kripp going 24-0 with 1k dust hunter) so the deck could sill work as an aggro
---
If you get enough giants bucket with mage+ 5 cost rod, its just an instant win.
---
Yeah... I mean, don't all wild players make it top 100 legend a third of the way through the season every month?
---
You sound a little jealous and condescending, man. It's kind of a buzz kill. Not going to lie. You act as if there are like eight people playing wild and it's inevitable.
---
Wild doesn't have as many people as standard. It still takes a good player to make it to high legend no matter how far into the season.
---
Source: I've been playing wild every season since the game has existed. 
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
While, for the most part, I do agree with you. In my day of testing, I’ve found one exception to this rule, that being Warlock. Between Mistress of Mixtures,  as well as the large amount of AOE available to Warlock at a basic level (Hellfire, Abyssal Enforcer) as well as cards like shadowbolt and blastcrystal potion. I do believe warlock is capable of playing a control role in a common/basic scenario, and still finding space to apply pressure with things like voidcaller into big demons.  I also believe priest may be able to serve a similar role, but I’m still testing that one. 
---
So then what change are you suggesting if it already does this?
---
And I know you can, I was just trying to say, that some people actually like facing memes in casual. Like when Tesspionage started as a meme, and now you can find them on ladder. I was able to ready myself for that because I practice on casual sometimes.
---
This.  I haven't logged on today, but I'm assuming it's like Arena right before it changes.  They stop people from starting new runs, but if you had an existing run going you could finish.

How does this work? I'm super confused, Baku is a start of game effect before you draw or mulligan so Keleseth a 2 coat card was in the deck when the odd cost only affect went off. As he DOES have the upgraded hero power Baku worked while having an even cost card in the deck. What am I missing here or is this a graphical issue of some sort
---
I put it on your head* 
---
Are we certain that the "Someone new" means someone we haven't seen before in HS, and instead not just "We're moving on to someone else who will be new to the team" or something along those lines?
---
(RoskarS) great to see the community being referred to as "team noproshere" haha, how we've grown.
---
I know this is days old but I had a random idea: what if you got a non-disenchantable golden version of a card whenever you beat someone on ladder using that card to deal the final point of damage?
---
Or maybe put a crown over that card in your collection or something like that. It can provide years worth of "achievement grinding" while also triggering some creativity (how do I kill someone with vaporize????)
---
Well we know one is the fortune teller and Togwaggle for sure, so we have 3 more to speculate.  I really think this expansion is about revenge from bosses we've already conquered in past expansions.  The only expansions that had a definitive villains were as follows:
---
League of Explorers -Rafaam: People seem to like this as a possibility, so let's count him in.
---
Whispers of the Old Gods: There are 4 Gods here, so I doubt they will just randomly choose one.  Let's count this out.
---
Knights of the Frozen Throne-Lich King:  This is a possibility also and he is probably the most beloved villain in Warcraft history. 
---
The Witchwood - Hagatha: With the last clue I think she will probably make an appearance again.
---
The Boomsday Project - Dr. Boom:  Another solid possibility.  We'll have to wait for more clues.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All other expansions really never had a solid figure as the main villian, so I won't focus on those.
---
 So we really have Rafaam, Lich King, Hagatha and Dr. Boom.  Take your pick between any of those I guess.  Of course, this is all based off of the theory the expansion is a revenge of those past bosses.  If that isn't the case then this all falls apart. 
---
I’m new to the game, why did he concede?

Which class do you play as in that deck?
---
I replied to someone else a little while ago. I just like keeping lists and records, didn't really discriminate against minor stuff. 
---
Quick question, you feel depressed but still generally play and enjoy the game? Or do you not play anymore?
---
Over the years, I think plenty of people have realised that Hearthstone's core vision is pretty different from what they want  from a card game, in one way or another, so they left. I do feel there are still plenty of players who continue playing but don't actually like Hearthstone as it is, they just really like talking about the sort of game they wish it would become.
---
If you get bored and want to get even sillier rotface combos when he rotates to wild, try out sudden genesis.  I have a super janky ancient one warrior that uses sudden genesis to replicate bloods, but I also have rotface in there and getting a copy of rotface only leads to greater insanity.
---
Druid mostly, when you're drawing a lot of cards starting with a larger deck is a big plus.
---
The thing about the knife juggler OTK is that they changed Defile to stop after 13 re-casts (14 total casts) meaning that the total amount of damage done is much less.
---
Also, Knife Juggler can hit minions so if they don’t have an empty board then there is wasted damage.
---
Finally, this only requires a single cost reduction which is more consistent since you don’t also need a Drakkari Enchanter or to have Thaurissan live for another turn.
---
IMO defile was the best boardclear they ever created. You have to set things up for it to work, could be a waste, could be a 2 Mana destroy all minions
---
&gt; It's not ridiculous to predict that eventually aggro in Standard is going to need a buff because of rotation
---
Well, it is a bit ridiculous. When is the last time Blizzard buffed anything in Standard?
---
Other than that, your post makes a lot more sense than OPs. Genn/Baku are very powerful now and will become insanely powerful in the coming years.
---
And this is how it feels like [To Lose by messing up](https://clips.twitch.tv/BluePowerfulTubersBrokeBack)

That is a link that I had not considered. Maybe I could be wrong about about being wrong about the Card Backs and then that could mean that villain 5 could be Thaurissan or even Nefarian.

I’d love to see either of those make a comeback.
---
Don't opt out of ranks 50-25
---
Don't buy packs for: Journey to Un'Goro, Knights of the Frozen Throne, or Kobolds and Catacombs. They're rotating to wild in a month
---
Buy 1 pack at a time of Witchwood, The Boomsday Project, and  Rastakhan Rumble until you open a legendary in each
---
Do the prologue for the Ice Crown adventure
---
Can I summon the hall of fame bot?
---
Play rumble run to get a feel for the cards
---
Don't craft anything, except hall of fame, until the meta settles mid April
---
Exactly, that’s why Hearthstone mobile players all eventually go deaf.
---
Two involving Exodia Mage. One was a while ago, when I completed the quest with a spell that generated a card, with 9 cards already in hand (not counting the one I was playing).
---
And yesterday, when I so-cleverly played a generated Pocket Galaxy and then realised that Mimiron's Head was already in-hand but the Target Dummies weren't, which meant my combo would cost 11 mana instead of 10.
---
Rather than uselessly commenting "this", you should try adding something to the thread.  If you agree with someone's comment, simply upvote them.
---
For real?
---
Yep
---
It had it's time when it was a secondary win condition and actually playable in meta decks.  
---
In the past couple of years, cards with big, unique effects, and even just "too expensive/too slow" power cards in general, that we assumed were impractical, have repeatedly proved viable in one way or another. Actually, going all the way back to Old Gods, when Y'Shaarj and Yogg ended up being useful.
---
There are a ton of examples of various types - "win the game" type of cards, such as Rin and Mecha'Thun; weird "meme" effects such as Togwaggle and Benedictus; and even just stat-sticks such as Tyrantus. The most recent example is Hakkar, perhaps.
---
I'm guessing the viability of these things is a combination of there being a lot of very powerful defensive cards, and Blizzard making a conscious decision to make sure cards such as these had viable strategies associated with them.
---
I think most f2p would buy the welcome bundle as it is such amazing value for money.
---
I don't buy packs with money on on Asia or EU, but I did buy that bundle for both regions. I also use my Google rewards money on those regions.
---
I will spend money on packs in NA.
---
So am I f2p in those regions? Mostly 😋
---
Anyone with math skills knows the chances?
---
Please don't encourage them. It's been a nice change with him gone. 
---
to extinction
---
You would use your own custom values and set those cards to 0.  In which case the sheet considers those cards "owned", places them worth their dust rate, and effectively excludes them from your calculations.
---
Well that means even the average person got some profit, which is good that brawl was more open to everyone.
---
For f2p you're right. It should be just zero.
---
did you even look at the picture?
---
It could.  We are already seeing a much faster Wild at the moment.  In any case, I'm saving my golden and non-golden Genn/Baku in anticipation of a nerf one day.  
---
Rag would be nice to bring back in especially with Lich King rotating out in a bit
---
You memes will make a fine addition to my COLLECTION
---
Yogg-Saron and Sneed's old Shredder
---
Congrats! Looking forward to a rank 10 post this month. Gl
---
Either Arena-only or drops real money on the expansions.
---
There’s literally no OTK in hearthstone by this definition, every single combo that can 30 to 0 your opponent requires multiple turns of setup, even aside from drawing. Would probably make more sense to have a “definition” of OTK that actually includes something that exists in the game.
---
Lmao I just saw the comments. Apparently they think I drive like this...
---
So if someone trashtalks me and i get angry because of that, that means i must have emotional issues?
---
Also, feel free to give me a good argument as to why my suggestion would be a detriment to the game.
---
Yes. They mostly play tavern brawls and hang around Rank 20, playing whatever they want (mostly illogical homebrews). They spend money on the game too, one of them on my friend list who I still occasionally chat with pre-orders.
---
You meet all kinds of people (meaning different play demographics) at firesides, at least the ones I've been to. I remember logging on to the Lich King fireside fight where hundreds of people were in the same inn. You could see that the vast majority were Rank 15-25.
---
Do you remember Combo Priest before Shadow Visions? Actually, when I was building some budget decks in January, I tried that in the current meta. Getting to that combo is hard, really hard. Adding in Shadow Visions made it a completely different deck.
---
Against Combo Priest without Shadow Visions, you can survive long enough to just Malygos them down.
---
Decklist link?
---
This with Baku would be perfect
---
could just ping using the hero power 1 turn before
---
Haha on this side of the world we tighten the screws to fit not to loose. It's often the fakers and losers on the internet pretend to be American on reddit and blame Russia and shill collusion. But guess what your language betray you when you say things like "bloody". I bet you are sweating kid. Your boss in the troll farm knows I am into you ruining your day because you were found on. Time to make another account and try again loser because your ass is mine now. 
---
The wording doesn't say anything about healing ... so I guess it would make sense to be able to heal. I wonder what's the interaction between immune and cards like Amara and Alex. If those cards don't work, then immunes means that you cant change a characters life whatsoever ...
---
I wasn't sure about Sacrificial Pact, because I remember I tried it some time ago, and Malchezar just laughed at me "That can't work on true Eredar lord" something like that. And I said in other comment, I dont have Grand Archivist to cast spell for me, so I tried other decks.
---
I wanted to try if Mechathun would kill him, when he turns into Malchezar and casts Twisting Nether to kill all minions, but I couldn't find good enough deck that would survive all that aggro coming from Nazra. 
---
Dude, emoting isn't trashtalk, you're just oversensetive
---
It seemed like the beta period lasted for years. 
---
Third Kazakus in combination with Brann (wild).
---
Like... What... How...I'm scratching my head and i don't understand how he could be able to do that... It doesn't have any sense to me... WHAT! 
---
Rogue just has so much trouble surviving into the late game, it's hard to see a Rogue combo deck work with Mecha'thun. How fast can it draw, even with Myra's, which cannot be used until combo pieces are found?
---
When in doubt in Hearthstone, just hit the opponent in the face. That's why tempo-style Rogue decks, which will have plenty of nice tools left, will at the very least be more popular than Mecha'thun and Pogo-Hopper.
---
You alright there you seem a little lost, this is hearthstone 
---
plenty of people played Ooze in KnC and Skull was still crazy good. "always assume your opponent has the perfect counter" is the dumbest mistake that this subreddit consistently makes when evaluating new cards.
---
Semantics, they are used with the intention to annoy the opponent.
---
there's a find-a-friend thread at the top of this sub, you'll find more success there
---
Seems like the Brawliseums are a great way to make profit. Too bad I missed both of em!
---
so you did not have the cards before? and you plan to dust them after the HoF?
---
I did. I chose wisely.
---
Rhok’delar shenanigans involving a dire horned Misha, double Bestial Wrath, Kill Command and The Beast Within
---
[Eu]Omega#23739 I can show but you go first
---
well, obviously: double emeriss will never really win you the game. 
---
I’ve been playing wild Mechathun Warlock lately. More than once I have cycled my whole deck, got the Thaurissan discount on my combo pieces and then thrown down Mechathun before realising it was still only turn 9.
---
I have also hastily conceded when someone ratted out my Mechathun only for it to dawn on me that I could have just played Cataclysm from hand. In my defence I am a lot more familiar with the Priest OTK so I’m used to the combo being played entirely from hand.
---
I love this tavern brawl ruleset. Just wished that it wasn’t a brawliseum, making the entrance paid discourages experimenting, which is the main reason why I play tavern brawls.
---
And like arena improvements, specate mode, social features, monthly chests, some help for new players, rank floors, standard and wild, cant open legendary twice, golden portraits, alternate skins, solo content. But sure there is only Tavern Brawl and deck slots that is new. /s
---
What do you think it does better than mech hunter?
---
I had all of the normal cards, crafted all of the golden cards. I plan to keep the relevant golden cards and dust the rest.
---
Incredible
---
Incredible 
---
I will be your death
---
I give up
---
The only legendary I have disenchanted is Nat Darkfisher I think. Any card can turn from crap to great with new cards. 
---
Same goes for epics for me unless they are golden. In that case I can re-craft them for the same amount of dust regardless (I dont care for animations).
---
Huh? What mech squirrel?
---
:3
---
Easy profit if you don't want to keep the cards
---
My coin+mountain giant when I started playing still haunts me.
---
with my luck, I'd roll the prince, but there'd be a nat pagle in my deck somewhere
---
Anyone can own a Tesla 
---
I played mechathun on the first stage then he destroyed it when he arrived by playing twisting nether
---
Same here; 0 dust but trying to get some rares I'm missing from Un'goro and Kobolds, don't feel like buying packs with real money for rares. 
---
3485
---
ok the fact that the run is so low is just insane! good luck with this rng fest called hearthstone singleplayer content, and this is amazing 
---
Let’s not 
---
That way it would be even worse. People would play tryhard decks just to win more gold. Challenge a friend is fun because both me and my opponent play a fun deck and its a lot of fun. 
---
[removed]
---
and so what's your concern ?
---
I loved this brawl *so much* that I hit the daily gold cap playing it on its last day. Experimenting in the beginning was fun, slowly moving towards the best deck was interesting, playing the best deck in mirrors was still incredibly skill testing and rewarding, but it still maintained a level of power spikes to make Super Cool Stories from it!  
---
  
---
I understand that this brawl was not for everyone, but My God was it for me!  
---
I spent the last two days of it playing Spectral Pillager Rogue (deck code at the bottom), with which I consistently pulled of Ridiculous Storm Wins on turns 3 or 4. I even managed the perfect turn 2 on the play win once! That was Insane!!!  
---
I’m pretty sure my records this brawl were: two 12-2s, one 11 wins, four 10 wins, one 9 wins, five 8 wins, one 7 wins, one 6 wins, five 5 wins, one 4 wins. I guess that means I must have played it like 21 times in the time available. And went Gold positive the whole time. God I loved it.  
---
Miniature warfare and brawlisium are my two favourite brawls other than top 2 or top 3 (though those would be Terrible brawlisium modes) and honestly it would be difficult for there to be a better brawl in my books. I love hearthstone games that are fast, I love hearthstone games that are skill testing, I love hearthstone games that let me do cool and Powerful things, especially repeatedly. Those aren’t things that usually you could get all in one, but like, Damn could I get everything I wanted here.  
---
I just wished they hadn’t closed entry with 6 hours left to go. You could pretty easily finish a run an in hour with a strong deck, maybe a little longer. And I would have Loved to play another run or two. 
---
AAECAYO6Aga0A8UEmwXJxwKmzgLf7wIMtAGcArQC7QLGBYgHpAeGCdvjApfnArSGA+uJAwA=

TLDR: brawl was for me, favourite brawl ever, lots and lots of gushing

And did Malchezar died? Or was it something like, "I am true Eredar lord that wont work"
---
You are truly blessed.
---
Classic packs.
---
He died, was pretty funny
---
Pokemon is less RNG heavy than Hearthstone is though.
---
Nice! Keep it up!!
---
Last month was the last in like 6 months I played enough to get past 15. The new ranked system helps a lot.
---
For me, getting to 15 is a nice difference in rewards! Remember that if you get to 11 you start next month ranked 15.
---
At first, buy witchwood packs. till you hit a legendary card. One should be withint the first 10.
---
Then you do the same with boomsday and rastakahns rumble.
---
After that I suggest to buy classic packs till you hit the legendary.
---
By then you should have  a nice little collection of cards. And by then the next expansions come out.
---
Succ* him
---
Mechathun also kills the other karazhan boss who is immune unless she has Romulo, power word glory him then stall till mechathun
---
why not the others tho? aren't they better?
---
"Perfectly reasonable" might be an overkill.
---

If you don't have them in their regular form yes. You missed a flair for your post by the way.

read up on dust-guides for the HoF, there is alot of false information spreaded from people who lack the skills to do basic math :P
---
I'm really not arguing against you. I'm merely suggesting what action you can take in the current environment. I'm not sure why you're lecturing me. 
---
So ask them not to?  
---
by assuming everyone that emotes you is wishing you cancer
---
a well timed secret in mage (counter spell, spellbinder) can derail a meca'thun druid's plan. Skulking giest can do the same.  
---
I just crossed 8,000 gold this morning. I buy exactly 90 packs with gold each expansion and no more between releases, although this year I have some extra calculations to make with the PvE content. Not exactly sure what I'll do here. I like collecting different elements of this game, so most likely I'll be plopping down gold for the PvE content and settling for fewer packs.
---
I don't chase pity timers because Blizzard always tends to throw additional packs at us throughout the year. I have found that chasing pity timers is a net negative for my collection. Many times these bonus packs will contain legendaries, thus making the pity timer chase pointless.
---
I was fortunate to open golden copies of Gloom Stag and Glitter Moth and will craft golden second copies of each to disenchant after rotation. I stand to get quite a bit of dust back from the HoF, over 8K I think. Should be in a good spot next month.
---
I have 4800 gold now and will have 9k dust when the rotation happens, time for a new main deck 
---
WeirdChamp
---
You lack both reading comprehension and a 3-digit IQ.
---
Annoying as in his tone conveys over confidence?
---
I like that I got a pack and 25 dust this morning for clicking the "Tavern Brawl" button last week even though I never got around to constructing a deck. More of that, please.
---
Bingo. I'll accept maybe they were grabbing a drink or using the can as they waited for the game to begin but if they rope twice...get comfortable, because I'll be the bigger asshole. We'll be here for the next 40 mins. 
---
Ranks have nothing to do with how good you are but rather how long you can grind. Any schmuck can pilot a deck that's given to them, but good players can create their own decks that a top tier.
---
Higher in thread: 
---
&gt; Highest value card gets refunded so youd get 3200 from the golden copy
---
&gt;In the case of glitter moth, doomguard, naturalize, ect you get the best 2 copies refunded. So if you have one gold but 2 regular you would get 1 gold refunded 1 regular refunded
---
In your case you will be getting only 6400 from refunds, and then have choice to disenchant golden legendaries for +3200 dust and/or regular legendaries for +800 dust.
---
or hex
---
4 turns with N'Zoth. By then, you've killed their M'Thun for them.
---
Honestly, this doesn't surprise me at all.
---
I always thought Keleseth seemed powerful, but never bothered to craft him before he became meta. The nerfs were irrelevant to Keleseth's power level.
---
Because he’d have to play mechathun naked, with cata still in his hand.  Solemn would play leeroy and attack it and that’s lights out.
---
Facing a [Pandaria cardback](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/File:Card_back-Pandaria.png), which is the cardback reward for playing that first season, is pretty intimidating.
---
Should have probably said earlier that he missed lethal the turn before as he used Twisting Nether to remove MY Board, couldnt fit everything in one clip
---
Twilight Acolyte, Blood Razor, and Crystal Lion are three cards rotating out that I'd love to see in standard. All of them require you to time your plays and build around them in your deck. None of them are too OP, and they all complement the core mechanics of their classes
---
Trading the 80g quest on NA, you go first but I will show the quest by challenging you (Check my post history, I've done this a bunch and never scammed).
---
**Connor#1207 on NA**
---
Wrong, Baku also counts the cards in you hand, thus foiling my attempts at quest-even decks.
---
equality sets to 1 health, so now hooktusk and amalgam have 1 base HP, which gets buffed to 2 by southsea captain, so when wild pyro deals 1 damage to them, they have 1 HP left
---
Played it once with my Priest deck with half of it nothing but board clears and silences and the other half fuel for Shadowreaper (got to 5 wins surprisingly). After that, didn't touch it again. Don't like paying for brawls and especially ones that are filled with nothing but OTKs and Aggros. Definitely one of the worst ones.
---
🙏🏻
---
I think they only read the title, I was initially thrown off after reading it.
---
If malto became a playable mage hero skin I'd totally use it permanently. Especially with the recent Jaina nerf.
---
where . is . my . golden . pack :(
---
yup the whole "dies to doomblade" thing all over again
---
Absolutely guttered. I’m still doing ok with BoarTK I guess but it ain’t amazing 
---
Finally, after 3 days of waiting...
---
Dr Boom round 3 coming Thursday. Last one too by the sounds of it! Sounds like we’ll get the actual reveal either Thursday or next week.
---
RIP the Magatha dream.
---
Reno is far worse design than Baku or Genn. At least those are consistent, Reno is a complete crapshoot on if you get any benefit from your deckbuilding restriction.
---
LOL everyone got pranked
---
The problem with that is obviously an increase in the cost of the game.
---
Seems to me we are getting Magatha and Hagatha 
---
I usually save up my gold in the last 2 months of an expansion. Got about 3k at the monent.
---
Last xpac I had 10k saved up for rastarumble.
---
I've been wanting to run this by someone before committing...is this how this works? Or am I missing something?
---
I own non-golden Genn/Baku.
---
I craft golden Genn/Baku.
---
Result:
---
-3200 dust (to craft golden) + 3200 dust (HoF compensation) + 1600 dust (disenchant golden copy) = net +1600 dust and I get to keep non-golden Genn/Baku
---
Yeah that's Hagatha and Boom no questions about it 
---
i think nefarian is next
---

80g quest trade! NA - Pravwlum#1796. I’ll show and you go first please. I’ll do suicidelock for quick games. 
---
If this comment hasn’t been edited, I still have the quest. 
---
Sooo, it will take a while before you do that combo again
---
A Goblin, an Orc and a Kobold walk into a tavern...
---
They said they will start turning all 3 expansions of the year in to one story starting this year, but it's great that they are starting off by combining some older expansions.
---
there's a million and one ways to beat him now. most top tier decks can do it without much effort
---
I’d bet next week. Doing dr.Boom AND a reveal on the same day seems like a bit much. They’d probably rather spread it out a little to drive even more hype/speculation 
---
Wait so there's 5 of them, but  we only know of   Hagatha, Boom, Tog, and Fortune Teller? Who is the 5th one? 
---
How long can this go on
---
Next one is obviously Dr. 7 the greatest.
---
I still wonder if we will get this team as neutral legendaries... Having 2 Hagathas and 2 Booms in standart feels strange...
---
[One turn later.]
---
Oh! I can see it now! 
---
I'm so unreasonably sad about it. Kinda disappointing, not going to lie.
---
Probably King Rastakhan
---
Yeah that happened to me yesterday too and I've never seen that bug before 
---
I think Boombot is next.
---
Maybe the 5th is a new character who is like the boss of the group?
---
If Dr. Boom is the last teammate I wonder what the last card will be for...
---
For druid, I'd like to see mire keeper or raven idol come back.
---
I don't really care anymore because I think those other sites you mentioned are much better sources at this point anyway. 
---
I've said it before but there is a middle ground between OP and Trash that they could've reached. Silence and Holy Smite are two Priest that aren't ubiquitous or meta warping, but decent utility cards and also teach new players are about various mechanics (i.e. damage spells, silence effect).
---
I remember I was able to beat and mecha-thun warlock in a similar fashion with control shaman; I discovered a ancestral spirit, played it on one of his minions, and he didn't realize that the combo wouldn't work as a result. Fun times. 
---
Mad Bomber confirmed.
---
Bingo
---
I'm probably not the smartest person in this subreddit. But might the last one be some goblin? Because the fortuneteller clearly hinted that the upcoming one makes explosions. 
---
Oh look, it was Hagatha all along. I really didn't get why people thought Magatha was at all likely, it was really obvious this was a 'bringing together previous Hearthstone villains' thing going on.
---
Please just show us new cards! 
---
He's not a villain. 
---
dr boom obvieously
---
Weird that they're recruiting villains who are already in standard. Why not bring back old iconic villains instead? 
---
Terrible. Don't want Brawls that are pay to play. End of story.
---
Okay im so fucking hype now! Maybe boom tribal will become a wild deck lol
---
Aish ure right, my mistake. Well it’s probably someone new
---
Yes.  Read the AMA and decide if you want to come back to a game that continues to get zero QoL improvements at all.  Blizzard devs only push out new cards for players to buy - they don't care about doing anything that makes the game more fun to play.
---
I agree with you. Tempo Storm used to be clearly above everyone else for years. But now, they’ve been passed by, and it seems like they just don’t give a shit to even try anymore. 
---
Wait what?! Can you explain it for me please?
---
Wild is just a miserable format to play in due to the high variance decks being so good.
---
Hmm, they wouldn't put another Hagatha and Dr. Boom in standard now, would they? The villains team might just be for the single player content. I want a Togwaggle hero card though. 
---
Want The Innkeeper as a Hero, or a Card.  
---
I hope so. 
---

Good old times when card draw and removal actually meant something.
---
The wotog Fortune teller is wild
---
lol wow mechacthun hunter? How does that work??
---
It's not about card changes it's about new modes and something to make the game feel fresh.  Card changes aren't enough anymore.
---
How do you get 13k from the HOF? I dont understand how you get that profit unless you have no HOF cards (regular) and crafted them all in gold. 
---
If you do have them regular and craft them gold its not really profit as doing nothing nets you the same.
---
I don't really feel upset about not getting a pack, I just wish there was some bigger sense of celebration.
---
It's nice and I would have welcomed it, sure, but I think what happened has more to do with absolute lack of anything for a pretty big date. Even without the pack, I'd love there to be something to celebrate such an anniversary of the game. I bet devs have got their hands full with all the upcoming stuff, but some celebration would've been welcome.
---
Either way, not too upset and wouldn't want to focus on the negatives. That video was nice. 
---
He'll be the villain when he'll play midrange Hunter on the day one of the expansion.
---
Thank you Mr. Hearthstone.
---
Shadow Visions isn't used to fish for Psychic Scream a lot of the time

Why did they call Hagatha "new" and put a tauren totem up as her symbol? Looks almost as if they intentionally led us wrongly to Magatha.
---
This is some serious dedication. Nice job. 
---
I got excited when I saw the first video. Watched all 30 seconds of it and was like.... okay. If they’re trying to hype us up it’s not working 
---
I wonder if this could have been better as a thing with reduced rewards but daily free attempts. Maybe a 50 gold sort of thing with plays once at the beginning (experimentation), once on Friday (more meta knowledge), and once on Sunday (the final farewell). Otherwise would appreciate a fourth loss.
---
EDIT
---
Rastakhan's Rumble all the way
---
Last year tha expansion has been announced the 12 march and thats tomorrow so...
---
How on earth is it a buff
---
I can’t fuckin believe Boommaster Flark is gonna be in the team-up!!!
---
If you're playing against literally any deck except for a fatigue deck discarding cards means nothing. It's basically look at 3 cards keep one out other two bottom of your deck. Granted, tracking over Kath beasts is a bit of a bummer.
---
Ragnaroi
---
Thank you for being you
---
My bet: The 5th is Rafaam and he's imprisoned in Violethold and we're going to do a prison break to bust him out.  
---
Next expansion had an uldum-esque look to it so we're going after some relic he knows about involving bronze dragons.  
---
Last expansion said relic is used to mess with the timeline somehow.  
---
My hype level was at a solid 2/10, and this video has certainly not increased it.
---
Oooh, I see, interesting! that combo looks really limited, but I bet it’s hella fun to pull off, nice
---
I could get behind an illidan dressed in drag that summons 2/1 Rainbows of Azzinoth.
---
I get it, but think that from the design team's point of view it creates a lot of extra work and potential problems. Everyone very vocally complains about problem cards so there's a lot of pressure to address things quickly, but they also have to take into account play stats so that they don't just destroy tier 2 decks. They also get flack when they nerf cards too. A lot goes into making new cards and changing them and it doesn't make sense to bank on printing cards that they plan to nerf.
---
Change Mage to "Random enemy character" and this sound pretty interesting to be honest.
---
He has to play Excess Mana to empty his hand, so it is relevant.
---
Yup, that's why the dropped the "heroes of warcraft" moniker a few years back.
---
I still sing the Gadgetzan and Karazhan songs when I’m alone. They’re crazy catchy. 
---
Agreed. I wasn't an MSOG fan but this would be a hilarious time to bring back Don Han'cho.
---
The original X-Men Suivide Squad series starred a bunch of D-list villains (the most prominent was an australian boomerang-throwing antagonist to the Flash named Captain Kangaroo). That kind of structure would have worked so much better.
---
Shown: Fatigue counter being relevant because Excess Mana is in hand. 
---
I'd be nice but maybe a little petty.  We're getting something like 4 packs at the end of the month.
---
Yes.
---
But i like golden cards and I get a little profit for example:
---
Dusting two Doomguards = +40 dust
---
Crafting two golden Doomguards = - 1600 Dust and +1600 on rotationday
---
Keeping two Doomguards = +200 Dust on Rotation day
---
So Im just lowering my gain at this point.
---
1/80 for common
---
1/4 for rares
---
1/4 for epic
---
1/4 for legendarys
---
Since I keep floation on dust (not investing in any 'might be good' legendary on release) I dont need high profits. 
---
This is literally always the case with every piece of content in existence. Reddit fan theories are always crazy interesting, so you get excited. Then the actual story isn't as interesting and everyone is bummed.
---
Just ask /r/westworld
---
Right,  it's used to fish for what you need. So you need less aoe in your list when you can fish it when you need it. 
---
I’m still holding out hope that they’re making this team to break old villains from wild out of violet hold, fingers crossed.
---
"Hey guys, instead of announcing the expansion then sitting in silence for 2 weeks, lets just chop up our trailer and release it over the usual 2 weeks of silence!  That will definitely keep the hype!" 
---
Oh I did, I don't play anymore, I just come to drop what I think are witty quips every now and again in the general discussion. 
---
Imagine getting this upset to a fucking prologue video which might not have anything to do with what the expansion is about.
---
Maybe I’m in a small minority, but I’ve never been a huge fan of the musical style. I’ve never really cared much for musicals, Disney or otherwise, though. 
---
So....are you triggered by all the downvotes you are getting? Cause at least the emotional response you have to emotes can be misplaced, but here in this thread you actually have people who disagree with you and think you are being an over reacting whiner. So its much more personal. 
---
I'm assuming they are to lazy/ busy to balance properly. Like I said. 
---
Theoretically? You'd have to pick one, since they wouldn't work with each other. I'd go for Kazakus personally - I don't feel like Don Han'Cho made much of an impact, and I dread the return of the Jade Golems with Aya Blackpaw.
---
I feel like none of them really work in a team-up scenario though. Their whole thing is fighting over Gadgetzan with each other - what could possibly convince any of them to basically give up that fight to be one part of a larger group?
---
Remember that the Original Dr. Boom didn't even have any real voice line. Just screaming.
---
I think they wanted all of the villains to be "Hearthstone" villains. That is, Hagatha, The Fortune Teller, and Togwaggle are all characters that originated from Hearthstone, so I think the adventure raid boss villains are off the table. Boom is the exception, but he's more of a Hearthstone character than a WoW one by this point.
---
I agree though and wished we could see Rafaam or the Gadgetzan villains come back.
---
i know it might be a stretch but i’m going to go out on a limb and assume she is talking about Dr. Boom
---
4 packs at the end of season? for what?
---
I care how you feel. &lt;3
---
So that more people playing the game will recognize them. I would personally prefer Patches the Pirate.
---
There was an elaborate post that explained countless hints that Hagatha was not the one responsible for the curse of the ~Blackwald~~ Witchwood. Unfortunately I can't find it now.
---
But maybe we learn more about her background story now
---
Wait. So you're telling me Naxx is out?
---
Of course there is no hope to bring back old effects for Pagle and Tinkmaster.. they will sell us new cards with "more fun" mechanics.
---
video was nice but theyre using old characters. Kind of underwhelming and unexciting
---
The person who loses should lose half life, god I hate that card
---
You forgot the mighty Bomb Squad!
---
Most of this stuff is just underlying frustration with the state of the game.  If people were happy with the game they'd be playing and not typing.
---
The hype of the HoF announcements made things positive for a while and something to look forward to but that is fading.
---
PogChamp NAXX PogChamp IS PogChamp OUT!? PogChamp
---
This Leroy is absolutely terrible and would never be played.
---
If the game doesn’t die from lack of...well anything new.
---
Haha, I live!
---
The fact that it’s the whispers of the old gods fortune teller got me to go back and watch the trailier for whispers, and yeah, the whispers trailer is way, way better than these teasers.
---
I hope there’s an actual trailer after these teasers.
---
Can somebody explain this for me?
---
Got about 3300 gold right now, around 8k dust, and should be getting almost 5k dust from HoF. Plus maybe close to 20k dust if I got rid of all dupes and goldens. 
---
Hoping I am good. Always like to open at least 50 packs on expansion day. I MIGHT consider a small preorder if they do another one but can't justify the money for the 50 pack one.
---
for hearthstone lore yes, but hearthstone is based off warcraft. that why people are speculating violet hold and such. zuljin is good now, but was a warleader for the horde in warcraft during the second war in warcraft. though him having one arm is after he turned good so iunno.
---
Although if its now a rare instead of a legendary, it shouldn't have a proper pronoun name. 
---
Maybe just "Doomguard" instead? 
---
The frogurt contains potassium benzoate.
---
While this expansion still seems really cool, I think the chances of getting Rafaam or Kael Thuzad again seems to be lower now.
---
This. While the removal of the entrance fee would allow for further experimentation, I firmly believe there isn't any other class or card that could hard counter what tools rogue had at its disposal for this event. 
---
Spirit of the Shark, the classic set of spells, and spectral pillager are just too powerful of cards to be in a game mode where your minions costs 1 mana.
---
We just needed a bit of balance changes implemented to make this brawl more fun for everyone and to make it feel less oppressive when playing non-rogue strategies.
---
Also, by including the entrance fee, we are able to receive more lucrative rewards for how well you play, compared to a "one and done" play for a pack and no further incentive for playing.
---
Let’s stash that away for later* 
---
You've seen her before but we hardly know anything about her.
---
Maybe now we learn who or what is actually behind the stuff going on in the Witchwood and what her motives and backstory are.
---
I am thinking it has more to do with the story and solo content too. Doubting rehashed versions of those cards in the expansions this year.
---

---

---
I think that out of the two examples you posted, the Firefly one should definitely be taken down, but the Vilespine one I would keep. 
---
The reason is the Firefly one is just an image of the card artwork with a clever title. At least the Vilespine one has some text to it explaining why it was an awesome card.  Also the Vilespine one doesn't have as much karma because its not just an image that people scroll over and upvote, like the Firefly one.
---
&gt;You officially made it and can'd drop below rank ~20~**15** in the future.

Ok, so what if: these 5 characters on the teasers are not really our new five legendary focuses and all. They are the team that is going to be breaking the real enemies free from Violet Hold.   
---
The Fortune Teller is a symbol of Whispers of the Old Gods. Even with their might, the Old Gods have been defeated. Not much of their corruption survived to infect the new sets. We bowed down to some of them, but eventually, they were beaten.  
---
But in Karazhan, we were heroes. We save Medivh, and lock Malchezaar back in its dimension. In Mean Streats, we joined a gang, raised hell, and painted the streets with the left overs of pirates and potions. Un'goro was a journey that had no real enemy.   
---
Then comes the Knights of the Frozen Throne. Life (Hs) imitates art (WoW), so we lost to Arthas. But instead of the bs "holy light" saving us against the Lich King, he wins. Arthas finally did it. Even when you play a DK card against him, he says "I have already won." Because he has, we were no match to the power of DK cards.   
---
And then we invade the catacombs of the Kobolds, and wipe them clean. Classes that have no weapons now had powerful stuff like Aluneth, Skull of Man'ari, Branch of the World Tree. We raid the gold, the kobolds, the candles. Togwaggle is devastated. In Witchwood, we stop Hagatha from destroying Guilneas, and the old witch sees all her work undone. In Boomsday, Dr. Boom tries to use its lame puzzles to defeat us... and fails again, like every goblin invention.   
---
The characters that are being chosen are in a chronological order of the events since the rotation of sets began, and we are seeing the "losers" in the teasers. As we hear in the first one "It is my crystal ball, I answer the call!", this idea might not be from themselves. Instead, someone, or a more powerful group, is summoning them together, so they can escape Violet Hold in Dalaran. If done well, this storyline could be stretched throughout the year. We see them escaping, we pursue them in the next one, we capture them in the end of the year. There's still time for people like Rafaam (another "beautiful loser") and other new and old faces show up.   
---
Or maybe we get four reprints and Zayle the Shadow Cloak can be their leader. 
---
I run skulking Geist in 100% of my wild decks specifically as a fuck you to Druid.

Today i read a comment on a post, quoting Ben Brode on the topic of Hearthstones anniversary. Something along the lines of having several of these (open beta/pc release/...) and that they basically use the rotation as time of said celebration .
---
Thanks everyone, I think I'll wait for the next rotation and craft the next big thing. I can always use Stonehill Defender anyways and trust to luck.
---
Hearth Stonebrew gets milkshake ducked
---
Ok, now I know why "Nax is out?" became a popular running gag. Over 3 months from tease to release is hard.
---
Those other game companies care if they disappoint their fans and player base.
---
also true. you wouldnt normally see hagatha and dr boom working with tog. plus the fortune teller is an oc. just my speculation. from a design point its a good way to introduce what is usually the most hyped card of the expansion.
---
Why would you think it’s not single player? They said it was for single player
---
Yep, it’ll be typical marketing trash. Not sure why people even care at this point 
---
It has to be all lack of skill, and not the cards, learn how to play the game, because frankly there are many cheap decks that can rank up with even a low skill level 
---

---
Just quests since rastakan release, I only bought 5 packs since
---
Fun card, great art, def gonna miss her in standard. Cool seeing the steps getting to the art we all recognize.
---
lmao birthdays? whats so special about the day u came out of the womb? I dont value sentiment of anniverseries because they’re just arbitrary events created by people and hold no legitimate significance. pssh
---
I think it's going to be in four days. The videos have been released with two days in between, the next one should drop on wednesday. It's something about Dr. Boom and in the end she turns around the last card. Speculating time. And in 4 days we get a video about the fourth card, which will reveal the next expansion.
---
So the plan here is that they don't only want to have a connecting narrative in the new expansions they are trying to assemble old expansions too.
---
How can you miss it honestly? There it is, "AON. XOA" with big ass letters. 
---
he prepped the espionage, which then costs 1 and that gives him 10 cards from the opponent class which cost 1, he then got a card the next turn that draws a beast from ure deck and it health doubles, he then got tarauntus ( or however u spell that ) which normally is a 10 mana 12-12 but now it costs 1 due to the espionage, and his health got doubled by the other card, making it a 1 mana 12-24
---
I think it was to fit the rhyme scheme but yeah people were saying it probably won’t be a totally new character since it came out
---
Because you have to restrict your deck to only large demons to make it worthwhile. People didn't think that was going to happen, especially when many assumed it risked being destroyed by ooze anyway. 
---
Honestly if they give us the Dr.Boom vid today and reveal it all tomorrow I'll be happily content with that. Make we wait much longer and It's gonna start to drag.
---
I guess if me not being a demanding person "enables" Blizzard...then ok. I just know how to look at the big picture and take Hearthstone for what it is.

Reminds me of Boomsday's "wow what a deal on KFT packs" bundle.  At that point KFT was more than halfway to Wild already, the value of KFT packs had already depreciated to the point where the sale price should've just been the normal price tbh.

Am I the only one that assumed that Hagatha was an old crone, and thinks the fact she is kinda buff and outrunning dogs is hilarious?
---
Wonder if that was his best out? I have definitely done similar things as a final Hail Mary to win the game if I see I’m running out of win conditions. I always wonder if my opponent thinks I’m an idiot.
---
There’s narrow counters like hakkar and there’s half counters like mojomaster and skulking Geist.
---
It’s honestly not worth teching for, no mechathun deck is that good. If you are playing intelligently by counting their cards etc, you can often win in unorthodox ways anyway using normal cards.
---
For instance I was playing against mechathun druid and he had simply a 3/2 pyromancer on board with combo in hand and I had a 1/2 on board and leeroy in hand. I was at around 12!hp mind you (he had an auctioneer+pyro survive a long time)
---
So I rammed leeroy into his pyro and traded off 1 of my 1/1s into a leeroy token, leaving him with a 1/1 he can’t get rid of. He then took a shitton of fatigue damage and ultimately died 
---
man i wish
---
Start with 1 mana, prep espionage, 0 mana left, prep fan, which costs 0, pull 1 cost tyrantus, play coin to gain 1 mana and play tyrantus.
---
Note: this was done on a new account and used only the packs and legendaries you get for free. The account at the time was only a day old.
---
Anyone have a espionage list from a streamer or something that's decent(I know it will still be bad)?

---
The thing that's bugging me about the rotation is that the justification doesn't seem to align with my perception of the problem. I would argue that Druids have had decks "where card advantage doesn’t matter" before Taunt Druid and Mecha'thun/Hakkar miracle (most Malygos builds of old), and Naturalize didn't see play then [citation needed]. I think Naturalize started becoming a problem when Druids started getting motivation to use it as something other than a removal tool.
---
If that was the real problem they wanted to address (which I suspect it is) I think Naturalize could have just as easily been "fixed" for indefinite use in Standard by restricting it to only target enemy minions. So then the question becomes to nerf or to rotate? That question is the hard one IMO, and I think they may have decided to simplify things for the justification they posted with the rotation announcement.
---
There is a lot of speculation that the new free card will do just that. It says it gives you 1 of 5 deck recipes

As much as I enjoy seeing Arthas in Hearthstone, I also enjoy seeing Tortollan in Warcraft, and I wouldn't mind if they kept going in that direction by creating silly side-story that fit in the grand scheme.  Older expansions (and KotFT) can be seen as drunk tales, but it's difficult to imagine them in the context of main story, where expansion like Un'Goro, Gadgetzan, or Witchwood can easily be part of the canon. 
---
In any case, if those 4 villains are the  final bosses of the adventure, there is still a lot of rooms to bring the rest back.  And any "League of Villain" will need to an opposite force to counter them, which probably mean  the League of Explorer, Toki, or something.
---
Very aggressive deck, i like it overall. A lot of people saying drop ornery tortoise but it doesnt really matter if you take 10 damage when the game is over on turn 6. Not sure how I feel about jeweled mccaw. Its okay but i might prefer a different 1 mana beast. Emerald reaver would be okay, and young dragonhawk could be good if you can adapt to +3 attack or +1/+1 with razormaw on 2. Macaw is okay though if you would be running out of cards though since you dont have masters call. Id craft that asap though. It is too good not to play if you can afford it.
---
It just comes with the year, they're doing their best to make it drag on.
---
the person asking her to scry and call them together maybe? which would work w/ one of the bigger boys like rafaam , kel-thu-motherfucking-zad or nefarian
---
What spell? OP topdecked tyrantus, so I'm assuming that you draw tyrantus after playing the fan
---
he didn't drew Tyrantus, he used 1 mana to play predator instinct the spell that tutored tyrantus for him. 
---
Please stop, I can't live with this idea in my brain. 
---
They were introduced in the same order of the expansions that came out:
---
KaC (Togg), WW (hagatha), Bms (boom) so the next one might be from RR.
---
I entered several bugs against wine trying to get it to work 15+ years ago. Glad to hear that's all worked out. That said, I don't think wine is the best way for WotC to monetize the iOS/Mac user community.

---
Wait, did people in the Victorian era actually consider ankles naughty, or are you just making stuff up?
---
This is my biggest gripe with Hearthstone. I don't give a shit about Hagatha. Give me established Warcraft characters on cards. Hell, give me at least a semi relevant character from Wows history. 
---
So it be new cards ye be after

Thanks for sharing this.

I thought it was really great to see how a work of art becomes it's final form. No one really knows what it is they are making while they make it, lots of decisions are made a long the way, different visions for each iteration, maybe feedback from others changes it until it's "finished".  
---
Usually when I see a work of art I am amazed someone could envision this entire thing and make it, but that's not really how it happens. It changes every step along the way, and the current version of it at each iteration affects what the next will be!
---
I think it's a bit of an overstatement to say 'most of us ere excited about the magatha speculation'.  The internet makes it really easy to assume everyone agrees with you, but I'd bet most hearthstone players don't know who magatha is.  I agree that the pace is slow, but it was unlikely that the hearthstone all-star team they seem to be putting together would introduce a character from WoW lore who has never shown up in hearthstone, especially when hagatha was such an obvious guess.  
---
I play oondasta hunter with stitched tracker to get more king krush. I try to end it early but other times rexxar helps
---
Maybe they are going for seven Dr Booms?
---
yeah i have seen a lot of people, even my self ,bring cards that dont work in the brawl , also the balance of classes was not the best , they needed to ban some cards from the brawl (like malygos )
---
This is the deck I use. Probably could optimize it better for climbing ranks but I play this for fun not to climb.

Normally we should have received the announcement of the expansion already and the expansion would come out in Early April. Giving us a month or so to digest every card reveal one by one.
---
This time, they plan to make HCT Finals in late April. This means that the expansion won't come out earlier than that and this means we got almost two months to wait.
---
This is killing us
---
Happy birthday!

I can show but you go first
---
All the character shown thus far (except for the fortune teller) have had their days ruined by the players. Toggwaggle got looted, Hagatha got routed, Boom we ruined his plans...whose the last though?
---
Maybe this is what they meant by “Double”, “Two”, and “Twins”. They’re just reusing characters. 
---
Yeah I don’t get why people are pissed about it not being Magatha. Did anyone really think a Togwaggle/Magatha tag team made any sense whatsoever? I can see being a little disappointed that they went with Hagatha in the first place since she’s pretty bland but people pissed that it’s not Magatha are being pretty dumb. It was clearly going to be Hagatha the whole time. People just need to be a tiny bit patient so we can see where they’re going with it before losing their minds about it
---
And I think there’s probably still a pretty good chance they do something for the anniversary, they usually announce everything at the same time so it’ll probably be announce some kind of celebration for it when they officially announce the new expansion 
---
The one who makes things go boom. Hmm who could that be
---
&gt;Yes I know pre expansion is the best time for all of us  
---
I'd argue it's the worst.  The meta usually ends up at it's worst at any point between sets being released and the drip feed of cards is just plain annoying as opposed to having it all announced at once.  
---
That's my thought anyway.  
---
I tend to wait until it's all announced and then start reading through the card list to get an idea of what looks good and what does not.  
---
Not that it matters as f2p since I won't have most of them anyway unless they make a meta deck.  ;)
---
What a terrible media planning...
---
Given the bullshit tendencies the people on this subreddit have, they'd probably choose the ability to discard 5 gold over this
---
basically
---
Appreciate it.  I just have a hard time making a list cause there's so many things you need(obviously it will never be super competitive).  For instance I look at yours and you have striders and espionage but zero card draw outside of 2 FoKs...seems a little bit crazy to me.
---
Is this just all single player crap?
---
It's their birthday - you should be giving them something.  
---
Fuck birthday's if people expected me to give them something when they occurred.
---
I'll take that as well. Itd be nice
---
one night in karazhaaaaaaaaannnn
---
they already get the time I could be spending doing scientific research
---
Today was its official release mate
---
How do you find this?
---
Opps ,sorry, thanks to reminding me i allmost forget  before going to sleep
---
I mean, it wasn’t that strong. It’s winrate was never that good. It just felt awful to play against.
---
Doesn't [Voidcaller] have the possibility of putting a demon from hand onto the board?  So, nether there to draw out the demon in hand and then cataclysm next turn to "ensure" the win.  Unless he had reads that Solem didn't have any more demons in hand I guess.
---
More like a shiny one... still could taste bad :/
---
No, I’m talking about playing slow midrange/control decks against aggro decks.
---
E.g. slow midrange deck vs zoo
---
Slow midrange deck against rogue
---
Slow midrange deck against odd pally
---
Fun fact is that James Rayman created Baku in an act of spite according to u/hadidjahb in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8a0vhe/i_love_the_flavor_of_witchwood_so_far_but_i_would/dx3vfdv/?context=3):
---
&gt;Baku's character didn't actually come from a lore-first angle, but she's got fun stories too. We needed a some art of a giant snake for... some piece, it wasn't Baku because Baku didn't exist yet, and the artist sent back a big ol' python coiled around a tree. And the outsource manager was like "We need a bigger snake than that." **So the artist, feeling saucy, sent back a screw-you bigger-than-a-fucking-village snake.** And we were like "Well, we needed some badass art for Genn's Odd-nemesis," so she got promoted from rando card to legendary.
---
\[Emphasis added.\]
---
What animal is that? 
---
Kel´Thuzad, Nefarian, Malchezzar, Rafaam and Patches. The real evil squad.
---
I think most people realise it's gonna be broken at some point. All it needs is a high mana cost pirate that doesnt suck ass. Realy limits Blizzards design space in printing a card like that.
---
lol whoops.
---
I think Shaman would summon the Searing Totem, it’s definitely the worst one imo 
---
Has the Hall Of Faming date been announced yet? I don’t wanna miss the deadline to craft the cards
---
Is that why you're spamming it 5 different time?
---
1/3 My ass. If you get a quarter of the way there with just the pre-purchase that's some pretty good luck.
---
Have you tried Augmented Elekk?  If yes, how did that go?
---
Quest simply changes that base stats of minions at hand you are changed and the hex/polymorph enters in the board aura. Or would you make that minions who gives stats/hp to other minions would simply not work? 
---
She* :/^) 
---
If it was the same content then it would be considered spam. Its the updated odds, which is the whole point of the page.... sooooooo YES! haha
---
If it's Baku I am quitting Hearthstone. 
---
Thanks for pointing that out, I was mistaken.
---
the battlecry gives +2/+2. rogue quest sets all base stats to 4/4. it worked before pogo with Edwin, he would still get the buff from each card played.
---
so since its a battlecry it adds on to the passive after its been summoned.
---
summon &gt; battlecry &gt; resolve.
---
minions get set to 4/4 on the summon step, and then the battlecry adds stats to the 4/4 body.
---
Love seeing these process posts, Matt! Keep it up!
---
I liked this because it was a deckbuilding challenge. I like Brawls that have different metas. I hate the Brawls where you cannot decide what is in your deck. It is the one thing I want to do in the game is build decks.
---

You’re right, only good answer to that at 5 is shadow word death + any 2 drops are checked by the buffed raptor.Worst case scenario you keep board advantage, best case is snowball.

The now official song made by Ben Brode
---
I stooped for 8 months and the return felt like a blast.
---
I am burned out by this meta (odd warrior, odd pala, big priest, every turn is 100% predictable) though.
---
If april dissapoints me I might quit again for a while.
---
Ty for the clarification
---
So a golden baku is just a faster way for your 500 wins golden hero hp reward ;)
---
Is there a specific time that it happens? There’s no timestamp on your link 
---
The hearthstone dev's have constantly said they need to think many years ahead when they produce cards.
---
They are probably just "in the know" about WoW being on it's last expansion and so are taking the logical step of trying to make an independant story.
---
Because Equality at 4 mana is still a better card than Shrink Ray, and statistics back this up (Equality is played twice as often in both standard and wild at 4 mana).
---
Also...even if that wasn’t the case...they’re both rares, and you get full dust refund from the equality nerf, so if Shrink Ray was better (which it’s not) you could just dust equality and craft shrink ray.
---
I had a hard time with the Rogue. Took me so many goddamn tries. The Kobold dungeons are even worse. I've only completed 4 of them 
---
There is actually : https://www.twitch.tv/videos/63662992?t=05h38m20s

Because Apple is a sentient being 
---
It's on the Hearthstone youtube channel.
---
Spell damage + 3 and chaos cards took me a few got to toki's final boss 3 times before it worked!
---
Try Eternal
---
This is the new oddest Paladin deck I have ever seen
---
I never thought that when they said "new", they meant someone new to hearthstone, so I don't think that was misleading.
---
As for the totem, i don't know enough about orc or tauren lore to say anything about that
---
Bran -&gt; Gnome -&gt; Zola -&gt; Gnome = rip combos.
---
I haven't finished with warrior or warlock yet
---
I was excited for Hagatha particularly because we didn’t get enough on her during her expansion. I want to find out more about her lore and character! Instead of it being another dropped concept 
---
&gt; on it's last expansion
---
Wait, are you saying they are gonna stop developing WoW?
---
Any source for that?
---
Thanks!
---
Violet Hold.

Helpful support

1 mana 4/4 
---
Get the best luck possible in the game
---
Wait Baku has lore? 
---
you would guess it would in a teaser trailer(which is supposed to give hints)
---
In case you don't get whats going on here, the original guy put the brackets for river crocolisk, then editted his comment to say gnomeferatu.
---
What about the mountains/hills+the flatland? It doesn't look like a swamp. 
---
You’re not making sense. The system can’t be rigged to give everybody bad matchups, because obviously that requires an equal number of opponents who get good matchups...
---
Of course it’s not only random though. We have an mmr (even in casual) and a rank and we’re matched according to that. 
---
Lul so many people ripping you a new one. I'd feel sorry for you if you weren't so absurd.
---
Tldr baku is a snake. Shows how much i pay attention to lore...

The explosive sheep mated with a pre-nerf dreadsteed, their child seeks revenge upon the mortal realms.
---
Maybe I'm missing your point here, but with all the games that are being tracked and analyzed these days, wouldn't we have tons of evidence of this reflected in the stats if it were true?
---
Except by large this is a big day for the community because this is the day the community was created. He's not speaking for everyone on an individual basis he's speaking in respect to the concept of the Community as a whole. This is a big day for the Community as an entity because it is the Community's "birthday" so to speak. Stop being a douche.
---
He's playing Sylvanas on an empty board. Is that a good idea?
---
Maybe he wants to bait out an Assassinate to protect his Core Hound next turn...?
---
And I'm amazed he got her down to 15 health by turn 6 and still has a full hand. Guac-boy better watch out
---
Cault?
---
Imagine if it read "Start of Game: If your deck has no even or odd cost cards..."
---
In Magic, they sometimes design cards around "slush art," or artwork they commissioned and want to use, but the card got deleted from the set or something. The lead designer for that game is very open about that. Having said that, I don't think that's true of pivotal characters. It seems like a really bad idea to tie your marketing to a couple unused pieces.
---
Not that obvious that your own minion attacking can trigger it since that's not something that happens often. The snakes aren't affected by the hysteria either so they just pop up as useless hits for you or your opponent.
---
Tang#1275 NA, online now, trading 80g friend quest, frequent trader here, you can check my history, I can show quest, you go first. 
---
sounds a bit much. we don't want them to breka the bank after all. how about 10.5?
---
&gt; making sense to the lore.
---
And then they make Ragnaros the Lightlord. Yeah, HS doesn't care about the lore
---
My main issue with the way Team 5 does their pre-expansion stuff is they tend to announce it then make it us wait 2-3 weeks before showing many of the cards. I'd rather they just wait an extra week or 2, then make it a steady stream of reveals until release day.
---
Emeriss at 9 mana= overpowered 
---
Emeriss at 10 mana= unplayable 
---
Oof
---
Then people won't be happy about the long wait before the announcement. Some less clever people will probably whine that they didn't know an expansion was coming and didn't save up.
---
The art is beautiful.
---
&gt; i almost feel that all these teases are for the single player
---
Pretty sure they are
---
In terms of hearthstone lore... yeah. Remember they are trying to be their own thing after dropping the hearthstone thing. I think this is just their idea. Besides, right now its the villains, but they have a whole year. They will bring the most notable later. This whole year could be an "all star" in celebration of 5 years.
---
It was always the most aggro deck even in vanilla with super cheap buzzard into hounds burst around turn 7 every game. But I would agree with that guy, the super aggro face hunter build he’s referring to that’s closest to modern aggro hunters came around BRM, I would classify undertaker hunter as a different hunter build from classic aggro hunter. Both oppressive tier 1 aggro hunter decks but dtill different in my opinion
---
i think the fifth one is the player, she will say something like "and the last one IS YOU" and then the adventure trailler rolls in
---
&gt;it just means it’s getting a lot of upvotes AND downvotes
---
Yes, I know that.
---
fortune teller says dr. boom will be the last one she summons though. so it basically means it can't be any character at all.
---
Five villains. Five heroes
---
His opponent having things in play doesn't affect Mecha'thun.

dont let the wise king of the forest see her.

Excessive over nerfing will do that to any class.

Is there a reason for the Druid hate?
