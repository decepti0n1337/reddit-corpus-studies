Underrated comment

It‚Äôs awkward now but we‚Äôre going to be blessing that the minute the overpowered cards rotate out. I‚Äôm happy that they‚Äôre combatting power creep. We had arguably 4 expansions in a row of absurdly overpowered cards before witchwood (MSoG, Un‚ÄôGoro is the arguable part, KFT, and KnC), and I really don‚Äôt think the game was better off.
---
I honestly dont even feel i play that many Hunters. Are they more common? Yeah obviously. But I don't roll my eyes when I see a mirror. Maybe because I'm playing it. Idk lol
---
They played double hallucinations on turn one, and tavern brawl is the hallucinations one so it‚Äôs like the same thing 
---
Yeah that's definitely not normal, but I don't play on a mac so I'm afraid I can't be more helpful than that.

---
Dude I dont even think that the guy that wrote the code for the Hearthstone AI is able to explain how the code works. AI has been stupid AF for years. But it makes for fun moments.
---
Ignoring that you got the Odd/Even versions wrong, over the years Blizzard has printed a number of Shaman Overload cards that allow you to play a minion 1-2 turns earlier than you normally would by ‚Äúoverloading‚Äù your mana for your next turn.  Additionally, Blizzard has printed a number of cards that benefit from board presence/tokens, and in some cases specifically Totems as tokens.  In Wild this has reached a critical mass of cards where Shaman is able to put out oversized minions earlier than most opponents (besides Priest) can deal with them.  Even though most of the cards are fairly coasted factoring in the Overload, getting them out 1-2 turns early allows the deck to take control of the board, even from aggro decks like Odd Rogue and Pirate Warrior, and snowball face damage extremely quickly.
---
Even Shaman also benefits from strong damage spells, including Crackle which utilizes Overload to put out a lot of damage either to a minion or face for cheap that turn; the snowballing nature of Jade cards; and Devolve and Thing From Below both being undercosted.
---
That sounds like a good approach. I think more people would jump in if they felt they could pick and choose which discussion to add to, or start their own freely. I think suggestion topics are a good opener to the thread, especially if hot meta topics are trending after nerfs, a new expansion/patch etc, and you can just see where that discussion goes. Just make it clear it's inviting to any hearthstone related discussion and I think people will join in. 
---
Yes?
---
Odd Mage happened and ungoro will cycle soon. Rip.
---
Yes, it's not like they were up against a deadline and ran out of time to finish it. They actually thought that brawl was good enough.
---
Bad
---
Any kind of aggressive, midrange, or control strategy that doesn‚Äôt rely on ramping up to UI or Spreading plague has been overshadowed for over a year now. 
---
And yes, both of those cards are busted. But they‚Äôre more manageable when they come down on the turn they‚Äôre supposed to, instead of 2, 3, or 4 turns early. 
---
I don't still, I just switched to Odd Mage but I would pair it up with dragons. Look at Brian Kibler's dragon quest priest, my deck was very loosely based on that.
---
Sore loser doesn't inherently mean angry, also means just whiny or complaining about a loss. Which I would think this is, personally, as the complaint is 'these mechanics aren't skillful enough.'
---
I got a Tess off a rogue, free hand and board refill anyone? Oh, and that 2 mana minion to let me shuffle 3 more into my deck, and gral the shark to tutor one of the tesses back out.
---
Outtempo him easily with basically any deck because he's extremely slow.
---
You need to run Kill Command.  The difference between 6 and 7 wolves is not nearly as much as the difference between 0 and 10 face damage in your deck.
---
The old Paper Rock Scissors balancing:
---
* Spell Hunter beats Midrange Hunter
---
* Midrange Hunter beats Deathrattle Hunter
---
* Deathrattle Hunter beats Spell Hunter
---
Looking good Hearthstone.
---
Last time they released an expansion.
---
Seriously though buffed/reworked old cards would be so great, currently you have your collection and generally speaking it deteriorates.
---
Some cards become playable later but generally card archetypes are strong enough to make a card switch from one end of the playability spectrum to the other.
---
Strong card synergy either breaks an older card and wording tends to be very simplistic.
---
Maybe they should buff base HP of heroes and revert some aggro nerfs then buff Jarraxus.
---
Looks like there's an issue with your host for the lineup images; I'm getting Error: 403 Forbidden when trying to access them.
---
In arena it is still very close to being a river crocalisk.  You're just as likely to bring them just close enough to draw deathwing when they need it as you are to milling it.  
---
Dlc to get all of them
---
sounds like a boring deck to play
---
Lichking would agree
---
Linessa Control Pally (which existed in negligible amounts) also ran the card because it was so busted.

It's not a netdecking thing, cards like UI ,vilespine would go into every deck regardless if you make it yourself or not. Like they print a bunch of dragons for warrior, and the dragon execute minion is an epic- and it's the reason you want to make a dragon deck in the first place.

When you open packs from an expansion you are guaranteed a legendary in the first 10 packs. Then afterwards it goes to a guaranteed legendary in every 40 packs. So that could be why you were getting more legendary cards at the beginning.

Because it‚Äôs simpler this way doh (lol)
---
Right, popularity.  I guess because everyone prefers to craft spell hunter - I've got both and I generally find more success with secret hunter.
---
Hearthstone not at all like chess.  This is an intractable card game with inbuilt high variance.  No individual game or even in-game decision can be calculated with confidence into a set win. You can't go back and pinpoint and just say, "Oh I should have just drawn better cards"  or  "Next time that mage just won't have three fireballs in a row in Arena."
---
Sense Demon is the only card in all of the "These cards have hidden mechanics" that I have an issue with off the top of my head. The game has a ton of tutoring effects nowadays and none of them have that safeguard. If they used any other wording it would probably be fine.
---
You don't need any of those - just get super collider and you win.
---
It has a cap. Not sure what the cap is. 
---
Included in most quest hunter decks. Turns springpaw, elven archer, and boar into board deletion. 
---
jokes on you, i summon two dudes per turn starting turn two
---
Funny thing is the flaw in his logic is that if the whales somehow got some magic favoritism so they won more often then they would have less need to spend money to get better cards to improve their win rates.  
---
Play priest.
---
*Maiev
---
This stat has more to do with the fact that everyone and their mother is playing Hunter. The deck was nerfed, but it still beats hunter.
---
Here's the thing, if you want the easiest path to climbing the ladder, you don't craft the best performing or most popular deck, you craft the deck that counters them. Druid took a huge dump as a result of the nerfs and everyone was all abord the Hunter train. Odd Pally just happens to beat that deck.
---
Also, consider the amount of F2P players out there who can't afford all the fancy decks. Have you taken a look at the cost of some of the popular decks? 4 or 5 ledendaries and a whole bunch of epics is becoming the norm due to the fact that we have so many different sets in the rotation. Shit is fucking expensive man, what do you expect people to craft if not something cheap that beats those exact decks.
---
Besides, let's not pretend that Odd Pally is OP. It still loses to just about every popular Warrior deck, every popular Priest deck, it loses to even Shaman and some of the various Mage decks, and it also loses to even Pally.
---
The only reason it's god such a high winrate is because too many people are playing Hunter.
---
Nice catch, I'm laughing so hard right now.
---
In a more serious note, I'm surprised [[Mindbreaker]] hasn't found its way into the competitive ladder this format, ironically it could be a staple if it cost 1 more.
---
He can still totem, and the probability to get 2 untargetable minions before enemy is dead is extremely slim. 
---
You mean rogue can have really Tess Greymane cards to hallucinate from?
---
No
---
Ohh okay. I thought it was always going to be the nominated poster that would receive the award. Seems strange because then you have people like myself who didn't really contribute anything but just remembered a really interesting post and decided to bring it up now, as opposed to the people who went through the hard work of creating the content. Nevertheless, thanks for the replies!
---
And spectral cutlass + weapon buffs. Rogue is not a good choice:P
---
Right. Dopplegangster is much better for cards like Evolve, Unstable Evolution, Thrall Deathseer. Because you're using it for the 3 relatively high cost minions, not their stats themselves. 
---
Again, this is more evidence of the fact Saronite Chain Gang and Doppleganster, despite having similar text, aren't used all that similarly.
---
Am I just a bonobo or is Bwonsamdi's Sanctum a hard rumble run deck? I'm losing games even when the AI doesn't have an OTK on turn 1. It's keeping me away from hitting 15 relics. :c
---
You forgot another Enter.
---
Don't forget he could discover more 1 cost spells from hallucination, especially if he gets mirror image.
---
Maybe one day reddit will realize that they released genn and baku in a powerlevel reset year in order to have a meta change while still playing with mostly old cards. 
---
And that they will try to design around genn and baku in the next year by adding good odd/even synergy packages. 
---
I won because I got Valeria the Hollowed, then Tess, so the game thought my class was Rogue, and replayed all my (initial) druid cards, such as Recycle and Spreading Plague. 
---
I had also gotten a Flame Leviathan off of Face Collector earlier, and that kept coming back too. 
---
Needless to say, I beat his Fandral + Tending Tauren + Cenarius. 
---
The fact that this card has no condition like Keleseth does is kinda irrelevant to what /u/FirstCatchOfTheDay is saying.
---
You play Vanilla minions with this card. Those cards, while they can certainly be strong (the only one seeing play right now being Dire Mole), are boring. Their level of interactivity is based on their Attack and Health, and not much else.
---
Of course you're not going to run just this and Vanilla minions, you'd include Spells. It still doesn't change the fact that a portion of your deck is just going to be undercosted statlines and nothing else. At least Flamewreathed Faceless had, at the time, had Overload to affect your next turn and thus a synergy with Tunnel Trogg.
---
Spells are fun! So fun!
---
one factor in this game is that everyone has the same oportunity to build any deck it comes to mind, no restrictions, in this scenario you will have a card only a few will have, what if you get the best out of 5, what if the 5 cards arent that op, just balanced enough no one will be bothered by the result, but you willl have a card most people dont

Yeah if druid gets some more agressive aggro or token/ (hero attack) cards ramp wouldn't have room in these decks anyways. 
---
we need more synergies with this card
---
then make the card TRULY simple to begin with. Just get rid of the card draw mechanics. The first time I knew it gave me an extra card draw it confused the heck out of me and I thought " okay, what else in this game that I missed despite me reading all the card texts thoroughly"

Keleseth is strong in wild but it's VERY strong in standard because it's a format with underpowered 2 drops. As blizzard prints more cards, they will invariably make more worthwhile two drops, and I really don't think there will be that many decks in the long-term that run Keleseth other than *maybe* zoo, because zoo runs a deck with a low curve and efficiently-statted low cost minions is the way the deck operates
---
Basically, as more cards get printed there's going to be less decks that can afford to run no two drops to facilitate their strategies, so keleseth becomes more of an interesting deck-building consideration.
---
This looks like my Tracking whenever I play Hunter.

---
&gt;To me it sounds like you disagree with the article. Most of what you're talking about here has nothing to do with "clickbait", it has to do with you not thinking Hunter needs a nerf.   
---
If they put forward an argument for a nerf then I could debate it - the thing is there is no argument.  They don't make any argument at all as to why hunter needs a nerf.   
---
The article is an overview and history of hunter, nothing to do with whether or not it needs a nerf.  
---
&gt; It's the only nerf that happened last patch that I agree with 100%.  
---
I disagree with removing a card outright from a deck as opposed to a mana nerf that at least leaves it viable in the deck.  
---
An issue of this odd/even nonsense they've created with these hero powers imo.
---
Comment of the year so far 
---
Yes i agree its a tight balance. And it might take 2 sets. But if that doesn't work they can print more anti hero power tech. 
---
Thesynergys don't need to be OP, just better than the odd/even version. 
---
(For example print 2 good aggro synergy cards for paladin (and a few decent neutral 2 drops)  that is slightly better than odd paladin as a result. And odd pala doesn't dominate the paladin aggro gsme anymore. (It will lose many tools anyways after rotation. So we'll see.  
---
I'm not really convinced about it. While the stats indeed say it's still good, without Level Up it's just doesn't seem to scary at all, even when I'm playing decks Odd pally is supposed to be favored against. Could be just anecdotal evidence though, I'm not seeing that many of them.
---
Every *other* deck.
---
You don't just craft cards, you craft decks.  Have a deck in mind first and go from there.
---
Can't pull neutrals from Hallucinate though
---
Dangit
---
Play wild and sure
---
Nourish was *never* OP. It was routinely cut, even in Ramp decks, and pretty much only included because Druid's card draw was pretty awful most of the time, and playing it for Mana would often mean you have nothing to spend all that mana on.
---
I still don't think Wild Growth needed a nerf, not when UI's giant swinging dick was still around. But even then, 3 mana, gain 1 full mana crystal, at least that wouldn't have made the class completely pitiful like it is now.
---
It‚Äôs not a real one, I made it up because it feels like that when you play against it, but I do recall there being a real 7/9 for like 6 or something, I don‚Äôt play rexxar, so I don‚Äôt know exactly what it is, ask one of the dozens of hunter mains
---
i mean it's still a strong card, it's just preyed on by the metagame. I imagine as more powerhouse one drops get printed for warlock they'll play a host of those, keleseth, and whatever efficient cards over 2 mana that help them fight for board efficiently. Hard to predict the future though
---
I actually have a deck based around this legendary. Echo minions+ a ton of 1 cost ones. (For example, phantom militia as one of the echo cards)

Genn and Baku are real safe crafts. But only if you want to play those decks. 
---
Princess Talanji is not good enough to craft. Fun card for sure if you have a hand full of crazy RNG big bombs. But that's a very difficult gameplan to build around. Doubt the card will see enough future support to be viable.

If you cube the 1/1 bulldozer, the bulldozers in the cube are full sized. You can see from the play history that he triggered the Deathrattle of the Cube by hero-powering his Necrium Blade, making two 9/7 Bulldozers. He then probably traded his cube into something else, making 2 more.

You don't. Many people with F2P accounts (I also have an alt F2P) will tell you its BS. The difference between paid and free accounts is the amount of decks at your hand. But if you decide on a particular deck you can almost certainly build towards it. Last time I was logged into my F2P account I was playing pre-level up nerf odd paladin and crushed the ladder. Its the same story every time, you choose a reasonable deck, craft it, rank up.
---
So ridiculous that good amount of people complained about BSM.

All inf combos stop after 30? Runs the game will just stop the combo

lol dude, i just went 7-3 in arena and 6 of those games were warriors and all my loses were to warriors. Their kit is way too good in arena atm, the value they generate from omega assembly and dragon roar isn't really found in any class (i say this because there are SO many good dragons in the game). They also have more consistant wave clears then any other class.
---
Also, get rid of super clider in arena, it is EXACTLY the same as MC tech in that it punishes you for a wider board.. except for 3 turns in a row.

The combo stops after it deals 30 damage? So basically if you have 30HP+ armor then the Toggwaggle deck is just useless?

Go to your pack opening screen, then back to the main menu, to fix it.

Exactly! Priest had tons of ways to resurrect him, that's why hes disgusting

He means River Crocolisk would be better because Deathwing would be dead weight in the opponent's hand until turn 10, and gnomeferatu did burn it. 
---
I feel you bro...
---
if it weren't for towaggle rotating soon , i'll craft him too, he is the only missing piece for me but i'm reluctant to spend dust on him since i don't really like to play him in wild.
---
This happens in all ranks though. 
---
I believe it was truly random at some point early on in the game. 
---
Crafting a tier one deck doesn't guarantee a good game. Even tho there have been a couple autopilot decks recently, you could have a deck that costs a million dusts, has 99% winrate but if you don't know how to use the cards properly, you could easily lose with it.

there was a random legendary brawl a few times already, you get 4 copies of each and the card that lowers the cost of next played legendary and all of its copies
---
Can you explain?  Im too stupid to see the joke/reference etc
---
Many of the current priest decks are from boomsday (if not all)
---
I agree, I have been trying to reflect and see what I have done better but I keep finding myself frustrated.
---
I am currently running this deck.
---
[https://hsreplay.net/decks/e8IzAP8ekWR2yiN9gKjTwd/](https://hsreplay.net/decks/e8IzAP8ekWR2yiN9gKjTwd/)
---
I keep finding the enemy keeps clearing my minions if I'm turn 2 and not allowing me to do anything all game. 
---
Yeah man, Priest has like 5 board clears, if they main all of them it's absolutely infuriating.
---
Thats 32 damage :P
---
Blizzard doesn't even bother uploading them in order or avoiding spoiler in titles, there is lower hanging fruit.
---
Should make that a subreddit
---
But you will face ton of mirror matches.
---
Taking the correct counter for the local meta is always the correct move. And if its really true that the only thing in ladder is hunter, then there is no risk in running odd paladin.
---
Vinecleaver for example isn't really necessary on the deck anymore. A 7 mana weapon that produces 1/1s that can't be upgraded anymore isn't really good. About the which cauldron, I've seen it a lot but never really saw value when I tried myself. Other than that, odd paladin just isn't the same without level up anymore. 
---
Yeah. I see them open packs and they are like "woah that is some pretty good dust value". Like it doesn't quite have the same feeling. 
---
Context mustn't mean much to you then. 
---
Odd paladin is still dominating even after the nerf. and it only contains 2 legendaries and 2 epics. (its pretty cancer tho)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pretty much the same story with odd rouge.
---
i also would wait for april when the new expansion hits and more important: Ungoro, Knights and kobold will rotate out. so dont craft expensive cards from those expansion. R.I.P  deathknight heroes :(

DarkFlame88#2621 EU trading 80g quest,you go first
---
Think you got autocorrected there
---
Genau. Vor allem wenn man sich schon von Anfang an an die englischen Begriffe gew√∂hnt hat, kommen Karten wie "Entweihen" oder "Hexenmeister" komisch r√ºber :p 
---
Finja the Flying Ninja sounds way better than The Flying Star.
---
I agree on Zilliax 
---
Can't wait to use golden Jaraxxus again when Gul'dan leaves the rotation :)
---
Great pack! 
---
For the whooshed:
---
It‚Äôs 1234 if you look at the bosses defeated and runs completed.
---
Ohhhh. Sorry, it makes sense now. No need to change the title, younger people will know what it's about, I'm just an old chunk of coal.
---
Turn off the PC!
---
I join on u/reflexcheck ! His emote analysis deserves more recognition from the hearthstone kingdom! 
---
Kripp missed lethal when he did not go face with the shoe.
---
The oldest of news. Sorry bro
---
Hmm. Idk. Did you know that Hearthstone is a game that is originally based off World Of Warcraft?               (I jest,  all HS cards are very literal. ^_^ )
---
good idea. i was planing to dust jaraxxus but now that you mention it. after Guldan is gone, jaraxxus will be pretty cool again. also the fact that its golden gives it way more meme potential.
---
www.specsavers.co.uk
---
So your life so easy that playing a single mage card gets you a huge reward?
---
Sure must suck to be you. I'd hate to have to play 1 warrior card and get 4 packs and 60g.
---
Nein! Nein! Nein! KARTOFELSALAT MAKES ME FEEL ANGRY
---
Yeah, it's a bitch of a card to get played against you. You really need to play around it. When turn 8 is coming up, I save my strong cards.
---
Hunter has almost no board clears and Paladin can go extremely wide constantly every time you try to remove their board. 
---
Meh the pic., hero powercards... Then its game over, regarding the power, and in the year of the Raptor, regarding the card, he's a sore loser. Or he bought a legend or 2. Be sm@rt! üòÉ
---
I knew you would focus on that part of the sentence, even though I qualified my statement. I never indicated Blizzard shouldn't cater to newer players anymore. You are blatantly misrepresenting my position. I never indicated I believe your position to be that Blizzard's word is "infallible law". Why are you exaggerating my statements...?  
---
From my perspective, newer players are astute enough with technology to handle the addition of a tournament mode.  
---
From my perspective, Blizzard shouldn't need 4 years to determine which game-mode to implement or need 4  years to figure out how to implement it.  
---
Is that clear enough?
---
He has to go play a match just to play 1 mage card, that's not convenient
---
Yeah i could see that, it'd become like Gul'dan but for Hunter.  I think if they did that, they'd need to increase the power of the hero power, because comparing it to gul'dan, 2 damage vs 3 damage with lifesteal for the same ability and mana cost isn't equal.  It'd be interesting to see if a bigger hunter would become relevant.  Would probably be the deathrattle hunter with cubes and king krush + big minions that becomes the most played
---
Nowhere near that level of power.   
---
And even it was, you can still miss your favourite deck even if it was OP. 
---
Yeah Cave Hydra is the MVP of build a beast
---
3*
---
yes the things i told you should also apply for packs bought with ingame f2p gold. i think they also startet to give you a free legendary on the day a new expansion gets released. 
---
next time a new expansion releases try and see if you get a legendary in your first 10 packs (bought with real money or ingame money it doesnt matter)  if you dont get one i would contact a GM
---
Just play one card then concede
---
&gt; - relatively cheap
---
   - non-aggro
---
Pick one.
---
Also, most decks you just described are still played in Wild (Reno Warlock and Priest are in fact tier 1, but they're not cheap).
---
I really like blood troll in my zoolock, in rank 20-15 people dont even know what it does
---
I think this month there‚Äôs a qualification for the next wild open tournament if you get like top 20 I think on ladder. So right now maybe some streamers are playing wild who don‚Äôt normally, but a lot of them don‚Äôt play wild since it‚Äôs not the mode people compete in HCT with.

---
oh ok
---
I suppose the answer to your question is do you want to wait?
---
Personally I wouldn't invest, I'd ride it out and grind uphill my gold. Pick up as many newer packs as you can. Have a backstop of gold ready to go for it next expansion. But like I say, upto you.
---
*lights torch* this guy is onto something. 
---
Thank you for that masterclass in how to make your opinion as easy as possible to ignore.
---
Don't craft too much YotM plan allready for the next rotation/expansion. 
---
Go for classic and YotR . 
---
Especially if you wanna play fun decks. Check out your collection. And go from there.

80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first.
---
EU Lykan#21100
---
Yeah they often play test at low ranks before using the bots on their good decks at legend.
---
 I've added a picture for clarity 
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Its fun and gives you a good idea of what happens. but no deck feels very refined and doesn't stand up to Meta decks. But for 1600 dust I got to try all the cards out from the new expansion. 
---
Now that I read this, it's actually a good time to farm ranked wins.... I hate hunter, what are some budget to semi High cost decks? I have no hunter collection at all other than basic lmao. 
---
Yeah ok I see ty :)
---
Bullshit.  
---
There are so many good and cheap f2p decks out there you can climp to legend with 1k dust. 
---
Git good. At deckbuilding, and playing. 
---
Here a few tipps
---
1.Do some handtracking. 
---
Check out how many card the opponent keeps in the beginning. And use this information to deduct the likelyhood of him having certain answers in the deck. 
---
Try to observe the opponents hand. When he has mana left and a card in his deck with that manacost would have been really good in that turn you can assume he doesn't have it (this is the easiest case) if he hovers over cards or picks them up you can gain information what these cards could be.
---
2. Learn to find out when not to play cards. Allways playing for full mana efficiency is easy curverstone. The most important part is when suboptimal plays are more efficient, and against which decks in which sitiations you have to make these suboptimal plays.
---
2.5 identify you chances to win. Check the matchup win probability (hsreplay or viscious syndicate) for example and know how risky you have to play. In a good matchup you can play safe. In a bad matchup you can't play around everythinf.
---
3. Keep track of which cards the opponent already played.
---
4. Download decktracker and watch your own games and see the mistakes you made (mistakes not by outcome, but by bad decisions based on the informstion you had.) 
---
5. Have fun, and know your problem is not your rank. Your problem is your skill. So if you play. You play to learn and not to win. Playing to win comes later. Now you play to improve and have fun, and if you improve you will win.
---
6. Check out mulligan guides for your deck, and critically anylise the data. This one is a bit complex. 
---
Good luck :)
---
I find that most decks in hearthstone attempt to have the same game every time. It's called "playing with a plan". The better the deck currently is, the more likely it is to be able to execute its plan each game.
---
I dont remember mukla being in the tutorial, is this new?
---
Probably to scale as you learn. So he is Harder than the previous boss, but easier than the next
---
Yeah but they figured it‚Äôll be cheaper to just use one actor so it‚Äôs one dude reading all the lines for all the characters with original audio in the background 
---
Check out kiblers videos on this topic. 
---
There's actually a cool combo that involves dragon soul that just became possible since rastakhans-rumble. [Test Subject] + [Seance] + [Binding Heal] + [Topsy Turvey]. It's a 4 mana combo that can be used infinitely to summon Dragons with [Dragon Soul] or inflict 6 damage a turn as [Shadowreaper Anduin]. 
---
Thank you for your suggestion! As I said before I only have some unplayable epics and legendaries, so I don't have dragon's fury or zilliaxüò¢üò¢
---
I don't have much dust so I'm playing bugdet version aggro decks like of heallock, spell hunter, beast hunter, odd paladin etc.
---
He has always been there, the 5th boss.
---
Every week it's like "some people hate this brawl, some people love it". That's not gonna change. I think this one is fun. Yeah it takes a bit longer than the rest but not all of us are just here to 'get our pack and go'.
---
Minions with no additional text.
---
_Simple_ just seemed like a good keyword for that.
---
Probably because it's a tutorial.  Shocker
---
Ja mansch Sachen werden einfach so schlecht √ºbersetzt oder komisch das die Name sich wie schei√üe anh√∂ren. Ich meine shudderedwock hei√üt Grauselhurz 
---
Playing Wild.
---
Which includes certain Tavern Brawls
---
It was played perfectly as the A.I dies from fatigue anyways. 
---
Fair enough, thanks for your opinion. 
---
I have a Golden one. I cannot fathom what deck would want this though. Previous meme tier cards, Purify being the premier example, have seen some amount of play, but this is too low impact. Not only does this die to a fair amount even when played on T1, the armor isn't really always that relevant and it's one of the worst possible top decks. Compare this to Iron Hide, Binding Heal, heck even post-nerf Dark Pact and this is worse than all of them.
---
Well except you didn't open any packs from these expansions so far. 
---
It will be done, sir, just don't fire me - Blissard guy
---
ahhh
---
cool
---
EU, 80g quest, Puppet#21841
---
If his APM was high enough he could've played it for 2 mana
---
From all stats and top of players experience it seems like it's bad. Which rank did you reach with it? 
---
And people say HS doesn't require high APM
---
He's terrible in real games. You're probably in the dumpster with a small sample size where anything is possible.
---
F
---
I‚Äôm currently cruising up to twenty with him. 
---
Ah. Yeah I‚Äôm in rank 21 right now. 
---
The point is 1-2 times there were TOO many minions on the board (after Zul'Jin) for the enemy to go face. I thought is has smth to do with the wording of "Misdirection". And it's not in the deck, it's out of "Secret Plan".
---
That's good, you can choose a deck that beats hunter and get some easy wins! 
---
Yeah I would have liked to have him, but as you said no other hand support and at that point I wasn't even sure I would live until turn 9
---
Decius#2981
---
EU 80g trade. You go first
---
Actually, the card says "**When** one of your minion attacks" rather than "**After** one of your minion attacks" which is why it triggers the way it did. 
---
Had it been "After", then this would be non-intuitive and potentially a bug. However, the fact that it says "When", then the minion gets spawned before Mass Hysteria gets completely resolved.
---
Mindbreaker is a good counter
---
That's very good for you, but expect to have it much harder once you get at better ranks. 
---
Damn that‚Äôs unfortunate. The deck I made is super fun to playüòÇ
---
Quark?
---
meteor doesnt have unique effect, dealing damage to a minion and the  2 adjacent to it can be found on a lot of other cards.
---
Keep playing it if it works for you! What others say is not as important. 
---
I had his once, and my next opponent conceded before I could play a single card.
---
All of my responses have held content that has driven this debate further. I haven't appealed to semantics - are you confusing my corrections of your quotes with semantics? If I had a response for the OP, I would have replied to the OP. I was more interested in pointing out the flaws I identified in your post.
---
Have you actually kept track of every time this situation has come up on paper or is this just how it feels to you?
---
hardcore version
---
Cause you could run two!
---
I seem to get more &lt;5 HP come-back wins in arena with warrior more than any other class.
---
Deck will be a lot worse when that stupid 1/1 taunt divine shield rotates out
---
The light shall ....eh nevermind 
---
Your ideas are so bad omg...
---
candleshot now is on par (if not worse) with Lights Justice. Hunters rarely used hunters mark after it got nerfed to 1 mana, and this cards lets it use it as a decent early game defense + good single target removal lategame. Thats why is being used, because without it, hunter would only be able to play aggro decks like it has been since the origin of the game. This allows them to play slower archetypes, and should not be nerfed. Its not problematic, its not oppresive, and its has counters too.
---
Deathstalker rexxar being 9 mana is a shit nerf, the problem comes from the hero power. This would nerf it, yes, but it would still be an autoinclude in hunter decks since its still obligatory to win the control games.
---
Prince keleseth doesnt need nerfs (not now at least, it used to be way more popular and stronger). Once it rotates out, it wont be even seen again, since the problem is being too many bad 2 drops for tempo decks, rather than keleseth being too strong. Also, your nerf doesnt really make it less "toxic" or whatever.
---
Zilliax doesnt need nerfs... Lich king either...
---
And the carnivorous cube nerf is the most stupid idea I have ever seen here. Be glad, you deserve a medal for it. Intead of proposing a normal nerf for carnivorous cube, lets just *fucking change how all the copy rules work for the game and all the cards that create copies", that will surely be good. And in case you want this rule to only apply to carnivorous cube, then well, cubelocks can still burst you, and those doomguards dying will still be ressurected with guldan. Hunter will still pop cubes/create a lot of 5/x. Old druids would still get hadronox, but now just closer to death, even better!! You are basically not doing anything for the decks abusing cube (if not making them better in edge cases), but in the process, you make sure any other creative use of cube is nerfed. Great done!
---
And we wonder why they dont give us deckslots, why they dont comunicate here, why they treat us like babies with nerfs like fiery war axe... Its because of people like you.
---
I got this too...and by ass opponent insta-conceded before I drew a single card.
---
I think there's multiple reasons for this.
---
One, Epics and Legendaries have become more important as compared to when Hearthstone first started, where decks like Undertaker Hunter, Patron Warrior, and Naxx Zoo needed at most one Legendary. 
---
These days, we've had a couple expansions where Epics have been massively important, such as in Un'Goro. And with two Class Legendaries per expansions instead of one, most decks tend to require even more usage of Class Legendaries than in years past. My Wild Burn Deck for examples uses Aluneth, Stargazer Luna, and 2x Primordial Glyph. That's a lot of dust for what used to be a fairly inexpensive deck.
---
Secondly, through the years, a number cards have been nerfed/rotated, many of which helped aggro (typically cheap decks). Knife Juggler, Leper Gnome, Arcane Golem, Power Overwhelming, Abusive Sergeant, Rockbiter, many Murlocs, and Mana Wyrm.
---
Third, and to me, most important: They abolished Adventures which was using the LCG model where you could get all content for a flat price. Nowadays, it's much harder to keep up with the new content because even though an Expansion has 3x the amount of cards as an Adventure like LOE, it costs waaaaaaay more to get the majority of the collection.
---
How's that losing streak going there buddy?
---
Gotta nerf nourish to five mana now, just to be safe
---
I did and nothing happened
---
I‚Äôm the first to complain about how garbage hearthstone is but my god, yall are fucking children lmao
---
I never got over the fact evolve cost 1 mana... That stuff was so dumb.
---
I got rank 5, so I only play in casual.
---
I Just can't get enought post like these haha 
---
*Buaaah I lost to hunter!! That means their decks are very easy to play, braindead, and all people that play the deck are evil! I am very mature!!*
---
Its posts like this that makes me want to play hunter even more.
---
You need to improve as a player if you are salty about losing to a tier 3-4 deck. 
---
I always check my collection when I open packs, type new in the search bar and hover over them. I don't actually mind seeing what I got again it just feels random. Sometimes the duplicates don't show up as new at first but when I go back it's suddenly new again.
---
Why is this a card even?
---
They will provide Odd Paladin support in 2019. They have given Aggro / Dude Paladin tools every single year.
---
Please, one was just a secret plan.
---
Odd Paladin and Midrange hunter are well performing decks that are incredibly cheap (you don't need prince liam at all, it's a nice to have and possibly worse performer when it gets more games behind it).  
---
Blizzard will always want to aim to have more expensive decks more popular because it encourages people to spend.  
---
Thankfully though there are still cheap options
---
I'm biased because im a warrior plyaer I would rather play against that than 10 minutes of trying to kill your opponent and then dieing in one turn because you couldn't do it in time lol
---
nothing to bump your head to
---
Ha... Hahaha... Hahahahaha... Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Oh, wait... You're serious? 
---
I‚Äôd probably pick the one that your brain-replacing addon tells you :x
---
Snaps his fingers and half the RNG in the world dies.
---
If they make a Marvel CCG, i'll play the shit out of it.
---
Think? You offered a bet. Directly to me. You were wrong on your bet. I don't /think/ you owe me anything, I know you do. 
---
Its okay tho. I knew from the start you wouldn't pay up. I hope you donated the actual price of 5 packs and not the minimum of $5.
---
Maybe he will snap blizzard away.
---
What would you say a fair price is? Random result means the price needs to be lower to be worth playing, and to really get "crazy value" you need to fill your deck with cards that are borderline useless if you don't take advantage of their evolve synergies (namely Doppelgangster)
---
I think it could still be borderline playable at 2 mana, but even that's pushing it. At 3 mana it would be absolute trash, even if the "dream scenario" would still be great.
---
This is why I run Chameleos instead. It's often just a "Turn 1: know what deck your opponent is playing" card, even if you never actually play Chameleos. 
---
Also funny you say I haven't proven anything when I actually have. You're just a salty broke boi, it's okay.
---
I did $10
---
Hopefully you can put this to rest now. 
---
I‚Äôd say fungalmancer, lich king, there‚Äôs some more neutrals like maybe corpsetaker if you count that 
---
Godfrey is probably best
---
Yeah, damn those paladins dominating the meta!  
---
&gt;This establishes Paladin as the best class at ranks 1-4 where it has three of the four Tier 1 representatives.  
---
Oh wait, were you trying to infer Hunter is dominating like everyone else does even though the data says something different?  
---
You have to play to get chip damage in early while they're tapping and twilight acolyte their giants. This forces out their healing and gives you lots of pressure. You can also Alex after they pull a big heal turn. Gul'dan is tough but if you don't allow him to kill off demons it becomes significantly weaker, plus diluting his deck means less chance of him drawing it. Even if he does get it out, by that point you should be able to continuously force him under 20 hp so he dies to triple mind blast.
---
Millions of dollars in funding and a highly competent, inspired team of professionals at the wheel, ouch. 
---
If you're not planning to spend money, pick 1-2 classes that you have fun playing and focus on getting cards for those classes. You will not be able to play all 9 classes to their full potential as a FTP. Absolutely do not dust Bloodmage or Rexxar. 
---
Naw, I'm having fun. You still owe me 5 packs. The donation is nice, but that wasn't the bet you offered.
---
That doesn't mean it's not statistically possible or even unusual.
---
Seeing as this seems to be a somewhat rare occurrence since you're only getting Misdirection from Secret Plan, it wouldn't be that weird if one particular outcome has occurred more often. There just isn't a large enough sample size to allow for the results to even out.
---
I mean... i use this app but i mostly chose card by myself but this one is quite hard 
---
If you're comfortable playing whatever deck/s you have at your disposal, then I'd recommend saving the gold. Unless you really want to play a different deck or try something new, there really isn't any need to spend that gold. In fact, if you're a budget player and prefer not spending real money on Hearthstone, it would be a wise decision to save that gold and accumulate as much as possible for the April expansion. 
---
The spellstones are not fair lol... warlock, druid, hunter, priest, probably more are all absurdly high power level. 
---
Nothing to sing alooong to
---
Godfrey is a game changer if you lose board eventually.
---
Sign me up for either 
---
For some reason I kinda thought they would make their own IP. Marvel is cool though.
---
Really curious about the genre of game. It's gotta be something CCG-related right? Or maybe Clash Royale style?
---
Don't also forget a decline in popularity of the game.  Less people playing and whaling means less people experimenting.  
---
Also this time of year is always going to see a decline in gameplay for this sort of game I would think.  
---
To the popularity part though those knee jerk nerfs out of nowhere were rushed through for a reason and I imagine that has to do with the game not performing as well as expected with the recent expansion.  
---
I would go further to say they turned even more players away with the nerfs than they managed to attract as it fucked the meta more and ruined some nice decks people were playing (like the entire druid class ... wow).
---
Be nice if there were metrics on this sort of thing to see.
---
Thing From Below is actually from Whispers of the Old Gods.
---
Though Karazhan also offers Barnes, Curator and Medivh, and probably some other useful cards.

Jaraxxus. You don't have a control deck, Godfrey would not be be good for you. 
---
You're right. 
---
support for aggo/dude paladin doesn't have to be odd though. In fact, Odd Pally ran zero year of the raven cards outside of Baku until recently with Liam. I expect them to be cautions with Odd support after it dominated all year.   
---
It will likely still be solid, but I don't expect it to be tier 1 unless there's a perfect storm meta like right now with 31% of all decks are hunters.
---
Well if odd warrior is the meta then you are going to see odd warrior vs a bunch of combo decks. I would def quit HS for that time
---
OP, make sure the Darkness is golden so your shark will be shiny and avoid projectiles!
---
The best feeling in the Hunter meta is savouring the anticipation as you see them charging their Spellstone while you have an active Duskbreaker in hand.
---
Hunterstone you say?
---
Maybe you should have skipped the tldr and actually read it instead. :)
---
Fixed.
---
"Amazing"
---
That's actually pretty cool. I didnt know this either. 
---
we deserve a 5 legendary pack..... or atleast 2
---
Yeah well Blizz went full evolve with ,doppleganster, saronite, thing from below, jades, and corridor creeper who all massively supported this dumb ass one mana card.
---
It‚Äôs a shame. We have to wait till rotation it seems. As DK hero‚Äôs still trump the meta
---
OTK Cloning vat priest can eat a dick
---
More like an increase in mana cost
---
15 legendaries is about 150 packs of cards and dust.  For me, that's about 2-2.5 expansions of grinding, in other words, most of a year of grinding.  So after only buying packs from this year since Witchwood launched, I'm half a year or more behind.
---
I only talked about this year because I barely played last year (only played a bunch of Spell Hunter in Kobolds, which I dusted most of my previous collection to create).  I'm missing a lot of cards from this year, which was my active year and the year that I bought packs for.  Next year, I may have to craft legendaries from this year, which obviously means I won't keep up with next year's legendaries.
---
That's why I don't understand how you can have all of the cards and legendaries from this year.  I haven't even remotely been able to keep up; I have maybe 1/3 of the meta legendaries across all classes.  Yet you say you have all but 2-3 of the meta legendaries from this year.  I don't get how that's possible.
---
Hunter is being used in roughly 30% of all games ranks 1-5, with four archetypes being solidly in tier 1. I'd say calling it hunter stone is pretty fair, even if paladin has the better overall winrate
---
MosAusdruck#2789 on EU, can show! Maybe leave a comment here so I can see that you add me without opening the game every 5 minutes.

After looking at you deck it looked like an even deck. If you cut the odds add Genn you can change 6 cards to make even.  Add the 1/4 mech Deathrattle, Umbra, and you can still go infinite 2 ways. Also allows more destroy effects like doomsayer or ooze.

If you think investors don't have a signifigant say in the design process, you might not know how to business

Was hoping to see an original IP. Personally, not a fan of the Marvel angle.
---
However, I wish anyone the best of luck in life pursuing their passion and enjoying the process. We should all be so lucky/ballsy. 
---
That... is *exceptionally* accurate!
---
mecha cthun combo
---
So big? Is Tencent even bigger?
---
Craft Subject 9 and go all in on Secret Hunter. Less cards will be rotating
---
Didn't Tencent juat get fucked by Chinese video game law though?
---
yep ;)
---
&gt; It's more like saying you don't like Asian people because of the shape of their eyes

Jesus, I had to view your post history after reading that. Listen man, the world isn't out to get you and you don't have to take offense to things because some other people **might** get offended. I get that you feel, or at least felt, maligned by society at some point in your life but you are swinging for the fences on this racism stance you are taking but I'm not like that at all. Life has surrounded me with a diverse array of friends and family, making a joke about eye folds is pretty tame compared to my Hmong buddy talking about eating our dog or cat while playing with them - he doesn't give a shit because racism doesn't mean a thing around people that aren't racist.

i see it all the time when i play hunter but I dont think others have the summon 2 varsion i have. 
---
Just check Vicious Syndicate or Tempo Storm data reports. Shaman hasn't been tier one since Karazhan. Yes the OP Midrange Shaman decks in that era did run Evolve, but evolve is not what made that deck OP. Spirit Claws, Tunnel Trog, and Totem Golem did.
---
Past that era Evolve was still a popular card in Shaman, but that's because Shaman cards since then have been very weak. Being a strong card in a weak class does not make the card nuts.
---
Honestly, if this game is half as good as Marvel Battle Lines, I‚Äôm there. 
---
They're also the company that handles localization in China for most Blizzard IP, which generally is filled with a lot more mtx than we're used to.  
---
You'd have to imagine Brode and Co. are leveraging connections they made when with Blizz to gain as much traction as possible.  
---
From memory, Netease along with Tencent have their claws in quite a few AAA developers.
---
I personally would have chosen Godfrey
---
I need someone to post their reaction or review video of this video.
---
We finally get to see more Ben brode :D I missed that guy man
---
well the other guy can leave. its not like the lethal is hidden
---
How many Rush cards are in the Basic set or even the Classic set?
---
Now imagine being a new player who unpacks their first Epic from Witchwood and it's *that*. Apply that logic to pretty much any Epic, even ones like the one mentioned above, Meteor. When the hell is any newer player going to need that 15-damage nuke + 3 to adjacent minions? Look at Un'goro's Mage cards, they'd be much better off with Shimmering Tempest or Molten Reflection or Arcanologist.
---
More draw, more value. You want to put Elven Minstrel in there to draw some 1 mana minions. I even play an Acolyte of Pain in mine, it's just more draw. 
---
Since you've got AE and Sprint, you want prep. Prep / AE turn 1 means you can start drawing huge 1 mana minions on turn 2, which typically wins you the game. 
---
Vilespine is also just generally good. You need to stall, and then you need something to deal with their big minions late game too, and Vilespine is good at both. 
---
Obviously you want Tess if you've got her. I put Zilliax in mine as well for tons of healing. If you can get both Tess and Zilliax, you'll also want shadowstep, so you can play them and then bounce them for even greater value. 
---
Start there, see how it goes. Would be happy to share my deck list with you too, I play in standard and wild...it's basically the only deck I play anymore because it's so much fun. 
---
For example common cards are as powerful as legendaries if you think about it. 
---
Top tier shitpost, take my upvote.
---
For any of the heros that take immediate damage such as hunter or mage, put in 2 molten giants and mulligan till you hit both
---
Hearthstone is an exceedingly simple card game where the decks are so small that only the strongest cards make the cut unless you're odd, even, or reno. The lack of interaction combined with the linear, reliable mana system leaves you with few meaningful turn-to-turn decisions. Because of the tiny deck sizes and the fact that low-cost minions have to be overbearing to be good (because of ping hero powers and decent low-cost removal available to every class), individual cards are made incredibly potent to be competitive, leading to massive game swings and making the game even more based around drawing your powerful card than other card games. Keleseth and DKs are some of the worst examples of this. This also makes the ridiculous grind far more important because surprise surprise these swing cards are often legendaries.

Overwatch is a game that has players so unenthused with its actual gameplay that quickplay is dying off and the comp off-season lasted 2 hours. Its balance is a mess at both low and high level play, with an attacker victory being so inevitable that they implemented the stopwatch system to see who wins at attacking harder. Meanwhile it's the exact opposite problem with lower level players. This is not to mention the game's incredibly stagnant meta exacerbated by a glacial update schedule more focused on events and cosmetics than the game itself. Also I don't like it.

You could say, the marvel VR Game is an fps
---
0/3 death rattle summon a 5/5 is better.
---
Change my mind.
---
Also fuck Hunter
---
Volcano or lightning storm was quite gd against this until they nerfed chain gang
---
Against priest or druid, they need to dump the rest of their hand before they can go off.  If you timed it right, you can just kill him yourself leaving them with a 0/3 they cant remove.
---
Lmao is this kid real
---
Rogue has vanish, priest has psychic scream, mage has flame strike, warlock has hellfire, warrior has brawl, shaman has lightning storm, Druid has spreading plague
---
You **think** you want this, but you really don't.
---
Hello *Shadowverse* players. We all know what happened with Wonderland Dreams, don't we?
---
it's meant to be a a balance of risk and reward. It has a relatively high cost, can be cleared easy, but when you play it right and wait for your opponent to have fewer draws by playing out the game with secrets, it makes it much more worth it. Spellstone for hunter is perfectly fine as it is.
---
It IS a unique effect. Massively-high damage plus damage to adjacent minions is something we haven't seen before. It's basically Flame Lance plus Explosive Shot put together, except it's such overkill that you'll rarely need all the damage for it. If you're a newer player, you don't want Meteor as opposed to the Basic or even Classic removal spells, because it's one more mana for such a ridiculous removal that will rarely come in handy in comparison to other removals like your Polymorphs, your Fireballs, your Frostbolts, etc.
---
What decks actually RUN Meteor? What decks want to RUN Meteor? Because to me it doesn't seem like a card you just slap into any deck.
