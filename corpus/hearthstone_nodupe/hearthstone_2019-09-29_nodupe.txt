That would be the best creature you could get though tbh. Phage wouldn't kill yourself because evolving doesn't make enter the battlefield triggers.

Ooh I like that idea.. it’s a small thing but given the new class portraits for 1k wins it makes sense.
---
Edit: I’m an idiot and didn’t realise it came with a clip

Now I want Reno DK.

I don't dig into tierlists or decklists, have simply seen it in Quest Rogue a lot.
---
Unfortunately that is just how card games are going to work. I haven't played any other online tcg but I'm pretty sure they're similar. 
---
It's very similar to paper trading card games when you buy the cards but you don't get to hold the assets. Of course, that is worse but that's your choice and what you pay to enjoy online player base and digital features. But still the same, if you stopped playing any trading card game that you played with actual cards, you'd have to re-up your collection, most likely opening random packs trying to get the right ones.
---
Compare it to other triple A games where you have to buy the content yearly. Sports games are literally reskins with new player models but are resold as new titles. Same with rpg or shooter games that need to be repurchased yearly. COD &amp; others even make you pay more for other features and skins. 
---
Of course hearthstone is expensive and could be cheaper. The general idea is that it is a business and just like any other game you pay for what you get. 
---
Just imagine spending $20 on the game as going out for bowling for a night. You spend your money where you enjoy it. 
---
I had immature spending habits with gambling, drugs, and others and found spending money on hearthstone is much more enjoyable than losing money online or getting drunk. Plus I get to continually enjoy it. 
---
Once you have a certain size collection, you do not need to spend or work so hard to build your collection. 
---
I have spent a lot in the game and will honestly say I have spent way more than I had too. I just got addicted to pack opening.
---
You don't need every competitive deck even, just a handful that you enjoy. 
---
After all, you won't enjoy playing every single deck.

We need to have this be a bigger deal
---
Had the treasure that reduces costs by 1 for every odd card played and the 1 mana draw a card that costs 2,3,4 and 5 mana. From turn 10 I was dropping 0 mana C'Thun's with rush every turn
---
Doesn't make you right
---
No, it needs more cards. I think highlander hunter is the best deck, that I’ve seen played. Just wondering what everyone else’s opinions are.
---
The only playable priest deck, or murloc paladin if your feeling lucky
---
Whizbang does update...?
---
And yea still can’t be beat by retards like you
---
To me Murdock paladin isn’t that great of a deck, unless you get really lucky. I’ve been playing some janky ass beast deck and only lost once in 4-5 times playing against Murloc paladin, but they went second and got really lucky. 
---
What priest deck?
---
I did the original chest in the first phase but he never triggered it. I eventually broke it and got the treasure that draws a card and fills your hand.  I drew Jr Scout and had 7 of them.
---
They could easily stack the two UI elements on top of each other and then toggle the stack whenever you tap or click on it.

I scoured the depths of the interwebs to no avail, my friend. It looks like it was a one-time commission specifically for that giveaway. I didn't even see it for sale secondhand. Sorry about the apartment fire as well. I do hope that one pops up for sale in the future and that things overall start looking up for you.

I got zilliax from buying the relevant card packs, I'd probably still be saving the dust for it if I didnt because I dont spend money lol

lol, i did consider it, but went with Arcanine (fav pokemon as a kid). Arc (&lt;3 Tony Stark) for short.
---
Yes I'll be sure to follow you closely I can tell that a big Hollywood name like Adam Sandler will notice you soon
---
the game didn't let me play the deck but the client freaked out and eventually forced me out of arena, when I went back it was gone
---
Look on the bright side, nothing negative from this.
---
They've also always talked about certain cards "limiting the design space" for some classes and I think the fact Priest will always have both Northshire/Circle and Spirit/Fire does quite limit what they can do with the class overall.
---
I can't imagine they won't do something about both combos eventually, just to shake up the class.
---
I think Spreading Madness gets it for being such an unusual spell. There's Mad and Madder Bomber, sure, but those are neutral battlecry minions, and it's not like we've seen much of that type of effect since then. There really isn't another spell quite like it, and definitely not in the Warlock collection, so it's important to distinguish it from, say, Arcane Missiles, which is how someone might expect it to work. Like, if I only glanced at the card with no prior knowledge, I definitely wouldn't expect it to have its actual effect, since it's godawful and why would you ever print that, so the clarification is understandable.
---
Oh
---
Go. Away.
---
I dont know if that's a good thing or a bad thing 
---
Thanks tho
---
Thanks gator_gaming69

Hahaha. Oh my hungover and forgot to eat last night self is so glad he has a kebab. Well next time you’ll stay in and play Hearthstone instead - solution to all problems

If there was a button "complete quests" I would press it every time, because it's just a burden to me.

Ahhh. Weird...
---
That's how it's supposed to be. It casts the spell. The spell is modified by things you've done throughout the game. Vargoths copy doesn't care.

Yeah basically this.  It's always best from a gold naximisation perspective to keep 50g quests sitting around as long as possible and only  complete them if you have a full quest log.

It's funny that my post has got so heavily downvoted as this was conventional reddit wisdom a couple of years ago.  The game must have got so much more FTP-friendly in recent years that the majority of people no longer feel the need to do this.

Grubber#1724 NA 80g 4 80g quest trade - EDIT: DONE, thanks mate.
---
It's a very good card, above average, but far from broken, given the even cards ''downside'' I'd say it's a fair card, doing the same thing with singleton decks would be cool imo
---
No way your rank 4 and don't face combo preist
---
When you get 500 wins (on ranked and arena) your hero portrait becomes golden. In this case, OP won 500 games of Hunter and so the Hunter Hero (Rexxar) becomes golden.
---
[deleted]
---
I think you need to relax from the game for a while. You can come back to it when you want to.
---
And then you dont draw toggwaggle.
---
You can be offered secrets? Most I've ever gotten is one or 2 extra secrets.  Jr. tomb diver is the worst card ever. Even if you somehow miraculously get offered more than 1 extra secret they are going to be spread out through your entire deck so you probably won't ever draw them all anyway.
---
OOOOHHHH LEEEEGENDAAAAARY!!!
---
Fuck whizbang, waste of a legendary, unpacked that useless fucker and haven't disenchanted him in case I get him again
---
It's like raaaain on your wedding day
---
Zephrys should be in every deck tbh, highlander or not
---
Atleast n'zoth is coming back to standard with a free copy, I reckon emperor too.
---
What would Reckful do here?
---
Uhh, how
---
Good lord. Ignore these comments. You either go for no duplicates at all, or just attempt to get them out of your deck somehow. Any middle ground gains very little for a massive sacrifice. That's just how the math works out. Controllock is already lacking tools; it's devastating to cut half of them. In fact, you're cutting them to pay two mana to get something similar to what you cut 90% of the time.
---
Trying to get 255 pings off will always take a while.
---
It definitely makes some mistakes. I put Hakkar in a Priest deck, pressed autocomplete, and it used the other 29 cards to make a Nomi Priest.
---
That was almost 5 years ago (early 2015 if I remember correctly), so you can expect to see almost 2000 new cards, a massive amount of "new" Singleplayer content, weekly Tavern Brawls (rules change each wednesday).
---
I had the same issue. I'd tried to buy something but the card that expired, and that seemed to really confuse it. I logged into my Blizzard account through a web browser and added in a new card, and that seemed to fix it.
---
If we count 25.000 games as a fine number of games for a deck, there are 16 of those since the latest patch, 35 of those in last 30 days, and 76 of those since the release of Saviors of Uldum.
---
I will be your death!
---
Gahdamn shorty fine as hell 😍🥴
---
Plague of madness vs plauge of armor
---
Had to redownload game.
---
Of course we care about the bug, but we cannot do anything about it. Just wait for the post to gain traction and the dev to notice it. Or alternatively file a bug report.
---
Are you sure? I played against the second and healed up with obsidian statues in the end, and the next run started with the healed amount...
---
Already attempted. Nothing.
---
Very nice!
---
I’ll be straight up honest here, I barely know how to create a blizzard account, my dad did it for me. Would you be able to post a few steps if you could?
---
there is no mulligan, no concede, only explosion. I didn't fast forward the video, you can see that I can't do anything before explosion, neither after.
---
Unfortunately I'm pretty sure Blizzard designs bad recipes on purpose. Even before Whizbang, there was some god awful deck recipes that were suspiciously high on dust cost.
---
Wow that's fantastic! I actually feel like this fits Hearthstone's current direction (focusing a lot more on cartoony aspects) far better than Valeera's current portrait.
---
That didn’t explain it at all. I already know that it does bother people, just not why it does.
---
How is it turn 1 OTK when you can't attack on turn 1?
---
It’s not
---
Your far-right minion attacks at the end of the turn, and he only has one minion.
---
Did she win?
---
With those kinds of winrates, you won't be able to craft many high-end decks. Not that 3-4 wins is bad, but arena rewards aren't great shy of 7 wins. If you get 50 gold as a reward, you're breaking even since you're guaranteed to get a pack which is worth 100g, but your guaranteed pack will only be from the latest expansion. You'll probably have to buy packs from other expansions eventually to increase your collection. Not sure if you're new or if you know this, but you're guaranteed a legendary within the first ten packs of any expansion. After that, it drops to a legendary within 40 packs. So it's worth it to buy packs from past expansions until you get a legendary from each.  
---
All in all, if you pool all your gold into arena, don't count on having more than one meta deck in constructed. But if you genuinely love arena, go for it!
---
Having three duplicates in your deck means you still have a fifty percent chance of the card not being live as late as turn ten.
---
You either play Zephrys in a Highlander deck to make sure he's always live or in a deck that can churn through its deck relatively quickly as a late game "save me" or "find me lethal" option.
---
You're fine leaving your deck as it is instead of making it less consistent with fewer options against aggression to enable Zephrys more often.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk will love the thighs
---
Wins are wins. Just accept it and move on.
---
What would you define as a "good collection?"
---
"little artwork"
---
Well, you've definitely played more than I. But my combo allows you to draft early game so heavily that losing early board shouldn't be possible. Only disadvantage is that weapons can't be affected by Bob.
---
Somebody told me that devs will check Reddit posts, so the "FIX IT" doesn't yell at you dude.
---
I just wanna show this funny BUG to you.
---
I don't really care about winning in casual. It is just disappointing to miss an ultra fun combo.
---
It's already plenty easy for anyone who at one point had a decent Standard collection. With a community as vibrant as Hearthstone's, the game really doesn't need and should't spell everything out for the returning player.
---
If you want to always pull off that combo, just play against the Innkeeper until you've had your fill.
---
The Plaguelord of Madness' twist is that your rightmost minion attacks a random enemy at end of turn. In this case, because the only enemy is the Plaguelord itself, it will attack and kill the Plaguelord at the end of my turn, before the Plaguelord can steal it with its hero power on its own turn.
---
no
---
I have a friend who always blames stuff on p2w shit. Meanwhile he played vs me and dropped hyena on turn 2 on an empty board. I removed it and eventually used reno Jackson. I copied it and had a spare in hand. Knowing this he used 2 skill commands on my face for no real reason. He said his deck is good but my deck hard countered his lmao. He also said he can’t afford the good cards and always complains about that. -_-

---
I feel that the priest quest, as it is with many strategy ideas, is a few cards away from being really good.  The reward is great, and the condition isn’t too difficult to meet by mid game.  While it’s not performing terribly well at the moment, I think it could with some more experimentation, and certainly could in the future with more cards added. 
---
I’d say don’t dust it unless your dust starved and have a fun deck in mind you’d prefer to play
---
Contact the Support! I'm sure they could help.
---
Safe to say they're non existent outside of priest enthusiasts
---
I don't get the joke but I want this to be top of the sub
---
Also point out how togwaggle sides with rafamm because of the “Treassures”. during the tombs of terror adventures, Reno often says at the beginning of battle “Were gonna be rich! I mean Save the world!”  This isn’t just Reno’s character, this is togwaggle forgetting his lines
---
Smug

[relevant-nsfw](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstonecirclejerk/comments/davzar/having_sex_vs_posting_dormant_lucentbarks_to_rhs/)
---
you need to average 7 wins for arena to be profitable enough to be an effective way of building a collection. you're guaranteed 150 gold reward for 7 wins so every 7 win run is a free pack. if you're averaging 3-4 wins you're making maybe 15 gold profit per run.
---
Can 1000 wins Valeera top this? :)
---
Wtf still?
---
What’s even intended though? The minion on the left is hit but the one on the right isn’t, this also is odd when you have 4 on the board because non of them took damage. It seems to just be random to me.
---
Gotta complete it with every class fam

I mean this post that has been posted 1000’s of times is still being posted

---
Ah yea you’re right, missed that.
---
I hear people complaining about zilliax a LOT.  So by our calculations in the debate, you're looking at about a 1 in 3 chance of a getting a 5/5 or worse, which isn't terrible for tempo and about a 1 in 4 of getting basically shit. 
---
Thanks for the downvoted though.

Dear god, this is back?

Ended up doing something similar another time against the Plaguelord of Death, albeit I filled *his* deck with 16 corrupted bloods before he got low enough to transition into phase 3.
---
That boss is hard enough on normal that I feel like you have to cheese it like that in some way.
---
Well just constructed grinding.  Ladder and Casual both play out 10/3.
---
I had prep clever disguise x2 and still lost
---
Pretty sure the odds were not drawing 4 bombs in a row, even with 5/7 bombs in the deck.

Kripp had a 35 legendaries deck...so...no.
---
Another thing you could do, (this is a bit longer of a suggestion) is to have an extra account. With an extra account, once you get it to where you can get your daily quests... you re-roll those quests until you get the 80g play a friend quest.
---
And then play yourself for the gold. Now this isn’t a way to farm gold, but if you have two devices and a little extra free time it’s nice.
---
Man, I agree that there is a lot of people on here who just complain, but there's also another annoying category: Condescending people who think they're smarter and better than everyone else at the game. That would be you, my friend. Chill.

yes, this has been posted here a while ago and i totally agree, i think a lot of people would be satisfied if blizzard made solo content accsessible offline

---
I'm going to assume english isn't your first language because I can't get much sense out of what you're saying. 7 mana is a great spot for evolve targets because as opposed to some 9 and 10 mana cards, 8 mana cards tend to be quite good and not understatted for the effect the card gives. Sure you can low roll hireek the bat, but you can also high roll GIANT minions on the regular. In particular walking fountain, tirion forgering and octosari. Even if that wasn't the case, using a 3/4 rush minion to kill 1 thing and then evolve into a bigger thing will always be good. Let's say you get a mid roll of rng off of your evolve and get pit croc. That's still a 3/4 rush with basically deathrattle summon a 5/6. Obviously you have to have mutate in hand, and I'm not even arguing the card is op. Getting high rolled by tirion feels incredibly bad though. The chances of "low rolling" are much lower specifically for 8 mana cards. Basically if you don't get hireek or heroic innkeeper it's still a good play
---
The term you're looking for is "Anal Retentive" or "Neurotic"
---
Obviously you're playing a thief druid and managed to get the mage DK on your second turn and play it.
---
he should have ate the orange in middle of the match
---
Same difference. Downvotes were for non-contributing content altogether, not because you disagree with what was said. Something you apparently do given you've already downvoted me, presumably over no reason other than that you're upset.
---
Not at all. If you log on to MTGA right now, they will give you over a dozen starter decks, plus many more packs for free. It's also 20 bucks to get a "season pass" type of deal that nets you many card packs, gold, and gems. It is a lot easier to get into MTGA right now if you are a newbie price wise. Hearthstone is insane. You get 1 pack a week with lousy cards. You can grind 100 gold a day if you have absolutely no life and only play hearthstone.
---
No, not really. Downvoting on posts is exactly to discourage people from posting that kind of content on the subreddit they're on. You really think people would go to subreddits if the highest upvoted content was the MOST RELEVANT and not the MOST LIKED?
---
Some streamers have been using it lately, so maybe people are memedecking it.
---
It also probably should be mentioned that he's got no Plague of Deaths in hand.  
---
As soon as I realised that he passed a turn and didn't clear my board again, I knew what happened.
---
I played quest rogue to rank 4 and then got bored and switched to druid.
---
Questing explorer and underbelly fence fit the archetype but they are just bad cards that aren't in my deck.
---
Same, Whizbang and Zayle (yes, I finally cracked) were the two cards that kept me playing until I was able to afford more expensive decks
---
Oh so he's rich, just like Bernie. And old and white. Just like Bernie. And implemented governement healthcare in Massachusetts. Just like Bernie wants to do for the nation.

Im pretty sure whizbang has a below 50% winrate. I think one of the priest iterations had a below 45%. I wouldnt consider his decks top tier.

Thank you for doing the math, I was feeling lazy :).  But that's the fun part of randomness, creates very interesting/tense situations that rarely affect the game.
