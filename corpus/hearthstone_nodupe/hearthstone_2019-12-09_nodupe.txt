I genuinely think they need to rework poisonous. It just makes stats and buffing irrelevant, especially with divine shield. How about making poisonous minions doing quadruple damage to enemy minions instead of instakill?
---
---
---
Not sure if you meant 11 - 15 or vice versa. Either way it’s pretty funny.
---
I really like running beasts as george, you can throw divine on your hyena and avoid taunts until late game
---
I was waiting for the "I have no time for games" line :D
---
Thank you, good luck to you as well!
---
yea i did, was kinda unlucky with the legendaries tho but got a lot of dust now.
---
**TL;DR:** Lightforged are crusaders who defend the innocent from the main universe, Lightbound are fanatics potentially indoctrinated into serving the Light under those with corrupt tenets. T'paartos before Yrel Blizz plz.
---

I'm not sure how much they'll continue to push Pure Paladin, but seeing as it will become notably weaker next expansion by nature of the card rotation (meaning Paladin will go from having the greatest amount cards it will have in a Standard rotation to the least amount of cards) I can see a Legendary Pure-Paladin addition being completely reasonable.
---
Yrel seems like the best choice, even if she is a Lightbound and not a Lightforged. And yes, there is a difference:
---
***The Lightbound:***
---
The Lightbound is the name of the collective of Light-fanatics on *Alternate Universe* Draenor following the defeat of the Burning Legion and death of Archimonde there. At the end of *Warlords of Draenor* (patch 6.3) when Grommash Hellscream, Yrel, and Khadgar banded together with the champions of Azeroth to defeat the left hand of the Burning Legion (the right hand being Kil'jaeden, who would fall in 7.2 and the head being Sargeras, who would be captured in 7.3), the Azerothians would return to their timeline which was based 35 years ahead of Alternate-Draenor's.
---
Some time later in patch 8.0.1 the Bronze Dragonflight would (inexplicably, because Battle for Azeroth is poorly written) assist the warmongering Horde in acquiring new allies. Eitrigg, an old-school veteran of the Old Horde and adviser of the New Horde, would assist an emissary of the Horde (hint: you) to venture back to Alternate Draenor... but things had changed.
---
While the Draenei and orcs had bought their own peace for a time following their *collaborative* defeat of the Burning Legion on their world, the Naaru, literal embodiments of the Holy Light, would begin to preach more and more extreme lessons to their devout followers. Yrel, a young Draenei who throughout the course of the Warlords of Draenor expansion had risen through the ranks and was given a literal symbol by (Alternate) Prophet Velen just prior to his death and became a central leader of her people, would also become the High Exarch of this Lightbound coalition.
---
By the time the emissary and Eitrigg had returned to Alternate Draenor, it was no longer 35 years in the past. Instead, it was the same present-day for them, with a much different history compared to what our Draenor looks like today (long story short: gone to shit because Ner'zhul blew it up by accident). The Naaru's teachings ran deep in an indoctrinated people. You may have noticed that I haven't referred specifically to the Lightbound as "Draenei," and that's because not all of them are.
---
Indeed, Alternate-Grommash Hellscream's own son (who is almost certainly not just another Garrosh Hellscream, since Garrosh's mother is dead in Alternate-Draenor and even high fantasy can't bullshit its way out of having an alternate-Garrosh Hellscream born of the same father but different mother) has been converted to join the Lightbound forces. And he is not the only one: orcs captured by the Lightbound, who appear to genuinely believe they are striving to save their erstwhile allies from heresy and corruption, will either become purified and join the forces of the Light, or die.
---
So you see, the Lightbound are almost a bit like the Tau of the Warhammer 40K universe. Not necessarily a single race, but embodied by a similar, pervasive doctrine that seems to, at least partially, overwrite and overrule its followers' own rational thinking.
---
Oh, and they pushed all of the non-Lightbound orcs off of Draenor by Battle for Azeroth, which is why they're now chilling on Azeroth.
---
***The Lightforged:***
---
The Lightforged are notably different. They are meant to be a part of the coalition of the universe's survivors of the Burning Legion who have been saved by the Light and are set against fighting the infinite demonic army for all eternity. It just so happens that a "coalition of the universe's survivors" includes nearly exclusively Draenei as far as any representation of the Army of the Light goes: including audiodramas, in-game, and novels (no offence Blizzard but Warcraft world-building is kinda lacking).
---
There are a few notable members of the Army of the Light, and hilariously enough none of them are Draenei:
---
1. High Exarch Turalyon, who underwent the ritual to become Lightforged after 40 years of service to the Army of the Light (hence why he rocks that silver hair), and had fought for them for around a thousand years before being reunited with Azeroth and his son, Arator the Redeemer.
---
2. Alleria Windrunner, lifemate of Turalyon and mother of Arator, former Ranger-Captain of Quel'Thalas and sister of Sylvanas Windrunner, is also deeply rooted into the cosmology of the Warcraft universe now that she has delved deep into the dark powers of the void. While she had learned to wield the Holy Light and even wreath her arrows in its power after only a couple of years, she parted from the Golden Army after approximately 500 years when she was forced to use shadow magic to save herself and Turalyon from their infiltration-mission on Argus, which had gone terribly wrong. Over the next 500 years she would seek out and even save the Locus-Walker, a powerful master of the Void who had seemingly resisted the shadow's whispers, and through his teachings would become more adept at wielding it *and* even save Turalyon's life from a powerful Man'ari eredar assassin known as Eradication.
---
3. Lothraxion, a member of the Army of the Light for thousands of years, after serving the Burning Legion for thousands himself. For anyone who doesn't know Lothraxion: he is actually a nathrezim, a dreadlord, just like Mal'Ganis or Tichondrius or Balnazzar. He had died multiple times in service to the Burning Legion but, as per his immortal demon soul, was always able to return to serve once again. Except... he once had a run-in with the Locus-Walker, who had pulled him *out* of the Twisting Nether in order to kill him (if a demon dies in the Twisting Nether, their 'home-realm', they die permanently), and had proclaimed that he had a destiny to fulfil. It would appear the Locus-Walker was correct, as Lothraxion would himself become suffused with the Light, possibly being Lightforged himself, and serve as a trusted commander of the Golden Army, even being a confidant of Alleria and Turalyon. He too would be saved by Alleria when she returned after her 500 year sojourn with new powers over the abyss. And unlike what you might expect from a loyal servant of the Light who has served for millennia, he, like Turalyon, had trust in Alleria even after her apparent fall to darkness. He's the ultimate bro.
---
With this said, there is the fanatical element of the Lightforged represented in two different ways. The first was Xe'ra, the Naaru Prime, who had led the Golden Army of the Light and who held an apparent fixation on a fulfilment of "Light's destiny." If you do not follow the path the Light had set out for you, you were an enemy, or at the very least unable to be trusted.
---
And in Battle for Azeroth, you find some Lightforged combatants that use some conventionally extremist language when beginning to fight the Horde. The basis of the Lightforged being extreme, however, is pretty bare. Xe'ra is dead, slain by Illidan Stormrage, and they are led by Turalyon, who tolerates and trusts Alleria Windrunner, who wields powers Xe'ra would regard as anathema to the Light. Lothraxion is the ultimate bro and hasn't made an appearance in Battle for Azeroth, and I'm not even sure any of the Lightforged Captains present themselves as particularly extremist, either.
---
Oh, plus they are in the same faction as literal Void Elves, so there's that.
---
In any case, it is clear that there are "purity" themes associated with both the Lightbound and the Lightforged. The difference is that the Lightforged seem to have generally altruistic and benevolent tenets, much like the humans' Church of the Holy Light, whereas the Lightbound seem to be more... possessed by the exultant need to spread their views and way of life to others. One is fundamentally rife with bigotry, and the other is a genuine defence of the innocent that may occasionally overstep its bounds at least a little.
---
This isn't to say at all that the Lightbound Yrel cannot fit into the "Lightforged Paladin" theme. I will, however, suggest that before we add Yrel, we add a much more candid and deserving character as a Pure Paladin Legendary.
---
My man, ***T'PAARTOS!***
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you! That's an awesome accomplishment, I hope I can do it too someday!
---
I know there is an app that changes your location so you can set it to an ongoing fireside address and just play the people over there. I know you can google it for all the details, it's how I got nemsey and open my packs early.
---
I think award guy is a blizzard developer that is working together with Reddit to keep the community in check so that future rants will be softened significantly.
---
He's also Chinese.
---
Thank you!!
---
they give you crap minions and you can make triples off the cards pretty easily and use that to generate higher tier minions. There really is nearly no downside. How this got released in its current state is beyond me, it’s like no one tested this out.
---
That's correct I've never purchased runs.
---
Right? It is not that the voice actress sounds bad. It just sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom that was large enough for a little echo...
---
Y
---
Obviously, the stats are doubled to 12/12 and +6/+6 on a Golden variation. The effect would trigger before any minions attack, if both players have them, whoever is attacking first would have theirs trigger first too (though with no other Start of Combat effects, yet, this is largely irrelevant).
---
The idea of the card is it's a tech choice like Zapp, powerful against certain boards whilst weak against others. Full board of Divine Shields? Great. No Divine Shields? Abysmal.
---
If the game is like a job when f2p, it's gonna feel like a job when paying as well.
---
Wont work, the game use it own date, the game cant pull back a mode that no longer exsists
---
If I'm just going for quests or tavern brawl and I see a priest I just concede. By the time I get in a new game and finish we would have been on about the 4th turn.
---
Whizbang the Woeful.

Maybe if we wait a couple of months, it will!

10/10 getting it.
---
can you compete with it?
---
And how do I know that now that cards are removed?
---
Shaku was a card that came back temporarily for the doom in the tomb even (the one with N’zoth and Rag) and that rotates out a couple days ago. He’s been put back into the hall of fame I believe
---
No, because no money
---
So?
---
I actually got 8th place the first time I played him. I still don't know how that's possible. (I'm ranked 4600-ish, which isn't amazing, so skill is probably a factor.)
---
One extra slot for a trash, normally that’s reserved for a buff minion but now you can’t really do that against rafaam can you?
---
Not flexing just saying because I wanted to add to the post that I was excited as well. Folks bashing others because they got jobs and buy the mega bundles isn't cool. Also bashing folks who just got into the game for the first time ever also not cool. I just started last month and decided that it probably would be fine to buy the mega pre order bundle to help me get up to speed against all the other hordes of players running OP decks. I bought it so I have a frickin fighting chance because everyone and their mother is playing really strong combo or lockdown decks or FTK decks. New folks like me should be at least given some serious leniency or something to help us more , instead we get bashed for the littlest things.  SIGH.... PSYDUCK SIGH....
---
Gentle Megasaur is indeed a problem currently.  You can have a board full of 1 attack murlocs w/ windfury, poison and divine shield that jollystops a super strong board of beasts, mechs etc.  Pumping their health up is easy between oracle and king, along with other rando menagerie buffs.
---
I am not a fan of "nerfing" generally though.  I would prefer to see other tribes be buffed some.  Currently the only way to get poison (other than Maexxna) is murlocs, only way to buff windfury is murlocs, only way to add DS is a one deathrattle, one magnetize or.....murlocs.
---
Yes and one of the background murlocs is wearing a mech-armor suit akin to starcraft gear!
---
You can play around it though lmao
---
I went up against a Rafaam as Curator early, put my 1/1 token in front instead of my amalgam. Lo and behold, gave him a shitty token minion
---
*repeatable this turn
---
What the holy crap I know I stopped playing for two months but you have 7k more than me.
---
I do have 4k dust tho.
---
how is that fair at all?
---
I think there's enough good dragons in DoD (not to mention Alexstrazsa) to give Highlander Paladin more of a midrangey gameplan, enabling some . It's definitely just theorycraft at this point, but I'm not sure I agree it's ready to be ruled out just yet.
---
I'd play the heck out of this.
---
That's just what Sylvanas sounds like.
---
In both modes skill is not determined by a result of one game, but rather by results of hundreds of games. The whole idea is to be good at identifying the probabilities and learning to make the right calls. The point of both modes is to try and use your brain to harness the RNG, that both modes are built around. So I'm not sure what you mean by "requires more RNG".
---
All echo cards cost a minimum of 1. I believe it was to counter sniplock
---
2/1 poisonous good game.
---
I’m trying to find out easy ways to beat the heroic chapter 5
---
Thank you, You're right. I've recently subbed here which has helped immensely! I discovered there were add ons for this game but as a mostly mobile user I've resorted to taking my time and reading the icy veins values as I go through the draft.
---
Yup. That’s definitely coming soon.
---
I always thought she’d make a good alt hero.  Though given Elise, Lazul, etc., why not both ?
---

---
some many frogs on board
---
Oof, 0 mana sound the bells was one of the better ways to cheese.
---
Legitimately my first thought when they announced the echo nerf.
---
Sounds like someone set an event at that address just to mess with people. I’d report the tavern. You can do that by going to the event page and scrolling all the way down to the bottom. If you can’t access the page anymore I’d contact support

In every past expansion, most OP decks are found in the first day.
---
If you play old decks you'll be crushed by the new power creep cards.
---
***Every single character you say?!?!?!***
---
How dare you forget about:
---
1. Grand Marshal Othmar Garithos, greatest human racist of the land... well, competing with:
---
2. Aedalas Blackmoore, (arguably) greatest human racist of the land.
---
3. Farseer Nobundo.
---
4. Elder Sage Akama.
---
5. Magna Aegwynn, mother of Medivh and longest-running Guardian in the history of Guardianship.
---
6. Alodi, the First Guardian and one of the few notable half-elves in the Warcraft universe.
---
7. Meryl Winterstorm/Felstorm, a human mage so powerful that his own arcane power has kept him alive for... well, nearly three thousand years. SERIOUSLY?! This guy is dope AF, he's not even a Guardian and his power has kept him 'alive' in undeath. That's legendary.
---
8. Broll Bearmantle, the third member of the gladiator team that won the Dire Maul bout: the other two being Valeera Sanguinar and [Varian Wry--](https://imgur.com/7oE6pen) I mean [Lo'Gosh.](https://imgur.com/JGGp8OD)
---
9. ~~Med'an, but we don't talk about him.~~
---
9. Queen Azshara, the hottest night elf to ever exist (and I'm not joking when I say some night elves would probably tell you that).
---
10. Teron'gor/Teron Gorefiend, one of the first-generation death knights created by Gul'dan.
---
11. A few of the founding members of the Silver Hand. Tirion Fordring and Uther Lightbringer are in the game, but you're missing Saidan Dathrohan, Gavinrad the Dire, and Turalyon - Turalyon who later becomes High Exarch of the Golden Army of the Light. So yeah, he's kinda a big deal.
---
12. Xe'ra, Naaru Prime.
---
13. Lothraxion, a friggin' Light-suffused Demon of all things. He is also the ultimate bro as [I explain in rudimentary detail here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e80z2v/dear_blizzard_please_give_us_yrel_as_a_paladin/fa8ks88/)
---
14. Archbishop Alonsus Faol, the one who founded the Order of the Silver Hand alongside Uther Lightbringer, but never himself became a Paladin.
---
15. Many members of the Titan-Keeper, including off the top of my head: Loken, Tyr, Thorim, Odyn, Archaedas and Freya. Also Helya, though technically she's just a Titan-forged sorceress and not a Titan-Keeper.
---
16. Galakro-- wait, nevermind. He's coming.
---
17. Algalon the Observer, a guy I was so hoping to help the League of Explorer's in the Saviors of Uldum expansion since he has a bit of lovely banter with Brann Bronzebeard, and some amazing voice acting in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMkRWwYyWd0) He also happens to be part of a mysterious race known as the constellar, conscripted by the titans to watch over their ordered worlds. Suffice to say, he's pretty badass in his own right.
---
19. Oh, yeah. Maybe we're still missing ***every member of the bloody Pantheon?!*** Let's see if I remember them all: Norgannon and Golganneth (get those two out of the way since I always forget), Aggrammar (Sargeras' protege), Aman'Thul (the Zeus-like leader of the whole lot), Eonar the Life-Binder (whose title inspired Alexstrasza's no doubt, and Eonar supposedly has ties to Elune), Sargeras obviously before he got turned, and... I'm missing one. Khaz'garoth! There we go! The dwarven-looking one with strength of earth.
---
20. Now that I think about the Pantheon, I can also say we're missing Argus the Death Titan/World-Soul.
---
21. Archimonde and Kil'jaeden, the left and right hands of the Burning Legion, are also missing.
---
22. A few notable dreadlords are missing. We only really have Mal'Ganis. We're still missing Balnazzar, Tichondrius, and Kathra'natir. There's a couple others I'm missing here, but I'm going only off of memory right now so...
---
I could go on, but I've taken the joke far enough, I think.
---
I'll just finish by saying that Blizzard has failed us by not including the most important character in the lore yet. My boy, ***T'PAARTOS!***
---
Edit: Aww crap I dishonour myself by failing to mention [Lei Shen, the Thunder King.](https://imgur.com/MQOlPZo) Seriously, this guy is cool and badass enough that he could have been the focus of an entire expansion. I mean, [not many characters get to fight a Tiger Wild God](https://imgur.com/3YrdJOF) for a whole month non-stop *and win.*
---
I'm not very good at this gamemode, so I had lost roughly 1k rating from 5.5k down.. A whole lot of it was never getting offered a single buff or scaling minion and losing within minutes. At least this game didn't go as terribly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yogg's final board was 3 of those beefy bois that get health per player health lost.  Still won tho.
---
We’re talking about battlegrounds mate, stoneskin basilisk isn’t in it.
---
**RIBBIT INTENSIFIES**
---
You are not a dick for saying this, this was my first thought after reading title and after reading this comment I just got confirmed he is either bad player or bad deckcrafter (I doubt its about draw luck).
---
[I got this last week.](https://imgur.com/a/AjyBm3m) I do not mean to show my virtual penis but just to show general idea of ideal mana curve (especially for hunter). And yes I do also get bad runs, currently I am at 1 wins 2 losses (I have 2 meme legendaries and n'zoth without deathrattles in deck) but I intend to leave it there since you get free arena ticket if you have unfinished arena when new expansion drops.
---
Edit: latter part is for /u/longtermruse
---
I meant for just in battlegrounds. Some mechanics are already different in battlegrounds like magnetizing mechs doesn't count as a minion being summoned in regular hearthstone, but it triggers cobalt in battlegrounds, so why not change poisonous too? Poisonous destroys the late game strategies, especially when murlocs just became OP.
---
Where can you view that data?
---
Look, it’s a ballschinian!
---
Haha nice, I’m a mostly mobile user myself! I used to use icyveins, but now I use lightforge.com myself, though sometimes it’s a challenge shuttling between the app and the website.(it has a search function!)
---
Like the poster below me says, there is a sort of ideal curve(like maybe 2-4 1 drops 5-8 2 drops??) that I tend to curve towards(stricter when my cards offered are worse, and less so when I’m offered good board state flipping cards)
---
Always keep in mind your win condition when drafting: 
---
1. win board control from the start, and batter your opponent down without running out of value 
---
2. if the board control is even, some cards can flip the board state (eg. Kraken, phoenix, bonemare etc)
---
3. if you’re hopelessly behind SOME cards can bail you out into a 3-drop on board like dragonfire or felfire or volcano/ elemental destruction but if you win from there it’s usually the last win con rather than really flipping the board.
---
4. drain your opponent out of cards by aoe and 2-for-1 trades (rare, and needs lots of good cards)
---
Your priority should usually be wincon1 because you have control of this usually: it depends least on getting the rare, good cards and if your opponent doesn’t have those rare cards(or just doesn’t draw them) you win.
---
Sorry if the thought process is a little messy just a rough summary of my reasoning for drafting
---
Not released yet and was already nerfed
---
priest, rogue, shaman weren't OTKs though
---
ooga booga I see boogeymen everywhere
---
Every game I’ve ever won has been with Beasts. Murloc RNG is not with me.
---
Yes, that is definitely annoying. It will take a few weeks to learn. He is still probably over-tuned, but not super broken. Issue is if people learn to play against him and you change his hero power to 2 mana he likely becomes trash as you're just throwing away gold.
---
I'd definitely play the new 3 drop instead of Ahmet.
---
This actually might be the push demons need, and it's kind of fair because you can't give these poisonous or divine shields and taunt only through argus I believe.
---
I’ve played as him multiple times. And most players do play around him. A million boombots. Yes, you will get an upgrade. But just like playing around nef’s hero power, you do that to avoid making him bigger. Sure it’s nice early one. But it just doesn’t scale.
---
only 4k gold here but \~100 packs from last xpac to open from arenas, hopefully that's enough dust

Update your app then u can get it
---
&gt;Can someone explain the other 2 awards for me? I know gold, silver and plat but what are the legend and "5" one?
---
that should explain one of them for you.
---
Random minion with +1/+1 buff with yogg for 2. But you think a random minion with no buff should cost 3?
---
I think for Battlegrounds, they should have Poisonous behave similar to Divine Shield where it goes away after the minion’s first trade.
---
I get that the DS mechanics are what they are, especially with the mechs, but I’d like for the end of the game to come down to the attack and health buffs players have spent the entire game working on.
---
I’ve see him not get first place many times.
---
Just play Embiggen and turn Ysera, Unleashed into a 10 cost minion.
---
&gt;15 - Isn't that the case already?
---
From what I remember it's based on what tier the minion is. Something like 4 tier 6 minions, 5 tier 5 minions, 6 tier 4 minions etc.
---
It would be a somewhat minor change, but it would make late game cards more common.
---
Indeed we do. I learned the hard way that opening my packs at a Fireside Gathering was a contender for wasted dust lol. Never again!
---
Those were bonus clips after he already showed us OTKs with those classes.
---
If we ever get a set about pretty and cutesy things, we'll almost certainly get a rainbow elemental for Shaman and a unicorn for Priest.
---
How is it possible?
---
Maybe not Chinese, but I definitely think that it's one of the devs.
---
I doubt Blizzard would want to change how a keyword works in different modes since that would be confusing, so I just asumed it would affect every mode.
---
Demon does need a 6 star, but this isn't it! Activating deathrattles on your turn could be interesting, but destroying your own large minions late when poison murlocs rules the meta, seemsbadman
---
Curator died in 8th place. He was collecting these things before it had taunt.
---
Run raid leader to tech against this strat lol.
---
Dailies and 80g friend quests. Plus they threw tons of gold at us recently with a bunch of 100g quests.
---
Every strategy relies on buffing late game, but the particular Bran/Lightfang strategy is not the only way to buff. A board with 4 carries, Bran, Lightfang and a rotating buff slot won't necessarily hold up against a Baron Rivendale build. Those buffed carries won't necessarily be bigger than a demon build can pump up its Wrath Weaver and Floating Watcher. A Mama Bear build can also outsize the Bran/Lightfang build. While a Kangor's Apprentice build can outlast it.
---
Also with 2 losses,  you like living on the edge, right? 
---
Congrats
---
Ah yes i see. I still don't get "karl".
---
Something like George and Lenny from of mice and men mixed with the Simpson's Lenny and Karl?
---
It just needs a counter. The ENTIRE problem with poison right now is that megasaur can shield your board. Divine shield was SUPPOSED to be the counter. But if the murloc player's board is also covered in it, it completely fails to be one.
---
Just remove megasaur and the ability to divine shield murlocs. THAT is why they're the meta play right now. Not the poison, the fact that they can counter their own counter.
---
the honest reply lmao
---
&gt; My issue with adapting as a whole is that you are looking for two things. *[Poisonous and Divine Shield]*
---
&gt; +3 attack or something is completely useless.
---
Do you not know how to read?
---
Blizzard: “Lol here’s a kobold hero instead!”
---
Bingo. The solution I think is to get rid of megasaur.
---
*Cries in Demon*
---
No :(
---
Althought this is amazing
---
I don't know why they downvote you, mostly of the people in this sub knew about murozond.
---
I use it and it's such a powerful card if used correctly, however if your luck of draws aren't good it's pretty mediocre
---
Problem with juggler is it absolutely has no way to scale. The most damage it can ever do is 6 and any opponent with a beefy board is just going to totally disregard it. 
---
Late game when all the minions are between 30-50 health, it's essentially lost its efficacy.
---
I'm sure she will.
---
You can't catch a dead man!
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/George_and_Karl
---
I'm not sure how they came up with the names.
---
it must require you to have played a certain amount because I just have an empty button there.
---
are you really trying to come off as the victim here?
---
Who made this? The actual art is amazing
---
go beg somewhere else pls, nobody is handing out a free $50
---
I don't think that is a valid gold-earning method for 99.99% of players; I usually instead use it to get packs cheaper (I average ~5 wins). At start of expansion I'll buy 30-40 packs and then after first couple weeks I'll head to arena to get more. I usually will not spend all my gold doing this though since I don't play an insane amount.
---
I approve of this image.
---
what a dumbass
---
I was surprised to find that deathwing actually has a decent few. With these newest heroes they seem to be adding a bunch of lines that trigger when you play certain cards, which other older alt heroes don't have many or any of as far as I know

Not sure if you’re actually confused but if you are able to double a tidehunter’s battlecry (usually through shudderwock’s hp but in this case with khadgar) and play a second tidehunter, you’ll receive a triple from the murlocs produced by the battlecries.  It’s actually pretty useful when playing shudderwock as it can give you an easy early triple reward while leaving a minion that you can easily still trade for an extra coin and board space.

And the thing is this with brann actually only destroys the 2 minions adjacent twice not 4 minions across the board so if the gold version does that in value already and it gets a brann trigger its actually 8x the stats.
---
Not really, I have higher, and it means damage dealt by minions* in a single turn.
---
You're just swapping RNG. If you do this, you'd probably be the first to complain when you deal 0 damage instead of 8 because he killed your Egg on the final turn.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
But I guess you’d have to get invited first.
---
Jaraxxus is actually pretty good imo. Especially with that minion that says ‘whenever a friendly demon dies, deal 6 dmg to random enemy’
---
Oh man. I am also f2p and I used to always get 0 to 4 wins in arena. But one time during the event where they hand out 2 free arena passes, my first run got me 5 wins and my second one got me 10. Congrats dude. It does feel good.

Didn't you make this exact same obvious post with the same title for the Dread Raven card? We get it, you played WoW.

I noticed this bug too! I've been playing Tombs consistently since it released, and I think it is a recent bug, though I can't quite pinpoint what causes it.
---
I had the same passive treasure of "All minions have Rush", and it also caused my game to crash. The other passive treasure was the "VIP Taverns". 
---
I feel like I've had other runs where I didn't have the "All minions have Rush" and the 7 Murloc treasure worked properly. I'll go test it out.
---
Probably because what is cool for someone it is boring for someone else.

Surely we must hve seen every possible combination by this point, so can we stop having  this bug be 20% of the front oage?

Well its not P2W directly since you still can get all the heros and are able to do decently (~4th) with any hero if you play correctly and dont get fucked over completely.

\[\[Mechano Egg\]\] got 0 attack. It's not really a good way to get gold as you need:
---
1) Tier 5 to get the Egg in the Tavern
---
2) A \[\[Baron Rivendare\]\] on Board
---
3) A golden Baron Rivendare would only "give" you 3 gold, which is the same cost as Mechano Egg.
---
If you want free gold you should get a golden Brann + golden Khadgar &amp; buy one of the tier 1 minions that summon another minion, you will get 3 golden tokens for a total of 4 gold + 3 you get to discover 3 minions. However I think you need 6 slots on the board for this to work.

Except that if Rafaam attacks first he may kill your Amalgam every time regardless of your positioning and he's also more likely to attack first because he'll have more minions in play on average in the early game.
---
Maybe he's preparing more in the meantime, we'll see soon
---
Don’t think it does no. Would be neat though !

Hahaha, alright dude. My bad, I misunderstood the the purpose of your post. May RNGesus smile on you in all your games.
---
You mean horses are hung like King Bagurgle?
---
I disagree
---
They just inverted it. Before. standard was insufferable due to turn 4 win Shamans. Now it’s at least somewhat bearable whereas battlegrounds is just whoever stacks divine shield poison murlocs wins
---
what happened to Tides? did he finally burn out?
---
Anti armour is a tech card. You use it if Warrior/Druid with high armour is a T1 deck and many use them. This is why soo many run secret eater in wild becaus of secret mage.
---
depends how many packs like this you get:
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/XaUccnk](https://imgur.com/gallery/XaUccnk)
---
It's technically just a worse Doomsayer. Costs 1 less, sure, but it also dies quicker (5hp vs 7hp) and doesn't necessarily kill enemy minions, just damages them for 5. So basically you're spending 1 mana in addition to being in need of an AOE if there are any 6hp or higher minions left on opponent's board. That's not good at all.
---
There must always be an award guy.
---
And that’s a re-used art from King Bagurgle, Terror of the Tides from the WoW TCG. I found this exact discussion about the art back in 2015!
---
&gt;emoving poison from bg would delete murlocs completely as they don't have any scaling units.
---
That's not true anymore, as they have Bagurgle.

---
Honestly, the best use case for VC's hero power, in my experience, was a beast token build unit where he used it to buff up his golden pack leader. He pushed his pack leader to ~20 HP which meant that he didn't have to stress too much about it getting knocked off the board. This meant his deathrattles could do their magic without much issue.
---
If they were a narcissist they would've revealed themselves or let someone reveal them.
---
Plus hes gilded comments and posts that correctly guess things about him
---
They did, but it was more limited than previously.
---
You must be new to the internet, or just unobservant
---
And you felt like pointing that out too?
---
When? Don't you mean just Fireside gatherings that were available to everyone? That doesn't count.
---
Thanks! I wish I put this much dedication into my exams :’)
---
No, I don’t stream :(
---
I would have been impressed by his "Dwarf riding a gryphon" meme, but the other two cards are very iconic.
---
A select group of streaming personalities were given full access to the set for a few hours after the final reveal stream. Trump was one of these streamers and he's been uploading highlights with stuff like Dragon Paladin and Galakrond Shaman since then.
---
Thanks for the comment! How about something like this? https://imgur.com/a/NhqAnqY 
---
I tried to make the overall image smaller while keeping the same text size (so it appears bigger)
---
They should put in something else thing. I dont think bargurgle is enough to make them late game viable.  Megasaur is too OP though if youre lucky.
---
fair enough
---
Usually when I place 4th, I lose about 35-100 pts so I have to place first or second to even climb.
---
Rng
---
100% agree, if you understand what tempo is, then you are already a step further than most players. If gives you also an understanding why certain cards which appear to be OP, as a beginning player, are not played. 
---
Zalae is a big supporter of 'Tempo is good', but maybe not the best stream to start with. Other comments already mentioned it, but I think you have to look to four year old HS video's of Trump or another streamer. Look for instruction video's of the 'legends' as Kibler, Disguised Toast, Kripp.
---
The concept of HS stays the same, only the cards are getting better with each expansion.
---
Once you get to legend there is no turning back mate!
---
Yup! #1 at the moment :)
---
I think it was limited access. There's a lot of footage on YouTube from Trump and Regis playing in it. Sometimes they'd play a patron player, but sometimes it was other big players like Kolento or Rdu.
---
Too weak, too reliant on Mal'ganis and too easy to fall into the trap that the 1 drop that damages you when you summon a demon is a good T1 pick.
---
ffs it is ridiculus that how far you can go in this system. Your dedication is admirable
---
If they removed everything reddit thinks is OP from the game there would be nothing left.
---
Rafaam pretty good if your opponents give you good cards. Especially if they give you a card that leads to triple. 
---
In my opinion, I think if the hero power went to 2-cost. You won’t be able to spam it every round. Especially the early rounds where he’s most likely to get what your comp. needs.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I really digged down on those basic things the past 4 months to get the fullest now! xD I believe around 4 legendaries will make me really satisfied and happy
---
Thank you! Congratulations to you too! :)
---
Yep, at seven wins you're granted more than 150 gold as reward.
---
The thing is I am a f2p since I started playing so can't really be picky on what I want and what I use. I hope i can get to a point where i do that once. But I believe this is going to take a while.
---
In before he posts "only got 3 legendary cards I'm going to uninstall" whine.
---
&gt; His power pushes you to use what you get instead of going for synergy with a tribe.
---
That's the beauty of menagerie build. Brann and Lightfang are also both still relevant. Furthermore, if opponents change their setup to deny you minions, then you basically win every trade. There's no downside.
---
Dragon Rogue just feels so underwhelming. They got only one class dragon which is very susceptible to silence effects. Maybe you're that there will be enough decent neutral dragons, but I just don't see it happening when there are better cards to draw with in Rogue.
---
I believe it will. With so many powerful cards meta I believe will be really unstable! Really interested to see how things will roll.
---
No he was active at least a week
---
The murloc package is mostly Classic. There isn't much after Boomsday that can help, so I'd recommend Vicious Fledgling (Ungoro) at a minimum and Mossy Horror (Witchwood) if you want some consistency.
---
I hope I do! Best luck to you too!!
---
I will be forever disappointed if she doesn't have one for Arthas.
---
The starcraft and WoW appearances are basically concurrent, but the WoW appearance was actually a little earlier, because starcraft 2 wouldn't be released for another 7 months after the blizzcon that the WoW pet was given from.
---
I dont think its brode or kripp pretty sure it's someone here
---
It was toxic and got what it deserved.
---
I genuinely thought of it but I think waxadred made in before he did sadly.
---
Winning ain't what it used to be
---
What about the class where he destroys minions in your deck? Or something like that (can't remember)
---
"Why not both?"
---
Yes, there is even countdown somewhere on this subreddit page!
---
Already opened mine at a firesie gathering, will probably play warlock since i got all of them and warrior because of the ancharrr
---
Yup this is rite 👍. Dudes a genius
---
Lol, just hide the right arrow on the deck screen and only advanced user will know to tap there for more
---
I got 5th place and +2
---
Because hes just not worth it to me when I basically have to run togg waggle no matter what and I'd rather have more combo peices to win the game quicker
---
wait what? is there any information on the adventure you could link to?
---
sorry i haven’t heard of this yet
---
Depends on how f2p you are
---
He’s currently fighting it out in the bg rolling people as a tier 1
---
Yes, they got more, then afterwards they got one card.
---
That is probably what's going to happen, yeah. Granted, the Waxadred Deathrattle Rogue probably won't really be a Dragon deck, and there's enough Deathrattle activators in Rogue that it's apparent vulnerability will be minimized.
---
I'm so jelly, how many decks did you have to open?
---
You either spent money or you didn't.
---
Why not?
---
Craft mossy horror if you don't have it...it will help a lot  with all classes since you can end phase 2 instantly...
---
SHE IS AWESOME!
---
damn
---
You think chen is gonna be any good? I got one (not golden) but feel like burning 3 cards will be rare
---
Nice! Ancharr seems really good on pirate warrior. Plus the warlock legendary which increases your hand size seems interesting!
---
Yeah but yog is instant and makes the curve alot smoother especially 4 into 5 gold
---
Listen here, kaiba-boy, I want a toon expansion!
---
For Druid, you obviously want strong taunts and Jade Idol. For Rogue, you could make a combo deck for that (I used Mecha'thun for Rogue).
---
DURO, MONSTA CARDO
---
Had a paladin one with 4 legendaries go 12-0 yesterday. Gl!
---
TRIFLING GNOME
---
Duh, sorry, i was thinking florists reduced by 5.
---
Can't really play jade since I have no cards of that deck
---
Same just happened on the Murloc wing with sir finly. Although if you manage to kill yourself and the opponent at once you always get to restart that fight usually with a different boss this can happen normally usually with warlock self-harm cards
---
I was excited to try dragon rogue, some shadow step with frizz to reduce malygos and then alexstraza malygos finisher
---
Get the pre-order. You'll earn Classic packs for free over time, and since Classic remains in Standard forever, it's often more worthwhile to craft Classic cards in the long run while maximizing your chances to open valuable expansion cards in packs.
---
Just means you are not very good at deckbuilding. Your argument is that you don’t know how to counter decks you encounter in the first few weeks and are surprised and do poorly.  But if you were to make a good, solid deck on its own, then you would be the one surprising your opponents and they would be the ones not knowing how to play against you.
---
Another option: https://imgur.com/a/mypuBob
---
Edwin work well also with the 3-coin-if-invoked-twice guy
---
Haha I edited it as you were replying. For 108 packs you'd expect about 4 legendaries, and I got 7, so pretty awesome!
---
Alarmo bot qnd stubborn gastropod (a xommon from ungoro) lets you cheese like 5 classes with him if you just hard mulligan for it.
---
Nice
---
Hmmm... Maybe something that draws 5 cards and deal 5 damage?
---
&gt; more then
---
Perish.
---
Molten Giants work out great in Hunter and Warlock, as well.
---
100 packs is 5.75 legends on average. Plus the one that comes with the bundle, Sath'rovar and all the Galakronds.
---
AR YA READY MRGLS?!?
---
Ancient art of gathering irl xp to beat your friend's big brother in an offline 1v1 game is not entirely lost, it seems.
---
You pre-order up until the set goes live which is usually 10 AM Blizzard time (PST). At least for Americas.
---
I've got waxdred in 2 packs out of 7. And suddenly it doesn't feel strong anymore. 7/5 for 5, when there is 8/8 rush neutral for 4 so-so. Also whole deck countered by one silence.
---
Literally, Sindragosa was in the trailer.
---
Are you reading the same thing I am? Because I'm seeing a big advantage for Nefarian.
---
There is a person who doesn't like dragons??? :O
---
Korialstrasz, Ebyssian, Tarecgosa, Kairozdormu, and Eranikus - "You guys got cards??"
---
Assuming nobody removes card from the pool?
---
I also feel excited and dissapointed at the same time when opening packs.
---
This can't be what blizzard intends, but every "non generic aggrodeck" needs 5+ legendaries and 10+ epics in order to function.
---
Nah, he’s great for getting 1st places if you make it to the endgame, but his hero power is not very useful early on so can easily get knocked out before it even becomes relevant.
---
But cycling Bagurgles lets you continuously upgrade your army, which is the whole point of scaling.
---
About murozond, It seems to be a good value tool against control decks and targetless spells i.e. Luna's pocket, Blizzard, Flamestrike, ferocious howl, the new shaman summon two 5/6 taunts, and against aggro might be just awful.
---
Not the +3 attack one.
---
You have a +1/+1 adapt though.
---
Watch out for his... lance?
---
3k isn't gonna get you 6 legends.
---
Personally I enjoy the freedom of a (near) full collection so I got the regular bundle with \~8k gold and \~5k dust saved up. Should be enough, but if need be I'll farm Brawliseum for a bit.
---
I get you. But just as a forewarning, Trump also though at the beginning of SoU that the most optimized version of Highlander Hunter would be a deck that ran a secret package with 2 Hyena Alpha, which ended up being an overall poor idea.
---
The F2P players on this board save up like 4-7k gold between expansions that allows them to buy many packs. Sure, you're not getting multiple packs worth of gold a day just for playing, but that's a good thing not a bad thing. The way they've designed card obtaining is to not oversaturate the meta by letting everyone get exactly what they want instantly. Even with money you dont get exactly what you want, I bought 60 packs and got three legendaries. This game is fairly balanced monetarily compared to most titles on the market.
---
I'm not sure how you'd factor in what other people might freeze/take.
---
I'm not seeing it. doing this with voidlords? I may be dumb.
---
Depends what you expect from game. If you want all the meta decks it will be a rough ride. If you are more casual player and 2-3 meta decks are fine to you then it's okay
---
Such is the life of f2p. I'm sure you'll find a few decks both you and gf can play with the packs and dust you get from the openings though!
---
Tbh we beat the shit out of him. Literally. Because screw the second and third phase of that fight.
---
But then we also whopped Rafaam's ass and there he is again...
---
Yeah playing shaman gay af. Even smol indie company knows this.
---
Wait really? I just assumed you only got the galakronds for free.
---
I don't take any player's word as gospel when they make predictions, we've seen plenty of times how wrong they can be. But I think he makes a compelling point about Necrium Apothecary. I genuinely don't think Deathrattle Rogue will be good enough, but if it does succeed despite my expectations, I think the Apothecary would be a massive reason why.
---
There are a lot of cards that I look at and think are fantastic but don't see play - it doesn't mean they're not fantastic, it often just means they don't get the support they need.
---
how can you grind so little gold? only with a daily quest a day u should be able to grind +65 packs plus the events
---
Proof?
---
Did you just made a joke?!?! Down voted.
---
How come you have opened packs? I can't yet... hmm
---
Sounds like [https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3861](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3861)
---
You cant really. You would need a lot of data, which you wont get, and could only find out average chance at which turn.
---
In its current state these statistics arent really helpful. Getting a tier 6 minion when you just hit 6 as the first guy to do so, while everyone else removed a shitton of low tier from the pool, has a MUCH higher chance.
---
I have the same thing. Also I get randomly disconnected for a turn or 2 but that might just be my crappy wifi
---
f2ps who have been grinding for 6 years****
---
Why start an Arena run? Runs don't expire when new cards are added, only when cards are deleted from the Arena pool or a special event takes place in Arena.
---
Has there been any announcement for this?
---
Bro, Nozdormu was the dragon I always gravitated to the most. I fucking love his classic cards effect, but boy do I wish it was either cheaper or he had someway to not get removed so easily. 
---
But this Lore shit right here, and killing himself (ie, an alternate version of himself) in such a moral/noble way, that sealed the deal.
---
Lack of scaling doesn't impact them too much due to:
---
* Cross tribal synergy and buffing
---
* Murlocs largely having lower tier units making them plentiful - easy to get triples - more buffs
---
* Bagurgle adding even MORE buffs
---
* Brann being a thing, allowing for many of these buffs to start firing off twice fairly early
---
* The "discover a murloc" card making it even easier to cherry pick out buffing Murlocs and/or complete triples
---
Playing for second place in Battlegrounds is a perfectly acceptable outcome and comes with the benefit of eventually getting you out of bad lobbies where the other 6 players are constantly giving Rafaam donations.
---
My other tip would be to not bulk dust your duplicates in this expansion after opening your packs. You may be a bit dust hungry wanting an optimal deck as f2p but dusting extras early after the expansion drops isn't a great idea. Instead individually scrounge dust from crap cards and hold onto OP cards. It will take some time to potentially nerf those cards but the dust payoff could be much greater.
---
 
---
Speaking of crafting. It almost goes without saying that it's best to wait a little while until the dust settles (haha) before crafting cards. You don't want to end up with the Troggzor of the set by jumping the gun.
---
better to overdo it a bit and nerf few cards if needed (since dont know yet how will pan out,escpially with 35cards coming aswell a month later) then have a weak set thats not used and have to buff evry card if ever want to use use.
---
Given Murlocs' placement as the counter to massive Demon boards due to the presence of Poisonous stuff, Gental Megasaur is probably fine, especially since its it is a tier six minion.
---
when is the adventure portion supposed to come?
---
Because that one gameplan actually lets you win
---
Brilliant
---
Except now you're forcing people to pay attention and play suboptimally to work around your hero power. It's pretty common for example for people to use their Lightfangs to pop D-Shields, since in a typical Lightfang comp it's the only small minion. They can't do that anymore or they just gave you enormous value.
---
But it's true. Murlocs are completely dependant on Megasaur
---
The only time I pick it is with AFK if it is available on her turn 3 and I can pick a Watcher. Otherwise you just lose your first 2 turns and usually end up being offered no demons
---
you pay money if you want to play all the decks, you don't have to pay anything if you just want to play 3-6 decks, hell, I have nearly every meta deck for every class aside from mage, and i am completley f2p.
---
I'm sure the hearthstone devs are in a frantic frenzy trying to fix everything right now due to the expansion. 
---
I imagine right now it looks a lot like the Spongebob epiaode where you see the inside of his brain and it's a bunch of mini Spongebobs running around, papers everywhere, and everything on fire.
---
I rolled another Watcher on the very next roll, but I sold the Imp gang boss for science and Zerused Watcher did combine when played, after everything resolved(self damage and buffing)
---
You're playing a dangerous game there!
---
Fun fact, Sindragosa actually appears on two Battlegrounds heroes (her own, and in the background of AF Kay)
---
If that's the case, buying both pre-order bundles can be argued to be a bit excessive. However, if you do enjoy the game and get as many games in as your schedule will allow, don't feel that bad about it.
---
Maybe, in the future, you can buy the smaller pre-order, wait a couple weeks for the good decks to properly materialize, and build the two or three you most want to play. That'll save you about eighty dollars each time, and I would expect you to be able to play what you currently do.
---
I used to but decided this expansion would be different, so I cancelled my pre-order and will open a whopping 11 or so packs on release instead of the 100+ and, honestly, I really don't care. I'll update my Highlander Hunter deck with a few commons that I'll craft if I don't pull them, I'll figure out if I can slot my guaranteed legendary from my first ten packs into something, do the same with Galakrond, pick up Sylvanus and find myself $85ish up from where I'd have been otherwise.
---
You mean Formerly Chuck's Shredder.
---
Next up: FINLEY VS JARAXXUS
---
I mostly agree. Cobalt is amazing, but Soul Juggler and Watcher would also be great for OP. Tier 4 is fairly bad for demons.
---
Blitzchung drama happened right when Doom in the Tomb event got released. The normal "hype" around new meta couldn't happen, because anyone talking about Hearthstone on Hearthstone sub was downvoted to hell. It took like 1.5-2 weeks for people to stop talking about Blitzchung here, only then people could actually post HS related stuff without getting downvoted hard. So we were already well into the event, and the meta was already the stale Shamanstone created by Evolve. Then, the sub was indeed slow for the next ~2 weeks, but like I've said, that's part of the natural cycle. Meta was stale, there was nothing new to talk about...
---
But then 2 weeks later BlizzCon happened - people were talking about new expansion etc. Then normally we would have another slowdown (there's always one between expansion's announcement and card reveal season) but Battlegrounds went out and everyone talked about it.
---
And yes, you are exaggerating, because there were like 3.5 weeks between when Blitzchung drama started and BlizzCon happened. And I think that we can all agree that we had a bunch of activity on this sub after BlizzCon. So how could we have a month of slowdown after Blitzchung controversy?
---
They should put Khadgar in there.
---
Does this account for the fact the first wing is usually free? At the very least in one knight in kahrazan and naxxaramas I remember wing 1 being free.
---
Hard disagree. Poison saves battlegrounds quite honestly.
---
been waiting for a good one lol
---
This is intended, since the card in hand technically still is a Zerus, and not the minion you would be playing.
---
Wıth the free galakronda can maybe do couple fun decks :)
---
That sounds like a great idea honestly. I gotta get my mind right

Spending money only becomes an issue when you’re neglecting things you shouldn’t be with your finances or putting yourself in debt for it. If neither of those apply to you, then look at how you spend money in other games too. Do you do the same in another game and you’re just spreading yourself thin? 
---
If none of those apply to you and you are still enjoying yourself then it shouldn’t matter. If you don’t have other habits that cost money like smoking, Starbucks daily, constantly eating out, then its fine. 
---
If you aren’t enjoying the game, maybe it’s time to break the cycle. Buy only preorders and be content with what you have. Learn to dust stuff you have to focus on things you know you will enjoy more instead of just amassing cards for no purpose or intent. 
---
I used to spend a lot per expansion collecting everything but still always found myself playing my favorite classes all the time anyways. I have moved to only one preorder, usually the biggest, and just dealing with what I got. I only play 3 classes now and have dusted every card from other classes because after 10k wins I know what I like. Even if a deck looks super fun, I know I’ll play it for a couple games here and there but always go back to my tried and true. Don’t be so hard on yourself if it isn’t necessary, enjoy your hobbies as much as the next person.

Bobb is ojt of minions?

No it cannot

since the end of naxx... hold on

naxx out??
---
Old time adventures were a set of PVE wings or "levels" that once you beat them awarded you with cards of all rairities from common to legendary. I'd say we're getting about 4 or 5 legendaries and about 8 or so epics. It's usually the best bang for your buck. Cehck out the card rewards for both Nax and League of Explorers for any estimate.
---
Yes
---
Ohhh okay thank you!
---
Is it the same with Dalaran Heist and Doom in the Tomb?
---
That would just make it all the more swingy and frustrating to lose to.
---
Agreed. You can just megasaur a board full of terrible murlocs and beat almost every possible composition.
---
And the only reason it might lose is some lucky soul jugglers.

---
Yeah I normally watch too, but for at least the first week I try to avoid all of it! Good luck!
---
No, I mean that the "status" of legendary means nothing. What makes Murk-Eye a legendary card? Just the fact that in regular Hearthstone you can only have one copy of it in your deck.
---
Hmm, odd they compare it to quests, not really consistent with other Hero or C\`Thuun cards then, as both can be generated in Arena.
---
I actually got my first 1st place with Jaraxxus and I got it while disconnected for 10 straight minutes. There were like 5 players left and I had a pretty decent game so far with an early triple Wrath Weaver, Amalgams, triple Img Gang boss, Voidlord, Mal'Ganis, a bunch of those minions that give stats to demons when I got disconnected in the start of a fight. When I was able to get my internet working I came back thinking I had lost until I noticed a "1" in the 1st place stat.
---
STICKYYYYY FINGAAAAHHS
---
Your mind will get even more blown when you realize Murozond is an anagram of Nozdormu
---
I think it's because unlike C'thun or other Hero cards, they are limited to half the classes.
---
Having a mechano egg either deal one or five damage would be very confusing.
---
A post like that would probably garner awards with or without the random gifter.
---
You probably will also want to save some gold to buy up the single player content when it comes out. It used to be free, but now they're typically charging 700 gold per wing with the first one free, so 2800 gold for the last 4 wings.
---
The classic: we’re sorry for making you upset but not sorry for what we did
---
Oh shit really?!
---
Used to have FOMO and pre-ordered regularly.  Then I realised I wasn't even playing that much or even using most of the cards I pulled. Never hit or even near legend too.
---
Usually it’s 10:00am PST
---
I had a friend who always whined and moaned losing to decks that were p2w. He spent 50$ on card packs only to make a really trash cthun rogue &amp; new quest priest (the deck was wild but didn’t run many wild cards lmao) and he got even more pissy lol.
---
Money doesn’t buy you a brain or skill
---
it always felt like a good week or so before it felt like everyone was netdecking after an expansion launch. now there's going to be more than just theorycrafts posted everywhere tomorrow. kinda sucks, but what you gonna do.
---
My dude, save that gold for the expansion in 4 months time. It will be in standard for 2 years! This set only for 1 year and 4 months. Craft the great cards from this set with the dusts you have once the meta has settled.
---
Honestly, I played five total games of standard last month, only got 3 wins and didn't even care about missing the chest. Fuck evolve shaman and that garbage meta.
---
I'm really excited to get back to it, and I really hope that what develops is somewhat similar to the pre-evolve meta shift from this last expac.  Then I hope blizz can not fuck it up with another event. Don't get me wrong, I love them trying new things, but when it fails I need to see them shift gears and try other things, not just let it fucking die sitting it a puddle of it's own piss.
---
Honestly, I feel like I've said "this is the last chance for Blizz to get it right", and I keep finding myself back here.  I very nearly didn't pre-order anything and then ended up going with the smaller bundle, so who knows?  Now that BG is here, I could see myself walking away from standard if it's a dumpster, but I still like the standard playstyle (and I still fucking hate the ladder system)
---
Treants are hear????
---
What's the optimal amount of packs opened for a single expansion. I think I read somewhere that around 60. As the cards start to repet to much and chanses for legendaries are quite small.
---
He has only been out for a few days. Give the casual players a few weeks to pick up on the counter play and Rafaam will drop significantly in power. He'll still be top 5, but I am guessing Brann will remain the top hero.
---
Personally, I consider this interaction to be pretty important for deathrattle comps. Being able to spike out massive amounts of damage is one of the few things that makes the comp rewarding. If deathrattle comps were the strongest in the game, it would be oppressive. As is, the most they can usually hope for is to exploit RNG to eliminate a player or two before they get overwhelmed by murlocs.
---
My bad was looking at the list OP had, do you mind linking your list I'm going to try and run it when expansion comes
---
Edit: Also, you'll be going through most of your deck in most games so why not run zephrys?
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk is where you wanna post irony
---
Thank you so much!
---
While I like the idea of plat minions, 0/30 is a bit low imo
---
I'd like 3 levels of difficulty.
---
I appreciate that people just want to move through the content quickly and get their cards, so I understand why they make "normal" mode so easy .. but often, I've found heroic to be too binary/frustrating to be fun. So, it's left me with two modes that are both unsatisfying.
---
Spiferx #1305, i show, you first
---
I love you. I'm doing this day one!
---
Ftp is honestly one of the best ways to play hs. It's really fun to watch your collection grow and you craft better and better cards to boost your winrate that 1% more. I did my first 3 or 4 years ftp and it worked out really great, you just have to come to terms with not being able to have all the cards. I started at Black Rock mountain (maybe 5 or 6 years ago now? Idk) and now I have a pretty massive collection, this with only buying a few pre orders over the years. It's a grind, but overall a pretty fun one.
---
Correct.  If you own golden X, you can’t get X from packs (unless you own every legendary in the set, in which case you’ll get a random legendary that could be X).
---
To be fair you can compare it to holy wrath paladin because its the same concept, I think it'll be good, it has sufficient card draw and removal
---
No Squidward?
---
It wouldn’t be something extremely overpowered, just some basic secrets to help out survival. Like this one: Last Stand: 2 cost Warrior Secret, when your hero is below 10 health, equip a 3/2 Fiery War Axe and gain 5 armor. Also you can’t tell me that warrior spells are replayable as mage or priest. The only way to replay spells would be ArchMage Vargoth which would still be random if you’re attempting to apply buffs
---
I’ve created a fireside gathering, but nobody is able to open their packs. Did you open your packs today? Don’t know what I did wrong
---
Yeah this is false... There's no difference between golden and non-golden on the back end. You have just as much chance of getting any legendary golden at any point as long as you have all legendaries. They are not 2 individual cards it checks that you own, only that you own at least one of them
---
yeah idk it coulda been from higher tiers or something, golden tier 2s arent supr great in lategame
---
You do kind of need some high end for the murloc package though. If you could remove poison from its options, that could do it. But at the same time, that breaks the idea of cards being the same across formats and it's be pretty easy for some players to miss that change in patch notes. So I guess you'd have to replace it with something.
---
Well, since devs confirmed that the adventure will be an extension of the expansion, I think it is highly likely we get more dragons. We got some chunky boys already tho!
---
Their reasons for the lack of QoL stuff are always so dumb.

Social engineering of some sort I guess.

I checked only his priest section. He wrote some obvious stuff with no clear calls about how they will work.

---
Darius Crowley for warrior.
---
He is very strong, but I haven't really had a big problem against him in the lobbies I've played in. In the games I've played since he got released, he hasn't caused more grief than Bran or even Yogg so far. 
---
I've seen him completely take over a game once, other than that... Definitely one of the strongest heroes ... but also definitely not a "run for the hills, hide your women and children" kind of hero... just don't put your lightfang or bran to attack first... please? :P
---
Cause now you gotta press 1 more button?
---
I'm pretty close to my pity timer for Old Gods packs, so I'll be buying a few more of those.
---
Nope.
---
It feels way better when you're the guy with the Buff murlocs tho TBH.
---
Too soon 😢
---
&gt; As is, the most they can usually hope for is...to eliminate a player or two before they get overwhelmed by murlocs
---
Sounds like every non-Murloc strat right now

I played one Galakrond game at a fireside gathering (i was the only one there and faced a location duper), and I'm hyped more than anything for consistent Togwaggles.    Just filling my deck with him and generating shit tons of treasures.
---
Aww thanks Rhovan! I’m humbled... thank you. The whole team has really been pushing, so it’s not just me... can’t stress that enough. Appreciate you!
---
&gt; Soul Juggler
---
Just an FYI if anyone doesn't know, Soul Juggler is NOT deathrattle. He does flat damage on a death. Which sounds like a deathrattle, but Baron will not influence him at all. One demon death, one attack. In that sense, the bombs are more effective. Not only does gold become 2 bombs of 4 as opposed to 1 bomb of 6, but you can multiply based on Baron. That said, if you keep killing spawning and killing demons, you can keep Soul Juggling. But realistically, there's not as much space for that and in this one example I threw out 12 bombs in the first couple moves, which is pretty massive. 
---
I love Soul Jugglers too, but they don't scale as high, IMHO. I had another game with gold Soul Juggler, regular Soul Juggler, and multiple demons, including 2 Voidlords. that was a great build but still didn't put out the same destruction as this. The demons did most of the heavy lifting by directly killing. The soul juggling was just helpful.

Hey sketecookie, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

No, your golden legendary will not be a Galakrond card.
---
How is that possible. I’m usually around 7000 when an expansion hits and I spend it all and save up never missing a single quest until the next expansion and I usually never met more than 7k.
---
I think he's saying make the Murloc strategy high risk, high reward.

Naxx is out!!!

Pirate warrior. I like to be aggressive and I want to get some use out of my deathwing hero portrait.

This is fantastic!

I appreciate *so* much that this is in a written format, too. I strongly prefer reading to watching a video (I think because it let's me consume the information at my own pace, and it's also easier to reference later), so what I think is that this makes me very, very happy!
---
I Know the fact about Malganis but didnt blizzard regret his sideburns? I mean look at him in hots 
---
^^^^sexy
---
&gt; For example it's kinda surprising that chaining Alex-&gt;Alex-&gt;Alex is about 40 times likelier than hitting Alex-&gt;Alex x2.
---
Can you explain this for me? It does in fact seem counter-intuitive; I thought it was 2/45^2 (1 in ~500) versus 1/45^2 (1 in 2,025), or only ~4 times more likely. I feel like I'm missing something here.
---
Otherwise, for some reason I completely ignored the possibility of AlexDQ1 -&gt; AlexDQ2 &amp; one of Alex/Kalec/Maly and then AlexDQ2 -&gt; the other two of Alex/Kalec/Maly, but that certainly simplifies things a *bit*. 
---
Even if incredibly small, 1 in 750,000 odds is a *lot* better than I had imagined, probably because I (wrongly) assumed that you would need at least three Alexs for some reason. I suppose that still doesn't take into account then discovering a face spell though, which then bumps the odds back up to one in 10 million... *sigh*. 
---
Even if you were to somehow add in all the other possibilities or new!Maly, it definitely doesn't look like it would be the *most* reliable OTK... lol.
---
Regardless, thank you for putting in the work to brainstorm this; you're clearly more competent at statistics than I. It was a fun thought experiment though, and I still want to see it!
---
Warming up the dragons...
---
You can now buy old adventures directly in the in-game shop.  Previously you would have to buy them on Blizzard's website

Was running a murloc build and had a single replicating menace on an amalgam, won me first place

Nice.
---
It says “19h29m” from now.
---
What? Wild cards are already available for purchase in the new shop.
---
According to the WoW tcg the same card are it used for Malygos as Kalecgos the Spell Weaver
---
Tough battle? Just pick yourself back up and turn it around!
---
You got this, You're way ahead!
---
Maybe. But I don’t think so. We sat there exchanging emotes for a few minutes. The timer switched back to him. He kept emoting. Then he went quiet. All this after the screenshot. I guess he left.
---
Edit: there was no message when I logged in about losing the last game.
---
While i agree poison should be jn the game it should be a tech unit not able to something you can give to any so many units
---
I feel like the problem is not Murlocs, it’s Brann. Any battlecry doubled for the rest of the game while you keep him on board is just ridiculous value and not comparable to any other minion in the game. I just switched from a beast board to a murloc board at turn 8, quite far into the game. By the end of the game my murlocs on board had over 60 health, poision, divine shield and 4 other Megasaue buffs. That’s impossible to get with other comps even if you get it right from the start.
---
Removing Brann from Battlegrounds will really help a lot to balance the whole meta imho.
---
There is
---
Yeah right, i didnt even change the order in the last second and then it put it back
---
Well.... Not for me? But I checked this on my na f2p rank 31 account so maybe wild packs hasn't been unlocked yet, since wild is locked until rank 25
---
I feel dirty all over just typing this, pirate warrior
---
BTW if you think you had some pity timer going before those packs rotated, don't expect it to pick up where you left off. If there even is such a thing as a pity timer still.
---
The reward for quests has only ever been gold or packs.
---
Right, smartass, I'm proposing really fundamental cards should be Legendary. Are you having comprehension issues or what?

That’s probably it.

I have read a part of it and if he included that part (which sucks) in a supposedly review of the hole expansion, not parts of it, then its a bad review.
---
Of course only his quicky witty fanboys clicked on this post and checked the comments so that's why im getting downvoted for criticizing his bad review.
---
Lol doesn't even own naxx
---
If you track or record the games you should post it on the official forums (or anything that can show it happened other than "I say so", but you could post it over there either way)
---
Ha ha, this comment needs an award too.
---
Like he's not already in every one of my games.
---
Yeah on EU I have it, but it clearly says wild next to it
---
Pretty sure it’s just user error.
---
Agreed.
---
True, this could be a valid option! A lucky one if it was Toki
---
I don't think this is accurate. You're only guaranteed a Legendary within the first 10 packs if you've never bought a single pack from that set before. If you have an old account, and bought GVG or TGT packs before, then you aren't guaranteed a Legendary.
---
That's not to say it's impossible to buy 10 GVG/TGT packs and get a legendary. You could still open them by sheer chance. It's just not guaranteed.
---
Dragons.
---
Brilliant. Thank you for all of your efforts over the years, but particularly for taking the time to remind the community about the bootlicking.
---

---
Oh? Yeah, that is strange. Today is the first time it has worked for me.

it's not on the gathering page, it's in the unopened packs, no idea what's wrong

---
I know, it's rough. Should be out in early 2020 I think.

no, but you can open packs early, and it's not too much of a hassle to create one

Thank you for your service comrade you will be missed.

Is it maybe only for the weekend? I even waited til my gathering officially opened and I wasn’t able to open packs :/

Should we change Sneeds in Arena too? Legendary doesn't mean anything in Arena either.  There isn't even a count restriction.
---
It has an Orange gem on it.  It is Legendary.  That is all that Legendary has ever meant.  Yes it has a slightly different rule specifically in constructed for how many you are allowed to have, but that rule exists nowhere else.
---
Welcome to the endless cicle
---
It only worked on iPad.
---
I think it's more confusing not being clear . This way is much better and wild is a much better format too
---
I think PWeasil meant the deathrattle effect.

So yes the egg strikes you for 5, if it survives but the big bad mech that is spawned hits you just for 1.

Oh, that’s the thing then. I use an Ipad.

So, this means Tyrande is a dragon in disguise?
---
in the solo adventures i loved this guy, he really gave me a warm feeling deep in my soul. but in battlegrounds, i think he is wrong there. his "motivations" like "you are the best, i think you can win this think, don't tell the other but i cheer on you..." feels sarcastic, and in many turns where you have to make the decissions against the timer you can't pay attention to him. so yes, man of the year, but imo Blizzard should keep him away from Battlegrounds and let him stay exclusive for Solo Adventures.
---
That’s so wrong in many ways.
---
If you drop all  6k you have for packs and then grind 2800 for the adventure in 40 days this means that you’ll save only 4/4.5k gold for next expansion which is the most important of the year since is the rotation one (the one that last 2 years. DOD will last only 1 year and 3 months. So ad F2P is so bad to put so much gold in this One. Is way better to save for the next one.
