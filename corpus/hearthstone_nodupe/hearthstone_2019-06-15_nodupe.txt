the game consistently reaches 80 players! i wouldnt call that dead

It didn't die. It's not a bug.

Jesus watching hunterace vs justsaiyan makes me so mad.

Mana cyclone decides the matchup. Whoever gets more freezes/value is surely the better player /s

Retaining the buffs is part of the deathrattle. If that doesn't trigger then it will lose them

Ace#15336 80g quest trade
---
I show, you go first.
---
What a sad joke, but what I've come to expect out of the Hearthstone team.
---
I'm pretty done with the game, only playing to get my quests done so I can buy packs at the expansion drop.
---
Don't enjoy watching anymore, but they got me for 6 hours for packs.
---
It's probably just an example, but balancing the numbers are likely the least important part of a card's design, and also a rather pointless exercise given the cards on that sub aren't actually going to be played.
---
Heartstone ded gemmmm
---
You had me at Chakki. Will there be Snapple in the premises? If not I am out.
---
Yes
---
If I had coins I would give you a award.
---
Under "pluses" it lists having hit legend multiple times.
---
I think your interpretation of top level is a bit high.
---
I disenchanted all of my wild cards (been playing since the beginning), why was I so stupid
---
it fucked up my hunter quest by making my shimmerfly cost 0
---
How come vacancies at Blizzard never list a salary range? It's not always the most important part of a job, but it's pretty high up there.
---
Plus “variety is the spice of life”, as they say. After a while playing the same class will get dull. And besides, playing a meta midrange hunter right now only costs like 3000 dust, which is only three times as much as the average budget deck. So it’s relatively easy for a new player to make, say, a budget Mage like the one in the sub’s guide and then work toward making a midrange Hunter.
---
I had a [[fellfire potion]] draw that seemed to count as a win. Or at least it didn't end my run.

---
Ben Brode confirmed that the deck has a definite order, but always shuffle whenever a card is put into the deck.
---
I did. Not sure exactly when it hit though. Because I received one notification for three packs: two RoS, one Classic.
---
or does it have rush
---
Read Garfield's essays and explanations. He's 100% behind booster pack acquisition nonsense. And also does not place the blame at all on Artifact's monetization scheme as a reason for failure.
---
I've been waiting for this. Top quality, mate!
---
If it was that simple, Valve could have gone F2P and saved the game.
---
The issues are much deeper. Its hard to tell when you are playing well and the RNG feels very annoying.
---
The hero power does draw a card though. Refresh, from the solo adventure: Draw a card (overload: 1)
---
That makes sense. Thanks!
---
This x100 now when I play my meme 9 card OTK I might survive to pull out of every 10 games instead of every hundred
---
It’s probably spaghetti code then, honesty I’m not familiar with the single player mode and this situation.
---
The crappy performance is so that you can really spend the time appreciating the work put into the UI.
---
meatpudding#2509, NA 80g quest trade

It actually seems like a pretty decent call by the guy.  He realized what deck you were playing turns ago and chose the best of 3 cards offered to him.

The card is fairly interesting. Its tricky to know when to play it optimally.

What exactly is so hard to understand about what this guy has been telling you? Duels and Arena are being handled *completely* differently. Duels was always intended to be an MTG lite to get people into the real game, and Arena is very much not that.
---
She is getting that refund.
---
&gt;The fact is that the people who ALREADY PURCHASED THE GAME, who were willing to invest the money, have all stopped playing. Why?

Oh idk maybe it was because they realised they literally could not progress in any way without paying.

---

---
Yeah, 20$+ for one Axe was really cheap. /s
---
People like you apparently don't realise that the only reason the cards were cheap after a while is because the game tanked and people were selling out.
---
HS is, from Blizzard's perspective, probably very well monetized. Dedicated people can play the game for free, and everyone else buys packs. If the game was any easy to do F2P, then it wouldn't make any money.
---
You'd think that but the reality is that's been happening EVEN IN TBC! That should tell you how legitimate those claims are.
---
Are you at all familiar with the color pie in MtG?
---
If you are, you should know why giving every color or class access to the exact same sort of tools as each other is a terrible idea and the easiest way to make your game boring.
---
When thrown into a ramping Druid deck that cast a ton of spells anyway it was still very much a "I lost this game and don't deserve to win, so I'll just roll a die instead" -button. Randomness is one thing, but the absurd power ceiling was another.
---
huh

Ah the end of turn Doomsayer amalgamation
---
those guys are full of shit, acting like everyone switched their decks in those hours(?) those leaks happened. guys like zalae or purple predicted in those weeks preparing for this tour it would be mass warriors and counters to it. thats why they made decks with double emps and tripple silence. but no, those paranoid fucks are sure everyone peaked at those randoms decklists and teched accordingly...
---
You could also buy any card you wanted directly, without having to buy 50 lootboxes and hope for the card or enough dust. 
---
 
---
Such abuse man! /s 
---
Artifact business model is much more fair than HS, for people who regularly spend a bit of money. 
---
Only people it's not fair for, are F2P players.
---
I don't understand how hunter's class identity became mechs and deathrattles. It's fucking stupid.
---
Correct. Dog was originally going to bring otk paladin. His list is extremely greedy which is quite obviously targeted to warriors. The leak is a large part he is 7-0 currently
---
I mean against an deck that's not overstacked. It's not saltposting, I really do see overstacks way more often now with the latest expansion
---
Of course, I know the struggles all to well.  I've spent a few hundred on the game to even catch up on the current meta. Was it worth it? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. In my opinion the current meta is trash.
---
yea, I'm not saying everyone should do it too, but it's my personal principle. I just don't like the idea of a single card determining my win
---
^ ^ Im good at DCSS especially with octopodes, can I join?
---
Try watching paper magic, it's infuriating at tournaments because they don't show hands. Commentators say "Well, if he has a sweeper, this would be a bad play". I'm hoping they make mtga a nice client.
---
&gt;  It's also not like Warlock has or is in an absolutely trash position on ladder currently either.
---
Only because Zoo is like cockroaches and they mostly use neutral cards anyway. https://hsreplay.net/meta/#tab=archetypes
---
That’s fair, it just seems like you’re giving too much power to the idea of legendaries based on kinda false premises (but that’s just my take).
---
Until it overflows and kills itself
---
Thank you
---
GWENT
---
oh, is meta the word, not expansion? Yea in that sense I don't blame you, if you're looking to catch up with other stacked players. You're so right, this latest meta is trash. Especially for Rexxar (which I'm obviously a user of). With Rexxar in the past, I made it a point to not use any spells (I saw him as a beastmaster, I felt like that was more his true character, not some half-assed sorcerer lol). He was so fun with the Un-goro meta where you had to plan strategy around adapting beasts! I miss that so much. I guess I have to sit through this watered down Rexxar for 2 years.
---
There’s a difference between “reading comprehension “ and “correctly able to parse blizzards spaghetti code based on inconsistent wording” like there both skills, good for you, but “copy” does in fact mean that the spell is a copy...
---
In before someone gets this card and Sir Finley for Life tap on non-warloc

You're incredibly thick.

That doesn't follow at all. If the aboms went first, they just do nothing and then it moves on to the geddons. In fact, I'm fairly sure the first one would be on the left.

One of the things I’ve noticed about the mobile version is just how different every device seems to perform. On my old phone it’d lag out a lot, but almost never actually disconnect. After getting a new phone though it doesn’t lag, but disconnects once or twice every match.

Looking at friends’ phones it varies a lot there too, some will have both problems, some will only have 1 of them.

---
I can create a full legendary deck a I still lose every single game...

Unless you are in top 100 legend, you can play any class at any rank with a positive win rate in this meta.

You have a case with dominion and TT, but both of these are REALLY old.  
---
Nexus blitz is recent, yeah, but it was in testing, they never promised it was to stay.  
---
Clash is a failure, but as a kind of tournament mode, I don't even think it counts. Think about, that's just SR game with slightly different draft system. Way more competitive, yes, but gameplay wise it is the same thing.
---
I just want them to give us a free skin once in a while. Maiev and Lunara were great: new Standard year, new face!

Introducing a new paywalled hero every expansion, that just feels bad. And we don't even know if it drives sales.

Tess and Darius, Rogue and Warrior heroes for Monster Hunt, fit this pattern. However, Rikkar, an all-class Hero for Rumble Run is male, so, this leaves Warrior as the only class with all one-gender Heroes.
---
Kibler please
---
LOL
---
Does anyone know why it got remowed?
---
Neither of these two cards (Elektra or Vargoth) use the word "copy". Their text is consistent with their usage of spells.

Nah you probably pay a slave wage. Go fuck yourself

Why is it called Dad Legend?
---
Only know about Icefrog, who went to work for Valve last I heard.

We know.

(Inb4 wisodmball gave me extra mana, thats why i have 4 mana on turn 3)

Don't come here with that "600+ apm peak" shit. If you're actually a proper starcraft player, you damn well know that APM doesn't *really* matter. There is a difference from needless micro/spam, and useful macro APM.

Definitely not necessary but he’s a lot like Zilliax where if you have him you don’t mind sticking him in a lot of different decks, but it’s not worth crafting because usually it’s not a highlight card of the deck

'Enrage' led people, especially new ones, to think that the minion would keep the stats if returning to full life, which 'While Damaged' does not do.

asking4halp no it's not unfair when you both have treasures
---
hOw LOng
---
WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL?
---
3 mana draw 3 is still good
---
Being super technical, enrage isn’t an ability. It’s not a keyword that can be given to a card, it’s merely a reminder word of a longer phrase so it’s easier to explain as a mechanic. Landfall is the same way :)
---
They just told me they do not transfers packs and that it was clearly stated it was this way... I guess I won't get my pack.
---
Well its true. You dont even have to win half the games to reach rank 5.
---
Thanks.
---

---
So what's the problem? You have treasures/passives/OP shit and he has more mana. 
---
You really think it would be more fun for him to have a floating head clearing or freezing your board randomly? You want him to start with a 4/4 Woecleaver?
---
but buckets and tavern are extremely random and inconsistent tho
---
I know this is just a joke but Trump has definitely been the most consistent in card ratings put of most streamers.

It's not that there's no criticism to Artifact. The translation is shit, you are required to purchase a starter pack, they had 3 weeks without progression in game etc. But please stick to true criticism and don't invent things.  I only wanted to clear that misinformation.

Wrong but if you wanna say that, you can.
---
Lakkari Sacrifice, 5 stars!
---
I hope we’re talking about the same deck here, deathrattle not mech hunter, I’ve never Seen a deathrattle list that runs snip snap, that anti synergy is huge and Oblivitron is not only a core reason to play the deck but also a considerable win condition
---
The one thing I dont like is this "lets drop a big guy on board, if the opponent doesnt have the removal I win". In mage with the giants and conjurers calling, in rogue with Edwin and Pogos for example. Also in Druid in the form of boardfilling tokens. It feels unfun to me to constantly have to try and clear the board because I know that if I dont clear it just once I get fucked over entirely by another card that the opponent holds in their hand.

At least trump won’t go mad about this like toast did 😂

As well as that, didn’t like everyone sleep on corridor creeper, hence the ‘corridor sleeper’ meme?
---
If we're talking GM league, those have been constantly shifting throughout. There've been Mage-heavy, Hunter-heavy, Warrior-heavy, and Rogue-heavy weeks for GM, with a smattering of 'off-meta' prediction picks each week. And we still need to see how the RotM patch shakes things up as well.

---
She also said that
---
Pavel was right, but Trump has a relatively high success rate when it comes to rating cards. I think someone did the math a month ago or so and Trump beats out the other streamers who do it.
---
This is where I do the same exact thing but succeed.
---
Isn’t your strategy to run them out of resources? Instead of crushing them with a combo or big minions.
---
It does make me wonder why more pro players aren't applying for these jobs but I assume people like Trump are making 5-10x times the salary for that position and at the end of the day the job security is roughly the same. Once hearthstone ends both jobs end
---
A cursory look at Glassdoor salaries for Game Designer positions at Blizzard lists an average salary of $74,619 which is approximately $55k after tax according to [this website](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#CcGzlmYoNg).
---
I know Irvine, California is an expensive place to live, but I don't know how comfortable one could live on that salary.
---
What would u want as a portrait tho? 
---
I would love to hv rag or maybe lich king as a portrait for one of my classes
---
Also all the mage bosses look pretty cool (kalec, khadgar as he appears in the dalaran heist, toki from witchwood and and chronomancer inara from dungeon run)
---
Not everyone
---
Its not overpowered, its just not a bad deck. If your deck is bad, you will lose to good decks. I guess thats expected.
---
Why instead of thinking your deck is good and balanced and the opponents deck is OP, you think that actually the opponents deck is good and your deck is the one underpowered? Why is never your fault, its always the opponent the un-creative, un-skilled player that gets an un-deserved win?
---
Lmao, so using rafaam makes you a lazy player now?
---
How old are you?
---
Wouldn't expect too much on the intellectual part when talking about a Hunter player.
---
Can I be in the screenshot?
---
I don't know, can you?
---
Can you just figure out how to put the cards that are generated by the card into the slideshow? 
---
Every single time this happens. Every time!
---
This time it's the ver first card "transform your treats into carousel animals." 
---
Sounds interesting, what's a carousel animal? 
---
"lol idk a card i guess??""
---
So I got to click the link yada yada defeats the whole purpose of having one album to view the damn things.
---
But RoS predicts were accurate, and he was sick when he did them...
---
Lets all remember the defile rating too lol
---
His is needlessly convoluted.
---
Last month I took a Shadowform/Mind Blast Priest from Rank 5 to Legend. That doesn’t mean it’s part of a new meta. Any competent player can take “anything” to Legend, if they care enough to.
---
It had to be merged because it was too good
---
because the OP deck requires much less thinking, and is all about waiting for the card to draw and simply dropping it on the board. It requires less anticipation of your opponent's moves. 
---
Legendaries give a much a greater advantage than other cards. So it follows that including a bunch of legendaries means your deck has an inordinate amount of advantages. It's not rocket science
---
Are we in China yet
---
I agree with you.
---
There's just too much BS removal from warriors. I change my strategy but it doesn't seem to matter. 
---
"Dude just bait their brawl and warpath." Doesn't seem to work when they just devastate everything down after that. 
---
Really enjoy the game but they are ruining it for me.

---
Not even close. This makes opponent spells cost 5. That means potential cost reduction. Also the fact it costs 2 cards makes it hugely worse. It isn't even comparable.
---
I want Pavel streams back where he slams his desk and goes "BOOM SMASH HIS FACE GUYS" ;(
---
It's really coinflippy.  If you find the combo before the opponent finds their boardwipes, you win.  If you don't you lose.
---
Loll this man rated primordial glyph 1 star, never watched another vid of his since..

No, it's just as bad as people think. Actually, if I take this thread as any kind of indication of what people think it is a whole lot worse than what people think.

i would play it occasionally to experiment with deck ideas before crafting cards.
---
I prefer just having all of them at once as it is now instead of being split in 2 expansions
---
Yeah that works too, depends on the deck
---
i'd remove multi-shot for any other card that hunters are allowed to play
---
I explained in the past why. Most people play the decks wrong or only give it a couple tries, fail and never touch it again. APM priest was a good and viable deck as well, but the skill ceiling was too high for some players and it took a lot of failing in order to get it right. Don't let winrates mislead you! Sure, it's not tier 1, but you can get to 60% with it for sure
---
Yeah, but in this particular case I don't think it would have solved the problem.
---
That might be a better way for me to phrase it than "heavy hitters".
---

Sounds like you're just arbitrarily choosing to blow smoke up Trump's ass while choosing to paint everyone else with broad strokes without giving much consideration to how their systems might work. Trump is just pulling vague uninformative words out of his ass instead of numbers and you're just gobbling it up.

Trump is genuinely bad at this game. He’s just a comedy streamer.

People didn't realize that the effect counted towards both you and your opponent's minions.

What makes that card good? I don't play that game but it sounds weak af

Agreed. Useful, but not broken cards. It wouldn't be any fun if they were terrible though, right?
