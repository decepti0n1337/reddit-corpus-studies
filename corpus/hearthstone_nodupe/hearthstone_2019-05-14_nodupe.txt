I would disagree here. The Shadowverse team checks in on the meta every month or so, giving some statistics about play-rates and class dominance. If they see an issue, they tend to adjust it. If they don't (even if the players do) the don't adjust, but explain why. Its possible to maintain that level of communication, even if it is a "hey guys, numbers seem to say high-level play is balanced, so no changes this month".

Apparently, the idea is, they're magnetic. In slow matchups, save the 1-drops to make something big. In fast matchups, use the mechs to not die.

There's actual money on the line?  Seems weird for a just-for-fun event.

---
I won't be watching because I don't want spoilers, but I'm curious if anyone will beat Kripp/Trump, they seem to have the most deckbuilding and Arena knowledge which should come in handy.
---
especially the name " resurrection of resurrection"
---
I still haven't even beat him with mage.
---

Happened the same to me, started around mid witchwood and even with rogue being my fav class (loved miracle with striders) it feels boring to play (god I hate facing warriors), I don’t have fun with this low level of power so I also moved to wild, yeah, you might see a lot of the same decks and stuff but at least there is variety and lots of viable decks (also is more dust friendly)
---
I think that's fair.  Combo decks often use a control shell to last until they get off their combo, otherwise they use cycle.  Nomi Priest right now obviously uses cycle; this is because the Classic Priest card Northshire Cleric (and the neutral Classic cards Gadgetzan Auctioneer, Acolyte of Pain, and Wild Pyromancer in conjunction with Cleric/Acolyte) aids in cycle, plus Nomi requires cycle to get to its payoff.  But traditionally Team 5 goes with a control shell for Priest over the expansions.  Mind Blast, Resurrect Priest, and Wall Priest from last expansion utilized the same control shell: Psychic Scream, Spirit Lash, and Mass Hysteria.  They also all utilized resurrect mechanics, which can definitely be thought of as an across-game combo in the same way Shudderwock is, especially since you tend to win "all at once," which is often a hallmark of combo.  There's also the issue now that Priest, like Shaman, can never win a control battle against Warrior as long as Dr. Boom is in rotation.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I would just be surprised if over the next two expansions Blizzard didn't print the equivalent of a Spirit Lash and/or Psychic Scream, since strong control cards for Priest are business as usual for them and strong control cards are what is missing now compared to most times when Priest is strong.
---
For paladin you could also replace young dragonhawk with the immortal prelate. I defeated lich king with it + with the double spell that gives lifesteal and it made lich king easy. Fill deck with minion draws/buffs (that costs higher than the guy you want to buff) and spell draws/buffs. Kinda worth noting:  if he kill's your immortal prelate you mess his draws since he's going to gain those immortal prelate's based on how many times that immortal prelate has died. so if your immortal prelate has died once, he gets 1x of 1/3's, if it has died twice, there's going to be 2x 1/3's spawning to his side 3x and he gets 3x and so on and on. here is my deck, only epic ones are the immortal prelate and 1x faceless manipulator. feel free to change to better.

leeroy is still better because it does 8 damage for 7 mana versus krush's 9. You should swap it with leeroy if you have it tbh
---
Just get lucky lol.
---
So you just like to play with some extremely favorable deck.
---
This meta is way better than Odd/Even, where you already lost in the matchmaking. Even if u got a perfect draw and played perfectly every single card, you get destroyed by an even warlock or Odd paladin.
---
Hunter is Hunter, that's how it works, or you expect him to clean boards and heal?
---
Control Warrior is kinda balanced, maybe the 4/3 weapon wich adds 2 bombs is too op, but the rest is very balanced, not every time you get a good hand and if the opponent gets ahead on the board you are done.
---
Everything except for the mage and hunter is consistent. For mage and hunter, you could also do it without molten giant if you want to have less risk, but of course it'll be slower.

---
You know there’s a turn limit right? Your game was probably headed to a draw regardless. Next time just play your turns quicker if you’re already deep into the match
---
I knew it capped. Maybe an interesting option would be that once you have one of each hero power totem on the board, your next hero power gives one of them at random a +1 to attack or defence.
---
Same thing, but with 2 legendaries and 1 gold happened to me before. Needless to say, since then all my card packs have been crappy. I kind of feel my luck creeping back though.

Yeah, idk why people always think it's the best play to race when a token druid has a full board.  Sure, you have full life, but the druids entire game plan is to just stick a board and capitalize on it....  It baffles me...  At the least knock out a few of his minions, and set up for lethal the next turn...
---
Mech hunter doesn’t count

Didn't say much Hunter. Also did you just gatekeep Hunter in hearthstone? You are a sad little man.

Haha, Regis here, it's cool if you don't like me, I think that's unavoidable sometimes, but to suggest I lack "information" is pure heresy, sir, and I shan't stand for it! You may disagree with my points, you may find me annoying, but I'm one of the few people actually making dedicated videos loaded with newly sourced information and ideas, not just clips of gameplay. I do my own custom cards themes, I do my own budget decks, I do my own meta discussion pieces. It's all dedicated and made with intention, not just leftover clip content.

I actually kinda don't like it because I'm sitting there like How in the fuck do I play around "Deal X damage to everything. X equals how many turns this card has been in your hand." Like, Shaman needed a card to the effect of Hagatha's Scheme, but I wish it wasn't so random.

The animation would've just been a line of bombs going off probably, as opposed to the current animation. It does work, just would be a bit ridiculous

---
Hey if you can get up to 1600 dust (seems large, but with enough disenchanting you can get enough) you can craft the whizabang card. It gives you a random deck (the decks are the non classic decks in the deck creator) each match. Very good for a new player, as you can learn the game more easily through all those decks. 
---
Other than that, I also reccomend the trump YouTube channel, he plays hearthstone and explains why he does what he does. It's very informative! Plus he has a short series called trump teachings, teaching new players how to play

Rank floor 5 is quite nice for the same reason.  I naturally lift to around 3 and down to 5 but 5 floor is the best fun.  You can even play Whizbang! :)
---
That is probably the best way to go about this game. Legend means nothing once you got it once and before you become top 200 material.
---
Sick synegy with Auchenai for more healing!
---
Yeah plus top 200 tends to mean you're either sponsored or have spent a shit ton of money to get a large variety of cards decks.

Yeah, I think a 10 mana nerf on its own would be fine. The only cards I can think of that would still be able to consistently bounce are Rogue with [[Shadowstep]] and Druid with [[Dreampetal Florist]]. I don't think either classes would benefit from Elysiana though.

Adwcta and Merps were not a a fan of that card. If you don't have early game you're gonna be stuck with shovelfists in your hand and your life counter rapidly nearing 0. I'd say 4 it too many.
---
Sorry to hear, mate! :/
---
I know shitting on GoT is like the hot thing to do right now but that's just simply not true. Arcs and character changes can move quickly and the quickness can feel logical or understandable, it's up to everything else to make sure that it lands. Look at Breaking Bad as an example. Characters do complete 180s on a dime because of very human fits of irrationality, and while it may be frustrating to watch, the audience understands where these decisions come from. If you wanted really long character studies like The Killing that's fine, but at least for me personally Daenerys snapping and razing King's Landing made sense. She's been growing gradually more cunning and vicious since Astapor, feels like her inner circle is turning on her, and had her right hand woman be executed in front of her by probably the cruelest woman in Westeros.
---
How long can this go on
---
MoRaLlY GrAy
---
Face Collector
---
ok
---
She doesn't want the peasants in King's Landing to be afraid. To most other places in Westeros the news that a dragon attacked the walls of King's Landing and the Queen surrendered would be alarming, but not much more so than anything else since Dany has gotten there. 
---
I agree the show hasn't done enough to really justify it all, but the razing of the capital and largest city definitely sends a much different message than the above scenario. Nobody in the Seven Kingdoms defy me or face my wrath. Again, a sentiment that has been consistently demonstrated by her time and time again. It was just something that was more palatable when those people she was doing it to were slaveholders.
---

---
Plainly wrong. Tyrion made it sound like this was the rule toward the beginning of the episode, but it didn’t go that way. She insisted her army would fight to the last man. They threw down their swords when facing off with Jon and the cry came from the people, not from Cersei. She did not ever surrender.
---
🎺 🎺 🎺🎺🎷🎷🎷🎷
---
What's the reason behind that? Can you just not craft legends at low rank or is it specific to whizbang.
---
It really was *masterfully* directed and acted...which makes it all the worse that the director and actors were being forced to salvage such goddamn terrible writing.
---
Priest got really good cards, but in a Rogue Meta, Priest will always suck.
---
Control Priest could easily out value Control Warrior and Wall Priest could be a strong deck, if Rogues wouldn't be that dominant.
---
It's the same for Nomi Priest. Rogues are the main reason, why Priest hasn't a real chance to shine.

The writing has been indefensibly bad and season 8 has brought D&amp;D to a point where they make characters do whatever they need to in order to quickly end the story.
---
I've been checked out since season 5, so nothing has surprised me. I'm not a book reader, but it's been obvious the show took a nosedive once they ran out of material. Lately it has reached Last Jedi tier writing, but no matter how bad things get, people will still rush to defend it.

I'm like 7/10 against control warrior with control secret hunter
---
Mecha'thun that gives you lethal - Created by Omega Assembly

---
Pyroblast #2 - Created by Mana Cyclone
---
Or a flame throw from Flame Juggler.
---
\&gt; Decks that have more greed and value are bad Value decks and Value decks are always weak to Aggro.
---
Control decks inherently greedier than non-control decks, this has nothing to do with value.
---
\&gt; Control is designed to beat aggro and stomp them in late-game, they have lots of Control cards. Even if Warrior missed FWA Muligan in old days, they had Armorsmit, Cruel Taskmaster, Slam, Shieldslam, Whirlwind, Cleave and Brawl to clear it up, those are just basic/classic Warrior cards.
---
Control is designed to beat everything, not just one arche-type - it is designed to win by controlling the game until a late game win condition can come out, as opposed to aggro games that aim to close the game as quickly as possible, and mid-range decks that usually aim to dominate the board and close the game before the late game win-cons come out.
---
All of the warrior cards you mentioned are still available, but only FWA and Armorsmith were reliable early drops and if you missed one of those two you faced the risk of getting swarmed by face hunter, zoo lock, etc and run into a board you cannot recover from. It was an inherent drawback to playing all of those late game cards, like Alexstrasza, Grommash, Ragnaros, Sylvanas, Geddon, etc.
---
New control warrior doesn't need all of those expensive cards, as Dr. Boom single handedly out-values everything else in the game, making it highly favoured vs other control decks, so it can early run more early game cards instead, such as Rover and Crier, two very strong one drops, making them extremely effective vs aggro as well.
---
\&gt;  Priest wasn't a good control deck until Goblin vs Gnomes and Meanstreet of Gadgetzan, both introduced powerful board-clears Lightbomb and Dragon Potion. Outside of that Priest was pretty much worst class for most of its time during the older expansions. So it's not a good bench-mark for Control is good at. 
---
I never said Priest was particularly good, though it had its niches, I just brought it up as an example of a control deck that did better vs mid-range than vs aggro. Same with control paladin, and to a lesser extent handlock. These decks were more susceptible to bricking, hence could randomly get destroyed by aggro - control was never HIGHLY favoured vs aggro in the older days of Hearthstone.
---
\&gt;  Warrior had something like this before years ago, it's called "Justicar Trueheart". You had to kill the Warrior before they upgrade their hero-power. It's same with Dr.Boom now, So that makes basically Dr.Boom Mad Genius a reprint of the old Justicar Trueheart. I don't think it's terrible, they just bringing back an old type of Control Warrior. 
---
lol wtf you can't be serious. Justicar Trueheart was NOWHERE near how strong Dr Boom is. She was an extremely unsafe T6 drop as she only had a 3 HP whereas Dr. Boom's 7 armor makes him extremely safe. And Justicar Trueheart was never an auto-win on the same level as Dr. Boom is. Did you actually even play the game back then? It was still fairly likely that you could beat a warrior with an upgraded hero power, once Dr. Boom drops it's pretty much GG - you either win before it comes down or pray that he is never drawn.

If you follow my directions under the first image, you should get the same as me. If not, I must have made a mistake at some point in the translation

Honestly, no one really wins in a 30 minute game against warrior....

Deathwing.

Gotta beat them by turn 7. Other control decks won’t win. Most of the top decks are aggressive for a reason.

I figured, one obviously there's some plot armor, but two Rhaegal was ambushed. He got shot up before he knew what was happening and could dodge.

---
&gt;  for discussion about this season, I'll have to check that out
---
Well when you start to see things like "completely ruined the show", "abyssmal writing", "ruined characters arc" in the main subreddit, the circlejerk one has to admit defeat and repurpose. Like /r/hearthstonecirclejerk frequently admitting defeat against this very sub :D
---
So since the "D&amp;D are literally Hitler" joke has reached the main sub, the jerk one became naturally the official fan subreddit. It's a good place now. You can criticize the show while liking it.
---
my point was that for OP, who's playing on a budget, the 8/8 charge will often be a preferable card to have due to the fact that he will need that body more often than a more refined list would have need for a body

---
Tbh, what I’m thinking of doing is, adding it as an extra combo into my(kinda) modified version of the Archmages of Dalaran deck recipe
---
Added you to trade!
---
Priest fell short because of the failure of it’s heavily supported Silence archetype this expansion. Had it been a consistent and solid archetype, Priest would be in a much better place. On the flip side, Resurrect Priest has stuck around in Standard with the introduction of multiple solid tools, including [[Catrina Muerte]], [[Mass Resurrection]], and [[Archmage Vargoth]]. It’s not the top tier meta version we saw near the end of Rastakhan’s Rumble, but it certainly is a deck to revisit and further solidify throughout the year.
---
The biggest hit to Priest however was the rotation itself. The Year of the Mammoth sets HEAVILY supported Priest throughout the Year of the Raven, and you can clearly tell that the Year of the Raven sets for the most part just supported the existing archetypes of Priest rather than build up new ones. Priest is at a point where they need new versions of solid tools they lost, but more importantly they need support for not yet dominant archetypes. Duplicate/Copy Priest and Talanji/Loa Board Swing Priest were both archetypes tried and not successfully pushed to a point that they could seriously compete. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Talanji/Loa Board Swing archetype becomes a meta tier deck with the introduction of a couple solid tools and an undercosted card that pulls a couple 1 costs from the deck and puts them into play. (For example a 4 mana Epic spell that reads “Summon 3 (1) cost minions from your deck.”
---
He broke legend with token druid, which destroys hunters.
---
It has a lot to do with the matchups

First recorded event of a navy ambushing aircraft. This is history being written.
---
With the new singleplayer content having complete coverage of "completion" checkmarks, can we hope to see the shrines from rumble run also getting that retroactively?
---
&gt; Actually if you see tournament players in 3-5 games how good and pro they are, even if you did not have seen any game from them before.
---
If you see a player in a tourney, they qualified for it somehow. Either through HCT points, which are achieved by grinding legend ladder monthly, or playing in some sort of a play in system where they've already beaten many other people to qualify.
---
&gt;Current pro players finish high legend because they are top tier level and take the time to grind for it, because the ladder system demands it.
---
Because the system is a combination of grinding and skill. LC said the system is completely quantity based and skill doesn't matter, that is objectively incorrect. If you take a garbage legend player and a top 50 player, there will be a skill difference and the top 50 will win most of the time, pending decks. Maybe what he means is at the top level of the game where skill differential is small, quantity matters, in which case I would agree, but that's not what he said. 
---
Also I don't understand why people have a problem with that system. If you have two players of equal skill, one of which who doesn't grind the ladder and one who does, why should they be equally rewarded? One is obviously putting in more work and is more dedicated to the game and since that is effectively the only difference between these two players, why would you pick the one that doesn't show any dedication?
---
&gt; If we would have a ladder system that would treat quality &gt; quantity the results were the same, yes, but the grind would not be necessary.
---
How do you do this on the massive scale Hearthstone operates at? What defines a quality game? How do you objectively judge that? You're going to get 60 different answers to that question from the 50 people you asked. What you're asking for is great in theory but is impossible to implement.
---
Just good hearthstone foundamentals
---
This is the game we play. 
---
Go back through HS history and most all the memorable competitive moments, Trolden highlights, etc were due to random shenanigans happening.
---
Maybe, but he was bitchin' more about RNG than the ladder system (that I think is awful btw), he bitched a lot about blizzard nerfing combo and supporting tempo piles of stats strats. Nothing he predicted about the game actually happened. I hope he comes back tbh, he is a really intresting smart player but he leaving was more about moving to the new thing to be king there than the game being awful (the game was and is awful don't get me wrong the person who designed Raiding party should [insert something horrible here]).
---
Only Krip can pull off a smile with his lips still arching downwards...
---
Yeah it’s really not. Rogue could probably use some adjustment since I do think it’s warping the meta a bit but it feels like every class has a viable ladder deck. Even priest, now!
---
&gt; That being said, it's really unusual to expect players to play any one game, every day, for 5+ more years. It's not the norm and we should not be surprised when people burn out or feel like they've "seen it all" from HS. Even casual players who play 10% of what pro players do suffer the same fate.
---
Well, we have seen what adding 1 card to the game has shaken the meta, for example [[Archmage Vargoth]] and we know that after every nerf patch the meta shakens. **Blizzard could do a lot to keep things fresh** and a healthy ladder system would also support this.
---
In 18 months time he will be wondering why he never gets a single interview when he applies for jobs.
---
For aggressive matchups, you can use Plot Twists and Elekks without the full combo as you don't need help in fatigue.
---
I'm also testing [[Portal Keeper]] atm which has nice synergy with Elekk (and Plot Twist to pull many demons at once) and helps against faster decks.
---
They have deadly arsenal tho.

Why is the source being downvoted?
---
&gt;Then it becomes an arms race of people playing more and more games and that's horrible for the game.
---
You say this but you don't say why. Why is people playing more games a bad thing? More games is more data to separate out the small skill differences between players.
---
What you just described in your last paragraph is exactly how I think it should work. Yeah the top 300 people are close in skill, effectively the same, so why should the ones who play less games and are therefore less dedicated to the game be rewarded over those who play more games?

What a lot of crap. She hadn't voluntarily killed a single innocent up until this episode. She was in this shitty situation precisely because she listen too much to Tyrion and Varys. Not to mention how they started plotting against her the moment an alternative appeared, when she didn't even do anything wrong yet (worst, she just put her lifelong dream on hold to go North and save everyone). Vary was more patient with Jeoffrey lmao. And that's because they thought Jon would make a good ruler ? The guy is too soft, every single time he has been in a position of power, people ended up walking all over him. And while yes, Dany is hot tempered, she has proven time and time again that she responded well to logic and well laid out arguments. 
---
If this is what they were going to end her arc with, they should have planned for it a lot earlier, and actually show us some snapping in the earlier seasons. Instead they did the exact opposite, and now her entire storyline can be resumed to "it was in her genes all along DUH". Total bore, worst arc in the entire show. They better not end this with Jon or Arya killing her, because I'd like to see them at least *try* to surprise us again. The entirety of S8 has been extremely predictable so far.

Sap is a social construct

&gt; My opinion, and apparently most people's opinions looking at reviews of this season, is that the turn from tough but fair ruler to insane super villain is ridiculously fast.
---
That's exactly it. People keep taking example of her ruthlessness as proof she was going mad. But there is a huge difference between ruthlessness and madness, one that D&amp;D clearly does not understand.
---
Awesome job!
---
A handful of pros/streamer have quit HS but Lifecoach's does seem strange in retrospect. 
---
Savjz, Sjow, Hafu have transitioned into Magic/Autochess pretty seamlessly. It was weird seeing him stream prismata to like 40 people. I get that hes set for life and doesn't need to play anything he doesn't want to, but his exit was definitely standoffish (told Team 5 to definitely not print the hunter quest when testing it).
---
I have some 250euro phone and the game works really well
---
Yep, carefully fit it on your head until they ears pop in place.
---
&gt;The Coin no longer counts as a spell.
---
&gt;There is absolutely no good reason to do this.
---
Back when mage quest was a thing i always thought it was unfair  to have the coin as a free spell to advance the quest and now with mana cyclone i feel something similar
---
Just won a game with 2 fireballs to face through a board of taunts and dragons.
---
Ahh ok. I totally forgot the about the ears until after I saw this picture.
---
The problem is if they keep on creating a new version of the same tool, it drastically harms Wild’s balance. Priests already have [[Lightbomb]], [[Excavated Evil]], [[Dragonfire Potion]], [[Mass Hysteria]], and [[Psychic Scream]]. We’ll more than likely get yet another one, and I leads Priest down a path in Wild where the can play the eternal Resurrect package and 15 board clears that scale each turn (Mass Hysteria/Excavated to Dragonfire/Lightbomb to Psychic Scream and so on).
---
There’s many ideas and suggestions to a fix for this, but the overall agreement is that one of these tools needs to replace Holy Nova (or another card and be alongside Holy Nova) so that the team isn’t forced to print another clear every year. There are also other ideas to strengthen the core set for Priest so that it can support itself year to year rather than rely on its set support (such as adding Entomb to the basic set, which I’m personally against)
---
If I had to pick two cards to add to Priest’s identity right now I would choose [[Kabal Talonpriest]] to replace Mind Visions in the basic set and [[Spirit Lash]] to replace Lightwell in the Classic set. Of course they’d have to rework or make entirely new (but the same) versions of them, since “Kabal” themes Talonpriest around its set, and Spirit Lash would most likely have to be reworded since they do not like using retired keywords across years, but I believe that these cards are not too oppressive yet solid enough to consistently pop up in lists year to year. Talonpriest is a solid 3 drop with a strong upside if you have the minion on board from T2 (or combo’ed later in the game with another minion) and Spirit Lash is a non-oppressive soft board clear that would keep Aggro/Token decks in check and creates unique synergies with spell damage cards (which could potentially lead to the creation of new archetypes)

Well he quit because of RNG, although I'm sure the factors you outlined played a part. 
---
And as it turned out ungoro expansion was quite a good one, although it was probably one of the least generous ones(no free Legendary Quest, unlike the others where you got a free death knight, etc etc).
---
But it was RNG that he hated and left to play Gwent...then quit Gwent when that game introduced their own discover effect, and so even that was too RNG for him.
---
Oh, it was a gnome's leg hanging out its mouth?
---
Guess it isn't that huge after all then.^/s
---
You must play a lot... I have the same win rate and feel like I can play all I want. And buy 40 packs each expansion
---
Faced like 40% rogues, 20% warriors, 10% hunters
---
Which isn't a good reason to change the game like that. The interactions make sense and aren't gamebreaking, or even amazingly strong.
---
There are several ways he can clear your Edwin here...
---
Unleash the Beast into the 3/3 and either deadly shot or a weapon breaker takes care of the board and leaves a 5/2 behind.
---
You play Nomi, he counters with Zuljin wiping most of your board and leaving behind just enough for lethal?
---
Fin.
---
Someone posted that they got to legend with only Commons and rares, so that's a bad excuse.
---
Well, It´s still just a frog... Have you seen in your life a frog that big? :-D
---
I agree. When control has limited removals/clears you could play around them because they were few. Those sorts of control decks still had to fight proactively for board with minions. It’s when *multiple, different* tools are introduced that things get out of hand. To play around everything is to play nothing at all. In short, control itself isn’t the issue... but it *can* be with enough cards, which is what we’re seeing now.
---
No, artifact failed harder than anyone could imagine.
---
Same, reached legend whilst only playing on my phone. It can be a bit iffy when you have a bad connection though.
---
There are a lot of good reasons the coin shouldnt count as a spell. It wouldnt count for combo and make a rogue going second have the big turn 2 swing of miscreant. It wouldnt pop counterspell, combo effects.

Larcklorn#1323 Looking to complete watch a game play quest
---
Most decks have some way to kill or buff their own minions though
---
That would make sense if she didn’t kill literally everyone on both sides. Aren’t Targaryens supposed to have a history of madness? Something like similar to schizophrenia.
---
Miscreant stays alive too long, changing the stats would change tempo. If miscreant gets a coldblood its a 5/5 on turn 3 or 4.
---
&gt; But yeah if you want to finish high legend you have to grind, just like any other competitive game.
---
does not match with that:
---
&gt; No one can know how good you are when you play ten games.
---
explain
---
Right now if it says it's trying to reconnect I know I have to close the client and start it again or it won't work.

Throw a copy of blessed champion in there.
---
I wish I had the power to practice the peace and love that I try so hard to live in my daily life while playing this game.  But nothing gets to me quite as much as someone consistently roping, even after all possible moves have been made.  Solid mental tactic I suppose since I’m venting here, but good Lord it’s the fucking worst.
---
Ysera. Kel needs some other minions on board and the old good is truly good if your deck has other big guys
---
&gt; Changing miscreants stats won't really change that much, right? He already has bad stats, he's just run for the effect.
---
Of course that matters. If Miscreant was a 3 mana spell that read: 
---
&gt; Combo: add two random Lackeys to your hand
---
it would be absolute trash
---
Watch his ungoro review. He dismisses every card because hunter is going to be broken!
---
Is this some sort of look i got legend post?
---
Ive played mobile since Karazan I have never even had this problem.

Hearthstone has created some really cool stuff and we love any call back to them.  I think the Live Events team has been doing an awesome job of re-surfacing Hearthstone's older content and putting a twist on them to make them feel fresh.  There's a Tavern Brawl that they're working on right now that I'm really excited about and it involves re-using some past PvE content - much like last week's brawl fusing old and upcoming content.
---
I'm not too sure how I feel about just straight up using the older adventures as is.  Unsure how fun it actually is to revisit over and over.  Is it something that becomes a chore?  I'll think more about it but my first instinct is that there are probably better ways to create re-engaging content.  Quests are sorta in this space but probably not as meaty as your idea.
---
ugly text
---
Is it possible to win a game after a disconnect? For example, you have Rag down and your opponent has 8 HP without Iceblock or anything like that and zero minions but you disconnect before you can end your turn. Do you auto-lose from the disconnect or does the end of the turn play out like it would if you weren't disconnected?
---
I don't understand.. (only started playing since boomsday)
---
1. Hitting Wagglepick would probable be more effective
---
2. I can agree with that
---
3. Overkills the card entirely
---
4. Hyena has never needed to be touched and now is no exception.
---
5. Master's Call already requires Hunters that play it make a couple pretty big sacrifices like cutting Crystalizer and Houndmaster. The card is fine
---
6. That makes the card's only use the Mountain Giant combo. Printing twelve mana minions with poor stats would "fix" the card more effectively while retaining the card's original intent: using it on Astromancer or Jan'alai.
---
7. Token Druid has proven to be mostly a fair deck with near even match-ups against most things worth noting, and a change to Blessing of the Ancients over say Soul of the Forest, the Forest's Aid, or Wispering Woods wouldn't be the most effective way of curbing the power of the deck.
---
8. I'd hardly call Murloc Shaman good enough at this point to warrant any changes. It's a good aggressive deck, but it's not format warping
---
9. What exactly would it be and what deck right now is taking advantage of how it's a spell? I don't see any Violet Teacher decks floating around right now. I know Spell Mage exists, but that deck is somewhere between nascent and not very good as is, and not worth addressing as a result.
---
Reading his reasons, I don't think anything has changed. You still have to grind to actually play the game against other people who arent also grinding. Playing innovative or unique decks gets you punished. In reflection, I can't think of the last time I walked away from playing on the ladder feeling good rather then just angry. So yeah, he's still got a solid point.
---
Not counting as a spell =/= not counting as a card. It would still function identically with combo. Apart from that, it's not like going second is overpowered because the coin can activate combo: in general it's still significantly better to go first in any game except a rogue mirror. If anything, the coin should be buffed to counteract that discrepancy.
---
You really just testing how long it takes to get banned from as many subs as possible? You admitted as much yesterday with other subs already. Now you spam all the Blizzard related subs with stuff that's been discussed a thousand times or act like the poor innocent newbie and crap like that?

---
Nothing else to discuss here anyway since its all just shitty memes and attention whoring so let's put out some real talk. I'm curious.
---
Unpopular opinion but warrior isnt bad, you're all just playing rogue like the other 80% of the playerbase and that has a bad matchup against warrior, go play mech hunter.
---
Do you also lose?
---

I'm pretty sure they outsource all or most of their customer support. When having problems with WoW, I've always had to reopen closed tickets to finally get a GM/CS personnel who knew what they were talking about. Not sure what the customer service for Hearthstone is like, though.
---
Then you should draw it
---
Nice catch, not sure what the symbol means. Just a symbol for Rafaam?
---
bad bot
---
Card generation and Discover effects are usually at least around equivalent to drawing a card. Drawing a card is most often better than generation, but every deck doesn't mind adding cards to their hand. Card advantage is good, and decks that aren't aggressive or combo oriented tend to win out through creating more advantage over their opponent.

---
Thanks! It´s probably League of Explorers. So It will be probably about temples and more about Rafaam´s home I think.
---
He said 2 turns later he died, so I was thinking first this combo, then Zuljin.
---
If you're allergic to fun, yeah.
---
It's simple
---
I’ve been using a control warlock deck with a different idea recently, yours focuses on the fatigue whereas mine gets to late game then forces overwhelming board states. It essentially runs all the control tools you can shove in, and runs Barista Lynchen and Omega agent. On turn 10+ with both you can summon 4 4/5’s and put another 3 omega agents into your hand. Summoning 12/15 worth of stats for 5 mana every turn simply runs down other decks, Shaman doesn’t clear enough and eventually warrior runs out of clearing power, although against him Jaraxxus is a big part of that.
---
It was partly the prevalence of combo, but also the fact that Dr. Boom was just vastly inferior to things like Jaina, Gul'Dan, Rexxar and others.
---
I have worse everything and get no problems. Bad luck I guess.
---
No but you are literally trolling or saying something so obvious it doesn't hold merit to the discussion.
---
Clearly it isn't a solution to OP's question.

EU 80g trade and positive vibes taxidermista#2390
---
Really?! He thought the Hunter Quest was broke? Out of, oh I don't know, take an extra turn; deal 8 damage to a random enemy ~~hero;~~ Reno 2.0; or, the worst of them all, your chargers are 5/5s this game?
---
Well, I bet he's looking back at his review to realize how completely wrong he was.
---
Very early builds I had a lot more demons, and lackeys.  They were better in the early game but it felt like it lacked options for closing out a game.  
---
Definitely want to revisit them.
---
I've been trying to weigh up the positives vs negatives of Void Contract too.   I think to best utilize it, you'd have to wait for the Elekk + Plot Twist combo in hand, then use the contract, to manipulate the deck to have better cards for you.  But that means holding on to another card in hand for a while, which there isn't much room for.  
---
Might try and fit it into the next build actually.  But I still think it might be for a deck of its own, sort of built around it.
---
They seem to not want the meta to change that often. When Standard was announced, people suggested that, instead of wiping out a year's worth of cards at the start of a new year's expansion, they wipe they oldest set when they release each new one.
---
Blizzard said they did not want to do this.
---
No I know, he’s at 6 so the minion would put him to 5. He has waggle equipped at 4 attack, and greenskin would make it be 5 attack.
---
Yeah all the time, just play your best deck and keep track of what cards you end up not playing and try to tweak those cards first
---
It failed harder than the Berlin Wall.
---
I'm pretty sure 7 is the cap on dudes.
---
It’s odd how other games have much more consistent balance, with hard counters for most things.
---
I always rat on 2 against big priest. Either I hit their barnes and my win chance increases considerably, or I hit something else and concede on the spot
---
Lord Mech Warrior is Odd Warrior's father.
---
I agree it is a stretch. He was clearly wrong with the info we have. Still he couldn't talk about changes, even if that happened due to the NDA. All in all, he was on his way out here and he didn't do it in a glorious way.
---
So far I like the production value and concept. Not sure what I feel about spoiling content early, but I think it's gonna be fun.
---
I must admit, warrior took me to rank 10 this season after a few month hiatus. Once ROS dropped I didn't buy any packs but got lucky with Elysiana from the free packs. Damn, I remember one mirror match where I only won because Elysiana gave me a choice for banker. Once my opponent saw banker drop he conceded since I'm assuming he only had one youthful brewmaster and already used it. It does feel dirty to always have devastator. I think the most devastators I've played in a match was 5. Boom does carry so many games.
---
OP is a simpleton with simple problems. They don't grasp simple solutions, but it is a solution.
---
When you "fix" his current problem, he'll find another one. As usual.
---
He'll stop whining when he stops playing.
---
I typically dust my non standard cards and that's how I've been able to play this expansion for free so far. But yeah fair enough.
---
It's all about perspective. I LOVE grindy control matches with multiple Elysiana's and the like. If you don't, okay another deck like rogue or Hunter. Just gotta find what you find enjoyable.
---
I can't tell if you are asking sarcastically.

---
Tier 2 is dynamic and changing, Tier 1 is Rogue and that's not going to change any time soon.
---
Dalaran Heist opens in a week but streamers are already playing it? So much for "stop killing the hype". Fucking idiots running this game I swear to god.
---
And really. Daly min 1 times...
---
shaukuku#1175
---
What fucking sadist is controlling who we watch and took us off the woman (sorry I genuinely don't remember her name) as she was calculating how to survive that last boss? That was beyond infuriating.
---
Depends on the decklists probably. I have a fairly positive winrate against control warrior with my control Shaman. And frankly win or lose, it's my favorite matchup. I love long and grindy games like that.
---
The greed isn't the price, the greed is the value for the price.  They're siphoning an extra 1000+ gold out of players' pockets by changing to a paid model instead of free.  And they're locking up 3000 gold for the first two months of the expansion, I already bought all my RoS packs on day 1 but now I have to wait until the second month before I actually get the rest of them.
---
Ehh, not if you play between ranks 1–5 each month. It's all the same.
---
Classic blunder.
---
It gets more eyes on the game. Streamers are social media influencers, and if you can promise them some benifit to playing your game over others, they will play it and get their audience to at least think about your game.
---
Shh dont tell anyone but zoolock is the current highest winrate deck
---
Dang. You got me.
---
What deck are you playing? Just curious.
---
JuiceJuice #11398, NA. Add me if you still need help!
---
Mathematically it was a much better value than buying packs as each wing was 700 gold for a guaranteed legendary plus some other cards.
---
Right?! 
---
I just can't seem to win against warrior with my tempo rogue! Obviously, I win any other matchup apart from warrior, but I should win against warrior too! This is so unfair. /s
---
Give me a break people. Rogue is the problem and the one reason why warrior is being played is because it counters the only broken deck in the meta right now.
---
The downvoting isn't meant for you to bring the person down just because don't agree with what he said. It's supposed to be for when it contributes nothing to the discussion, which isn't really the case.
---
He was just saying that there are other modes in the game(which is factual, is it not?). Sure you may not enjoy those modes, but he stated that he plays arena. Which may not be affected quite as much by card balancing as Standard of course, but various tweaks do affect Arena all the same.
---
It's not that I don't understand, it's that you were downvoting based on a difference of opinion and you simply didn't like his, so down it goes. That's an unfortunate consequence of all too many people here.
---
Control warrior stomps tempo rogue
---
For our tests, it seemed like the success rate was 5% instead of 50%. It would depend on how they implemented the code.
---
A somewhat typical way (in C#):
---
`bool failure = new Random().Next() % 2 == 0;`
---
But could also be something like this,
---
`boolean failure = new Random().NextDouble() &lt; 0.5;`
---
And for some reason changed to 
---
`boolean failure = new Random().NextDouble() &lt; 0.05;`
---
 
---
Or
---
`boolean failure = new Random.Next(0,100) &lt; 50;`
---
Changed to 
---
But any of that *should* be caught in a code review process.
---
If Devastator couldn’t be discovered I feel like it would be a strong but not infuriating card like it is now
---
Harsh but honest truth. Tbh this sub is full of people losing to their one bad matchup then complaining about that one match up constantly
---
It's the change I think they should make. At 3 it's an automatic keep in every mulligan. At 4, I'm not sure it's even worth keeping in the mulligan.
---
Joybuzz, Galvanizor, and Shudderwock is the core combo. If you draw Joybuzz and Shudderwock before cthun you can kill him pretty easily. If you draw Cthun first you can drop Cthun's cost with Galvanizor and Shudderwock so you can kill him with a voodoo doll or something.
---
And lots of tier 2 decks stomp Control Warrior.  CW is Tempo Rogue's only counter (maybe Secret Hunter, we'll see) and it loses to most other decks, it's really easy to target in the meta.  The actual best way to beat Tempo Rogue without losing points against everyone else is by teching in the mirror.
---
Are those not eyebrow-holders?
---
yeah you are completely right but someone who is new like me, cant just make whatever wacky deck they want like all the streamers and youtubers
---
I'd guess that in some circumstances condition on draw effect gets skipped or overwritten.
---
&gt; Also, says hearthstone takes no skill while running out of time thinking of the best moves. And then he praised gwent and artifact. Whatever.
---
I dont think he ever said hearthstone takes no skill. A lot of pros who quit HS said HS doesnt give the best players a big enough edge over less good players. You can still consider all the possibilities and optimise for the extra 1% chance of winning. But the small percentage is not enough for the best players to consistently win tournaments since the sample size is so small. Like even dog, thijs, kolento couldnt qualify for world.
---
yea the camera man is a nonce for that
---
Remember when yogg was in every deck for just this reason? “Oh I’m dead on board with zero outs...time to raise my odds from 0% to 50% by playing a single card.”
---
So you posting this to get warrior nerfed, the only class which got rogue somehiw restricted? Wow...
---
It is not too early. Last year nerfs were announced this many weeks after the expansion dropped, and WW came out some days after ROS this time. Nerfs patches also happen each time more frequently.
---
I'm not saying nerfs need to happen right now but this could have been their chance before waiting too much but Im not entirely sure about that.
---
When reading that part, I mainly just think those kinds of people are the type to defend themselves in any way possible. I mainly ignore that type.
---
Video is unavailable now, sad
---
Actual casual players don't even know what the meta is. If you're building decks around the meta, you aren't a casual player.
---
I'm not watching the stream because I want to experience the content for myself. It just seems like such a bad move to have this whole event that spoils the entire single player mode. I wouldn't buy it if I already knew what it's all about from the get go.
---
I think the helmeted avatar they use in game is awful. Hides her entire face, no character or personality to relate with.
---
Build medium but threatening boards over and over. When I beat conjurer mage, it's because he only ever put a giant on board or went all in with Khadgar in one turn. If you just constantly throw down 2-3 solid minions, you're favored by a long shot unless he's very lucky.
---
They seem to be swapping almost at random, with no consideration of what is currently being shown.
---
Could not agree more. Feels so pointless. They could just as well have had some interns play the game.   
---
   
---
Likewise, constantly switching from game to game kind of prevents me from getting invested in the actual runs/decisions of the streamers. Kind of hard to follow if you only get to see 15 second snippeds from every other boss.
---
I opened two golden ones so please don’t remove it, it’s the only thing I have worth living for.
---
gnomes aren't all related they're just gnomes
---
How did you takeaway that i think warrior is OP when i mention (or at least imply) that most decks are teched for rogue? Obviously rogue is the beginning and end of the whole meta.
---
Im playing battlecry rogue and Nomi priest and im really happy to face warrior.
---
This isn't the official hs  site releasing information

Warrior is tier 1 in latest Vs report unless I'm misremembering
---
See, you say that, but Naxx was beautifully polished, had tons of awesome artwork, themed voicelines, hidden interactions.
---
Blackrock Mountain was similarly super fun
---
Did you just say it was okay to say my mother was raped just because you think I'm a meanie?
---
Nat Pagle didn't draw enough and Nat, the Darkfisher drew too much. Now all is balanced in the world as it should be.
---
Fwiw Mech Hunter is a lot easier once you drop two cards for a pair of silences. I cut a Town Crier and an Acolyte when I got rank 4 and faced a lot of them, have a 66% winrate since. Though mech Hunter dropped off at rank 1, so I'm considering swapping back.
---
The first wing of this is free and looks like it's about as robust as previous dungeon runs
---
RAFAAAAAAAMMMMMM!
---
No nerfs? 😭
---
1. Didn't say 2 armour is a selling point.. it's just something that boom gets on top. Yes he's not a tempo card, but warrior is a class that is fine using up a turn doing nothing but gain 7 armour and substantially boost their next turn plays. This is the class with brawl, shield slam, dynomatic, echo board clear, omega, already decently armoured etc remember. Not to mention your next turn minions will all be able to attack immediately. And yes his cost is absolutely relevent because it means by turn 8 you can be gaining 25% of max hp worth of armour and slamming big mechs with rush.
---
2. "Sometimes it's strong". Gonna have to hard disagree there. Giving all your mechs rush is absolutely broken and largely the reason why boom is OP.
---
3. Yes the hero powers are random. Most of them are very good however, and they are only the side dish to the main course, which is of course the passive rush.
---
4. How is anduin infinite? You need to play cards (which can actually run out) to refresh his effect and even then it's a whopping 2 damage. Definitely good but not in the same conversation. Jaina is able to create elementals provided you kill something on the board. Her passive is also extremely strong but it's much slower than booms effect as you need to play elementals and have them survive. Also, her healing caps at 30hp while boom can keep gaining armour until fatigue is a mere tickle.
---
5. Gul'dan has probably the best hero power, I'll concede that for sure. But he's a 10 mana card and they don't get played unless they're extremely good. Most 10 mana cards that are good feel overtuned, like UI and zuljin.
---
Dunno why you're riding so hard with valeera but she's not among the best (read: not the best =/= bad). The best have always been gul'dan, rexxar and jaina. And I would say boom is slightly worse or on par with some of those 3 and better than the rest.
---
And still, that amount of answers is often not enough. 
---
Khadgar Mage can just force you into dropping a Brawl by playing their first giant + a caling, then the 2/7 with calling, or an Astromancer and Calling, etc. They just have so many avenues to generate huge multiple minions that it drains our ability to take them out quickly.
---
Maybe ask the Slay the Spire folks?
---
We don't fucking know shit about some other randomass game.
---
That's totally fair, but your going to run into that whenever you're new to a game regardless. When I was new I focused on improving my skills in arena, where everyone is on equal footing, and slowly focusing on building one good deck and one fun deck (they could be the same deck if you like). Part of the fun was figuring out how to make a decently competitive deck with the cards I have. 
---
And if recommend looking up the post earlier detailing cheap competitive decks. A guy went from rank 5 to legend in 22 hours (totally doable spread out over the course of a month) with decks that included no epics or legendaries. So being competitive is completely doable even for relatively new players.
---
Yeah what i mean is that across the board, all decks can beat warrior by adding some of the crazy value class legendaries or you tech for rogue but if you add both the average deck stops working.
---
the real problem is mage with giant+conj, complete clown fiesta
---
Raising Elysiana to 9 or even 10 is a change I'm very happy to see, speaking as the Control Warrior. The swinginess of the mirror is stupid, and placing literally the entire game on the back of Elysiana is boring.
---
is there gonna be a special quest we need to make room for?
---
To find information on cards, you can visit a bunch of different sites. Here's a website called  [Hearthstone Top Decks](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/cards/). That link will take you to the card lookup page. You can also comment in the Hearthstone subreddit with the name of a card and a bot will reply with that card's information. Example: \[\[Cannon Barrage\]\]

Information on how to get specific Heroes can be found [here](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Hero). Glhf!

6/-/- | Deal 3 damage to a random enemy. Repeat for each of your Pirates.

They talk about engagement a lot because their profit numbers kinda suck compared to what they used to be. Money &gt; engagement &gt; nothing because you can always easily milk the enfranchised players if you happen to deliver a decent product - that's why engagement matters.
---
List? Looks like fun.

I've only ever had this happen when I disconnect from wifi or am playing in an area with awful service. Sucks that this is such an issue for others tho.

yeah, I am trying to make a bunch of cheap decks but even those I can't do because even 2k dust is way too much and I simply dont have that
---
You opened your post with an insult to peoples reading ability, then went on a massive rant with no TL;DR for people who don't care enough to sit through your brain numbing story, you're angry at control warrior, don't let that make you angry with everyone you respond to.

Boycott the stream then, the only way to get the point across to Team 5.

disiike#2220 - EU - trade quest

Thank god these 8 get to play this early instead of releasing it so everyone could play it. Then again who would watch this stupid ass showdown if they could just play it themselves.
---
I wanted to create deck which I saw in the Internet, but I haven't necessary cards to do it.
---
I opened my post with an insult after I got slammed by the first 4 people.  They didn't read the post and then yelled at me for a point I didn't make.
---
I am wondering maybe that the problem lies with the Dr.Boom hero card. The sheer amount of value it gives. The discover for Omega Devastator, Dyn-o-matic. The 2 mana 7 armor. The "give all mech rush."
---
What's vanessa vancleef do?
---
i think theres a  BIG difference between voicing his opinions on what is wrong with the game and actually hating it...   
---
most people here have an annoyance in some regard with HS as it isn't perfect so he isn't really doing anything different than the average player except hes on a bigger platform.   
---
TBH i can emphasize as he has been playing it for such a long time with little change and just like any job he has the right to voice his displeasure if he truly isn't happy.
---
First off, no one attacked him personally, we're criticizing his online persona.  Take Athene for example, I personally loathe his online persona, but holy fuck is he an amazing person irl. 
---
Secondly, you asked me why I thought he was bad, so I gave you an answer.  I don't have anything against Toast as a person, I just personally don't think he's a good content creator. 
---
Thirdly, I really don't give a damn if you were in the military.  You don't know anything about me, for all you know I could be in the military as well.  The term snowflake isn't age restricted.  It refers to basically anyone that is overly sensitive and easily offended. 
---
Lastly, as I've stated before and given an example of, OP asked the communities opinion, then I gave mine.  You took offense to it and now we're here.  You chose to pick me out of everyone else for no reason.  I'm assuming because you actually are a Toast fan, and you're just hiding it.  Either, doesn't bother me.  I respect his hustle, he has his fanbase, he's just not for me because I think he's a horrid content creator. 
---
GG No Re

Now it costs 5 mana :/

With all the nerfs I heard hunter had soon after beta it must've been a real broken class
---
You can buy them with gold. 
---
There, I helped. Feel free to stop whining.
---
Elysiana making games go to the turn limit is really bad for Hearthstone and goes against the dev team's stated goal of having games that are usually fairly quick.
---
They've said before that having games take 40 minutes can be okay if it's rare.  It shouldn't be a common occurrence, and right now it is.  It's also ruining tournaments by making tourneys take 12 hours.
---
Note that this isn't really a question of Elysiana's power level.  But they'll probably "fix it" by nerfing her into oblivion so that nobody plays her.  If nobody plays her, games won't take 40 minutes.
---
Basically what you are saying is you don’t care to learn how to pilot decks well, so you prefer to have easy access to low skill cap decks that make your life easier.  I play Nomi Priest sometimes, and I win. I just am a flake and switch decks every 2-3 games also. But when I play it, I either win or come close to it. It’s a good deck.
---
I think the gain 6 armor equip a weapon is more bullshit.
---
The worst. I've also been getting a little notification bar that wont go away even when the game is fully updated and closed.
---
The effect now works at the start of your turn. It used to work at the END of your turn. 
---
This was at a time when there was not much clear, so getting rid of Nat on turn 2 was pretty tough. It is a body that you gave give buffs to, and it is drawing you cards. If it gets you 2 cards that’s insane value when compared to arcane intellect. And it gets 2 cards with a 25% chance if it lives for 2 turns. 
---
I remember one of the early pro tournaments was literally determined by Nat draws. The player missed like 3 draws from Nat and if he had hit one of them he would have had pyro for the victory........so classic HS.
---
Innervate, Wild Growth, Nourish, Keeper of the Grove, Ancient of Lore, Force of Nature, Aviana, Spreading Plague, Naturalize (HoFed), also earlier was nerfed Savagery, Wrath, Byte, Claws
---
No, there is definitely a ceiling at a certain point if you aren't skilled enough. Anybody could make it to legend with enough time, but top 20, top 50, even top 100 takes a degree of skill in understanding the meta and how to adapt to daily, minute changes in it as well as consistent, optimal play game after game.
---
I don't think I could do it and I doubt a lot of people here who claim they could would be able to either.
---
Not sure how u can climb with 10% lost, that would put you at 48% win rate even if you use best deck right now.  
---
I too play on mobile (exclusively), rank 3-4 is as high as I can climb given the handicap.
---
and \*snap\* I lose half my games...
---
Wonder how that affects Mirror Entity. Do you still get the transformed minion or will we now get a faceless body? Same question regarding Muck... Muckmaster? The 4/4 shaman card.
---
In the end it happened because the meta needed balance. They could have decided they could balance the meta too. We dont know if it had to be similar to that extreme for those nerfs to have happened.
---
polished HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA you dumb mo-- LOL
---
I could've put both that and Harrison Jones on the picture too, but there wasn't much to work with. My mistake.
---
Yes
---
Stahp, I’m not trying to argue that every patch note ever is for standard but come on, in hearthstones history more patch notes have been focused on standard then, arena, wild, dungeon runs, and puzzles combined. If you think it’s any other way then I need you to site sources.
---
This is the right line for this
---
Hey look, its pretty much all of my opponents this season....
---
it's dungeon run style adventure so it's not like when you win you're done. Plus adventures used to be on release day, not 1 month after.
---
Do it. Just. DO IT !!
---
That's not a response to what they said.
---
it's called stretching their content thin and their playerbase satisfied at the very minimum.
---
You can buy the expansion with gold. So you can get the legendary at any point with gold. Doesn’t have to be all at once, just when you buy all 5 wings. That’s his point.

&gt; Fixed an issue where playing cards like Faceless Manipulator with Flobbidinous Floop in hand resulted in Floop transforming into the minion that Faceless Manipulator copied, instead of transforming into a copy of the Faceless Manipulator.
---
I always thought this interaction was weird
---
&gt;And the goalposts move again. "This is a feudal society of absolute monarchies but lets hold her to the rules of modern western legal systems". Something you dont hold against anyone in the setting but her.
---
What are you talking about?? Dany literally said she wanted to destroy that system and then went and did tyrant shit for a decade. She placed the goalposts and then kicked the field goal in the opposite direction. You're being willfully obtuse.
---
&gt;You understand nothing like that happens without the consent of the leadership of those cities right? It wasn't a couple guys doing it, it was a couple guys possibly objecting.
---
This is literally made up so ypu can continue to bitch on the internet. Your mental gymnastics is ridiculous.
---
&gt;If you're paying that little attention to her expression in the scene where she meets hizdar that you think she didn't care at all you, again, are beyond hope.
---
Says the guy twisting everything into a "dink n dumb character assassinated my favorite character" circlejerk. You make up whatever bullshit you need to, The writing has still been on the wall for a decade. You can go back and read articles written years ago about Dany's theoretical descent into madness. 
---
&gt;And for the FIFTH time: BEING AN ABSOLUTE MONARCH DOES NOT MEAN YOU RANDOMLY SLAUGHTER YOUR OWN POPULATION FOR NO REASON.
---
Tell that to the Tarlys when imprisonment was literally a smarter option. Tell that to the innocent meereenese nobles she slaughtered without even knowing they were involved. Tell that to every other person that has suffered from her capriciousness and brutality. Moreover, in order for this descent into madness to be believable, this doesn't have to be a decision we can sympathize with. It just needs to be a decision we find legible. Considering her personality, words, and actions, people have been calling this event for literal years. This did NOT come out of nowhere.
---
&gt;You know what, I was going to finish refuting your points but I'm just gonna leave it at that bit. Nothing else you're saying matters to that bit.
---
bold strategy cotton
---
That's definitely positive and something I should have added in the OP! 
---
That's true, that is the main problem. Check ins like other dev teams do don't seem to satisfy everybody either. Looking for example at the apex subreddit, so many people will still complain after regular check ins due to their impatience. Pleasing everybody would be impossible.
---
haha well done!! except against druid/paladin....
---
Why do you do this to yourself ?
---
Now that the question is out in the open, I need answers before I can go back to my regular life.
---
Most classes have a way to deal with a t4 giant though. Hex, Poly, Shield Slam/Execute, a 16/16 Edwin, SW: Death, Hunter's Mark... and the longer the game goes on,  the more options become available.
---
It feels bad to lose to, absolutely, but counterplay exists.
---
The Mountain tanked part of the tower coming down on him. I think he could survive the fall if he wasn't incinerated. 
---
Sandor was definitely RIP when he went out the side of the building though.
---
how original
---
it was a big mistake showcasing the entire The Dalaran Heist mode. I tuned in for a couple minutes and suddenly lost interest.
---
SaltyMcNulty, because in an alternative timeline on The Wire, Jimmy gave up being a cop and became a pirate.
---
And my point is that the last chapter won't be buyable with gold until next month, when it comes out.
---
Card Games in a nutshell, you mean.
---
Yeah, the game is definitely less smart that regular humans
---
Ah yeah I have seen that complaint quite a few times. I don't think I've seen her played once myself, but I high in the fun ranks of wild so not as many slam-your-dick-in-a-door type suffering decks going around.
---
My guess is that they're doing it this time because of the fact that there's a cost this time. Get the word out there early so people can see how fun the game mode is, and help make up their minds of whether they want to make the gold/money investment to access it. I'd be surprised if they did this again for future content.
---
I play on a retina screen it still looks pixelated :/
---
Yeah, I get super frustrated with this. I used to be happy with myself for having a card advantage, now im always scared
---
Rogue had it more. VanCleef had stealth, conceal was 0 mana, hero power upgraded existing weapon instead of replacing, defias ringleader was 2-3, not to mention cold blood, blade flurry and of course 5 mana auctioneer and 4 mana leeroy for triple shadowstep. Oh, and now replaced spells Envenom that was doubling your weapon's attack and 1 mana Adrenalin Rush that draws a card with combo to draw one more card
---
Sure but all the power cards were common or rare (besides noteably loatheb). Like for the 1st wing, the rewards were haunted creeper, nerubar weblord, nerubian egg, maexxna, poision seeds, and Anubar ambusher. of these creeper, egg, and seeds have seen competitive play. crafting all of the good cards would cost 240dust (240g). But to get them you had to pay 700g! a 460g (or 300%) premium.
---
Watch again. She does nothing remotely close in neither of these 4/5 cities:
---
Qarth: literally kills 3 people.
---
Astapor: Masters, Slavers, anyone with a whip(except her), there is a scene where drogo flies behind her breathing fire but there isn’t any damage shown to the city when she leaves.
---
Yunkai: 3 people slaughtered a bunch of guards, the slave soldiers surrendered. Minimal bloodshed.
---
Mereen: the slaves killed a bunch of masters(not necessarily their guards) and city fell with minimal collateral. 136 additional masters were crucified for doing the same to slave children.
---
Vaes Dothrak: she burned their meeting hall and everyone kneeled to their new khaleesi. 20-30 dead
---
Minimal casualties every time. Mostly slavers and soldiers. There were some later complications but she never once attacked or burned civilians.
---
still got it?
---
nice!!
---
please dont play against me....
---
Yeah, the goober who wrote this article presumably has early access like many streamers got. They are a doofus for writing this article without getting the basic facts right, though.
---
Well, piloted shredder was a doomsayer in a metal suit and still was a mech.
---
That's why you don't skip unit testing, kids.
---
Wouldn't dormant also essentially resummon the minion clearing all buffs?
---
Oh yea and I know this is gonna get deleted and downvoted idk worth sharing it
---
The point is that, as boring as Rumble Run was, at least it was a complete experience.  When the RoS adventure was first announced, it wasn't clear if the free wing would be its own full thing and the added wings just that, additional to the first wing, or if you were going to get less than before unless you paid.  Now it's clear that the first wing is absolutely not meant to be its own satisfying game mode, it is solely intended to tease the rest of the wings.
---
In Rumble Run we got 9 heroes with 3 shrines each.  True, the game mode wasn't very fun, but the content was there.  In RoS we get 1 hero with 3 hero powers.  That simply can't match the previous free PvE's.  This is more akin to Karazhan, where you get the first free wing and it's fun but you only get the full experience if you pay.
---
I see. Looks like quite the game operated in the stark contrast to how Hearthstone does today. Realistically the team could have reworded and translated the less random elements of the WoW TCG to a digital format, but it makes you wonder how it would have really turned out in the end. Would I prefer less RNG in Hearthstone? Yes and no. I'd have to imagine that a no-RNG version of Hearthstone would be a lot more taxing on the UI and its design and result in longer games due to the requirement of the opponent having to be constantly present to respond to other player's actions/cards. Not that that would necessarily be a bad thing, but it would definitely feel a whole lot different.
---
I have sent more screenshots [https://imgur.com/a/UTa4GqJ](https://imgur.com/a/UTa4GqJ)

No, it definitely was not like this. [[Velen's Chosen]] used to inadvertently kill Priest's board back in the day because players would forget that the spell damage made Auchenai and CircleofHealing do 5 damage to the entire board.

3/-/- | Give a minion +2/+4 and Spell Damage +1.  
---
If you hate aggro so much then just make a deck good against it. I'm assuming your talking about rogue because that's literally the only viable aggresive deck btw and there are decks that can beat it
---
So think and discover a combo that beats aggro.......
---
Hmm so silence priest, mech warrior, and thief tempo rogue... 
---
What are the other decks?
---
1. Mage is much less common than those 3, at least in my experience. Also what mage deck are you talking about? I've only seen Khadgar variants and small mage, both have existed since the first week.
---
2. Almost all Tempo Rogues look exactly the same. Looking at VS Reaper, most rogues play a very similar list, with only a few tech cards. 
---
3. I'll give you that one. Secret Hunter is a newer deck list, but mech hunter is still much more often played. 
---
You don't need to wait for the entire meta to settle before you know the problems. I don't need to know the perfect Rogue list to know that Tempo Rouge needs a nerf.
---
Lmao was getting hyped till the end
---
Lies!
---
Deception!
---
Powercreep bloodfen raptor smh my head
---
There is a champion in league of legends that used to have an ability that would amplify all subsequent damage done to the target by up to 15%. It took 3+years for them to realize that it increased the damage text that showed up in game but wouldnt actually increase the damage dealt.
---
They only found this out when someone designing another ability copied it as a template and increased the % significantly. The next patch it was bug fixed and he was nerfed to compensate lol
---
To enjoy the solo player content? If you don't want to play it, then just use your gold on packs.
---
Me too, I like Toast as well in his own way, but damn Trump just seems like a happy guy I'd love to be friends with. Good thing Kripp is on his team to balance the salt dynamic.
---
What are you debating on for flex cards?
---
The core is pretty set:
---
2 coldlights
---
2 executes
---
2 Dead Man's
---
2 Bring It On
---
2 Warpath
---
2 Shield Slams
---
2 Shield Blocks
---
2 Weapons Projects
---
2 Drywhiskers
---
2 Brawls
---
1 Brann
---
1 Zilliax
---
1 Harrison Jones
---
That's 23 cards right there, the rest are generally tech cards or various draw options.  (Dirty Rats, Acolytes of Pain, Blood Razors, Dynomatic, etc.)
---
The Tempostorm meta report puts in Scourgelord Garrosh and while the weapon you equip deals with minions pretty well, Dr. Boom is such a powerhouse, and the button generally does more than the Scourgelord Hero Power.  Plus discovering useful mechs with rush can be crucial.
---
I personally like at least 1 Omega Assembly for an early on Mech, or to combo with Boom.  
---
There's a ton of wiggle room in those last 7 cards, I'd say experiment and see what you like.  GL HF.
---
Are the random decks different from the Whizbang decks?
---
RAFAAM THE SUPREME ARCHE- oh wait.
---
Packs as compensation for those of us who don't have access to this
---
Plus the quest rogue PTSD as they released same time.
---
What card?
---
*Wrathguard intensifies*
---
You could say to the deck tracker Zayle is a stranger.

---
2/4/3 Demon | Whenever this minion takes damage, also deal that amount to your hero.  
---
I don't think this is supposed to happen because you have just lost a legendary.  You now don't get a free legendary from the adventure that hasn't opened yet or you get a second copy worth 400 dust.  Either way you are short one legendary.  This should have been a different legendary.
---
Anyone run the test subject with the nomi priest? I'm curious to know when you try to get unlimited seance going.
---
interesting but isn't 3 mana too late for most of the synergies, namely secret keeper and sunreaver spy?
---
Dealing with the Mountain Giant play is better done by printing new, potentially multiple, twelve mana minions with low stats than altering Conjurer's Calling directly. Outside of that particular play, the only reason to even consider changing the card, it is fine.
---
You also misinterpreted my point about Brawl. That was in the context of those ten mana plays, not turn five double Mountain Giant plays. I can agree that should be dealt with in some way, and while it is powerful on ladder, it is not warping the format like say Keleseth-Shadowstep combos or Spiteful Summoner were. As such it doesn't warrant immediate change.
---
Bleys#1772 NA - Will show, you go first. Have done multiples in the past (thread history available)
---
I'm glad this is a thing.
---
I downvote anyone who calls that card a Flame Waker.
---
Keep in mind that the card is just "discover a mech, if you have 10, gain 3 random mechs".  You don't really discover the 3
---
dont you get it? streamers are better human beings than you. you dont deserve to start playing the game as soon as they get to!  
---
it is pretty hilarious that they do this shit on a digital game that has no reason to delay it to the rest of the playerbase.
---
Batterhead, yikes..
---
Can you craft it?
---
I literally just made the whole thing out of blind rage.
---
This made me laugh a lot
---
Replying both to u and /u/GengarsDad, I play the game for fun and I craft fun decks. I used Kingsbane Rogue when it was useful, a shudder shaman, a whizbang and now I crafted an Ancient one deck. I do not tryhard and I wanna have fun but players seem to enjoy swiping their screens like some animals and do 0 combos. I could tryhard with a counterdeck and have the same amount of fun as they do, but I don't wanna get to that low level, that's just not the point of the game
---
Or.. i just make dust of it?
---
Were we told that? On a couple of occasions I've asked whether this is basically Dungeon Run, and people have responded saying, "It's like a hybrid between dungeon run and the old adventures" - but it was unclear how they got that impression.
---
Can confirm. Have played control warrior.
---
Same with mine.
---
Now I know not to open packs until I get golden Zayle. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Not many, but sun cleric wasn’t that bad back then. Priests had PWS. Pallies had buffs like they always do. While it wasn’t “omg I have to kill it before it is a 10/10!!!!” Patel could make some trades.
---
Not exactly.  You can dust your ordinary Zayle and get just 25% of the dust back which means you have lost 75% of a legendary.  You can dust your gold Zayle and keep the ordinary Zayle but you no longer get to play all golden Evil decks.  There is a reason people crafted golden Whizbangs.  They are more fun to play.
---
A fair result would be for Blizzard to offer full 1600 dust refunds on normal Zayle for the next month.
---

CMBurns#1462 NA 80G Quest Trade, I'll Show First
---
And that is why they started the grandmaster league, a place where you can watch well established pro players duke it out every week. 
---
Either ladder requires a lot of games, or the rankings are volatile and nearly meaningless.  Legend ladder isn't just decided by the number of net wins you have like lower rank, 100 games at a 60% winrate will get you further than 1000 games at a 52% winrate (based on my experience at high legend).  A system that's willing to say 'oh, you won 10 games in a row, that's a 100% winrate so you're the best!' would be terrible.
---
Not entirely.  Discover cards are weighted at x4 for class cards.  That weight still applies to omega assembly.  So, yes they are random, but you are very likely to get at least one warrior mech, and those on average are good.  Specifically, dyno, devastator, and security rover are all good pulls.  I'd say the only "bad" class mech off that card is eternium rover.
---
Light the fuses!!!
---
If that’s good for f2p quality of life, then it would have been great for f2p quality of life 5 weeks ago.
---
if you used a deck tracker you'd instantly see all 30 cards as well.
---
works for whizbang at least.
---
&gt; Could be wrong, but I think it doesn't allow you to use the card yet. That's what I've been seeing in other posts about getting the card as well? I'm lead to believe that OP is lying for karma farming, but I could very well be wrong. Apologies in advance.
---
the other 2 post is talking about getting it from rng card that discover/grant random card.  
---
i think OP have a case similar to this person , where they open the pack and got lucky with it , this one got a screenshot 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/booabg/finished_an_arena_run_and_opened_a_pack_and_got/
---
He almost did it on turn 7
---
&gt; 
---
How did noone realize that? or is it really a mistake?
---
probably they forgot about it like how they forgot to disable whizbang in the custom brawl that have less than 30 card last time.
---
It works just like whizbang
---
Where'd they come from this early in the game? What does your decklist look like? I've been trying to tweak this archetype to make it go off more consistently because it's so much dumb fun when it goes off, but I haven't been having a lot of luck.
---
i'm curious though, whether this "resets" the pity timer for RoS packs.
---
Whuuuuat!?
---
I feel like it’s a bit of a mistake to not capitalize on the built in subscriber bases.  But I do get that they want to be able to moderate the chats as it’s happening.
