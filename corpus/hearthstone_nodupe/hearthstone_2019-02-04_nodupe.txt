The rumored 9th class of the game that people claim blizzard will release every expansion but never does
---
Hello! Hello! Hello!
---
They should delete Baku and Genn from the game. It is horrible how every single new card and how every single buff/nerf is dictated by these two cards. Blizzard make so many changes to give themselves "design space" yet they go ahead and release these cards.
---
Do you have a youtube channel where you make these?
---
After nerf would be no reason to run it, but now almost every class runnin' 1 cost spells. 
---
Good bot 
---
Fireball reduced to 2 mana but now is "Give a minion 'Takes 1 damage at the end of each turn'". 
---
2/2 frothing berserker has been deemed too difficult to remove and feels oppressive to play against. Frothing berserker is now 2/1
---
Haha true I literaly got 5 copies of this beast tamer guy (3 mana 3/4) and 1 this 0/2 armor thing. But eventually I got what I needed
---
Why do I feel like they are doing this for money and not to keep the game fresh. Standard Blizzard these days, let’s nerf all the classic cards so people have to buy more to stay relevant.
---
What [FeelingAirport](https://www.reddit.com/user/FeelingAirport) said. I know this interaction looks weird, but that's why explained it in the video at 8:55 :)
---
Nerf classic cards --&gt; Release basically essential cards in a new set --&gt; Profit.
---
However, they have taken steps to reduce the amount of Epic cards that are essential - when comparing last set to the few that came before it. 
---
But they don't need to make all the epics good. In fact, it's in their interest to only release a handful of powerful staples and to fill with tons of garbage.  
---
If there are no good epic, no one will actively seek them.  
---
If there are many, opening a bunch of packs will quickly give a playable combination meaning you are not in a rush to get more.  
---
If there are few, as it is now, you'll mostly open junk and if you get good cards, they will likely be across multiple classes, leaving you with half decks all over the place. So you'll have to either buy more packs or craft the missing cards. And with the ridiculously low rate of disenchanting cards, that's a lot of packs to spend on one card. 
---
reminds me of the time I randomly generated magma rager from menacing nimbus for lethal... the guy was like "good luck hitting legend with random cards"  like wtf? I'm a casual playing at rank 16 bro, as if I have time to hit legend.
---
Needs more twisting nether
---
I have no apology to accept as you didn't offend me. I'm just hoping that in the future you can be the better person in an exchange instead of lowering yourself down to someone else's level :)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All the best
---
I think prep at 3 mana might be more acceptable. At 2 mana you could still potentially have a 1 mana sap which is just a bit too strong 
---
Wow, that's a lot of dmg
---
Yep 103 as rogue and like 140 as druid
---
 
---
The rage on druid was palpable because I can't stand playing druid already
---
Mossy is useful, not against plagues, but it can make beast hunter quite bad day. 
---
At this point I’m past waiting for blizz to fix any issues it has with its current games and just looking forward to the next great game they are going to slowly ruin...
---
To follow up on this, evenlock can do very well in certain metas, but you really have to know the meta you're playing against. Right now, your tech cards are swamp ooze, mossy horror, and mojomaster zihi. Each of those counters a different style of deck, and I think mossy may not be particularly good in the current meta.
---
You'll need to adapt your deck to what you're facing on ladder. Oozes (or even doomsayers) may be useful against aggro, and bonemare might be helpful to push damage against a combo deck, but you'll have to choose one and hope you encounter the right type of opponent.
---
GUYS I PLAY GAME GIVE ME ATTENTION!
---
I WANT ATTENTION NOW SO FUCKING BADLY THAT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EVEN REACH THE FUCKING MILESTONE OF SIGNIFICANCE 
---
I GOT 11 WINS LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY AREN'T YOU LOOKING AT ME I GOT 11 WINS ON MY MOBILE PHONE GAME. 
---
No one gives a shit mate. Don't spam shit like this here, please. 
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;This means he is a demon minion that can be destroyed by pact.
---
So why can't he be destroyed by Assassinate?
---
Lost it at mind whump
---
This seems fair. But still a 4/4 for 3 mana? That is a little too cheap.
---
Let's crank up the cost to 4 mana as well.
---
Full Spell Hunter is worse than Midrange and Secret Hunter. You're making your deck worse by forcing To My Side and Rhok'Delar. Reddit wasn't wrong, don't be fooled because the Hunter core is strong compared to other classes.
---
&gt;Instead of Brawl removing all minions but one (too strong!), what if it just left half the minions on the board?
---
What if it destroyed all creatures except the one with the most attack power? Also make it cost 6 so it isn't oppressive in Odd Warrior.
---
&gt; Paladin: Divine Favor. Waaay too much potential draw. What if, instead, you draw 2 cards IF you have a divine shield minion on your side of the board? That's way more flavorful! (if shitty is a flavor)
---
&gt;Paladin: Divine Favor. Waaay too much potential draw. What if, instead, you draw 2 cards IF you have a divine shield minion on your side of the board? That's way more flavorful! (if shitty is a flavor)
---
Still too much draw and also useful in Odd Paladin. 4 Mana, Draw a card if your opponent has more cards in hand.
---
we got some big brain memery goin on in these here comments sherriff, i don't think the town can handle it
---
Because that's not fully correct. Lord Jaraxxus, the card, is a minion that is also a demon. Lord Jaraxxus, the hero, is just a demon. Tribes are an additional property of a card which could theoretically be on any card, but a minion cannot also be a hero or a spell.
---
I’d rather see seasonal limited formats.  With card bans, set bans, the like.  I think it would make seasons more interesting and give some players the shake up they want to see.  I’d love to see them try this for at least one month to gauge how players react.  I just want more formats.  Try things.  Even make brawlisium a more normal thing too. Come on. 
---
Best brawl deck is Aggro Druid lol
---
Again I invite you to correct my misunderstanding of your posts, and again you refuse.  I don't know what I'm supposed to think if not that my initial interpretation was correct.
---
&gt;&gt;discussion of the dust economy as useless
---
&gt;Correct Blizzard are the ones who can effect change.
---
The community has influence on Blizzard's decisions, so I don't think discussion is useless.  Even if the community had no influence, discussion would still not be useless, because it would build our understanding even if it didn't lead to practical change.
---
Jade Golems or Call of the Wild?
---
3 DI's 2 Demonbolt 2x Omega Agent and 2x Omega Defender. Wtf is this deck ?
---
Nozdormu is such a weird card that is probably a huge complicated mess to code, so I’m not surprised it is CONSTANTLY bugged. I’m pretty sure every expansion it has been bugged with some interaction. I’m genuinely surprised they haven’t changed it’s effect at this point.
---
TOO SLOW
---
It is definitely nice to see Team 5 has learned from their previous mistakes and seek to correct them in future designs.
---
Even Warlock isn't as good as it used to be, VS puts it in rank 4, with an average winrate of 46%. So you're not too far from that.
---
That being said, two things:
---
-Average winrates don't mean that much, some people play for 60-70% winrates with '50% winrate decks'. Average winrates are made by good and bad players both. 
---
-Ridiculously small sample. Even if you were an actual 60% winrate player, you would have streaks like that. (only 5 wins in 12 games). 
---
Play at least a hundred games if you want to have a little better idea how well you're doing with a deck. Before that point, the only thing you can get is the "feel" of the games... If you see that most of your losses are hopeless, and avoiding beginner's mistakes with the deck wouldn't change anything, then maybe you should try another deck; 
---
The thing is, though, it doesn't have that much support.  It is the support, and judging by the front page of reddit you would have thought it was a weak card even without the no minion requirement.  
---
the scary thing is this might be our future 
---
Now Skeeter, he ain't hurtin nobody.
---
When the nerfs hit, I think we'll see a lot more Mojomasters in Prieststone/Mecha'thunstone. 
---
Epics must either be completely necessary for a deck archetype to work or completely useless.
---
I really hope this doesn't stop them from printing crazy value combos altogether -- I find rexxar problematic too, but only because hes a late game value engine in a single card. An aggro deck can out value control decks if it has rexxar on 6, for goodness sakes. But things like dead mana hand warrior pay a significant price for the deck construction, requiring a ton of card draw and then two cards which are literally "pay 2 mana do absolutely nothing this turn" when played. Those sorts of decks are fine to me: it's the ease and convenience of the dks that bothers me so much. A single card slotted in can transform an otherwise tempo/aggro deck into an infinite value one. 
---
It's a zero sum game. If others are consistently having insane decks against you, you're just as likely to have them. In any case, as an arena main for 4 years, this is one of the better metas in my opinion. I'm no pro but I'm still averaging 6 wins. Skill is winning out.
---
wow calm down there,4 mana is too strong on even spell mage with auctioneer,we need to bump it to 5 mana
---
A returning player is going to be more upset that all of there old cards are now weakend.
---
Wow this post is so salty.
---
You forgot about the part of the warrior quest that the quest itself takes up a card slot, which if you're keeping it in your opening mulligan, is a very big deal.  Your mulligan's are that much worse with  1 less card you can throw away to get something you need for the matchup instead.  You also lose your armor up ability, which can be hurtful at times and you may lose some synergy with other warrior cards (armor as a resource).  Your point saying that the requirement is barely a thing is unjustified.
---
All quests have the caveat of occupying an early card spot in your deck.  All the death knights have immense capability of granting unlimited value, resources, or significant advantage over time (except for poor Garrosh).  At least the development team has realized this and started to tone things down (for now).
---
The point of this article and the conversation with Peter Whalen was more about trying to limit the recurring value of playing a hero card or tone it down.  Zul'jin accomplishes this and so does Dr. Boom to an extent (I still think Hagatha is crazy good as a value engine, Shamans don't miss totems that much these days).  
---
dont forget the confusing sac pac interaction
---
Rexxar is far from opressive, imo the only remotely relevant DKs in wild are Guldan and Anduin.
---
will see play in odd hunter,OP
---
This is the quality shitpost that r/hearthstone is known for.
---
It depends on how early they can play DK Rexxar and how lucky they get their zombeasts.
---
That v is cancer
---
I tried jan'alai without Baku and didn't like it, if you have geddon I'd swap them. 
---
I'd also replace anomaly with stonehill defender.
---
If you have book replace arcane intellect
---
I'd replace a geyser with surger
---
If you have it I'd replace a polymorph with lich King
---
Servant of kalimos with 7 Mana 6/6 deal 5 damage (can't think of the name) if you have it
---
Flamestrike with bonfire
---
If you don't have book of spectors, but do have keleseth look at replacing your 2 drops
---
Polymorph with Mountain giant if you have it
---
If you have mountain giant replace frost bolt with the 2/1 deathrattle get a spell
---
In all fairness even excluding Baku you can argue for Shield Slam being 2 Mana. It, like Hunter's Mark, has the potential to do a lot more than 3 damage -- and we know 2 Mana 3 damage is top quality value (Darkbomb/Frostbolt).
---
I'm not saying Shield Slam *should* be nerfed, but if they did make it Cost 2 Mana, I wouldn't be saying the card was gutted.
---
This is just your internet and hearthstones terrible way of not telling you “hey man ur not fuckin in here”
---
And if you cheer for 10000 on twitch they go down to 8, but only after you buy the 40 packs to make things fair 
---
Guess it wasnt Hearthstone's fault. Mb https://youtu.be/ynMk2EwRi4Q
---
恭喜发财！
---
Hehe - the ironic thing is that I've probably only played about 20-30 hours of Dota2 compared to thousands logged in Hearthstone. This reddit account was set up to give away beta keys on Steam since I mainly lurk, but have been getting more active in HS lately.
---
PS: Didn't know you had made essentially these suggestions earlier! Did you get any official response / insight from Blizz?
---
Your list looks good. No changes are necessary, but you could consider swapping your tech cards around to see what you like. There are lots of options for the last few slots (Ooze, Zihi, bonemare, geist, mossy, argent commander, cheaty anklebiter, doomsayer, demonic project, siphon soul...)
---
Make sure you always play for tempo. You win by smacking your opponent in the face with big dudes. Reactive cards like hellfire, defile, and spellstone should ideally only be used if they help you get ahead on board. Make full use of your hero power as long as you don't kill yourself with it.
---
Eternal is pretty interesting at very F2P friendly. Biggest mechanic change is the fact that minions are always targeted to go face, but can be blocked by your opponent’s minions. For example, I engage my 2 minions to attack and my opponent gets a counter turn to choose if he wants any of his own minions to block my minions attacks.
---
Shadowverse is also very F2P friendly, however I was very turned off by the anime art style. The main gimmick for that game is the “evolve” mechanic in which you get 3 evolves to immediately buff your minion you place down and give it charge.
---
Gwent is a whole different rodeo and I wasn’t a fan.
---
Duelyst adds a 3D tactics board to the mix and reminds me of Fire Emblem, but I don’t think it is very F2P friendly.
---
Haven’t played Artifact but it’s gotten major flak for its expensive nature.
---
Honestly I’m waiting on Reynad’s card game to come out. From what I have read and can remember, he will be selling cards in packs just like Hearthstone did with Adventures like League of Explorers back in the day. Buy the pack and get the whole set. I don’t really know much other than that, but it sounds interesting.
---
Guess the only option is to change the deathrattle to: " summon two 2/2 for your opponent"
---
Awww leokks had an off day.
---
The creeping problem i see that may come up, is people not feeling crafting is worth as much anymore. Blizzard has found a way to nerf decks without nerfing the expensive cards in it. It has certainly discouraged me from crafting legendaries in fear that the deck i craft them for, will die via proxy nerfs to other cards.
---
EU 80g Quest trade. I will show you my quest but I'd like you to go first please(check my post history I've done multiple quests here before)
---
Ohliuf#2405
---
Reddit is a revolving conveyor belt of content with OC dropped on the line occasionally.
---
Honestly, I think they're stuck with a hungry crab situation here, which is a no win. They'll eventually have to print a (probable legendary) hero power reversion card
---
25 makes odd paladin oppressive. They need to nerf it to 26.
---
i like the idea of increasing mana cost by one or two points, this is very indepth balancing. I am glad that someone takes care if the classic set :)
---
This game is dead.
---
Guys you are all forgetting something. King crush needs to be 11 mana.
---
The way it is worded right now, Baku and Genn allow for spells of any mana cost and only put a restriction on minions.
---
what about 11 mana?
---
TapuBolo#1763 friends to battle and learn from
---
Honestly that change sounds reasonable. Not really abused by aggro decks because the 1/1s can’t trade in a 8/2 (and their 1/1s becoming 1/2s isnt really a massive impact), but it still stops Pyro + Equality from being a free 2 card 4 mana. It does keep Equality + Consecrate in the game, but a 6 mana 2 card board clear isn’t nearly as strong (and a lot of the time in the past a turn 6 clear is too late. I’m specifically thinking of Pirate Warrior, Aggro Shaman and Murloc Paladin).
---
But 2 mana set minions to 2 health would make the card playable, nerf the Wild Pyromancer interaction, and make it still not particularly abusable by aggro (especially since odd Paladin can’t use a 2 mana variant).
---
This was a while ago. Giggling inventor is still 5 mana in the screenshot lol.
---
Nice,grats. I beat him two days ago. Now i'm looking for a paladin deck that's not OTK or odd and uses prelate + the tiger legendary (because that's the good cards I got) i'm on my way building something but it's not quite there yet.
---
You are totally right, all of the blizz games are dying due to greed for money, I've only played Overwatch and Hearthstone consistently and recently I just gave up on them...
---
 Also looked up how WoW was doing and that left me kind of sad since it's the main blizzard game and it barely has any active players (runescape has more active players than wow). 
---
Oh and now with the latest diablo release (the mobile game) I really think that whoever is in the higher ups needs to change for good or else this might be the end of the company 
---
Also, the maximum number of mana crystals is now reduced to 5 from 10. 
---
No one plays this dead game
---
Year of the Mammoth had some seriously powerful cards. The type of cards that you build decks around and define a class/meta. I haven't felt that with witchwood, boomsday, or rumble cards. I just want to have deck builds and cards that make me want to keep coming back and playing.
---
The updated wording states:
---
If your deck has **only** odd-Cost minions, upgrade your Hero Power.
---
Yes, the wording could be even more concise. You're right. But that's the idea.
---
Don't warsong commander my favorite animal commission =(
---
People don't eat Moon-cake in Lunar New year . It's for Mid Autumn festival which happens in August . Don't confuse between "Lunar" and "Moon"-cake . However , you are right about Red Envelope . I am glad I am Asian :D
---
Kripp is so adorable! He's one of the most positive figures in gaming, imo
---
What about Kezan Mystic in Wild? :(
---
&gt;Dr. Morgana
---
She’s in this game now too?
---
&gt;On day one you want to be able to play around with all the new cards but you don't own anywhere near them all (even if you buy the pre-expac bundle), by the time you've got a good collection the meta is pretty fixed and the experimental part is over.
---
This really should be the top comment. And i would like to add, that crafting cards now feels so bad, when you dont have that particular card from past expansions to make it work, or wont work in your experimentations cuz you dont have that other leggo, oh and did I mention that old card will get rotated in a few months. And that legendary you got from the openings? yea that deck will get nerfed soon but by nerfing another card from basic or classic set.
---
but it is so rng, it also has the ability for crap combos as well.
---
of course, what was i thinking!
---
For one,  its not a minion
---
You joke but Blizz will do this lol. Give it a year or two
---
I liked it, but single target removal was just so strong. You could win or lose based on who drew more of it
---
Now that we are talking about fair gameplay and nerfs topics: What is your favourite champion to play during URF and which one would you permaban?
---
What if...and I'll admit this is a pretty farfetched idea...instead of nerfing staple cards into oblivion, Blizzard just made new cards tg at *aren't* hot garbage? 
---
What part of this confuses you?
---
What is the problem here?
---
IMO DK Rexxar was one of the greatest designed card when it wasn't as oppresive as it is today. It wasn't even the best dk card at the time (priest).
---
Look at the art, they look like the same troll
---
Unpopular opinion here, It can be that the redditor who thought spell hunter was really bad was stuck in a meta pocket that was countering spell hunter (it is the easiest hunter deck to target as it has problems finding that last bit of damage). 
---
So if someone who doesnt grind HS, losing 5-6 games in a row is enough to make them think the deck is super bad and make them unlikely to play. While it wasnt nice of the redditor to blame the whole system for their poor ladder performance. I can see where that kind of thinking comes from. Most of the ladder players maybe play 5-6 games a day. 
---
I'd love to see the faces of the hunter players when this goes live.
---
Happy Lunar New Year!
---
should have done it pre giggling inventor nerf. 2 coldlight oracle, 1x hozen healer, sonya shadowdancer, 2x lab recruiters, rest any spells. If rng would blessed you and lich king doesn't spawn any taunts: scaled nightmare too, otherwise you would be sitting there for 30+ minutes of juggling annoytron,coldlight oracle, hozen healer and lab recruiters. https://hsreplay.net/replay/wa7pQMF5zes8SRZUe6TCt5 gosh, possibly most boring game i have ever played in hearthstone.
---
If you draw crap off of the button then it’s 2 mana deal 2 damage to your face and nothing else. Hemet prevents that outcome while also being a decent body for his cost 
---
I do usually just open up the game to play some matches for fun, but take the daily quest into account when selecting witch deck to play. So for example if I have a "win as paladin" quest I will play some matches as paladin
---
For every nerf of a class card, they should buff a card from that class. It's not fair that they keep driving classic into the ground.
---
Username checks out?
---
I don't think they're waiting with the announcements, so the only thing they could do is wait longer until the nerfs go live. But if there's a long time between announcement and nerf, then people stop playing because it's even more annoying to lose to cards that you already know are getting the nerf bat.
---
That being said I wouldn't call slow paladin decks dead just yet.
---
How do you imagine this would work? Someone's always gonna have crafted decks that will be hit by nerfs no matter when they announce them.
---
yea definitely, i only play shadowverse and MTGarena now. both are fun in their own ways.
---
nozdormu wouldn't matter if they fixed the general bug of animations bleeding into the opponent's turn timer. if a company with millions of dollars of budget and the ability to recruit the best coders in the world is unable to code a two player turn-based game timer in FOUR YEARS then they're either weasels or incompetent.  
---
"I'm not incompetent!" shouted the pointy-haired boss to Dilbert, slamming his fist on the table.
---
That's a funny way to spell mistake
---
Bow down to the god of death
---
Kripp is far from the only one. The great e-sports superstar Ryan "Northern (Lion)" Letoureau and his fellowship of the NLSS are also amongst the rare breed of actually nice streamers.
---
Just waiting for someone to coin pyro now
---
Could still be recruited, how about oooooooooopps accidentally deleted king krush from the game whoops my bad
---
&gt; Wild Growth &amp; Nourish (December 2018): Totally gimped.
---
Sees play in Malygos Druid. Going from 100% in Druid decks to not 100% doesn't automatically mean they were gimped.
---
Yes, they are *way* weaker now. As is fine, because Wild Growth was busted at 2 Mana.
---
This is right after the nerf, too. Of course, Wild Growth and Nourish are going to stay in Standard post-rotation, so let's see what ends up happening then as well.
---
&gt; but their recent treatment of basic and classic cards in particular is extremely heavy-handed and has far too many collateral effects on Wild.
---
I honestly don't think so.
---
Wild Growth and Nourish nerfs were fine, imo.
---
Mana Wyrm nerf killed it, that's for sure. But... with the design of Mana Wyrm? I don't mind it being "killed." The design of a Turn 1 snowballer is quite toxic, and killing the card has a *positive* collateral effect on Wild if you ask me.
---
&gt; Just straight nerfs without even an attempt to rebalance cards in the oldest HS sets,
---
Nerfs are attempts to rebalance?
---
Nerfs are better than buffs in general, because with a buff you know exactly what card is going to see more play. It's immediately obvious. But lowering the power level of a prominent card means that what ends up making headway into the meta is not as immediately obvious.
---
&gt; I'm not going to support the 'opening up of design space' in standard by devaluing the experience of wild and utterly gimping the basic/classic sets.
---
Nerfing Classic/Basic cards is not a terribly bad thing for Wild either. Yes, it can weaken or even invalidate some long-standing strategies and decks in Wild, but take the Flametongue Totem nerf. Wild Even Shaman is apparently one Hell of a big deal right now, and simply rotating Flametongue Totem wouldn't make a difference for Wild.
---
Plus, weakening Equality and Hunter's Mark is A okay. They were exceptional value-for-cost, so much so that doubling their Cost is something I don't think makes them obsolete. I also don't think this "devalues the Wild experience." Maybe one day they'll do a format that rolls back balance changes or something, but more than that I'd much rather they focus on other types of formats first. Like the Tavern Brawl that excluded Classic/Basic cards, or a Pauper format.
---
But for now I like that they're hitting some big cards in the Classic and Basic sets. I don't think they should nerf ad infinitum, I think that they should show a preference to rotation when they can help it. But with Hunter's Mark and Equality especially, I am happy they got nerfed because they are just *that* high value.
---
But cards like Frostbolt, Fireball, Flamestrike, Power Word: Shield, Northshire Cleric, Preparation, SI:7 Agent, and Shield Slam? They could all stand to be rotated, eventually.
---
Oh, and Consecration and Truesilver Champion if we're looking at Paladin cards.
---
Wild Pyromancer and Acolyte of Pain are good cards to rotate as well.
---
But yeah in general I see no problem with nerfing cards. In Classic/Basic, there is the concern about new, returning, and low-budget players. But I think there's only so much they can do to focus on that when they already have the Standard rotation, and is why I think if you want to address players with reduced accessibility to the game, you do it with a new format instead of worrying too much about how you balance the game.
---
After all it is abundantly clear that Standard takes precedence over Wild and the Arena when it comes to balancing cards and what-not. It is *the* main format. I'm not saying "don't care about Wild," but I am saying that Wild doesn't automatically suffer whenever you nerf a card in Standard that Wild also uses. Does 4 Mana Equality kill a Wild Paladin deck, or just weaken it?
---
Flametongue Totem's nerf may certainly do a lot of harm to Wild Even Shaman, but assuming what Wild players have told me is true about the deck and its dominance, that nerf is a *good* thing, and rotating Flametongue Totem would have been worse for Wild.
---
&gt;Here is my view:
---
&gt;&gt;Your post is about how redditors are inconsistent and self-interested to the point of hypocrisy.
---
Hmm ok so before we "move on" do I get an apology for your first outlandish statement? 
---
&gt;Every thread I see you in, you're complaining about reddit as if you think all redditors are incapable of coherent thought.
---
I mean after all that is what kicked this whole meta debate off that you failed on numerous occasions to support or justify and instead went off on another tangent entirely.  You even goes as far as to wonder why I don't address these future allegations when you have yet to address this simple opening statement of yours.  
---
&gt;You did, when you said:
---
&gt;&gt;Which, again, seem to situate a discussion of the dust economy as useless, since Blizzard are the ones who can actually effect a change.  
---
&gt;Correct Blizzard are the ones who can effect change.  
---
I think that is fairly obvious I'm agreeing with the fact that Blizzard can effect change as opposed to anything being "useless".  
---
I mean literally said exactly what I said yet you want to try bend this into something else?  
---
&gt;Given that your initial claim was that "no one seems to have a better solution", it would be warranted to admit that you've changed from this stance.   
---
Let's not cherry pick your own statement now.  
---
Let's include full context:
---
&gt;The same responses given then are still valid now I would think - they cant very well offer full dust refund for a whole deck and no one seems to have a better solution.  
---
At the time I posted that no one indeed has a better solution.  Has my stance changed on this?  I wouldn't be opposed to the initial solution there at all of course but the fact remains it's Blizzard that need convincing, not me and not any ragey poster on this sub.  
---
Have I seen a solution that I feel if I were in Blizzards shoes I would be interested in? Not so far no because as I've pointed out before money talks.  
---
Which leads too ...
---
&gt;Simply not giving Blizzard money is meaningless if you don't also make it clear why you aren't giving them money.  
---
Fair enough but people crying on reddit and still forking over money because "ooo look a special bundle deal" or "better but this expansion" makes all that crying meaningless if their metrics tell them "you did good, you met budget".  
---
When they fail to meet budget that's when they look back on feedback I would imagine.  
---
Take htat a step further ... RR failed to meet expectations and what happened? Feedback dictated /r/fuckdruid and druid got fucked ... still not getting there and feedback was now /r/fuckhunter and lo and behold hunter got fucked.  
---
Granted others too got fucked along the way and Blizzard did it in the most greedy way possible it would seem but thats what the overwhelming feedback told them.  
---
There were no abundance of threads standing up for our fellow players who got fucked over in the previous nerfs, if anything it was people laughing at the druids that got screwed etc. 
---
When that seems to be the jist of the previous nerfs and "yay no more druid" it's not overly surprising that Blizzard continued down this path.  
---
My hope is posts like mine as unliked as they may be might actually wake people the fuck up and have them think before they react and post to enrfs in the future knowing damn well what happens to others can happen to them.  
---
This time around seems more positive so if we can all keep this trend up then perhaps we will actually see change from Blizzard to this insidious dust system or at the very least a more fair nerf system.  
---
Also, Molten Giant synergy with Flame Imp dealing 29 damage,  I would bump it to 4 mana instead.

Ah ok. Is there any reason for retiring at 11-2? Better reward compare to losing 11-3?
---
&gt;:(
---
So can I resurrect myself as Jaraxxus with Bloodreaver Gul'dan after I have died?
---
that’s not the point. Priest never gets touched. How many shaman decks were t1 for the last 3 expansions? 1? 2?
---
Shaman is getting fucked. 
---
Druid was wiped off the face of the earth. 
---
yet priest is basically what Druid was I hate it. 
---
But we could limit it so we can't search certain cards like leeroy or lich king so it wouldnt be too powerfull?  
---
Let's begin with point one.  F2p players don't actually provide anything to this game or format unless they spend money on the game,  therefore not being f2p anymore. 
---
This sub is full of entitled idiots who want everything for free.. when I queue vs sometime I don't question if they're f2p or p2p. They're just an opponent,  don't be dense yourself. 
---
Are point 1.  The game is f2p to get people hooked on the playability to have them buy packs, look how artifact failed.. who wants to buy a game and packs? Absolutely no one.   So it's not technically f2p, but you fo have the opportunity to make it possible through endless grind. 
---
Artifact is exactly the opposite of everything im saying.   All tcgs are costly to keep up with the meta and keep up with the game,  mtg,  you gi oh, pokemon,  hearthstone,  doesn't matter the game.  Artifact bomb because it was too greedy,  with a shitty design.   It didn't bomb because it didn't have f2p players lmao, the game was awful,  with 0 depth.. on top of that they wanted you to buy the game and buy packs.. you see the difference or need me to spell it out for you?  This is pretty simple,  hearthstone does x amount if expansions a year,  they want you to spend 50 bucks in presales for new cards.   And spend more in packs too.. that's just the way it is,  they give you the opportunity to grind all of that without spending a cent in the game, but you as a player don't help the developers or help the game at all,  you're useless,  just another player.   So stop your idiotic rant.. the game doesn't gain anything from f2p players,  and the moment you spend any money on the game you are no longer f2p.  They got money off you and you fell for the system they designed.   
---
I suppose it depends on how generic it is, something like search a taunt would be too good imo without a huge drawback but it could maybe work under some circumstances.
---
Seems like they really hate classic
---
I think Shadowreaper Anduin is overtuned and would probably be more balanced at 9 or even 10 mana, but the concept behind him is one of the best in the Death Knights. He doesn't provide infinite value, but instead the ability to switch to an incredibly offensive glass cannon style from an incredibly defensive class as a finisher. 
---
I recall Evenlock cutting Guldan for faster cards. Wild has more "game-ending" cards and grinding people out is harder.
---
ofcourse search a taunt is too big, but that doesnt mean a taunt searcher cant be balanced, make sure it costs under a certain threshold or make it unplayable for 1 turn etc. 
---
My 12/25 minion can be destroyed anyway 
---
this brawl sucks
---
It is a really good game tbf.
---
What would it look like if you have more than 4 different options in your deck? Is it templated like discover? 
---
Blizzard won't do this, too hard for New Players to tutor correctly
---
Yep, that seems like a good idea. Since Animal Companion costs 3 mana, it should also only spawn 3 mana minions. Don't remove the randomness though, need that design space.
---
Yeah but it is a 10 mana card. Hearthstone need more impactful late-game cards like this. 
---
I mean, DK's, even in wild are still pretty fucking crazy. Many of the best decks utilize DK's as a lategame wincondition, and decks with "infinite value" are actually pretty uncommon. The only deck with value like that is just Jade Druid, and post wg and nourish nerfs is just not a great deck.
---
So yeah, basically the DK's that see play are the premier form of value generation in Wild, and if not that at least on par with some of the stronger value generation/lategame winconditons in wild.
---
That's a very cool idea!
---
Thanks, finally a reasonable answer!
---
That ping is gonna lose the game Kappa
---
Aggro decks often run out of cards quickly, but odd paladin found a way around that. The hero power mitigates their card expenditure. If they play 3 cards so quickly that hurts them. 
---
I didn't set out to obliterate these two legendaries just weaken them.
---
1 mana more, but with an overload of one. (On any class that doesn’t have access to beneficial overload mechanics, this is half a mana per turn)

---
Why are you woooshing? Do you actually believe that he thinks that galaxy is real and we’ll all die if he drops it. 
---
If you purely rely on board clears to control the board, you should have more. Rogue and Druid rely on proactive play and stall respectively. And yes, Hunter is a soft counter. Doesn't make it uncounterable.
---
You’ve been playing for less than a year, like everyone’s entitled to there own opinion but shamanstone rules wild like it did in before and during mean streets meta. 
---
Coldblood was just dumb aggro attack stats and combo activator for so little mana. 
---
And like equality is just so strong at 2 mana maybe paladin should use a new boardclear after 5 years
---
&gt; Wild Growth is NOT busted at 2 mana in Wild 
---
You get it Turn 2, your win rate is ludicrously higher than when you don't.
---
That's not particularly fun design. Granted, it's also a natural way that ramp works in card games, but it is what it is. 
---
&gt; WG being 3 mana makes it inferior to Jade Blossom in almost every use case regardless of what kind of druid deck you run in wild.
---
And that's okay. I don't think this is inherently problematic. This is *especially* because Jade Blossom is 80 dust for two copies. 80 dust is a lot to low-budget players, sure, but given that Jade Blossom is a 1/1 and 2/2 in exchange for drawing a card at 10 Mana, it's an investment you can consider skipping if you want.
---
&gt; In wild however, highlander mage builds are a lot stronger than aggro/tempo/burn mage. 
---
Right, so let's just forget that new cards get printed every 4 months and if Aggro Mage ends up becoming more prominent, you're going to be running Mana Wyrm every time at 1 Mana.
---
&gt; The weaker you make the basic/classic set, the more similar standard and wild will become.
---
How does that make any sense?
---
Classic/Basic belongs to both Wild and Standard. The weaker it is, the less influence it has, which gives more leeway to Wild and its Wild-exclusive card sets to show themselves.
---
On the contrary, the more you nerf *any* Standard-viable card, the better it is for Wild. Because it means that of their prodigious pool of cards that Wild has, each option looks more and more lucrative. 
---
&gt; In wild, a lot of players don't look at that kind of 'staleness' and have a preference for their cards (especially the basic/classic core) to be consistent across time because it reduces deckbuilding costs and doesn't pressure you to constantly get the new sets.
---
Okay.
---
So from a purely financial/company standpoint, this is not something you'd care to look out for compared to alternative demographics, such as people who enjoy Wild but don't want it to be stale.
---
And frankly, that's probably bottom priority. Wild is not "stale" whether you like it or not. It gets a card set every 4 months, and you can't go back to Handlock "like it used to be" with Hero Cards and Even/Odd decks in the mix. Wild is not a format that enables any kind of time travel. It is not built for that.
---
And I say retaining that kind of staleness is probably bottom priority for the simple reason that of all the things you'd want to tackle as a developer, ensuring staleness is not one of them. If the third format added to Constructed was one like that, it would be a waste. Pauper would be far, far, far better. Or one akin to the Tavern Brawl.
---
&gt; There, a strong base set leads to consistency of experience across time and lowers the barrier to entry for people to play in the format!
---
Hence why if you want consistency across time and a low barrier for entry, a new format is a much better idea. Wild is "Wild!" It doesn't sound stale. It wasn't necessarily built for stale, unless you're talking about the span of decades.
---
&gt; and it is not ok that, as you put it, "Standard takes precedence over Wild and the Arena". THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE! There are so many suggestions for ways to structure the game to prevent this forced interlinking!
---
And a huge slew of those suggestions are bad.
---
It's not impossible, but the more you try and reduce interlinking between them, the more complicated Hearthstone gets. And that goes against the spirit of the game and how it's intended to be sold to audiences. It's meant to come off as accessible. Strain too hard to individualise each format with the same cards that have different stats or text and what-not and suddenly the game seems more complicated.
---
A kind of thing that people really undersell in these conversations, and no, it doesn't take a Wild player to see that.
---
In the end if we're ever going to consider some kind of balance change rollback, it just seems like a noncommittal way of making Wild confusing for little benefit. Again, Wild is not built for that.
---
If you're going to do balance change rollbacks, make a "Timeway" Format that rolls back balance changes *and card sets* so you have access to specific metagames. You say Wild is doing the job of both Vintage and Legacy formats in MTG.
---
So you have to realise how unsustainable that is.
---
A true "Legacy" format could include the banning of cards, or selective nerfs restricted to only that format. "Problem" Legendaries like Highlander Legends, Baku, Genn, and Hero Cards could be disabled from the format entirely. Take it a step further and you can disable infinite resource generation like Jade Idol (or change Jade Idol to only summon a Jade Golem) and Dead Man's Hand.
---
But Wild is just Vintage, and given Team 5's reluctance to ban cards (exceptions being Tavern Brawl and Arena) and the unlikeliness that they're willing to make Flametongue 2 Mana here and 3 Mana there, or Wild Growth 2 Mana here and 3 Mana there, you're not going to get the same balancing act there as in Magic: The Gathering.
---
Anyway, the "what may or may not be good for Wild" debate stems from personal opinion. You evidently value staleness more. Good for you, that doesn't mean you're wrong, nor does it mean you're right. Don't act like playing Wild is a necessity to have an opinion. You can learn a lot just by being observant and getting feedback from other people.
---
Like, you know, I'm doing now with you.
---
For the sake of Wild balance, yes. I'm also of the opinion that the core set should have cards that rotate in and out according to the Standard pool. This would solve the problem of Priest not needing to have a new board clear printed every year, while actually allowing some constraints if such card becomes too powerful on a specific metagame.
---
How have the learn from past mistake when they made a stronger Yogg? First it was Shudderwock then Zuljin.
---
Playing cards quickly does weaken them, but again these decks found ways to get around it. Divine favor and  Myra's Unstable Element both make for excellent draw options.

I'll take the Rexxars and Jainas over Zuljin and Hagathas. Rexxar and Jaina only became a problem when Aggro and Midrange were nerfed and slowed so much that the DK's tempo loss was nothing and the button could be safely smashed 10 times.
---
People forget Rexxar used to be a suboptimal fun card. The meta changed to make him and Jaina very good.
---
Yeah need a "friend" to play with, Eroz0105#2803

Yeah, I meant on ladder since that is where people play who care about deck cost.
---
I'm also not just talking about the meta right now. The point is they nerfed that deck, everybody cried because they just crafted it to ladder with, but it turns out it still works.
---
If you want a tournament deck example, they nerfed Quest Rogue how often now and it's still played with great success in tournaments...

---
A card that lets you search Barnes can still be designed so it doesn't work so well in a Barnes deck, e.g. Wild hunter decks with Barnes don't play Stitched Tracker even though it *would* be a way to search for a copy of Barnes in that deck.
---

Am I the only one who doesn't understand the hate for the Equality nerf? That and Spellstone were the only two cards from the recent nerfs that I actually felt like deserved nerfs.

And a poor hero portrait at that.  A plain blue background cropped so you can't even see he's missing an arm.  Imo the voice acting is bad too.  He doesn't even sound like a troll.

I sorry you feel that way. As the dissenting opinion, if you have the time of course, could you provide some constructive feedback on what you didn't like or what made it terrible in your eyes?

Zul'jin is more consistent, but his ceiling is far, far lower.
---
Yogg could win the game on the spot from a board state where by all means, the player should lose.
---
Zul'jin will build a board that gets demolished by four mana board sweeping effects. Classes that can deal with it would be the following: Mage, Warrior, Paladin, Warlock, Priest, Shaman, and to some extent Druid. Other Hunters and Rogues would have to be a bit more proactive towards dealing with it, but Emerald Spellstone, the proper source of most of your frustration with the class, is both getting changed and leaving Standard in two months.
---
Zul'jin is Yogg done right.
---
It's a shame that we have to use this kind of tools for something that should be included in the base game. Great work, love the style and design! ^shame ^on ^u ^blizz
---
Yeah, there are so many things that would be great to have from the start.  
---
The good point is, we can add whatever achievements we like, without needing to wait for Blizzard now :)
---
HS has been down the shitter for quite some time now, but asking Blizzard to keep Wild even somewhat balanced seems unreasonable. That game mode is for veteran players who have the luxury of owning a huge collection and want to experiment with crazy interactions between legacy sets. 99% of HS' playerbase doesn't give a shit about Wild and are glad to dust old sets for new cards to spent the least amount of money possible. I mean, what do you expect from a game mode that's literally called "Wild"?
---
Actually it won't be less packs if you want a full collection. 
---
Spell Zul'jin isn't as common the last couple weeks so maybe not anymore but Animal Companion, To My Side, random traps from Secret Plan, Wandering Monster, Deadly Shot. When Zul'jin is used you're also having to dodge Hunter's Marks, Flanking and Baited Shots.
---
Individually those cards aren't that annoying and the RNG isn't awful and there's strategy for using the randomness to your favor, your opponent can play around them, etc. But in decks like Spell Hunter the goal isn't really to use those cards optimally, it's about dumping your hand as fast as possible and leaving your opponent to deal with everything as it comes out.
---
The reason you're dumping your hand is so you can get maximum value from Zul'jin and Rhok'Delar (another RNG card), and Rexxar takes care of the late game. So you're getting max casts from Zul'jin - I've seen and been in plenty of games where multiple things just happened to land multiple times in the re-cast. Spell Hunter was top tier for a reason and it wasn't just because of the Spell Stone.
---
Granted I do see more mid-range beast decks now and Zul'jin isn't much of an issue in that because, like in line with what you said, it's mostly about flooding the board through re-casting Master's Call, Spell Stone, Animal Companion.
---
Time out is more Frost Nova than Ice Block.

Congrats! I just got mine a couple weeks ago. Warrior was the hardest for me. I built a mechathun warrior deck with keening banshees to burn through the deck super quickly, and i had the combo one turn away several times, but it was just so frustrating i finally gave up on that strategy and went with the alarm-o-bot and all giant minions strategy, which eventually worked. What was your hardest class?

As a warlock main I hate that card so much.

Tomorrow at least half of those should be replaced with odd paladins
---
In magic, most of the search cards (tutors) are banned in every competitive format, and the ones that aren't are new ones with prohibitively high costs or a few that get less important types and only put them on the top of your deck (so you have to draw a card to get it right away or wait a turn to draw it).
---
this isnt a fucking showerthought. this is PSA all over again
---
Even if you net deck, you can end up crafting a deck that 1)  Strong, but insanely boring to play    2) Fall out of favor 2 weeks later due to meta shift.
---
Nowadays, I just craft a cheap aggro to climb to rank 5 in 10-15 matches, then play some meme homebrew/meme decks for the rest of the months.  I don't have the dusts to really play anything else, or follow the ever changing meta.

I like two just for the consistency of getting one early on, but it does tend to be the case that you don’t really want to play it after completing the quest unless you’re searching for a Tundra Rhino to pair with your raptors. I think it’s worth trying out with just one, but if you don’t draw that, Halazzi, or Subject 9, you’d be in a tough spot.

---
Very nice idea and decklist, but have you tried replacing one candleshot with a springpaw? It has the same usage and although inferior, it activates the quest when Halazzi whiffs due to things like Subject 9 or Master's call filling up the hand, and it wont usually disturb the Master's call draw 3 beasts as either S9, Halazzi or the springpaw would almost be guaranteed to be drawn before the first master's call.
---
This leads me to believe that you didn't even bother to actually read the article.
---
The script you quoted was lifted directly from the excerpt referring to the hunter nerfs. Which is taking it out of context.
---
Furthermore, blaming Genn and Baku is not unfounded. It was specifically stated before that cards like Call to Arms, Level Up! and Giggling Inventor had their manacosts adapted exactly in the way they did, exactly because of the two legendaries. So an outright denial is hard to accept when you factor in context. That is the argument. It's really easy to understand.
---
Also the comment above was referring to "new substance" and not just substance in general.
---
Honestly the way you take things out of context just to support your points just weakens them.
---
Regardless, thank you for your comments.
---
It could certainly be 'balanced', but I'm not sure it would be good for the game.  As a veteran of a game that used this mechanic extensively (Star Trek CCG) it makes decks too consistent and every game play out the same - basically the exact issue a lot of people are already having with Hearthstone at the moment with Genn, Baku, Recruit etc.
---
Baku is the problem
---
You guys have too much faith on the company that took years to make more than 9 deckslots (2016) and now they have stopped on 18. Even some nerfs (fiery war axe) were justified by saying that its simpler to have the mana increased so players can identify the change easily.

I know that there are many games that can do it, but I dont think blizzard wants to do it.

Well it's not a problem if it's a otk meta. But he is a counter to control decks, and with access to too many board clears, they also beat up agro and midrange decks. Only hyper agro would beat them but you know that archetype is dead now except mech hunter.

Noooooo

Don't craft whizbang thats bad advice.

Classic is not completely annihilated; last I saw an HSReplay report on set popularity, Classic+Basic was almost 40% of cards played in the meta.

We’ll see how high that is after the nerfs, but I’m guessing it’ll still be the strongest set in the entire game so....

UI, a partnership with a Chinese company, and mobile accessibility are cornerstones of success.

It’s easy to watch and understand, you can bring the game with you anywhere you have an internet connection, and it has had almost no competition.

Awesome! Thank you so much!

It does seem to be missing the Classic and Basic set though (Outside of those Hall of Famed, and some early ones under the Artwork tab). Thankfully I only wanted Rag from those, but for future reference do you know where those might be located? Or if I'm missing them in that link?

---
This subreddit just really likes to complain. 
---
Next rotation (April) will be really important for the game. We just had a powerlevel reset year so the cards of this year didn't see much play so far. 
---
Next year could be really good if they balance bakus synergys correctly . (Also i like this meta, many fun decks)
---
Here's the golden strategy when it comes to maximizing your card value.
---
Step 1: Buy the Welcome Bundle. It's the most value you'll get on card packs and the Classic Set is relatively evergreen. 
---
Step 2: Wait until early April when the End of Year Rotation occurs. 3 sets will be rotating out of standard and a new expansion will be added into the game. This is the best time to get invested into the game and if you want to spend more money, buy the Pre-Order Bundle for that new set when it comes out (ask your friends first tho, because it may be garbage). 
---
Step 3: If you REALLY want to buy cards now, start by getting packs from The Witchwood expansion. Open packs until you get a Legendary from that set, then do the same thing for The Boomsday Project and then Rastakhan's Rumble. You are guaranteed to get a Legendary card in your first 10 packs of every expansion, so this is the best way to maximize your dust value. 
---
Step 4: Look up budget decks on hearthstonetopdecks.com, I recommend making a Midrange Hunter deck or a Zoo Warlock deck, since those are archetypes that have always existed and will most likely exist for the eternity of this game. Spend your dust on one of these cheap decks and climb as high as you can to get the best end of season rewards while you slowly build up enough dust to craft the deck you want to play. 
---
6 expansions per year and 2 month seasons
---
I think everytime you level up a class you should get 10 free packs and a golden legendary.  
---
4 unique espionage before i had any extra card draw played, tess drew another 5 each time she was played

I like how you nerf Eaglehorn is the same rationality they had when they nerfed it the first time...
---
Leaving HS just might bring tou that exact thing. Think about it.
---
so even shaman?
---
get 10k armor and win by fatigue
---
If Whizbang rotates then you wont be able to use him in standard?  sad
---
*unpopular opinion*
---
oof
---
It used to be fine when priest focus was creating board with high health minions.
---
Now that maintaining boards and minions no longer matter for priest it's fallen out of favor.
---
Don't forget Value APM Priest. 
---
(Test subject -&gt; 2x Binding Heal -&gt; 2x Regenerate -&gt; Seance -&gt; Topsy Turvy = heal face for 10 and spawn 2 5/5 dragons with the priest weapon for 5 mana, and you get all the spells back)
---
&gt;that can go in to just about any deck?
---
well no because millhouse sabotages just about any deck rather than making it better.
---
Did you guys know that the taunt shaman totem isn’t a snake?
---
The real reason he should go to classic is because the decks he gives you are all standard. Nobody wants to use a standard deck in wild.

Richurdt#2596 EU - 80g Friend Quest to share. You go first! 
---
Why?
---
How about you do some research or look on the subreddit before posting this?
---
Is it weird that Even Mage and Quest Hunter are my two off meta decks... Uncanny
---
&gt;  I could’ve spent it on something better 
---
I think they word you are looking for is *flashier,* not better. Zilliax is one of the best cards in the game, period. 
---
Search for a minion and silence it will still get taken advantage of with stuff like Ancient Watcher or Humongous Razorleaf, if Purify is any indication. 
---
I don't think we're going to get anything more than Stitched Tracker or Recruit when it comes to pulling stuff from your deck just with how difficult it would probably end up being to balance. They want us to at least try to build around that sort of thing a la Possessed Lackey or Master's Call.
---
&gt;if you're debating
---
Nothing, get out while you still can.
---
On a more serious note, welcome/lunar bundles. :)
---
Ah good old Shaman tier, TGT was when shaman started to get the good stuff (Golum and tuskar) and in the space of 3 expansion it when from dumpster to dominating the game, shockingly if you do nothing but give a class great cards eventually they become broken stupid good.
---
Fun fact: after achieving the first 5 digits I realized I was 4 arena wins away from aligning the stars, and decided I might as well go for it.
---
Ended up going 1-3 3 times in a row. 🤦‍♂️
---
Pirate warrior,
---
Seen it, Lost to it, bad memories came back i tell ya.
---
Absolutely 100% thats makes smurf playable
---
I really don't get why people keep saying they wont understand it. I mean, sure, they might be a tad bit confused the first two or three games, but every single keyword has an explanation when hovering over the card. I feel like everybody says they'll be completely fucked and roll around like small puppies, but I can't imagine the larger playbase would be THAT fucked with the decks.
---
Screech!
---
Just pick oakheart. 
---
Because people here said pally would be totally unusable, completely and utterly dead outside of odd pally.

I'm at 190-200 teams beaten and I've won with 6 shrines: mage (spell damage and hero power), warrior (armor), paladin (deal 5 when damaged), hunter (secrets), warlock (opponents take the damage on your turn)
---
I really enjoyed the warrior armor run, makes sense because I like playing controlly warrior decks. Best moment was overkilling the last boss by 40, because my shrine was too strong. 
---
Wild was always intended to be the screw balance game mode.
---
Never said he didn’t enjoy doing that.
---
I recently got my easiest 12 win run ever, and that in my only run of the year so far. So I made different experiences.
---
Just played a somewhat fast midrange pali, and games were over turn 7 it was laughable. I even misplayed multiple times and never got punished.
---
Kinda interesting, RDU usually has a pretty definitive opinion on things, but here he is saying Kibler's view that the classic set should be rotated has merit and is unsure whether that is the best approach going forward since hes a player and not a game designer.  
---
I think the actual nerfs are somewhat small peanuts compared to the over philosophy towards the basic/classic sets going forward. I wonder if there is actually merit to Blizzard trickle-nerfing the classic/basic set if it means we'll get more nerfs (and rapidly changing metas)  
---
It's definitely weak. Having to draw two cards for one removal is a big annoyance. Keep in mind that cataclysm is rarely used except in situations where you don't have any useful cards in your hand, or in mecha'thun decks. The same with twisting nether; it's quite effective when you can afford to lose your minions but your opponent can't. 
---
At that point, you might as well just create two new cards
---
Dying games require extreme measures to survive 
---
Explore Un’Goro
---
Honestly my new player experience had alot of shitty experimentation, never getting past r16 and losing to jade druid, when I finally started to netdeck some good decks it just made the experience alot better for me.
---
I don't know
---
I did it with bunny rogue and imortal Prelate paladin
---
*Sizzlebang the Sufficient*
---
I mean it's game 1. Not like you stand to lose much but I'd probably go Millhouse either way. The AI is pretty irresponsible with cheap spells.
---
They're only trash because they weren't made for you, a well established Hearthstone player.
---
Those cards exist currently to allow new players to experience more cards without necessarily needing to have more cards.
---
Hey, I'm on board with you.  Until Blizzard says "yes, we'll move Whizbang to Classic", there's no way to know we've achieved our goal.
---
Why not?
---
Well, did you win? Did you go 12-2?
---
Maybe after beat all classes on expert mode, at least with it the player will know a bit more every class
---
For starters, year of the mammoth was extremely OP, so most classes are still using their cards from last year and from classic.  No class got a ton of stuff able to match that power level in the past year.
---
But you’re also wrong anyway.
---
Rogue got Hench Clan Thug and Baku from The Witchwood.  Both neutral cards but cards that just work way better in Rogue than any/most other classes.  Cutthroat Buckaneer has also made its way into Kingsbane decks.
---
Rogue also got Necrium Blade and Necrium Vial from Boomsday, which are very strong cards.  I use them in wild.  Also Academic Espionage, which is...mostly a meme, but it’s a pretty strong meme.  Also Lab Recruiter which has seen plenty of play in standard and wild.  Also Toxicologist which is another neutral card that might as well be a Rogue class card.  Blightnozzle Crawler is niche but has uses; I spoke to someone who ran them in their wild big rogue as an answer to 4 mana 7/7s.
---
Rogue also got Walk the Plank from Rhastakan Rumble, which is a very good card; some decks prefer Vilespine, but miracle for example prefers walk.  Spirit of the Shark is also making its way into Tempo Rogue.  Sharkfin Fan is another one of those neutral cards that might as well be a rogue card.  And Captain Hooktusk has a ridiculously high individual card winrate even if you need to include some sketchy pirates in order to run her.  Banana Buffoon also makes its way into Rogue sometimes, I assume to give spells to miracle rogue for auctioneer and to make some enormous Van Cleefs.
---
So no, it’s more than one card per expansion.
---
No hate against the players that are actually nice, but from my experience anyone that is playing a fun meme deck (and you yourself are playing a fun deck) accepts friendrequests and are nice but people that play tier 1 decks are usually salty pieces of shit that only trashtalk when you send a friendrequest.
---
Looks like they might be studying forensics or something..
---
Nah u earn em.
---
No.
---
At first I thought this was another post from someone about the boss that makes all spells have echo XD
---
If they announce it now, people can stop making these damn threads :)
---
I recall either reading it or watching somewhere that being said.
---
you miss all the draw. No master's call or Subject 9
---
Congrats on your impending ban.
---
Yeah that's honestly how the meta looks right now. 
---
With Rogue is especially tricky, I probably would try to fit a Prep and vanish, just for big priest. 
---
I don't recommend the DK since you don't really have time to play it and when you do, it floods your hands and makes the combo that much harder. 
---
Perhaps you could try running a Sludge Belcher. No other changes come to mind tbh, I think it's a good tier 3-4 deck right now, used to be much better before mech hunter honestly. It's also quite polished so it's hard to come up with changes. 
---
Leeroy is always ALWAYS a solid pick. But it depends on what you're going to want. Rotface is good if you get Warpath. And The Boomship is a decent late game card if you have a bunch of high cost minions.
---
Should have saved your quests for tomorrow.
---
Rotface and go for an extreme late game value deck or draft 7 Dragon Roars and pick Boomship.
---
Leoric#1627, I will show quest and you go first.
---
Kingsbane Rogue was about to be busted right before the nerf.
---
But blame Quest Rogue and old Pirate Rogue. Anytime a class dominates, the devs compensate by going wide. Old decks get almost no tools and new deck themes are focused on (even if they suck).
---
That would be awful to play with and against. It would at least need to be reciprocal and cost at least two more, perhaps with a modest boost in stats along with it.
---
CrunchTime#1623 - NA - 80g quest - you go first. I have done many of these on here! Thanks.
---
Says the man playing Whizbang.
---
You are spot on
---
Walk the plank is also a functional card even if it doesnt see much use.. the spirits are pretty strong, gral is not so shabby
---
I really think the OP is way off the mark here
---
The biggest issue for rogue is many of its basic cards are so strong decks dont often feel so different, but rogue has a lot going for it imo
---
Leeroy isn't great in Arena
---
The Boomship could end up accidentally three left over one drops
---
Rotface played on an empty board could quite easily summon a couple before it dies.
---
Yea, because [[Raza the Chained]] and [[Justicar Trueheart]] are really oppressive! ^^/s
---
Then there'd be someone to complain about it somehow.
---

What is wrong with whizbang?
---
Hello guys. Since I'm terrible at math, can anyone tell what are the odds of this happening? Thanks in advance!
---
Was just joking.
---
Tinkmaster overspark imo
---
can you give me an estimate when i can expect the 67890 screenshot?
---
What they're saying is it allows you to spend one card... And draw two new cards! 
---
Eternal's not the best example, considering that they released within the last few expansions creatures that allow you to switch a card in your hand with a card in a special 5 card "market" that you make beforehand(basically tutoring), and they have basically centralized the game around them and effects that synergize with them.
---
You never used broth
---
I've tried recruit, explore un'goro, geist so far. I guess I have to be lucky to pull that off
---
Classic set by a mile. New expansions have been so weak that there’s no point in buying new packs. I almost always buy KnC or KotFT packs tho but classic is way better than the shit we’ve been getting lately
---
Just funny how even with no chat, muting emotes, and no other form of communication they still find a way to be toxic, but yeah I agree with you
---
exactly
---
To be nice
---
He is
---
I love the idea but there is always the fact that you kind of already do. If you do some basic achievements etc u can build up enough dust for him in an hour or two of playing.
---
1. Teams defeated: 22
---
2. Runs completed: 1
---
3. Shrines completed: The Mage one that let you use HP if it defeats a minion
---
4. Most enjoyed: The only one I completed, with insane Inspire +30 spell power and 6 Arcane Missiles in hand.
---
Rumble Run is the PvE mode I've enjoyed least, compared to over 1600/25 wins in DR and 200/3 wins in MH. But the fact the game doesn't let you pick classes or shrines, or even let's you track class and shrine wins, I have zero interest in replaying it... ever. I'll take my cheap card back and keep replaying Dungeon Runs.
---
Midrange hunter plays 1-2 copies, Deathrattle hunter plays 0-1 copy.
---
After rotation I suspect every hunter will play 2 copies as it will be very strong in new meta (with all old powerful expansions out).
---
If someone does it to me, I do it back to them. They usually stop after a few turns of that.
---
I'm just making the point that I'm not "looking at it wrong" if it's clear that it's not a powerful deck. That I explained well enough why that's the case.
---
So much so that I would say it's not even worth trying out. The deck will fail to be remotely competitive compared to already existing Hunter lists.
---
There is zero confirmation that current quests will be converted to special event quests. It’s only happened once before 
---
Yes, and/or included in a variety of starter packs. But Dust refund if true plz.
