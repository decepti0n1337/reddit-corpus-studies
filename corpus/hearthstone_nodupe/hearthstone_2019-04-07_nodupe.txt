This just in: the word "hearthstone" did exist in English language before 2014

Why do people take this game so seriously? It’s a children’s card game primarily designed for playing during a long bathroom break. Delete this, take a deep breath, and go read a book or enjoy the sunshine or something.

“YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE ANOTHER DEATH GRIP...”

“Why thank you Lich Ki-“

“AGAINST ODD PALADIN.”

Have you ever considered that maybe his deck was designed the strategy you were using and that his deck might just be countered by those that don't care about the removal options and power plays he has?
---
&amp;#x200B;

So a lot of boardwipes rotate. Just summon a board of minions via spells ex. The scheme. Turn 9 or 10 summon imps from scheme into darkest hour. Summon only huge minions like the new big imp, rafaam, giants. Kill next turn. Plot twist and hero power can help find the scheme by turn 3 or 4 to get the 7 imps off of it and even 5 or 6 isn’t bad.
---
I'd guess that do was changed to be viable
---
Version 16.20 shows cards out of sync with description. Went back to 15.13 and saw the same thing (first insertion of shadow cards)
---
*”I remember my first rotation...”*
---
Looks like super strong neutrals.  Lots of counter potential exists for everyone.  
---
Countess Ashmore is going to be very powerful as there won’t be as much card draw post rotation.  
---
Single card win cons (Rexar, Guldan) are gone.  Feels like we are getting a solid midrange expansion with the sole exception of the new Archmage (he is insanely powerful but everyone has him).  
---
Yeah i know 
---
Its like how there will be occasional color swaps and effects that are black will become white.
---
Ya better downvote yourself too if you wanna keep any sense of dignity
---
I did it again. XD
---
It was just as crazy, with even more minions to actually activate those random minion spells.
---
Also, the audio kept properly this time!
---
So I decided to share with ya all.
---
Cheers!

I did it again. 60 Scrolls and Vargoth, take two!

Only deck I play now lol. 
---
Where is Windfura tho ? 
---
All of these changes are great imo. Excited to get back into playing again. Thank you.
---
Sad that it does not work. I'd like to play with the new cards. And i think it would be fun since its just kinda a light version with whizbang.
---
I actually won the second giveaway. I freaked out.
---
Thanks.
---
Well I opened 4 or so packs to get the first one and then I did open 200 and only had 6. I really have no way to prove it though. And I have heard people say that they opened ungoro packs and they have said they got an abysmal drop rate. 
---
The thing is there is no way to tell if people are being salty or if there really is an increased chance of hitting the pity timer with Un’Goro...
---
It the chances are so small then maybe there is something off with something. 
---
Well its actually is a bad deck if you cant cheat out big minions early and resurrect them many times.
---
Big priest usually gets annihilated by aggro decks unless you draw nicely.
---
Hahahah!
---
Ahh, 4 ragnaroi?! It’s not possible! No one’s been able to summon them!!
---
All of the DKs had frost themes, it was the *Icecrown* expansion.
---
Ok but Hagatha is good and the scheme sucks, so, that's the difference?
---
Its play low attack high health taunts
---
Why isn't he a legendary anymore :(
---
I think you need more dust.
---
53 life's too short to wait 3 months for packs and not open any in the meantime. 
---
Yeah. Playing a beginner's deck as a beginner can lead you into problems. However, you're supposedly playing a "beginner's" deck as a decent enough player. If that is the case, you should already know how best to build a deck on a budget and still do well.
---
If you really do not know at least how basic match-ups (aggro versus control, aggro mirror, Midrange versus Tempo, etc.) play out and what you should try to do depending on your role in a game, then you are for sure the less skilled player.
---
Ugly

He's a goblin as everyone has said, but even if he were a gnome, [this](https://imgur.com/a/SXZrFzJ) is what he looks like. He's as tall or taller than player characters in WOW.
---
Nah second is. If you like their rouge, this set has 3 new cards for it tho
---
booms scheme is literally unplayable
---
Didn't think dadghar had a Reddit account.
---
I agree, I would totally dig a Dr Boom cup honestly.
---
Imagine actually having RAM
---
*This comment was made by Firefox gang*
---
Very uninteresting. 
---
I opened 131 packs, 12 legendaries 2 of which were golden. 21 epics, one is golden. And quite a few other golden cards. I usually have shit luck but I was pleased with this one.
---
In the crafting streams Murloc Shaman got a beat down every time due to the chronic lack of card draw.  It has no powerful combos.  The Murloc that makes murlocs 1 Mana is useless of you don't have many cards.  The Murloc that summons murlocs is useless if they are all weak 1/1.  It will be powerful in Wild with Finja and that +2/+2 buff all Murlocs card.
---
Bomb Warrior is going to be the strongest Warrior deck due to Dr Boom Mark II.
---
The chances of that are less then 0.04%
---
just had a similar game with against a dragon warrior last night, they destroyed both my cutlasses with weapons project.  luckily got dr boom early and kept me alive long enough for them to go into fatigue.
---
you haven't seen priest with the new card then?
---
No, I was there when blizzard tried to pull that archetype, but that doesn't mean that we were going to have a **Freeze** themed Shaman Hero, just like we didn't got a **Silence** Hero Priest, A **Discard** Hero Warlock, or a **Spell** Hero Hunter (well, we got that one for Rastakhan), you are literally showing Zero fundament for what you're trying to say, besides the "DK Thrall Art".
---
Is this all you need to farm upvotes in 2019?
---
Just be happy you can spend money like that on a game
---
Cool thanks Rafaam;) 
---
I got 5 legendaries, didnt count epics. Got both dragons
---
Isn't the pity timer for epics 10 packs?
---
That’s not possible, you get an epic every 10 packs so you should have 8.
---
I mean even the worst of the new expansion doesn’t even scratch how bad it felt to get hit with the turn 2 Keleseth, or the on-curve Deathstalker Rexxar. 
---
Thanks to both of you! That's really helpful
---
Sercret Hunter went absolutely Rampage in early Rastakhan and Chief Inspector didn't make the cut, i guess it will be really too slow 
---
Never.  I have only ever dusted surplus minions.  I have dusted gold legendaries to craft a better legendary.  I have a big collection in wild and I go back to it every few months.  I have few Druid, Warlock and Warrior epics and legendaries as I focused on other classes.
---
##it's gold Jerry gold! 
---
Impossible to only get 4 epics, no need to lie. 
---
It's definitely down in popularity, but I wouldn't call it dead:

---
Still got a 56.6% winrate with this list, which might not be the best-of-the-best, but it is nothing to scoff at. The big thing is that most of the cards in here are going to be gone, and I'm not really sure what is waiting and ready to take their place. So you might be right that Control Warlock won't be ready in RoS, but it's not plot twist's fault.....
---
You know the times when we got free golden Devilsaur Eggs and Fight Promoter? Those were nice freebies but at the end of the day those a re missed opportunities to keep player interest.
---
If they gave out a brand new cards for these seasonal promotions I'd be so happy to tell my friends about it. They don't even need to be good cards per se. Make them themed, make cards out of tournement champions, release one card ahead of its expansion, ANYTHING would be more interesting than what we got now.
---
60-70 should be enough with the amount of dust I have and will get from HoF rotations.

Average game length is 7 minutes.  Average turn duration of a game is 10.  You can leave your feelings out of it, Hsreplay tracks turn durations and time durations of the ranked ladder at all ranks.
---
I heard it was going to be similar to wizbang, but then what was the point in hiding it?
---
Definitely easier ways, but it's a fun deck, and semi-viable.  It has a lot of other stuff that's probably better for DRs, but it can be pretty crazy sometimes.
---
Wasn’t that just a bug fix?
---
I just refreshed and it looks ok now. not sure what the deal was.
---
the only recruit mechanic that isn't directly related to mana cost is oakheart and if you recruit a huge millhouse with call to arms people are gonna be upset about it
---
They did say something about an "explosive new tavern brawl" for "ignoblegarden" on the 17th, so I'm guessing that means it's been redone, or at least overhauled.
---
Mostly a wild player I liked quest paladin. It was only really good in this expansion and not really good enough for wild. Playing your Galvadon or Lynessa and getting them back with zola made for very hard for control to deal with you.
---
Pilfer's a lot worse than Hallucination in the sense that you lose the choice factor though. I mean, Blink Fox does a similar thing, and it's seen quite a bit of play, but for two more mana you get a 3/3 body attached to it. I assure you that if pilfer is run in any of these decks, it will be out of a pure necessity in needing more "value" cards. Not because it's by any means a "good" replacement.
---
not in this thread but people post "Blizzard should give more posts all the time.
---
I do too. They've been pretty damn stingy at times but I'm happy about 12.  Everyone is guaranteed a legendary without having to spend a cent.

Toast has the personality of an old moldy boot.

No. I avoid dusting as much as possible, except for golden cards. And there are only 2 cards i regret dusting: golden sneeds, and golden jarraxus. 
---
I really want to try big rogue but don't want to recraft sneeds, and jarraxus seems like a fun card, but i wouldn't include it in any decks that i was going to seriously play and am not going to craft a card for a fun deck

Boom's hero power is too inconsistent, and the value it gives isn't high enough to singlehandedly win a value matchup, since his only real value play is the discover a mech, which comes up randomly and can't be relied on to win a game with.
---
Hagatha is suepr powerful for sure, but value shaman has always struggled to succeed even with hagatha, so it's still an uphill battle to make that deck work overall, especially with healing rain and volcano rotating out.
---
I think other control classes really won't have too hard of a time handling these decks, as long as they have some sort of win condition beyond just out-fatiguing the enemy.
---
And even in THAT situation, Boom's value is pretty small, and hagatha can get stuck with a hand of useless spells, and not enough minions to generate more.
---
I basically disenchanted and dusted everything so i can strictly focus on getting all cards for Mage, Hunter, and Druid each expansion. As a F2P player, this has proved very beneficial as i can focus on crafting random ideas for those classes versus hoping i get the OP or "always meta" decks. I can't complain either as i've been doing it since witchwood and have loved getting everything I want from those three classes and more. Who knows, maybe sometime this year or next I'll switch classes up and try something new!
---
I guess we will see in a week. 
---
dragon roar. the amount of value generated from such a cheap COMMON spell is insane. supercollider is fine, i can win against warriors with it because it doesn't appear much anyway (epic) and it only has 3 strikes. i dont often see druids in arena anyway, much less UI so i'd say UI is fine. (TLDR: any great epic/legendary cards are fine with me because they dont appear a lot. it's the common cards like dragon roar that irk me) 
---
i hope you can execute the combo before your phone dies

Hey, glad to see your post.  I've been struggling with this for hours (ugh).  My main problem is Amazon wants to do a verification on my Rise of Shadows pre-order, but the yellow button it gives does nothing.  I turned on two step verification so it would text me with a code.  I can enter the code, but the yellow Sign In button won't click.  I can click the hyperlinks on the page, but the yellow button doesn't work.  I've tried Nox and Memu.  Nox has a new version since your post (6.2.8) so I uninstalled that and went to [6.2.7.0](https://6.2.7.0) (not .1, couldn't find that), changed the Brand and Model as you suggested, but no luck.
---
I can tab through the spot where you enter the two-step code, then the checkbox (can see the outline when tabbed there), another tab is the Sign In (spacebar doesn't help), another tab brings focus to "Didn't receive the code" link.
---
If you have any tips I'd love to hear them.  I'm hoping to find a friend with an Android device that I can try this on tomorrow.

Thanks!

Most wild decks I play against are homebrew. I use a homebrew deck too. I never run into the same deck twice in a row. It's more interesting, but I also never do legend pushes, so *shrug*

POM and faceless summoner are wild plus the latter had already been banned from past arena drafts anyway. agents aren't busted and won't rotate (boomsday); demonbolt, dragon roar and collider aren't going to wild.

I crafted two golden [[Blink Fox]] for my thief rogue deck the day Witchwood came out (the first time I've crafted a golden anything) and managed to get lucky and get (normal) Tess and Face Collector from packs. I've loved the thief rogue archetype ever since, very excited to play it when Rise of Shadows hits as well.

o.o I didn't say that, calm down. I'm sure there's plenty of other folks who thought of the same thing, I was merely asking cause Toast gets ideas from reddit often, and I haven't seen any posts featuring that deck, prior to mine. That's all. :)
---

yeah but ROgue's cards do :)
---
I wouldn’t tell this community that, they will call you a liar.

wait, isn't supercollider in boomsday? did i miss something? 
---
I do not know the developers' intentions. I am just letting you know it is working as intended and is not a bug.
---
I'll do ya better, and link you right to it from here. :P
---
Several people have asked, already, so I have a thread where I posted the decklist:
---

---
As said in the comment, my deck can be optimized, (as I don't own all the cards I'd use in the deck, like a second Glyph) but this should give a good basis.
---
Have fun!
---
I thought about it, and wondered if anyone would have made a joke about non-symmetry, so I did. :P Had to really think about that one lol.
---
Is no one gonna mention that this doesn't really kill the opponent, is weak to board clears and requires you do deal 7 damage with your hero power without baku?
---
I saw this fail spectacularly for DisguisedToast when his hand was full within 10 spells so the rest of them just milled.
---
They say in the article something along the lines of "older fans might remember..." 
---
Not the entire collection, but most of it. And it was not for an op deck (partly cause op decks didn't exist back then) but for top deck(s).
---
My first deck i crafted was old school Control Priest somewhere between blackrock and loe.
---
Once you craft a meta deck the grind gets easier. 
---
Also mind that the grind was much steeper back then. No legendary clause, no duplicate clause, no free expansion packs etc.
---
Before loe i got to craft hadlock and freeze mage as well. And i started playing somewhere a month before gvg.
---
If you don’t happen to run two weapon removal cards you almost auto-lose against thief rogue as warrior
---
Or an opponent that knows the future
---
I’d rather run the 6 mana armor card with an extra effect. Not niche enough.
---
Yup, you got yourself a bug. I've seen mixed reports about Twilight's Call not resurrecting minions under certain circumstances but annoyingly, it seems sporadic and isn't always replicable 🤷‍♂️
---
Spectral Cutlass seems the linchpin of that deck now before the rotation. Destroy them and the Rogue doesn’t tend to have enough health and armor gain to win. Unless they get Bring It On a dozen times.

No.
---
Just set up private one and you are fine. 
---
Hope it is within the sub's regulation. If not please let me off with a warning...
---
Process takes about 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your tech skills and download times.
---
Step 1: android phone (or PC emulator works too but phone is fine) no need for root or what so ever. 
---
Step 2: download the app fake gps from play store
---
Step 3: enable developer options (settings&gt;info telephone&gt;software info&gt;tap the "build number" a few times. You'll see what I mean once you tap it quickly a few times)
---
Step 4: enable fake locations in the developer options which is now available in the settings menu (and choose fake gps as application if needed)
---
Step 5: find a qualified tavern brawl on the tavern brawl website (I think the address is stated there or find the exact address with zip code using google)
---
Step 6: first check if Hearth Stone is closed down. Then use fake gps location to pick the found location (don't forget to press play)
---
Step 7: start hearth stone app. The tavern brawl icon activated in the HS menu after I turned on find nearby players.
---
Hope it helps. Typed this on my phone so bare with misspellings. I roughly translated the menu options but it should get you there.

Current control mage without DK loses to pretty much any control warrior with or without Doctor boom because of their board clears and armor gain. 
---
Current control priest PREFERS that dr boom is played because it slows down warrior’s armor gain.
---
Dr boom is a very solid card, but he’s by no means meta defining. He’s played a lot right now in odd warrior because he’s a good thing to slap on your hero once you have a ton of armor already. 
---
It’s never easy to just sacrifice 7 mana for a card that has no immediate effect beyond 7 armor on the turn it’s played, and there are tons of matchups where you really just have to hold on to Boom all game because the tempo loss is so severe you can’t afford to play him.
---
And he can do a lot sure, but even once you play him,  you’re only really hoping to get at most half of his abilities in any given matchup, while his other abilities become little more than a dead hero power for the turn you roll them.
---
Hagatha isn’t worth discussing because she’s rotating out anyway, but shaman is currently not a very competitive class even with her, and I find it hard to believe that she would become oppressive simply because DKs are leaving. There’s plenty of decks that don’t use any DK right now that still outclass shaman with hagatha.
---
A lot of people like to do flashy things as BM even if it's against AI. It's fairly plausible 
---
That's when they don't. Learn to separate situations.

Or free on a second account lol
---
Oh thanks a lot but somewhere I read before we will get free packs from every standard set. This article doesnt say anything about other standard set packs. Im not complaining because I would be more happy with only RoS packs, but Im afraid that this data-miner didnt find that, for instance: each of the 5 piece quest chain will give you different set packs( 2RoS, 2 Rasthakan, 2 Boomsday, 2 Witchwood, 2 Classic). What do you think? Because there are exactly 5 standard sets out there xd.
---
The problem (and this is especially true of trump) is that the “in-depth analysis” of most of the cards ends up basically just being:
---
“it’s cool but because it doesn’t curb stomp the enemy player and proceed to have sex with his wife, the turn that it’s played. It’ll never see play.”
---
It worked with "iPad", thanks! :D
---
Oh, no, no, no! I didn't say 6 full expansions. I said 3 smaller expansions and 3 adventures, adding up to the same number of cards released each year (405 currently). 
---
Is spectral rotating out?
---
Safe to say I’m running Weapons Project + Harrison post rotation
---
not even close

Right lol, I have been playing Hearthstone since launch and this is the first time I could afford to do something like this.

While it is great they gave the early legendary free ( Like Marin The Fox), however i do miss the free random CLASS legendary we have been getting —Deathknight with KOFT, Weapon with Kobolds (**along with the Marin**), Spell in Boomsday etc
---
My mistake I brain farted while reading the Tldr. your idea is fine then.
---
Too confusing for new sounds players
---
Random? Still go face.
---
Not to my knowledge, I mean Baku and Genn. Since I won’t be playing an Odd Warrior I can use the good even-cost cards that have been neglected a bit. And destroying the Cutlasses will be absolutely key.
---
Still missing some Epics and Legendaries.
---
Sabreblade#2542 on EU, trading 80g quest, you go first.
---
The entirely ftp mindset is something I kind of struggle to understand (outside of financial difficulties) because the entire game is free, has been for 5 years, whilst it’s not the most competitive scene if you only play with free packs/gold it’s still a whole lot of fun. How do people expect the game to make enough money to keep going for the next 5 years if everyone is trying to squeeze out as much free stuff as possible 
---
No because I’m dusting useless epics. However, I have all but 1 legendary which I keep on dusting until I eventually pull the golden version of it. Currently I’m trying for Cenarius.
---
And then he successfully killed his opponent but broke the game at the same time 😁
---
Yeah boi new archetypes are always welcomed, especially with the iconic Dr 7. :)
---
I'm 99% certain that nerfs to flametongue and cold blood were all an attempt to balance Baku and Genn. Once they had realized was an impossible deed, they should have reverted these nerfs. 
---
That's fantastic. Are you going to color it?
---
I mean most decks other than big priest are similar to current standard decks. Even warlock, even shaman, odd pally and odd rouge. Then there's Reno lock, some Jade's but they aren't even great anymore. The power level of the current sets has warped wild. This rotation wild and standard will truely feel like two different ecosystems so in my opinion it's the absolute worst time to dust wild cards. 
---
There was a quest chain with some "plot" in MSOG.
---
Sounds like a good way to play!
---
Warrior and Shaman are correct. The Rogue card isn’t real though. But I can totally see how you would pick it over the Warlock card, that one seems totally weird and untypical to me as well. Was really surprised to find out it’s not fake. 
---
And regarding the mage card, I would love for such a card to exist, but it sure does not. Called it 9 mana specifically for the Pyroblast curve :) ... Probably wouldn’t be fun to play against anyways.
---
That’s fun, so if you want here is another 3/5, this time with spells:
---
(Paladin) 3 mana: Draw the lowest cost minion from your Deck. Give it +2/+2.
---
(Hunter) 3 mana: Deal 2 damage. If your hand has no minions, deal 4.
---
(Warlock) 2 mana: Shuffle your hand into your Deck. Draw that many cards.
---
(Druid) 2 mana: Discover a Druid minion. If your hand has no minions, keep all 3.
---
(Priest) 4 mana: Restore 1 health to your hero for every friendly minion that died this game.
---
I've got the 80g quest on EU. Anyone willing to play?
---
No he does not expect that, that's why he repeated what the article said.
---
It never will be either with that attitude! Wild cards are great with some brawls and single player content. dust the trash but every set has a few big cards that are worth keeping tbh. 
---
The deck that everyone loves... right? I hope it will not become oppressive by any means, so the fun factor can always be there. :)
---
Whiz Bang. Play though all the decks and see what the cards I like.

I am pretty sure Leeroy will be the last but if burst damage left in standard. They will get rid of stonetusk boar the very next time it enables an unfair OTK. Leeroy is too expensive to do the same thing, he will forever be a neutral fireball.

maybe not the best place to ask but is it viable to play C'thun priest in wild? I love C'thun and his mechanic but wasn't very active on HS during Old Gods
---
Someone should sticky this.
---
I dust every card that isn't rogue, other classes that I used to play we're priest and mage. I don't play them anymore mainly because priest got boring and mage as well. I regret dusting them though. I don't really regret dusting any other class, from the start I just didn't enjoy their playstyle. 
---
Interesting...... are you going to play the meme Oblivitron? Hope you have lots of fun!

This will be my deck too, loved watcher druid back in the day

While they’re both in the game, Vargoth and Marin have crazy synergy with two of the treasures. I guess new Togg can do the same thing with even more reliability
---
r/wildhearthstone :)
---
But to answer your question, you can toy around with pretty much everything in lower Wild ranks and win sometimes, but it's not very competitive deck to play.
---
I have never dusted anything that wasn't extra. I love golden cards so I've never dusted those either. 
---
It's worked out nice for me since l now I have multiple golden decks in wild.
---
I don't aim to craft one or two specific decks, I like to keep my options open as much as possible.  And while I'm not happy that they don't seem to care much for the wild meta, they don't do a whole lot for standard either outside of the release of a new expansion.  So... I won't be dusting.  But each to their own, I guess.
---
Rogue has no use for this guy, I wish that I will be able to disenchant him when the expansion launches.

Thanks dood!

They probably use that method to easily test upcoming versions without having to grab all the hardware.

Why do you think 2 mana freeze one minion hero power is op? It costs too much and can only delay aggro and is useless against non-minion based decks.

I pulled Tak and Jepetto from 51 packs but I opened three warrior epics. I think of trying Bomb Warrior. I will craft Blastmaster Boom. 
---
Yeah well I would say the blame for that falls on Blizzard for not having an engaging tutorial that explains basic concepts such as tooltips
---
maybe you are right but i didnt test this u know
---
In the case of Darkest Hour, it would immediatly be the only Standard card with recruit. If they had printed recruit cards last year, and maybe some more in this set, and they planned to print even more in the next expansions, then it would make sense to use the keyword. 
---
I created the Client.cfg file, and then when I go to run Hearthstone I don't get the card back lol. So I have no idea what I am doing wrong
---
deathwing is for he is your hope situations and i dont know what swap him for
---
Wild is only ever played by fully enfranchised players and at the very most one-thirtieth to one-tenth of the total player base if HSReplay numbers are to be believed.
---
Most players mostly or almost completely play Standard, and all card text considerations should be made with Standard in mind first before considering anything else as a result. The same would be true if most players played Wild or a Wild only set was being produced, in which case keeping the keyword it fine.
---
Literally every single game ever made has the same problem. 
---
People just don't like using tutorials 
---
Personally I believe that Vargoth probably had something to do with the change to Boom’s scheme. The art to me looks like it had some kind of Avenging Wrath/ Spreading Madness effect. With Vargoth and warrior survival tools it lead to a really easy OTK so the panic nerfed it before release. Either that or it shuffled bombs into the opponents deck.
---
I wondered where my luck went. I see you got it. Congrats dude 
---
Commander Rhyssa, Catrina Meurte and Heistbaron Togwaggle. 
---
I mostly agree, but technically Captain Hooktusk also has Recruit. I was worried someone would point that out.
---
Completely agree with this. Keywording doesn't remove the need for a new player to learn the mechanic. Keywording *adds* a vocab word to learn on top of the mechanic, e.g., learn what "Repeatable this turn" means, learn that Echo means this. The benefit has to outweigh this cost. Magic does the same thing and it's because they're fighting against decades of complexity stacking on top of each other.
---
Zoo often doesn't even include Doomguards lol. Hardly matters.
---
It's fucking weird that when I tell the I'd been playing Barnes-Yshaarjs "spell" hunter before KnC, I get downvoted and told that no, I hadn't. Well, yes, I did.
---
Here is a video from 2016 showcasing this deck deck as "successful in legend", even though the person recording didn't have success with it by their admission:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaOqaYEAy4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaOqaYEAy4) 
---
Here is Thijs playing a similar Barnes deck in 2016. He also has a single highmane, but the other 27 cards are spells.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-VyZiJIoQ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-VyZiJIoQ8)

Here is lifecoach playing the same as Thijs above:

---
And a random bonus video:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpIVbW16iCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpIVbW16iCk) 
---
So I stand by what I said: it was not "unthinkable", nor "completely unheard of" to play a hunter with (almost) no minions, I played these myself as they were fun and quirky. (Remember, KnC spell hunter decks also preferred the Barnes combo instead of To My Side or  Rhok'delar, these latter cards only became staples in the deck when Barnes rotated)
---
So...is the DISPOSABLE THUG tag the participation award?
---
Just Big Priest but instead of one of the other big boys, you put Blood of the Ancient One.
---
Totally agree. If "big shaman" works in the ROS meta, I totally see Whirlwind Tempest being a part of it.
---
I think its a bit weird to include Thekal without atleast some other healing other then Nozari. Flash of Light is excellent cycle for any sort of defensive deck and Truesilver is another defensive tool vs aggro I would consider adding. 
---
it might charge you!
---
But seeing "repeatable this turn" on a card is pretty infuriating
---
Burst damage is good and we need some aggro to keep the game healthy. 
---
I'm a simple goon; I see a DarkkMane reference, I upvote it.
---
Sure you can, but as I was saying earlier, that is essentially a completely different combo (and far harder to pull off).
---
we already got a legendary holy shit how greedy can you be.
---
And then I survived the turn and win the game, just like last time
---
Perhaps if you're washing it in a dishwasher. Washing it by hand and only washing the inside of it should keep it intact for pretty much ever.
---
This would be more or less the exact same thing as changing the dusting rates of epics and legends to full value. And that's retarded. 
---
I have the same problem. Until this gets fixed:

Maybe before, but once it's made a key word it's always used. Just core sets write it out as well as it's meant for new players that dont know the words.

Why would they do that? Just to mess with our pity timers, so the packs are on average of less value to us?

But RUSH ain't like the 1 mana warrior card "Charge" eg if u summon bluegill warrior with rush it could still attack

Not in the most popular lists he isn't. He sees some fringe play in a few Odd Mage, Rogue and Pally decks. And even in those it seems it's more of detriment at times.  So, again, not really a loss. 
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/2078/dr-boom#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;tab=recommended-decks
---
oops dont know why i thought it was from boomsday
---
The difference is the "confusing to new players argument" actually works in MtG because of FNM drafts. 
---
I can't just hover a card and know that it does. If it isn't a set mechanic it's less appropriate to keyword for clarity and because the effect might only show up once. 
---
Example. Shadows over Innistrad and Tireless Tracker. Tracker had "landfall - make a clue token" but was spelled out entirely because it was the only such effect in the block. 
---
Compare to hearthstone. Draft is by far not the most common format and you have a UI that can literally tell you how mechanic words work in seconds. To me it's still just going to feel lazy no matter how you spin it.
---
Because Mega-Windfury is Hearthstone's equivalent to MtG's Double Strike: an add on to an already evergreen keyword that doesn't show up very often. It is a Windfury Plus.
---
Mega-Windfury is also more similar to Windfury than Rush is to Charge or even the aforementioned Double Strike is to First Strike. It also being a rather exciting concept helps as well.
---
I got Splintergraft in Witchwood, The Boomship in Boomsday, and Gonk in Rastakhan......so yeah I am happier with Vargoth, lol.
---
You must not be too familiar with Dragon Priest.
---
When the rouge is sick of losing against warrior so, HE BECOMES THE WARRIOR XD 
---
Guys in this context silence gives guy on right LITERAL charge
---
My bad, he was in the Vicious Syndicate one some time in the past few reports. Haven't checked the wild meta in a while.
---
Conversely, I picked it as least popular because I thought everyone would be done trying it
---
Now after typing this I remember Big Priest exists and I regret my decision
---
which should tell you which one was more broken.
---
It's not for the average Reddit user. It's for casual or newer players down the line.
---
Well, I’d say they never should have made echo into a keyword. In TGT, when they relaized they were only going to make a few joust cards and probably never use the mechanic again, they just printed out the full text on the card from the start. Echo really should never have been a keyword, just print out “repeatable this turn” on all of the cards.
---
Not quite. [[Gearseeker Serpent]], for instance, has Affinity for Artifacts without _actually_ having the keyword, because the set it was printed in didn't have Affinity on any other cards. Single uses of a non-deciduous mechanic (one that doesn't show up on a fairly regular basis) will often not be keyworded.
---
Core sets, rather, tend to have the keyword _and also spell it out in reminder text_, like [[Aggressive Mammoth]] and [[Daybreak Chaplain]]. They're assumed to be introductory tools, and so many cards, especially the commons, will clearly spell out what deciduous and even evergreen keywords (ones that appear in every set) mean, to help new players learn the game without having to constantly google keywords. Core sets also tend to not introduce _new_ keywords, whereas non-core sets usually have something new. (The set currently being spoiled, for instance, has two keywords: **amass** is brand-new, and **proliferate** is a high-profile return.)

Jup, but nothing new, since when does a game urinalist must have experience in gaming or journalism! Just push mindless agendas, that all they do. 
---
I would have been fine with an awful overpriced armor card if they had just changed the art to match the effect. As it stands, it reeks of laziness to just give up halfway through the design process of the original effect and slap the first thing you think onto the card. 
---
The deck is definitely very, very good and very popular, but that's not the point (the Wild ladder is also generally pretty softcore before rank 10). It's not more unreasonable than any other strategy you see in the higher Wild ranks and serves a purpose, which is policing the meta from Kingsbane Rogue and midrange/combo decks. In return, it gives control decks a target. You either want a diverse ecosystem of very strong decks that only sounds reasonable when taken as a whole and accept the fact Baku and Genn do indeed belong in Wild, or you don't, and that means Wild is probably not your ideal format.
---
Wild is not meant to be a casual timmy format. It never was, never will be.
---
Presumably it requires some actual Secret synergy cards. By my count, that's 8 cards available to Paladin after rotation:
---
- Secretkeeper
---
- Masked Contender
---
- Bellringer Sentry
---
- Subject 9
---
- Prince Liam (debatable)
---
- Sunreaver Spy
---
- Mysterious Blade
---
- Commander Rhyssa
---
You could pick a number X, and say a deck counts as Secret Paladin if and only if it runs X/30 cards from that list.
---
truly. reddit is the internet. many thanks, comrade!
---
Bad shitpost is bad
---
It's not necessarily good design to take advantage of the different things the medium enables though.
---
Since the computer handles everything the players don't need to know the obscure interactions, but that doesn't mean Blizzard should just print vague cards. 
---
Also, while I do agree it's not like it's really a big deal to hover over the keywords each time, it's definitely a lot messier to have a keyword only appear once or twice a year with no real connection.
---
With this way, when we see a non-evergreen keyword we *know* it's going to feature in a larger way and possibly define a class or archetype.
---
Loving it
---
Theres several things that hinge on these "broad idea is the same", like recruiting a Charged Devilsaur or Kragwa returning multiple Unstable Evolutions. So they are in fact not interchangeable.

Sorry am not. Everytime i go to hsreplay and look priest-decks its always the same boring innerfire decks or ridiculously expensive ones that i cannot afford as F2P. my collection is decent ~184cards/expansion
---
Nah, they want you to disenchant those trash legendaries and craft Elemental Mage.
---
Dragon bomb warrior and zoolock. Maybe secret paladin but I don't think that deck will be as good as everyone thinks. 
---
Its a piece of hyperbole that relays the point im making.
---
I smiled as i typed it.
---
I have lol I'm not new to the game just wanted to have it clarified when I would get it.
---
It’s nothing special. The character has appeared before. Nothing was teased
---
Tuesday?
---
Honestly, with Un'goro out there isn't that much offensively unbalanced. They should probably leave the C'thun stuff out. 
---
Too RNG: Servant of Yogg, Yogg.
---
Too swingy/powerful: Deathwing, Black Knight, Darkshire Councliman, Mad Scientist, Kazakus, Kabal Talonpriest, Potion of Madness, Shaw.
---
I get that buckets make up for power level for the most part (e.g. didn't include Drakonid OP), but some cards just (situationally) swing the game in a way that no Arena deck can reasonably handle. It's a really frustrating experience when nothing you did in a game mattered, because your opponent had this one RNG/tech card. Banning the above should smooth out the experience a bit.

It’s nothing special. The character has appeared before. Nothing was teased. She only appears in the animated short because she’s a troll attending a troll arena match.
---
I opened 130 rise of shadows and I have about half the set and probably around 2200 dust from it. 
---
I think his point is that cards should just use the keywords, and if you don't know what they mean, you can hover over the card and find out.
---
I would definitely wait until a while into the expansion to dust him, just in case he turns out to be really good. Also, it will make sure you some get him in any other packs.
---
Oh Griselbrand, I don't miss you at all
---
V-07-TR-0N not legendary anymore?  
---
I want my money back
---
At least with yogg sarons try out brawl, you can get a lucky board clear, but in this brawl, your basically fucked as soon as someone builds a big board. This brawl feels more like a hyper arena where the strategy is just mulligan for the biggest cards and get lucky.
---
Yeah, and charge is getting denigrated.
---
I think you mean 
---
Heckling Rat Lord: 6 mana, 3/9 
---
Taunt. Battlecry and Deathrattle: Your opponent puts a random minion from their hand into the battlefield.
---
this is only relevant when the "can't attack heroes" is a battlecry, on a spell like OP posted there is no case where gameplay would be different
---
Every card game needs bad cards.
---
Nobody needs a flavorless crap card which clearly was changed last minute.
---
Tbh I want your gold too.
---
Warlock is a Tier 3 class at best this expansion.
---
Midrange Hunter is really overrated going into rotation.
---
Thief and Pogo Rogue are still memes.
---
Boom's Scheme will be somewhat relevant as a discovery off Firetree Witchdoctor.
---
Hecklebot will be primarily used in aggressive decks and won't really be played as tech.
---
You should probably never visit [/r/hearthstonecirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstonecirclejerk) then.
---
Dr. Booms Scheme. Purify works in silence priest, the scheme works nowhere
---
No. That was taken from when the game was still new and then never checked for again. But for some reason the game insisted on showing the stats at the start of every month for your rank. Since then we've had floors and soft reset and just a more experienced playerbase overall. I can't give you any current stats, but it should be much higher.
---
Also keep in mind HS has a very casual target audience. A large portion of those players just sneak in the odd game during a work break or haven't passed the age of twelve. Even if it was 3%, it wouldn't follow that it was hard.
---
B-b-but.. Dr Boom's Scheme is so OP! 1+Armor every turn? OMG! Confirmed nerf incoming!
---
I don't even remember card names anymore.
---
If you ask what is the name of a 3/6 dragon with whirlwind effect, or a 4/4 deamon that becomes 7/7 taunt when your health is low?  I don't remember.
---
The real beauty of that card is being able to pick situational, probably will be the first deck I play with the free spell boy
---
I think Boom, Rhyssa, and Togwaggle will be the strongest. I'm looking forward to having fun with Oblivitron and Kalecgos.
---
Can't access the link for some reason :(
---
For your rotation question, no. After this rotation all of the year of the mammoth expansions (Un’goro, Frozen Throne, and Kobolds) rotate out. The next rotation will rotate all of the year of the raven expansions (Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan), but that will only happen after we get the next two expansions for the year of the dragon.
---
You have to add 1 word a pronoun called “I”. Can you insert it in the right spot? If you do, I will give you a stick next to your name!
---
Wait which is the real card!
---
Why not use echo us the question here. We literally have a keyword for this and blizzards stance is nah we don't care to make things simple. 
---
Been playing Reno mage for more than a year. Mage has always been the worst of the three classes, and tends to be tier 3-4 deck at most of the times.
---
It doesn't have consistent draw like warlock, or swift combo finish like priest. 
---
I fucking hate Zoolock so don't say it
---
I really like Kalecgos and hope mage has a good deck archetype 
---
Was telling my buddy, I want to play Bomb Warrior, but I don't want to craft Boomaster just for it at the expense of meta shit. 
---
In a perfect world, I'd pull one and then "be stuck with it." Lol
---
total mad lad.
---
Please, get on my level. I give you [the current longest card text in YGO](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Endymion,_the_Founding_Sorcerer_Supreme).
---
(I stopped playing Yugioh around the end of the XYZ era, but stuff was already getting pretty long at that point.)
---
Streamers probably just open way more packs than us
---
No, you'll either have to right click the card in your collection on a computer or filter through each set.
---
I agree with you, it’s not game-breaking but it’s not what you except at first when reading the card (and i play since open beta !). 
---
To this day, I thought it played the spell against the opponent.
---
Hearthstone has a bad case of r/IncreasinglyVerbose.
---
First is written incorrectly, and the last two effects are different. I guess Blizzard is right.
---
Did they cancel the divine rotation? if not i stand by my words
---
You can already dust him.. so no they probably won't change that
---
Not letting me copy link to copy deck....? Help
---
I plan on playing zoo warlock. Yes I know to kills the meme fun, but without a good temporogue in my theory crafting list, it’s kinda my only option with my collection being limited to warlock and rogue.
---
It looks like he got hit with an arrow in the butt in a Disney movie. 
---
Congratulations. Now you will have to depend solely on hard work for the rest of your life.
---
Stormrage?  
---
Gustrage?  
---
Whirlwindfury?  
---
Megawindfury just rubs me the wrong way.
---
I hope Darkkmane makes a hearthstone video again 
---
Yes
---
You’re fine
---
So you're saying that just because they don't have Divine Favor the deck is bad?
---
That's really shortsighted.
---
It'd be hilarious if secret paladin gets a rough start at the end of 30 days because of newbies and unrefined decks, but after 90 days somebody figures out an optimized version and it dominates
---
Text comes straight from the CardDefs file, though I did remove the other languages of the name, card text, and flavor text for readability. The tag for this ability is actually called "NON_KEYWORD_ECHO". I trust Reddit will use this information responsibly.
---
You can see read through the file yourself [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HearthSim/hsdata/master/CardDefs.xml), but I'd advise against clicking that if you're on mobile. It's over 17 megabytes of raw text and every mobile browser I've tried it in was barely able to render part of it.
---
Purify isn't even that bad. You can make a deck where you want to silence your own minions
---
call it secret or whatever its still aggro. Aggro paladin was strong because of divine
---
Initial bucketing is determined by blizzard based off approximate power. Rebucketing is performed off pick rate, but these are minor and infrequent adjustments. The initial bucketing has more influence, as there are 7 buckets and there are few rebuckets, each of which moves a card only a half bucket (in most cases).
---
I can't open my 80 packs from Preorder? Am I missing something?
---
Dude stop spreading bullshit. Not even 600 packs can get you the dust to craft all set. Jesus. Learn some math.
---
I think that’s true but with the rise of burgle people may start playing pirate or pogo rogue to counter it. Nothing puts ae rogue in its place like any other rogue does. 
---
You said it, man.
---
The pity timer is absolutely a thing. Your probability of opening a legend increases each pack and hits 100% at pack 40. HOWEVER, you are guaranteed a legend in your first 10 packs of a set and usually the number is much lower. So new, or not, when you open packs in a set you've never opened you're extemely likely to open a legend 
---
They’re coming out this expansion but on a week by week basis across April and May.
---
You most likely got disconnected, if that ever happens close the game out ASAP and reopen it. A lot of the time you can reconnect before your turn ends
---
Sure but there it was to increase their sales. Here it would be to do something with negligible immeasurable benefit 
---
Your C argument is literally the opposite of what key word does. Imagine Zilliax with Magnetic, Rush, Taunt, Divine Shield would be like with out key word:
---
Can be combined with another Mech to its right when played, can attack the turn it is summoned but not to enemy hero, other enemy minions can not attack you hero while this is still in play, the first damage it takes is reduced to 0.
---
That is Zilliax without key word.
---
I don't think keywords do signal importance in that sense. It signals importance because the word *is* important to the card. I don't think they're teyong to slowly ween us off certain mechanics. The *mechanic* is still there, it just isn't clearly highlighted. All it does it cause confusion as far as I'm concerned. People still need to know what echo is, why not do it in one word as opposed to however many more. 
---
Yep and a lot more people watch so the outliers don't get missed. 
---
Figure they'd mean 80% of the cards with the consideration that you can put in two of the non-legendaries
---
Nah just give the reroll button since the beginning and nobody would stick around with the quest for a year. It’s pretty simple.
---
Polymerization  
---
[SPELL CARD]  
---
Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using monsters from your hand or your side of the field as Fusion Materials.
---
I don't think that the current rules for using and not-using keywords is wrong. I think it makes sense to not have too many keywords floating around and having set-specific keywords be restricted to those sets. However, what I do think is kind of dumb is that they print cards with non-keyworded-abilities that are *very* similar to set-specific-keywords in the same standard format. Then you get situations where two cards look like they operate in the same way, and they pretty much do, but strictly speaking they are slightly different and one uses a keyword and the other doesnt.
---
each set has its own pity timer
---
I’ve only been playing since KTF, but same, my free golden Unstable Element was all I’ve gotten.
---
I’m missing so many of the class cards it’s ridiculous. I pretty much just play rogue and warlock
---
So only "repeatable this turn" cards are not returned multiple times with Kragwa?
---
Aggro paladin. Always aggro paladin. Free climb to legend in couple of hours and than you can play all the weird decks you want without loosing ranks.
---
You can host an unlisted fireside at your house through the fireside website! Set the time to whenever you want then during that time click on the fireside button in the hearthstone friends list. It let's you open your paid packs early!!
---
Shield block draws you a card. Booms scheme wouls be unplayable at 0
---
Megawindfury wasn't ever the focus of one expansion like Echo or Inspire. The only card that had it in its textbox before now was noncollectable. 
---
I'd argue it's almost evergreen, just rarely used because it's very powerful and hard to balance. It's not tied to the theme of an expansion, just an ability.
---
Tesspionage is one of the few decks i still have fun playing, so I hope the new tools will make it a bit more viable and fun. I should be able to craft Nozwhisker with my Hall of Fame dust at the very least.
---
&gt;have you simply ignored what i said?
---
Yes.
---
Your argument that changing key words is okay is just stupid.
---
The tooltip tells you what the effect does anyway, so why change it and make it more complicated than it needs to be?
---
I'd have to assume as much, since you're not casting multiple copies of it, just one a bunch of times.
---
"I accidentally rolled the hero skin quest, now it's gone forever. Nice game."
---
This is very accurate
---
I don’t know why they think all we care about is fast news. We need accurate news, not just fast news.
---
Are we losing Divine Favor?
---
Did unstable evolution use that term in the files even before witchwood came out? 
---
2 secret eaters?
---
There’s also that destroy secret guy from witchwood
---
I don't disagree with that, but I don't really see how it applies. Whether you have access to dmg spells, weapons or charge minions you have burst and mix it with an early curve with decent support and you have aggro.  
---
Charge isn't a problem because of aggro. It's a problem because it's too powerful in a game where attacker has advantage and it's either too expensive in terms of mana or it's too easy to abuse with ress/duplicate/recruit style cards.
---
Yeah and they are fucking evolving. Every big priest I see nowadays plays Vargoth instead of Barnes. 
---
There were attempts to do that. "Removed from play" became "Banish" for example.
---
No. MTG quite literally does the same exact thing Hearthstone is doing. 
---
They have Evergreen keywords that act the way people here want keywords to act. But Hearthstone has those too. Things like taunt, charge, divine shield, etc. 
---
But Magic also has expansion only keywords as well, just like Hearthstone is currently doing for Echo. Landfall is a perfect example of this. 
---
[Jaddi Offshoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401928) had the keyworded ability Landfall. A year later [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=tireless%20tracker) had the same trigger but it was not keyworded Landfall. That keyword was specific to those expansions, and even though they wanted to reuse the ability in the future, they did not want to continue using the keyword. 
---
That’s what makes this argument so dumb here. MTG already learned this lesson, and Hearthstone is just taking a page from their book. Yet you have a ton of people here that know nothing about card design acting like this is the wrong move, and then unironically using MTG to back up their point even though MTG literally does the same exact thing Hearthstone is currently doing. It ridiculous. 
---
Sorry for being an actual brainlet , but i created a .cfg file , pasted the 3 lines of code , started hs but nothing happened. What do?
---
Well in MtG echo means you have to pay the cost next turn or sacrifice the creature. It could also mean the spell casts again on your next turn or that you get some diminished return on it if we are guessing based on name.  
---
Awesome thank you! 
---
 they also pretty much always release 1 evergreen card of each type each set. They've not for echo. Its not worth dusting off a keyword for 1 card.
---
These content creators aren't very creative with titles. 
---
There's nothing thematic about Echo, it's not like Adapt or Joust. It's a mechanic that can easily be used in any set, like it was in the upcoming set.
---
Thanks for the report and great documentation. I opened an issue for it.
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1137
---
It literally says on the title this is from the Tavern Brawl, any class can summon the Ancient One in this brawl T1.
---
Im only missing 1 murloc warleader and then the new murlocs, so im hoping i wont have to dust much to get a murloc shaman deck.
---
Ps. Blizzard id like scargil as my free legendary please
---
Same, I can't afford not to dust if I want to be competitive :/
---
look who calls other player btch. the priest btch himself
---
“Your minions that can attack the turn they are summoned have +1 attack but not rush minions”
---
BOOOOOOMB WARRIOOOOOOR
---
I crafted him golden before rotation. No regrets as he is still playable.
---
Why isn't this already in-game?!
---
I wondered if the phrase had synergistic ramifications. Nice catch!
---
Blueno#2477 EU , 80G quest exchange. You go first. 
---
r/woooosh
---
Well darn. That's actually a good title, I like it. xD too late for me to change it now though. Ah well.   
---
Thanks though, take my upvote, lol.
---
Gotta appreciate Chump / Kibler / Firebat for no clickbait.
---
Ah, I see you're a Shadowverse fan as well.
---
&gt;People keep getting too caught up on the new cards
---
And still you run 11 new cards. Do you see the irony?
---
It feels like on alternative years we are going to get either a really strong set or a weaker set.  
---
With the mammoth rotating out... we lost a lot of really strong cards.  Thus we needed something more powerful than what witchwood provided.  
---
Also, I agree that the overall power of this set seems strong.  The neutrals are crazy good in this set.  
---
Except they're very clearly using the effect outside of its set, and they can easily continue to use the effect. Evergreen is for physical games with literal decades of cards and keywords and very precious allotments for space. In MTG, an evergreen keyword is one that's common enough that they don't need to dedicate reminder text to explain what it does, so they don't have to worry about a card looking like it came from YuGiOh. In Hearthstone, all keywords have text boxes *beside* the card when you hover over them, so keywords never take up more space than the keyword itself.
---
Highmain't
---
Nah jk, Scribe could be good as a curve topper in zoo or something.
---
As an evergreen  mechanic it will come up much sooner, so players will quickly become familiar with it.
---
I use casual to practice with a deck I'm unfamiliar with a lot of times.  Don't care about winning or losing too much.   But yeah I also make a deck to complete certain quests for sure.
---
I don’t have the link but it’s just a visual bug. The opening of packs is purely visual, so once you have the packs and once they are gone the cards have already been added to your collection. So although you saw a pack disappear, the cards in the pack were already added to your collection before you even noticed.
---
I crafted them both golden, and idk if I should keep them or get the extra 3200 dust
---
If only we could have some sort of, like, text box appear next to the card when you're looking at it that tells you what all the keywords do.
---
They do that in broadly used mechanics, not on one off cards that are obviously not going to be understood by new players(we understand it cause it was a theme of an expansion)
---
You could also do a pop-up when mousing over the word.
---
It's GOLD Jerry, GOLD
---
Am I the only one who thought my Reddit app janked on me instead of realising it was a gif?
---
Those aren't keywords. Those are "ability words".
---
They're never referrenced on other cards and have no rule entries themselves. They will always be explained on the card itself. The name is used to make it so you immediately understand the effect once you've read it somewhere else.
---
e.g. Landfall; once you've read how it works, you'll then now that whenever a card has Landfall on it, it'll trigger something when a land enters the battlefield.
---
Its also not life-link mechanically either as putting it on an OPPONENT'S minion means that minion HEALS YOU whenever it attacks effectively preventing it from dealing damage while attacking.
---
Effectively it works like the priest spell that enchants a minion to heal you for 4 whenever it attacks and can be placed on friendly and enemy minions.
---
Even the flavor text hints armadillo cloak that its more useful/practical then it looks.
---
Sure it was, you're only acting like you're illiterate 
---
Why do you need the keywords? No one has explained anything aside from saying “uh, just use one keyword for every card with the same effect” what does it benefit you or a new player? Is there anything worth bringing up? 
---
But it would be too confusing! The playerbase is already at their intellectual limit with all deck slots!
---
nvm im indeed a brainlet. Didnt realise there is a difference between a .cfg file and a .CONFIG file.
---
It works flawlessly.
---
Naa, there's not enough in any given set to justify it. You better write out 'this minion can attack twice' instead for clarity.
---
He is KO.
---
Yeah but you can tell that's what Clymr's point was. 
---
i just need a spicy meta.

Cards can be very popular because they are neutral and are played in a wide variety of decks, but that doesn’t mean they need a nerf or are too strong. 
---
What are you even saying? You do know keywords are translated right?
---
it's strange that nobody has thought that maybe dat shaman spell has that wording because it's repeatable ONLY ONE -friggin- TIME. echo: until you have mana left. that: ONE TIME. anyway we will see
---
Wild have [[Feign Death]] and you can do [crazy damage with it.](https://youtu.be/RMm5dOVF9iA)
---
I had exactly the same story. LOL
---
Oh fuck not Barnes the other one errrr Moroes. If there was one Karazan card to keep it would definitely be Barnes 
---
Nope, this point is also made by people not really sure what they are talking about. 
---
Magic, like Hearthstone, has different kinds of keywords. They have Evergreen keywords, which are like taunt, battlecry, divine shield, etc. the common ones that repeat a lot. These keywords in MTG behave how you are describing. They only include the keyword, and assume the players know what the keyword does. This isn’t always true, but it is true enough. 
---
Then they have a different sort of keyword. Their non-evergreen keywords. This is much more similar to how Hearthstone is handling Echo. These are keywords that are only really used in a single expansion or a block of themed expansions. 
---
These expansion based keywords do not behave the way described above. These keywords are never just listed by themselves, and the devs jus assume the players will know what they do. I’ll include an example below so you can see what I mean, but these cards always have the keyword, and the keyword is always followed by a full description of what the effect does. MTG basing does have tooltips, because the full description of what the keyword does is included on the card. 
---
[Jaddi Offshoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401928) is a good example of this. It was in a set that introduced the keyword landfall, which triggers as a land is played onto the battlefield. You will notice it doesn’t just say Landfall, it also describes a full description of what that keyword does. 
---
Now, you will not that a year later [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=tireless%20tracker) was released and it had the same trigger but it was not keyworded Landfall. This is bencause it wasn’t a keyword MTG was changing into a on evergreen keyword, so just like Hearthstone is doing now, they reused the mechanic a year later but did not use they keyword. Instead they just described it through text. 
---
If anybody wants to point to Magic to win this argument, they are going to lose, because Hearthstone is doing the same exact thing Magic has learned is the right thing to do. 
---
If you’re only playing Vargoth Priests, it’s not garbage. Stick all the Odd cost stuff in Odd Warrior, it’s how I got to rank 5 this season. Marsh Drake and Supercollider synergy is *insane*.

It would scare new players

is this card a sleeper?

The only wild deck that I have is my jade shaman just because is my favorite deck
---
You'll have fun in wild for like 5 games and that's it
---
100%. A bunch of the most hated cards in the game's history are rotating so the meta is getting a big shakeup and should be fresh for a while. 
---
That and you're starting on a more even playing field collection-wise with other players, as the classic set will see a lot more play because the card pool is much smaller after rotation. 
---
Wow if you search for "Rise of Shadows Broken" you get results that call it broken in the title? No way...
---
Once the DKs rotate we have a good chance of mid-range returning

did you skip to rank 25?
---
&gt;functionally identical to lifelink
---
That's incredibly wrong. Compare to Unflinching Courage, which is Armadillo Cloak but with lifelink. If you enchant an opponent's creature with Armadillo Cloak, you would gain life, but with Unflinching Courage, your opponent would gain it. You also can't copy lifelink with any sort of ability copying effect, whereas you can with Armadillo Cloak Lastly, you can stack Cloaks on a single creature and you'll gain life for each one, whereas lifelink does nothing different whether there's one instance of it or two billion.
---
It's more like having a small general toolkit you teach to everyone, than having more specialized toolkits for more specialized jobs because dropping a bucket iof 50 tools on someone would be overwhelming even if you told them what everyone does.  
---
You also can't die before lifelink happens XD
---
Warrior will have no trouble in lategame. Dr Boom (both, especially hero), Dragons roar, Omega Assembly, Omega Devastator etc. are all huge. Only Hagatha can attempt to match the value Dr Boom, Mad Genius will give in the new meta.
---
&gt;those dont want to learn want to search in a dictionary what their card does.
---
Then why ever have *any* keywords? Didn't we all have to learn 'taunt' and 'overload' and 'divine shield' at some point?
---
Except "landfall" has no rules meaning, since it's an ability word and not a keyword, and those effects are always spelled out no matter what set they're in or if they have the landfall indicator. For instance, landfall effects always have "Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, [effect]." The word landfall means nothing besides acting as an indicator of a major theme in the set.
---
Compare and contrast to a keyword like Proliferate, where the word itself actually has a rules meaning behind it. That is, it translates/is shorthand for "Choose any number of permanents or players and give them each a counter of each type that was already there."
---
The only times MTG has done what Hearthstone is doing is with obscure keywords like Affinity that aren't a major set theme, like on Gearseeker Serpent as said above.
---
Awesome job! What were the rewards?
---
There is not going to be one this year 
---
they said there will be no skin this year
---
Secret Pally doesn't have Patches, charge minions and upgrades for a 5/2 weapon. Even with a hand-picked draw it won't kill as fast as Pirate Warrior did even with an average draw, it never needed the refill because it literally killed people by going face with everything for 4 turns (sometimes even 3). People forget just how aggressive that deck was, everything else since has been so tame in comparison.
---
In a year's time, Witches Brew will (presumably) be the only card in standard with an Echo type effect. And that will have left it looking a little odd that's true. But in the here and now it shares standard with other Echo cards, and by not using the keyword it is more confusing to newer and more casual players. Why does this card not use the keyword it logically should? Does it interact in the same way? Do edge cases work the same? In trying to avoid overcomplicating the game team 5 have ironically made things more confusing and inconsistent.
---
I really think this concern of cluttering standard with old keywords is overblown. The whole point of keywords is that you can just read the tooltip and immediately understand the card. And they could just release a handful of Echo (or Inspire, or Overkill or Magnetic) cards every standard year to keep those mechnics evergreen, but not as omnipresent as things like Battlecry and Deathrattle.
---
I'd argue that there is still plenty of design space for all the one-set keywords Team5 has made. It just seems such a shame to me for these new keywords to debut every expansion, and often they have potential but slightly miss the mark on power level. And so these new keywords never see much play in their debut expansion and then are never seen from again, because Team5 refuse to meaningfully return to the effects and push the envelope with their power level.
---
Oh okay thats sad :(
---
No leeroy in zoo? 
---
Plus side, he's a lot more viable than Marin from the looks of things.
---
Aren't you rank 50 when you start so you're only playing against other players who have similar collections?
---
Spell hunter will hopefully still be going strong. And without Rhon Delar there are some cool minions I’d like to try out
---
A big advantage new book has is that hero card doom giving boombots rush is crazy powerful
---
4 gold sacks and 1 pack. dont remember the amount.
---
Evergreen is an ex post facto term.
---
Um sir look I’m in the subscriptions tab... this was legit in my recommended 
---
There are a myriad of decks out there that can do well on ladder for about or less than four thousand dust, which is an amount you should reasonably be able to build up to if you didn't skip to rank twenty-five.
---
Sure, there will be people with "better" decks than you even at rank twenty-five, but those people are at low ranks instead of higher ones because they don't know how to properly play their decks. Even if you have a third rate deck, you should be able to do alright with it if you know how to play it properly.
---
&gt;If anybody wants to point to Magic to win this argument, they are going to lose, because Hearthstone is doing the same exact thing Magic has learned is the right thing to do.
---
It's fine to say you can't point to magic to win this argument (especially since as you say magic drops keywords from set to set), but only because they aren't a comparable medium. Saying one way is "right" doesn't work.  
---
This is not the right thing to do for hearthstone if they plan on using the mechanic at any reasonable frequency. It makes sense for a physical card game to do this, as you have to print the explanatory rules for every set specific keyword that doesn't get picked up. No reason to spend extra ink printing the keyword if you are going to print the full text in () right next to it, and it just makes cards more clutterered. However, in a purely digital card game you can always have that extra text in a tooltip, so there are a lot of different factors coming into play.   
---
It also makes sense if they don't want cards that utilize the keywords (like Mistwraith who gets +1/+1 when Echo cards are play) to get stronger. Just like changing warriors Charge spell would be a HUGE buff to the card with all the rush synergy, even though it is effectively rush.
---
Not really, no.
---
They’re taken out of standard play before the rotation because they dictate the meta too much. 
---
They can still be used in wild. 
---
I was there and remember it well, but contexts change. Not every condition needs to be the exact same for decks to end games at a similar pace.
---
Even Yugioh did a thing where [they re-wrote every card text](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Problem-Solving_Card_Text) to make it easier to understand.
---
Nobody plays silence on this sub though, especially not in the pre-expansion meta.
---
Three legendary cards in eighty packs is maybe just below the average result. There is going to be variance in these things, but between all the dust from the upcoming Hall of Fame induction, you really should be fine for Rise of Shadows format even with the poor result.
---
Already tired of the expansion, kinda feel like i've seen everything. Don't even feel like playing lol
---
Even with the edit he added later on after all the responses he got, is that what you consider shitting on the game? This subreddit constantly shits on Team 5 and you know it. 
---
Don't be a transphobe pal.
---
God, it is getting worse. I hate it. I actually stop myself from watching out of principle even though it is probably a video I might enjoy. Just hate it.
---
The pity timer has been consistent in your packs even now though. 20 is average, the pity timer is 40. So you got unlucky, but you are pretty  much inside the expected pity timer zone. 
---
I honestly don´t see anything that would suggest that there is anything wrong with the drop rates. There are always posts from lucky/unlucky people at the start of every expansion, because those are the loudest. I don´t see how this situation is any different from other releases.
---
If you see the preorder as a good value, good for you, buy it. But you know the odds, you know it´s RNG, and you know exactly what you are getting into. There is nothing that says you will get a legendary for every 20 packs, you simply got unlucky, within bounds of the odds.
---
Some of the new cards seem to have this. I saw times where 'this card is repeatable this turn' appeared, even though Echo would be simpler...
---
It’s actually a bit less than that. The portion of the set you obtain marginally decreases as you open more packs. For example, if 260 packs gets you 100%, then something like 100 will get you 50%, so 80% will probably be around 180 or so.
---
If the face has no face...
---
Me still go face!
---
Self advertising isn't allowed on this sub. 
---
&gt; lying maliciously
---
that's quite the hyperbole mate. Who are they actually harming with this article? this article is meant for casual players who might be excited about the new expansion. Most casual, hell flat out most players, have never seen Mimiron's head or VOLTRON to them this key word is definitely new.
---
Lol I take that as a compliment :D
---
It is an awful place to be, the poor guy is starving to death! He had to go vegan.
---
Malchezaar isn't a "behold", though. He says:
---
***Know** the legions I command!*
---
That is pretty lucky. Have fun!
---
Thank you :D
---
cupcakes, pizza and lemonade ...what a joke
---
We've got Jan'alai. If you look closely though, she summons Rag with Rastakhan's watermark instead of Classic. So it's not a canonic Rag.
---
Brawl.
---
Then come and handcuff me for clicking this link
---
It's a lot of fun In mage with [[enter the waygate]]
---
Nice. 
---
Wild is so unbelievably far from being even reasonably balanced that it’s disgusting
---
I hate this logic. Let's say everyone in the world suddenly loses their left leg and goes blind. No one is broken because everyone is! Easy.
---
It's alot of fun with [[timewarp]]
---
Or trying to inform casual players who have never heard of mimiron's head of VOLTRON? 
---
Hint: This applies to about 95% of Hearthstone's players.

5/-/- | Take an extra turn.

Only half? From 130 have all the commons, most of the rares, half the epics, and 40% of the legendaries (incl vargoth) which results in around 75% of the cards (rough guess)
---
long term, get good at arena

I read that value decks sucked at every reveal stream, being killed by aggro turn 5. So I doubt it.

This also should be on the Overwatch sub, not Hearthstone.

Thank you fellow [[Tar Lurker]] :D
---
The data from the packs I pulled about 2 hours ago is my limited sample size until the store opens.
---
We never had official numbers for a pity timer but Google pity timer or search this subreddit for the same thing and 1 in 20 on average has been the accepted rate. I know averages have variance and my own personal experience is that the average is accurate over the several expansions I have tracked and my overall collection stats say its broadly in line. 
---
The current expansion on the numbers I shared are not falling within the consistent experience of around 1 in 20 I have seen. Its out by a decent percentage and others are saying similar. Of course all of this is personal stats because no official ones exist that I'm aware of.

5/1/7 Elemental | Taunt Has +3 Attack during your opponent's turn.  
---
Thanks :D
---
I prefer saying it has a great personality
---
It's not like any visitor of this subreddit needs any Hearthstone "news" anyway. We're not the demographic of that website. we are all fully aware of the new mega-windfury guy. This was proven by the comments on this post.
---
If you craft just to keep them, you're not making a profit.
---
I took a course called /u/UnleashedMantis 101: How to be a dumb cunt and get away with it.
---
Everyone, get in here!
---
So you're saying that because you didn't open exactly or close to the average that something might be wrong? If so, that's not how averages work.
---
You essentially get majority of Commons and rares from 75-100, but epics and legendaries are what make it so you need to buy like 200+ packs to get it all. That's at least what I'm gathering from this? 
---
Thanks bro. I appreciate it!
---
Have you got a link to the pity timer being 40? I have never gotten near that number and low to mid 20s was always my ceiling. I get averages and stats and so on but this is the first time I have seen 40 mentioned.
---
Yeah I do see it as decent value, assuming all along that the value is derived off the 20 average. Could just be several expansions of luck or a change under the hood! Time will tell I suppose!
---
Same, I despise shameless clickbait
---
Well done!
---
Or you know you face the facts that secret pal is not gonna work and stop being in denial 
---
Aye, I'm an average player at best and Rexxar provides good value but nothing compared to the priest ridiculousness. Imagine if you will, if Rexxar summoned 3 zombeasts and they all immediately went onto the battlefield then it might be a reasonable comparison.
---
lmao truth
---
You should probably lead with your evidence in your original comment, because this is a very valid point that is gonna be ignored because you are at the bottom now. I wish this was getting more discussion, considering that base zoo will have a higher comparable power level compared to the new decks right off the bat.
---
To be fair it would still have rush as the hearthstone dev team plans on continually using rush for multiple expansions to come while recruit and echo have seen very little if any usage outside of a card or 2 every other expansion.
---
I agree, and I’m not saying it should be condoned or that the downvotes weren’t warranted. It’s just that personally I feel when we use words like “transphobic” or “racist” for every little thing it takes power away from when people are actually harboring deep feelings of hatred. When these labels are applied so liberally, someone whom protests a gay wedding is put in the same category as someone making a bad joke on Twitter. Transphobia is a serious issue but the broader the label becomes the less seriously it’ll be taken.
---
I really want to believe in dragon paladin, for me it still lacks some dragons in the package, but it's defnitely something I'm looking forward too
---
Face the possibility that there are more people noticing a trend in poor ring this expansion, it's possible that the pity timer isn't working, it's broken before and it's possible that something similar is happening now.
---
im also a murloc enthusiast, only wild deck i really play.

You'll be dead before you gain 10

I feel the same about Boom at least, what with Boomsday being less than a year ago, but I understand why it had to be him. Someone pointed out that the villains come from five different years of Hearthstone (that had expansions, at least), and Dr. Boom is the only character that suits the Naxx/GvG year. They wanted to focus on HS specific characters (or in Dr. Boom's case, HS relevant- he's not exactly an important character in WoW, but is memetic in HS), so no Naxx character would work. Plus, while KT is really funny, he really would not fit among a group of lightweight villains like the League of Evil. The only other choice would be to take a GvG character, but seeing that GvG had no story content, nobody else had a chance to make an impression in HS.
---
That said...now I'm imagining Mr. Bigglesworth as the Hunter representative of the League.
---
isnt the difference that kragwa gives multiple copies of unstable but echo cards you only get one?
---
You're clearly back pedaling. It's fine, but you don't have to act like you meant that all along or that you didn't make a misleading post.
---
Regardless, it still makes no sense to say we should face the possibility of something with zero solid evidence behind it.
---
its simple...
---
That's all fair enough, might craft it come next expansion. Thank you for the replies
---
since when have you been saving that gold damn
---
You don't.
---
Mate, thank you so much for this - Got 4 packs, the last of which was a rare, golden rare, epic and legendary (Nozdorum)!
---
Did pirate warrior have card draw I'm not remembering? Did odd rogue before Myra's? Aggro doesnt need draw. Part of why tempo mage before the nerf and the paladin decks recently have been so absurdly broken is that they were fast and also still had draw. Burn is a bigger concern and it probably needs one of the two, but it's getting secrets to help make it more resilient to clears, so maybe it'll be a new variety. Kind of like token druid, which didn't have draw or burn and succeeded by being able to get absurdly strong boards to get under removal and sometimes made it too hard to clear. 
---
It’s missing the tall boys in robes

Fuck yeah Dr. Daddy 😩😩😩, Uber thrust me, harder!!💣
---
You're clearly trying to start an argument because you're too ignorant to consider another point of view based upon trends of poor ring posts within the subreddit.
---
All you want to do is argue 
---
this card brings the community together, what more could we possibly ask for? If this card was playable, imagine all the reddit posts that wouldn't have the light of day. 
---
Can't wait to move on to the next. This horse is so dead.
---
Eater of Secrets is 1 mana cheaper than Chief Inspector which I assume is important for a deck trying to combo things together for an OTK. The downside is it is worse against non-secret decks.
---
Are you sure? Pretty sure it doesn't.
---
This is only true with you get to higher ranks, you can stay at low ranks in wildand have fun with meme decks 
---
Yes, I'm sure. Had it happen before and the wiki agrees: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Gameplay#Order_of_play
---
&gt; Both heroes' health reaches zero at the same time. This causes a draw, although both players will see the Defeat screen. Neither player will win or lose a star in Ranked play, and neither player will be awarded a win or loss in Arena mode. If you were on a winning streak, it will end your streak.
