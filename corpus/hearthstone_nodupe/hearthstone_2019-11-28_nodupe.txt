Thanks! It's admittedly unlikely and a bit wordy, but I wouldn't mind seeing something along these lines once in a while.

He wants tinkmaster to be played because he got it goled out of a pack.
---
I dont really play wild so I apologise for my ignorance.
---

---
I was talking about the shamans in standard. Simply put, just play warrior. Brawl and warpath are so good v shaman.
---
missed the friends guy and the skull still tho
---
Oh boy, kun-&gt;sath-&gt;floop loop

I wonder how many would downvote if it weren't anonymous.
---
FYI the number still changes when you change your battletag yourself. I've done it. Went from four to five :(
---
This is one of the card arts from Blizzcon.
---
&gt; We are putting a lot of work into improving this experience.
---
Except for Wild.
---
But then you have to play N‚ÄôZoth rogue. That‚Äôs boring as hell.
---
What are the mindgames here, exactly? They put a big dragon in it. What more do you need to know?
---
Same reason most black Friday sale prices aren't sales

i Play at 7 k mmr hmmm whats your rank.?
---
You're not wrong, but that's not really what I asked. *Data* to support this.
---
mmmm so dark pact and possesed lackey? Or what other warlock cards?
---
Remember that it also damages your minions so it's terrible for everyone
---
do the math for me plz on the chance u getting malygos and kalecgos and getting an aoe spell and comeback to me. and even then if that game happens to be vs warrior he'll just clear ur board. So u know what i still think this card i great design and won't be op
---
I like that you crossed out ", Dragonlord" since he's not in standard
---
We haven‚Äôt had a real crazy power level set since Year of the Mammoth. Since then we‚Äôve had a lot of sets with interesting (but balanced) mechanics, with the most broken stuff coming from mid-expansion events that probably didn‚Äôt get enough testing. They even skipped the usual powerful end-of-year set, with Rastakhan being one of the weakest ones ever. I remember a lot of people here wanted this and believed it would be good for the long term health of the game.
---
We can see the opposing side of the argument now though. Balanced doesn‚Äôt sell packs or get people excited to play the game. They want stuff like Death Knights that change the way the game is played, and make them feel powerful. Too many ‚Äúmeh‚Äù expansions is one reason interest in Hearthstone (the CCG) is at an all time low. Team 5 is certainly aware of this and are pulling out all the stops now.
---
Absolutely cannot wait to slot this into Big Reno Mage in wild
---
It's kinda funny to me that that card ended up being just ok
---
The new set is coming out incredibly soon (hearthstone wise)! I'd recommend saving both your money and your gold. Once the set comes out there will be opinions on what is good or not. 
---
Blizzard has implemented a feature where you can pick one of your favorite cards and it tells you a popular deck with that card in it. It also includes cards you don't own as recommendations but they also have replacement recommendations from your current collection if you click complete deck. I would highly recommend doing that for now and then doing it again in a week or two after the new expansion to see which cards/packs/etc. might be good for you to invest in.
---
This game is a lot of fun! I hope you have a good time.
---
Thank you for this comment so I took the time to look at the picture closer.
---
Yeah and I am really looking forward to all these fun dragons. I love powerful sets and this set is looking to be increadibly meta breaking.
---
I don't even understand what you're trying to do here? You seem so angry for pretty much no reason..
---
Who seeks out a "niche subreddit" just to act like a little bitch lmao.
---
Hearthstone's main selling point is that it's incredibly accessible and can be picked up and put down for weeks/months at a time with minimal punishment. They focus all balance changes on being what is the most obvious and they limit keywords to being one per set so when returning you only have a few new mechanics to learn and they're very obvious.
---
I don't agree with the simplicity of it but it's the direction the HS team has gone in. There are more interactive card games out there that will probably suit your tastes.
---
Are you talon me that was your Dragon pun? Aw, I shouldn't roast you for it though, I can tell that you're just winging it.
---
omg thank you!
---
tru. but altho it is pretty annoying getting extra cards when you're popping off with shudder I really don't think he's worth cutting. has saved my ass and given me lethal plenty of times. just save him 'til you really need him
---
And I wanted to say that, the chance for them to pick wrong is 1% of the time.
---
Nah theres some guy on the reddit thats going around mass awarding random posts and comments.
---
Priest can discount Alex OR breeder with the discounty dragon to make this work. Probably much more consistent
---
Only if I get classes I actually play.
---
Now what will I play when evolve rotates out?
---
How do we petition to get evolve added to the classic list?
---
nah. i got my negative comment guilded once. it was one of my throwaway account.
---
Yeah also had this happen a few times, hope it'll get fixed soon....
---
Nice pulls!
---
If Zephrys the Lethal ever gets nerfed you will Scrooge McDust!
---
think of fireball. it deals(6) damage. Now think of spell damage from a minion, spell, whatever. Dragon soul now requires 4 spells to activate.
---
It‚Äôs literally not hearthstone. There are four similar features, which are that you need to deal damage in order to beat your opponents, can play minions, need to pay for your minions (but then it‚Äôs a completely different system), and the abilities of cards are the same. It‚Äôs less similar to hearthstone than magic the gathering is.
---
Saw this live. Was insane.
---
Never seen it in any game whatsoever lmao.
---
Honestly even like 1 month could be fine or just select more fun cards.
---
Even if they wanted high power level cards make it the same with every class not this Shaman and Mage getting super tier cards while Warlock got memes.
---
No, it's not. With the new expansion decks are gonna be crazy expensive and all the powercreep seems like a short term money grab that doesn't leave the game in a too good state for the future. Also blizzard helps China with their foreign influence and already proved that they're going to put the Chinese market ahead of their morals. So the game sucks, the company shouldn't be supported and in general I don't see that much sense in starting a game now that it's dying. If you look for nostalgia you can delve into solo play for a bit but please don't give them money for it. They don't deserve it.
---
Pretty hard to say given that we haven't seen all the galakronds yet, nor are the invoke cards, nor all the cards for the set.
---
Give it a week or two and people will be able to form properly informed opinions.
---
LMAO, wait i mean Roffle.
---
Zerus is asserting dominance
---
So uh, are comments gonna get any awards?
---
I like how the video clip at the end showed The Dragonqueen generating the [[Azure Explorer]] (which gives another Dragonqueen) and [[Ysera, Unleashed]] (which neatly shuffles 7 Dream Portals to deck which very likely deactivated the second Dragonqueen.

When boomsday was first released, it was widely regarded as a massive failure on blizzard's part because it made almost no dent in the current meta. All magnetic cards with the exception of Zilliax saw no play Until the Mammoth sets rotated, and it was agreed to be a failed mechanic for the longest time.

HS is their first mobile game, so they picked tested and tried mobile engine for it, Unity. I'm not personally huge fan of Unity, but I wouldn't call it shitty either. I don't think picking the most popular cross platform engine is a bad choice. Porting the game on a new engine would be a massive undertaking and would continue to be, as you need to be constantly adding support new OS features that come out on four different platforms.

Oh well.

See you guys again in 2 years to be downvoted again

Yeah of course it's not gonna happen on every phone. That's not the point though. They never cared to keep the game at a high standard unless they lost huge amounts players or the shitstorm was too big. There are a lot of other examples too.

Last time i saw these many awards Pulisic had scored a goal.

Can't get past Taunts, generate value late game or reused by Zul'jin.

It is overall better however.

Pushkin, how are you so damn fast?

I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs an elaborate ploy by the mod team to reveal a meme tier card (like last time), but I doubt it.

I can confirm it's Diving Gryphon. Here is the picture I found on Blizzardcon art gallery.  [https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ramming-Speed.jpg](https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ramming-Speed.jpg)

I considered that. Still think it would be worth it to have more

I'm not going to claim it's a good sale, but yes, there's a sale. Discounts on the heroes. (Magni, Medivh, Alleria)

How does it work when drawn interactions? (Flame Leviathan, Sea Reaver, Mines, and Bombs)
---
Depending with how this works with Deck of Wonders I'll have some fun ideas to try with this card in wild lol.
---
25 armor? Try 2500.
---
I don't think you understand what "strictly better" means.
---
i want discounts on card packs huhu
---
some of the other games i play offers black friday sale event.
---
Coming from an idea I saw in r/Customhearthstone, if there was a card that buffed every number on the spells text by (1), would that mean that it‚Äôll affect the word as well? Assuming such a card would be implemented in the first place.
---
A lot of people have impaired vision so the smaller the text the more people you prevent from being able to read the text at all.
---
This card is badonkers! I like it ü§ù
---
Wouldn't give 0 cost legendaries imo
---
Your logic is pretty weird... There are already cases where you can't trust a minion's attack. The whole Poisonous mechanic, for example. Or Animated Armor - a 30 attack minion would still hit for 1 when it's in play. Similar mechanic was repeated on a minion in Rumble Run - there was this Paladin Taunt minion that can only take 1 damage at the time.
---
It's an effect, card effects overwrite all kinds of basic game rules. It's like saying that ramp cards are a bad precedent, because you "can't trust the amount of mana your opponent should have". Or heck, drawing cards itself - players are supposed to draw one card per turn, but obviously they can do more than that. We just got another card that overwrites a basic game rule by allowing Warlock to have a 12 cards hand.
---
I don't see how an effect like that would be problematic at all, it's a very simple one and all you need to do is make some basic calculations (I'd say that HS players are capable of adding or subtracting 1).
---
&gt;If they add that mechanic to a spell, it would be even worse(bc enchantments show much less).
---
Crazy idea, how about not add it to a spell/buff then? Tons of mechanics would be problematic if they were printed on another card type / in another class etc. But they simply aren't.
---
POCKET RAFAAM!
---
Bomb diffuser
---
I feel like the logical thing would be whatever was in play first would take priority, the bomb or this guy. But I dunno.
---
Not when it was first in standard. Tempo Mage was a real deck back then and Flamewaker was basically the centerpiece of it. Tempo Mage is also still a real deck in Wild and Flamewaker is still a staple in that deck. Current standard isn't the only format that exists. Even if we're only taking current standard into account for some reason, tier 4 is bad, but is still considered a deck, and it is completely held up by what? Flamewaker! If Flamewaker wasn't there it wouldn't be a thing.
---
There is also the fact that we don't know what else Mage is getting in this set. For all we know they could be getting a lot of spell spam support, and it could actually be argued that this card is even better than Flamewaker.
---
A very sweet card, even though it won't see play.
---
Impbalming adds some bad cards to your deck. This is still bad though.
---
Paladin for me. I don‚Äôt hate playing paladin but I don‚Äôt really care to play it either.

A fun card that people get instead of the good epics in the expansion. Thanks blizzard
---
I‚Äôm not understanding how it‚Äôs presumptuous of me to want a mode for people with impaired eyesight where your cards are bigger and also consistency. Also, I‚Äôm really having a hard time believing there are tons of people who play hearthstone and could read dragon soul in its current state but wouldn‚Äôt be able to on four lines of text.
---
Pretty sweet.
---
Sounds vaguely like TrueSkill.
---
I'd like to know how they weight placement in a match. For example, in a point-based MMR system, it could be (-7, -5, -3, -1, +1, +3, +5, +7). Or it could be (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1, +1, +3), which rewards getting top 3 and especially 1st. In their system, it probably arises implicitly from how they determine the probabilities of various match outcomes given the MMRs of the players.
---
I was speaking to the point where you said you were sure it wouldn‚Äôt bother anyone, but I mean you just don‚Äôt know because you don‚Äôt have poor eyesight, so it‚Äôs kind of weird for you to assume for others is all. I agree with you otherwise.
---
Croc that should be played if your deck is full of bad cards
---
Cyclone mage just got a whole lot more annoying
---
That shi op af
---
I'm mary poppins y'all!
---
Oh, I was mostly making a jab at dragon soul, sorry about that.
---
Giving any opposing deck 20 mana and partial charge/windfury on minions is a horrible idea. Playing a 2/3 is a decent idea if you have literally nothing better to do and an available spot on the board.
---
No worries, my eyesight isn‚Äôt too terrible so I‚Äôm not upset or anything but I wanted to mention it to you even though it‚Äôs not really my place anyway, because it just seemed off to me. Sorry to give you grief over it thanks for being tight.
---
Probably true. I should maybe not have made this thing at 2 AM.

---
Life is hard,
---
Watching Tides stream he said this was how it worked.  Not sure on his source though.
---
I've finished 4th before with 5th and 6th going out the same round.  I ended up losing MMR.  When I finish 4th by myself i always gain a small amount of MMR.   So the shared MMR for ties seems true.
---
Great thing about priest is you don't play with your own cards anyway
---
Okay Doomer
---
Except the fact that it's ridiculously narrow is going to hold it back. It'll probably be good, but Zola's power was in her flexibility, and unless there's multiple dragons that you want to consistently clone this card is unlikely to be the powerhouse she was.
---
You mean he puts all of his faith in it
---
I don't understand the coloring.
---
For anyone wondering there's a life version on https://subredditstats.com/r/hearthstone
---
I think the understandability of card effects is a valid concern, but also something that could be worked around. I would playtest an icon similar to the skull icon that appears over a minion you're targeting when the interaction would kill it. Plus I love the idea of, say, a Beast Slayer's Totem that gives your spells Beast Slayer, for instance. Like a highly subjective Spell Damage. It'd be tough to do right, but it's a fun thought experiment.
---
I like the way you dream but you're simply wrong.
---
Last time Tempo Mage was in the meta was in early 2018. It hasn't been featured on any tier list since.
---
Also, if Cyclone wasn't a card in Standard, nobody would be playing Flamewaker.
---
I haven‚Äôt been active for about two weeks, but was in top 200 NA and took Deryl whenever possible! He‚Äôs just so freaking versatile- one of my biggest pieces of advice is to not get picky in the early game. Find a token or two, and don‚Äôt be afraid to buff up something like Righteous Protector. I like sitting at tier 1 an extra few turns to direct my hats towards fewer targets, then fish for Amalgam at 2 once I have some stats on board. One advantage to upgrading to 3 is that it still only has four minions in the shop! Assuming a comfortable enough position though, I like to push 4 for access to Hydra, but also access to discovered Lightfang. 
---
Oh, and make sure to plan out turns quickly and keep track of gold well! Sometimes there may just not be enough time and you‚Äôll have to freeze or just buy before you get all the hats on- it‚Äôs not ideal, but cutting your losses for a slightly weaker minion may be correct. He‚Äôs easily the most fun hero in the game for me, and I‚Äôm glad that players like Tides were similarly thinking he was the best hero (which seems to be a more common sentiment now!)
---
Really though, I think the most important thing is to aim to maximize hats in the early game. The tokens are essentially a 1 mana +4/+4, which is great on anything. Tier 1 has been my best friend!
---
HOW?! Just how?
---
They deleted it. No more shaman.

A situational card should never be S tier. S tier should be reserved for the absolute best which you just want to slam down whenever you see it. Cards like nozari are (imo) A tier. Incredibly powerful effect but it isn't an autoslam top tier, it requires you to be losing to have an effect.
---
It transforming some bombs but not others likely wouldn't be a desirable logical conclusion.
---
But cards like this are just generic auto includes, not powercreep to push a specific type of deck.
---
Awww... but darkness is so much fun!
---
I think it'd look balanced or similar to (-7, -5, -3, -1, +1, +3, +5, +7).
---
To be fair, I got rank 5 this month with N'Zoth rogue (which is tier 3 or 4 atm because of shaman) and if you asked me, that deck is pretty bad. Rank 5 isn't that difficult if you know what you're doing imo.
---
Magic my friend haha (not really)
---
I use THE BEES!!! X2 And a linecracker x1 to get him to 1200+ attack and then use 1-2 earthen scales to gain either 1 or 2 times his attack in armor üòÅ
---
prob not
---
Yeah this really seems like one of the cards they build out a year prior, so when they release the design space around it, it doesn't stick in standard for a full two years. Don't expect it to see a lot of play now, but maybe in six months?
---
Now I'm sad :( but thanks for the information, now I won't be disappointed when I don't hit a "confirmed" legendary ^^
---
Cool I'll try changing

---
I swear i read this before every expansion, just to see everyone depressed and waiting for the next one less than a month in.
---
The fact that the full heal hits both characters makes Nozari a little bit and Nozdormu the Timeless gives you empty mana crystals, which on turn 9 means he's just a 8/8 body. On the other hand, the two Alexstraszas can set up lethal against your opponent by setting them to 15 and then dealing 16 from attacks the next turn if they survive.
---
you got beat this time pushkin!
---
This is so broken I'm considering it in Wild Mech Hunter, get some good trades and top off with a Zilliax.
---
I bet you some deck will try to use the dragonless mode to abuse healing.
---
Rules are meant to be broken.
---
Well I guess we should bow down to our priest overlords then.
---
Rogue might be happier with this than Warrior xD
---
Board Clear Priest in Wild will love this.

Twin Tyrant is still grouped with the Wild cards.

\[\[Volcanic Potion\]\] : am I a joke to you?
---
But i got a "win" on quests for first place Battleground the first Week. Dunno if changed now.
---
Control dragon priest is looking spicy
---
&gt;If this was Rogue weapon
---
What do you mean? Every card is rogue's card
---
oops. Apparently I'm colorblind.
---
A volcanic potion that can be a 3 mana consecration (but without the face dmg) in a dragon deck...
---
Looks strong but at the same time, not that strong. Its fair, and priest has a ton of other removal options so maybe this card doesnt even make the cut despite it being good.
---
Priests have more Dragon-specific board clears than some classes have *any* board clears.
---

---
HAMMER WIELDING GRIFON RIDER
---
True but the quest is unique in that you can play it on turns other than one and not be punished for it because you aren't attacking most likely turn two. Without nzoth's first mate you aren't getting a turn two weapon in. So you can honestly float it until you have extra mana going into a weapon turn. That being said, it limits your effective first draw to 3 or 4 cards depending on going 2nd or 1st, and thats a big impact when fishing for early minions.
---
Yeah I didn't realize this was a warrior card somehow. It's strong alone for it's card draw as you say in a class that still relies on shield block battle rage and acolyte of pain. 
---
Also the point about needing to wait for pirate synergies just got even more important because we can just assume there will be pirates released to come out with this.
---
Whoops, and thank you! once we get a few more dragons I'll fix the Twin Tyrant issue.
---
Damn yes if there are good enough pirates this expansion,why not? Dont be racist,lol
---
As if people could handle warrior being popular again. Lol.
---
Like buildings, or people.
---
if you have any even cost cards, lose the game.
---
STICKY FINGAAAAAAAAAAAAAHS
---
Were was this when Kingsbane was a thing
---
Will this card's effect trigger before or after Fel Lord Betrug's effect?
---
Unless opponent plays Kobold Stickyfinger and takes his weapon back to use the last durability.
---
The kingsbane counter we needed, but that arrived too late.
---
I have a better idea: Unnerf Reckless Experimenter.
---
They did so many customhearthstone ideas. I'm actually surprised.
---
ARI ARI ARI
---
And then play this to break their own legendary weapon with the enemy 1/2 dagger!
---
George the fallen is great for murlocs, you only need tavern level 4 to start massing divine shield and poisonous on your murlocs.
---
With so many galakronds probably running arround, this looks like it will be usefull against them at least.
---
They're going to print more Legendary weapons this set.
---
Why else would they print a tech card for it? Ancharr isn't going to carry an archtype.
---
How did this get so many rewards? Already the title makes me cringe.
---
That and because it is pretty bad to have one card less in your starting hand. But the last aspect gets kinda compensated with this weapon, so the question is only if it's worth giving up turn 1. I think it might be viable not as an aggro deck but tempo oriented midrange.
---
Become a zipper man for copyright reasons.
---
So the next set is going to have Pirates in it. Interesting.
---
It makes the opponent lose their weapon. And you equip it.
---
No battlecries activated when equipping weapons trough effects (they werent played from hand), deathrattles can happen when the weapon is destroyed as always.
---
This doesnt add a copy of it to your hand.
---
why would that ever matter?
---
Looks surprisingly balanced tbh
---
no
---
Nobody invoke twice at turn 2 I think so
---
Stop hitting yourself, Jaraxxus!
---
More like ADDIO
---
This is fun. Probably too expensive to see play but could be good in arena
---
It's a tech, and it's nearly useless against some classes, so it doesn't really preclude Kingsbane decks' existence so much as place a check on weapon-based decks' dominance. Similar to the status Eater of Secrets currently holds.
---
A card, born in the wrong Generation
---
Priest:
---
Blizzard: well if you keep begging for more board clears...
---
Thank you for the explanation!
---
Thats the point of tech cards though.
---
With galakrond being in this expansion, they assume many classes/decks will use weapons, so this card isnt always useless. And it also works as a deterrent for decks that all their strategy revolves arround a weapon and nothing else (old kingsbane is the only deck like that).
---
Soooo this isnt that bad to never be run in your deck, and also it isnt that strong in any possible matchup that it instawins you the game just by playing it. Just like tech cards, you will get a decent advantage for using them in the correct metagame, but never insta-win and neither auto-include.
---
This isnt a bad tech card.
---
Post tick picture to post that is already posted LOL
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Skycap%27n_Kragg
---
Looks like Freehold
---
Kingsbane existed for quite a while after the leeching nerf thanks to Raiding Party. The deck changed to a super aggressive pirate variant that actually ended up being more powerful than the mill variant was at its prime.
---
Casually forgetting the Paladin weapon.
---
Well not really, they could just code it not to appear like all bounce cards.
---
Probably the Blitzchung event and OP messed up the x axis
---
Seems suspiciously quiet around Ocotber...
---
It only had 5 Ancestral Spirits on it
---
facing a 5/8 and 6 21/4's
---
First true pack filler in DoD?
---
My god, this formatting...
---
Battlegrounds time?
---
Yu Gi Oh vibes from this one
---
The only combo I can think of is just a clunkier version of a Timber Wolf &gt; Dire Frenzy &gt; Tundra Rhino
---
This would be a terrible weapon without the upside. Do you see many shamans running [[stormforged axe]]? That is better than a 3 mana 2/3 weapon and it's rarely run even in overload synergy decks.
---
Not in the upcoming power creep meta.

2/2/3 | Overload: (1)  
---
Declaw Galakrond!
---
I found my new favorite card
---
Druid.
---
&gt;And usually pirates aren‚Äôt a very slow archetype, but this weapon is. I hope that will be enough anti synergy to stop it from being busted.
---
Then again, Pirates synergizes with weapons. I'm definitely glad that it's legendary because I feel like this could push aggro warrior into unhealthy territories.
---
Southsea Deckhand gives you a 2/1 with charge for 1 mana when you attack.
---
Bloodsail Raider is a 2 mana 4/3.
---
Dread Corsair is a 2 mana 3/3 with Taunt.
---
Captain Greenskin turns your 2/3 weapon into a 3/4.
---
Plus, the set isn't done being revealed... There's a lot of chances we see a new Bloodsail Cultist, Naga Corsair, or Phantom Freebooter, where the pirate gets buffed by the weapon or buff the weapon.
---
New Pirate Warrior will be Control based...
---
In this rabbit hole of Uber mind games, the rogue just won't end their turn with a 1 durability kingsbane equiped ;)
---
Give him a break the meme is like 10 years old

Why is this an epic?
---
**Battlecry:** Yoink!
---
If we're going wild, [[Mirage Caller]] and [[Herald Volazj]] also.
---
So basically no spell damage or ALL THE SPELL DAMAGE (malygos). Warlock hasn't really ran spell damage in the past outside of the defile tainted zealot combo.
---
Just make them all 3 for consistency. It's not like having extra space costs anything.

---
Hey CreepyMosquitoEater, gonna work on adding in some other minions to help scale late game and or in battle and bring all these cards together hopefully. Thanks for your feedback.
---
I've tried to build a spectral cutlass deck but had swingy results. Mind showing me your deck code?
---
Don't you love how, in the midst of all these insanely overtuned cards, Priest gets a Volcanic Potion?
---
I mean, yeah, I'm happy that we now have an early board clear, but after seeing all the other ridiculous cards that other classes get, this just feels crappy.  Gotta love how they actually think about balance for Priest cards while they throw it out the window for other classes.
---
Warlock gets a Duskbreaker on steroids, while Priest gets a reprint of Assassinate and Volcanic Potion.
---
This should be 3 damage.
---
I am playing deathrattle taunt nzoth rogue 2 shadow steps and 1 togwaggle scheme xD
---
Did this woosh me or do yo u not realize he's playing warlock.
---
me take... ME TAKE!!!
---
Whats the deal with showing only 1 Shaman card?
---
Happens to me, too. Thought it was an issue with my Internet. Now I see it's a general problem
---
Compare it to alley cat at 1 star
---
The thing with Deathwing and Ysera is that you might want to hold one of the drops anyways. An 8/8 plus one random Dragon is still nothing to sneeze at on board, and a 0-mana resource in hand is also *pretty nice*. If I were playing Alex, I'd only really be sad about getting DW/Ysera if I got two DWs or Yseras.
---
I'm guessing you tried to come up with numbers  that show what you want and that aren't ridiculous, but gave up because that's not happening.  
---
I'm not ignoring anything, that's you. I'm not saying there is no effect, I'm saying it won't be as big as you're making it out to be. Even your "fact" about " all these artificial systems make place for weaker players" doesn't say jack shit about *magnitude*.  
---
&gt; Again, just create an alt account and you'll see. Or ask anyone who did.
---
Again, what are you implying I will see?   
---
Also wtf dude. How much time does it take to come up with numbers for the breakdown vs how much does it take to get to those ranks on a new account? You're being totally ridiculous.
---
He who stickyfingers last, stickyfingers best
---
Yeah with the randomness of attacks it's actually very hard. You sometimes lose games that you couldn't ever imagine being lost.
---
As of now (assuming stand-alone spells only and no battlecries): 
---
x2 Holy Ripple
---
x2 Spirit Lash
---
x2 Shadow Word: Horror
---
x2 Excavated Evil
---
x2 Holy Nova (lol "board clear")
---
x2 Mass Hysteria
---
x2 Dragon Fire Potion
---
x2 Lightbomb
---
x2 Psychic Scream
---
x2 Plague of Death
---
So right now that makes 20/30 for our deck. You would very likely play Shadowreaper Anduin as well, since not only does it clear large minions but it actually has a small chance at giving you a win condition as well.
---
Rip Harrison Jones
---
What i mean is that after I play him, I no longer have my heal cards
---
There is also the fact that my deck is more of a stall and mill deck to get rafaam, he is effectively my only win condition
---
Volcanic Potion dies out of embarassement :D
---
The new Deathwing also absolutely does not belong in C lol. Being able to play that at any time for 0 mana is crazy. There‚Äôs a few questionable choices here
---
Do YOUR deathrattles activate for your opponent?
---
Can't Rogue then just run 2 copies of this as well, to end up with Kingsbane anyway lol

Why put in any effort in making this chart at all then? You included wild minions (which most of us don't care about) and the text is barely readable at all (which honestly, makes the entire chart useless to begin with)
---
I actually bet it will be the first one and it will be a shaman weapon
---
Hey therealsneakyturtle, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
But that would mean the only viable build late game would only be murlocs with a ridiculous amount of hp or elementals 
---
Which makes battlegrounds very unfun (esp higher up when everyone knows that‚Äôs the only way to win) 
---
If beasts and mechs got ways to increase their health (outside of magnetize and amalgam) then maybe this card could be allowed but otherwise it just doesn‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôll stick at all
---
Yeah I feel like the past is somewhat romanticized in this post. Undertaker was a T1 win con, and Patron Warrior only lost when the person playing the deck didn‚Äôt know how to pilot the deck. Im pretty sure patron in legend has the highest winrate in HS history
---
My conspiracy theory is that some reddit admin bot just does this randomly to try to make "multi-award meme" go viral to promote Reddit Premium.
---
HAHAHAHA this is the trolliest tech card of all time
---
This only works in mage unfortunaterly, since kalecgos will only discover mage spells if you are a mage.
---
Like with an exploit or something?
---
&gt;multiple other people running demons 
---
Never go full demon.
---
&gt; Patches for instance might be the worst character in the game. 
---
Patches definitely isn't the worst, that would go to Togwaggle/Pyramad/Finely, the chance at popping Divine Shields is way more useful than an extra stat.
---
Also no way you could play a 5 mana 4/4 vs aggro kingsbane and live. They also play a bunch of minions and would just kill you with them if you did that lol.
---
I think you‚Äôre taking reddit a little too seriously, friend. I just like to post about things that interest me, I don‚Äôt think there should be any big deal over what ‚Äúwarrants‚Äù a reddit post. I just wanted to have a little discussion over what people thought Shaman would be getting this expansion. I admit I worded it a little bit poorly.
---
Flavor win
---
Shaman makes sense with the hammer. Paladin already has two legendaries, but it could also just be a lower rarity weapon.
---
Cries in kingsbane
---
That is a super cool niche card with a powerful effect that will probably never see play.
---
k
---
We'll look into it... Uh.... Thank you
---
Maybe they concede because of the smart moves...
---
Id bet good money they code her so she can't chain herself.
---
[deleted]
---
Ehh, I dunno, it's not my favourite. Maybe my secondth.
---
this wouldn't trigger deathrattles right? only official weapon silence in the game
---
history buff saw play in highlander paladin before the doom in the tomg event
---
You're right! Edited.
---
Ya but you also lose a draw making it more likely you miss the one drop and the quest reward is tempo witch is not helpful once you have lost the board.
---
Wha-
---
I stand by a lot of what I said, but I had not considered the fact that it means they have less playable options available to them after rotation compared to classes with a stronger classic set, and the way that cripples Priests ability to stay relevant and competitive. Thanks for that insight.
---
To have nicer looking pixels
---
It is hardcoded so they can't spawn themselves.
---
This will probably be unbalanced
---
The total attack power scales quickly.
---
N * (3 + 3(N - 1)) = 3N^2
---
That gives:
---
3, 12, 27, 48, 75, 108, 147
---
So even just getting 3 of these out with a tundra rhino would be 29 charge damage.
---
Hey, but sometimes tempo is important! I've attacked with my Lyra plenty of times. Also, consider the possibilities with elemental evocation for a big miracle turn! It'll be fun at the very least.
---
To add to that, I \*think\* each type of pack (classic, TGT, GvG, etc.) are also all on separate pity timers. So opening 39 dry classic packs doesn't mean you'll get a legendary if you open a Witchwood pack after that.
---
Known as Kobold Zipperman in North America
---
it's more of a wow thing
---
Is this signs of a ‚Äúdiscover a pirate‚Äù card coming?  
---
Because this feels very niche.
---
Muu!
---
still worst theyve ever done,nerfed for 1 deck they were already nerfing 2other cards for and nerfed evry rogue spell forever(and they had even considered hof'ing it at start of year  but dedcided against it so makes it even worse)
---
And just run rafam
---
Oh Holy Brode, watch over us plebs in our time of need. You are gone but not forgotten. Praise be.
---
And prep,and nerfed evry rogue spell for ever,and dint buff any spells even though they were balanced and made around old prep
---
Jesus dude calm down, tavern brawl isn't the only game mode
---
I just crafted golden Kingsbane. Kill me.
---
Because the kind of person that looks at a chart like this is usually familiar with the cards and doesn't need to be babysat like yourself. Don't say stuff like "most of us". I don't want to be associated with your stupidity.
---
I mean, "pregnant" is sometimes abbreviated as "preggo" (Google says it's Australian - though apparently the Brits have the "preggers" equivalent), and I'd imagine there are others examples out there, so I don't think it's "this community" in particular, it's just a way of saying things more easily. I think "Lego" is more reasonable as an abbreviation for "Legendary" than "Leg", and it's easier than "Lege" or "Legend". Could use "Leggy", I suppose. I've heard that said before.
---
I‚Äôll take your hole stock
---
Keep showing me how your username is a literal description of you. I just explain the observed phenomenon. You're zeroing down on just one factor of artificial player boosting. The math's really complicated and guesswork doesn't help.
---
You get the chance to play the yseras?
---
Sometimes when you quickly calculate something you forget about reality.
---
If you‚Äôre counting /r/ArenaHS, you should probably also count /r/CompetitiveHS, /r/customhearthstone, and /r/BobsTavern; I see Mike Donais post in all three quite often.
---
What goal post did I move?
---
One of them is never going to be bought anyways
---
Its draw 3 attached to 6 damage for 3 mana.
---
Yes it's good enough. Lol.
---
Does this also work on lich king‚Äôs weapon? Can anyone reply to this when you find out?
---
Does this steal and equip or steal and into hand ?
---
hunter has a card that reduces the cost of a random beast card by 5
---
Moorabi support
---
What about Sneed's old shredder?
---
Can sneeds spawn a ghastcoiler?
---
Must be a typo. Should clearly be called Hunter Beast.
---
Paladin dragon synergy cards
---
The shades make em look like they're having a heckin' good time!
---
Imagine if this had echo
---
To be fair, within warcraft paladins are "holier" than priests. The light magic they summon comes from directly within them rather than being called upon. Its why undead can wield holy magic as priests but can't be paladins with 1 npc exception. Priests also have a duality within their powers that paladins lack.
---
Ghastcoiler is not legendary, so no
---
This hasn‚Äôt been the case for so many expansions. Every expansion has incredibly OP epics that are build around cards. Ever since the fucking grand tournament when they made that OP dragon an epic, not a ‚Äúspecial or niche‚Äù card at all
---
hearthstone has always been a "what if", see old gods' lore hatred bandwagon for more info on that.
---
well, original mill kingsbane rogue got REALLY hit with the leeching poison nerf.
---
Kingsbane aggro rogue then appeared and was pretty good untill raiding party and prep nerfs. I dont know how could you play the original mill kingsbane deck without leeching poison tbh
---
I think Skyfin, as it is called, will be a shaman legendary; likely of the dragon theme as opposed to tribe (I don‚Äôt know how im supposed to react to a murlock dragon flight). Having said that, I‚Äôm not sure what form shaman dragons will take, so perhaps a murlock dragonflight will be the fate that will dominate future hearthstone. Crabs are the only thing that can save us now.
---
50%. Either you do, or you don‚Äôt.
---
But Most of these cards have conditions that if not met will not clear the board.
---
Aww, lol so since it doesn't have a rarity, or cost, and can't spawn itself. Nothing can generate it?(except reborn/Bob's tavern)
---
Currently 35 cards in Standard including the ones revealed so far. Given that it doesn't matter which Dr. Alexstrasza gives you Alex, Kalec or Maly, the first roll is 2 \* 1/35 \* 3/35. Second Dr. Alex roll is 2 \* 1/35 \* 1/35. About 0.0008% if I did the math correctly, assuming you're holding Pyroblast.
---
May the best lucky Guess win m8 :D.
---
Cheers
---
Ok
---
In wild, pretty high. Cyclone Quest mage (Time Warp, not the new shit quest) caps its curve at 4 mana, ignoring Giants. You have a ton of 0-2 cost spells.
---
The simple principle is that the person who makes the claim should support the claim. You have provided 0 evidence to support the magnitude of the effect you claim. Magnitude is not self apparent, even if the effect might be, nor can you just wave your hand over it like you're trying to do.
---
None of the objections you gave is a reason let alone a good reason for you not to answer "Does a player playing 100 games at a 50% winrate and gaining *on average* 20 stars sound ridiculous to you or not?". Just answer it. It's not that hard. You know the answer is yes so you're avoiding it.
---
You keep saying that the math is too complicated, but what exactly would you calculate? What would you even want to show? You don't need to get an exact accurate number, I said that ages ago. **This is how you approach this stuff for a quick result that would be much more meaningful than anything you've actually provided. Guesstimated results are better than your gut feeling**. I said play with the numbers. You don't have to do one calculation, make a formula, change it up a bit, you'll see that the magnitude you proposed will seem ridiculous in the end.
---
I understand the compounding effect you're talking about. I am not denying it's existence, just that the magnitude of the effect you're proposing exists is ridiculous.
---
You need 20 stars improvement each month just to maintain your peak, let alone to move up over multiple months and vacate the ranks you propose would be vacated by such players. A couple games a day is quite a small amount for the effect your propose to have the magnitude you propose. 
---
But you're just gonna ignore this as well, again, because you don't care how ridiculous the stuff you're saying is, you just gotta wave your hand and that's enough for evidence for you.
---
I'm going to pull this off only to realize that I coined out alex
---
You still can idiot, blizzard can just not make useless cards epics in a blatant attempt to get more money out of people
---
STICKYYYYY FINGAAAAAS
---
Dragon Speaker will certainly be an auto-include in every paladin deck with a dragon package,+3/+3 to several minions consistently is incredibly strong.
---
On that note, if I play Galakrond then complete a quest, will invoke trigger quest powers (Or DIE INSECT)?
---
Then get shafted
---
Am I the only one who thinks the 2nd is Shalamayne? Could be a Priest weapon, as Anduin has been using the weapon since Varian died.
---
Not sure how a 4/12 with taunt is 2 tiers higher than a 12/12 that clears the board the turn it comes out and 1 tier lower than a 12/12 that does nothing until it dies or a 4/12 that draws you a card at the end of your turn. A questionable tier list.
---
The idea is you get 4th in bad games and don't lose any points and when the RNG is in your favour you get 1st so you only move upwards or stay the same
---
I thought the same thing with the new ysera.  Even 7 less valuable random dragons is a hell of a lot of value when you don‚Äôt have to actually spend a turn or mana playing them.
---
[https://i.redd.it/w594et0who231.jpg](https://i.redd.it/w594et0who231.jpg) Made a similar card 5 months ago, but it was mage specific and only stole the weapon for one turn.  (5 mana 4/4 epic though).  People complained it was too powerful.
---
"His Twitter is in ching chong."

.... There's probably a more tactful way to say that

4000 was the base rating in the beta, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the middle but that‚Äôs what most began at
---
Sick!
---
Take 8 damage for a minion you will probably sell at 10 gold for a better synergy.
---
The only way to find out if this set is healthy for the game or not is to wait and see how it plays out in standard.
---
Other than that its too early to judge
---
Why are his fingers sticky
---
Turn 1 new format otk 100% wild legend confirmed
---
It's slower than Conjurer's Calling though
---
I agree. There were a lot of cards in HS history, which looked great on paper and turned out not so great.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A lot of the cards seem strong, but i also feel that people overvalue some of them. For me it would especially be Rogue's legendary, which is a good card and can shut down some types of decks, but is not as crazy as people make him out to be and Warlock's legendary, who looks to me like a great candidate to be one of the meme cards of the expansion
---
Personally i feel that the best revealed cards so far may very well be the Warlock's 5/5 dragon and Kronx

There's this guy called chris cantelmo who runs a successful business and spends all of his money on reddit gold so he can recruit people for his cult. I'm not joking. Just look up cantelmoism and you'll find out more. This is probably somebody different, but it is very possible that it's Chris.

6000 great 5000 good 4000 decent 3000 trash
---
Maybe you run Nightmare Amalgam and then also have some dragon synergy cards? Probably not, but I'll try it anyway
---
This seems like one of those cards they print specifically to be bad right now, but two sets later there's gonna be a bunch of pirate synergy and everyone's gonna have to craft this card to stay competitive in Standard.
---
Rude.
---
You love to see it, did the opponent concede?
---
I will play 10000 games if it means disappointing a single Kingsbane Rogue
---
After it's first nerf it had a sub-50% win rate and definitely wasn't OP, it was just unbelievable horrible to play against. Every game felt the same because the deck really only had 1 strategy and playstyle and the game really came down to "Did the opponent get lucky and draw his bounce by turn 4 or not?". It had a huge amount of players playing aswell because outside of the quest itself it was quite a cheap deck to craft.
---
I felt like the quest was largely fine up until the Giggling Inventor print but christ, Giggling Inventor with quest, shadowsteps, Zola and Rogue DK was just completely unbearable.
---
against kingsbane and certainly old it would be win.
---
it takes the card their entire deck is build around and they invest tons of cards in away.
---
This against kingsbane is a single card ruining their deck and winning you the game,worse then geist vs jade druid id say,they atleast got previous golems stilll and have pharoasis and can push for dmg with golems + paths and malf hero power. But kingsbane is focused around kingsbane and only kingsbane their entire deck is build to buff it up and this takes it away.
---
That is 100%  a 1card win the game type thing the stickyfinger
---
Yeah the existing freeze cards were limited to a single classic shaman card
---
It‚Äôs a known bug, I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs just visual and you actually got points.
---
He played for like 1 more turn and then concede, it felt really nasty lol.
---
I wish you good luck, friend, on your never ending quest for greatness.
---
1 mana 1/3 weapon is quite ok, too, especially if drawn early. Could be a bit annoying to draw it later, especially if you don't have enough drawing/card generation and topdeck it with an empty hand on later turns. However, rogue being one of the stealing classes, a possibility of buffing it also remains.
---
Nabeshin is a classic.
---
The 9/6? Because it comes down way later and is a deathrattle. Dragonspeaker can come down before most dragons are even playable, and also sports a much better statline. I‚Äôve been running a Dragon Handbuff pally from time to time in wild and it‚Äôs a very game winning card, even without Brann.
---
Wow it's like you put the intended combo in an image and got uvotes. "Guys let's play these invoke cards with these new heroes I think they might work together "
---
Are there any Invoke priest spells that are also board clears though?
---
Too bad a 5-mana 4/4 is too useless for anybody to actually run in constructed...
---
If a single card can win you the game, a single card should be able to lose you the game.
---
Just imagine, now when you are getting Weapon buffs from other classes through "Add x cards to your hand from another class" they arent dead cards anymore!
---
Then don't have a deck where the loss of it means instant loss? That's why cards like dirty rat and unseen sabateur and such exist. To give a fuck you to a deck you don't like playing against. Pretty sure you've seen where people auto concede if their opponent plays a single card to make them lose the game. It's just a thing. Also, it had to be drawn.
---
Kingsbane is hardly a single card, without buffs and cycling  it's fairly useless. It's a control deck.
---
Indeed

Well if they play this first, you can play it last

Even on PC this happens when the queue fails. This happened to me 2 times and both times I had to end task for HS because it got stuck. But on mobile the offline thing happens every time I turn off my phone screen. I do it at work sometimes I need to turn off the screen for only a few seconds but the app decides to disconnect. Is there a workaround for turning off the screen?

A post like this only gets 5 upvotes but then the 200th picture of someone getting the HEARTHSTONE logo midgame will get reddit front page, grr

Warrior will have a strong aggro deck, a strong midrange deck and a strong control deck, making the mulligan a nightmare
---
It would be a tier 2. Golden nets you a card one above your tier, or Max if you are at tier 6
---
Thanks! I did not know that.
---
On the topic of tier ups with daryll.
---
Tier ups cause the shop to offer an extra minion at tiers 2,4,6. This is important because it's easier to buy up the minions you don't want to get hats if the shop has less minions. This means the tech up to 3 is great because it is just as easy to do the dance as it is on 2. The tech up to 4 is good eventually, but worse than for other heroes because it means you can't just buy all the things you don't want to buff at the start of the turn.
---
Similarly the tier up to 5 is a bit better than you might normally expect, and the tier up to 6 is hot garbage.
---
Fuck me... Thanks for letting me know!
---
Yea I‚Äôm at 1300 ish right now, first time I‚Äôve aced up gold for a expansion so I‚Äôm very excited aswell
---
Well Kragg was originally suposed to get patches's effect so....
