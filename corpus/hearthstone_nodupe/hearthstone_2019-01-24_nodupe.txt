I feel as though these past brawls have been a middle finger from Blizzard. "Oh you don't like the fact that the brawl isn't preconstructed? Okay we'll give you cards, but they are all random, have fun you fucking idiots."

---
However, I have had no success in building the archetype on a budget. There are multiple key legendary cards in it - Luna, Leeroy, and Jan'alai - and I cannot figure out any good way to replace them nor have I been able to find any bigger structural changes that would enable a budget version to succeed. It just lacks too much reach.
---
However, as you already have Jan'alai, you might be able to get something done with that core. I have not tested exactly how many of those legendary cards the deck needs to be viable.

Flavor yes, but on a remotely competitve scale, it can burn in hell, like many DKs. It's fine in Wild as you're lucky to see past Turn 6 in most matchups, but it's way too strong in Standard.
---
Yes.
---
Its not really a mistake on his side. I'd say it was more a circumstance of his draw order and my experience against this particular deck.
---
&gt;There are a million shitty mindless games you can go play if you enjoy this kind of stupidity. 
---
There are, but only one of them is Hearthstone.
---
Alain?
---
Seems like Blizzard doesn‚Äòt want to invest much work into the game lately... 
---
Yea, I do feel like they could speed them up a lil, but we will see=/
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; a middle finger from Blizzard
---
That implies Blizz is mad at us; if that were they case, they could always just shut the TB mode down. or take away the weekly reward packs, which originally were meant as "just the first few months, to build hype" but I guess it was a smarter move to not change things
---
Saying that explosive runes is a poorly designed card because you can‚Äôt play around it is like saying nearly all hunter secrets are poorly designed cards because you also can‚Äôt play around them.
---
Eg
---
Snipe (can‚Äôt play around, same logic in your post)
---
Explosive trap.
---
MAYBE PALADIN
---
strictly speaking, this is the first time we've had "ShiftCon *West*"; as I noted, the regular "ShiftCon" format has showed up 5 (or 6) times previous
---
Anduin is also obnoxious, especially with pre-nerf Raza. There's a reason why Control and Resurrect Priest both still run him.
---
*it is known*
---
&gt; Everyone was just so excited and busy the new MTG Arena expansion to revisit the HS subreddit.
---
fixed that for ya  ;-)
---
This is why i use dire frenzy on a lifedrinker after going to fatigue with hemet.
---
Got shudderwock :( 
---
I don‚Äôt really enjoy that deck but I stuck him in my elemental hagatha deck just bc and I haven‚Äôt played him yet but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs even worth keeping. 
---
The difference between them dwindles by the day
---
Sounds like someone just lost to explosive runes and got salty. 
---
Really nicely edited together. 
---
What are you talking about? Obviously the most OP card is the OG Patriarch himself. Nothing can beat him
---
Pretty neat deck. What's your gameplan for the first five turns?
---
I agree completely that the card is busted. The main issue I have is how it interacts with divine shield. Considering DS minions can take unlimited damage and not die, it seems to me that ER should spend all 6 to kill the minion and zero goes face. I think an adjustment like that would keep the flavor of the card intact while also creating some form of counterplay.
---
fixed -- thanks, friend
---
Hero card was a mistake
---
Lol! I can only imagine. Might've been a bit of a stretch, and a lengthy one at that. 
---
This is just a screenshot of posts from a previous (best brawl of all time) brawl.
---
Crap, beat me to it! 
---
Good tech choice for Spell hunter meta
---
I've just went 0-5 with god damn hunter decks FUCK YOUR EXPLOSIVE SHOT FUCK YOUR SPELLSTONE WOLF BASTARDS FUCK YOUR ARSE CUNTING DEATH STALKER REXXAR I HATE YOU DON'T CALL THIS NUMBER AGAIN 
---
It is.
---
1+3=3 ??? 
---
Just asking if anyone else is seeing anything is all. 26 times in a row is pretty unlikely. Even if it were 80% likely to get a 50 quest on a given roll, the likelihood of 26 80% hits in a row is 0.3%.
---
It's likely just a fluke, I know, but I just thought I would ask.
---
On a related note: my opponent: https://i.imgur.com/TPerT1n.jpg
---
Yeah, it was a really underwhelming card at the time. Even if it did see play in a few dude focused paladin decks. 
---
Quartermaster did the same thing -minus the taunt- but also gave you a decent body worth about 3 mana. And I would have never considered that broken at the time. 
---
A more random but easier to achieve Grand Strategos
---
Chill, he just wanted an explanation on what‚Äôs going on.
---
Remember jains isnt neutral
---
Why?
---
I played 2 keleseths today before I remembered that. 
---
What about countering this DK only deck?
---
Fuck that card
---
Lol ! I always enjoy savefile streams something always happens üòÉ
---
Good call on Shaman, and Rogue has a bonkers classic set.
---
But personally, seeing Rogue lose Vilespine?  Got dayuuummm the class will never be the same.  
---
Interesting I'll try this!
---
Ahhhhh yeah I remember that. Couldnt remember if it was meta or not.
---
Dark times.
---
I'd say the cards in the expansions in 2017 have been pretty weak, but 2018 expansions like rumble are pretty op. This year they seem to have printed some more powerful cards with Rumble so you can see the new decks that came out of December's expansion like holy wrath paladin. Mostly the Classic cards are just a bit weaker right now but they will probably come back next year with the rotation. 
---
That's fair. I hold the unpopular opinion that gonk/odd druid is only a few strong cards away from viability. And I also think that will be especially true after rotation. To be fair, I'd guess it'll be tier 2, but still. I also predict that even/pirate rogue will take off. It's fun, and with the right cards it can take off quickly. 
---
&gt; Whoever designed this should get stage 4 cancer.
---
Really ?
---
Wicked Skeleton is pretty good too
---
Ok so I checked and I see no sets below Classic and Basic
---
Okay, but how are you going to make sure the Warlock has no cards left while having the resources to build a board? Those Voidlords aren't gonna go away for free. 
---
The thing that makes Gul'dan so frightening is that his battlecry forces you into an endurance match while his hero power wins endurance matches.
---
My favorite is using Greedy Sprite in Burgle Rogue.
---

---
I will show quest, but you go first. Check my message history for reliability.
---
The other 124 times you draft Mad Hatter will probably go a bit better then.
---
I just started playing the game not to long ago so if I never participated in that event does it just not show up?
---
Are you looking in your collection outside of deck building or within deck building?
---
Similar to reasoning of ygo but stronger
---
Well here we go I learned two thing's today.
---
Anduin is kinda different in that his hero power doesn't really provide "infinite value". 
---
The board-wide Shadow Word: Death is some pretty silly bullshit though.
---
Don't grind just play, I felt like that too but with time I started playing with my friends and just enjoying taverns and arena. Just take a break, you been playing since GvG remember is a game that should be fun
---
xd
---
There is always these resident sleeper meta decks and Blizzard doesn't do enough to have an out against them. 
---
I click ‚ÄúMy Collection‚Äù then I click ‚ÄúCrafting‚Äù, and then when I click the sets button on the bottom left all that shows is ‚ÄúStandard Cards, Rumble, Boomsday, Witchwood, Kobolds, Frozen Throne, Un‚ÄôGoro, Classic, and Basic‚Äù
---
Unpopular opinion, but to include beasts from new expansions was a mistake.
---
Topdecking **Lifesteal**, **Rush** and **Echo** makes almost impossible to win against Hunter.
---
I can‚Äôt really think of any other time where I would‚Äôve rather top decked a Snowflipper Penguin than a Deathstalker Rexxar on turn 6..
---
You can actually see the defile played 40 seconds into the clip. I lost super hard! :P
---
I don't think it's possible to roll the same quest you completed until 5 days later, so the odds should be a bit lower.
---
Wonder how strong a card would be that were Battlecry: Discover a copy of a 1/1 Battlecry Minion. It costs (1).

---
Way too powerful, they wouldn't be able to print anything else for the same slot
---
Done
---
Odd paladin is still very strong maybe yea it took a huge hit with the 5 mana spell being changed but is still a very viable deck if you like aggro=p
---
Amaz, Kripp, Hafu
---
I can see that. Personally, I like the increased power level
---
Like I said though, to each their own. That's why the two formats exist. :)
---
I wish all the animations were doubled.
---
Check out trump's milhouse pala deck :V
---
I thought so too, but my friend got an other mage  spell from this minion.
---
Of course not.
---
I'd absolutely hate so see mana wyrm at 1 mana again. That card has been oppressive for far too long. It's everything a 1-drop should not be, game winning when played on turn one.
---
Might just be personal bias but tempo mage was one of the most Un-fun and un-interactive decks to play against, felt similar to old pirate warrior. 
---
I know, but the hero does drop below 0 hp, so this does counter the point made previously, which is what I meant to do.
---
It's like that. I had the idea to use this thing with Hunting Mastiff to complete the quest. Worked for the first Mastiff I played, sadly I then remembered that echo cards doesn't keep buffs after the first play.
---
The dude is the mayor of valuetown. Don't talk about him that way.
---
Except that's not the case with lifesteal weapon; the trap clearly triggers before after attacks is declared but before it hits. It doesn't really matter whether both minion and hero attacks are treated one way or the other, but it needs to be consistent and this isn't.
---
Honestly the fact that players have to test out these things and find game mechanics online is sad in itself. How hard is it to do like Sid Meier and add a "Hearthopedia" ingame so we can look up game mechanics by pressing F12.
---
Alexstrasza, mark my words.
---
Although blizzard has nerfed cards, I can't really remember any buffs. other than side effects of nerfs.
---
The amount of damage this card helps prevent is insane sometimes.
---
If Hunter didn't have the Immune while attacking tag on this, they would be a LOT easier to kill for Tempo classes like Rogue. 
---
That just sounds broken though
---
He sees some play in tempo rogue
---
Definitely mountain giant, you need big minion
---
Nah that happened to me too, no virusses. But try out malwarebytes, they are great for scanning your comp for virusses.
---
For real, though
---
Well I don‚Äôt have a problem with hunter. I have a problem with the DK, play dead, spell stone and candle shot. 
---
Yeah. We all loooove it. Soooooo good. Feels greeeeat playing hunter after hunter after hunter after hunter

Exactly!
---
True! 
---
I haven't seen odd warrior at all for a few days now I come to think of it.
---
I disenchanted Nat the Darkfisher this week but it still gave me shivers. Back when I started Hearthstone I had no idea what disenchanting meant, or how you basically get 0.25 legendary back...and I ended up disenchanting cards like Al'Akir :-(.
---
Even now you often see legendaries suddenly get played because they get enabled by newly printed cards. This is why I almost never disenchant cards that are not golden. If I have golden cards, atleast I can recraft them for the same amount of dust! This tends to work for me up until now and even gives me the ability to play wild. After 2 years and quite some money spent (~175,-) I have pretty much access to any deck I want to play, from odd rogue to reno lock.
---
Same.
---
It is kinda weird considering the card get buff while dead and if created by other effects before
---
Got "win 5 games" last week
---
Yeah but it's one mana less, one card less, and doesn't require a 2 card combo.

what would you replace snipe with?

Witchwood ofc. It has the main synergy of the year- odd and even decks. And as was said below, there will be some bundles 4 sure, mb invest in em. Blizzard often have smth to "shut up and take my money"))
---
thanks so much, incredibly helpful video.
---
I've been sitting on a nozdormu for way too long not sure if I'd regret it if I dusted him at some point 
---
Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm sure you have all the required skills to play at Legend rank. Hell, why even stop there? When are we seeing you at HCT?
---
This is why I typically don't dust crap legs... I don't wanna pull em again while I'm trying to get the last couple good ones!
---
It was actually one of the highest deviation cards in the vS pre-release poll. Meaning it was one of the cards people had the most split opinions on. A lot of people thought it was good and a lot of people thought it was bad.
---
Umbridge was worse, yes, but she literally tortured a fifteen-year-old on-screen so that's not a high bar to clear. Snape verbally bullied Harry, Neville, and Gryffindors in general *constantly* (to the point that even when Harry did absolutely nothing wrong, Snape couldn't *not* throw in a jab about how his potion was "against all odds... adequate")*,* in addition to regularly punishing them for things that were not their fault (a Gryffindor losing points for "breathing too hard" comes to mind)*.* Besides which, "being hard on your students" is *not* a mindset anyone should have if they're working with vulnerable 11-year-olds.
---
&gt; He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth - she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down hast her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back.
---
&gt;Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, 'I see no difference.'
---
&gt;Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
---
The guy was just an asshole.
---
many of them will never be played, so it's quite inefficient not to dust any.
---
the notion that you might pull them again in place of better one if you dust them is also not really valid, almost nobody pulls that many packs for that to be a costly worry long term and if they do they probably have every card anyways.
---
you'll end up with a lot of dust being unused sitting in the collection forever
---
you're welcome, nozdormu should always be dusted, just a waste to hold on to him unless you want to play meme decks
---
Got one 1-2 weeks ago
---
I swear to god this sequence exclusively made me quite playing even lock. It seemingly defies odds.  
---
I'd go gay for my boy trump
---
What others said. It's not bannable to take advantage of a game mechanic, even if you're being a dick about it. 
---
My advice is to just not waste your time with these guys. Concede and move on. 
---
Again someone tries to create universal deck. The only class which can afford it is Hunter(and old CubeLock). Casual Quest Odd Warrior is better. 
---
Either another freezing trap, or a snake trap if you have it.
---
I'm not sure what you would consider a satisfactory answer. It's a card game. Sometimes you don't have your good cards and your opponent has theirs. You will not win every game. Your line of reasoning seems to go to a position where you will never have any good cards and the opponent will always have a perfect hand, and that is just not how any of this works.
---
You can play around Rexxar by not having everything die to two damage. Odd Paladin can rebuild the board even from meager beginnings, it has the technology!
---
You are not always vulnerable to Defile even if you have one-health minions on the board. You can cut the chain later, for example by not having any two-health minions on the board.
---
If you are concerned about a board clear and cannot play anything sticky on the board, evaluate whether you need to go all-in to have a chance to win the game - win if they don't have it, lose if they do - or whether you can afford to hold something back to help you rebuild. You always have your Hero Power, use it liberally.
---
Combined, yes, what that is saying is you can't be offered a first or second selection that is more than 5 mana. IE you can never pick highmane for half of your beast because it's 6 mana
---
ow man that sucks on al'akir.
---
darkfisher is definitely a safe dust.
---
I agree with you though, some cards end up seeing play and those are the ones that we didn't give a definitive verdict on. cards like graal the shark that have a largely unexplored effect and thereby the potential to work in the future.
---
but there's also cards that simply will never be good with near 100% certainty like millhouse, splintergraft, celestia etc
---
and you're right on golden cards, those should always be dusted.
---
maybe after putting some amount of money into the game the most efficient dusting isn't as big of a worry anymore 
---
Not one to do this I‚Äôm patient with my opponents rope timers, but if you can‚Äôt beat them join them. If it annoys you so much maybe it will annoy them too. 
---
Don't disenchant anything before it moves to wild. That's the only advice you should follow.
---
So many cards that were considered useless have become strong. 
---
I personally keep everything though because I want to keep it for wild.
---
The card you really hate is tracking. 
---
Ginomanx3#1254 NA 80g quest trade, you go first
---
Snowflipper penguin actually makes the deck better, definitely a must-craft-golden card.
---
They are always there.  Cthun buffs do work without him, or did at least, its most likely a bug with shifter 
---
dies on page 596.
---
I dropped an 11/11 Obsidian Statue on a Hunter. He understandably uses Munter's Mark &amp; Candle. I got no health from Lifesteal.
---
So unfair &gt;:(
---
what are you doing with bad classic legends like millhouse and nozdormu?
---
If you want to play wild then you should definitely keep all the (playable) cards after they rotate out, our guide is not taking rotation into consideration because many people do play wild occasionally
---
Very. It took prep, raider party, defias ringleader, bladed cultist, swashburgaler (which gave me bite weed), cointerfiet coin, counterfeit coin, coin, swashburgaler, Bite weed. Don't think this combo is happening again.
---
Poor little odd paladin
---
Oh and he killed it right after
---
Is this on spotify?
---
As a Priest, you should do fine against Hunter without Geist.
---
There aren't many Druids nor Shaman right now and against Mages, Rogues and Palas, Geist is often useless or too late.
---
But it's a fine tech in the mirror maybe. Especially when you can remove the Smites. Its harder to otk for the Clone Priest without Smites.
---
I still wouldn't run Geist these days, I would prefer Mojomaster Zihi against otk. 
---
I imagine the Warlock player was thinking ‚Äúwow, you filled your board with 1/1s, great play, genius‚Äù and then got increasingly rage-filled as the turn developed.
---
Yeah its canceled. They had been saying we are working on it for years. That post confirms it's gone. 
---
After Classic WoW, let's make Classic HS(right after Classic HOTS and Classic Overwatch)
---
&gt;lNcrdzl #2471 if still need
---
He still regularly uploads to his channel
---
I'm pretty sure it's his editor Jens being tongue in cheek and having a little jab at Trump becuase traditionally he'll build a deck and call it a meta breaker only for it to crash and burn. As far as I'm aware Trump has very low involvement on how the content gets presented on youtube. 
---
It's an old copypasta that seems to be making a comeback. Third time I've seen it in the past 24 hours.
---
Clearly the grind to legend has got to him and fried his brains. F to pay respects. 
---
and then the whole room applauded
---
Sorry not following.
---
I'm playing Priest, and the only druid deck I've seen for ages is Hakkar druid, which relies on Naturalise.
---
I disagree completely in dissenchanting Mage quest, Liam, Kingsbane, Sonya, Azalina, Toggagle and Hemet jungle hunter. Like, except the quest, all those cards were in top tier decks and falled out (if ever) because of other nerfs/shifts in meta, but those cards are still perfectly usable and strong.
---
If you put Floop and Twig as keep, also put as keep azalina and togaggle. Kingsbane in aggro pirate rogue is preeety good in wild, and it will only get better with more weapon buffs/more pirates, since that tribe relies on weapon synergies too. You put Mechathun as keep but put hemet as safe to disenchant, what?? Hemet allows many other classes to play the mechathun wincondition, even if you can play druid or warlock without it, it has proven to have potential in the future too because of his unique effect. Liam has been used in the past in odd paladin (tier 1 deck right now and at the time) and can be used in actual odd paladin in the actual meta too.
---
And in the "it depends" part, you put things like Zerek cloning gallery, The glass knight, Prince 3 and umbra (perfectly competitive cards in the actual meta) alongside others like Swamp king dred, or Lady in white that were never played competitively, nor are right now...
---
Its all messed up. Yeah you got that baku and genn should not be dissenchanted, and that cho and millhouse are shit, but many other cards are completely messed up. Some good tech legendaries are in the dissenchant section, other more specific to the meta like the black knight are in the Keep section (when black knight is not used in evenlock or control lock anymore since there is not that much taunt in the meta right now).
---
I just dont agree much with this list...
---
Great video and stats. 
---
Activision doesnt want people to play Wild.
---
Aaaaaaaand twisting nether
---
You totally ignored the fact that Hearthstone and MtG are opposites in tone and execution and their art accomodates and improves each experience. The dismissal of stylized art just because you don't like it without understanding its context is like saying you abstract art is bad because you don't understanding.
---
Other legendaries like Cenarius that have been bad for a while we're suggested to keep just in case, but that wasn't the case for Jaraxxus even though it's propped up a lot more than Cenarius in the past. At the very least be consistent with your other classic class legendaries.
---
*evolves into doomsayer*
---
How is that even possible!
---
Yeah, I agree with you -- especially about Hooktusk. I also found it weird that he said Lynessa was a definite dust. It's a fringe card for sure, but if you want to play some Control/Exodia Paladin deck with multiple Spikeridged Steeds/Blessings of Kings then you should keep it. Seems more like it 'depends' to me. 
---
Also, the fact that he describes Clone Priest as a fringe deck seems a bit off. It's one of the most dominant decks in the current meta. Overall, I thought the video was pretty good, but I definitely think he was undervaluing a bunch of cards that I would suggest keeping or thinking twice about at the very least.
---
that had to be very interesting game.. Like hit the button -&gt; end turn -&gt; opponent does the same -&gt; repeat -&gt; win for that one who has better RNG.. I used to like quest warr but now it looks like to me like very bad designed card
---
earlier this game i evolved into harbringer celestia and i couldnt any farther and he just played doomsayer :(
---
Ancient of Lore, Keeper of the grove, shattered sun cleric, and dalarian(?) Mage come to mind as potentials for an unnerf and HoF
---
The wolf waits below, hungry and lonely
---
Nature always finds its way
---
I don't think having one card be enough to make a deck powerful is a good idea, in fact, I think is a really terrible idea.
---
The ole Liam take the wheel deck
---
Why? Its good to New players. They can play a good deck for free. 
---
Yep
---
No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not healthy to play only aganst Hunters that smork you to death by turn 7.
---
Stop being so judgmental 
---
but atleast you had choice to play 1 mana 2/2 for rest of the game.
---
*It's about sending a message.*
---
The part about going infinite is largely an exaggeration based on how many times the deck can come back from Standard removal, but the whole point of the deck is to cheat out value. 
---
As such, it is probably the best term to use for the deck seeing as it isn't exactly aggressive, can't really adjust its gameplan like a midrange deck can, doesn't actively attack an opponent's tempo like Rogues and Mages can, and doesn't really rely an a particular combo to work, but can fit into a controlling role more readily than anything really.
---
Oh look, another power hungry asshat that can't appreciate the hard work someone put into something.
---
Stealing victory in Hearthstone with a zero skill RNG play.
---
Shocking.
---
Oh yeah, I don't think so either.
---
But then I think on what they do need to change if hunter is going to be less than 70% of the mega... And it's gotta be that card.  Change cost of candleshot to 2.  Or Hunter's Mark to 3.  Still useful, but not low enough to kill things plus still throw out stuff.
---
Plays hunter in Destiny while Titan is clearly better.
---
Fun fact: In Tempo Rogue on hsreplays Hooktusk has a higher mulligan winrate then Keleseth.
---
Yeah, but even the current combo isn't super overpowered or anything like that. 
---
Oh you mean like the behavior rule of calling people names? lul
---
I have to agree with the article here about Priest, it feels a lot like KnC for the class. It has a polarizing resurrect-based archetype, as well as a well-rounded combo archetype. Control and Combo Priest existed in KnC in the place of Control Priest now.
---
As a Priest fan who was worried about the class's prospects this year, I'm quite happy with how things have turned out. Unfortunately, it looks like rotation will be even worse for Priest than the last one, which was bad enough. I hope we get some good stuff next expansion to make up for that.
---
Bloodreaver Gul'dan is rotating. Obviously you can't make a completely safe prediction if Jaraxxus will be played after the DK's rotate, but at the same time it was literally in every late game deck before the DK's and the overall power level of new cards is dropping. 
---
Neither, really. Just about playable. Might be better when the power level goes down in rotation.
---
With the amount of Priests running around? Plus, what's the upside?
---
There's almost practically infinite design space since new ideas are always being introduced. And something becoming "too consistent in wild" is never going to be a concern.
---
definitely appreciate your comment and I'd agree with what you're saying.
---
we didn't want to say it depends for almost every card so we introduced the probably dust and probably keep categories.
---
I once dusted a grommash and scourgelord garrosh to craft my first ever legend, deathstalker rexxar. I hit rank 5 and 500 wins with a midrange hunter with only that one legend before even touching anything else and after that was able to build and play a lot more decks that I wanted
---
Nax is out?

Yeah, yeah, really good advice. Then, I can complain blizzard is shit because epic are garbage and not impactful.  
---
This endless complaining was only suppressed after primordial glyph and shadow vision. Before that, it was everywhere. 
---
It's when the next expansion hits, which if history holds true will be early April. Un'goro, Frozen Throne and Kobolds will all be rotating to wild.
---
Sure, mirrors are most skillful matchups.
---
Why do you care what dudes look like on YouTube videos?

As long as i'm not calling you names based on your "race, gender, age, occupation, physical or mental health, or opinions about Hearthstone", It's not against the rules.

Dragon Shaman w/ Shudderwock is one of the most fun decks to play right now. 
---
It's not great, but it's not terrible either. You can get rank 5 with it.

"We gave you guys such impressive meta breaking proactive cards like Surrender to Madness and Glitter Moth, what more you do you people want?"

This won't make a difference in Legend grinding, considering it truthfully starts at rank 4.

What is the highest you've gotten and how long have you played?

S/he is memeing that Druid is so low tier now that people have forgotten what a Druid is.

Lul it's incredible how much you interperpret into a joke.

That's a great point and we may end up doing that.  He has a few legendaries from various launch events, but his collection is limited, to say the least.  The benefits of starting fresh at L50 outweigh no Toki. :)
---
Could have been me if they played Luna's Pocket Galaxy later on. Also if I kept popping your Deathlords/Undatakahs for 2/2 Shifters
---
The comments in this thread really show that this sub either suffers from poor reading comprehension or memory loss. Everyone is conveniently ignoring or forgetting that we still only go back 4 ranks at the beginning of the month, so it's not a reversal to the previous system. 
---
Putting more casuals at rank 10 makes it easier for non casuals to climb out of 10.  Easier competition.
---
This effect ripples forward (people who were stuck at 10 now reach 9, making the 9 rank easier, etc) but like real ripples, the effect diminishes the farther you go.  By the time you look at rank 1 there is not going to be any discernible difference.  If we had access to the statistics, though, we'd probably be able to show a somewhat higher number of people hitting legend.
---
ye and they remedy that by adding 24 new ranks (50-26)
---
the idea was fine, they just found a better way to achieve the same result. 
---
Its nice that they revert back to the older system.
---
It will definitely help me.
---
I only play Wild midrange and control homebrew decks, so I spend most of my time between rank 20 and 16. I lose almost every game against aggro unless I get good draw.
---
If those aggro decks can exit my shit tier quicker and leave me alone against other shit tier homebrew decks, then that's a win for me.

Ranked Play Update ‚Äì A Faster Climb (Excerpt from 2020)
---
&gt; Hearthstone is a difficult game for millennials. We want to say we recognize the pain and suffering players go through when attempting to climb ladder ranks. Instead of spending extra money on therapy for your ladder anxiety, we want you to focus spending that money on more packs. We also want to say hard work and dedication is overrated. Learning the meta is for chumps. We‚Äôve noticed how tournaments consists of same hardworking professional players year in and year out. To combat this, we are making the ladder climb even easier for the future generation of Hearthstone.
---
&gt; Starting February, you will now climb 1 rank per win. The star system will be removed, instead you will receive a murloc cosmetic sticker for your card backs upon reaching rank floors (20, 15, 10, 5). The stickers intent is to provide a sense of pride and accomplishment, and also invigorate how you feel about the difficult ladder climb. What‚Äôs that? You don‚Äôt like the new syst‚Äìoh look! A cool murloc sticker! Wow! That sure looks good on you, kiddo!
---
&gt; This revamped laddar system will allow new faces to emerge in tournament scenes. Adhering to our ‚ÄúRNG is fun‚Äù philosphy, new unknown casual players means more ‚Äúinverse‚Äù RNG to combat the already saturated pool of professional players that occupy the ladder space. We feel that this is fair. We feel that good plays are too consistent and we want to incorporate bad plays to create a more dynamic and interesting viewer experience.
---
Overall I gotta agree.  What would you say has been historically the "healthiest S-tier" deck?  Sure as heck wasn't Shamanstone, Huntertaker, or "Nunnayabizness" Paladin.
---
Those are just the best versions of the best decks. E.g. in even paladin almost all legendaries can be replaced with winrate not taking a big hit, barring Genn Greymane (of course). 
---
Old guardian makes fantastic videos with budget versions of meta decks and during the video goes through the upgrade path, where he shows which cards are the most impactful.
---
Yea I've no idea what this guy's on about. If anything, the previous system reduced the ladder grind time for anyone who wasn't a brand new player, ie. pretty much anyone who actually cared about climbing ladder. This just reduces it *even more* for people in lower ranks. 
---
&gt; I‚Äôm skeptical about them making the 50-25 climb faster. Watching this subreddit, new players when they get to 25 are generally still in for a pretty rude awakening.
---
Making that climb slower won't change anything. It's still going to be mostly all beginners at ranks &lt; 25, and suddenly a lot of meta decks the moment they hit 25. They'll never be "ready" however long they keep beating up other beginners.
---
People with strong decks(rank 25-10) are suppose to rank up faster as well, so it might even out.
---
Well, as a 15-10 rank player, always nice to hear
---
I got my hopes up that they had made the rank 5 to legend grind less tedious. Maybe next year.
---
Where did you read they removing rank floors?
---
What you said isn't a joke in any way. 
---
Fusetea#2520 EU 80g Quest trade, you go first ( check history , done it before  ) 
---
I'm hot n' ready for this to rotate out.
---
If you have the option, the refresh mana with armor Druid‚Äôs shrine is one of the best IMO
---
Nope he still destroyed me
---
Word of the day: Fuck
---
Looks like best option is to play your best shrine and hope you fight zentimo closer to the beginning 
---
I completely gave up on the Mode by now. When it launched, my first run ended at 7 wins. I haven't even gotten there again yet. It is way too frustrating and reliant on rng overall to be enjoyable for me. I actually like the cardback, but there's no way I'm going to grind this just for a single cardback. Boomsday on the other hand I cleared completely just because it was actually FUN to clear. Same with dungeon run, played like 200 of them. The monster hunt is okay, can be frustrating as well tho. But the rumble run is definitely the WORST and most uninspired content they've put out. 
---
Well it's pretty good that there's just Thanks, Well Played, Greetings, Wow, Oops and Threaten. Imagine how toxic the games would be otherwise!
---
Have you tried it since it was nerfed?
---
"And then we doubled It"
---
Out of curiosity: have you guys considered covering magic arena content?
---
Thank you. I will save this comment and remember you while I grind on. 
---
Oh, uhh want to edit your reply? Lol
---
The whole point of shadowbans is that the one that‚Äôs banned doesn‚Äôt know their banned.
---
This was a lot like how it was before the ranked change, so it seems like both climbing and retaining ranks when the season changes will be a lot easier, not that I'm complaining. 
---
I'm not sure why I am getting downvoted for it... getting to rank three shows that you can rank up at high levels without help of bonus stars. so you have the base skill required. Just need the time to actually focus and do it in the month provided.
---
no i resigned before 
---
I just meant the expansion alley cat is in. Must've misremembered as I said, it's been awhile since I've played. 
---
Kids are dumb and easily influenced. Kids can easily influence their parents. Their parents have credit cards. Credit card numbers are what Actibli$$ want the most at the end of the day.
---
Agreed. If they just gave them a background color it would already make a difference.
---
&gt;How about trade off cards? Heal your opponent for 10 but they cannot cast spells next turn. Or give your opponent a 10/10 taunt that can't attack or be targetted but they shuffle 3 cards from their hand into their deck. Or in the same way, how about sacrificial effects like destroy 2 random friendly minions but your opponents cards cost 2 more next turn.
---
Well, the most basic tradeoff in the game is that you have to spend mana, incurring an opportunity cost for what else you can do on your turn.
---
&gt;Spellbreaker is only overcosted by 1 mana.
---
Spellbreaker is basically useless against combo decks because they pull off their combo in one turn anyway. You never have a chance to silence Mecha'thun or Antonidas or Malygos or Velen.
---
&gt;Dirty Rat is even overstatted.
---
It has to be because of the tempo loss on the board. Even as it is, it can be dangerous to play. As a 2/3 it would be essentially unplayable.
---
&gt;Demonic Project costs all of 2 mana and can have uses beyond just fucking combo.
---
2 mana is pretty expensive for something that gets you zero board control and can make your own hand worse.
---
&gt;Mojomaster lets you use your other 4 mana that turn and is only understatted slightly as well.
---
He's a 6-mana 5/5 in a game where the vanilla 6-mana 6/7 sees zero play outside of arena. That's more than a little understatted.
---
&gt;And what you're failing to understand from the other perspective, is some people enjoy it.
---
But we have solitaire games for that. A solitaire game doesn't need to be nominally 'multiplayer'. Unless, that is, your enjoyment comes from wasting somebody else's time. Which I think is a bad sentiment to design a game around. (And if Blizzard *does* want to design their game around that sentiment, they should at least be honest about it.)
---
&gt;What does it matter if the matches play out differently?
---
That's the 'game' part of the game. That's what makes it different from just rolling dice.
---
&gt;why would I want to try that hard just to lose?
---
Because the game is fun while you're playing it. Because you might win next time. Because you can work on your skill to improve your chances of winning next time.
---
&gt;I know he tried, I know he had a glimmer of hope
---
If he's consistently getting a KDR of 20%, he does not have 'a glimmer of hope'.
---
To recycle your own example: If you played a Go master in an even game, with the right kind of strategy you might be able to get 20% as much territory on the board as your opponent. Does that mean you had any chance of winning? Absolutely not.
---
&gt;Suppose you win some award. [...] That award seems pretty meaningless now doesn't it? I mean you worked to achieve it and all but no one cares.
---
I don't think that's a parallel scenario. Nobody else needs to have his time wasted in order for me to get the award. And nobody congratulates you or shares your joy for winning a Hearthstone game, either- you and your opponent are the only ones who ever know it happened.
---
&gt;If you win an award, for it to truly have some meaning you want to know that your parents and spouse are proud of you, that Brian 2 offices down is jealous of you
---
I don't need anyone else to be jealous of me in order to feel fulfilled about an achievement.
---
Ha! Got that "white pawn/black pawn shuffle" hand RNG.
---
Can only think of 3, am I missing one? Zul'jin, Hagatha, Dr Boom.
---
Dr Boom isn't even that great, and my prediction was always that Zul'jin will be horrible after the rotation, unless they print like 3-4 SOLID spells, and this rarely happens. No spellstones, which means secrets are way worse (what you see is what you get, while before it's "what you see + a 3-3 wolf), no To my sides... 
---
What's left? Kill command is terrible with Zul'jin, flanking strike, hunter's mark, all terrible... Tracking is usually detrimental by the point you Zul'jin (drawing 3 cards is bad, and you burn 2 randomly..). And no Rhok'delar, so no incentive to just run spells. 
---
Zul'jin will probably die as soon as the rotation happen, presumably to come back few expansions down the line when more spells are printed.
---
The only one that will still be great is Hagatha imho.
---
Just make new account, you get the excitement of new packs and legendaries for a new player
---
Taking extra cards into rank 50 and the experience of playing would ruin it for other new starters
---
This only helps people that don‚Äôt matter. 
---
Barnes + 2 mana ressurect...
---
2 mana ressurect is as broken as barnes imo
---
I don't care
---
Maybe DK Rexxar. Other cards just do not generate such a big value.
---
You forget about the magic variable of *time*.
---
Legend has been, and always will be, more accessible for those with the time to grind.  Thats why I see legend cardbacks in ranks 15-10 all the damn time.  I doubt many *legend* players simply don't care to put in the time every month.  
---
It doesn't mean they are worse at hearthstone.
---
Opinion discarded. Thanks for playing.
---
Rather then nerfing Baku/Genn I would rather see them moved to HOF this year. To make up for "super-rotating" them, Blizz gives everyone gold copies. As someone that plays Hearthstone consistently, I'm tired of odd/even decks already and conceivably they will continue to be problematic when DKs and KNC rotate.
---
Sometimes you just chose the right deck at the right time and destroy the competition. It's very hard to tell when you are actually playing better than others in this game.
---
Some months I will fly up and past rank 5 barely losing a game, while others it's a 2 steps forward 1.5 steps back situation.
---
All i know for a fact is, everything is much easier during active rather than stale meta's. I put it down to me playing very rarely (like 5 games every second day), i feel that im really good at reading games as they happen, but miss out on that 200+ game history or just knowing exactly what cards they have and when they will play them.
---
In English please?
---
Truth hurts lol
---
That's good.
---
I would say the "to act" and "in order to gain an advantage" support my point that intentionality is key. Regardless, we're arguing semantics. 
---
It's happened to me a few times. FeelsBadMan
---
Thank you. You're the only person here with a response worth reading. You at least seem to "get it."  
---
The "randomness" of their cards is just a little bit too contrived for me to buy that it's totally 'random.' I've had one too many PERFECT DECKS with PERFECT BOARD SETUPS get UTTERLY RUINED by one stupid lucky card draw, that "just in the nick of time or the player would definitely have won this match."  
---
Several times, I lost by one health. Okay, maybe on 10 or so runs out of the 125 I'm now looking at, I played a card too soon or too late. Fine. I'll buy that some of this is due to personal error. But that many losses *in a fucking row*? Again, statistically speaking, I ought to have come across the "winning combination" by now. Instead, I in variably get matched up against a boss that always magically has a deck designed to counter your specific setup.
---
Even if it was all four it still doesn't proc, right? You have to use the hero power to perform the kill?
---
Yeah I was playing at lunch on mobile lol
---
It's how it works. You start the season 4 ranks lower than the highest you reached the previous season.

Who won?

Great job!

I don't think it does. I think that's more to do with Warcraft and it's overall art style, historically, If anything I think that that fun vibrant art style is meant for the 30 something crowd that grew up with Warcraft. Tugging on that nostalgia. 
---
Truth isn't truth.
---
HoF is not a solution.
---
Upvoted! :P
---
Warlock is 4th
---
As Wild player, I wouldn't mind free gold copy, but as a wild player, simply removing them from standard is not a solution. They will just keep warping Wild meta forever if left uncheck.
---
Summon one 2/2 dude? Summon one 1/1 dude with divine shield? 
---
Well, thing of the matter is Firebat already used his hero power, so he couldn't generate anything new that he didn't have, and the requirement for OTK to work is to have four unique riders. Firebat already had Thoras Trollbane on the board and all he really had to do was play Zola on Nazgrim and wait a turn, THEN play all of the riders and use hero power because it always generates riders from the pool of riders that ARE NOT on the board yet.
---
Where have they failed to limit design options for their new cards made after baku and genn were printed?
---
we said in the beginning that we didn't consider whether a card rotates when we judge it and that I recommend dusting the cards once the rotation happens, provided you don't play wild
---
Step 4. Introduce new formats, dare I say a separate ladder. New and casual players are going to be using the same basic/classic cards for a good long while. I have friends who just got into the game, and while I did help them craft cheap powerful decks(such as Odd Pally and Midrange hunter), they can't afford any more than that. One of them wished there was a ladder that only allows basic cards.
---
Step 5. Create more ways to get more packs, even if it means external means such as "liking" Blizzard franchises to earn packs for free. For a few player, every additional pack means much more to them, then it does for players who've been around for years.
---
Step 6. Promos are good. The Classic pack bundle's great, fantastic value. I would like to see a lot more of these. My friends have also asked why Blizzard doesn't sell entire decks, like how other card games do it. They would like to play things like Control Mage, and some of the more expensive decks but don't have a means to do so early on. But I do get the sense that they would be willing to pay for cool pre-packaged decks.
---
&gt;!Hunter.!&lt;
---
Dick move. When I want to make ppl playing some deck miserable, I just counter queue.
---
The most surprising thing here is that this Guy is ruining his game to ruin yours while a ton of other "non acceptable" decks are running loose.
---
Just play exodia mage into Big Priest, you'll have fun (if you like the deck), and maybe even your opponent will.
---
Then why'd you rate clone priest as a "depends" if it's a tier 1 deck????
---
If those statistics you‚Äôre claiming are real are in fact real, then I‚Äôm afraid it is. 
---
Millions of people have played this game mode, and it‚Äôs a safe wager that that losing record is outside of the norm.
---
But if it‚Äôs easier for you to claim that blizzard is rigging the game against you specifically and no one else than it is to admit that you need to improve your decision making and gameplay, then by a means, don‚Äôt let reality stop you.
---
(*Stares at 8th straight loss in comp*)

(*Dusts odd warrior and even warlock*)
---
You do know that floop changes Artwork and everything in your hand, don't you?
---
You need to play a minion while he is in your hand for him to change...
---
Currently Baku and Genn are uneven in the power level so the HS devs team may as well starting at balancing the mana cost. Making they are all at 6 mana seem fair to me
---
Sadly, rank 25 is full of meta netdecks. So at least the change won't make it worse.
---
‚ÄúMan this turn 3 giant is awesome‚Äù candle shot, hunters mark. They always have it.
---
I played Blood Of on turn 9. On turn 10, I played Floop. Didn‚Äôt turn into Blood Of.  Just stayed a 3/4 Floop. 
---
There are still floors, and you still only get knocked back 4 ranks each season
---
Oh really? I always thought that if you play all 4 horseman from hand, if your hero power isn‚Äôt disabled, the OTK would work
---
Did you draw it just then?
---
You win the internet for today XD
---
&gt; Each deck should have its own rank.
---
They're trying to *decrease* tedium, not multiply it. 
---
More like army of the braindead
---
About fucking time.
---
get gud
---
Excuse me what, spell Hunter always plays eaglehorn
---
if they made rank 5-legend easy then everyone would be legend.
---
Playing 5 secrets alone is technically worth 10 mana already. Replaying every secret, as well as Animal Companion, Unleash the Hounds and Deadly Shot certainly seems like a powerful turn 10 play, and it's not like those cards are exceedingly niche.
---
Also, I'd say that while Hunter will likely get fewer spells, I'd be amazed if they don't get at least one or two decent cards that synergize with Zul'jin.
---
He'll be much, much weaker, for sure, but he'll be far from "horrible." 
---
okay i won't rage with stats, but you're basically saying something that is factually wrong and then asking people to ignore it!
---
Also, floop is literally a copy of the last card when he works (except cost and stats)
---
gnomed
---
No, Zerus shifted into Floop on turn 10. Does that matter? I feel like it shouldn‚Äôt since every other battlecry works normally.
---
It's not a battlecry.
---
So Rogue would just get nothing out of playing Baku?
---
I think the main issue with Baku/Genn is their consistency. It turns every game against Odd Paladin into something reminiscent of PVE content as you try desperately to stave off a never-ending flood of 1/1s. Odd Warrior becomes a race to beat their face through infinite armor and a near instaloss for any burn deck, while 2 drops will forever be compared to their ability to withstand a 2/2 dagger (aka 3/2s are pretty ass.
---
HOF isnt a solution because they are as prevalent in Wild, where Even Shaman, Even Rogue, Odd Paladin, Even Warlock, and Odd Warrior all see at least some play. At ranks 4-legend, it becomes absurd, with Even Shaman and Odd Rogue alone making up over a quarter of the meta in [the last data report](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wild-vs-data-reaper-report-15/).
---
That's a rate of 1 in 1024. So every 1024 or so times someone plays 2 cinderstorms with only 1 enemy minion on the board, this will happen. We just don't hear about the other 1023 times it didn't happen. Probably happens every couple of days, if not every day!
---
i think the problem lies less in the individual game RNG and more in the ladder/game design:
---
* archtype polarity is insane in this TCG/CCG where there is no 'side deck' to build your deck against it, so if you role into a otk deck as control, aggro as OTK, or control as aggro, your chance of winning goes to at best 30% no matter how much better you are than your opponent 
---
* the ladder is best of 1. even if there WAS a theoretical side deck, it doesn't matter because the ladder is best of 1, where it's completely random if you vs something you have a 80/20 matchup against or a 20/80 or MAYBE even a fair 50/50 where skill matters much more but is still coupled with draw rng (cant be avoided all card games have it, though some faster games mitigate this by having inexpensive card tutoring/ draw power. committing an entire turn to draw 2 cards is NOT inexpensive)
---
* aggro climbs much faster during literally every meta than any other type of deck. If i'm a middle-bad player (let's say 50% percentile) playing the flavor of the month aggro deck and I start ranked at the same time as the best hearthstone player ever playing a control/OTK deck, there is a percentage difference where I will get to legend first if we both play at the same time. to better describe this, if I win 55% of games, and each of my games as aggro are 10 mins or less, I can rush through the losses to get to more wins and I will climb. compare this to the pro who has a 70% winrate (which is an incredibly amazing winrate, look at some stats nobody has consistent winrates like this due to the previously mentioned polarized ladder system), but each game takes 30+ minutes, in the time it takes him/her to win 7 out of 10 games, I've played 30 games and won 16/17. As time goes on, the difference gets wider, and eventually my sheer number of games pushes me closer to a higher rank. obviously this is mitigated by other factors such as what decks I match against, how good the aggro deck I choose is, etc. given enough time and a positive winrate though, anyone can get to legend eventually 
---
Idk if you watch streamers, but some of the top players muzzy, dog, firebat usually all get to legend but if you watch their streams there are sometimes bouts where they just lose game after game. random players are beating the best players in the game where skill is supposed to be the most important factor? 
---
You think it's skewed because of the Reddit posts you see of crazy outcomes? Why would somebody make a post when something mundane happens? That's like watching the news about a murderer and concluding that everyone around you is a murderer
---
Yes, and yes.
---
This is a good move in favor of new players to the game, makes it a lot more achievable to reach 15 and 10 with incomplete decks and not all that much experience.
---
Good job blizzard
---
100% agree. They are ridiculously prevalent.
---
He does all his shennenigans in hand.
---
&gt;I was playing Hunter since last summer when I started, long before its prevalence.

&gt; "Revel in my suffering"? Cut back on the weed there, cletus, you've been hitting it a bit too hard. Rigging the game to make you lose 999 games out of 1000 is to try to get dumb people to spend money on card packs in the shop. It has nothing to do with "suffering."
---
The idea of some developer tampering with the RNG in Dungeon Run just to be a sadistic jerk makes about as much sense as any other reason, including the one you gave. Why would anyone spend money on their collection over a loss in Dungeon Run - a mode where you *can't use your collection*? If anything it would make more sense to rig that mode in the players' favor, to both get them back into more profitable game modes quickly and to convince them that the cards they used to win are powerful and worth crafting for ladder mode.
---
&gt;I just want the game to actually be winnable.
---
Which just gets back to the question: Why? If you truly think a game is deceptive, exploitative, unwinnable, and you want to kill the people behind it, why are you still playing it? If you think Blizzard is going to such extreme and unethical lengths to try and wring every last dollar out of their players, it's not as though winning Dungeon Run as a paladin is going to change that. This time next year it'll still be the same game by the same company with the same business model, with new single player content developed for the same reasons as Dungeon Run. There are lots of other fun games out there, ones that don't ask you to continually invest tons of time or money to have a good time. There's no shame in saying "I'm not having fun" or "I'm disgusted with the developers" and turning away from Hearthstone.
---
I'd still play Hunter over Titan. Just on hiatus.
---
Change Tank Up's armor from giving 4 to giving 3.
---
The Silver Hand summons one 2/2 minion (which benefits from the same tribal synergies as other Silver Hand Recruits) instead of two 1/1 minions.
---
Make him an 11 cost card?
---
Easy solution: Keep it until you own every other standard legendary. Not only do you get great meme value out of it, you also prevent yourself from unpacking another one and still end up with all the dust from it eventually.
---
How could Baku work at 6 mana? It'd be in the deck that has to have only Odd cards. It being there makes it so that its own condition is unfulfilled.
---
Why do you say it's aimed at children? Because it's silly? Grownups don't mind silly, only edgy teens do.
---
I think we're on to something here
---
I was thinking qbout recording it but it was too late... i already did the thingy.
