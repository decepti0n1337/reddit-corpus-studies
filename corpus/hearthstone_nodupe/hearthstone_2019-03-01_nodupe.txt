Honestly, I think anyone who makes it to a world finals is impressive, even if I know nothing about em. But Bunnyhoppor, Tyler, Ike, and Viper I would say are well known, and I am excited to see them play.

Well stop accusing people of whining and crying when they are pointing out an obviously unfair system. This is the Hearthstone subreddit, shouldn't we be able to point out negative aspects of the game without being accused of pandering?

You actually get double value. You get to keep the cards and you get full dust. So you can play them in wild or you can dust them for regular dust returns. 
---
For me, especially with Baku, it's because they're over played
---
Warning: I'm normally not a theorist or a lore keeper from WoW but with a bit of research I've hatched my own half-baked theory about what the expansions could be along with the possible story and felt like ya'll would want to see. So sorry ahead of time for how sloppy this is since I've never done this before but I hope you all enjoy!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
First expansion: Definitely think it involves the sewers of Dalaran. There was imagery of the sewer in the announcements [here](https://i.imgur.com/tN2wUNl.jpg) behind the Choose Your Hero Screen and that's a little fishy. There also seems to be some weird cult or evil group look going on by the eye in the triangle and since this seems to be a Dalaran based expansion, they likely originate from the sewers since that's where the shady stuff mainly happens. The only other possibility is Violet Hold, the jail inside Dalaran. Besides that, not much else I could grab from this lore wise and hard to make a bridge to my ideas of the second and third expansions.
---
Second Expansion: Definitely something related to [Uldum](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uldum) (possibly [Ulduar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ulduar)). Uldum has a lot of Egyptian themes along with a similar [color scheme](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/546/502/large/diana-kon-halls-of-origination-randd-concept.jpg?1513462534) to the Expansion 2 panel.  I also found [this image](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/125925.jpg) of Ulduar that has a similar rune (2nd from the bottom on those two columns) to the one on Expansion 2's panels. Both Ulduar and Uldum were created for similar purposes so the same runes popping up isn't impossible.  It's interesting too because Uldum holds The Forge of Origination, a device created by the Titans to regulate the planet and if it became too corrupt it would destroy every living thing on the planet so it could start over. This seems like something a evil group would love to target and use for their own evil purposes.  
---
Now this is where my theory gets a little wild so strap in folks.
---
I believe this evil group is [The Twilight Hammer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer) re-branded to try and bring on [The Hour of Twilight](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Hour_of_Twilight) (The Hour of Twilight is where all the dragon aspects die which would allow the Old Gods to come out and destroy the world \[or whatever they're in the mood for that day\]). This wouldn't be the first time The Twilight Hammer has re-branded them self to gain traction and followers. They did this before in the Pre-patch to WoW Cataclysm, they were known as the Doomsday Cult. This also would work because The Twilight Hammer has previously interacted with both Uldum and Ulduar before. Twilight Cultists were found in the Ulduar raid in the [Descent into Madness](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Descent_into_Madness) portion and they have been seen at Uldum trying to turn the Forge of Origination into a super weapon to destroy all life. The Twilight Hammer is also heavily involved in WoW: Cataclysm
---
With my previously stated ideas, logically the third expansion would be in relation to Dragon Soul, The Hour of Twilight, End Times, some form of Cataclysm, etc but nothing in particular points me that way besides the color of the gem and the burn/claw marks at the top of the panel. It seems similar to the themes of [Vyrkul](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vrykul) (possibly [Iron Horde](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Iron_Horde)) but I'm unsure.  Could also be a tie into the [Firelands, Druids of the Flame,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer#Cataclysm) or [Blackrock Caverns](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blackrock_Caverns) since they all were involved with The Twilight Hammer and the panel is simply just wood burning.
---
That's the end of my half-baked theory. Like I said, I'm an amateur to this so take it easy on me because I'm sure there are plenty flaws in my logic but it's what I'm sticking to now. Feel free to provide other input or ideas! 
---
I agree, you vote with your wallet. That was the whole point of this post - to get people to stop purchasing and hopefully put some pressure on Blizzard to make it a little better for consumers. 
---
In general, rotation will be weaker because there are less cards available and most stronger cards (historically) are printed at the end of the year.  Because 2017 was a massive power creep, there should be a sharp relative decrease in power.
---
but in the scenario where you disenchant the legendary anyway so that it's a real comparison to my scenario, you end up with the 5200 anyway lol they both end at 5200
---
hmmm, maybe I just got really unlucky, but I played maybe 10 rounds as shaman, I got Keleseth several times, but I simply could not stay alive past like turn 6 about 75% of the time. The deck has great cards by the end, but I kept getting steamrolled so early on, and since my totem only has 3 HP it's so easy to kill.
---
Good point

---
Yes, that is the next step. It is just disappointing because I really enjoy the mechanics of the game. 
---
I think the second one is more likely having to do with the Sethrak or Vol'dun in general as it fits the color scheme of something like the \[Temple of Sethraliss\]([https://c-4tvylwolbz88x24nhtlwlkphx2ejbyzljkux2ejvt.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3\_c-4dvd.nhtlwlkph.jvt\_/c-4TVYLWOLBZ88x24oaawzx3ax2fx2fnhtlwlkph.jbyzljku.jvtx2fdvdwlkphx2faobtix2f1x2f11x2fAltwsl\_vm\_Zlaoyhspzz\_svhkpun\_zjyllu.qwnx2f8957we-Altwsl\_vm\_Zlaoyhspzz\_svhkpun\_zjyllu.qwnx3fp87j.thyrx3dpthnl\_$/$/$/$/$/$/$](https://c-4tvylwolbz88x24nhtlwlkphx2ejbyzljkux2ejvt.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3_c-4dvd.nhtlwlkph.jvt_/c-4TVYLWOLBZ88x24oaawzx3ax2fx2fnhtlwlkph.jbyzljku.jvtx2fdvdwlkphx2faobtix2f1x2f11x2fAltwsl_vm_Zlaoyhspzz_svhkpun_zjyllu.qwnx2f8957we-Altwsl_vm_Zlaoyhspzz_svhkpun_zjyllu.qwnx3fp87j.thyrx3dpthnl_$/$/$/$/$/$/$)).

The third one looks more like it could be either maghar orc related or dragonmaw clan related but I think Iron Horde is possible.

Until you know the ~130 some new cards, and test them for at least 2 weeks, you have no idea whether it will be boom or bust

* Dean Ayala hinted at combo disruption on Angry Chicken a while back.

5/2/2 | Battlecry: Summon 2 copies of this minion.  
---
You get a full refund for the card, AND you can disenchant it.
---
So for example, if you crafted Golden Baku.  The HoF would come around and refund the 3200 dust you used to craft it, but then you could still disenchant it for another 1600 dust.  By crafting Golden Baku, you effectively printed yourself a free Legendary of your choice.
---
However, this only counts for the maximum *playable* copies.  You can only play 1 copy of a Legendary per deck, so even if you had 2 non-gold Baku and 2 gold Baku, you would still only get the same 3200 dust from the HoF as if you only had 0 non-gold and 1 gold Baku.
---
Let's say I already own a regular Bakku. If I craft a golden Bakku, wait for the rotation to happen, and then dissenchant my golden Bakku, don't I end up making 1600 dust for free?
---
Only if you don't already have them, though.
---
Will Dragon+Raven be weaker than Raven+Mammoth and Mammoth+Kraken? We don't know but it is likely since Raven was designed to be more toned down in power.
---
Will new Decks arise after the rotation. Yes. Remember Deathrattle and Secret hunter kinda sucked until Year of the Kraken rotated out. The rotation will kill decks and make room for low tier decks to rise in the open niches.
---
If you have the non-golden copy already and do nothing, you get the same 1600 when HoF hits.
---
How is 2771 gold value for 3500 gold not a bad deal, or am I completely missing something here? 
---
1/51
---
Your company has seen some major restructuring, your stocks in the tank, your main breadwinner is dying, the self propelling community outreach that is twitch has collapsed and... oh hey its expansion season. Time to open up temporary communication to feed the hype then go dark again for the next 3 months.
---
No, you make 0 profit.  See Example #4.
---
Also Marin the Fox could not be disenchanted. 
---
Here are the options:
---
You have Ordinary Genn. If you do nothing, you'll gain 1600 dust when its HoFd, and can also DE for another 400, giving 2,000 dust in total.
---
You have Ordinary Genn, and you craft Golden Genn for 3200 dust. When HoF happens, you only get the dust value for one of them, so you get back 3200 dust, which means you are at 0 net Dust, and have one ordinary Genn and one golden Genn in your collection. If you dust them both, you get 2,000 dust. 
---
In both scenarios, you end up with a profit of 2,000 dust. So there's no reason to craft the golden one.
---
The scenario changes if you plan to keep one of the Genns. If you really want the golden hero power, you can can craft a golden one, and dust the ordinary one for 400 dust. In effect, you paid 1600 dust to improve the hero power appearance. It's up to you to decide if that's worth it.
---
Back at it again with the explanations
---
Another release-exciting-boring cycling starts 
---
Whizbang IRL
---
Sure, but Mecha'Thun and Azalina are around another year and they might want to print some cards that would be OP in Druid if Naturalize was still there. 
---
Those three are much more likely to be rewarded by the same event/promotion, whatever it is, since their rhyming names clearly make them a set. Also the art doesn't match at all, pearl white vs arcane purple, fel green vs some sort of water/nature motif and dragon/viking vs gears
---
I think it sucks fat cock.  Rip most of my decks. 
---
How much time have you spend? I've read it can take up to a year to make a good deck.
---
I don't complain though I haven't purchased more than a couple packs and I still think I enjoy the game even without having the thousands of cards to make a great deck
---
I feel like the last one has something to do with Deathwing. (Lava, Claw), the second one could be about Malygos and the first one I don¬¥t know. But everything will be about Magic and Dragons I feel like.
---
Amazing update. By far the best computer TCG. Excited about the massive changes and finally some loving to single player content.
---
&gt;Haven't met any jade shamans in the past months either.
---
That doesn't surprise me. It's a tier 3 deck on a good day. It's just the one I enjoy playing once I hit rank 5. Wins more than it loses, so you could climb with it; though Kingsbane or take your pick of warlock decks are far more efficient. It's a super-greedy control deck that I find fun as hell to play.
---
But there are no cards banned from all Magic formats? At least not when I played. 
---
don't play the purposefully uber bust game mode, problem solved
---
Doubt it. Sometimes there is more than one good deck for a class. 
---
Viable Meta Pirate Rogue? Let it be so!
---
Soooo still no deck sorting option?! 
---
* If you own Baku you do indeed get 1600 dust.
---
* If you own Baku and craft a golden version you spend 3200, you get back 3200, and then you dust the golden copy for 1600.  You made 0 profit and a bunch of moves for no reason.
---
* If you keep the golden copy, then you can dust the normal for 400.  In which case, you lost 1200 dust.
---
haha! Very true. Time for my F2P ass to suffer! lol
---
When I started it took me maybe 3 months to build my first tier 1 deck, and I sucked at arena back then. If you practice some discipline and don't dust any playable copies of anything though you get to a place after a while where you rarely have to craft too much (if anything) to build whatever decks you want.
---
When it can to Doomguard, this time last year there was an absolute crapton of people demanding it get placed into the Hall of Fame because of Cube Warlock. If this was last year no one would be complaining about it but instead celebrating Team 5 for their great choice.
---
While Cube Warlock is one of my personal favorite decks in Standard's history and I will likely continue playing the deck in Wild, Doomguard has always seen some amount of play in almost every format since the game entered Beta. It is probably best if the card goes.
---
I just want all your links my friend. Shower me 
---
i was one of the people thinking it would be something silly related to area 52, because witchwood was already a "serious" expansion so they would try to hit something more lighthearted
---
It is important to mention explicitly that if you aren't going to keep Genn or Baku the DE value of a golden copy of either is worth more than both of them non-golden.
---
IE, non-gold legendaries are 400 dust but gold ones are 1600. So if you have 3200 dust making just one of them (and getting the 3200 refunded) and then dusting it (for 1600) nets you 4800 dust versus making both in non-gold would be 4000.
---
Karazhan destroyed the meta because it was broken on so many levels. The problem was, it broke the meta by giving all the broken cards to a class that was already dominating the game, so obviously the game just turned into Shamanstone on steroids.
---
The issue with Kara wasn't that it was an adventure, but that it was awfully balanced, which then continued with Gadgetzan. Should we also remove expansions because 3 of them in a row changed absolutely nothing? Or is the issue balance and not the concept of expansions?
---
Nice finally option for this. Like to switch up my card back every so often.

Are the HoF'd classics going to get replacements?

---
‚ÄúOh man, he posted a link where they say exactly what he said.. uhh. Derp‚Äù
---
I think there are different difficulties like the old adventures.
---
Given how quickly HSReplay begins to work out the meta, I‚Äôd say within an hour these decks are going to be really strong given that they have maybe 5-10 times as much data as HSReplay.
---
So: I don't have genn and I don't have any glitter moths or gloom stags. I should craft them all golden and disenchant them after the expansion if I want max dust?
---
they already playable in wild since their release 
---
I mean, it's not really a loss. You're still gaining 400 dust for crafting your regular AND getting a free golden. 
---
The only people that can feel kind of stung are those who recently crafted Baku. Even then they can still look at this as essentially getting a Golden Baku for 1200 dust if they want and/or getting a regular for free. 
---
The card is OP but then again the hunter shrine is far more powerful. 
---
I imagined it has to be when you open them. Unless the cards are pseudo "added" to your collection upon receiving the pack. Otherwise how would it know not to duplicate a legendary? You could craft a legendary between receiving and opening the pack, so I'd say that they're generated upon opening
---
You can watch all the matches on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/388076670
---
I can see your point, but I feel like it falls into the same place that Jade Druid did, where at the time it was stupidly broken, but within the current power level, cubelock is GOOD, but it doesn't feel broken anymore.
---
I agree with all of that. How does that justify the statement "upgrade to a golden copy for free"?
---
it could be something like "prison break", what do you think of the "henchman" wording for the singleplayer characters
---
Because your net dust balance doesn't change and it doesn't factor in opportunity cost.
---
What about getting duplicates though? Or would you just open the packs anyway and not disenchant until after the HOF happens?
---
Does this mean I can craft Genn basically for free now before YotD starts?
---
Yes, though if you are missing Legendary cards they get a higher dust return.
---
This is almost classic reddit, someone asks for proof of something, you post it, they then say ‚ÄúWell they never said they WOULDNT DO THAT‚Äù. Like what? Lmao. If next week they deleted all standard cards and made you buy new ones would you say they ‚Äúnever said they wouldn‚Äôt do that‚Äù lmao. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just enjoying this way too much. 
---
Not being an asshole, but can you please use the period and write in paragraphs. Reading your posts is painful.
---
Should probably clarify: Skelesaurus Hex gives each player a card that costs 0 on normal mode.
---
I got this murloc, and he of course gets Oondasta.
---
What is your standard shudderwock list that‚Äôs getting 60%+ winrates out of curiocity?
---
I have a passable standard OTK shudderwock list that uses two fire plume harbingers to lower Grumble to 4 mana, and murmuring to 0 mana, and then goes 0 mana Murmuring, Shudderwock, 0 mana Grumble, 0 mana Murmuring, 1 mana Shudderwock, 0 mana Grumble.
---
It‚Äôs alright, but mostly preyed on Spell Hunter which largely went away after the nerfs three weeks ago, and was also about a turn or so slower than other combo decks like Mechathun decks.  I think I was only getting 45% winrate with it around rank 5?
---
So if you‚Äôre hitting 60% with an OTK shudderwock I‚Äôm pretty curious what your deck looks like.
---
This :) The actual AMA is on the 7th but the initial thread will be started on the 6th for the questions. 
---
Member how whizbang was flattered?
---
ppl just like making the same mistake again and again
---
Probably lots of people. 
---
Couldn't agree more my friend, couldn't agree more. Thanks so much, same to you!
---
Metas are relative. A particular meta isn‚Äôt ‚Äúweak‚Äù because there will be decks that are strong within it. A deck that may be weak in some metas will completely dominate others. It‚Äôs even the case that two decks that have a clear power differential in one meta will switch places in the next. It‚Äôs all fluid.
---
Granted, there‚Äôs a meta of metas so to speak, which is what wild is generally understood to be. But these aren‚Äôt popular formats to play in. Players generally prefer weaker metas (see: rejoicing at nerfs) because they have more variety and are more skill testing.
---
From the player perspective, the difference between a strong meta and a weak meta isn‚Äôt as consequential as class diversity, polarization, interesting play styles, class identity, except that these are generally harder to accomplish at high power levels.
---
It's amazing the logic rollercoaster this guy goes down to reach "black people are bad." 
---
Christmas is early this year. 
---
F
---
They mentioned that there are going to be some balance changes (nerfs) announced closer to the release of the new set.
---
&gt; And don't blame me because you mispoke with the 12 pack example. 
---
What? I wasn't blaming you for anything. No need to get hostile.
---
Well, first off, a decent chunk of zoo decks just ran Leeroy instead, some ran both. Secondly, that's literally 1 warlock deck, 2 if you count cubelock, and 3 counting discolock (and not even every discolock list runs it, though most do). There's also control-lock which didn't run it, egglock which doesn't run it, it obviously wasn't in Evenlock, it wasn't in handlock before evenlock was a thing, mecha'thun warlock didn't run it, so only half of the available warlock decks actually run it.
---
Whereas rag was in an overwhelming percentage of decks. It was also neutral, so literally every deck that could afford to run it did, and it was a classic card so it wasn't going to go away. DG is only warlock and it's not even in every archetype, and even some archetypes that DID want to run it, didn't. If that was their only reason for HoFing DG then I entirely disagree with that decision, because that's not nearly enough of a reason. However, if their plan is to release cards that would end up breaking doomguard again, then I can see it, which is why I said that I'm hoping to see some more discolock and cube support cards.
---
Why golden?
---
FOR THE NAJATAR
---
PlayHearthstone channel is so stupid. When someone played Zerek's Cloning Gallery into 68 damage burst, I wrote, "Pretty dumb."
---
Nope, denied. "In conflict with channel's moderation settings."
---
I type, "Pretty stupid" (maybe specifically the word "dumb" is offensive?)
---
What the fuck?
---
Super hyped for the arena changes especially. Overall the general changes seems great. Nice one Blizzard. Slight concern about (the state of) Wild.
---
I meant that since a Baku costs 1600, the profit by doing nothing is 1600 dust. Same profit, but with less steps
---
Wouldn't you pay gold to play content? That has value too. Honestly I would pay 400 gold for a golden classic pack but it really "costs" even less than that.
---
It‚Äôs called fun and interactive 
---
Okay
---
Why not?  People like shiny things.  Choose if you want shiny cards, or more dust, and then you can decide your best course of action.
---
That first one reminds me of the kirin tor yeah.. but specifically Violet Hold. A prison themed expansion where we "break out" would be awesome.
---
The expac stuff is a good point, but what other ‚Äúbonus stuff‚Äù do new players get? I took a quick look at the wiki and all I could see was 2 free pack quests
---
Perfectly happy with the price.
---
First of all, NO MY ODD MAGE. Second does everybody think the game is gonna be more boring or more fun in an experimentive way since such strong cards are Hall of Famed?
---
Hemet will also be gone.
---
Yup. If you don't own it just craft golden. You'll get the 3200 dust back when new season starts. :)
---
question: does this mean i can craft all the cards that are moving to hall of fame, get the dust for them at the start of the year, and then disenchant them all for free dust?
---
Ah. Not familiar with WoW lore. Just from a professor stand point, sounds like he should be from the lab. Thanks for the tidbit though!
---
Anomalus is actually in a Top 25 Reno list this moth. Controversial but still in element91's list.  Goya saw *some* play in Standard but not Wild.  Knuckles saw no play.
---
why would i disenchant genn or baku
---
Would have been pleased years ago
---
RoadDog#11906 ASIA need friends on asia server hmu. 
---
Because of this, the card will probably be good.  pushes another paywall to get to a card you want.
---
Yes have then slowly unlock a separate, adventure only set of cards just like slay the spire. So easy. 
---
I play ladder exclusively and they nailed it for me
---
Balance changes are all it takes to keep me happy.

I enjoyed 15 16 and 17 but damn year of the raven felt kind of shitty

The people who enjoy brewing will still brew. This just shortcuts deck building for people who don't care about brewing at all. 
---
No this dungeon run is different, you see, because you have to pay for it.
---
But when you do....that 5/25 tho.
---
I swear, they always have Hex...even when they're not Shaman.
---

---

---

---
You guessed it right
---
I'm corridor creeper*
---
Looks like Priest is back on the menu
---
The changes made to both Raza and Patches were done pretty much exclusively for the Wild format. If both were in their original forms in the format, they would be just as much of an issue as they were in Standard at the peaks if not even worse.
---
Reno Priest is already very good in the format and going back to the zero mana hero power would most likely enable full sixty damage combos.
---

i have no idea why they didn't do this for every nerf. kripp has been abusing this system for a long time and made dust out of thin air for keeping extra copies of everything. admittedly he still spends thousands for whatever reason that was for, but i remember in the beginning being frustrated he both got exclusive access with permanent benefits as well as exploiting a poorly thought out dust refund system.
---
i don't actually care that much about it, but since we're on the subject i thought i'd loose a couple thoughts on the matter.
---
Interesting, no hero cards... 
---
weeks instead of days and we good
---
The value of sets as a whole and the value of their individual cards changes with the meta. With Genn and Baku gone and rotation taking place, there's lots of potential for different cards from The Witchwood to become valuable.
---
We're praising their early move to Wild because there was a fair amount of concern that their effects would continue the trend of Standard's meta feeling relatively the same even after new expansions and balance changes. Yeah, we're losing some value, especially anyone who invested into them late in the game, but most of us got tons of value from them in the time since they first released. I think we should praise moves like this that go against convention for the sake of the overall experience of the game. Despite the downsides, the upsides make it worthwhile.
---
Even Shaman has lots of synergies with the 1 mana totem or even deck generating a lot of value. For ex: totemcarver, sea giant, thing from below, direwolf, and murkspark eel. Decks that are as good as genn or Baku decks usually also have a way of cheating out value. The OP gave some very good examples: cubelock, thekal with blood Giants, and big priest
---
Mill druid worked back before the standard/wild split as a B tier deck. And Naturalize got the HoF for Mechathun not Hadronox if anything. Hadronox is about to rotate out.
---
If you give it time, yes, new things will emerge, but it will be slow to happen. Every new set will influence Wild less than the last, especially as no new set is likely to ever match the power of either Knights of the Frozen Throne or Kobolds and Catacombs.
---
Even then, having a handful of decks dominate an eternal format for a full year is far, far from unusual in games like MTG. Decks like Affinity have been among the top dogs of MTG's Modern format since its inception.
---

ah, so as long as it's cheaper than the other form of gambling it's all good

---
Druid? What is that class?
---
Keep in mind that 3 three expansions tells a one story
---
Third one gives me a Cataclysm feel
---
But we don't even know what the first expansion IS yet, we just know they're supposed to tell a story. So there's no real reason to *assume* a dragon centered expansion. Though I'd certainly welcome another.
---
It is all very nice, but can Zayle do a muscle-up, and does he give free unsolicited life advice?
---
What does that have to do with all the positive things announced today, which in fact actually does include some of the most commonly requested changes?
---
Oh right of course. I forgot about the ante cards. I haven‚Äôt played in a few years and even when I did I never actually saw an ante card. For obvious reasons. 
---

Well you just might be in luck then!

 U can also spend 700 gold. Just like before. I don‚Äôt see the problem here, especially as a f2per as well. 
---
And that the second one was Netherstorm. Given that The Witchwood was pretty much some shit they just made up for Hearthstone (you spend about 45 seconds in Blackwald Forest as a Worgen in WoW, which is apparently what the Witchwood was supposed to be,) I'd say everyone did a pretty good job with their predictions.
---
Not when I'm the Paladin. Silverback P for the win!
---
That's what they've been doing with class cards. They should be replacing neutral cards as well, but I don't know how I feel about that
---
Gratz!

The Shadow Cloak of Dalaran should be a strong clue for Dalaran expansion.

Or just play it in Wild.

The Shadow Cloak of Dalaran should confirm first expansion as Dalaran related.

---
Not to be that person but i think most people just say it's inconsistent.
---
Nice play though. I've had some fun games that involved espionage rogue by myself of my opponent :)
---
I don't know if I would weigh a Classic pack at 4-5 new-expansion packs, and I don't think that many players buy Classic packs with gold.  The golden pack is more "pure dust" than a new-expansion pack is, but you're not opening new cards very often.  And the golden legendary, too, is either a REALLY expensive Whizbang, or is pure dust like the gold pack.
---
It's pretty important that buying the PvE is a better deal than straight buying packs, because otherwise this takes something free and locks it behind an effective paywall.
---
Game breaking cards in the history of the game? That‚Äôs cute.
---
Genn and Baku were fine compared to some of the other bullshit they have printed before, and there‚Äôs a LOT I could choose from. Was it gonna be a little boring one more year of Odd/Even, sure, but broken? Hilarious.
---
Oh yeah totally inconsistent, ton of fun though, favorite deck atm
---
Or about 0.0196078431% if you do some simple math
---
Doesn't Blizz usually give out 6 free packs at the start of every new expansion?  Do we know if we're getting those again?  Currently completing the free first wing only gives 3 afaik.
---
man i always love me some good conspiracy theory.
---
My point is that what you are saying is irrelevant. Every 10 min the meta button would calculate which is the highest winning deck and just make it. Everyone would take it, including bad players, then that deck would drop and 10 min later a new deck would be higher win rate, so it would constantly change until an no brain ultra cancer aggro deck that any idiot can play would stay, since that's how you grind ladder anyway
---
To me that looks like the Dalaran Sewers: [http://wowscapes.blogspot.com/2013/09/dalaran-sewer-circle-of-wills.html](http://wowscapes.blogspot.com/2013/09/dalaran-sewer-circle-of-wills.html)
---
For all the talk this guy has, he sure is wrong. KoFt and Kobolds most popular? Sure, at the time. Then fast forward a year and DK cards and Kobolds cards still dominate the meta, and everyone left because the meta is stale as hell. Short term positive effect, long term negative effect. So your solution is to have them print even more wildly overpowered cards so we get a shit-show similar to Wild? Grade A genius over here. Hire this guy Blizz.
---
\&gt;  people losing their jobs 
---
And? Do you want communism where everybody does nothing and parasites on others, who work? People lost jobs because they were no longer needed. Thats how it works. 
---
So, you‚Äôre a troll, because you‚Äôre blatantly lying and full of shit. 
---
I mean... even so. The fact that with just one, they can make an 8 health minion turn into 16 damage with two cards is really stupid. 
---
We say "this card is going", yet the new expansion can introduce just as much stupid stuff that can push it over the edge again. As is the case every meta (because every meta people say - priest is going to be shit)
---
Hey, if they just keep increasing the cost of the card, it can't be combo'd with as many things right? Just make it 10 mana.
---
Also, more like when they keep nerfing/HoFing cards that combo with it. PO, Cold blood lol.
---
Or, if you keep the cards (if originally not having them), you get your dust back (6400) and 2 free goldens. 
---
Ops, I did it again! 
---
They‚Äôre still standard sets, so idk why they wouldn‚Äôt be available. 
---
Mecharoo
---
He is honestly one of the cards I'm looking forward to never seeing in standard again. As fun as revisiting old memories in wild can be, I'd happily never go back if it means never seeing Tarim again.
---
If you buy a pack with the cards that you don't own, its worth not the 100 dust, but 350+ dust, because you don't need to craft those cards anymore. 
---
This number diminishes as buy more packs down to 150-200 dust per pack at 100 packs opened(which is essentially all commons/rares).
---
The point is that If you are f2p player(or someone who doesn't opens more than 100 packs per expansion), the gold that you paid for content instead means much more than for someone who's already getting average 100 dust per pack(300+ pack openings, I believe).
---

I have a golden whizbang, by handing out a golden sort-of whizbang to everyone youve devalued my account now blizzard.
---
Fuck Deathstalker Rexxar. Changing aggro deck to control one and outvaluing you EVERY FUCKING SINGLE TIME.
---
As someone who only started during witchwood I cant wait till rotation goes through.  Also stoked about the refund on the baku i foolishly crafted when i thought :hey, i opened a darius, dr boom, and a super colider - all i need now is a baku to run odd warrior  meanwhile i dont have half the other cards like direhorn, elise etc lol.
---
I personally love gold cards so I'll probably craft a gold genn. I made boku gold when I didn't open it. 
---
To all the haters out there, I would remind you that this kind of gallery result is a mega high roll
---
At some point you will want to dabble in wild, so dont dust the strongest rotating cards.
---
Fact is, standard play can get boring after a while and dusting your collection every year is bad dust efficiency. I've seen many people regret dusting their wild collection. Just dust the enough for genn and baku.
---
*You guessed it right*
---
*I'm three attack weaker*
---
I'm sorry maybe I'm having a brain fart but for example 3. Say for example you are missing a copy or multiple copies of an epic like glitter moth which is probably not going to be played in wild. Wouldn't it be a net gain of 400 dust per copy ? Like you'd craft the golden copies giving you 0 dust gain but then you can disenchant them for an additional 400 dust (per copy). 
---
And slosher!
---
Do you have a link to the source for this? Im curious. Thanks
---
I hope you are right, Algalon is beautiful and now that i've got Lich King, i long for him :)
---
Twenty packs doesn‚Äôt guarantee a legendary.
---
Twenty packs only guarantees a minimum of two epics, 18 rares, and 95 commons.
---
&gt;If the goal was to make the Year of the Raven weaker, why on Earth would Blizzard put out cards that looked so blatantly powerful
---
I'm not sure how good your memory was but that was not at all the consensus on this subreddit. 
---
The first wing could be much better than the rest.
---
Sucks that Baku isn‚Äôt rotating yet, it‚Äôs all I see
---
Just keep in mind you only get refunds up to the legal amount of copies a deck could run - so one for legendaries, and two otherwise. Any golden cards just take the place of regular ones for this.
---
They‚Äôre gradually removing charge completely from Standard. It will eventually be a wild-only mechanic. That‚Äôs really all there is to it. 
---
Isnt a golden epic 800?
---
That's your dusting philosophy.  Some people want the card for Wild.  Others want to keep them for that long term value that they might one day be nerfed.
---
Otk decks. Aggro decks e.g. mech hunter.
---
1.  You don't miss in game content with it.
---
2.  If you get the first Wing free, you get equivalent value back for  the gold spent.  It seems fine.  The downside is you need to hold back 28000 gold for a month.
---
This is [everything you get that has real gameplay value](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/20NJS1QNU2JU1551306604231.jpg) outside of PvE.  The dust to gold ratio is roughly 1 to 1.64. (*see below*) (*e.g.* 1 gold is equal to 1.64 dust)
---
* 15 new *Year of the Dragon* packs (1,500 gold)
---
* 1 Golden Classic Pack (Average of 469.8 dust with minimum of 300 dust.  So 293.6 gold)
---
* [Golden Legendary Zayle](https://www.pcgamer.com/genn-baku-and-doomguard-sent-to-the-hall-of-fame-as-hearthstone-heads-into-the-year-of-the-dragon/) (1,600 dust or 977.4 gold)
---
* PvE Content has zero equivalent value.
---
* Also, if you don't purchase all 5 Wings, you don't get a Golden Legendary Zayle or Golden Classic pack and lose 1,294 gold outright.  So only buying 5 wings makes sense.
---
###So for 3,500 gold (or 2,800 gold if you got the first Wing free) you get an average equivalent gold value of 2,771 gold. (This also assumes you can disenchant Zayle) 
---
&gt;**Note**: In Hearthstone, a pack is worth about 163.7 dust if you keep your Legendary.  And 102.8 if you don't.  Because you always get a new missing Legendary (since Un'Goro), it is almost always 163.7 dust per 100g spent on a pack.  (*See* [B137 on Best Pack tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYuukT1O3qdvbSfpUAbJMJLYkusXclc-Rivd-uMy6g0/edit#gid=269921972))  Numbers are based on over 33.3k packs collected where packs opened were over 40. (*see* [B153 for data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcH6U79Uk8xSQhqMqu93sSZoNwMq1E4dw-CHFSTMenk/edit#gid=579362856)).  I also assume the golden pack rarity rate is the non-golden+golden drop rates.
---
It's usually 1600 to craft and 400 for disenchanting, but since the rotation to Hall of Fame just got anounced, I'll get the full 1600 for Glitter Moth when it rotates out.
---
So youre basically saying that blizzard is making card too strong on purpose rather than that they sometimes make a card too strong by accident?
---
I have trust in Team 5, but not that much. OP cards get printed in every card game . Even in magic, after 20 years, they still print cards that have to be put on a banlist.
---
Blizzard said multiple times that they like good taunts, and they've introduced multiple so far. Sometimes even too god (Giggling(, so I think we will have some nice replacement for Stonehill in this expansion. 
---
The new content feels like the old adventures so I'll be getting it for sure :) 
---
Zayle is worth what any Golden Legendary is worth.  1600 dust.  That's the value you get for turning him in.   The Classic Tavern Brawl pack has no bearing, you could just say unlock Zayle and get a Classic Brawl pack....that's ridiculous.
---
Whether you keep Zayle or not, it is worth 1600.
---
$20 for 12 packs vs $50 for 50 (preorder) - one is definitely more efficient than the other, and spending both batches of money isn‚Äôt great. It would be nice if the Adventure was part of the expansion pre-order, or something. Basically I don‚Äôt have enough cash to spend that much per expansion anyway (which is already expensive to get a decent amount of packs, including using gold, to remain meta relevant) for every expansion in a year. Even though it‚Äôs an $8 difference, that‚Äôs significant for me, and I won‚Äôt be able to keep up with it.

I seriously have no idea how everyone thought it wasn't going to be good. Plenty of decks have enough little minions dying constantly so of course a free 5/5 is going to be included
---
I mean, looking at the wording when they say Genn and Baku are being HoF'ed a year early, it suggests ALL expansion cards are technically HoF.
---
This right here, paying 700g for such little card content? Knowing blizzard and their half assed ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, they will ramp up the difficulty just by giving the AI overpowered cards. And then you have to pay to deal with that shit? Thanks but no thanks.
---
I barely played the last dungeon run after I got the card back, there is really no proper incentive to play it. ‚ÄúFor fun‚Äù is not in my book with a lame AI and overpowered cards (it‚Äôs honestly a lazy design).
---
I paid for the original adventures because you got actual collectible cards,  but this deal is really lame.

Seems like an insane feature to actually build into the game. If you think shit was repetitive now, wait till this is implemented. Literally everyone will play the exact same deck.

I think the biggest reason that RR was the tipping point was because it was the *third* expansion where odd/even decks had dominated the meta and it was REALLY getting stale, along with the realization we had ***an entire year more*** of them. Most of the time the big things from expansions are meta defining for the expansion they're in and maybe one past it, but often by the time the regular set of nerfs come it's past its prime. Death Knights didn't, but they also don't fundamentally alter the game from turn 1, so while a lot of people (myself included) are certainly happy to see them go, we aren't tearing out our hair at the fact that they've already been in standard for a year and a half. 
---
Where is my Benedictus? :c so fun when you drop it with a warrior and he insta-concede lmao
---
some evaluate 'good' as powerful. others evaluate good design as situational, interactive, and/or balanced.
---
The key difference to HoF I believe is these cards will noinfer appear in witchwood packs 
---
they may aswell put stonehill defender and tarim together in the same square
---
Except you don‚Äôt get any cards... 
---
r/Whoosh
---
That's been the running gag for almost 2 years now.
---
&gt;Is it just me?
---
You get full dust value as cards are put into the Hall of Fame. If none of your legendaries were HoF‚Äôd you won‚Äôt receive a dust ‚Äúrefund‚Äù.
---
rip like if u cry every time
---
You pay 800 Dust for each Epic you upgrade. Later on you will be refunded 800 Dust for each golden Epic you own. Now you can also disenchant each golden Epic for 400 Dust. 
---
As you know, these two decks create very repetitive and unfun environment, cutting many other archetypes with potential, because "Odd/Even is just better". These two cards couldn't stayed in Standard for one more year until Witchwod rotate, because everyone was so sick of them. Imagine having it in format **forever**.
---
It's the card shake effect that sometimes rumbles the board.
---
Only upcoming wins. It's specified in the blog post, you will not gain wins retroactively from past Arena experience.

Blizzard creates overpowered card: ‚Äúwhy the fuck hasn‚Äôt blizzard dealt with this yet‚Äù
---

---
Blizzard hall of games card: ‚Äúit‚Äôs a conspiracy by blizzard to steal our dust‚Äù
---
Rip this was my stuff bruh, I stopped playing a while ago and this was all I knew 
---
Probs something stupid
---
That's tempo, not value. Value is about having more resources and tempo is putting more stuff on the board early as possible. And there are decks that can out-pace Even Shaman after the nerfs. Aggro Kingsbane is one example. And you can grind them out with Reno decks although Big Priest counter Reno decks.
---
Start saving, then. I've saved 30k gold, so you can surely save a fraction of that. 
---
If you're going to sit here and pretend like you didn't get a billion miles out of Baku and Genn then idk what to tell you. Fucking ingrates.

You're dumb? You're a dumb person?

If you're trying to say Blizzard just made the game more expensive then you have to compare the new changes with what we have now, not what we had 3 years ago.
---
Best are definitely Garrosh and Malfurion, both see play but aren't OP.
---
Valeera doesn't even see play, and when it see play it makes you lose games.
---
Yeah, we got a real Hearthstone prodigy here
---
Even warlock plays almost the exact same game every time. These decks are far more consistent than almost any other deck in hearthstone‚Äôs history. Start of game is flawed conceptually.

80g quest trade. you show first. then i'll start.
---
I've actually been playing odd druid and its been doing alright. Quite funny that Gloom Stag would get nerfed as soon as I started using it hahah
---
Wouldn‚Äòt crafting a golden one and dusting for the full value after they moved to HoF net me the same amount of dust as before?
---
What am i missing here?
---
I mean, I've logged on 2-3 times since August and I still check the top posts weekly. Not that odd since this one got pretty huge, and isn't even specifically about Hearthstone. 
---
Wah we want powerful cards but also waaahhh if cards too powerful wahhh blizz fix or me no pay money wahhh
---
He is next probably :'(
---
yep
---
Right. They just decided to do it on a whim surely because of the cards that they'll have coming out which they only started working on three weeks ago...
---
They bring joy.
---
I don't think they will ever implement such an option. Ppl would permasquelch whenever they are salty and just got bm'd and then forget about it.
---
*"Genn and Baku? Why are they being rotated?"*
---
*"Because we have to hate them."*
---
*"They didn't do anything wrong."*
---
*"Because they're the Legendaries Hearthstone deserves, but not the ones it needs right now. So we'll rotate them. Because they can take it. Because they're not our heros. They're silent guardians. Watchful protectors. The Dark Knights."*
---
Naturalize is getting HOF'd so unless something new comes out there is no easy OTK for him - there may still be ways but they will all be so difficult that the play rate on ladder for such decks will be low.
---
As far as maly weelll, that card has always limited design space but it's obvious not getting nerfed and the two viable maly decks (rogue which is debatable, and druid which is still good) are losing their key core cards so...
---
I‚Äôm going to miss the two in the middle more than some on the outside. Is that bad?
---
Fire fly is going away?! Nooooooo
---
I think the idea was that you can still have the Naga-giants combo for nostalgia but it won't be very good. 
---
Really, it should be 0. Explosive runes doesn‚Äôt come out in waves like arcane missiles, it‚Äôs a single burst of damage. However, this secret doesn‚Äôt even see the divine shield, it just sees the health of the minion and subtracts that from six. Seems like a serious oversight design-wise. 
---
How is it net neutral if (not trolling just wanna understand)
---
1) You have genn regular
---
2) You craft golden gen (- 3200 dust)
---
3) HOF gives you + 3200 for golden genn
---
4) You then DE your regular genn (+ 400)
---
5) You now can play golden genn and have 400 free dust
---
The game is more expensive from either perspective. We have three expansions a year which is more expensive than the previous 2-expansions/1-adventure model, and the solo content which has been free since pivoting to this 3-expansions model is now not free anymore. 
---
For the same investment, we get less content now than we did during the Years of the Mammoth and the Raven.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs gonna sting, at least paladins have that 1/3 mech 
---
Nah, I am mostly a F2P but I am also a collector at heart. Never disenchanted a wild card and am sitting on 20k dust :) the best about this golden Stag is that I only had one, so now I have a full set (I would have enchanted a golden one if it wasn't for this, same as i did for Ice Block last year)
---
Let's do some math on the value of the announced singleplayer content.
---
There's 4 wings to be purchased total for 2800 gold, in return for 4*3=12 packs worth only 1200 gold. That's a 1600 gold deficit in gold value.
---
The reward for completing all 5 wings is a single Golden Classic Pack. The worst case scenario is 4 commons 1 rare, which is 4*50+100=300 dust total. Even with one Epic, you only get 600 dust. 
---
Assuming a 1 gold to 1 dust conversion ratio, in order to make an even trade, your Golden Classic pack must contain either a Legendary, or have 4 Epics. Given that both of those things are unlikely to happen, I think it's safe to say that this singleplayer adventure is purely a losing proposition when purchased with gold.
---
(By the way, the whole thing is being offered for 20USD, which is also the same price for 15 packs in real money. Given just how bad the value in gold the singleplayer adventure seems to be, it's clear they're nudging people to purchase with real money.)

A thing that's said a lot here would be "craft decks, not cards". 
---
It's still a bit limiting, but once you get a hang of a deck, you may find yourself doing good with it. Which ultimately leads to fun.
---
I was not looking for front page, just wanted to share an happy surprise for once. Had so much useless 5 rank epics in last few months... :)
---
Having only seen play in a single competitive deck for less than a month with no prospect of seeing play in any other deck, that is definitely pack filler. 
---
I remember when Dr. Boom was considered OP
---
Thanks mate, so with golden epic I have profit 400 dust if I dust it afterwards if I'm right?
---
True, i have now two golden Dragon Roars :D
---
With the Faerie Dragon and the year of the Dragon this makes for a very "in-theme" 5 rank reward
---
[Don't cut yourself.](https://imgur.com/ZpJT2lm)
---
Dr Boom relied so heavily on Baku to make it past the early game, it's too soon to say if mega greedy strategies will be as viable without the massive armour boost.
---
Hear ye Hear ye

Cleaning Commencing
---
Evenwock is the exact deck that plays out differently every game depending on the opponent
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying.  Players playing completely for free don't need diverse collections full of niche cards (adventure cards tended to be build-around), they need a few solid deck archetypes that they can use to grind ladder so they can invest in cards that are actually good.
---
Adventures are bad for this type of player.  For mid tier players who just buy/preorder/save up gold for the set, adventures were insane value.  These are the type of players who benefit from getting a big chunk of strong cards to do with what they want.  LoE was when I started spending money on the game, so I've lived it from both perspectives.  
---
Dusting Baku will give you 400 dust, not 800.
---
Seeing play in a competitive deck over the course of several months (in what universe are we not considering tier 2/3 competitive?) makes something by definition not pack filler. Pack filler cards have no chance of showing up in even a *viable* deck.
---
I saw them open for Relient k right before Fireflies took off. Was very unimpressed. Couldn't handle Fireflies until like 5 years later.
---

---
First off, there already are sites like hsreplay that let you find out what the best decks are.
---
The possibility to find a unicorn deck also doesn't go away. Unicorn decks are, by definition, not being played enough to gather any significant amount of stats on them. 
---
Golden versions too. You lucky basterd.
---
All decks play differently depending on the opponent, but evenlock‚Äôs early, mid, and late game plans are consistently very similar (source: 300 wins on evenlock). Having an absurd amount of early draw means you can near guarantee your optimal plays.
---
i have 3240 dust right now, so should i craft a golden genn/baku now?
---
Barthvader #11324 NA Trade quest
---
Use the search function
---
Damn... I think you're right. I should learn from this.
---
I'm not happy either, but I recall they said all 3 will have pre-release :/ It should be allow for people who don't have the ability to go to the suitable place. Hope they will drop this idea some day.
---
What should one direct his hate is not Fire Fly, is Fungalmancer.
---
Ah that's why Jade druid is still warping wild and Baku + Genn are now only fringe playable or a package you might include in your deck... /s
---
(Wild even shaman warped the format, Odd paladin and rogue are t1 in standard and wild. Odd Warrior is a control deck with a pretty hard matchup spread) (wild Jade druid is a t3 deck now)
---
Hagatha is a card that can beat any control deck, but you have to remember that Shaman is losing a lot of cards, too. Especially cards that you can generate via Hagatha that help you win long games. 
---
Cards like Volcano, Tidal Surge, Spirit Echo, Crshing Hand, Healing Rain, Unstable Evo.
---
Ungoro belongs to Activision(TM)!
---
* The assumption is that it is dustable. (and clearly stated) If it isn't, the whole thing technically falls apart because you can't recoup that dust for ~2 years when it rotates to Wild.  Or, if you reject that assumption, then you reject the model.  Simple.  (I also don't think Blizzard would lock Whizbang 2.0 for a month or make new players spend 2800 (or 3500 gold) to get it.
---
* Wing 1 is unlikely to stay free forever.  If it's like past Adventures, ~2 weeks.  **But it doesn't change the analysis**.  Plug in your relevant cost (2800,3500, $20) to the equivalent value and gauge if it is worth it. (2,771 gold)
---
* Why 5 Wings?  If you don't analyze the whole set (5 Wings) it's easy to tell it isn't worth it. (Golden Legendary/Golden Pack is at Wing 5)  Even if Wing 1 is free, by Wing 2 you've paid 700g for 6 packs...and it gets worse until the payoff of Wing 5.
---
Nice

It still displays the same gryphon (red circle) on the next year slot in the announcement video.
---
Yeah this idea would screw 1/2 the player base, I‚Äôd be forced to only play arena.
---
These 5 rules apply to every situation ([Visual Flowchart](https://imgur.com/a/G1vK2NI)):
---
1. If you ***have a golden copy*** of the card, do nothing.
---
2. If you ***have a non-golden copy*** of the card you have a choice to make:
---
  * If you want to upgrade to a golden copy, craft the golden copy.
---
  * If you want to maximize your dust received, do nothing.
---
3. If you ***are missing max playable copies*** of any card, craft golden.
---
4. If you ***have a non-golden COMMON card***, craft golden. (See **Example 1** Below)
---
5.  If you ***don't have enough dust***, craft the highest rarity card you can.
---
Ahh. Didn‚Äôt think of that part. Guess I should craft them then. Heh.

The dinosaur you‚Äôve outlined in green is tyrantus. I don‚Äôt think the upcoming years would be displayed ahead of time.
---
Hopefully PC Gamer aren't invited back to events after they leaked this. Irresponsible and unprofessional. 
---
You might want to wait a bit. The new expansion should launch in April, which means half of the current expansion move to wild. 
---
The rogue order hall is in the Dalaran Sewers Underbelly. The warlock order hall is on another planet or something. 
---
Yep, same goes for the dinosaur (green circle). Those have been the 'placeholder' symbols every time they've announced a new year - definitely not spoilers I'm afraid!
---
Um how about the fact that your adding from decks 2 years ago, while still having to get the current expansion. It‚Äôs clearly not less expensive.
---
Oh true
---
Yeah I‚Äôve played for a couple of years now, but if they did that I would be done.
---
COULD YOU SHINE YOUR LIGHT
---
My assumption: if you have a generic Cubelock deck but are missing the Cube, it will find you the highest winrate deck with the 28/29 cards you have in your deck currently + 1-2 from your own collection. That is, it'll ask "what cards does this person have to complete this deck that will result in the highest winrate deck?"
---
&gt;Best devs we could ever hope for
---
They're really not all that great.
---
Step 1: Half-ass development of your billion dollar game for over a year to lower everyone's expectations. Make sure to especially half-ass the single-player content.
---
Step 2: Start actually putting a medium amount of work into your single-player content but charge people for access to it. 
---
Step 3: Sit back as Blizzard fanboys gargle your balls and justify the cost by saying "They're putting a lot more work into the mode now!"
---
Related, yes. Themed, no.
---
These are the general tips I give new players.  Just don't go crafting anything from Journey to Un'Goro, Knights of the Frozen Throne, or Kobolds and Catacombs.  Those 3 sets were rotate to a more expensive format (Wild) in early April.  It's fine to start now though some content, 6/7, will expire in April so I'd do them quickly.
---
##Getting Started To Hearthstone Tips
---
1.  First, all this information and more can be found in the [Reddit Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6tbyp5/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_mammoth/).
---
2.  Get all the classes to Level 10 and beat all the Expert AI bosses.  Jump into Ranked as soon as possible (Casual mode is locked until you are Rank 25.)  Don't worry, Ranks 50-26 is a one time climb.  you can't fall below Rank 25 so they are all new accounts like you.  
---
3. Also, get one class to Level 20 to unlock Tavern Brawls which get you 1 free Classic pack per week. (Wed-Sun)
---
2. Complete the opening mission in Knights of the Frozen Throne for a free Death Knight.  Death Knights are *very* impactful in a budget deck so hope for a good one.
---
3.  Open packs in each set until you unlock a Legendary.  In your first 10 packs of a set you are guaranteed a legendary whereas the normal drop rate is 1/20.  I would start with Knights of the Frozen Throne in hopes of getting another Death Knight.  Or start with a pack released in 2018 as it will last a year longer in Standard play then Knights of the Frozen Throne.  
---
5.  Complete all 3 Wings of *Knights of the Frozen Throne*.  In total, this rewards you with 1 Legendary Death Knight, 3 Packs, and special Paladin Portrait.  (Guides courtesy of /u/TommyJTheGamer)
---
  * [First Wing of Ice Crown Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6sydke/im_the_guy_who_did_the_mostly_free_to_playbasic/)
---
  * [Second Wing of Ice Crown Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6uf7g5/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/)
---
  * [Final Wing, and hardest, of Ice Crown Citadel] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6w4koa/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/).
---
11.  If you buy 1x Kobolds and Katacombs pack you will get a free Legendary, Marin the Fox.  It isn't competitive, you can't disenchant it, but it is free.
---
6. If you haven't done so, get the "Welcome Bundle" for 10 Classic packs and a free Classic Legendary Dragon.
---
7. Aim to get 5 Ranked wins each month for the free cardback and rewards.  The best rewards are at 20,15,10, and 5 so these ranks are important.  (Compared to Rank 5, Legend is only +45 dust)
---
7.  Buying in bulk is usually best.  If in doubt, focus on Classic (will always be good in Standard) and sets released in the current year.  For 2018, that is Whispering Woods, The Boomsday Project, and Rastakahn's Rumble.
---
8. You only get cardbacks but if you want help on the solo player content you can find it here:  [Kobolds and Catacombs Dungeon Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7qtrt9/noblords_guide_to_dungeon_runs/), [The Witchwood Monster Hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8ff4wy/monster_hunt_overview_and_monster_hunter_guides/), and [The Boomsday Puzzle Labs](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/puzzle-lab-guide-release-date-experiments-card-back/).

---
Isn't the first expansion related to the year theme usually. Which is dragon this time 
---
Wait, what? It was immediately obvious that they were both incredibly powerful. Like, pre-day one, we were all saying that. 
---
Best win rate without context doesn't mean much.  You still need a viable curve and a coherent deck, which win rate doesn't capture.
---
I remember before Walk the Plank came out doing this with voodoo doll and backstab. I love all the ceative ways people get decks to work
---
It‚Äôs not a paywall if you can purchase it with gold. 
---
And I‚Äôm not against optional contact costing money anyway. So no, I don‚Äôt. 
---
I actually lost to Mechathun warrior, He played his legendary spell (forgot the name, was it Boomship?) that pulled out Malygos and Mechathun, then did bloodrage on Mechathun, 2nd one on Malygos and then Whirlwind that killed all. 
---
Which is another reason I dislike the way they nerfed it. Changing its original purpose so it can still be played in a nerfed version of a deck no one liked except the person playing it.
---
Complaining about net decking is so sad. You're not smart or creative for making off-meta decks. If that's what you enjoy, that's cool. But it's so pathetic to call people braindead for playing the best decks.
---
Yeah I ran her is my big spell mage deck to legend a couple of months back, usually had it going when you needed it.
---
Dr Value wasn't even good enough to be an auto include in Baku decks. 
---
Without the extra armour from Baku, it will be far, far harder to play. No matter how good he is, he's still a big do nothing on the turn you play him.
---
I honestly think he will be in less decks than Supercollider.
---
It's honestly bullshit that they did us like that. I crafted two Doomerangs thinking I was close enough to rotation to invest in a Wild deck once it goes there and then they fucked me.
---
I remember them both being so obviously powerful that they were both day one crafts, and I almost never craft anything. 
---
I mean it's possible, but look at the arch shapes in Auchenai Crypts or Exodar, or most Outland/Draenei structures. It's a better shape match. We all want Dalaran, but I don't think it's happening this year. 
---
blizzard literally said that the card is a new whizbang type card, its not a theory lol
---
Agreed.  
---
You're missing a very important component - the golden legendary tips the scales and actually makes it a decent value on top of the player content. 
---
Wow! Maybe I shouldn't complain much haha. Would be nice if the amount you drop was somehow proportional to how much you play, within reasonable limits. But that has some drawbacks too.
---
Oh ye, we all know that jamming the 30 highest win rate cards into a deck will get you automatically to legend, who needs a even curve, when you can play ten 8 drops with sick winrates.
---
I suggest you stick to"braindead" netdecking if you seriously think that an improved deck builder is gonna make the game more stale, than it already is.
---
[[Academic Espionage]] is such a fun card if you can survive past turn 4.
---
Shrines can‚Äôt attack turn one during tavern brawl, not sure if they changed rumble run too. 
---
I didn't mention skill at all in the comment you replied to.
---
Time is the most important factor by far. Even if you lack skill and experience, you will get both of those if you spend enough time playing. Which is why players are grouped primarily based on the amount of time they spend on the game, and not just by some kind of rating like in chess.
---
Over the last few days I've seen one Tyrion, no lich Kings, but I honestly get more discovers with this guy than ones I don't

What the hell is an in-game tournament mode anyways? Everyone keeps saying to add a tournament mode, but I can't think of a single thing about a tournament mode that I would actually care about in any way. Please explain this 'tournament mode' thing.

---
Thank you sir, this was a nice little argument. I hope you have a good day.
---
&gt;It's not going to know how you plan to play the deck; the outcome you want is to win, so figuring out how to give you the best chance of doing that is all it needs to do.
---
That's the thing. If you have 15 cards in a deck utilizing certain synergies and there exist other cards that fit in with that play style to make *that deck* better, the algorithm recommending other cards that fit in with *another deck* doesn't actually make you win more.
---
Omg, I didn't realize his tar boii was getting cycled out. If any card deserves this meme it's this bad ass.
---
What a great card. Never oppressive. Always a consideration but never an auto-include. Had elemental synergy to boot. F
---
Drago#1509 NA 80g you first &lt;3
---
With all the cards being HoF'd, they should really add some cards back into the classic set. Tar Creeper would be an easy choice; it defines the niche of a 3-drop taunt without being overpowered/oppressive.
---
So you're playing that deck and try to defend it. Always great when someone isn't biased at all, is it?
---
*Ready for action!*
---
Saving in your windows folder is bad.  If you want to use this technique do this:
---
1. Make a batch folder of something like "c:\batches".  
---
2. Hit windows+pause.  
---
3. Click "Advanced system settings". 
---
4. Click "Environment Variables...". 
---
5. Select "Path" in the "User variables for ###" or "System variables" box (user will only effect your account, system will effect every account)
---
6. Click the corresponding "Edit..." button.
---
7. Click "New"
---
8. Type in "c:\batches" or whatever the folder you created is.
---
9. Click "OK"
---
10. Click "OK"
---
Now any time you tell windows to run a program and don't give it a path it will also look in your batch folder while keeping your windows folder clean
---
If you're planning on dusting them and you don't have the regular version yet then yes gold is better to craft. If you have regular versions already then it makes no difference if you craft a golden a golden or not.
---
really wild, all cards pre nerf 
---
Exactly.  If you craft all of the HoF cards, you'll get all the dust back and keep the cards.  You lose nothing but short-term dust.
---
Agree, I'm betting that other classes will get similar hero cards with a similar power level and everything will balance out.
---
I liked them. 
---
On top of this year's calendar there was an Eye of Dalaran inside an inverted triangle exactly like the one in the revealed cardpack. Not to mention the colorscheme for the first xpac in that picture is basically Jaina's robes. 
---
At this point Dalaran's Underbelly seems like a sure bet, unless they are deliberately trolling us. 
---
Post the original?
---
I'm actually playing Odd Quest Warrior now trying to get my 500 wins with Warrior(last one to get). Both Tar Creeper and Stonehill are staples. Gonna miss them both. :(
---
They don't. It just so happens they disappear in a book case at the "Glorious Goods" shop. They are very stealtily studious. 
---
* Rin, the first Disciple
---
I had that thought, just need some dust for it now lol
---
I got holomancer.
---
Well, it's for guests only
---
Bent up in arms? I simply pointed out that comments like "now we get cards for the gold" or "this is going to be way more content than the free stuff" or "now we get rewards for it unlike with recent adventures" are all stupid.
---
Eating sugar? 
---
Have you disabled streamer mode?
---
I feel like I'm the only player in the game who hates both of those cards. People always describe them as good without being OP, but they are OP. They just don't feel as bad to lose to as other OP cards. But if your opponent plays 1-Drop into Double Firefly into Tar Creeper into some kind of board buff, you probably just lost the game. But for some reason it doesn't bother people on this board the way a Tarim or a Cloning Gallery does. 
---
Although I think a lot of my bitterness comes from the fact that I started playing as a Hunter Main during Mean Streets and Ungoro. And Hunters best turn one play was Ally Cat, which was completely wrecked by patches from aggro, and Firefly/Tar Creeper from midrange and control.

My god, if Ulduar comes to Hearthstone I might reinstall. 
---
What other neutral minion restricts the design of entire keyword? And additionally one of the most common keywords?
---
That's what I'm worried about. Aggro is literally *the worst* thing that Hearthstone ever had to endure. A lot of tools being used to create OTK's to win from behind, tools to swing you back into the game like the Priest quest, and efficient taunts like those you mention are all rotating, making it impossible to stop the aggro decks (which are already enough of a problem even as much as people like to proclaim that aggro is dead).
---
At least [[Fungalmancer]] is rotating too... that little shit needed to be HoF last year.
---
They were discovered to be obscenely powerful as soon as people actually started playing with them. It's hypothetically possible that Blizzard tried playing with some of the cards before releasing them (a stretch, I know).

Precisely. Let's put one of the most notorious combo cards there alongside with the rest so the design space would open up a little more.

Actually, aggro decks abuse cheap, efficient taunts even more than control, as it protects their board (ignoring the likes of Odd Rogue).

They've done discounted wild packs in the past, there are reasons you could still end up opening wild packs in the future. In any case, if you craft goldens and disenchant them, you gain 800 dust. If you ever want them in the future, a pair of non-goldens... costs you 800 dust. So you'd end up in the same place. Crafting goldens and dusting them gives you flexibility, you can end up with the same result if you want (0 dust gained, 2 non-golden Moths), or you can use the 800 dust elsewhere.
---
And if you're planning on keeping them... why wouldn't you make them goldens? You get a full refund either way. Dust cost to you is 0 whether they're golden or non-golden.
---
Made me actually think about how many decks I've ran him in over the last two years. 
---
Also makes me afraid of what I'll be stuck with in his place. Belligerent gnome? Ehh. I really hope something similar comes in the next expansion.
---
I agree of it was best deck for rank that would be annoying 
---
Wait... Stonehill isn't a classic card?
---
Agreed. I didn't really run into them too much on latter. 
---
Whats happening to it??
---
At least you didn‚Äôt have any golden ones

Hey PokeVerse5873, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
I never check the expiration dates I guess 
---
Can it ever really be said enough though? With Baku gone, plus K&amp;C and Death Knights rotating, maybe HS can be fun again
---
I was almost in the same boat... I loaded heartstone by chance and realized I was 1 day from missing my first monthly card back and decided to slog through 5 games with whatever fotm t1 deck i could find.  Turns out it was hilariously easy compared to arena, especially since I decayed to rank 20. :D
---
You definitely have a point, but I have no interest in golden cards, so I'll just be crafting regular ones :)
---
Makes sense. Look at the expansions thatre going to be alongside it in the first season of arena. Mean streets, whispers, witchwood, and naxx. All of which are kinda dark and spooky and gritty. 
---
You‚Äôre probably right, I guess both sides will be affected.
---
Sorry i dont
---
I'm surprised the poisonous win rate is so low, with so many taunts in the meta
---
There were much worse offenders in those decks than Zola. Sonya and Grumble were the real enablers.
---
Then just don't play Deathlord against Big Priest? It's not like a  2/8 taunt would be useful anyway.
---
Even better now with the 1/1 lynx with rush
---
Even if you have no interest in goldens (I don't either) you should still craft goldens. Again, the cost is 0 either way. If you open up non-golden Moths in the future, you could then disenchant the golden Moths for 400 dust each. If you craft non-goldens, cost is still 0, but if you open up non-golden Moths in the future, you only get 100 dust for the extras.
---
There is *literally* no reason to not craft goldens unless you don't have and can't get the dust for it before rotation.
---
Would the current arena wins be converted towards the golden hero portraits after the changes are made?
---
And if so, how would the dual-class arena event work with it
---
Well the devs surely know a thing or two about new cards coming into the game so I wouldn't question that decision so quickly.
---
Truesilver Champion.
---
 
---
Staple Paladin card, no one gets mad at it.
---
The first thing Chromie did was go back in time and remove Genn and Baku lmao
---
Baku is literally the only card I have ever crafted in the first two weeks of an expansion. There was practically 0 chance it wouldn't see tier 1 play.
---
Oh, he's bragging. 
---
Well, Naxx was the first expansion to go there, so maybe 
---
So is Baku and the quest, so really just the whole deck is getting moved to wild lol 
---
idk, WotOG is up there
---
Totally. I loved Creeper and Stonehill but Sludge Belcher was the OG of beautiful taunt cards. Am I showing my age more when I say I was excited to replace Senjin with it? I think Creeper was probably the best design of all of them though - Belcher and Stonehill were probably too powerful.
---
What can I say, I'm a terrified player - I need to hide behind a wall at all times! Holding out hope for some new good taunts in the expansion. Belligerent Gnome is cost effective but a little too weak to cut it.
---
To beat another aggro decks. That's how overpowered it was.
---
Almost like control decks using Corridor Creeper when it was 5/5.
---
it was fun but unbalanced, which is okay because video games are for having fun, and insane because in a CCG almost always being strong is synonymous with being fun
---
Charge was a bad idea in a game without any way to interact on your opponent's turn.
---
They've been replacing slots in classic with new cards.
---
Legend rank.
---
Definitely a good one. Although sometimes I get salty when the paladin draws BOTH Truesilvers to completely destroy me in the mid game. But otherwise it definitely fits the bill. 
---
It also has a much lower initial impact than a lot of other DKs, especially at 9 Mana.
---
The most impressive thing for me is how many people actually own Gloom Stag.
---
Kingsbane was actually pretty fun imo, especially when you made the enemy mill it 
---
Quality post
---
Get that corridor creeper shit outta here
---
DK's are an obvious one, I personally hate Gnomeferatu and will not miss it at all.
---
The death knight cards, particularly Gul'Dan and Jaina since they are auto-includes in any deck. Every game with a mage and a warlock, no matter what kind of deck they run, turns into a slow grind that you will probably eventually lose if you didn't draw your DK first.
---
I don't really enjoy how you can have 29 throwaway cards in your deck and still manage to win games off of 1 card. They also killed regular control/fatigue decks by merely existing.
---
The only thing I actually hate about him is his magnetize effect. He‚Äôs a mini Reno Jackson in my deathrattle rogue deck. 
---
The top 3 decks in the last VS Wild Report were Odd Rogue, Even Warlock, and Odd Paladin. Even Shaman was 5th. 
---
In the previous report, in late November, there were 4 tier 1 decks: Odd Paladin, Even Warlock, Odd Rogue, Even Shaman. Even Shaman had the lowest win rate of those four, at 53.39%. The highest non-even-odd winrate was 51.80%.
---
In October the top 3 were Odd Rogue, Even Shaman, Odd Paladin.
---
In September the top 2 were Odd Rogue and Even Shaman.
---
In July... top 2 were Odd Paladin and Odd Rogue.
---
June top 3, Even Shaman, Odd Paladin, Odd Rogue.
---
That was the first report with actual stats, but the meta report before that, from May, first report after Witchwood came out, they said Tier 1 was (in order) Even Shaman, Secret Paladin, Odd Rogue, Aggro Paladin, Even Paladin, Big Priest, Cube Warlock.
---
That's every VS Report since Witchwood. If you don't think Even/Odd are dominating, again, you aren't paying attention and aren't playing high rank Wild.
---
Perfectly balanced. 
---
\[\*\]
---
Wait, river croc is classic though
---
So why is it being phased out?
---
Uldum, not Ulduar. Ulduar has already "kinda" been explored in Goblins vs Gnomes with cards like Flame Leviathan and Mimiron's Head.
---
Uldum is something different. Still Titan, but with more Tol'vir (Tol'vir Warden/Stoneshaper) and less Mechagnome.
---
And with more life-ending superweapon and less Yogg-Saron.
---
He rolled literally the only single card that could make him win the game, very skilled.
---
I fully agree.
---
Hearthstone could always use more Yogg.
---
I don\`t know 
---
Wrenchgirl We Wrenchgirl Like Wrenchgirl Ike Wrenchgirl
---
&gt; It might be best to wait to craft cards until the Expansion is near. We still have at least 8 free packs and end of season rewards left.
---
What packs are you referring to? The classic free packs from the Tavern Brawl? 
---
He's at 7.  He loses to Fireball no matter what play he makes, so there's no reason to play around it.  Going based on board (since we have no way of knowing what is in the Paladin's hand) any play that isn't testing for Ice Block and then, if it is Ice Block, killing the 2/1, is a bad play.
---
Can you please find one for Black Cat? Thanks in advance!
---
I agree on the most part, but would you really enjoy playing against Surrender to Madness or Hakkar if they had enough support to be played in a T1 deck?
---
You might be the first person I've heard say that. But to each their own. 
---
Whoa thanks dude, I'll do my best to avoid him.
---
Oh holy hell. They bumped up the rewards of weaker quests. The stronger ones are as is.
---
Yes, but he has fireball in hand
---
YoUrE nOt GeTtInG tHe JoKe
---
Just Shadow Visions in general. Such a flexible card.
---
That damn snake.
---
I mean, the chance of hitting the taunt minion is more then 1/2, so you can't really use that symmetry argument. To calculate that explicitly is not that nice to write out, but I could do so if you wanted to.
---
It is interesting that for more targets the odds of hitting the face are similar: The odds can be calculated in a similar fashion, giving x = 1 + (1 - 1/n)1/2 x which results in  x = 1/(1/2 + 1/2n) = 2n/(n + 1) giving odds of n/(n + 1).
---
* Warlock - self-sabotage
---
* Paladin - Strong legendary cards, weak spells, minion-based focus
---
* Rogue - "Trickster" (their words, not mine), strong single-target removal, weak (non-existent) AOE, no taunts and no heal.
---
* Hunter - Limited resources, aggressive spells and minions
---
* Priest - Reactive spells. Weak early game.  Play cards from opponents deck/board/hand/class.
---
* Warrior - Armor and Weapons
---
* Druid - Adaptability. A mix of a Warrior and a Mage.
---
* Mage - Strongest spells.
---
* Shaman - Jack of All Trades (master of none). RNG-based outcomes for minions/spells.
---
Best game director ever.
---
I LOVED Un'Goro. Felt like a fun, fair set (minus a few outliers like rogue quest). Knights was really good too IMO but the hero cards were a tad bit too good.
---
Yeah, their face when you burn it with gnomeferatu is priceless.
---
And the reason it hasn't been used more is because Team 5 are extremely aware of the problems it can cause.
---
Master's Call gets me a bit on edge with how much cheap beasts can become big threats, but for the most part I agree. Other great sets for balance in my opinion were Un'goro and Whispers of the Old Gods. I had so much fun with both of those. 
---
DK Rexxar too. He was so cool when he was in standard, but I‚Äôll be happy when I don‚Äôt need to go to fatigue against hunter any more
---
Fs in the chat boys.
---
Just priest in general
---
i cant wait until blizzard HoFs my golden malygos
---
It does not overwrite, noticed it last week on my barely used Asia account
---
Don't forget about [Tar Lord!](https://i.imgur.com/5zGGlHU.jpg)
---
Um...how often do you see your opponent's face when you play hearthstone?
---
Fungalmancer is leaving too fortunately 
---
i still hate the leeching nerf, all it did was kill the card; they should have made it 5 attack per hit or so or made it restore health on kills, wouldve stopped infinite healing,wouldve made second copy not useless,would have extra synergy with valeera the hollow. but nope they ruined the card.
---
Legit almost shed a tear.  Well played
---
I don't understand this meme. Why would he say no and then contradicte himself right away. Should it not be "Yes, I heard you we're the best"?
---
Prolly think it‚Äôs not safe from last couple of weeks
---
HS before: "We don't want to invalidate players decks." and almost all my decks are invalidated, except Miracle Rogue and midrange Hunter (which loses Rexxar, Flanking, Mole and Razormaw at rotation)
---
Based on my recent complaints in the why is this no longer your main game topic...
---
\- Decks cost too much: Odd Pally was the second cheapest deck and made Odd Rogue and Mage affordable too because they shared so many cards. Also Odd Hunter but that wasn't good anyway. Now they're all gone and the average deck cost will continue to be in the 10k+ range. 
---
\- Too much anti-aggro, healing/armor, games taking too long: Killed aggro entirely ensuring this will continue. Every game in the 10+ minute range.
---
\- Too many OTK type decks: Put Naturalize in the hof to hit Hakkar...which was dead on rotation without Tog anyway. Maly and Velen untouched. With any form of aggro gone until we see some new cards, these decks lack counters at all even though aggro was hardly effective as is.
---
\- Getting screwed on related crafts when a card is nerfed/hof'd: Jan'ali &amp; Daring Fire Eater now 90% less useful, no refunds. Crafted Luna for Odd Aggro Mage and got a month and a half out of her.
---
\- Not sure if I had included this but adventures being free was great. Now it's between saving up 2800 gold for 28 packs or 12 packs, a cardback and golden pack. New expansion day comes and I'm either opening packs and hopefully getting good stuff or saving for adventure wings and horribly falling behind. 
---
Pretty sure the nerf was because of wild. The heropower synnerguses with Totem themed cards like Thing from Below, 4 mana 7/7 etc and Totem Golem. Was a ver very strong deck and is now barely seen after the nerfs (but likely to reappear).
---
Yes, but you have to understand that devs literally dismantled foundation of the class - Classic cards. So from now on Druids will have to rely on insanely strong expansion cards to perform at all. Just like Blizzard has to print ridiculous AoE for Priests every year...
---
Nothing like good old Year of the BRM, TGT and LoE
---
The fact that you like this card is really all the proof I need that you have terrible taste.
---
What other carda do you like? Ozruk? Umbra? All the legendaries that nobody wants to ever open. 
---
You know what dollmaster dorian reminds me of? That crappy 7 mana hunter legenday. Is that another card you like? 
---
Kingsbane, Vilespine Slayer, Aluneth
---
Good riddance.
---
Not even busted. Metas literally never been more diverse.
---
Can somebody clarify, are we getting a new expansion with a new card pack etc like boomsday un‚Äôgoro etc, or are we just getting a new adventure which we earn the cards from
---
Kirin Tor Tour.
---
You know what? I'm not quitting this. What you are basically saying is, that everyone who is using pre-made cooking recipe is dumb and only Michelin star chefs are smart. You, sir, are nor right. You are just plain wrong. 
---
"Was I a good boi?" -Pupper.
---
&gt; we hit a card at the power level of Thaurissan
---
Dr. 7?!!!?!!!?!?!? 
---
Shaman's weakness also tend to be inconsistency, what with Overload and all.  
---
Whispers of the Old Gods was the most fun I had with. Rip original Yogg
---
My problem with it is how incredibly backloaded it is.  2300 of the expected 3500 dust return comes at the very end.  Wings 2-4, 700g for only 3 packs, feels pretty miserable.  Yes, once you're done it works out, but I'd have much rather have had a normal leg and the no free 1600 dust value doubling the packs per wing.
---
Roger was involved in some wintrading apparently and was not reprimanded rightfully in the eyes of many
---
That sounds crazy man. Have Troggs tried DMT?
---
DKs are cool :(
---
On the first day he did an OTK kill on turn 9 of a Druid who had 30 health and over 30 armour.
---
Brilliant Marketing. and it was so genuine with BBrode just doing this with earbuds and at house house. No one was better at hyping up hearthstone than BBrode. It shows how badly we miss him. 
---
I will be in bliss when the Saronite Chain Gang into Fungalmancer finally dies.
---
I shall laugh as they shrink into oblivion, punished for all the pain they have caused
---
Glad you wrote it
---
Wow. It‚Äôs almost been a year since he abandoned us. Time flies when you stop playing
---
I just crafted the 2 golden legendaries and it hurt me physically knowing I will be part of the problem the next few weeks playing these gay ass decks
---
I feel like people say this only because they like Brode. Objectively, Team 5 now do much better work after Brode is gone.
---
Constant patches, best Arena, not afraid to rotate expansion cards ahead of time. And Year of Dragon has more new features than HS had since beta release.
---
Was honestly not as powerful (on its face) as Thaurissan would prove to be.
---
Dr. 7 was a great tempo play, but its' biggest enabler was dr. 6, arguably an even better card even though it was class specific. I don't think I can name a single card that I hated more in hearthstone than "WHO AM I?", not even anything they've dumped in classic.
---
uhhh those cards aren't rotating lol he was obviously talking about cars that are rotating
---
KeithG97#1895 NA ready for 18th quest swap. You first. :D
---
God, 4/3 Dire Mole on round 2 is so satisfying.
---
Yep, and if he didn't win that turn he was dead from 30 health to divine spirits, PWS, inner fire, mass dispel zzz
---
Gotta love this meta
---
800
---
No
---
Full dust value for only each Golden Copy
---
Sludge Belcher makes a return in arena!
---
That's because they don't really want you to buy it with gold, they want you to buy it with money. 
---
But, they still leave the gold option there for the f2p grinders.
---
Reno and Kazakus were very unfun to play against. As an aggro if your oponent had Reno in hand you would lose 80% of the time. So meta was full of hyper aggro decks. I don't miss it.
---
Jade druid was its own problem tho. Its like bringing in wasps to deal with a mosquito problem 
---
That's ActiBlizz for ya. 
---
I wonder what's the winrate of playing Razermaw on turn 2
---
Yes
---
It‚Äôs a counter deck vs kingsbane. It‚Äôs not fit for ladder
---
What was your deck like? A lot of my runs start like 2-2 or 3-2 and end aroung 5-2 or 6-2. Current max wins is 10. Too often i am on a good run and get a phone call or something stupid that ruins it.
---
Can't wait to see who will replace the little guy :)
---
It will rotate out of standard play format when the next set comes out.
---
Odd Warrior my man. 
---
Hearthstone: The Kirin Tour
---
Yeah after 3 additional content releases. They didn‚Äôt even nerf it because of boom. It was because of wotog being released. Imagine having your ten mana cthun being sniped by bgh and having the opponent play boom. That‚Äôs why it was nerfed. 
---
Well Crackling Razormaw, Candle Shot, Death-stalker Rexxar, Emerald Spellstone, and Flanking Strike are all rotating soon among others. That should take the down a few pegs. 
---
Hyena spent years not being played. Last time Midrange Hunter was a thing (KFT), they don't even play Hyena regularly. It is a snowball card but is usually beatable. Or you can play around it by not going wide against UtH.
---
For comparison Flamewreathed Faceless was a 4 mana 7/7. (7+7)/4 = 3.5 value per mana.
---
Snowflipper Penguin is a 0 mana 1/1. (1+1) / 0 = Infinite value per mana.
---
Wow
---
1)Doomguard actually sticks on board so not actually worse than Leeroy.
---
2)Doomguard is rare and Leeroy is legendary.
---
3)Probably limits the demon synergy cards they plan to release inthe future because of the charge.
---
Time for a 0-cost Dragon. With the Year of the Dragon, I think it's even likely. Every Expansion needs a really cute card.
---
But I'm also looking forward to the inevitable 0-mana Pirate, Demon and Elemental
---
Okay now we've gone too far. Fuck that turtle (except when he's mine)
---
‚Ä¢ Silverback Patriarch
---
They never showed that mercy to Murloc Tinyfin but for Cute Cat and Snowflipper it became a *thing*
---
Yes, since the earliest days of witchwood. But not *before* then, so what is your point? I acknowledged that people figured they were problems after release, but you first claimed that ‚Äúwe all‚Äù knew before that and then that ‚Äúanyone who played a card game other than hs‚Äù knew but both times you moved the goalpost, first in that instance there and then just now by going from ‚Äúbefore witchwood‚Äù to ‚Äúearly days of witchwood‚Äù. It‚Äôd be a lot easier to just admit that it wasn‚Äôt as clear as you claim it was that genn and Baku would end up being huge problems 
---
You get the full value of the two most valuable ones in your collection.  In this case it would be two Goldens.  If he only had one Golden it would be the value of one golden and one normal 
---
same, fuck that turtle ass bitch
---
Dire Mole is such a good minion. I love it.
---
Yeah Firefly is busted. It just doesn‚Äôt feel that way to the average player I guess. Every time I see it or play it I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthis card is stupid.‚Äù  
---
My guess, discover over draw
---
I'm new to hearthstone and I've seen this card before. Has it been discontinued?? 
---
Apparently, I just got [Tad's Pole](https://i.imgur.com/20V87Jb.jpg). It must have played some part in my win on the first try because that deck looks like relative crap with little synergy otherwise. Maybe I had big legendaries to go with the scepter of summoning.
---
I've never seen Tad before or after this run. For any other advice, I'd probably suggest going with the biggest minions possible + scepter + recruit cards or something.
---
I found entering and exiting the store works too.
---
It‚Äôs the underbelly of Dalaran with the Kirin Tor a little more different probably less monster and kobolds and more mages and sewer criminals.
---
Nice catch. 
---
I JUST LOVE ROGUE MAN, HOPE IT'S NEVER TIER 3.
---
Witchhunt ebjoy ur ban!
---
In the beta, Leeroy cost four mana. The Blizzard announcement of his nerf is also the source of the "fun and interactive" meme/copypasta, as it was justified by saying:
---
&gt; Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive
---
Many players find that Shudderwock/Mecha'thun/Druid/whatever reddit is upset about violates the spirit of what Blizzard said there, leading to the "fun and interactive" posts you often see in discussions about combos.
---
Ugly as F though.
---
Pepega
---
...Mind Control hasn't been 8 mana since before the game's official release. 
---
It honestly wouldn't surprise me if Priest has been bad for more of the game's lifespan that it has been good. 
---
Do we get dust for both gold and normal
---
Aaargh i forgot to get ranked chest i missed out on pizza card back! Damn i'm sad now
---
Hey there!
---
Rastakhan set up the destruction of the last seal, it was an inside job. 
---
But that's just a theory...
---
3 different times in the last year too. Like damn couldn‚Äôt keep it down.

---
Yes and it was a very bad time. Priest needs to be bad, when priest is good hearthstone is much less fun.
---
Yeah that was way worse it all started with patches 
---
You will find the only anawer on Oprah
---
It was always true until recently. At one time, they built an archetype around Hunter having an empty hand.
---
And the same has been said about Druid, Shaman, Mage, Warrior, Warlock, Hunter, Rogue, and Paladin. 
---
Fact is, oppressive and super strong decks make hearthstone much less fun, it doesn't matter what class it is. 
---
So let me get this straight... based on what you said, I will get 1600 dust for Baku and then I can DE him for an additional 400 dust? So when rotation hits, I can get 2000 dust for Baku? Is this real life?
---
