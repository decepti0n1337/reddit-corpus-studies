I am throughly convinced
---
---
---
What is it?
---
Thanks for the advice and the link, this helps a lot. I think I was pretty lucky with the first 2 drafts because I'm pretty bad with playing slower heroes, haha. RIP Rogue.
---
wild population is creeps only, beware
---
and how i get 1 gig with my slow very fucking slow cnx i mean 512 Kbs in 30 seconds???
---
It's not on the card as a keyword on the actual lackies
---
What would be the highest on a Hearthstone Storm Scale? Recruit, maybe?
---
Remember when hearthstone was good
---
Least fave to play is probably Shaman, and least fave to play against is 100% mage. Between secret mage where I can’t play my cards because Explosive Runes and Counterspell are a thing, and Qiest Mage where I have lost games to Time Warp + Arcane Giants on goddamn turn 5, as well as getting multiple ice blocks from random generation effects just makes me think the entire class is bullshit
---
Thanks so much for recommending the videos! The videos are pretty helpful because I was definitely playing Mages and slower decks wrong. Also, the links from the "Hearthstone Beginners Guide: Year of the Dragon" were much appreciated: I have a lot more content to read over.
---
It will be enough for about 70-80 packs if you are not going to buy adventure in the meantime. What you will be able to build from that depends mostly on pack rng. In the long run it works for me and I always have meta deck - but I keep all cards, look for cheapest option for non golden class that I can build from what I already have. For example for current meta I could build control warrior for about 4k dust (crafting dr boom, Elysiana, 2 epics) i got the rest from the packs. I have it already golden, so I'm not going to build it, instead it will be combo priest for 1.6 dust or I will rebuild my cyclone mage from previous meta into new meta mage for x dust.
---
Because I've tried it multiple times and still sometimes play it because Reno decks are my favorite and the current standard ones aren't that interesting?
---

---
Wrote that before reading your last paragraph. Holy shit, you're dumb as rocks.
---
Let me disenchant cthun blizzard, i don’t play wild and i want the 400 dust!!
---
I was with you until the Dr. Boom nerfs. Warrior doesn't have a good hero card in wild. Nerfing Dr. Boom removes its already slim viability in wild
---
Autochess is great
---
I’ve universally hated playing against Rouge. And recently, control warrior, it’s no battle back and forth, it’s just removal every damn turn and bombs
---
Starting to save now is the best way indeed. I am at 1300 gold already, because of some generous friends (80g quest) and good outcomes of the brawl. 
---
I usually save ~10k each 4 months.
---
Can’t make this shit up, I honestly thought it said copy your opponent’s homework.. god dammit copy homework memes are taking over me
---
to make it zAnY and wAcKy
---
Oh shit, Mr. Badass Toughguy here.  I don't give a rat's ass what happens in other games.  I just want to be able to pre-block dickwads like you.

Kind of interesting they put Combo Priest as low Tier 2 when HSReplay stats have it as closer to a top Tier 2 deck. And some players on competitivehs are predicting it is indeed either a Tier 1 or high Tier 2 deck, sporting very high winrates.
---
Blizzard deserve that spit to their face.
---
Likewise, not everyone gets C'Thun.
---
No other card works that way. Keywords are not tribes.
---
If c Thun wasn't free then you would literally be pulling bloodfen raptors and crocolists from packs and that feels bad
---
Yeah. C'Thun was viable enough to drown out the main archetype for normal builds too at the time. The current quests kind of require you to build the whole thing with it in mind. 7 cards for Cthun wasnt too much....hell in Priest you could not run the Heal 10 Hp to hero one. Warlock didn't need their specific one either.
---
&gt;Grind is subjective your right about that.
---
What? No. That's not what I'm saying.
---
Do you consider 50 games a month a grind? What about 100?
---
&gt;But luck and skill is something I think everyone needs to get there.
---
Do you really think people who get there with a 70% winrate needed luck? What about 60%?
---
There are absolutely garbage cards that are fine to disenchant if I  got cenarius even before this quest came along I wouldn’t disenchant it
---
Ask your ISK or some shit I don’t know, I watched the launcher say “1.something gigs remaining”.
---
no, i still win, every quest paladin plays Truesilver and i don’t care about concentration
---
im playing the list from zetalot with Butterhead, wich is pretty nuts in that matchup 
---
I didn’t see a single spellbreaker yet
---
unfortunately no, you need a  Chinese e-mail to create an account but if you really interest at this event I can teach you how to download chinese server and give you a new account for free
---
And you 3 faces as an added bonus!
---
Fan fiction is more so written like someone spilling gossip, than actual structured prose.
---
And importantly, across turns
---
did you even read it isnt about winning. Win or lose you still lose your mind.
---
How does one fuck a card?
---
I quite enjoy playing against control warrior 80% of the time I flog them
---
From your point of view the player who play armor druid also play the cards he want and also have paid these card, so what the problem ? If you don't want to lose this matchup, just put two geist in your deck to easily get 99% Winrate, or run exodia deck !

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
 Try this deck bruv crushes warrior
---
You will if you just eat less fiber. I believe in you!
---
My worry with the deck has been florist hitting maly, I experienced enough useless discounts on floop last year to drive me insane and now you can miss on Elise too - how had it felt for you?
---
Yep that and being able to cheat out big demons as early as turn 4 with the coin. Even if you felt with the cube there was still dangers to be had.
---
I used up 7700 gold on packs. Just from trying to clear quests every third day
---
Tempo single target removal is a rogue thing.
---
*Laughs in Shield Slam, Devastate, "SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST", etc.*
---
Control warrior has many bad matchups. Anything that keeps aggro  in check is healthy for meta. A slight nerf to dr.boom is all it needs.
---
It's still weaker than murloc paladin with turn 4 prismatic lens
---
Also loses to warrior no matter what
---
I mean, even though it won’t work out this way, mind games tells us it’s fine either way because you can always use the dust to recraft a non-golden quest if you suddenly felt otherwise.
---
But we all know it’s Gruul time.
---
I have a feeling this is still the tip of the iceberg in regards to insane combos possibilities from Zephrys
---
I wish I could get that much!
---
I enjoy Firebat and Hobbs. Firebat does a good job of explaining what he does and why. Hobbs has a great personality and plays interesting decks. Chump is another good one to look at.
---
I don't buy this heavy handed argument that mountain giant, which has been situationally viable and literally never oppressive for the entirety of HS, is suddenly THE PROBLEM, all because of conjuror's calling. The trouble didn't start until CC, it's clearly the problem.   
---
Mostly Kibler just has this not subtle agenda of effectively removing the classic set, which is fair, but the dev team needs to figure the fuck out what they want to do about classic. Playing against the same powerful cards in classic for for the entire lifespan of the game sucks, but if the plan is to nerf/HoF every strong classic card then that's doing a REAL disservice to new players. All these classic packs that they earn and are encouraged to buy are just useless because they're not going to have anything in them but junk. The whole point of keeping these cards evergreen was so that players could always have a base of a collection if they took a break and then came back, but right now it's having the opposite effect of encouraging players who don't know better to invest in a useless set.   
---
It's pretty clear that the solution is to HoF the entire classic set, keep basic in standard, and then switch all the earned packs to the newest expansion(s). MTGA does this and it works fine. Maybe some kind of "season pass" like what MTGA does could work too, to let players buy in and earn more stuff.
---
The TRUE exception thou were the mage c'thun 2-drop with spelldamage. Saw plenty of tier 1 play in tempo mage but never in any c'thun deck.
---
You also need to give up the first 3 to 4 turns to play the giant while your opponent develops tempo. Also you would just about never use conjurer's calling on enemy minions because mage isn't known for their ability to hit face.
---
I suspected that when I first started playing - my first three expansions’ free legends all were from the class I played most the past season.
---
It’s changed a lot since.
---
That's not updates. That's balance changes. When was the last time we had QoL changes? New game modes? Anything that changes how hearthstone works to make it smoother or something?
---
Nah, he's a reward that's given akin to the "log in for one free class Quest". Not one opened in a pack, so it won't trigger any timers.
---
Best card in the game 👌🏻
---
You forgot one "C'Thun"
---
Blizzard thought that Wing Blast and Scorch weren't as strong as they expected so the next time they printed a similar card they made it better.
---
They only keep good ones like Discover and Rush, and kill shitty ones like Inspire.
---
To be playable where? In arena, maybe. In constructed, a decent on curve card is complete garbage. Cards have to be BUSTED to see play in constructed. To be properly playable, inspire cards would have to be on curve with 0 inspire.
---
Although I spent money on the game (bought $50 RR, RoS, and SoU bundles) I sometimes DO feel like I don’t have the dust. I started playing with two classes (Shaman and Paladin) and slowly started making Rogue and Warrior (not control warrior) decks. Now idk if I’m right but I think most of the time we don’t have the dust is bcuz of RNG. Such as, we get the legendaries from packs for the class we don’t want to play/we get garbage/unplayable cards. So far I only have Quest Shaman and Quest pally made. Thinking of playing fun decks like Mechathun rogue and highlander aggro warrior.
---
I think it was for the Nozari Placeholder bug. I haven't seen any new posts about it since the patch.
---
If so, I'm glad they finally got their priorities right. Fix Reddit first.
---
Yeah, I literally start saving on launch day. Betterto open all those shiny legendaries on release day than 2 months later when the meta is already figured out
---
*Rexxar’s Pocket Galaxy
---
Out of curiousity, does the (1) cost show up as red or green? You'd think green since it's a 4 cost spell but in theory it's supposed to cost (0) so (1) should actually be red.
---
She got the Quest and the 2 Mana Burgle card. She is one of the big enablers that make the Control Warrior matchup even possible.
---
-Dary! It’s legendary Ted, c’mon!
---
the 3 mana 2/3 legendary mech magnetic was what brought me the warlock,shaman and warrior wins. before the rise of the shadows i had also paladin in there. but thanks to the immortal prelate + lightforged blessing i got that too pretty much what you expect. immortal prelate + buffs, lich king just receives plain 1/3's based on how many times has your immortal prelate died. You can have easy game win da undatakah + immortal prelate + silver vanguard/meat wagon but undatakah's attack has been buffed. give it a taunt and you have a immortal wall, give it a lifesteal too and you can't die.
---
pretty much any deck: https://i.imgur.com/Gm3OdqC.png for warrior just combine 80 snip snaps into mech for other classes 30, note that this is just to make 1 minion to be able to one shot lich king, if you want to be safe so the lich king doesn't destroy your massive minions, just buff all of them (without the boss only card that gives lich king armor and draws few cards)
---
And every mage player quits the game XD
---
Anyone who thinks "I got salty from losing" = "people quit by the millions" doesn't really need to be answered.
---
Wing Blast 100% saw and sees play. It has no use in aggro/tempo decks which is almost all hunter has going for it but it absolutely has a place in highlander hunter and any control/midrange hunter decks. I got dad legend with malygos hunter for a few months and a single copy of Wing Blast was a huge asset in the deck.
---
probably just a typo fix then
---
Even without any discounts we can do up to ,44 just by copying moonfires so it's only against warrior we need the discount
---
Tinyfin, Hydrologist, and Murmy have necks. Hydrologist actually looks pretty close to the same kind (subspecies?) of Murloc as Finely.
---
Doesn't this tell you Conjurer's Calling is the problem then? 3 mana cube a giant is a bit much. It's like [[Molten Reflection]] for 3 mana and you get Twinspell.
---
It's to emulate Backstab.

That's what you get for not playing Nozari. Always play Nozari. Always.
---
At least this was a cheap mechanic to revisit. I miss decks where all you needed was one legendary
---
Yo don't worry, I agree with you. I think it's really fuckin dumb for people to talk like they understand the matchups when so much of the playerbase only does like 5 games a day and calls it quits. A lot of strategies people post or "KILLER DECKS!!!" are bad, but they don't know that because their only sample size is what they personally played at whatever rank they're at. And y'all know it!
---
Pyro shrink ray zeff
---
I hope with packs bought after that many games they could afford Brann for real.
---
Razakus, Resurrect, Control, Deathrattle, Mecha'thun and APM have all been viable Priest archetypes in the past. DS/IF was Priest's main wincon in just a couple metas.
---
Not saying you should like the class, it's my least played one, too. I just wanted to point out it's not as one dimensional as you claimed.

That 4/2 with Divine shield and the 2/1 with battle cry deal 2 weren’t unplayable trash. Neither was the 3/4 for 3 when it was only the 2nd one of those ever printed.
---
:(
---
My condolences
---
Idk why you were downvoted. Dark Arakkoa was almost an auto include in Druid for its vanilla stats alone.
---
Which is what makes it a debate. The evolution of character design is a subjective topic. Your counterpoints aren't objectively wrong since it's a matter of opinion, but neither are his. Thus you both were debating and there was no need to call his opinions wrong.
---
In my experience, he will sometimes offer ooze instead of apprentice when playing vs rogue, so there might be a hole in your combo. Dunno if there's a way to ensure apprentice every time, how did you test it?
---
C'thuun CTHUUN #CTHUUUN
---
They did an update to the Boomsday set. 2 cards from each class were buffed and a new legendary was given to everyone.
---
Yeah I can no longer take a shit without my legs falling asleep.
---
The only time I stick around is when I have a deathrattle deck that shits all over their million board clears. Anything else is an inevitable dead end and I’ll end up wasting a half hour. Ya gotta wonder how absolutely dull they are that they’re willing to spend upwards of an hour just to get a single win. Not like it takes intelligence either, just the ability to autopilot board clears and wait for the opponent to concede out of boredom.
---
Just for a rule I never dust legendaries because everytime I do either I unpack it again or it becomes really useful. I'd say no,  just dust goldens you don't use
---

The fact with boom it has rush is like 16 damage for 4 mana it’s so op.
---
I opened 7 Mischief Makers, one gold. Had to craft so many epics I missed which was super lame.
---
I opened 60 packs this expansion and got 2 legendaries. Yet another friend opened 55 and got 7 including a golden legend. It's all just RNG
---
this is now real creativity kudos we need more content like this on sub
---
Everything that mage and warlock stand for.
---
I wish they'd stop pushing out 100mb+ updates without any warning, because I don't want to use my mobile data.
---
Warrior is actually a really cool class ngl but it’s sad that many decks including warrior decks like the quest one get outshined because why not just play CW
---
Aggro is not meant to be kept in check, it is keeping greedy strategies in check and usually helps the game be more honest and healthy.
---
Horsemanship.
---
I used to hate rogue because for the longest time the only decks that would be played were either hyper-aggro/tempo or Miracle with little to know variation in-between.  
---
Now that there's more variety for the class, I don't really have a least favorite now.
---
Well done mate, great achievement. I've been trying for legendary the last few months, closest I got was R8 last expansion.
---
Currently running CC Mage and I'm on a good streak but working my way back down the high teens.
---
I think Reno Mage would be the next choice for me if I start to struggle.
---
If you can recall, what was your winrate like overall? And what match up was your most challenging?
---
amazing to find some big priest hate other than its subreddit and r/wildhearthstone. in fact was not complaining about boom because he's used idk, DMH/Odd Warrior, to be fair?

I used nox emulator too with Android 5.1. I guess the emulator should be fine cuz I've successfully purchased like 900 bucks worth packs. It was even working today and I spent half of the coins and this happened. I'm totally down with you, it's def an Amazon problem. Either their payment gateway didn't go through smoothly with Blizzard, or we triggered some internal system for authentication etc...
---
I feel you cuz this ruined my evening for the troubleshooting. It should have been a pleasing night with pack opening and some games. But don't let this sh\*t bother you too much. It's not worth it :) Good luck!
---
Can't dispute facts and logic
---

Yes, Reno Hunter. Where you require 30 separate cards.

You pick Wing Blast because you need removal and can only run one copy of Deadly Shot/Unleash the Beast.

Because [[Reno Jackson]] invented the archtype. Though some people called it Highlander later on, Reno is *the* face of those decks, though. Hence the name.
---
Mountain giant is a great classic card and it is part of HS identity. It is neutral and enables a lot of big hand strategy that otherwise would never see play (like the current aggro hand pally). 
---
Conjurer’s Calling seems fair at 4 mana.
---
Just a year ago that would be an amazing thing.

6/4/6 | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, fully heal your hero.  
---
Nothing beats the enjoyment of playing against CW while having Tess &amp; Toggwagle Scheme in your hand!
---
So I'm not the only one conceding after boom on 7, good to know.
---
Omg, yeah. 4/6 with taunt x2... it wouldn't even see play now. Heck, it would probably be printed as 4/8 now and still only see play sometimes.
---
Nice
---
How did u craft all tier 1 decks with 16k dust?
---
That means your collection already was insane
---
If you crazed alchemist, you’d be able to bust through the 2563 armor from BEEES!! Druid in wild. Hmmm...

Hello! I am trading my 80g quest on EU. I will show that I have it but YOU go 1st. :)

How do you scam people in HS?
---
Soo I don't really get this? You don't need to write up a full guide or something, but how do you reconcile an aggressive hat wastes turn one for a card that will weaken it's next 4 turns?
---
Oh dont you know? Your cthun buff cards buff mechathun (where ever he is).
---
Imagine how meaningless and shallow your life has to be to play Control Warrior or Mech Hunter in casual
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Duel is a two sided Recruit not a Joust.
---
Flanking, then?

Offtopic, but since you're very new:

---
So it wouldn't make a change.
---
I just do the last match before bed in casual. Tjat way you can just concede if it’s a warrior.
---
and you just know the sonofabitch is going to rope every turn
---
“Lok'tar ogar!”
---
can confirm, didn’t loose a SINGLE game (no joke) vs quest druid with my resurrect priest since release...but yesterday i lost vs aggro swarm quest druid first time
---

Secret paladin, (1.5k wins) that was the first deck I’ve hit legend with. I do like otk paladin a lot (500 wins) but for grinding this amount of wins I’ve mostly played odd paladin a lot last expansion (2k ish wins) and Murloc paladin variants. (3k wins) I’ve been constantly hitting top 1000 legend with paladin since October 2015.
---
Don't make me push buttons!
---
I don't concede until warrior has lethal on board. I want to waste most of their time as humanly possible
---
Never have I got a legendary in the last pack
---
&gt;So unless you are getting coins for sake of accumulating coins,  my comment stands.
---
Which some people do?  Some people like to stockpile gold up before an expansion comes out,  so no, coins and packs *are* two different things.
---
Well

Play daily quests, buy packs with gold, dust duplicates
---
See, this is why it's hard to take the whining here seriously. I think Dr. Boom needs to be tuned down a bit. I don't love playing against warrior. But rather than discuss it rationally, we have people like you suggesting that "only aggro and maybe mech paladin" have a real chance to beat them. Over half the decks in the meta have a neutral or favorable matchup against them. "Maybe" mech paladin? When no mech paladin should ever be losing to warrior without incredibly bad luck. And aggro is the worst thing to beat them unless it's super mech heavy like bomb hunter.
---
Yea, my advice might be biased because I've pumped that druid deck full with useful legendaries from all over the years but if you really stick to the choose one keyword cards, you'd ought to make his day a lot harder.
---
Another deck I found out does pretty well is 'no duplicate mage' but you'll have to craft a couple of legendaries (+-4/5) to make it truly work right but when it does...
---
I've played the 10 mana kazakus potion for 0, and  the turn after it I played pyroblast for 0, and IF (and thats a big if) that's not enough I've always got that new 'make a wish' card to fall back on.
---
Besides that, it's my most legendary heavy deck with 12 of em in it.
---
I think you get the idea.
---
Last legs?  Lololol
---
I hope you never discover Mortal Strike and Fireball.
---
Same. Good thing quest warlock actually has some survivability.
---
Also the surprise mechathun tech, just to piss warriors off.
---
Sad but true

Vendetta is a great card. It enables a fun archetype without ever really feeling unfair.
---
Wait it's rude to say "Well Played" first if you won?
---
Shizzzzz I gotta remove that habit of mine
---
Haha! I discovered it before you said that, Spotify Cheese Man!
---
Zephrys isn't very good at finding lethal... just yesterday my opponent was at 7 hp and i had a frozen King Krush on board. With 1 mana left(i tried to force it) he didn't give me Silence.
---
Imagine the surprise within opponents when Tinkmaster Overspark is being played.

Armor hitting sound
---
I've only been playing for like 9 months or so, I have a decent number of legendaries but the concept of running a deck with 12 gives me visions of people throwing wads of cash at their screen saying "win damnit".  It makes a lot more sense when you consider the players that have been gathering legendary cards for 4 or 5 years at this point
---
^^^”No tomb can hold me!”
---
Wow.
---
No, that had already been hot fixed at least 3 days ago, I didn't see it anymore in Dalaran Heist
---
I liked Arthur’s “hail and well met”
---
The worst part is extra greedy meme decks that are supposed to feed on control can't beat Big Priest because of how early it gets on the board. With stuff like Thief Priest, N'Zoth Rogue, Recruit Hunter, Bloodbloom Warlock, Buff Paladin, Cruel Dinomancer Warlock, Beast Druid etc. playing against Big Priest still feels like shit.
---
In the early days of HS, no matter how infuriating control decks got, I could always count on that 1) I could counter them by making my decks stupidly greedy and sacrificing my wr against aggro/midrange, and that 2) control would never be the thing to prevent me from enjoying meme decks. This whole balance is turned upside down when decks like Big Priest or Jade Druid out-value more conventional control, like meme decks tend to do, but then they also have tools to deal with other decks and take a place in the meta, suppressing other memes.
---
Quest Paladin my dude is the saviour against this foul creature
---
I also love healer and support classes, but I enjoy the Obelisk Priest far more than Control Warrior.
---
One is the feel that you are keeping and buffing your allies/minions, the other is just denying denying denying your oponent the whole time.
---
[It's also run quite a bit.](https://i.imgur.com/9hKNO9s.png)
---
Hope you report him
---
Omega=10
---
Yup, but ay any rate, my advice to you is make a fun deck and stop caring about winning so much and care more about messing his plays up.
---
When I just started and didn't have good enough cards to actually compete on the ladder I made it my mission to make sure that IF they were going to beat me, they'd have to use everything in their arsenal.
---
So yeah, just be an annoyance until you become dangerous.
---
I'd think reacting in any way to being emoted by a random stranger on the internet implies some immaturity itself...
---
Yes, its seriously awful. 
---
I've been putting all of my energy into making a T2 Rez priest deck since RoS. With the quest the deck works so much better and no longer suffers a total loss vs warrior. If you wanna help I'm posting on [Competitive HS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/cqouv8/ask_rcompetitivehs_thursday_august_15_2019/ewy2ixe/) for deck building.
---
Actually, I have no idea. There were alot of Azalinas and Elysianas involved. But I think from someones Omega Assembly!
---
How long can this go on?  ⛏️  ⛏️
---
Pay To Have Any Fun At All
---
This sub is getting pretty caustic. Merely asking a question for understanding and I get downvoted. It would be cool if people would just answer sincerely.
---
I started too and then as it happens all too often here you had to bring up some BS about "only happens at low ranks" crap which of course is just an underhanded insult.  So, yeah.... ya lost my attention with the Holier than thou attitude.  When a fairly large portion of people are instantly conceding to a class then LOGIC would dictate that something is wrong. Its that simple.  Rememember original Quest Rogue that was causing mass-instant-conceding?  Same problem.  Even back then you had the decks defenders parachuting into the forums trying to justify the decks ridiculousness or telling everyone to "git gud".  C'mon.
---
If you have 10 Mana crystals, every time a beast dies draw a card
---
the game is not and will never be pay to win. but it is pay to have fun.  
---
You can easily get a t1 deck as a f2p player but you have to put all your resources into it.
---
It's really not. The problem is how efficient the warrior removal is. You get the hero card almost every game because you're likely to stabilize the board, which you do with insane removal. They can git you for one turn, when you play the hero power (and even then sometimes you have shield bash to remove their biggest dude the same turn), and then it's back to emptying the board and playing dudes.
---
The hero power is nice, and it tends to be great over long games, but the real problem with the card is that it makes every mech into yet another insane answer, and every good mech into a back breaking play.
---
20% is garbage odds. Think of it like this: would you ever play a combo deck in any other class where you o nly had 20% chance of generating two pieces of the combo? The only possible way that deck has any kind of win rate is if it can defend itself insanely well - it's how malygos druid used to work. 
---
At that point any major threat works, because it's not the actual win condition. Controlling the board is. That's why Mechathun warrior works, it's not the janky win condition, it's the control shell.
---
Its a lot more fun to play against than aggro.
---
Read it, see windows only, at times like this I hate being a Mac user
---
How nice of you to care and reply on my thread. Thanks for reading my stuff. I appreciate your time.
---
Been playing for 2-3 years reached rank 9 twice and haven't spent a single cent I'd say there is no pay to win aspect you can get everything through playing the game even if you are a regular player like me...even those who pay to buy card packs don't necessarily have the knowledge to use the cards correctly

---
Devastator is definetely not ok. It kills every control deck in the game because it's so good. Even without rush the card is too good
---
This post is full on batshit insane nonsense.
---
Not at all! I barely keep up with my quests, sometimes forget a week, and usually i have around 4k gold saved up. Like definitelynotmhmt says, you'll get 1-3 cool decks out of it.
---
priest main here, never played DS+IF combo, I always play control value oriented decks. I returned to standard on SoU launch, currently playing Kripp's quest res deck with small change. Loses to control warrior, but beats all the other quests. Though there's no real win condition. you just hope to pump out more minions in late game than your opponent can deal with. It works preeetty goood.
---
Yes. And the other I mentioned? Tempo mage totally ran the spell damage dude. And the 2-damage and the Divine Shield one also got play. Not sure where one can find these kinda stats nowadays, but if ya don't know now you know.
---
This honestly wouldnd hurt mage that much. They just wouldnt play mountain giant, and if anyone dares to play one they would just 2x conj it and ping lethal you

The card would be pretty bad at 5. 8 would be ok? You need to look at this card as a dead card until turn 10 because you don't really want to play yeti in your deck. Even then, the problem is that it's a mech and a warrior class card at the same time
---
"Wow"
---
Raid Leader is so terrifying too
---
I hope they change the "if you have a &lt;tribe&gt;" to the new "if you control a &lt;tribe&gt;" with pirates and such. The first one is not intuitive and not specific. These three will stay the same, but in the future I think this kind of conditional card text will be more consistent
---
unoriginal fanbase
---
You tempo out devastator every time you don't have restless mummy actually
---
na ladder + wild ladder nyc job  bro that's the toughest combination u cud have found kappa
---
It's very very easy to beat control warrior with that deck. It folds to all the aggro face decks but it will make warriors cry.

---
I asked for links to decks with them. I don't recall the divine shield or deal 2 seeing any play outside of Cthun decks. Why would they have? The 4/2 divine shield was basically just the 3/3 divine shield we've always had and played 0 times.
---
Looking at the QQ here ppl aren't having fun even when they pay cause the balance is just crap
---
Both of my golden copies agree heartily.
---
Yeah, King's Elekk was the only one I would consider balanced, since it draws high cost cards by definition. And I'm sure one could come up with other balanced, fair cards like that, but virtually all others from that set were either useless or way too swingy.
---
Better be unlucky with 400 dust than 50.
---
Questpala.
---
Yeah it needs to die. So boring.
---
I have never payed any money and I got rank 8 last 3 seasons
---
And it has taunts sometimes, negating some combos
---
Ugh, sorry you're feeling the sting too.
---
'Account team' means no case ticket has been created for you. If they don't get back to you within their quoted time (48hrs?) I would specifically request a case ticket to be created.
---
Best of luck! Keep us in the loop.
---
Crazygolfer#1163 in NA looking to trade 80g quest.  You show, I will go first.
---
Make it 0 mana, so you can play on your first turn.
---
Because there is nothing unique about weapon -&gt; ooze answer. Similar arguments can be made "simply offer X against Y" (e.g. there was a post recently, where Zephrys missed lethal, because it didn't take into account voidlord's deathrattle - and silence would easily solve that problem). However, once you make 4 of those, they stop being compatible, so solution as simple as yours can't possibly work.
---
jokes on you, control warrior players don't value their time.
---
they really out here grinding brawliseum on sweatshop wage
---
Grats on the 815 dust!!
---
I'm absolutely on your side that even the shittiest mech gets turned into a decent one by the hero Card.
---
20% isn't garbage as long as you don't rely on it. It's no combo and not essential to winning your game since the other hero powers are also good. Boom doesn't need the drone. But he has it and in most games he gets it and it's a free minion, with rush, magnetic or at least magnetizeable, potentially a really good minion even.
---
As I said, I'm not talking about CW depending on that hero power. Every one of the hero powers is a nice to have kind of thing. And every now and then, a good to insane amount of value lands in your hand.
---
Yeah, it's a bit of arena also I believe. At first it was difficult letting that gold just sit there, but now it just feels good to see it grow by the day! Before when I used to play super regularly I spent a lot of money on packs, but by saving all my gold that hasn't been necessary which feels really good :)
---
4 damage is still enough to straight up kill a lot of minions and 1v1 most big minions with Boom's Rush. It'd still be a great Discover option
---
I hope so! Thanks for the help =)
---
So the first winner won't even get enough points to get a pack? Interesting
---
Tier 2? Really? When was this? I can hardly believe it. Do you mean during Rise of Shadows? In standard?
---
It's definitely true that Lord J has to be timed and can NEVER be slammed, but with Zephrys he has got another huge nerf. Seeing as how many control warlock cards see no play now, I would not mind having that deck back for a little while. It would really make the meta interesting as a 6/6 a turn isnt exactly gamebreaking, but does put a clock on your enemy.
---
One can always hope.
---
It's not that archmage and snip snap aren't good, it's more about the context. That was the first time they gave a legendary for free, the expansion was GREAT and C'Thun was just a cool card that was the CENTER-POINT of the decks he was in. You can put archmage in a deck but he doesn't carry your deck, and there is no "vargoth warlock" or whatever. For the other cards (you forgot about Marin which should tell you something), you need support cards which usually included a lot of legendaries. At least C'Thun support cards were mostly low rarity.
---
what tits, they took them away!
---
It's not 'pay to win'.
---
It's 'pay to get access to competitive decks faster'.  
---
Players that have access to all of the cards in the game don't immediately skyrocket to legend and obliterate everyone along the way.  Unless you are at very low ranks, everyone has *at least one*  decently competitive deck that is capable of reaching legend.  
---
----
---
Put another way - this isn't like other pay to win games where you have no hope of ever beating a whale.  The game is very well balanced assuming that everyone owns all of the cards.
---
Im playing since 2015 and havent gotten a double or a golden legendary from a pack so far :C
---
They're watching Netflix
---
ALL mages.
---
Hearthstone didn’t used to be like this. It’s why I liked it. Now it’s garbage. Too much power swing in a game that has expensive removal and also no way to counter on your opponents turn.
---
They can cache user information locally and aggregate the least picked asynchronously during updates and update the block of code in baches. 
---
You don't necessarily have to do it in real time, you can use collect the information and update the card during updates (exactly what they're doing now, but just collect user picks in a small local text file).
---
When you get to legend your first rank is decided by your mmr from the climb. There could be 5k legends at this point, his 930 just shows that he got there with respectable winrate.
---
Warrior= long fight
---
Yeah sadly this is what i need to start doing. The last time i played warrior the dude played like she and i almost had him and then *of course* they play their like 4th legend in the form of "discover a new deck" essentially and i was quite triggered.
---
As one that's traveling with a travel sim I was cool with the 10mb. The massive stealth download made me lose wood.
---
They should just make giants discounts a lingering affect. That way if you have 8 cards in hand and play conjuring on ur mountain giant, you’ll get 2 4 drops. Same goes with the other giants
---
Dr Boom in mulligan has a 70%... the deck doesn’t. Also Mage exists? Which control warrior does horrible against?  Ergo the original point of this excellently designed card? You kill the warrior before turn 7, just like every match of wild against every type of wild opponent when playing an aggro deck. Control warrior no longer runs Elysiana either so just tech that if you run a longer game deck and win that way. There’s ways of countering a deck that’s prevalent in the meta believe it or not
---
You can't conjure into non collectibles though
---
I do too, but I always give my opponent priority. 
---
Again, I'm finding that a majority of you weren't raised right. Narcissistic sociopaths...
---
I play quest rogue with tess and a togwaggle scheme. Let me assure I avenge you all whenever I meet a warrior.
---
The game takes forever so that warrior is busy. He has very little chance of tempoing me out because my dagger deals 3 dmg and well... He is control warrior.
---
I make sure to never pick a card that might randomly kill my tess. Then eventually I play tess, togwaggle a dozen or so into my deck. Each tess summons a board, and the boards keep coming. At first they try to fight back. Brawl. Warpath. Plage of whatever. But the boards keep coming. Again. And again. It never ends. And after a long and excruciating game where they try to juggle their answers and I just play tess over and over again while watching a YouTube video, the most wonderful sound one could imagine... "I give up! SELF-DESTRUCT!"
---
I think High Priest Amet may have proven to be the last hurrah for Divine Spirit/Inner Fire combos, so enjoy them in Standard while you can (if indeed you do still enjoy them).
---
I think it's fairly obvious when a card is "pushing the limits" of a mechanic about to be nerfed or removed from a format, and High Priest Amet definitely seems like one of those kinds of cards.
---
it was a fun meme deck lol
---
the problem is you want to finish 1 quest quickly then get the other online, but you can guarantee draw the second quest, and keeping it in the opening hand is too much dead weight.
---
the way the deck works "ideally" is you play quest 1 (the new one) cyclone mage a bunch of spells, use some to finish the first quest, draw and play the second one, play the rest of the spells from the cyclone combo, use your hero power to finish the quest, play arcane giants or antonidas combo or something, then skip turn and try to kill the opponent
---
but it just works worse then the normal quest mage :(
---
&gt; Seriously though, we're mostly blue white control players from MTG who are sad HS doesn't have instants,
---
what does this have to do with anything? white and blue decks *usually* have win cons as opposed to mono removal control warrior. So that being the case i would say control warrior is more like "blue/black control" since it *actually* uses mill (fatigue) as a win con  and is far less one sided.
---
Please keep track of it by filming the replay, then post it.
---
I'm sure you will get surprised by how it actually is less than 10% of the people the ones that do what you complain about.
---
Don't forget turn 1 has half the time of a normal turn, so making the rope appear is pretty common if you stop just to think of what deck your opponent may be playing for 10 seconds.
---
Did your Unseen Saboteur survive the brawl? I think the Battlecry recasts after the brawl is completed.
---
The biggest problem there is no one would be playing with the new skin since they're all boom
---
I'm a firm believer that if you rope the mulligan you should start on the immediate rope on turn 1.
---
So can KC, so that argument doesn’t matter in this context. We also don’t know if there is even a taunt on the board  here.
---
You mean that Dr. Boom, Mad Genius isn't the new Wariror skin? ^^/s
---
I feel like that's mostly mobile players who do other stuff all the time. Either wiping their butt or whatnot. But yeah it's sad how often it happens.
---
It costs 4
---
Oops, I guess you embarrassed yourself
---
Where are you seeing a 70% WR?  The best CW deck on HSReplay is only at 62%, which is high but it has peers around that.  The best Murloc Pally deck is at 60%, as is the best Secret Hunter and Murlock Shaman deck. 
---
It has its counters too, and more than just quest paladin.  Singleton and Secret hunter have positive winrates against it, as does Singleton and Control mage.  They don't dominate it like Quest Pally does, but they are still favoured as shown here: https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/2/control-warrior#tab=matchups
---
The Warlock version with hemet is interesting as I played 1x Godfrey 1x twisting nether and 1x OG Reno in addition to hemet to make my last 1-4 draws all really really good. Really helped when you just needed one more turn. 
---
Or also consider the OG quest and a bunch of deathrattles to have a reno effect vs aggro. Vs control just mull the quest away and power draw into hemet and play it the turn b4 you combo to ensure you dont activate it with mecha tun
---
2.1 billion is the max for a 32-bit signed integer.
---
Specifically, 2,147,483,647.
---
No, battlecries both resolve even if the minion dies (see explosive runes/potion of polymorph or snipe Vs battlecry minions)
---
Yeah, I miss Dragons.  Also Control.  Dragon Control Priest was my jam.  I main Rogue now, instead.
---
another one that can’t read...
---
Yup, that's the one, couldn't remember the exact number off the top of my head :p
---
Talk to Zetalot
---
&gt; I agree with everything you're saying, but I still have fun with control warrior.
---
yeah, it is scummy for the opponent not the player specifically unless you want a deck with more thought to it of course.
---
&gt;Maybe I just like playing Dr Boom and I'm simply enjoying a deck entirely constructed around the card.
---
Can you explain how this is suppose to justify it being broken? Like i loved baku when it came out but that doesn't change the fact it was unhealthy for the game at large so..
---
Yeah I am getting pretty annoyed with High Priest Amet. 4 mana 7 health and if it sticks turn 5 is absolutely insane for priest. I really enjoyed playing dragon priest and such back in the day, but I really hate playing and playing against inner fire priest.
---
great fucking meme :)
---
No. With an Elemental last turn and a Kalecgos this turn, it costs 1.
---
That's an interesting idea.
---
your netdecked mage deck won against a fun tier 50 druid deck ? no way dude.
---
What the fuck is happening in this thread
---
If Thaddius return to your hand, then yeah, but it's still a pretty good deathrattle reward on two cards with alright stats.
---
reminds me of when i used to play mta arena i had this mono removal blue black mill (fatigue) deck that was **mean** to play but wasn't that expensive to make and was my deck with the highest win rate.
---
You can't compare the two, since hunter is inherently aggressive and paladin is not.
---
Ok thanks
---
Some are trolls, others prolly didn't realize how fast they would have gotten into a game and are either distracted or away from their devices. Either way it truly is frustrating when you're trying to play and only have a bit of time to get a game in before having to do life things.
---
Nah, there are plenty of decks that kill control warrior, you just have to commit to losing 75% of your matchups vs aggro to do it. 
---
Actually, big shaman can end up exhausting a control warrior if you dont waste your good stuff, and can compete vs control as well, give it a shot.
---
*concede sound effect* I choose joy!
---
Hof boom,mountain giant,sea giant,hof galaxy
---
Twinspell. Twinspell. Twinspell. Twinspell. Twinspell.
---
Dr boom isnt the problem warrior was resident sleeper for years. Rigth now it was heltier then ever with them killing you with bombs. Alisiana is a bigger problem then boom becuse of how slow it is.
---
Why is this taking a spot on the front page? I mean, the moderators obviously love low-effort content to proliferate on this sub, so why take one spot from it?
---
&gt;I play control warrior whenever i'm playing hearthstone to have fun and I know i have a lot of time to kill.
---
well just so you know **you** are the only one having fun in that scenario soo
---
I can't read, sorry. I thought it said "DIDN'T play an elemental"
---
lmao
---
Meh, I always neglected standard. Not enough variables for my taste. If you play wild,  you can come across anything from any expansion and since I've been playing since Naxxramas, I've got quite the collection.
---
Maybe the ‘main priest’ community is not that creative?
---
After 5 years of playing still no Tirion for me, but you got yourself 2 very usefull Legendary’s. Congrats!
---
k
---
That's probably the luckiest [[Thoughsteal]] ever. Not just that you happened to also be playing Highlander but you happened to pull two very powerful and versatile cards you could have pulled.
---
But, does it check to see if you have a Highlander decklist at the start or do drawing them when they're in your deck stop all your Highlander cards from working?
---
This I the comment that reflects my attitude on the matter. It feels great when I make smart boards and the Warrior responds with either a Brawl and I have gas, or he plays smart with an even greedier brawl. Interactions like this make for a good match with the archetype in the past.
---
I feel like Warrior has so much in spades, it's not even counterplay, it's just drawing out the more favorable removal until I'M SUITIN UP decides to show up and ruin your late game strategy too. Sometimes they have so many mechs that they start turtlebashing my face when I'm looking for my Tess+scheme combo, and it feels ridiculous that I'M the one getting my life total burned down because apparently, Warrior can aggro fairly well too when you're trying to outvalue it.

3/-/- | Copy 2 cards in your opponent's deck and add them to your hand.

I haven't played the pokemon TCG in a little while (a year or so) but that card game seemed to do a decent job of letting both players play in most matchups
---
Divine spirit HoF potentially?
---
King Crush is what I was referring to.
---
This whole thread is about silencing King Crush so he can get through for lethal. Kill Command has nothing to do with this discussion.
---
Zephrys: "Your wish is my, OH DEAR GOD!"
---
Same, over 5K wins with priest and second class was over 600 wins because I enjoyed it so much even with tier 2 decks. I havent played priest in the last expansion and almost didn't played in the one before that because Priest is a one trick pony now.
---
Does Book draw 3 fatigues or does it work more like Crystology where it just does nothing?
---
"Still lost"
---
So another questing adventurer instead of 1 mummy? And what should i use in Undatakahs place?
---
Clear the board, armour up!
---
Want to see broken? 
---
https://youtu.be/DFfQtXAxt5k?t=424
---
So it's the same, in this one circumstance. 
---
That's not how rules should be written imo.
---
I always put it and Zoo as "Hearthstone the way it was intended" in my mind. I enjoyed playing both and never minded losing to either. At least if we are talking non-Keleseth Zoo and pre-Secret Agent Dragon Priest anyway. They are both two of my favorite decks of all time.
---
If you're aiming for rank 5 go with odd paladin, it's much cheaper and effective.
---
Not exactly, putting it in HoF wont make the other cards magically better. Priest needs an overhaul, most priest players I know hate combo, they wanted control mastery Priest and playe IFCombo because it's all we got.
---
Trust me I dust all my goldens and I already went through the useless commons/rares/epics. At this point I'm choosing which classes I don't want to play to dust cards from.
---
Yeah, they both honestly need HoFed at this point.
---
Wait how?
---
[deleted]
---
The card that should have gotten HoF instead of mind blast
---
Thanks for the response!
---
It's actually comical at this point. Ya know, in a really sad kind of way.....
---
im at rank 4, 3 stars. Since rank 5,0 star, I think I lost 4 games so far, against mage and hunter.
---
You don't need to play Elysiana. You only need 1 Seance (or 2 if you want to combo it with Catrina). When the Warrior play Ely, just copy and then SW:D it and you'd out value it 100%. I haven't lost to any Control Warrior this season that way. I don't want to include Ely just for that single matchup.
---
I have 2xMass res and 2x Plague. Warrior can clear all minions for all I care, I just play one minion per turn and buff it with hero power. Control warrior most of the time don't build any big board, so I don't know why Quest Priest can be outvalued by it.
---
Sounds like this card would be a perfect situation where a machine learning algorithm could come into play.  Store board states and which cards would improve win percentages, and continue to automatically refine over time.  Otherwise, especially when he drops into wild, it's going to be a pita to maintain. 
---
On the other hand, storing all board states and card plays with eventual win/loss conditions is a LOT of a data.  So you'd also want to find some way to refine that data down to it's bare bones, too.
---
&gt;odd paladin 
---
From deep down in my stomach, with every inch of me, I pure, straight hate you. But goddammit, do I respect 7000 wins.
---
I would really like to see priest having a way to win that isnt DS/IF or mind blasts  Dragon priest is really cool, but i feel draconoid operative and dragonfire potion ruined the concept for a lot of people. Rez priest isnt even bad flavor wise, but it just doesnt cut it in standard (ignoring wild, obviously)
---
I agree with this mostly. My only addition is that after about two years you'll have the gold, dust, and card base to do most of whatever you feel like while remaining F2P.
---
Ok see ya
---
That’s exactly the reason why I want them removed. Yes priests would probably suck, but through that maybe we actually get some alternative and new conditions.
---
Look at hunters, before they nerfed all the smorc cards, that was all they did, but look at them now, current hunter lists are mind boggling if a 2015 hunter player saw them. Through this we got cards like DK rexxar and all the value/secret decks. They were fun, competitive and most importantly gave hunter players something else than hitting face and winning by turn 6.
---
Wait but tempostorm said Cyclone Mage is the #1 deck in the game right now!
---
Oh wait that's right the tempostorm list is useless and has no basis on reality.
---
The top decks aren't very surprising to those who have been watching legend ladder.
---
Combo priest seems a bit too high though compared to other stats sites, so I wonder what accounts for the discrepancy
---
I believe he is a shaman and has the quest activated, so 2 + 7 = 9 for double battlecry brann
---
A lot of new players to the deck will only aim for the OTK whereas a 5/5 northshire on turn 2 can win you the game anyway. I've only used the OTK a handful of times against warriors.
---
So here is the best thing you can do to gain resources.  Download heartharena and play arena like crazy. Heartharena will help you craft a really good deck and tell you which cards you want. If you get 6 wins its usually almost enough in the prize pool to get another arena ticket. Throw synergy out the window cause these cards are all about value baby.mana curve and value are the bread and butter of arena. At the end even for 0 wina you are guaranteed a pack and 1 small resource. Heartharena is only for PC right now but you can still look up the buckets online and it will tell you which cards are doing well and which aren't. It will feel slow but it is a fantastic way to do it
---
&gt;You need at least 5 or 6 different competitive decks not to get bored.
---
...Source? The vast majority of players don’t have 6 competitive decks.
---
Which never made much sense to me because control decks usually have the most tools to disrupt anything that isn't 30 damage from hand. It's the midrange and low rolling aggro decks that always get smashed by combo
---
Then they nerf or HoF a classic/basic card and you’re the first one to complain about “the rising cost of hearthstone” and how this “forces you to buy packs to keep up”. They can never win
---
I don't have a problem with greetings. I think that's the only really mannerly emote.
---
How is the otk?
---
vS has Bomb Warrior at T1, too, they just put it as an asterisk at the bottom, noting that it's T1, but most people are playing Control instead because it's T1-er.
---
It's also a bit odd that "Bronze to GM!" runs are vilified in Overwatch, but the community seems fine with alt-account "50 to Legend!" runs in Hearthstone.
---
It's cool guys, they made it a rogue card.
---
yea, I played prep first. didnt realize it wouldnt know about active prep. feels like it should?
---
No. If Zephrys doesn't know silence gives lethal, it won't give it at 0 mana either. It would instead offer Pyroblast, gorehowl and Tirion for next turn.
---
The person who made the “honest” cards post had a good one for the warlock quest. “Quest: You wanted to see if you could. Reward: but you  forgot to ask yourself if you should.”
---
Divine Spirit seems like a prime candidate for HOF. What's telling is that they haven't printed more cards with similar effects, unlike with Inner Fire. So in that sense it's like Ice Block.
---
I don't think it's a huge problem card, but it doesn't feel like the kind of card that should be in standard forever.
---
even an old non priest main player is tired of that combo
---
You say that like this is actually a problem.
---
Why would that stop you from playing it, are you a hipster?
---
yes
---
Fantastic work. As a mobile-only peasant this makes me jealous.
---
[Mean streets](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-40/#Hunter)
---
30 spells but he casted box of yogg wich is another 10 spells
---
&gt; can be very destructive for the meta.
---
What. Interesting combos are what the meta needs.
---
&gt;Present-tense vs Future tense, the thing I already explained. 
---
and both are irrational, opinionated instead of being practical. As I said.
---
Do I really have to clarify that, dude?
---
Only he uses his own criteria because no one else cares to do so. Just like TS. 
---
&gt;It's a prediction, it's allowed to be wrong you numpty.
---
ofc it is allowed to be wrong. Everyone makes prediction. Making bolder statement than everyone else and being wronger than everyone else is called a joke, which is exactly what he has been.
---
He always tells you to SMOrc and then calls your misplays and missed lethals after they happen.
---
Best way is to test it out. Build the deck with as many cards as you can. Obviously the spell belongs it in, but with the legendaries just see if you have to use it or if you can find a replacement that works for you. Like Leeroy or whatever fits the deckstyle.
---
No one cared until he put on the mask.
---
It was also really bad for most of Frozen Thrown; as well as tier 3 at best after week 2 or 3 of both launches of Kobolds and Witchwood until they fixed Rexxar
---
Tempo storm is never ever correct lol
---
Mid-range is curve stone but you prefer aggro? What? 
---
Aggro is literally just playing the cards in hand as fast as possible and going face. It's the most mindless version of hearthstone there is
---
They mentioned that it's 3x of Mummy + Commander because you want to pull a 4 drop rush to curve out.
---
Zephrys is really good in the deck, Finley is replacable.
---
Honestly? No. I know a lot of people are but I still love that feeling of “oh shit, I have lethal” that DS/IF gives. I’d like for there to be other ways priest can combo outside it though, I miss Machinegun Anduin
---
You just use the Holy wrath OTK draw engine. 
---
Crystology, novice, loot horder, flash of light, salhets pride, acolytes. You will go through your deck super fast.
---
Deathrattles always trigger before reborn, regardless of play order.
---
Yes - that makes sense.  People would argue that Luna is also quite broken too though!
---
&gt; and both are irrational, 
---
Yes, prediction videos are irrational. Sure.
---
Conversation over, cheers mate.
---
Yes. Been playing Reno Mage for three years now, was the first viable deck I was able to craft and I'm delighted that it has been brought back.
---
Cry me a river, bitch.
---
Buy my beard!
---
The failure is the mindset that quests shouldn't be a self-contained win condition. Their isn't a point to playing a quest and having most of your deck be geared towards completing and using it if the reward doesn't massively boost your win rate. Most quest rewards are cute but the overall loss in tempo/value for the 4-8 turns they spent building it up aren't made up for by it.
---
I think it's because of all the possible ways in the future Mind Blast and Velen could be used together in some way. But of those two cards, Velen is much more interesting, whereas Mind Blast is uninteractive, and heavily limits priest design choices.
---
Opponent has a weapon that's why.
---
Should say "When the board (and opponent's weapon) is empty"
---
It's simple
---
With whom? The government?
---
You’re forgetting the part where Dr OP looked at at least a tenth of your opponents deck. That was pretty powerful information wise, knowing what they’re playing and knowing what they don’t have in their hand.
---
Why bother with the Faceless, isn't it easier to just use the quest hero power?
---
Bingo ;)
---
Millhouse is a 3 mana giant
---
I love how Arcane Shot and Holy Smite are the same card. Meanwhile frostbolt is just better/evergreen darkbomb.
---
r/HSpulls
---
Data can be deceptive is all I'm saying. Conjurer's mage had a sub 50% winrate across all ranks for most of Rise of Shadows despite it being considered one of the best decks in the game in the hands of experienced players. I think this is a similar situation. Also Zetalot the author of the list cracked top 50 legend today with it. It's good if you know how to use it.
---
just wait till aggro warr gets more popular lul

HoF’ing divine/inner fire would be even dumber, imho, because they need set support to be good. Without a tutor like visions in standard, the combo is pretty trash. Yes, it can happen early, but any deck can draw ridiculously; the likelihood of drawing double divine spirit *and* one of two copies of inner fire by turn 5 is incredibly low. There’s a reason the decks perform poorly rn.
---
Yeah, a long time ago there were control warrior lists that ran Reno along with a bunch of key duplicates since they could stall long enough to draw them out. It wasn’t very popular, but it did work.
---
Despite the fact that the whole issue with both is their condition being way less reliable than vendetta's.
---
Idk I loved raza priest and didn’t think it deserved the treatment it got, but Dr Op was really unfun to play against. Losing to a combo is one thing, losing to your own cards is another, especially when the priest lost no tempo doing so and can generate many more Dr Ops.

LordEthano #1509 US 80g swap
---
i would run thoughtsteal even if i werent playing highlander, i probably shouldnt but i would.
---
I played against a duel paladin who managed to drop one on turn 4 with lens. I didn’t know the reborn had a divine shield so I attempted to clear it, saw that it came back with a shield and there goes my entire hand.
---
Umm...no? Zephrys is meant to offer the perfect card for the situation played. It’s not random.
---
More like 5 decks I want to play but only enough cards to play 1 in my case. 😂
---
Probably Odd Paladin.  It depended on the meta, there was a while where the two best decks were Odd Warrior and Quest Rogue too.  Deathrattle Hunter.  It varied, but these decks were the best because they either beat Druid or beat the decks that beat Druid.
---
Zacusca#21211 NA, i'll show you go first
---
Not to mention the inevitable complaints of people having dusted a card just a week before it got a discount. This would be a regular source of complaints.
---
Good point my dude! :)
---
So, making a whole mechanic with a keyword specifically to counter 1.5 class? 
---
Sounds like a bad design, it's like making keyword cards for totem destruction.
---
Ahhh ok. I guess I didn't catch that. &gt;.&lt;
---
Nein Nein Nein!
---
But if you're playing the quest you've already won by turn 8.
---
Of course you shouldnt play zephyrs before it procs his ability. But since zephyrs has to have a certain setup to get sorc apprentice, its useful to to play him as soon as you can manage the setup. Having a duplicate card blocks you from getting her until you've drawn one bells. Waiting even one turn makes a big difference in a lot of games. I don't think its worth the wait when the current setup seems to work fine. Won't know for sure until we test it tho.
---
TLDW:  Play Quest Paladin
---
In a galaxy far far away
---
Yeah I could see Divine Spirit being a card to be nerfed if the future (to like 4 mana) or hall of fame Inner Fire.
---
Quest Mage? Really? I feel like I beat it most times I play it.
---
"Corrosive Crab"
---
It would be no different than having Acidic Ooze and Harrison Jones be a thing despite there being no weapons in Standard anymore for Warlock, Mage, or Priests... Or EMP Operative being a thing despite only certain classes heavily using Mechs...
---
EDIT - or the Murloc Crab being a thing despite only two classes using Murlocs, or the Pirate Crab being a thing despite 1 class using Pirates currently
---
I mean, not really. Mind blast off of Zeph would only be offered if it was lethal, so it only saves you being one off with soulfire. It’s not like you can use it to kill a taunt minion or something.
---
Doung the lords work.  To hell with warriors
---
Blingtron also makes golden things
---
I seriously haven't seen anyone play jaraxxus in years.
---
To be fair, Zephrys is still pretty new right now, so people are still having a lot of fun with highlander decks. I believe that he's a very strong card, but I expect his play rate to still substantially decrease over time.
---
Oh really?how can a universal swiss army knife card that can always give you the perfect answer be bad for the game? /s
---
If you have an old switch, is warranty really an issue anymore? Lol it's been like 2 years since I got my switch, no warranty for me anymore
---
I stopped pre ordering 5 or 6 expansions ago
---
Facepalm for the 6 retards who downvoted this
---
Rogue probably won't. The issue with the quest became clear, either you make your deck very weak to reliably get the quest online early and lose because the reward can't carry a bad deck, or you play it in a strong tempo shell and it won't be completed til it doesn't matter. Rogue isn't quite warrior level of bad, but I'd say priest and paladin quest have much better chances of becoming good.
---
I already removed it. someone else already pointed that out.
---
I mean obviously that isn’t relevant is it? Thank you for confirming things not within warranty aren’t covered by warranty 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
So once this is out of beta in china, what are the chances of it being migrated over to implement in the US?
---
I understand that Netease developed it separately, but I imagine they would be willing to cut a deal with Blizzard to expand it out of china. Doesn't really make any sense not to. 
---
That's if it wasn't already partly funded by blizzard, and they just didn't want to unveil it first in the western servers because the fans have been so rabid about tournament mode that an imperfect beta implementation would make fans go berserk.
---
Did you bother reading anything I said?
---
Jaraxxus is not playable, we know that.
---
Jaraxxus was not playable last expansion, we know that.
---
Jaraxxus is not playable if the interaction is removed, we know that.
---
But Jaraxxus is, was and should always be a fun card to meme with. You know, make a deck that has sub 40% winrate, but includes cool rarely used cards? Something that will never be seen in a VS report?
---
Zephrys with his high usage rate drops that sub 40% closer to 5%, and that's not fun anymore. Why is a cool card ruined even further?
---
May Guthix have mercy upon your soul.
---
Luna’s is bad enough and that just hits minions. I don’t even want to think about Plot Twist with that passive.
---
That's not far off the truth. There have been plenty of cards that didn't see serious play until certain archetypes came around, like Vanish, Holy Wrath, Moonfire, most Paladin secrets, and others. But speaking specifically to Jaraxxus, it's not a hypothetical thing. We *know* that in the right control meta he is extremely strong. So we know for a fact that the card has a home, and that home is heavy Control, so the only thing stopping Jaraxxus from being played is support for a heavy control deck.   
---
   
---
Here's another way to put it. We can all agree that Zuljin is a good card, a powerful card, right? What if I told you that during the TGT days, *nobody would have played him*. It was the heyday of post-undertaker smorc Hunter, and 10 mana was just too slow. Does it feel right saying that Zuljin is a bad card, even if we're talking about one particular point in time? Of course not. Same with Jaraxxus.
---
Unfortunately this is not a 10 minute game anymore.  Particularly for ranked, queuing up is a 45 minute commitment.
---
Also the cost to build competitive decks is massive, possibly excluding hunter.
---
I got back into it because a friend got me to, and now I have enough decks that it’s interesting to play a bit and follow the meta, but I don’t have time for how long matches can take now.
---
Given that you aren’t invested now, I strongly discourage getting back in.
---
Hope this helps,
---
NICE!
---
They rise at Legend, but Priest is still lowest in general and 2nd lowest overall.
---
With the recent rise of post-expansion criticism, I was surprised I didn't see this sooner. Then I realized that hardly anyone is playing priest to begin with because the class is a jumbled mess.
---
Seems this mindset is particularly strong in the US. I think, to a degree, that's also why they have such a hard time with free health care, taxes or stronger gun control. Everyone for himself.
---
Was that also when Deathstalker got a big shot in the arm by having its beast pool expanded?
---
How long until someone pulls off the Test Subject Boar OTK in standard again, then? Lmao
---
Finally my burgled shield block will be put to work
---
Im not only tired of playing it but Im tired of playing against it too.  If you leave even ONE minion alive after like turn 4/5.... that minion becomes a 35/35 or whatever and you're done.  I miss decks ike Dragon priest where the deck played out more "normally" and was minion based instead of some gimmicky combo or other shlock.
---
So, yeah - Im sick of it in every way possible.
---
If a tech card doesn't gain you a massive advantage vs the deck your teching against, whats the point?
---
Then you're just making your deck weaker vs everything else.
---
Heh, greetings
---
There is official budget category on hearthpwn which is 1600 dust. Otherwise you will not be listed as budget deck. I would say you can max strech it to 3200 dust which would be budget deck containing 1 important legendary.
---
How long would you estimate your average game took over these 7000 games?
---
lemme. know when they revive dragon priest
---
blizzard we are introducing the tournament mode (JUPIIIII !!) half a year later, unfortunately the tournament mode is not good (MEHH) the year passes the tournament mode exclusively in china (..................... .... curses ............................................. ..................................)
---
ok not everyone likes the tournament mode but Blizzard has not introduced anything new for 5 years (new cards get bored after 2 weeks)
---
I like firebat but the way he snorts when he laughs made me stop watchingbhis content :( too gross
---
just play mind bla... oh wait
---
At least it’s not an odd card
---
what the op doesn't show was he was running quest pali and it was over turn 7 when the warrior surrendered.
---
Lucentbark is really cool but not very good I think.
---
cool, toxic negativity can only go one way apparently
---
HA. Wait until they discover Elysiana, FROM AN ELYSIANA. Had that happened THREE TIMES yesterday.
---
There's no risk of ban as this is booted before ever entering Horizon OS.
---
I thought everyone hated dragon priest.
---
Absolutely. Value-wise he is one of the most powerful cards in the game; he has an immediate impact on the board, forces trades that will usually be beneficial to you, and on top of all that gives you a 5/3 weapon that is basically free when you consider everything else.   
---
Right this moment, nobody plays him because the main archetypes that Paladin supports need that space for mechs and deathrattles that stack better. That doesn't make Tirion a bad card, and we've got a long history of evidence to back this up. He just doesn't fit in current builds, but he's a great card.
---
That's great insight, I never knew that.  
---
But with that being said, would you agree that under 8k dust for a "meta" deck is at least fringe-budget?
---
Yea i had it working as well. Only problem is how finicky the touchscreen is but it's only first release. It's bound to get better with time. But yea it works surprisingly well.
---
Well, Rogues used to have shields.
---
depends on the implementation. I favour an entire custom game mode with adjustable rule sets (starting health, deck size, pauper, tournament formats, banning cards/sets, etc etc). Which is much more than just a 'tournament mode'. But a bare bones implementation is probably more realistic
---
STFU Quest Druid :)
---
Eh my bad mustve had the thread still open from earlier
---
Can’t fit more than that in 24 hours anyway
---
It says "a lot" to people who have done any basic coding that's for sure.
---
Secrets are bad in general, be it in wild or standard.
---
turns out swapping one strong card out of the highest winrate list for another strong card gives you a list with roughly the same winrate. who would have thunk it.
---
Uh, what? This is the single dumbest thing I've ever heard. How am I spending money in Overwatch to have an edge?
---
I’m not surprised your entire comment history is just straight up whining 24/7 about warrior
---
I don't see it as a loss based off queue, as much as Pally being built to exploit the weaknesses of control warrior. It's also just good against a lot of other decks, so it isn't like Pally is just warrior farming.
---
That’s because data collection takes time. Hsreplay is less reliable, but the data is updated in real time, and quest wall is listed as t2
---
That would be the best time, but there will still be 4 sets in play (3 from last year and the new one). Plus they’d have to match the theme of the last sets. It wouldn’t be easy unless they started planning the cards alongside 3 sets and released them all with the 4th.
---
High legend is mostly aggro right now but zomg warrior is still oppressive right reddit?
---
Sure sure but I still hate rock paper scissor metas which it feels a little bit like it’s going that way
---
you have obviously never played against big priest before if u think highlander decks are BS.
---
Thing is, the interaction is a gimmick. It’s inconsistent with the game mechanics. Contrary to popular belief Jaraxxus as your hero is not, in fact, a minion, try targeting him with Meteor or Wrath. He’s a hero, and you can’t target Morgl with Hungry Crab or Sir Annoy-O with EMP Operative.
---
The interaction is an easter egg from a different time and right now, this easter egg is making the card *significantly* worse. It’s negatively impacting the game that’s why I think it should be removed.
---
Looks like Black Friday sales are up.
---
Maybe that's what they have planned that they can't tell us.  Would explain why they haven't come out with anything else, cause it would take a lot of time and resources.
---
Errm, most of them complain because playing against CW is FUCKING BORING (removal, removal, more removal, discovered removal, no cards? no problem, 10 more turns for the CW without fatigue damage please!) and not because it's the best deck.
---
If they had spoiled Zephrys before the Explorers, my opinion on highlander would have been completely flipped.  Obviously, yes, once you build a Highlander deck then Reno will be one of the best cards in it.  But Zephrys is the reason why you would want to build the deck in the first place.  It's a card that is your best play on every single turn of the game, that is an absurdly strong card.
---
I still wish the Explorers were more interesting.  Kathrena Winterwisp was 8 mana summon a King Krush + a body, but that card really made me excited to play the decks it went in.  My favorite highlander card in SoU is really Vulpera Scoundrel.
---
You are one of the few that is actually averaging the mythical 100 dust per pack lol
---
Could be. Also I just realized they’d have to add more cards to the basic/classic sets. I don’t see it happening. It rolls be like adding a 6th mana color to Magic.
---
Tirion was a must include for every Paladin deck until Murloc Paladin became a thing and Shirvallah pretty much. It's still not even a bad card it's just theres so many cards you need in the typical decks they run now. If anyone plays control Paladin hes still a must have I'd guess
---
If you want card draw, why don't you play Tracking?
---
I have not heard that until now, and now this is the only name I will use for it
---
And here I thought one legendary in 25 packs was lucky...
---
I mean... Sure, you can indulge yourself in the intricacies of discursive argumentation here and there. But then again, on Reddit most often than not the most simplest, satisfactory resolution is to school a bitch. n_n
---
The world will be really bored, and then everyone will kill themselves of boredom.
---
It's amazing how much these conversations change with data
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-137/
---
No, you are wrong.
---
Lol then you’re a bigger idiot than I thought.  At that point start growing.  It’s easy and far cheaper.  For someone who’s all about “value” you’re throwing away $2k a month on what I’m sure is absolute trash or WAY overpriced since $2k at anywhere near wholesale prices can get you a couple ounces of OIL, let alone weed.  Keep lying my friend.
---
I missed the old control style priest which is why I made a highlander quest priest that includes things like cabal. However I miss being able to run auchenai but it creates a big problem when trying to play any healing and is pretty dead if you complete the quest. Overall I have been happy with it specially since there are a lot of low hp big health minions (those poor paladins and their dino eggs)
---
Potentially , 38 was enough for this game
---
Okay but I like hearing the "UNITY. PRECISION. PERFECTION."
---
I main priest and I never played that combo. It's just stupid. I hate OTK decks in general and think those people should just go play solitaire if they want to just play games by themselves and not have any interaction in the game.
---
It's gonna be really hard to make a card prediction video without including any opinions in it.
---
You could still buy a PC.
---
Might just be that there aren't enough minions that run into it enough and it doesn't have enough synergy.
---
I watched the video, it really seemed like he was opting for nerfing warriors 1-drops. When warrior doesn't have good 1 drops, aggro has such a different game plan.
---
Town Cryer = 1/1
---
Eternium Rover = 1/2 
---
??
---
That's more an issue with Pocket Galaxy than with Quest Paladin
---
Just buy a pc as a college student to play hearthstone looool
---
Huh, I do have an older switch and an extra microSD card.
