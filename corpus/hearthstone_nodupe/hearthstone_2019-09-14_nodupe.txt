Noggenfogger's rules are weird, targeted spells won't hit elusive (e.g. Faerie Dragon) minions but stealthed minions are fair game and so is face in case of Icehowl and Fool's Bane. Hero/minion attacks will never be redirected to friendlies however and neither will spells that specify enemy characters.

Because when has this EXACT decklist been posted on Vicious Syndicate? When has anyone hit top 100 legend with this EXACT list before me? Never. Wanna know why? Because they didn‚Äôt have my list. This is my list not only because my name is literally on it right there, but also because I‚Äôm the one who not only created this exact list, I‚Äôm the first one to take it to top 100 legend. Then after I gave my list to my friend Carnation he took it to top 25 legend right after. And if you think Leeroy and Siamat are bad cards than you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. They have 2 of the highest winrates in standard.  Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt say shit when firebat or dog make a deck and call it theirs after only changing 4 cards. So why do I need to replace 15? Or 30? Or what ever amount would satisfy you salty fucks lmao. I‚Äôm done replying to you, keep using my list tho
---
OK, so, you know about hero cards? The "original 9" Were Death Knight versions of the main heroes. 
---
The Paladin one, Uther of the Ebon Blade, has a hero power that summons a unique 2/2 "horseman". If you summon all "four horseman", you win the game straight-up, Mecha'thun-style.

This was the first "true exodia"-style card introduced.

Sweet thanks
---
Yeah, still hate the original Reno. all highlander vs aggro games in that meta revolved around drawing reno or not. the entire rest of the match, mulligan, etc didn't actually matter.
---
The quote you posted is when OP was already on a salt binge, originally OP was just happy that VS put 'FU4FREE' on the meta report.  Which I can understand, I made a guide for a value/control hunter deck last expansion and it was pretty gratifying to see it pop up on hsreplay after I made the guide.
---
I like RDU :(
---
Thijs plays a lot of meme decks and he‚Äôs fun to watch
---
This is amazing

Download the in-game asset. It is a temporary visual bug,finish the dl and restart hs.

You're a fucking moron. I bet you failed your community college Algebra 2 course.

When I saw the "No wishing for more wishes" I knew that there's no way that can be true in wild format.
---
Check out Chump Hearthstone. He is well known for making videos on unusual but interesting decks that are not part of the meta.
---
Chump (not Trump) still plays meme decks, though he doesn't post quite a many videos as he did back in the day.
---
What date was that stream?
---
I went through the vod in it's entirety and he went through all the classes except hunter.
---
There was a mech version of alextrasza on custom hearthstone that did this.
---
A picture of a computer screen instead of a screenshot DOES feel bad.
---
I just can't get past the punchable face.
---
Probably will recommned mech hunter but im not positive
---
And yet they printed a card that will always give Sacrificial Pact against Jaraxxus. 
---
Maybe it won't happen with Thekal in standard, but it's possible for such a card to eventually make it into the game.
---
This brawl gives out 1 classic pack and 2 Saviours of Uldum pack? Did you not get one?
---
That‚Äôs great man! I‚Äôve beaten Reno decks quite a few times on my way up, but it definitely is unfavored. The life tap hero power makes that matchup a lot more winnable tho lol. Hope it continues to work for you! Lmk if you have any questions
---
It must be Blizzard's agents infiltrating Reddit in order to discredit him!  The conspiracy goes even deeper than we thought!
---
Cuz you‚Äôre gay
---
How do you capitalize on mechathun if the player doesnt use their golem proc till the very end? At that point the only card left in my deck is the jade golem card so i couldnt get rid of it if i wanted to, thus making mechathun obsolete

It's a pizza made to look like the pizza inspired cardback in Hearthstone

Oh shit man I should've listened to you! I just lost 492 games in a row and now I'm at the bottom of rank 83! Guess I'd better buy more packs in the hopes of opening my free win ticket!

It's actually less common in wild nowadays than it was in the past (I hovering around rank 5 right now for reference). Most paladins are playing the handbuff mech variant in my experience.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs still extreme trash tier. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs just from Hunter‚Äôs Pack.

---
This is what the internet is for.  12/10 would eat again.
---
Part of the reason for that is how little impact Boomsday and Rumble had on the meta. Neither expansion changed the game significantly until the Odd/Even decks were Hall-of-Famed.
---
TBH having Zeph offer good/risky options means you are in a good spot. I mean, it IS the reward for going highlander, it is going to be a great card regardless, but you can often force it to be "good, but not 'going highlander' good".
---
Yeah I more meant standard before the HoF, no one cared about new n fancy - it was all about the odd pally.
---
I dont disagree with you
---
1. You're not going to find a card game where net decking does not exist.
---
2. If you never liked the solo content, you can just avoid it since they are now **completely** optional.
---
3. Highlander is a historically expensive archetype, and most decks right now can cut at least one of the legendary cards in them (Nomi and Finley in Murloc Paladin for just one example). Combine that with the release of Quests and it ends up making it seem like the format is more expensive that it can be. Budget oriented (four to six thousand dust) decks like Murloc Shaman, Token Druid, Zoo Warlock, and even Quest Shaman can and are doing well on ladder.
---
4. The power level of this format is still much less than that of KotFT, K&amp;C, or RR format. Granted, decks that determined the outcome of a game really early into it have been present since at least TGT Face Hunter.
---
   1. Granted, I'd argue a more dynamic game that can shift with just one lucky top deck is ultimately more interesting for a casual audience than long, tiring grind games.
---
5. All card games are inherently random. It's just that Hearthstone wears its randomness on its sleeve. In MtG, around three in ten games can be considered non-games due to mana screw or mana flood. The Yugioh TCG is a game so drenched in statistics, it's possible to calculate just how likely your deck is to "brick" with the opening hand.
---
   1. Would you rather randomness be used to change-up how decks play out in game or to determine whether you can even play in the first place?
---
   2. Also, you should look into confirmation bias.
---
6. As far as I can remember, that was a one-time special event, not a regular occurrence.
---
Amazing.
---
Wild must be nuts with all those years of sets, even harder than standard legend I feel. Congrats :)
---
Its not a joke. Singleton rogue would be able to Shuffle Zephrys into their deck and have multiple zephrys active whenever they‚Äôre drawn if it became a start of game effect
---
&gt;Int8, Int16, Int32, Single (corresponding to the primitive type float), Double...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Java has a Number interface, which is implemented by Integer, Float, Double, etc.  You still need to know 
---
US will get free boosters. EU will get what they deserve ;-)

It's legit. I've played 3 games @$6, won all 3. Only problem is matchmaking. I wait around 30 mins for a game in que. When more people are playing, itll be awesome

---
You know what is next, don't you?
---
Re-install windows.
---
Thanks for that interesting bit of trivia. I knew that you spells that specify enemy or friendly minions will keep that targeting, but I didn't know the rest.
---
They will soon release a new game called Hearthstone Mobile - kinda like Candy Crush. We can play that.
---
lol are you just figuring out that card games are not for you? i thought u wrote ive been playing for really long. anywho OP im sad to ssy but your long winding post is just one long rant without a single valid point its like you picked up the game for the first and had no idea how CCG work. anyway good luck in the future hopefully next game you find to play you can figure out early whether you like it or not.
---
Are you saying that giving your opponent's minion 1 more attack is worse than a 5/6 minion? Unless that gives them lethal that's just not true, and even then you're probably gonna lose the game anyway.
---
I too hate the moment when I doesn't have enough mama to summon him.
---
I think I heard somewhere the design idea is they want people who have never seen the card before to build a deck around it and be surprised at the reward
---
Ain't familiar with him but I will give it a try
---
7 5/5 Choose one: Transform into a 3/7 poisonous snake that has lifesteal or a 7/8 with elusive. Should give druid some control tool after lossing the infamous naturalize.
---

---
im close...only thing missing is druid and rogue on chapter 5 but it gets more and more frustrating every time i play since its just pure RNG and got nothing to do with skill for the final 4 bosses.
---
just did druid run ... robes and expedite so pretty much able to drop almost everything in my deck on turn 3/4. 
---
up to khadgar i steamroll everything. then just bad starting hand with 3 spells(out of a total of 5 in my whole deck, go figure), i manage to recover somewhat but by that time he had 3 elementals and wipes 3 lich kings off the board ... fuck that bullshit ... i aint spending more money on single player shit if thats how they think fun gameplay should look like...dont even get me started on heroic ...
---
It's 2 more attack, which is obviously way worse /s
---
Sorry if my comment felt like personal. As you mentioned, I have been playing for long time, but you are wrong to think that these realizations have just occurred in a moment. I never mentioned this my post. I have been commenting from time to time in other people's posts regarding the same issue. Today I just wanted to do something about it as concisely as possible for me. Well from your comment "your post is very long and completely pointless ", it seems like you are troubled with me because of the length of the post rather content (or I don't think you understood what I meant to speak about). Well it doesn't matter, truth hurts, so I am not gonna say anything else.
---
technically it summons 4 5/5 Wyverns &amp; adds the non-twinspell version of those cards to your hand, which each summon another 5/5 Wyvern with rush.
---
It is on eu or NA?
---
At least he can actually recognize deathrattle (since he tends to give hex on deathrattle minion)

---
THAT'S NOT A PIZZA!
---
What is the joke? Am I just blind haha?
---
It's a mid-tier two deck. And if you think essentially starting with one less mana isn't a real disadvantage, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
It's literally highest winrate quest
---
Pumbledore#2667 is trading 80g quest on EU. You go first.
---
Maloneypony#1489 NA, quest trade
---
Thanks! Even when I shit post, I try and at least make it a little less shitty.
---
In standard it REALLY is the meta for highlander hunter.
---
In wild, its been a long time since a reno deck was tier 1.
---
I'm 3/5 wings on Heroic. Not doing all hero powers, only all heroes. Some hero powers are so bad it hurts. Good job and congrats!
---
You need to get them to 6 HP or less first, before you get offered the fireball. Make your attacks, and spend cards to get your mana low enough to restrict the choices he'll present.
---
You know I really like Desert Lance, at worst it‚Äôs a guaranteed removal of at least one enemy minion if you use its battlecry, but since it says minion and not just enemy minion you can buff some of your weaker minions to be a 3/3 which has some uses (popping eggs being the most obvious example). The 4 mana cost is a bit iffy but I think the battlecry‚Äôs options make it interesting enough to make it passable.
---
Eventually this piece of shit will get my rank 1 on eu üòì

Using emotes is not BM, and even less when you basically only used one.
---
Its their fault for getting tilted at a simple "wow". And even if they were right and you were a BM-er, that doesnt give them the right to call you a faggot.
---
So basically that guy was a jerk and had to insult you for feeling bad after loosing.
---
Nice
---
If only there was a card "Summon all 4 Basic Totems"
---
OP is the type of person that comes here to complain about the game being stale. Or QQ when Druid gets nerfed.
---
It also can lead to awful starting hands if you draw both
---
Eh, hardly. The amount of consistency you get from thinning your deck by 1 card is about 1%. It will matter once in 100 games. Its barely better in that regard, but only having one of it matters as well. Its probably worse overall.
---
Yeah. The 4 current weapon searchers do the job and you don't want multiple kingsbanes. Just 1
---
No, that should work. When I was playing Quest Paladin my opponents were finding Mass Dispel every time.

If you make your deck worse against all other decks to win a subset of games you have to ask yourself if the trade-offs are worth it. Perhaps the win rate could be affected. But maybe that‚Äôs fine if you find intrinsic enjoyment countering those decks. Just something to consider
---
1)the solo adventure are all same old dungeon runs hence I feel should be free i.m.o also old adventures laugh at a distance
---
2)too many cards have too many powerful discover effects makes the game less skill and more rng its a preference more than anything and shadowverse has just 10more cards so doesn't mean much
---
3)game is not at all f2p friendly ryt now . back in the day we had adventures that gave new content + solo adventures all for 2800 gold this really makes the solo adventures a laughable thing.
---
The words were harsh, but given the context of everything else I think it makes sense. 
---
I was watching live and even in chat and Seiko was really sloppy.
---
20 mana spells sound kinda expensive and unplayable tho
---
What are you talking about? There are meta mage and hunter decks that run secrets, and it's not horrible if you can catch a paladin secret either.
---
Me with warlock! It‚Äôs the one class I know I‚Äôll always have the legendaries for in a deck. Also my favorite class to play in wow, coincidentally!

"well, by using basically all answers I could realistically draw, I managed to finally kill most of my opponent's snowbally board except for a vanilla 1/2, but hopefully it's not going to be much of a problem, right...? Oh, double +2 health, divine spirit, inner fire, it is now a turn 5 12/12. I guess I should have played around it"
---
I got it with 5 mana left earlier today. The other two options were 5 mana, though.
---
So I am making this general comment to all the mental midgets who would rather just come and be insulting, take things out of context and draw inferences that are not being made. Instead of discussing your opinion because surprise you don‚Äôt actually have one. ‚ÄúOh someone said something that disparages a game I play so he must be insulting me too. Rawrwatstw!!!!‚Äù 
---
Obviously you cannot have a rational or productive conversation with people who cannot be intellectually honest. So good job to the small idiotic minority of redditors that give this platform its negative image. You‚Äôve done it again. 
---
Anyway, if you are interested in understanding that things like this do actually go on there is an interesting company you should take a look at a company called Scientific Revenue. Who actually provides services that do exactly this kind of analytics to tell companies how to alter and manipulate players in their games to give them the cash.
---
There are many videos on YouTube about this topic and even one by a very prominent personality which references Activision by name for a patent they hold for a matchmaking system where they match players specifically against one another in order to incentivize spending habits.
---
On a counter to my last statement, a single patent does not equal guilt and there has been no concrete evidence that this system has been implemented in any of their games but that will be neigh impossible without an audit of some kind. However if this was not something that was being implemented or used why would you have a patent for it?
---
You can do your own follow up research but turning players into payers is a very real thing and to just shill and say no no no they wouldn‚Äôt do that is very naive.

I agree, but I also disagree.
---
Class combination is the pinnacle of player agency in any TCG. Without it, design limitations are *much* more strict and propogate a stagnant experience.
---
However, without *some* limitations, there becomes little point of even having independent classes in the first place.
---
The problem with Hearthstone's approach is the lack of corresponsing resources.
---
If Hunter cards required you to have either a Hunter hero or have a card/special mana to play them, burgling cards would be equally less viable and more flavourful.
---
I don't want to pretend I know the answer, but at the very least, I know it's not perfect
---
Thats awful!? Just so I know what to avoid where might you find a decklist for this?
---
Paladin, Warlock, and to some extent, Mage have all been "left high and dry" after their core classic cards have be HOF'd or nerfed, and they have recovered. Priest will not be the exception to that rule
---
Well, there's a reason he's only 2-5 this season. You can't half-ass it at this level of competition and expect to do well. At this rate, even if Blizzard doesn't replace him for being disrespectful, he'll be relegated naturally due to coming in last place.
---
Got gonked once too many
---
It's funny that those who say that HS doesn't require/reward skill are usually stuck at Rank 10 instead of literally earning thousands of dollars for free in those big tournaments since it's such a stupid game.
---
Oh, but right, it's because HS is completely random and they just aren't lucky. I get it.
---
There are no guaranteed packs. And you're competing with over 20K other accounts. Often many more.
---
I got a pack after having the stream live for over 8 hours. Not a single pack yesterday. Nor do I expect to win another this weekend.
---
I think by nerfing Divine Spirit and Inner Fire, you're removing a symptom rather than the core illness: Divine Spirit and Inner Fire would both see play at those mana costs, but they'll just be less meta viable. And then, when Priest inevitably falls to bottom tier after a rotation, the Divine Spirit/Inner Fire combo would still be a crutch to the class in any Standard deck. HoF'ing the cards themselves is the only way to keep Priest healthy and interesting in Standard.
---
Used to do this with paladin years ago before blizzard turned it into this weirdo that it is now. Old school midrange paladin was my favourite deck and there were many variations to play with.
---
Is it common for people to refer to autochess as chess (never played that game)?
---
Or was he trying to make a bad situation more 'acceptable' by pretending it was a more serious (chess) tournament, and not just an HS competitor?
---
OP is just mad he doesn‚Äôt play video games for a living
---
I used to play stardew valley with hearthstone or even wow with hearthstone because that's the only way to make his playable 1 month after an expansion.
---
Seems screaming in rage looks quite different to you and I.
---
Perhaps in your desperation to hate what you don't understand, you see it where it isn't.
---
In deck builder. Up top where you choose class or neutral tabs there are also tabs to select card back and hero
---
Been considering dusting like 4 classes so I have enough cards to go to legend. Have been f2p for several years but can‚Äôt get very high because I like to play each class.
---
Hey LogicianLogician, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".

Feno looks like he is losing a year off his life with every loss and this clown can't even pretend to pay attention?
---
I would be all in favor of an instant DQ and relegation in this case.
---
If Blizzard does not make some sort of very strict penalty, they are saying how little the give a fuck.
---
Hs eports is a joke and everyone knows it, you can also GTFO of this thread if you don't like common opinions.
---
Yeah, plus does it really matter where you're sitting?  Do people really think those gamer chairs actually make you better at video games?  You could be sitting on the toilet and still play competitively.
---
HEY EVERYONE
---
You control where they are positioned and they fight automatically. How is that not the same as chess?
---
GET IN HERE
---
Run rogue and drop Augmented Elekk turn 3 and laugh at how many wishes you can get.
---
Dude, come on. You don't even know this guy. Calm down and move on; no need to resort to a petty insult war over the internet.
---
Maybe he's been playing Gauacamelee 2
---
They don't care about players, the care about stream numbers. Popular players = more viewers, no matter that their skill are lower sometimes.
---
Could add in a mechanic called sleep where a minion can't attack until it takes damage.
---
Autochess, not chess.
---
Autochess is a joke. Please don't confuse it with the real chess.
---
If you will play somewhere at top-100 legend for several months, you will understand there is way less rng that you think. This game is like poker, it's about lowering your opponent chances and making your higher. This game about distance, not about 1 lucky win.
---
Unless they‚Äôre at the same time
---
*DOCTOR* Boom 
---
You will address him by his proper title you little bollocks
---
No, divine spirit needs a mana cost nerf to 5 to be in line with that paladin card that doubles attack and never gets played. So it would never get played.
---
Now that spell are out of the way , he can focus on what is really important
---
The card is likely approaching balanced. The effect is relatively minor and the requirement is very easy to accomplish. Nothing game breaking.
---
This is exactly it, because it didn't used to be this way. I don't want this to turn into a doomposting thread, because I love Hearthstone and want it to succeed, but maybe GM is a sign that Hearthstone really is in its twilight years.
---
r/linksifellfor
---
wow....
---
The problem is Blizzard promoting casual play. Instead of having a system where winning and losing actually matters, they have a bunch of streamers are pretty much set. They need to introduce way more mobility for aspiring pros. People don't want to take it seriously and throw games? Fine, we won't see them anymore.
---
Blizzard could put forth some minimal ‚Äûdecency rules‚Äù, such as not show up in pajamas, use a green-screen to hide your bedroom and so on, not play other games during your match -- you know, rules that one might think as ‚Äûcommon sense‚Äù.
---
Ditching Pompous Thespian would be a good start. It‚Äôs not great.
---
maybe you just need to switch to iPhone 11 /s
---
To chess or to autochess?
---
Looks like Blizzard knew and didn't say he couldn't https://twitter.com/hs_Pasca/status/1172987077341978625?s=20
---
Did something specific happen to his back or is it just general back stuff? I don't watch his stream, just his youtube videos.
---
Agreed.
---
The entire thing is insignificant. His role is as important as any other player in the tournament, which is to say not at all. They are all just video game players. What's wrong with just playing it out and replacing him next time?
---
And I never said any of that. Don't strawman me. You don't need help looking silly.
---
Here's my point, all summed up, in a way even you can grasp through your seething rage.
---
&gt;Any opinion on the matter outside of "Huh, well he should probably quit one or the other or he will keep losing," is ridiculous, hence my ridicule.
---
In every competitive HS broadcast, you actually spend more time watching adverts or just the commentators talking bullshit than the matches themself!  Something needs to be change!
---
Prior to the banker there weren't any suboptimal plays indistinguishable from a concentrated player. That's what i meant. The plays he could have made don't get any magically better the more he thinks about them in holy wrath paladin... You either draw the cards or you don't lol
---
Not sure how much he's getting paid from grandmasters but from I can tell the autochess tourney he was playing for was actually pretty high profile with a $1,000,000 prize pool... which pathetically is more than what hearthstone offers. So it's not like he was just clowning on his phone for a random for fun match. Given he got blizzard's permission to play in both tournaments at once too, well... I kinda like his spirit to try both.
---
Does look pretty good with either of those, but now you're up to 14-mana 3-card combo.
---
The Tundra Rhino one seems the more realistic, since you wouldn't want to run a terrible card like Starving Buzzard that is dead without the combo like you said.
---
This would be a turn 8 play for the first half where you play one cat and the Dire Frenzy. Then on turn 9, you Tundra Rhino and play a 1/2 and three 4/5. Charging damage of 15, but overall much clunkier than just the old Druid Force of Nature + Savage Roar finisher.
---
The good thing is all of the cards are decent on their own, so you don't need to save them for the combo in every matchup. Pretty decent, not busted I think.
---
It's different because Dog continued to be competitive in GM and practiced every week and did his best throughout his commitment.  He respected the audience and the other players who weren't invited enough to put his best into the first season and then withdraw after.
---
What Seiko did was spit in the face of the fans, Blizzard and other competitors who would appreciate the opportunity he was given.
---
The two situations aren't even remotely similar.
---
Ohhh so fuck the people that care about the event because its a game? Why are you here if you dont care about games or the people that play them? Why make this post if it doesnt matter? Its just as insignificant as you claim having games as a job is
---
It's also worth noting that he's friends with a lot of the casters so it's a lot more casual than it probably should be when they interview him.  He's known more for jokes than super serious commentary anyway.
---
When did I ever say "fuck these people"?
---
I didn't. I said you are overreacting. Which is true, you lunatic.
---
If you draw one then there is only one Reno in your deck it would still work
---
Are you dumb? He made the dumbest mistake ever while playing 2 games at once. It actually shows how much attention you need to play hs at a high enough level.
---
It's not a fucking book. 30 seconds worth of text is too long to read? You have attention span of a toddler or what?
---
To end this whole pointless discussion... Competitive HS is significantly more random than lots of other esports. Mostly because it's a card game, which is inherently random. But anyone saying that there's no skill involved and it's just RNG has absolutely no clue what he's talking about.
---
Kinda off topic, but I respect Zalae as a player, he's definitely a smart guy, but does he even really like the game? Whenever I hear him talk about playing HS, it almost seems like he treats playing exclusively as a job. In fact, maybe 5-6 months ago he was streaming with FireBat and he legit said something along the lines of "I consider hearthstone a job, I do other things for fun like going to the gym". Thats fine, I just dont really find him as "fun" as Kibler, fbat, or many other streamers.
---
Yeah, there are very few games out there that have a commander mode (Infinity Wars ccg is the only one that comes to mind for me) in the wide world of online ccgs. While this is not something that could immediately work in hearthstone it is something i could see with a future expansion. There should also be a custom game mode to replay past Tavern Brawls etc.
---
Have you read the other answers? You can't.
---
you don't need to be genius for this Understanding, hs is made for casual players and has nothing lost in esports, they only (tried) to push the game into it to make more money.
---
Oh, I definitely agree and I'm pretty surprised that was their stance on it, but that's a Blizzard issue. I was looking at it from Seiko's perspective, which does seem more reasonable knowing that he asked in advance.
---
Wolf got me again today. He was 3 then.
---
curve 5 have better options differently of curve 4 and you practically lost a turn bcs or you play something and pop up a secret or you lose tempo and losing tempo is practically lose
---
Unseen sabatuer is my favorite card in my quest shaman
---
The poker comparison doesn't work beyond the surface level.  In poker, you can calculate more exact odds, because the cards are just the cards.  The only random element is where they are in the deck and whose hand they end up in and in what combination.  There aren't cards that make your opponent reveal one of his hole cards, or turn one of your cards into another, or discard your hand and try again etc.  
---
The basic strategy might be the same, but hearthstone can't be played at the same level of consistently playing based on the  odds that poker can.  Not even close.
---
it will be a good buff and all this sh*t just because secret mage cant be nerfed
