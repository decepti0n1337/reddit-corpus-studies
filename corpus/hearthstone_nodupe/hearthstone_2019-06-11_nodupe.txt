Price of (say) Dalaran Heist: EUR19.99

---
Less minimum of 15% VAT*: EUR17.38
---
Revenue to Blizzard based on .88 exchange rate: $19.67
---
Price in USD: $19.99
---
Discount given to EU customers*: $0.32
---
*Assuming 15% VAT, which is the EU minimum. In many EU countries, it's actually higher. 
---
So no, you're not paying a premium, you're getting a discount. Are you really ignorant of the fact that VAT exists in EU?
---
I didn't say last, I said at the bottom, and Shaman has definitely had multiple high tier decks throughout HS' history, and Priest has been trash / bad tier for long periods of time.
---
It's definitely not a clear cut whether one has been worse than the other though.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt fully understand. Can someone explain what happened in the video?

How in God's name is whipping out your phone and taking a picture with it easier than pressing PrintScreen?
---
Thats why you need two galvanizers. Each one discounts the next.
---
Stargaze allows you to use hero power twice, and it costs one less. 
---
Burning wilt is a mage hero power in Heist that allows you to reduce the cost of a card by 2. 
---
So you get to reduce the cost of a random card in your hand by 2, twice. For 0 gems.

I was playing armor warrior to get my quest completion and after a Psychic Scream from my opponent, I was glitched and wasn't seeing any cards drawn/couldn't play them. 
---
I kept drawing cards (as evidenced in the 2nd and 3rd pics), but there was nothing I could do.
---
Uses spell vanish and plays pogos again

I don't know why, but this looks so cute and derpy , color it :)

True, I was just saying that calling Mecha‚Äôthun ‚Äúvulnerable to silence‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a fair assessment of its value as a win condition
---
Valeerens and Phileera

---
Cool your jets. Everyone enjoys the game in different ways.
---
They're just trying to ensure that the Chinese market is open to them, i guess
---
"Is that...MILHOUSE?! Oh, never mind, it's just a totem and a prison cell."
---
Do your daily quests, the weekly tavern brawls and save up gold for packs. You'll eventually get to the point most of the cards you pull from packs will be triplicate meaning they're just spare dust anyway and you'll also get to the point you have most of the core cards for each class. Plenty of cards in the classic set end up being used for every class, meaning that it's not a waste to hold on to them.
---
Levelling up each different hero will also get you the basic set cards- again, some of these are still used very commonly in a lot of different decks. It's definitely worth it to play each class till you have every basic set card.
---
If you're new, you'll be able to take advantage of how you can get legendary cards guaranteed in the first 10 packs you open of each set. Assuming you haven't already done this, opening your first 10 packs of each set you can get will get you a legendary for each (and it may not even be 10, you're guaranteed the legendary within the first 10). Then the advice for earlier applies- if you won't ever use it, that's 400 dust per set and if you will use it then that's an easy way to get some of the rarest cards.
---
That my deck was cheap (I was playing Cyclone Mage) and he was playing Token Druid. I had a good laugh.
---
Thank you so much! Last question: should I be spending money then on each set until I get that legendary? I heard only the classic pack stays in play?
---
Despite accepting every friend request I receive, I rarely get the good hate that y‚Äôall seem to find so abundant. 
---
The worst/best one I received was probably well deserved. 
---
I was playing quest warrior sometime during RR or boomsday. I got lucky RNG on a brawl and then was able to do 16 to face (exact lethal) with a [[blackwald pixie]] despite them having 4 minions on board. They sent a friend request, I accepted and opened up with a ‚ÄúGG. Sorry dude, that was some shit luck on your part‚Äù
---
They then went on to whine, cry, and whinge about how terrible their luck is and how they can‚Äôt catch a break to climb ladder.

I didn‚Äôt know Valeera was Canadian
---
I bet those were some unexpected results...
---
How did the Druid get all 4? Double faceless can account for two but what about the other 2?
---
At this point you no longer need Snip Snap in particular, any magnetic minion will do.
---
Just what you need to beat chapter 3, the most boring chapter.
---
Fair enough really with the heavy investment they seem to want to make into solo content at the moment.
---
How is that really an unfair advantage?  Most "quests" are just nonsense anyway to get you playing a few more games a day - what does it matter if it's solo?  
---
Not that I play solo myself but I can see why solo players should get access to quests at least.
---
I wish this happened when I faced Kangor ... would feel great.  
---
Ususally though it's your usual b/s resurrect mechanic that is just "concede".
---
*unlikely, honestly. With enough scenarios, the other stuff will happen. Nobody is playing those two cards on the same turn
---
Kobolds would probably worship this dragon.
---
Must've taken you hours
---
Kobald and Catacombs
---
Which would be okay if not for all those "core values" they shout from the rooftops whenever they need some good PR.
---
The odds of this actually happening is so low, you have a higher chance at pulling an all gold Legendary pack. Because, face it, who plays Millhouse Manastorm!?
---
No
---
Its not about the event it's about the person.
---
The one flaw you have with that Mage combo is reaching turn 6 alive with the luxury of being able to play a non control 6 cost minion.
---
yeah i think that would actually think that would be a good buff but maybe instead have it say
---

It's not just a headhunter either. It's a full DLC witj story, enemies, a raid boss and new gear.

Im sorry that you do not think that my card does mot have an effort.

I'm on pc and i had my cards freeze in 3 games now (made me lose all of them), which makes me think thats probably a problem with the servers

---
tomo00#2244 EU 80g quest trade
---
Its about the person not the event. The card is called tank man, not Tiananmen Square
---
Not at all
---
That would be easy to filter for heuristically, just use embeddings/Word2Vec on existing decks to predict cards in (existing + ranked/"good") decks. It'll be easy to learn card similarities and deck compositions from that. 
---
Complex synergies on the turn by turn level might be a little harder but still learnable. But something as simple as "Decks never/rarely contain multiple cards with similar embeddings by vector V150" is simple and very learnable. I've seen it done.
---
for me it was not only visual, selecting a deck at this point did warn about the deck being incomplete and asked me to auto-fill
---
at first glance it looks okay... but The mech part doesn't synergize well at all with the other rush minions. Oh and most important no brawl or board clear. All these decks are stupid cuz they're missing important cards or have shit cards added that make them perform bad.
---
The nerubians aren't the only bugs in Warcraft lore
---
Shudderwock is one if the worst designed cards this game has ever seen
---
Nice they even done it in standart. x'D

---
Well im debating it so therefore it is.
---
Nyx will guide me!
---
Where does the noob come from?
---
Agreed. While I do not play as much as I did back in 2017(I was addicted as ***) the game really grows on me lately. They managed to keep the game interesting for me until now. I have been crafting lots of cards like Lord Jarraxxus, that alone should prove enough.
---
Shudderwock is missing in this deck.
---
Hey, mod /u/czhihong,
---
you need to remove this China-critical comment before Winnie the Pooh gets angry :(
---
He was actually run in Paladin with the summon 3 2-drops card.
---
So, you can put any sh*t into specific frame (https://www.pngfind.com/pngs/m/158-1581460_hearthstone-card-png-hearthstone-empty-card-transparent-png.png) and voila - it is related to HS now )
---
C'mon mate, be reasonable. The poor light-headed guy expressed somebody's (maybe his own, I dunno) political opinion, formed it into card and felt sadness because nobody (or small part, almost nobody) acknowledged and appreciated this.
---
The HS sub is neither dedicated to politics nor politically related opinions.
---
Therefore this post belongs to some other subreddit where it will be accounted, discussed, supported or negated - I don't care, cause I'm not there. But, here, I come to read or write smth related to HS directly.
---
This is the point many people try to make but the poor bastard refuses to account other people's opinions, while trying to push his (or not his - doesn't matter) own.
---
Probably to inconsistend
---
It‚Äôs about censorship in the Hearthstone app. It‚Äôs in the Hearthstone app. It‚Äôs literally based out of Hearthstone.
---
It's more than just putting a picture into the card frame. 
---
The card has also an interesting effect: **Cannot be silenced.**
---
But personally, I think it should be up to the sub (the users) to up / downvote a custom card depending on whether they think it's original. Mods should focus on deleting completely off topic and offensive stuff.
---
Pretty sure [[Giant Sand Worm]] is bigger.
---

Again, thought that I‚Äôll have no time today, although did like 7 runs and finally cleared the rogue, I thought that rogue will be the one where I‚Äôll need ~250bosses defeated till I hit the right rng, but apparently almost all buckets of pirates and several removals with double captured flag works wonders, Azari had no chance, was the easiest final boss run, althought the hardest overall run, I got insanely lucky before Azari it‚Äôs like I got good bosses and pretty dumb AI decissions. This run was frustrating as hell, definatelly rogue is the hardest one.
---
Maybe, if you play for years now... For new players, no.

Thank you!

That play was insane, the mechachun was a random legendary in the opponents deck aswell. Insane
---
Well the blizzard logo is a p3do spiral inside some sort of Altar (Sun Altar, sacrifice?)... We have to assume they are fully part of the luciferian cult then right?  Their symbolism will be their downfall.
---
Yes, that's what 'long run' means ;-)
---
Also, not maybe, but definitely.
---
For new players you're right: they should probably just play standard and see after the first rotation which one is cheaper.
---
I mean that your card got silenced, given its text. Not the man himself who yes I totally agree with you.
---
If you dust all cards from a pack, the long term average dust value is ~105. A significant part of that is the legendaries/goldens that are more stochastic, so over a shorter stretch of packs ~70 dust is a safer guess.
---
Or just somehow get a mechwarper as warlock and do it that way. Much easier.

If we assume that Zetalot maintained a 50% win-rate throughout, that means he lost at least 30,000 times as Priest.

In all honesty, I really enjoyed Cubelock myself. But I didn't play it when it was the whole meta (or at all, in that period).

One time I beat a guy and immediately went to take a piss. When I came back he had sent a friend request. When I added him he was already logged out. So come two days later he logs on and PM's me "who is this?" And unadds me before I can even respond. It basically told me he's just some impatient angry person who hates everyone and can't even remember adding someone because he probably rages at everyone and sends them all angry messages. Imagine getting mad at a card game that much in casual mode?

---
You just get 2x the stats per deathrattle. The number of valanyrs goes from 1-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;16...-&gt;2^(n-1), which is exponential. But you still have to pay for each valanyr. So, per mana you only get double the stats.

People inside of warcraft cant play other fantasy based games?  The only game they play is based on real characters?  It would be within canon if they had a game based on the future in a world where such future didnt exist.
---
Somebody at Blizzard give this man a platinum hero or something.
---
An apology for scheduled maintenance?
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but you pay for Val'anyr once, when you play it. Normally, it auto-reequips when the minion it enchants dies.
---
But since the minion it enchanted got two deathrattles, and both trigger twice, you equip 4 Val'anyrs. So 3 of them automatically break, giving you 6 handbuffs right away. I break that one as well, and I'm up to 8 handbuffs. If those all stacked on the same minion, then it got 4x the statboosts compared to the original minion.

Something like that is probably a good list. They have -1 earthshock  -1 hogsteed and +1 swampqueen +1 scargil compared to yours.

What you should drop depends a lot on what you're seeing on the ladder. If you feel like you need double silence, then drop hogsteed. If not, drop earthshock.

Ol' Toomba has a line when he plays Elise Starseeker, claiming that he thought she was in the desert right now. Considering how the latest place she was confirmed for being at was Un'Goro, this is probably a nod to the next set and that it'll involve a notable desert with archaeological potential.

I went 4 and a half years in  between getting my first Golden Hero (Warlock) and my second (Shaman) despite playing every day in that time.
---
I used to play exclusively Warlock in ranked, and play a lot of unranked for completing my dailies. Then I began to shift around from class to class more in ranked, and eventually started playing ranked for doing my dailies.
---
Priest and Warrior are my next two closest classes for golden portraits (67 and 103 more wins needed). My lowest number of ranked wins is the Rogue, at 183, followed by Mage at 202.

As another person who quit playing a year ago not really. I came back bought the new welcome bundle for 5 bucks, got about 4k dust from all the hall of famed cards and such. Then dusted all my rotated cards because wild is not my cup of tea. And for a 5$ investment i have 3 solid meta decks and have been having a great time!
---
You‚Äôre thinking of Cosmic Anomaly
---
Yeah agreed; single player content isn‚Äôt worth the price (imo, obviously) and the card changes have given us yet another super boring aggro meta.

It's connected to Uldum, just not directly accessible from Un'goro.  Uldum is where they created various things to try out in Un'Goro.  I believe AQ was also a Titan facility at one point, connected on the other end.

It might be just reusing assets. Or not. All I'm saying is that those teasers for last two years are intentionally vague.

I can't afford to throw a bunch of gold down the well if I am not going to get useful PvP cards.  I am doing fine with the normal gold progression as a result of them getting rid of 40 gold quests  plus an intermittent dust income from nerfs.  That will change if I randomly drain 2800 gold from myself every set for solo play.

I preferred the old system where adventures came instead of expansions and came with unique cards.

Spirit of the frog

Outside of Rogue it would be an inconsistent clown fiesta involving Bankers and randomly winning the game in the most BS way possible.
---
It's meant to play fel reaver to empty it's own deck before it shuffles in pogo hoppers
---
Great Job! It wasn't until now that I realized that the actual Card Backs can not be the card backs to the cards as they have completely different shapes! Thought it was weird you never showed both sides, then I looked at the different card shapes!
---
Fuck this sort of rng tho
---
Thanks for including dust totals right by the links!
---
Cause it's not targetable anymore
---
I hope this isn't true.

Enough own dick pleasing, make something original, no need to keep on coming back to already developed ideas all the time.
---
That was the first thing I noticed. Then I thought to myself that if I made the video I'd wait until Silver was at maximum REEEE and swap their faces.
---
I swear, I just started playing this game recently and seeing stuff like this confuses and concerns me
---
Mindbreakers effect is disabled in solo mode because bosses are mostly built around their hero powers

The only thing HoFing Leeroy would do is shift the anger from it to Reckless Rocketeer.

So I think I should make the question easier for you to answer, it was kinda hard.

You just asked if you could buy the website (with more private stuff of course) after the announcement that the website will be closed? If before, may I ask when? That's basicly the most interesting question imo.

If you only want to play in standard mode, which uses only recent collection cards, you can make dust cards from older collections that do not enter this mode.

I would love to see a Diablo-themed dungeon run that you can run one month out of the year with Diablo themed treasures and encounters. Toggwaggle misuses "shiny" and opens a portal to Greed's Domain. Play through an 8 boss run with passive treasures like Witchdoctor's Totem that adds a random "Frog" spell to your hand at the end of each turn and Barbarian's Fury that gives your hero +1 attack and Windfury on your turn, as well as powerful playable treasures like Azurewrath that casts Blizzard with every swing of the weapon.

A throwback would have been before tink was nerfed...and it wasn't random minions.
---
gotcha
---
Amazing! Totally original, totally not a repost, well done! Great job!
---
I thought resurrect priest was super fun when hunter got boring.
---
Warlock with Arch-Villain rafaam is also fun because of the randomness Rafaam creates.
---
What‚Äôs the difference as a consumer?
