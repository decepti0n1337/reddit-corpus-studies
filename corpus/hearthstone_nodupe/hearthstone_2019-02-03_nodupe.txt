I haven't seen whatever you're talking about, but are you sure those are discounted cards, and not just the unnerfed versions?
---
The 'Hall of Champions' brawl, which I have seen, directly accessed the older card files rather than modifying the current ones.
---
Controlwarrior should also work quite well
---
Uh. I didn‚Äôt find it hard at all to do as Shaman (I had win as a shaman that day).
---
Use freezes to stall your opponent‚Äôs one attacker.
---
Keep a windfury or two in your hand for when you have half their life.
---
Keep rockbiter on hand for that turn for an extra 6. 
---
Hope you can do it before the priest has 10 mana and can take your guy. Even if that happens, he still can‚Äôt use him that turn so keep freezing.
---
I‚Äôd post my deck but honestly it‚Äôs probably not even super efficient because I‚Äôm a totally free to play player and don‚Äôt have a ton of amazing cards.
---
&gt;Hopefully, we see a focus back on skill based, decision oriented game play. If not, its uninstall as opposed to preorder.  
---
Yeah I'd like to see that too.  There is such a massive dive in skill levels across the game right now it's fairly frustrating.  So many decks play themselves and when you do want to pilot a deck that requires a little more thought and planning you often hit the wall of the more mindless of the autplay otk/combo decks.  
---
I'd like to see some more true control decks come back (you know, control the board as in actually get a presence on it to win with, not just clear, clear, clear play I win card(s)).
---
There is almost nothing left in that area.    
---
I imagine many players may struggle after rotation without the get out of jail free cards of Guldan, Jaina and Rexxar.  Unfortunately Mechathun stays as well as what I imagine will become one of the more hated cards in Shiravallah.  Another really big bonus is recruit is pretty much gone which is great as that means far less cheating out minions.  
---
Cube goes as does a lot of control cards (there is just too much control cards right now).
---
Things look good but then odd/even remains so we could very well end up with a very aggro meta for quite some time. Which is better than what we have now at least.
---
OTK are not a problem if they suck ass.
---
Blizzard tried it's best to keep Quest Mage at bay and it succeeded.
---
The problem is when they intentionally make a OTK deck good like some Mecha'Thun decks and OTK Paladin. That is a a problem.
---
my refresh rate is 60 but it was locked at 30 and staggering hard.
---
I don't play clone no, I don't want to craft the Lyra cause of rotation.
---
Meta decks that I think are harder to pilot than clone priest? Off the top of my head...Even pala, Control priest, mechalock, maybe like holy wrath pala etc. I find the more choices a deck has turn to turn, generally the more difficult it is to pilot.
---
Having said that I haven't played clone priest so maybe I'm wrong but from watching it played at HCT/on streams most turns look fairly straightforward in terms of decision making to me.
---
Also the difficulty of piloting any deck can vastly change from matchup to matchup. Clone priest is no different nor are any of the decks I listed. My only point being labeling any deck as THE hardest deck to pilot doesn't really work imo.
---
Recruit into 5/4
---
Pyro (8 mana left)
---
Consecration (4 mana, 13 health left, clears his board and pops tirion's bubble)
---
Tirion goes face (7 health)
---
Equality killing pyro and tirion (2 mana, get 5 atk weapon)
---
Hit face with weapon (2 health)
---
Bluegill face (0 mana, 0 health)
---
This is just from looking at it, but I think those interactions work as I'm thinking and give lethal.
---
I have been around just long enough to remember people crying out for Control to be viable. This was just before Frozen Throne and the DK debacle. 
---
I loved DK's at first. I still have Hunter and Priest to this day. But Rexxar is problematic. Infinite resources are bad in any game. And Mage can very nearly get there, too, though it has to work for it a bit more. 
---
I wont miss this Meta. More Aggro, and games that dont require 20 minutes, would be nice. Heck, maybe we could even get a Hero card that grants Warrior a useful hero power for something other than seeing how long you can make a game last, and to what degree you can bore the crap out of opponents. 
---
Yeah... Until a good removal for pala, I lost my deck. And it was wild, so also I had ragnaros lord of light, and other awesome cards, epic and legendarys.  I lost a lot of time making that deck. Is really sad cause blizzard really don't care and nerf the most cheap crap. I think i'm not going to play anymore, for a long time.
---
Yeah, its pretty much bs. We had legendaries being nerfes left and right.

*Preparation has been added to the Hall of Fame*
---
Have you ever played a plain chameleos, it has an animation of just an intense pop up, which should never be even possible to be seen.
---
Nerfed decks should be able to be DE'd for full. 
---
Problem is I've been playing against hunters 7 times out of 10. Personally I don't think bakku or glenn is a problem. The hero power value comes as a cost. Definitely need to nerf rexxar and jaina. No card should be a win condition, (except maybe for mechathun or uther). 
---
But none of my decks these past few expansions have been extremely powerful, and most of them have been impacted by nerfs.
---
Can you guys delete baku and genn from the set yet? 
---
Infinite until your board is full. Also infinite until you fill your hand. You might want to look up "infinite" 
---
I actually played Spell Hunter without To My Side and Rokdellar the first time Spell Hunter was strong and reached Legend. Also I had the help of Barnes.
---
Kings bane was literally not able to be countered. You destroy the weapon, it comes back. The only way to get rid of it was by somehow milling it, that is extremely powerful. 
---
The rank floors are one of the best things Team 5 has done. Shortened the grind massively and allowed for punishment free experimentation. I spend a ton of my time playing decks like these because of it.
---
Because people are using the safety of rank 5 try to different/fun decks? Should be expected. If anything this should make your way to rank 4 easier.
---
Mind Blast Priest was indirectly pushed by Witchtree Firedoctor! So we got TWO whole control decks pushed.
---
Then you Seance / Brewmaster / Zola them to swap again. Reminds me of Mind Control battles in early Priest mirror matches.
---
It seems to make it only harder because, for some reason, these decks always seem to get REALLY lucky against me.
---
You see that they played Griftah? Well, they got the Zola they chose, and I got the Arena Treasure Chest.
---
Two Drakkari Tricksters gave him Rexxar each time, and I got Cloning Device both times.
---
Explanation: Playing Tess, I got the passive effect "cards that did not start in your hand cost 1 less."
---
Against a boss with a warlock effect I discovered into a [[Glinda Crowskin]]. I played Glinda into 3 [[Questing Adventurer]]. Glinda and one questing survived while I had an [[Elven Archer]] in hand.
---
Since the Archer has echo and the echoed archers cost 1 less, I was able to buff my questing infinitely by repeatedly playing archers and shooting the previous Archer, killing it for board space.
---
I'm losing so it must be the deck's fault

---
Check my explanation below. You kill archers with archers. I only needed 2 board spots for archers.
---
Despite "deck building restrictions" Patches Reno and Jade were all top tier decks prior to nerfs, Baku and Genn have a similar restriction to Reno but far FAR more power in their best classes
---
He is able to play his control mage, he got to rank 100ish legend didn't he? I've instantly won the last few games against mechathun decks with a well timed Zuni as midrange pally.
---
All OTKs take all game to set up.
---
Ya and normally we've been ignored. They also tend to Nerf cards that give the least dust 
---
If you always dust every card. you will have around 10,000 dust after opening 100 packs because of legendaries and epics.
---
They aren't killed, merely reduced health while removing all opposing minions.
---
There is absolutely no way that your supposed new player playerbase who learned enough (or read enough on reddit) to understand how odd rogue is a thing and simultaneously has enough dust for baku but isn't spending enough on the game to be crippled by him being nerfed .. is over like maybe 2%. You're really overselling the hit nerfing her would have.
---
Also, you say it would fuck the meta, I'd say it would fix it. I'm tired of 75% of all my games starting with an animation before turn 1 that defines the entire game. I play only wild too so it's not like I'll ever be divorced from these abominations; they're here to stay forever.
---
Because when they lose they are usually mad and when they win they assume you're mad.
---
The last time someone accepted my friend request he just said "bla bla you're good I'm bad. stay salty kid, bye" and removed me right after before I even said a word.

Want a cookie?
---
There are a few with Scarab Egg and Grim Rally, but they don‚Äôt run Keleseth and focus on the Egg Package, like Devilsaur Egg and the 4/4 with Adapt 2. Some even go as deep as to add Ratcatcher.
---
It should draw a card. Liken it to Farsight.
---
We should balance all cards around cards that only see play sometimes in really slow decks as a one of.
---
Ok, so +2 mana
---
Wouldn't it run barnes yshaarj instead? When those were standard they were included over to my side and rhokdelar
---
So was [[Ancient of Lore]]. Used to be OP for drawing 2 cards, so they nerfed it and made UI. 
---
Yep, they should change it's cost on 6.

---
7/5/5 | Choose One - Draw a card; or Restore 5 Health.  
---
The decklist looks pretty good to me.  Since you're playing the more control style variant of odd mage, you don't want to put in fungalmancer/leeroy.  You could consider crafting Baron Geddon - it's a classic legendary so it will still be playable after the rotation, but it's main use is usually as a hail mary/board clear (and heal, if you're the DK Jaina).  I've seen some versions also include Blazecaller (that 7 mana 6/6 that also deals 5 if you played an elemental in the previous turn) - but I wouldn't craft it because it is an Un'goro card so it's good for only another 2 months in standard.
---
Should be 2 or 3 mana. 4 mana means they can only use it twice an expansion. They already used it twice in this one, and there's some time left. 
---
This is at least something worthy to brag about, not like all these "hey i got my first rank5/legend/12wins today!"-posts, of which we get about 5 every day.
---
It's the same system used in WoW. An (item) card can be sold/traded until it is (equipped) used in a deck.
---
It's definitely a combo card, not a tempo one.
---
I know such a decision would almost certainly herald a full refund for both cards, but my personal issue with just removing both cards is how budget friendly both actually are.
---
Having both cards pays for at least a large chunk of the cost of about eight competitive decks between them in a way that say the Lich King doesn't do. While I do think the power of both cards can reasonably be toned down for just the classes that could use it, an extreme reaction won't make the game any better.
---
Yeah
---
It was a no brainer in most midrange decks as well.  Why wouldn't you run it with token generation?
---
&gt;And then when the hell will you ever want to make your board want to be an exact duplicate of your opponent's board?
---
Learning to manipulate the board in various ways serves a lot of different ends. It'll let you see more different plays that might only be available under niche circumstances.
---
Honestly shocked to see so many negative comments in here, I know we‚Äôre on the internet so it shouldn‚Äôt be that surprising, but I thought better of this community.
---
You should feel proud of your achievement, and it is an impressive achievement, despite what any of the trolls are saying. Keep kicking ass Katrina!
---
Currently I'm trying to get a Lich Queen Jaina / Elemental deck off the ground.  I was having more success with my secret control deck that just had a ysera late game.
---
Here's my latest match with my current deck:
---
https://hsreplay.net/replay/hiL9Xd6JFe6V3guyTS35dN

But I feel like I had more success (and fun because I love secrets) with my older deck:

https://hsreplay.net/replay/u6eiKgFXgTBE8g5ZWQFkTE
---
Literally nobody gives a shit about your dumb ass opinion dude. 
---
Clearly the AI didn't use the hero power at all in the screenshot though.
---
literally nobody gives a shit about your dumb ass opinion, dude.
---
I think people were saying that but I'm too lazy to check
---
Perhaps for those two card, saying the design intention of them wasn't change would have been been.
---
Am I correct?
---
That's not the issue, the issue is that they're unfun. If I had a 60% winrate against a deck that I could only beat by doing quadratics I'd still hate facing them.
---
It's not about odd rogue or any meta decks in of itself; it's about new players getting shit on by odd rogue, saying "oh that's a cool card" and crafting odd priest or whatever, or wanting to replicate the deck they got fucked by and thinking the card is cool enough to make multiple decks out of. 
---
The meta will change as it has over countless expansions. Although odd/even decks are only likely to get stronger and stronger as more options present themselves, I guarantee you that in two years there will be a new cancer that shits on both odd and even archetypes.
---
1600 dust when they spent their entire collection crafting alakir and other niche legendaries is not nearly enough. 
---
&gt;no brainer
---
Thats an interesting argument.
---
How many rogue decks dont run prep? Some, but if you have any reasonable ampunt of spells you instsntly put in prep. 
---
How many shaman decks dont run mana tide totem? Some, but unless youre very aggressive or even youre running it.
---
What about wild growth or even nourish in druid? Its still a no-brainer for some decks, even though they both were nerfed. Why? Because druid has nothing else like then worth running  
---
Nerfing equality doesnt do shit to make running it a meaningful decision. It will if they give pally better clears, but if they're worried about that you're supposed to add the clears first and then screw over their currently sole option.
---
(No, shrink ray doesnt count because you can already easily run it besides equality and probably will still run it besides equality after the nerf)
---
I'm doing my part, didn't preorder the last two expansions or buy any of the "deals" during christmas break (the wild one was tempting though). No more money spent on this game until they get their act together. Just get rid of the classic set and be done with it, stop nerfing staple cards, it makes me not want to play this game anymore.
---
First time?
---
Demonbolt is value
---
&gt; It's not as though people were saying "This card is so bad, that it can never become good, even if Blizz prints cards to directly support it."
---
[You say that but...](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7h7e85/to_my_side_is_the_worst_hearthstone_card_ever/)
---
&gt; No matter how you spin it... this card is just a waste. It can never ever be good.
---
&gt; I refuse to believe that the hearthstone design team could actually make a card this offensively bad.
---
&gt; I'd rather play magma rager...
---
People were literally saying the card was so bad that it could never become good.
---
You cant just say that and not provide a decklist dude
---
Okay, thanks a lot! I have around 4k dust at the moment, that is all the dut I have. Thank you so much for the help!
---
It could have a condition that it only triggers on the active player's turn? Although I guess Mechathun can create a draw too, right?
---
Alright, thanks a lot for the advice! So I should craft the legendary Baku, seems good! I'm definitely going to try this out this week.
---
It's really not that long, you can bang it out in 15 minutes.

I miss when I first started playing hearthstone thinking counterfeit coin into shado-pan rider was such a power play. I'll definitely have to consider making a second account
---
When I run Resurrect Priest, why should I win vs. Hunter?
---
Can‚Äôt provide a decklist rn but basically it‚Äôs 2 Augmented Elekks and 2 deck of Wonders, then glyphs to try to get more DoW. 
---
Also Luna‚Äôs pocket galaxy If you can squeeze it in, to make the elekks cost less so you can combo it all in one turn.

If I had the quest for Mage it‚Äôd be so much easier.

I remember having this issue once, something was fucked in my Google play store. I can't remember how I ended up fixing it, though.
---
Try contacting blizzard support about it
---
this would be nice, but then the wouldn't get as much money
---
f2p btw
---
Then maybe you're playing a deck with a bad strategy if it can be countered turn 1?
---
It's not like there aren't other decks that have poor strategies due to counters available
---
That's how metas work man
---
So what about shrink ray, 5 mana equality + peacekeeper on everyone? Lmao..
---
Nah Equality was fine at 2 mana, 3 mana would also be fine. 4 is a joke, borderline unplayable. 
---
Not only that, the classes with 1 card board clears have other board clears as well. Control Paladin doesn't have many options
---
All of the control tools that Blizzard have been pushing for the past 3 years dictate that Paladin needs a board clear to promote that.
---
Better have 59 more posts of people printing out cards or having their kids draw shitty hearthstone things, that's better! Also buckets from rumble run! Haha funny!
---
Frost Nova doomsayer is also high risk.  It dies to silence, it dies to void ripper, you can silence your own minion and get lethal sometimes, you can just kill doomsayer with charge/rush/spells sometimes.  Like...sure, sometimes it's better because your opponent can't develop a new board, but sometimes it's bad.
---
But that's a good since it tanks the win rate of Paladin OTK decks, which are really not fun to play against.
---
Exactly ! 
---
You can run Kathrena instead of the no minion stuff and imo it is a better version of the deck, but hsreplay lumps it under "Recruit Hunter" so it's hard to say definitively.
---
Fuck that card. Everytime i see it i forfeit.
---
From one stubborn girl to another, fuck yeah, you go Kat.
---
Now if you don't mind me I'll just be over here trying to make Combo Shudderwock Shaman get over a 50% winrate in post-nerf Standard.
---
If you're not spending money in any meaningful way to promote the existence of the game then I have no sympathy. 
---
Nut the thing is he isn't spending money in the first place. 
---
My bad for assuming he was a new player who actually needed help.

I feel like I'm missing something. How did it kill Dreadsteed?

Epics have always been a bigger investment than legendaries imo.
---
That said, your post made me wonder what would the game look like if we could only get 1 epic in our deck.
---
no they both are big issues for design of future and current cards and how theyre changed, we get multiple nerfs of fine cards just to remove them from odd/even.
---
Baku and genn are both issues.

&gt;Where in that does it imply "Your post is about how redditors are inconsistent and self-interested to the point of hypocrisy."?
---
..
---
&gt;I don't see why anything has changed from the last set of nerfs and the same complaints were put forward and so quickly voted down.
---
&gt;Funny when the shoe is on the other foot it seems.
---
In other words, "people are upvoting threads now that they downvoted before, because it's their decks that are getting nerfed and not other people's".  If you'd like to clarify what you meant, go ahead, but that was the message that I got from your post.
---
&gt;you clearly engaged with me in a constructive debate
---
I hope that you are finding this constructive.  As I said, your initial comment seemed like it was meant to shut down conversation as just "reddit being reddit", while saying that the problem of nerfs was insoluble.  Neither of those are constructive positions; you shouldn't brush aside other people's concerns just because you don't respect them, and the problem of nerfs is clearly not insoluble because others in this thread have offered solutions.
---
&gt;I never said anything of the sort.
---
You've said this multiple times, but you never go on to actually clarify what you said.  Obviously you think I have misunderstood you, but since you refuse to correct me, I evidently will have to carry on misunderstanding.  What did you mean, then?
---
&gt;why would they nerf anything if it wasn't either for the greater good or for revenue increases?
---
Yes, I think them being stingy with dusts surrounding nerfs is not them acting for the greater good, but them acting for revenue increases.  I imagine (baselessly) that they see their strategy as kind of a compromise - the playerbase wants nerfs, and they don't want to give free dust, so what if they just nerf in a way that doesn't give free dust?  I don't think them offering such little dust has anything to do with the "greater good".
---
&gt;To be fair there was no need for any of these nerfs at all, the meta had sorted out spellstone, shaman wasn't doing well anyway, odd rogue was performing well but not overpowered.
---
Yeah for sure.  Maybe Spellstone could be nerfed, since it does dominate other proactive decks pretty hard.  It was pretty hard to play Rogue in a meta of 30% Hunters.  But honestly, it's nowhere close to as bad as, say, pre-nerf Even Pally.  And Priest, although I don't like playing against Priest, is still not as bad as Druid was (and don't get me started on the Druid nerfs...).
---
I don't think the current meta can be improved through nerfs, I think there are too many cards that would have to be nerfed, and we just have to wait until rotation.  This is a very important rotation, because if the game isn't more fun when the next expansion comes out, then I think a lot of people will become disillusioned.
---
Cmmn. Odd paladin needs one legenday and zero epics. 
---
So many board clears, yet it's not a slow OTK warlock deck doing so well on ladder. 
---
Yeah, it's so unreliable, that's why you don't see any slow control paladin decks atm... Ow wait. 
---
Exacly what hapened, I won anyway beacouse Glinda stayed alive :P
---
Me too. I played even mage, odd warlock, odd and even druid, also going to try even hunter. I also played even warrior a while back and all of this decks are so fun to play with.
---
nah it's with Lillian Voss
---
Imagine it without Deathstalker Rexxar
---
Your hero power literally makes a 1/1 minion, the perfect synergy for equality.
---
Lmao
---
Based on OTK paladins win rate, often enough.
---
It's not funny how much of a better game I find auto chess compared to HS. Despite all the RNG I legit don't feel tilted when I lose. It's fun all the way to end. I just don't feel like I get screwed in the same "bad way" even though there soooo much more RNG in comparison 
---
Well, you should play quest turn one right? So you should not be able to discard it.
---
However, wouldn't not playing guest give you more control deck regarding discard, especially with high priestess? 
---
Craft foam and glossy paper.
---
It should have hearthstone feature tho 
---
&gt; Patches 
---
&gt; killed
---
*Laughs in Swashburglar*
---
Patches is still popular in wild, played in odd Rogue, arguably the best deck in the format. Reno Priest is around tier 2, playing Raza.
---
We both love Ikea!
---
I don't think your approach is especially feasible for most players. "Severeal tens of thousands of dust locked away in useless duplicates" suggests a collection far above what most people could hope to achieve.
---
It‚Äôs a total fucking shit client on almost every platform
---
I've been thinking about this issue and I think giving a short full dust refund window for 30 cards should be enough. For example, OP built a even shaman deck and blizzard ruined it by a nerf. So if blizz offered refunds for at least 30 cards, OP could get the whole dust investment in the deck back. 
---
Except the nerf for kingsbane and shudderwock were correct. Lifesteal was the unfun aspect of a big kingsbane, and kingsbane isn't remotely dead as its strong in pirate rogue in wild. Also shudderwock is used in jade shaman or any sort of random battle cry or classic shudderwock in wild.

Those cards were nerfed in a way that allowed them to continue to see play. Just not in standard, but in wild they are still good. Therefore I'd say these were great nerfs. The nerf to chain gang also disrupted zoo warlock a bit, which was benefitting from lucky keleseth or buffs too much. It was a double whammy of good effects. Sure hand buff pally was never a problem, but it can still be played if you want it, it was never tier one anyway. 
---
Though you can reroll the old ones for the new ones.
---
And with consec you are not using 2 cards? Lmao
---
There is a card in there which is essentially pre-nerf warsong commander, I think it's called super soldier. So there's a precedent.
---
Man, you must feel real stupid right about now.
---
I'm not fully defending Blizzard here because I think some things can be changed (specifically regarding epic cards), but I feel like you were really shooting yourself in the foot. You kept creating new accounts over and over again.
---
The way to get a lot of dust is to slowly build up a better and better collection. You'll end up with more dupes and so you'll start to gradually build up a pipeline of more dust. If you're frequently creating new accounts you're just setting yourself back over and over again. 
---
I threw this in my odd pala because I don't have a second corridor creeper and she straight up wins games on the spot sometimes.
---
Discussion is never pointless, in case you forgot about the nerf to Tess.
---
Haha, yeah untill Rexxar turned out to be the most broken shit ever.

Nope. Hall of faming the cards would leave them as a problem in wild. And then they may have to print new cards for the Classic set like they just did for Mage, Warlock, and Rogue. 
---
Changing the cards is a simpler solution. 
---
&gt; those cards have never been problematic before baku and genn made them bit to good in few odd/even decks,
---
It‚Äôs almost like you didn‚Äôt read what I previously wrote. The only one of these nerfs that‚Äôs remotely close to being about how good a card is in an odd or even deck is Flametongue Totem. 
---
Equality has zero to do with Even Paladin. 
---
Firefly into Flame Elemental + Cold Blood can be done in *any* aggro Rogue deck. And Cold Blood has arguably been a bigger staple in Rogue than Prep. 
---
Flametongue has always been a staple in aggro Shaman decks. The amount of value you can get for it sometimes is *insane*. 
---
Blizzard didn‚Äôt want cards with so much value in the Classic set. They‚Äôre adjusting the power level to allow for better future design. And taking a more thoughtful approach than just HoF‚Äôing them, which would leave problems in Wild and holes in the card set. 
---
I actually just drew really bad, I got a bunch of a late game cards and my opponent overpowered me. 
---
Clearly often enough. 
---
It's amazing how people describe even the old equality as being super bad once it gets nerfed.

They'll reduce the amount of dust you get to compensate.
---
Congrats!
---
So how many 6 and 7+ cards in your deck? I've not seen your deck shape clearly.
---
Pretty sure the market sets the price. Not some whiny child on reddit.
---
I wouldn't say that so blithely. If Shaman gets more efficient spellpower/damage dealing spells, they are well on the way toward having a straight-up burn deck.
---
You look at some of the popular decks and they require 5 or 6 legendary cards and then the epics should be a problem? Okay....
---
If you check the overall dustcost now compared to 2 or 3 years ago this is just fucked up overall.
---
Same with hunter and rogue. They continue printing these crazy late game cards for them like Emeriss, Rexxar DK, Academic Espionage, Tess, etc. but no good board clears for them.
---
F
---
Hahaha geez, you salty bro?
---
we're not looking for help we're looking to double our gold.
---
Obviously he needed a taunt against that big boi
---
The only reason they are forced to be an aggressor almost every time is BECAUSE Blizzard won't print any good board clears for hunter (and rogue). Same thing would happen with any class if they didn't have access to good board wipes.  Why does hunter and rogue have to be the only classes that gets punished with no good aoe?
---
Mage was the hardest for me but got it done eventually ..nice
---
Nice job.  That's 2 more than my best
---
Both epic and legendary cost too much. It's way too expensive to wanting to try new playstyles. No matter what you want to try you are missing multiple legendaries to feel complete.
---
I'm at 5 or 6 too.  I guess this means I can destroy 3 of my opponents' decks?  6 x 1/2 = 3!
---
Reason #1 why I netdeck. There are so many fun, wonky decks I would love to try out. But I sure as hell won't spend thousands of dust on a deck that might possibly be complete garbage. I feel bad enough crafting a few cards on a netdeck only to find out that I suck at playing that particular deck.
---
Because adding new content takes effort and money and Blizzard just doesn‚Äôt want to expend either of those these days.
---
you should save 1 quest so you can get a new event quest for the day and reroll your saved quest into a second event quest.
---
2 stonehills tho.. tirion, sunkeeper... 
---
Next time you should use the card history bar on the left of the game board, so you don't have to make a reddit thread.
---
Or stop overreacting and restart your game?
---
I have all the dust I want and I still have a hard time committing to crafting epics
---
I enjoyed my time making weird substitutions and having the best deck I can with the limited cards I have. That's what I want a story mode of sorts that's monthly or something where you can start from 0 and just enjoy collecting again. 
---
There is a difference between Hunter/Rogue and Paladin. Those two classes are designed around tempo play. Rogue around combo as well. Paladin is designed around slower games. Midrange and control. Having a slow class have no proper board clears is much worse than having a tempo class not have them. Would Rogue and Hunter like better clears? Sure, who wouldn't. Do they need them? Not really.
---
Paladin needs them unless expansion cards add broken aggro cards, which has happened. But the core identity of paladin is significantly slower than that of Rogue and Hunter. Removing Paladin's control option is like removing Rogue's tempo option or Mage's burn options.
---
&gt;Clearly often enough.
---
ever played a paladin deck?
---
You actually can run barnes ysharjj and TMS becuase of the comsistency of masters call which most lists run two of. You‚Äôve got a very good chance of clearing both minions from your deck by turn 6.
---
Equality is a must include card in every paladin deck (except odd paladin for an obvious reason). Whereas fireball and frostbolt are still archetype dependent. You seldom ever see a fireball in a control mage deck. I would assume there are other classic/standard cards that are also "must include", but that class likely isn't as highly represented in the current meta like paladin.
---
What's your normal end of season rank?
---
Its not just the card costs, it doesn't last. Built deck with 5 epics and 2 legendaries? Nerf commons so you lose 5k dust. 
---
As a Reno-lock main my game plan against DK Jaina is always the long game. They don't handle fatigue very well.
---
Hi everyone,
---
My battletag is Destroyer and I've been playing Hearthstone for 4.5 years now. I'm an established legend player and hit it every season I play now, and often end up getting to top legend somewhere during the season. These past 2 seasons I've been consistently top 100 after hitting legend, finishing #33 in December and #20-something last season on NA and am now starting to stream daily on [twitch.tv/destroyer\_\_hs](https://twitch.tv/destroyer__hs), around 10 P.M. to 1 A.M. (give or take) EST.  Come check it out!
---
I don't think you guys understand how profitable this game really is. They don't price the value of cards in dust over balance concerns, it's a business model. 
---
I lIkE tHoSe CaRd BaCkS. i ThInK i WiLl TaKe ThEm
---
My best arena moment was going 12-2 two times in a row both with warlock. It was when warlock got a card that costed 7 mana, was a 6/6 body and did 3 damage to all minions. Drafted both warlock runs about 3 or 4 of em.
---
I love how you just repeated what the post was saying...
---
This is genius
---
The amount of wasted potential for stuff like that in a DIGITAL card game is astounding to me really. Like why there's no public test server - all cards available, open a few hours a week so people don't just play that. You could even split it - 1/3 of the players get Mage/Priest/Warlock, 1/3 get Warrior/Hunter/Paladin, 1/3 get Shaman/Druid/Rogue to ensure all classes get played. Could even randomly assign a class each weekend or something and you've got say, 2hrs you can spread over the weekend (which is plenty for one to three classes and hopefully wouldn't take away from Blizzard's Smaug-esque pile of gold&amp;@@9√≤Ay0p0
---
You'd be able to cut mistakes made and missed by the playtesters and be able to test balance changes on a larger scale than is possible in house.
---
Let alone things like having 2 versions of a card - the only argument against which I can think of is that it's confusing for new players, which could be mitigated by wild needing 20 games played in standard or complete X levels of some single player game.
---
The only good taunt that I pulled was one lich King and one Tarem
---
Yep. I left hearthstone because i felt burnout with all the grind throught expansions. Is just a never ending story. I always had like 7 competitive decks but it was just too much. Feelsbadman
---
I miss Ben Brode.
---
&gt; and that‚Äôs with my boyfriend practically doing it for me!
---
Girls are terrible at card games, accept your limits.
---
I really liked ramp. I mean it's probably still possible but I don't think an entire play style should be nerfed over a blatantly op card like ui.
---
As someone who almost exclusively plays meme decks I agree. It really inhibits my ability to make fun home brew decks.
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1067
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/160
---
And instead of giving them interesting mechanics or a unique playstyle, they just gave them super fast minions and good card draw. Fucking ingenious.
---
The path to making hunter good shouldn't not be to just pump a fuck ton of value into their aggressive cards, because there's nothing to it. There's no combo they need to pull off, there's no major deck-building restriction they need to deal with, there's no avenue for me to counter their insane card-draw.
---
TLDR: 
---
"Those cards are gonna make the deck who play it weaker.
---
No we don't have valuable speculation in how would shape the meta."
---
Article is a complete waste of time. It's more captain obvious than comments on Hearthwpn on day 1.
---
Wait what deck are you looking at that costs that many legendaries? The best decks were odd paladin and odd rogue forever running just a copy of baku.. even warlock runs 2 legendaries,  what deck exactly are you talking about? 
---
Your own logic explains why you complaining right now is inappropriate.
---
I managed exactly one 12 win run, and that was before even GvG came out. It was a paladin deck with 2 tirions lol
---
hey man, don't dis the turn 10 dinomancy, +2/+2, dinomancy, +2/+2, preparation somehow, dinomancy, +2/+2
---
Duplicates are the real problem, in my opinion.
---
while it is tough to start as f2p it is satisfying when you finally can make medium cost decks.
---
just remember to not waste dust, do your dailies, always reroll for higher reward dailies, grinding arena with a tierlists(heartharena) is great for your "income". dont expect high rank finishes at the start. 
---
if you want to be competitive, better put some money. if you want to have fun you dont need to.
---
for starting out get the two free legendaries from the adventure and the new set. then open packs of expansion until you receive a legendary( you will always get one in the first ten packs). unless they are golden dont disenchant them. start building your collection by either grinding arena for RR packs. disenchanting extras and crafting commons or rares from the witch wood and boomsday set as and when needed(if netdecking). or by collecting the classic set only.
---
i repeat again dont waste dust on anything epic or higher unless you are absolutely sure(aka if the card is core to the strategy). try to make decks that have the WW BP and RR cards in them.
---
if you any more question do feel free to ask
---
Simpler version of Hearthstone? 
---
Isn't that just rolling dice to see who wins?
---
Great job! I've only got 2 wins the most
---
That's what I do, I open about 100 packs with gold and stop around that number when I hit the legendary and epic pity timers. I also track the golden common and rare pity timers but usually aren't a factor.
---
And here I was thinking it was a weird analogy for spiteful summoner lol
---
blizzard seems to
---
The decks legendaries arent exactly a waste since leeroy would be playable in any aggro or aggro-midrange deck. it could even show in damage based combos. and baku enables tons of ther decks that we can have in expansions to come
---
I feel the same as you. I spend $20 each expansion as a thank you for the time and with my saved gold I unpack 120-140 each expansion. 
---
I get more than enough dust to craft some popular decks. Do I have every single playable tier 1 deck?  No. But I have choices. 
---
Also don‚Äôt dust your dupe cards until absolutely necessary these days, I‚Äôve gotten dust rich by having multiple copies (gold too) of nerfed cards. 
---
TL:DR yeah it sucks i don‚Äôt have every epic possible which means there are decks I can‚Äôt play, but I have enough for 4-5 viable decks each expansion. It‚Äôs not that big of a problem. 
---
I think people just want to be able to own all cards without spending the money like streamers do. 
---
Just put that draw your lowest cost minion demon in my espionage rogue, best decision ever
---
Reynad or Firebat are actually the best at teaching the many mistakes you can avoid as they are concise and they will be the first to point out their mistakes.
---
You are correct. This is not the time for epics to be cheaper. 
---
Sincerely,
---
Blizzard Accounts Dept 
---
I'm sure blizzard values your opinion that's based on 0 market research and anecdotal evidence at best (if I believed that all of your friends quit because the cost of epic cards) as to how to run the game to the maximum profit. 
---
so big
---
***I *** *AM THE GREATEST DINOMANCER!*
---
TIL elementals are just a big pyramid scheme.
---
Experimentation is hard nowadays since the average cost of a competitive deck has risen sharply. I would argue that the 10-20 disenchant strategy gives people more ability to experiment within their price point since they know they will get full value back.
---
I think you misread or misunderstood what he was saying.  This mode would be severely limited to NOT be multiplayer at all, and perhaps other restrictions as well.  This would not have a meta, or grab every player that usually plays competitive because playing against the innkeeper is boring.  This would purely be a way to test deck synergy of how it draws to line up combos often enough, etc
---
If you are on EU you could add me into your friendlist and give me a decklist - then you could at least try some things out in friendly matches :)
---
Thought the criteria was shitting on blizzard.
---
A couple notes regarding my list:
---
- If you are seeing a lot of freeze mages, Time Out can be swapped in for Muster for Battle
---
- Careful not to let N‚ÄôZoth fill the board with 1/1s - that‚Äôs the one annoyance with this list
---
Sure, every deck can get lucky. But I think you understand my frustration when a shit deck beats me only because they get lucky.
---
When you play against a deck in the meta, you know most of the time their best plays at each mana slot, so you can play odds and make the best play you can to counter/play around/beat whatever they're doing at each mana slot.
---
But when it's a random off-meta deck that you've never seen before, you don't know what each mana slot can do. You don't know what to play around. And when they get really lucky, like what happens to me more than it should, then there's almost nothing you can do to beat it because your deck isn't set up to beat it.
---
No? so if you are a reno priest and your opponent is playing exodia mage, you're telling me that you will not need to dirty rat the antonidus to win assuming the mage isn't unlucky?
---
&gt;~20% of the legendaries.
---
More like 30%, although the point remains.
---
Everyone will get over it in a week. Can't wait for that.
---
The reason why people are complaning now is tied with blizzard's new nerfs methology, it feels awful to craft niche epic cards for a deck that will be nerfed into the ground in a few expansions or even after a few weeks, like what happend with king's bane rouge, shudderwock shaman, almost every druid archetype and now with this nerfs even shaman, and most control paladins, if they are going to keep nerfing powerful classic cards that are core to many decks they need to change something about the dust economy.
---
A few issues here:
---
1. How can you hate combo decks and the cards that beat combo decks, like what?
---
2. Keleseth, Flamewreath, and Thekal are nowhere near the power of Barnes which does need a nerf and do not cause an insta loss when played on curve, in fact ive even beat barnes into ysragg on 4 repeatedly so this entire argument is kinda just bad
---
3. Your list of cards that provide too much value just kinda confuses me, half of them aren't value at all, they are just strong tempo plays, such as spellstone, call to arms, and recruit cards, while the other half are just good control cards which based on what you said previously i dont get why you don't like them
---
so why don't you stop complaining about what you keep losing to and just play the game.
---
When Kibler started talking about a rotating classic set, I didn't know if this is what he meant exactly but surely for cards that are problematic in standard but NOT in Wild (that last bit being important, because if it's an issue full-stop then it needs to be nerfed), they could easily have the classic cards "rotate" if they believe that they are lightly to be abused in the current meta.   
---
Then when a new expansion hits they can come back in while other classic cards go out. The idea is that you have a constant conveyor belt of classic cards that are available or unavailable during the standard rotations, whilst all being available in Wild, forcing you to use different cards in the collection and different strategies because others won't be available.   
---
This way, they could also avoid one archetype being the meta (like OTK this time round) by removing some of the cards that allow it to happen, which would allow for a far more diverse and interesting gameplay 
---
Both of them aren't DK's?
---
Also, Malfurion may seem boring, but he is very interesting to play with because you're always making decisions
---
That's actually not true. Most fatigue decks have double dirty rat in wild. 
---
way ahead of you mate :)
---
I wanted to cry when they nerfed shuderwock with the saronite nerf. After crafting shudder,
---
Grumble, and many other combo pieces that really don‚Äôt work in any other deck. No compensation. 
---
I remember during boomsday I opened 3 copies of Holomancer and Dreampetal Florist.
---
Not being multiplayer at all makes everything I said irrelevant, my b.
---
Why would I play the mode where I had to pay for cards when I can just play the mode they're free in?
---
but just like all the classic card that got nerfed,eventually team 5 gonna release a card thats gonna broke a deck with a tirion in it and tirion is the one thats gonna get nerfed
---
Accept SaintPatrik and we can trade :)
---
I'd argue that lich king in evenlock is pretty standard at this point.
---
I guess I misinterpreted your post though. I read it as you saying that decks with a bunch of legendaries were a rare thing, but reading it back now I realise that's not what you were saying so that's my bad.
---
Those who play the game are great at pointing out problems in how it feels and plays, but tend to be terrible at properly diagnosing the core issues and suggestion solutions as to how to fix it, let alone implement them.
---
In this way, players are comparable to patients and Team 5 to medical doctors and other medical professionals. The latter asks the former how they feel as no one else can tell them, but the former just doesn't have the tools the latter has.
---
Because he's a petulant child who wants everything given to him for free
---
I think you're overestimating how compelling the "all cards mode" would be.  Without the competitive incentive to keep coming back the only reason to be in there would be experimentation.  Experimentation that would lead to a heightened desire to go on and obtain and use those cards in a more meaningful format.
---
As far as messing with the meta I don't think there is any danger for that, in much the way playing the Inn-Keeper isn't a real threat to the meta.  This mode would be a minor extension of that but much more niche in its application.  In fact it could be an official extension of that mode as a way to safely/gently introduce new players to the myriad options available to them in the full game without the punishment of losing to another player.
---
  To me "all cards mode" would satisfy two things HS is missing : 
---
1. A place where people can interact with cards not in their collection to see what they're missing out on. 
---
2. Create a safe place to experiment with card interactions without stakes. This to me is something HS desperately needs anyhow due to the amount of ambiguity in card text and the lack of explaination that Blizzard provides for them.
---
Providing a more accommodating and friendly user experience in my opinion would only be additive and in the end would only add to Blizz's bottom line not detract.
---
if development investment after earnings was proportional to revenue hearthstone would be more advanced than yugioh 3d duels in the fictional world of the anime/manga, it's pretty clear that they always intended to milk it since the beginning while trying to get away with as little as possible. iirc it wasn't even a "planned" major game, it just "happened" from a small dev team doing their thing that had managed to make something fun
---
Is Millhouse a meme? New on HS
---
Nope, I actually feel great. I quit playing Hearthstone about a month ago and I no longer have to deal with the bullshit randomness that is this game. The only part of Hearthstone still bothering me are the 4 posts made within the last 24 hours, targeting me.
---

That hyphen, though..,

Immune characters can't take damage and can't be targeted by an opponent. That's all it does. Destroy effects, freeze effects, and healing all work as long as they don't require dealing damage or targeting.
---
For everyone who hasn't hit 12 wins yet, how way total wins in arena do y'all have?
---
I should not say most players are in legend due to pure luck. It is a combination of high skill and a significant amount of luck.
---
There are over 10 million players playing dozens of games in each season.
---
I‚Äôll first point out that somebody always wins the lottery.  But this only happens because of the insane number of people that pick numbers.  If there were five people that participated in trying to win the lottery, it might be decades between having winners.  
---
There are over 10 million players.  Magine there is a combo deck that wins very early in the game, but is only drawn 20% of the time.
---
because there are 10 million players, it would be weird if a person using this deck would never make it to legend rank.  
---
His odds of getting to legend rank are much higher than anyone‚Äôs chance of winning the lottery, And somebody parentheses sometimes two or three and parentheses win the lottery against insane odds.
---
It would be strange if there were no people in legend rank that got there using a 20% win rate early game combo deck. 
---
The question is, what are the odds of this happening? If anyone that knows math is reading this, this would be a fun little project to settle a debate.
---
And I believe it is fact that it is likely people have made it to legend rank this way.
---
and you do have the opportunity, just not the exact turn you die. 
---
That'd make EMP Operative usable.
---
Yes, random is random. What's your point?
---
nice one,blizzard esport
---
Raza and patches are not close to be dead, both see play in wild
---
Secret paladin and even paladin are prob peak mid range paladin and tirion was broken in neither of those. N'zoth kinda brakes tirion and that wasn't that insane. Blessing of kings is more likely to become broken
---
Oh. It has been noticed, but hasn't been pointed out to use for about three months.

Yes, but only if Jaraxxus is summoned to the field by other means (Possed Lackey, Voidcaller, Bane of Doom) aside from playing him from your hand. If you become Jaraxxus, Guldan wont res him, but will res the 6/6's from the hero power.

It was under Ungoro, I was able to draft a singleton Mage with Pyros and doubel Kazakus. I think I won at least 2/3 of the games with Kazakus at 4 and Potion at 5.

well nobody saying that hex is broken but still got mana increase nerf
---
Literally everyone noticed it
---
I used to like the game and definetely had a good time with it but like others didn't like the increasing associated costs.  
---
Why do I complain? It's just a way of voicing my opinion in hope of changing things. Things would never move if nobody ever complains.
---
It was, but I quess not
---
Cloak is one of the best artifacts for every class, because you can just draft a low curve and go aggressive to beat them before they scale past you with their hero powers. Get a good curve early then mix in removal, win consistently on turn 7-8.
---
Is it played now in any decks?
---
It applies to HS leggos too. Actibli$$ know that meta decks will need certain leggos, and now the pity timer exists.
---
So they add ina bunch of shitty leggos like griftah so you lose your pity timer and need to spend cash on good leggos.
---
Genn and Baku are also extremely difficult to balance because of how simple and powerful their designs are. They've been problems since their release and I've yet to see any good ideas on how to properly nerf them.
---
Yikes.
---
I still prefer my way of solving a problem - taking actual action and not bitching about it on the internet.
---
You say you want to nerf fireball and frost bolt but you just made them perfect cards for an odd burn mage deck, and would probably make them more used than they currently are.
---
Been playing since TGT but I took multiple year long breaks so my collection isnt all that amazing. Now that I look back at it Im sad that I didnt craft rag and sylvanas for free when they were HOF'd. I thought I would never play wild so I dusted a bunch of wild legendaries that I regret to this day. Nowadays I pretty much only play wild and arena. And my collection is slowly growing again.
---
But why not just make less legendaries that are all good, and make the pity timer harder to get a legendary? 
---
Is it wrong that I always heard that as,"I am the courageous dinomancer!"?

and if you‚Äôre free to place it‚Äôs also not any fun cause you‚Äôll be stuck playing the same deck for months at a time. 
---
they desperately need change.

Thanks

That's Control Priest. Thought you were talking about Gallery Preist, which uses Mind Blast heavily to deal 40 damage with ease on turn 7/8, has then back up OTKs if that plan fails and if you can't OTK, Lyra will outvalue any deck.
---
Still Control Preist is just weaker than Malygos Druid in OTK strength as you run Alex.
---
Yes
---
4 losses, 77 wins r/477

Sad thing is most of these probably arent wrong. As a beta player thats been here for a long time, i hate whats happening to hearthstone, i really do. I want to believe theyre not doing all of this in the sake of profit, but its getting harder everyday to believe that. 
---
Meaning?
---
Essentially 7 out of the "survived ones" aren't playable in Wild anymore either man.
---
YAHARRR
---
At least you used the correct tag on your post.
---
You know, OC being Overused Catchphrase.
---
delete this nephew
---
The rumored 9th class of the game that people claim blizzard will release every expansion but never does
---
Hello! Hello! Hello!
---
They should delete Baku and Genn from the game. It is horrible how every single new card and how every single buff/nerf is dictated by these two cards. Blizzard make so many changes to give themselves "design space" yet they go ahead and release these cards.
---
Do you have a youtube channel where you make these?
---
After nerf would be no reason to run it, but now almost every class runnin' 1 cost spells. 
---
Good bot 
---
Fireball reduced to 2 mana but now is "Give a minion 'Takes 1 damage at the end of each turn'". 
---
2/2 frothing berserker has been deemed too difficult to remove and feels oppressive to play against. Frothing berserker is now 2/1
---
Haha true I literaly got 5 copies of this beast tamer guy (3 mana 3/4) and 1 this 0/2 armor thing. But eventually I got what I needed
---
Why do I feel like they are doing this for money and not to keep the game fresh. Standard Blizzard these days, let‚Äôs nerf all the classic cards so people have to buy more to stay relevant.
---
What [FeelingAirport](https://www.reddit.com/user/FeelingAirport) said. I know this interaction looks weird, but that's why explained it in the video at 8:55 :)
---
Nerf classic cards --&gt; Release basically essential cards in a new set --&gt; Profit.
---
However, they have taken steps to reduce the amount of Epic cards that are essential - when comparing last set to the few that came before it. 
---
But they don't need to make all the epics good. In fact, it's in their interest to only release a handful of powerful staples and to fill with tons of garbage.  
---
If there are no good epic, no one will actively seek them.  
---
If there are many, opening a bunch of packs will quickly give a playable combination meaning you are not in a rush to get more.  
---
If there are few, as it is now, you'll mostly open junk and if you get good cards, they will likely be across multiple classes, leaving you with half decks all over the place. So you'll have to either buy more packs or craft the missing cards. And with the ridiculously low rate of disenchanting cards, that's a lot of packs to spend on one card. 
---
reminds me of the time I randomly generated magma rager from menacing nimbus for lethal... the guy was like "good luck hitting legend with random cards"  like wtf? I'm a casual playing at rank 16 bro, as if I have time to hit legend.
---
Needs more twisting nether
---
I have no apology to accept as you didn't offend me. I'm just hoping that in the future you can be the better person in an exchange instead of lowering yourself down to someone else's level :)
---
All the best
---
I think prep at 3 mana might be more acceptable. At 2 mana you could still potentially have a 1 mana sap which is just a bit too strong 
---
Wow, that's a lot of dmg
---
Yep 103 as rogue and like 140 as druid
---
 
---
The rage on druid was palpable because I can't stand playing druid already
---
Mossy is useful, not against plagues, but it can make beast hunter quite bad day. 
---
At this point I‚Äôm past waiting for blizz to fix any issues it has with its current games and just looking forward to the next great game they are going to slowly ruin...
