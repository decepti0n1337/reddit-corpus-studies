I opened a ton of Frozen Thrones packs to try and get a good legendary before the rotation. Took 29/40 packs, but I got The Lich King just now! Better late to the party than never

how do i upvote multiple times?

Voodoo Doll was assassinate for Mage.  Sometimes with a Water Elemental.
---
Mage hero power gives an inherent advantage over priest. Priests first 4 turns with no cleric are pass, heal pass, heal pass, heal pass

---
That‚Äôs right of course, maybe you can‚Äôt call it countered. But it takes away a lot of its power, so let me call it easy to play around.
---
Wow
---
What even are these seemingly magical muck creatures that follow shaman
---
keep your garbage game, this is the last expansion I spend money on this game.
---
Why did you say that?! Now I had to watch it looking for a blink. My eyes started to get dry watching him talk!! WTH
---
Grats
---
Well, as with most anything else, it‚Äôs a mix of skill, luck, and time commitment.  There are millions of HS players, and *average* player is probably not skilled enough to make it to legend regardless of time commitment, but I do believe that the average player who makes it past rank ~15 / 10 could make legend with a large enough time commitment 
---
I guess they're thinking in some kind of hearthstone perspective? IDK. But the guy above me was talking about math classes...oh well
---
If you paid close attention to the story you'd realise that she wasn't raped at all. She told that story so that guy would get off her back because she knew that would satisfy the guy and would stop him from asking further questions. The real reason it's called sonnie's edge is because the edge is that sonnie is actually the monster, not the girl. That's why she didn't die when her skull got crushed. When the fight starts you actually see her turn off the affinity link instead of turning it on.
---
I, for one, welcome our new shaman arena overlords.
---
And it's all about Paladin's *little* secrets.
---
No, she is 4 and he is 13
---
Oh... My worst nightmare secret paladin
---
Haha thank you and sorry!!
---
Can I upvote this twice?
---
Finding a true heartstone is even harder than finding a true heart.
---
don't we all *sigh*
---
She is 13 and he considers her a 4
---
I‚Äôm sure the person I responded to was including how many you could include in a deck /s
---
How has the game been overall since around the time of brode's departure? Wasn't a fan of the game anymore with him at the helm. Any changes for the better, or for the worse?
---
Why would a fountain have lifesteal, rush, or windfury? I might understand restoring waters and being a shaman card so lifesteal and windfury but a fountain having rush?
---
F
---
Ooft. I always consider this but I almost get sentimental. Thanks for the suggestion though. 
---
Paralyzed fountain
---
Karazhan is derided as the worst of the classic adventure packs. "One Night in Development" stuck for a reason (mainly because the second floor bosses were all repackaged tavern brawls).
---
Fair enough. Haha 
---
You are the best person.
---
You have another week to have that last hand 
---
What? He definitely solved it, you know Toast, always finding a new meta
---
There is no damn way Ben Brode found half of what he's laughed at over the years funny.
---
He did that one well, yes. His awkwardness worked there.
---
I am familiar with this combo.
---
She‚Äôs cute! Lucky u OP!!
---
I find rush to be the least confusing keyword, it's been imbued with energy to live and fight so it tears out of the ground and rushes into the battle.
---
So you can say yes now and say no to someone else

---
2. Would you like to go to prom with me? 
---
Both got yesses and didn't cost me anything. 
---
Battlecry draw a card would be decent and not OP at all. This card does nothing on turn 8 or for  8 mana. 
---
Sooo... [[Ice lance]] ? 
---
Alright dude, let me tell you. Just because you aren‚Äôt able to understand what I am saying doesn‚Äôt make me the idiot here.
---
I will try a final time:
---
The comparisons obviously are a lower power level, that‚Äôs not the point though. The point is that the whole mechanic isn‚Äôt that strong as these cards very clearly show. 
---
Also, I am not going in circles pointlessly pointing out how there are decks this effect sucks again, I just mentioned it once and for some reason you felt the need to readress that every single time although there shouldn‚Äôt be much to argue here. What I was doing in the following was trying to tell you that this point simply stands and affects the powerlevel quite a bit, no matter how obvious that is. Btw it aren‚Äôt just extreme cases like Freeze mage that can be fine not playing minions for a few turns, many slow decks can do that against other slow decks.
---
You don‚Äôt know what deck you will face on ladder, so it‚Äôs super relevant how well the card does against any deck type. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt have to be favored in every single matchup, but you can‚Äôt just disregard the weaknesses completely.
---
Get well soon, my condolences

1/-/- | Freeze a character. If it was already Frozen, deal 4 damage instead.

We're obviously talking about dire mole lol???
---
Sweet do you have any links or sources i want to rry these
---
This would be broken in Arena if it also affects minions. Imagine playing this with cards like Wardruid Loti, Druid of the Claw, Druid of the Scythe, or Shellshifter. Yikes!
---
Face is ALWAYS the place ü§§
---
Personally I don‚Äôt like being handed wins, I‚Äôd rather just earn it, but I have no problem with people who like doing it. The only time I‚Äôve done it is on the last day of ladder at legend against a rank 1, anything else seems almost patronizing at least imo

It is completely a buzzword otherwise it would actually learn.

This is static algorithms and thus no learning involved.

Why the fuck didnt they put maly in the hall of fame
---
Anna tribe synergy is getting out of hand
---
I kind of like RNG spell generation as part of the identity. The class is a lot more interesting if Mages cast morr than the same three spells every game.
---
Big drawback though
---
True unity
---
You can have Cosmic Anomaly and Celestial Emissary as elementals in your deck.
---
So you can also combo Khadgar + Elemental Evocation + CA or CE + Unexpected Results (6 or 8 mana cost resulting 4 4-mana minions + Khadgar)
---
Or just for the spell damage effect + plus any damage spell.

We know how many lackeys there are. There‚Äôs one for each villain. They‚Äôre all up on the expansion website. We don‚Äôt know how many cards there are that generate them, that is true. We DO know from the livestream that there‚Äôs only one neutral generator. So yeah, OP‚Äôs idea seems basically impossible. I kind of doubt Shaman is getting another generator beyond the Murloc. 
---
Except only able to come out on turns 8+ unless you cheat it out. That means this isn‚Äôt going to help with clearing boards on earlier turns like you could possibly with tidal surge.

Yes, any generation from golden cards will be golden

Same... because my opponent ran a zoo deck, which I obliterated with my deathrattle hunter. ;)
---
I knew that they had announced only 1 per villain, but I missed that they said that would be it as far as the lackeys are concerned. I guess that makes the most sense though.
---
Probably just another Kobold
---
Whos ready for a lot of fake card reveals since this passes over April first?
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
He made a comment just to say he upvoted.
---
There's no need for that. Votes speak for themselves.
---
I mean. It is risky in the sense that it could be a dead draw, but that goes for most hate cards. Obviously if you're facing a Priest and can't rule out them being Big Priest, you don't play this.
---
Adapt
---
Just demonstrably wrong. They're far far more alike than they are different.  
---
Functionally, Divine Shield is almost identical to Health as a mechanic. Lifesteal operates in a very similar design space as Taunt. And Rush is a direct subset of Charge. 
---
Al'Akir is almost always used to trade, even before the Flametongue nerf. Part of that is to squeeze the most of the Divine Shield, which on average equates to ~3 health worth of value. And Lifesteal is pseudo-Taunt, if not better. 
---
The discernible difference is this has 1 extra attack, potential to generate infinite value, and saves you health based on its own damage rather than the attack of the minions you're removing. Not to mention it costs 1/40th the price to craft. Blizzard did not hold back with this card. It's close to strictly better than Al'Akir as a defensive tool, and curve decks don't tend to run more than one *maybe* two 8-drops. 
---
So I drafted Arena deck (on Android), hit the play button and the game didn't even start when I got the 'you lost the game due to disconnect' message. I don't want to start another game as I've had other disconnects in casual and seen others mentioning similar problem. Has Blizzard made any announcement about fixing the problem yet?
---
Wait was it actually you? That‚Äôs wack
---
Hopefully Rakanishu will be playable. Loved the lil' guy.
---
That's hysterical! 
---
/r/nocontext
---
I want to know this too. Like that time the Blackrock Orcs kidnapped Alexstraza to increase their Dragon army.
---
If he plays wild. Wandering is rotating.
---
Not that I‚Äôve seen :( it‚Äôs just super disappointing to lose when you‚Äôre doing well. 
---
Priests? Here, have this 3 mana 3/2 that lets you pick one of three cards in your opponent's hand. Also it's Legendary for some reason.
---
Mages? LOL 2 mana 2/2 with tribal synergy and fill your hand with spells. Also you can run 2 of them. It's not like Mage has the best class spells in the game, right?
---
Just sucks that it‚Äôs going to wild
---
Lmao that's funny, I saw this before that reply, though.
---
10 is highest for me lol. i just doesn't like grinding and playing meta decks
---
Boomsday trailer best trailer 
---
You're not wrong, 30 damage is not lethal when your opponent have literally ten thousand armor

so, infinite upvotes?

That might of been me. I apologize for I was trying to complete a daily quest and disregarded any dignity I had for 50 gold.

4 Attack? Priests hate her!

With subject 9 hunter u can beat half of top tier decks(cause half of them are aggro)

Yes very big brain, no one smarter than Toast

tho

Extra points if you play the quest and the legendary that adds a copy of your opening hand. Triple turn mage is my favorite deck

And they don't have healthcare...

There's always Subject 9.

Most of us have seen so much of this pseudo-scam at this point that it's very easy to spot.  But **just in case there's someone here who doesn't know what this is please don't spend any of your hard earned money on this link**.  What this person is doing is called drop shipping, basically they're an extra lazy middleman who doesn't make, handle, or even have an inventory with the products they sell through their store.  They find someone else selling something, make a fake store where they claim to be selling that item and mark up the price, and when you buy from them they have a bot which will buy the item for you from the original vendor after pocketing the mark up.  Drop shippers often source items manufactured by bootleggers, which means that not only are they trying to rip you off by profiting from a transaction which they haven't done a single thing to add value to, but they're often selling merch that features stolen fanart, so if you buy from them your purchase does nothing to support the creators who actually worked to make the things you want to support.  
---
Posts formatted like this one are a very popular guerilla marketing tactic that drop shippers use to try and trick people into buying their merch on reddit.  The OP will post a shirt and either look for or create an opportunity to post a link to a store in the comments where you can buy the shirt.  In this case they probably made their opportunity, as u/Impressive_Play is an account made 2 days ago, which incidentally is the exact same day that OP, u/CreepyCommand6, made their account.  And both accounts have no posting history except on this thread.  
---
One of the easiest ways to confirm that you have a drop shipper on your hands is to scroll to the bottom of the website they link to.  Drop shippers almost universally host their fake stores on one of two store hosting platforms, either Shopify or GearLaunch, and if you scroll to the bottom of their websites you can find branding for the platform that hosts them.  This particular drop shipping website is hosted by Shopify.  
---
For legal reasons I can't tell you 100% that this is what this person is doing.  What I can tell you is that I've seen a lot of these, and that this shows most of the classic signs of a drop ship operation.  And I can tell you that there is no way that I would spend my money on this site.  You work hard for your money too, and I would encourage you not to spend it here, if you do you're probably getting ripped off.  
---
ancient of war, choose +5 attack, easy :p 
---
Well crafting golden rotating commons and dust them later gives you a profit of 10 dust per common 
---
Dont need to block out the name as they still have a BattleNet # associated with it.
---
Do you know how much larger the reward is?
---
*oops :)))
---
**Play 20 Hunter cards**
---
*and they told me Spell hunter would die after KnC rotated*
---
priests took a turn for the worst when anduin was released. they've just been degenerate as hell. psychic scream and shadow visions were just waiting for one card to come out to fulfil the E.V.I.L in them.
---
such a far cry from their precious upbringings, where turn 3 mana 4/7 was their biggest play, and they played for value.
---
Oh, so that's why Doomguard is getting sent to wild.
---
Mage quest with only Elise as a source of random spells. You can get more packs with Elekk.
---
He's cool but his Twitter feed is annoying. WAY too many political posts...
---
Lots of players are "text literalists" and complain about the most trivial semantics. If you reads posts in this sub, I'd say 5-10% are complaints about card wordings.
---
it shows in the screenshot. 50-&gt;5 took 13 hours and 5-&gt;legend took 5 hours.
---
i tried so hard to pull off boomzooka with stitched archers or whatever they were called, and big beasts. so close...

All the time in wild and the end of last year standard during mammoth. Before cubelock took over. Which reminds me, fuck warlock too
---
My father has spent more money in Candy Crush than I have on Hearthstone, and I have a nearly complete Standard collection (missing about 4-5 epics). 
---
It may be more fun, but damn is it just as addictive.
---
Two eyes for an eye
---
One muckmorpher.
---
Yes, we should all play vanilla Chillwind Yeti decks again. 
---
It‚Äôs way overcosted. Dread Lord and Dirty Rat were already highly situational tech cards you would only put into incredibly specific decks in specific metas.
---
And the only reason they were even remotely playable was combo‚Äôing them with hard removal to remove combo threats, because even against aggro they were pretty bad.
---
This card is basically unplayable. 
---
wow an all gold deck!!!
---
A least they won‚Äôt Shield up anymore 
---
It was the card back for May 2016 ranked play chest
---
You have to pay $49.99 for the Rise of Shadows preorder!
---
Its only in 50‚Ç¨ bundle ?
---
5 mana 3/2 
---
Battlecry: summon two 2/2 minions
---
If you need to ask someone for their opinion on whether you should buy the bundle then you clearly aren't invested enough on this game in the first place.
---
Ok but really your comment went from +25 to -6 after my counter-snark comment. Hive mind dude. Group psychology is dumb.
---
To op pls nerf
---
How am I not even aware that classes are divided into villains and defenders?
---
Almost? It'd give them layers of shields. Perhaps you would have to ping a unit twice to get rid of it. The difference being that they are targetable.
---
Disenchant your collection and spread lamb's blood on your screen
---
I've only seen it mentioned indirectly. Idk if it was ever said in any of the announcement biz.
---
I dont think you are right. I already have 80‚Ç¨ preorder and at official website states that its same card back for 50 and 80 bundle. Source : https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22911364
---
WE are gonna see someone play gonk, attack into double get down, getting 2 extra attacks, which is enough to kill the paladin
---
"Those spells aren't magical" seems like a pretty hard-sell to me.
---
You totally right. If Blizzard reveals 2 ou 3 more Shaman spells that generate minions, this Malygos combo could be a thing. 
---
But this is more a Hunter mechanic so I guess Maly Sham won‚Äôt dominate the ladder 
---
When I first heard about the neutral Lackey generator, I actually wondered if they brought back the "tri-class" system, but for the two factions instead. 
---
The mage probably knew they had lost; with only meteor and a topdeck there's pretty much nothing that would save him (apart from huge taunts or deathwing). 
---
Don't be a dick
---
I would if I could.
---
And Cthun.
---
I‚Äôd dust the shit out of those.
---
Quest mage was tier 3/4 after Druid. The only reason Quest was played is the meta was so warped in favor of druid, even being slightly favord against it was enough to be playable. Ice Block was rotated for fan-boy points, not out of an neccasity. 
---
Also a handful of Iceblocks is overrated. It clogs up hand, and anything past 4 (and usally 3) is  pointless cause fatigue.
---
Puzzle with the card inside, see trumps video
---
Fair point actually, which just makes it weirder that OP was so smug about it.
---
tehvik#2322 EU 80g quest trade. You challenge first.
---
What?
---
How would it work with time out then? lol
---
Surely this could do with at least Overload 1.
---
WELL PLAYED!
---
Cute girl, mind if I take her? Lmao, just kidding, but haha she is beautiful omg would love to snatch her right up lmao ;)
---
Message me if you're up for some "snatching" like lmao ok I'll pay her good lmao :)
---
&gt;4/13 for &lt;3 mana? Jesus, talk about power creep. Wtf Blizzard? 
---
Haha, damn, you're so funny? Where did you learn to be so fucking hilarious?
---
Imao definetely not. We already have new togwaggle legendary card which gives us a treasure (I guess you have not seen it) so why to print a similar card but with a different mana cost and stats? 
---
Teaspionage decks tend to win around 40% but are really fun to play.  I would strengthen your early game so you live long enough to get Espionage cards.  
---
Drop both shadowsteps as they are only valuable if you have good bounce cards like Prince, Vikespine and Tess.  Ditch the Pick Pocket and Shiv as they lose too much tempo.  Look at SI:7 Agent, Henchclan Thug or Fel Strider to help early tempo.
---
I don't know, with Thekal, Paladin can basically tank up to 60 hp.. then there is shirvallah of course, the 8/8 taunts when you healed enough.. and don't forget the 2 drop that you shuffle in your deck when it dies.. with redemption you can even get more copies of that guy and silence might not work then.. I feel there is Paladin builds with endless resources, fatiguing every opponent! This might be 30min games average.. 
---
Because Keleseth is rotating out...
---
just please no, no another "tempo" mage.. 
---
That is exactly what makes a card good.
---
Naturalize died for this.
---
While Paladin is getting support against aggro (kinda the only relevant tools in HS), Priest is getting more dr support (without any good dr or any payoffs whatsoever). What is this thing transforming into?. Yet is another 2 drop that you feel bad playing on tempo. Priest is getting really crappy cards, not even a new aoe to replace PS. I don't get why blizzard always kill priests at the begining of each rotation, while keeps supporting Rogue. I think this is my call off for this game, i'm just tired of the bias..
---
To clarify, if they had 30 health and 1 armor, they'd end up with 1 health left
---
While that‚Äôs true, I think Dirty Rat presents more of an opportunity to be outvalued if it pulls a big enough minion.
---
With this card lots of valuable combo pieces like Bloodbloom, Preparation, Moonfire and Holy Wrath are almost useless if cast by this minions Battlecry.
---
Lets look at current/recent combo decks and compare.
---
In no particular order:
---
Paladin: Holy wrath/exodia DK. Against exodia DK hecklebot is straight up better since this one does nothing against the combo itself, against Holy Wrath this card is a whole lot better since you can just wait until their deck is empty for bigger chances of combo disruption
---
Priest: Hecklebot is useless unless you are a mage or a shaman, and if you are either by the time you can heckle+polymorph they might have already cheated out and killed a token. This card could force spellstones before theres anything to revive, make shadow visions choose not-great options, and turn mind blast into "deal 5" instead of "deal 40". Can also waste divine spirits and inner fires.
---
Mage: uh... quest mage I guess? Hecklebot has to hit Tony or Apprentice among the entire deck, this one has to hit quest among however may spells are in hand (wait, how would the extra turn work here?)
---
Rogue: Malygos rogue. Hecklebot cant be played on curve or else you WILL die to a bunch of cheap spells, Malygos is likely already in hand by turn 6. This card can hit a necrium vial, at least. Not reliable, but Id say its at least as good (or bad) as.
---
Shaman: pre nerf shudderwock. Spells arent really part of the combo. Short of trying to mill them by force casting far sight on a full hand, the most this could do is force cast volcano or healing rain at bad times (at least volcano would overload them I think...?). Hecklebot works better by default, but I dont think its great against the combo itself, since the deck has 15 minions total.
---
On maly shaman: havent really seen many, so I have no idea how many spells or minions they run, and how much they telegraph their combo. If its obvious when they have their combo in hand and by that point there are less spells in hand than minions in deck, this is better to mill Eureka or at least some damage, otherwise not.
---
warlock: Hecklebot is a lot more likely to thin their deck than hit a combo piece. If you can pressure them into using their defiles and spellstones, you make it a lot easier to hit cataclysm or bloodboom.
---
Druids: Against mechathun, heckle is a dice roll,  this one ensures no nat or innervate. Against toggalina, this one can only *try* to force ramson use, before they do the same to you, so hecklebot is better here.
---
Hunter: lol
---
Warrior: there are 3 combo piece spells, and two combo piece minions. You can guarantee hit one of the spells by just waiting for their hand and deck to empty out. You can not guarantee hit the minions.
---
its surprise reno in dragon warrior sometimes lol
---
here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-AfiutrL1w
---
No, but that card also sux
---
Damn talk about effort for a boy.
---
I like both of them but they have pretty different styles. Ben Brode was acting a bit but he was still behaving like a presentator who was there to show new cards. Dave is really 100% acting and once in a while he just finds cards out of nowhere to show to the audience.
---
But when I watch the others, especially Peter Whalen, I feel like I'm just watching a happy narrator who keeps the same facial expression for the entire video and who just focuses on the tone of his delivery but who's not really acting and interacting with his environment. So for me it's not really that entertaining to watch even if I can see the enthusiasm. I know acting isn't easy but I feel like they don't really try because they're afraid of the comparison with Dave/Ben Brode.

Lore Walker Cho wet dream.

Last year they revelaed Deadly Arsenal and it turned out to be a joke card so why not? 
---
I have a hunch Paladin are going to get a minion that has the ability
---
"While this is alive, your opponent cannot gain health"
---
This leads to this card being a reno with a 2 turn setup
---
Even if such a card doesn't exist I can see this being used in a control paladin with alexstraza 
---
Was there a vote to elect you as the representative for all Rouge players? I apparently missed it. 
---
great job!  I know arena is tough
---
I forgot, are there supposed to be three or four?
---
Cataclysm rotates...
---
I have both 
---
Prediction: Pyroblast casting to your own face in Trolden.
---
Nice! 
---
Good thing you kept Fandral in hand! XD
---
This will be played agaisnt a paladin. paladin cast holy wrath to himself and and otk himself 
---
*Opponent casts his/her Cloning Gallery on 6*
---
Me, without removal in hand: *Pikachu meme*
---
For 1year and a half the devs were like: "2 mana 2/2, is it better than Keleseth? nope, ok let's keep it for later".
---
And now we get the result of 1year and a half of ideas at once.
---
I like how this expansion (in standart for 2 years remind you) they seem to want to give us counters for all sorts of combo decks if someone ever was to come up with oppresive combo decks that would ruin the ladder experience. We have a card against minion based combo, against spell combo and against face burn combo. I also like how none of those are binary cards that read "immediatly win the game if opponent plays the combo deck". Anti-spell and anti-minion cards work on pulling one opponents card (which comes with a lot of interesting dance with the opponent should both players expect what is coming) and the anti-burn card just stalls for a turn.  
---
Great design! Also, great for wild!
---
Hope become the legendary herocard for mage!!!
---
it's still a good card off kalecgos, you can use the free spell cast on a card that was already in your hand anyway
---
In combo with [High Priest Thekal]
---
Cairne, cough, cough....
---
Yes. And as it turns out, that isn't always punished, because people can ignore these things in the right context.
---
If you're talking about the upgraded hero power, its Tank Up
---
After a year of drought we are blessed with all these new combo disruption cards.
---
Opponent wariror presses hero power &gt; OP *shocked*
---
*opponent clears aucheni and violet illusionists*
---
Behold, the duality of man
---
90% of the time you are getting fucked, but that 10%, that's where the good stuff is
---
Deathwing is not in the deck. Boomship decks saw a little bit experimentation but were deemed as not strong enough.
---
Why would a deck that's main gameplan is completely different (playing a more value oriented midrange/tempo game) include doomship in a deck were it only has a few activators.
---
If you roll into Deathwing, you say fine maybe I don't play this card and keep him as a backup plan.
---
But you don't dilute your deck with a 9 drop that doesn't have great synergy with the main plan of your deck. (you need to highroll and have drawn Ysera to make it worth), especially when you first concern is probably getting dragon synergy, and your next concern is getting the board early.
---
Year of the Reprints
---
It is just sad that it only deathrattle. It guess would be too strong with Jepetto. I imagine 4 mana 2 malygos and a velen. 
---
So... Double loot hoarder?
---
His Flav text better be "He puts the "We" in We're going to be rich"
---
Got golden zuljin as mine. 
---
YOU TRIED TO MAKE RECRUIT WARRIOR A THJNG WHY IS THIS A PALADIN CARD
---
That only makes sense if you play hakkar close to or at fatigue which is impossible with this card.
---
Ok. And only rogue and neutral cards, other classes are not included right?
---
Thekal is pretty fun in wild, with molten giants. Coin + Thekal + giant on turn 2 won me quite a few games... and also got me some very angry friend requests
---
So I am only allowed to play combo or aggro? Awesome meta ! 
---
What are you, 11? Cringe...
---
+10 damage
---
Fireballing a random target often ends up being a fifty/fifty hitting an enemy or ally
---
Learning internet trivia makes me happy
---
Cool card
---
So they make it epic
---
What does that mean?
---
Kripp will either know who she is from WoW or hear her female voice and still call her a he forever
---
6 mana 5/6, your opponent resurrects 3 minions  
---
it could be good if you can force the rezz early with only 1 thing in the pool, but even in that case it's still tempo for the opponent
---
Tree of life is crying
---
Ehhhhh wut??
---
Surprise Priest steal, ties game
---
Ahh you caught me
---
I with all these distuption where like it and zihi and not like rat. Pull right autowin dont likly Loose. Zihi and jeweler are lot better design then rat type
---
All I see is an ape opening a coconut
---
If they shielded up, they might in red alert.
---
Now i'm hyped again, they are giving other classes combo disruption.
---
Control is back on the menu, thank you blizzard!
---
My man Gruul, right there with the best of 'em
---
Divine Favor Pally would want to have a word with you but jokes aside other there has been an aggro-esque deck that can Outlast you like Prenerf Subject 9 Hunter and that deck is good without dk rexxar as long as you have ZulJin and that 4 Mana shuffle beasts into your deck 
---
Well, this is absolutely garbage for Arena 
---
Sadly theyre rat type instead of jeweler and zihi 
---
It doesn't seem that bad. Has synergy with alexstraza and the new dragon buff card. Just play some big buffed dragon's and put a lot of late game pressure on board 
---
no one give a fuck except you fanboys
---
Yes that would be the dwarven women
---
at least it is gameplay
---
The hell? I can't read the language of the Old Gods...
---
NozaReno
---
That isn't even nearly the same comparison since casual follows the same deck building rules as standard
---
Done!!!
---
Thekal value
---
No, it's not a dumb idea. Watch Firebats clips on YouTube, he is playing Hakkar Paladin and he always waits several rounds to fill his deck and to avoid fatigue in the end. Then he plays Liam.
---
It really depends on the matchup plus Control Paladin can easily stall and survive. 
---
And for hooktusk
---
Blizzard said Recruit mechanic exclusive for C&amp;C. So they just didn‚Äôt use that word lol
---
The cards presented in a Discover selection are selected from a pool of all eligible neutral and class cards matching the player's current class.
---
Nice to see someone putting respect on kalimos' name
---
the way it's meant to be played
---
Tirion, Dragons, Shirvallah, are good enough. You don't necessarily have to finish OTK decks fast when you can disrupt combos.
---
Imagine if it were an ‚Äúat the end of your turn‚Äù, wasted potential.
---
Spiderbomb. 
---
1. No
---
2. Depends on what you want/how much dust you have
---
Keep in mind it's more of a guideline, than an actual rule. Treachery + Howlfiend used to show up in fringe Warlock builds to completely obliterate your opponent's hand. 
---
A better example in a different game is the Trix combo from Magic: the Gathering. You would take two terrible cards in Donate (basically Treachery) and Illusions of Grandeur (4 mana gain 20 life, effectively doubling your starting health total. But you had to pay 2 mana times the number of turns it was in play, every turn, your it would die and you would lose the bonus health), and combine them in a lethal combination that outright killed most opponents.
---
Generally speaking, it's a good idea to not play bad cards. Rarely though, they can be more than the sum of their parts.
---
They're switching it up this year. Instead of front-loading the rewards in the lead-up, they're giving them out after the set launches, probably similar to [how they did with Old Gods](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4fu2fc/ben_brode_just_confirmed_on_release_day_you_will/).
---
From the press fact sheet:
---
Starting April 5, just before Pre-Release, players can simply login to claim the free Legendary card and begin using it immediately in Play Mode and at Pre-Release events. At launch, a quest chain will become available that rewards multiple card packs for the Rise of Shadows and Year of the Raven expansions.
---
Is it really that hard to use a simple af search bar. Or scroll down literally 10 seconds since this gets reposted at least every hour for weeks now!
---
Jesus even my great grandma probably knows about this bug by now ffs... 
---
Artwork replaced you mean. Maybe that's why we're getting stuff like "Horny Elven Archer" and the artwork is a glass of milk.
---
then you lack any sort of creativity. This card is clearly playable in control paladin.
---
This comment is homosexual.
---
it's in paladin because many paladin minions have divine shield which makes this card very valuable instead of just rng
---
The more I look at it, the more I want to cry *:`(*
---
Well, you can force the odds in your favor. If you know the opponent runs bilateral board clear and no buffs, playing this as your only minion can be huge tempo. Inversely, playing this as a 4th+ minion against a class with a lot of buffs won't give them tempo.
---
The opponent also loses the benefits of Choose One, Echo, temporary discounts (Prep), and extra mana (Coin) for instance.
---
Overall, I'd say it's a great card against Rogue, decent into Hunter,  Paladin,  Druid, Priest, Warrior and Warlock, and a no go into Shaman and Mage.
---
maybe divine shield paladin
---
You used an extreme, disingenuous example. The idea that a low legend player piloting a tier 1 deck could *consistently, easily* beat the best player piloting midrange hunter is almost certainly false.
---
Nobody would be stupid enough to argue that there aren't tier 1 decks that are expensive+easier to pilot than budget decks. They're tier 1 for a reason, and the dust costs are an objective fact. But the existence of viable tier 2 legendary-less budget archetypes like [midrange hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;excludedCards=43398&amp;archetypes=137&amp;sortBy=winrate) and [zoolock](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=WARLOCK&amp;archetypes=134&amp;sortBy=winrate&amp;excludedCards=49423%2C45340) clearly show that dust value isn't all that important. And it's possible (with effort) to craft at least *one* legendary as an f2p player, which is enough for a solid [odd paladin deck](https://hsreplay.net/decks/CYx3kYE8uGWvAnYMhq593c/), probably the current go-to example of a "braindead" tier 1 archetype. So the argument that there are *some* strong decks which happen to cost a lot of dust doesn't hold up to the facts that there are plenty of relatively inexpensive strong decks.
---
thankfully wild tends to be pretty cool, even laddering. It's more the exception at the lower ranks to find tier 1 decks than the rule.
---
Which I can't say at all for standard &gt;.&gt; even in casual
---
turn all healing into dmg please
---
we dont talk about those guys around here
---
Hoovy Paladin incoming
---
So you say fringe play in a non competitive deck that exists because it's funny to play makes a card good?
---
Nothing about elitist thinking but just from pure card rating
---
It‚Äôs likely a Zihi style thing where timing is crucial. I wouldn‚Äôt just rip jeweler into an empty board, but it would be pretty great to snag the last topsy on a bad target. I‚Äôm interested in using it as anti control, forces them to play their removal-literally!
---
that should be a game mode
---
To be honest 80 of the time this is the way to play around Hunter Secrets, SMOrc and go.
---
That's not a lotta damage. We need a LOTTA DAMAGE
---
Look at the examples OP gave. The new monkey doesn't look like monkey. The new Reno doesn't look like Reno. The new Sylvanas doesn't need to look like Sylvanas. To me the art looks like someone standing behind the undead and controlling her mind.
---
And I don't know much about monks. What monk hat looks like that?
---
Nah they mostly just die off.
---
Gallery priest is the only pseudo combo deck in wild being played at any serious number of games. Any other combo deck is like the 4th played deck for their class, at most.
---
The "Me vs the guy who she tells me to not worry about"-Memes for Stormwatcher will come soon.
---
It even can rival Al'Akir easily. +1 Attack, +3 Health and Lifesteal vs Divine Shield and Taunt.
---
Or Zilliax... ok it is 3 Mana more but you get +1 Attack, + 6 Health and Windfury vs Divine Shield and Taunt. 
---
I wonder if they forgot to at least add some overload on it?!
---
How are you cheating out Maly and activating those deathrattles? Needing to have something like Reckless Experimenter and Malygos out at the same time doesn't really sound consistent enough to really be viable.
---
Combo disruption is fine if it's not a pure liability in the other matchups on the ladder
---
just because you don't understand the counterplay to combo doesn't mean it has none
---
I'll have to see what other deathrattles they come out with, but this is ok. 2/2/2 is fine, and it can copy a strong dr. Against other priests, definitely going to have to watch out cause of csp, but yeah, ok card
---
Try it then 
---
Swamp Dragon. I am your father.
---
That's exactly what most of us want. Combo is garbage solitaire.
---
more random shit...
---
Have you ever played uther of the ebon blade? This card accomplishes that same role, there are many times after turn 9 that you need healing and this card provides it, obviously this is a control card not even a midrange deck, the other sinergies with thekal and others are just bonuses. In fact I think this cards would be good in any control paladin even without any dragons. 
---
and seems you haven't seen resurrect priest yet :)
---
:o
---
Have u checked out the most recent cards?, there are 2 anti-combo cards  so far, one is a minion counter, and the other is a spell counter. combo decks will take huge huge hit
---
&gt; actually that'd probably be a fun meta.
---
Yeah shamanstone was definitely really beloved around these parts.
---
If you go the website snoppsnoo , you can see the distribution , consistent yes but from that graph you can see around certain time :p. 
---
I'm on phone now so it's difficult to link a recent one, but i will edit it later, this is from the last year.

---
It's the return of Tree of Life, in Paladin when Druid also gets small Heal theme. I like it better in Paladin, though, it's the more established massive heal class. So, it's one more mana than Tree of Life, so even slower, but Tree of Life wasn't normally a turn 9 play, most of the time. It also has a body, which has some implications, like providing board presence, being bounceable and providing a dragon to hold onto for dragon synergies. It's an interesting card for Control Paladin and Healadin, even though the latter never quite became an established archetype, and the former lacks a win condition outside of Shirvallah Holy Wrath OTK.
---
 I would love to see that comeback. I also play a lot of priest tbh. 
---
Not even half of the cards are released and we have a full expansion rotation...relax...
---
Frozen Cone joke
---
thanks :)
---
Copy this minion and BAM, might even be a very viable strategy.
---
Battlecry: she will suck your dick
---
Is it some sort of pun? It is not even a water elemental
---
I only played Tree of Life in two types of decks - Bolf Auchenai Tree of Life tavern brawl deck where minions gave you spells of the same cost for free. And as a one of in a taunt heavy control druid quite some time ago. 
---
In the first case like you said it didn't matter, since Bolf still prevented damage despite being killed by the Tree as well.
---
In the second deck though, healing big beefy minions to full was extremely important. Killing all the opponent's minions with your high-health ones followed by Tree of Life got you absolute board control and also prevented any chance of being bursted down, basically establishing complete control for you. Yes, healing to full was important thanks to all those aggro hunters running around at that time. It was the main reason of running the card at all. But against most of the decks, board control was what mattered. And getting value trades and healing all your stuff to full after that gave you that.
---
Not according to this subreddit. Control should be the only archetype. Every game should be a 45m control vs control slog where each person only hero powers the first six turns before taking turns dropping a bomb and killing their opponents'.
---
[Ice Cream Citadel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8ePY5K0y8M)
---
Idk why you are getting downvoted, you are right
---
true
---
Pally can't ramp though, so will only be a turn 10+ play, where Druid could have played tree of life on like turn 6 or 7.
---
Volcanic burst and thunderhead summons elementals that has synergies with earthen might or rockbiter weapon, and zentimo also is strong as board clear or silence taunt minions that prevents you to go face.
---
Yes, yes it is. Hell, I prefer losing to aggro more than combos. At least aggro I can tech against, to some extent.

if last turn was a hs card
---
Thank you for the video.
---
Looking at it he would have survived the extra fatigue damage anyway if he had played Liam immediately. Still the lost value could have made him lose, so in this specific case delaying it turned out to be helpful.
---
I very much that such a specific scenario will be common since it also requires an opponent with very heavy sustain to even get that far.
---
So it is something to keep in mind for something like this scenario, but I still very much disagree with using this a general strategy as was suggested earlier in this thread.
---
It‚Äôs even great to get their Flamestrike or Volcano out when you have no board.
---
There are just tons of cases where you don‚Äôt get punished whatsoever by playing this card.

You were right all along?
---
On android it appears that golden cards in your hand or on the board could be the reason. Since I took out all golden cards from my decks I haven't had a crash or disconnect. 
---
Is Anari their mother?
---
That's not meh, the secret is good at protecting your squishy hitters, such as secretkeeper of blessing of mighted dudes. Another 2/1 would make it a much more aggressive secret in these already agressive decks.
---
Sweet! Then we can all spend our days playing 30 minute control mirrors where both players stay at full health until fatigue kicks in. Sign me the fuck up!
---
He's Warlock only tho :(
---
On android it appears that golden cards in your hand or on the board could be the reason. Since I took out all golden cards from my decks I haven't had a crash or disconnect. Could be same on pc.
---
This isn't counterplay. This can outright win the game against the right deck at the right time.
---
As someone who once dusted their wild collection I would recommend not doing that.
---
Or Cloning Gallery
---
Just play rock instead of paper, lol.
---
Combo decks have anti-aggro tools (Blizzard, spreading plague). 
---
Aggro decks have anti-control tools (divine favor, loatheb).
---
Control decks have anti-combo tools (dirty rat, deathlord). 
---
Some of these don't have counterplay. What will you do about it? They need to exist so that you have a chance to win in all of your games.
---
I could twist your argument a little and say:
---
You can just play slower decks and stop relying on single minions to win. If you can't or don't want to do that, good riddance anyway.
---
Would I be right? No, of course not.
---
It exists but using a third party website, taking screenshots, and signing up ahead of time rather than just having decks built and queueing is cumbersome and not in the interest of the greater player base 
---
It‚Äôs the main competitive format of the game so it should be built in game
---
Even less cynical viewpoint is that that they are releasing balance updates way more regularly now.
---
As for tournament mode every other person has his own vision on what it should be and everyone just says that they want it without going even a tiny bit into detail.
---
&gt;clearly the majority of hearthstone players agree with me here
---
[citation needed]
---
Isn't Mechathun Warlock good in wild?
---
Blizzard doesn't like us to use spells to get armor. They want us to use dragons
---
You‚Äôre lucky to. It‚Äôs mostly just lines that are too thin. Easy fix.
---
Why do people hate combo decks
---
Paired with Electra and a Doomhammer. SMOrc
---
Lol thought the same thing
---
I don't really play Paladin, but I believe the effect of destroying your opponent comes from the hero power.  Having all 4 on board with one being pulled from your deck wouldn't trigger the OTK until you hero power.
---
[[Tree of life]]
---
Then why print a spell that gives you armor? 
---
"Hey, I don't want you to do that, but here, here's a way for you to do that."
---
If there's an otk paladin deck (I hope there isn't) this will go in really well

Costs 10 so you can do nothing else that turn, and it doesn‚Äôt even have taunt, so whatever was killing you the turn before is gonna kill you anyways next turn.

It‚Äôs probably the mobile phone‚Äôs heat. I play on mobile and get kicked off every 15 min.

---
Well no positive tone for shit cards or people using them to evaluate the powerlvl of new cards. I don't care about those downvotes (in that case I wouldn't say anything)
---
It's not the same as dirty rat because no minion in hard = no valid target = nothing happens. If they have a spell in hand, it's different. Either nothing happens or it casts and fizzles. 
---
Uninstall now. It'll never get better than that moment. 
---
Wait. If you had more armor than your opponent and played this with Auchenai, would you win?
---
im afraid you dont get the point of rotation at all. ive seen a comment where u say that a few cards were being used from the last 3 expansions. well they werent used cause better cards from ungoro KFT and K&amp;C took their place in decks. nobody will use a worse card when a better one exists and they intentionally made cards worse as a preparation for a rotation to overall calm the power level down. the last year of hs was the worst in its history and a lot of players cant wait for a rotation to hit so we can finaly see a change after over a year and a half of same shit dominating the meta.
---
Am i the only one that remembers that aggro was the go to deck build for the first few years of hearthstone and now with combo be so royally messed over it will be again?
---
Priest classic set sux yes. It will be fun to wait for 9 months to play Heartstone again..
---
You should know Blizz sometimes prints shit cards. Be glad it wasn't a shit legendary, those are the worst when they suck ass cause there's almost no chance to save them *and* they waste your legendary pulls.

make it duel to the death and the minions will attack each other till one of them dies

My bad, aggro, control, and midrange don‚Äôt netdeck. Sorry man.
---
Your understanding of extra must be different than mine. I'm getting a free golden upgrade, and 400 more dust than I started with. 
---
That means to me that the 400 is extra. 
---
You are comparing doing nothing versus crafting the golden and dusting it, which of course the net dust gain is the same, but that doesn't mean both ways still get you extra dust. 
---
Pally had two wincons with Shirvallah and DK. And the ‚Äùimmense amount of multi-turn setup‚Äù was hardly more than ‚Äúplay my most obnoxious stall, heal, clear, and cycle cards‚Äù. Mthun Druid is a great example of that.
---
[[Unearthed Raptor]] 2.0. Let's hope this doesn't crash the game when you play it.

Sort of new archetypes? New expansion = new decks. Maybe there will be Big Paladin, or it will be dead card, who knows.

I'm pretty sure this is terrible design

I love that, its quite obvious what it means, and quite fun aswell.

People forget you need to pull the combo piece and it die. I can't wait for everyone to pull maly and a 2/2 from their deck with no way to kill it and lose to damage next turn
---
I still think this could be good against aggro, but time will tell. You could hit soularium against a zoolock or Myra's against a tempo rogue, both of which could crush your opponent's strategy.

Still not as bad as Chimney Imp.
---
Got Nat Pagle, thanks blizzard..........
---
Yea, but this is wild. Out of all the psycho stuff you can do, mech warlock and gallery priest are the only decks that get by. And gallery priest only has OTK as a backup. Summoning 4 big minions 3x in a game isn‚Äôt concerned about it.
---
So, one deck really that‚Äôs an actual combo deck in all of wild is played above dumpster tier winrates. And it‚Äôs still not a top T1 performer. 
---
Nah, not really. Out of the 8 2-cost minions revealed so far only three(maybe four) are good in Arena, and one of those is a Legendary, so basically two 2-cost minions.
---
Cards like Mass Hysteria, Spreading Plague, Reno Jackson, etc, are absolutely "sometimes immediately win against aggro." 
---

The amount of support for these combo breaker cards shows it, as do the votes in the discussions about combo decks in their comments.

---
That‚Äôs reasonable I guess
---
Northshire Cleric is okay, it's not that great. It also isn't a real one drop. It's their "card draw" mechanic. Auchenai is only good in combination with circle of healing. It hasn't really seen play in quite some time.
---
Cabal is highly dependant on meta. Similar to Auchenai + Circle it's not been around much. If you can't steal something decent with it, it's an overly expensive Chillwind Yeti. Which makes it rather reactive. Think about a 2 attack card currently seeing play or in the new set you'd want to steal, which is worth keeping a possibly dead card in your hand for. 
---
And the problem with Priest legendaries is more, pretty much all of them are memes. Temporus was a bad joke and Benedictus is just terribad. It's a worse academic espionage in a way as it doesn't even give the discount. 
---
While other classes tend to get "memey" legendaries too, they also get some pretty awesome ones. Which usually isn't the case for priest. 
---
Pity they can't get some staff to fix all the iOS problems that we've been having the last 2 weeks? I don't care how many funny faces this guy pulls

I don't particularly care what other people are crying about, but a .5% difference is clearly not nothing and that difference is entirely because of playing for free or playing with money. That's objectively a pay to win effect.
---
And that's with one deck. Sure, you can get almost ideal results on your way to legend (completely arbitrary end result, what if you want to be top legend or tournament competitive?) without paying or playing for years... as long as you enjoy grinding out hundreds of decks with one of two borderline brainless, incredibly stale aggro decks. If it were actually f2p with no p2w at all, I'd be able to get basically ideal results with a control deck, too.
---
Definitely no.
---
They only bring back cards from the expansions the villians are originally from.
---
So: Old Gods, Kobolds, League of Explorers, Witchwood and Boomsday
---
Am I the only one who really likes the art? It is different than most arts, but some reason I feel like it fits really well.
---
I've played yugioh, which has traps and hand traps that negate card effects, and the decks that rely on oneshotting the opponent either succeed because they opponent didn't have the counter or fail because they did. It's still a binary "If my combo goes off you die"
---
Baku 
---
Yeah, I just dusted all my cards, uninstalled Hearthstone, threw my PC in bonfire and moved to the jungle.
---
*Rexxar wants to know your location*
---
Mage!
---
My list was solid, but not super strong, i was forced to Draft the Ragnaros Loa (because the other options was awful) and the only time i really used him was in the 11-2 vs priest and he used mind control.
---
I had a Pyroblast that won me some games but the great majority of the games i won was because i drafted my curve on 1,2 ,3 and 4 mana.
---
We can only hope but we've seen them release a few pieces of an "idea" then never really follow up quite often. Not just for priest mind you. Dragon Paladin has been "teased" for a long time but never got enough cards to make it viable even as a low T deck. 
---
I mean, RNG is part of hearthstone.  Part of card games.  And the effect for you is better than Gnomeferatu, so I don't see why this would make people quit.
---
Yeah I'm really excited for the upcoming expansions.   
---
I really enjoy value cards, and there are so many cards that have really good value, or generate some! But not infinitively like some from the year of the Mammoth
---
Seems fine to me, what's wrong with the deck list?
---
thank yaa :3
---
What in the world are you even trying to say?
---
‚ÄúDuel!‚Äù pulls from deck, not hand. You have no control over whether or not a value minion in your deck gets pulled unless you have a way to tutor it early.
---
That‚Äôs my point exactly. There will be cases where an extremely important card you need to play as a non-Combo deck gets burnt/wasted due to that disruptor card that was trying to target Combo decks.
---
Yeah I railed them
---
I can help explain this feeling. 
---
Let‚Äôs say there are weapons in the meta; some are broken and some are just OK. No one is going to tech against the OK weapons on purpose (because it lowers your win rate against the meta if they were the only ones around), but they might tech against the broken ones. 
---
Now the people playing the ‚Äúfair‚Äù cards get punished by accident by people targeting the ‚Äúunfair‚Äù ones. 
---
To put this in concrete terms, people might tech in weapon destruction against skull of the man‚Äôari, but accidentally also hit shadow blade, despite shadow blade not at all being on their mind when they built the deck
---
If you‚Äôre playing shadow blade that‚Äôs a frustrating experience because you end up getting punished for something you feel you shouldn‚Äôt get punished for. Your opponent was right on accident. Losing to that is a different feeling than knowing an opponent intentionally targeted the thing they hit 
---
Good for slower, grindier decks now that they can't rely on the infinite value from DK.
---
Subreddit in a nutshell.
---
4/5 star card, Zul'Jinn Hunter is IMO going to be strong and this card has a place in that deck. 
---
Depends on what "control" you are playing.
---
If you are playing a "no win condition" control then yeah, Jaina is the king of attrition and will likely outlast you. Then again, those are not the only control decks. There are slow decks that have very strong lategame and can simply overwhelm Jaina. As someone who played her a lot, I often lost in the lategame after drawing her because my opponent was able to pump out huge minions that I couldn¬¥t keep dealing with (Deathstalker Rexxar for example, or Deathrattle/Taunt builds with Cube/Hadronox etc.) that just created an uncontestable wall. Or control decks with a combo finisher like Mechathun decks or Exodia Paladin that Jaina could do nothing against. Or Ressurect Priest etc.
---
Jaina punished attrition, if you were a classic Control Warrior it was quite hard to outlast her, but if you had a strong lategame you could steamroll her. I had my fair share of games that were very swingy in late game even with Jaina, and I never felt like it was too punishing for all slow decks or unbeatable.
---
Yes, it rotates to wild, the format I was reffering to when I talked about an elemental deck with Ungoro synergies (since ungoro also rotates out). 
---
I also specifically mentiones standard after I was done talking about wild synergies.
---
r/fuckdruid
---
And just as Temporus leaves Standard: Dragon Roar is soft nerfed once again. 
---
A spell heavy hunter will definitely be a thing if they print more payoff cards than zuljin. The spellstone fit that role but with it rotating the deck is really just going to stall until zuljin fills the board with 5/5 rushers and animal companions, and then it prays
---
Losing flanking strike is gonna suck so much for hunter
---
Keeper Stalladris is gonna have a stroke with this one
---
I think he assumed it restored health to get you to 30. So like if the other guy has 20 health, it would heal 10 (with auchenai, its deal 10), which isn't enough to kill. 15 health is  the exact point where the damage would equal current health. 
---
In MtG, control decks are generally favored vs combo decks. Combo decks do best against midrange decks because the control decks actually have interaction against their combo.
---
Did just that yesterday because I rolled the 100 murloc quest. Went 3-2 in casual, and enjoyed it quite a bit.
---
It will be better automatically since Odd Paladin is gone. Reminded me of playing against affinity artifact decks, basically the worst sort of game design possible
---
Maybe some tempo priest with Zerek or some deathrattle priest or talanji. Or some way to otk with all the cheap spells and Mechathun with Lazuls scheme and Forbidden word or Topsy. Point is for most classes we have to wait and see and nothing is clear at this point and won't say that priest won't be good this expansion.
---
Even the combo players often complain about how this subreddit is too in love with control and that they are sick of combo being the villain or whatever.
---
I want this g.. card
---
I never said that RNG was bad. The way RNG is being used here however will harm the game a lot more than other uses of RNG however, at least IMO.
---
For a newbie, how do you make a standard deck that can win with this?
---

Control Paladin on turn 10: I'm gonna destroy this man's whole career.
---
Well it seems alright for killing a hench clan thug the turn after it's played, either if Hunter goes first, or with coin. This is yet another way Hunter doesn't have to sacrifice value. They've been getting pushed in this direction for awhile, and I think it's really cool. 
---
Also pretty great with wing blast, methinks.
---
I've played maybe 3 matches of hearthstone in my life and am curious - y'all can make your health higher than normal maximum right? Would this return it to normal? 
---
You say this like [[Dirty Rat]] and [[Deathlord]] were never a thing in Standard and aren't commonly played in Wild.
---
If you have more ways to disrupt the combo, you can adapt your control deck to fare better against it. The combo deck can also then adapt by making their deck less prone to disruption - eg. by being less greedy and running more value instead of just card draw and combo.
---
&gt; burned/overdrawn/pulled out/transformed
---
only works vs the shitty combo decks which have never been a problem. The good combo decks were good because no reasonable amount of hate cards would have won you the game, did you even understand your own comment?
---
ALL HOF.
---
I have three cards I am happy to finally see finally see gone 
---
[[Branching Paths]] - 4 mana gain 12 armour just let Mec'thun leave you for dust and as [[Keeper Stallaris]] is coming in I don't think this staying would have been great.
---
[[Explosive Runes]] - This felt so bad to play against it was a better version of [[Snipe]] but what made it even worse is you could not counter with a small minion because you would take 4 to the face but you could not even use on a divine sheild against it as you took 6. 
---
[[Caverns Below]] It got nerfed twice and I like to play Midrange or Control so you can see why I was glad this is off. It just felt so powerless to watch your opponant bounce, bounce, win I know the counters have come now but it's too late now in Standared.

---
Come on! Tree of Life also heals all the minions, that's like four circles of healing which makes this... huh. Still 1 mana 4/12.
---
It's statistics. If you rarely play a game past 10 turns, you're not seeing 2/3 of the game or having to deal with more complex turns or have to have critical thinking.
---
Do I play my strongest 3 drop on curve? Yes.
---
That can get you to rank 10 with agro decks. Throw in a few more steps and you've got rank 5 with Odd Paladin.

You can't do the same thing with something like control warrior or gallery priest. Nobody would argue against this who plays at higher ranks.

Yes but its much less consistent than in hearthstone because of hearthstones lack of complexity and instant speed interaction.
---
Speak for yourself :(

I kind of like the idea. Tribal cards emit a special glow when they are in the field of play.
---
and the new legendary that gives +2 spell power
---
Because it's a CG image instead of drawn. I think it works in this case because it gives a glossy, austere look to the image that fits for a High Elf in Dalaran
---
That makes sense.
---
Yes and they created quite a number of complaint/rage posts here. Now imagine that tenfold and affecting much more than one or two decks.
---
Was talking about his unite the murloc autodeck hence the reply and not its own comment.
---
As I expected.
---
Midrange hunter runs the same burn spells since classic. Kill command is the only remarkable good burn spell left in the hunter arsenal, and since the interception of standard, no great spell that could go face was introduced.
---
They are still scared to release a deck like face hunter in the classic days, while in reality it wouldn't even be that great anymore. Healing was absend during those days. Healbot was the best healing card in this meta. Sludge belcher the best defensive card. There was a 2 mana silence with beast tag and the 2/1 leper gnome. Since those days many design decisions have changed. Even the Odd Hunter was not strong enough, and he could shoot 3 dmg for free.
---
Take out the prep in a miracle deck ? For real ? 
---
Really nice for a card that gets a bonus off Shaman's discover pool.
---
No spellstone, though.
---
I don't see why this is worse than other RNG.  It's not like in control vs control this is massive game flipping event most of the time, its just a little swing that might decide the odd close match.  
---
Gnomeferatu burns your deathknight, or you just overdraw a card and its the one you really didn't want to lose.  That's just normal hearthstone.
---
Odd Warrior doesn't even lose to all combo. For example it beats maly druid pretty hard. It can armor out of maly rogue's burst range as well. It can run quest and have a decent change of beating other combo decks before they get their stuff off. 
---
The only one that I can think of that it really gets fucked by is OTK priest. 
---
True :P but we know what is leaving :)
---
Big priest won't be annoying in wild at all with this obscene Latin Kel Thuzad
---
Another anticombo card. Great!
---
Keep them coming Blizzard. I want more of these.

Blizzard has specifically promoted big priest in wild which makes it so much more frustrating
---
Soldiers of the cold dark
---
&gt; This same situation can be applied to all of the other Combo disruptor cards we‚Äôve seen so far. Sure, not all of them will be played, at least not initially, but over this entire coming Standard year, these cards will continue to infuriate and make the average player want to quit. I expect to be downvoted by the massive amount of blind hype players, but I‚Äôm speaking the truth and you know it.
---
where is your data of player quiting because they print the combo disruptor cards?  is this like the great hearthstone playerbase exodus because they print gnomeferatu or demonic project^^^/s ?
---
Kel'thuzad, but more E.V.I.L.
---
"Wild is supposed to be exactly that, wild...."
---
this is amazing in existing wild big priest decks....
---
Please elaborate on how it helps streamers on the long run? 
---
Because this minion can resurrect itself. That's why this card is busted as it will be ableto potentially snowball. This card is a design mistake and people are going to hate it
---
Oh no bby wut has you done 
---
What else would you prefer to play against?
---
I miss when Priest ran Auchenai Soulpriest.
---
.... all the way to wild, where we now have to deal with this monstrosity. 
---
It's a good point, but the third expansion of this year Priest will get another strong AOE (like they have for 3 years straight) and this card will become annoying AF.
---
Thinking of a deck with just this one minion. Rest spells. After it dies, you can keep resurrecting through various other means. Especially in wild you got so many options. So it‚Äôs constant flow of this minion coming back. 
---
In Mean Streets you had to just come prepared that the opponent might Dirty Rat your Kazakus and you could do the same to them. There‚Äôs always rng involved in these matchups but a lot of it is skill, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready to Kazakus yet so I need to hold some useless minions in my hand‚Äù or, ‚ÄúOh no they ratted my kazakus; what‚Äôs my plan to outvalue them?‚Äù
---
Unlike your brother who I turned into a monkey. 
---
Same. I tried again a whole year later, was successul that time, but had to play a few hours every day. Got to lenegd from r5 with 70-45.
---
The difference is this is an end of turn effect. So if you rez this you will rez something else also. Honestly it might even replace yshaarj in ones that do not run barnes.
---
No way he top decked lethal that has literally never been done before
---
It was still fun to play though.
---

---
Yes but you still can't spectate the pack opening.

as long as there is interactivity, watching you oponent assembling an OTK from full hael is not fut at all
---
I guess I'm never playing Wild again...
---
It‚Äôs primarily a toilet game for children. I think people forget that. 
---
WTFF?
---
To be honest, no. But reddit and pop science in general love to abuse Quantum mechanics principles (especially Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat which was actually a thought experiment meant to highlight the ridiculous nature of quantum mechanics, not explain anything at all). Another favorite is confusing Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle with the observer effect.
---
Wild exists, and this little girl can even resurrect herself. Big priest is not the best deck in the meta, but it warps the meta alot to aggro because control must sweat a lot to win vs priest. This card can be a whole deck of value in a card, because she can be resurrected many times and resurrect more and even herself. That was not what wild community wanted because it is extremely unfun
---
Yeah, I agree. Even in wild, I doubt this makes the cut for Rez/big priest.
---
Just imagine: barnes summons this, opponent kills it. You ressurect it -&gt; end of turn get a second copy of it -&gt; end of next turn get 2 copies
---
&gt; It's inaccuarate to break it down they way you did as
---
Yeah dude, I was saying that you could over simply anything and make it sound dumb and trivial.
---
Cube weasel tunneller, then copy the cube with mirage caller and shadowy figure, shuffle the weasels into opponent's deck, copy their deck with arch bishop, then draw all these weasels with  the priest legendary(forgot his name) 
---
This. They called it WILD and not something like legacy for a reason. They specifically stated that they want the mode to have all the broken shit the game has and had to offer. Deal with it. 
---
Your list needs another 1-mana body, and glass knight feels superfluous.

Yeah. I saw it directly after. Added an edit. It could see play in wild because of this effect. 
---
Heal to full effects don't even look at actual health. They heal the target for whatever its max HP is. Meaning that this + auchenai should hit you for 30. Paladin doesn't really have many ways to get to above 30 health.

I play a super greedy wild big priest for the memes that this is going straight into. I can‚Äôt imagine the frustration of a competitive deck with this in it. 
---
Damn that's good, it's hilarious and a bit sad at the same time. Blizzard needs to hire that artist!
---
Just reminding you that Grizzly and the 8 mana 2-14 are still in standard. Big Priest never dies, and I fkin hate this. 
---
People don't like to lose to the same thing constantly or lose in a way that feels cheesy is the bigger issue. But, HS is an RNG machine so the best ways to win are always cheesy and because those ways are best everyone ends up spamming them. There's no real way to get rid of the frustration people have in HS without changing the ruleset of the game. Blizzard doesn't even try. They just have a very blatant strategy of rotating what classes and decks are good.

The thing is though, none of the ones they've revealed seem good enough to warrant including on their own in a meta that isnt really combo heavy. I feel like we're going to see a lot less combo since if it ever becomes vogue people will just tech in cards like this but the combo we do see will be pretty strong.
---
Tree of Life with a 4/12 dragon as the stick for +1 mana seems like a solid consideration for control paladin if that becomes a thing.
---
This'll be great in wild
---
This is a novelty for big priest in that it‚Äôs *minion-based*, passive/continuous resurrection (I phrase it like that because we‚Äôve had cards like [[Onyx Bishop]] before), not spell-based. This has the largely new effect in big priest of exponentiality: if one of these die, you have a chance of resummoning another one. If more die, you are more likely to resummon one. If one resummons another, they both can resummon 2 more, which means there are more to die and therefore increase the likelihood of future resummons, etc., which is the exponential effect I referred to.
---
Some might say this is bad, because this card in this sense will always be at risk of becoming a self-perpetuating resummon-pool-diluter. But to me, having a warlock quest reward that summons 6/8s and sometimes Malygos/velen/other massive threats instead of imps (and without having the prerequisite of having to play a discard deck) sounds pretty scary.
---
minions, servants, soldiers of the cold dark! obey the call of that npc from the dia de los muertos wow holiday
---
This. Kel can be useless if you are behind on board or if the enemy can just remove him immediately. This gives you the rez every time.
---
&gt; It isn't auto-win to control. It's auto-win to shitty greedy control with no ability to deal real damage prior to turn 8. 
---
Okay, and these cards aren't auto-win to combo. Just auto win to shitty greedy combo who don't run a plan B in the deck.
---
Your entire comment is just "Its okay because I like combo, therefore nobody should allowed to have cards that are good against it".
---
This is absolutely amazing in already amazing Wild Big Priest, I can't even... This is so stupid. Until we get neutral cards that really mess with their rez pool, Big Priest is here to stay.
---
I just can't see how you'd hear that if you don't want to wtf... 
---
it's funny cos /u/nightdrawn said this 2 years ago , 
---
&gt; I think this issue is a big one because because there is simply not enough permanent support for OTK and Combo Decks in HS, and if there is, all of it is not interactive enough to be fair and enjoyable to play against. We saw this with Enraged Worgen and the Charge combo, that was extremely non-interactive as all the opponent had to do was get an Emperor tick off on his combo cards, drop the Worgen, Inner Rage and Charge it, and Faceless Manipulator it for lethal. There was no stopping this combo unless you had Taunt minions up or Ice Block and the ability to clear the Worgens the following turn, which is a very niche counter. 
---
/u/NightDrawn  , just think the new combo card as a niche counter. maybe the dev is printing more card in the future that will help combo deck like how mechatchun got support last year with defile, psychic scream.
---
My guess would be more hex cards next expansion

---
Well, time to vacate to classes with non-destruction removal.
---
You are right. I thought at first it's a battlecry. It's really a powerful minion and I like it for standard. But in wild, it will maybe be very obnoxious. I'm not sure, what to think, because I strongly dislike Big Priest in wild. 
---
Are you sure about that? This definitely looks like a great resurrect target and makes two bodies when resurrected, it can make a big difference in control matchups.

The capitalization you use - is Defenders of Dalaran the 2nd set this year?!
---
With this and the spell, how many people are going to be running [[Saronite Taskmaster]], [[Marsh Drake]], [[Leeroy Jenkins]], [[Muck Hunter]] and [[The Beast]] as anti-priest tech cards
---
It's silly to you, fine. I really don't care about *your* opinion of it. I'm just glad that Blizzard is finally starting to rotate out combo. It's faggoty.
---
So there are nerfs coming with this card... right team 5..?
---
The more views he gets in his video, even if it's not monetized, will allow HS people to eventually reach it out faster. Specially for people who don't use twitch, if they see guys backed up by Blizz in some way (like providing a legendary reveal) and they see it's in their native language, they might me interested in checking his other videos, or even their stream.
---
There is someone at Blizzard in charge of flavor text that is 1) mad that you spoiled their joke early 2) furiously writing an email to quickly change it to this.

Eh, I play all sorts of decks. The only ones I hate are hyper-aggro like Odd Rogue or Odd Hunter, or the combo decks like Exodia Mage that literally freeze your board 6 turns in a row while they‚Äôre collecting pieces. Not to mention the fucking games where they would play 3+ Ice Blocks. That‚Äôs what I mean by ‚Äústalling‚Äù. A control warlock player trading to set up good Defiles or trying to Azari me is fine because at least there‚Äôs so interactivity for me instead of me playing an Exodia Mage and saying ‚Äúwell I have 7 frozen minions for the fourth straight turn and have no face damage in hand, so I guess I‚Äôll pass my turn *again*. 
---
Armor.
---
Can save you
---
It would be one thing if every class had the shenanigans that big priest does. They do not. It‚Äôs not balanced. dEaL wItH iT
---
"Aggro is just brain dead face damage", "Control is just push button and not using cards"
---
"Combo is just solitaire"
---
Neither of them are good arguments, they're memes. If you want to discuss combo decks and their place in the Meta, you need better arguments.
---
If you just want to slur memes at a somewhat decent argument, good job.
---
Same, and I *played* priest. There was always some sort of delight in deciding whether I should use my OP low cost healing spells for healing or damage; I really enjoyed the whole "high health board control" style of priest with just a *touch* of stealing shenanigans.
---
But it's like inner fire/divine spirit caused all design to be directed away from that style, and then resurrection priest with an OP board control each expansion took over.
---
fucccck offfffff big priest is the most unfun trash to play against in wild this ain't helping
---
#of kel‚Äôthuzad
---
This card could snowball so hard with taunts 
---
So then how was your statement relevant to a post-rotation Zul-Jin Hunter? 
---
And games are supposed to be fun. I think one takes priority over the other. 
---
Except that Big Priest in Wild is actually popular way beyond it's success rate. Which suggests to Blizzard that its a deck that people like to play. And it's expensive to make, so dollar signs.
---
The most popular MtG formats are modern and EDH both "wild" nonrotating formats with tons of "broken" stuff.
---
Nevertheless banlists keep the formats mostly fun playable.
---
For real, -1/-1 from vanilla is still an alright tempo play, and the battlecry certainly makes up for those lost stats, assuming you don't force out a spell that helps your opponent. 
---
I recently saw a comment stating that Rafaam's 7/8 for 7 are "decent" stats... like, 7/7/8 is suddenly subpar? Yeah right. You can say that a body with no immediate impact is bad, and sure that's a fair assessment, but Rafaam has taunt. Makes it a fantastic tempo card with immediate board impact. Now the battlecry may or may not be good, but the body is great and you can't deny that.
---
I have to know how many elementals you played
---
I would like one if you don‚Äôt mind. Never done it before and I don‚Äôt really understand the economy of it yet 
---
The developers constantly talk about HOFing and rotating cards because of unhealthy interactions they would have with new cards they want to release. So how could you possibly be surprised by this? They will continually release cards that are, in their opinion, balanced for standard for the first time because of certain rotations into Wild. Meaning, by definition, they will not be balanced in Wild.
---
It‚Äôs random so it‚Äôs any dragon
---
Pretty sure there would be a lot of Barneses in there too.
---
Barnes into this, you ressurect her as a 6/8, who has a 50%chance of ressing another one as a 6/8. Who then have a 50% chance each next turn of making two more...
---
Are you joking? It's absolutely bullshit. This is absolutely going into big priest in wild and it is a free ressurect every turn, with the potential for insane summons.
---
This card is an abomination. 
---
There's several combo disrupting cards coming out next set.
---
done with Bext#2713
---
Dirty Rat can be an "I win" button though. A much better designed combo disruptor was [[Deathlord]]. Similar in principle, but because it is a deathrattle you have the opportunity to silence it unless your opponent wastes additional resources killing it off themselves on the turn they play it.
---
In the metas where Kelthuzad was relevant, having board presence didn‚Äôt necessarily mean you were on your way to winning. Kelthuzad was a wincon in its heyday. 
---
How expensive is this? Looking for a fun deck to play before rotation 
---
This would be terrifying if it‚Äôs the only minion in your deck and you just seance it twice and keep bringing it back to life with mass resurrect or something. 
---
#What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed
---
Imagine having such a superiority complex over card games lol.
---
I haven't played magic for 20 years, I played at FNM for a few months with my brother. I kept up with competitive yugioh for a good 10 years, so I'm familiar with card games that have disruptive effects.
---
I'm not exclusively talking about MTG, and never said I was, so IDK why you're using knowledge of mtg as proof that I have no idea what I'm talking about.
---
And I never claimed to know everything. I know my own thoughts on game design, and I'm sharing them cause this is the internet and I like talking to people.
---
I miss Kel'thuzad....
---
What came first the dragon or the egg?
---
Looks overpowered as fuck. 
---
No one:
---
Blizzard: Priest identifies itself as a resurrection helicopter. 
---
Thanks, I didn't know the syntax (obviously)
---
So more of a swarm type deck, I can see how that can be good but i dont know how good is swarming the board at the late game. It might be good
---
Remember when priest ran injured blademaster? 
---
One of my favorite decks of all time was a control attrition priest during old gods expac that ran blademaster,  circle of healing, northshire cleric, auchenai soul priest, fash heal, wild pyro, and the most expensive card was justicar trueheart.
---
Priest loses psychic scream and didn't get a replacement. Wih all the anti combo tech it won't even be worth playing combo decks.
---
You know, if Reckless survived a turn, you could play this and Cube it for 10 mana. And then get 2. I don't think they would proc at the end of the turn, through, since Reckless' effect is End of Turn.
---
Overload: 2
---
That's one of the worst card arts I've ever seen. 
---
That's 9 mana. Mana cheating is a real problem when you do stuff sooner than you should. It's actually kinda fine if you just do more than you should. 
---
I tried this in wild with barnes and ancestors call.  The Problem is drawing the four burn cards without any minions for draw.  
---
If it's weird to talk about an edge case of an edge case why exactly are you in this thread??
---
Wild exists
---
Damn i can feel the deathrattle priests' boner in my ass already. 
---
Toast is basically irl hunter deck XD maybe worrior cuz the war hammer ü§î 
---
Glass knight isnt there for the synergy, its a side effect i think. I would play a 4 mana 4/3 divine shield in a midrange deck so i put it in. I can add more synergistic cards. We will see how it turns out
---
Blizzard hasn't even killed resurrect priest yet and they are already resurrecting it
---
We haven't seen meaningful combo support yet
---
Looking at old joust decks seems a good place to start. This card would rely on spells, hero power and weapons for early game board control, and then try to use heals and large minions to win long games.
---
New fav card for the flavor only 
---
Alright then, since when did Paladins start harnessing mechs? Crystals? The power of god-like elemental titans? And a better question- who cares? Who cares if it's not "fitting" in paladin- it's fun, and ultimately up to Blizzard. 
---
Kel‚ÄôThuzad 2 electric boogaloo 
---
HAHA , i thought i might come back this expansion. nope..
---
I mean, classic Tesspionage Rogue is still on the table...
---
The more anti OTK cards the better!
---
wait what racial minority? and wasn't the dumbledore reveal when twitter wasn't relevant at all? from everything I've seen the additions are super overblown by the internet
---
I feel the dust system helps wild more than hurts. If you're a newer player, then yeah play standard because you can't even buy wild packs with gold. However, the fact that good cards cost as much as bad the ones and old cards cost as much as new ones means there's no crazy price hike for rare and powerful cards. If you have a sizable collection already, wild may be the better choice because your cards hold their value versus losing it once they rotate out of standard. I've been playing since Blackrock and wild's starting to look more fun since I don't have to completely rebuild decks I like.
---
I mostly agree with your thoughts except for Paladin. I don't think the "If you have the board you're already winning" argument is valid. If an aggro paladin loses the board they haven't lost the match, they can get it back easily. You're also assuming that you yourself aren't playing a board control deck. Who's to say I won't frequently have the board? Board clearing an aggro paladin and following up with this card seems INSANE.
---
Not to mention against a control paladin deck this is also pretty insane IMO. Casting their heals on random targets, using board clears for them, drawing cards when they have a full hand.. I can see a lot of applications and I don't think it would be hard to play this in a board state where it's literally ALWAYS a positive outcome for you against a control paladin.
---
I do agree though it seems atrocious vs Hunter.. like probably not even playable.
---
I think I can handle a 3 minute video. Now, if for some reason it took the caster 10 minutes to show the card, or something even more ridiculous like goofing around for 40 minutes just to take the card out of the packaging, maybe *then* I'd be annoyed.
---
Yeah but couldn't it hit your second copy?
---
I think hes going to join the waaagh!
---
This is actually a fatigue warrior card disguised as a paladin card
---
Because in wild Barnes exists. If you get a 1/1 of this in your rez pool, you ca kill it off and create a massive swarm of her. Basically a second y'sharajj
---
I can certainly see it. Maybe even Hecklebot will find it's place in a shudderwock deck
---
No. The old burgle cards will work like they used to. And discover will to.
---
&gt;  And the stalling cards were too plentiful and strong.  
---
That is the real problem.  Combo decks need to exist for the health of the game, but they can't be as consistent or reliable as they are right now.  You need a balance of the archetypes for the game to stay healthy.  
---
maybe this will finally be enough to get rid of Barnes
---
Yeah cool... in another thread people tried to convince me cloning gallery OTK is totally not palyable anymore because resurect stuff is gone.  
---
Cool... thanks for talking.  
---
It was a fun 2 hours where I considered that we wouldn't see another OTK meta where value absed controll is dead as efff :-D
---
where were all these combo disruptors last year...
---
The actually popular version costs 12-14 thousand dust, so no thanks
---
*cough* barnes *cough*
---
In a roundabout way, they do. With the quests of "play X minion".
---
If they just rewarded you gold for merely playing the game(or not) watch the bots skyrocket in number.
---
Mass resurrect seems pretty good to me if you're playing this early (they'll resurrect bad or no minions). Also on an empty board I'm totally fine with them playing Mass Hysteria. You're right though it can get very risky but I think overall it'll be pretty good vs priest.
---
The whole Shadows reveal was awesome. "But is it good against hunter?!"
---
For everyone who thinks this card is going to ruin the game... we have seen an effect almost exactly like this before, in a class with removal that is at least as good as priest's, in Geomancer Yip.  
---
They are both 8 mana minions, with similar stats, that summon a thing every turn.  They pull from different pools, but a lot of times in that regard yip is even better.  Getting 10+ armor isn't that tough for control warrior, and playing a deck where every minion catrina can pull is at least as good as an 8/8 is going to be pretty tough with servitude and shadow essence rotating.  
---
So, before you kneejerk hate this card, remember.  It's not controlled so it isn't going to bring the same big thing back repeatedly, it's at the end of your turn so it won't combo kill you, it's just a big value card at the end of the game that puts some stats on the board.
---
W I L D
---
As a long time priest player, I have heard that literally everything that we do is the worst. First it was "Mind Control feels so bad," so they nerfed it to 10 mana. Then it was "I hate that they play our own cards against us!" so they eased back on thoughtsteal effects for almost a year. Now it's "but ressurect!"
---
Well fuck y'all. Incremental board advantage and minion combat is boring as shit. But you kept pushing priest more and more towards that, and now that they can compete, albeit in the late game? Reap that goddamned whirlwind. I cannot wait to have 3 Catrinas on the board behind a wall of whatever stupid big taunt Blizzard wants to give us this time around. I look forward to stealing your Kalecgos and casting Mind Control for free with it.
---
Remember: you asked for this.
---
OP what will you do if this card sees play in a..... let's say at least Tier 2 deck at some point in the next 12 months?
---
Maybe wait and see until we know if those cards are actually playable
---
I'm also not a magic player but I'm pretty sure in the crazier formats you can even win on turn 0 (you can win going second before the enemy has a chance to play their cards).
---
The wording makes me think that it cannot. 
---
Ooooooh yeah
---
&gt;The old burgle cards will work like they used to.
---
This I know. They said it
---
&gt;And discover will to.
---
But this Im not sure. 
---
Now push for the card back ;)
---
ozuruk - 9 mana 1/1 sheep
---
Make Control Shaman at the very least semi viable and I'll return to the game.
---
What happens with vinecleaver?
---
&gt;for as many times as you can possibly get away with is not fun
---
So *four* times, in other words? 
---
It's not the fear taht you revieve a big 10/10. It's that this shit enables resurection/cloning galery priest again.  
---
Back to clearing the board for 14 turns then dealing 500 damage in go. All aboard the interactive fun train... chooo...chooo....
---
It's to use old cards not to have to kill Obsidian Statue 50 fucking times. 
---
Year of the bear
---
And [[Muck Hunter]] !
---
BUt we loose [[Hungry Ettin]] and [[Gravelsnout Knight]]
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
20%ish chance for Barnes on curve. Less than that to pull out Catrina. 
---
By turn 5 the new board presence mechanics in rush/minion damage/lackeys will have to justify playing around a Mass Hysteria or attempting to rez. 
---
Blame Ben Brode era design for printing spellstone and eternal servitude, not this card for being balanced and healthy in standard imo.
---
Gets silenced * cries in murloc*

That actually sounds quite skill testing, rewarding both sides for good meta understanding and mulligan.  MUCH better than the 'coinflip and you lose' style of Dirty Rat.
---
Golden legendaries have a pity timer, so you¬¥ll get at least one eventually (although 7 sounds above average, I have like 5 and been playing since open beta). 2 legendaries in a pack is pure RNG. 
---
The thing with hearthstone is that the deck limit is 30. That means in many cases you just don‚Äôt have the room to spare foralternate win conditions. If you‚Äôre trying the aviana combo that‚Äôs like 7 cards or something (I know it‚Äôs a feelbad combo so I‚Äôve never actually made a deck for it). Time warp is like 5 cards, and time warp is integral. Corrupted healbot irc, relies on like 7 cards, and casting the spells too early ruin it.
---
On top of damage mitigation and board control you only have so much space for win conditions.
---
Minion heavy decks get to just puke out more cards every turn though. And with broad minion synergy being very easily obtainable (fungalmancer etc.) games can end by turn 4. Why do they want to print this card?
---
at home enjoying his jungle now that everyone has left.
---
Oooo there is a method to my madness!

Most of the resurrect cards and many cards that you'd want to resurrect are rotating to wild. So if they are pushing resurrect priest in standard the question will become if priest has both enough stuff to make resurrecting "random" things worth it, and whether or not they have enough early game clear/defense so they don't just die to aggro without diluting their resurrection pool too much. 
---
this minion is amazing if it pulls a big minions not a small minion, and if possible it's main goal is to make sure it is the only minion that has died so it can exponentially summon more and more copies of itself. 
---
/probably
---
I didn't come here to cry dammit
---
But also the Barnes that they've killed will come back. You'd be gambling on a high roll situation instead of taking the sure thing with the minions that are already being run.
---
Fuck off blizzard
---
I wouldn't say that.  You don't want this off Barnes and you don't want this resurrecting Barnes. And if this is the first minion (Shadow Essence) it does nothing.
---
I'm not saying it can't be played, but I'm doubtful it will be optimal.
---
my favorite card is probably Spiritsinger Umbra and all the shenanigans Dane has pulled off with that card
---
Wow uh... this expansion seems really bad so far
---
Well Valeera was part of lore before hs
---
I think this card might be enough to kill Barnes, which is hilarious. Take out Barnes and play around this and Y'saarj as the high rolls. Barnes only makes your rez.'s crappier, screw him. I play a lot of Priest, I even play Big Priest. I am very sad to see this card. Wild is now broken.
---
This is arguably a better pull from Barnes that Y'Sharj. 
---
You get a guaranteed legendary within the first 10 packs of a given expansion.  So it may be worthwhile to buy packs of every rotating set until you open a legendary, then repeat for the other sets.
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru

Hmm, where was the humor?

OH HO HOHO MY NEW FAVORITE CARD.
---
Also kudos to this guy for including the card in English instead of a set of Chinese hieroglyphs like most of the Asian streamers.
---
Sure, I'll let you cast my cloning gallery for me. 
---
Hunter is mainly a tempo class because it struggles with resources tho.
---
Battlecry: Transform all minions into 1/1 Chickens
---
Another fun fact: they're called "Paul and Dean" in the Italian adaptation, mocking the pronunciation of "Paladin". 
---
This point is a mix of themes. It's like Time Spiral from Magic.
---
What I like about RoS is it doesn't promote linear gameplay like the last 2 starting expansions. 
---
Un'Goro had Quest mechanic and Witchwood had the Start of Game hero power upgrades. The first mechanis was not very strong but bring me a single guy who enjoyed playing versus Quest Mage or Quest Rogue. The latter was so out of control it got some iconic class cards from basic and classic set nerfed. Flametongue and Equality didn't deserve that. I don't even talk about how they got hall of famed a year earlier for the first time in Hearthstone. So for me Rise of Shadows look so promising so far. My only issues are the post-rotation situation of druid after getting his evergreen cards nerfed because of powerful expansion cards like Spreading Plague, Ultimate Infestation and Branching Paths and the cards warlock got so far. People hype Rafaam because of nostalgia but it is a RNG casino card that I think will be get boring faster than expected. Druid and warlock are my two favorite classes so it may come as personal but I am sure at least some other people will agree with me.
---
how does making cards that are an "I win" button against another archetype reward skill, zihi is a good combo disrupter, a lot of these cards are combo killers, that's not skill. While there is the argument that combo has the same "I win" button, it's generally not bundled within a single card, malygos is a bad card without spells to support it, but these new cards are still decent on their own without the added bonus that they kill combo
---
Remember when we thought ressurrect priest would die this rotation 
---
4 mana 2/2 - **Battlecry:** Enemy spells cost (10) next turn.
---
Damn ninjas shoving invisible onions!
---
I dont remember, but if she was then she was available for 2 weeks and promptly removed. While technically added to the game, it wasnt until hearthstone made her popular and legion that she was kept ingame forever
---
Oh my god blizzard STOP
---
The trade off is now every time you raise of of those, you get two raises, plus one every round it stays alive. It would overwhelm the board pretty fast. It think I would swap KT for this at first and see how that works out. The low roll of raising Barnes is always true anyway.
---
Does anyone think that saying "it was a joke" makes it funny?
---
Well no it could be 2 if the priest can't deal with mechathun  it will just go face
---
This will see competitive play only if there's some dominant OTK deck that a third of players are using on ladder that relies on a spell to pull off the combo, and I just don't see that happening. With that said, I think the card has awesome flavor and a unique effect and I eagerly look forward to the Trollden clips.
---
Barnes always polutes your Rez pool anyway
---
Yeah I'm serious you should probably seek professional help.
---
She was, but the other redditor asked about wow specifically, not warcraft.
---
Fuck.
---
What's wrong with Twilight Drake? Or do you mean Duskbreaker?
---
It's not a back and forth if the players are just doing the same things.
---
"Interactive" is when each players' choices cause the other player to need to make a meaningful decision about what cards to play. If your opponent's cards are not forcing you to make a meaningful decision, you're not interacting with your opponent.
---
If I have a card that says "Your opponent must play 'Counter' from their hand or they lose the game," and my opponent responds by playing counter from their hand, then we didn't really interact with each other. I played the card my deck is built around and my opponent played the card they were supposed to. My opponent had no reason NOT to play that card, and they had no reason to play it earlier knowing what I had in my deck.
---
This sounds plausible. Loatheb is one of the most beloved cards and Blizzard must like the idea since they printed a card like Rebuke.
---
There are surprisingly low amount of dragons right now, i hope more get revealed so i can tinker the deck more
---
Ok I‚Äôm gonna try to explain this, but it‚Äôs gonna be pretty hard. Forgive me if you get completely lost.
---
First, instead of mana crystals, magic has lands, which are essentially zero mana cost cards that give you a ‚Äúmana crystal‚Äù but you can only play one per turn. Also, opening hands in magic have 7 cards in them.
---
In addition, magic has cards called ‚Äòinstants‚Äô which can be played at any time, even if it‚Äôs not your turn. And finally, magic decks can have four of each card, not two.
---
Ok, so what you do is: your opening hand has two of a specific type of land in it, which, if they‚Äôre in your opening hand, you immediately put them into play at the start of the game (like a start of game effect). So the game begins and you put those into play. Then, before your oppenentcjas a chance to do anything,you play another card, a two mana instant, which allows you to put any minion from your hand into play, and then, if you can‚Äôt pay its mana cost reduced by two, you destroy it. The minion that you put into play is a card that, when it dies, allows you to search through your deck for any number of minions with total mana cost 6, and put them into play. The cards that you search for are three cards that are two mana and, when any minion dies, your opponent loses one life and you gain one life. You also search for a bunch of zero mana cards which are similar to the forbidden cycle in whispers of the old gods. They cost zero and have zero attack and health, but you can pay any amount of mana when you play them to give them that much attack and health. There are lots of different cards like this, so you can get dozens of them out of your deck, and, since they all have zero health, they die immediately, triggering your three guys that make your opponent lose one life when something dies, and your opponent takes enough damage to kill them.

‚ÄúOur‚Äù... ‚Äúus‚Äù... some people play and play against all the classes and would like fun and competitive balance.  There‚Äôs no reason competitive balance has to include feel-bad mechanics just because they‚Äôre what somebody else‚Äôs ‚Äúus‚Äù has gotten used to.  I agree they should fix Priest‚Äôs classic set, and Priest should have good expansion tools, but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else needs to be prepared to deal with six of the same eight mana minion before turn 10, none of which ever costed full price.  And it isn‚Äôt fun as the Priest player either, having only cumbersome archetypes that either brick or dominate based on the order of your deck.  The mechanic is controversial for a reason.
---
Within a few months we will be moaning that there are no good combo decks.
---
Yea I think only class legendaries are given out as free legendaries
---
Auchenai phantasm/soulpriest+circle of healing is a 2-4 mana clear (probably soulpriest so you don't rez a 3/2), along with the 2 new 0 cost spells (one of which is removal, the other is a stall tool, and together they're better removal)+gadgetzan (also a good rez target) which draws you into potential 0 costed Grave Horrors. You can also run tempo-value instead, since injured blademaster isn't going anywhere and ziliax is also a good rez target.
---
I mean even in a tempo variant with Northshire, 9 mana for a 4/7, ziliax and Northshire Cleric (20 stats, 5 with rush/divine shield) isn't bad. 
---
Alright y'all, new wild deck: Big Priest with This Lady and Kel'Thuzad.
---
TWO MINIONS, BUT ENDLESS ARMIES.
---
WELP. Now I've seen it all.
---
ITT: People who have zero clue how the control meta works in Wild, and also pretending they won‚Äôt play Priest if someone else makes a list that wins.
---
Great card, this will indeed make Priest much nastier. Quest Reno N‚ÄôZoth here I come
---
[tar creeper]
---
You are correct
---
Aw the flame elementals! 
---
I mean, if it summons a 6/6 it's not the end of the world.
---
it's world of warcraft my dude, when people mention WoW lore they pretty much mean all of warcraft lore. Plus, she was in WoW

3/1/5 Elemental | Taunt Has +2 Attack during your opponent's turn.

I think they need a keyword for Minion that couldn't be protected by taunt minion but couldn't block damage to the hero

It could spawn a new Paaladin Archetype. Grabbing Tirion or other big guys to make it a value play.

Cluck cluck

YOU FACE JARAXXUS
---
Well yeah I KNOW, I was asking for specifics. I got my answer from another reply. You need a very specific set of cards in your hand.
---
I‚Äôve seen the infamous video of Kibler losing instantly to a single card his opponent drew. 
---
now we can RESUMMON **THE ANCIENT ONE**
---
"Cheesy" is just as nebulous a term as "unfun"
---
It's so bizarre, they had an amazing chance to being back tons of wow lore and have an expansion whose theme and flavor writes itself. Insteadead we're bringing back HS exclusive villains and the flavor/thene is "I dunno.. a bit Warcrafty?" All this on top of travesties like Boom's scheme
---
Blizzard's official announcement when revealing this card:
---
"fuck you lol"
---
You hear both, one at the start and one then you play Genn.
---
I would not mind if hearthstone spoilers were just card art. Lol.
---
You say that as if the ban lists actually prevent the format from having insanely powerful cards - it doesn't.
---
I thought the same and I was right as an arena player.
---
Are you stupid or are you just trolling? Has Blizzard ever official said that Wild is meant for "broken interactions". No they haven't.  Why do you think Aviana, Naga was nerfed? Try to enjoy the format the slightest when everyone are running oppressive broken decks. It's stupid. 
---
Yeah but she never gonna see any play unless there is a way to draw her in first ten turns.
---
One of these days I'm going to meet kibler and then all the karma will be mine!
---
Fingers crossed he gets hall of famed, I have a golden one and want da dust! 
---
It‚Äôs about sending a message. 
---
Caster, top streamer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

yes but if you make maly and DE your still losing 1200 dust but if you make gold and DE your losing 1600 dust.
---
You aint seen shit bro, 38 wins 38 losses and have 35% games against huntards.. this game is retarded, it snot even fun to play against hunter AT ALL SO WHY MATCH ME AGAINST THAT (---------) CENSORED.\\

U want proof? [PROOF THIS](https://imgur.com/gallery/Je6ybKM) and that is only at rank 15 ffs.. cant imagine the fun of getting around 10.. wtf is wrong with this game.. seriously.

That's one of like 3 legendaries I have from Witchwood lmao. I'm totally gonna try this even if it ends up not working.

Why do you need seance?
---
Seems far too slow to see play
---
how do we not know this isnt an angry Santa? 
---
F*** the res mechanic. Worse than cheating minions out of your deck because they were already dead
---
There's definitely a big difference between hitting y'shaarj and obisidian statue, rag, etc, but a lot of times it forces your opponent to start reacting to your plays instead of developing their own gameplan. Barnes isn't always an auto-win button, but he does literally add ~15%+ to your winrate when you draw him in the mulligan, which is about as close as you're ever gonna get to an actual auto-win button.
---
Onwards friends to wild.
---
It may attack again, who? Can he go face after killing a minion?
---
I just did that to a goddamn Espionage Rogue, clearing his board with my 11 Hounds, preserving the game with 9 Health left for me.
---
I also was able to get a Stealth from my Razormaw on the Hyena.

1/-/- | Change a minion's Attack to be equal to its Health.  
---
Why would I kid about the Velvety slim Jims in that honey pot of a picture ;)
---
This card looks very Priest
---
While this is in your deck, it has a 50% chance to be drawn.
---
While this is in your hand, this has a 50% chance to cost (1) less.
---
**Battlecry:** 50% chance to attack a random enemy minion immediately.
---
**Deathrattle:** 50% chance to return to hand.
---
Sounds like a sick set. 50% of the time.
---
I still remember my first arena ever. It was free so I decided to give it a try. I had no idea what curve was and didn't know which cards did what yet or know which classes had what cards. I went 0-3 and went as good while before I ever touched arena again.
---
Interesting for classes like rouge who struggle when it comes to board clears, though 8 mana is probably too much. 
---
Warrior has a card to keep minion drop below 1 health (forgot the name), these two cards can be used together to wipe out a lot of small minions.
---
Neutral board clear? Holy shit
---
With inner fire might be alright, otherwise this doesn't seem great to me. 3 attack on an 8 mana minion. Maybe good for clearing aggro dudes
---
Clearly, also the single player doesn‚Äòt release on 9th of April. Gosh
---
Handpicked by Blizzard to do various set reveal videos, an honor bestowed to only a few people in the history of the game.
---
I'm thinking taunt priest. That way the minion can always res a minion to protect it
---
Shazrazad is the best card in Magic and I refuse to believe otherwise
---
It's epic, just polygon being idiots as usual
---
(Time of Your Life)
---
I crafted lady in white. Looks she going to back to dust once this expansion hits. Hardly 30% win rate with duskbreakers, tar creeper and psychic screams. Without them, no way.
---
TIL Hearthstone text is pirate code.  More like guidelines than actual rules. 
---
But what do they do about the second Forests Aid???  
---
Twinspell OP pls nerf.
---
At least it has some nice artwork
---
Windfury won't give it the ability to hit face on the turn it's played. Right now the rules act as:
---
* The turn a minion is summoned, it cannot attack.
---
* The turn a minion is summoned, it can attack other minions if it has Rush.
---
* The turn a minion is summoned, it can attack as normal if it has Charge.
---
Windfury won't break the first rule, with the known rules and the known cards we have now. Of course, anything *could* happen, because Hearthstone occasionally has... interesting interactions.
---

---
I'd say probably good against aggro. Inner Fire would be great, would definitely see play in Big/Wall Priest in Wild.
---
Yeah, idk about this one. It's gonna take a while to make this seem good imo
---
How is that shit? Pair it with inner fire and it can pretty much clear any boards. Something like Abusive Sergeant  or paladin buff might be enough to enable it as well. 
---
It's not the best cards ever printed, but I would be surprised if it doesn't see play in some midrange, or decks with lot of buff.
---
Think your only getting back what you spent you spend 3200 your getting 3200 so its just a free Golden Malygos in the end if you spend 1600 you get 1600 so it's just a free Malygos in the end. you only get the 1600 extra if you choose to lose the free maly.
---
Truly the last kaleidasaur
---
Hearthstone is in a very interesting state of "canon", Because the game of Hearthstone itself is canon to the Warcraft universe. So canonically, the game devs are actually in the warcraft universe (and probably part of a small indie company, which is why we havent seen them in the game proper) and they make cards based on the foes that threatened Azeroth, or the heroes that saved it. Sometimes they just make cards based on fictional events because its just a card game. 
---
This is, in my opinion, one of the most fascinating way to canonically handle a spin-off series. It allows the Hearthstone writers to use things from WoW, or freely create new things. Allows the WoW writers to continue doing their things, or freely pick and choose cool concepts or characters from Hearthstone.
---
This prevents a lot "arbitrary" decisions as to what is and isnt canon, and also dodges a lot of potential continuity errors or questions. I love the ingenuity
---
Promordial Drake is better, but this new card will still become a good replacement after rotation 
---
Rise of Shadows? More like Rise of Reprints

---
**Card text:** **Rush.** After this attacks and kills a minion, it may attack again. 
---
thank you for showcasing how individual and epic you are by posting the same tired comment like a billion other people posted
---
Aggro gonna be a problem in the first few weeks...
---
I'm thinking Blessing of Wisdom.
---
Also it's often just a 2-card board clear with Inner Fire.
---
What if it's a ritual. Like the warlock card that destroys your deck.
---
Read the text, thought "OK, sounds good". Saw the 12 health, "OK, this could really work". Then I saw the 3 attack and wondered why they even printed this card. OHKO Priest meme deck likes this card, that's about it. 
---
No. The ability gives the minion extra attacks, but it still restricted by the rules for summoning. Rush allows you to use your attack(s) against minions the turn it is summoned but it won't allow you to go face.
---
Another way to think of it is to look at how windfury works. Windfury gives minions an extra attack, but it still can't use any attack of them without rush/charge.
---
Harbringer should have that effect until she brakes stealth or something like that.
---
I agree on the existence of combo decks, but not OTK ones. Aggro beats control already, so I wouldn‚Äôt go on that direction. Meta should have more unique decks and I think this set will be one of the answers for that.
---
Millhouse, Mana Lord
---
2 mana 4/4 - At the start of your turn, YOUR spells cost (0)
---
The new Raven can still give you Anton. It should destroy minion generation or summoning effects also
---
I got a 100g quest today then rerolled a 50g quest and got a 60g quest. I guess Blizzard just loves us and hates you.
---
My preferred solution is to remove "friendly" from the res cards. You could end up ressing your opponent's doomsayer or Loot Hoarder.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought initially as well, but the fact that it‚Äôs not restricted to minions that dies this turn makes quite the difference if you think about it.
---
This will almost always be playable on curve,  since it doesn‚Äôt rely on already having the board unlike Kel Thuzad.
---
I don‚Äôt think it can attack face after it kills a minion. With rush you have to wait until the next turn
---

---
i've been away for a while. What's happening with Tar Creeper?

---
Just what obsidian statue decks need. 
---
Loose so many runs to him
---
Budget Kel‚Äôthuzad
---
Most needed to be built with more health,  but there was too much removal still in play and other issues from other sets. They probably needed to wait for ther rotation to implement it better. 
---
I like to imagine that every villain thinks it stands for something different.
---
In my head, Boom thinks it's "Explosive Villains &amp; Inventors League."

---
Competitive wild is just going to become more and more of a shit hole as time goes on lol. I play it for fun shenanigans from time to time but there‚Äôs so many combos/decks I never want to see again

---
&gt; APM Priest is in Standard
---
Only Boar APM, and it will probably not survive rotation without Radiant Elementals and Shadow Visions.
---
Holy Smite APM Priest is a wild-only combo, popularized by Bananaramic.
---
I love this card. Fair costed, solid stats, neat ability and oh yeah.. amazing art. Seems very well done. 
---
I don't remember the whole exact combo but it abused Yawgmoths Will, Yawgmoth's Bargain, Hurley's Recall, and artifact mana acceleration to draw endlessly into a storm combo. The finisher was Tendrils of Agony. I found a list here but it looks slighly different than what I was playing. I think there might have been a component of the deck that has since been banned but I dunno...I've been out of the loop.

---

---
Because half the time it feels likeq nothing is happening. You can't really tell how close someone is to their OTK so you can't prevent it, and there are almost no cards that can actually break a combo.

---
I know, but you can hide him behind your taunts for a turn assuming you're playing wall priest, then you have a way to clear any taunts your opponent may have in play the same turn as your OTK.
---
It's funny you should say that, I noticed tonight that I got vinecleaver from a pack I opened to get the first-10-packs-legendary and made an odd paladin deck (with baku as only leg). A somewhat different feeling! So far I feel I am only limited by my stamina. After 5 games I'm tired and have to take a break... :P
---
Oh my bad. So red deck wins is also combo. You assemble your pieces (20 points of burn) and win. 
---
$80 is just soo much money for not that much content...
---
I'd rather spend it on RDR2 or Spiderman
---
At least it isn't "Who goes thar"
---
The set it's in is rotating out.
---
everyone is having PTSD from the days of Togwaggle druid, ShudderShaman, and dare i say... ***cubelock***
---
All that would help is having some knowledge about card games in general, but the devs have tried hard(maybe too hard) to make the game very accessible for everybody. So you'll learn everything pretty easily even if you dont, dont be afraid of asking anything on here or on the discord(ppl are really active). Streamers/youtubers have a lot of useful information on their channels(heard trump's are really good, but I personally didnt watch them when I started).
---
I would check out the unique quests in here if you want some extra gold/packs to start off, you'll get them by just playing at some point, but it's good to know they exist:
---

Give the solo adventures a shot, icecrown gives you packs and a free legendary, while dungeon run and the witchwood one are really fun. Like some people only play those fun.

Barthvader #11324 Trade quest. I show, you go first. NA
---
Haha this happened to me yesterday (I had it summoned for me). I had a good chuckle to myself.
---
There's also the Healbot Priest OTK. There's Shaman Spellstone/Hero Power OTK. There's Knuckles OTK. I've played these whenever I reach a rank floor. So much fun.
---
Right now I am enjoying Handbuff Paladin with OTK potential with five chargers. 
---
I know it's degenerative, but I love Cubelock. I love Carnivorous Cube's art so much. I love the combos. It's one of the most fun decks I've ever played, and you know what? I am kinda excited for it to go to wild. It will give me a reason to make a super duper cube deck with some of my favorite cards like Mal'Ganis. 
---
Mel Thuzad? Is that you?
---

---
Flavor text: ‚ÄúThe higher you go, the thiccer it gets.‚Äù
---
There's an Exodia deck (which is banned entirely. You cannot play that deck), that allows you to draw you entire deck on the first turn you play, and get the 5 pieces of Exodia. And **I think** you need 1 specific card, the rest are interchangeable.
---
Wild is more like vintage than Modern.
---
If mechatun becomes meta, meta becomes anti mechatun. There are lots of cards now to counter mechatun decks.
---
Literally what every person says in this sub: oh my god this set sucks I‚Äôm quitting. Or: oh my god I‚Äôm so hyped for this new set!! Realistically it doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone thinks because no one will be satisfied with the work the dev team puts in. There will always be at least 1 person who dislikes it and 1 person who thinks it‚Äôs the best set released so far. I think it‚Äôs unfair to ‚Äúgrade‚Äù a set before all the cards have come out and without seeing how diverse and fun the meta is.
---
And he's not so bad if you don't die turn 4.

ƒ∞f u talking about the one toast playin he uses naturealize
---
Things have become relatively balanced, of course certain classes are still better than others tho. There is a new "bucket" mechanic in drafting where instead of each pick being based of card rarity, cards are put in "buckets" based on card quality, and each pick has 3 cards from the same bucket. I recommend checking out r/arenahs if you want more info. :)
---
2 mana 6/6 All enemies minions cost 0.
---
lol you literally just proved my point
---
I'm ftp as well, and Arena is my main game mode. There have been a lot of changes in the last 2 years that have made it significantly more "fair" and more fun, IMO. 
---
Arena is no longer Wild. For the last 2 years (roughly) it has been Standard format. However, in just over a week, things are going to change yet again in this area. Arena is about to become a rotating limited set of particular sets from the past combined with classic and the latest expansion set.
---
There is now a "bucket system" for drafting. This ensures (usually) that every choice is between 3 cards that have a similar power level. There are caveats when Blizzard gets the power levels wrong, but this makes the drafting process overall much more meaningful and less of "pick the obvious more powerful card" every time.
---
They've also begun "micro adjusting" certain classes to attempt to ensure that every meta has classes as close to 50% as possible. Hopefully they will still be able to continue this trend with the new limited rotational system in place. There will still always be an obvious "leader" in regards to classes, given the particular cards and archetypes in the meta, but it is a lot more balanced than times in the past.
---
For more information, I recommend checking out the Lightforge Podcast. Or checking out arena centric subreddits such as /r/ArenaHS and /r/GrinningGoat.
---
&gt; you expect him to do anything else

I expect him to stay on the board while my opponent exodia's my face off!

---
this is insane with reckless experimenter. reckless+karen+cube+double this boi=infinite karen.
---
Current one loses the minstreal's tho.Thats a huge deal
---
The problem with big priest is the reasonably high probability that the game is just over by turn 5. That doesn‚Äôt feel like an interesting match - it‚Äôs literally just someone winning on rng.
---
But then again, at this point about 2/3reds of matches feel like rng decide the outcome as opposed to play.
---
So... mecha-Jaraxxus?
---
REFRIGERATOR SENPAI HOW COULD YOU?!
---
One day they‚Äôll make nice affordable AR glasses we can wear all the time and everything will be insane. Home furnishing, clothes, etc. everything will be plain and will be transformed through our glasses. 
---
Dont forget the recent trend treant art...
---
Wow did you finally make one? I'm proud of you.
---
Nah, they just printed them anyway and we have to deal with some of them since +20 years. Yay!
---
Well yes I think too hard to balance given the tempo based flow the game, we had enough time to test it and it doesn't work; The devs need to try with overkills that penalize the trades and not reward them, otherwise it only works with rush minions.
---
2 mana 
---
2 HP
---
2 ATK

Inspire: your spells costs (1) less This turn.
---
Armour does not. If your HP hits 0, you die. All them idiot Druids found that out with Ultimate Infestation.
---
Also hero power Paladin and the new Paladin holy wrath combo with banker
---
The one I'm interested in is kill minion -&gt; attack face -&gt; attack again?
---
Hearthstone takes place in the Warcraft universe, same as WoW. All of the characters and cards are meant to be from the Warcraft universe, but not all of them are from any of the other games. A lot of the cards from Hearthstone are unique characters created just for the card game. Some characters that first appeared in Hearthstone have later gone on to show up in WoW. Sir Finley Mrrgglton, and I believe the whole League of Explorers, is one example. Tortollans are an example of an entire race that first appeared in Hearthstone and then later made it into WoW.

---
Right, but there is practically no reason to run gallery without rez mechanics. Yes there are some weird otk things with mind blasts, but those rotated with radiants. 
---
Cloning priest got to be an interesting and weird deck for a few months before rotation. If they never printed another rez effect for its lifetime in standard, then that entire legendary card is pointless. It exists for no reason other than as a memento of a former T1 deck. This way, there is still a deck you can build (cloning gallery, expect everything to die, then play this catrina/mass revive, both of which are viable as long as big minion strategies are viable. This could easily be the last rez effects for a while - just strong enough to make gallery not a pointless card. 
---
