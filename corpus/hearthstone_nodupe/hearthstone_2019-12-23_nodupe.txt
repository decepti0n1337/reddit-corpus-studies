Agreed. This OP is trolling is own post.

---
---
It doesn't read effects of minions, just their stats and if they have reborn/deathrattle. He will be less willing to give aoe if they have a deathrattle, and I'm pretty sure things like zombie chow will do so as well.
---
[removed]
---
I've been doing well against it with my handlock deck. Nether Breath and Abyssal Summoner are key cards, since lifegain and taunt are excellent against face hunter. You just have to be fast to build a board to kill them, because you can't extend the game forever
---
Hm I see the points you are making. I am not a f2p player and never will be. So its a question of money at the end. I mean its not really a Problem, I am not young anymore so I earn enough to support my games. But i also dont like to just throw it away like it is nothing. Are there resources that let me know wich cards are safe to dust, like an xml or a website?
---
OTK paladins have to draw they're whole deck, they literally can't win. Warrior is most likely a aggro matchup
---
Hearthstone has always had terrible devs idk what u expect lol
---
lol i didn't do anything though. i just think there's no reason to be this bitter about the whole thing. this post is far more of a 'hissy fit' than the people talking about hk
---
All the battles are precomputed once the recruitment phase ends. Replaying is just looking up the entry. 
---

---
This was a glitch with the Client side not realizing you saw what transpired already.
---
I thought more or less the same thing. After some experimentation after the launch, the few people on my friendlist who did not entirely switch to battlegrounds already \*completely\* stopped playing until the nerfs went live. Blizz absolutely shattered the important momentum of the expansion launch with this one. And you can still observe the effect of it even now. If you would not know better, you could think they are trying to kill what enthusiasm is left for this game. For a really longtime fan, it is kind of heart breaking. Maybe I'm wrong, but to me it feels like the era of online card games is coming to an end finally.

For me Hunter was the hardest one

I'm sad that I had to scroll this far to find this... IDK what were they waiting he should be with that name...
---
Unpopular opinion, but Runeterra seems incredibly simple. 
---
There's a lot of keywords, but I think at its core it's an incredibly simple game. It has a lot of flashy tricks, but the strategy for most decks is just braindead aggro with very little meaningful decisions being made.
---
It's stupid. I'm a wild player, thought I'd spice things up and go to standard. Was rank 5 and up in the past but now rank 20. Decimated all the clearly new and free players because clearly have better cards and decks. When you've reached rank 10 and up you should never be able to go down to rank 15 and under.
---
How bullshit does it feel to get absolutely stomped by clearly more experienced and well equipped players when you're just starting out
---
I just think that the amount of phases in a turn is way to many and that will scare away alot of causal players
---
This DESTROYED my perception of reality
---
The animation was dope, though.
---
&gt; To say iPads are under specced is laughable. 
---
Literally nobody here even said anything about this lol
---
Oh for sure, but I feel like new players should have time to figure out the fundamentals with with the basic cards first before having to unpack more powerful cards.
---
I sincerely feel better when I draw a game then when I win on hearthstone.
---
Ez just run Tekahn in every galakrond rouge. Legend rank 1.

Yeah, I'm down with every quest being compatible in BG.

Don‚Äôt believe the lie about Anubisath deathrattle highroll deck. It‚Äôs quite ass. Use the tempo deathrattle one, much better
---
Nah, both of you were stupid. He was stupid for not playing the Coin first and you were stupid for playing Counterspell T1 going first.
---
I‚Äôd nominate Moroes if he isn‚Äôt too much of a meme
---
Sathrovarr maybe?
---
Apart from the wins quest, you also for some reason can complete the turns quest in BG, but not the "play x cards"

I sometimes do it if they are playing a non meta deck and I'm 3 stars or less at a plateau rank
---
Me being salty
---
Tinfoil hat says they fully expected this. The nerfs barely gave back dust, so they get more out of the netdeckers, which are switching away from Shaman.
---
Thank you for this! followed on Twitter. Great read
---
I do this once I'm rank 5 for the season and playing meme decks for fun. I'll concede to a rank 6 if his deck isn't cancer and he wasn't spamming emotes. So not very often, but it's the thought that counts.
---
Sorry I've been a bit out of the loop. Is it like the previous adventures where you can purchase it with gold or money?
---
I've just been so unlucky recently. If I'm playing a priest Hunter counter deck, I run into combo decks. When I switch to a combo deck, I run into hunters. It's like pulling an umbrella out and the rain stops :/
---
&gt;Nick#14239
---
killerspork#1506 I sent you a request
---
Which is why there were nerfs 1 month and 1 week after their launches :) because everyone was having such a grand time playing the game and there was clearly "balance"
---
Not a bug this interaction is coded the same way that drawing a secret with ancient mysteries with a transmogrifier on board results in a 0 cost legendary.
---
Since the recent patch I‚Äôve been seeing way less murlocs. Without amalgam it feels like you‚Äôre totally all in on hitting brann / megasaur which is pretty inconsistent.
---
I just put him in PW not because he was good but because his animation and voiceline are clean asf.
---
"I can no longer play Galakrond Shaman to farm easy wins. Now that I am losing, the meta is bad and I hate it. Also anyone who doesn't play decks I play has no brain or skill"
---
Malygos is a super fun card if you just want to deckbuild highly recommend him, and if you have the dust handlock right now is competitive enough.
---
Imagine being born one of a handful of mythical and epically powerful creatures...but wax.
---
Hopefully they're animated like golds but normal coloured.
---
What‚Äôs more frustrating about the card, as a mobile-only player, is that Nozdormu even exists. Since Dragon Queen Alex can now create a 0 mana version of him, my opponent slaps him down with whatever else we got, and I have to someone deal with everything super fast, with animations for everything. 
---
Fuck Nozdormu. He‚Äôs not fun
---
That would be to close to gambling and not allowed.
---
What i say that i dont think that invoke should be the main mechanic in DoD because if you dont make galakron deck there no new mechanic for you i think it should be side mechanic
---
But did you remember Gormok the Impaler, Gazlowe, or Akali the Rhino?
---
You get what you fucking deserve.
---
It can introduce some rng to taunt divine shield breaking late game. Sell your Brann, buy it and have 50% chance of saving your giant divine shield mech

Doesn't mean it's not bugged; that was just my experience

was reposted from hs circle jerk

Not if they aren't looking to buy packs for the current expansion and are saving for the next one

can we rotate this years expansions out instead of the previous one?
---
Just remember those cards in the bundle will be rotating out of Standard next expansion, so depending on what game mode you play your money could be wasted pretty soon.

How could anyone support the HOFing of the ultimate rager? I'm shaking and crying right now.

At least Gormok was nuts in zoo
---
The boogeymonster
---
Also, the double legends that hunter got, both the 4/2s
---
Im running a similar deck but struggling around rank 4, but some questions on the differences.
---
1. How important is snipsnap, i just came back to hearthstone and dont want to craft him if hes meh, if hes good for the deck, how are you trying to use him?
---
2. Why 2 mortal coils instead of just 1?
---
3. Why sunfury &gt; doomsayer? I always feel the deck has alot of taunts already so sunfury is often a dead card for me
---
Nice winstreak
---
Would be a shame if you matched vs your worst matchup with a god-tier hand 3 times in a row!
---
This happened because I had the anomaly ‚Äúafter a minion dies, shuffle it into its owners deck‚Äù and the treasure ‚Äúafter you cast a spell summon a minion from your deck‚Äù along with a lot of handbuff and shudderwock nonsense
---
At one point I had a 34/57 shudderwock that had a Deathrattle that I think was something like ‚Äúsummon 6 stegodons and 4 minions that cost (1) more‚Äù
---
Yes
---
I was a new player not long ago and I did find this confusing initially. Maybe it should draw draw another card for new players, but I guess we figure it out soon enough.
---
\*Deep-fried Thomas the Tank Engine theme song starts playing\*
---
Yeah he‚Äôs definitely a solid card but not core to the deck. Possibly another twisting nether, although I never found twisting nether to be particularly useful. Maybe a second evasive drakinoid? Godfrey is usually just a twisting nether on a 4/4 body if used correctly.
---
I see. Because I saw a post before where a guy said that he didn‚Äôt get a legendary although he opened 10 GVG packs which he never opened before.

Played my first ranked game in over a year yesterday, faced this utter cancer,  goodbye again ranked mode
---
The only worse feeling is being tag-teamed by 2 other players while they rotate free wins versus a ghost.
---
1.) I run drakonid mostly because it is just another solid activator for stuff like crazed netherwing, and nether breath. Also discounting it to 5 is good, I feel like khartut might be to slow? Im not sure though ive never tried it, turn 6 for me is almost always an abyssal summoner which is like a 8/8 taunt or more, and drakonid is really solid on curve. Drakonid also very good against rogue, and shaman due to it being 7 health and awkward to trade with, but for rogue they've most likely used their sap on your mountain giant or abyssal summoner or they've lost already. 
---
2.) To be honest Leeroy has won me a ton of games. Sometimes you dont draw frizz and cant maly combo; and leeroy (6) + nether breath (4) + double soulfire (8) if you dont discard one combos for the same damage as the maly combo without relying on the frizz discount. 
---
3.) I honestly maybe used twisting nether once well, versus shaman after they used shudderwock, otherwise is seemed like a dead card most of the time because when your playing the deck correctly you should have full control of the board by turn 7/8. You‚Äôre opponent will most likely be spending most of their mana trying to remove your big stuff, and if you have lost that tempo you probably will have lost the game already.
---
Zzeraku when I have tried it has just felt too slow, and if you have time to play it you have probably won already any, or are winning by a huge margin. Sometimes I even struggled to get Valdris Felgorge? I think its called, down on the board in some matchups. Most of the time I used him It was to find lethal or an out. But Ill defintely try it.
---
Volgar Homunculi
---
I can't wait to don my twirly mustache and lay out some nefarious plots alongside the League of EVIL.
---
It was me! I asked him for some advice a few days ago and it actually helped a ton. Every play asking how does this get punished was the key thing for me, as well as slowing down.
---
Fun fact: killing Nozdormu resets the turn timer.
---
What about adding zephrys for a last ditch finisher?
---
I feel like it's such and easy fix. Like it could just be one condition:
---
if (health - attack) &gt; 0: do poison_animation.exe
---
But it's probably more complicated than this. Who knows what spaghetti code they have there.
---
Let's just skip all the animations. Let's make hearthstone into a text based game.
---
Do they combine into Void Lord? Why aren't we funding this?
---
Face hunter wasn't good for years since gadgetzan tho
---
Let's skip text, let's just get an MMR depending on how much time we have the app open.
---
Nope.‚Äã I‚Äã won the‚Äã game.
---
You guys actually have a choice? For me, the other 2 cards are so unplayably bad that I‚Äôd rather have a vanilla 5 drop 5/5.
---
Mines pink wonder why yours is red
---
If you care not for the competitive viability, then only you can answer this question. No one else can tell you what you can or will find fun.
---
Thanks for answering! Has the meta settled to the point that it‚Äôs safe to craft a deck?
---
You think you're safe?
---
Get got bru
---
This is not a glitch.
---
Well there is several. there some that hates the resurrection mechanic, the ones who complain about big Priest, ect
---
And the damn carrots. Those carrot animations are currently in slow-mo
---
This deck looks like a lot of fun
---
Yeah someone pitched this idea a couple of weeks ago
---
Mac donald
---
I've wanted to play Highlander Hunter. It's just so many legendaries :/
---
I think that one would be fine if there were a way to do them all concurrently, but I understand that might be hard with interactions like khadgar.
---
r/doggohate
---
So does bringing him back to hand. You see this infinite turn thing a lot in Hysteria videos. Play Nosdormu, bring him back, timer restarts and can play many more cards.
---
i agree. all the status effects that you can get on murlocs iverall makes themmop. divine shield poison on all your murlovs is basically unstoppable
---
Umbrella.
---
The commander he is playing is DANCING Daryl. When you sell a minion, he gives two random minions in the tavern +1/+1. It is referred to as dancing.
---
Get outta here u phony
---
Oh oh gotcha. Didn‚Äôt even notice the hero until you said that. Thanks mister/missus
---
Deryl needs to be rotated or nerfed.
---
...the triple gave me Shifter Zerus which transformed into Junkbot on the first turn. O\_O
---
Blizzard thought +2/+2 was enough since priest is weaker the card needed a liiiiiiittle boost
---
Elune give me strength!
---
Yeah? A 9 mana 8/8 with battlecry: glitch the game is a nice dragon to pull?
---
I've been. playing a similar list with Armorsmiths, one of my long time favorite Warrior cards, instead of the Aggro cards (Kor'ren, Rampage).  It destroys Face Hunter.
---
I like firetree witchdoctor instead of sunfuries. Warlock spells arent universally good but you can get some outs and keep your handsize.
---
Tell that to big/ress priest players
---
I think rafaam is still top tier. The most common picks now is picking nzoth buff or kaboombot in the beginning, so rather than everyone going murlocs before, you go for deathrattle stuff.
---
Rafaam is basically taking advantage of each metas dominant strategy and does them more consistently. The amount of time I get golden squid and kaboombot is pretty high. At 8.2k mmr for what it's worth.
---
A.F. Kay clicker...
---
So just because you perceive the deck to be easy, nobody must be allowed to play it?
---
Are you complaining about the new player/returning player experience, or are you actually just salty that you lose against everyone you encounter in ladder? Because it really looks like you are just venting here, thinking you deserve to win against those players just because they chose to play an aggro deck.
---
Considering you hard counter the class, seeing Hunter is probably why you aren‚Äôt still 16
---
If you have nothing to play you are tapping.  You have heals buried in your deck to uncover and making mountain giants playable. Tap away!
---
I believe they are all fundamental. I play an highlander mage, and everyone has its reason. Reno works for aggro and kalecgos for late game. Malygos is less important imo but in this meta it is pure gold (I usually rely on him for the 1 cost polymorph since deathrattle rogue is a thing right now and resurrect priests are feeding on hunters)
---
what, did Patches fly above your head?
---
He's already nerfed. You can't play as Daryl on mobile cuz IT'S FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE
---
Godfrey is core, but I understand people nkt wanting to craft him 4 months before he rotates
---
The effort that went into the blurring and blocking eyes is amazing. I love it.
---
I think theres a reason why it's not as easy as it seams. I'm wondering what would happen if theres a card with an effect of "Deathrattle: if this minion dies by poison, do X".
---
But he‚Äôs so broken that even dancing poorly on mobile is better than picking like 90% of other heroes.
---
"*Im playing a worse deck than my opponents, wich means im morally and intelectually superior because of not chosing the easy path. I deserve to win by default, because clearly im better than them if we were in an equal ground, that I cant because they play really expensive 2000 dust decks*"
---
OP post summariced.
---
Or coin dagger into Lost in the jungle.
---
Mage is actually in a horrible spot. At least priest is good against face decks and has combo. Mage is only good at getting lucky sometimes :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
People always say this and it's wrong.  Patches would be considerably stronger if he wasn't on your deck. The deck thinning is such a minor upside compared to the massive disadvantage of mulliganing into him. If he started outside your deck he'd be even more insane
---
They used to, but after that mage card from KnC they made it into a keyword which says that it draws a card in the hover text (you can see it if you look at the history).
---
If it worked with battlecries it would be more than enough to have an equally strong turn right after theirs
---
Yeah, it's purpose was to be a bad rare so the good rares pool was diluted.
---

---
Like when people hover over your portrait it says something cool or fun like "The Destroyer" or "Murloc Lover." Make some of them unlocked through player stats and some of them purchaseable.
---
I am not entirely sure if Valdris is necessary. I wish I could see how many times I played him in my run, but like I have said earlier with some other cards, usually if you do play him you are already in control of the game or you are just looking for an out for lethal, which was the case for me most of the time I played him. Making your mountain giants cost 2 or 3 mana and your abyssal summoners 11/11's is really strong.
---
he spammed your soul shall suffer so its not like he was nice to me either :^(

Did you know you can make it to legend with that deck if you take your face and bang it against your keyboard enough times?
---
But for real tho, nice job!
---
Huck you, Funter.
---
It's still played a ton in wild without charge. If patches was tied to a slow or bad tribe like ogres he might be a bit weaker. But pirates are already competitive minions with fair costs. Take any of the playable pirates and add an extra charge body on it as a battle cry and you have the best one drop in the game by a lot. Alley cat and lost in the jungle are both extremely good one drops. What if your alley cat also equips a 1/3 weapon, or if it also added a random card to your hand. Also the tag is relevant. Even a deckhand without charge and a 1/1 without charge for 1 is just better than basically every other 1 drop in the game. Flame imp that's harder to answer and no downside
---
Not in wild my friend, also watch Thijs pull it off rather successfully in legend
---
Sounds like a cool idea. Definitely a good way to practice üëç

---
At least unlike Karazhan, this isn‚Äôt in place of an expansion; it‚Äôs supplemental, meaning that we don‚Äôt have a 6-month gap where the meta barely changes because, surprise, three dozen or so cards didn‚Äôt change the Shamanstone meta at the time (and in fact gave them Spirit Claws).
---
Dont play that shit deck. Dont do that to yourself, you deserve better
---
Especially on mobile, when I'm away from my PC I play on mobile, and its eats up seconds I need to play my cards. The triple animation, and magnetic all seem super slow when the rope is at its end
---
Cards like Malygos, Aspect of Magic *will* find a home in a playable deck even if that home doesn't exist right now.
---
Even then, anything reasonable can be made to work in Wild.
---
Kft was all free
---
Shame you had to sink to face hunter to do it but fair play.
---
You get cards to use in ranked though
---
Is anyone playing espionage lately or is it too slow? I made a deck and it is fun, but espionage just isn't popular and I think It should be now that stowaway is in standard.
---
Can't be like arena, and packs are irrelevant to a game mode that doesn't need it. Cosmetics is probably the only way to go about it. But not sure how they do that when each hero has their own names. Maybe some kind of animated version.
---
deck link?
---
Priest is generally very annoying to play against when it‚Äôs good. Blizzard throws long term Priest fans a bone every once in a while, but typically speaking they‚Äôre careful not to allow the class to be anywhere close to top tier.

Galakrond Warlock is quite strong for a budget deck.
---
No, he sees *your* face.
---
xd censor meme
---
You are correct. I am dumb lol
---
Only if the decklist was in English
---
You do realize how OP it would be right?
---
Yep
---
Because holy wrath paladin isn‚Äôt one-dimensional. At least you can destroy the copies of Shirvallah as a rogue, but other than that paladin plays his own card-drawing game.
---
I'm not sure its still true but after reaching 25 you still need to open a wild pack or buy a free wild adventure.
---
If you are that low wild isnt for you. Its a creazy place really. Ive died many times on turn 3. Learn to play and get decent cards first
---
Fair enough. I just like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.
---
You're assuming the MMR system would remain.
---
How ironic after this topic yesterday:  
---
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/eedm4j/why_is_righteous_protector_in_battlegrounds/  
---
\^This is why.
---
Try playing the deck before commenting.
---
You'd be a FUUL to not have GRUUL the best legendary in the game.
---
Did I accidentally take a wrong turn and ended up in 2014? Cause ever since then the deck is like that. X beats Y. Y beats Z. Z beats X...
---
&gt;Time rip is an overpriced removal in a class known for removal. Rogue doesn't have power word cards, expensive single target removal is part of its identity as a tempo class. 
---
Time Rip is also the only unconditional single target removal spell Priest has ever had and having it also have "generate a card" is pretty good for what it is. If Siphon Soul can see play, there's really no reason why Time Rip can't.
---
&gt;Breath of the infinite is an ok at best board clear in a class known for board clears. 
---
For the price, Priest and the other classes do not have better a better rate than three mana for two damage to all enemy minions on the Standard table. Plus it is seeing play in Quest Priest already despite it apparently being "okay at best."
---
&gt;Murozond the infinite is a shudderwock/Tess/zuljin which only takes one turn worth of effects and doesn't even replay the battlecries of any minions. The mentioned 3 are win conditions in their respective decks while Murozond is a risky, slow card with no immediate impact. 
---
Tess also doesn't replay battlecries, and needs a whole deck built around it to really work. The only thing stopping Morozond form seeing serious play is the deck that would play it, Control/Value Priest, hasn't really materialized.
---
&gt;Grave rune is good but doesn't have a core deathrattle deck to be in but is one of the better cards for sure 
---
Grave Rune targeting a Convincing Infiltrator or Khartut Defender is really all you need. There are even twenty-four damage Leeroy Combos possible when using Fate Weaver.
---
&gt;You're bending the effects of these cards to positively compare them to other classes when in reality they are just mediocre cards. 
---
I'm really not bending anything, and you also seem to be forgetting Quest Resurrect Priest is an early standout deck post-nerf, and it plays many of the apparently mediocre cards Priest has gotten this year like Sandhoof Waterbearer.
---
I agree
---
Normal game but you start with 1000 health
---
was playing as rogue against a pally, had a 5/4 cutlass on and had to time it right cause i was scared of him using a plate breaker and then a hammer to the face.
---
Triangle formats generally aren't uncommon in card games.
---
It is decent enough. Big problem is that he doesn't really synergize with the handlock gameplan.
---
zuljin vs hagatha? what is this, rise of shadows?
---
Well, this person didn't have a nefarian in the game.
---
It's a choice you can make based on the match.
---
And that's the problem I have with that deck. You won't draw it often and then you're dead in the water, pun intended.
---
Should I position my Cobalts in the first and second positions?
---
Quest Priest is a good deck to use if you are matched against a lot of Face Hunter.  Kibler hit legend earlier this week with a 66% win-rate. But you know, Kibler is Kibler.

There's not really any reason for them to be at the start over the end, though. 
---
There might not be a big difference, but it still would be a little bit better.

These dynamic graphs. So hot right now.
---
Lagely agree - but primarily I just want regular big changes to keep the mode fresh, and the amalgam removal genuinely changed things up, as it was such a huge card - there will always be a 'most efficient' way to build...if it stays as one thing for too long it will get stale.
---
Which one is the aggro version? Btw can i add you on the game?
---
Im not certain I've ever even heard of "zetalot". Is it that surprising that people come up with the same decks? There aren't that many cards in standard that fill the same roles.
---
Played this to Rank 5 before last expansion. Hopefully it's a little help.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Was playing the purely aggro version last night, you do have to stall to get the combo, but I've won games where I had to wait till turn 9 to get it online, and if you draw properly you win by turn 6
---
quest res priest is pretty good.
---
Currently 7/3 with mine, but that's just  at rank 15 to 13. Whelp + Zili is pretty clutch. Gala saving me from OTK pally then flik to seal the deal. 
---
Beats priest most of the time, haven't gone up against much face hunter yet so not sure how it'll fair. 
---
Lots of fun, I love utilizing lackeys and they offer a bit of the fun rng of burgle, but definitely more consistent.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve personally unlocked all four Sr. Explorer treasures on Heroic just while having fun playing Hearthstone.  
---
Same. I stopped after beating it with all the heroes because it felt like there wasn't much else to do.
---
Wow, just wow...
---
This is still by far the best job of censoring I've ever seen on the sub...didn't forget the skulls, didn't forget the friends list, pixelated the tavern owner's name...

Zetalot has regularly over 1k viewers every day on Twitch. He is the player with the most played games as priest in the world, 32.000+. That deck you showed is his. He was playing that deck months ago, 10 hours a day. He included batterhead in ress priest before everyone else. You probably saw that deck from Thjis who at least admitted that it is not his deck but Zetalot‚Äôs. Giving credit to the person that created that deck is fair i think.Have a good nightz
---
Check solems YouTube video on the subject. Kobolds and knights are the best
---
Please please please, I need to see this. The BM levels are gonna be through the roof.
---
Man I‚Äôve been playing Galakrond Warrior since release and now I feel like just another guy punching face.
---
Facehunter is a joke, cheap, easy, fast. Took me 20 -30 min to get from 15 to 10 lvl. I'm the problem.
---
Please update us on this duel of epic proportions when it takes place!!
---
It's perfect! It's so cool to see decks visualized like this. Thank you!
---
This looks really nice :) The timeline at the bottom might be a little small though, it took me a while to figure out what I was looking at
---
balance isn't really the point. a hearthstone (regular) deck could have a card in it that says start of game: you can't win the game normally. on turn 10, win 50% of the time, and it would be "balanced", even underpowered, but it would be terrible game design. AFKay is less extreme, but it's similarly wonky design for rewarding players for doing nothing (both AFKs opponents on turn 1 and 2 and AFK herself on turn 3 and 4).
---
What are you playing? I have not played that much galakrond shaman since the nerf, maybe 7 or 8 and only lost to one of them. I think the deck is way weaker so it might be the deck you are playing is more susceptible to what galakrond shaman is doing.
---
Yeah im not an idiot
---
How would you get two mama bears turn 4?
---
very cheap deck "Faze Hunter deck" to destroy F2P
---
I have a variation that always wins mirror matches and still beats aggro
---
it got better, people just need to wait the fuck up.
---
im facing a lot of warriors and rogues on rank 5-1 actually.
---
there are still 35 cards missing.
---
when nothing changes on mid january, then you can rewake your salt and im going to join you.
---
I do believe the meme does not intent to take context from the movie.
---
What the fuck did you just say about me, you little bitch?
---
First i played trump kind of dragon druid, then i played aggro treant druid, now i was playing pirate warrior. Maybe i am bad at the game
---
Yup that's me, probably am the only one who runs sense Demons and abysaal summoner in this deck, was it rank 15?
---
Probably not
---
Thief priest is why priest was my favorite class when I started playing. It‚Äôs typically too slow to beat face hunter but i did manage to play 5 life drinkers all stolen from my opponents hunter deck to beat him. It had to be one of my favorite moments of recent HS. It was also probably my opponents least favorite moment. I might be a sadist.
---
sorry partner, perfect run only counts if you take no damage
---
focus on one deck, take notes why and how you lost against which class. watch hearthstone streamer like thjis and welcome to dad legend rank 5
---
If they were at the end all the taunts would die before they even battled lol
---
The start is the only place that makes sense
---
What deck list are you running? Trying to get some more Druid wins in, about 60 games away from Golden hero portrait.
---
No problem my friend!  I hope you live happily with it and Happy Birthday
---
Totally agree with this, do Wild Secret Mage! I think it is a much more rewarding experience for a new player when they actually win games. This list is good  [https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/decks/secret-mage-wild-meta-snapshot-aug-16-2019](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/decks/secret-mage-wild-meta-snapshot-aug-16-2019) \- you can swap Ice Block for another secret if you don't have it, or \[\[Eater of Secrets\]\] to help with mirrors. I think \[\[Aluneth\]\] is essential but your wife can try the deck out with an Arcane Intellect first, and craft Aluneth if she likes the deck.
---
Resurrect priest making a comeback with all these face decks gaining momentum. Can‚Äôt wait to play Res priest mirrors again. It‚Äôs like a poor mans Big priest deck.

Thanks a lot!
---
Can you send me a link to that?
---
The meta changed. Are you actually that stupid or just trolling?
---
Why would something from an old meta ever be seen as proof of something for a completely different meta?
---
Take your burden of proof and shove it up your ass or you can pass it along to another one of you Reddit neckbeards who do or say that kind of shit.
---
I‚Äôm telling you like it is. You come and say pro tier lists would prove me wrong and then you provide a fucking blog made for noobs and say some nooby shit. I couldn‚Äôt care less to correct you or provide you evidence. Go learn for yourself or remain stupid.
---
I think it'd be better if the x axis scale was static rather than changing it to match the most popular deck
---
Were they dire frenzied also?
---
Q is the shirt vsn
---
Compared to the rest of the set. They're all great but there was no fanfare for these cards during prerelease.
---
It was an extremely popular day 1 deck
---
So what beats warriors?
---
Personally it's because most of the decks I've played want the weapon removal to be cheap.
---
Not a bad card by any means. I like it. But the big reasons I'd include weapon stealing are for necrium blade and ancharr, which I want gone before turn 5. That paired with also wanting another action that turn means it's hard to fit the card in. If it's turn 7 I'd rather be able to play a spellbreaker, swipe, brawl, crazed netherwing, etc alongside it rather than be limited to 2 mana and a plain 4-4, even with a weapon charge.
---
I do plan on experimenting with it though! Thats just my thought process

&gt;I am however interested in how Zetalot was using a card "months ago" when said card has only been out for a few weeks.
---
Just like how zetalot invented the priest deck in this topic, he also invented a time machine.
