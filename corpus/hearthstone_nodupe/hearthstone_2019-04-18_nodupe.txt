Messenger Raven is not a 3 drop. You'd be pretty sad to play it on 3. 
---

---
The list seems to be build to be more proactive. You want minions to support that, not more draw.
---
I'd say probably not. Blizzard didn't mention any new games modes this year (which is kind of ridiculous) but the fact they are rotating certain cards from past sets into arena is intriguing. It makes me wonder if they are playing with arena a bit to experiment before making any changes to standard (to see how the community responds). I wouldn't be surprised down the line if they come up with some sort of 'Tier' format (maybe similar to MTG?) that allows for certain past cards to be played. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
MTG had quite a few sets if I recall before a major tier system went into effect but when I played if I recall there was type 1, 1.5, 2 and extended (or something like that). Now it's apparently legacy (any set), vintage (back to 2003), modern and standard - with some cards banned entirely (since Blizzard can nerf live, don't think there's any reason to go there).
---
I would like to see something similar in HSTONE though. Wild which is essentially Legacy is pretty hard for new players to get into given the massive collection you need, but it'd be neat to see something that rotates every expansion and includes certain sets/cards as part of that 'standard' set. And maybe have different legendary card backs to entice play?
---
EVERYONE GET IN HERE
---
Wow I've never had even 2 legendaries in the same pack...
---
It is the highest Win Rate deck.
---
No you didn't, you said it was a mistake LOL
---
Ahh I see the issue here. For some reason, you think your feelings and opinions about a meta matter. They don't, the meta is the meta.
---
You can spend all day in fairyland saying this would be different in a different meta, but that's crap. We don't have a different meta.
---
Mech hunter has a 54% winrate, it is a viable deck regardless of what you think.
---
I've played that deck and warrior is actually one of it's worse matchups, they're one of the only classes that can deal with up to 3 Nomis and if they're the bomb variant they can easily kill you in fatigue by shuffling some bombs in your deck.
---
I love not having to make a deck. Hate randomized. Just comes down to who gets less shit useless cards.

Oh.. i realised the focus was his 66k dust. Sorry about that.

Awww did someone get made fun of on the internet?
---
Not according to HSReplay. Not by a lot. 
---
Zoolock is the highest WR deck in Legend to 5. Then control Warrior, then Tempo Rogue.
---
This is not true. 
---
Classes in Arena are balanced two ways: Bucketting and Microadjustments. Basically Blizzard decided to rebucket cards for every class except for Rogue, but issued a microadjustment to Rogue.
---
This means, as stated in the original post, "overperforming Rogue cards will be seen less frequently."
---
Maybe you’ve collected all the Legendaries from the classic set?
---
I might play hearthstone again if that were to happen.
---
It happens if you have all the legendaries of that expansion
---
You can open duplicates if you have all legendaries from that expansion.  (Ex; all classic legendaries lets you open a duplicate classic legendary.)
---
Maybe they will revert the nerf to big game hunter to 3 mana again so you can tech the card, or will introduce a crab minion that target elemental in next 2 set.
---
For now you have to mulligan for specific card combo like warrior execute and someway to damage it or armor + shield slam, 
---
if you're running murloc deck ,use the toxfin combo.
---
Priest/Mage/Shaman and Rogue have access to cheap spell that can get rid of them. It's warrior,hunter ,paladin and druid that currently have trouble with their card because they need more turns.
---
not debating that token isnt broken but...
---
Keeper of the Grove, Ancient of Lore, Force of Nature, Innervate, Wild Growth, Nourish, Naturalize got all nerfed or hofed.
---
I think that's enough
---
Meta will slow down with time and OTK decks will start emerging again. But for now I don't see any usage of it.
---
Maybe you should be playing a fighting game then. The beauty of card games is maximizing the RNG, that's what makes a player better than another. You can't guarantee wins, but you can maximize your odds.
---
Mooooom, Alleria's taken Vereesa's Thori'dal and isn't giving it back! I have a tree to burn down in half an hour!

I will pick disguisedtoast. Oh wait...
---
Al'akir - Can attack immediately(including heroes), can attack twice in one turn, the first time this minion takes damage all damage is ignored, enemy minions cannot attack your hero while this minion is on the board.
---
I skipped Rasta entirely, so bring em on!
---
Go on HSreplay or VS DRlive and look at its individual winrates. Mech hunter loses to every aggro deck... bad. Once news gets out, it is going to have to change drastically or die.
---
It's viable *now*. I doubt that will last. Handbuff Hunter was viable week 1 of MSOG too. I know. I played it then. Then everyone discovered Pirates.

I came back after a 9 month break. Don't have much of the last two expansions (the free legendaries basically).

Blingtron only gives you standard weapons if you play him in standard mode, even if you got him from Toki.

Same. :/

I was much the same. Played first couple of expansions and then missed a fair few so had a small collection. Was an easy decision.

I really love what Blizzard does with the card in game quotes. I play this game so much that I can actually watch Hearthstone by listening to it and know what’s happening by imagining the board.

Well if they provided epic protection I might consider coming back to the game: I've been playing the last few days after being gone since last August checking out rotation and I heard there had been some positive changes.
---
Looks like business as usual to me. 
---
After Magic arena did epic and legendary protection equivalents HS feels behind the curve IMO. Hope they change it.

He could but when he can he might have other minions in the deck.

Good to know Bomb Warrior has a real place in WoW lore.

I agree, though it is very luck-based and depends on the opponent's cards. For example, if you face Warlock, you'll are in for a lot of discards/self damage.
---
No
---
Ya that kind of low roll sucks. Ive had it hit 3 spells once on turn 2 (deck only runs 5 other spells) and that pretty much lost me the game on the spot.

Maybe he is trying to cheat somehow.
---
Does keeping a twitch tab open count :)
---
Well, the whole new expansion brought Catarina and Archmage into the deck - in the past there were decks after a new expansion that included fewer new cards.

That's never failed for me with other games that do twitch drops.

Ah yes, the "value" being that every 4th epic you can craft a different epic. Amazing value.

Thanks. She looks awesome, just hsreplay doesn't have much data on her.

Their dust system sucks. It wouldn't be obsolete, anyway. There are still legendaries to craft.
---
Not unreasonable, just lucky. I likely would have had Ysera at ~47
---
I played only Warrior on two accounts as well, played Akali on turn 8 three times, and on all three there were no rush minions in the deck. Are these decks just randomly generated groups of cards?

7 p.m. to 3 a.m. edt is 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. cest btw.

Oof

Which is insane.

Before the expansion, Big Priest was over powered. It was already annoying playing 10 in a row, but what why wouldnt people play it? 
---
That greatly changed the popularity and how everyone else responded to it.
---
The new expansion just pushed it so very far into the wrong direction. It reinforced every awful aspect. Idc thats its overpowered. I care that Wild ladder is ruined.

I've been playing for a while, but how the hell am I supposed to counterplay mill rogue? I hate that deck with a burning passion but I don't want to constantly run aggro decks out of fear of running into it.

Janalai was the best card in odd mage, since it would always be active on curve. Post-baku it’s hard to justify running it imo. I have a deck with khadgar and janalai, and I don’t think Ive ever pumped out two rags at the same time.

Makes sense. Twinspell is part of the card text, and Counterspell seems to counter any and all card text, including Overload. So Twinspell being countered as well doesn't surprise me. That's a heck of a lot of value from Counterspell.

TL;DR; Play Murlocs, kill your opponent.

True, since he has archivist. Dr. Boom hero cards is also insanely good right now.

Dry, I know this post was bad it's because I had to do it from my phone ( I couldn't screen shot unless the cards were like that) anyways I know tak isn't the best, it was a joke because of my absurd rng ( if you can't tell he gave me 2 prophet velons, a 5 damage dealing spell that I forgot the name of, and I already had a mind blast)

I’m failing to see why you think Bomb Warrior is particularly any better against Highlander than other types of decks. If that’s your *perception*, then why not simply add more weapons removal? Archivist Elysianna?

If you copied a minion that already attacked with his rush i don't think you can attack it's like copying a silenced minion.. it will appear silenced. Correct me if i'm wrong.

Ah yes I forgot that the 5th use of Witch's Brew does 5 healing, and in this case, damage. nice Easter Egg Dr. Boom

With all the zilliax running around I've had some success just using him for that, especially if they've attached it to something else. He's a bit like Harrison in that way. A good card, not mandatory, you won't always have a slot, but good to keep in your back pocket

I’ve preordered every expansion since whispers of the old gods and it feels like every time there’s one random epic card that I keep opening. During boomsday I got around 6 or 7 academic espionages. Or the time I got 8 Snowfury giants.  
---
It’s really obnoxious and a terrible feeling and I’d love for this change to be made, but I doubt they ever will. Hell, I’d even be ok if they limited it to 4 copies you could have in your collection just so they don’t keep stacking up.
---
Grats!!

I agree, they should remove the mech tag off of it so that it can’t be randomly generated.

You're totally correct, I was actually thinking of walk the plank but I couldn't get the blasted name right. Not quite used to the newer xpacs as I've not played much HS since frozen throne so names and the like can be a bit rough (at least 2 mistakes in 1 post, shameful).
---
And yeah warlock is from what I've heard sitting up there at #2 winrate pretty easily, but it's kind of to be expected. You've got a good host of solid zoo cards in rotation, the 2 god tiers of voidcaller and enforcer, and when board clears are rare the value of tap skyrockets as other classes can't keep up in the 2 for 1 game.

I think he is saying that once you have 2 bombs it turns off the Highlander aspect of your deck and cards like Reno doesn't work anymore.
---
Is bomb warrior that big of a problem in wild? I haven't played wild since the set released.
---
I wanna make this now
---
Bunnyhoppor this time again !
---
Someone did this to me while I played yogg druid but jokes on them I had ice block.
---
Sooo could i replace edwin with it or not ?
---
Maybe because they add bombs to your deck, and often more than one which make your requirement to activate reno, kazak, Raza, and else useless?
---
Weapon removal won't change a things they have other way to give you those bomb and they are still able to attack when the weapon is equipped so even if for some fucked up reason a bomb warrior decide to play only the weapon, it will give you 2 bomb, one more than needed for highlander cards. 
---
Archivist Elysian rekt your own game plan...
---
The requirement is NO Duplicate 
---
You either don't know the highlander cards or didn't think about what was the deck at all before posting 
---
Hope that ll help you see why
---
I would not dust a classic card but tbh I never played him when The Lich King was in standard, so I don't see myself playing it any more now.
---
What meta taunt minion is threatening enough to spend 6 mana and a deck slot on a tech nowadays ? Hecklebot ? Lucentbark ? All I can think of is a Zilliax-ed big mech but that's a stretch imo.
---
Oh, yes it's really good
---
Mech hunter and destroy them.
---
The no duplicate rule should extend to all the cards. 
---
There are 49 different common cards, there should be no reason for me to open 12 different copies of Dalaran Crusader when opening my 25 packs at the start of a new expansion
---
Aviana's effect is the first *card you play*, while Kalecgos is the first *spell you cast*. When a spell is countered, you played a card but didn't cast the spell. Though yeah, some of those listed in the report definitely seem inconsistent.
---
That's completely absurd.
---
If anything the game is "Pay to have diversity" or "pay to meme" its super easy to get multiple top tier decks as a f2p player for every expansion.
---
No, I don't want to play roulette
---
I save it anyway until I either need a card to win this turn or I need a card to not die this turn.
---
I never just use tracking unless I mulliganed it and its my turn 1play.
---
Rogue is strong but token druid is the king right now
---
Congrats. Can you provide the deck list please?
---
Agreed!! We need this, would help a lot even if all the other issues stayed the same.
---
The pricing for this game is pretty crazy. However, I don't think spending 20 dollars a month on something you enjoy is that bad. Sure, in the grand scheme of things its a waste of money, but I work so I can pay bills and do things I enjoy doing in my free time, which is Hearthstone(among a lot of other video games lol)
---
I would be fine with even a % likelihood penalty for cards you have at least two of. Something like -10% chance of getting a specific card. That way they can keep their financial making model for profiting of duplicates but it won't feel so bad because you're unlikely to have 5+ of any single card.
---
Is this at every Dunkin in Korea or only some?
---
DD isn’t that good in the States either. Terrible doughnuts, I don’t get why anyone who lives near a local bakery or in a city of any sort would ever get DD other than strict convenience. I pass like 4 doughnut food trucks every day in Chicago, all of which are radically better than DD for maybe a buck more per doughnut.

A similar discussion of not even 1 day old:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/beeupx/you\_know\_what\_i\_opened\_like\_200\_packs\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/beeupx/you_know_what_i_opened_like_200_packs_still/)
---
Lots of Amani Warbears too
---
Kalecgos and Aviana aren't the same effect. They're checking for different things. "Play" and "Cast" have different rules meanings in Hearthstone. They are both working properly based on the wording. I explain the difference here. 
---
&gt; The wording on Counterspell itself is a bit funky now, but you're misunderstanding a couple things. Specifically with Mana Wyrm and Questing Adventurer.
---
&gt; Those two cards are checking for completely different things. Casting a spell in Hearthstone is functionally a two-step process. There's the first part, where you attempt to cast the spell. This is the part that cards like Illidan and Questing Adventurer check for, and is why attempting to play any spell even if it gets countered will trigger them.
---
&gt; The second part is where the actual spell resolves and does whatever the text on the card states. This is the part that cards like Mana Wyrm and Gadgetzan Auctioneer check for. And if you look at the wording on Counterspell, it's the same as Auctioneer and Mana Wyrm. It's also checking for that second part, only its function is to prevent that second "casting" part from happening.
---
&gt; This also makes sense in the context of cards like Kalecgos, as described in the OP. He is checking for the second part as well, and because Counterspell prevents that, he won't consider a card as having been "cast."
---
&gt; Basically, all of these cards are currently worded consistently with each other, albeit with lots of ambiguity and unintuitiveness as to what "play" and "cast" actually mean. This is ignoring Counterspell of course.

If you pull Oondasta from Duel, can it proc the Overkill since it's your turn?
---
Added a comment. And thanks :)

My wife says "his voice is so soothing" I usually keep the volume low, and if I stir after I fall asleep I'll shut it off, but it's been a habit for probably 5 years now.

You heard it folks;

Grats I finally got legend the other day too after playing since closed beta! had a crazy win streak with RDUs version of mech hunter.
---
What's your definition of "competitive?"  It makes a huge difference in this conversation.  If you mean "can win more often than you lose and rank you up the ladder," that's what I call "functional."  If you mean "can build a full tournament line up and expect to do well," that's an entirely different beast.
---
If you do your daily quests for a year, you'll build up enough cards and dust to have a functional collection that lets you build at least a couple top decks and have plenty of pieces for more.  It's slow, but that's how F2P goes.  If you're looking to be the hyper-competitive player, you're likely playing enough that you can open 150 packs per expansion without trouble, and that's enough to build whatever you want.
---
I've dusted 4 or 5 during my time, don't regret dusting any of them.
---
Then just destroy Cho and play Espionage?
---
RIP
---
had to craft two of them today...
---
NICE
---
Mage outvalues warrior apparently, and makes them run out of removals.
---
On one hand, it’s a free pack. On the other hand, this is about as shitty a giveaway as it gets.
---
Man, whoever got those 3000 packs though.
---
And when you do, make sure you post it so I'll see it!
---
Wow guys look here, we found the one person who does not have a flatrate in 2019.
---
Don't you have flatrates?
---
Holy crap this field is STACKED.
---
They are still, as were DKs, ruining the balance of the game. So, tomato tomatoe, it all smells like shit
---
Don't worry, Blizzard will print a 5 mana 5/5 that destroys all 5 mana spells in your deck in the next expansion. We will all rejoice at the brilliant design.
---
Exactly.
---
Why the banker though?
---
They keep printing thief rogue cards, but the interaction doesn't work as it should?
---
Idk kinda looks like Pogo rouge
---
Que? It's been like that for like 3 years now
---
Remember cards like Etheral Conjurer in every Flamewaker Mage? Didn't need to run Flamestrike in your deck cause they just discover it! 
---
For some decks it doesn't matter anymore what 30 cards you run cause you'll just discover the perfect answer from some bullshit RNG discover card.
---
lmao. I find his voice a bit grating actually. Tho I am autistic, so I am a bit more sensitive to certain things like that, key board/mouse taps/clicks are super annoying, but tolerable for example.
---
It was a comment on the quality of Dunkin donuts, not this promotion.
---
Besides unless you're in South Korea you can't get this promotion anyway apparently.
---
They count as a druid and a rogue (and a shaman) card. So swash is checking through every card that counts as a druid card, and adding it to your hand.
---
Fencer is checking every card in your hand and asking "is this a rogue card or neutral card?" If the answer is no on any of those cards, it activates, however since this is a rogue card it just passes over it.
---
Even Dunkin' Donuts can reach legend...
---
And that is exactly the problem with every event, pack and gold rewards. Players feel like they are forced to participate and complain that they are not the target group for this specific event.
---
Just a common heal druid deck?
---
yeah if you enjoy bomb warrior or token druid &amp; pretend other classes don't exist.
---
On hsreplay the top big warlock deck has a winrate of 64%, top big priest deck has 61% wr. The problem is people were playing unrefined versions as its a new deck, but its really consistent. Just give it time, it will rise to popularity (and has at top ladder).

also on the first one ? ( i only drew one in the Tavern brawl and that was in the turn after i played LIW ) and how WildZeld pointed out it his first Bloom Bot costed 4 Mana after Luna's Pocket Galaxy.
---
Hold onto it, if you're F2P, you can dust it next rotation to craft the hall of fame cards for rewards, then craft it again normal when you get the dust back.
---
im in the heart of dunkin donuts land(new england), why dont they do this here :( thats sick though.
---
Yes it changed all of my bots into insane death machines, especially the ones that AOE'd
---
No, you need to spend another $200 to complete the set.
---
Twitch and pornhub would certainly have the infrastructure
---
Same Here
---
Imagine how broken this would be if witches brew had echo?!
---
No thanks, friends are bad for you
---
It isn't really even subpar content imo, people just go in expecting him to do some MLG pro strats when he does fun gimmicky shit instead. His videos are enjoyable if you know what to expect from him and still go watch it. Clickbait brings him more money, which is how he gets toast on the table. Until some more profitable method of making videos is figured out (spoiler: won't happen, people are stupid) he (and others) will continue making clickbaity videos.
---
Try to reach legend with your own homebrew deck without good cards that are used in netdecks, I wait :)
---
I'm sorry, i dont want to be patronising but you're wrong on this. 
---
Search Tree Diagrams and hopefully helps visually. 
---
But basically theres the first coin flip Offering two branching paths. 
---
Then theres a second filp that would offer 2 more branch paths on top of those inital paths. 
---
2X2 gives you 4 ways of getting to the end. The trick is realising that Getting a heads and then a tails,   or getting tails and then heads are NOT the same thing. They are unique outcomes offering a total of 4 outcomes.
---
Nah, I was mostly kidding.  I had the normal copies but the golden epic would have been nice.
---
Interesting bit of dust math that only relates to Hall of Fame: it's always worth crafting the golden commons because you get 10 dust/card.  You get the dust required to craft it back (400?) so that doesn't matter, and then you dust it again for 50, which is 10 higher than if you just kept the regular common.
---
There are a ton of guide posts about it though if you're interested.
---
I've decided to play Lucentbark Druid and while I'm not doing amazing with it so far it has been fun.  I'm sure once I get used to the meta and piloting the deck it will be great.  I just worry about a meta shift that might make teching silence more common as I feel like it would completely shut the deck down.
---
just to clarify , Roger didn't win that game but he let the other person win meaning it's still wintrading(to get points for tournament event). this was in April 2018.  6 months later in HGG , he along with another teammate , cheated by checking out the opponent view leading to his entire team getting DQ.  Blizzard only punish him for the HGG cheating incident because they have a hiccup in their communication process even though people complained about him participating in wintrading several months earlier before the big event. they replied their response to Roger cheating this year when we were about to get the new expansion revealed.  https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b36ruf/regarding_competitive_integrity_in_hearthstone/
---
If you don't have the resources to be able to craft some commons, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
If only al Akir is missing you can substitute him with Batterhead. And you definetly need to know what you are doing. Its not a Tier 1 deck.
---
Now introducing the new SFW PornHub video platform: YourHub! Instead of jerking off by yourself, go to the comment section to jerk off in a circle with others!

Nope. How many Odd Warriors did you see ascending to Legend?
---
Of the two near me, one had the posters up but I didn’t see any boxes and the mocha rolls weren’t in the HS wrappers, though I didn’t ask if they had them behind the counter. The other one had the boxes on display.
---
Math ain't your strongest point, right?  
---
There are 32 periods of giving 1.5k packs away.  
---
1500 * 32 = 48k

48000 * $1.5 = $72k

I suggest starting to take heroin instead.

Everyone in this thread is suffering from confirmation bias HARD. The criticism of increased randomness is legit. But random means random, and "dice roll wins are at an all time high" is obvously false. You only notice the high rolls and ignore or aren't aware of the low rolls.
---
Hmm. Yeah that's probably right for commons. Not for the other three rarities though right.
---
Okay now I'm confused. If I dust a legendary (+400) craft it golden, (-3200). I'm losing on that transaction right unless I dust the Golden Legendary as well after and never re-craft it.
---
I think we have made good moves towards “controlled RNG”.  Discover is great.
---
Bronce dragon is good as a deathrattle, no need to buff it to make it a battlecry. Of course they know its not going to be tier 1 op op, but think of it as how it works. The opponent can play arround the handbuff mechanic by ignoring it and forcing you to trade it, slowing down your hand buffs. Also, it may be just a 3/2 for 3, but he provides a lot of value. And if you are going with the "but the dragons it provide also cost 4 mana to play so its not free value", then cards like a 3/2 deathrattle: add 10 dragons to your hand woudl be busted, even if you still need to pay mana for those dragons later.
---
The good statline of a 3 drop is 3/4 or 4/3 so still, its not far from it. It can trade decently and provides a 4 mana on curve minion. It helps with the synergies of "if you have a dragon in hand" and also the new handbuff dragons synergies. We will get more paladin dragons for sure (its the year of the dragon after all) so expect this card to be used a lot in the future.
---
do not dust it.  You might not use it now, but as long as the classic sets in play youll be happy you have it.
---
Oh, I remember! Then you will easily win that bet. Zoo is ~Tier 1 and Secret Pally is ~Tier 3, I don't know what would need to happen for that to change.
---
As far as I'm aware, counter is only for spells atm. I think that would be fine, especially for Leeroy lol. Trump said it should also have card draw. When I made the card powerful odd/even decks were dominating the meta so I felt like since deathrattles can be Silenced, there should be an effect to counter battlecries.
---
Humm I might craft zillax then as I do have most of the other cards.
---
But you did draw it you liar. MOOOOOOOOOODS!!
---
Do Drops work while casting with Chromecast?  I am not sure how it works with that.

---
While there is lots of rng in hearthstone I wouldn’t say it is low skill ceiling. The best players can cruise through rank 5-legend with like 70% winrate. But I can see your point
---
I’ve said this in other comments but I’m talking more about their doughnuts and food being mediocre/bad. I don’t have an issue with their coffee. Convenience seems to be the only reason to eat at a DD when better and/or cheaper options exist.
---
Because it cost 0 mana, lol
---
Their last buff excluding reverting nerfs in molten giant was Naga Sea.
---
“90% RNG” 
---
Lol
---
Curious about this too because Chomecast 'disconnects' your phone client usually while it casts.

Idk if it’s possible , but a lot of burn to the face and maybe archivist when ur getting low on cards and high on bombs
---
So you're new to this sub. And instead of looking what's up in here you go ahead and blindly post something that doesn't belong here. But I'm the dick. K.
---
He’s wrong in equating 4 hours of effort to one pack since you don’t actually need to be watching. However, he’s right in stating that “lots of free packs” is a vast exaggeration on OP’s part.
---
If you're piloting Tempo Rogue to legend, I can spectate you and give you pointers on correct lines of play.
---
No the cardboard slip with the code on it for packs looks like a classic or legend card back - they only give packs in game.
---
I assumed it was "addled amateur".  "adult" doesn't really fit in with the rest since it's not an insult.
---
It is good cards, but it is no Ultimate Infesation level. And UI never got nerfed lol.

Hey any good deck builds for ranked?

North Sea Kraken, though it wasn’t a dragon.
---
For reference, I used Corruption on one of those things and the copied version also had the Corruption debuff and died the next turn.
---
Okay, I can't find the post I liked because reddit search isn't great.
---
For Hall of Fame, if you don't have the card craft golden.  If you do have it, don't craft golden unless you want a free upgrade or if it's a common card.  If you already have golden or, enjoy the free dust.
---
Your example is upgrading it to golden for free, but isn't how you maximize your dust profit.
---
Send an email to dunkin and let them know that theres interest outside of korea.
---
Probably wont do anything but it's a small amount of effort to try.
---

Rest assured, Blizzard has hired numerous shills (and they have many many brainless crusader retards) telling people to shut up about how fucking expensive the game is and just accept it. They ridiculous us, calling us "victim mentality" or other obvious bullshit.
---
I voted for Roger - two of his decks have the Undataker and looks like a fun lineup.
---
You're just having confirmation bias because that's the last card you see when a Rogue beat you and made you feel negative emotions. 
---
But it wasn't Leeroy Jenkins that killed you, it was the 5+ other great cards before it that put you in that position to be killed.
---
RemindMe! 5 days "log onto twitch"
---
By the log, it seems you played redemption, secret didnt activate (they had no minions, so it makes sense), then you attacked with a guy to face, then the enemy plays mechano egg, then you play a secret and the Never surrender activates then (because now they have a minion). This is how its supposed to work
---
Now, if they did have a minion in the board when you played redemption, that woudl be a bug, but with just this, there is no way to tell. So I will assume is just a confusion, you gotta show the board at least, so we can see what happened.
---
Cool card!

Playing any popular deck scum🤮🤮
---
Remind me why it should be hall of famed.
---
Anyone had any experience with dropping one or both bellinger sentry in mech paladin?
---
With only 5 secrets it seems like of lackluster, and drawing it in the end game feels bad. 
---
I was thinking of putting in a equality, lens, or shrink ray in its place as I find it's hard to claw back after losing board with only concencration.
---
Thoughts?
---
I run Alex, but I also run Eureka. It's not ideal, but shaman have a lot of 1 cost spells that go face. You can easily OTK them with Eureka and possibly a 1 cost Electra storm surge. You can further discount stuff with far sight. Playing jepetto on 5 feels sweet.
---
That's what control decks are lol. Although Elysiana is a problem thats not exclusive to warriors

Why would you ever play him outside of a Trogg-centric deck?
---
Yeah... And that's just sad.
---
Meaning all future neutral + druid card draw cards have to be pretty lackluster to prevent an unnerfed aviana from becoming an issue again
---
Talk about lethal puzzle
---
I still don't get it, maybe because english is not my first language?
---
Oh that's cool! Now I really want to try it lol
---
But you still get overloaded, which is text on the card. 
---
This one infuriates me.
---
You don't need a complete collection to play, in fact having a complete collection won't even affect your gameplay most of the time unless you play primarily meme decks. Roughly 2/3 of cards in standard right now, with the least cards there will normally be in standard, see play in less than 1% of decks. Even if you play meme decks how many do you play? Do you really need two copies of totem cruncher? Holomancer? How about a copy of Duskfallen Aviana? How often do you put totemic might in your deck?
---
I will still check out his stream, but I dont support clickbait stuff like this. I will not be checking out his youtube stuff.
---
I don’t even play control warrior, but can guarantee it’s not a braindead deck.
---
I disagree strongly. I've played all around ranks 1-5. It's the exact same people. Everyone actually good who actually plays frequently is legend eventually. By the end of the season, everywhere from 1-5 is positively loaded with mediocre players who got there by simply playing the best decks at an average level and maybe rode a hot streak of good luck or easy matchups to 1-4 from 5.
---
Because it doesn’t cause (enough) design problems for team 5. Also, it isn’t even really strong.
---
Wait, why should it go to HoF?
---
For some reason I always hear his voice voice line as: “My jaws that bite, my claws that chat.” Anyone know what he says?
---
Thank you for this! I've been waiting to see the vS report.
---
They'd have to readjust the cost of every other rogue spell, being as they're all designed around Prep.
---
"My jaws that bite, my claws that catch!"
---
yes, he went face once and the warrior suicided with super collider
---
Lost to zoolock and won 3 in a row.  Beat a tank up warrior...it's fun!
---
Rogues trading card advantage for more quickly casting bigger spells fits within what Team 5 wants the class to do.
---
While Preparation does notably limit what sort of spell effects the class can have access to, most notably board clearing effects, the design and balance teams would currently rather have the card exist in Standard despite the draw backs that come with it.
---
its a play on the word sunweaver warmage... (sun)weaver and (warm)age. you wouldnt call it (cold)mage because it is from the sun lol. pretty lame joke
---
Ah I see, cheers mate :)
---
i think the only time he does the overlay is on his birthday, but i take it as part of a joke. so yea i like him alot.
---
autocorrection, almost everyone else ignored it or didn't see it.
---
Get a 64 bit system.
---
That's an interesting variation.
---
Before I decided to craft Zilliax, I actually only used \[Bronze Gatekeeper\] (budget option lol)
---
And there I was excited because today I highrolled unexpected results to get Vargoth + Kirin Tor Tricaster, now you make me feel like a nobody :(
---
i know us thief rogues are a pain in the ass for you guys, but atleast i will try to make espionage work until it leaves standart.
---
then ill try to make it work in wild.
---
You need to be in Korea. Assuming that’s the case, you just need to buy the hearthstone combo (하스스톤 콤보) at a Dunkin (Donuts).
---
I mean on coffee sure. I would never actually get doughnuts from the dunkins in the states tho
---
There are different types of gamers. Some people really aren't affected by the grind. Though I imagine most people do get bored after a while before they need to play either a new deck or game.
---
Because Rogoue stole it back
---
I imagine the argument is that it's a powerful autoinclude classic card
---
What do you guys think about the meta? Is it almost settled? or should I wait till next Tuesday to start crafting cards for decks?
---
I thought the W symbol stood for woolong. 🤭
---
????????????????
---
And remember this data is a few days old now; near as I can tell, Rogue has only increased in frequency, and the high frequency seems to be spreading into the rank 4-1 range (and even casual for me, where I faced three tempo rogues in a row).
---
Kind of frustrating when only one class seems to have a positive winrate against Rogue (warrior) and I just literally never open Warrior cards (been playing since beta, still zero shield slams.  None of the currently relevant warrior legendaries).
---
Its telling you what the keywords in the text mean?
---
he got it off the one in play
---
i would not dust that one, solid card that will stay in standard forever
---
Pretty much the guaranteed tracking result when you’re down to 10 cards with 7 bombs in your deck.
---
Why do I only face tier 1 decks in trash ranks legend
---
When a deck is so powerful but also counterable that the only chance you have to beat it is to play the counter decks. That’s when a meta is warped. The warping deck itself doesn’t experience a high winrate but a lot of its counters do.
---
For general advice, Togwaggle and Tess don't really go together since Rogue has so few natural defenses like Taunt and healing (exception being the spectral weapon).. this means that high value cards that are low tempo can be dangerous. As you could just get bursted down the next turn.
---
I got one of mine featured a couple months ago. I didn't even know it until I happened across the video about a month afterwards. Still really cool though.
---
Yes Paladin scum🤮🤮🤮
---
just saying that there is a crowd of people like me willing to give more, if there was a bit more value
---
people come up with new decks all the time though. and some card that seemed perfectly fine might suddenly stand out as broken in a certain deck. you can't leave that up for months or years because it was fine the last time you checked the cards.
---
What addon is that?
---
It's tiresome hearing you pie hating jabronies whine every day.
---
How much would it cost? The same as the minion? Always 0?
---
Honestly, even if it just added a copy of the minion to your hand, that probably wouldn't be overpowered.
---
We wont have that rule because people are still pouring a huge amount of money on this game.
---
Is it just me or is bomb warrior already falling out from the meta?
---
Donuts? I told you I don’t like ethnic food!!
---
All I get at my Dunkin Dounts is someone else's order
---
Definitely not intended. How they managed to fuck it up is a mystery, though.
---
I do agree that it needs to happen more often, definitely not once a damn rotation though.
---
It is battlecry
---
Ahh I see.  Thank you for posting that here, you are doing Gods work. :)
---
The "Dont forget to follow" is incredibly annoying
---
It's not, though. I mean, programming isn't easy in general, but once you have this sort of copy effect working for other abilities (like charge), there's no reason why it shouldn't automatically work in this case.
---
i just hope they wont gut  multiple classic cards instead of unsatble element or toggwagle or the pick or so.
---
I figured I’d get this response. It’s not about it happening every game. This is not anything to do with just this video.
---
I agree with the advice everyone else is giving. Classic is your best option and the new expansion is a good secondary if you want to open a different pack. If you plan to buy a lot of packs I’d recommend only getting &lt;15 of the other expansion packs. You are guaranteed at least 1 legendary in the first 15 packs for each expansion. After the first legendary you’re only guaranteed 1 every 40 packs.
---
Hearthstone Deck Tracker
---
Totally agree. But there's always "that guy."
---
I mean, they're not really a shitty company but their food is not the good, that's for sure
---
&gt;Both would have rush as indicated, but you copied a minion that already attacked. Logically the copy would have “already attacked” as well.
---
This isn't how it works, though. Copying charge minions has always allowed the second one to attack, even when the first one already attacked.
---
Also, according to your logic, if you copied Al'akir after he attacked once, would the second copy get one attack instead of zero or two?
---
He's a legendary card in HS that has Deathrattle: Add 3 Arcane Missiles to your hand.
---
Lorewise he was a Kirin Tor archmage, the husband of Vareesa and Jaina's mentor(?)/friend. He died when Garrosh dropped a nuke on the city of Theramore. Big part of the reason why Jaina grew very hateful of the Horde.
---
It’s not very useful imo.
---
Looking to spectate on Asia. Argent#11448
---
There should be an option for ppl like me, who only look at ‘netdecks’ or current meta, and use that as starting point for making a good ladder deck ^^
---
Hard to say big priest is tier 2 in wild right now. Sure it's not darkest hour warlock but this expansion has given big priest a ton of new tools and I don't think there's a ton of data right now to define the tiers.
---
Ya black cat seem you be the main one people still seem to be getting.
---
It's gold, Jerry! Gold!
---
Who cares? What matters is that you have fun with the game, not how many money you put into it. 7 extra packs arent going to make you have a full collection anyway, so its not like you are having a great advantage over being stricktly f2p, and you can say you wanted the donnuts and the packs were just a bonus. As longas the amount of money you put in the game is good for you (0 is okey too!) then everyone is happy.
---
I don't think you understand the concept of meta.
---
 One of those days, eh?  XD
---
yeah my first thought was that they are going to blow up preparation. we'll see.
---
Us circlejerkers did that long before
---
Toggwaggle and it isn’t even close
---
I don't count the prep or the Crown, since the title is "x mana value," and you don't count what lets you cheat out when you're talking about how much stuff you get on the board. For spiteful summoner into Tyrantus, you'd say that's a 12/12 and a 4/4, or about 10 + 4 = 14 mana of value, not 21 mana.
---
what they said
---
Because it’s 20 people posting this a day and thinking it’s significant to people on here when it’s just annoying to the majority and the vocal minority upvotes. No one cares about his personal goal
---
That’s a lot of damage

Damn they almost got the full alphabet

Did you use any add on to help pick or was it just you?

Just did it. Hes good
---
I’ve had Black Knight since beta and put him into decks throughout the years as control/taunt decks become more meta. He will always have use, so I strongly recommend keeping him.
---
This is what the meta looks like without enough viable defensive options. Aggro everywhere. It’s like the good old days of Pirate Warrior where you’d just get run over and there was nothing you could do about it. Playing against Rogue and Druid as a non-Warrior class feels kind of like that now.
---
So many good board clears are gone and haven’t been replaced. We got like, one this expansion? Neutral taunts are back to being mediocre. The 3-mana duo of Stonehill Defender and Tar Creeper is no more. Proud Defender is a sorry replacement and Safeguard is way too slow. The only good one left is Zilliax and we can only run one copy. Everyone runs it anyway, because there’s nothing better.
---
In summary, embrace the SMOrc because this is our life now.
---
It's this bug

just looked stuff up on hsreplay
---
So i'm guessing he played the Griftah? Jaraxxus and Sac Pac in 1 Griftah ... that was one hell of a dice roll.
---
Nah just play on mobile most of the time, it was a priest deck.

Yeah, after second thought I think that ranked rewards wouldn't be enough to stimulate the meta. I think that Blizzard would have to promote the mode through tournaments. I know that Wizards has tournaments for modern and they even release sets like Modern Horizons that's just for Modern.  Bliz would prob have to put in a similar amount of effort for there to be a significant meta change.

Plenty of people wanting to trade that quest there.
---
Lamest excuse ever.
---
Wild pyro and spells? Nomi miracle priest is a deck
---
Hoot hoot hoot hoot.
---
well done
---
Try low rank at wild if you wanna chill. There are a lot of tryhards farmers or meta deck testers at casual.
---
Ancient boner spell
---
That’s nice banker is a staple card in some otk/control decks
---
You can safely disenchant it if you need to craft some cards. Even with big stats for it's cost, it's poorly distributed.
---

---
thanks bro! btw how i know if someone have that quest?
---
My guess is that if evolve also doesnt work it has to do with electra dying/ getting transformed similar to how if yogg gets transformes or dies his effect stops. Kinda silly but could be why
---
Can you don't
---
Never lucky
---
OH. Thank you 🙏🏽

lol

It's a reference to Tom Clancy's Spiderman 3 for the nintendo genesis

EU 80g, I show quest, you go first.

Goddamnit Kibler, stop using fake accounts to make these posts
---
in the scope of hearthstone decks where yes decisions like you said are far and in between, it makes more than for example "BOMB BOMB BOMB" the deck or zoo
---
That is a praying smiley btw
---
Come the fuck on, no need to make excuses for a company like Blizzard. They release unplanned patches all the time
---
Bwomsandi draws all minions from espionage, since they all cost 1 mana.

---
I pulled a Silence Priest deck from Un'Goro because I was curious. Silence mechanic aside, you can really see why the deck works...and its not because of the Priest cards or cards from Un'Goro. It was busted cards that made Priest playable: Kabal Talonpriest, Potion of Madness, and Lyra to name a few.
---
Priest has nothing comparable to those cards. The class really needs an anchor right now, but does not have one.
---
[found him])https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bekn9a/cmon_blizzard_why_cant_my_second_ooze_attack/el7tkhm/)
---
But its a free to play game. You only have to pay if you want to be competitive. Youre just angry because you've thrown away money and arent at legend rank. Calm down
---
I don't understand why the "Nobody:" part of this meme is necessary. It adds nothing
---
Nice. It’s learning all these little interactions that’s part of what sets the really great players apart.
---
Dog you don’t even have a pirate
---
You are vastly overestimating how much skill is involved in this game.
---
He's a good card, but there is no such thing as control priest (competitively) in wild anymore, so he hasn't seen play in a while. If you have no duplicate cards and need the dust, he's pretty safe to dust.
---
&gt; we don't know how big/small their QA team is and/or what they look for.
---
None of that matters. What matters is they're a big fucktard corporation who takes our money for a product. They better damn well make sure the product works. 
---
There's what 3 or 4 lackeys they added to this set? It's one of the only "new" features of the set and they couldn't even make sure it worked properly.
---
Seriously, no need to defend the greedy money hungry company for their lack of effort
---
It was in Taiwan, I was able to take a hold on that event and got khadgar.
---
If I'm not crazy, epics have a pity timer of 10 packs. It would be great to see a reduction in cost for crafting epics, as they do make up a foundation for most decks. However Blizzard is nowhere near implementing such a change.
---
p.s you should keep Vereesa :) there's some crazy stuff you can do with Spell Damage Hunter
---
A budget face hunter deck would probably be good.
---
Nice Elven Archer.
---
It’s not as commonly seen, but it’s still very strong.
---
Sadly i dont
---
What a shit rating lmao!
---
Is arena Wild right now?
---
I crafted Boommaster Flark for the second deck and really like it: it's slightly faster, which is great against all the token druids and zoo, but doesn't give up strength against longer matches, easily beating warriors consistently.
---
That may work if I get lucky enough to clear the first 5 boards!
---
😎
---
Magic Carpet also buffs minions pulled from Academic Espionage. It's a cheaper, two-of Shaw for Thief Rogue!
---
I hate priest but the better of two evils.
---
If you're defending the real cost of this game under the guise of f2p you're an idiot. Literally Fortnite is a significantly less offensive business model.
---
Pretty sure most kids in rank 4-1 are terminally ill. Can’t see any other reason why they play the most tryhard decks like getting Legend is all they have left in life
---
Still rolling kids with my custom Khadgar Dragon Mage, proving you can win games without going to hsreplay first.
---
This. In the film, Strange faces the villain over and over again using time magic, being defeated each time, but returning and saying “Dormammu, I’ve come to bargain”. In this game, the rogue is Dormammu, OP is Dr. Strange, and Nozari is the time magic.

Holy shit
---
Amen!  It’s serious great draw to stay alive with then. Murloc Shaman has been so much easier for me.
---
I ran into a guy that played 4 miscreants (who knows how many were in his deck) and played recurring villain with the +1 attack and rush lackey. And then when it died, he played another +1 attack and rush lackey. Repeat 3 times until I couldn't survive anymore.
---
[removed]
---
Depends on mech synergy
---
Aggro is only snoebally if you do not contest the board or knowingly choose to not run any board clears. Do you expect them to just freely let you pull off your bs mountain into conjuring combo? If you weren't playing such a greedy deck, you wouldn't be in such a bad board state.
---
It was always pretty close but won 5 out of 5 matches i had at rank 5/4.
---
Just look at Dog's list, mine is pretty close to his (remove undatakah)
---
Reno#1975 trade you go first
---
Is this game fun for anyone else in this expansion? I still feel like it's the same crap for the last expansion, but with different cards.
---
Rogue is way better.
---

---
I used all my money to buy phone.
---
&gt; maybe having more medium/small time buyers is better than relying on whales tho. After all, looking at hearthstone's profit margins.
---

---
This research has been repeated over and over and over again. It's not. Otherwise many companies would have adopted this microtransaction model and actually made microtransactions micro.
---
So thank you for telling me that maybe the sky is green.
---
It almost never makes its way into the meta unless a lot of other Secret synergies are in the format.  While it's solid, I'd say it's pretty far from "good" standalone.
---
It's just as boring as the last one. Any fun decks are quickly outpaced by boring decks, like bomb warrior, handlock, and token druid. Yay. 
---
That isn't to say I want OTK to come back, but there needs to be a middle ground.
---
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
---
You guys nailed it. Warlock is definitely the worst class. Nice job on that pre-release predictions post.
---
pity timer + owning every other leg?
---
Get rid of Devine spirit inner fire and add shadow visions and mass hysteria
---
Or having the rush effect only apply for a turn as a band aid to avoid the creature being unable to go face on subsequent turns.
---
Public defender's the only real option here. 2 mana is not worth 2 health.
---
The sad thing was that this wasn't even in ranked, this was the tavern brawl this week ;-;
---
Hacks.
---
There's also the deal 1 damage get a lackey spell and a 2mana 3/2 that draws you a card if you have spell boost on board. Other than that, meh.
---
I usually concede when they take long turns unless I’m in ranked
---
I like your formatting. Here’s my key, my gold, my pack. Jobs done.
---
Thanks 😎
---
Whenever I see a moment like this on Trump's stream I'm always excited for what Jens has in store for the edit
---
I like to play it out, doing the same thing back to them to give them a hard time for giving me a hard time.
