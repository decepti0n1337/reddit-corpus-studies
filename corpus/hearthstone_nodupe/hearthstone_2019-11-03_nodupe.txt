Not class legendaries, though. Those are pretty generally quite good.

---
---
Casual players have Google too.
---
He carefully picked that red shirt, he wanted to continue the tradition...
---

---
He failed miserably.
---
Yeah, absolutely that's possible. Which would be ironic, because the Taiwanese casters were also attempting to get the protest over with as quickly as possible and then move on.
---
Clicked video and expected the rope to be burning and damn just call me ms cleo!
---
Maybe play faster.
---
"fight for" is hardly what I would call that... That guy wasn't fighting for anything but attention. The only people who are "fighting" for hong kong are those in hong kong getting tear gassed or those actually inconveniencing their lives to support a revolution by donating money or petitioning their representatives.
---
I think C’thun was also an extra legendary compared to their regular number. 
---
Either way, more cards is better.
---
I mean, rigged how? You think they made the cards arrive in a certain order or something?
---
Team 5 can't figure out how to give us a tournament mode but you think they've implemented a secret tournament rigging mode and none of the developers have spoken out about it?
---
Luckily you don't have to discuss it with me, the proof is up there in the OP.
---
There's a fine line between being lazy and thriftless.
---
I don't know if this guy is a troll but looking at OPs history, I'm at a loss for words.
---
Just here to see the great comments coming from this great sub.
---
&gt;have absolutely nothing to do with Chine's human rights violations.
---
You would be right until they uncharacteristically and harshly came down on a player for voicing his support and then released a tweet saying they would defend china's reputation at any cost or whatever the exact wording was.
---
They got reprimanded by our government for censoring dissent for crying out loud, to say they have no hand in the political controversy at this point is disingenuous.
---

---
What were they supposed to to? They're contractually obligated to move the stream along according to the wishes of production. And production (evidently, since they didn't cut away) wanted to go on with the interview and presumably did not tell the casters to stop Blitz. Meaning not allowing him to say it (somehow...) would also be in breach of contract.
---
The only other option would've been to walk out, an obvious breach of contract.
---
So, in fact, this option was the one that was least likely to be a breach of contract, since they went along with productions wishes, and the only clause this could violate was the incredibly ambiguous clause that could apply to anything they do anyway.
---
Ooh that would be interesting. Dragon slayer is gonna be the new eater of secrets
---
"I don't like something so no one should get to do it." Okay then.
---
Yes and what I was saying is that negative of running Barnes and Y'shaarj in Spell Hunter was balanced by the high reward of high rolling in the early game, this isn't the case with running duplicates in Reno decks, there is no insane reward where running a duplicate can out value the singleton cards. The situations are different.
---
Maybe wait for a year of the dragon bundle next year (this years sets with a big discount)
---
Imagine the dragon priest arena meta if this expansion, MSG, Grand Tournament, and K&amp;C are in rotation together.
---
I played it several times at blizzcon and it’s incredibly fun. Will it last and have replay value when I have access to it every day? Who knows. But if it gets enough traction I really think it has potential to be a solid addition to hearthstone, has a ton of room for fun improvements and changes, and will be a great break from the monotony of the game modes we have access to already.
---
People aren't complaining that the positioning doesn't matter. There is some level of strategy to battlegrounds in a lot of ways. The problem is that the difference between top tier positioning skills and "lmao I guess I'll put my taunt on the right side" isn't all that big.
---
It looked like it with the perfect draws but we also had something similar with tom and Pavel's god rng, It certainly takes away from their achievement for people to have those claims but at least they have a girl in the champions hall, congrats to her
---
If this indeed was rigged posts like yours are exactly what China and Blizzard would want. Your moaning about feminism and a sjw boogie man are the perfect defense against cheating accusations. If it really was rigged having a woman be the Chinese player who won is perfect, it gets people like you outing yourself as bigots and reasonable people having to defend her.
---
Yes indeed
---
Yes they were hired to broadcast an event and do it alongside Blizzard's core values:  
---
* Gameplay first.
---
* Commit to quality.
---
* Play nice; play fair.
---
* Embrace your inner geek.
---
* Every voice matters.
---
* Think globally.
---
* Lead responsibly.
---
* Learn and grow.
---
If they would have silenced Blitzchung, then they would have been in breech of at least one of those...

That last game was almostly flawlessly played from her I felt. Well earned.
---
Calling this the new keleseth is quite the prediction lol. Guess we’ll see which one of us is right in December.
---
The emotion she displayed after winning was very touching. Great humility and appreciation.
---
cant wait for her future lion based card next year
---
A protest they encouraged yes. And its far different when you're being directed to engage a protester and when you're encouraging a protest. C'mon surely the distinction isn't lost to you or are you just willfully ignoring details to strengthen your point? I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt...
---
Twitch chat claims everything is rigged all the time.
---
It’s Twitch chat.
---
I think WoTOG just had more cards than usual in general.
---
No because OP's point is not that the meta is solved - read it again - it is that an ***artificial*** meta forms where specific decks, whether tier 1 or not, heavily saturate the pool of decks immediately at release because the dust has already settled (even if it has settled sub-optimally). There is no phase of chaotic decks all over the place with this marketing strategy - it goes straight to a 'meta', whether optimal or *artificial*.
---
No spoilers for 24 hours
---
Honestly just leave it. Twich chat has and will always be one of the most toxic places ever. I was shocked at first too honestly.
---
Then what would have been the right action to stay neutral? Every punishment for his pro-hk statement is apprently pro-chinese, no punishment would be basically approving his statement and therefore piss off china.
---
I don’t care enough to keep this going.
---
A new player can't do that if they've closed the app out of frustration.
---
people at reddit are cynics who truly believe they know more than devs who worked on hearthstone for 5 years and, before that, on magic for almost a decade

---
Just seeing her matches made me so happy. Confident and outplayed her competitors. An amazing time
---
It's VKLiooon
---
But why would you want to use Google... when maybe, the game could tell you?
---
That's Twitch chat for you. But obviously they were on their worst behaviour because: she's a woman; she's Chinese.
---
Congratulations! Very well deserved victory!
---
look at how mobile hearthstone (the most popular platform for the game) deal with too many tooltips (zilliax, for example), that's far from an elegant solution
---
also, tooltips don't work if you are watching a stream
---
They are treated like people with a mass following that donates offering to them regularly, and get next to nothing in exchange, explain to me why blizzard shouldn't treat them like gods
---
She obviously played well but I think it does a disservice to her to keep emphasizing how she is the first female champion-it only further draws a line between her and her male counterparts. It's not as if the casters say first champion from X country-so why only make the distinction for gender also?
---
Tbh whoever says free Hong Kong doesn't know how world works
---
That game of Curvestone is not exactly the best example of her skill.
---
EDIT: For those downvoting, I’d like for you to explain how playing minions on curve and hitting face against a deck that basically passes the first five turns requires much skill. Any other game she played this entire tournament would be a much better example of her skill, which was admittedly quite impressive. It’s just that the final game in particular was a one-sided beatdown that any Rank 5 player would have won.
---
Don't blame the kid. I doubt he understands the whole situation. Be bloody furious at whoever convinced this kid to do it. Using a kid like this is terrible.
---
I rooted for her simply because she had the hardest run to qualify compared to everyone else who went through the stupid GM system which closed off a ton of hard working pros.
---
Ironically, the first year GM was closed off to an insulated group of celebrity players while China keeps their same meritocracy based system, a Chinese player wins.
---
Well, it was the first time they apologized for the "tough Hearthstone esports incident".  The response the week after it happened wasn't an apology.  And they didn't say they would do anything different in the future except in vague ways that they would do a better job of upholding their values.
---
[deleted]

Cool. Now let Blitzchung back in to GM. Only makes sense at this point if they're going to let people just blurt out Free HK during a QnA session. Whatever side you stand on the issue, at this point they might as well let him back in. If they feel he still needs some form of punishment, just make it a fine or something.

Mask could be for various reasons, people may not have been in a similar experience and not expecting it.
---
Seamless transition to what? you know how many people probably have to sign off on that decision, it's not like it was something people knew 100% wasn't accepted like say if they saw nudity they would cut without orders. 
---
Again nothing would be any different if they did transition, Blitzchung would have still received punishment for attempting it, we'd still see the backlash after Blitzchung posted about how they cut his segment on it.
---
Think of it as a milestone for Hearthstone esports in general. And one that will hopefully bring more diversity to the scene.
---
everyone who screams “rigged“ in the chat and forums better crawl back into the cave they came from. Lion winning GM is absolutely incredible and really BIG for esports in general. i was about to make a post like you did because i am so fucking disgusted by the comments.
---
Incels doing their incel thing, don't pay them the attention they don't deserve. I'm glad she won, a truly heartwarming moment is HS history.
---
Also just saying the reason why people were saying its rigged is that she drew extremely well throughout the tournament-having zephrys in the early turns for what seemed to be every hunter game, Casie not drawing Hakkar, her florist landing double on Malygoys, topdecking Brann against Casie etc.
---
To be completely fair a gigantic chunk of the HS player base doesn't even really know what those things are nor would they care about them. The people who have played other more traditional CCGs and those who care enough to come to forums about the game would love those modes. The other portion of players are probably hyped as fuck to see battlegrounds. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you even know what pauper is then you are a minority in the larger HS player base.
---
No, don’t leave it. Shit like this needs to be spoken out against or else the toxicity festers.  
---
Chat in general is a fucking minefield but since we all have to share the space, it’s a good thing to speak out against it wherever it comes up. Gotta push back somehow or else it’ll be consumed by it entirely.
---
I remember I used to defend the gamer community from people who used to shit all over it.
---
Nowadays I look at people saying that gamers are scum, look at stuff like this and say "Nah, you're pretty much right." It's kind of depressing, honestly.

You probably just craft it golden, like you could for C'thun.
---
If the claim that RNG was rigged is true, then logically that would mean the following:
---
RNG is controlled on the server side of the game.
---
If RNG is server side, each account would have a set amount of RNG quality. Think server side “luck stat”. A bit antcedodal, but my RNG has been consistently and noticeably worse ever since I started criticizing Blizzard over the China drama.
---
If BOTH the above are true, then we could have the biggest scandal in the history of the game.
---
Seems pretty clear that the casters needed a meeting or other sit down to discuss why what they did was not acceptable as well as get a formal warning. But a 6 month ban, and no action taken against the wider production team who didn't cut the interview makes it really look like Brack/Blizzard needed a scapegoat.
---
Sorry. Loss of tempo? Typically if you can drop 8/8 at any point you're ok with it. Play this turn four, whats an aggro deck gonna do to respond? Shit out their hand? This is auto win material. Bad design for me.
---
You can't tell me what to do! \*upvotes\*
---
Might be. Could be changed
---
Not anymore sure, but at the time it was considered vanilla
---
Actually quite a few Chinese streamers are literally pirating the official blizzcon twitch streams. Also NetEase broadcasts all tournaments. So no worries about that.

Why does it draw a line between male counterparts? I think it’s significant because it’s good to have more people coming to the game. So putting her in the spotlight may inspire more women to start playing and aspire to do so at the competitive level.

What if you get royal flush every game? That is how it felt watching VKLiooon play this tournament. And I am not only talking about finals against bloody, I am talking about whole tournament. 
---
Take a look at RNG involved in games against Tom, Feno, Casie and Bloody. Every single coin flip went her way. Druid mirror, sure have a coin, playing shaman, sure have hare evolve every single time on turn 4. And that hunter game against casie where she top decked perfect card 5 times in a row.  Meanwhile her opponents always seemed to have bad hands, always lacked answers, always low rolled evolves etc. 
---
Right now all I can see is that luckiest player won. I am yet to be convinced of Lion's worth.
---
I didn't say it was not relevant information. I asked where you got the information that
---
&gt; the hosts did indeed participate in the protest as they discussed with the protester what and how will happen and how they'll react just before it happened
---
which was not at all addressed in your video. The point of the article was not to say the guilty are or are not guilty. It's to point out that your statement, which you have provided no reasonable evidence for, is directly contradicted by statements of the people involved.
---
&gt; Even if we accept that they did not know about they are visible (which sounds really strange, it looks like some studio and I think in studios there is some light alerting you that you are in live)
---
You misunderstand. I don't know where you are getting the information about casters not knowing they are live, they do know. The casters didn't know Blitzchung was going to appear for an interview in riot gear, which the production crew knew before putting him on broadcast. Hence the casters assumed since production cleared Blitzchung for broadcast, despite seeing him in full riot gear, that production is okay with letting Blitzchung say whatever he was going to say.
---
&gt; Also again I am not a native speaker but "banning" for the hosts sounds strange to me. Weren't they simply fired as their employer was not satisfied with their work as employees?
---
Nobody is challenging Blizzard's rights to fire their employees. They are challenging the motivation behind that decision.
---
Anyway, you are going very off-topic. My question was just that: where are you getting the information to say confidently,
---
Your other attempts at defending Blizzard is not relevant, I'm just trying to determine if you are making unfounded accusations or if you actually have a valid source.
---
That’s exactly what they’re gonna do
---
If your goal is to earn packs/collecting legendary cards, an hour of work earn you more packs than an hour of play.  You can be an Uber driver, work on camps or McDonald's.  If you want to chill, I'd say don't focus on collections.  If you really want to know a good method for F2P players to earn packs, then the best way I'd say is to do your dailys and use gold to play arena.  You can use some drafting tool/web to help you draft.  Grind will be very slow.  Hope you enjoy the game and just have fun and chill.
---
Yeah it sucks, but at the end of the day it's nothing but the empty words of angry and sweaty nerds. Her secret jebaiting was top notch and she deserves the title of master.
---
You think shouting into the void about Twitch Chat will do anything? The people in those chats won't suddenly become good people (at least, good by your standards) by policing what they are allowed to say. Unless you are asking for the banning of these people from the platform, which would be insane.
---
One of the best of the set so far. This one will make your opponent sweat.
---
Sorry karma train past. Even if blizzard went completely out of business, or if they reversed everything, apologized etc whatever you dream of. This wouldn't help the HK ppl at all. If you really care take this discussion somewhere else...
---
Regarding the casters, I have absolutely no sympathy. It's one thing for a player to act in a way that puts Blizzard in a shitty situation, it's an entirely different one for ppl employed by Blizzard.
---
Regarding what punishment is justified here, imo that's super subjective and rly hard to say, but if I understood you correctly you already agree with the new, weakened punishment. So is there anything you want Blizzard to do now or lies your problem with them entirely on how they reacted initially?
---
Really? Why? It wasn't that powerful. I recall taking out the portals with lethal, execute, arrow rain, etc. 
---
How did they nerf it?
---
Adventures cost money because they're optional bonus content (which the dev team still put a lot of work into). When you buy the Adventure, you're paying for the content of the Adventure, not its rewards. You aren't put at a competitive disadvantage if you don't buy it. If you don't care about the Adventure and just want packs, just buy packs. You'll get a better deal that way.
---
And who can remember the last time mage was top tier. Oh right. 2 card needs ago. It doesn't take much to swing things (not that I think maly will be the swing card but just saying)

It’s not a void if other people are listening.  They aren’t gonna stop, the goal is to try to outnumber them.  Rather then letting them win, reasonable people will migrate away, thus they overrun the place
---
&gt; As the title suggests, I find it really shitty specifically because nobody was saying that in any other tournament broadcast...
---
Twitch chat says whatever the hell twitch chat wants. They'll say it's rigged, make racist/sexist jokes, make innapropriate comments... At some point you need to learn to leave it alone. At the end of the day Twich chat shits on EVERYONE. Trying to call out Twitch chat for being sexist is like trying to call out Nazis for not liking black people.

---
The difference is that he's saying "it's too much for new players to understand" He's not saying it's hard. It's just requiring a new player has to learn more with keywords than they do with just reading the card text.
---
He did not.  He just said they wouldn't have approved it.  That is massively different than condemning it.
---
Aren't there 9 classes? So for F2P there's 3 extra legendaries?
---
//edit
---
Actually 4 extra legendaries because they usually give us 1 for free (the neutral card).
---
Do you have some kind of proof that Blizzard and not NetEase controls the Weibo account? Or that other tech companies control their Chinese Social media accounts?
---
i dont think they are that powerful
---
for synergy cards, you have to build a deck around, and if all the pieces dont make a strong deck, it dosnt matter if some cards are above averege.
---
Druid: 
---
* quest druid is not gonna have room for all the synergy cards
---
* token druid dosnt really need any of the cards
---
Hunter:
---
* mech hunter may include some of the cards (no power change)
---
* midrange / beast is stronger without another tribe
---
* secret hunter may include some of the cards (no power change)
---
* highlander may include some of the cards
---
Mage:
---
* tempo mage is not gonna want any of the value synergy cards
---
* big spell / highlander may include some cards (no power change)
---
Paladin: (nozdormu can backfire so hard vs combo decks)
---
* murloc - just NO
---
* OTK - i dont see any good controll or draw tools atm - so NO
---
* quest - no good deathrattles -&gt; NO
---
* secret - will be dead after wild rotation
---
Priest:
---
* resurect will be dead after wild rotation
---
* combo priest has nothing interesting to include atm (you cant cut combo pieces)
---
Rogue:
---
* Tempo - most of the cards are to slow
---
* Deathrattle - maybe this will work out with the legendary (strong anti fatigue deck)
---
Shamen:
---
* murloc - NO
---
* quest - i dont see any good new battlecries
---
* aggro - no good cards jet
---
Warlock:
---
* zoo - the galakrond pack may find a place here 
---
Warrior:
---
* Controll - more dragon could push the dragon package (is it stronger then mech? + dr boom?)
---
* Aggro - i can see crazy deathwing turns but only over 2turns and the deck already has good combo turns
---
i can only see warrior and warlock incuding synergy cards from the set atm. and i wouldnt call anything meta breaking. we should wait for the full set to make any real predictions.
---
Appealing to emotion isn't going to win me over, I'm afraid.
---
If I were a HK citizen, I'd like to think I'd stick to my guns on this. Appreciate Blitz's efforts but recognise why Blizzard has a right to punish. What you just did is highlight the flaw in politics. People will think about themselves to an irrational degree. Instead of putting yourself into biased shoes, you should look to take yourself out of them.
---
So trying to guilt trip me isn't going to work. It's a bad tactic for any rational discussion. "I think this should be an exception because I *feel* this is severe enough" doesn't cut it.
---
People can argue about human rights all live long day. I don't want people coming up on the Hearthstone stage making statements for or against abortion because of a "right to life" or "right to choose."
---
So, again, respect to Blitz for doing what he believed/believes is right and respect to those who continue to voice discontent or a ceasing of support for Blizzard.
---
But let's not try to leverage bias to "make exceptions" for good rules.
---
Well that article is from March. Of course Hearthstone lost money in Year of the Raven compared to Year of the Mammoth.
---
But now there’s a lot more shit one can pull... and more legends will rotate in and out of top tear decks, blizzard doesn’t give free things out if they don’t make more money.
---
I'm not underestimating it?
---
I just saw one I liked and made a comment. It wasn't some in depth review lol.
---
They should have come out publicly with that info and denounced the statement then, letting it ride like they have gives it more weight.
---
Even in the interview they didn't say shit about how embarrassing it was to have that said in their name.
---
Just a simple cop out that it wasn't their fault.
---
They mean it won't attack things summoned by the death rattles of the minions deathwing kills
---
True, but don't say that here or you are gonna get downvoted.
---
You summed up the majority of reddit, reaching for anything that makes blizzard look bad, even jumping to theoreticals because you love to complain
---
Ik this is a contervercial view but hear me out. If a company angers china you anger the entire country. I get freedom of speech and expression and the need for that in our country but that still doesnt discount the fact that china is one of the biggest economic powers in the world. The profit loss that would ensue with angering china could be dangerously high. (I think) blizzard did this bc of that profit loss not because of the actual message. I think a lot of the staff at blizzard (probably) believe in HK but cant say it bc of how important china is. If a major company like any of the ones you mentioned ignored a part of the world as influnecial as china theyre profits would drop. And yes freedom of speech is extremely important but think about what happens to those companies. People might lose their jobs bc chinese companies might increase the cost a bit or lower funding. Thats just the US. What about Netease? China has a communist governemtn if you didnt know which everyone knows. What do you think would happen to netease if a player of a game that netease releases says something that the government does not want? Netease might have another presidents or chairman or whatever. The company might be disbanded. Take the trade war that trump started. The economy has declined since tariffs have started to increase thats a fact. Businesses are being hurt bc goods are much more expensive. Im not saying that i agree with blizzard in fact i think it was wrong of them to fire and ban. But what they said in the interview with virtual makes logical sense. I still think that what blizzard did was wrong but what theyre saying makes logical sense. Let me repeat that. You dont have to think what blizzard is doing is right to think that something makes logical sense. Blizzard has their reasons but still should have more freedom of speech but again they have their reasons. You dont have to be in a cult praising china to recognize that the reasons behind blizzards actions. I think china bad and HK good but i also recognize the motives and the thought put behind blizzards action.

How do I own a Descent of Dragons?
---
Bruh you have to be born before 1995 to get upset by images of police officers beating unarmed people.
---
That was a super interesting read, thanks for the recommendation. As mundane as it is, this type of shit is one of my favorite aspects of game design.
---
It also sucks because people in general don’t experiment as much. You go up against far more refined decks then you did day on of let’s say old gods
---
The practice group with players like Feno, Justsaiyan and Hunterace did produce very strong results in the masters tours I believe. They just did their prep outside of GM. GM itself doesn't really breed strong players, but the practice groups definitely do
---
&gt;  But if there's 3-4 dragons that you'd run even without this card, then it's no condition at all, just a "fake" condition.
---
you need closer to 8 dragons in your deck

I actually think the real question we have to ask is: Will Galakrond be strong enough to see play in Quest Shaman? 
---
You're likely cutting Former Champ, Giggling Inventor. If you cut those, you'd have to cut Mutate, which means you'd probably have to cut Mogu Fleshshaper. But when you get to the point where you say "I need to cut the 0 Mana 8/8" you might want to re-evaluate the Galakrond idea. 
---
Alternatively you can cut the burn cards, I guess.

I know we've seen 1 Shaman card so far, but I'm fairly certain Galakrond Battlecry Shaman is gonna be it's own distinct deck from the super value Battlecry Shaman we had before R A B B I T  M A N I A happened. I hope it'll be like a C'Thun deck where Galakrond is the finisher. That'd be cool.

Mountain Liooon, 6 Mana 6/5, Deathrattle: summon two 2/2 **Scavenging Hyenas**
---
I saw a pic with a mob of like six people.
---
It’s not about who’s more unlucky or which unluckiness is more match deciding. It’s about having a good mentality going through those unluckiness. The casters mentioned that she went on a 7-0 win streak domestically to qualify for this global final, and she went 4-0 this tournament to claim the title. You don’t do that with pure luck.
---
Hearthstone is not chess, there’s always gonna be a player that gets the better draw. Liooon might have had the better luck in this game, but she definitely had games when luck was not on her side, and she coped well with it.
---
So because Brack said it and didn't issue it as a statement via Blizzard it doesn't count? And he had no control to ask for a recantation, that's the point of the Chinese partner, they do what they do for China in China. 
---
There are not two different stories, you have the story right here it's just not the story you want. But hey, keep acting indignant, it's something to talk about I guess.
---
Dont downvote me to hell. I agree HK should be freed. Im just giving another prespective to look at the story. I am in no way trying to convince anyone that freedom of speech should be limited. Its just that a lot of people dont seem to see or try to see the reasons behind blizzards actions and i like their games so i wanted to give another point of view.
---
A lot of this is spectulation maybe none of this would actually happen. Im just saying what could happen.
---
It seems like it's just this expansion and just for the evil classes. Probably no reason to worry.
---
Edit: Anyways you're getting them for free.
---
So the Weibo post that talked about defending "the pride" of China was written by NetEase?
---
Correct. We did not authorize it. We did not approve it. We would not have approved it had they asked.
---
-From the interview. 
---
If they have no control over what they say, why would he have not said that? Instead he said they didn’t not authorize that giving the impression that they would need their authorization to make a statement like that. 
---
And they never had them correct or rescind that statement which you think they would have them do if it doesn’t reflect the values of Blizzard which it doesn’t since he just said he wouldn’t have authorized it. 
---
So western audiences and Chinese audiences are gearing two different things. Just like the opening statement was translated to be different from what was said.
---
That’s talking out of both sides of your mouth.
---
I think he probably was. There are way too many people that get wrapped up in social media outrage machines.
---
I had just made a pretty lengthy post about Hero Portaits that you should check out. Pretty much sums your comment up and elaborates on it a bit.
---
I'm trying to get everyone centralized that wants these portraits so we can make some damn noise and get some better deals!

He said "say the seven words", which means the 7 political words. He knew exactly what he's going to say.

It’s something you add on to any shit ideas you have to make it seems good and get people to support you.

Malygos's Intellect allows me to draw 4 new cards from my deck and add them directly to my hand
---
Being a decent human being =/= white knighting
---
The fact that this was downvoted literally proves ur point
---
Read the 2nd paragraph. That's called using my head.
---
They are directly related, on site, and led the thing happened. Yes they are the most responsible.
---
I never implied I thought you were wrong lol
---
Congrats! 
---
Can anyone link me the video or tell me how to watch it? Cheers
---
Mate you can say that all you want to. You’re just not allowed to hijack blizzards broadcast and do it.
---
Armchair activists don’t even know what they’re protesting.
---
No, it's because he horribly misspelt Sathrovarr
---
Use your head to think about all the myriad ways you can accomplish that without infringing on people's luxury time - which they may be intending to use as an escape.
---
You can fight oppression while still wanting to enjoy a video game as just a video game, mate.
---
Ah okay, his first statement is "There are no good cheap decks in the current meta" though, which is wrong.
---
People at this level should not be making misplays like that
---
I feel sad that enrage keyword got removed. Good times
---
Because there are at least 4 other things in the world better than china.
---
Wrong about what?
---
I was talking about Malygos' Tome, you were talking about the Frostbolt. You're talking past what I said lol.
---
I initially thought of 11/10 but it wasn't enough. Then I figured 666/10 but I stick with the roleplaying
---
Excuse me what
---
That is a great suggestion fuccboi001
---
The EVIL classes are getting new five Galakrond Legendaries, they will not show up in packs and will be given to everyone for free. If we're talking about the cards to acquire, the number won't change in the slightest.
---
That’s ... not how probability works. It’s not just three choices out of nine = 3/9. The way he did it was right.
---
Was it not in implied? Also Blizzard China went full damage control.
---
Is it too late to get the golden savarroth (however you spell it?)
---
If it’s not, can someone guide me how to get it? Idk what a virtual ticket even is.
---
...with Blizzard...
---
Sigh.
---
We're making the same point.
---
This card almost gives me Millhouse vibes. Cheat out a big boi early, and pray opponent won't immediately annihilate you on the backswing :p
---
I watched it in the Blizzard app. Welp, so much for getting free packs...
---
5 Galakrond Hero cards and the 6th one is that demon legendary I believe
---
Are you drunk?
---
evil classes? why is this a thing?
---
No, just that guy. And you.

Mouseover text: ight time to head out...
---
What do you want blizzard to do then? Openly support “free hk” in mainland China? What they are doing now is the best they can do. They apologize and and give back the prize money to the banned gamer. At the same time, they don’t take a position in this dangerous political issue, and they don’t want people to use them as means to protest. They don’t care if people protest elsewhere, but their esports events are no place for these protests.
---
Of course you can complain. That's what you're doing here. But I'm just saying you will be sorely disappointed if you think this won't happen again in future tournaments. Each person has their own struggles in life and their own causes they believe in. If they feel too strongly about it, they would be ok with violating the rules(no politics) that you strongly believe in. I'm not turning this into a personal vendetta. Like I said, it's completely fine that you disagree and I'm not even trying to turn you into my side. We're 2 different people. 
---
All I'm saying is, if you get bothered by tournament players who are infringing on your "luxury time" because they violated the no politics rule, then maybe you should stop watching tournaments. I don't think you've done anything wrong tbh. You're allowed to have your own opinions. You don't have to take my advice and just keep watching the tournaments. And when someone infringes on your "luxury time", you can always come here to complain. Obviously, you don't need anyone's permission to do all these. rofl

turn 3. Call to adventure. 
---
Turn 4. 4 mana 11/11.
---
Turn 5. Big boys.
---
&gt;The heroes concept adds natural imbalance to the game.
---
It seems very similar to Underlords from Underlords.
---
I never let meta decks dictate how i play, i play almost exclusively burgle rogue because its fun as heck, or super late game hagatha shaman because i love control... I dont care about ranks or winning,  because when you have that 1 glorious 20+min game against another control deck, its the most fun game ever for me
---
Also, she made a bunch of boys horny.
---
i just dont understand why it is not possible to be nice to each other.
---
we all have our flaws, but that is ok if we try to improve and work together.
---
i just start to hate my comment because it gives out the wrong massage. its just stereo typs. everyone has them and they are not there to point on, but to improve on.
---
What are the other ones?
---
- Firebat - Fiery Bat (obviously)
---
- Ostkaka - ???
---
- Pavel - ???
---
- Tom60229 - ???
---
- Hunterace - ???
---
Well usually you think before you play cards, especially when the deck is combo priest...
---
It feels like they tried to go with a doubling theme, but stopped halfway because a 4 mana deal 12 damage or a 2 mana fireball with freeze would have been too powerful.
---
Y'all ever heard of the Cantor ternary set?
---
It's still infinite if you remove all the ones with the digit "3" in them, though I don't see that mattering as there's still plenty outside the original set anyways.
---
No, he spent his turn thinking. He used the rope time to play cards.
---
As long as it isn't anywhere near as shitty as the MTG:A implementation ..
---
Not play faster, think faster.
---
That's actually Italian ;)
---
Not to mention, what are they going to do? Withhold their prize money that they didn't win? Ban them from esports that they don't play? Anything they enforced would have just cause more unwanted attention from a "tough hearthstone esports moment"
---
When people's lives are on the line, when I'm acting in the good faith it's for the benefit of **people,** when I have the chance to do something, **anything** to raise awareness or promote action or rally common cause it is **worth** it to stand up, yes, in every channel and every place. I've said it before, all art is political, all entertainment is political. Those themes and messages may be buried beneath elves and exploding flying cities but there is still political messages being said. 
---
There is indeed a myriad of countries with problems that need to be addressed, worked through, solutions found and supported. Hong Kong is one of those right now, so it's easier to support. It's common cause worth working toward. And one of those avenues we can work through to achieve that better end is in the business of this entertainment company silencing players who openly support peaceful protest, and then running scared of the recompense. 
---
If you don't like that, if you can't stand people caring enough about other people to use their passions and common ground to support others, what platforms they earn on the internet, or in a video game tournament, or in the US Government (because that is still how high this has gone where people with platforms have denounced Blizzard's actions) can and should be used to achieve the world we want to live in. 
---
If you don't want to put up with it, you don't have to. It just means you're supporting China's human rights violations by directly saying "Stop acting against them."
---
Haha, I love how reddit downvotes your explanation as well. Then again, this sub is packed with freedom fighters, so don't judge them. They are not mere gamers, they are ascended,
---
&gt; It's almost as if Blizzard never actually intended to censor free speech
---
They quite literally said they did it to protect China's honor. It doesn't get more blatant than that.
---
No. 
---
Because protest is done where it will be viewed, outside of the echo chamber, specifically to make change a potential reality and push toward it. This is what peaceful protest is. You don't achieve it sitting in a closed room telling each other how much you wish things would happen. *You put the problem right out in the open peacefully even if it is, especially if it is, to the detriment of those harming others.*
---
...
---
The reason is that it makes the game harder to learn for very little benefit. ... Thought we went over this.
---
The only time where keywords are worth making the game harder to learn are when 1: they're used on tons of cards (in the same environment) meaning it actually makes the game easier to learn (oh, I remember "Battlecry" from that other card), or 2: they're introducing a theme.
---
Artifact did pretty well with theirs
---
the bottom line is:  both the casters didn't say anything political.
---
one of the casters didn't even know what is happening.
---
Should they be punished for not handling stuff properly? maybe.
---
But 6 months without any warning is not a good way to show "Every voice matters"
---
VKLIOOON is a female
---
Look I can't and don't speak for these "people", imaginary or otherwise, that you're projecting. I'm just seeing the situation for what it is. I don't really have a dog in the fight.
---
If the CEO came out with a sincere apology, then sure, awesome. I probably would have commented in the positive.
---
However that didn't happen.
---
One thing I didn't make clear before that I will now - note very clearly in ALL interviews where the CEO is questioned regarding the topic of the Weibo comment, he's very specific in saying that he doesn't approve the comment and wouldn't approve it.
---
Not approve ***OF*** the statement, just not approve it.
---
These are VERY different statements. Not approving of something is placing a value judgement on it i.e that you don't agree or condone it. Not approving something is not giving permission for something to happen.
---
Look it up. If you find a credible source where he says "approve of" and not just "approve" I'll stand corrected. I'll take even him giving specific language directly denouncing the Weibo statement. I don't agree with the statement. I don't condone that statement. I denounce that statement. Anything that is disapproving of the statement and not dancing around it saying "Well, we wouldn't say that".
---
This isn't over-analysing. Over-analysing would be talking about his body language or his relationship with the interviewer or something like that. This is just seeing his statements as they are, nothing more.
---
&gt;Jesus you guys need to chill.

You might want to take your own advice dude as well as take a breath. Relax dude.

Did you ask her permission before you Toucha her?
---
Brightwing and Faerie Dragon thank you from the bottom of their hearts for calling them "big". They had such a complex about it.
---
I’m glad nothing happened at glizzcon, what a laughable internet outrage
---
How do we get the free content? Packs I’m guessing?
---
they did nothing because they had no competition and they didnt...evolve.
---
when hs was released they were the biggest casual game on twitch. csgo, dota,lol,starcraft(overwatch didnt even exist) were the other big games and they weren't casual friendly. when fortnite was released that was a point that caused a small dive because its a popular casual game but later the free autochess mods and games caused the biggest dive because they were in the strategy genre. hs also didnt just stay the same price, it actually got more expensive! its an expensive casual game that stayed the same gameplay wise.
---
mtg is more expensive but its a different audience. they also released a good digital client so serious players have another option for a card game. some streamers still prefer hs because biggest card game audience on twitch but who knows if it gets even lower.
---
the reasons for the decline are clear.... it was such a static game that people wanted to jump on artifact when it was released.... they should improve.
---
i feel you
---
hey, olivia, add me, i have a big deck. dayarra#2579.
---
Or nerf priest since it is blatantly overpowered which is my point.  Even if I play a priest counter, every game will go to to last 10 cards and be 15+ minutes, which is fatigue in itself
---
&gt; This is human rights we're talking about.
---
and everytime anyone doing some wrong shit, they should just excuse themselves for having the RIGHT cause. 
---
&gt;This is human rights we're talking about. I'm fairly certain the only reason you wouldn't be for that, the only reason you wouldn't think this a universal right, is if you were trolling
---
Tell me exactly which law that is universal you mention. Laws, and in particular, freedom of speech are  different from countries to countries. Tell me which clause or article is the same everywhere. I'll wait. 
---
Im on the same side with HK protesters and I hate Chinese government as much as the next guy, but this mentality to claim you are on the righteous side of humanity is just retarded. 
---
I love democracy and freespeech, but let me tell you a secret of the universe: that is just a preference of a portion of humanity. For places that don't have it, you, for absolute certainty, don't change shit with talking on the internet. 
---
If you cannot prove that Blizzard undermine any OFFCICIALLY recognized regulation, stop bullshiting about human right. 
---
&gt; You are part of it. Vocal critique or silent approval, it's participation regardless.
---
or maybe I am fully aware of the fact that some methods are very effective at making change and some are just outright useless, and that I am no longer at the pitiful state where I believe that doing useless shit can make me feel better about myself just because I am standing up for the just cause. 
---
I wanted to save a local endangered type of primate, I joined an NGO to do only that and we only protest in the place we are allowed to. I wanted to promote vegan diet, and my group posted nutritional researchs in the most popular canteen in the city, with permission of course. I wanted to fight against China, there is also an organized protest too. 
---
If we want to borrow someone's tool and platform to promote our ideology. We kindly ask them and if they don't accept, we GIVE UP and LEAVE. If you don't respect legitimacy, formality and especially other people's right, you are as good as the dictators you are trying to condemn regardless of how much you keep yelling out the most righteous things in life.
---
That's a strawman. "Harder" is not "too hard". Anything that makes the game even slightly harder to learn (as in, it takes longer to learn it) is a negative thing and should be treated with caution.
---
Why is this a difficult concept?
---
So Pity Timers need to change, 3 legendaries per class is a huge problem if we still get 3-4 legendaries after opening 150 packs.
---
Charge your phone
---
Why in the ever living fuck did they make the rogue legendary dragon some retarded cum-stained oc? Why can't it be a dragon from WoW? Any named dragon from WoW? Here is a list of dragons the Heathstone design team can look at when designing cards: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dragon

Who's Olivia Munn?
---
It's not too difficult, it adds to the total thing you feel you need to know when you start learning the game. If that amount of things is too much in total, they'll quit the game before even trying to learn it. Limiting how much a new player feels like they need to know is a good thing
---
Doesn't seem like it has been that long!
---
I don't miss That's Admirable.
---
Thought we were talking about nozdormu the new 4 mana 8/8 for Paladin
---
m8 Priest is annoying, but at if they nerf it again it will be like how it used to be.
---
The difference is that the payoff for Spell Hunter in K&amp;C wasn’t To My Side! or even Rhok’delar. Barnes and Y’Shaarj were the reason why you’d even play the deck. It was the highroll that was insane. If you didn’t get that highroll, the rest of the deck was still good enough not to fall flat.
---
I think blizzard is trying to boiling frog us. 
---
First they give us 5 legendaries for free. Then suddenly its 3 legendaries per class per expansion and you have to collect all of them from packs.
---
Kind of like what they did with single player content.
---
Remember the time we used to get single player content (KnC WW BDP RR etc) for free?
---
Yeah, because who gives a shit about human rights, amirite?
---
Zerus and Chameleos are also better if you can somehow bounce them back to your hand.
---
What do you think they'll do differently?
---
I’m hoping they have Wrathion as a neutral legendary and Murozond. I think he’s there because I have seen a monstrous bright dragon that looks like him.
---
Opponent gets 6 mana that he can use ahead of you. It a 4 mana 8/8 concede.

You know, I guess you're right. This is, after all, exactly how the internet came together back in 2012 and stopped child soldiers in Uganda by plastering Joseph Kony's face all over our Facebook and Twitter feeds. WE MADE HIM FAMOUS!
---
A substantial amount of the pushback you're receiving comes from people who just don't think that us making angry comments on the Hearthstone subreddit is going to stir any hearts and minds in China or prevent any human rights from being violated. 
---
And because I'm sure you'll be filling in my opinion for me if I don't make it clear: China sucks and so does Blizzard for playing right into their hand by cracking down on a dissenting voice as hard as it did. I wish China would stop oppressing its citizens and would recognise the legitimacy of Hong Kong and other countries like it.
---
I'm just not convinced that my making that statement from the comfort of my European home is going to change anyone's mind on another continent.
---
So, are they now going to give 6 month ban to VKLiooon and casters?
---
&gt;Following her win, VKLiooon delivered an emotional post-game interview to the capacity crowd at BlizzCon. She addressed the gender-based prejudice that she had faced as she looked to join the field of competitors, relaying a story about how she had been told at a competitive tournament that she should not be competing against the men.
---
Gender-based prejudice is very political statement about issue she wanted to raise. Shouldn't she be treated same way as Blitzchung? After all isn't this exactly the path Blizzard don't want to go down?

That’s draconic

I think he's saying that FLJ is so strong she counts as 2 compared to other DKs which apparently aren't as strong? Like I get what he was trying to say but it's still stupid lmao

No, it really wasn't and I am surprised so many people here don't seem to know.

This was essentially an invite-only tournament clown fiesta that means nothing.

That title would fit DS Rexxar better.

I don't think it's THAT bad, but not gonna lie it's not one of my favorites. I didn't understand a single word she was singing but, as always, it was great visually.
---
One of the best things about Earthquake is the delayed additional 2 damage which is good with some deathrattles and really good against reborn minions.
---
This is just a plain 7 mana deal 8 to the opponent's board,it's not bad at all,but with all the sticky minions that there are around it's not as great as it may seem.
---
Nevertheless finally mage can have a board clear for big minion which isn't a combo of doomsayer+[insert freeze effect].

We'll probably have an update on Tuesday, for the Battlegrounds closed beta. That should add the preorder as well.

---
wouldnt mulliganing an above average hand signify that she believed herself to be weaker than hunterace? Yilou are likely to get a worse result in the mulligan, and have more chance to lose the game. Instead of getting a higher win rate, what she said wild confer less winning chances. By definition, you should mulligan if and only if you have a below average hand or have a higher chance of obtaining a slightly/much better hand than getting a slightly/much worse one.
---
When they patch the client on Tuesday.
---
&gt;some political messages but not others
---
that's how politics work.
---
They should maintain a neutral stance.
---
They shouldn't be pro-china as much as they shouldn't be pro-HK, there a game development company that has to deal in both jurisdictions, and not some political activism company.
---
I have a five year old i3 laptop, and the game runs just fine for me.
---
Nothing wrong? Their behaviour was extremely unprofessional. Moreover, they ENCOURAGED Blitz to break the rules.

Good for you.

The people who are still here after all that crap don't care.

complaining about other peoples complaining is such a babyboomer thing to do...
---
"those young people can never take the things they have and be happy with it, they allways complain, allways want more..."
---
besides that, they have the right to complain if something doesnt seem right to them, ones right to complain isnt bount by the truthfulness of ones complaint, nor by your evaluation of ones complaint.
---
ever heard of "Hypocricy?"
---
Also noteworthy: Mage, Druid and Paladin are also the only classes with only one Herocard.
---
Hunter, Rogue, Priest and Warlock have two and Shaman and Warrior have 3.
---
Yah it's honestly the same as what you're doing. 
---
I get it, you're annoyed by other people. Those people are annoyed by this stuff. You're better off just ignoring them.
---
1 hour a day gives 30 hours of playtime in a month. Assuming that 1 game takes about 10 min on average(for aggro/midrange/combo deck), you have 180 games to hit legend. It's realistic to reach legend from rank 5 with the winrate of 57% and above during that time.
---
You easily can due to the rank decay. If you start at rank 5-4, an hour a day is plenty of time to hit legend. And getting to the point where you can start at rank 5 isn't so hard due to the winstreaks.
---
Have they punished anyone for supporting Chinese government who have concentration camps? No?
---
Guess you're FUCKING WROOOONG and they DID pick a side. 
---
You defending the EVIL actions of Blizzard, so you are on their side.
---
£44.99 gets 60 packs and £69.99 for 100 packs + new hero, not sure what the US prices are.
---
You don't think 30 hours is enough to climb from rank 5-legend?
---
Nowadays, people dont even get satisfied with 5 free legendaries
---
What if they have Hemet in hand and are baiting out the Golakka Crawler???? Galaxy brain stuff there!
---
They appear in packs after the free period ends.
---
The extra arms nerf barely touched this deck. It's still extremely strong, and it was all over blizzcon.
---
Definetly.
---
Pet's are such a great idea. I would definitely buy one or two. Probably all of them.
---
It’s not supposed to matter. It’s just a bit of trivia.
---
Honestly it is a tough deck to learn for a new player. You need to really know all the match ups to play it well. With that said is should be meta if they don't remove divine spirit any time soon. I would think you could use any deck teir 3 deck to get to rank 5 if you unoerstand your deck enough.

Oh I know, and I usually despise the whole “OmG yOuR pOsT hIsToRy” thing because it gets used against me constantly to invalidate claims that have nothing to do with trans shit, but after seeing everyone on Reddit do it I figured if you can’t beat em, join em. My history is angry and bitter and misandrist and I fully admit it.
---
it just doesnt feel fun, usually turn 1 quest turn 2 cable rat and then lackey lackey lackey complete quest then lackey more to generate value, just not my cup of tea tbh :/
---
It’s also free for the same reason as C’Thun; Invoke cards are garbage without Galakrond, so it would be kind of shitty to not have him.
---
Its not a Rastakhan but anything is better than Uldum and Dragons are always fun
---
&gt; Nerfing out a card that was perfectly fine just to make room for a new one isn't fun
---
Lol you're saying send the problems into wild where they're simply forgotten about.
---
Because your soul passes over to the Shadowlands
---
Probably in about two weeks, like usual.

Sindragosa is a frost wyrm, not a blue dragon. Has been for a very long time. Put 3 seconds into a google search.

Ethereal lackey: I GOT MURDER ON MY MIND, YELLOW TAPE AROUND HIS BODY IT'S A FUCKING HOMICIDE
---
What is this madness?
---
If you believe this...why did Blizzard separate standard and wild then? 
---
It must have been nothing but a cash grab to get people to buy newer cards
---
It’s a lot more awkward now Kun costs 10 - Psychmelon draws less pieces and you need an Innervate.
---
Based on your comment I can tell how out of touch with reality you are. Look at the NBA and stop crying.
---
It also lacks the traditional blizzard polish. Crappy sound effects, animations, UI, even the emotes look like crap. It was clearly thrown together as fast as possible and they were still late to the autochess game.
---
It wasn't the audition that he almost missed, but it was the call that told him that he got the part. He was busy raiding

---
Oh rely, that's kind of long but It gives us some nice space to get hyped up
---
It's hard to keep up with that as a more casual player.
---
It'd be hard enough as a regular player, remembering which removals they'd have, which 2 drops are in the pool, etc.
---
Also having a yearly rotation gives one massive meta shift instead of smaller ones that might not shift at all sometimes.
---
LOL definitely an exaggeration, still fun tho!
---
This is very true. Gadgetzan was op af, KnC was op af, and now descent of dragons looks op af.
---
All the things you mentioned make the game sound more exciting to me￼
---
I'm sorry I do not know that much about Warcraft lore, I just thought she looked similar

Warsong commander nerf screwed my combo warrior. I miss charging in with enraged worgen.

I miss her so much! ಥ﹏ಥ

Kun always cost ten...

Aviana was what costed nine and this whole thing was assuming a world with a nine cost Aviana.

Poisonous triggers right after the damage is dealt, which will be between attacks. A minion that has been hit with a destroy effect (e.g. poisonous) is nearly always treated the same as one with 0 or less health. And I'm all but certain that a character with 0 health or less can never complete an attack, even if it's forced to attack by an effect. So I'd expect him to stop attacking if poisoned. Could probably test the theory with Mass Hysteria, or a poisoned Supercollider.
---
yellow men mad
---
The issue is that at some point you are going to run out of stuff and the hero power becomes 2 mana copy one battlecry. Depending on what the new hero power is it could easily give more utility than just one additional battlecry a turn. 
---
Hard to really argue when said card the debate is revolving around isnt even revealed yet
---
blizz server seems to be funky...
---
Will try again later... feel free to complete with anybody else.
---
That's a good summary of where we stand, now. For me, it's always been first and foremost about a bad ruling.
---
Please tell me!  
---
Is it like survival in MGO2? (What no one knows, but i spend like over 200 hours into)
---
Oh yeah, the huge amount of bad card text that don't says what the card really does is not the fault.
---
NERF SHAMANS!!!!
---
Tbf crowd roaster kills indescriminently. Rend only kills legendaries
---
Class cards used to have a 4x weighting for discover but they changed it recently I think to nerf Dr Boom
---
Not even Blizzard soon.
---
How does that all relate to
---
&gt;It's not a show on the level of MSoG if it's not hyper aggressive.
---
? Are you claiming there's no meta after the next expansion so dragon decks can't become as good and popular as MSoG decks were for meta-related reasons?
---
I wouldnt be so sure. The dragon priest shell was run not too long ago before the stealth nerf to historian and I'd say it doesnt need a ton more power, especially considering priest has some pretty good tools against the big snip snap boards.
---
I also think that just the druid cards already revealed will be enough for (taunt) druid to consider running the dragon shell, though that deck will need a lot more help than priest.
---
I am Hyped as fuck, i want this so badly!  
---
I will sell my ingame friends for this. Give me this gamemode!!!
---
Roaster is also a dragon itself, Rend isn't.
---
So MSG level of shitshow with control decks. Seems like you're the confused one.
---
But it’s not just people being toxic. There’s a difference between toxic, let’s say for example if everyone was calling her ugly or names or something which I would think it’s just another Sunday, and them implying that for some reason (I wonder what it could be) she can’t legitimately be winning on her own.

If a player has no dust or money that's their own fault. It is super easy to save up a few thousand coin before an expansion drops, and to get plenty of dust.
---
&gt;Last expansion, I log in to give the new cards a shot, but ended up not playing for more than a day because I quickly discovered that even with my 3k dust after opening 40 packs, I still didn't have enough to craft a single meta deck.

---
All the above quoted decks have win-rates &gt;50%.
---
There's still some others like Tempo Mage, Secret Tempo Mage, Aggro Reborn Paladin, Quest Hunter that require 1 big legendary. But if you can't find them yourself, then the problem isn't Blizzard, it's you.
---
Next expansion I already have some plans for a Miracle Dragon deck involving Galakrond (free), Heistbaron (1,600) and either 1 of Leeroy or Malygos (1600 dust) along with a whole bunch of cheap cards. Probably can make 2-3 different variants under 6,000 dust.
---
Oh and the hunter cards revealed basically build their own cheap deck.
---
you can do it with any deck at &gt;50% winrate, just take the time to learn the deck - mulligans, different matchups, etc. I got legend last month with quest mechathun warlock, kind of a bad choice b/c hunter matchup is around 25/75
---
Took me a second
---
Or big pally doesn't draw this and they lose because the rest of the deck sucks.
---
i don't know how you strawmanned such a weird argument out of what I said: I explained to you that your high horse of "don't like netdecking? make your own deck." is irrational more often than it isn't and no anecdotal evidence from 6 games (please be joking) changes the fact that I have a better chance at laddering by using decks that are tried and true (there's 230k games on HSReplay for the top quest shamn build btw)
---
it isn't a conversation of is it good or is it bad to do this: it's a conversation of 'am I--a nonprofesional in hearthstone--more likely to win games with a homebrew or a netdeck and 9/10 times the answer is the netdeck hence why there's so many people playing those decks and hence why we even have the meta profiles.
---
And then fell back to obscurity with the extra arms nerf.
---
&gt; Jesus your an idiot
---
"you're"
---
Any idea when it's coming? Or when beta for battlegrounds starts?
---
Crying an adventure boss is too hard when you get to continue with it having the same hp is lame. They always made the bosses too easy. Finally there's a challenge and you cry now.
---
Babbling book was made for Pavel, but oddly it was released before he even won.
---
I think you're misremembering. Mechs had almost no effect on the Wild Meta during Boomsday. Even/Odd decks and the Star Aligner druid were destroying everything. Boomsday gave druid some ridiculous combo cards like Floop and Dreampetal Florist. It also gave Quest Mage incredible cards which allowed it to become a crazy aggressive shell. 
---
The boomsday package helped them become strong decks more recently, so yes the support always helps, but it usually takes a lot more. Like if snip snap warlock doesn't get touched I doubt the dragons will make a big difference.
---
Even now the mech decks struggle to break into Tier 1. The removals people have can just deal with the magnetic effect so well. Like Snip snap lock can just easily plague of flames big magnetic minions or defile to clean them up. Nice to see them a bit on ladder though, and the hunter/pally decks are fun to play.
---
Are you actually retarded? There is literally a huge edit explaining that it's not hard just annoying and tedious.
---
No they only last out the event, after the event is gone the card will as well
---
Nope. They go away at the end of this expansion
---
So don't DE the other ones I have? I don't play much wild anymore
---
Very glad for her for winning, but I wonder what will come from her message of "forget her gender". I understand what she's trying to say but I can already see a certain demographic who don't even play the game taking it the wrong way
---
You guys have friends???
---
But they did an interview? Blizzard addressed why they did what they did. And they didnt authorize the message by netease so how is it that blizzard themselves are saying 2 different things? Netease and blizzard arent joined by the cuff.
---
Hmm no, it's similar to a loot box but it's a pack. ;)
---
Damn you are smart! There is so much you have to teach me! 
---
How is it called when someone reads a comment in the worst possible interpretation in order to feel superior?
---
Yeah hope so. I just want to buy it before the release of battlegrounds on Tuesday to get early access.
---
&gt;BigAT#1796
---
added
---
This little gap does feel bad to sit through now that we’ve had a taster, but I remember when they would stretch reveal season over like 4-5 weeks, revealing one card every day or every other day.
---
I’m not a fan of the gap between expansion reveal and card reveals, but if it keeps us from reveal season going at that glacial pace I’m all for it
---
You get 1 legendary dragon? Source please?
---
great i have 3 quests and one is play with friend...gg
---
~~w\*\*i#1\*\*7 NA trade 80g quest, I will show then you go first.~~
---
edit:done with BigAT
---
Yep, but that was a meme deck even with 2 copies
---
I misstyped haha
---
yup played about an hour everyday of snip snap warlock reached legend even with slacking off a couple days
---
Known bug, Just restart your client.
---
Haha I suppose. Still feels pretty bad :(
---
Thats pretty ruff.. No minions under 5 mana, and no other way to ramp (astral communion decks ran both Wild growth and nourish, pre nerf)
---
Aside from the mode offering more variety and advantages for players who have opened a certain number of packs, modes like this keep players engaged when their interest might otherwise start to wane. It can also draw in people who were initially hesitant to play the main game similar to the different Dungeon Runs. They become exposed to elements of the main game through this side content and might start playing in earnest as a result.
---
I like the format with the cards and stuff, but the actual gameplay is a little underwhelming. There's not really much in the way of economy and the lack of items in exchange for the hero power makes it a bit less rng which I like, but also a bit less interesting and less decision making.
---
The new hero portraits are a long term goal and a reward for people who've been playing for a while. I wouldn't judge the "grindiness" of the game based on those.
---
It's not tier 1 but reno mage is a meta deck post zephyrs. It's arguably better than reno lock which is like the 4th best warlock deck (though gul'dan gets played in most warlock decks that run a demon package)
---
And I'm saying is that it's to shorten card text. For most cards this is unnecessary but for some cards the keywords allow the text to fit on the card.
---
Someone calculate the odds.
---
Kinda. I started in LOE, but these days in wild a value deck isn’t gonna cut it when you have such insane decks. They’d need some absolutely insane cards to make it work.
---
Something something small indie company

Not sure why you get downvotes cause that's pretty much spot on.

There’s no citation needed for telling you that the commercial interests are related to their ideals. It’s a fundamental fact of economics. I even did you the favor of explaining the relation.

Then I filled in the blanks for you and explained what Blizzard did.

Why are shills so dumb? Because if they were smarter they wouldn’t be shills.

Tavern brawl, casual, against friends, against bot for standard cards....

yeah on pc and iOS

---
Actually not true.
---
Heat stone can run badly on an iPhone X.
---
It’s built on a very old badly coded engine, that’s why simple updates like text fixed can take months. That’s why they ban people who play the game in ways they don’t like rather then fix issues.
---
Simple variables can make the game run badly.
---
I mean, mogu &gt; mutate/evolve lackey &gt; deathwing will still happen, just the hare won't see  play because evolve is leaving.
---
Calling hearthstone high profile esports LUL
---
What I’m getting at is that you still paid money to be at blizzcon
---
Priest has the best removal of any class now. A deck full of removal needs a way to generate value, and this is it.
---
Rogues is strong also, but Rogue doesn't have the survivability to cope with a long game, and Priest does. So  a Priest Galakrond deck might actually be more viable.
---
She consistently won the shaman and Druid mirrors and wiped the floor with her hunter deck, very very deserved. Hearthstone has a lot of RNG but you could clearly see she was outplaying her opponents.
---
Just play burgle rogue. Most of your opponents will be shaman so you'll burgle a bunch of shaman cards.
---
Something around 8.5, but between 8.5-9, thus closer to 9. The actual number of opened legendaries can be 4 and it can be 20.
---
The average would have been exactly 8.5 if you'd get the legendary exactly on the 10th opened pack every time.  However since mostly you'd open the first legendary earlier than the exact 10th pack the average is higher.
---
If you want to be that pedantic.
---
You fuckers copied Mtg
---
This would be true if she played one duel and got a great evolve or something. She played 5 sets or something and won every single one of them.
---
That’s not luck.
---
I get what you mean.
---
The gadgetan version and the new, uncraftable/undisenchantable version are considered different cards?
---
Thats a big mistake from their part. I know they cant be both put in the same deck (they are considered the same in deckbuilding purposes) but its clear they forgot about the scenario where getting one of the cards in its original version into your deck trough random effects while running the new free version is possible in wild/arena.
---
lol post it to scrub quotes
---
And a new card is revealed:
---
***''Burned to crisp''***  featuring George and Karl :P :P
---
Btw your story is awesome m8. I d really like to hear more Hs stories coming from cards that connect to each other (i think Un'Goro had many of them). Sometimes they re really nice stories being told but i totally miss them
---
uh oh
---
Also thanks, glad you liked it.  I love it when stories are told through unconventional means i.e. flavor text, another example of this that I love is the flavor text on each of the spellstones from Kobolds and Catacombs, and I'd love if they did that more.
---
That's a good point.
---
I’m not trying to tell people that something that just happened, happened a long time ago and yeah you’re right blizz didn’t make that statement they made a lame ass no-apology, apology. You have the right to your but you don’t have the right to make believe something that happened a couple of days is ancient history. Have a nice day👍
---
Its going to be cool to cube/clone it and then hero power once for an insane arrow storm.
---
No. They're all trolls. Nobody can be that toxic IRL. Not without being constantly punched in the face.
---
I like your optimism. I don't share it, but I like it. 😁
