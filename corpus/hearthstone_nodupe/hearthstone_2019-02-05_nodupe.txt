I've tried recruit, explore un'goro, geist so far. I guess I have to be lucky to pull that off
---
---
---
Classic set by a mile. New expansions have been so weak that there’s no point in buying new packs. I almost always buy KnC or KotFT packs tho but classic is way better than the shit we’ve been getting lately
---
Just funny how even with no chat, muting emotes, and no other form of communication they still find a way to be toxic, but yeah I agree with you
---
exactly
---
To be nice
---
He is
---
I love the idea but there is always the fact that you kind of already do. If you do some basic achievements etc u can build up enough dust for him in an hour or two of playing.
---
1. Teams defeated: 22
---
2. Runs completed: 1
---
3. Shrines completed: The Mage one that let you use HP if it defeats a minion
---
4. Most enjoyed: The only one I completed, with insane Inspire +30 spell power and 6 Arcane Missiles in hand.
---

---
Rumble Run is the PvE mode I've enjoyed least, compared to over 1600/25 wins in DR and 200/3 wins in MH. But the fact the game doesn't let you pick classes or shrines, or even let's you track class and shrine wins, I have zero interest in replaying it... ever. I'll take my cheap card back and keep replaying Dungeon Runs.
---
Midrange hunter plays 1-2 copies, Deathrattle hunter plays 0-1 copy.
---
After rotation I suspect every hunter will play 2 copies as it will be very strong in new meta (with all old powerful expansions out).
---
If someone does it to me, I do it back to them. They usually stop after a few turns of that.
---
I'm just making the point that I'm not "looking at it wrong" if it's clear that it's not a powerful deck. That I explained well enough why that's the case.
---
So much so that I would say it's not even worth trying out. The deck will fail to be remotely competitive compared to already existing Hunter lists.
---
There is zero confirmation that current quests will be converted to special event quests. It’s only happened once before 
---
Yes, and/or included in a variety of starter packs. But Dust refund if true plz.
---
Small indie company.
---
2 dumbasses going at it then 1 post on reddit. Yup I'd say that's pretty much proper procedure.
---
When are they going to nerf Hunter? I just lost about 4 games in a row. All hunters. All agro. All managed to deal at least 15 face damage before turn 5, and in the last case managed to secure victory manifesting 15 face damage from an empty board. It’s not fun. I’m taking a break. I needed to rant. 
---
too soon
---
Well it is turn 2, there’s not a whole lot of asessment the opponent needs to make. This is either someone getting coached or just BM.
---
It's a scam they have set up to try and get newer players hooked. /s
---
I think the better question is "Is there any reason to do this?"
---
Because you actually want to play out every game to max reward chances?
---
That and two shrines.
---
I’ve done it when I was already tilted and drafted a deck I knew was garbage.
---
To be fair, in his case it doesn’t make for a very compelling experience for viewers.
---
Repetitive gameplay, sadly HS ladder is rarely about skill and more about the grind which gets boring in any game after a while.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Love to see a Bo3 format where u get to replace cards/deck between matches,then skill would a least be a bit more valuable in the deck building fase.
---
Hes not going to get to rank 5 with odd paladin in rastakans meta.
---
*whizpop the uninspiring*
---
that's the joke
---
yeah, but it still reduces hero power cost to 1
---
Isn't Zilliax the #1 most played card in the game right now? 
---
Dear Blizzard,
---
Please make it so new players have 0 incentive to spend any money on this game.
---
What was its original effect?
---
As a brand new player I have lost every game except 1 that I have played in ranked. I've looked for resources on building a better deck but can't find anything helpful for a new player with limited cards like myself. I uploaded my collection to [hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net) but that isn't really helpful as it only tells me I have practically none of the cards in popular decks. How do I build a deck as a new player that won't lose every single game or even be able to beat the expert practice bots?
---
The good cards are good, yeah. But most wins come from completing the quest.
---
I meant instead of simply retiring
---
9 mana crystals, but yeah regardless still bm imo
---
I've never been to legend, but it's also not like I really want to: 8 - 5 in about 2 days and I just chill and meme around with warrior decks in wild if I'm ever playing more than my quests tell me to. It's a pretty relaxing game to be honest. 
---
I think fire fly beat him.
---
1. Teams defeated: 287
---
2. Runs completed: 11
---
3. Shrines completed: list is getting longish, currently working on Warlock spells-cost-health one
---
4. Most enjoyed: Probably the Rogue Bottled Terror (stealth to other minions). Loved figuring out how and when to kill my own shrine, and especially duplicating it with Sonya.
---
Unneeded?
---
Why throw in PvP?
---
It’s because you are unhappy
---
You’ll most likely get to R1-R2 several times, then fall back to R3-R4, it’s part of the process. That’s why the push to Legend can be so daunting and exhausting for people who can’t put in that many hours into it.
---
With no win streaks in those ranks, it makes the climb very hard and very slow. But I think it’s a cool thing to do once, specially if you have the time, and a couple of decks for it.
---
Best of luck! 
---
Casts a bunch of mind blasts and wins you the game ;)
---
Does a bad joke a wooosh make?
---
OTK paly 
---
Lol
---
Kingsbane Rogue. I sunk every bit of dust I had into Wild RenoLock (Hijo’s decklist) and now it seems like the only deck I run into is Kingsbane. I run a Gluttonous Ooze to try and counter it, but unless I get lucky and mill it with Gnomeferatu I lose 
---
Frozen throne adventure give you packs and a free death knight. Others are just a card back.
---
Only in a couple games did I see success with it, now that more time has passed. :( 
---
I've thought this before and then was just like wait why don't they make all of deck recipes playable as is with no changes, or at least all of the ones not from the most recent expansion that are available. Although I would bet people would enjoy getting to try out the new cards and then spend money acquiring them/dust to acquire them. Then again I'm no professional but it feels like a good move.
---
And you’re not so biiiiiig
---
Search chump on YouTube. He is a hearthstone player that experiment with different crazy decks and this is one of the decks he played a while ago. He actually analyzes what the strength and weakness the deck has. It's worth checking out.
---
List plz
---
&gt; its just so greedy its not proper ladder competitive
---
The deck being greedy wouldn't be that big of a problem if DK Rexxar and his infinite value didn't also exist.
---
Heh. I played control paladin before RR hit. I’m either crazy or a masochist. Even hit rank 12 with it once.
---
You both sound pathetic. Well, you more so as you post this shit after winning a 75/25 matchup.

---
I'll say this on every single post I see on here whining about how the game costs too much:
---
YOU WONT FIND A TRUE CARD GAME AS CHEAP AS HEARTHSTONE.
---
In games like yugioh and MTG you can pay the pre-order cost for an expansion in hearthstone for just ONE card in a yugioh deck. Plus Blizzard has done TONS over the years to make the game more affordable: such as giving out free legendaries at the start of an expansion, making sure you dont open duplicate legendaries, upping the efficiency for gold you get for daily quests.
---
Honestly I think all of you guys upvoting this wont be happy until the game is just completely free because if they do make epics cheaper (they wont by the way) you'll just move onto the next thing and say "oh grrrr arena should be cheaper to play".
---
Complaints about how blizzard has all this money and should maybe add some more features (built in deck tracking is a big one that comes to mind) are valid, but saying "the game should be just be cheaper" is whiney and does nothing to add to the discussion.
---
A 4 year old realization:  I enjoy the game far more when I don't prioritize progress or have a 'goal' each month in ranked.
---
I got 65/65 before, but it wasnt at rank 5
---
Buzzard also got +1/+1 (worth about 1 Mana) in that same nerf, so it kinda sorta was the original 2 Mana bump.
---
Shhh! They’re all claiming control pally is killed off by it! Keep your head down.

Unpragmatic#1259
---
Thanks other guy. 
---
That new designer who basically came up with Hex Lord Malacrass must be feeling pretty nutty about their card making it all the way through the start of initial design, ahaha. Sure, the Hex Lord doesn't see play *now,* but it's still a dope card that has potential.
---
&gt; And now there's the six sets in Standard and there's all these crazy cards and a lot of the DKs are... the environment is actually really cool. I just think it's going to change a lot when a lot of these value generators go away. I think cards like Malacrass are actually going to have an easier time finding a spot when the idea of generating three or four cards is actually like super, super valuable.
---
I like this take. I understand that Death Knight Hero Cards especially have fundamentally changed the way we think about and play Hearthstone. That's a lot of power for just 9 cards to have (and let's be honest, it's more like 3: Jaina, Gul'dan, and Rexxar, with some credit also going to Valeera the Hollow).
---
But when they cycle out? It will change the way we think about the game yet again. Although one concern is the predominance of Genn and Baku, since they will be continuous fixations of the metagame as long as they're in Standard as well, I think.
---
But yeah seriously Deathstalker Rexxar has been a ludicrously powerful crux for Hunter and its rotation is going to basically take away a playstyle from Hunter and, without added Control or resource-generation options, force Hunter to retake its standard playstyle of being aggressively tempo oriented and actually being able to burn out.
---
&gt; The Holy Wrath combo in particular, I'll let Dean speak to, because we used to have a whiteboard with the number of people Dean's killed with Holy Wrath today.
---
Wow, alright then. Racking up kill counts with Shirvallah ahaha. Good stuff.
---
&gt; We had Mass Hysteria a long time ago - maybe Witchwood, maybe Knights [of the Frozen Throne]. It had one small change which was, “each minion randomly attacks another character,” so they could hit heroes. We played that for about two games and said "We hate this card," and punted it. It just got removed from whatever set that's in.
---
Ahaha, fair enough. Mass Hysteria is a super interesting card, and is really very hard to predict compared to just about any other card in Hearthstone. Even Defile is largely just counting up one by one when you break it down. But Mass Hysteria is a ton crazier than that.
---
&gt; **Peter Whalen:** If you're curious, the last lethal puzzle for Dr. Boom’s labs - Mass Hysteria does clear. One Mass Hysteria can clear it.
---
&gt; **IGN:** Right, wow.
---
&gt; **Peter Whalen:** It took four tries. We just had no idea if it was going to work so we just sat there and cast Mass Hysteria for a few minutes until it happened.
---
Lol this is friggin' hilarious.
---
Reading about Mass Hysteria design is pretty good. I really like how it is a much more challenging card to "figure out" than most cards, something Team 5 doesn't do very often (as pointed out in the interview).
---
About Surrender to Madness:
---
&gt; We could definitely design cards into it, where blowing up your own mana crystals is a good thing for whatever reason. Mojomaster Zihi plays into that a little bit where you’re setting both players back. You've blown up all your mana crystals now your opponent gets to play on the same level as you. I think that's the kind of card that needs a little bit more help or needs to see what happens after rotation before it will find a home.
---
Are we going the route of Discard for Priests and Mana Crystals? Because... that would be *really* interesting, but I think also really tough to balance. With Mana being such a constant in Hearthstone, it could be easy making an effect way too weak or way too powerful.
---
On Mojomaster Zihi:
---
&gt; **Dean Ayala:** Yeah, it’s one we’ve actually been holding onto for a little while. It used to be Kathrena [Winterwisp], but we had two designs for Kathrena and the one that Kathrena ended up being the battlecry and deathrattle – the version that Hunters use now, we actually just liked that a little bit more, it fit better with the rest of the cards, but we still liked the Zihi version. So when we were thinking about what to do with for Zihi, in designing that card, it just felt like a good fit.
---
It's nice to see when they come up with designs and end up using them later. I can imagine they have tons of designs that they've pulled out and kept hold onto until there's better timing. It's nice finding out about this kinda thing.
---
Apparently Shaman used to have Panthers instead of Frogs. Wew lad, I think panthers would have been an awesome way to go.
---
But on the other hand, frogs.
---
They also talk about how they "dodged" Krag'wa design from the two existing Shaman decks at the time: Shudderwock and Even. They did very well in that regard, that's for sure. And it's a pleasure to watch Kibler's YouTube videos of uh... "Elemental Dragon Evolution Shaman" with Krag'wa, ahaha.
---
&gt; **Peter Whalen:** (Laughs) So we cut Void Contract - or the card that was in that slot - somewhere in the middle of final design, and Dean asked everyone, because we were all sitting around in a circle, "Can somebody please pitch a thing for this?" And we probably sat there for 20 minutes throwing out card ideas.
---
&gt; **Dean Ayala:** A long time, a long time!
---
&gt; **Peter Whalen:** And then someone said, "What if it just destroys half of each player’s deck?" And everybody just laughs, we're saying "Yup, that's awesome," and Dean put it in the sheet and everyone went home.
---
&gt; **Dean Ayala:** Yeah, it was hilarious. It was Peter. Peter was like "Yeah, destroy half of each player’s decks." It wasn't really laughter, it was more a roar of "Ah, that's the card!" We all just knew immediately and I wrote it in the sheet and without anyone saying anything to anyone I'm like, "Okay, see you later."
---
**Peter Whalen:** It was the end of the day!
---
**Dean Ayala:** It was pretty late in the day and we're all sitting around the desk so as soon as Peter said those words, we knew immediately, we wanted to do that. Of course the next day we came back in the morning and we're like, "Seriously, are we actually going to make this card?"
---
Well, alright then ahaha.
---
The card Void Contract replaced by the way was a 9 Mana Epic Spell that read: "Choose a friendly minion. Add a copy to your hand, deck, and battlefield."
---
They mentioned that it combo'd *really* well with Voidlord. As we can imagine, that's obviously true.
---
So...
---
Maybe we'll see it next set in rotation? That card is honestly a really cool design, and I'm sure some people are going to see that Void Contract replaced that spell and say "Wow, Team 5 did a shit job there then." But nah, I think it was a good decision. I hope we see that Spell some point down the line. Especially with what was said earlier about resource generation -- this is a perfect card in a meta with less "infinite value" Hero Cards.
---
About Hakkar the Soulflayer:
---
&gt; We also tried some totally different space of “corrupt all other minions, they die at the end of the turn.” There was a version that when it killed minions, you would steal them. **There was a version that just blew up your opponent’s hero power.** That was pretty mean.
---
Wow, so the /r/customhearthstone designs that read like /r/fuckbakuandgenn were actually being experimented with in a Neutral Legendary. Interesting.
---
But whether they were experimenting with that seriously considering it for long or not, I don't know. They mention in the interview that there aren't many real "FeelsBadMan" cards that really lock your opponent out. The "Destroy your opponent's Hero Power" one is obviously excessive.
---
&gt; **IGN:** Awesome. Well I'm looking forward to when you guys do bring the "destroy your opponent's hero power" ability into the game.
---
&gt; **Dean Ayala:** That might be some time.
---
&gt; **Peter Whalen:** Yeah, don't hold your breath. It might be a little bit!
---
That was a fantastic read. I actually haven't read the Zul'jin one yet, but I feel like I have to now. This was great!
---
Also, Peter Whalen's a badass ahaha. He's been a fantastic face for Hearthstone, so just a shoutout to Pete for being a top quality lad. Dean was great in this interview, as well!
---
Better approach would be to adjust the upgraded hero powers.
---
 - Make Rogue a 2/1 dagger.
---
 - Make Warrior gain 3 armour.
---
 - Make Paladin summon a 2/2 recruit.
---
They seem to be the only oppressive Odd decks. Still makes them more effective, but not excessively so.
---
Don't think the discount for Even decks is as much of an issue either.
---
Got Whizbang in a random pack luck, it's a fun card with it's decks taking over.
---
Yeah so why would people want to swap it for shrink ray if the combo is still cheaper with equality? The extra utility of removing the attack?  
---
Many decks I see run both anyway
---
It certainly can’t deal with wide aggressive boards easily,  reason why Odd Paladin or Spell Hunters can be such a bad matchup. That’s the weakness of it, as you have no AoE clears.
---
Mulligan depends, but as a general rule, I tend to go for mole or fire fly with cat. I’ll keep Kirin Tor/Runes vs matches with big early threats such as locks, or CS versus classes with early clear, I’ll always keep a fire-eater for rogues to deal with hench/fledgling. 
---
Proper use of the limited draw options you have is crucial to having success with it, Luna, and good Pyromaniac drops are key. Early game plan is building a board to fungal while doing chip damage, and then closing out with Jan’alai/Leeroy.
---
I find great success keeping the fire eaters and automatons until later turns against some classes (cube lock for example), you can do some pretty good combos with them for massive HP damage despite their taunts.
---
It’s a fun deck indeed, which I believe will get even better after nerfs. It still needs some refinement though. As I think the 5 drops could be improved. 
---

---
Quest freeze giant exodia mage
---
I mean.
---
To still make sense?
---
Unlimited, I guess.
---
It just defeats the purpose of what deck names are good for, though. Deck names both provide shortened, broad versions of decklists, and inform you about the win condition or fundamental mechanic of the deck.
---
Freeze Mage is a Combo deck that controls the board up until they unleash an OTK or TTK. Freeze effects often help them control the board by stalling it.
---
Odd Warrior is... well, a Warrior with Baku. Odd *Quest* Warrior is a Warrior with Baku *and* Fire Plume's Heart.
---
There's also a difference between Odd Mage and Odd Face/Aggro Mage.
---
Shrink ray is like a permanent but weaker time out. They're different cards. It doesn't have to be followed with a board clear.
---
People want to win
---
Answered that above, go check it out.
---
Also for rogue and shaman just try to get double battlecry/deathrattle and go jades. 
---
80g quest trade I will SUICIDE-LOCK fo fast trade. 
---
Travincal#1724
---
I think the one I posted is better, because of Dire Mole and Candleshot. Those both are pretty essenital cards imo
---
Right. That's kinda my whole point. In the form of constructed, the decks I mentioned--and deck building in general--are non-existent because they aren't as good as the best decks. So they don't get played because, you got it, people want to win.   
---
It's not a complaint about those better decks. Those better decks (for the most part) are fine. It's a complaint that Blizzard creates cards and decks that really have no place in any mode of game currently available. 
---
Ouch - all kinds of shrines, or have you been focusing on one lately?
---
Both. I play exclusively Wild and like to tinker around with both meta decks with interesting tech choices and off-meta decks like Echo Mage and Odd Priest. 
---
Flummox! 
---
Play slower. IT Has been around a whilw now.
---
If you force close the game and reopen fast you should be fine. 
---
Shrink Ray is good without a follow-up from either Pyro or Consecration. You can just slam it down and it would be fine in most scenarios. Equality doesnt do much if you dont have the ability to kill the 1 health minions.
---
To each their own I guess. I would still say that it is usually easier for new players to learn to get better at the game by focusing on one good deck rather than juggling 18 suboptimal decks with differing strategies. 
---
Just nerf the hero power. Only three extra armor. A 2/2 instead of 2 1/1s. It doesn't have to be like Justicar Trueheart.
---
thats the “im out of cards” line for that hero tho...
---
Hey! I've actually been using a variant of this deck for about a season now! I don't have Deathstalker Rex yet, but I have augmented elek in mine for even more fun 
---
The first response to pretty much any suggestion of anything remotely player friendly is ALWAYS "will never happen". But a lot of stuff does happen. Dream big, friend. Dream big.
---
Unless that idea is an odd deck, of course.
---
Have you tried Arena yet? I think that’s the best place to start F2P because you are on a level playing field collection-wise, and it’s the most efficient way to build your collection for constructed later. 
---
You actually thought that 20k will watch someone typing this kind of things?
---
Cool! I guess I want to play classes that aren't already golden, so anything but warlock, paladin and hunter
---
Even keleseth highlander resurrect priest?
---
Wait... why did it become a smiley face?
---
Eh. So were about a dozen cards we started using this year.
---
Traded successfully with WinningStyle#1709
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
You might be joking but they're stupid.
---
Better idea than him being some obscure legendary. Honestly the game has to be careful as it gets older because the amount of cards will stack up and up making even memorable cards obscure and irrelevant. Blizzard needs to do some creative stuff with old cards, unfortunately it maybe perhaps would have a 1% chance of making them a smaller amount of money meaning Activision would say no 
---
There are Mech Hunter, Burn Mage (Aluneth) and Pirate Warrior, all aggressive pure face decks that are good against Big Priest and Reno because they're fast enough but that are cannibalized by Odd Rogue and Even Shaman
---
After playing a good 20 matches I still don't really know what to keep or trash. I'd at least like to dust enough to build a strong beginner deck. Everything I've tried building myself from scratch has sucked. I just assumed there was a deck class (like hunter) that wouldn't be worth building because building a decent one would be very expensive. I already don't play too much so I doubt I'll be grinding enough cards do build anything I'd really like anyway.
---
I played a paladin deck all about thinning out cards to then use a Mecha'thun. Used call to arms for big tempo swings and nearly every debuff in the paladin arsenal. The juiciest turns were turn 4 Bellringer Sentry to put out 2 secrets into a turn 5 call to arms.  
---
What crystal
---
I'd watch some pro streamers such as ApxVoid, Thjis, Rdu, Dog if he ever comes back from Auto-Chess, or various others. Many walk through their thought process with their chatrooms and give a good idea what to consider doing each turn. 
---
Deathrattle Hunter (assuming you have the optimal build, or at least have most key cards) is easily still one of the strongest decks in the game. Unless you are getting super unlucky with garbage match-ups like Odd Pally back to back to back, you shouldn't be stuck in Rank 20 statistically. 
---
A few days ago i played against this deck and didn't know there is such a deck... I thought he just wants to play paladin cards for quests cuz he played dumb cards... I wanted to let him win and played also just like a idiot. I played odd warrior so i was at full health and 60 armor or smth.. and when i just got 50 damage in my face i realised this is a real deck. So the game came attractiv again. I could clear the board but got another 25 damage in my face... Could clear the board and bis hand was empty. He conceded... Sadly... I wanted to concede.
---
I would like to add: if you play together with friends and talk about what to play turns usually take longer and ropes happen.
---
Also players like lifecoach just think about more stuff and take their time. 
---
Not everyone who ropes is a jerk. 
---
I just think he did that as a response to OP's greetings
---
I think they're confused because of DK's being banned from draft/discover pools generally in arena.
---
That, and on mobile the mana crystals you have are displayed differently depending on if you are looking at your hand or not
---
I personally think Deathstalker Rexxar is *the* most powerful Hero Card in the game. For one simple reason that you described: it carries forth a playstyle all by itself.
---
It doesn't require you to build your deck around it. It doesn't impose any restrictions. It is a one-card-army versus Control with an exceptionally versatile value machine, which includes the potential for comeback versus aggro (thank you very much, Vicious Scalehide!).
---
Frost Lich Jaina and Bloodreaver Gul'dan are often facilitated by their decks, at least to an extent. Deathstalker Rexxar on the other hand is just a "I'm shifting gears to overpower you over time" and *nails* it.
---
If it were not as cool and as fun as it was, it would be much worse to play against to the point of me calling it outright toxic, and wanting it nerfed.
---
But as it stands, Hero Cards for all their power can stay until they rotate, and I'm happy with that.
---
This gets posted here every single day. Some days multiple times.
---
Why can't we just delete Baku and Genn instead of nerf a whole heap of the classic set around these shit cards?
---
I love these interviews, thanks for posting and for the people involved in the interview!
---
Sry but, I Don't get your point. What's the difference before a nerf and a permanent ban?  
---
As a Wild player I agree with but at the end of the day in a way or another they have to keep powerfull decks in check.
---
And as I explained elsewhere in the thread, they *have* to in order to get a playerbase. Hearthstone doesn't. People come to hearthstone because a friend, family member, coworker etc suggested it. They're going to try no matter what.
---
Also it takes a long time before you're shut out by net decks in HS. I was getting shit on in mtga by my 10th game with what I can only assume seemed to be fully constructed decks. I tried and gave up on mtga twice for how shitty the new player experience is.
---
Giving you tons of free decks of dogshit cards does nothing to help me win.
---
Just git gud.
---
If there's no issue, then nothing would have been nerfed. Of course a board clear card doesn't see play in aggro decks, that's like defending twisting nether by saying it's not included in zoo. (Not that twisting nether is a very strong card, it is just an example.) 
---
Cold blood was played in 3 out of 5 archetypes in standard. 
---
Hunters mark was played in literally every hunter deck I could find, blizzard hates auto-includes. 
---
Even shaman in wild is incredibly strong, sometimes reaching winrates of 68%. Which is why one of their strongest cards were nerfed. 
---
This isn't too bad an idea though by the time you get level 60, you should probably have just about all those cards anyway.
---
No, the lunar bundle patch was data-only and was a delta patch for mobile (about 20-25mb total).
---
If they had patched the game proper then, hearthpwn and topdecks would have been able to datamine what the quests were exactly (and everything else in the patch).
---
There’ll be a patch later in the Pacific morning. 
---
I swear this gets posted every single day.
---
Except that new people should not be competing (and winning) with anyone except other brand new people.
---
Been tink in my odd warrior to great effect for a while now
---
Something tells me that "Astonishing" didn't end well for OP.
---
Down votes don’t bother me, thought it funny, so posted it, also I am on mobile can only see 0, didn’t know it went into the minus.
---
Imagine if Team 5 communicated with the community on stuff like this.
---
This time for sure! *epic gnome jingle*
---
Yup, same thing as with a Voltron combo. When Mecha’Thun dies, as long as you control no other minions at that moment, you win.
---
or they might just reuse the earlier quests. there are even some new sounds for the event in that patch.
---
&gt;I like this take. I understand that Death Knight Hero Cards especially have fundamentally changed the way we think about and play Hearthstone. That's a lot of power for just 9 cards to have (and let's be honest, it's more like 3: Jaina, Gul'dan, and Rexxar, with some credit also going to Valeera the Hollow).
---
Don't forget my Shadowbro. 
---
wish it was a troll comment, but sadly, this is the reality of hearthstone now, which used to be a fun and interactive (!) game is now just catering to a very small segment of players - not even sure why people are so happy with this hunter/otk/odd meta, I do understand the joy of winning with a higher winrate, but it makes the game dull and boring
---
I took the Hatchling, having it with 2 Amani War Bears is not that bad, and that's literally my only q drop
---
your facts are wrong. Hunters are neither auto win nor braindead. Odd decks are not "no interaction". 
---
It *should* IMO, go down for damage purposes as well. The card does not specify "costs X less for Y reason, *while in your hand*" it says costs X less for Y reason.
---
I have a hard time seeing it be broken pre-rotation, even before the Saronite Chain Gang change. 
---
Post-rotation it's hard to judge though, and I guess that's always a concern. 
---
It's the tossup between destroying the deck; winning if he isn't holding 3 specific cards, losing if he is, or not destroying the deck; always losing
---
I have one of those on my friends list. 
---
&gt;  the general vision for the future of the game. 
---
It seems that nobody knows the answer to that question so AMA is canceled.
---
Having played the deck extensively the biggest problem for me is aggro or strong midrange when I don't draw clear on time.
---
The deck is extremely draw and mulligan reliant to the point of not being able to draw at all, also deck is low on minion count and it has only 4 low cost minions with dismal stats ( 2 cost 2/3 and 3 cost 2/2 ).
---
Some games i literally  pass turn or just use hero power until turn 6 when I can play the 6 mana spell, after that its either play a board clear waiting for gallery or go nuts with big minions play.
---
After this point or after insane lyras turn it is really difficult to be in a winning position but it is still doable with rexxar or faster otk decks.
---
A few pointers:when the opponent plays gallery but does not outright kill you it means he still has to draw spells for combo or not have mana: keep track of minions summoned via gallery and played from hand- of he played velen and malygos it is likely priest will wait for spellstone and damage or only one of the two.
---
Try polimorph and or silence velen and malygos when played by hand.
---
Last thing keep track of spellstone and eternal servitude usage, if priest does not win after having used all of them your win should be easier, just always be on your toes for unexpected bursts
---
Odd Rogue and Even Shaman are the top 2 decks in Wild right now. Both are receiving a *very* slight nerf. Both decks will still be very strong. 
---
Even Shaman has plenty of options to fill the Flametongue spot. It will still be a top deck due to 0-mana 5/5 and 4-mana 7/7 and 0-3 mana 8/8. Without Flametongue, perhaps Windfury becomes a staple in order to add that burst from hand.
---
Odd Rogue is only losing out on cheap burst. That is not a big deal for them as they will still be aggressive and push your face in. 
---
But if you really want to go and delete those decks, then by all means, go ahead!
---
&gt;Whats the downide to these moron-proof Priest decks right now?
---
Has no reliable board blear early on so is weak to early aggro
---
He proceeded to double tuskaar fisherman into a four damage blastwave a few turns later which I don't think I could've beaten were it not for FLJ, not sure he needed to take the risk (though I don't know what the rest of his deck had in store for me and it would be pretty sick to get a chance to play FLJ in Arena so who knows)
---
I am not sure if you're oblivious or intentionally ignoring the fact that 4/5 of the nerfed cards were classic. 
---
Nerfing non OP classic and basic cards to balance rotating expansion archetypes is about the worst thing one can do. They clearly should have nefed the OP expansion cards themselves. While Baku is hard to nerf, candleshot, flanking and rexxar aren't (can bump rexxar cost or even his HP cost).
---
Hunter's mark is not problematic and has not seen play for the majority of Hearthstone history. This is a mere statement of fact, a fact that you seem to intentionally ignore. The problematic cards such as candleshot and Rexxar were not nerfed. 
---
&gt;Given that the majority of hearthstone players don’t play wild
---
Hunter's mark is a **standard** card, the effect of nerfing it is felt in **standard**, wild is a completely unrelated issue. Nerfing evergreen standard cards effects standard way more than wild, since the wild all cards share the same status, no matter their origin, not so in standard.
---
Can be worst, i've got prince 2 and then mistcaller on 6 and both time the shrine was alive
---
Finally with that Firework Tech I can afford mech hunter
---
Stop spending money on this game. Problem solved. 
---
I know... its a pain. The best counter I found to them is Big Mage with polymorph... You need to Polymorph all instances of Velen and only Velen. You can also use geist to burn its 1 mana spells.
---
Another possible counter is shaman with hex... and... devolve in wild (also counters big priest)
---
The thing is, if they draw into their combo, there is nothing, nothing you can do. 
---
I stopped playing standard because of that, too many decks where you only win if you draw your combo first. I do not enjoy playing combo decks, I like control... control gets crushed by those.

\*MEDDLESOME INSECTS\*
---
Which is one of the cornerstones of Hearthstone - trading power for chance to get more power in turn. Highlander decks required you to build in a very specific way and never guaranteed the outcome, yet they were actively played. Not every deck included Reno and that was perfectly fine. Quests never guarantee you success, you still can easily get screwed by RNG. Not every deck has quests and this is fine too.
---
Currently these 2 cards work the opposite of how every other card in the game works - they give you guaranteed power if you build your deck in a specific way. That's why most meta deck include them, they are too good and break the fundamental principles of the game.
---
Why is this an issue every time they launch an event like this. We never seem to have the exact time and we never know the optimal amount of quest slots to clear to prevent overflow/loss. These things are really critical, especially for F2P players. 
---
Because small indie company... All jokes aside, we're really lacking proper communication with the devs. Especially for a digital card game. 
---
...Isn't that still an upgrade?
---
Rogue steal shrine = 100% winrate
---
Make sense
---
I think this is one of the dumbest ideas ever. 
---
Let's use an example. Raza Priest. This deck was DOMINATING Wild. So instead of nerfing Raza, we "ban" her for, oh, let's say 1 year. Cool, Wild has diversity again!
---
Then we unban her. And hey! Priest has even more powerful cards at it's disposal for a Highlander deck, as well as Raza again! Back to domination. This is just cyclical. Why even bother playing Wild at this point. May as well just leave until they reban Raza.
---
This can be said for many cards. Very stupid idea.
---
Yeah, it's pretty sad to see how bad they are at communicating basic information like this. But what can you really expect from a small indie company that assumes everybody has a smartphone?
---
He was played competitively in different metas since his nerfed(including Blizzcon 2016), so I'd say he's in a good spot as a niche card.
---
Here's the conundrum I always face:
---
I create homebrew decks. Test them out for 100-200 games and while I'm doing that, I'm facing all the top netdecks/archetypes. 
---
I play against them so much, I'm already sick of them and don't want to try them myself when I finally get bored of making homebrew decks. 
---
I have gotten legend with decks in the past (Karazhan Tempo Mage, Ungoro Paladin), but I just can't bring myself to jamming 150 games of Odd Rogue or Secret Hunter in the current meta to "rank up" as high as possible. I'd rather be doing ANYTHING else.
---
 
---
First of all, I see you too are a man of culture, playing tess.  Second, yes I believe this was always the case, though its not something I come across often so can't say for sure
---
Unfortunately I've already spent a bit of cash on this account so I don't want to make a new one. Is there something else wrong with matchmaking? Shouldn't I get opponents closer to my skill after losing nearly every game for 30+ games?
---
That sounds rather cluncky
---
[Here you go](https://pla)
---
The current rewards for Genn and Baku would not justify two deck building restrictions like that.
---
Yes, finish your quest to make room.
---
Wait, the prologue? you get a free Frozen Throne legendary hero card.
---
Because last time BBrode did an AMA, they asked 1500 questions and he said he would take 2 hours to answer as much as he could.
---
You have to filter somehow. In that case they were selected by other redditors voting up the questions that they considered most relevant
---
you mentioned that you had a couple of other legendaries, what are the other ones that you got. 
---
They are but it's a pitty that they seem to hide during the rest of the year.
---
Yep, I guess you are right.
---
EU 80g Quest trade. I will show you my quest but I'd like you to go first please(check my post history I've done multiple quests here before)
---
Ohliuf#2405
---
Dude, it doesn’t matter that they nerfed classic/basic cards, they aren’t immune to being nerfed and they shouldn’t be as I mentioned before. 
---
Deleting? Last time I checked, they are still in the game. You’re overreacting, I’m assuming you’re mainly a paladin player who’s more upset than they should be over the equality nerf. You don’t find honest discussions because you constantly repeat your same worthless point over and over. 
---
“I suggest you stop ignoring the fact that 80% of the nerfed cards were basic and classic.” 
---
Ahh yes they should start it at the crack of dawn where their HQ is. Makes sense.
---
It's 100% this. I play a grindy controlock. I've had to resort to this before plenty of times. In fact, this is typically your best win condition against any OTK deck that has no pressure. Rin on 6, immediately go straight for Azari. They can't really stop you because they won't ever have enough pressure.  If you burn a key combo piece you win. If not, you lose anyways because heavy control decks never beat OTK decks. 
---
Always play to win.

Reno-Fatigue-Quest-Deathrattle-Steal-OTK Priest

OP - Tuesday starts at 10am Pacific time in North America. It is known.
---
Ty. Great user name. If you are wrong and I completed a 50g quest for  no reason, at least you have chicken. 
---
don't really know where to ask this. anyone got a battletag i can add for the challenge a friend quest? 80 gold in it for each of us
---
You could say, "Wow, u/mikebrady, you are really cool and a great hearthstone player! Let me gift you a bunch of packs to help you reach legend."
---
Ghunt10#1251 on NA. Also in the upper right of the page is a link for trade swaps and friend requests 
---
Yes. And that only seems like the correct thing to do. Losing even a single quest ends up hurting F2P players. There's been times where these random events would overwrite or even delete existing quests. So asking for a bit of clarification only seems justified.
---
It certainly looks like they're able to do that based on how many of these things happen at exactly 9 AM Pacific. 
---
Secrets don't trigger on your turn
---
It's not that we complain that's the problem. It's that we often complain like we're a bunch of assholes. There's a difference between, "This mechanic is problematic and needs to be fixed" and "OMG, the devs are fucking morons, don't they even test their shit!!?"
---
Part of the reason that I have problems with the community isn't that the community is passionate but that the passion often spills over into toxicity. 
---
Ok
---
True. But then you get nothing but discard mechanic buckets and /cry
---
Did you really just include spreading plague in an example of cards that dodged nerfs? My lord. 
---
Not mentioning something in one response doesn’t mean I’m ignoring it, I’m simply saying that all cards will forever be in wild, so once you own a card you will not need to acquire it again. Let me repeat myself so you fully understand, you do not need to re-buy expansion cards every rotation. 
---
The sets aren’t being destroyed, you truly are overreacting. 
---
You really can’t take criticism, huh? I’ve countered almost every single one of your arguments yet you still choose to shrug them off as “non arguments.” Wild existing completely destroys your “point” that people “have” to re-buy expansion cards after rotation. If you’re not able to take criticism, then this entire argument is pointless and we’ve both waisted our time. So, goodnight. 
---
try asking that during the month where they reveal the trailer for the new expansion, and it will get shoot down fast either downvoted because negativity or buried by other simple comment that may not even be related to some of the game question/problem people have been asking for a long time.
---
it has been like that for the past few years, i hope this year will be different and they will announce some new mode/gameplay involving pvp with the new standard year other than the plain " hey new expansion ". 
---
my biggest hope for this year is for them to change
---
1. tavern brawl ( 3-4 days weeks change to full week , like how overwatch have it , they even have custom game where you can design the parameter)
---
2. new pvp mode , it could be something like pauper mode or even the recent brawl where we use 2 wild + 2 standard expansion.
---
3. change to maybe the dust rate for epic 
---
*Roars in Oondasta*
---
*Tyrantus noises* 
---
50/50
---
Pewpewpew
---
I must be missing something, what is the purpose of Meat Wagon in this deck?
---
Chest is ok if played on turn 2 with a coin or on curve without coin
---
Dude. your an asshole. Please uninstall life.

In [HS Replay](https://hsreplay.net/downloads/), you can upload your collection and then [search for decks](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#maxDustCost=0) filtered for what you have (or how much dust you need to craft it). It's a pretty nifty tool. I use it to see if there are some good budget alternatives to meta decks.
---
Golden Ancient of War and Lore are some of my favorite golden animations and card arts.
---
Most definitely.
---
Agreed, but they haven't made all their announcements yet. If the 10m is only going to the 32. Then its disgusting. But I doubt it will be. 
---
This needs more upvotes!  
---
I don't care if you hate Hearthstone. To each their own. But if you hate the game, please go find something that you do like and hang out with them. I get so tired of the constant bitching around here when I know that a good third of it comes from people who say that they don't play anymore. 
---
i don't think Mike Donais is the Ben Brode replacement or am i missing something here...

https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9mg4v1/vicious_syndicate_presents_meta_polarity_and_its/e7ek1tj/

The thing is that nerfs shake up the way people play the cards and most people don't enjoy too much change right? Honestly team 5 does a lot to listen to the community and I would be hard pressed if they don't see the game from a different point of view. Balance a game with so many cards and to meet the expectation of their higher up must be tough. It also makes me wonder about the next expansion and they might make cards that can pick up the place of these cards. 
---
Holy shit, I'd forgottem about this and now I'm amazed all over again haha.
---
He’s right though. Meta is a gimmicky wait game.

I mean you can't argue with him. Literally.

Stolen steel sometimes just wins games, especially if you roll gorehowl, supercollider or silver sword.
---
FTP btw
---
It usually takes me awhile to decide what I even wanna climb with. Then it usually takes me 15-30 games to go from 8/7 to 5. Very rarely pick the best decks unless I didn't play all month and just gotta get 5 before the reset.
---
i totally agree that this doesnt really belong frontpage, its nothing special anymore, especially with the changes of getting certain cards back to your deck.  
---
back in the day it was a nice and trollden worthy clip when it was done with the giant version but now you can easily empty your deck and have the rest only draw/survivability until you draw your combo, after that you could hemet your deck and amost always end the game the next turn.  
---
this deck needs to be reasonable lucky against the high agro decks and almost always loses against high armor gain decks(mostly odd warrior or older druid version, which are rare as well).
---
You misspelled Emeriss OTK.
---
Go to HSReplay.net, find the deck you want to beat, look at the matchups page and pick the deck with the highest winrate against it. Here’s the page for Clone Priest: https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/228/clone-priest#tab=matchups
---
Thanks for the deck! Cool idea for sure.  I don't quite understand subject 9 though.  I feel like more often than not I only get 1 or 2 secrets from him and its a pretty dead play.  Do you guys have more success with it?
---
In fairness, buffing cards doesn't really make sense. If they need to fill a niche they can print a new card or rotate a card to standard, both options giving more balance control than consistently changing cards. Plus there's the fact that the main people they consider when making balance changes is the large percentage of players who only play once in a while and have primarily classic cards in their deck. Changing up classic cards more than needed would go against their current strategy.
---
This isn't a moba where the ideal scenario is every option being viable; having stronger and weaker cards is healthy for player experience.
---
Pre nerf Saronite and Doubling imp had the same text...
---
There has to be something for new players. Otherwise you need to spend like 2k to enjoy wild
---
Well if odd rogue is strong then his even cards could be stronger but what you do with paladin where both odd and even could cause issues? Buffing other archetypes could help but the current issue is that odd and even offer powerful early and mid power that control suppose to handle but control can handle it thanks to the insta kill decks that take advantage of them
---
But that doesn't refute my point. Printing new cards is absolutely necessary if you need to rotate cards and if you need to do that, that's going to mean money out of people's pockets. Of course it doesn't make sense if you're a small indie company trying to earn a buck ;)
---
*shim
---
Definetely*
---
Yea, the part about Jan'alai is very concerning.. They say one of the reasons they didnt like the design of "summon every minion your hero power has killed" was the possibility of misplaying after killing a Doomsayer or something.  
---
Well designed cards should have the ability to be played well, and conversely, the ability to be misplayed.
---
Probably the twilight elemental summoned by that shaman weapon's deathrattle. 
---
I haven’t personally tested it because I don’t have Snake Trap, but it shouldn’t because you need to play the minion, much like Unleash the Hounds. 
---
If you’re desperate and include Dire Frenzy in your deck, you could use that on a snake and it would count once you draw and play that one. 
---
I haven't actually tested it yet but my replacements were glacial shard and fan of knives.
---
I think losing Cold Blood will hit the deck so hard it will stop being played. That said I'd probably throw in the list I'm currently using I'd probably throw in Edwin or Blink Fox.
---
Cool, had me doubting my sanity for a second there.
---
Now we Jebaited

Head crack

Sinister strike
---
Fan of knives / blood knight (assuming odd pally takes over)

Plague scientist
---
Abusive sargent
---
Glacial shard
---
Deathspeaker
---
Blink Fox is already run in it. Or at least I do. For Edwin I don't see that much potential, I might be wrong though. It will drop in popularity a lot, but I actually like to have a fast paced deck so I won't ditch the deck completely. 
---
Lol wtf, didnt even realize that

The other day I dragon roared into emeriss and so sindragosa, sindragrosa got me a another emeriss

I thought it was something about affording a quest priest deck day 1
---
I certainly wouldn't be dusting extras or golds for any of these. I'd add a couple more as well: Divine Favor, Wrath, Sorcerer's Apprentice, Shadowstep, Eviscerate, Mana Tide Totem, Argent Squire, Loot Hoarder, Doomsayer, Acolyte of Pain.
---
Everyone always says that, but I really doubt they care about that, theres no data that proves that refunding dust de-incentivizes people from buying packs; I think you could make an argument for the opposite, really.

How would you nerf baku exactly?

But think of all the funny bug related videos we could of got!

Squish the bugs!

Wait what?!?!

No, Doug is here.

PLEASE DON'T EVER JOKE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF DOUG! HE IS A TREASURE!

Realizing that Genn and Baku are the reason people are buying less packs? Delay to change the nerfs to Genn and Baku bans!??

maybe instead of asking a question, you will probably not get an answer to, why not just do your god damn quests?

advanced AI = playing 10 drops on turn 1?

Just my guess as someone who doesn't play hs lol always hated expansion ai missions when I did tho 
---
Didnt you hear, they are happening at 10AM PST, it must have happened already since it was a few hours ago.  Blizzard isnt some kind of small indie company who would say one thing then do something else.
---
Wouldn't it buff it compared to now since stuff like keleseth or handbuffs would carry over?
---
Update Drops——&gt; Surprise!  Baku and Genn are nerfed!!!
---
A good version of this comment would refer to Mike Donais instead of Ben Brode
---
Then it would be useless with Shudderwock
---
I play such a deck a lot. Has a secret hunter core with just 4 cards replaced (double galvinizee, mecathun, goblins prank) to win against control.
---
Plus side is that you don't lose to Geist, also goblin prank can be good burst if you just manage to SMOrc your opponent down
---
They should make it one mana but only work on one minion.  
---
rip doug

velrak has a good point, why include kingsbane when you can carry 2 infinite-durability perma-lifesteal cutlasses instead?

With MSG it was you got the same number of packs that you had opened.

Well, i did say kathrena package, not egg package. Cut the cheap beasts, play kathrena, 2x savannahs and 2x devilsaurs

1. I recommend having the following breakdown for deck in terms of mana size. 40% 1-3 cost mana, 40% 4-6 mana, 20% 7+. It’s always tempting to go towards the high cost cards but if you do that they you open yourself up to getting wrecked early in the game
---
2. Have 2 giant killer cards. If your opponent plays that one badass card, keep something on hand to cut it down like hex or turning it into a sheep etc.
---
3. Keep a couple of cards handy that can do damage to multiple enemy minions at once  like starfall or consecration. This helps neutralize aggro decks. If you don’t have these handy then get extra taunts
---
4. Similar types of cards tend to work well together. For instance, elementals tend to compliment one another nicely(especially for shaman or mage) while beasts work well together with Druid or hunter
---
5. I’ll probably get heat for this but I think that  warlock class is for intermediate/advanced players/decks. I’ve been playing for a long time now and still don’t ‘get’ them
---
Overall, I don’t think I’ve ever been above rank 19, but I don’t care. I create decks that are fun and I don’t care about the Meta as it becomes very stale and boring
---
Too many players saved their quests strategically. Better make sure to have some.... delay. Not like it's the first patch ever in 5 years... 
---
Pretty much. It absolutely sucks how the collective have the memory of a goldfish.
---
Most of my downvoted comments on this subreddit tend to be around reveal season when people don’t want to discuss issues with the game 
---
FREE PACKS
---
People on NA who opened packs before a certain time had a higher chance (something like 3 times) of tri-class cards being opened.  Everyone who opened packs before the cutoff got 1/3 of the packs they opened for free.
---
Since the xpac went live on NA before EU, the bug was identified before EU got to open the packs, so only NA was compensated.
---
Jaraxxus, because

---
Might be best to add 1x Acherus and 1x Cobalt Scalebane, for some extra speed and some extra umph.
---
Yes but the other guy replying left out very critical info. People have thrown that out, out of context for years.
---
Gadgetzan had triple class cards that were incorrectly calculated in pack randomization. So basically you would get a huge disparity in cards. 
---
Blizzard fixed the problem IMO the best way. You couldn't really force everyone to reopen. Full refunds would have been stupid from a business angle. 
---
So they gave everyone WHO OPENED DURING THE BUG 1/3 free packs. (So 20 free packs if you bought 60 for example)
---
Where this gets incorrectly reported is many of us when we heard about the issue chose to wait for it to be corrected. And those that did, did not receive the bonus packs. This was during a time they rolled out different servers at different times, so the issue was resolved prior to any other launches.
---
Open up each game with an early insurmountable lead? Yes, please!
---
So basically every card which is useful. Watch out u/ostkaka, if this hits nightblade will become viable because it's one of the few cards which are left. 
---
RNGesus, not Stimpyjesus. ;P
---
It isnt uncommon for me to rope while i try to find the best line of play. Or when im distracted, something came up while im in the middle of my game and i have to split my attention. I have only ever done it once or twice to be annoying, and then it was to someone heavily emote spamming me to be obnoxious.
---
Spellstone going to 6 mana is a pretty big deal for Secret and Spell Hunter, even Hybrid Hunter archetypes that couldn't resist putting it in because of its sheer power may not use it anymore. Also, Hunter's Mark's nerf is big for Hunter too.
---
As for Paladin, yeah Odd Paladin wasn't directly nerfed, but I bet its play will see some decline. The last VS meta report (https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-120/) indicated that its best matchups were against Druid (which nobody plays), all Hunter archetypes (which will see less play thanks to nerfs), and Odd Rogue (which might see less play because of the Cold Blood nerf). Logically, if the archetypes that Odd Pally thrives against get played less, the archetypes that it struggles against will be played more, so the deck will perform worse overall. Could be wrong, but that's what I'd bet on happening.
---
April, yes.

Applojuice#1851 NA, 80 g trade. I'll show, you go first. I've done this many times.
---
You're right. I'm getting so tired of people asking for packs all the time that I think I'm gonna need some packs to get through this.
---
Didn’t something like that happen a year or two ago that ended up changing Naga Sea Witch and breaking wild for like the better half of a year? Hopefully they don’t assume this time lol
---
Idk man, it’s not THAT hard to remember if you killed a doomsayer with your hero power or not, and honestly...just don’t kill it with your hero power ever.  It’s not that hard.  If you can kill it with your hero power, you can kill it with something else.  Just hero paper first and then attack instead of the other way around.
---
Did you just say... free dust?
---
Or you should treat all regions equall.. or shit, it's already nerfed!
---
What did you do
---
Harbinger: Secretly an amazing card because some people might have no idea what it does, misread it, and not know how to play around it.
---
Right, but I've won more than a few games off an early Cold Blood on an Argent Squire or another early minion. Cold Blood is more than a finisher, and I really think it'll be tier 3 at most, and with better aggro decks available won't be played much.
---
Swap out Ironfur Grizzly with Silverback Patriarch. You lose one point in total stats but you gain an intimidation factor with a 75% chance of your opponent conceding on the spot
---
Seeing people get tired of this and asking for packs makes me feel like I deserve some bonus packs!
---
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of kingsbane players that would like to get refund.
---
OK then make them go first and if they get pissy about it, they're probably trying to scam you. You know what I meant.
---
you can decrease their mana by one and i'd still be okay with these.
---
They found out that Genn and Baku are the actual issue to the game POGGERS
---
Is kingsbane still good? I’m want to use Rouge and kingsbane seems fun
---
You typically can't. The first fight can be an exception though.
---
Fuck Godfrey

#SilverpineNeverForget
---
Start whining about not getting free shit.
---
*Hunter's Mark* has joined the chat.
---
The update is hours late and still not out for everyone. 
---
Yeah, what's the reasoning behind that?
---
I think of Baku stayed as is and started in hand it would be a huge hit to any odd deck that needs to establish a board presence. It would cause odd rogue to run, maybe, 2 more one drop minions, if not 3. I think it would hurt them a lot. Don't think it would matter much to odd warrior
---
&gt; Gral, the Shark now works properly when executing its battlecry more times than there are minions left in your deck.
---
Thats an odd way to word this when battlecries can only ever trigger twice in a row right now. Maybe they'll add some cards that actually stack soon. 
---
Oh great, I like sex
---
What upsets me is that in overwatch everything (like unlocked skins and exp) transfers between regions so it's definitely possible within the battle.net architecture. But the devs of the other games either did not ask to get the same treatment or there is some other reason they are not telling us
---
Yeah, it's extremely flavorful! 
---
I'm so glad they finally addressed this issue. It was without a doubt the single most frustrating thing in the game currently! /s
---
 Looks like two Roadrunners with native american headgear.

100%. I played a Maly OTK Rogue in casual the other day. I was just trying to play my dinky little Heavy Metal Warrior deck, man.  
---
While I don't disagree with that feeling, the problem is that casual means different things to different people. Blizzard has a rough time trying to figure out a way to police it
---
Does this event invalidate the previous statement? Are Baku and Genn not warping the meta because there's a card back going around?
---
And like off the top of my head HotS had a similar thing 3 years ago ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Dude had the balls to shoot Sylvanas through her head in the middle of Forsaken. You gotta respect that!

It is an excellent in-joke for people who play the game, an excellent observation for people who are interested in the game and curious about it's meta. Very good literary device. Hits a lot of points of interest, markers of information published to, "Newsweek." However... Spell Hunter...

There is a 4th special one that you get when you play against a player that has Hakkar's Curse. Some people have already been cursed randomly. I added it as the last picture.

We need a thread to share battletags and get infected!

Probably just that it’s inconsistent.  The bomb from [[Seaforium Bomber]] is not affected by spell damage.

5/5/5 | Battlecry: Shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck. When drawn, it explodes for 5 damage.  
---
Good detail.
---
I had to guess, probably confusing for some players who are expecting 3 damage, but then take more.
---
I imagine that taking damage affected by spell power (Corrupted Blood) and damage not affected by spell power (fatigue) back to back caused some minor confusion. Dying to damage you don't expect feels really bad.
---
I don't know if introducing this inconsistency was the right move though.
---
Happens sometimes, just restart the game
---
I recall a clip awhile back where someone played The Lich King with harbringer up. Certainly happens because the card sees no play lol
---
1. Hard to nerf  
---
2. Blizzard wouldn't make as much money  
---
  
---
So Blizzard is intentionally making the game worse because the right option is hard to do and doesn't pay them well? That's absolutely terrible. Solving problems with that line of thinking is turning Hearthstone into a mediocre game.

I got it in like my first three matches, I suppose people were already infected by the bunch

Flavour OVERWHELMING

I didn't say you should get all cards or decks for free. Just supporting that if you get Wizzbang for free then you can *try out* good decks, which will make you learn the game. I'm speaking from a new player's perspective, not as someone who has spent a grand on the game and doesn't want new people to be able to compete. I'm obviously a player who's tired of spending so much money, but I'm trying to look at it from a new player friendly perspective.
---
Additionally you don't really know which deck you're going to get and new players aren't going to know how to play every deck inherently.
---
I forgot that casual even existed. 
---
&gt; [Mobile] To reduce the initial size of the Hearthstone mobile app, some sound files are now an optional download.

Thank God they finally start to worry about the size of the app on mobile 
---
I just logged in and it actually bump out an old quest I had. Is this intended or not? 
---
Exactly!

A lot of games have these, left 4 dead had one but the devs stopped playing at some point and now it's impossible to get.

Oh yes, because you're an incredible source of solely original content.

Thanks Blizz for your comprehension.

Cho'Gall is a trip to play in HOTS. Since he requires to players, the game is four heroes versus five. Cho'Gall is a straight up raid boss.... if the two players can sync up well.

Look at the names, friend.

Don't dust anything unless you need the resources to craft a complete deck.

How? I didn't get no free packs 
---
It's unfair!
---
dun dun DUN-DUN RAWRRR (dun dun dun-dun).
---
Another HoF Geen and Baku post? How exciting. 
---
The point isnt even it's power, the point is that odd-decks should be about weighing options and sacrificing something. Odd-warrior doesn't have to do that, which defeats the point of the deck.

---
I know I might get stick for this, but my ideal hearthstone would look like pre-Midwinter or late pre-Homecoming Gwent beta. Or, really, something like HS any time from beta to BRM.
---
Not too expensive, fairly well balanced, good deck diversity, interesting deckbuilding, games actually being a constant duel for board factoring card advantage, tempo and value. All gwent decks had an upper value limit meaning that you didn't have super expensive decks and cheap options, but rather you were encouraged to diversify between a number of affordable, accessible options even as a F2P player. You could realistically make 5 or 6 decent decks fairly quickly and cheaply. Great ranked rewards. Separate currency for converting standard cards to premium. Customisation and personalisation options.
---
Not surprising, given that Gwent was essentially marketed to disillusioned HS players (and streamers). Honestly, if not for Homecoming, I'd be playing Gwent over HS right now.
---
I’m an avid league of legends player and Cho’gall is my favorite MOBA champ ever. 
---
Every time I played it, they always held their cursor over it
---
I mean, dragon warrior has a pretty decent win-rate at about 52%. If you're worried changing the mana costs would make the deck shit, then both the cards alongside changing their costs. I'm fine with that.
---
The funny thing is, many people use casual as a "safe" place to get their quests done, without any fear of tanking their current rank.
---
So as a result it's all hardcore meta decks piloted by people with expert precision.
---
