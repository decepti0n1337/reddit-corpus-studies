The account is also only a week old.
---
No I am me.

---
We both have old accounts with post histories on different subs why would anyone think we are the same person?
---
I put a \\ through the second =&gt; but I didn’t escape it so it didn’t show.
---
Minion implies card, but card does not imply minion
---
Someone could still take curator for the free amalgam to start buffing immediately.
---
Also, if you have a Floating Watcher on the board at the end of the combat phase, you won the combat and won't take any damage.
---
Community response is amazing. Love it that you're doing this for the players.
---
Bob is a hoe
---
I like where you're going with this. Keep up depression.
---
I pulled two golden ones, pretty content with that lol.
---
It seems extra bad with Sylvanas's hero power, too.
---
My ideal solution would be to show the simplified ‘how many of each buff’ list on the current UI, and add a sort of ‘advanced view’ feature that would show all buffs in order, perhaps with a new popup window with a scroll bar so it can elegantly display lots of buffs. But of course, Blizzard adding complexity to the ingame UI is probably a pipe dream.
---
Is that an argument for or against it being a bot?
---
what's the name of that card which destroy the opponent's armour?
---
At high MMR it's even worse, 1st place is +30 and last place is -300.
---
Aight, mb

why I cant play more mechwarppers?

Okay, good.  Because I was starting to get really confused.
---
It's Ellon Dust, the legendary billionair player who managed to craft an entire deck in saviors of uldum
---
They nerfed echo so that the echoes can’t be cheaper than 1 mana.
---
14 is insane. Including the free 1 in 10 you get to begin with, that's 1 out of every 12 packs. Didn't even get close to the 1/40 pity timer.
---
I dunno man, she even got the snaggletooth. That's advanced weebing
---
Someone on the Subreddit linked to a dev stating it was a bug. They're working on a fix.
---
It's kinda like you prepped for years and years, finally got to the location and
---
I agree with you. I think lich is really strong but if you don't play her properly then you just kill yourself quicker.
---
ALL GENDERS.
---
Turning a flag on or off on a card should be easy to hotfix in theory, but you are probably right and they don't consider it worth the extra effort to push out a fix for one single card that will be fixed in 4 days anyway.
---
Come to think of it though, the issue is probably that the flag is set for the expansion as a whole, rather than on a per-card basis. That would be a bigger thing to fix and even less worth the effort.
---
Same thing has happened to me. I just mulliganed the quest and moved on. I assumed its because the event is over?
---
&gt; 100% lock for 6-8 if you get stuck with them.  
---
I can top 4 with any hero. Git gud.
---
I believe it would create a card that you can play from hand that just reads "summon waxadread" to summon a new one. Not just summon them. Likely at 4-5 mana.
---
Demons are mean and rotten.  They don’t get divine shields.
---
Can’t you just buy them with gold? That’s what I plan on doing
---
Having a piece of nostalgia isn't worthless. It was essentially a collectible item. It's the equivalent of a company releasing a product again after seizing production of it for years. Essentially your rare keepsake isn't going to be rare anymore and therefore loses value. I feel man.
---
Save the Amalgams.
---
Yeah I also think amalgams will need to go or at least rotated out.  They are fun for a wee while but if they are in permanently then it will continue to get stale fast and really limit design space.  
---
One other thing that would be nice is more buffs to non tribal minions.  There are some nice ones there I'd like to build on but without buffs for non tribals it doesn't really work.
---
https://youtu.be/XNBP18nrRdw
---
Also, the perks reset every expac. So the incentive to buy packs is infinite throughout the game's lifespan.
---
It fused with Activision, it’s not small, even before the fusion.
---
How do you know it's not fun if you don't actually play it? I'm genuinely curious :)
---
You can do it Tinyfin. You just have to believe in the heart of the... wait, that’s not right...

You just need need one island, then you can unsummon...wait, that’s not right either...

They're not battlecries so might as well pass.
---
Speaking of curator, both times I played rafaam I took curator's amalgam. Easy victories from then on.
---
That's an interesting idea. What happens with a corrupted blood or a bomb? I hadn't even thought of that 🤯
---
The two least popular modes of hearthstone should have their playerbases divided in half
---
*aiming*
---
I’m biased with Nzoth bc I don’t have it so I’m glad I was able to run it in my ungoro wild quest priest lol but I agree. I think it was made clear these cards were available temporarily and honestly in 2019, if you’re not reading patch notes I think it’s on you if you miss info. I haven’t played HOTS in months but I still check in to keep up to date so I’m not completely lost when I go back to play. It’s really not that hard lol
---
Thats actually what i based that statement off of. Bombs candles and bloods (probably also scrolls of wonder) all create versions of that spell that you play from hand. So if they follow the same format it should do that as well
---
I'm with you. And i agree N'Zoth is a very cool card, one of my favorites - but to drop it into standard randomly is madness! I use it in wild decks for sure, but its place in standard should be gone permanently... Its just too good
---
&gt; Only those people who buy that content will therefore have access to these 35 cards. Pay (or grind gold) to win, if you will.
---
Is it what people wish for ?
---
I mean i see a lot comment in adventure thread (RoS and SoU) said they like the old model (it guaranteed get some cards at reasonable price) more than the model (just for fun, not mandatory because you get cards from pack)
---
Well, did you check your network connection?
---
Not consistently. Git gudder.
---
id go fourth to the left
---
It's\*
---
I have extremely good connection and I’ve tried multiple wifi connections but still same issue
---
Hey, go outside.
---
Glad this wasn't around with Doom in the Tomb. Shamans would be making trades then healing their Sea Giants.
---
I didn’t actually run it in standard tbh. Right when the event started I had just crafted ungoro quest mage also that’s all I played for a few weeks then I crafted priest quest and made that. I haven’t played it without nzoth but I fear it won’t be any good now lol! I have 2500 dust but I’m waiting to craft new cards now lol. 
---
I did see the issue with the state of standard tho from reddit and I got lucky, the few times I played against evolve shaman I was Paladin and I had shrunk ray lmao
---
Priest has a bunch of things going for it with the Talanji cards and the great value from the hero power and countless other combos waiting to be discovered.
---
While warlock really doesn't have anything, nor does it have a win condition other than zoo
---
This was hands down the next best card game after hearthstone, in my opinion. Really a shame but I knew this was gonna come sometime soon, the player base has always been pretty small..
---
I dunno if it's just me, but I just had a couple games against Hunters where every time their secret got activated, my client would completely exit out
---
It was weird.

This comment aged like milk on a sunny 30c day.

He feels like the nerfed AFK only you don’t get the 2 three stars.

Sylvanas is secretly the warchief of the hearthstone dev team.
---
They stack, because they have differing text for their abilities.
---
Thats lower than #1 though
---
Not a pack, was a chest ;)
---
Many of us mobile players have been experiencing the animation lagging which in turn makes our recruit phase laughably short. 
---
Lets hope that blizzard gives enough of a s**t to fix the issue for us. But you know, "little indie company. "
---
What you gonna do?
---
Bro you’re tripping
---
bro 😎💪
---
&gt;  100% lock for 6-8 if you get stuck with them.
---
Basic comprehension should be easy, why do you make it seem so hard?
---
Janalai is insanely good wdym?
---
don't invoke his name this close to an expansion release. Its bad luck it is.
---
You don't know what is confusing for you. 18 deck slots is extremley confusing for you and especially for new players (Also I didn't know that I had to do it, but this entire thread is one huge /s )
---
They removed the weakest heroes and added even stronger ones. Van cleef is crazy at high ranks. Giving your cobalt +3/+3 every turn for 1 gold is game winning.
---
There were many people who didn’t care and never had to change their opinion
---
It perhaps overstayed its welcome, but aside from evolve, I actually really liked it. 
---
First time I bothered to hit legend in a while, and it was with a hakkar priest that fatigued everyone, so that was a lot of hearthstone.
---
Dude they’re playing chess while we’re all playing uno
---
Try reinstalling. Fixed it for me.
---
I haven't been keeping up with the expansion... I read from left to right, thought the 7/4/4 was broken and didn't realise this shit was real until I got to the armour guy (which I had seen)
---
TH1CC-TH1CC
---
If you didn't have it before domb in the tomb, then you don't get to keep it
---
Unplayable on my iPhone right now. Even in regular mode it crashes.
---
This is the prime example of why "scamming" or tricking people into buying something is so easy. Most people can get fooled over and over again, yet they never realize it (most of the time they don't even want to) or forget it after a week. Capitalism at its best.
---
This wouldnt be good, since the Meta would be more unbalanced if they would do this. You'd see more Mama bears and highly buffed mechs for example. 
---
Its an RNG based game(mode) after all. You need luck to win next to your skill in building and adapting your lineup. Else everyone would reroll for the same 3 or 4 lineups. 
---
The reroll system is fine imo
---
Why would you make your opening hand worse for this potential minimal payoff, especially with all the decks that will likely be using hero cards anyways
---
It’s actually possible that Plate Breaker won’t work, since [[Mindbreaker]] doesn’t

yeah. they are not shitty people. they are shit at a specific video game. that's not an insult. yeah i could have used "extremely bad" instead of shitty.

i am not saying all casual players are shit. i am saying this is targeted for shitty ones of the casual players.

Underrated comment
---
And yet, my phone that's nearly 2 years old doesn't have your issue. Its strange.
---
We are back in, we will do things properly now
---
50 to 25 is basically beginner ranks you gain 1 star and can't lose any once you get to 25 you can't go back
---
maybe u should be saving your battery instead
---
Yeah I'm aware of how the system works, I dunno what the players at those ranks are like though.
---
And the devs are "collecting info" instead of fixing the meta, and wild is broken in some new way and they don't even bat an eye, and people are asking for some much needed features and Team 5 don't even acknowledge it or say "it's in the works", and it's mostly radio silence all around until the next expansion is revealed and Team 5 are suddenly the best devs ever again. Literally. Every. Bloody. Time.
---
But with apologists like you see in this thread nothing will ever change. They'll gobble it up and spend money anyway, and Blizzard know that.
---
hehe butt funny?
---
Can you only open pre-ordered packs? Or can you also buy them for gold?
---
Such a cop-out excuse. George's power is useless in the early game and that can seriously fuck you up.
---
Good concept to shaken up the meta half way through the expansion, but extremely poorly executed. If you invite pro HS players to test out the event cards, listen to their feedback before making bs excuses couple months later blaming it on the patches scheduling
---
Man, can't wait for these packs to unlock so I can placate my OCD and get rid of that little red number.
---
Is it really worldwide? I thought the rank was within one server, like in Play Mode. Congrats anyways though! I could never haha
---
There are only 2 neutral **Invoke** cards and Devoted Maniac is borderline unplayable, at 3 mana wouldn't be great but it would be at least decent so I'm up for that, hopefully we will get more Galakrond support in the incoming cards of the new adventure.
---
yeah, so your still adding a gold on their. If you do nothing, you do not in fact get that gold!
---
If you do nothing, you don't get 1 gold.
---
Or, just change ‘six’ to ‘four’, problem solved 
---
/s
---
If I don't misremember, Golden legs and regular legs had different pitty timers, you might get another legendary in the next couple of packs too lol
---
What?! That slimeball said the same thing to me...
---
Considering Othmar Garithos is an outlier in that he is one of the few genuinely racist and terrible humans that dislikes more than just orcs and Horde members (since his hostility was targeted largely at high elves as well), I'm going to say that the "Human only" rhetoric isn't nearly as good a priority to make from an old, dead Warcraft III character as the theme that they chose to go down: Lightforged Draenei and their more fanatical elements.
---
Unfortunately it's hard to have a putative xenophobe like Grand Marshal Garithos slot into a deck that is largely and rightfully inspired by, well, literal aliens from another planet.
---
I've been meaning to make a psa type post about this and I know it's not gonna work for everyone but screen share apps from pc-phone are godlike for this game. I use steam link for android, but I've seen plenty of other suggestions that I'm sure work fine. I bet there are even some kind if free cloud gaming service that could work.
---
Personally, I think it'll be run in Rogue and possibly Warrior - in Rogue it compares pretty well with Cable Rat (which people also labeled an absurdly bad card before realizing how good lackey generation actually is) and Warrior wants to get a fully invoked Galakrond out asap for max aggression. Even if that doesn't happen, though, in what way is a card being bad "absolutely unjustifiable"? Lots of cards are bad, and even the ones that clearly fit into an archetype often don't make the cut - you can only fit 30 cards in, after all.
---
That is 100% false as I have got her on the last day available.
---
That would be too confusing for new players
---
This is the way.
---
How does it hurt Even Warlock?
---
That’s the joke
---
I play odd-beast Mage
---
Ah ok
---
Mage is my favorite class by far, and flamewakee was the card that really got me into playing the class, but its absolutely one of the most disgusting cards in the game. Back when brd was new I played mainly tempo mage and the number of times I was able to just win by otherwise irrelevant spells plus flamewaker was insane. Being able to combo it with sorcerers apprentice just makes the card totally insane.
---
Waiting on the nerf, I dont understand the thought process behind his ability being 1 mana, its the cheapest way to get a card, it always pays itself back and on average id think a minion on someones board would be stronger than 1 from bobs pool, take a second to mentally compare her to say Elise... lol
---
No it doesn't. Mechs mid-game was nerfed, Murlocs got easier access to health buffs, and still have their insane late-game. And what exactly is a smart mech build? It's blindly obvious what mechs you want to put on the board. Knowing a good build is not really a skill in this game.
---
QUESTION!!!
---
Did you make a new account only for this comment or have you actually just not played any standard at all
---
The general rule is that if your Ramp card does something already, it doesn't give you an Excess Mana card when used at 10 Mana. Jade Blossom summons a Jade Golem, this draws you a card anyway, and Nourish has the option of drawing you three cards.
---
Same bro i had a friend for like the beginning of my hearthstone life who helped me get into this game, we were so chill and always spectate each other when we are on, and suddenly two weeks ago, he unfriended me saying i am annoying him by saying what i should have played if i was in his position, seriously wtf dude, i know you re in this sub and i hope you see this and feel sorry for yourself
---
Yes that's what I meant. Haha sorry I haven't checked for a while and your post was the first one I saw. That's great of them!
---
found a good read here

---
Yeah. Its insane to think this would be a meta card ever
---
Reminder that there were people defending this pack system.
---
It's basically for when you create a new account but ur not thrown right in to the action at rank 25 like you were before, I mean back then you only had 5 ranks of climbing to learn the game which was kinda stupid. Rank 50 is a lot better since you have more time to learn everything and other players cant be "afk" so they derank back to anything above 25
---
who cares dude
---
No, it's just that every subreddit's destiny is to outjerk the circlejerkers.
---
For one whole turn
---
That's better, I salute you sir
---
You almost don't want to shuffle that mahy portals at once. 14 portals with half of a deck left is sufficient to draw half of them and fill your board.
---
I just play barnes
---
Ahh thanks.
---
Tbh it works out almost every time keeping that minion until tier 5 and then selling it buy 6. Only times I've died is if I get unlucky and are matched against either the players in lead or like an A.F.Kay on her power round
---
I played vulgar homunculus with brann on board once.
---
All I did was concede so I'll just drop this:
---
"It's not much but it's honest work"
---
Kripp???
---
Signed a 3 year contract with Liquid yesterday
---
Tell me what ? \*Smile\*
---
How is everyone dead when you're still at 9 gold ?
---
I didnt play much since the event because of how i kept playing against hare + evolve. And against kharthut defenders spam with nzoth. One of the worse meta i can remember. Wish Blizz would bring cards that are build arounds rather than generally strong cards
---
I wonder can you like swap with dr boom and steal like the 7armor hp. Thats massive denial in an aggro situation.
---
Would say right around 50 or so counting in that it was from about 4k and everytime I got Bartendotron I actually played and tried to win so yeah 50-60 times maybe
---
Bring him back...
---
Besides the point and seems they fixed it, no thanks to people like you with that sort of attitude.
---
It's just a normal battlegrounds match but your friend is one of your opponents
---
Awesome! Good to see they are on top of it instead of just being "meh, only 5 days until the expansion".
---
What does this mean lol
---
I did! I bought them all and got a pack leader from my hero power :D
---
The good thing is that in bg if everyone is going for murlocs, demons for example are uncontested, so it's easier to get the essential parts while all of them are fighting for murlocs
---
There are ALWAYS people defending game companies. There are people defending Anthem, Fallout 76, etc.
---
I had a legendary run, so please don't hate me. I opened 165 packs.
---
I oppened 3 Golden Legendaries, Zzeraku the Warped, Cheenvala, and Dragonqueen Alexstrasza.
---
I'm missing a fair number of epics, and got the random lower quality gold card. At the end I am missing The Anchor, Deathwing, Hunter Dragon Veranus, Muzorond, and Dragonrider Talritha. With my two golden legendaries from preorders, I will only be missing 3. But pack wise 17 legendaries, never will be this lucky again lol
---
“low mmr” 5200 is top 1% lmfao, humblebrag humblebrag
---
3 legendaries opened with 118 initial packs. Before pity timer was implemented it was kinda miserable experience.
---
Sister
---
Yeah I thought surely! A classic deck that gets on board fast and has good tools to control it will be good against Shaman. Nope, no fucking chance. I legit believe Zoo will never be good again, the deck's just too old fashioned in concept and Blizz don't realise and keep pushing it's dead carcass along. It's too honest, it doesn't have any bullshit like the best decks do, like not even the crazy Lackey cards or Thrasher/Vulture would save it, that's how dogshit it is
---
Ok, that's fine.  At first it looked like you were trying to justify their actions, but if your just seeking to explain, then that's fine.  So, out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on why the Chinese government has only relatively recently begun targeting the Uighurs so extremely?
---
they aren't golden unfortunately, just normal legendaries
---
10 without counting the golden ones i will get when launch
---
I got 5 legendaries in 163 packs, ngl quite unlucky. Atleast one golden thov
---
It would be a nice interaction. I hope Blizzard makes it work.
---
Battlegrounds is a gamemode in hearthstone. this is the subreddit for hearthstone. where is the issue?
---
I somewhat agree with you, but I don't see the smurfing as a problem.  
---
What I mean is that people smurfing are in the top 1%, so if the game involves skill, they climb fast from the bracket you matched against them.  
---
I don't know can we dissagree with high mmr, since it's based on statistic they have.  
---
BTW I found answer to your last question: [https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23239989/](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23239989/)  
---
Scroll down to the bottom.
---
Yeah I could have played the 2/2 first but I wanted to play healing touch first. I froze first to presume he wouldn’t give removal but I was dearly wrong. 
---
I heard he considers hero powers because if your opponent is at 10 and you have no lethal he will offer a pyroblast vs everything but Druid and warrior supposedly (if you control the board and probably a few other minor requirements)
---
holy shit
---
I still don't understand why a second Dinomancy wouldn't upgrade the HP just like that priest card does. That makes running 2x Dinomancy so bad and running one copy is pretty inconsistent..
---
Depends on the meta. If hero powers important in the meta, this combo might be viable.
---
I wonder if people will be running questing adventurer too since this seems pretty easy to do
---
In German it's SCHN1PP-SCHN4PP
---
my poop burns with holy fire
---
there was one card prior to koft that copied your enemy hp. combine that with this, and you have your enemy hp, while they get dinomancy
---
Moths
---
When does the next expansion drop? 
---
I stopped playing a while ago but I really wanna start again after seeing this combo
---
Whirlwind murlocs PogChamp
---
On the other hand dexter had 13 legendaries on 160ish packs. Sometimes you are lucky, most times you aren't.
---
Go to the friends menu and click on the play button u should see it there to entre the fireside
---
Okay now I need some explaining as I wasn't around during Barnes meta care to explain the reference?
---
I really hope I can roll the average legendary rate like you. I'm gonna be really sad if I don't.
---
swap hero powers until next turn... you take their hero power with card on the left, swap it to dinomancy with card on the right, next turn enemy gets dinomancy.
---
Average: 1 Legendary every 20  
---
Minimum: 1 Legendary every 40
---
on the 40th pack, you are 100% guaranteed a legendary
---
oh wow really ?
---
So, how long until we get to see what the golden version of Curator's amalgam looks like?
---
Weirdly enough, the new keyword for invoke is conjure in french
---
Same here. Wondering how other people's distributions got so broken when ours were both so wack.
---
If you can't build a good deck, it time for memes !!
---
Try Innkeeper Ra lock while Glinda is virtually free, stuff like that, even play wild
---
Those are golden?
---
No because after they added the nozdromu I had 5 in 98 packs so is one every 20 which is the average amount.
---
You keep saying 4 mana. I'm talking about its ability for a hero power *refresh.* The flexibility to be a competitive 2-drop in arena or enabling another hero power later is solid.
---
10 out of 168, none of them golden, very average.
---
The "advanced" stats in BG are basically a useless pat on the back. I'd prefer to be given stats that are actually of value and could help me improve as a player. But it'll never happen because the entire point is to make casuals feel good about themselves.
---
i think buffing other tribe like demons,mechs would be a better idea to promote a variety of picks
---
Thatsthejoke.jpeg
---
In my case, some decks show the cards still missing. I have to take them out of the deck to be able to put them back... Wierd.
---
Good luck with that! Make an update on how it goes!
---
Kibler was great!
---
to be more specific - vowel sounds can't touch vowels. That also means its 'an hour', not 'a hour'
---
I won comfortably when playing as him, basically a free hero power as you either get to sell the unit for the gold it cost to use, or you get a useful unit for 2 gold less. And with people generally only picking strong minions, you’ll usually get something half decent from it in my experience.
---
Haven't bought packs in years and I actually gifted away a tree for christmas. They gonna plant it, put the receiving persons name near it and send him the gps coordinates.
---
Better than socks.

Really nice! it's also the hidden effect on the K&amp;C board!!
---
Nothing &amp; Nothing.
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking. Unless you get very unlucky I imagine you can rush rank 6 while still maintaining a good board. It should be easy to win.
---
I wanted to say that becoming a warlock is essential to mage class fantasy. Not becoming one is quite out of character for them.
---
All Galakronds are given to everyone for free

80g trade EU ill show then you go first. Boguin#21695
---
So what u are saying is that if next set comes out and it's pretty weak then it still can find the place in the meta decks, but here we go with another problem, if decks has few different cards but plays the same it's basically same deck. We had few cases where this scenario absolutely broke the meta like cube lock, jade druid, overload shaman, and it was for multiple patches. Can't agree here again :( i don't always play with the best deck because i like playing to actually have fun in game not only to win, but people will always play mainly the best decks. If you give them few average zoolock support cards, they will still play mostly some broken galakrond version of a class, not everyone of course but most of them. So in this scenario meta will change but decks will stay the same.

GPS spoofing
---
166 packs, 12 legendaries, 2 golden. 
---
Thanks RNGsus !
---
ArtoriasSoul#1345 I know about gps spoofing but i dislike talking about that on the hs app as its against their tos. Talk to me over here or send me a discordlink please.
---
Oh thank god, I didn't read anything about that and I thought that this set would be just a dust sink.
---
Really great!
---
Adding subsurface scattering to the tongue would improve it a lot though, you can see the drawing has a bit of it too
---
I also love how Colbalt Guardian, a card that was horrible and consistently listed among "forgotten cards" is now an all-star 4 years later
---
Yes
---
Yeah those who proudly announced their leave, have left.
---
Wow, you got a Dragon's Hoard! Nice!
---
Siblings will betray you for inheritance. Spouses will leave you and cheat on you. Friends will stab you in the back. And yes, even mothers can turn out rotten, but those cases are more rare.

Jokes on you I swap and play Sir Finley(HL) to give the enemy a better HP
---
edit: spelling mistake
---
It’s been live for 24 hours and 16 minutes lol
---
genius!
---
This, conditions are specific, no hidden interactions but if you are already Galakron because shenanigans like Mozorod or anything it does draw the Galakrond AND plays the devastation.
---
No one cares anymore. Americans have the attention span of mosquitos.
---
r/hspulls look at top posts of all time
---
Happy to see that they didn't tear you a new one for playing Murloc Paladin! I can only imagine most people will be glad to see the brawl end next week.
---
Create an unlisted one, only for yourself.
---
Wowzwrs! Insulting my rank (of which you have no clue) is something I've never seen on this sub! You're so toxic and dumb it's amazing.
---
Sadly they don't unnerf things just because they aren't broken anymore. For example patron warrior wouldn't be busted in wild anymore compared to other decks if they reversed the nerf on warsong commander.
---
Presumably because they don't want something else busted to show up again.
---
Deathrattle builds are so strong but seem to be under the radar at the moment.  Baron plus a couple of goldrinns and hydras is absolutely a tier 1 late game strategy. Plus you can stay at tier five (or four with lucky triples) instead of pushing to six to desperately roll for megasaur.
---
Yeah but notice how Blizzard wasn't doing sh\*\* about anything the community was asking for for literally years, and after that little "incident" they suddenly made the pre purchase better, gave us a ton of free packs, added wild packs to the store, and are giving us a free hero. I do not think this is a coincidence.
---
Same thing happening on my Note 9. I doubt a new phone would help lol this thing isn't exactly strapped for resources to run a game on. It gets so shitty in fact that after completing a disgustingly low frame rate round I only have 20 seconds left to buy and it takes like 9 of those seconds to purchase and play a card
---
your problem is that you are setting the gathering time too soon to the current time
---
Dinomancy on a stick is the hearthstone card I’ve waited my whole life for. Easily my favorite hunter archetype.
---
The very sad part is that midrange decks are dead. Forget pure dragon decks with no OTK combo. Dragon priest was my favourite, I had my first golden hero portrait with that in Wild... Elemental Shaman, as a midrange deck is useless, too.
---
Primus sucks
---
Like all the streamers and just about 98 percent of us noobs admit doing that exact same mistake. The remaining 2 % are lying.
---
What happened if I do brann + grizzled wizard?
---
Does it switches back?
---
Or do I get the opponent's hero power permanently?
---
HSReplay data is unreliable because of how they decide which decks to identify as Highlander — they count them as such if a Highlander cards get played.  Because Brann and Zephrys have such high impact/winrates it’s skews their data, with all the losses where neither is played getting dumped into “Other Hunter” or “Secret Hunter.”  This sort of thing is true for all the Highlander decks (all decks actually, it’s just more pronounced for the Highlander ones).
---
The actual winrate is much much lower, which is why I’m not seeing that many of them at rank 4 whereas the road to Legend was nearly half Shamans for me before.
---
Im missing avenge, mysterious Challenger, sylvanas and ragnaros. Gonna delete forever if i don't get them back.
---
No I'm not I wrote I will check it out. Nevermind thank you for your help.
---
Makes me think that we should be able to share deckcode via ingame chat
---
Depends on your hero. Grizz with Lich King revive can really generate a lot of value. Also need a NA with poison taunt and divine shield
---
Every class got legendary dragons.
---
Either the Unspeakable or the Wretched. Fel and Void energies can overpower everything else in insane doses, depends on just who is more jacked up.
---
Maexxna exists...
---
They’re making battlegrounds worse so you go back to the regular modes and start buying packs for Decent of Dragons lmao
---
I bet the dev team hates this card so much

---
If you could afford an account with that much dust why not buy 1 of each pack until you hit the pity Legendary (first 10 packs)? If you're into Wild those packs are going to be added to the shop soon-ish.
---
Obviously it may not end up being as much, but if you disenchant extras you should be able to craft at least one full meta deck, or a budget version of 2x or more meta decks, or ?x of your own design.
---
Besides being against the ToS players agree to when signing up for an account, it's also a great way to waste money on something that's stolen back by the original owner. Obviously not all people that sell accounts would do so, but there's enough cases that it should be worried about. Also the risk of a ban.
---
Me since vanilla tbh
---
I agree with a lot but you are not at an advantage for attending a fireside bar purely opening packs early. You can't create decks at a fireside that would be true meta decks.
---
The streamee early access I agree is a bit sad as it does remove some unknown fun.
---
That’s how it worked before and created the problem people were complaining about. It leads to the top end of the system endlessly inflating and making the ratings of the top players more about the number of games they play than whether they’re better or worse than each other. You can’t reliably fill lobbies with only players as good as Tides, Collins, or Dog, so flat rewards will always cause runaway inflation.
---
I also posted for this fix as a top level comment, are you new to the note series or do you know how long this has been going on for?
---
 How were you able to open them early?
---
To be fair, Garithos’s racism was mostly towards the elves because he lost loved ones while the high elves abandoned the alliance during the second war.  He might feel superior to the Draenei, maybe, but he wouldn’t not work with them.
---
in latam spanish is CL1C CL4C
---
Streamer event was 5 hours with fresh new cards and zero deckbuilding before, 5 hours after the official release will have  better decks than the event.
---
It's not going to be true meta decks, but there will still be a lot of trying things out to see what works or not.
---
That isn’t value. For mana for a 3/2 and a 2/1 rush? That’s your best case, if your matchup comes up? That’s litterally not even close to a playable card, even if you could play it for tempo on four, which you can’t!
---
Garithos hating the high elves was because they left the alliance to fight the horde on their own, and he lost people because of it.  
---
That said he just genuinely racist, but not hostilely so, towards the other alliance races anyway.
---
No shit, the point is I don't want to see day one net decks.
---
except 2 shadowforms at least boosted the HP to 3 dmg
---
2 dinomancy's just resets your hp.
---
You can host an unlisted fireside gathering without the 3 check ins thing, that's just to become an innkeeper (or whatever is called ) which is to do with hosting actual public ones

There's bug where Barnes, and only Barnes, is golden.
---
No shit, the point is I don't want to see day one net decks that have been tested in game already. Let people theory craft all they want, I just hate that they get played in game and refined
---
Updooted for visibility.
---
He was an incompetent leader by literal description in Volume III of the Chronicles. His xenophobia is unjustified regardless of his own personal loss - and make no mistake, that's what his racism stems from. Personal loss.
---
It's understandable, but not agreeable. And his attempt to pretty much kill any high elf who came his way is heinous to say the least.
---
It isnt bad as an activator to a lot of cards.. and a 3/3/4 isnt all that dreadful
---
Yeah, the only thing that can change that is you not playing. People will put out good decks just from seeing the cards get released.
---
George's hero power gives divine shield
---
"Did you bring some fish?"
---
Or at least let us draw a card or something...
---
Bruh this game has gul’fucking’dan in it, pre lore retcon too.  The only character with absolutely no redeeming features who was just pure selfish evil.
---
So I just checked and that's not really true:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Othmar_Garithos#Second_War
---
&gt;While he was fighting to defend Quel'Thalas, a small band of orcs broke off from the main invading force and put Blackwood to the torch, killing all of its inhabitants. Othmar's family perished trying to defend the lives and homes of their subjects. Garithos blamed the elves for the loss of his home and family, believing that they had diverted troops that could have been used to defend humanity. 
---
So there's nothing to say that the elves actually were to blame. It's just kinda shows he was always an asshole especially considering he was promoted basically purely on his heritage:
---
&gt;By the time of the Third War, Garithos has risen to the rank of Grand Marshal, promoted not necessarily due to his own abilities, but by his father's reputation and title
---
&gt; Cut off from the chain of command, Garithos gave his human army the mission that he assumed the Alliance should have always had: the preservation of humanity above all else.
---
So yeah he's kinda just a douche

That doesn’t contradict anything I said.
---
Did you start smashing your head against your keyboard at the end of this post?
---
I never said it did.
---
It can happen in any game mode; it’s just your connection dropping to the game.  If weird things like that happen again to you (opponent doesn’t play a card and the rope never comes), just close and reopen the game.
---
unstable evolution + shirvallah= board clear with full heal possibility, you just lose massive potential value that you would get from evolving minions. edit: it took me 15 minutes to realize that i am an idiot!
---
thanks for making me fee better lol, didn’t know this
---
5th or worse every time I've tried to use Murlocs since the update, lol. I've not gotten a single King Bagurgle while playing them though. To be fair I suck/have crap luck and have only managed Windfury + Poisonous + Divine Shield board once, and they're far more in demand now.
---
Yeah Dinomancy is pretty amazing.
---
I suppose that works if you want the game to go longer and keep the rag hero power (assuming the wizard still applies if you change hero powers in between), but I was thinking of it as an otk and was pointing out that if you use PO, it will have to be spread out over 2 turns regardless of when you play the wizard.
---
[deleted]
---
That is not the sort of statute I'd want to see on a dark night. The anatomy is terrifyingly believable.
---
Just gaming things
---
Edit: Reading i am actually not sure if you get the pre order ones in the pre-release event. If thats soo your pulls are super nuts!
---
~~First off congratulations on your pulls especially the golden golden dragons.~~
---
~~Its not super lucky tho: If we subtract the 2 golden legendarys from the pre-order, sathrovarr and the galakronds you got 7 normal and 2 golden legendary in 166 packs. This is (besides getting 2 golden ones) quite average since you will have a legendary in your first 10 packs and after that every 20 packs on average.~~
---
Glad to know we have the all knowing hearthstone heir to figure everything out for us.
---
It's not about the art, it's about the fact the odds of that happening are so low, so seeing it happen (in Battlegrounds) would be interesting.
---
It would basically be like getting Reno off of Toki in HS, or some crazy Tess sequence or something like that
---
Your fate has sealed obviously.
---
Oh damn. Thanks for reminding me to grab my Saviors of Uldum pack!
---
Nice! Unlike most turn one triples I'd actually consider freezing that one, especially with Yogg (or Sindragosa). No idea whether that's right or not but I have soft spot for those little guys, especially if another murloc turns up.
---
I've only bought from two expansions so far and the first time was way under the average legendary rate. Second time was a pinch under average. I really hope I at least open one every 20 this time. God I'll be so sad if I only get like 5 Legendaries from packs.
---
dragon paladin is so budget actually, pretty nice since traditionally dragon decks are wallet.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
I mean good classes get side quests AND they have class Highlander cards. So I'd say it balances out in a way.
---
No, it's the krusty krab
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
Hello nazomag and thanks for commenting.
---
I see your point, i did not have in mind the new expansion cards when i was writing that, as i am only playing tft for the last three months.
---
I just had some sad turn-one-patches-hand opponents today and i felt sad about the card.
---
RES filters only work on old.reddit, so you need to use that host.
---
Very true, thanks!
---
Well I’m not sure if ragnaros was an event card too but he’s gone from my collection now
---
I may sound stupid. But before your artwork I didn't know it had eyes so I have to disagree. Enlightening artwork
---
Lich King + Corpse Raiser = Insta-Concede
---
WTF Nice dude
---
I'm looking for that too! PM me
---
King Gizzard and the Grizzled Wizard
---
Right, so if they're okay with that combo existing, any more obscure, more unreliable combo from Reckless Experimenter should be fine.
---
&gt; Just because other games have done it that way, why can't Hearthstone change the model? 
---
The more appropriate question is "Why *would* Hearthstone change the model?"
---
Because right now you're arguing for them to change model to something that seems much less lucrative.
---
&gt; My simple point is $50 is the cost of a new game, why does it seem outlandish to ask for a full expansion for that cost? 
---
It's not outlandish to ask for it.
---
It's also not outlandish for people to laugh at the suggestion when Blizzard is already benefiting much more from what they have now.
---
&gt; I know people say the obvious answer is greed, 
---
I wouldn't even call it greed. It's just good business on their part.
---
&gt; but there is nothing more frustrating than spending $50 and only getting a couple legends.
---
Then don't spend $50 for disappointment.
---
&gt; Would not their long term customer satisfaction be much better?
---
Maybe, but customer satisfaction is just an implement to get you towards profit. Don't get me wrong: I have no doubt a good amount of the developers at Blizzard would prefer their game be much more consumer-friendly. They want to make their game as fun as it can be and as accessible to as many people as it can be. 
---
But higher-up you're going to have people looking at the figures rather than the ideals.
---
Be careful, Rafaam is peeking on the side. He must've smelled the tasty fish.
---
That wasn't even yours, you just mind controlled it.
---
I'd say it's a hard counter card for combo decks to beat their traditionally bad matchup into armor-heavy warrior and druid decks. A combo deck that can OTK opponents who are at or slightly above 30 health but has problems beating high armor totals that warrior/druid can put up before the combo goes off would probably like being able to peel all the armor off with one card if warrior or druid are common enough in the meta.
---
escpially for wild.  when is nerfed for standard,and revert for wild(most nerfed cards would be just fine unerfed in wild)
---
like spellstone form hunter,not issue in wild at all,right before rotates it gets nerfed.
---
It doesn't disable it but it completely resets their progress. If you're playing a deck that can do like 35-40 damage in a single combo you could put a warrior into OTK range and then kill them before they regain enough armor to withstand your combo.
---
Top 4 is a win and counts towards your 3 wins for 10 gold
---
all right, thanks!
---
warsong should be reverted and reworked slightly.
---
still gives charge to 3or less but once goes over 3attack they loose charge(issue always was 20 +attack charging frothing not the patrons)
---
or give it rush but with 3/4stats
---
PM Me I'm down
---
or devilsaur eggs with this.
---
Unnerffing is also buffing
---
- there's 5 dragons in the Hunter Highlander, including the new class ones. You don't necessarily have to have a ton of dragon synergy with them since they're all good by themselves which is what Highlander decks are all about- consistency. 
---
- Elise is not in Druid Highlander because there's a lot of expensive minions and you wouldnt get too much value from her. Because there are 3 ramp cards, I focused less on early minions like Scalerider and more on swingy mid and late game minions. 
---
- Evasive feywing isn't as bad as you think, especially because it's a good 4 drop to follow your curve of 3 drop dragon synergy cards, and is really good when buffed. Firetree witch doctor is overrated IMO because with the full amount of cards in a rotation "random" effects of cards have a high chance of giving garbage. 
---
-Shield of Galakrond is more defensive which is good in this rogue deck so we can stall to get value from the Waxadreds. 
---
- I admit I overlooked Sea Giant in Galakrond Zoolock and think that is a pretty good inclusion
---
Before calling something unoptimized perhaps ask why certain choices are made the way they are.  However, I appreciate any and all criticism as long as it is constructive. Hopefully this answered many of your doubts!
---
Such RAW power.
---
Wait what
---
Because Thijs invented it back in the 1840s?
---
While they look like amphibians, murlocs have gills and are indeed fish. They are amphibious but amphibious fish are not unheard of (look up mudskippers)
---
Grizzled wizards hero power exchange would have expired by the next turn so you can’t use 8 dmg?
---
I have your update, they aren't doing jack shit. blizzard does not care about their players, they care profit. they are way to lazy to do anything for such a small group of people. They will wait and let you suffer.
---
No because undoing a Nerf requires them admitting that the Nerf was not the correct solution. By calling a buff 6 months later they can just stay they're addressing game balance
---
I have never claimed it wasn't good. It is just not nearly as powerful as you seem to think it is. At its best it facilitaded tier one decks, which is a sign of a very good card. But compared ot cards such as Barnes, Mechwarper, Snip Snap, or pre-nerf patches, it is quite tame.
---
It is a card that for the most part wins you games you are ahead, if the opponent is either reliant on a board in order to interact or is unable to remove it, so you can use him to burn them down. Being a win more card, makes it easy to overvalue it.
---
I agree their model is somewhat predatory. But I also think many players dust and recraft cards which makes the cost for playing a lot higher. You would be surprised how fast your collection can grow if you have a good arena game and only dust duplicates.
---
the fact that they leave a gamebreaking bug for so long just proves how little they care.
---
For a little bit of context, the left image is of [[Zephyrs the Great]] being played. The right image is of a rare board interaction on the Rise of Shadows gameboard. These two lamps are identical.

Ofc I opened it. Golden cards are great!
