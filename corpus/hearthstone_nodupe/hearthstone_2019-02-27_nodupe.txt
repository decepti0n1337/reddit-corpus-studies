I guess we shouldn't take the 1000 times played literally?

The problem with Bloodscalp, though, is that you only have two cards in the entire deck that can trigger it and you can never play it on curve.

Bobby Kotick created a strategy that revolved around trying to maximize profits without requiring any employees on the payroll. Good morale and job security make a company environment more fun and compelling, but firing 800+ people in one layoff is not particularly fun or interactive.
---
Thats why I added the 4 extra weapons in Candleshot and Hatchet

It is snowbally though, it’s just not in your face snowbally like mana wyrm. The winrate displays this, because card draw= control priest finds all their answers

The first half pretty much explained what I said above Did it not? They didn't say "hey artist do a minimal effort skin." They said if we do X skins in this battle pass we have a Y% chance  of collecting Z dollars. They probably gave the artists a certain amount of hours to create so many skins and a general theme  and this is what we got. 
---
 For all we know they didn't miss their target by that much. They could have very possibly expected lower returns than usual based on whatever factors. Just because the majority of people on Reddit don't like the skins doesn't mean the average population of the game didn't like them. We don't really know how many were sold.

That could work. Doesn't directly give them money, but people using it wouldn't be spending that gold on packs, so maybe increasing pack buying with money.

"If hearthstone isnt your main game anymore what would bring you back?"

The power level of the two cards is hardly comparable. One (unnerfed) could snowball and win you the game when played on curve with some spells. What can a PW:S Northshire really do? Draw some cards?

But I can get like 1 and a half hours on hearthstone on 15%

Well yes, but actually no. You can buy card packs with in game gold or irl money. Card packs is the only way to get better decks.   
---
Many people are f2p players and can be competitive, it just take more time to get your gold for packs
---
What about Alex/Antonidas/Grom/Velen/Edwin/Jaraxxus? Those are all unique, deck enabling legendaries.
---
Epic: Force of Nature/Ancient of Lore/AoW/Pyro/Cabal/Prep/Shield Slam/Brawl. Must have, meta-defining classic epics.
---
If you didn't have Rag/Sylv/etc back then you were just playing a worse deck, straight up. Now you craft Baku and you can play 3 top tier decks, craft DK Rexxar and you have 4 top hunter decks.
---
They're not trying to push F2P players away, they want to bring them in with shiny interesting legendaries. They have the paying customers, they want the new players in. If Black Knight was printed today no one would give a shit. But Baku and Genn looked awesome before they came out.
---
The game is the worse it has ever been. It’s so over powered that any deck you could make with what you have could not compete. Id say play for fun and get gold. Wait for the rotation before you throw money into it

---
If Priest has no decent 1 drop what can it even do turn one? Emote? Northshire at least gives Priest an opportunity to perhaps draw into some more options, and make trades with the puniest of minions. Aggro has an easy time removing it most of the time with direct damage and buffs, weapons, etc. You can always elect to not damage it or play minions until you can easily remove it. I'd argue it is maybe the most annoying early game card but it doesn't win games alone like Mana Wyrm used to. 
---
A game with basically no art assets, one game mode, no story.. etc

Close to 99% of players will never play the Specialist format.
---
Ress pool vs aggro doesnt really matter if you die before you can start ressing
---
I'm confused. How do we use these decks slots you speak of?
---
To add to this, I suggest playing Wild with your Standard deck. Your rank will be pretty low so you'll see all kinds of different decks and it'll make each win interesting.

Yep. I've been on the Abzan and non-Red train for a little while here. It's great having access to everything I could ever want in a midrange deck lol

Yeah a hero voiceline in every language would add up quickly. If the download was for only 1 language I think it could work because those voicelines probably aren't that big in filesize. If hearthstone ever had a update process that didn't have to redownload the whole game each time it would be even better.

Profit and Revenue are not the same thing. The Investors want the company to grow infinitely and at the rate of the micro-transaction boom. So now Kotick's job is to find a way to increase profits until the next sleazy, unethical, anti-fun get-richer-quick scheme comes along.

Non-Even Warlock wasn't as common on ladder for quite some time, compared to Priest, Odd Mage, and Hunter. Cubelocks and Mecha'thun  Warlocks are rising but still no where near as much as the other 3 I mentioned, since Priest basically farms Warlock and Odd Aggro Mage can be a pain for Warlock, since they can't rely on Voidlord cheating to avoid damage. 
---
I love this one
---
Yeah but Token Druid isn't nearly as common as it used to be. If you want to play a token deck, most play Odd Pally since it's the Aggro deck that bullies other aggro decks.
---
I knew that Tunnel Trogg was busted all along...
---
Wait, a minute
---
Nope. It wouldn't.
---
Sideboard play is a complete crapshoot if done before game one, and it wouldn't improve ladder play as we know it now.
---
Granted, a bad call on sideboarding could actually turn a good to even match-up into a pretty much impossible one while a bad call on a mulligan for a good to even match-up would normally only turn it into a difficult if manageable one.
---
Immune and Taunt are not compatible, the Taunt will be ignored if applied to an Immune minion. 
---
hearthstone is very EXPANSIVE game 
---

Taunt is nullified if placed on a minion with Stealth or Immune. Otherwise, opposing minions would almost never be able to do anything other than kill themselves.
---
Ben Brode was a product of marketing..
---
Is Malacrass very good? He is the only card I do not have and it just seems like trying to cram even more value into a deck that already has FLJ.

---
10 years is a long time, staff rotates through. The people that made Blizzard great once are mostly gone.
---
There's a guy on Youtube called MrBTongue that made a video that had a discussion about how being merged/bought will inevitably undermine the developer. Except it was about Bioware and EA and what a disappointment Mass Effect 3 was. The argument remains, though; Activision will inevitably ruin Blizzard, will inevitably bring it's business practices into Blizzard's development cycle. And it's unfolding before our eyes.

No, you really don't need to use money to get high on the ladder. After a few weeks of grinding yourself out of the sub 20 ranks you should have enough dust/cards to build a competitive deck.
---
But you obviously need to learn the game, so don't think you'll have it easy the first few months or so. 
---
I know they have to keep people from abusing the system, but do they have to speak to people like they are idiots? "We just have no way to help you" "we have no way to give back cards or restore dust" "this is a once in a lifetime thing blah blah blah". They make it sound like they had to go on a secret and deadly quest to the server dungeon and find the special crystal of restoration, that beaks if you use it once.

How much of a limiting factor is having bad cards? I googled a basic hunter deck and pretty easily breezed my way to rank 15 but now I'm running into decks with these insanely powerful legendary cards that it feels like I have absolutely no power to do anything against them.

Is big priest that different in wild compared to "standard" of last rotation? 
---
I used to play big priest like mad, even high-rolling myself to highish legend with it one season, and  potion of madness was an auto include in my deck, depending on the matchups I would play two. 
---
Assuming you're on mobile, especially iOS, I think you have to wait for the next one
---
Doesn't wild hunter have a card that summons 1 drops from each players deck as well.
---
And more free packs. No duplicate legendaries. And others need that anor theyre not as populair as hs 
---
The fact itself is reasonable, I think. You buy once, get all future gameplay content free of charge, and the development itself is supported by aesthetic microtransactions, that you get a ton of during normal gameplay anyway.
---
The only issue here is that I really dislike the mtx model itself. It's fine to get loot boxes as they are right now for gameplay, but we should be able to buy coins or particular items directly, if we want.
---
...it was Blizzard :(
---
I think increasing the drop rates for legendaries and epic will mostly do the trick. I'm not spending any money to this game  rn because it's just not worth the money. But i will definitely spend money if i get more value from it.

Sure you can play around it if it's doesn't get buffed by PW:S. How are you gonna play around it then? Do nothing for the first four turns then play a 5 attack minion? By then he has developed a board ready to smack you in the face. That's why Cleric is such a good card. It makes you scared.
---
Congrats!
---

---
its kind of problematic that pretty much every priest puts it in his deck, but its also problematic that priest has pretty much no strong minions and way too many different archetypes in his core set. they cant nerf northshire without compensation... and blizzard pretty much never buffs cards
---
It will.
---
*insert comment about shutting down /r/hearthstone before next expansion*
---
This is basically a bug when it comes to a solo run... once you get to the boss who can steal, they will steal your keeper and thus render anything you can throw at them completely useless and then pwn you anyway. Also in regular p2p games, I never noticed anyone using heals against my own using this specific shrine. Not sure if they just didn't or it does not work. But for a solo run, this is garbage and it basically renders this shrine completely useless for winning all 10 bosses.
---
When you mention Titan could be a looter shooter, I immediately thought that Titan was cancelled because Destiny became a thing. 
---
Could it be that Titan was supposed to compete with Borderlands 3 (or even 2?), but then Bungie came along with Destiny so it was scrapped since Titan was bleeding money and Bungie has more experience in the genre???

Rexxar is fra from a issue in wild he is lot more inconsistent and wild is faster aswell.

---
Nobody cares about wild.
---
There are "rules" for such decisions, but they're only rules of thumb, and the thing is those rules of thumb tend to apply to specific match-ups.
---
The best tip I can give you as a new player is less specific. It's just: learn whether you're the aggressor or the defender. Since you play Hunter, you may often be the aggressor, but you need to be able to see your hand, see the board state, and know what your opponent is and what they're doing to know how hard you need to be pushing.
---
This will take *a long* time. You don't even know most of the cards yet, nevermind what decks other people are running! So don't *worry* about it, just think about it when you play. Are you the attacker, or defender?
---
I have two other tips about managing resources in Hearthstone outside of playing the game:
---
1. Don't spend until you know you'll get your moneys worth. Hearthstone is a pretty expensive video game if you get the Pre-order every expansion. Don't commit *anything* till you know you really want to, especially if you'll end up committing later on "Because I already spent money on it."
---
2. Try to get an idea of whether you should disenchant something or whether you should make something from the dust you have from other people before jumping ahead and crafting a King Krush or something. There are lots of cards in the game that you may *immediately* want to craft because they're just that cool, but that can be a bad idea because they end up being not what you expected. So don't rush into spending resources, or disenchanting cards you own because you think they have no place in your collection or that you'll never use them (especially if you plan on playing Hearthstone for longer than a couple of months).
---
I hope this helps. Welcome to Hearthstone!

Steam has let you combine wallet balance and card payment for years. No reason the blizzard app shouldn't be able to do the same.

you missed the point tho. In many cases the carpenter can by a raw piece a wood and build the same exact furniture with a lot of time and material (they are techniques to fake age on wood that are costly but close to real) , even when it's broken. He don't have to. He is not responsible for the bad caused.
---
Face is the place
---
The solution is actually kinda simple. If you start to think logically for a second and throw the socialist garbage of true equality out of the window there are actually lots of things to be done. One example would be accepting that people are allowed to be rich, BUT no person could ever spend a billion fucking dollars in a lifetime. If we'd limit the maximum money you are allowed to own as a private person at any time and everything beyond that has to be used for growth or salaries in the company that made the money people could get paid fairly.
---
Of course some dickhead could buy a yacht every time he reached his limit. But he would need to spend money and it would be kept in circulation instead of his bank account growing ever more

Its not dead its just a boring format at the moment hope it changes  after the rotation, and netdeckers exist in every card game aswell as tier decks.

I 100% agree with you, if you unironically say someone is evil because he has a different ideology then you're as much as a biggot plain and simple. Life isn't Black and White, if he'd take the time to talk with people he disagree with he'd find out they can make some good point too, and that they polical opinion isn't the only thing that define them.

Secondly, to the content of his reply, you literally acknowledge your deck beats the other 2 archetypes, yet you feel entitled to have a winning record vs the third? You're entitled to win every game?

Edit: Done with Fordewing#2788.
---
You sound like you want to have 100% winrate against everything.
---
The craziest thing is that when people interested in more of a rewarding experience asked about achievements during one of those Q&amp;A, their reply was: "Since you've got all golden heroes, it's time for you to get into competitive Hearthstone", which completely misses the point of what's being asked for and reflects a complete unwillingess to satify the veteran playerbase.

Thats IF you have spirit of the dead on the field while your powerful minions die. And then IF you manage to summon bwomsandi and have room in your hand for the minions. Considering the spirit of the dead is going to be a priority target as soon as you get it summoned, its a stretch to call it good. Too many variables.

Too bad valve got greedy and stubborn with their game economy and some other gameplay stuff. If they only react quickly maybe it will still have some chance but now it's probably too late.
---
Such a shame, even though the game fail to attract audience , it had more quality of life addition to the game like tournament mode and ingame tracker.
---
Ironically the mod(dota autochess) of the mod (dota) for blizz game warcraft 3 is the hot cake right now ,it have better attention than artifact and able to retain it, come next expansion ,i don't think we will get any new way to play other than the usual new card and mini adventure. No  new mode or big quality of life improvement like ingame tracker/achievements/native replay feature.
---
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

Easiest solution here is to quickly concede and play someone else. It's casual, just move on. 
---
That's what I do whenever someone starts roping me. Take my turn and then watch tv. 
---
They are junk in the sense of you probably won't use it, but if you plan to give open packs from that set, you might not was to dust them just yet unless you really need the dust. You don't want to open up that legendary again.
---
If Devilsaur is summoned by other means other than playing it from your hand, the Battlecry does not trigger and it can also attack face, while Rush minions would not be able to do so. That's the whole strategy behind Deathrattle Hunter, Big Rogue and other decks that feature the Devilsaur.
---
I would agree with you, but I would very much expect them to do both instead - sell more cosmetics but don't change the card economy at all. 
---
Just multitask and do other things while waiting for your turn. You can even rope them back and turn the game into a 40 minute affair.
---
Deck code is in Reginald post.  😃
---
I think it’s pretty funny that you got so focused on the whole “next to each other thing”
---
I hear people saying “it’s a card game it’s different”, but nobody ever actually follows that up with an actual argument supporting why more consistent balance changes would be bad for the game.  “It’s different” isn’t enough.  Streamers have stopped playing the game.  Top pros have gone on twitter saying it’s always stale.  But you think what they’re doing is correct?  Just nerf the base set out of existence and leave obviously toxic cards while never buffing interesting bad cards?  From a game balance and design perspective, how is that working?
---
MSoG was emblematic of everything wrong with hearthstone, in a nutshell.
---
 Jade idol was a horrifically oppressive control deck, where if you didn't kill your opponent at a certain turn, you'd lose, no matter what. Mana, card advantage, board advantage, nothing worked.
---
So, to combat this, they released most aggressive aggro package I have yet to see in Hearthstone since. Patches the Pirate is, in fact, the worst card Blizzard has ever printed, and in amazing Blizzard fashion, took them a YEAR and a half to nerf. Pirates, for me, was so hated, that I think Blizzard will be cautions to ever release that archetype again. 
---
And then Kazakus decks, the only deck that could win against either, but if you didn't draw Reno Jackson at exactly when you needed it, you failed. Ultimate high-roll bullshit.
---
And of course, the Grimey Goons, a archetype that utterly failed, no one remembers it exists.
---
Each one of these problems exist on their own in later expansions (currently, the oppressive control decks are king), but MSoG, so far, was the only shit show to have all.
---
I will always remember that expansion when all of my Hearthstone friends quit the game, and I haven't seen them since.
---
Uh, no.
---
I'm still playing hs. I still find it a fun game. I still put money on it for I still have a desire to complete the full collection. But, despite I thinking it is still worth putting money on the game, those business practices makes me feel guilty about indirectly fueling those suit men greed. I don't know how much time till this feeling becomes bigger than my fun playing the game and my will to collect all the cards. IDK how much time I'll keep playing if blizzard/Activision continues with that BS.

Your argument for Polymorph being OK is that the 1/1 can be used for lethal, so it’s balanced? Hahahahahahahahah
---
Wow. Great responses! Thank you so much everyone !
---
Your win condition is fatigue. You survive and deal with all their threats, until they don't have cards anymore, and you still generate value with Boom's hero power. In other words, pure control game plan. 
---
True, doing that too.
---
If only you had a phone to look up what happened at last years blizzcon lol.

As I said I play on an iPhone.  No deck tracker.  I didn’t keep a manual record of those games.   I know for sure that I won 26 more games than I lost playing approximately 400 games.

They're buffed up with \[\[Anti-Magic Shell\]\] which gives them +2/+2, "Can't be targeted by spells or Hero Powers" and this visual effect. Another +2/+2 buff comes from Mal'ganis. The Lich King has been on board for at least four turns, as seen from two \[\[Obliterate\]\]s in the history bar, Anti-Magic Shell played, and a Lich King trigger animation in the history bar.

Honestly I play specifically to hit legend. I play a bit during the month but usually I play a lot right at the end of the month. This month I played for probably a couple hours a day on average for maybe the past week ish.

As much as I hate the argument myself, think about all of the people that play for free. Constantly nerfing AND buffing cards will throw them off. Imagine you're f2p and put all of your resources into kingsbain rogue to then get 80 dust and a deck that doesn't see play anymore out of nowhere. There definetely need to be more and constant balance changes. But it's not like "just nerf good/broken cards and buff weak/niche cards. Easy, duh!". it's not that easy. No one is trying to defend blizzard/team5 in what they've been doing the past 2 years. But look at your own "ArGuMeNtS" first, before starting a whole "you guys don't have a point" thing. 
---
Cant do that if the Druid gains 10 armor per turn
---
You get the full dust value for nerfed cards. If you craft Baku, you spend 1600 dust, if Baku gets the nerfhammer you get 1600 dust back after disenchanting it and not 400.

Lol, no.

Yea de is pretty one sided. 4 legendaries = 1 of your choice is just an awful exchange rate. Used to not be as bad when decks weren’t as pricey.

well i cant speak for others but i have a odd warrior just because i can... i wanted to try all types of things when i crafted baku... i know its probably a trash deck that makes zero sence but i wanted to try it - i play at low ranks so something dumb thing can still be fun and somehow successfull 
---
when the Hall of Fame is announced, what is the most "profitable" action to do? Craft them all gold and get the dust back and you can get also a good dust reward after the change?
---
Also, if you have the golden and non-golden cards being hall of famed how do you get the dust? For the gold ones or for the regular ones or for all?
---
And you think you did? You're just salty you lost to some zentimo and hex shenanigans and now come here with your ThOuGhTfUl InPuT. 
---
I just really want a "meta" page like for Standard where you can see all of the winrates by class and then view the matchups.
---
DISGUSTING
---
No one needs to read through your wall of text to know TL;DR- I lost to shaman. Nerf pls sjaman so OP! 
---
It's been a few months since someone karmawhored this tidbit. Was wondering when someone would bring it up.
---
What should blizz do? Give money to people working on games and departments that were cancelled? Sometimes people lose jobs, it's not even close to what happened at Nintendo. 
---
Found the big priest  
---
Situational reactive cards need to be good otherwise nobody would play them
---
Solid advice here.  It takes time to learn how to "read" the board state and match ups, but that's part of the fun!
---
Old blizzard that had a more fun culture sure couldn't figure out how to make profitable games. Good thing this guy came in fixed the culture and now blizzard is more profitable then ever. /S
---
I doubt it.   
---
Hearthstone has the type of stupid RNG that Kripp's chat goes crazy about and that shit provides more diverse highlights.  
---
I only foresee him switching to something like Diablo 4 or D2 HD, and that's mostly because interest would be gigantic for the first months.
---
Congratulations! I was in the same boat. Got to rank 1 and 5 stars for both December and January, then finally broke through to Legend this month :)
---
&gt;do you agree that hearthstone is an esport
---
Nö. 
---
So, Zentimo and Hex morphs three fatties and dilutes the resurrect pool after they've been killed. How many classes can do the same thing with just two cards?
---
I picked Bunny because I usually watch his streams and he is pretty good.
---
Where? Mage frostfire was 11th.
---
I actually play(ed) Thaddius Deathrattle Rogue but I do find it funny how people keep wrongly guessing my playstyle, which goes to show just how many decks are countered by Hex.
---
Situational reactive cards can have a downside, you know? Compare Hex to Rogue spellstone, which kills a random enemy minion for 5 mana or 3 when fully upgraded. What's funny is that it's countered by Shaman simply playing his hero power. What's the counter to Hex?
---
@ r/hearthstonecirclejerk : I know something funnier then 4mana 7/7
---
NA - YOLO#1465 . TRADE 80G PLAY A FRIEND QUEST
---
probably not, since it isn't a team game. If an overwatch team takes 1st in a tournament, then each player on the team takes 1st. Team games just have more winners.
---
Or he just conceded because he figured one more minion comes out and he can't deal with it.  It's not like this was a bluff from a losing stance.
---
I've never lost against an even shaman, but maybe I can break the meta
---
I'll make the leap when they release a mobile client. I never play HS at my computer.
---
Yes
---
I am saying this from competitive perspective, dont be salty wild players. Everyone knows wild existed because devs cant fix OP cards. 
---
yes what?
---
Are you interested in playing wild or at least want to have the option? 
---
Keep the cards.
---
Are you not interested in wild and would rather have a lot of extra dust and commit to the standard format?
---
Dust them.
---
&gt; its worth to note that if leeroy does get HoF you'll get full dust value if you chose to decraft him.
---
If he goes HoF I'm pretty sure we get full dust value back automatically without having to dust him, and we could still dust him too for another 400 (or keep to play in Wild)
---
I was so so so close to dusting the Gold Chameleos the other night, but I've kept winning (only rank 41) with my basic upgraded Pally deck, I started to think "Maybe I shouldn't be hasty"...but I think I am getting hung up on the gold part lol...logically I should have been insta-thrilled to pull it, knowing it would pay for a Baku :P
---
Do u think there is a chance for a f2p player to enjoy wild? I am really efficient with gold also , now in process of gathering 12k for next expansion. Also is there a list of card that are rotating?
---
Welcome to r/LateStageCapitalism
---
Come on, at least try to make a witty zinger. What's next, digging through my post history?
---
I wonder wether Trump is gonna pick pokemon shield or pokemon sword :/
---
Yeah I had a lot of issues with this one. Was probably my hardest. I went for water spirit and direhorn stomper and built a mostly big deck. Had ragnaros, lich king, tyrantus, forgotten one, oondasta, etc. Water spirit is crazy good. You also need to bring a little bit of control and try to round out the deck. Can't have all big ones. 
---
So people are asking for it since 5 years, and he SUDDENLY wakes up? no way, no more lies.
---
Not really, the intelligence and raw skill edge you have in the game is almost imperceptible.
---
If you are within the top 0.1% of players based on reaction time in the world, you are probably good enough to try your hand at pro FPS games, and based on that you will be shitting all over say the 98th percentile. If you are within the top 0.1% of "smartness" or whatever proxy you want for core Hearthstone skill, your edge over the 98th percentile will not be anywhere near what it takes to call the esport "easy".
---
In short, sure, you don't need to be that much better than the opposition in absolute terms, but the flipside is that everybody and their mother is trying to go "pro", increasing your variance due to the low edges to be had.
---
Also this website sucks.
---
That's not what it says *at all*. I'm actually amused. What else did I say in my OP?
---
0 freinds FeelsBadMan
---
It was fun for the most part. I'm not a fan of the warlock ones though. I don't like the playstyle. 
---
This happened to me on my iPhone a few weeks ago. After trying—and failing—at all the obvious solutions, the problem solved itself in a few hours. I think something might have been downloading in the background.
---
Clearly there's some concern, though, given Iksar's recent inquiries and other dev tweets and comments. I know because I'm one of the signals of that concern. I've played since the closed Beta. As of now, I've given up the game. The Blizzard app on my PC is shut down. HS is no longer on my phone. My complaints aren't centered around goals, achievements, or single-player mode, even though all of those are valid complaints and desires. Mine is based around Standard play and design. It's just too repetitive (Hello, Genn and Baku!) and all of the sets in Year of the Raven have been impacted by that. If they come up with a solution to the odd/even issue, maybe I'll think about it again. But, as of now, I have zero interest in returning to HS.
---
do the numbers represent your attempted runs for each shrine ?
---
No offense but this shouldn’t have taken you 45 minutes.
---
Percentages don't carry the same value between countries of vastly different sizes. It's harder and far more expensive to uproot centuries of healthcare and insurance companies in a country that's nearly a hundred times the population of another, as well as removing all of the pork barreling, corruption, etc all while spending an exuberant amount on military spending. The reason excessive spending on the military and tax cuts is the narrative most people ride with is not because it's the main reason, but because it's the easiest scapegoat. I agree with you, and I think it would be possible  to balance our military and governmental discretionary spending with universal health care (and tuition!) but the bottom line is people don't want higher taxes and they don't (or we can't) spend less on the military which is far and away our largest money sink. The bottom line isn't whether or whether not the country can support the infrastructure for health care; its whether or whether not our politicians can stop taking the money from private insurance companies in order to create the framework for such a system (I don't believe that this corruption is necessarily evil at all, it's just a reality when lobbyists exist)
---
&gt; Tinkmaster Overspark
---
This card was actually nerfed for the exact same reason that makes Hex unfun and *I actually mentioned it in the OP*, except it seems reading is a forgotten skill for so many people here.
---
TO used to have a targeted battlecry that was made random because then the counterplay became to just play more minions and reduce the chance of transform landing.
---
Do you find it funny how you sabotaged your own point and confirmed mine?
---
\*Mammoth?  
---
Isn't Raven 2018 and Mammoth 2017?  
---
If you only ever want to play standard, then dust them as you need the dust.
---
is there a canhce that a f2p player can enjoy wild?
---
Statistics prove It's the highest winrate game opener. 
---
&gt;  People need to accept the game for what it is,
---
And that it will be the same game in another 5 years. 
---
Yeah I had 2 water spirits for my winning +1/+1 run.

None of this is about the specifics, since we are using proxy for skill instead of actual skill (things we can measure vs things we can't).
---
 even if possible should it be so? I for one think having children this day and age is selfish and believe most have their own rather then adopt for those selfish reasons.

I feel for this ben guy, still having hope after all these years. Then again, there are still a lot like him, holding out for the same old "next expansion will be better". 
---
Yes you can. Sweden is very open about that kind of thing. 
---
Where? 
---
I am sceptic after last 5 years. It would need to be a huge addition or whole new game mode, but it will probably be just minimal effort 100-150 cards to milk $ for new expansion and that's all. No longly awaited QOL improvements no new game modes.

You certainly can make the argument that his salary or any salary of that amount or higher is absurd, might as well say goodbye to professional sports by that logic. Regardless, I don't have an issue with the argument that his salary is too high. Where I have an issue is that no one seems to give a damn how these companies operate and WHY decisions are made. 
---
He nor anyone on the exec board, "fucked over hundreds of people". Yes they were laid off, and all received severance. It sucks and finding a new job, especially after working for a company these employees loved. With that said, putting the situation in the larger context is important. 2018 was a record year for the company however, the shit Blizzcon announcements, the departure of the Destiny IP, and having no major new IP releases slated for 2019 means the company is facing a forecasted 17% loss in profit and has lost 50% of its stock value since October. 
---
Situations like these can and have ruined successful companies. In light of these forecasts, instead of cutting the salaries of the execs (which they could and in my mind, should have done), they looked at the larger picture. They laid off 800 customer facing employees (not people to make the product), and plan on hiring 20% more developers (the people who make the product). They're doing what needs to be done to ensure the games we love continue to expand and that the company which produces these games stays in business. 
---
You're making false assumptions based on headlines and articles written by game reviewers who have not looked at the publicly available financial reports and forecasting. 
---
I'm more optimistic than I would have been a year ago.   
---
Blizzard has been getting better at their hearthstone approach, and at a quicker pace. It may just be me, but while it's like that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.  
---
However, I am not expecting miracles, at least not overnight. I do feel optimistic about something good happening. I also know there will still be major gripes left even after that something, I just don't expect them to go away at once.
---
This is very similar to when people used to buy RuneScape accounts from eBay. Buying and selling game characters was illegal so it would be sold as a 'RuneScape joke + free RuneScape character". It was completely acceptable by eBay's rules. Pretty hilarious actually.

Again, I'm not the one that needs to be convinced. It's the management in charge of marketing that does. From my own experience, those environments can be quite risk averse. 
---
Because HS is not making as much money.  Money talks and makes things change.  Unfortunately that is the case here and why all of a sudden they are asking the community for things we have asked for years for. 
---
Why is tomorrow most likely?
---
You know your payement system is in trouble if Nintendo provide a better service than you. 
---
I'll prob give them one more change, as I predict expansion to be pretty important for decks after rotation soledy due to the rotation of sets. Ultimately depends on the cards ofc. 
---
Thats shitty, fuck them! Time to play Elderscrolls legends.

---
Tavern brawl is free to play, especially those that don't require you to build a deck is crazy popular and that doesn't bring in money for Blizzard. It's the only logical reason why it isn't open 24/7.
---
Fire fly is too stronk, should've been shaman only
---
Compare the costs to the potential extra income for them.
---
Additional remember Blizzard Activision Focus is the mobile phone market so they won't make their best game anti-mobile.
---
Wild is actually cheaper in the long run since you don’t need as many new cards. 
---
Yes, a f2p player can still enjoy wild. You’ll be constrained to a few decks, but you can pick decks that share cards with current standard decks. 
---
you have frost fire and steal rogue and spell damage and damage pally
---
I never said Shaman should be "removed from the game". Allow me to reiterate my points by actually *quoting* what I wrote:
---
&gt;Hex and Devolve are two of the most anti-fun effects imaginable that reliably provide a massive tempo and resource advantage. The two cleanly remove deathrattles and minion buffs, often filling up the target player's side of the board with minions that can't attack or even be removed.
---
#
---
&gt;As we get new sets, we're likely to see Hex and Devolve keep oppressing new mechanics as they simply provide universal answers to all mechanics that rely on board presence.
---
&gt;I think Hex has to be given its own unique and interesting effect to make it stand out from Polymorph, which is my aim with this suggestion.
---
&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark also got a nerf in that his transform effect used to be targeted but now it targets a random minion exactly because it too reliably countered too many strategies, just like Hex does.
---
&gt;I think my proposed changes to Hex and Devolve would be easy to understand for new players while making the two spells give a unique identity to Shaman in line with flavor the class already had from Warcraft 3 and WoW.
---
Now to address what you wrote.
---
&gt;your opponent isn't attacking you at all
---
Shudderwock Shaman just plays battlecries and bounces them back without hitting face once until daddy Wock lands. One of those battlecries is MCT, which is what the 0/1 Frog makes me vulnerable to. Play big minion -&gt; Hexed; play small minions -&gt; MCT.
---
&gt;Hex + Zentimo
---
New Shaman Legendaries will just keep making Hex better and better. Polymorph and Polymorph: Boar do not have that problem and likely won't have it at all.
---
500 players, like... did we ever had something flopping that hard? not even nms was that bad.
---
I enjoy a good control deck, and have been funding great success with Quest Warrior and Undataka Druid since they can both armour up past most OTK burst damage combos. Little satisfies quite as much as watching your opponent’s frustration that they can’t play their combo because your health is too high. Of course, it’s more of a struggle vs MeC’Thun but I’ve been enjoying myself this expansion
---
Remember when Gaara turned value town into an artifact podcast?

Pretty much the same tune. "Best game I've ever played" my ass
---
which is why abscando said they need to unionize ... yes they are choosing to work in that field, but software engineers in other fields, statistically, make more money than those working on games... you're saying they shouldn't fight for a better wage because they can go write software for big oil or something?

Give up man. I've had this argument on here a dozen times. Noone actually knows what capitalism or socialism is on Reddit.
---
I bet it is even lower than that.  Most legacy players don't even play their decks because shuffling $10,000 worth of cardboard is too risky.
---
I mean this doesn't sound like the words from a man who starred into the abyss for 3 days so thanks for restoring a sliver of hope. Looking forward how the community features turn out.
---
Do you guys all sleep with those tinfoil hats on? Do they chafe?   
---
  
---
Seriously. They have no problem inviting Kibler to things even though he constantly calls them out on their BS. He just does so in a non-toxic way that promotes discussion. Blizz is fine with content creators having differing opinions. 
---
I think the thing lost in all the doom &amp; gloom of the firings is that they’re *expanding* the dev teams. Hearthstone was always a victim of its own success where it felt like the corporate overlords felt no need to expand Team 5 while the game was already bringing in buckets.
---
Glad to hear there’s some good things on the horizon
---
I always wait till most of the cards are revealed to decide, but I'm leaning towards preorder atm because I blew all my gold on Rastakahn packs.
---
Yes that fits so well to the character of Val and how Blizzard shaped it to be edgy and more distant 
---
Faeli for free packs, mark my words
---
Paladin wasn't as good as priest in the first brawl or better than warlock in the last brawl. Had over 50 wins with those respective classes vs paladins. Games in these brawls are decided at the mulligan anyway due to the snow all nature

Bold of you to assume I wasn't aware of them. This isn't Rumble Run we're talking about though, this is a Tavern Brawl which uses the same mechanics, and while this is true, as I've mentioned in my edit, it's possible the transition to a Tavern Brawl may have caused an inconsistency. My assumption is this might be due to players facing each other instead of an AI, but what do I know, I'm not one of the devs.
---
I logged in using my blizzard account, picked a champion, but nothing happened. Am I doing something wrong or is there a certain amount of time that needs to pass before I get the pack? 
---
Hey, Regis here. I know it's not your responsibility to keep up with my content, so if I can add just a little context here. My latest 3 videos are "How to Fix Illidan", "Cards I Won't Miss" and "Rexxar  Needs to Die", all of which are critical in some way towards design decisions currently plaguing Hearthstone. Even with my custom card reviews I typically select cards I think would solve problems with the game. I would venture to say a majority of my content lately has been in this vein. 
---
I don't play up my outrage, because I don't think I'm a victim of a game I choose to play, but I'm certainly critical when I see issues. I think the difference is I can still find things to enjoy and take an analytical approach, not an emotional one, for better or worse. 
---
I like Hearthstone despite its flaws, not that I think it doesn't have them. All that said, I am obviously in a biased position (as I say all the time on stream). You should always be a skeptical consumer and listen to varied opinions and make an educated decision with your dollar. 
---
It was funny and sad at the same time when at one point it had 3 viewers, and one of the streams was a guy that forgot to change games.
---
Actually to be fair, Regis is constantly criticizing the game in a lot of ways. He talks about how he would do balance changes and how he would improve the cards that are considered bad. On his stream he will openly criticize decisions blizzard makes and give his opinion on how he thinks things could have been done better. If you dont watch his content, you shouldn't comment on his disposition.  maybe you meant to say hes always trying to put a positive spin on things? which I would agree with. But thats the type of positivity this world needs and I appreciate that about him.
---
druid deck is really fun when it goes right, but there is so many high cost cards i often cant even do anything till turn 5, which just means you lose in this brawl especially against warrior.
---
Developers take a long time to get productive, and training them slows down the team. Don't expect any benefits until at least the end of the year.
---
well if u are smart with your gold u do fill up the quest slot every so often cause u dont do the 50g quests. u reroll them. and u keep them as long as u dont reroll them into the better ones. if u reroll 50 gold quest twice and get another 50g quests u have ur log filled up and need to do one. if its today it can fk u up. if u are f2p as me and u try to be competitive every coin matters.
---
Haha I remember playing in vanilla and thinking I was galaxy brain for using divine spirit + inner fire  
---
 .... yet it’s always the same old new expansion rotation. 
---
:)
---
If you are smart you don't try to min max a free to play game that is pay to win. 
---
I definitely agree that aggro is easier to pilot, I just disagree that this is only or mainly relevant on ladder. 
---
It's not up yet on EU.
---
I don't want to jump to conclusions either, but I'd be willing to wager that there won't just be a simple announcement for a new set. 
---
Predicting a new format (something like limited) + more achievements, since it seems basic enough to implement. 
---
I live in a small city, so I don't have one near me. But I just want to commend you and your company on providing this to so many people. Hopefully word gets out and people attend.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if some of the nerfed cards got unnerfed and moved to the hall of fame... Wild Growth, Nourish,  Flametongue, Mana Wyrm, etc like Molten Giant was. 
---
I guess it could lead to more people taking CS time if they regret dusting something which would lead to an investigation and take time and resources.
---
PSA to beware the Mage deck, and not just from shrine shenanigans.  It's also packing Reno, Kazakus, Inkmaster Solia *and* Yogg-Saron ... and it's a singleton deck so all the singleton effects do proc
---
I have a deck for that and it is kinda fun in casual.
---
temporus
---
I can't even remember who I voted for now. I'll just get surprised when at least 1 pack turns up one day.  
---
So portals online?
---
I just drew Shudderwock but I won before I could use it. https://imgur.com/a/a9lpupA
---
Control Warrior does extremely well against Control decks, both now and in the past. 
---
Control Warrior does NOT do well against OTK decks, of which I will always make a distinction.

---
Cacao#1885 NA 80g quest trade, you show quest first
---
Big problem is this deck has no 1 mana pieces and only a couple bad 3 mana pieces. Because these decks are so snowballing I've found it hard not to get whacked early.
---
And yet valves true cash cow.. TF2 has no card game and has not been updated in ages. Valve you really missed your chance to have hat themed cards play a critical roll in achieving victory in a children's card game based off a hat simulator.
---
Classic yogg
---
Was her secret exploding runes and you lost?
---
The new Pokemon generation was just revealed, and the face is one of the new starters
---
I like your idea but hero powers are most relevant in early game for odd and even decks and I doubt it will be easy to kill the shrines in early game.
---
Shaman is able to counter Mage easily thanks to one of its minions shuffling bombs into your deck while the shrine's still alive. That's actually how I lost against Shaman as Mage.
---
I disagree.  I've won my first seven brawls with Priest.
---
The guaranteed 2/3 minion turns your shrine into a 3/6 if they play anything with 3 attack.  From there it can snowball pretty easily.
---
THE [B]ANCIENT ONE
---
pokemon go doesn't have that problem.
---
I stopped playing Overwatch awhile ago and one of the main reasons that I stopped playing was that they kept releasing new heroes and tweaking original heroes like DV.a into heroes that were fun to play but not fun to play against, like Doomfist. 
---
Oh yep, haven’t seen that card since week 1 of the expansion 
---
I still think they would be problematic because either: 1, they start in play and thin the deck or 2, they have to be played which dramatically reduces their consistency. That being said, this seems like the best, most elegant nerf anyone has floated for these two cards. I really like this idea.
---
The real problem is that there's too many "Sunk Cost" subscribers in WoW currently that won't un-sub due to their loyalty to the franchise/friends/guild/etc... but also a TON of people legitimately subbed for the pet/collectible/transmog game...
---
If they don't find a way to mitigate the rioting from these folks - they'll shoot their whole damn foot off for this market. But the devs have even admitted they're lugging a huge amount of technical debt from WoW and there's likely a hidden internal effort to build either a fresh core game to insert into the current WoW game or a successor that will be able to capture the WoW fanbase.
---
Im just saving up expansion to expansion.. usually enough.. no need to preorder
---
I just pick the hottest American
---
Naturalize is as much a mill card as a removal card.  Once Togwaggle is gone I don't think it'll see much play.
---
Holy Wrath I could see I just don't think there's enough people playing the Paladin OTK variant to make it a priority.  
---
Mass Dispel is crazy strong in the right meta.  Don't see it right now though.
---
I'm surprised to see Violet Teacher on your list.  I've always felt she was a high skill card that wasn't busted.  If Auctioneer goes I don't see any way Violet Teacher goes as you lose the cycle aspect.  With token druid not existing right now I just don't see it.
---
Love the discussion though!
---
we're nearing the end of the cycle
---
No Undatakah?
---
No, I did win, but I believe the battlecry triggers first so it wouldn’t have mattered.
---
I just stole street smuggler with rogue and steamrolled the hunter with his own deck.  EZ
---
How would you implement this in deckbuilding?  One possible (and major) upside to this is that you get an additional card and one less dead draw. 
---
I have too.  They're not perfectly balanced but for a week long event, who cares.  
---
That’d probably work well. I whipped this up in like 5 minutes tbh
---
4 mana 7/7 ain't got nothing on a 4 mana 30/30
---
I was really disappointed in the announcement a year or two back.  Completely forgot about the game, kind of heard it released recently.
---
This brings joy to my heart.
---
Its my idea to counter baku/genn without nerfing them.
---
Nah you have one more card in hand
---
It would be too confusing for new players.     /s
---
I wouldn't say he's key or even core to the deck. He's a great, high value late game threat, but that's not what makes the deck work. 
---
There's gonna be a handful of games you might lose where a DK card could have bailed you out, but most of the time you'll be fine without him
---
More devs is not necessarily better. I'm pretty sure the team resisted growing intentionally.
---
"let's make it so odd paladin starts the game with a minion already in play for 0 mana"
---
???
---
no thank you
---
I didn't before I drew it
---
Too powerful for 1 mana.
---
Join askhs discord and watch asmodeus’ yt vids.
---
Actual chance is (1-((168/169)^2 * (23/24)^8))*100 ≈ 29.7%
---
This was the biggest issue I thought of as well. It would open up new deck archetypes that look to abuse a free body in the early game. The best solution I can think of is just giving the shrines low health so they can be dealt with easily, but there has to be a better answer out there. 
---
I wish we had heroic tavern brawl permanently. Would be awesome, but I'm sure people would just end up complaining about the reward structure and the format no matter what. 
---
Yeah, they'd probably nerf it from Charge to Rush before they ever HoF'd it.
---
No idea then, just watched the video, seems like your opponent could attack but not you. Weird.
---
turn 9? he probably got a bad hand ;)
---
It's too powerful. Destroys all hero power synergies for your oponent without any drawback for you. 
---
so you basically just win the game if you get this in your opening mulligan against baku/genn, but dont if you dont get it
---
this isnt a well designed card
---
Sauce?
---
I had a game at rank 3 standard the other week vs a midrange hunter. I was going second. T1 he played a springpaw i passed. T2 he played hyena. On T2 i played backstab backstab coin prep fan prep eviscerate edwin for a 16/16 edwin on 2. Thankfully he didnt have hunters mark and didnt draw it.
---
Why is it his responsibility to "give people a job"? 
---
Hey dude, I am genuinely curious, what is it that you like about HS that makes you justify spending money? 
---
Pulling one blood of the ancient one doesn't eliminate blood from being pulled number 2
---
The Darkness is Dormant, not actually in play. AOEs can't kill it while it's dormant, for example.
---
 EU quest trade Motri#21168, you go first
---
Oof, not a fan of this meta but at this point you could just delete the cards completely.
---
What in tarnation
---
Or maybe Hearthstone is just a casual game, they never intended it to be bigger than that and some of us didn't really realized it sooner.
---
People who want a casual game picked the right game, people who want to go further picked the wrong one.
---
I just beat it. It took a bit of luck, but what I remember is:
---
Animal companion was really good
---
Saurolisk is the best card, 8/8 troll second best.
---
IIRC I mostly went beast synergy, with rush and charge cards being rated highest among those.
---
You can still do a lot of other things with it - Taunt it up with Sunfury Protector/Argent Defender, use it as a sacrifice for cards (mainly Warlock) that destroy a minion for their effect. These are less snowbally though and I can see how taking advantage of that would be considered skillful play (and with the latter point - Odd Warlock viable when?), I'm just leery of any implementation of Genn/Baku which gives them some *additional* benefit even if their primary effect becomes less consistent.
---
Deck list? I've got a homebrew casino mage but could probably use another variation
---
I'd rather they invested that time into something else. Shame they haven't.
---
that disease gave you hearthstone, the computer youre using to play it, and why youre not standing in line for bread lol
---
F2P BTW
---
To summarize:
---
- Artifact was sold to the public as a "no free cards, and our cards are actually worth something and can be traded/sold on the Steam marketplace". Every digital card was actually worth something, unlike with HS, Shadowverse, and other CCGs.
---
- You needed to pay $20(?) to buy the initial game which gave you tickets for the various modes, and starter decks.
---
The controversy came in when not only did you have to initially pay for the game(no F2P in this game), but you also needed to pay to buy more packs(not unexpected). But in order to play in some of the competitive modes, you needed to spend tickets.
---
And once you're out of tickets that you got from the starter pack, you needed to buy more. The perception was that Valve was gating their content and indeed, your ability to even play some of the game's modes. How this differed from HS' Arena mode, was that at least with HS, you could still slowly gather income through playing the game for free, then pay the gold fee of 150 gold.
---
Artifact didn't offer this, because their model depended paying to play.
---
The initial marketplace resulted in a scenario where some cards were very pricy(not unexpected, despite Valve's assurances of safeguards against outright scalping). Then the market plummeted quickly.
---
The Steam charts showed a mass player exodus from Artifact, all within only the first few weeks of the game's debut.
---
&gt; Even indirect buffs like Sunfury Protector for the Genn shrine is a waste of a potential Taunt effect, considering it would lose any bonuses after reviving.
---
I wouldn't call it a waste, guaranteeing a Sunfury proc even on a subpar body is still great for consistency when putting 3 more health between an aggro deck and your face can make a lot of difference.
---
At this point tournament mode is used to refer to everything Blizzard doesn't do, new game modes, bug fix, actual game balance, etc.
---
I can't win with any of the warrior shrines. Armor shrine dies and leaves me useless, with dragons I get to boss 7 usually then die, due to lack of immediate removal/board inpact, the overkill card seems just bad to me.
---
Same with hero damage druid, which seems to me to be an extremely weak and delayed effect. 
---
I actually wasn't aware of that, but it's good to know as that makes it significantly less polarizing!
---
Long term? Wrong.
---
Hey, I am not arguing with you, was just giving the people a reminder of the person that did what you said would feel bad. 
---
I think you are right. I think it is impossible for someone to go to Blizz and get a good idea of what the new cards will/won't do. Regis and Lifecoach are great examples of the extremes, but in the end. Both could be just as wrong with their initial reactions. I love watching Regis, think he's a swell guy. I would probably be excited as well if I got to play with some new cards. But once the meta actually rolls out, that's when we can see if its a yay or bust.
---
But his fans knew he was going to the Blizzard summit. It would be pretty dumb to just not say anything about it. And he's not a "yes man" either. 
---
No golden portrait. 
---
Why would people be choosing 2 of the most expensive meta decks if dust scarcity was an issue?  There's a dozen equal or better decks for less dust than either of those.
---
Unplayable goldens are the best!! They become playable with the press of a button (well two to be exact - disenchant -&gt; craft) ;)
---
*plays yogg*
---
Yogg: no
---
at least he can disenchant them for a legendary each without second thoughts on if he should keep them
---
Hahaha! I had the same thing. 
---
I just played a round against the secret Hunter, that Freezing Trapped my Keleseth, and then I got Mistcaller out, so +9/+9. Was pretty nuts.
---
