It‚Äôs the shadow card from Valeera

&gt;Odd Warrior is probably the only other true "problem" odd/even deck at the moment IMHO mainly due to its polarization and as much as I actually enjoy playing it I think it could do with a nerf come rotation as it is losing nothing except Stonehill and Flurry.
---

---
Flurry is absolutely HUGE to lose for Odd Warrior.  I'm not even sure the deck will be good without it.
---
I'm totally with you though.  They should just nerf the Paladin/Warrior/Rogue hero powers and leave Baku and Genn as is.  Lesser-played Odd and Even decks are fun and interesting, and I honestly think Genn is pretty balanced (Plus, everything good about Even Warlock is going to rotate out next set anyway).
---
The strength not in the deck, the strength in you. 
---
Good job.  
---
one day may it rise to the top!

Heartharena isn't cheating, it ranks the cards relative to their power level and synergy with your current deck.  Top streamers use it because it's helpful to see possible synergies they might have missed.  9.5/10 times Kripp (best arena steamer) will pick the best card that heartharena would also pick- he's proven this with "blind drafts" with HA off.  It's a tool that can help, but absolutely won't win you games by itself; you still have to know how to play, bait out and test for possible answers, and react appropriately/conserve your own answers when possible.
---
Reminds me of this one Hunter player I saw once, his deck was *literally* nothing except 1 mana minions and he **NEVER** targeted minions, he only attacked face (and used hero power). He got me to 4 health eventually as well, was about to be salty for losing to a drone who just goes face endlessly without trading when it would be beneficial, but I skillfully topdecked a Healing Rain so I managed to win.
---
Ah, Dennis strikes again

New Medivh card!!

---
DID THE GUY ACTUALLY EAT HIS SHOE? THAT IS ALL I WANNA KNOW RIGHT NOW.
---
Does one keep the deck or start completely new?
---
Mind blast is only bad because of and in and shadow visions. Itself its n't bad
---
Oh, duh. Thanks 
---
this sounds like a bot
---
Basic knowledge
---
why would they choose pc when console card games have a better divisionalistic profile.
---
Agreed. These shitty fix seems to be popular with some people because they keep some decks in check... To me they feel exactly the same as if say Odd Paladin had to roll a D20 before the game, and if they get 1, they insta lose the game. Well good job, you took a few % out of Odd Paladin winrate, mission accomplished!
---
...No, because it's a fucking stupid system. 
---
Tech Cards printed to counter specific things are a horrible idea. All it does it denote that there is a problem, but they don't know how to fix it so they print out a lazy solution.
---
Tech Cards are great, but only when they're "generalist" tech cards imho; People are playing lots of aggro/burn? Swap a card off your deck for a taunt with lifesteal. They're running lots of big minions? Run a "hard kill" spell that kills a big minion for much cheaper than it cost them to play it, so you win on value.
---
But printing two cards, "Baku" and "Fuck your Baku" is a horrible game design.
---
Wow you are very smart
---
Thank you admirer
---
All I am saying is I likely understand the game better than you, made a valuable point, and your spewed off nonsense.

You would have won if you had used microbots to kill the 3/1s and gone face with Mecha'Thun. It looked like a pretty cool game though, you're opponent got some serious power picks from espionage.
---
Jan'alai off the weaponized pi√±ata synergy
---
Why must power decrease be large and ruining? It stops Prince Liam from working in odd Paladin. It allows Seaforium Bomber to halts even decks partly, thus making a boomsday card see play. It allows design space for Blizzard in the future so they can make more mechanics of deck shuffling and to have reason to add more of these shuffle cards.
---
Finally, I don't know what deck would run even quests. 
---
*Rogue would just run the quest without Genn or Baku
---
*Druid might be slightly advantaged, but there's no reason to have a 1 cost hero power (neither would druid be good again any time soon)
---
*Shaman kinda gains a bit, but not much. Besides, Shaman could use a boost
---
*Even warlock is about a big hand, not discarding your own cards (though it would be interesting to see Jek'lik shenanigans)
---
*Mage runs quest without Genn or Baku
---
*Priest wouldn't gain from a 1 cost hero power, would rather play wall priest
---
*Hunter literally doesn't work (lol)
---
*Warrior loses it's board clears in order to gain warpath (would rather just play normal quest warrior
---
*Even paladin works without the quest
---
Then after rotating sets, quests won't even be an issue for further design space.
---
yeh i played against a few that played cards instantly and ended the turn in seconds
---
Just chances. I've played a lot to get the card back and never encountered George and Karl; [click here](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Dungeon_Run) to see what other bosses you might have missed

I‚Äôve bought every pre sale since GVG, I‚Äôm bad with money so I‚Äôve bought every mini sale. I‚Äôm also bad at hearthstone so I usually play every flavor of the week/net deck. I STILL play wild jade Druid and C‚ÄôThun decks. As I‚Äôm obviously the worst I also dabble in Shuderwock. It‚Äôs too much fun being bad with good cards/a ton of dust. 
---
I am the one person who loves this weeks brawl. Dragon Warrior has never been so fun. Also love smashing people with BDSM pally, disolock, and OTK mage. When I lose I lose. When I win I‚Äôm a golden god and get to face fuck the opponent‚Äôs grandma. Imma call it even
---
Fo Shzl my Nzl.
---
I think maly would get reworked before he gets the hof. Having the legendary dragons all in it is kind of a staple for classic
---
Well it was better then Griftah or the 4 mana prince when I had 3+ 4 mana cards
---
Some support for old keyword mechanics would be nice. Inspire? 
---
Ok, so I'm gonna assume you're not that frequent of a hearthstone player considering you're playing a card from way back in karazhan like arcanosmith alongside shudderwock. A few quick tips:
---
%nbsp:
---
* Try not to run targeted battlecry minions with shudderwock, they can just as easily hurt/help you as they can your opponent.
---
* Similarly, try not to run too many battlecries that generate cards, since they'll end up clogging your hand
---
* DO try to run cards with nonsituational useful battlecries like lifedrinker, glacial shard, gluttonous ooze or doppelgangster, the last one also helps with my next point.
---
* Try to go infinite with shudderwock, so you can play 1 mana copies of him perpetually without running out of hand room. This is harder in standard, but since you're in wild it usually just means playing doppelgangster and zola in your deck, and making sure you've played both along with grumble before trying to combo off. So long as you get the doppelgangster battlecry to go off before either zola or grumble, it'll give you another shudder to go off with, ad infinium.
---
dude isnt half the fun picking ur deck? im not kripp.. neither are u, he started playing when HS came out.. i get why he finds joy in seeing How close he can get to the max winrate deck.. But if im not using it and im fking new to arena how fair is that ?
---
Tess is so cool üòç
---
How is it a safety hazard? It's perfectly within the rules so it's 100% legiitimate and needs no addressing, right? I mean that's the point we're arguing here
---
Price/prizes could be the same as arena, 150 gold to enter guaranteed a pack in winnings
---
I wish theyd update the buckets in dungeon run with new cards.  Thats all I really need to keep things fresh.
---

/unthread 
---
Like?
---
This will never happen, but I'd like to have them start rotating out only one expansion every time a new one comes out.  That way each expansion has a proper two years of existence in standard play.
---
So, in the upcoming example, when the new cards come out in April, only Un'Goro gets rotated out.  Then Frozen Throne in August, and K&amp;C in December.
---
You sir, win award for the worst comparisons ever. My congratulations...
---
Someone tell Genn that.
---
Need to have the extra wording 
---
‚ÄúAnd now with less cleavage!‚Äù

It has two attack for Master Oakheart.
---
Ok but what about the announcement of the announcement? Shouldn't we get that ahead of the 25th? Or did they fire the guy responsible for this.
---
He did, chat was also hilarious for sure
---
This looks like a relatively new players list of changes about stuff he either lost to, or feels like should be more powerful. All in all its pretty awful. 
---
This is why my deck is hemet jungle hunter, 4 discover a minion effects, and only 3 minions in the deck.
---
Master's call fixed their draw issues

Right but then you still have to pay 1 mana for a useless 1/1 :P

---
Ok, but Raza wasn't like that, it wasn't that strong for the majority of it's time before the patch.  
---
I think Patches was the only card that was meta warping for so long and nerfed just before rotation. It also wasn't nerfed into oblivion as they put it, but even disregarding that and focusing on any kind of nerf I think assuming anything based just on Patches is a farfetched.
---
It was a great Brawl I've ever played since the tavern open. I really love playing Rumble Run and hope these themes adopted to the Standard.
---
for your case lets say leeroy gets hofd. if u already have it u still make it golden. then u will get 3200 dust back for him golden and nothing for the regular one and ull get 1600 aditional dust for de-ing the golden one afterwards. since u need leeroy for wild u just leave the normal one at peace. u wont get any dust for him this way but the golden version is more valuable so u dont care about the normal one value wise. same goes for everything else. anything they announce u craft golden if u have enough dust.
---
If you craft golden leeroy and they hof him you'll get 3200 dust of refund and 1600 if you diesenchant the golden one if I understand correctly. So I guess yeah
---
If you have plain copies of cards that are rotating to hall of fame and plan on keeping them after rotation then it is in your best interest to craft golden copies after you open your last brawl pack before rotation
---
If you want to upgrade it TO golden, you can do so for free basically, dust the base and then craft the golden. You will get the 3200 dust you spent for the gold copy back, and the 400 you got from the original copy.
---
If you are aiming entirely for dust return however, and don't give a single fuck about golden copies, don't bother crafting it. You'll get the 1600 dust back and keep the basic copy.
---
Craft Leeroy golden, get 3,200 dust from the HoF, and disenchant the regular one. You will get the golden one for free and earn a little dust from the regular one. I crafted all of the HoF'd cards last rotation so I can play golden Coldlights, Ice Blocks, and Molten Giants in wild.

Why you lost 20 health tho? Wasn't it 10?

But it‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucked‚Äù kind of situation. It makes the hero powers level. Not only that but say you play seaforium bomber against an odd paladin and then he draws the bomb instantly the tech card does nothing. This way the essence of the card stays the same and it‚Äôs up to the player them self‚Äôs if they think that odd/even is oppressive

Nahh there have  already way better bots years ago. 
---
Some reached Legend and the most popular version ( a kind of Seagiant Shaman) was easily capable of getting to rank 5 . 
---
Those bots people face have to be implemented by Blizzard to prevent long que times. Because: 
---
A) A low skilled bot will always stay at specific ranks where the least amount of real players are. 
---
B) Other companies did the same recently ( In World of Tanks they also started filling games with bots because at low tier there aren‚Äôt enough players , only on NA so far.) 
---
C) It would be a strange coincidence if suddenly thousands of players decided to make a new account and call themselves X22whatever.. just to farm gold at an extremely low tempo. 
---
"Bots in the Wild" maybe?
---
Why would anyone skip Dex?
---
After the second week I must say I really really don't like Rastakhans Rumble Run. And in this brawl with absolutely no balance it feels like its to 60% irrelevant, how I play just which cards I draw. Getting the early synergy cards from RR are more a wincondition than anything else. This comes from someone whose favourite brawls include a lot of RNG.
---
If the opponent is able to play double Emeriss against a rogue and still be at 28 life, arena or not, something has definitely gone wrong. 
---
At the beginning of every year all members team 5 write their top 5 ideas for the game on little scraps of paper and throw it in a big hat.
---
Then Mike Donais ceremoniously lights the hat on fire and the whole team watches it burn down, reminded that team 5 is where vision and ambition go to die.
---
Don't punch like this. It's unhealthy. You might broke your wrist.
---
-Is Malygos having his place in the Hall of Fame? **No. A 9 mana +5 spell damage legendary card is fine, the problem is ways of getting him out cheaper or getting multiply copies. Let's stop making those cards.**
---
-Are more Classic Cards getting nerfed? **Really not sure what's left to nerf but that won't stop them from trying.**
---
-Is the guy who promised to eat a shoe last year gonna place a bet again? **It's time for him to eat his socks.**
---
-Are Genn and Baku getting changed or moved straight to Hall of Fame? **Changed. HoF does nothing except make wild perpetually a dead format of odd/even decks and big priest.**
---
-Is a previously HoF‚Äôed card coming back to standard? **Only one that could even theoretically be a consideration is Power Overwhelming due to K&amp;C rotating. But highly doubtful.**
---
-Is Lich King going to be reprinted as a classic legendary? **Given how absolutely integral he is to the KotFT theme and given the fact that has never happened before for any card, no.**
---
-Is Valeera getting a dress to cover her legs? **No, a smart pant suit.**
---
-Are they Hall of Faming and/or nerfing some inoffensive Shaman Card? **Ancestral Spirit is too good against Mecha'thun, so yes.**
---
Plus there wasn't the ability to quickly back-up decks with deck codes back then either.
---
I do really like this idea but itd never happen between it being confusing for some players or leading to too much text on the card.
---
Which is a shame, definetly one of the most interesting solutions ive heard 
---
&gt;Improve ranked gameplay. Dont allow me to face the same player twice. Counterqueuing feels horrible. Even in Wild at non legend ranks it happens all the time, even if its the same decks. It really feels bad to me at least. Just prevent that from happening, please. Also personally I dont see any motivation to play ranked to higher than rank 5. I've hit legend and got the cardback - there is no real reason for me to repeat that. I hit rank 5 just by doing quests after around 3-10 days. For the other \~25 days I only feel empty and not motivated to play ladder at all. (please dont tell me to enjoy the game just by playing it - blizzard would need to implement one or all of the points above first so I could enjoy it again).Get a better collection manager online. The current one is not bad at all. Dont get me wrong. but after 5 years the game basically looks the same as when it came out. Like an old car - it did its job and you genuinly like/d the car, but now its time to move on to something new and better. Let us drag/organice decks, let us store decks and deck codes ingame, show us the cards that get generated by other cards (Lich king/Ysera cards for example) In the collection manager.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I think I could go on for a bit but the message is clear. I need some general changes / overhaul to the base game in a way I outlined above to get me back. Otherwhise I will quit, I#ve managed to play and pay less hearthstone and for the first time in 4 years it feels  like I have the chance to get away without feeling bad. So again, I dont know if I want the announcement to be a blast or a catastrophy, lets see. =)

No. The standard pool is much smaller and it‚Äôs much easier to get a read on what they might have in their hand based on how they are playing.

---
Elemental mage with Shudder. Tech in Zihi and Nerubian Unraveller for combo and hex and beat combo and control. It's a good mid-range deck with shudder as finisher and hagatha as control
---
It wasn't Wild but there were special cards that could give you Hall of Fame cards.
---
I know right, I love it.
---
&gt;then you either played your cards well
---
You mean you drew them in time. Unless you think not wasting a psychic scream on a 1-1 is skillful play.
---
Control vs control is fun for both players. Its about spending resources wisely, eking out maximum value and and planning ahead.
---
Aggro vs control is fun, in that it has skillful play involved. You walk a fine line between applying enough pressure to kill them before you fall too far behind, but not over commiting into board clears. Against combo you don't even think about that, you just hit face mindlessly and hope they don't have the answer or you lose.
---
From controls point of view its also fun, because you have to conserve board removal without dipping too far in HP. There are meaningful decisions to be made.
---
Mid range vs control is fun. Its like aggro vs control, but you can take it slower. Force them into using their removal poorly and then dropping your real threats. Constant medium pressure whittling them down. Literally the bread and butter of midrange gameplay.
---
Against combo? Oh thats right, hit face and hope they they drew poorly.
---
I've got something like 5000 wins spread fairly widely across every class and archetype (except shaman) so its not even like I'm a control player who just hates combo because it counters control. Combo is just not to play against for any archetype, ever. A clearly defined win condition doesn't change that when the win condition is entirely dependant on RNG and absolutely no interesting gameplay.
---
It's hard to say that the rest is just a basic control deck, you have to remember that a lot of cards in the deck are pretty much dead until you get the combo, and the rest isn't a control deck, a lot of cards there are for draw/heal, from actual control cards you have Scream/Mass Hysteria, and Spirit Lash, possibly empowered by thalons.. Combo isn't hard, but being able to get there by saving up to 7 dead cards is pretty tough tbh.

Removing it at the platform level isn't shielding kids from it. It's saying that it's not acceptable.

Priest worked for me once with Battlecry + Sceptre + Dragons + C'thun, and once with Combo Caster and Dragon Soul.  The Dragon Soul run was a total stomp and one if my fave runs of all time.

LUL 55% win rate at 19. Should be legend in no time!

Yeah it's kinda frustrating when you see what people are hoping for out of a simple rotation announcement.  If they hit 2 of the above (or even 1.5) then I think that will be a very good announcement.  When we have a laundry list so long it is unsurprising that we are perpetually disappointed.  Blizzard games have always evolved slowly.
---
all 3 do actually
---
I will recommend Wild Odd Rogue.  It is fast.  I think you would consider it a douchebag deck, but it smashes the Bots.  It doesn‚Äôt always self-pilot because knowing when to swing your dagger and when to hold onto 1 mana minions in order to proc combos later in the game is key.  
---
The bots also do not prioritize hitting the 2/1 that buffs +1 attack to your Fiery War Dagger.
---
Well, I'd invest in a couple Savannah Highmanes and Master's calls. After those two, you can basically fill the deck with basic and common Hunter cards and neutral beasts and be pretty good for typical ladder play.
---
There are some good hunter decks for 600-900 dust, search 2019 poverty hunter 
---
Warrior worked for me with Sceptre and Dragons.  It also apparently works with Stealthed Pirate SMOrc.  Good luck!

You no take candle !!!
---
Awesome! I eat my words and downvotes. Thanks for doing the homework and writing this out.
---
I think I won about 40 games playing Disco Jeklik. It's broken as fuck but a ton of fun.
---
Just did with Raven. Thanks Raven!
---
Yes. The game client will have a grayed out entry for each card that you don‚Äôt have, that you can either choose to craft with dust or ‚Äúreplace‚Äù. It won‚Äôt automatically replace the cards you don‚Äôt have. 
---
&gt; you will be bored to death if u craft odd pally
---
Why do you say that? Genuinely curious! I think I like the playstyle...I'm on a 6 game win streak with a barebones Pally deck that tries to do a lot of the same things (flood board, buff, divine shield) but doesn't have the double hero power or Cauldron or Leeroy Jenkins or the 5 cost Legendary that turns your 1/1s into Legends
---
Its not very viable at high ranks and easiky countered, only reason it has a decent winrate because u can play 10 games in 20 minutes
---
Combo is just short for combination. Sure usually it's "combination of cards" but it can also be used as "combination of effects".
---
Here it's the combination of the "1mana 1/1-form"-effect from hypemon and the Faceless battlecry.
---
You could be nitpicky and restrict "combo" to "combination of cards" in the context of hearthstone, but given that "combo" is just short for "combination of something" in almost all videogames, I don't rly see the need for it.
---
Oh shit, I‚Äôve only played 10 games of this expansion...
---
Epic that does not fit T1/T2 decks &gt; you'll almost never see it.  
---
  
---
Until Blizzard changes up its business model, there's plenty of cards that will almost never be used. 
---
Similar yeah, but without the spellstones
---
respectfully disagree - there are several low cost summon guys spells, things like choose 1 - deal 2 or summon 2 1/1 etc
---
Needs more dragons.
---
No. I'm serious. Made me feel good. 
---
Saw a post just like this two weeks ago
---
Yep, thanks. I pulled that up the other night and I've been playing around with Miracle Rogue again too.
---
thank you
---
Thank you for a great reply. 
---
Quota thing is something that came to my mind. But if that's the case then situations like Maexxna seem really lazy and uncreative. Team5 is far from uncreative, that's what so confusing to me. Like i know electra was not yet designed when moorabi was released, but wouldnt it make more sense to put something like that if you are giving thrall non freeze skill?
---
While this is true, they did a silent patch about this and now runes will only ever deal 6. I dont remember where I saw this but it was a comment in this Reddit. I can confirm this as well as i recently did the lava chamber again and only got hit for 6 after a 2 health minion was damaged by the rooms hero power.
---
Not sure why you're down voted, this is spot on. Although some matchups don't require perfect play to be effective, which is why people think aggro is brainless, but the same is true for control.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. casual is ranked to some extent, if you perform poorly at the game you‚Äôll be lower on the list so you‚Äôre not auto qued into big priest in casual. So my theory is some players perform so poorly there at the bottom of the list and they can‚Äôt find anyone of the same skill level as they are to cue up against so a bots sent out to prevent long cue times. Ive experienced it sometimes myself and my friend who‚Äôs relatively new to the wild format experiences it all the time because he just started and couldn‚Äôt win a fight against the no life‚Äôs playing T1 decks in casual 
---
I think that's a good point. Lots of cards start out very different but get radically changed because they're game-breaking. Some of these are just not salvageable, but others eventually get enough synergy cards to become meta.
---
*casts Silence*
---
Also I think right choice is 4mana cost legendary hunter sho(I think), also zuljin
---
it would be an aggro card
---
Maexxna was ok at the time, because prior to that there werent any poisonous minions with a huge amount of health. So she was the first, and my guess as to why they made her legendary. 
---
No they won't. Savjz stream basically collapsed when he switched to Magic. Kripp lost 30-50% of his viewers when he would stream diablo/PoE or one of his sponsored trash mobile games.
---
HS is dead though. The devs have no idea what they are doing. It'll come back for 3-4 weeks once the new expansion drops and then the meta will be solved and toxic again and everyone will quit.
---
not everything in life a grand conspiracy
---
wispikahns wisple
---
You do realize kripp streamed games before hearthstone? No point in discussing things with people like you, you are clearly a hater. 
---
I dunno, rogue had [[One-Eyed Cheat]] and it was pretty bad.
---
I‚Äôm not sure a 2 mana 5/1 would see play.
---
There's some large holes you're missing in the design philosophy of HS. 
---
* Neutrals vs Class cards. Why they want class cards to be stronger (in general).
---
* Giving certain classes "time off" from being very powerful because they were a dominant class recently. Or being afraid to feed powerful cards into an existing archetype and making it stronger. So, they will print Legendary cards or synergistic class cards that aren't powerful (see: Freeze Shaman, see Hand Druid).
---
* Controlling costs. If you make every Legendary valuable, then the costs of HS shoots up dramatically. We saw a bit of that when they made the move to 18 class legendary every set. It's had a ripple effect on making decks more expensive across the board.
---
* In the end it goes back to traditional Trading Card Game mechanics. You want there to be a positive and negative experience when opening packs. You want there to be the disappointment of opening a Gruul or Millhouse Manastorm. So, when you open a Ragnaros or Sylvanas it feels even that more exciting. When you level out all the cards, those highs/lows go away.

2/4/1 Pirate | Whenever you summon a Pirate, gain Stealth.  
---
I agree, but IMO there are some ways to ‚Äòfix‚Äô Maly without just kicking him out of standard. Just change his effect to ‚ÄòThe first spell you cast each turn has Spell Damage +5‚Äô and maybe bump down his cost to compensate. That way the soul of the card*tm* is preserved while not allowing 40+ damage combos.
---
They updated the way you are given shrines to select from over a month ago. The shrine on the left will always be the shrine you used in your previous run. The shrine on the right will always be the shrine you just lost to (or defeated in a completed run). And the one in the middle is random.
---
Thanks for reading my report!      
---
Very soon we should get infos about the new expansion, what you all would like to see?     
---
Also i will release my own website soon, do you want to see anything special on it?       
---
Of cours you will see News, Standard Decks, Wild Decks and the weekly Report on the Website. But is there anything else you would like? Would really love your feedback! (Exp: I like what site xy.z does, the feature X is very cool")
---
Hearthstone is a Gacha game. there are bad 5 stars and good 5 stars.
---
for whales it does not matter but for f2p players getting that bright orange glow increases the hype then getting an actual good legendary is even more cathartic.
---
Is Duskfallen Aviana good at any Mana level?
---
Maybe zero or one where it's like Millhouse and its drawback is just a drawback and its purpose is to be an early beater.
---
Yet, they didn't announce the announcement of the announcement, so be patient üòâ
---
It's not like in the new run where you pick a shrine. The "rematch" (caused by the draw) against zentimo was with a different shrine. 
---
The patron warrior deck links to a druid deck.
---
And thank you again for these lists!
---
The combo you're thinking of is only when talking specifically about a deck and its goal/win condition 
---
Exactly. Not as universally broken as Baku, but still broke.
---
Lich King was super easy with just Murlocs. I really struggled with Mage and refused to craft the 4 Mana adapt your Murlocs. I somehow got by with just buffing the Lifesteal Murloc and healing off of that. 
---

I can tell you still lost though
---
Sad face
---
Fortunately not! I think he had lethal but couldn't do me so bad so he just conceded.
---
Keleseth probably, after that would be Genn and Baku. The problem is Kele is leaving with rotation and Genn and Baku are not......
---
Well. After having played it a bit longer I realized why I left. The decks are just to powerful. Anyone starting out or coming back after time off can‚Äôt compete. With that said I won‚Äôt be coming back. 
---
Although I like your ideas there‚Äôs no way blizzard will over implement them. We have been asking for these things for years and blizzard just does not care. 
---
Variance varies. 
---
True, I watch a lot of us as well and I do see control mage on ladder in legend, but never in tournaments. I am not legend btw lol
---
i did it with jade shurikens, ever growing minions and at times milling his deck(due felreaver) made it a breeze. and doesnt matter if he healed for 10 or so if i had 30 something or more attack worth of golems.
---
Ah yes, the unofficial announcement of the announcement of the announcement 
---
It's fun to look at all the cool cards you'll never get to play with and think about how some streamer will use them to break the game. 
---
Theyre using this business model because apparently it works best to grind the maximum cash without turning people away completely, which it did before
---
Thijs
---
Basically both Genn and Baku shift the games focus from cards to her powers and harken back to old Vanilla strategies most veteran players have seen before. Combine that with their relatively good strength creates stale decks that are high in the meta,  for long periods of time and are resistant to all but the most crippling nerfs.
---
Which meta priest deck runs MC?
---
Damn I was just about to comment this. Well played.
---
There's also the  3 mana neutral that creates 1 drops, it has the cutest effect sounds in-game
---
Jaina is an elegant design IMO, i just think it is grossly overtuned.  It should have said "your water elementals have lifesteal", so just the ones that the hero power makes get the value.
---
UI's design should factor in fatigue acceleration as a cost. Because you accelerate fatigue a serious amount.  It was the existence of the togwaggle/azalina combo and the mechathun combo that reward fatigue, which is supposed to be the risk of UI, IMO.
---
As for hunter draw, I think that subject nine is fine as a neutral draw.  As for master's call, I think that its a cool card, but it does push out other classes.  One of the costs of playing hunter is supposed to be having less card draw, and instead having more powerful midrange tools.
---
Yeah the shame concede, well done sir
---
No, is a terrible card, but in my opinion was printed to lower Druid power level, which it didn't, so the class got nuked a couple of expansions later
---
3 mana
---
Everyone net decks these days, you just happened to find the guy trying it out for the first time in ranked 
---
It would always trade down vs. mage hero power so I don't think any number would work.  The Mana cost is the problem.
---
Oh I meant the fact that BG is a 2 Mana 1/5 and has seen some play in mech decks and is at least a decent arena option. Amgam rager being 3 Mana is pretty bad. 
---
Yeah but as i said i do not care about packs, i just want to show that he deserves it. I would have picked him even if i hadn't given any packs. 
---
Truckasaurus!
---
Prep is shown cos he overdrew and burned it
---
Doesn't Thijs' variant only have Kobold, Dr D, &amp; Vanguard as deathrattles tho?
---
There are a handful of counters for everyone, but if you had to draw it by turn 2/3 or die....
---
Yeah, you can run mass hysteria and/or psychic scream to help but it weakens your summon.
---
Im surprised nobody here is mentioning [[shadowflame]]
---
The attack doesnt need to be much higher to be used for that. 7 attack is probably enough.
---
Still have Priest and Warrior to go, but have been stuck on Mage for a while now. Never have any luck building a balanced deck and everytime I build something powerful but potentially polarized - I seem to run into a boss that is the worst matchup for my deck - e.g. a spell-based deck going against the boss that spawns \[\[Tunnel Trogg\]\]s whenever you cast a spell.

[[Bronze Gatekeeper]] is 3 mana.
---
Cards like Magma Rager are why saying something "will see play" is such a vague descriptor for an individual card. A 3 mana 7/1 would definitely "see play", but the inclusion of it in certain decks would mean that classes which have a reliable ping would get more popular (Mage, Rogue, Druid, Hunter in this Standard year). And the proliferation of these classes would ensure that Magma Rager does next to nothing when played, no matter the attack value. 
---
This is how cards like the Rogue Quest were so metagame-warping without boasting a high winrate: you had to play around them or get lucky when queueing. The deck lost more than it won, at times, and yet the Rogue Quest "saw play". Psychic Scream didn't "see play" until Priest gained an actual win condition to follow it up, and yet I think we could all agree how powerful Psychic Scream is.

WHERE'S MY CAT?
---
Yes, just pointing out why people might have a harder time trying to re-enter the game after a break. There are ways of combatting this, HS knows last login and all your usage. Maybe look at card quality in matchups. Maybe doing play in games like in other competitive games like Rocket League and Overwatch. I know there is know MMR till you get to Legendary, but maybe thats a problem. 
---
Deathknight cards I think. 
---
What if..and this is just what if.. What if, say Blizzard is infusing some of the bots (not all) in order to test certain gaming behavior and use the results to predict how certain cards/decks are played, or simply check how much players are skilled on average..Yes, they can do this in closed testings, but that's pretty limited sample..  
---
The other, probably most likely 'what if' would be the already discussed possibility that bots help match-making time go down when there are fewer players.. and there's of course the mentioned theory (or truth idk) that some people are mining gold with bots, by completing quests.. so yeah, plenty possibilities.. 
---
&gt; 5/1 with Stealth, both at 2 mana, and neither of those saw play either.
---
The stealth saw a bit of play in water rogue.
---
No.
---
Duskfallen Aviana is pretty clearly one of those cards that could become incredibly good with the introduction of new mechanics on future cards. Remember what a joke Togwaggle was when it came out? Then we got Azalina, and it became tier 1 for a year. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs a good practice by the devs, but it‚Äôs happened a number of times now. Aviana clearly has a POWERFUL effect, just not one there‚Äôs been a way to consistently use beneficially so far. 
---
I would have to concede that it does need to exist at least as an archetype, the fatigue deck.
---
The next thing is, would I have to admit that even OTK has its place? I suppose, as much as I hate to say it, that maybe so, too.
---
Oof - I totally am. Thanks. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry bud but this ain‚Äôt it. 
---
Turns out when you let your game go to shit, people stop supporting it
---
Who knew?
---
LOL i get it, like the jaina art! That is just so relatable, fellow epic gamer!
---
Nicest
---
Only if its a seperate gamemmode. There used to be a "wild" arena but the issue was that there were just so many cards that it was literally impossible to balance them and have any sort of consistency. Having an arena with 4-7 expansions allows for easier characterization of cards to provide balanced buckets, as well as give players a good prediction at what others will be running to attempt to counter pick against it.
---
Concept is good, not the balancing though...
---
The essence of Hearthstone is RNG and RNG cards. That alone makes decks "simple-minded" and the reason for polarization. You can't make complex cards that rely on RNG, that just doesn't work. On the other hand, they can't make cards less RNG, because they'd have to let the opponent react to your cards, and at that point you might as well play MTG:A. Personally, I'm just doing dailies, waiting for the rotation and expansion, and playing MTG:A. If nothing groundbreaking happens, I'll just quit.
---
It's 10g/3 wins, no matter what class, no matter whether you're playing Standard or Wild. You must be remembering that wrong.
---
Not sure I like the example of The Glass Knight. A 4/3 divine shield for 4 is really damn good. You‚Äôre trading 2 health for a divine shield. Or giving Scarlet Crusader +1/+2 and taking it out of ping territory for 1 mana. Add in the regen effect and it‚Äôs way overpowered for a 4 mana minion. The reason it‚Äôs not seen as an overpowered/super meaningful card is because it has to be a 1 of, and it‚Äôs just an overpowered midrange minion. Make it a 2 of and you‚Äôd be able to count on any synergies with it being far more consistent. Even Paladin would be absurd being able to run it as a 2 of, they would‚Äôve been 2 core cards in every control/heal Paladin, etc. 
---
Yea but for that to happen on turn 7 is a god draw scenereo. MoshOggs can‚Äôt come out until turn 8. Witchwood Grizzlies are gimped until they get rezed via stone or servitude. There is a surprising amount of timing and minion management playing that deck. The splashy finish kind of covers up that there is some skill involved. 
---
Even Wild/Standard/Brawl wouldn't work. It's all the same counter. 
---
Like literally
---
Is it bad to teach a kid how to deal with inappropriate words?
---
Warrior was the hardest for me as well, scepter of summoning recruit or captured flag pirates worked out well for me.
---
Well I understand where they are coming from.  However, as you can tell from their daily asking threads most people want decklists.  Every person that comments about a deck that is working well gets asked for a list.  Some decks need a good write up (the old patron warrior or togwaggle azalina druid are prime examples of decks that really need a guide), but other decks like odd agro mage can just show me the list,  I‚Äôm already gonna know the core idea of that deck.  But what secrets is it running, is it running jaina  in case the game drags on for value?  I can see all that just from a decklist and make my own assumptions as to why cards are put in or excluded.  If I were the competitive sub I would definitely bend the rules for neon, he contributes and that should be encouraged.
---
Elemental Shudder, Dragon Shudder control, Even Shaman, Jade Shaman are high ranking decks currently.
---
5 &gt; 4?
---
It can't be 5 hours can it? I usually met the max on the weekends and I don't play that long
---
No... please. Not in increments of 5.
---
The problem with Duskboar was not "the attack is too low" is my point
---
In the absence of replies, I'm going to say yes
---
This may surprise you but they want you to spend money on the game.  Free to play is meant to be a slow painful grind, not a viable method of play.
---
Well we will be losing three sets in April so it won't be horribly outdated then right? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
FYI, Chameleos is from Witchwood and is not rotating until 14 months. It's a fun control card for Priest. 
---
play warframe
---
Confirmed. https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/280/wall-priest?hl=en#tab=matchups
---
I guess my matchups against Aggro just felt strong. I probably use the term aggro a little loosely since the game has favored fast play over the last couple years. 
---
This game is outdated. So many little things can be made to create better experience for everyone, but i guess fixing Jaina boobs is more important.
---
Uh it only kills the enemies board
---
Why is that bad when you can get the 5 so often instead of being a relatively rare occurrence that is arena.
---
50 would be better
---
I think people are forgetting priest exists. Topsy + Inner Fire.
---
Or any health boosting card. A 4-mana 5/3 with PWS wont see play, but a 8/3? Maybe
---
I get that, I spend quite a bit of money per expansion and still find myself having to choose only a few decks while disenchanting things I might like to try fun things with in order to craft meta relevant cards.
---
What I end up doing is using those fun cards for a while in the fluid new expansion meta before disenchanting to keep a few thousand dust and wait until I can identify what I will want to craft to make "real" decks.
---
As for hunter decks, I don't feel that nearly as much anymore. I find myself playing vs quite a ton of priests and rogues at the moment (more than hunter even) but it might have to do with ranks, server, hours at which I play or I'm just getting lucky/you're getting unlucky
---
I'd argue that for this they could. This isn't beggars, it's customers that blizzard should incentivise to continue playing. If Blizzard wants players to continue playing their games, they should give them reasons to do so.
---
1st of all it isn't that long. Witchwood was released April 12th so you are going to have to wait just a month most likely.
---
2nd of all, you are talking like you have nothing to play. You didn't say how new of a player you are but you can literally take a basic mage deck and just replace the bad cards in it with the legendary you got and other mage cards you get from packs. Put deathwing in too. Or take basic paladin and put in tirion and deathwing. A couple of these strong legendaries can easily get you wins up to rank 15 if you play well. So don't act like you have nothing you can play.
---
Well, a part from decklists, some deck guides from high legend players, or interviews, might be interesting! Also general news and info about the game. Some posts about game mechanics &amp; strategy would be really nice too.
---
Also relevant for Arena (yes I know that Karazhan proved conclusively that Blizzard doesn't care for Arena but in Naxxaramas' times we were still naive).
---
You are probably correct in your first part, but I am still not quite convinced on your second point.
---
It is litterally the most expensive ccg you can play. 
---
That's not the case. 7 wins is "infinite" where you win the buy in for your next run. 4 wins is [guaranteed profit](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Arena#Table). If you get to 4 wins, you get a card pack and at least 50 gold, plus either more gold, dust, or a card. You could have used your 150 gold to buy a pack and have 50 gold left over, or use your 150 gold to enter the arena, and if you get at least 4 wins, you end up with a pack and at least 50 gold. 
---
If you want to get a specific pack other than the current expansion, including saving up for the next one, then yeah arena doesn't necessarily help. But not being able to hit 7 wins doesn't mean you're losing gold.
---
What do you do with all your cards, dust, and gold that you pay yet can only play one class?
---
I honestly miss the adventures. Of course, they weren't as profitable for Blizzard because saving up 700 Gold for a wing is pretty doable, but I personally really enjoyed them. It was a nice feeling to have a complete collection of themed and (mostly) usable cards. 
---
Which got printed two years later and also problematic by itself. Wonder when will blizzard say they wont print weapon buffs for rogue because kingsbane.
---
Yes, it is.
---
And yes, I did the math. I even posted it, in other similar threads that come in every week. 
---
But if you think it's *not* easy, I would bet that you never did the math.
---
I don't really get the "Small indie company thing."  They aren't small anymore and haven't been since WC3/WoW/Diablo 2 era.  They have large ass servers, lots of resources, and have generated massive games with quality and polish levels that doesn't speak "small indie games."
---
And in this day and age, they generate even more revenue than before due to in-app purchases having hit the market.
---
Compare "small indie company" to "micro brewery."  A brewery loses the "micro" status once it's distribution, geographically and volume-wise, becomes too widespread.  E.g., people might still refer to Sierra Nevada beers as a "micro-brews" because they are fancier than bud light, but in reality, they aren't micro at all.
---
Since classic I have always thought it would be a fine 8/1. Call it a counter to mountain giant (better dodge the mortal coil)
---
All I‚Äôm seeing in this is you‚Äôre not guaranteed to play another arena run unless you hit 7 wins. Meaning if only had enough gold to do one run, I win 5 games I might be able to play again. That means I have to do the less efficient gold farm of 3 wins to get back to 150 to play again. If I don‚Äôt hit 7 wins, can‚Äôt play another arena. I‚Äôm not saying you lose 150 gold if you don‚Äôt hit 7 wins, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre guaranteed another run. If you don‚Äôt earn your money back, you‚Äôre losing money. 
---
y u here then? derp
---
Don't listen to this guy and fall in to the trap about not going infinite. Getting just 4 wins is guaranteed profit. If you can average that in arena and want the expansion pack being awarded, it makes more sense to play arena than just buy the pack straight up.
---
I mean, they can buff them, they won't, but they could in theory (but they won't)
---

Congrats! First time is always special

The mtg system is pretty good. Earn 3 packs in 5 days by drafting or build your win rate to earn 3 packs in 15 wins. So each week you get at least a good number of packs f2p

Screws over arena players tho (if its gold vs dust)
---
Someone honestly tell me why playing 3 games for 10 coins is bad. Why is win 3 for 10 ever been a thing?
---
&gt;so people don't feel obliged to grind all day for gold
---
You mean so they can't. They want you to play a little each day so you don't play a bunch, take a break, and forget about the game before next expansion. You are delusional if you think low gold gains are for your benifit. Events are ultimatly minor in your overall income. But they make you feel good, so they can give you 10g per 6 games with a smile on your face. 
---
I think i could do that. Own, original content or is showing what others did also fine?
---
And there are lots of situations where you need to kill totem golem on turn three, so u use prep evis on it and re-dagger (wow such tempo).
---
or your hand is prep-sap-coin and look who it is! another prep! even if you dont play miracle deck, this happens a lot! 
---
prep discounts the amount of mana but you need exactly the prep. 
---
they wouldnt print one mana wanted or two mana necrium vial without prep, so...
---
I just ran a hunter with Explosive Trap, it dealt with every deck in the game other than Mind Blast priest/Heroic Strike warrior
---
An interesting thing to consider is there are a wider variety of ways to grind progression of collection in Arena, so it encourages people to get better at the game if you want to grind in tournament style events. In addition to the ladder system basically identical to hearthstones, but with a few more packs for monthly rewards. 
---
Every legendary I can get on board with, except one. Duskfallen aviana. I looked through every legendary in wild and couldn't find any legendary as bad as this.
---
If it made minions only free for first one played, I could see a case being made for it. Then you could play it when you controlled the board and they would use normal mana to remove her with a spell, not free shit. But it makes any card free...there is no way to reliably get this effect before your opponent and I don't see how there will ever be.
---
Azalina was a card that was looked down on, but she was cool and eventually found a deck. She is a perfect niche legendary. However there is no case to be made for aviana Duskfallen. She will forever be terrible unless you can take your turn before opponent somehow reliably in druid.
---
If you think I'm wrong then make an argument for her. I can't think of any reason you would put her in any deck. Even a big druid deck or some way to otk, there are more reliable and better ways to achieve these things. 
---
Welcome to Arena!
---
Yup. But we say that regularly and I don't think the devs are listening. Or if they are, corporate won't let them change it
---
Two separate minions. [Fun deck that thjis tried a while back](https://youtu.be/ZrilIg_WHXA?t=166) that shows this interaction nicely.   
---
Mtga requires less then 6 games only 2 Being wins to get a pack each day
---
Grandma?
---
Or like 5 per win
---
It's an interesting deck, and i've given it a shot.  It's fun for the surprise factor, though it feels like a deck from a previous year in a sense.  Just a bit slower than fast decks, and not quite as much value as current decks.  Though that may in part be due to my bone drakes giving me little dragons quite often.  Hard to say since I haven't played nearly as many games.  It's fun, it just doesn't feel like it does anything that unfair enough to be a t1/2 kind of deck.
---
I addressed this in your other comment, but I think this is a non-issue or even an *advantage* for Hearthstone over Magic.
---
Thanks for linking these two, I hadn't read them before (but I'd seen the original). Now I'm trying to find an article about One with Nothing I remember reading a while back...
---
A 30/1 rager would be an auto include in any aggro deck. At some point, an X/1 for 3 would be playable. The question is just when 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt disenchant anything, since you never know if you might need it again later.
---
At least Hearthstone doesn't have this useless pile of shit

It's not assuming that at all, that's the entire point of "flip a coin and maybe win." If anything you seem to be assuming that your opponent is 100% guaranteed to have an answer which is obviously not always going to be true. Your opponent doesn't automatically win board control on turn 2 or draw a ping on turn 3.

If you only care about arena, you wouldn't have spent your gold on a pack anyway, and would be playing arena whether you average 2 or 10 wins. At that point going infinite is just about how sustainable playing your preferred game mode is and how much it needs to be supported by grinding out games in constructed. 
---
Perhaps you and the other guy are arena only players, and so we're coming at this from different perspectives. I enjoy both game modes, and see them as supporting each other. You can play arena regardless of what your collection looks likes, it gives you a break from the same decks you see on the ladder, and rewards you in part with packs and dust to expand your collection. You can then take that expanded collection and build the decks you want in constructed, where it can be easier to grind out gold from quests and every 3 wins, which you use to buy arena runs.
---
I don‚Äôt have any elixer tho, I have like 4
---
What if you are playing a control deck?
---
Sure if they like gambling on the chance there opponent won‚Äôt play any minions to trade it out, basically a 1/1 making it useless
---
Wait
---
Plus now each game lasts considerably longer than vanilla Hearthstone if you've got a good opponent.
---
Just FYI I‚Äôm u/octobroo
---
I know I have slowed my spending considerably over the years as it looks more futile now to try and keep up. They would actually get more money from me if they made it easier to keep up a collection. Losing adventures was huge.
---
So this kind of feedback isn‚Äôt useless to them. 
---
Now, when players get mad at Blizzard for being ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù, I can‚Äôt take that seriously because they are a for-profit company.
---
you can expand it beyond CCG's, it's the same with any startup.  They need to get a quick grab at users, and will run at a loss and burn through investor money in order to do so.  Moviepass has become my quintessential example for this (technically not a startup as it was around for awhile, but a new option to get users in).  Did everything everyone wanted, and completely crashed and burned cause they couldn't make money and ran out of investors dollars.
---
I would love to play hearthstone again, just too pricey, cant even make fun decks anymore. Havent opened it in over a year 
---
I think it does. What the game really needs is a new mill archetype, especially with Togwaggle rotating out. A solid mill deck would discourage the use of OTK combos and encourage more value play, which is where I think Hearthstone is at its best.
---
For what it's worth, I reconsidered my original comment; I think the key to a good control deck is establishing inevitability, in whatever form that takes. Control-combo decks or others with a big finish fill that role pretty well in the current meta. That may change if we see a new mill archetype, as it would become the new standard for control.
---
The very infrequent arena player in me wants them to make it 5 gold per win. 50% increase and I'm not stuck with an unusable 5 gold until I feel like playing arena again.
---
This is kinda exactly what I mean. It takes a very specific hypothetical new card to enable, yet hard to come up with actual specifics like card text, and in the end still like a three or four card combo to do something like Inkmaster Solia, which wasn't an incredibly strong card itself. I'd be pretty surprised if Duskfallen is ever playable.

4/4/5 | Battlecry: Discover two cards. Give one to your opponent at random.  
---
Divine Favor has seen play and it‚Äôs a dead card verse aggro. You are ‚Äúgambling‚Äù on your opponent being control. 
---
Keleseth sees play even though you are ‚Äúgambling‚Äù on drawing it early.
---
Not all decks are minion heavy. And even the ones that are might not be able to answer this card. Even worse if you‚Äôre playing Paladin and have righteous protector(s) up.
---
Well are we hypothetically speaking or not? It wouldn‚Äôt be a 30/1 realistically and they wouldnt have an answer 100% of the time but what about a top deck on this thing? When your opponent has a board? The thing is trash! One health minions are trash unless they are one drops or have rush/charge
