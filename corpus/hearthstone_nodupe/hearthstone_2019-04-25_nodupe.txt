---
  
---
Lmao sprint IS a bad card, that's literally the point - that prep allows it to be played in traditional rogue decks. Balance of sprint has nothing to do with anything. Prep just allows rogue to do what the class is intended to do.
---
What OS are you using that the screen looks like that?
---
I do that sometimes, so sure.
---
Lol yeah I‚Äôve lost a few games due to Netflix / computer screen distractions
---
There are only 8 classes anyway
---
Hmm any ideas?
---
 Isn't it just the new Legendaries they've released for mage hunter paladin druid? The villains are the new class legendaries Boom, Hagatha, Rafaam and Lazul.
---
So, Khadgar for Mage, Alleria for Hunter, Rhyssa for paladin, and whichever for Druid I assume Keeper.
---
I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. I think what you're saying is mostly correct, Dr Boom Mad Genius is not the value generator people are claiming it to be, not even close. The reason why it feels relatively unfair is because they can use their omega devastators to remove something, and instantly use the rush on them to trade with something else. The same problem pops up with dyn o matic. 
---
The only nerf that I could see happening without actively damaging flavor would be to only give the first mech you play each turn rush. That way it'll still have some battlecry (Lets be real, removing the battlecry from the card entirely would just feel bad.) but it limits the direct amount of tools they can use to control it. I know people are going to complain: "But that's not going to do enough!". Trust me, it'll probably have more impact than you consider and it forces them to consider how to deal with each threat more carefully. That and yeah, dynomatic nerfs.
---
Anyone know why Talanji summons in that order? It‚Äôs different to the order in hand...
---
All this salt and no pepper.
---
It's too late to Nerf Barnes. Vargoth and muerte have already pushed the deck over the edge. At this point all they can do is rework the graveyard as a whole or nuke servitude and resurrect from orbit.
---
UN-NERF YOGG
---
The faint imprint just behind the text that indicates which set the card is from. The Keeper on the left has the Classic swirl, the Gloom Stag has the Hall of Fame emblem, and the Keeper on the right has no stamp because it's uncollectible. It's also not supposed to have a rarity gem for the same reason (or perhaps it should have had a Classic stamp as well if it was meant to look authentic), but evidently that was overlooked.
---
When the meta plays you.
---
What does transformation popularity mean. Chance that it happens? How is one so much higher.
---
I said Big Bad Archmage would make this a great card, no one believed me.
---
Actually been lovin MTG area, just came back to hearthstone for the rotation + expansion and im already feeling like everythings so similar.
---
Magic has more variance in a mechanical sense 
---
Hearthstone of course has great presentation and ui design thats hard to top
---
Change your DNS settings to google public server and reboot your router. It‚Äôll fix it.
---
I think it's probably better to not wait for the initial hit, hitting immediately only loses 1 face damage but it comes out sooner and you're less likely to get wrecked by weapon removal
---
I agree with this tactic- 14 damage to the face in rapid succession is better than waiting a turn to gain 1 more damage. Patience is still required
---
Good for you, mate! Ladder anxiety kills the game for me... 
---
I've been playing for a long time and I mostly never played past 15, since a few months ago, that got a solution and went to 6. This last month my internet has been working horribly so I couldn't try to get to 5 for the first time.
---
My solution to anxiety was watching my gf play, not care about loosing and getting to 7... She just has fun. 
---
That helped me a lot, hope it helps you

---
I can't figure out the optimal way to get started though
---
Dr. Boom is the worst offender. To me its by far the most frustrating card to play against in the game. It was made to compete with old DKs, which are gone now. And it got an insane buff with all the extremly powerfull new mechs added. 90% of the decks you can come up with have like 5% chance to beat Dr. Boom on 7. You cant tech or adjust your deck to improve your odds. There are no cards that interact with Dr. Boom in any way or can compete with value/tempo it provides. If you want to beat Dr. Boom you have to build your entire deck for that matchup.  That card alone removes all other control-y decks and lot of combo decks (control warriors are basicly immune to finite dmg combos).  Even if you build some kind of insane value deck you can still only draw in most cases. With archivist and 15+ devastators/dynomatics with rush they can stall to draw fairly easily.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The card does simply too much and is absurdly cheap for its effect (you play it turn6/7, its not like Jaina for example at  9 mana, where you actually had to find a window to play it). Jam it on curve, turn your entire deck into removal cards and just keep pressing the button until it overwhelms your opponent). This will be the most effective (or ONLY like its now) control startegy in the game for an entire year. And because its a flashy signature card i doubt it will ever get changed, they will spend the next 3 expansions tinkering with shield slams, brawls etc while Dr. Boom warps the meta far more then any other card.
---
I really hate this card. 2nd most frustrating card in history of hearthstone for me (UI before the innervate nerfs is the only card i hated more).
---
Two was exact lethal here as well
---
Old force of nature+Savage roar made me feel dirty
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure HSreplay only shows data pools for a certain amount of plays. Not just a couple here and there.
---
If leeroy spawned 2 12/12 taunts instead of whelps id be happy
---
Both Battalion and Heroic were keywords that were only used for their specific set. Instead of reusing the keyword on the only card in their newest set, they spelled it out. Exactly how Blizzard is doing with Echo.
---
I did this with the coin on turn three and disgusted myself.
---
Rip Priest. Trying so hard to make a control priest work.  
---
Nomi Priest is still super good, just very very difficult to play so its winrate isn't all that high.
---
Raiding party and Boom mad genius definitely need to be toned down.
---
I'm not sure that Warrior needs a nerf.  As a fatigue class, Warrior is the best, no question there.  But I think every class has ways to end the game earlier.  If you force Warrior to have both Brawls in the early game, or both Executes, etc., then they usually won't have them.  It's only once they start chaining endless Omega Devastators that things spiral out of control.
---
For those who don't believe me, I'll list some Warrior counters:  Lucentbark, most Hunter decks beat CW, Twin Mage, Mech Pally, Res Priest, Pogo Rogue (or Togwaggle's Plan in general), and any Mecha'Thun deck.
---
Until turn 10, Warrior has trouble dealing with sequential large minions.  They can Execute one or two, but the third one will start demanding that they spend a lot of mana and cards to remove.  And across the whole game, Warrior has trouble dealing with more than two large boards (a la Res Priest, Zuljin, or Lucentbark).
---
What does need some kind of change, unquestionably, is Archivist Elysiana.  Extending the game by 20 extra turns gives Warrior that much more time to both leverage Boom's great hero powers, and smooth out the RNG of the random hero power every turn.  And it's a completely toxic play pattern, especially in the mirror.
---
the art could have been some goblins adding extra plating onto dr booms mech
---
I do it for the clicks!
---
This fight is totally not fair. Blame the terrible game designers.
---
also had two ice blocks, one already used, one in hand for backup. mage conceded
---
its pretty hard to get dead draws, you can get slow hands but non functional ones are super rare
---
Plus some mage decks arent running polymorph, and the big decks rn anyways are warrior, rogue and druid
---
Can never go wrong with Cairne, great card if theres space for him in a deck. Some deathrattle hunters run it with the whelps
---
Prep is an extremely fun card to play.  It's been in the game for years, and I suspect it's part of the reason some people enjoy playing Rogue.
---
There are arguments for or against nerfing it, but above all, it would feel bad to see it nerfed.  Emotionally speaking, I am very against a Prep nerf.
---
The equality nerf was so undeserved. But I‚Äôm december I‚Äôm sure we will see a card and go, ‚Äúoh, I can see why they nerfed equality.‚Äù
---
But to wait that long just sucks for the control Paladin archetype.
---
Give me one, it's my cake day
---
Current Murloc Shaman decks run 26 murlocs plus two copies of the 2 mana deathrattle spell. This deck only runs 6 murlocs. At this point, I would just cut all murlocs from the deck and shape it into a different archetype. I don‚Äôt think an underbelly angler package is worth running.
---
i use eureka and malygos as a second win condition.  no small minions like sotf.
---
It's not ranked but it was casual. The icon for friendly match is a pair of crossed swords. Although likely no one still cares haha.
---
Hagatha is basically an extra board clear against token druid/zoolock, and sometimes genrates you a few extra spells. Finding an extra hex or scheme or even a witch's brew late game can be game winning. But she is definitely not integral to the deck and there are plenty of lists without her. I'd recommend you try this deck out without her and then if you love it, craft her.
---
Turn 1 yeti gg.
---
Well the taunt was in the way, if he went face with his Soulfire he‚Äôd still have to use a minion to clear the Misha. And even then he would be at risk of discarding the other Soulfire. Which actually happened. Unless I am misunderstanding
---
Card does not need a nerf.
---
People not having some cards allows the game to stay fresh. If everyone has every card, you would not see crazy decks and experimental synergies on ladder, you would see just a lot more Tempo Rouge. If every one is either playing the top Tier 1 deck or its counter, then you literally have a game with two decks in it
---
I opened about the same, zero of these but 9 regular Druid epic stag, super weird.
---
River Crocolisk: the original early-game board control tool.
---
Day 2 craft. Never looking back, nothing feels better than being low health and ancestral spiriting a Walking Fountain for a board clear and +16 hp
---
I also think it'll be hit since in wild Raiding Part is insanely strong.
---
A card thats used in 1 deck isn't needing a nerf lol
---
Wild
---
Flark is worse than boom tho
---
DS kill only one minion, brawl kill all but one, it seems to me that brawl is stronger than DS, but DS is a pretty nasty card
---
^Did he delete you after like a bitch too?
---
I'm not a very good Hearthstone player but I like the card. I only have one copy in my deck but it's really useful to have sitting in your hand until you need it.
---
In a meta that doesn't have so much control warrior it might be okay, but...
---
bless mtg arena
---
I'm not comparing cards, I'm pointing out that nerfs happen to cards that are run in a single deck
---
Easiest combo in the game how could I forget
---
which is exactly what OP hasn‚Äôt done. KT all the way.
---
"Wow priest lowest WR class in the game again Wow..."
---
I actually run that! Sense demons pretty much always draws, since I run the portal demons, and broodmother has synergy with plot twist, which I run anyway. It's a surprisingly synergistic deck.

Alternative to the Doctor Boom nerf, change Omega Devastator by the simple expedient of removing its tribal tag. All at once, it can't be discovered through Delivery Drone or Omega Assembly and so a Warrior is limited to only 2 of them in their deck. It also doesn't gain rush anymore because of Boom's passive.
---
This opens up some room for other decks while still making the current Warrior good at keeping the Rogues in check.
---
As for Rogue, that is a tough one. Raiding Party at 4 mana would still be good draw, and maybe lower Waggle Pick to a 3 damage weapon.
---
I've been legend in the past and i'm rank 1 atm but the game feel like way more RNG than before , i've tons of fun playing it but this world championship is strange to look at.

Warrior has now a 10 mana spell and can run mostly mechs + mad genious, so a mech spitefull warrior would be horrible to see and probably too strong.
---
Priest still has mind control too, although no dragon package. And druid doesnt have UI anymore.
---
I loved, but never mastered, Aggro Shaman.

All time favorite is Dragon Warrior post Gadgetzan. It... countered Aggro Shaman really well.

Blade flurry -&gt; Nerfed from 2 mana AND deals damage to face because it was too strong, it was originally 2 mana, so I don't understand what you're trying to prove about over-costing, because it was literally critical in some HCT winning tournaments with its burst potential before it was nerfed. In fact it is in a few Tavern Brawl decks RIGHT NOW as we speak because they won.  
---
Sprint -&gt; Card draw has always been costed at (2xdraw-1) so 2x4-1=7 compared to all classic draw spells. ie Arcane intellect.
---
Assassinate -&gt; Cheapest unconditional kill card in the standard set, Demonbolt @ 8 needs 3 minions to breakeven.
---
Vanish -&gt; Unique mechanic that is used without prep way more than with, and costed fairly compared to other board control cards? Frost nova is 3 mana and only stalls for 1 turn only.
---
Turn 1: Swashburgler with Shadowstep and Southsea Captain in hand. Patches pulls from deck. Burgler gives Toggwaggle's scheme. Hit face with Patches and immediately Shadowstep patches.

&gt; If Blizzard printed a couple of mediocre Warrior mechs, the Dr. Boom problem would largely fix itself

not really because the rush from boom makes even mediocre mechs great

---
When talking about heroes you conveniently forgot to mention Jaraxxus which arguably has the best button in the game. The real discussion isn't about removing the "infinite" value heroes but it should be more about how do we introduce more of a cost for playing a hero. Currently there is no downside to playing any hero except Jaraxxus. Playing hero should be a calculated risk. How we achieve that I don't know but this is what we should be aiming for.

I don't think Dr. Boom is as much of an issue as people seem to think. Dr. Boom is certainly a powerful card, but it's very beatable. Khadgar Mage and mech hunter beat warrior pretty handily, and control shaman is a closer matchup but still very good for Shaman. The main reason these decks don't see as much play (and therefore don't keep the warriors in check) is that Rogue both dominates those decks and makes up a huge percentage of the ladder. If Rogue was a bit less dominant, those decks could see more play and knock warrior down a peg.
---
Also, to this point:
---
&gt;14 cards have been moved to the Hall of Fame, while 12 Basic and about 24 Classic cards have been changed. These changes fell, disproportionately, on the best and most commonly-played cards. If, despite all those changes, things still aren't feeling fresh to you, chances are good you're just burnt out.
---
First of all- of course those changes were on the most commonly played cards. That was the entire point. They're not going to nerf Angry Chicken just for the hell of it.
---
Secondly- Simply stating how many cards from classic/basic have been changed/rotated isn't a very good way to represent the degree to which those changes have impacted the metagame. That's not to say those changes haven't had an impact (they certainly have) but changing 36 out of 378 still means that over 90% of those cards remain untouched. The top Rogue deck that everyone is complaining about right now is comprised of 19-21 cards from the classic/basic sets. If 2/3rds of cards in a given deck have been in the game since its inception 5 years ago, I think it's fair to say that deck doesn't feel very "fresh".

---
The better question is why should hero cards be designed?
---
There is some degree of mmr in casual, so your a good player matched with equal opponents. 
---
The advantage of casual is you never have to play out bad match ups. you can leave.
---
Should play around that
---
Yes this play has a 1% chance for a pity concede.
---
many decks, and Ysera is almost allways viable!
---
Brilliant!
---
More than 10, less than 15. Unfortunately i don't remember the exact numbers.
---
At the time i also only remembered all the taunts i had in there, completely forgot about that card...
---
I think that is too much for becuase Odd paly is still a insane deck in wild. A better compromise is probably a suggestion I read, have equality 2 mana, and increase wild pyromancer to 3 since equality was never a problem card
---
Think you‚Äôre taking about synergy here, but that‚Äôs ok 
---
Synergy is present in just about every class, so class preference (I think) is more dependent on your favourite play style rather than just synergy. Therefore I‚Äôll assume you like playing the late game control decks (which are what mage and warrior are good at) 
---
Nevertheless let‚Äôs list down some of the outstanding cards for both mage and warrior (or at least those in standard rn) 
---
Mage: 
---
Witchwood: vex crow, book of specters, bonfire elemental 
---
Boomsday: cosmic anomaly, shooting star? (fringe card here), celestial emissary and luna 
---
Rastakhan: Daring fire eater, arcanosaur, pyromaniac, jan‚Äôalai (fringe card too, since odd mage is wild) 
---
Rise of shadows: Messenger raven, ray of frost? (deck dependent), magic dart frog, mana cyclone, kalecgos, khadgar 
---
So just looking at the number of cards rise of shadows seems to be your best bet (tho some cards like arcanosaur, bonfire elemental, cosmic anomaly and jan‚Äôalai work together in one deck, just like vex crow, khadgar and conjurer‚Äôs calling only work in tempo mage) Standout cards that work on their own include mana cyclone, dart frog and daring fire eater. 
---
Now for warrior: 
---
Witchwood: warpath, town crier, Darius Crowley
---
Boomsday: eternium rover, weapons project, omega assembly, security rover, dyn-o-matic, supercollider and dr boom (dk) 
---
Rastakhan: emberscale drake, smoulderthorn lancer
---
Rise of shadows: omega devastator 
---
Looking at the sheer number of cards in boomsday makes it an obvious choice (keep in mind these cards will stay in standard for less time than rise of shadows probably will). Also note that rastakhan cards are only good in dragon warrior, a fringe deck that seems to hv died as many of the good neutral dragons r gone. 
---
I would advice against crafting anything, but personally for mage rise of shadows seems like your best bet and the boomsday project the best bet for warrior. 
---
Also take note that I did not have time to go through the good neutral cards in each set (stuff like zilliax in boomsday) and you might wanna take a look at them too before deciding. 
---
Hope you found this helpful and good luck!
---
Control Warrior main since beta and honestly I‚Äôm thankful they changed the scheme.  Would I wish for a better one?  Absolutely.  But giving the current control warrior deck two more board clears would make it honestly more oppressive.
---

Ysera has been used a lot through out the years of Hearthstone since I started playing (2nd season of the first year after beta).
---
Right now I believe you could try Big Shaman, Dragon/Big Pally, Dragon Mage or Dragon Warrior.
---
0 mana spells created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without  requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles  between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and  compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or  interactive.

Thanks for the reply! It's kinda strange though since I watched for about 6 hours and didn't receive a pack, although my account is linked. Maybe they get delivered with a delay or they actually monitor how much is actually watched or just put in the background (which I did for a solid period of time).

Thank you for taking time to write this long answer, i will have to look at that yes, some terms (decknames i guess?) and names of cards are pretty confusing to me and will take time to learn. Thank you again :)

After Ragnaros rotated there was a small window for Gruul, if you wanted a fat 8 drop that would win the game if not dealt with immediately... quickly filled by the Lich King, as everyone crafted him immediately :(
---
All the legendaries mentioned here pale compared with Duskfallen Aviana, honestly think its the worst card of all time.
---
You could literally just run the Shaman deck recipe.  The last time I checked (about two weeks ago), it was the highest winrate Shaman deck at Legend per HSReplay.
---
Bug shammy is legit
---
I don't see your logic here in how Flark is a waste of dust, when we're looking at him being part of a successful deck. Even pre-rotation he wasn't bad, just not busted OP.

Can we just take a second to appreciate the attention to detail with this tavernbrawl, they could have just put a regular harvest golem into the deck
---
5 card combo that was blocked by taunt and only did 22 damage, we have had way worse stuff since.
---
Love that deck, best deck in the game.
---
I disagree with lucentbark just in that you can build an entire deck around that one card that is hovering around 50% WR. Any card that creates a entire new deck is pretty great.
---
Yeah, got it after 3 hours of "watching".
---
I left my iPad on all night, ended up getting 1 classic pack.  I only really watched the first match or so though.
---
This Tawern Brawl counts as priest for some reason
---
This isn't Hearthstone! This is a game where you play a card and it does 8!
---
Because it's easily teched, that's why it also doesn't see a lot of play at high ranks.
---
160p! Why didn‚Äôt I think about that.
---
I'm not talking about Togwaggle. I'm talking about Zarog's Crown. My dislike is about the high variance. You can discover a 3/3 (Tinkmaster Overspark, Edwin, Hir'eek) or you can discover a great one (Deathwing, Ysera, Tirion).
---
A deck with "Big" in its name.
---
I for one wholeheartedly agree with and reflect this sentiment. I always complain about how others bitch about things that they could try better to avoid, but point out how I like to make a hobby of complaining about absolutely everything. I don't know what's wrong with me.
---
It is insane and fun how the games go with this deck.

r/hearthstonecirclejerk is quickly becoming one of my favorite communities. They're just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at one click you drop them on the board and those chill ass motherfuckers gives you a meme to use later in life. And you also get this adorable little 1/1 can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the HCJ is just so positive. It comes on the board like "bolderfist oger" and I'm like "yeah HCJ bolderfist oger" and when they attacks they're like "FtP BTW" and I'm like "yeah I hate P2W SCUM." They don't say some bullshit macho shit like "I won't put any money into this game because of Blizzard's practices" they're just like "nah f2p." And they looks so happy. I mean this is a circlejerk subreddit literally brought to life by technology. They understands their life is a temporary bannable gift and these dudes are just fucking loving it. I mean look at they're millhouse they're just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when r/hearthstonecirclejerk is mentioned. IDK if they're gonna make it past the ban wave or not but for now they (or 4 Mana 7/7) are a pretty chill community

I am currently running Blackhowl Gunspire in my tempo-Bomb warrior, works well with double warpath, the 3/4 mech with 5 pings and mad bombers (good for token druids)....I hit legend with it. The number of times it wins me the game after they start thinknig they will out value me by adding more cards to their deck, then i just kill them with gunspire is funny to me.

---
Hi ho! I'll see what I can help with your situation. Been a player since Beta and while I'm not an elite player (best position on tournaments was 4th) I believe my veteran experience can help.
---
Wild has indeed an abundance of cards. While Standard offers a more controlled experience with lesser cards to play/craft its drawback is the card purge on every year. Solo adventures only offer packs on the launch of their respective expansion - for example, the Witchwood gave some limited quests where trying out the various Hunters awarded a few packs - in short, be always present at the launch of each expansion for freebies.
---
Solo Adventures from the Year of the Raven didn't give any packs because they were free from the start. Knights of the Frozen Throne is the only exception as of today because it signalled the departure from adventures over future free content - it gives packs of its expansion (now only usable in Wild) and a Hero skin. Rise of Shadows is going to add an adventure that does award packs yet it'll cost gold like the first adventures. It'll only give a single, unique legendary that seems to allow the player to use a random set from the suggested deck recipies when you create a deck, much like Whizbang the Wonderful (wiki link:[https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Whizbang\_the\_Wonderful](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Whizbang_the_Wonderful)), a legendary that every single HS website advises F2P/returning players to get, since it allows you to use refreshed, mostly viable decks on each expansion.
---
Legendaries are indeed powerful in this meta, but their power level are much lower than the last year's cards (glad you missed the Death Knights and Genn/Baku- those were A MUST to play decently in some classes). Some decks can be played without their main Legendary
---
**In conclusion**, I advise you, the returning player, to save your gold/money until there's more information about the Rise of Shadows adventure. If its prize legendary does allow you the free yet random use of recipie decks without spending dust (just the gold fee), then wait for the adventure and pay it in full. If not, prioritize on crafting Whizbang the Wonderful instead. Beast Hunter offers the cheapest deck that has a good level of power (weak against certain matches, however, but all decks have weaknesses) while Burgle Rogue offers the most varied experiences/styles. On a last note, Arena now offers a different experience with a mix of expansion (Naxx is in Arena!!!) where you might have some value in return if you can get constant 5 wins (check Kripparian on Youtube for his Arena experience).
---
Hope my insights help. And welcome back!
---
Do you have one of those?  How is their performance?  And do you like it or wanna throw it against the wall regularly? (Me with my S5)
---
Rogue deck runs 5 pirates, most of which all get mulligan'd away, with the exception of deckhand if off coin. Having pick with 2 corair on 4 means that you need to usually draw party, have a combo activator for it on 3 (aka you also need to draw backstab or prep), and then roll the 1/10 chance (2/5 x 1/4) to hit both corsairs. So yeah, it's really not that likely.
---
Kanecroc should have a Ebepb tag

Loving those sweet sweet packs I‚Äôm about to get.
---
Oh, no wonder that name seemed familiar! I‚Äôm pretty sure I matched up with him yesterday on casual, I think he was using Zoo warlock and I was playing bomb mech hunter.
---
Even without Elysiana, Control Shaman/Priest/Paladin/Whatever will not fare well against Control Warrior w/ Dr. Boom, Omega Assembly, etc. Resource for resource, Warrior will outmatch them. Even a control Shaman who could repeatedly heal up to 30 in fatigue will still lose in the long run to a warrior that can gain armor and maintain board control with the HP. 
---
Elysiana isn't the problem.
---
The politics and disruption MtG offers makes that game a much better place for multi-player shenanigans than Hearthstone. This is especially the case for Commander.
---
I expected traditional 40 dust but yesterday I got 3 commons, one rare and G9LDEN COMMON 
---
Probably highest amount of dust I got in last 2 months
---
I never said there weren‚Äôt upsides to adventures, it was the cost behind them.  For me it‚Äôs the difference between needing to pay 3500 gold for an entire adventure on a system where I was earning on average 20+whatever the quest for the day gave me a day, so average of 50 a day...so 70 days of playing to get the full adventure without being allowed to run an arena run once...or paying $30 or however much it was.  Compare that to $20 for 15 packs or 1500 gold.  The benefit was guaranteed relevant cards, and I‚Äôm not denying that.  But the cost/benefit was skewed.  You‚Äôd get 7 cards generally a wing of an old adventure.  3 dupes, and one legendary.  So that‚Äôs 7 total cards for 700 gold.  100 gold a card, verse 100 gold for 5 cards.  That‚Äôs why I considered adventures more pay to win than not.  Feel free to disagree if you so desire.
---
Well, yeah. But I haven't seen many people running it yet. I'm saying that people will start to run it eventually. Could be super swingy against any mech deck.
---
Samsung S10 if you can afford it. OnePlus 6/6T if you want something more affordable.
---
Those poor starving Chinese.*
---
It was a bug, but I was playing the deck yesterday and shudderwock activated that battlecry as well
---
Well, it does cast the Horror's battlecry. Maybe your Shudderwock was killed or transformed before it could get to the Horror's battlecry?
---
Taunt, divine shield, rush, life steal, Deathrattle: give your friendly murlocs +2 attack, Battlecry: Give your friendly murlocs +1 health

oh I always thought it was pain, considering her battlecry

Throw it by itself in a few different classes and see if the autocomplete algorithm gives you anything fun or playable (warrior or shaman, maybe?)

If you run into mech hunter a lot, you can probably tech out a Peacekeeper for ironbeak if you like your curve or spellbreaker for more presence against like zoo or conjurer mage.
---
Now this is what I call fun and interactive
---
maybe they are looking for a certain starting hand?
---
No that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. They‚Äôre both fantastic answers to giant creatures (unless they‚Äôre warriors and have the Beryllium guy)
---
I'm not a high tier player so I can't say. I was just hypothesizing lol. I did however see Kibler running a version of your deck that had pyro, equality, concentration, and shrink Ray at legend. Lots and lots of removal. https://youtu.be/dWQp7Rg7cyg Maybe you'll like it.
---
No its even before you see youre starting hand
---
Mimic pod inconditional at 2 is not fair (look elementary reaction). Its fair at 3. Its not like it would break the game but its correctly costed at 3, since it technically draws 2 cards too.
---
S9 fast and great. Throw it against the wall? I have a case on it and it has fallen on almost every surface and it's still intact with no scratching.
---
I would probably just grab a version or two behind the latest phones for samsung or apple. they all play it well and work solidly. still have an Iphone 6s myself and it works perfectly on it
---
My god, I can't tell you the number of time I've seen this especially on my pc. I've just resorted to play on my mobile phone enough though I like the tracker on my deck top better.
---
Um, no it isn't. Is it pushing through damage that will let you finish them meaningfully faster? Is it going to put them out of range of the most likely and/or devastating answers? Do you already have a must answer board? Those are absurdly easy questions to answer and the only things that matter. 
---
And also, because the deck is so powerful and resilient, it almost never actually matters if you chose right or not. That deck played horrendously and perfectly have virtually identical win rates. That's the mark of an easy deck.
---
Levels are complatly useless. Cards matter.
---
so how mad were they when they lost?
---
ok u/Adolfo_Hitlerro

Why TF don't class wins count???

not even bomb warrior, i like it!

Except for 3500 gold you got a lot of the key cards from a new set. Or the whole new set? I forget. 
---
Now 3500 gold gets you... what maybe 30% of a new set? If that? It‚Äôs all random. 
---
Basically they took away the guaranteed value from your gold. 
---
Not to mention the entertainment of actually playing the adventures.

i mean shit happens lol

it‚Äôs definitely pain.

hmmm maybe youre just lucky? lol go buy a lotto ticket
---
Its a reference to a post yesterday people,put down ur pitchforks.

no problem! although I bet that person was mad when they lost lol
---
As someone who's broken past rank 11 for the first time (currently sitting at rank 4), people like you give me hope.
---
Well, any reply moves a comment up, so that more people see it.
---
Bonus: wild pyromancer + lifesteal + bells is also fun
---
Definitely, it would be hard to do worse than the age of Baku/Genn, I just don't like the nature of this Mage deck
---
Sexy cosplay is really the first thing you think of when you see this? LOL.
---
[[Tunnel blaster]] gives it three damage AOE, which triggers lifesteal. [[Silver vanguard]] resummons the undertaker after it goes back to deck with [[Immortal prelate]]'s enchantment preservation.
---
The deck loses to aggro, combo beats control and tempo, aggro beats combo. Control beats aggro
---
Nice! Congrats man!

Thanks! Happy cake day as well
---
This happens to me but when I launch the app it says I have to download a 0kb update and it just stays there till the game opens up to a game lost due to disconnect screen
---
I like that you dont just let your mouth run but actually back up what you say. This was the discussion part i was looking for.
---
As for the "And why is letting players generally play what they want a bad thing?" then It's a bad thing because players don't generally play what they want. They don't look at their collection and think what can i make from this? What most players do is that they make the decks with the highest win rates, and directly copy them from the internet. You seem to know Hearthstone so you'll also know that the meta is formed after what other people play. And since 90% of people from rank 15 down play the same 6-7 decks it makes for a very square game where you simply can't compete without theese decks. Thereby it also becomes harder for newer players to enter since they need thoose exact decks to compete.
---
Sure the Legend Rank would look about as square as It does now but the whole mid-lane would be much more competitive and fun. My brother startet Hearthstone and one month later went for Legend with some steady playing and a &lt;50% win rate. Next expansion he is out of dust, and he can't reach a low rank with his deck so he stops. Where Im going with this example is, that if it had been the other way he wouldnt have started out with going for Legend. He would have reached a lower rank gradually and over time as his collection grew. Each rank would be an achievement instead of just the rush for Legend.

The dream is to have a low hand, Togg scheme decently high with a pogo and tak for 10 crystals. I've also shadowstepped my Pogo and held it till tak was on the board and had the scheme. This deck does well even without the pogo idea, so you'll win a few without getting it on the board. Or at least in my experience i have.

You can also use that 5 mana 6/6 that also deals damage to your minions and the lacky generating one, I also run dragon roar and pray to pull emeris for the memes (was close to doing it twice so far)

Bruh I only play for an hour a day, that too only a few weeks after a new expansion drops, then it's just getting on for 20 minutes to do daily goals. I came back to the game when boomsday dropped after taking a year long break, and I still got a decent collection and a bunch of viable decks I can play, depending on the mood
---

---
2/2/1 | Deathrattle: Draw a card.  
---
Yeah, I thought about that combo, but one part i did like more about this combo was how it kills off other minions you have on board making it easier to do the combo without having to kill your other minions first. Also the reason I have 2 circles and 2 rejuvenates is because you could do the combo with 1 circle and 2 rejuvenates instead, just meaning that 1 of your 4 spells can be used, or just to provide a safety against anti combo tech.
---
It might be because I've only played against bad players (only played it from rank 7 0 stars to rank 4 5 stars so far, not that many games). As I said, they don't really know how to play against the deck. 
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qgsLG4L.png) is the list I'm using, the guy who made it reached legend with it. 
---
I have a lot of draw and cheap cards that help me complete the quest, so probably sometimes they just don't have enough time to go nuts with killing their own board and resurrects. I've also managed to mill almost every Big Priest I've played, sometimes they even help me with LK and Vargoth/Shadow Visions/Mass Dispel. 
---
There is also a chance to discover 1 of the 3 polymorph cards from Magic Trick or Glyph. Killing their Barnes while freezing/ignoring everything else can ruin their resurrects a bit too. 
---
As you can see, the combo potential is quite big (4 giants, vargoth for an extra turn, echo of medivh), which lets me get through taunts. I can also use artificers, vargoth and their/the giants' copies from echo to eat some statue deathrattles. 
---
As for Yshaarj, it's often worse because they already have a wide board, since i'm not clearing them, or because of the milling.
---
I don't put too much a premium on watching events live. I prefer my highlight reels that summarize competitive in a few minutes rather than devote 3 hours to viewing the full event.
---
But that's just my personal preference. A lot of people more highly value the real-time experience.
---
It also depends what time zone you're in. Taiwan daytime isn't really great for many parts of the world.
---
yeah you're completely right! im even hesitant myself to send friend requests bc i know the other person might be dreading it. but the few good exchanges far outweigh the bad!
---
Maybe because you play hunter?
---
Exactly
---
Was used in a lot of Druid decks back in the day due to the effect and stats
---
i actually play rogue, i was just doing my daily. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è regardless, someones favorite class shouldn't be seen as an excuse to harrass them.
---
I agree, specially now that they have unlimited bird fillers , the moment you can‚Äôt answer the 6th or 7th bird fill the next turn is guaranteed double savage roar gg
---
It is a liberating feeling. I reached legend just to prove to myself I could do it (and also get the cardback). Now I know I can do it I play nothing but the decks I feel like playing even if it might effect my rank. I don't even grind for 5 anymore, life's too short, just gonna have fun with meme decks.
---
Big warrior doesnt run early game minions so it is worse than control warrior against decks like druid and hunter which can snowball in early game(buffing tokens/buffing a mech). The deck has similar or better winrates in most other matchups, notablely it wins warrior mirror and some builds beat mage.
---
As I said above, I play only an hour or so daily, been playing since boomsday (after a long break) and I never feel like I'm grinding for gold. Bought around 70 packs when ROS dropped, started saving up, already at 1500 gold after 2 weeks
---
me too, is it because i watch it on smart tv?
---
You can easily research that with [www.hearthpwn.com](https://www.hearthpwn.com)

"Take 15? Jesus christ, okay, surely you're dead*hold up okay what the fuck??*"
---
Streamer makes obvious misplays, loses the game
---
Quality clip.
---
I am also without a pack after 6 hours and having everything linked.
---
Yup. On top of that they usually have an event when they give out a bunch of gold like the Ragnaros event
---
I swear to god I have asked blizzard about this many times and filed many tickets and I'm almost certain that it is because of my reports (nah its probably a widespread issue as fuck which is why they did) but I saw they recently added a note that said that they not compensate for disconnections... Absolutely ridiculous I should have like 10 arena tickets at this point for all the trouble they caused.
---
I honestly think it could be nerfed to 5 mana and that change wouldn‚Äôt be too extreme
---
I‚Äôm facing this a lot :/ I play only on mobile and usually make the legend climb so I get enough disconnects of this exact nature to be aggravated by it as well
---
You must be talking about tj and admirable, by far the worst of the 3 groups. I would so prefer raven/sottle and kibbler/frodan cast every game alternating. Tj and admirable are god awful, not funny, stray off topic all the time, and actively makes me turn streams off since I groan so often at their banter.
---
Upvoted because of your mention of Blizzard butchering the Druid class. 
---
They had the audacity to print UI and Spreading Plague, breaking the class, only to end up nerfing NOT UI but Wild Growth and Nourish - relatively shortly before the KotFT rotation!!

And it should be noted that Nourish did not see real play until those cards were printed... not for the large majority of the game's life anyway. And yes they nerfed Spreading Plague as well but that doesn't change that they ruined the class as a control/ramp archetype. They didn't want to nerf UI because it's an Epic that was widely owned. 
---
What hurts even more is that any supporting cards to a control style deck you own for Druid are indirectly nerfed as well, nullifying the usefulness of part of your collection. I, for one, quite enjoyed playing ramp style Druid and am pretty upset about the nerfs
---
Ye i was just kidding. But sometimes hunter makes me tilt also :D not that bad tho xD
---
That's not entirely true. Every rank the chest gets slightly better but the difference is small (maybe 5 extra dust from rank 5 to rank 4 for example). You're right that 20/15/10/5 are the big jumps in value though.
---
No but if you disconnect long enough that the connection closes on the server side, the game counts it as a loss.
---
Mountain giant isn't the problem, you can remove a Mountain giant.  The problem is Blizz still believing that uncounterable cards that let you cheat out ridiculous value make for good game play instead of just being good meme and youtube fodder.
---
Happend to me. Bad start to arena if you ask me.
---
By definition, equality must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In this case, the effect is not symmetric, so you cannot say this is true equality, in the mathematical sense.
---

---
My advice for newbies is learn to play arena, do your daily quests, and don‚Äôt expect to ladder well anytime soon lol. And don‚Äôt disenchant a non-golden non-duplicate viable (or almost viable) card. Just because alexstrasza is out of the meta right now doesn‚Äôt mean she will be forever.
---
Hagatha the Witch is at its best in a control leaning midrange Shaman deck that can reliably play at least one minion a turn in the late game, turning all of their minions into two-for-ones in a strict card advantage sense while also greatly increasing the value of early game minions drawn late. Unfortunately, the rest of the deck isn't that great relative to its competition in Control Warrior.
---
It's a similar situation with how Frost Lich Jaina in a vacuum is one of the best Death Knight Hero cards, but rarely saw play in anything higher than a tier three deck.
---
Yea. :/ thought I had finally beat bomb warrior but to no avail. Haha
---
It's not that good u probably have a deck or two that it hard counters. Try aggro?
---
This is my biggest problem with the issue. The reconnect feature used to be great, but then they suddenly broke it with RoS. I've lost several ranked games due to this bug, because the game makes you lose your game before you can restart the app. At first I just thought people were playing really slowly due to the new meta.
---
I won as rogue and completed the hunter quest ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah I‚Äôm super on the fence about that video. What was the point of it?
---
You made a new friend! &lt;3
---
only briefly üòî i miss them already
---
I didn't realize there's so much hate for bomb warrior.
---
If you want to avoid seeing it play a hate deck
---
The nerve of a company to KNOW they have a mobile connection issue and add a little disclaimer about not compensating players for DC losses. I can not imagine giving so little of a fuck about your customer base that you are OK with this.
---
I guess it costs too much money to have someone whose whole job is to refund arenas for DC's. Most likely it would be a whole team needed and god forbid they just fix the damn problem. No its just so much easier to say "lol you lost to a disconnect? pfft read our patch notes, its not our problem. Now buy 35 more packs and you just might get the legendary you want"
---
This kills me.
---
I feel this so much
---
This does require 1 less card to combo off than the warrior mechathun' combo. But I have doubts that you could get this deck to work as priest doesn't have as many board clears as warrior at the moment.
---
Dude.... never dust legendarys ... if you only play Standard you can dust them when they rotate out....
---
Trust me. Its a pain in the a** when you need them one day
---
If I remember correctly, this week's tavern brawl was not supposed to be able to complete *any* class specific dailies. I don't think that was officially from Blizzard, but I remember reading it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bgwdja/this_weeks_tavern_brawl_is_hall_of_champions/)
---
The Dev team was rather proactive last expansion with changes to fix the meta.  I hope they maintain that and don't rest on their laurels again.  The gaming market is loaded with games as a service these days and none of them can afford to sit on their hands.  
---
Don't wait until the forum rage and the game gets dropped again by streamers to make changes.
---
Edit: forgot about the 2 galvanizers, it requires 1 more card in that case. I think 7 cards is a bit too ambitious
---
I played as freeze mage against a druid who had the DK and 33 armor by the time I played Alexstraza.
---
I had absolutely no way to gather enough burn damage to beat them but then suddenly they played UI with one card left in their deck and I was able to stall long enough for the fatigue to kill them.
---
F
---
I think Blizzard will gift us that option when more than 50% get the name of the class they want to ban right.
---
Counted towards my shaman/mage quest as firebat's zoolock.
---
Lightning Storm now overloads for 3 and does 1-3 damage to enemy minions
---
[[Azerite Elemental]]
---
hm thanks
---
Even so, he'll only have two cards in hand and you would've just won by pure tempo.  I honestly don't see anything wrong here.  I've done the exact same thing as rogue, then lost because execute is good yo.

5/2/7 Elemental | At the start of your turn, gain Spell Damage +2.

it kinda feels like a gentle middle finger from Blizzard to invested players.
---
Interesting I have yet to see one owl last one I‚Äôve seen Was from deathstalker rexxar
---
i've won 20 and still not got it lol
---
What do you think the best one is?
---
 Me too! Save it, it‚Äôs all yours my friend :)
---
Nice, good to know. Still bloody bizzare to see.
---
I dunno, if I had to guess Gonk's color combo it would probably be Red/Green.
---
What would the mana cost have to be to make that card good?
---
Nope.
---
Hey man, Blizzard here. We as a team want to know what really frustrates you. Whatever it is, rest assured we‚Äôre looking into it because it frustrates us too! By the way, Rise of Shadows came out and pack sales are down from from our previous launches. Throw us a bone?

We'll be your friends dude. GGWP on this loser's behalf.

I had the Hunter/Mage quest, and completed it when I won with Druid. I just went with it. /shrug

One thing to add, there were a considerable number of misplays yestemissplaysrday ( I‚Äôm not even considering in-game misplays, those I can‚Äôt evaluate at all against a pro , only I have lethal now/next turn misplays), so its safe to say that the players are really nervous and making way more mistakes that they should. Sometimes a play that seems bad was pure bad evaluates at the moment. For us at home, eating a sandwich and knowing both hands is easy to evaluate, nothing like having 250k in line for the next days.
---
No
---
just alt tab?
---
shield slam because classic
---
sorry mobile players
---
People really have mentioned that it is an overstated taunt minion on top of the other benefits. A 3/8 taunt for 4 mana is incredibly strong against aggro.
---
you can go 29-10 to rank 11 with budget decks while making your own changes to lists without a fundamental understanding of the game? today i learnt.
---
appreciate it man! i genuinely love this game so its always nice to see others so enjoy it/meet new people through it.
---
well you ain't wrong ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Shield Slam imo.  It's in classic so it will always be good.
---
And it's way better on turns 2-9.
---
What's the motivation for doing this? And yes, its definitely possible. I think if you search on HSreplay, there's probably a couple of decks which are very close to all class cards.
---
I'm pretty sure token druid is mostly class cards. And the old spell hunter was 100% class cards
---
They played heckelbot into a snipe, and since the bot pulled Maly from their deck the snipe hit for 9 instead of 4.
---
I wasn't aware \[\[Secret Keeper\]\] got nerfed.
---
You will get a guaranteed legendary out of the first 10 packs of each expansion so buy them 1 at a time from each expansion until you get that legendary. These are generally pretty useful to build a deck around unless you get something terrible like Duskfallen Aviana. Buy them 1 at a time so if you get that legendary before 10 packs you can move onto the next expansion. If you really don't want to build around a legendary you get, you can dust it for quite a bit of dust to use on another deck.
---
Can you revert it to double, just to benefit my spell damage rogue. Please and thanks

Excuse me?
---
This is legit my favourite voice line of the expansion.
---
This happened when I played a warlock deck with a rogue win quest
---
I feel like the the reddit circle jerk of big priest hate is always followed by the X deck beats big priest circle jerk and yet here we are six sets later still losing to the high roll deck
---
I swear when I play as aggro against it it still clears through me and vise versa I always win. Shaman might be the exception just because of devolve
---
OP might be trying to get quests done without 'wasting' a deck slot.
---
Yeah, but I think he meant shadow essence if you have no minions, not mindgames if your opponent has no minions. He just confused the cards, not effects, I think.
---
Disgusting
---
Nahh man, I love getting these messages. I love it when they basically tell you that you triggered the shit out of them and that they are honestly mad XD
---
If you have removal like Polymorph, it totally wrecks spell hunter since they only run like 3 or 4 minions for their combo.   Its also good against control warrior if you can hit their Elysiana so they cant avoid fatigue
---
Play warrior, cast Brawl.
---
Mech hunter can kill the Turn 3 giant with Venomizer magnetized to a Mech played last turn
---
Rogue can slow them down for a turn with Sap, but unfortunately they can play the giant again. It does buy you time to find an answer such as waggle pick + a combination of Southsea Deckhand and Deadly Poison. 
---
The mirror can make a similar play and force trades, or kill the t3 giant with a combination of scaleworm and another minion already there, as seen below.
---
The best way to "play around it" is to just play a higher winrate deck like Tempo Rogue or basically any Warrior, since this is quite a highroll scenario that depends on getting Book of Spectres, one specific legendary, and a giant in your first few cards. Book of Spectres also has to hit no spells, or this comes down a turn later.
---
If yall ever make that into a real card this better have a good pun like Scaled Nightmare
---
This. I hope it will make HS dev team to make more frequent balance changes in order to have more than 2 classes represented,which in would make more diversified meta on ladder.
---
Have you actually looked at the forum? They have this lovely message stickied:
---
&gt;Since this is due to disconnects, the only time that we need this  reported is when it ALWAYS happens from doing the EXACT SAME thing. If  it happens every single time you play Fireball, report it. That is a  bug.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;As a tip, if you run into this and realize it soon enough.  Immediately force close your game and restart. If you are fast enough,  there is a chance you can still reconnect to that game to finish it out üì∑
---
Thus solving the problem once and for all.
---
Wild snowchugger + missile launcher is also cool, pun intended
---
I think the two problem cards are The Forest's Aid and Soul of the Forest. These allow so much refilling of the board it's crazy.
---
I think wispering woods is a fine card, especially because it's inconsistent. In the few games I've tried playing token druid it has ranged from giving 4-7 minions, and 4/4 worth of stats for 4 mana isn't an absurd rate, especially when they're easily removed.
---
So I've wasted 800 dust on 2 nine lives and 400 on baleful banker. Neat.
---
I've mused about how easy it would be to make a bot that just played the highest winrate deck and made the highest winrate play.  Doubt it would ever be unsat from number 1.
---
Casting/Analyst stuff?
---
I wouldn't call Tak memey at all. Obviously it's not versatile, but the role it does fill is very important in decks that run him.
---
&gt;Would you rather have the card you want in your hand or a card that maybe will draw it?
---
the card that i want, which is not soul of the forest and already run as a 2-of. in most cases acornbearer, wispering woods, the forest's aid (i've lost games to not having drawn it by turn 8) or any damage buff that can give lethal.  
---
the only situation where a draw card is potentially in your hand instead of the card you want is if you keep it in the mulligan which is obviously not something i'm doing.
---
He's fine, he has Lazul's Scheme and Forbiden Word in hand
---
It's the start of a new season so that is a plus.  I think if or how you return should depend on what you want from the game.  My goal was to climb to 5 using my own deck.  I basically had a 1-2 year plan of mostly playing brawls and quests.  My plan was to develop my classic collection as much as possible and slowly craft the staple legendaries to make a few fun decks until I had enough cards to really mess around.    You can log in each day to re-roll quests but you don't necessarily have to play every day to maximize quest efficiency.  You can low-key play the game for the Year of the Dragon and easily save 10k+ gold and go in harder next year.
---
I did end up buying  a few bundles as my year of low-key grinding made me fall in love with deck building.  Now I sit on 5k+ dust and over 3k gold at any given time.  I didn't make my goal but I got to rank 6 5 stars 4 times with my Even Twig Giant Druid deck before I succumbed to the dark side and got there with Secret Paladin.
---
If you just care about rank, there will almost always be some budget decks you can grind for cheap.
---
If you really like a certain play-style or arch-type, they tend to last longer in Wild so that could be a good way to get in fairly cheap with a deck that can be viable for some time with minimal upgrades.
---
Instead of buying a pack of day play an arena run a day.  If you make it to 3-3 its essentially a wash instead of paying 100g and you are gaining experience and playing with new cards.  And as of recently, these wins count towards the coveted golden hero portraits.
---
f Psychic Scream
---
That's true. My main reason to play mage right now is to play with Kalecgos.
---
I mean, you were dead anyway.
---
‚ÄûYou are already *finished*‚Äú
---
A few things:
---
1) Control Warriors. Even when you learn to play around their removal, it takes luck to beat them. Every game I've won against one has been a close one.
---
2) Being off lethal by 1 damage and realizing you could've snuck in a dagger hit earlier.
---
3) Realizing that each loss is a net change of 2 stars, not just one.
---
4) The game where I let the rogue's Crystalsmith Kangor live assuming he'd just heal for 2. Double cold blood heals for 18, miss lethal, lose game.
---
It's the card that pushes the deck from almost to meta relevant.  But just relevant, not defining.  Break that and all you do is remove a deck from the meta, not improve it.
---
casting/analyst stuff...?
---
why are the stickied tournament pages never up to date?
---
I understand delays, but we are talking almost a full day behind every time.
---
I've tried to check for results here for the last 3 majors and it's always shit.
---
If you're going to go with yugioh, might as well throw in the whole DT lore as a card story. World legacy and dracoslayer are shorter, but also pretty solid
---
People are suggesting you craft Shield Slam because it's Classic, but I suggest you don't craft Shield Slam exactly because it's Classic.
---
Chances are, you'll eventually get one in a Tavern Brawl pack *anyway,* and at that point it will feel like you've wasted 300 dust.
---
The fact that missile launcher is magnetic makes it so fucking good. Otherwise it'd be walmart baron geddon
---
The pros all crunch numbers too, so it's not just stats vs. subjectivity or something.
---
3 spells + 4 minions = 7
---
'I'm a genius!'
---
'Oh no!'
---
Control Murdoch shaman. Amazing deck try it out!
---
Thank you
---
Oof. You have much to learn. Maybe start by watching some YouTube videos of game play... the only one that comes to mind is Trump Teachings.
---
Some feedback for your first 2 plays as rogue:
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have used the coin on turn 1 to equip a dagger and then attacked face.
---
Also, your turn 2 rogue play where you threw 2 deadly poisons on a dagger that only had 1 durability wasn‚Äôt a good play.
---
You need to think what your next turn will be and try to stay on curve (ie, use mana efficiently for either dealing with an immediate threat or building your board). This stuff is explained in those YT videos.
---
Can someone link a beginner guide for quests/easy achievements for OP? There‚Äôs a bunch of packs you can get to build up that card set.
---
Blizzard is giving out a total of 1500 classic packs randomly to Twitch viewers of the HCT World Championship. I'm assuming that you watched the Tournament yesterday on Twitch?
---
You made that choice instead of waiting. 
---
You want us to feel sorry for you?
---
Those that are patient often get rewarded. But just think, the card will remain in standard for 2 years. I am sure by that time some new disgusting deathrattle hunter will rise to power.
