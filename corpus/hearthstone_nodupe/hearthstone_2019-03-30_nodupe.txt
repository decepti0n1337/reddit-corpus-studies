If mechatun becomes meta, meta becomes anti mechatun. There are lots of cards now to counter mechatun decks.

Literally what every person says in this sub: oh my god this set sucks I‚Äôm quitting. Or: oh my god I‚Äôm so hyped for this new set!! Realistically it doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone thinks because no one will be satisfied with the work the dev team puts in. There will always be at least 1 person who dislikes it and 1 person who thinks it‚Äôs the best set released so far. I think it‚Äôs unfair to ‚Äúgrade‚Äù a set before all the cards have come out and without seeing how diverse and fun the meta is.

5/6 is premium, and 6 drops typically have shit stats anyway. i think the stat-line is perfect, the cost is high but sensibly so for balance's sake.

Thank you :) I'm going to try my best. Will definitely post here if I hit it.
---
ƒ∞f u talking about the one toast playin he uses naturealize
---
Things have become relatively balanced, of course certain classes are still better than others tho. There is a new "bucket" mechanic in drafting where instead of each pick being based of card rarity, cards are put in "buckets" based on card quality, and each pick has 3 cards from the same bucket. I recommend checking out r/arenahs if you want more info. :)
---
2 mana 6/6 All enemies minions cost 0.
---
lol you literally just proved my point
---
I'm ftp as well, and Arena is my main game mode. There have been a lot of changes in the last 2 years that have made it significantly more "fair" and more fun, IMO. 
---
Arena is no longer Wild. For the last 2 years (roughly) it has been Standard format. However, in just over a week, things are going to change yet again in this area. Arena is about to become a rotating limited set of particular sets from the past combined with classic and the latest expansion set.
---
There is now a "bucket system" for drafting. This ensures (usually) that every choice is between 3 cards that have a similar power level. There are caveats when Blizzard gets the power levels wrong, but this makes the drafting process overall much more meaningful and less of "pick the obvious more powerful card" every time.
---
They've also begun "micro adjusting" certain classes to attempt to ensure that every meta has classes as close to 50% as possible. Hopefully they will still be able to continue this trend with the new limited rotational system in place. There will still always be an obvious "leader" in regards to classes, given the particular cards and archetypes in the meta, but it is a lot more balanced than times in the past.
---
For more information, I recommend checking out the Lightforge Podcast. Or checking out arena centric subreddits such as /r/ArenaHS and /r/GrinningGoat.

&gt; you expect him to do anything else

---
this is insane with reckless experimenter. reckless+karen+cube+double this boi=infinite karen.
---
Current one loses the minstreal's tho.Thats a huge deal
---
The problem with big priest is the reasonably high probability that the game is just over by turn 5. That doesn‚Äôt feel like an interesting match - it‚Äôs literally just someone winning on rng.
---
But then again, at this point about 2/3reds of matches feel like rng decide the outcome as opposed to play.
---
So... mecha-Jaraxxus?
---
REFRIGERATOR SENPAI HOW COULD YOU?!
---
One day they‚Äôll make nice affordable AR glasses we can wear all the time and everything will be insane. Home furnishing, clothes, etc. everything will be plain and will be transformed through our glasses. 
---
Dont forget the recent trend treant art...
---
Wow did you finally make one? I'm proud of you.
---
Nah, they just printed them anyway and we have to deal with some of them since +20 years. Yay!
---
Well yes I think too hard to balance given the tempo based flow the game, we had enough time to test it and it doesn't work; The devs need to try with overkills that penalize the trades and not reward them, otherwise it only works with rush minions.
---
2 mana 
---
2 HP
---
2 ATK
---
Inspire: your spells costs (1) less This turn.
---
Armour does not. If your HP hits 0, you die. All them idiot Druids found that out with Ultimate Infestation.
---
Also hero power Paladin and the new Paladin holy wrath combo with banker
---
The one I'm interested in is kill minion -&gt; attack face -&gt; attack again?

Hearthstone takes place in the Warcraft universe, same as WoW. All of the characters and cards are meant to be from the Warcraft universe, but not all of them are from any of the other games. A lot of the cards from Hearthstone are unique characters created just for the card game. Some characters that first appeared in Hearthstone have later gone on to show up in WoW. Sir Finley Mrrgglton, and I believe the whole League of Explorers, is one example. Tortollans are an example of an entire race that first appeared in Hearthstone and then later made it into WoW.
---
Gravelsnout Project is my favorite Boomsday card.
---
Which one ?

Big pali

Well done making the image fit the magazine. 10/10 effort.

Thekal gets you above 30 HP without too much hassle.

Is that her actual name? seems like a jarring use of spanish 
---
I swear I‚Äôm gonna do it!
---
Right, but there is practically no reason to run gallery without rez mechanics. Yes there are some weird otk things with mind blasts, but those rotated with radiants. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cloning priest got to be an interesting and weird deck for a few months before rotation. If they never printed another rez effect for its lifetime in standard, then that entire legendary card is pointless. It exists for no reason other than as a memento of a former T1 deck. This way, there is still a deck you can build (cloning gallery, expect everything to die, then play this catrina/mass revive, both of which are viable as long as big minion strategies are viable. This could easily be the last rez effects for a while - just strong enough to make gallery not a pointless card. 
---
This is actually kind of nice for wind too.
---
I was trying to remember were the card text was. 
---
Another in the proud tradition of hunter legendaries becoming   not-legendarys!
---
Yes, no.
---
I like how your casual enough with the Land Before Time scene to use it as an acronym.
---
Yes, but how did you not know that if you commented here, of all places?

I‚Äôve been thinking about this combo for a bit 
---
I think it would be better with Maly shuffle maly next turn jepetto maly maly prep evis prep evis easy game
---
And now the comfy cushions!!
---
It was perfectly balanced, as all expansions should be. (Except forwuest rogue. Fuck that guy)
---
Playing a game of hearthstone at an MTG event does sound rather ironic.

Thank you!

What was the second card in your hand? It looks like a pit fiend to me XD
---
My girl, [[Mojomaster Zihi]]. I'm playing Jade Shaman, Reno Priest, Reno Mage and in all of those decks she's delivered. Even if your opponent is not playing combo, sending them to 6 mana while you're ahead is game-changing. For example, I forced Amara out of their hand (the reward for Priest Quest) without the ability to copy it with Zola/Seance multiple times.
---
There is no point in theory crafting anything until all the cards are revealed

Expansion name "Mogor's Palace". Mogor has opened an ogre casino, unfortunately he doesn't really understand how odds work so he just says everything has 50% chance to win.
---
Why can't i get a discussion on my thread? I posted 2 days ago. It really do be like that
---
I'm gonna miss Un'Goro, probably my favorite expansion. Quests, elemental tribal, adapt, whole lot of cool stuff.
---
[Flobbidinous Floop] could factor in
---
Yeah, 8 is pretty much the sweet spot.
---
FYI to add on, Mishra's Workshop (card that creates 3 mana only usable on 1 card type)+Trinisphere (card that makes all cards that cost &gt;3 mana cost 3) is another way to consistently soft-lock the opponent, while hindering yourself a bit, as early as turn 1 on the play in the most powerful format. 2 card combos like this are much more possible and consistent than the theoretical turn 0 win, so it isn't as powerful as it sounds since the combos will always be only as powerful as the interaction to stop it (which can be very powerful in these formats).

You‚Äôre gonna love this expansion meta then. There‚Äôs at least 3 cards made to disrupt combo decks like those that cheat Maly.

HEY EVERYONE

GET IN HERE!
---
Is this correct?
---
It‚Äôs almost too easy
---
Inner fire priest existed before shadow visions. It can exist after. 
---
We have found a new way to win the game with Yogg:
---
Time Out -&gt; Embrace the Shadow -&gt; Tree of Life
---
Full circle. 
---
I am stunned you consider spending over 100 ‚Ç¨ on this game almost free to play.
---
I am not surprised doing all the quests and disenchanting Wild cards are enough to build some meta decks for Standard. It would be awful if it wouldn‚Äôt.
---
As a player who has really not spent a single ‚Ç¨ on this game and rarely plays it I can‚Äôt do that. However, I don‚Äôt play Standard anyways and therefore still have all my Wild cards, so that contributes to me playing all sort of stuff but not real meta decks most of the time.
---
I play mostly arena anyways, and that has left me with 5 k dust and gold right now since I never buy packs and don‚Äôt craft cards often.
---
When a new expansion releases I usually open around 20 packs in a few days if I come to play the game. So you getting only 50 more despite playing almost every day is what really surprises me.
---
I see a T1 handbuff paladin coming.
---
HAHAHA BREAK NICE 
---
Just by doing your daily quests (and maximize them by rerolling) and winning games while doing your quests , you should get about 8000 gold. That's 80 packs, and you'd get about 10 more for free. You'd barely have to play the game to get that much resource. That is not insubstantial whatsoever. You can easily be competitive with that many packs. You can't make all the meme decks, but that's what whales pay money for.
---
I started playing since the release of Un'Goro, spent about $65 then, haven't spent a dime since. I'd have basically a full usable standard collection (from the next expansion), and another 30k spare dust. That's with me not dusting any Wild cards. The key is: invest in your collection, don't invest in decks. I must have gained no less than 30k dust from nerfed/HoFed cards since I started playing. With Blizzard clearly making balance changes more frequent (2 major patches + huge HoF set just in the last expansion), the rich will become richer.
---
What about Hagatha, Lazul, and Togwaggle?

took me like 4 minutes to figure out you were talking about prostitution lmao

---
Basic rules for each card in question:
---
1. If **max playable copies are golden**, do nothing.
---
2. If you are **missing a playable copy**, craft golden of the [highest rarity](https://i.imgur.com/6Q8RXR4.jpg) you can.
---
3. If you **only have a non-golden playable copy**, decide...
---
	* If you want to upgrade to a golden copy, craft golden.
---
	* If you want the most dust, do nothing, except for COMMON cards, always craft golden.
---
Similarly, let's say tempo mage continues to exist. They have a Counterspell in play, and a Counterspell in hand. Does it discard? Same idea for a Subject 9 style deck, if there are 5 secrets up and some remaining secret in hand, does the boardspace limit the cast the same as minion summoning rules?
---
I will never not enjoy being otk‚Äôd by mind blast priest. Rest In Peace radiant elemental.
---
Now this is pretty cool!
---
Lich King hands down. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve faced that guy and he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúLet me just f you in the b with the exact situational card my homeboy needs to come back with and win. Officially scarred. But then I guess he IS a villain...
---
Aviana is a shit Johnny card though. Yogg is a Johnny card, Aviana is just giving your opponent free tempo. She's an embarrassment to the original. 
---
Fuck the complaining of wild players. They know that they'll never get balanced decks.
---
He's not even close to the most viewed streamer.  I presume he was picked because he has a good history as a caster and his personality lends itself to this kind of stream.   Yeah, I'd say that's an honor, lol.
---
Wow this is.. good.. this expansion seems really good and like a new direction design wise
---
Chillhouse Manastorm:
---
2 Mana 4/4 - **Battlecry:** Freeze this minion.
---
You kidding? I'm glad he's off that sinking ship called Blizzard.
---
Hell yeah, coin kalegos into pyrobl- *wait*
---
Hell freaking no.
---
So like that Hunter worm thing but only 3 attack
---
F
---
Would she resurrect herself?
---
Well the first thing you do is take Archmage out of your deck!
---
Does this expansion only have 8 drops? Jesus.
---
Hey look it's Giant Sand Worm, or whatever that 8 Mana 8/8 Hunter beast was called.
---
Great combo with my second favorite card, GEICO Insurance
---
‚õèÔ∏è How long can this go on ‚õèÔ∏è
---
I imagine the highest res picture would be on the artist‚Äôs artstation page
---
Low. Effort. Trash.
---
Of course, I forgot that it was our fault that Blizzard chose to implement Rezz in an incredibly high-rolly way rather than numerous alternatives that were equally flavourful and less likely to make me fucking kill myself.
---
Looking at this picture Brian "please don't call me Brian 'Brian Kibler' Kibler" Kibler met you.
---
You disconnected, close the app (and relaunch it). Game is already over.
---
*breathes heavily in Akali*
---
She and Lynessa were quite the team.  Got my 1000th Paladin win tonight with that deck.  Going to miss Quest Paladin.
---
Idk why but started recently (there are a couple of posts about it) when you get DC'd, there is a chance that you stay in the game but your opponent doesn't do anything and the timer never runs out. Only thing you can do now is to leave the game and come back.
---
I mean you would ptobably not want to ressurect a 4/1 right?
---
Right in the feels
---
If you‚Äôre genuinely interested I get a decent win rate with Reno fatigue mage, and that tends to play out interestingly. I am pretty fucking tired of facing big priest though.
---
Everything's coming up Millhouse
---
Quality shit post right here. Well done!
---
Amazing
---
Have any proof of that? Genuinely curious, guy seems alright.

Akali is better unless you have good deathrattles  
---
Don‚Äôt worry, everyone will run them for a couple days and then use actually good cards. I‚Äôm sure some of them will pop up from time to time, but that‚Äôs like when Kobolds came out, and everyone thought the weapons would be useless because of weapon removal. Nope. The good ones did just fine regardless. 
---
I liked toast until he took the mask off and blew up.imo during that transition to being a much bigger streamer i personally don‚Äôt really like where his personality went. I‚Äôm happy for him, and he should keep doing what he‚Äôs doing because it‚Äôs clearly working for him, but his trolly persona really puts me off so i don‚Äôt watch him anymore.
---
I've reached legend using a control mech paladin with prelates 2 seasons ago, and every month since 2014 I've been playing all sorts of variants of control paladin and yeah control paladin doesn't have single target removal and that as always being like that, paladin have access to shrink Ray and Pyro+equality is still pretty strong, doomsayer is also an option in currently using, so surviving is not an issue at the moment, but it may be when rotation happens, is hard to know, the only thing I know is that this card is solid, doesn't require a condition and you can play it even in non-dragon decks, plus we still have to see the rest of the cards and what other dragon sinergies are available for paladin. 
---
Then don‚Äôt watch it
---
Batterhead still needs to get a kill to keep going, so it's a essentially a 9 mana combo that clears some to most of an aggressive board and does considerably less against slower decks. It's powerful, but it just might be too expensive   
---
 (and inconsistent) to be practical as a combo clear. 
---
An interesting addition to this combo would be inner rage, as it greatly increases the consistency of killing enemy minions and costs no health loss due to the immunity. Granted this does cost an additional card for the combo clear. 
---
that juicy healing though.....satisfying to the last drop
---
Would have been a flavourful The Grand Tournament card.
---
Soon we're gonna have secret full art cards √† la [pokemon](https://www.google.com/search?q=pokemon+full+art+cards&amp;oq=pokemon+full+art+cards&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4015j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).

Hmm, maly+Alex for 2, arcane shot (7)+ arcane shot (7) +kill command/hero power/any on board damage.
---
I mean I doubt it'll be *good* but maly decks are always fun...
---
But think of the Shadowy Figure synergy. Now you can have twice as many murlocs!
---
Planet Earth
---
Hot take: the card pictured has absolutely nothing to do with Millhouse.
---
I would most prefer if they went back to the original Millhouse which added the Megablast to your hand, but either way I hope he involves some sort of super flashy 10 mana play, regardless of whether it's good or not.
---
inb4 it has nothing to do with millhouse and everyone is disappointed, FeelsBadMan

&gt;you kidding? I‚Äôm glad...
---
&gt;...he‚Äôs off that sinking ship
---
They got us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I think getting it to about 5 attack makes it playable.
---
Until boomsday when rogue got the tools to cheat out Maly, combo decks around him were really scarse. Sure there was druid but they had better decks at that time. Before then I hadn't really heard of how good he was. Sure I knew he existed and was a threat but I think boomsday is when it started to get out of hand.
---
I was pretty clearly referring to the dust which i mentioned in the first question.... i even called it FREE golden baku? How did you miss that? Why did u explain the baku was free. If i called it free. Lol. 
---
Probably because u can stand that, if u make a mistake you want to correct them and get better in it, because thats why you lose in LoL. Sometimes rng is why u lose in HS which feels very bad, although theres always a wqy to improve in HS aswell, can be really frustrating. 
---
Just saying that it's "Rule iit's Ashes" lol

Millhand Manastorm - 4 Mana, 2/2 - Your spells cost (0) next turn. Discard your hand.
---
There was a goal here??
---
Thats what I love to see
---
Genuinely confused which do you mean. Shiro's smile or Kibler's Shiro. 
---
5 attack would make it insane.  I think it is good enough to be playable in the right meta/situation.  Of course there are better cards (Walking Fountain) but I think it's good enough.  Even against Token Druid, this would kill 6 Treants, that's pretty much an AoE.  And if they run that slow Twinspell card, this will clear the first one and live.
---
5 attack would just get insane value.
---
Golden Whiz is the best. I was reallyyyyy happy to have him as the golden legendary with my Boomsday bundle pre-order.
---
I currently have 1450 dust. I can DE a few rotating cards and probably craft a golden baku. But that is about it. 
---
If the new legendary gives us more decks Im gonna craft it golden since I didnt preorder so I dont think Im gonna get it golden
---
This is my first proper rotation. I joined during Frozen Throne so I didn‚Äôt care when Old Gods, Karazan, and Gadgetzan went through but this is leaving me quite sad
---
Don't be scared, my name is free karma.

I came back after like 2 years and went from rank 20 to rank 8 in 4 days. Is that okay? I don't really have the best cards, but I do have a zoo warlock deck 
---
Shit card. Will see play.
---
I love sacrifice token warloc, i am happy :)
---
Agreed.
---
Another Great support for New mage elemental.
---
Carnivorous cube, dk rexxar, baku
---
Oh, that's not Akazamzarak. Such a disappointment.
---
Well that`s a lot of RNG though
---
This will be played.
---
And the paldin's card Duel! Is an anti combo card too
---
Very good with Mana Cyclone
---
Another support for an upcoming Miracle Mage.
---
Miracle mage might actually be a thing!
---
So far, the best art in the expansion, can't wait to see it golden.
---
Got the cost and stat line right at least... 
---
I feel you, especially after MILLHOUSE MANASTORM hype which was a disappointment 
---
If only it was a mech

---
So many baits this expansion. First Milhouse and now this 
---
2 oozes 1 infinite weapon with lifesteal
---
&gt; Overall, I'd say it's a great card against Rogue
---
Rogue main here, I just know this is *always* going to hit sprint when I'm already at 9 cards.
---
Happy cake day
---
I had an actual WTF moment as I misread it as "discover a spell, it costs (3) less." Thank god its not that.
---
Actually pretty decent anyway, though.
---
Awesome art, 10/10 
---
legend - I climbed to wild legend 3 with it this month, faced many mirror matches along the way. If you look at any wild meta tier list, they all have kingsbane aggro at tier 1. I promise that if you spend a decent amount of time at a high rank you will see lots of it.
---
5-1 tends not to have as much kingsbane because it loses like 85% of the time to odd paladin, which is a very popular deck for climbing.
---
No sympathy for the misplay.  Warpath was right there and would've stopped the bullshit.  Would've accomplished a lot more than +2 armor.
---
Tempo mage !
---
what a cheap trick
---
With grim rally it might have some potential, for 5 mana +3/+3 to 2 minions and a +1 to all the other ones.   
---
Like with 3 minions out it's a 2 card 5 mana 7/7 with charge, i have seen worse.

Decent replacement for glyph in tempo Mage. More fuel for Luna and Cyclone. You can also consistently find something to play right away with this on earlier turns. I like it!

We don't have exact dates. "One month after the expansion" is the best we've got.

More support for the Vex Crow mage I'm theorycrafting...
---
it is akazamzarak, but not in minion form
---
Old Money
---
I mean wild is mostly standard lite bc of how hard team 5 powercreeps
---
Not that it's an excuse, but I feel like that's because those are the kind of decks that f2p players inevitably play at first due to their consistency. Whereas aggro is inherently gimped without Leeroy and one or two class legendaries, never mind all the crap that a combo deck needs.
---
Case and point, I've been playing what would probably be described as budget aggro Rogue (no Leeroy, no Edwin, no Vilespine, had Keleseth though, maybe that was the problem). There was nothing I could do turn 9 against a priest who drew Cloning Gallery and his Mindblasts but neither of his elementals nor Malygos nor Vellen. 
---
Any deck that isn't odd warrior or a maaaybe druid would have lost to that. The fact that those or just "win before turn 8/9" (which isn't entirely consistent, even against combo, is it?) are the only options is kind of dumb.
---
Then again, I hated Frost Lich Jaina ever since I saw her and she steamrolls budget players too. I still salivate every time I beat those cheap odd mage players with my wideboard aggro.  I've never seen any hate directed towards her on this subreddit though so maybe you're onto something.
---
Bit vulnerable to board clear. 
---
or you can do 3 damage + clear his 2/3 for free
---
if you think 6 damage is better at this stage of the game, then you simply aren't very good
---
it was probably a bonus but not the main reason
---
he's the most annoying fucking goblin in wow
---
The Golden is at least 14/10.
---
No
---
Your photoshopping skills are impressive, you must be very proud.
---
If you have a board +3 +3 to all minions for a 2 card, 5 mana combo is pretty good. If you have 6 minions down that could just win the game. 
---
What‚Äôs the name of the new whiz bang like card? I can‚Äôt seem to find it anywhere 
---
Wish granted.
---
Uh, I had forgotten about [[vex crow]]. I am not that sure a board of random 2 drops would be worth it, though. The raven itself is a 4 mana 3/3. Hunter spellstones were everywhere at 5 mana, but kinda disappeared at 6, and that's around the point where you can play the crow and a bunch of spells at the same turn.
---
Using antonidas for fireballs... could work, kinda? But then we are looking at turn 8+ plays, on what strongly looks like a tempo/aggro deck.
---
At the very least, a skeleton of the archetype is there. It is very much possible the next reveals for mage will change my mind, or the next expansion if not this one. But for now, I am not convinced.
---
isn't it a bit too slow for zoo? Maybe with grim rally it could be good.
---
I think the point is simply that she had amazing stats for 4 mana (5/6 and stealth) and the effect is a drawback. If you think about it, she would work against a control deck that had very few minions, because she is hard to remove and has lots of stats.
---
I think everyone would be singing a different tune if mana wyrm were still 1 mana. If that were true and they printed another spell synergy card along the lines of flamewaker, I could see tempo mage becoming a real terror in the night.

4/3/3 Beast | Whenever you cast a spell, summon a random 2-Cost minion.

Its a spanish/mexican name? Since when mexicans are pirate mate?

That's all hideously worded and would never appear on a card. 
---
Funglemancer part 2 : the electric boogaloo
---
Munnah is the correct way
---
Gnomes were my main reason to play Horde in World of Warcraft.
---
You monster
---
Think of it like Divine Favor : you play aggro/value minions until your hand runs out then you refill it using the new card    
---
Or you play mostly spells and use it for value
---
Mebbe I'm repeatedly unlucky with draws then. But getting a deathstalker, and two 9 cost legendaries in the board for 3 mana just pissed me off
---
If they cared they would have redone the client. As it is right now you can't add too much new stuff without spending an enormous amount of resources.
---
So as just releasing cards and releasing (not so difficult to implement) singleplayer content is the most cost effective way to do things they have been doing this for basically 5 years.
---
Then you just gotta accept your deck doesn't beat everything and will have downsides, like... every deck.

Primitive

This will never see play in anything ever.
---
Literally 2 mana hero power in the screenshot. Kobold Librarian and Stonehill on the sidebar. I've never been this confused. I mean I have imagined Wall Priests playing the game drooling over the keyboard before
---
Gonna be played? The only way I see this being played is if in early turns you can get enough sticky stuff (Harvest Golem or egg type cards) for you to have \*somewhat of a chance\* to get 2 minions on board
---
No Batterhino in the chatterino
---
Heh i thought of this too xD
---
Boooo!
---
Oh, there's quite a few of those decks already. But beast synergies are few and far between. Wouldn't hurt just to get one more.
---
/r/BadHSCombos 
---
Not a lackey, an underling. Have to be careful with those words now. 
---
Star Druid was nerfed because it was too strong compared to other decks, and balance is needed in every format. Pirate Warrior still exists, the problem with Patches was that, with charge, would have become an autoinclude in all aggro decks, thus limiting deckbuilding.
---
8 damage if they pull it with akali though, and 10 if they also happen to have the axe thing to buff it again.
---
Are they actually the same? Summon a minion should trigger battlecry where put a minion into play should not. Was that clarified already?
---
The +2/+2 from this card only goes on two minions, not all of them.
---
Not [[Acidic Swamp Ooze]]
---
Is this ***seriously*** where they're taking the class? Seriously? Tokens and treants? What about those awful combo enablers from, I dunno, last 3 expansions? 4 mana to draw a beast from your deck? 6 mana to summon one? 4 mana to draw 7+ mana cost minions?
---
Don't worry guys, I'm sure summoning a bunch of fucking 2/2's will make the class viable.

2/3/2 | Battlecry: Destroy your opponent's weapon.  
---
If they are playing deathstalker rexxar and two 9 cost legendaries, they have played academic espionage and drawn at the very least 3 cards. If they prepped espionage turn 1, they just spent 2 cards from their hand doing nothing, and whenever they draw a random hunter card they are not drawing the cutlass, a weapon buff, or any card draw.
---
Keep them on their toes. During the early game theres really not much they can do, so SMOrc them as hard as possible with your minions.  Academic espionage luck will not matter if they are dead.
---
Even now that we're all complaining about Big P, is not because it's the best deck in the format. 
---
It's nothing like that though, it's only "charge" if you actually have a way to kill this off with other minions on board that can attack, which is not always going to be the case.
---
Requirement seems more steep than Fungalmancer, and historically, cards that buff your other minions on death haven't really seen play in Zoo decks, so I don't really see why this would.
---
This is discover, right? So it's not from your deck? So it's basically omega assembly that slow decks can't use and token decks will have no use for, because its 3 random druid minions and most of them don't fit the token playstyle. 
---
This will not see any play. 
---
Excuse you, I play gnome because I don't like any of wow's character models and gnomes are relatively inoffensive.  ~~Well I was considering making a void elf until they turned out to be rep locked~~

The Hunter playing Leaper on the following turn would‚Äôve made this clip perfect.

I was watching the reveal for the new 2 mana epic Druid spell. This minion was added to his hand. 
---
Very rarely play wild, and even then I'm using standard cards, so guess that answers the question :) thank you.
---
I think you misunderstood.
---
To be clear this new card is conditional 0 mana deal 4 damage to a minion.
---
And it's value is more/less equal to 0 mana  eviscarate (with prepation)
---
1 card vs 2 cards
---
Totally worth a post. Good call. High quality content right here.
---
I see what you did there!
---
Aren't they beasts?
---
Yeah, but it's in warlock. Meaning Zoo. Meaning literally none of that matters because either they're going to have that activator or they're going to have the board state to support this on 4. If this were in like... shaman, I'd 100% agree with you. But this is the sort sacrifice support warlock has (granted losing devilsaur egg hurts) I can't help but imagine this being nuts. I've been wrong before, but it seems like it's gonna be core in zoo.
---
It wasn't the best deck in the meta but it was still pretty good and fun with the riven idles and arcane giants.
---
That‚Äôs the thing about new combos they take some time to get discovered. Obvious synergies is what people will point out but more will arise later. Like Zola plus Jan‚Äôalai
---
WELCOME BACK! &lt;3 
---
Un'goro was a great set. It had a very defined style, was strong but not too strong and it had a lot of fresh ideas.
---
Just please don't reveal Hunter cards last and let them be strongest like last time
---
What do you mean by that? 
---
Rogue has plenty of burgle cards.
---
I've never played WoW but in DnD the Cleric has several ways to control weak enemies.
---
This is like a drunk Fungalmancer
---
There's a new card that gives you 3 druid minions is you have no minions in your hand. This puts minions in your hand. That's why it conflicts. 
---
Fine then, read this article, it might be useful.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma
---
why doesnt heckle use the recruit keyword
---
ODD PALADIN IS FUN TO PLAY WITH
---
Nah... maybe in some meme decks but definitely not in a competitive decks.
---
There's no reason for it to be ironic. 
---
Or I'm actually a proper prophet! 
---
Which is the explanation I favor at the moment. 
---
That‚Äôs cropping not proportions.
---
But... Are you safe now??
---
Because the card wasn't even that amazing when it came out. Rexxar has become LOTS better after all the rush , poisonous and lifesteal beasts which were added to its pool, making it way better at actually surviving instead of just dropping big beasts without much immediate impact.
---
You forgot Shudderwock. I know that card got hated into oblivion, but Shudder is my favorite combo-enabler, combo-creator, combo-etc that takes AEONS to set-up, and even then doesn't kill you right away.
---
I know right. So glad i got to see it. 
---
Yes, but containing more value doesn't necessarily make the card better. It depends on the mana, stats, and how fast the effect is. Imagine if instead of a 1 mana 1/1, the minion you describe cost 4. It'd still be infinite value, technically. And this would get even worse if instead of a battelcry its effect was on deathrattle, like this new druid card.
---
Hearthstone has an infinitely repeating card called Astral Tiger that nobody plays, and that's a 4 mana 3/5.
---
Or this is one of those callback cards to the wing blast / scorch mechanic.
---
Argus and Dark Iron Dwarf are still a thing and much proactive

A free 1/1 that can be played whenever you want? That's pretty strong. 
---
Milleficient Manastorm was a boss that would occasionally pop up in a dungeon that takes place in Dalaran‚Äôs jail. Millhouse mana storm sends you in there on a quest to make sure you destroy the great evils that lurk inside.
---
The Burning Legion (Jaraxxus‚Äô army that he‚Äôs a part of) breaks into the jail and starts releasing prisoners at random. If you‚Äôre lucky he‚Äôll release Millhouse‚Äôs wife who will start a boss battle with the players. 
---
Near the end of the fight Millhouse wanders in and asks if you‚Äôve killed the terrible evil things inside. (Namely his ex-wife as implied.) And she goes berserk and chases him out of the jail, never to be seen again. 
---
Then he topdecks the üÖ±Ô∏èancient One with Charge and +10/+10
---
this post would have been better without a flair
---
That also ignores taunt
---
Well, obviously they need to be balanced and tested more before any semblance of use can be determined, but I do feel that the weapon would make hand druid viable since blizzard did try to push that archetype back in witch wood.  
---
For celestia's minion I initially wanted to give it a higher mana cost and stats, however after looking through some cards, I felt that it would be more useful in an aggresive deck, thus the lower mana cost. The main cards I was attempting to balance around was humongous razorleaf,Ancient watcher, quartz  elemental, unlicensed apothecary. This minion would push an aggresive archetype if more of such cards become available in the future. An additional note, this would curve out perfectly to the keening banshee and venture co as just a reason why it could be insane.  
---
Thanks for the reply :) 
---
Backstab, sap, evis, si-7, walk the plank, fan, vanish
---
i guess with fungal gone (?) it‚Äôs the card‚Äôs time to shine 
---
Can't use them with the rhino spirit if you're gonna do that though. Might as well use inner rage instead if plan on doing it for board wipe. Either that, or rampage the turn after board-wiping so you can also go face with that extra 3 attack.

---
This is going to be ridiculous in Wild.
---
Flavorfully, Priest gets psychic abilities which are represented by reading the opponent's thoughts (stealing cards from deck/hand) and mind control (stealing minions). Philosophically, a major aspect of Priest's identity is the duality between light and shadow. The class puts on a front of being harmless and even helpful while pulling the strings behind the scenes. He might not have any weapons you recognize at first, but because he's capable and willing to steal your resources, he has unseen weapons available to him at all times.
---
For Rogue, it's just flavor and only came into being mechanically after they nerfed Blade Flurry which left the class really limited in a mechanical space (weapons) that I think the developers intended to be a lot more prominent than it is today.
---
Since the other adventures didn't rotate (as long as you have the first wing) this will follow, so no, it will stay in your solo adventures.
---
Gotta disagree. Some really nice rouge-ish colors going on here, it's pleasant
---
It will stay.
---
seems ok for arena. 
---
It‚Äôs not very interesting but people seem to like it. I‚Äôll respectively disagree i think there are much nicer card arts so far.
---
I mean idk....zoo has a lot of ways to kill its own shit
---
How is this card 8 to face?
---
Didn‚Äôt Peter Whalen say they were going to reword cards like this that don‚Äôt work in Rogue v Rogue?
---
I do not remember the source but yes. You keep all adventures.
---
New players (the one who joined after 9th of march) will have to get access to these adventures through shop.
---
Next expansion seems to be a dragon heavy with notably Nozari and the long awaited Kalegos
---
So I made a quick mapping of all the lore relation between all the legendary dragons we already saw and it seems we already have most of them.
---
I am clearly not a graphic specialist, so just bear with me the bad looking format.
---
A bit too slow to run both this and highmane in the same deck in my opinion, also given that highmane has had to die in order to combo it with this, but we will see where the meta takes us
---
It is indeed true that playing many small minions would be more efficent with buffs and value trades. But by spamming minions you would quickly run out of resource, and this card can help us refill our hand. By the point you enter topdeck mode, small minions are no longer relevant as they would be wiped away easily with boardclears, thus big minions are better in that case.
---
Not if they are putting the cards on the bottom of their library. Lot so of cards do that instead of shuffle.
---
With a 3-mana 4/4 silence friendly minions card, you could make an entire deck based on that. Unlicensed apothecary in wild warlock, celestia, fel reaver, zombie chow, ancient watcher and humongous razorleaf, venture co. mercenary, quartz elemental, etc.
---
You could make a pretty bad deck riding on getting this one card into play.
---
I never noticed that. Very perceptive! Have an updoot 
---
Because it‚Äôs 3 mana these days. 
---
&gt; Although I do recall pre Warsong nerf, you could still play without a guaranteed OTK quite often if the opponent put on enough pressure.
---
Well that depends on what your opponent was playing. 
---
For example against any agressive deck like Zoo Warlock or Hunter or Druid a board of Patrons can pretty much win the game on its own.
---
On the other Hand against Hand Lock, Ctrl Warrior or Priest you pretty much always went for the OTK.
---
But that is not that different from todays combo decks is it. In any aggro match up you don't really rely on your combo to win but just survive until you stabilize. 
---
It says Discover so the minion is just added to my hand not summoned to the field correct?  But the Deathrattle effect immediately impacts the field?
---
Or conditional 0 mana deal 4 damage to a minion... 
---
Nine Lives, and it is not a cat? F

Indeed. But in hearthstone deck manipulation doesn‚Äôt work. Everything put back into the deck is randomised. 
---
In some form meaning every single tempo rogue then yeah sure. 
---
Odd interaction question: do you think that if another class managed to get this card in hand, it would trigger its own mana price drop? Pretty sure it‚Äôs the first card we‚Äôve seen with the ‚Äúif you‚Äôre holding a card from another class‚Äù text.

---
I‚Äôve tongue kissed it yes. Don‚Äôt we all? 
---

---
Okay then, a Twisting Nether that is less consistent, costs more for only your opponent's side of the board, with a big body, that stops on minions with divine shield or more than 8 health (or requires extra trades from your side of the board to facilitate the destruction of +8 health/divine shield minions.)

#ANGRY TRUMPETS
---
Oh wow. I expected new deathrattle synergy, but this one is sweet. It's a specific resurrect with an added discover effect on top of it, which means that you are very likely to hit that Deathrattle you're looking for, unless you go really all out with the deathrattle theme. And even if you really go all out with deathrattle minions, you should hit something worthwhile in the current standard set. This seems rather strong, the only problem Hunter might have, is the lack of outstanding deathrattle effects to trigger, outside of Oblivitron and the Whelp, but as this isn't just a deathrattle trigger and also a resurrect mechanic, it might be entirely worthwhile to just resurrect a Highmane+some bonus Hyenas. It's also somewhat clunky, as you have to draw, play and kill off one of your deathrattles, before this becomes active, but this seems like a minor concern.
---
I like the direction of resurrection in Hunter. Revenge of the Wild is already really cool and both should be fun (but not great) with the Spirit of the Lynx.
---
...? We are talking about mtg. If your comment applies to Hearthstone, the opponent wouldn‚Äôt need to shuffle their library anyway, for the reason you just stated.
---
Hearthstone doesn‚Äôt even have a library.
---
This is really great design. The fact that the deathrattle minion has to have died first means you can't just cheat out a 10 mana deathrattle for 3 mana early in the game. At turn 3 this will only give you incredibly simple deathrattles, and the longer the game goes on, the more powerful the card becomes. Love it.
---
It's just kinda fun
---
it's not the card's fault that other combo decks are worse
---
Way too inconsistent. There's just no way.
---
3 mana, summon 4/4 worth of stats and draw a card that is a strong late game threat.  That seems...bad to you?
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah seems scary
---
Good riddance bitch

He said it would stop saying opponents class, so you can have any class not just your opponents. The ways to get spells will stop saying opponents class so that they work vs rogue.
---
So thir card will work, you just have to use the new card creation cards. 
---
Nightmare amalgam is also a dragon! 
---
&gt; Even if you hit something like highmane, it‚Äôs just two 2/2‚Äôs and draw a highmane for 3 mana, not that great. 
---
It puts 4/4 worth of stats on the board and *creates* a highmane in your hand for 3 mana. Pretty good all things considered.
---
It‚Äôs a lot of self control, because you really want to just flood and get a huge board 
---
[[Masters call]] turned out pretty sweet you can choose when to activate this to get it's best effect as this does not have the chance of going wrong like discovering a non-beast 2 mana discover 1 was good 2 Mana get 3 is Epic. 5 stars
---
Oops yeah you are right. I misread this card.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs restricted to late game if you want max value
---
Definitely not. This is a string tempo play on turn 3 if a 2 mana deathrattle died
---
&gt; your opponent draws cards from their deck until a monster card is drawn.
---
This would trigger draw effects, like spiders and Hakkar poison.  Unless it's inconsistent with the wording.  Which has never happened.
---

---
This chain of comments started with someone having a stab at a yugioh phrasing of this card, to which someone responded with ‚Äúfound the mtg player‚Äù I had a stab at phrasing it as it would be in mtg. 
---
No worries

Yeah I enjoy that kind of aggro game too. Hope there is the opportunity fort plenty of it in the new meta!
---

Can you read? It‚Äôs a new account, he knows what he‚Äôs doing
---
Only with Cybertech Chip, right? I see no other way in standard right now to get two Oblivitrons in Hunter. Stitched Tracker in Wild makes it rather easy, though.
---
What's 1 mana less when you can't straight up get the Value if you manage to [[Grim Rally]] at one mana that makes 5 in total.

There's been a bit of everything here, except aggro. That'll come at the end. Worry not, it's going to be a brave new HS world come rotation. 
---
I have 1900 gold and 3 packs from 3 expansions that rotates out
---
Would it work with Da Undatakah?
---
One can assume that when I say 'battlefield' I am referring to my opponent's battlefield given the context of the proposition.
---
Oh it wouldn't occur? TIL :D.
---
No idea why you would just assume he was joking, let alone why you'd keep expressing yourself so snarkily. 
---
3 mana summon a 1/1 and draw a card. Hmmmm
---
I'll have 10k for the expansion. I used to save the packs i'd get in between expansions to open at the same time, but I let my kids open them now instead. 
---
I'm with you on that. Any deck running highmane is usually trying to win the game in the next few turns after playing it. This is way too slow to fill the next turns, you usually want to be charging a giant hyena at that point....
---
This card has potential with slower dumb combos though like the current DR hunter. 
---
That warrior one sounds super sick! I'm definitely going to try it
---

Well you have to be more specific of what you are saying.Explain to us what/why  is that you like or you do not  like so we can have some better opinion about your post . I mean its easy to judge like that "this sucks....i do not like that" etc etc. Also we still have 70 cards left to be revealed to have a complete opinion about the expansion. Its all about your "taste" tho,if you feel disappointed and you are not having fun then feel free to move on to your next game,that is all it matter i suppose.
---
I'm not sure how I feel about an illidari being a warlock card.
---
mm so the evil warrior think the good paladin is evil mmm
---
Stop pushing thief rogue. Every. Fucking. Expansion. Like 10 people like that shitty RNG filled archetype.
---
It‚Äôs boring now and never works. 
---
That is a lot of dust! I am very low, 415 right now, but HoF will help.
---
Just over 6k. 
---
Or gold
---
&gt; Nah they wouldn't fail to check such an obvious interaction.
---
have you even played this game
---
Yes! Decks are decks that aim to destroy themselves or benefit their opponent in one way or another.  When you come across one, you concede from pure intimidation.  
---
Ex. Yes! Paladin was the original, which was basically a deck consisting of only 1 cost spells, and skulking Geist.  The point, to play skulking Geist, destroy your own deck, get a chuckle and a concede out of your opponent 
---
Miracle rogue has always been my favorite deck, over the course of a few years I crafted all it's cards golden.  The list I was running in the pic was a Kingsbane hybrid 
---
Magic Illusion*, a trick is something a whore does for money.
---
Essentially they are joke decks that are made to make your opponent win. The ‚Äúyes‚Äù part is referring to saying yes to concede once you accomplish whatever goal your yes deck has (for example destroying all your cards with hemet).
---
More ammo for my tess rouge. HYPE
---
I dont really understand this. Few questions. 1. Dust now? is there a time to dust so you maximize your gains? 2. To clarify.. they give you back the dust when you dust and craft and dust again? 
---
this is all confusing lol..  can you tell im a noob 
---
I thought she was a meme when I first opened her - but boy have I gotten so much use out of her.
---

holy shit, you just blew my mind. I didn't even cross my mind that the scheme could have husktusk synergy. idk if it's good but i'm gonna try it. 
---
My daughter loves that, too! :-)
---
I do the same I let my nephew open my packs and he likes me to play the Legendary Tess Graymane he got me.
---
Collie and retriever are excited too,  so is my bull
---
Film your hand with token cards. Play mountain giant.
---
Play all the tokens, then sea giant.
---
Plausible?
---
That's kind of a waste of a legendary proc. I was thinking the mechanical dragonling but even that isn't super impactful.
---
Blizz: Creates stupid overpowered neutral card
---
Players: This card isn't fun or lore cool, pls nerf!
---
Blizz: Waits til it rotates out and instead creates a "yeeaaahhhhh mb that was way op, this is what we should've created in the first place" card
---
My biggest take-away from this is that I now want there to be a time-travel based expansion so we can get a Neltharion card.
---
You realize brann + jan alai literally broke the game. He knows xD
---
so, salt
---
Didn‚Äôt see it was DR at first and thought damn why aren‚Äôt people losing there shit. DR makes it poop. 
---
/r/whoosh
---
Except for the fact that flanking strike doesn't use two cards/ becomes really underwhelming if you only have one of those two cards.
---
I asked Pushkin the same question but I wanted to ask you
---
Have you ever had that much before if so how much of the set does it get you? Just curious.
---
Also do you get the same buzz for getting a good Legendary over a bad one?
---
Obviously with my limited resource getting good Legendaries off the bat without having to wait to save the dust feels amazing
---
Myra‚Äôs is just a lot better in most rogue decks
---
I mean... Yeah, it practically demands the enemy to have cheap aoe or lose the board instantly.
---
Put in another way. OH MY GOD. Two 1/1 dudes for two Mana. 
---
Mage can also freeze your board multiple times. Especially with all the spell generation they are getting.
---
Yeah, there aren't many that're that great.  It does summon it from your hand which is nice, but still...
---
Amazing how many people apparently dont realize spiderbomb exists. I mean what hunter would spend 3 mana to remove a random minion?!
---
i'll be honest, i stopped reading after the part i quoted
---
i also don't know what those two interactions are because i stopped playing a while back (fun game, but takes too much time to sustain the fun)
---
Oh gee.. a bad Omega Assembly. 
---
Maybe okay in Token Druid but I don't know.. Token Druid doesn't need random Druid minions. 
---
Well the stats aren't immediately on the board, so you have to pay the Mana to summon the copy you discovered. Seems like it'll show up too late in the game, unless we find ways to cheat the minions out.
---
No, combo decks are boring because there‚Äôs no counter-play, not because there‚Äôs no RNG in what happens. 
---
So it kills my board then I just shadow word death it and I win? 
---
Yeah.  You need to play Highmane, have it die, then you play this, but you can't play the Highmane you discovered on the same turn unless you're on 8 or 9 mana.
---
so to be fair, since you are not a player of the game any more, they could put in more rng and it will never affect you.
---
That might be the reason, yeah.
---
There's Rogue decks in HS history which could be called spell rogue, they just usually had another name.
---
Empires fall!
---
When X enter the battlefield your opponent looks at the top card of their library. If it is a creature card your opponent puts it on the battlefield under their control. Shuffle your opponents library.
---
So first thing to keep in mind is that there isn't clear distinction between decks.  All will have some elements of each of each, nor is there a clear line between them:
---
Tempo is generally board state.  A Tempo deck wants to maximize it's board state at all time, converting it's mana as efficiently as possible into board state.  They don't want to waste (float) any mana during the game, so they want to play strong early mid and late game.  Aggro and Midrange decks tend to being tempo decks.
---
Value is the opposite.  They want to get as much done per card as possible.  Floating a mana here and there is better than running a bunch of low cost cards.  They tend to like AoE/Board clears which lets them trade 1 of their cards for 3-5 of their opponents.  And then have 3-5 cards in their deck that wins the game later.  Tends to favor late game decks.
---
Control in HS is harder to define.  Typically control is negating all of your opponent's threats and slowly wearing them out in the late game, but that really doesn't work in HS.  You need cards to win the game, which means that control in HS tends to be suppressing the opponent's plan early and having massive cards to win late.
---
I will answer you but im not op, i find troubling the lack of support for aggressive decks, i and fear with all the disrupting tools control decks will take over the expansion.
---
I have to disagree with this whole heartily. They way AE decks are set up, there's a lot of skill and thought that needs to be put into how and when you "burgle" cards from other classes. It's just like managing any other resource in HS (life total, hand size, board, ...). I think that cards like this one that give you value based upon managing that resource well like this card are absolutely the way to go. 
---
I for one think that the meta could benefit a lot from archetypes like burgle necessitate that you have a flexible/new game plan every game.
---
I've saved like 6k gold
---
It's a funny way to say Egg Druid.
---
Egg Druid was a deck that exploded in popularity during Mean Street if Gadgetzan thanks to Jackie4Chan.
---
Just hearthstone wording and programming at its finest
---
With Bloodreaver Gul'dan gone from standart , you might hear the : **You face Jaraxxus Eredar Lord of the burning legion** again ! The OG deathknight !
---
You'd still more than likely play the Dire Moles. Not sure why you'd compare it to Keleseth. Zavas has no deckbuilding restrictions and would be played in a deck that absolutely needs its two drops.
---
Hall of famed
---
Lol, git gud
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to take it over, I think they‚Äôre trying to steal a bunch of magical goodies and/or something specific we don‚Äôt know about yet
---
No you got it wrong. Check the hall of fame guide on how to optimice the dust. It will only be worth for you if they actually nerf them. And since they got moved, and despite what some people claim here, they arent a problem (for now) on wild, so they will probably not be nerfed.
---
So you have more chances of actually losing dust than winning dust.
---
Because the spectacle is fun to experience.  I can put myself in my opponent's shoes and laugh at my fate with him.  That being said, yes Burgle Rogue should never been top tier, spectacles become just loud and bright if they happen to often.
---
perfection
---
Let's take a moment to remember that Drygulch Jailer was played as a card.
---
Worse stats, and just 1 more damage than the token for 1 more mana. Not better than Fire Fly but that's rotating out so it will see some play I think
---
Thief priest and thief rogue arw my favorite decks though, I love fighting people who net-deck every expansion and beating them with their own shit.
---
Oh, you want them to literally remove cards from your opponent's deck or hand like that Lich King spell?
---
I think that mechanic, especially out of the hand) would be too powerful in Hearthstone to use anywhere near a regular basis. The starting hand size is way too small for that to not be oppressive.
---
weapons, any of em, for priest
---
Closer to 1 / 2^5 as any result with the 1 health minion ends the third option.
---
&gt; Not sure why you'd compare it to Keleseth.
---
I was comparing your high roll reliance on Clutchmother Zavas to the high roll reliance of Keleseth.
---
&gt; Zavas has no deckbuilding restrictions and would be played in a deck that absolutely needs its other two drops.
---
It's still a card that is straight-up bad outside of being pulled by Tracking.
---
Lol, I've driven by there too! Greetings fellow New Jerseyan!
---
Yes, I love playing a dinomancy rogue with a 40 health jaraxxus as their hero 
---
It could even summon the other copy of itself, which could then summon something more powerful as long as your cleared your hand of low cost demons first.  Oblivitron is one per deck.
---
Recency bias at its finest. When they suggest these types of decks to be more prominent they often forget the shitstorm that was this sub when Yogg was winning torunaments on his own in the Karazhan meta 
---
[[Spider Bomb]] is 3 mana but you literally get a 3 mana lesser onyx spellstone and another spider bomb in your hand.
---
Acorn Man is such a stupid name for a card, itd be laughable to see it in a world final.
---

---
2/2/1 | Deathrattle: Draw a card.  
---
Your version would obviously be incredibly broken.
---
Thank god that damn egg is rotating. 
---
Also easier to fulfill than wingblast since it isn't reliant on a turn by turn condition
---
Tempo decks try to maintain control of the board usually with minions. The style of play usually works around not letting your opponent get a foothold in the game and snowballing with more and bigger minions that can't be removed. So if some says they're making a tempo play it usually means they have a minion that's situationally good but they're going to play it before the that situation to try and get a body on the board. 
---
Value usually has to do with answering your opponents cards with less cards than they used. Hitting your 2/3 into a 1/2 and then the next turn killing a 3/2 would be a nice value play because you cleared they're two cards with your one.
---
Control decks are usually more spell based and are focused on continually removing your opponents minions, maintaining "control" so to speak. Big board clears, hard removal and then usually they have larger minions to finish off the game along with smaller minions that usually have effects that help to remove or block other minions, can have a bunch of taunts. An example would be my quest warrior deck that's filled with taunts and then you win after completing the quest.
---
Aggro decks most often have a lot of small minions and spells that often deal damage. The goal of the deck is to take the board quickly and snowball fast so that your opponents dead before they get into the game. The hope with these decks is to always have a card to play on curve. 
---
Aggro decks usually kill control decks pretty easily unless they let the control deck get the mana to play their board clears and heals. The other deck interactions are usually more complicated. If the game is a mirror as in both players playing the same style, the more severe version of the deck. This means the faster aggro deck will win or the slower control decks will win. 
---
That's my understanding but be sure to read others in case I messed something up.
---
I pulled a Deathwing, Dragonlord from a Netherspite Historian, doubled it with Voone, and got another one with Dragon's Roar, along with a few other bigguns. Then I baited him into casting Shadow Word: Death with my first Deathwing, and he pulled the whole party out. Needless to say, the poor guy conceded.
---
I wonder what they'll do with kobolds/throne
---
It's the first time we've had free adventures, I wouldn't imagine them charging people for them. Maybe you'll have to redeem them through battle net and no cards will be awarded? (For people who've never touched the adventure or start post-rotation)
---
You I just realized why is she so busty
---
Speaking of, yeah. If Bomb Warrior is indeed a thing, this card will prove to be more dangerous than useful in that matchup
---
To be honest, you've summed me up completely. I just think that hearthstone has been steadily introducing cards that cause set methods to become so effective that you cannot climb ranked without a wiki and a deck that someone else made. But the fact that these strats are effective is why they are used and i understand that i shouldn't get salty at someone for playing the game. I just miss the time when it all felt new and i got a big rush from finding a good combo that synced up well. I suppose i'm just blaming people for not playing how i'd expect them to and i appreciate you calling me out on that.
---
He‚Äôs a stupid noob, but at least he‚Äôs a stupid noob who‚Äôs stronk.
---
I think every major town in America has one of these.
---
I wouldn't even call them combo decks, just control decks relying on card synergy. A combo-deck combo has to win you the game, not just the board.
---
Of course this sub would think that.
---
Thank you.
---
yeah it's weird, it's an overpowered card, but it is one of the few that i've never really been that mad about it being in the game, maybe just because the of the skill cap on it being so high
---
I'm saying all it needs is two cards.
---
&gt; So you can go infinite with one elekk on board and one in hand
---
Only if you will keep shuffling another copy of Plot Twist since you'll always shuffle two. Otherwise, no
---
They probably printed it to go with the new warlock legendary.
---
hahahaha,  i alway keep track of my of the pack  i have opened and with this number of packs, i might get 4  legendaries and 0 golden xD
---
I don't want to continue this discussion, as it leads to nowhere. You are dumb as a rock.
---
Oof
---
I prefer it not being on a minion and being cheaper instead 
---
People play strong decks? Wow who woulda thought? Play casual if u dont want people playing decklists. 
---
You discover a friendly deathrattle minion that died this game, adding it to your hand. Then you trigger its deathrattle as if it were on the board and died. There's no changing deathrattles.
---

---
Holly crap, is that card real? This card is insane, for the cost of 1 card and 2 mana you can look for any answer in your deck more efficiently than you already could with life tap. Now, I know you can draw some of the same cards back, but that's not very likely at the start of the game when you look for removal or giants depending on matchup. I think every non Zoo Warlock deck will include this card.
---
PS. I think they tested this mechanic a in arena few months back and they buffed and nerfed that card at the same time. It's 2 mana instead of 4, but also can draw cards thay you already have in you hand. 
---
If you have no duplicates *in your deck*
---
...you know they probably did that on purpose, right?
---
Well, the cosmic anomaly + jinx + 2 arcane missiles is only possible in turn 10, and tempo mage (at least in wild) already wins before that. In standard, it can be a strong combo, but its 20 random damage and 4 cards, while pyro is 10 sure damage to something and 1 card. Volcano is just 5 mana 1 card 15 damage and it wasnt op, and sometimes it doesnt even clear the board if you are behind (well, also it targets your own board).
---
It can be a strong combo, but its not an instant win combo, it requires surviving with a tempo deck to turn 10 and get those 4 cards and have them still in your hand (so you must have other cards in hand to play the previous turns to keep the "tempo"). Getting 20 damage randomly split looks like a decent payoff, to be honest.
---
Repeating the same shitty argument twice doesn‚Äôt make it less shit btw 
---
You‚Äôre still thinking of the now, when this is obviously a seed of an idea. We don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôll end up.

I've been hoping there'd be some discard-friendly cards in this expansion, and this looks like a nice addition to the meta.  A discard-lock, especially with the quest, lives and dies on what they can get in their opening hand and/or mulligan; drawing sometimes helps bring in new cards, but the ability to swap out a hand that's simply not working for you with one that might is an invaluable tool in the arsenal.
---
I am really interested in building a Bomb Warrior deck, if this card becomes popular I guess that'll seal the deal

---
Both of them and two more pings gets you there so it's not too hard, but it'll definitely be more of a control play. No more bullshit Ragnaros on 7 
---
Candles get shuffled into your opponents deck
---
Basically, if it works the first way, you play Eleck into Plot twist with a second Eleck and Plot Twist in a 5 card hand, shuffling 10 cards in and as a result drawing 10 cards, creating a non quite infinite deck that cand draw at exceptionally high rates without speeding into fatigue.
---
If it works the second way, where the Plot Twist doesn't count the eleck shuffles in the counting, then it is basically a slightly harder DMH in a class that might be able to abuse it more, especially in wild, which still is definitely interesting
---

I got just enough for 40 packs so far. probably gonna get enough for  5 more packs or so. New expac hype!

It doesn't surprise me, it bothers me.

That's a bold statement.

In the second example, you can actually shuffle +8 cards in your deck.  Start with 10 cards.  You play Augmented Elekk (9 cards).  You play Plot twist (8 cards in hand).  You shuffle 8, send 8 copies into your deck, and draw 8.
---
This will be an interesting interaction to know.
---
Well the weapon , minion and legendary are all decently stated so I don't see why not. Just the 3/3 minion and weapon is 20 damage in opponents deck. I see no reason not to play them if cards like this become meta.
---
Four card combos are absolutely viable in the class with the best card draw.
---
This sums my 4 year hearthstone career.

In all of TCGs this mechanic has appeared. Took Hearthstone a while to finally make a card like this.

Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Looks like 4 is the new 3, this expansion.  All the good spider tanks they printed in the last year go down in value a bit.
---
Which is entirely RNG. Whether he plays a minion in his first 10 cards, or whether a secret triggers by your spell or hero power for trying to kill that minion.
---
Can't wait to see the Trolden clip of someone shuffling their hand and redrawing the exact same cards.
---
Activision-Blizzard supposedly loves money, but they refuse to take my money to let me buy this hero.
---
It shows how much Activision-Blizzard really doesn't love money with how they made the most popular alternative hero the only one you couldn't ever buy from them with money.
---
I wouldn't mind paying $10, maybe even $20 for a dumb exclusive thing that makes my game more 'customized' and fun to play. Locking it behind such a steep investment, tied to other free-in-time rewards is kinda dumb. Sure, offer the $80 bundle with the portrait, gold legendary, packs, and card back, but please let me spend my beer money on just the portrait.
---
You disconnected
---
Void contract type beat
---
Remember thought that after the rotation Warlock will be back to having very little healing.
---
Yeah my bad, thanks for the correction
---
this isn't even remotely comparable to Time Twister. Time Twister draws you a full hand from a potentially empty one. Winds of Change is a much closer MTG comparison.
---
Does that mean Whizbang will never rotate out of Standard?
---
Possible, I never looked much into magic. So I take they have the same problem.
---
Dragon theme is all in the 'heroic' classes though-    Paladin and Mage and such. Doesn't thematically fit EVIL working for a dragon. Also, where's the fun in having someone upstage Rafaam?
---
I want that.
---
pad stats to the mech taunt? like 4 mana 0 9 taunt?
---
I never feel like there's nothing I can do when playing against most RNG decks, and when I play my steal Priests it rarely feels like my opponent has little to do. The only thing I feel is the excitement of infinite lines.
---
I'm feeling a [[Scavenging Hyena]] nerf coming
---
respectable player 
---
I thought this was a new card until i read the card text

&gt;In fact, auctioneer seems pretty weak these days
---
Apart from the whole "carrying the viability of mechathun in druid" thing
---
Well, if a third of a expansion is basically nothing new I might happen to find that boring
---
You actually helped tons of people with this guide full of details. I have seen you post it in many threads!! Nice job
---
You could always play wild
---
Also the ingame deck helper had a MASSIVE upgrade this month. Netdecking no longer necessary
---
It only took Blizzard 6 years to print Tolarian Winds. Progress!
---
Me too! Except I opened a Rin in my free pack from logging in on March 25th so I threw her in. Won my first three games in a row with Azari.

3/1/5 Mech | Magnetic Taunt

(ASIA) EnglishBob#11253 - Trading 80g quest.
---
Warlocks didn't exist in WC3, not as a playable hero at least. They were pretty much created solely for WoW and were more or less a combination of Death Knights and Demon Hunters. When both of those were added to WoW as hero classes, Warlocks lost their abilities when they returned to their proper class.
---
Correct.
---
He adds 3/3 to a taunt for 1 mana. 
---
Or is a purify target. 
---
You're right. If you try to play brann + windshear or just double windshear in the same turn, you won't have enough board space for 2 al'akirs. 
---
Alright, seeing this I probably should shut up and be happy with Hearthstone lol
---
But the taunt has to be a mech, and there are way better options for purify
---
Read all of it because didn't play wow. Thanks for the information. Definitely deserved an upvote.
---
Betrug gives rush, so what‚Äôs the win condition here lol
---
Here is a sub-division in my area: [Hearthstone](https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/d77c8d68d4e65e784a5c46b0b4c796aa)
---
Thanks. I tried different builds of Dragon Roar Warri, but always ended up with a Control Warrior, which has some problems against Rexxar, especially when there are two Dire Frenzy. I really hate this stupid combination, it's not fun at all to play against that.
---
I will give it a try with your list. It looks cool and fun. 
---
Nah, I just had part of the title ready already, needed to just add the card name, then I just took a quick screenshot and pasted it. 
---
Nice, just boil down my complaint on a wider series of balance issues to ‚Äúur bad lol‚Äù this community is ass
---
Good bot!
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99998% sure that quacak is not a bot.

Now you can get a life 
---
&gt; A 5 star Paladin card is a card that you just plop into every single Paladin deck and it wins games for you
---
That's not really what 5 star cards mean though...
---
For instance, you could have a 5 stars aggro card that doesn't fit in any control, a 5 star control card that doesn't fit in aggro, 5 stars combo cards, etc...
---
Or a 5 star midrange hunter cards that doesn't fit in spell hunter because, obviously, it's a minion.
---
To some people (Trump, I think) 5 star cards are cards that are part of a tier 1 deck... To me it's more than that, because even T1 decks have random trash taunts etc that are easily replaceable. 
---
But to me, a 5 stars card is a card that define a strong deck, or at least is part of what makes the strong deck viable. 
---
It doesn't matter if it's just 1 deck (and trash in everything else), if that deck is T1, then it's 5star. 
---
It is a typo and I can‚Äôt edit the title.
---
Or just regular religion
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs matchups against aggressive decks obviously aren‚Äôt as good with less board clears and no upgraded hero power but big boomship plays to cheat out stuff like double Ysera gives you an actual chance against all the match ups that odd warrior auto loses to 
---
You can build it like Exodia Paladin except instead of winning the game you're summoning Al'Akir.
---
So we might end up with a generic minion like "Aranasi Broodmother" or something :/
---
I don‚Äôt play enough Hearthstone as that I would recall such things, but I am fairly certain if you would search for it it is there.
---
Dollmaster dorian's value!
---
This makes me really glad ice block is not in standard.
---
But what blocks it from being Tier 1 tho ? If we break down the most broken decks right now we have to deal with Priest(wall and dragon control) both will loose a lot, for wall priest: psychic scream,oakheart,tarcreeper,spellstone and shadow visions. That are the key cards for this deck. Hunter looses Rexxar which is kind of a one man army at some point. Odd paladin looses baku. Odd mage too. That's all of the tier one decks rn just demolished.
---
Yes, I believe so.  It is very near Hackettstown
---
Johnny/Mel player here, for one, I don't think you quite get how these player types work, Johnny players enjoy playing elaborate combos and synergies while Mel players like intricate interactions and niche cases such as getting a shudderwock with a undatakah deathrattle that has a carnivorous cube and an immortal prelate. (which does in fact keep the deathrattle of the cube by the way). I would never run Millhouse or temporus unless it's specifically with a combo or interaction to let me profit off of it such as seeing how the turn timer works if you play a temporus on your first extra turn (Which skips the second turn and stacks the effect giving you 3 turns in a row after your opponent goes) or with a time put in paladin allowing me to OTK them with it. 
---
That being said, the deck builder is perfectly fine, considering that Johnny, Mel, and Vorthos players are far more likely to build there own deck anyways, as they are the more creative of the bunch, as well as the fact that it gives them an opportunity to challenge yourself by purposefully putting subpar cards in your deck and trying to win with that / seeing how the deck builder responds, such as Baku Priest 
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt agree with it either, but their reasoning is basically that it would be too confusing for new players. 
---
Happy feast of Winter Veil!
---
AYE I live in Hackettstown/ Long Valley fam. I drive by there everyday while going to Golds Gym. I‚Äôm hype to see my town represented
---
I like Barnes significantly more in this version. Previously he looked way too high rolly (like a 33% chance to hit anything useful) but it looks closer to 50+% now. (at work glancing on mobile) 
---
 Kaj#1240 on EU looking to trade the 80g quest. I'd like you to go first please.
---
They will probably activate with the first pack from the set you buy/open
---
Bybee is the only aranasi that is yellow though (like the card art preview). It would be amusing if Blizzard intended to make Sael'orn and messed up with the color. And true, Sael'orn would make much more sense to be printed since this is a Dalaran expansion
---
Wasnt this nerfed when it was illidan? Now it costs way less?
---
A mulligan for 2 mana?  Love it 
---
Since you generally keep cards that are situational but powerful, and combo pieces in your hand, forcing a control or combo deck to shuffle their cards into their deck on like turns 8-15 or so could be devastating.  It's not like you are giving up random cards, the opponent is losing cards that they've specifically chosen to hold on to.
---
dxw100#1827 80g quest trade NA
---
Is that mechanical whelps music?
---
I thought it was rogue. 
---
Thanks for posting!
---
Wish I wasn‚Äôt hearing about it last minute though. Is there a site that posts all of these tournies? 
---
Sure. Tho it‚Äôs pretty clear the real intention is to be playing both these cards together, with the end result being 10 mana for a 5/7 and clearing your opponents board and getting a new hand for yourself. 
---
That‚Äôs in an ideal situation, mind you. 
---
He is a streamer and YouTuber who primarily plays wild with unusual and fun decks. He is really entertaining. He plays a lot of decks with deathrattle in their core and it‚Äôs kind of a meme on his channel.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it, especially considering how they messed up on the Malygos and Stampeding Kodo art.
---
Val'anyr in rogue
---
Blizz have been making over 3 years of empty promises that we'd get another chance to get her :(
