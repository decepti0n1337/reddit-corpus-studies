It is Chinas turn to take control of Asia. It is a cycle.
---
---
---
They also harvest organs from the fulon gong.
---
Fuck China.
---
I don't think people right now want to hear arguments about how Blizzard didn't have a choice, or if Blizzard would go bankrupt tomorrow if China banned them.
---

---
People aren't gonna forgive a major corporation for getting themselves into that kind of situation.
---
Whatabautism at its finest.
---
Also, the guy said what he said in response to this shit. Not just randomly do it. Are you aware in what thread you are?
---
I’d appreciate an intelligent response, as opposed to something brainless and an attempt to personally attack me. Please try again?
---
Btw how does the game plan on adjusting to ethereum 2.0?
---
\*honk honk\*
---
The. Kid. Violated. His. Contract. Stop. Blaming Blizzard. For. This.
---
They did what they were supposed to do when someone representing their brand violates their contract. They are not trying to scilence his message. They are trying to protect their company. They know the message is out there. They know the clip was recorded. They know they cant cover it up. They are not stupid. If anything this draws more attention to it. Blizzard is literally helping spread the message by handling it so poorly. This hate mongering in our society needs to end. I seriously doubt any single individual working for or with blizzard supports what the Chinese government is doing. They literally have to follow protocal when something like this happenes.
---
NOTE EVERYONE!  
---
There are two account creations on our website.
---
One is for creating an Immutable account and will let you login to the site and game.  
---
The other, the one in the big white box labelled Portis, is to create an ethereum wallet. You DO NOT need to do this until you plan on buying cards and there are other options.  
---
If you are having problems logging in please make sure you have made an Immutable account and NOT just a Portis Wallet. We will be addressing this soon for now please note the difference!

I’m so thankful people like you exist. You deserve the 50k upvotes and awards.
---
It saddens me that I only found 2-3 posts here that try to be rational and see both sides of the story. You are perfectly right. This is not a US National situation. It is not the job of Blizzard and companies in general to participate in foreign politics only because some people like that.
---
I feel many people think Blizzard act out of pure evil. It’s sad they don’t inform themselves about the situation and that they don’t know that Blizzard is not independent and that Activision has a say in these things.
---
Really thank you though. Great post.

Breaking news: Blizzard announcing bankruptcy
---
They GOT money, but will get no more. It's much easier for a company to get money from current customers vs trying to aquire new ones. If you don't think customers choosing to no longer buy products from a company doesn't hurt them, I can assure you, it does.
---
Social media.  Create a Facebook page and get people involved to do something.  It's not that hard at all.  At 15 I was protesting for Mexican farmer rights, my age didn't stop me from organizing and helping where I could.
---
I think I this is the crux of it. He did it to get support, because there is no personal gain for himself. In fact it is probably dangerous if he has to go back or is still in the Area.
---
&gt;The mods here at /r/hearthstone have been SUPER CHILL about it
---
Objectively true.
---
Not going when you already bought the ticket is pretty irrelevant, you do more harm if you hold up any kind of anti-Blizzard or anti-China stuff.
---
I would agree that buying a ticket now would be terrible though (at least without very good reason).
---
I just bought five packs for each of the years you played
---
But it’s true though!
---
Bruh... his city is under an active social upheaval and he had a minute to make a rally cry for his fucking freedom. How short sighted are you to suggest, "Whelp, that was of poor class of him, wasn't it? Chip chip, better grab some more tea!"

How entitled are you to not have to worry about being shot for being out of curfew? Have a clean trip to the store for food? Not being targeted for **speaking your mind, freely?**
---
Just as an update, the app is now sitting at 4.0 on the App Store. Speaking from a software developers perspective, this change, especially in the short time since this news broke, is quite significant. Speak the only language they understand. Vote with your wallet.
---
Ah yes I've seen that and I would agree it certainly is deserved if that translation says what the comment says it says
---
They are going to keep quiet most likely.
---
Are you talking about Blizzard or the community? Because community is just responsing on Blizzard disgusting political involvement. I've never ever in my whole life seen Blizzard getting fired THIS much, it has surpassed Diablo Mobile disaster..... People in Hongkong are in revolution and Blizzard is siding with a government who are abusive and treating non traditional Chinese people worse than animals.
---
Enjoy the ride.... This is going to last a while (Blizzcon, next HS expansion etc)
---
I don’t think it should but reality is, that IS how it works. I didn’t make the fuckin rules

It seems like you're offended over nothing though. And no one's offended

Here is the response I got:
---
Hello there Zack!

Specialist Game Master Pelzzakka here, I understand that you were looking to get a refund on all of your Hearthstone, Call of Duty, and Overwatch purchases on your account.
---
While those purchases are not meant to be refunded we do like to help out our players whenever we can. So I took a look over your account in the hopes that we could make an exception. Sadly it was not eligible for a refund as those games were purchased too long ago and have had too much progress made on them. .
---
I hope the reset of your day is a good one.

Do you own...a SINGLE product by a single company on earth? Congratulations, you support whatever human rights that company violated, and nearly every single company is guilty of human rights violation. See? That sound like a batshit insane argument to you? Because that’s the argument you just made.
---
Uninstalling things you've paid for is like buying something and throwing it out while new
---
If you don't want to give them money, that's easy to do, when new products are released don't buy them
---
You've already paid for these products, uninstalling them doesn't accomplish anything
---
Doesn't this disregard overlap?
---
&gt;OK then cynical internet tough guy, other than doing personal boycotts and making an effort to explain to others WHAT ELSE should we be doing.  
---
Practicing what you preach.  
---
Posting on reddit is one thing but honestly no one cares what you say you're going to do to one company vs what you actually do in regards to every other company that supports the Chinese government either directly or indirectly.  
---
Talk is cheap.
---
I'm just disappointed with blizzard all together. They really only care about money
---
Man, I seriously wish CoD wasn't made by Activision right now, I had some great fun with that game. But eh, what can you do honestly.
---
"Socioeconomic sparring" with China - which is what will ultimately limit or hasten China's rise to power - seems to me to be of massive, global importance, even if it may not be as photogenic as a political protest.
---
Lmao good luck with this... Also
---
That rule is basically, say any word or move your body in any way we "don't like" and we can deny you all prizing and defame you. Literally sickening.
---
The problem isn’t that they let the player go due to his political beliefs, it’s that Blizzard rushes to defend China due to their market as quickly as possible in the face of human rights violations. 
---
If a player ranted about how much they hated Trump,  Blizzard would have just as much right to drop them from Grandmasters. The problem is their response (particularly the Chinese version) proves that the primary motive of the banning was for Blizzard to excuse themselves from being banned from Chinese markets.
---
After years of Blizzard touting inclusivity and “Every Voice Mattering”  they clearly care about money more than human rights and democracy.
---
I'm accessing and commenting on not a member, just a lurker.
---
You spent $500+ today? Wow.
---
They accepted being blackmailed instead of forfeiting profit in a show of support for human rights. By doing so they are simply reinforcing that money&gt;people's lives. If it cost them their company to not have Chinese money, they will have *done the right thing*.
---
I'm finding hard to believe that all these people that are saying "I won't give them another cent!" are saying the truth. If you're already someone that spend money in these games, you're probably gonna keep going, sure you may stop for a week or two, but you're gonna come back. Specially WoW players.
---
You know that, I know that, Activision-Blizzard knows that.
---
Someone really should deface that plaque with spraypaint or something

Good point- I wonder what Blizzard's reaction will be/how they handle these tweets
---
Yup, always the troll DocSpock. You never change.
---
Why are Blizzard cowards for censoring this guy (to protect their livelihood), but streamers who have nothing to say because they're scared of losing their livelihood are totally fine?
---
I quit Hearthstone while back. As a Cantonese American, I am mad how Blizzard values money moreover Human rights. This is very sickening to hear
---
Public embarrassment of Blizzard is almost as good as you having money.
---
You seem surprised by this sort of hypocritical behavior?  I'm not.
---
Sorry, which is it? "No one is offended," or "it seems like I'm offended?"
---
No.
---
you're no one
---
Buddy I never once said this guy wasn’t allowed to defend his freedoms , my point was he breached a contract and used blizzard as a platform to express his views while he was binded to a contract that stated otherwise. He could have done what he did any other way and kept his job and money. Sadly that’s the world we live in l but there is a time and place for everything and doing it on the job (if u wanna consider that a job) was probably not the best option.
---
Forcing your opinion on the streamer is exactly what you are supposed to be against. This post shows perfectly what is wrong with all this reddit uproar.
---
Yes I completely agree with you on that, but they would lose a lot more not conforming to China than us boycotting them, also what blitzchung did is against the rules and while the punishment was harsh, a hearthstone tournament isn't really the place to bring up such topics, it undermines the point he was trying to make.
---
Or gold farmers
---
Is that a China sponsored comment?
---
Done. Other things blizzard has done were making me want to refund but I didn't know how and this was more than a bit of a reason to take it back. Fuck this fake virtue signaling company. Blizzard is dead.
---
Nice edit.
---
This man is a hero, he knew exactly what would happen to him but he knew he had to stand up for his cause anyway
---
Activision-Blizzard is a single entity and they fucked up together.
---
You made me spit my drink dude! hahahaha are you serious? hahahaha
---
And the rest of reddit too. 
---
In a week or two things will have cooled down.
---
I think most people know what is going on. We have blizzard siding with Chinazis because they pay them money. Simple as that.
---
It will reflect on their internal subscriber numbers and reduce the chance of me buying more card packs or loot boxes to zero. Not sure why I'm arguing with you, not doing this for you.

Done :)

---
Or do what I did, I completely stopped playing all blizzard games around a year ago due to hearthstone issues.
---
I've been playing since starcraft, wc3 roc and diablo 1 religiously. I even put around 100$ an expansion in for hearthstone for pretty golden decks. Now they get nothing from me
---
You are presenting a false dilemma. We can both criticize Blizzard *and* oppose China. Many people already do. But of course the conversation here is about Blizzard kowtowing to an authoritarian regime, rather than the regime itself; this is a subreddit about a Blizzard game, not geopolitics.
---
Great point
---

History's shown when people put a lot more on the line than canceling their accounts and making grandiose posts on Reddit, then they effect change.
---
Good for you
---
There's no way for them to "win". You can't please everyone. However, if China can exercise such influence over Blizzard, then there is no reason we westerners who make up most of blizzard's customer base shouldn't do so as well.
---
That’s not the point tho, he’s one of many that won’t be spending money anymore. Alone he’s not a big deal but together that’s a big dent.
---
Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!
---
Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened!
---
 Both the "Think Globally" and "Every Voice Matters" values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. 
---
These have been covered at the entrance with paper/tape! Check twitter I somehow cannot post the name of the guy or it will not let me post.

They did not do it on gm livestream though did they? They did it on their own time.

This is actually the most accurate comment.

He wont disappear unless he goes to China. He will be safe in Taiwan.
---
dont worry, chinese players gladly cover lost players from todays drama
---
Well that is an opinion answer. I don't think he ever intended to "destroy Blizzard" nor do I think he did. Blizzard could have handled this situation much better as well.
---
I will say that there's so much at stake with HK that it needs all the awareness possible. China was able to get away with so much over the decades by keeping to the "shadows" and people staying silent. They are finding it much tougher nowadays with the global connectivity.
---
Ok

Oh my seems like a big waste

Our servers are slammed. We are working on it! Please be patient :)

If you wanted karma you need to post a screenshot of you uninstalling with a copypasta of free hong Kong.

Apparently Blizzard expressed their stance in Chinese media starting that they'd back their country... so good for staying neutral

The US has much stronger free speech protections than most western countries.
---
Cool. Why don't you go escape from reality elsewhere instead of trying to avoid the topic of the day on reddit?
---
Very few people are complaining about the legality of Blizzards actions (which are most likely 100% legal). People are complaining about the choices the company has made by voting with their wallets.
---
The world is full of hypocrisy, mortal. What matters most is impact. If you were thinking this would shake our values, then you are sadly mistaken.

My issue overall is inconsistency with the portaits. Like, Garrosh and Jaina are them at their later years, which makes sense to me. Then most of the others are just alternate art of their normal selves, and then Valeera is cosplaying as a pirate.

Damn, I was looking forward to the final wing of Tombs.

Yeah, the holocaust wasn’t a big deal either right? Throwing Hispanic kids in cages? Who cares about that so long as I can sit on my fat ass and play video games. All the atrocities of the world are a ok so long as I can sit on my fat ass and do whatever I want...that is unless I’m in a situation where I’m mugged, shot, raped, etc. I’m sure my attitude will change when I experience something traumatic.

Funny enough [according to the World News Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dewc98/blizzard_suspends_hearthstone_player_for/) it isn't.
---
I’d say mutually assured destruction is why we haven’t had a nuclear war.
---
Made me cry laugh
---
Lmao the best part to me about this is that all this shit was known about China before, but they ban a tweet or a player, they do something immediate to your gaming community and all of a sudden its boycott time. If only they had the tournament before the expansion came out. Maybe then it would matter.
---
Just because you deny the shades of grey in the topic does not mean they don't exist. And it's a false dichotomy to say that the issue is human rights vs oppression.
---
I quit when secretkeeper lost her booty to please the Chinese.
---
This, the company I work for (SaaS platform in the bay area) just recently went through the process of trying to get compliant and from what I took away from convos with legal and the info sec team was that it was a massive PITA and resource intensive process to get to the minimal levels of compliancy.

Who the fuck do you think you are talking like that?  That was actually very funny to read lol.

Oh I’ve heard the term. I’m sure many thought of it as they were hauled off in the middle of the night for literally nothing. Never to be seen again or turn up months later dead from “suicide from missing organs.” 
---
Following the laws of a tyrant government is helping them. I’m not saying to start destroying shit but not letting people speak up because you’re scared to lose you china money paycheck is cowardly to say the least. Especially from a company and held “every voice matters.” As a core belief.... “well till it might cost us money. But feel free to support the safe stuff. We like that.”
---
Fuuuuuck you
---
I'm gay and I'm cool with where the anger is pointed. I just don't feel like complaining about people fighting for something just because they are not fighting for me. And I'm suuuper self-centered (as in probably I should see a doctor), mind you.
---
Of course, it wasn’t a trump bashing article
---
Blizzard was dead its activition now.
---
Alright, I thought about it all day and I finally did it and uninstalled their games.
---
It wasn't easy as I am not a micro transaction guy and I had a hard time figuring out if this would have any impact at all. I hope they have a dashboard somewhere really visible in their offices where everyone will see the numbers dive.
---
So you made almost this exact argument an hour ago, got severely downvoted, and now you think the public opinion has shifted enough for you to try again?
---
&gt;1. Appease the Chinese Community
---
&gt;2. Appease the NA/EU Community
---
Or the secret third option "Do what's right and what your listed companies value demands". It's ridiculous that a call for democracy should be seen 'Too controversial and offensive' for a western company. 
---
If they wanted to go give him a slap on the wrist for breaking the rules... Sure. But nuking him from orbit for standing up for democracy. Shameful.
---
You do realize communism is the reason China is what it is to begin with right? Capitalism is why we are free and they are not.
---
"Like doing nothing for example. Oh, wait..." /s
---
A lot of people are definitely just latching onto this for political purposes, even if it's totally appropriate for Blizzard to remove Blitzchung.  I feel like the casters were earnestly trying to avoid participating in his stunt though and throwing them under the bus for it as well comes off as Blizzard making a larger gesture to appeal to some pressure from China.  I don't find that acceptable.
---
I also don't think it's acceptable for China to be exerting these kinda threats on foreign companies to push their politics on a global scale.  There needs to be stauncher resistance to these kind of tactics.
---
I also doubt that the quality of Blizzard products really changes much if they lose the Chinese market.  Probably very little changes, except you see less shit like Diablo Immortal.
---
It's true a lot of people would lose access to games they care about, and that's unfortunate, but that's just a real consequence of China acting the way it does.  The people would have no one to blame but their own government, that's not on Blizzard.  Forcing foreign companies to toe the line with all China's shitty politics is not a reasonable bargaining chip, and they deserve to lose that business.
---
I wasn't trying to make anything a numbers game, I was simply using it as a tool to illustrate the scope as opposed to using ambiguous terminology like "this is big" or "this is small", it adds a point to wrap your mind around. Diablo Immortal also wasn't that big of a deal and was all over the gaming blogs/websites. 
---
Also, I think the "Diablo Immortal incident" might have less of an impact on ATVI stock than you may think, considering the entire market saw a decently sized down turn around that time last year. Everything was down and many investors weren't happy across the board. To be fair though, ATVI hasn't fully recovered the same way some other companies have. So, that's not saying the Diablo thing didn't play a role at all. However, their drop started before BlizzCon and they're still up 159% over the last 5 years (a common marker for investing). Which is worth considering as well.
---
But their initial response was a bit of a letdown. I loved Silver speaking up, but in terms of what has already transpired, it's a bit late
---
Hoes mad
---
You will hang for this.
---
Aw man - Paradox? Damn, I really like their stuff.

Oh well, onto the do not buy list they go...

---
Attack my argument, you know nothing about my person. I’m not discouraging you from protesting, I’m calling you a hypocrite because you’re choosing your protest. Every company is guilty, so should not every company be treated the same? I silently hate nearly all corporations, yet I buy from them the same because that is what is sold. I’m not going to shout about blizzard while typing on my phone, because that kind of irony borders on stupidity.

Not really. Tencent did buy about 5 or 10% of shares into reddit but that group is also part of the reason there is a lot of online censorship in china i believe.

---
Inspiring and Brave, Blizzard management are you paying attention to how to step up your game?
---
&gt; Blizzard is not being evil, they're being stupid.
---
No, they are being evil. Blizzard does a lot of stupid things, but most of the time its well-intentioned.
---
This time, they knew it would be wrong to ban the guy and take away his prize money, but did it anyway because of money.
---
I don't think this is a good idea because I think you will wound the wrong target. Most, if not the vast majority, of employees at Blizzard had nothing to do with this decision.  
---
It is more likely to make the employees, who probably feel like shit already for something they can't control, feel even worse.  
---
This is a corporate Blizzard problem, not a boots-on-the-ground employee problem.
---
Please don't take this corporate choice out on the customer service reps
---
Well the Republican party is disgracing our country currently so it seems fitting
---
I honestly hope you're not being serious rofl.  If you are, this is ever more hilarious!
---
If you're going to move goalposts I'm going to quit wasting my time with you. 
---
It's pretty cut and dry. You say the player doesn't have the right to get political, yet it's okay when Blizzard does. Net result is it's okay to be political so long as it is in line with Blizzard's politics. That's not okay.
---
So this: 
---
&gt;Americans getting their free speech encroached upon
---
Doesn't, in any way, single out freedom of speech as it's specified in the US constitution as opposed to freedom of speech as an ideal that should be afforded to people the world over? 
---
Nice attempt to move to goalposts.
---
The interesting part is that I actually agreed with your side of things, but because I think it's important to be intellectually honest with ourselves as well, suddenly I'm the one you're upset with

I mean, I'm just saying that the entire point of those posts is to be visibly all over the front page in solidarity. Acting like that somehow results in mods being forced to do some kind of sick and twisted forced labor scheme is ridiculous.

I'm mac and android only. They can't create a client fast enough. Anything you recommend to tide me over?

look diablo mobile version, and fk you bli$$ard.
---
I have been considering handing over my passport recently against my presumably better judgement to play Hearthstone again, as I never transitioned my authenticator to a new phone. Now I know it really is likly against my better judgement to do so.
---
How will they suffer? They just skip everything that mentions refund and "protest, Hong kong, China , human rights". Then they save their job and a headache
---
LOL
---
It's a betrayal of all of us who used their products. I'm appalled at them.
---
Welp, at least they'll still have one player.  
---
This might be the easiest run to #1 legend anyone has ever had.
---
You are ill for sure.
---
Thats possible, I just don't know every single countries laws. There could be some European country with the same free speech protections as the US.
---
Soooo, “ we should stay silent and do nothing, right?” 
---
About the guy i replied, he never mentioned hk when i replied him. So idk what you are talking about, unless you just want to continue this pointless conversation.
---
Yeah, when they're not complaining about video games causing school shootings.
---
Wouldn't abusing this system lead to laws being more restrictive in the future and kind of feed into the argument that we shouldn't have these regulations?
---
God. Prager U, the morons who got pissed at a baker being sued as a slam to the free market, then got pissed that YouTube is cutting their shit back. Calling it censorship. 
---
Womp womp motherfuckers.
---
Republican and Democrat senators have both come out against Blizzard for this. It's actually a bipartisan topic.
---
I just did the same with wow. Not as many years but yeah this is sick.
---
Not *those* voices.
---
You are just lying if you say people in Taiwan are not Chinese.  Sure, there are other cultures, but there are absolutely Chinese in Taiwain.   
---
WTF? You said something really bizarre saying people in Taiwan are not Chinese. Obviously some are. They call themselves Chinese.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no luck. If I can figure it out I'll get back to you.
---
&gt; then realizes that they were wrong and then everyone’s going to look like an idiot
---
I'll never feel like an idiot for having believed in democracy and free speech, even if I am forced to say otherwise in a re-education camp sometimes in the future.
---
No player should be punished for his beliefs *as long as those beliefs align with the core beliefs of our target market such that we can exploit them for marketing purposes.
---
I just uninstalled. I don't want to support Blizzard anymore until they reverse this decision.
---
They are mad at the mods who deleted the link.
---
It also has investments in Tesla, but more importantly, REDDIT. I am using a devil product right now but can't help myself.

It was outside the game, post game.

Oh yea?

What is your worker ID?

Soooo what happened? I have been busy for awhile
---
The message he aimed to send have been exhaustively disseminated and exposed and condemned in all the possible news agents and socia media platform. It's really not like he is exposing some hidden evilness that no one knows about. There is really no need for him to do this in an interview dedicated to Hearthstone discussions.
---
What scumbags.
---
Basically blizzard banned a guy because of the Hong Kong protests, just check hot
---
I actually really like all the new portraits :(
---
I know Valeera and Garrosh get alternate looks but. I think they look super cool. Valeera looks badass and an old god Garrosh is dope as well. Alternative, but dope.
---
Rexxar looks kinda wacky but... I still think they all look pretty cool.
---
Doesn't make the outcome any less unjust
---
Don’t. LoL is owned by tencent.
---
So wait, the casters were fired and the player ejected with no money? Just for the words they said about their country? 
---
So if it was done on a personal site like FB it would have been ok, but since it was done during a broadcast it was bad?
---
Boycotting/protesting a thing doesn't require playing 5 degrees of Kevin Bacon to find every possible connection.

The [Nirvana Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy) of believing that you need to do something **perfectly** or else you shouldn't do anything at all, is...a fallacy.  It's okay to just take some action without changing every aspect of your life.
---
Looks like no new reviews since 6 hours ago which I doubt. So either they don’t update much or blizzard sent in a call to Apple to lock there rating till all this blows over.
---
Because as we all know there's no difference between having the freedom to start a business and having the freedom to protest the government or be Uyghur.
---
Chad move
---
That should be 森777 though right? I’ve only seen 777 be used in a pogchamp way though
---
What a bunch of utter heroes. I mean retards. None of them can even read the rules of the bloody tournament, it seems.
---
blizz doesnt give a fuck if you waste your own money that you put into this game. just uninstall, doin this sends no message
---
Hah! Yeah, gotcha, gotcha. Hey I'm with ya man. I spout off nonsense when I don't understand things either.
---
I am not up to date then and I apologize.
---
Still, there didn't seem to have been such a massive backlash on Reddit against Apple when the decision was still recent. Spreading awareness about this topic is definitely a step in the right direction, but it shouldn't be baseless hate and it shouldn't be directed at Blizzard only. There are a lot more companies complying with the demands of the Chinese government, just not as blatantly as Blizzard did.
---
Oh yeah well I've spent 1,000,001 and I'm not quitting
---
Almost all of the hurt caused by this will fall on the Chinese workers. I think contacting your government will be your best shot of hurting the Chinese government in general.

Cool, see ya
---
They are excellent game devs, the game is great.  The business side is what deserves criticism.
---
I wonder if people would be this righteously indignant at Blizzard if some MAGA hat wearing chud decided to shout "build the wall, 4 more years!" in a post-game interview and got sanctioned for it.
---
The Nirvana Fallacy of believing that you need to do something perfectly or else you shouldn't do anything at all, is...a fallacy. It's okay to just take some action without changing every aspect of your life.
---
Well that's equally not okay. I just read a new thread elsewhere where at least 50 people said they changed or gave a 1* in the last hour so that's definitely fishy.
---
Keep kicking Blizzard while they're down and continue doing this. Hopefully something alot bigger happens at Blizzcon too.
---
My respect.
---
Seems like a great reason to step away for a while. Take a few days off and see if it doesn’t make your life better.

Are you kidding?

One concerns human rights on a national scale and the other is an awkward presentation of a mobile game. I wonder which one is more important?
---
Go read twitch T&amp;Cs you yoghurt.
---
Mhm while I agree this is very important I don't think this is the best solution as abuse of such a rule will likely negatively impact EU regulations in the longterm. (If the people abuse their rights they will lose their rights.) 
---
Vote with your wallet that's what really hurts.

Would America allow political threats to operate in Mexico? They have meddled with Mexico before, and you haven’t seemed to condemn the US at all. Doesn’t sound like you know how the world works. Go back to your card game
---
Your average American redditor has had 12 years of public schooling where the history lessons focused heavily on criticizing America for it's flaws (often justifiably so).  That same education might not have involved 12 *hours* putting that into historical or contemporary context by explaining the flaws of everywhere/when *else*.
---
The end result is people who can bang out a 5 paragraph essay about Jim Crow, but can't answer a multiple choice about the Great Leap Forward.

Your post was nuked, Reddit is going into protect China mode hardcore
---
Who is thus guy?
---
I just wish for boycotters to quit so I can read discussion about HS.
---
This is abusing the platform.
---
This is focing Blizzard to take a stand in political issue which they do not have to. Its essentially a terriorst attach on the competation from that dude.
---
As we can see now, Blizzard merely followed the rules, and is seen as "OMG Blizzard sided with China they so evil boycot now."
---
If he made a voice on twitter, even if its just after the match, then a warning is proberbly all there is.
---
**Esports is a sport, leave politics out of it.**
---
Also, what context? The context you were told by the mainstream media? Have you read anything from the other side?
---
i dont think that was their main point. their main purpose is probably to just ensure they can make the most money.
---
And I don't really care what you think about Nazi apologia. The point is that they don't follow their own rules and just make up shit as they go.

Others:

Insulting the casters e.g. "Garbo Casters"
---
China-related issues "Organ Harvesting" 
---
At the rate the chat is going, they're banning hundreds of accounts per minute.
---
It’s the rage flavor of the moment, tomorrow they’ll all be big mad about something else. Everyone turned into a scholar on Chinese politics overnight. 
---
Isn’t it weird how the same people who constantly post “small indie company” and bitch about have to pay money for the game are the ones who are butthurt about this now?  Almost like they’re looking for a reason to be mad at Blizzard 🤔
---
Wait, that's it? It doesn't sound like much...
---
Way to go dude. Everyone should do what they can, no matter how big or small it is.
---
But I don’t wanna play Diablo on my phone
---
Ah Blitz, don't look at it like that.
---
You had some good times with those 4 years.
---
Like, looking back on my time with WoW, YEAH, I hate MMOs now as a result of my time in that game, but you know, I had some big adventures with that.
---
I hope this guy finds something new going forward, and I hope wherever he goes he is supported by people with actual goddamn backbones towards what he is passionate towards.
---
Hmm the pic says it was added in in boomsday
---
Has this information been posted to other blizzard subreddits?
---
Your "point" is literally pointless. What is China going to do with the Treasury notes it holds?
---
It's okay I rarely do. It's annoying when Europeans are so critical of the US
---
We are working on it as fast as we can 🙏
---
weird flex
---
When you get blasted by your company, fired , fined, or anything else like that over what you say on Twitter because of something going on halfway around the world, then your speech isn’t free. It came with a price. You can be fired in most states for pretty much whatever they want, but that’s why I used the word encroach.  The Government here is China, not ours, they are silencing him through a company. Is it ok for China to tell you, that you can’t say anything about them or they’ll have the company you work for Fire you.....oh and if they do business in China right now they would.
---
  So Is an American citizen being silenced by a foreign government via the business he works for ok? And would the US back a citizen against this if they silenced the wrong person?
---
Problem being that this was an unforseen side effect of what they did. They INTENDED to squash the subject, bow to China's demands and silence those who opposed China. Bringing all the extra attention, although positive, was an accident.
---
&gt;I don't mind people not speaking out, but Zalae's response is silly. If he doesn't want to take the risk just don't say anything.
---
I mean... his intentions were pretty damn clear. He agrees the situation sucks, but don't think he can afford to go down with the ship.
---
Sure, he didn't take a stance, but he openly "didn't defend" Blizzard's action, which is basically a polite but submissive way of disagreeing.
---
Thanks for reminding me to give them 5 stars.
---
The claus very specificly mentions they are going to ban and take price money. VERY specificly. And they followed that, playing fair instead of afraid to anger people.
---
Did anyone have problems with the client bugging out after the patch? Something like this: https://imgur.com/CtjIYD2
---
I made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df8kgq/is_the_client_bugged_for_anyone_else_i_cant_play/) here asking about it, but just one person responded, so I don't think it's a widespread issue.  But I'm still curious. Probably have to reinstall the game now.
---
i cant down vote this.
---
why not?
---
I agree, it's ironic, really
---
So from very beginning, did you heard anything from Chinese people? What if we are not bot?
---
They actually told him to say lmao but hey your pissed so that’s all that matter right not looking into the facts.
---
PR 100 boys.
---
Good move, this dude needs to be protected and supported for standing up for his convictions in the face of tyranny.
---
They banned whinnie the pooh because someone used it as a caricature of the Xi jinping. Just find some goblin cards and put them next to his picture. Bam card is banned.
---
Dignity or pride. They are being earned, not protected.
---
Not yet- posted it to r/blizzard with limited traction. Feel free to crosspost!
---
I said it was pretty fucking bad, not comparable. My country has issues.  We talk about it. 
---
You have so many stuck in nationalism you're quite happy to pretend you have the greatest country on Earth, and boo to anyone suggesting otherwise.  It's fucked up.
---
Well. I really do hope its the human right thing.
---
Sometimes it does feel like that something as stupid as a mobile game is more important then human rights.
---
The original comment was deleted, can you give me the gist of what happened?
---
Cringe
---
He mentioned it on the offical stream. That's what made the punishment fit. Not whatever he said.
---
Nice gold.
---
Frankly, the thing that happens is this:
---
A political event takes over one of my primary sources of stress relief in life. One of my favorite things about Hearthstone is how relatable the experiences are. Hopping on the HS sub on any given day yields an empathic look into the ups and downs of playing the game. 
---
The recent unpleasantness is a product of mass-produced ephemeral outrage into which so many people are ecstatic to dive headlong. Why wouldn't you want to be morally righteous? And hating Blizzard right now has become the pinnacle of morale righteousness, misplaced as it may be. 
---
Forget the fact that Blizzard didn't condemn Blitz's views (they simply condemned his use of Hearthstone as his platform in line with their rules for pros), and forget the fact that Hong Kong has an incredibly complex history of oppressive overseers (from the British Empire of old, to the Chinese machine of modern day), let's just throw all context to the wind, and perhaps we can chase the intoxicating feeling of righteousness.
---
Also hearthstone just like league of legends and wow could lose their complete western playerbase and still be fine number wise
---
Im just gonna go ahead and point you to the two other replies that already got pretty thoroughly hashed out..
---
Welcome to reddit
---
Agreed, politics is involved in EVERYTHING these days, and it's awful.
---
Everything got deleted? Is there any backups?
---
Have you heard what’s going on in Hong Kong? It’s pretty huge
---
I will never play another game under the Blizzard or Activision umbrella again. Fuck China, and fuck this greedy piece of shit corporation. I'm not a huge gamer anymore, but I'm appalled by this. I always considered Blizzard to be one of the better brands out there and this is simple disgusting.
---
so you'd be in favor of things like worker coops replacing major corporations etc, but essentially keeping the system intact otherwise?
---
“All I feel is emptiness”
---
Nah, you guys aren’t overreacting or anything
---
So... You don't believe I'm being truthful (I am). And you cherry pick a few glowing articles to deflect criticism that is warranted (I could link you to a myriad of articles about the oppression of the Uyghurs), then attempt to validate your position by saying China is not as bad as Nazi Germany.
---
If you're being paid to do this, your bosses should think about reassigning you to a different position. If you're not, you might want to find a different hobby.
---
Contact blizzard and delete your account. They don’t know you uninstalled.
---
Youre only allowed to say any of this because you dont live in china and live somewhere that lets you use reddit. Unless you are forced to use a vpn which speaks for itself.
---
That's an oddly accurate analogy lmao
---
Fun fact, during martin luther kings marches i read that well over 70% of the us population in a poll said they viewed it as too aggressive.
---
Pretty funny how hindsight is 20/20 isnt it.
---
Just a thought.
---
I've played long enough to remember times when we didn't have artificial meta, bans every other set, useless gimmicks, and the game resting solely on creatures. We also didn't get our formats sabotaged, and actually had people bothering to play paper.
---
good one man. congrats in advance on losing your election or as i suspect will happen, bowing out early when your would-be constituents make it clear that they're not interested.
---
Remind me in 2 hours.
---
I just play the game? Lol
---
Blizzard made an oopsie
---
The reason that it doesn't exist is because you misspelled league.
---
It is closed though.
---
The sixth demand: Diablo 4 for PC
---
Yeah, I live in Macau, same system than HK and I go to China multiple times a month. Restriction of the Internet doesn't mean people are treated like dogs though, no even close...
---
But if they didn't make any statement either way it would just be the opinion of some hearthstone nerd alone and nothing to do with Blizzard themselves.  You've missed my point from the very beginning, which is; Blizzard should have just remained silent, if they had the focus from China would be on the guy who made the statements but now that Blizzard has thrown their opinion in the ring, they're tied to that opinion and now China WILL have a problem if Blizzard doesn't continue to silence protests against China.
---
Must have been a big oopsie then
---
so you are asking people to break the law and act like scumbags? Get a life man. I can't believe you are old enough to have worked in customer service. You are not a 13 year old kid act you're age and do something productive with your life.
---
Good for them Im glad to see that some people in Blizzard arent spineless cowards
---
I’m 90% sure this kid is twelve years old
---
Nah
---
**FUCK OFF BOOTLICKING NAZI**
---
Me too. I’m out!
---
You do realIze you said “had”. As in past tense. We also used to think the earth is flat and the earth was the center of the universe but now we know better. 
---
China is not better, China still has concentration camps for Muslims where they get sterilized, and their government controls what they can see and do. 
---
We are lucky to live in western democracy’s based on capitalism and freedom to choose, something the Chinese are not able to do and are currently fighting for in Hong Kong. This isn’t rocket science.
---
“You can act against something without sending a message.” 
---
Can you, really? I mean of course, you as a singular person sure indeed can, but is that how movements are actually made? Is that how change happens? 
---
Did Martin Luther King Jr protest against discrimination from his bedroom? Did he just say “I’m not going to buy products from discriminatory establishments,” and suddenly the Civil Rights Movement was born? 
---
No. Absolutely not. Sure, it’s annoying to see these posts and have something you enjoy overshadowed by an event barely related to Hearthstone (in terms of the game itself), but how else do you suggest these people protest? Because I can tell you one thing;
---
Movements are not created by being quiet.
---
Bro, get your facts straight. Socialism does not mean communism, and communism does not mean supporting the violation of human rights (shoot, the whole purpose of it, in general terms, was to be an equalizer and an emphasis on "community", aka, the opposite of human rights violations). Most of the major problems that people love to reference when criticizing them were because of a corrupt dictator, not the system itself. There are plenty of flourishing socialist countries today.
---
Done.
---
they totally know but you're right, it's best to make it obvious
---
It's a good time to enjoy the game. I know we like to moan about $20 cosmetics but the game is 100% free and gives you an "Overwatch" feeling with the heroes/legends.
---
I thought the social scoring wasn't introduced nationwide yet?
---
I would love to see a huge crowd of people at a Hearthstone game event, or the Cosplay event, or anything where they want to be streaming the event to the internet...
---
And have them chanting, as loud as they can, "Free Hong Kong".  How clear a message would that be?  Sure, they can cut the audio, but then their event is basically worthless.
---
And remember, you aren't trying to make them feel bad.  Making whoever is on stage feel bad changes nothing.  You must make their shareholders nervous.
---
**You make the shareholders nervous, and you will see change.**
---
god's unchained is doing it for the advertisement and is the very definition of capitalism which you are so against.
---
fuck blizzard,  they want all that china money but they want to forget about who made them rich in the first place
---
how can you prove that you had send the email? is there any regulatory email people can put in cc?
---
Let them move their whole company to China because the Chinese market is that much more important/ valuable to them and human rights and beings don't matter to them.  Blizzard for shame.
---
OK as in for freedom of speech moving on China side just make sure every esport competition they bring someone live declaring "Taiwan belongs to China", how about that? 
---
Game should be irrelevant to any political stand point. Putting aside this riot should be supported or not at all, one bunch of radicals without seeking solution but kidnapping the whole city with them, sacrificing poor people's life as their "cost" to freedom? LOL
---
I just cancelled my WoW subscription and won't play this or any other Blizzard game for the foreseeable future. What a despicable company.
---
Fucking commies
---
The punishment he got was stated in the rules
---
When the hell did you play last? Creatures are way better now than they used to be.
---
👏👏👏
---
We Taiwanese are also against Blizzard now, this is definitely a bad move from them, especially it’s Blizzard “Taiwan”. You need to know that the younger generations of Taiwan are pretty connected with HKers now.
---
how are you being selfish for not wanting to stop playing? as someone who has been playing for 4-5 years and at the same time finds blizzard's actions awful, I've invested too much time and effort in the game to bring myself to delete the app and deactivate my account. i will also continue to prepurchase expansions and adventures. im not gonna stop playing a game which I've been playing for years just because of one major incident. it's your choice and it's not selfish. the selfish people are those who try and force their opinion and choice on you.
---
cutting their income doesn't mean changing their political power
---
Exactly.  With the bucket system, your three picks should be of relatively the same power level.  This was maintained by Blizzard and wasn't exactly accurate, but now it will be three totally random cards.  The only thing tying them together will be if there is a legendary option, they all three will be legendary.
---
We may have lost the battle for Jaina's tiddies. Succubus might have fallen in battle. But we will win Justice for HK.
---
Go to the battle.net forums if you want to talk about your game(s) without politics. That's the best advice I can give you.
---
Considering the fact that on launch, the game's lore could be written on one single napkin... nearly *everything* we know about the characters or the universe at this point was added retroactively. Nothing insulting about it unless you think the game's lore was acceptable in 2016.
---
There are millions of protester, you seem to not have a great idea of the concept that people shouldnt be "guilty by accusation."
---
If the protestors were violent it would be 2 MILLION people getting beat up... oh sorry thats too many, uhh 100k? Sorry whats that? its only a handful each day?
---
Yeah thats not a adequate sample size to say the population is violent.
---
Who do you want to say something?
---
Kibler? It should have been obvious his persona is fake.
---
Kripp? He’s a big bitch. Idk what you expect him to say. What is he going to do if he gets banned from blizzard? He barely gets 1k viewers on non-hearthstone streams.
---
Blizzard have become so embroiled with appeasing shareholders they are at risk of plummeting out of relevance which ultimately will hurt their bottom line more than anything. Be good people, make good games and make money doing it? The twisted mindset that they must be a subservient underling to an immoral regime to maximise profits is a dated and dangerous stance and I hope it catches up with them.
---
Nah. Many people worked really hard to work at blizzard because of what it used to represent and stayed to hopefully make fun games and not do anything evil. People can disagree with the corporations they work for. Just look at riot employees
---
Funny, the same could be applied to the Morey/NBA situation. They made it so much worse by overreacting.
---
It’s just mob mentality, none of these people gave a damn about Hong Kong before any of this but nowadays everyone loves a reason to be self-righteously mad. They don’t know why Hong Kong is such a hot button issue in China, and they probably have never spoken to a Chinese person in their lives. They just see “China bad” on the internets and circlejerk
---
I have money on this reaching South Park tomorrow if not by next week
---
It does not have anything to do with Left vs. Right or Dem vs. Republican. The vast majority of the mainstream in media, business, and government, is consistently anti-freedom, as (hopefully) everyone can see right now.
---
How is it capitalist!??? ITS LITERALLY CALLED THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA. THERE IS NOTHING “PURE CAPITALIST” ABOUT A PARTY WHO CALLS THEMSELVES COMMUNISTS ARE YOU DENSE???? 
---
they have publicly traded stocks for extra foreign investments and money but guess who owns the businesses, social media networks, and decides what can be sold by the businesses or viewed online? The communist government. 
---
In America we can choose what to buy, what businesses can sell, and what we can see online. If you cannot tell the difference you need to get your head out of the sand.
---
A roll of the dice? Why not?
---
Yeah thats not an adequate sample size to say the population is violent.
---
Wear thematic as a badge of honor. Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!
---
And Taiwan some peace, Jesus.
---
Well Blizzard Taiwan doesn’t represent all Taiwanese people. There’s plenty of us who are against China and what Blizzard has done.
---
Since Chinese censorship is totally a thing, do they know about what happened?
---
it is sad what nerds in their underwears living in the basement do with their time.
---
https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1181775499980349442
---
Does the No-Duplicate rule apply to the random legendary from the Hex and Flex bundles?
---
Like I said, in retrospect it was foolish to think they would step up, just makes me a bit sad...
---
They are communist in name only, the government and the country operate in a capitalist economy
---
Good job OP.
---
Also, as an aside, I now see why Brode left this company.  Shit,  if I was an employee at blizzard I'd put my 2 weeks notice now and get a jump start looking for a job.  You know this is going to tank the company or ensure company layoffs are coming.
---
The major reason i started with that point is because not all people will see this the same way, also due to some bad communities I've been in I've learned to apoligise before saying anything contriversial.
---
I mean amaz never seemed like the brightest bulb, so it makes sense that he'd be a bootlicker.
---
Don’t you guys have votes?
---
Good move, well played.
---
“America is not perfect therefore it is just as bad or worse than communist China where people cannot vote for their government officials, they imprison Muslims and sterilize them, violently kill protesters in Hong Kong, and tell their population how many children they can have”. 
---
You need to examine your argument and broaden your perspective.
---
You just commenting pro China stuff everywhere or what? Sounds like a good gig
---
do you not care about the hkers?
---
I don’t think this is at all comparable to burning socks because the difference here is by playing the game you are part on an *ongoing relationship*. Hobbies change and people lose interest in things over time.. if you stop playing you’re less likely to ever drop a few bucks here or there, you’re less likely to watch hearthstone tournaments, viewership drops, player engagement drops, subsequently sponsors drop, and blizzard suffers overall as a whole
---
Additionally with things like WoW for YEARS blizzard has touted like TEN MILLION SUBSCRIBERS and other numbers to look powerful. Deleted an account actively negates that
---
My freedom of speech/moral high ground is better/higher than yours /s
---
The second a decent alternative pops up I’m there.
---
It has nothing to do with us Taiwanese. The decision was not made by us nor was it what we wanted. #FreeHongKong
---
You say 'less RNG' but just wait until you get stuck at 3 lands

seiko wasn't banned, you are misinformed about current hearthstone and american political events. You can't just allow people to walk into your country and those people that are detained are treated exceptionally well. Do those muslim reeducation camps in china teach transgender woman how to be feminine and to best achieve the identity they desire? i don't think so, but that's something ICE has done in those "mexican camps".
---
Would love to see more and more of this
---
What happened?
---
Every voice matters. Turns out that they just don't matter all that much.
---
Well goodluck because the Chinese company GAEA to start bringing their mobile games into china. Very few game developers dont have ties with china.
---
Big spender... They lost  more than that from me not playing for a day .
---
It seems the only way to use them is to set them as “Favorite” and then make entirely new decks. Any existing decks will simply not save the new portraits.

Something something small indie company
---
Might as well jump on the train and get that 1k upvotes
---
Yeah I agree with you op. This protest has turned into somewhat absolute brutality and violence. I respect people fighting for their freedom, but the things they did hardly seem " rightful" to me. Shutting down airports and subway stations didn't look right to me, throwing incendiary bombs at buildings on the streets didn't look right to me either. I have friends from hk, they either have escaped to China or other countries already. It's just a sad story.
---
 
---
I don't agree with many things China did, however, unlawful violence under the name of "against the evil/communism/dictatorship" is a big no to me too. I don't think those innocent citizens, shop owners, public transport workers etc are part of what they call "dictatorship".

Devoted, loyal Blizzard fan since 1994. You better imagine how I feel.
---
nice strawman
---
some player got banned from a tournament for talking about hong kong and whatever, and now people are apparently threatening to quit
---
which is dumb, because 99.9% won't quit, and no matter how many people quit, it won't prevent a video game company from catering to the most profitable country in the world
---
Yes, that's the point. They let the power creep sink so hard that it became Creatures: the Gathering. Hell, even UB Psychatog didn't make the game as bland and repetitive as it has been the last few years. There's probably a reason why they lost about half of their players between Innistrad and BFZ-ish.
---
Did the same to me.

Must be an influx earlier because it worked a bit a ago. My account is in the process of being deleted.

We've known green berets have been training Saudis for like a year now. The backlash against a fucking hearthstone tournament made for a bigger new cycle.

I agree that this is sickening. Americans should take responisbility for these things. Now that we've looked at that please take a read through these

* Hundreds of human rights lawyers (not even dissidents, just the LAWYERS who defended people) were snatched by gestapo all over China in what is known as the [709 Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/709_crackdown).
---
* One of those lawyers, Wang Quanzhang was [sentenced to 4.5 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/wang-quanzhang-china-sentences-human-rights-lawyer-to-four-years-in-prison) for "subversion of state power". But that's not enough. China actually [went after Wang's 6-year-old son](https://chinachange.org/2019/09/06/imprisoned-lawyer-wang-quanzhangs-six-year-old-son-once-again-forced-out-of-school/), forcing him out of his school and banning any other school from taking him in.
---
* A dissident, [Wang Bingzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Bingzhang_(dissident\)) was kidnapped by Chinese agents in Vietnam and sentenced to life in prison after a closed trial that lasted 1 day.
---
* A man wore a t-shirt with the word "Xitler" on it and [was disappeared](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/11/03/young-chinese-activist-missing-after-sharing-plan-to-wear-xitler-t-shirt-on-cpc-anniversary-report/). Eventually he was [tried for "subversion of state power" while barred from meeting with lawyers](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/15/chinese-xitler-activist-trial-subversion-lawyers-barred-seeing/)
---
* Another man, [Wang Meiyu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/death-of-chinese-activist-in-police-custody-prompts-calls-for-investigation-into-torture) hold up a placard calling for Xi’s resignation &amp; democracy. He was arrested for "picking quarrels”. He ended up dead in custody.
---
* A woman live streamed herself [splashing ink on a Xi poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sF34fJwh0). She was [disappeared](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-woman-dong-yaoqiong-disappears-spraying-ink-xi-jinping-a8455166.html). Her last social media update: "Right now there are a group of people wearing uniforms outside my door. I’ll go out after I change my clothes. I did not commit a crime. The people and groups that hurt me are the ones who are guilty". Later on there was report of her being [sent to a psychiatric hospital](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/23/chinese-protester-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-poster-sent-psychiatric-hospital-report/)
---
* After the ink-splash woman's disappearance her father made a series of broadcast to call attention to her plight. He ended up getting [taken away by the police in the middle of a live stream](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/14/police-interrupt-youtube-live-stream-father-missing-chinese-woman-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-photo/)
---
* 5 people associated with a Hong Kong bookstore that sold titles such as "Xi Jinping and His Six Women" were [disappeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances). Only one managed to escape back to HK. He held a press briefing to tell the world about his kidnapping by China. He's now in exile in Taiwan. The other 4 are still somewhere in China.

And, of course

Using minorities &amp; political prisoners as [free organ farms](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c1my5j/china_is_harvesting_organs_from_detainees_uk/). A doctor's [eye witness account](https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/chinese-dissidents-are-being-executed-for-their-organs-former-hospital-worker-says/): *'The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive. The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his two kidneys. Then the doctor ordered Zheng to remove the man’s eyeballs. Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and Zheng froze. “I can’t do it,” he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man’s eyeballs himself.'*
---
* Call for [retraction of 400 Chinese scientific papers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners) amid fears organs came from Chinese prisoners
---
* [15 Chinese studies retracted](https://www.newscientist.com/article/15-15-studies-retracted-due-to-fears-they-used-chinese-prisoners-organs/) due to fears they used Chinese prisoners' organs
---
* [Cultural genocide (and organ harvests, of course)](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/china-uyghur-muslim-rules-laws-treatment-chinese-human-rights-religion-a8534161.html). A uyghur's testimony: *"First, children were stopped from learning about the Quran, then from going to mosques. It was followed by bans on ramadan, growing beards, giving Islamic names to your baby, etc. Then our language was attacked – we didn’t get jobs if we didn’t know Mandarin. Our passports were collected, we were told to spy on each other, innocent Uyghur prisoners were killed for organ harvesting"*
---
* China is moving beyond Uyghur and cracking down on its model minority Hui Muslim. ['Afraid We Will Become The Next Xinjiang': China's Hui Muslims Face Crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763356996/afraid-we-will-become-the-next-xinjiang-chinas-hui-muslims-face-crackdown): *"The same restrictions that preceded the Xinjiang crackdown on Uighur Muslims are now appearing in Hui-dominated regions. Hui mosques have been forcibly renovated or shuttered, schools demolished, and religious community leaders imprisoned. Hui who have traveled internationally are increasingly detained or sent to reeducation facilities in Xinjiang."*

I doubt this is addressed at blizzcon.

How much money would blizzard stand to lose if they got cut out of the Chinese market? Which I think is possible given the control and censorship that the CPC is capable of to over a billion people.

**709 crackdown**
---
The 709 crackdown (Chinese: 中国709维权律师大抓捕事件; pinyin: Zhōngguó 709 wéiquán lǜshī dàzhuābǔ shìjiàn or 709案 "709 case" for short) was a nationwide crackdown on Chinese lawyers and human rights activists instigated by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping during the summer of 2015. It is known as the "709 crackdown" as it started in 9 July 2015.Wang Yaqiu of Human Rights Watch commented that "the 709 crackdown dealt a terrible blow to China’s rights-defense movement, which significantly contracted as rights lawyers were jailed, disbarred or placed under surveillance".

**Wang Bingzhang (dissident)**

Wang Bingzhang (Chinese: 王炳章; pinyin: Wáng Bǐngzhāng; born February 6, 1948 ("Yinli" / Chinese Lunar Calendar date was December 30, 1947)) is a political activist and founder of two Chinese pro-democracy movements. He is considered a political prisoner of China.

**Causeway Bay Books disappearances**
---
The Causeway Bay Books disappearances are a series of international disappearances concerning five staff members of Causeway Bay Books, a bookstore located in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Between October and December 2015, five staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to have crossed the border through legal channels.

Hi Blizzard, a storm is gathering over you.
---
Let put  politic in game. It will be fun
---
Harassing Zalae is stupid, but maintaining neutral in this case means people are ok with the situation and that's just bullshit
---
The west is doing similar things for climate change and in the past for issues like woman’s right to vote and human equality issues. The difference is the governments are not as oppressive to free speech. And not responding with as much threat of lethal force. 
---
I mean if you don’t believe the west is capable of fighting for their beliefs, just one example is the Civil WAR of America. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I respect the protestors a bunch. But this is kind of an unfair comparison.
---
Most are just talkers/supporters of the ones speaking out on this reddit but guarantee these supporters will still be playing.
---
That’s dumb
---
I can absolutely  swear without hesitation that I will never play their game again regardless of what they do from this point forward. Some things really are more important than any game could ever hope to be.   
---
They screwed themselves huge. I have ridiculous gaming habits.

and you say this without backing up your claims

for sure, legit no reason to quit unless you're delusional enough to think 5000 reddit boycotters will stop blizzard from pandering to millions of players in china

They likely won't address it officially but I'm fairly certain the gaming community will somehow.
---
[LOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)

i'm obviously not getting to you so fine. just know that all the "boycotting" here won't do shit and we need to overthrow capitalism

---
# 光復香港，時代革命.
---
Ridiculous, isn't it? Yet that was the OP's talking point, that China is basically turning into Nazi Germany, and my original response was to address that very absurdity. And my "cherry picking" of articles was to prove that very point: that every negative aspect of China, of which I never denied there are plenty, has been exaggerated and blown to completely absurd proportions. 
---
That, in addition to most people being exposed to only those negative aspects, leads to the natural conclusion that China is the epitome of evil, the bane of civilized order in this world. Sure, I only used positive articles, but all of those are legitimate: China *does* do things for minorities, the vast majority of muslims are *not* mindlessly horded into concentration camps, but in fact enjoy certain privileges just as minorities in the US do. Terrorism *is a problem,* and China is *not* special for doing what it does in an attempt to curb the problem. 
---
Also, of course the obligatory "you must be working for Chinese propaganda," because surely no sane person in their right mind could possibly come to the defense of so ruthless a regime.
---
Thats also the truth
---
Spoken  like a snot nosed title child with no principals to speak of or worry about.  As luck would have it tho, children do not make as much money as well educated informed individuals on average.

Hey did you get to see the new South Park episode? It’s called band in China.

Pretty funny.

No lie, I've been applying to work for Blizzard recently. It's been a long-time dream of mine to work for you guys. So today's events shook me to the core.
---
It makes me happy to see that people like you are at Blizzard. I hope I can stand by you guys in the future.
---
Oooo new PS4 news, I best go look that up. Thanks!

Hello Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
---
Yeah I agree
---
I used to love Blizzard, but unfortunately in the past decade they have become equivalent to what I flush down the toilet after eating lots of sushi.

The current issue is largely more important than a single video game. Up to you if you want to support the cause, nobody is forcing you.

nah, just not as delusional as you
---
i'm sure your protest will do much, they surely don't care about the billions they make from china
---
Would you quit your job if your boss made a statement or decision supporting China?
---
I disagree, the banning of hate speech can too easily be abused by the government. Just like how blizzard used vauge rules to ban blitzchung, these vauge hatespeech laws can be used to silence anyone against the government.
---
Amazing, why is there no thread on this?
---
Then they should not stand complicit with their repugnant government. It's not my fault that they are brainwashed snobs. Eat shit chinese shill.
---
Capitalism is a system that uses the free market to distribute goods. That is the primary feature of it.
---
Corporations are not a necessity if a capitalist society. Corporations are a legal entity that helps to protect the owners of businesses from legal consequences of their businesses and also protect them from taxation and their personal assets in instances of bankruptcy.
---
The two are very intertwined but they are not actually the same thing.

Thank you. The gaming community at large must stand together on this.
---
what streamers if any have come out against blizzard, any real major players like asmongold or whatever?
---
The "safest society" is one where any kind of injury can bankrupt you and mass shootings happen every other week. Sure.
---
Ultimately it's about do you want to lose your career or not. Would you quit your job if your boss said the same kind of thing, when you're relying on that money to provide for your family?
---
Not a lawyer, so I don't know. But assume you do something 'disruptive' enough that simply removing you doesn't remedy the viewing experience for everyone else, would you be liable for legal action? Like say if you went streaking or something.
---
Those kinds of people don't normally end up working for companies like Blizzard. Blizzard is a very hard job to get, people that are "comfortable" at their jobs aren't normally the kind of people that are ambitious enough to end up at Blizzard.
---
They chose not to bite the hand that feeds them.
---
and yet everyone except those in power are forced into constant labor in order to make ends meet whether they like it or not. tbh I really wish people would riot like HK about that until I'm allowed to live my life without having to slave it all away for money, but looks like that's not happening.
---
Good for those men! Fuck Blizzard, free Hong Kong!
---
Kibler is a fake?  Come on.
---
And I sincerely question how many people would quit their job if their boss did something similar.
---
Oh fuck off. Those "angsty kids" are fighting for freedom under a dictator that they've been stuck with for way too long, and the cops that you claim they are "beating" seem to be doing an awful lot more beating on the protesters than the protesters are doing to them.
---
We're not trying to generate infinite Mana here.
---
Having not played the game at all, I'm not sure, but I guess in theory it would be? Like having an Archmage Antonidos type win condition deck, that you swap with them.
---
I disagree - just because every company has inserted their version of a generic "if you do anything we deem unacceptable at any point we may do whatever we like" clause doesn't mean that an absurd enforcement of such policies should be taken in stride. Honestly consumers have been far too laissez faire in their engagement with companies that are willing to trample over their civil rights for a few extra bills of any variety, so to me the community punching back is a welcome sight.
---
Now the real test, to wait for the social firestorm to blow over and hope it wasn't another instance the public's tendency to grumble and then return to business as usual.
---
Free healthcare? Abolish student debt? Change to gun policy to actually reduce the mindblowing number of mass shootings?
---
Get that prize money one way or another.
---
I hope Blizzard changes their tone on this one.
---
They can make all the money the fucking want in china.They will never get any more of mine, or any other decent true American. Read thye front page as even the mods of this reddit are quitting over this .. 
---
Dumb ass.
---
The moral and ethical positions of the company behind the games I play is *critically* important to the game itself. Perhaps not in any particular instance, but for their endeavors over time and in a macro sense. It governs how the company operates, what they're willing to do, what they're not... what they're willing to sacrifice and what they're not. I'm not talking about politics, I'm talking about values and core beliefs. Like.... "Money is more important than the concept of freedom," as this appears to be so far... is *very* concerning, and I have to wonder how that will inevitably bleed into the game somehow.
---
Epic, for instance, has the position that they and publishers/devs (except not really, it's just them because "they" have the fortnite blood money to exert market control) are the only thing that matters, and fuck the players, they'll play what we tell them they can play, and if they don't like it, they can fuck off, we're exploiting children for money using a cleverly designed MTX storefront disguised as a colorful PG-13 video game that's almost *too* good at basically grooming children to be codependent brand slaves.
---
Turns out, this permeates every facet of the company in some shape or form, regardless of how disconnected individual in-game systems might be... Building mechanics and FPS shooting smoothness doesn't really matter when your company has created an exploitative skinner box specifically designed to target children and other vulnerable players... taking advantage of what basically amounts to an unregulated "digital casino" market because government hasn't caught up to technology.
---
It's the same with Jake Paul and how he deliberately uses what's known as "Pester Power" to get children as young as 7 to  harass their parents to buy them merch drops. Or how he uses toddlers to hock merch because he knows older people and adults have an innate psychological weakness to cute kids. On traditional media (TV, radio, etc) Pester Power is expressly illegal. But there are no such restrictions for digital entertainment such as video games and YouTube/streaming. Companies toe the line because if they're too blatant, it'll be swiftly regulated. So they've been slowly boiling the frog over the last decade and a half.
---
The fact that China doesn't have as strong of consumer protections as the US, and the fact that P2W, from a social and cultural standpoint, is perfectly acceptable and even desirable in most Eastern countries, coupled with the fact that there's just so fucking many of them... means that almost every company wants to have a foothold there. Because they can sell p2w and not face boycotts and such. It's almost (if not already) to the point where companies can basically say "Fuck literally every other country that isn't china" because the MTX is so successful there, and particularly with mobile (since console/PC gaming is socially frowned upon in many of those same places; going so far as to have a special name for their hermits--many of which I suspect are gamers--called *Hikikomori*)

There’s a thread on r/outoftheloop

Hong Kong citizens are protesting for human rights while being beaten, arrested, gassed, and killed by local authorities. A player at the end of a tournament said “Justice for Hong Kong revolution of our time”. Blizzard then took the player’s prize money, banned him for a year, and fired the two casters who happened to be on stream with him to appease the Chinese Government
---
I agree with this. So why bother hiding =)
---
Good luck man popped up in my suggested subs but can anyone fill me in on what blizzard did? I'm guessing they are siding with China over the whole HK thing
---
Now you're distracting from the point and trying to run me in circles with your failed and flawed logic. 
---
This chain has no more useful discussion in it because you are commenting out of anger instead of for the sake of discussion.
---
Goodbye.
---
It’s the manner by which it’s being sent. You can see by other comments I simply disagree that the best manner to send a message to blizzard is to go on a reddit thread about your respective game and post a screenshot of you quitting. I think that’s just people grabbing some morality points at the expense of every single conversation being political
---
If humanity doesn’t concern you, go ahead. Enjoy the game
---
You demand an answer so now plesse answer me truthfully with no dodging: Why are you still on reddit when you are aware that it is related to Tencent and do not want to support China?
---
So if the mods stepped down you think who will go and swoop in? They are keeping the sub running to show how shitty Blizzard is. Are we in the same reality because all I see on this subreddit's frontpage are thread of people criticizing Blizzard? Is that what you consider supporting? Use some logics please.
---
I mean, they're in America so that's definitely on the cards.
---
Uh, what?
---
what in the fuck are you on about?
---
Jesus fucking christ, go jump off a bridge.
---
I've spent the last 4 seasons at rank 5+ playing fun decks, so not really new to it. The meta has shifted in a bad way.
---
Can you think of a better way to word it?
---
That's a lot to take away from a 7 word question.
---
So happy to see players stand behind the HK protestors. Blizzard is trying to make a buck off of enforcing authoritarianism in the name of profits.
---
Small world. Interesting anecdote.
---
Of course it's an AU student lmao
---
What does account age have to do with this
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to see your self become the villain
---
America's market is making more billions.
---
&gt; I was just asking where they last saw their morals, so maybe I can help them look for them.
---
Not a loaded question at all lmao
---
I’m out too, since beta, every card back.  1k spent, hell I’ve never missed a tavern brawl.  It’s over.
---
I don’t think you can read or understand either, he’s free to express his views, not at that moment, that rule is not unethical as it does not hurt people both mentally and physically
---
Most unfortunate and convenient. But as mentioned, without a full identity, its basically empty words. Hope you understand. I agree with you about the part on empty threats though, which is the unfortunate truth about internet warriors.
---
Did did that for 10 social credit points and 5 classic hearthstone packs.
---
Well, I'll support HK, but I'll also play this game. Not gonna uninstall such a wonderful game because of  politics.
---
Imagine giving gold to a post that funds Tencent as a major shareholder of Reddit
---
29 and still don't know how the real world works. You'd be homeless to keep your "integrity" good call
---
in case you actually didn't know, epic games is 48% owned by tencent, a chinese mega-company that supports china.
---
Epic Games wouldn't allow that, they can't just buyout 48%. That could bankrupt them in an instant
---
thanks !
---
Sadly, EA looks to be doing fine in the stock market. Saying "remember what happened to EA" holds no value to them at all
---
Good luck bro, that's a good move
---
When the tournament rules for your online fantasy card videogame conflict with fundamental values like democracy, decency, and human rights, it is not the democracy, decency, and human rights that are wrong. It is the tournament rules.
---
Most people understand this instinctively.
---
It’s really weird how you guys keep making new arguments to get past the fact that you’re supporting Hong Kong suppression.
---
A lot of false analogies, whataboutisms, and so forth.
---
It’s a fact that you aren’t helping the situation by playing continuing to play the game. Just accept you don’t care that much and the game means more to you and move on.
---
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49979063
---
What is your opinion on that?
---
Those poor GMs are gonna have a lot of useless work.
---
&gt;Because that's how appalling Chinese censorship is, (it's where the term totalitarian aka, complete control, comes from) Not only do the remove anything they consider a 'problem' they also remove anything that witnessed said 'problem' in order to make that 'problem' appear to have never existed at all.
---
Jesus Christ, I love how everyone just chalks this up to the same things because they apparently can't think straight. Blitzchung showed up to the interview with a mask, the casters knew what his intentions were and just allowed it to happen, it's obvious from both the clip that's available and the transcript of what they're saying. So if Blizzard "concluded" that Blitzchung violated the rules, this clearly makes the casters complicit by letting it happen, they knew what was up and there's really no room to plead ignorance.
---
You know, just like people claiming that Blizzard supports human rights violation because of this. It's literally the same logic applied in both cases, but somehow it's unfair in one case and fair in the other.
---
Yuge pp

You might not be happy with where Brode's funding is coming from for his new company lol....
---
https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/7164/previous-blizzard-leadership-now-running-second-dinner-announces-30m-funding-for-a-mobile-marvel-game
---
yes, just keep accusing everyone you disagree with of being a china shill when you can't disprove their point lol, it's not like I already said that I don't agree with Blizz
---
Since you’re staying you’re really not protesting anything. No offense of course you’re free to play whatever you want. Remember though that in open society you vote with your wallet.   
---
  
---
I’m curious how many people will keep boycotting Blizzard and how many are just doing it for the memes.
---
lmao the CCP literally has bots spamming pro-mainland propaganda
---
Winnie the Pooh
---
It sucks, but good on you for doing the right thing.
---
We live in a society.
---
This is pretty much my take on this entire situation
---
Blizzard either bends to China, and has to deal with bad PR for a few weeks, OR they say fuck China, go hong kongers, and then lose the entire Chinese market forever.
---
yes, Gwent was made a standalone game
---
This is inspiring to see!
---
How do they know that they won't get fired? Seems like a very plausibile outcome after last week's events.
---
not to mention china bans Twitter and Weibo is censored. where exactly does OP think this magical place exists where he can express his support for protesters and democracy for Hong Kong?
---
I'd just like to say this isn't a political issue.  It's a human rights issue where China's government pressured Blizzard to take action against a pro player who voiced opposition to the brutalities happening in Hong Kong right now.  This isn't commy vs democracy.
---
I know it can be overwhelming and I agree people need an escape because outrage is a damn expensive emotion and sometimes you have to find a way to turn it off.
---
That said, this just happened.  It's so recent that Blizzard hasn't even responded to the backlash yet.  I sense this isn't an important issue to you and that's ok.  It is important to many people though.
---
I hope you have your controversy free place back soon, but protests are supposed to be painful and it can unfortunately effect bystanders in the process.
---
Just want you to know I wish you well and hope it doesn't effect your down time too much.
---
Imagine defending a company that enables a government actively fighting people’s basic human rights. Innocent Hong Kong are being gassed killed arrested and jailed and you’re sitting here worried about the well-being of a multi million dollar company
---
And then I win, you see all I need to do now is say I support Hong Kong and liv-
---
*Xincient one dies to pyro + not equality*
---
Oh right, we got so hung up on this Chinese bullshit we forgot there were still Russian bots around.
---
Funny seeing all these comments saying “massive respect” when none of these comments are deleting their accounts and shit. 
---
It’s like “oh wow totally respect you for quitting the game as a stance. But me? I’m not gonna do that! But you get my respect for doing it” 
---
Idk. Feels a little hypocritical for people to be commenting how much they respect his choice when they still play.
---
Zilliax is one of "good" balanced cards. There are good unbalanced cards, and there are bad balanced cards. Zilliax is both good and balanced. Like defile. Super op. Yet nobody is complaining. Cuz its barely not over the edge. Tar creeper was everywhere yet not changed im 2 years
---
not true, here is your 0.5 rmb
---
I don't know, why?
---
bye loser
---
What can the government do?
---
Video games companies don't really have much intergovernmental connections.
---
If they provided some kind of service to the government they could just cancel the whole thing.
---
If getting a bad anime adaptation is the worse they have done to the playerbase, then they seem pretty good
---
o7
---
I think it's especially sickening to see someone who's so deeply imbedded into the fiber of Hearthstone culture, and who makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year off of it, I might add, to stay silent about this. Kripp - and every other mainstream streamer - absolutely needs to speak out about this immediately or else show themselves as spineless followers to a moralless company.
---
If you DC changes like macros, interface settings, keybindings, etc aren't saved. You need to physically log out, idk why they made it that way but if you make a lot of changes to your UI/binds always logout to avoid DCing later and having to do it again.
---
Also it only takes like 5 people to report you for spamming a chat channel to have your muted, anything pro-political on WoW that is spammed (said more than once basically) in the form of a macro is a guaranteed way to get temp chat banned lol.
---
Surprised there isn't a simple explanation on dual arena. Which classes hero power do I get? My first or 2nd choice?
---
I think it's a perfectly fine way to express solidarity. But clearly you are so incensed that you can't use your favorite gayming subreddit for just 24 hours that you are \*gag\* about to puke. Really? Are you surprised people are downvoting you?
---
You are a total fuckhead.
---
Fucking planting people in the crowd lmao.
---
You picked the worst time to join.
---
You will shortly be getting some sort of internal email with velvet words about how they couldn't avoid what happened. Don't fall for it please.
---
I mean, you were trying to antagonize the mod for not leaving, while you were also here "discussing", and all I did was ask if these mods receive special treatment from blizzard that made them different from the regular commenters. Apparently that translates to anger for you. Whatever floats your boat I guess...
---
If you're not a lawyer, don't start spouting shit like you know what you're talking about.
---
Can someone please help me fill out this part or give an example:
---
&gt;*I am including the following information necessary to identify me:Enter your identification data here. **This often includes information like your name, your date of birth, your address, your email address and so on.***
---
Do I write down my own name and information, or the information from Battle.net account's name etc?
---
They're supporting Tencent by moderating on reddit in the first place. If you're outraged about them moderating now, you should have been before
---
Never thought I'd see the day where someone would defend Nitesmoke for what he did.
---
That’s what the Nazis said about the French resistance. How did that work out for them?
---
Just FYI, the DPO@blizzard.com doesn't put you in contact with their DPO right away (am a DPO myself elswhere and used their process when the GDPR came into effect). The answers will be cookie cutter telling you to use their systems.
---
Insist that their systems do not allow you to pull ALL data, since, for example, your e-mail conversation with the DPO right now is not and will not be included in the data you pull, so they are leaving out data in your request.
---
Keep insisting they give you all the data. In the end you might get the DPO and they'll say that they cannot technically provide everything (that in itself is legal, and Blizzard does have one of the better compliances with the GDPR) - but you could still go ahead and complain to the French authorities https://www.cnil.fr/en/contact-cnil
---
I do not endorse abusing the GDPR, but neither do I accept human rights violations. The GDPR is to protect people from Governments and Corporations. Guess it's as good a tool as any under the circumstances.
---
Everybody look! There are still people with a spine left!
---
If I made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year already and I realized I had a powerful voice in a matter that could potentially affect millions and be very visible worldwide? Yeah, turns out I have a basic moral compass that points towards human rights. Fuck any and all streamers that don't **very quickly resolve to push back and speak out about this egregious behavior**.
---
Yea, its totally not because Chinese overlords aren't paying Blizz to shut them up, just like the change in Art of some cards aren't also to cater to the Chinese laws, instead they just did it because "reasons" right?
---
Come on dude, you can't be THAT stupid. 
---
I know the IQ of the average Blizzdrone is around 11, but to defend something disgusting as the tyranny in China, you either gotta be COMPLETELY brainless, or someone loathsome to the very core.
---
I'm in
---
I did.  I didn't link the video because it shows some graphic stuff, but if you aren't in China the video is easily searchable.
---
You asked for my source that a cop disguised as a protester shot a kid at point blank range.
---
Could you provide your sources referencing the paid protesters, the protesters just joining because of their friends, etc?
---
Tencent owns most of reddit, and is very much pro-china, you visiting reddit is supporting said company and their agendas.
---
If everyone dropped everything even slightly related to a problem, that doesn't necessarily fix the problem, it just hides it. If every mod and user quit the sub and/or reddit, then there would be no communication about the problem and everyone would be ignorant of the goings on. Sure blizzard might lose some money off it, but likely not much because the storm would pass fairly quickly. 
---
As it's discussions like what has been happening all day that drive change. And moderators, especially fair or sympathetic  moderators, are essential to that. 
---
Generally, the one of the best ways to encat change, is from the inside. 
---
Not to mention that moderators on reddit are generally serving *the community* of the game, and not the *owners* of the game. Today has been a shining example of that in this sub. 
---
So while your question wasn't inherently wrong, it was *absolutely* accusatory. It wasn't a "hey I'm curious" kind of question, it was a "why are you still obviously siding with China" kind of question. 
---
By asking it you are forcing a hard line to be drawn, which only serves to alienate anyone less certian than you are.
---
You can ask how the rest of the mod team feels about the whole situation, or what their plans are for the future of the sub, heck even asking it to the moderators as a whole would have been less accusatory than asking a specific one why *he/she* hasn't also quit.
---
That's why people have a problem with your question.
---
&gt;Support China
---
Wait... Surely you mean Support Hong Kong.
---
Funny hearing a Trump bootlicker talk about human rights
---
They're a Nazi level dictatorship. It ain't Communism.
---
This actually clearly says “I’m not coming back to your game. Ever.”
---
Blizzard has the choice of supporting the community and losing Chinese sales, or applying Chinese authoritarianism across all their players to keep the market safe.
---
They chose the latter.
---
+1
---
Oh my poor weekends
---
Second sounds like a win to me. Appeasement doesn't work, have some responsibility.
---
&gt; Why are you still on reddit when you are aware that it is related to Tencent and do not want to support China?
---
They don't own a large enough stake yet to be legitimately concerned about; however, I'd like to think I'm a net loss for them in terms of profit.
---
&gt;So if the mods stepped down you think who will go and swoop in?
---
Well, they could disavow the actions, or they could change posting guidelines to only focus on Blizzard's anti-humanitarian actions. Neither of which would transfer ownership, but rather would be a nice alternative to pretending everything is okay.
---
&gt;Is that what you consider supporting? Use some logics [sic] please.
---
Supporting would be hosting a forum which serves as an advertisement to Blizzard's IP, which this sub does currently. With the CSS and the links everywhere, it's functionally a billboard.

Took the Hearth stone world champs prize money back and banned him from competition because he made a statement supporting Hong Kong protesters.
---
cmon blizzard..why. this is playing out like a dystopian fictional novel
---
blitzchung, i stand with you
---
For a lot of us, its supporting free speech in general. This is way beyond HK from my perspective.
---
I like how there’s not a single heterosexual, cis, white male, that you can play. Really makes me feel like all under represented groups are included. Also makes me not want to play seeing as how... well, I’ve been excluded.
---
I am making $165 an hour working from home. i was greatly surprised at the same time as my neighbour advised me she changed into averaging $ninety five however I see the way it works now. I experience masses freedom now that i'm my non-public boss. that is what I do...... HER☛ &gt;&gt;[www.m](http://www.media900.com/)[edia900.com](http://www.media900.com/)
---
Hmm I doubt that.
---
It is a term for a pimple, usually one ready to burst.
---
In actual communism people get their body turned into organs and thrown in concentration camps , In free market capitalism people get rich and have freedom
---
when I told everyone in r/gaming blizzard was going downhill and everywhere in their games was popping red flags of greed I was downvoted to hell. Now take that.
---
I support HS！Blizzard is right!
---
No, it's not the exact same thing but it is political. You let one political view through, you have to let them all. It's called a precedence iirc.
---
He could've used his own stream to push his political views onto others, which he didn't.
---
Yea. Reddit defended China when Trump defended Hong Kong- so it just goes to show it has less to do with the actual human rights violations and more to do with people needing a reason to get outraged
---
It was literal garbage
---
I don't want to pressure the pro players. I want to pressure Blizzard.
---
Is it even a choice? Blizzard can't really afford to lose China. It's 100/1000's of employees versus 3 of them that knowingly broke the rules.
---
Literally who in their right minds would watch that clip and go "oh this guy clearly speaks for Blizzard not himself"
---
That's like saying if Colin Kaepernick knelt during the anthem and the NFL didn't fire him, that the NFL clearly 100 percent supported his position. 
---
I don't think anyone would have accused Blizzard of anything if they'd just ignored it. It's the action they took - and the tweets of their Chinese division about defending the 'pride of our country' - that reveal political bias. Inaction would have been a snooze fest.
---
Hey, it's the [thing already on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df4eea/blizzard_be_like/) with the same shitty spelling error. Nice!
---
謝謝。屌你。
---
Which one is "fuck you"?
---
The sad fact is they will make boatloads more money supporting China than lose with boycotts.
---
Toast is playing other games. Brode is making a game for Netease. Who's Noodle?
---
Even if the rules said no? Even if you sign a contract specifically saying you should talk about the game you are there to play and nothing else?
---
could somebpdy copy and paste the email to the comments? im on mobile.
---
Don't you guys have organs?
---
Except they aren't quitting because of China. They're quitting because of Blizzard's decision to censor approval of human rights. Before this one player got banned, they never had a case like this.
---
They don’t need to be dicks about it. Check out how the NBA improved their stance, ended up supporting free speech by effectively [saying they can’t regulate people’s opinions](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/08/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-says-players-executives-are-free-comment-china/%3foutputType=amp)
---
So, you’d rather have blizzard employees running this sub? How do you think that would go? 
---
Ugh...
---
"Unabashed capitalism" as you say is frankly not true ("too big to fail" corporations that go bankrupt like Goldman would cease to exist in actual capitalism), we are way beyond that (you could even argue it never existed). The concept was never introduced for the elites capitalistic pricipals only apply to the Joe Bloggs. Just to clearify I absolutely agree with what you are saying.
---
It's not communist but it's far from being the most "purely capitalist". It's one of the less economically free countries on the planet. Pure capitalism would have minimal government interference with the markets, and that is not what China is. The state of China owns too many enterprises for it to be truly capitalist.
---
SPAM 🏓 THIS 🏓 PONG 🏓 TO 🏓 FREE 🏓 HONG 🏓 KONG 🏓
---
Not even authoritarianism, it is unfettered capitalism that allows companies to worship money above all else.
---
Or watch Hollywood films when they explicitly send movies to Chinese censors to ensure that their movies meet their standards. Or almost all of the products we buy that are made in China by children or criminally underpaid workers.
---
It's always easy to be morally superior when all it takes is to stop watching a twitch stream.
---
Good move bro. And good luck
---
The thing is, everyone agrees about this! He didn't respect obvious rules and he brought in a sensitive topic unrelated to the competition. Everyone agrees. It's the whole Blizzard stance which is incoherent about this.
---
For this case, it's an instaban, but for a player streamsniping in tournament they take months???
---
And again, everyone agrees that politics shouldn't come up into games, that's obvious, but two things here : if Blizzard don't want a bad reputation in China because of this, they shouldn't push pride months only in Western country (political subject too). Second thing : if the situation is so bad in Hong-Kong so that an individual feels the need to express it through this means, maybe the company should double take on this and not take a stance that is seen at "no thanks, we want China's money so please don't"
---
FREE HONG KONG.  END CHINESE OPERESSION OF HONG KONG, TAIWAN, THE UIGHURS, TIBET, AND THE ENTIRETY OF SOUTHEAST ASIA!
---
Good luck man, thanks so much for supporting Hong Kong.
---
I half agree with you. Normally I would understand this situation, for example if blizzard banned someone because they said something highly controversial even if I agreed with it. I'd say blizzard is not the government and they can decide what people say on their platform. But the Chinese government is involved in this, and they're trying to exert their influence on a country that doesn't want them. I think governments shouldn't be restricting speech, and blizzard is allowing a government to do so. That's why I think this case in particular is different.
---
Trump only cares for himself, not you, obedient imbecile
---
no actually that *is* where capitalism would go without regulations and laws.  without a doubt.
---
but i see that you are a silly person so i bid you good night.
---
Lmao
---
THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAND AGAINST ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS OF OUR TIME. STAND UP FOR HONG KONG STAND UP FOR FREEDOM.
---
They banned Hearthstone master and took his prize because he said he said in interview that he supports freedom fighters in China. They also banned casters interviewing him for no reason.
---
Meanwhile the Amazon is still on fire and Brazilians are marching against a fascist dictatorship, but ya'll wanna be armchair activists about a videogame company. 
---
First world privelage at it's finest.
---
I wasn't talking about that...
---
Have fun with the backlash and loosing more money than you spent. It's illegal.
---
Except for being the natural result of every single attempted communist state. Amazingly, when one of your core philosophies requires the disenfranchised working class to forcefully take power, then "deal with" any threats to the emergent state and follow that by just... giving up all the power they've acquired, it ain't ever going to happen!
---
Power tends to corrupt, absolute power (like who lives or dies), corrupts absolutely.
---
this takes a lot of courage! bravo!
---
Its not a more Slimy Garrosh.. 
---
Its his form from a raid where he was empowered but I can tell you don't play wow.
---
It is fear of being accused as complice of the opressor by the barbaric warmongers such as yourself, which will take any answer other than their desired thirst for hatred and agressiveness out of context.

Check your privilege.

Yeah but if you tweet something mean at him he'll respond in front of helicopters on tv calling you a low IQ loser who no one will love.
---
And yet here you are defending blizzard for bending over to them.  Very odd.
---
你们没有手机吗？
---
"shouji" specifically refers to cellphones.
---
You mean the one that just got removed from the top of /all an hour ago?
---
And the countries calling themselves democratic, like the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea, are definitely democratic
---
&gt; It's not about human rights, it's about making tournaments in the region, that's it.
---
Yeah, that's the problem.
---
&gt; Blizzard isn't a company which should say politics slogans.
---
Blizzard took a political stance when they decided to bow do the authoritarian demands of the CCP.
---
&gt; as a player, you shouldn't be a dick
---
TIL supporting human rights is being a dick.
---
&gt; UEFA rulebook is really strict. If you do something like that in football then you'll be banned and nobody would bithching about it because rules are rules. 
---
Who gives a shit? What makes the UEFA the benchmark? Are they the standard by which all morality is measured? When they ban a player for supporting human rights, I'll boycott their shit too.
---
I got banned from there so fast
---
Pretty much this.
---
Lol in what universe.  So far up your own asshole. Canada has more freedom than the US
---
I always thought you where a dirtbag, guess you have some sticks.
---
Out of all the wild problems zilliax is no where near the worst. If anything, it's just a decent but fair card by wild standard.
---
Just think of cards like 0 mana 5/5s, 4 mana 7/7, genn Baku, turn 5 snip otk etc
---
Like China cares
---
I dont play hearthstone dumbass.
---
"This clip is no longer available"
---
How the fuck are you equating capitalism with anarachy , capitalism can easily exist in a structure that respects people's rights . Govt only job should be to protect individuals from other individuals, foreign govts and protect public land and make sure we don't pollute and destroy environment , capitalism has nothing to do with anarachy like you suggest

why dont pplike this company now? just intrsted

Buy a new brain, this one is defective.
---
Isn't Hong Kong technically China. Regardless of the outcome of the protests. After the assimilation after all.
---
Much respect, good luck to you
---
they had no idea when they saw the gas mask. After the first few words they acted unprofessional and let it go on for a bit more. That was why they were fired.
---
It really doesn't.
---
Typical leftie huh,"Anything i disagree with is evil!" the proceed with name calling to try and put others down.

Then it's no longer a "free market" if you choose who can and who cannot participate in it.

I didn't edit lol
---
&gt;  fighting an empire for democracy our lack of support is hypocritical
---
That empire wanted to further tax the colonies, and the colonies didn't like it much. The empire started limiting the trade of the colonies; that was the last push needed for revolution. The colonies demanded political representation, when the empire offered just that, the colonies suddenly wanted complete independence.
---
They fought for free trade and less taxes, to simplify. Your country was founded on fighting an empire to ensure they can trade without the inconvenience of a 3rd party overlooking the deals and getting its cut.
---
That's a great quote; and I'm so fucking glad a US Senator said it.  Blizzard needs to fucking depose whoever's making these executive decisions
---
it’s insane that you consider being a literal colony run by a governor appointed by a foreign government from the other side of the world to be some kind of “freedom”
---
and you made up the rest of that shit too. DNA tests for being Muslim? wtf
---
Keep it up guys, don't take blizzards bullshit lightly
---
Nobody is denying that Blizzard hard a “right” to do it.
---
They are saying Blizzard was wrong to do it because they put profit over human rights.
---
A moron wearing a MAGA hat saying “Trump 2020” is not even close to a reasonable similarity to someone speaking in support of a population putting their lives on the line I support of freedom from an encroaching authoritarian regime.
---
It is not about bringing politics into gaming. Politics are always a part of gaming and a,ways will be a part of gaming.
---
It is about companies making ethical choices about politics.
---
And even if they had taken action, their action was retaliatory. To the extent that Blizzard acted as a mechanism of the Chinese state. Blizzard could have taken far less punitive and retaliatory actions to deal with this issue. A brief suspension and a small fine would not have outraged the public.
---
It is kind of astonishing to me that people have to explain this to you.
---
Hey N3zike, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
They didn't give a pro their prize money because the player support Hong Kong
---
I'm voting for restoring the British monarchy tbh

Turn your team name into 3 Honesty Kills which is short for 3HK (Free Hong Kong)

Can someone translate what is said for us international folk
---
[Here's something you can do](https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/take-action/stop-the-hong-kong-extradition-bill/). Amnesty International has a ready-to-go letter you can send to the government of Hong Kong. It's something.
---
Thank you
---
I really REALLY would love to see protesters at blizzcon this year. And booing on when the Diablo Immortal superduah best fan #1 very exite devs inevitably come on stage.... "You're racist against asians so we can ban you! - No... i just hate assholes, these assholes happen to be Chinese smh"
---
This incredibly dumb “this is not a political x” argument crops up every now and then, in various situations and in response to varying levels of severity. It seems to be here to stay. 
---
This idea doesn’t make sense, guys. The act of banning political discussion is *always* in and of itself a political statement. It isn’t a neutral stance like you seem to believe. There are times when you can get away with it more easily (this isn’t one of them), but it’s always hypocritical and never a stance taken in good faith.
---
I don’t know, how can I tell?
---
Ok, so what about the two commentators that got fired? They literally did nothing wrong, they were caught in the cross fire. 
---
But because China said jump, Blizzard jumped...
---
lol you expect a bunch of "f2p" who have no income and lives in the basement to do anything else other than rage post on reddit to give money? If it comes to giving money or getting off their ass they are the first to log out.
---
broken english, wanton hyperbole. nothing to see here folks.
---
What the fuck are you talking about , foreign govts trying to purposely harm citizens should stop them from participating in the free market that exists for it's citizens. That doesn't mean it's suddenly now not a free market
---
I absolutely love how literally no one brings this point up. I've been saying it in a couple of posts as well. It's still a shitty thing what happened but in the end he clearly violated the ToS and now has to suffer the consequences.
---
Chat logs, reports, your IP, whenever you log-in/out, geo-location, purchases, esport votes, fireside gathering info.
---
Same here man. But now if you're just enjoying the game(s) you're labeled as someone who's actively supporting what's going on in China. It's ridiculous. And just shows the herd mentality of reddit.
---
Btw, the NBA backtracked and now supports the Houston GM.
---
Anyone who wants to take my money and throw me in jail for not agreeing with them is a shit person.  Facts aren’t propaganda. Lying democrats are the propaganda. You’re drinking the kool aid. You are the victim. I do not feel bad for you because you are all theives trying to steal our money and freedom. Why do you want the government to control us?
---
Big sheep brain you have as well.
---
You managed to get the opposite of what I meant.
---
Yup lol. I don't really have a strong opinion about the HK vs. China thing. The problem is the fact that an American company would bend over for the political views of another country while disregarding the stance of everyone else that use their product.
---
*That's* what you're going to go with? Not only the ridiculously predictable attack-the-source ad hominem fallacy, but claiming that no one has heard of **Forbes**? Hahahahahahahaha!
---
Want to say to the mod for having the decency and courage to support human rights in Hong Kong
---
You are a real hero for speaking out loud when Blizzard won’t
---
Well yeah, and that is exactly my point, we should just enjoy our games and don't bring politics into them.
---
Big ups homie
---
Cheers, mods! I’d tip my hat if I had one.
---
If the company can be bought and sold, so too will their morals.
---
Can seccond this, amazing little gem of a game
---
bringedI totally agree with you. Blizzard certainly did behave poorly, as well as Blitzchung who bring  political discussion in a game streaming. You can stand left or right, but stop flooding this subreddit with your politics.
---
Canada would approve with their housing market
---
Right now, you're probably not missing out on much with Vermintide II, since a recent DLC kinda wrecked the game-balance and made the combat a lot less fun, but it was a left 4 dead clone that actually improved upon the formula on release.
---
Garrosh look actually the best in the game, those eyes are moving...
---
Because Hong Kong has different economic system than China, it's an autonomous city state.  
---
What you're basically doing is supporting China's authoritarianism and desire to absorbs it.  
---
Blitzchung knew fully well what he was doing, he knew he was gonna get axed from the game if he pulled this, but he did it anyway. Why?  
---
Because Hong Kong is his home. If he gets suspended from a game he can still come back some day, but if China absorbs Hong Kong, taking over its politics and economy, then it's all over for him.
---
They’ve really stuck their hand in the garbage disposal of PR this time.
---
You’re a good person. I’m sure someone wants a honorable employee like you in their company.
---
You realize you and your cult are an embarrassment to humanity, right? You are the very thing HK is fighting against?
---
#FreeHK
---
It's not about that, it's about their willingness to kowtow to foreign governments and censor players. Remember, they also fired the Taiwanese commentators for doing their jobs. That's a ridiculous overstep. They were not using HS as a political platform.
---
Consider the following:
---
The SC2 pro scene has a Ukrainian pro named WhiteRa. He's one of the nicest fellows, and frequently displays positive messages such as cleaning up parks, planting trees, and being kind to people. He's also a patriot and supports the Ukrainian military defense against Russia's illegal aggression. He's made similar comments to what Blitzchung made, but against Russia, not China. Blizzard has not censored him, they've invited him to Blizzcon (and absolutely should have him, he's a good person).
---
If this were a South Korean progamer saying something against the dictatorship in North Korea, would Blizzard bat an eye? It's quite likely many South Korean progamers have commented on North Korea and never had any repercussions.
---
Blizzard is totally fine with players criticizing dictatorships, why are they upset now? They're throwing their ethics down the toilet in favor of kowtowing to China. It's pathetic.
---
The NBA stood up and said they absolutely supported their affiliates exercising their free speech, why won't ActiBlizz show some spine?
---
&gt;Blizzard is a video game company. What obligation do they have to let people use their events as a platform for politics?
---
A moral obligation.
---
As I explained in another comment to someone who asked what's wrong with "just not wanting politics":
---
&gt;In this case, "just not wanting politics" means supporting a massive breach of human rights in Hong Kong at the hands of the Chinese Party (because if you cut off people for supporting human rights, you're indirectly supporting their breach).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;So in this case, "just not wanting politics" is extremely immoral.
---
There is a difference between cheaply made goods ,which yes is still an issue with China’s poor living wages and workload, and the many means of silencing and torture that go against basic human rights. 
---
By blizzard firing the casters and removing the player and his prize money, they have gone one step beyond companies who simply produce in China to get cheap manufacturing costs. Blizzard doing this have made a statement, that money is the only driving force behind their company, and they care more about profit margins than the very welfare of living people.
---
Shhh, they don't want to hear about that. 
---
Didn't you get the memo? It's "let's have an outrage for a week" time.
---

It’ll be over in about 2 weeks. Just like how everybody complained about that Star Wars game and everybody pretended they canceled their orders and won’t play it. Just how everybody said they were done with apex bc some executive called the playerbase brats or something. These annoying ass dweebs have no self control. That’s why all they do is play video games. And they’ll never be able to stop.
---
How many people have the HK protestors killed?  Do you know anything at all about 9/11?  Only a CCP robot would think it’s a reasonable comparison.
---
You go lose your primary source of income for a year and get back to me.
---
You put my thoughts into words, man. This sub has become an "I quit, f- Blizzard" sub. 
---
Jeez, people, quit if you want to, but don't post it here. Some of us are here to play the game and have discussions about it. Take your politics somewhere else.
---
doing nothing will just make reddit remove them as mods and close the sub due to it not being moderated.
---
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
---
How do we change our economic model to prevent this?
---
Even here blizzard has its dirty tentacles, im sure that some mods are paid by them to moderate in their favor
---
Definitely. I'm Canadian and I live near Vancouver which is the city most affected by the Chinese housing investments. It's bad. Real bad.
---
From the Chinese or Americans?
---
Wanna know why that wouldn't happen to me? Because I follow the rules that I signed up for.
---
You want to protest, go do it somewhere else, man. Please let us play the game we want to play.
---
It will probably be rotated to Wild soon, have fun with it while you can!
---
Ez, just stop playing the game and supporting Blizzard. Doesn't matter who the mods are if the sub dies.
---
Leaving Blizzard would do nothing.
---
Protesting at Blizzard and remaining there to force their fellow co-workers to take a stance and stand up *is* doing something.
---
Besides, not everyone can afford to just leave their long-standing place of employment on a whim, even if the cause is righteous. But standing up is definitely the right action.
---
I hope more Blizz devs will join in on this.
---

Imagine being part of the millions of NBA fans in China and your government decides to ban you from viewing the whole season. I know rabid fans who would be out for blood.
---
Of he had spoken out against Hong Kong and was banned would you feel the same way? Or is it only because you agree with what he says that you're outraged?
---
Well, the blizzard is really good, keeping in mind that you have a explosive in hand.
---
You are talking about a market which is regulated through social reforms - making it no longer a real free market.  
---
But yes, that's what's needed.
---
And the companies will start to think they can do anything they want. They already do (EA wink, wink)
---
It would have been more powerfull if they didn't wait till they lost. Makes me think if they would have went through with it if they won.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit, is it? I didn't say they wouldn't talk about the game instead, I said that they wouldn't think his comments bring him into public disrepute, are offensive, or are damaging to Blizzard's image.
---
Oh yeah true, Activision is famous for giving a flying fuck about the perception people have about them.
---
They can afford and will cut employees, just as they have done in the past.
---
You ever heard of [TEPPEN](https://teppenthegame.com/en)? It's like Hearthstone crossed with Magic using Capcom characters.
---
If people in the crowd smuggle in shirts supporting Hong Kong, will Blizzard never show the audience? Surely security can't kick you out for that, and if they did, the PR would ruin them.
---
We need to understand that this is far larger than we'd imagine for the first sight.
---
Imagine it like this: Blitzchung's home is in flames. He got all the way to this part of this championship and uses the opportunity to ask for some help from the outside world.
---
What Blizzard did was harsh - goes against their own policies that everyone could already see in this sub and many others - Blizzard literally denied a cry for help - and what for? money of course
---
You still don't understand what this thread and my comment is about do you? Sad.
---
Stop giving blizzard ideas on how to silence and filter us better
---
&gt; Capitalism didnt invent greed
---
Never said it did
---
&gt; What Capitalist society allows you to do is choose not to support a company like Blizzard.
---
Unfortunately, our society may not support it, but China's does.
---
&gt; Where otherwise you dont have a choice.
---
Don't pretend you know what an alternative system would allow us to support or not, and I frankly don't either. But I do know that at least some of them would be more resistant to foreign interests influencing and censoring us with money.
---
How's that Winnie the Pooh boot taste like?
---
Have you ever thought that maybe totalitarian wannabe dictators are just using “communism” as a convenient cover to justify their power grabs? And while they’re at it, why not continue the lie?
---
I did not say it’s a same level comparison. I did said it’s a comparison because any terrorism are, technically, terrorism. Only a triggered man would call someone he just met in the Internet a ccp robot.
---
He hated blizzard. You know what happened.
---
Yes
---
Humongous chode chi

That's most likely an autoban by spambot. it does so, if you just enter the forum and suddenly post a big chunk of text without typing it in.

Not sure, what you've posted, but you might try contacting support to remove that ban.

I don't see how that's relevant at all to the discussion but ok.

Ex-Blizzard employees*
---
Roughly : yes. However this statement just does not represent reality. Profit part is very real, china is known to be very open to censuring internet by banning websites outright, so if they don't play by the rules they get majorly fucked. "People" on the other hand is not, they have no influence or power to affect the course of protests in any way, whatever they might think about protests is just not going to make any difference, it's just day dreaming at best if you think blizzard can do something about hk. As I see it it's pretty simple decision : "fire 2 casters + player" or "lose china fire 50 employees".  They are private business, they don't owe anyone to be that moral lighthouse they think they should be, blizzard should only be concerned with developing high quality product and delivering it to players at a price they want to sell it.
---
This isn’t a topic really for discussion lol. If you’re not prepared to be a mod then don’t be one.
---
&gt;Hell, trump even told china he would stay quiet on Hong kong if they could help him with the upcoming election.
---
Source?
---
Awesome idea, thanks!
---
I never said I don't support what HK people want but that guy knew what will happen if he does that and if he didn't read the rules before signing contract, well thats his problem. Only people who I pity is casters, they just got unlucky.
---
There are times and places where you can express your opinions and stances, tournament broadcast is not one of them.
---
I don't care what China is doing, I know they are shit and no amount of their propaganda will change that.
---
Units. Pretty sure this operates by showing you a maximum percent of interest (100) and scaling the rest of the graph so that you can analyze the data contextually, not quantitatively.
---
Think about human rights. It is the main problem.
---
What if I haven’t played a Blizzard game in a while, what can I do to show Hong Kong support?
---
Every cancellation makes a difference, because every single one adds to the larger sum.
---
Stay safe my friend
---
I think a more grounded comparison would be the police brutality issues recently. There are many people who are perfectly fine with kapernick not having a job for his comments against police officers. Only reason people aren’t using the same standards for Daryl Morey is because the hooligans are farther from home.
---
Free speech my ass. Where were you when conservatives are getting censored by social media sites left and right. Then liberals just screech about free speech not applying to private companies.
---
Kripps twitch chat absolutely ruined yesterday . Honestly if I was kripp I wouldn't stream with people spamming that shit, or at least go sub mode :/. I couldn't stand it

---
I've been meaning to quit HS for a while now, and this issue just gave me enough reason to do it.
---
Really only counts for people they consider to be Chinese citizens
---
I see where you are coming from, and I respect your opinion, but I disagree. I'd agree if it was a standard political statement like "f*ck feminism" but this is about human rights. This goes beyond normal political statements. 
---
Just think about it. That dude got banned because he wants human rights in China. HUMAN RIGHTS. Everyone wants human rights and everyone should have them. It's not something that should be offensive to Blizzard since they themselves HAVE human rights!
---
Fighting anti-racism and women's rights is far less political Now.  In the past, when these protests occured, it was just as controversial as this action is today.  Nelson Mandella was jailed for how many years in aparthheid South Africa. He famously used rugby to make points.  Emily Pankhurst was killed in her protest.  Were those incidents not controversial ?
---
I understand that Blitzchung's message may be wrong to many people, so i have not commented on the message itself.  I'm not chinese and i don't know the solution or the best way forward for a whole country.  My own message is not that he was right or wrong, but that dissent and protest Must be allowed.  We, in the west, consider it a fundamental right, even when it's offensive and annoying.   
---
Look outside the white house, every day there will be some protest or other.  The same for london, paris, etc.  Even when it annoys us we allow it to happen, because doing so is important to us.

The state of this sub shows why politics isn't and shouldn't be allowed in gaming. Majority of people are  just doing gut reactions to something they only  know some vague things about. I wonder how many could even answer the question of what exactly is going on in hk, let alone why.
---
Most of us have spent the day reading internet outrage about China on a site partially owned by Tencent about a video game company partially owned by Tencent on devices likely manufactured in China while we sit at desks probably manufactured in China wearing clothes that were probably made in China.
---
It's an unpopular opinion right now,  but the selective outrage today is a little out of hand. And I don't blame people for that,  it's not a bad thing that we're upset about this by any stretch. It's just a little pointless unless we're all willing to change basically everything we do, which I don't really see happening.

IT'S ALL ABOUT TO PRESERVE THEIR PLAYERS ABLE TO KEEP PLAYING THE GAMES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT GET CENSURED IN CHINA !
---
BLIZZARD did what they did to keep their Chinese players with their games. It's their right !
---
How fair would it be for you if your country Censures blizzard and forbids you from playing them?
---
There is literally video evidence of the police beating down, shooting with rubber bullets, and using pepper spray and tear gas on protesters who obviously posed no threat to them.

Sure, How many of those people do you think have now gone on to actually take part in real actions that help HK? They quit HS and believe they are helping HK so they're done now. They'll just go sit on their ass playing another game doing completely fuck all.
---
HKer too! 
---
光復香港 時代革命
---
It's a divisive/controversial political statement, and as terrible as the CPC are they have 90M supporters in a market they are heavily invested in. 
---
Blitz has already stated he knew that the rule meant he'd likely wind up ending his HS career over this, but for obvious reasons deemed it necessary given the reach of the platform. They knew what they were doing had major ramifications and they did it anyway, that's what makes it so commendable and brave to me.
---
Unlike all internet quitting heroes, he has actually something to lose. Most ppl who "quit" will be back in future anyway when they will be bored, Streamers cant just go back to Blizzard and ask them to be unbanned because they wanted to please anonymes on Reddit once.
---
Yes I do blame them. They are a business and the whole object of a business is to make money and  everything else is secondary. I am fully aware of the dystopia we live in. Does that make it okay? No. Just because I understand why they did it does not make it conscionable. And every little thing people do to make a statement, even if all you can do is delete your account, is worth something. It's a drop in the bucket but enough drops...

---
Wow, Blizzard are corrupt greedy fuckers,
---
It’s a corporation, they have to focus on the money. They alienate their core base to please communists.
---
If My government censors a game then I’ll
---
Be mad at the government, not the company who got blocked.
---
And again the players can still play because of VPNs...
---
I have done my part
---
Dude even blizzard employees are protesting outside lol
---
键盘侠也就网上bb，实际连去暴雪总部抗议的勇气都没
---
Also takes away the appeal
---
An insane amount of aid was sent. Most of it was left at the ports by Puerto Rico intentionally because the mayor of San Juan and the Teamsters Union. Thank them for that one.
---
Great. Aren't you amazing, really helping Hong Kong with your reddit posting and up/down voting, good job buddy.
---
Yeah no, sit back down kid. Playing too many video games makes your head rot. "battle lines are drawn" shut the fuck up mate.
---
lol now it is blizzard that is denying basic human rights. it feels like this has become like this one game where somebody whispers a word into another persons ear and it has to be passed on whithout changing it - only that it does change everytime someone passes it on.
---
Just calling out fallacies when I hear them.
---
Pretty sure if the the entirety of North America boycotts it, yeah, they'll fucking care.   
---
While China is a huge market that Blizzard doesn;t want to piss off, the fact remains that the majority of Blizzard's profits come from outside of China.
---
走好不送
---
Then distribute them for free. We HongKongers are willing to donate, if its for spreading awareness.
---
You're part of the problem then
---
I'd guess they were just waiting for the end of the game since it was probably going to get them DQ'd.
---
Big thx to South Park for being one of the few with balls to actually stand up against China.  This is the recent episode of them calling out the communist party of China and the US businesses that bows to them --&gt; [https://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s23e02-band-in-china](https://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s23e02-band-in-china)
---
Someone suggests to go outside and stand up for what they believe vs someone who is hiding behind a computer calling them they are unproductive.. mmm,
---
No, what you want is to come off as the "cool mainlander" that listens to opinions and pretends like they want to criticize their government.
---
The truth is though is that any time someone has a valid criticism of your country's government, you back peddle and try to use circular logic.
---
First off, the report DOES NOT conclude that Uighur's aren't having the organs harvested.  It's concluding that they don't have sufficient evidence, largely because the events are more recent than the majority of their investigation and because access to the Uighur population is extremely limited.  It is also stating that it is very likely in their opinion, and in these cases that often means it is actually happening.  You really think your government is above organ harvesting on people based on religions beliefs when:  
---
Second off, the report DOES conclude that they are harvesting organs of Falun Gong, which is again mass incarceration and organ harvesting based on religious beliefs.  If you want to be like "OH well you know at least it's not muslims" Then go ahead and a moron.  That's not a plus and that's not optimism, it's stupidity and ignorance.  No one goes "at least they put a basket under their head to catch it when the guillotine falls down.  How nice of them"
---
Again, stop trying to be the "cool mainlander" that's "on your side".  Arguing pedantic things like this just prove you're a shill for the CCP still.  Whether you're a wumao that's trying to be more cunning, or you're legitimately someone that's trying to break free of the CCP's ability to control your thought, your thoughts are very much influenced and controlled by the propaganda of the CCP.  If you are genuinely trying to be free from this, I wish you luck but you're far from the right direction to accomplish this.
---
Bad ~~Chinese~~ bot
---
The company did what they did to allow you to still have the product you paid for and spend years of gameplay on it.
---
Lol VPN on China .... You clearly ignorant.
---
Something similar happened in Nazi Germany and the DDR.
---
Everybody in Nazi Germany had something to lose. So you're saying it's fine to look on because there's a price?
---
And as to people quitting, your assumptions are meaningless.
---
"Good luck, Blizzard"
---
I disagree on that one honestly, fuck Blizzard.
---
False, Blizzard outright stated their stance for anti human rights. As far as we know other companies in China are for human rights but are too scared to come out and say it.
---
Nah fuck Blizzard. I'm not comfortable directly or indirectly supporting a corporation that doesn't value human rights enough to take a stand. 
---
What you said makes zero sense, its comical. "Stop boycotting this company because other companies are also bad?" No shit? Do you have no ability to multitask? Are you incapable of recognizing several evils?
---
The Chinese market is huge for companies like Blizzard, they alone is enough leverage to force through shit like this by the CCP.
---
Garrosh is rad; I'm glad they went in a new direction. 
---
I think Gul'dan and Jaina are the best. Simple and subtle. 
---
Rexxar looks fat. 
---
^(Sad they didn't bring back the Hallow's End cardback :()
---
China bad and scary :((((( Daddy America needs to exterminate those bug people, right??? Look at yourself, eating propaganda like a good goy.
---
The NBA has just gone the same way with a team hitting back against a manager making a pro HK statement. Anything e-sports related is decades behind in terms of having their shit together, so I fully expect Blizz to pursue the money more than the ethical stance.
---
Yes. Also, downvoting game related content is hurting the players of blizzard. Not the actual company nor helping HK. What kind of protest is this?
---
yeah but why censor
---
Epic gamer moment right here!

---
Yeah going off on sentiments in the 1800s. Now let try post ww2. Yeah nah
---
I didn't say that their firing or Blitzchung's ban was fair, I just said that both things happening is the consistent course of action to take for Blizzard if the decision they make is that Blitzchung violated the rules.
---
&gt;The rule itself was vague enough to give blizzard the "sole discretion" in deciding whether there is a violation. So how is the production crew supposed to know if it is a violation?
---
Well, they signed a contract and agreed to the rules. "Ignorance" does not absolve them of "guilt".
---
It’s the most effective protest that can be done. When you finance the trip out to HK for the entire board let me know otherwise keep your smugness to yourself.
---
People are reacting like that's not all there is because well, that's not all there is. If it was just an unbiased punishment for going against the rules by politicising their broadcast, it would look a lot different. It wouldn't look like Blizzard insta-banning the player, retroactively taking his earnings to make an example, firing two casters without investigation, then going radio silent on the whole issue. This isn't them enforcing their rules fairly, this is appeasement, pure and simple.
---
Yeh look. It’s great that you think you’re coming off as something to behold. You’re not g going to find people that agree with you. You’re not teaching anyone anything. The same way you would accept a job if you’re not qualified for it, don’t accept mod if you can’t deal with the requirements. There’s no excuse for nuking posts just because there’s too much going on.
---
Yeah I’m not saying what they did was right I’m just saying that people are going to probably start adding more and more rumors. What blizzard did was wrong. I’m not saying they’re right
---
I literally lived there lol. VPNs are more common in China than anywhere else to escape the great firewall.
---
25% tax on EBITDA roughly. So very very little.
---
Ahh I see, thanks for the info!
---
When actual nazis start using the symbol too it stops being a joke
---
who doesn't know about the great political discussions in twitch chat!
---
Lier
---
That is what I mean tho. It would have been a more powerful gesture if they showed "We don't give a fuck" instead this looks more like "We already lost so might as well make a gesture".
---
Okay great, Boycott a company for censoring politics because you "support" Hong Kong, not a problem. How are you going to help Hong Kong further now? you're going to find a new game, sit on your ass and do nothing.
---
Yeah if we only make angry posts on reddit it's useless, I agree. But the idea is that if we boycott Blizzard over a very public issue, they will be forced to react in a very public manner with regards to the HK situation.
---
Blizzard has taken a bold stance as an American company willing to bend over backwards to appease an oppressive foreign government. At this point, especially with the NBA issue and the South Park episode, people are very aware of what's going on, so much so that even US legislators are commenting on the situation. If Blizzard is forced by public and financial pressure to backtrack on the way they treated Blitzchung, it'll set a huge precedent for companies that are too scared to speak up about the issues in HK. It'll show companies that they can benefit from taking a moral stance against China's oppression. Call it virtue signalling if you'd like (you'd be correct), but China can't ban every major western corporation if they want to continue to grow economically.
---
If you disagree, I'd love to hear your rationale.
---
By THAT logic, so can you, then?
---
Put up a comment with some links yourself, dude.
---
1) People absolutely cared and continue to care about Crimea.  
---
2) Crimea isn't full of people protesting the annexation.  So it's a bit more complicated.
---
Im willing to call everyone participating in current hearthstone esports a person. I don't think its likely they will stop being people to me. 
---
I also dont see how participating in a hearthstone competition would cost me my soul and dignity. Again, everyone playing hearthstone competitively isnt going to lose any respect from me just because they play hearthstone in blizzard competitions.
---
So to actually answer that part its a yes because i dont believe i would lose my soul and dignity. I would probably still be a person after it too.
---
Is your personal identity weak enough that a gaming company not letting you protest at their events is an actual issue in regards to it? I can understand why an individual that wants to protest something probably wouldnt want to be in a situation that doesnt allow them to protest but this is no reason to assume that nobody should want to be in that situation.
---
Oh i remember the good old days of trolling on discord... Best luck!
---
I really thought Blizzard might actually try to do damage control on this, but it looks like they plan to make things much worse for themselves instead.
---
Cool?
---
You can permanently delete your blizzard account anyway, it's what I did, even though I haven't played WoW in months.
---
probably not, everyone i know who actually moved elsewhere from china is pretty much of the attitude "fuck china". there's a reason they left lol

---
&gt;You’re not just reducing the reports so you can do your job

Yes, actually. That's exactly what's happening. If a thread about Paris Hilton's new dog is generating so many reports that the mod queue isn't showing the racism and bigotry in a thread about Islam, then by killing the Hilton thread, that's exactly what you're doing.
---
&gt;You’re just cutting corners

Demonstrating how you've never moderated a sub and thus, don't have a fucking clue what they're talking about.

&gt;It’s not respectable

I can see why you might.......feel that. I almost said think but that would be a lie. 
---
&gt;it’s just pathetic.

Like your ability to comprehend basic information.
---
Usually in crisis communication you wanna act soon
---
"They didn't want to talk about the issue" 
---
Yeah, no. That's not the case. Blizzard had clearly stated in their ToS that political stuff will never be tolerated, and the HK issue is a very sensitive one. The punishment was harsh, I agree, but Blizzard made the right move. Blitzchung knew about that rule, and he broke it.
---
They didn't really care when chat was spamming stuff all the time though

Socialism: "Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of productions and workers' self-management, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them. Social ownership can be public, collective or cooperative ownership, or citizen ownership of equity."
---
Communism: "Communism is the philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social class, money and the state."

Nice try, though.

yawn. Don't assume

It's their livelihood.
---
It's disappointing but completely expected. Especially since Thijs competes professionallly.

He probably has a contract with blizzard.

They just kind of smiled awkwardly and looked at each other on the clip I saw. Didn't see anything beyond that really.

Don’t go to mainland China, the whole country is in serious debt, and moving money outside China is extremely difficult.

---
Reddit gilds them for sure
---
He’s a volunteer mod on a reddit forum, what a brave soul!￼!
---
You make some valid points however not with regard to the interviewers. 
---
Again, as none of us were there this is anecdotal however the reason given for their dismissal was that they were aware in advance that he would be making a political statement and failed to take measures in advance. 
---
That’s well within a companies remit for grounds of dismissal
---
Whoops definitely not - the first one got deleted for flair and I didn’t see it get reposted.
---
And?
---
I think that was the worst and over the line. We have already accepted the censorship in their products due to China (card art, revealing clothes, Oriental themes...). They can ban the poor guy, but firing the casters for being there (maybe a "Long live to China" was expected or wtf) was too much. And now they hide like insects (removing cam from tournament or Q&amp;A from Blizzcon). Fuck China, Fuck Blizzard policy with them
---
I agree with all of that.
---
What I don't agree with is some guy saying "keep your smugness to yourself" to someone saying that maybe we should do a tiny bit more than uninstalling a video game, or that that is "the most effective protest that can be done".
---
I'm perfectly fine with the current protest, but man there are people riding this like a bitch for some free karma. The mod that quit, for instance, hasn't even posted in this sub for 3 months and was pretty much inactive already *and he is still a mod on various Hearthstone and Overwatch related subs*. One of the top comments in that thread is from someone saying they "also" quit this sub. Only that was actually the first time he ever commented in this sub in the first place.
---
For most, this is a popularity contest, plain and simple, and they put the least amount of effort into this (i.e.: Writing they just quit Hearthstone), and posts like this one get actively downvoted and mocked. Which just kind of fulfills all kinds of stereotypes about gamers, unfortunately.
---
 What? OP Gamer is evolving!
---
Wow, Gamer has turned into Human Being.
---
It will be either canceled or an insane shitshow. People have been looking for places to show their support to HKers, Blizzard just told them all where to go.
---
I would be surprised if it was contained to the Hearthstone panel
---
Every q and a Will be filled with this i think.
---
Nobody is getting banned there, they're not Chinese
---
Like EA
---
hope dies last
---
Then what about casters? what have they done to deserve this punishment? the whole situation is out of their hands
---
They most likely wanted to show it while doing the winners interview, except they didn't win so that means no interview and showed the sign right before the loss.
---
Man they must be giving you the extra-strong Kool-aid
---
bold of you to believe Chinese government will pay you more than 50 cents
---
Nice
---
Is there anything in California employment law that could make that constitute as wrongful termination?

---
It’s not going out on the other games involved with tencent because of 1 simple thing.
---
No other game are banning and destroying the live hood of HK protestors and sympathisers - Find me some other game doing it too.
---
word
---
That strawman is so big I need to take a few steps back to be able to appreciate it.
---
I'd say they already supported HK by giving the protesters this big a spotlight and telling the supporters exactly where to mount the next big protest

---
Why are you thanking people for doing the absolute base minimum of what is expected of them?
---
You don't thank random cops on the street for not arresting you, do you?
---
I do not pity you, I feel shame for you, you're just a coward. You're a hypocrite, you defend the hk protest but your idea it's to people stay inside their house doing nothing. Well let me teach you some history, again.
---
Have you ever went to a protest, like really stand and said "this is the line, from here you won't pass"?. Or your hole life you just bitch about everything on the internet?. When you go to a protest that represents your ideas, you feel the warm and company of the people that's besides you, and you share your history and they do as well. That's what you feel.
---
Most of the time, people have to break some rules to be heard, because of people like you that just say "respect the rules" the government attacks on protestors, because there's a "normal" response to the rules from some part of the society. But no from me, you may call me a teenager, you may say that I am stupid doing this, but that won't change my position because of two things: 
---
1- that's a shitty argument
---
2-This is getting bigger and bigger, probably won't continue on this subreddit, but the image of blizzard surely went really down.
---
So, go bitch somewhere else, there's no space for cowards here, and as always, history will judge you, history remembers, and you my friend make a political statement, and don't even realize
---
It is their livelihood but it’s not one that is going to be sustained if they don’t take their credibility to another game. I don’t think they realise that this is just a question of a bad extension or poorly handled nerfs, this is a question of moral integrity and once you’ve lost that you can’t get it back.
---
Besides I really don’t see Hearthstone surviving this, not anywhere near enough to sustain streamers as they have been anyway.
---
A day when Gamers become men.
---
Stop abusing streamers really, forcing this into streamers is not better than Winnie the Poh.
---
Mate if you think this post is about me seeking affirmation from others, you are wrong. It is about solidarity with those who believe is freedom of speech and expression. I hope that a corporation you may be personally invested in never fucks with you belief system or view of a just society. Best wishes.
---
12%
---
That's the percent of revenue they make from China. The US is somewhere around 30%
---
However, they have shifted gears in the last couple years towards catering to the Chinese market in effort to get more with games like Diablo Immortal.
---
This seems like a halloween themed event.. That's a pagan holiday that not everyone agrees with. Shouldn't we strip its winnings and ban it from competing?
---
Good stuff. Excellent argument, well made.

good on ya

---
Seems my 14 days banned is insignificant
---
So you have no proof.
---
The mental gymnastics some people are willing to go through here just to defend Blizzard is mind-boggeling
---
You guys are literally literally proving blizzards point, imagine if every time someone made a political statement, people going around asking solely completely unopposed uninvolved streamers to weigh in.
---
Idk man. Not everyone gets the same deals, but any moderator here on a third-party website being in touch with people from blizzard on a regular basis is a conflict not interestb imo. I wouldn't call emailing them questions or trying to set up an ama bad, but regular contact sounds like some semiofficiall capacity and it's suss to me.
---
The mods there didn't need to lock it down but they did. They always do. And then they pull some bullshit excuse like doxxing or death threats that don't actually happen and others make excuses for them. I wouldn't call them inactive at all. They're always there whenever discussion needs stifling.

Blizzard executives should be arrested for treason.

I appreciate you doing what's in your power to do, despite how small it may seem. With enough people and enough momentum, we will make Blizzard answer for their despicable behaviour.
---
Just so you know, Valve isn't safe. One pro player, and his team, was subjected to humiliation. Said player got banned on TWO big tourneys and when he and his team went to The International in China, they were booed relentlessly. It got to the point that some Chinese diehards went to their hotel and hounded them further.
---
Where was Valve when this was happening? Nowhere.
---
And there was also that time where a Liquid fan was removed from the audience, LIVE mind you, for openly supporting an NA team.
---
So yeah.
---
I just don't fucking get it.  Is Blizzard blind to public opinion?  Do they have a single PR rep?  The backlash from customers is going to hurt more than any gains they get being in China
---
Making a hard decision but the right one. Fuck Blizzard and fuck China. Freedom for Hongkong

Free arena, free arena, free arena
---
Communist scum, fuck blizzard.
---
For what it's worth, I definitely believe you, and I believe most people here who say they quit, etc.
---
I'm just puzzled by people getting angry when they're told that quitting a video game maybe isn't going to bring the revolution they're hoping for.
---
why not both?
---
Totally worth it.
---
I already unistalled all blizzard games, but seriously considering reinstalling only to do this.
---
Lol, Blizzard did right but they didn’t do good. It’s not about the fact they acted in their own interests, it’s that when they had to choose, they chose to side with the Legion.
---
We all care about Kong Kong, but we as mere peasants can’t go there and just fix it all in a clean swoop.

Blizzard's CEO just caught wing that this guy is stepping down as a Hearthstone Reddit mod...
---
We haven't heard the CEO's statement on the matter, not yet.
---
They totally need to change their policy. It was not the first time, that they handled a sensitive topic very poorly to say the least. I'm done for good, I can't stand it anymore and I won't forgive or forget.
---
&gt;`What? The point is Blizzard don't want any politics on stream. Anyone who did this would be punished.
---
Blizzard themselves came out against the abolition of net neutrality when that law was proposed in the US and mentioned it many times.
---
Clearly "no politics at all" is not the case and Blizzard has no problem taking a political stance when it doesn't upset China to do so.
---
Let me have your account.
---
Just because they are loud doesn't mean they are the majority. Or you'd be thinking Trump supporters are the majority of the country, or the entire America are gun lovers.
---
Uh, not true. You probably think Brazil's capital is Buenos Aires anyway.

If everyone that doesn't spend money on the game left what do you think would happen?

That's the core of the problem.
---
Shows me the stats game is not rigged. Since you so certain it is not. 
---
Even mighty corrupted blizzard not showing them.
---
did any? Kibler wrote he would talk about it after stream, not seen it soo far.
---
My conflict of interest lies with the wonderful people who work at Blizzard, not with the company itself and its morally corrupt leadership.
---
And how exactly do we know 'this' so far I haven't seen anything official.  All there is, is a bunch of people saying 'well I heard that they started it' with absolutely ZERO proof that this conversation took place.  Sound like Chinese propaganda rumor mill to shift the blame on to the people and away from the money.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
But I feel like it!!1!1!!!1
---
&gt; so it's not hard to imagine a portion of the Chinese viewers being upset.
---
Do the actual people of China care though?  I was always under the impression that the oppressive government (which isn't voted for by the people) is where all the censoring and anti free speech comes from, while citizens often try to bypass "the great firewall of China" to reach the rest of the internet.
---
Or, you can just abstain from doing that because the majority doesn’t care about that drama.

I would love to see that happen at Blizzcon. But yes if we want to see something actually happen we cannot let this go. We shouldn't forget that this is just 'some business thing' going on but a clear violation of basic freedoms by company that dares to suggest it upholds those.
---
Just received a response from a GM. My refund is on the way. Not sure why I was getting instant refusals, might be region, might be due to high volume.
---
How does this benefit Hong Kong again?
---
Much respect for those who have something to lose and have spoken up regardless.  In addition to Blizzard employees, I've seen posts on Twitter from at least a few prominent players, some who have gotten casting gigs or invites from Blizzard in the past.
---
you mean to tell me all of their virtue signaling is fake as fuck? shocker
---
Because in the extended clip they literally tell the dude to say the words and that they'll swtich off the stream and go under the desks. Except the stream didn't go off and it just cut to the casters trying to hide.

Since you were first out of the gate to make a claim, you have to start by showing at least a smidgen of proof that supports your claim, once you do that, the argument will begin and I can start to counter your claims. Until you do that, there is no room for argument.

I've uninstalled 1 year ago and had no regrets whatsoever.
---
Nice B/W view.
---
I don’t see anything wrong with what the OP did. He no longer supports a company that punished a player and two casters for exercising free speech and supporting HK. Here he states that he’s playing a game by a company that is publicizing their support for Blitzchung, and assumingly is against what Blizzard is doing. So now OP supports that company.
---
Just because some people don’t support HK to the magnitude that others do doesn’t make it wrong.
---
So again. Who hurt you?
---
Basically, yes. Their culture rewards winning at any cost, and doing immoral things to gain an advantage is celebrated.
---
This was very well-said. You identify the real problem.
---
And no one ever made a game called “SitInMyTentAndMockAnyoneWhoActuallyStandsForSomething-Craft”
---
I just uninstalled Hearthstone and it definitely made me feel better. I understand if people want to keep having fun in the game, but I tried to and sadly couldn't enjoy it after what Blizzard did.
---
It’s tough because we want people of character to be here. This sub was more informative about HK than all the other subs which clamped down on the narrative.
---
For China to be considered communist, there wouldn't be billionaires in the CPC who got their riches from real estate, not to mention a significant portion of formally urban land has been privatised. They've got more billionaires than any other country combined, yet with more than 30m below the poverty line, and are notoriously ineffective at redistributing wealth. 
---
But, yes, by all means, keep harping on about how China's communist. Their model's 'socialist market economy', which, in laymans terms, is capitalism with Chinese characteristics.
---
Because you got nothing since blizzard holds all the keys. You don't know shit from your balls.
---
I already have requested several times for blizzard to release their stats, they will never show because entire game is rigged you to pay. Game has patterns and not random.

Maybe, but some q&amp;a sessions also use apps which let you submit your question to a portal. If your question is selected, someone tears it on your behalf. They'd probably do something like this.

---
From my understanding, they said "say the eight words and we'll close out" or something. That being a reference to the pro-Hong Kong slogan. Assuming that's true, they specifically told him to say it, so they're inarguably accomplices. Even if not, between him obviously wearing pro-Hong Kong symbolism + them clearly ducking their heads and smirking even before he said it, they knew damn fucking well he was going to say it, and they were perfectly willing to let him on air.
---
I believe all 3 should have been punished. Not because China's great (lmfao) but because politicising a video game tournament is fucked up. For one, it's against the rules of the tournament so they should all absolutely have been punished for breaking the rules, but for two, it's just poor form. A lot of people watch gaming events/streams/playthroughs/tournaments to escape the shitty real world. A little bit of escapism, a little bit of peace of mind for once. Bringing all that shit right back in is fucked, people don't need it. We all already know it anyway.
---
I don't support Blizzard though. While I think there should be a punishment for all three people that were punished, these were **clearly** VASTLY too harsh. It wasn't about enforcing rules, it was about sending a political message, no argument there. If it was about the rules, the most I'd see is maybe a prize reduction or a forced apology or even a short ban for the player? Huge ban + full prize withdrawal? That's insane. For the casters, I think just telling them not to fuck with that stuff again behind the scenes would be fine. Maybe if you wanted to go further a public apology? That wouldn't work in this case because pro-Hong Kong is snowballing so it'd be awkward. Maybe a little fine or something, even? Pushing it. Firing them for life and fucking up years of ambition is sick. Repugnant. 
---
___
---
So yeah, I absolutely see the rationale to punish all 3 people and 110% stand behind it, I entirely support them deserving a punishment and would die on that hill. **This** punishment though, shows that Blizzard don't care about them breaking a rule, they care about using the broken rule as an excuse to attack a political movement. It's disgusting. 100% support for the people being punished but 0% support for the punishment in question, or for Blizzard.
---
They're completely going to double down on this and pretend nothing ever happened. Fucking cowards.
---
Better by 0.01% yeah. So why would you make that claim of 2.4 million homeless like it's some insane batshit crazy stats. It's pretty much on par with the US?

It also shows that China does better on that matter than the most powerful countries on EU. But I'm gonna go ahead and guess you don't like EU either, because you're true MURICAN PATRIOT.

No doubt. This is just the beginning of hopefully a unity and soon to be revolution against tyrannical actions of companies such as blizzard whom make such unethical and humanity deprived decisions. Hopefully it doesnt just end here and goes much further, but only time will tell how these events unfold.

No He’s not. He just wants to continue making money. Don’t ask him to quit his job. Be reasonable.

I suggest using twitch as a platform for our fight. This saturday, 7pm GMT, let's make streaming sessions disenchanting all our cards and explicitly say we are with Hong Kong.

Blizzard wont ban people for showing their support, this is one of their last legs and gettimg rid of more players would make it worse.

Tbh this will blow over by next week.

You know, there's a treatment for alcoholism that's similar to this. It uses a drug, disulfiram, that makes your hangover symptoms start immediately after alcohol consumption and in full force. (For those curious, it blocks the enzyme that processes acetaldehyde, the alcohol byproduct that causes hangovers) There's some controversy about the ethics of it, but basically it makes you unable to bear even thinking about drinking alcohol without getting sick.
---
Blizz may have just done this to a large portion of their playerbase inadvertently. This isn't just a raging "fuck this game" that will be forgotten in a few weeks, it's a visceral feeling of disgust. And that's far more effective a cure for addiction than anything. Aversion therapy at its finest.
---
Other than blizzard and Reddit, what other companies do I come into contact with that help fund the opposition?
---
They not gonna cancel for sure, but the people wanna enter the con will be heavily examined to prevent any shitshow. Probably still gonna be some people going trough this examination and causing some drama but they will hide it on stream and we'll only gonna hear about it trough reddit or other social medias.
---
meh, itll blow over by friday
---
I rly hope these posts will disappear soon. I was hoping to see some posts about new meta and actual gameplay. Not interested in this drama at all.
---
&gt;They already got massive consumer base and their only goal is to continue showing better $$ numbers to their shareholders. They could care less about innovating gaming and being a leader in the gaming community.

&gt;At the end of the day they just want to maxmise profits and minimize cost.

I have to wonder if Blizzard is going to have to do away with Q&amp;A sessions at Blizzcon panels. I'm not sure how wide the streaming audience for Blizzcon is.
---
Alienate Western markets in pursuit of the Chinese market? Was it actually the correct decision? Time will tell. 
---
Corporations aren't all-seeing and all-knowing, companies fail all the time. The Blizzard side of Acti-Blizz is on the decline so it is clear they've been making bad decisions, this could very well be another bad business decision. The idea that it is 100% correct to tarnish your brand image to kowtow to China is not necessarily supported by evidence - one of Blizzard's biggest assets right now is arguably their brand name and they're devaluing it substantially.
---
Its so obvious you didnt even watch the clip but are just parroting reddit.

You are such a lowlife. Suck a chinese dick.

If he had voiced his opinion about Iraq instead , he would have been banned too. I am 100% sure. It is just common sense to avoid such topics.  You just believe in what you want to be true, even though you  know I am right.
---
We as a people should absolutely care, no arguments against that. But it should be on the right platforms, and not compromising a business that randomly got picked as a platform to speak out on.
---
Quit their games. They are a business, and money is what they care about. They only care about public relations due to how it affects sales.
---
Ok look man, as a former mod, you should clearly know that no one on reddit is going to change someones mind so there isn't really any point continuing with this, it's just a waste of energy. 
---
You're on the wrong side of this, not one person other than your fellow mods circlejerking are ever going to agree with you that mods are so hard done by that they should be allowed to literally stop people from talking about this. You're not a good person. You're increidbly bad at debating something, no matter how many twitch debates you watch, clearly none of it is actually rubbing off on you. Despite you thinking you're gods gift. you're nothing and insignificant and quite clearly just a lazy fuck. Get over yourself and once again, grow up.
---
Feel free to respond to this to feel like you got the last word or that you won or something but I just can't really be bothered talking to a brick wall any longer.

As much as I think esports streams aren't the place to discuss about that issue, this is a very well written and democratic reaction to how Blizz handled the issue and what people should expect from the democracy we are defending.

---
He didn't break any rules. Bliz is referring to a rule that says that it's not allowed to harm Bliz with any actions. Blitzchung clearly supported Democracy in China with his statement, and this made the corrupt Chinese investors, that own 5% of Bliz, angry - therefore the ban.. purely because of greed and fear from the investors. In addition the casters got fired for no reason.
---
Does anyone know any high profile streams speaking out against this? The Reddit community has amazing, but having high profile streams speaking out and boycotting streaming blizzard games is what we need. 
---
Would love to see people like Thijs,  amaz, RDU, and other HS streams and even WoW streams stop streaming blizzard games. Moving to something like Magic would be amazing because it would really mean more then everyone on Reddit just calling blizzard out.

i was told that the video ur talking about happened later on in the day, but the original i mentioned still happened.

“brings [them] into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages [Blizzard’s] image.” That’s an extremely subjective rule that literally anyone could abuse. What he said wasn’t offensive to anyone except China. So logically it makes sense to come to the conclusion that Blizzard is siding with China.

You really don't understand how immature and petty you look right now, do you?

Communism is about worker control. If you replace business owners with unelected bureaucrats, you're just turning capitalism into state capitalism.

I mean, what your getting at is that leaving Hearthstone is a low impact action, but it's also low effort so no effort is being "wasted." That's why it's bizarre that this seems to be the hill that you want to die on, attacking people for leaving Hearthstone.
---
I mean, you commenting here just to shit on people is much higher effort, but also similarly low impact. Maybe some introspection would do you some good?

But how do you even know if someone is "virtue signaling?" I know that there are people who don't have any real convictions just trying to troll (take the James Gunn incident for example) but can you point to any of the current people on this sub (for instance) and say that they are not sincere?
---
I think /u/CrimsonDoom39 below said it pretty well. Usually when people start claiming "virtue signaling" it's to weaken a movement they don't agree with. I know you are trying to stay as neutral as possible (and I'm not judging) but you just gotta be more careful, lest your neutrality turns to support for something you didn't intend to support.
---
(and I'm speaking as a fan of yours - one of my favorite streamers)
---
Thank you for the comment. I feel so disappointed because to me the hearthstone community was one of the first that I was a part of that actually felt welcoming. Most games and their players are beyond toxic and cruel but hearthstone was so much about just do what makes you happy. I have read (refuse to give views to hearthstone) that popular streamers are visibly upset and can’t stream without banning viewers calling on them to act. I hope they look inward and realize why they fell in love with the game in the first place- because of fun they had playing and competing on friendly terms with other people they never met before and making friends across the world. Here’s to hoping we as players can continue to try to build communities that are inclusive and supportive of one another.
---
So, spamming a subreddit and breaking its rules can be justified and should be allowed as long as those spamming are saying the correct thing?

No, i'm not.  That isn't what i said.  I'm pointing out that shareholders Don't come first.  They are important, but they Don't come first.

I think the history of the tobacco industry is a great example of Why that is so.  I'm not accusing blizzard of hiding cancer, i'm using an example of where a company did wrong to prove that my point about society coming before shareholders is right.

His career wouldn’t just end if he stopped playing hearthstone. His following is too big at this point and if he wanted to play a different game he could and still be financially better off then most people. Sure he’ll lose some at first but when you lose part of some audience you gain from a new audience.

You're uh... a really hard person to please.

You gonna make a video on this?

The differemce in this particular case is that Blizzard would loose a ton of money by siding with HK activists instead of trying to stay neutral. For a massive corporation such as this you cant jost lock the door and say ok i am going bankrupt in support of what is happening im HK. A very fat part of their income comes from China or others affiliated to them. Commiting a financial suicide such as this would mean lost jobs, pay cuts and more of the same. If i asked you to sell your house or get a 60% pay cut or something similar in support of HL would you do it ? Personally i wouldnt because i like food and a place to sleep  i know it is a rough comparison but for them it would be as massive of a loss as i tried to picture.

This was what someone said in a previous comment thread yesterday. I don’t actually speak the language myself, so I can’t verify the authenticity.

But if it is true, then the casters were definitely “in on it” and aren’t just some innocent collateral damage
---
Let's get this comment to the top of the subreddit!  
---
Sick of all these Blizzard dick suckers and protest nay sayers claiming that our outrage and action won't change anything. Just by looking at previous gaming controversy involving Star Wars Battle Front and Loot Boxes, it should be clear that united we have a hell of a lot of power and influence!
---
I doubt that a comment worth anything even in social credits, you have no idea how many professional shill there are in China
---
Are you seriously comparing the struggle of Hongkongers to a deranged mass shooter? How out of touch can you possibly be?
---
The strategy of the CCP is to use corporate proxies to gain influence in western corporations. From there they can censor western media and buy favors from western politicians.
---
Every corporation which does business with China has been made to bend the knee. It's a form of economic imperialism with the end goal of creating a world entirely apathetic, or even supportive, towards a genocidal regime.
---
Fuck you Blizzard
---
501/500 oof
---
Doing it now might be easy because of how fresh the wound is, but we need to stay strong and away from the game when the new hype cycle rolls in. I know we can do it, we’re better than blizz. I know that we won’t choose our silly children’s card game over human rights. Unlike blizz. Fuck blizz. Boycott blizz.
---
But tbh I feel pretty bad for all the content creators, I love you Regis but I cannot support the game any longer and you’re very buddy buddy with them right now
---
Why cant a person post about hearthstone on the hearthstone subreddit?
---
I...uh...nevermind.
---
Blizzards choices in not wanting to give a platform to a political issue will not equate to an increased likelihood that they broke data protection law.  I am not in agreement with Blizzards action, just giving the objective view that the data protection authorities will need to consider, if not choose to believe. You should edit the post to state the possibilities that people might be subject to admin fees, to do otherwise is misleading people. It is obvious here that some people are using this as a tactic to disrupt Blizzard, therefore people who use the request after reading your post should not be misled to the consequences.
---
Collaborator!
---
No numbers or sources.
---
The time and place for everything argument only works if you have the privilege of not caring what happens.  The point of protest is to disrupt people’s everyday lives and force them to take notice

You have to be careful with this kind of thread.

I'm so happy I left Overwatch and Hs. Insane how greedy and filthy a company like Blizzard can be.

---
This being the link given for the translation I saw
---
I doubt it it's "necessary" at all.  This legitimately could just be the end of Blizzard-organized Hearthstone esports.  Personally I'll be ok, if so.
---
I wonder if there will be any Q&amp;A at Blizzcon. People will Talk about this
---
This is the first thing in the passed few hours that gave me hope of allowing myself to engage with your content again - thank you and good luck.
---
Sure. But by insulting you re losing reason.
---
Did you mean ? Tienanmen Square 1989 prot- \[No results found\]
---
hmm ok, still this a hearthstone sub not overwatch,plus its not like memes will get the game banned  in china aniways , still good for you for not supporting blizz.
---
I’ll keep an eye out for it. I had no patience for it in Witcher, but playing on the bus is a different story.
---
They got you, if its critique on blizzard its fine to go over 500
---
Respect man, respect
---
Yeah, a friend asked me if I was going to stop playing and I thought about it but I'm free to play, so does it even matter?
---
"Properly" doesn't equal "right".  And they can choose money over people all they want until those people start choosing something else over them.  Regardless, Blizzard is an American company and it should support American values. I suppose greed is also an American value, but.... Whatever lol.  They have already conceded so much to the Chinese market when it comes to visual censorship of their games.  The least we can hold onto are our values.  
---
Sidenote: It's funny that South Park was brave enough to take the hit but these multi billion dollar companies can't be bothered to stand for what is right.  We used to fight against communism. Now we roll over for them.
---
How tf is this nsfw 😂
---
Welcome to the club my friend. We have cookies. 
---
@sinderling this enough proof or do you want blizz to fly you out for an executive meeting?
---
And they didn't fire the commentators yet?! Blasphemy!
---
i have not seen anyone being mad at people trying to boycott blizzard but rather just have a pessimistic (possibly realistic) view
---
You're awfully trusting of the USSR and China. When they say "we represent the will of the people — we're just being *forced* to kill those same people because, uh, society," that's just the lies of autocratic oligarchs. I wouldn't point to Pinochet's Chile and go "look at how bad capitalism is" — that's only useful as an example of totalitarianism.
---
Exactly. It's still ABSOLUTELY shitty on Blizzard's part but let's stop pushing the narrative "he did nothing wrong".
---
yes that may be so but it still reflects on the company as a whole and people see only that.
---
and thats the issue thats happening right now in this sub
---
Crazy world
---
Was the first thing I thought about as well, thanks for posting OP.
---
So what did you get gold for?
---
"I told people not to give me gold."
---
At this point I don't want empty statements, give Blitzchung his tornament winnings, and hire the casters again.
---
At this point their silence is deafening and just their actions are loud enough.
---
Me too but the meta is the exact same, the only nerfs seemed like they would happen anyways.
---
Still have the dust from it
---
Agreed. I don't know if they perma banned him and I don't think they should but there should be a penalty for sure.
---
AHAHAHAHA they look so awkward
---
But foolish and naive to expect it.
---
Oh for sure, not saying he quit his day job but unless things have greatly changed, Blizz spares no expense on casting so it’s not a negligible amount
---
Right, that's the crux of it, really.
---
Meanwhile, Kibler gets to sleep easy, knowing that the FBI won't raid his home just because he tweeted "trump is a jerk lol".
---
If keeping your job means being able to survive and provide for your family then of course that's a valid reason to continue to work for them. Certain immoral acts become moral-neutral when your well being /family's well being depend on it.
---
I agree with you completely on this, if the streamer numbers were to drop suddenly in a few days, the effects could increase the strength of protests quite a lot, but not every streamer has the luxury of doing this. I just read Kibler's statement about stepping down as a caster from Grandmasters. Like he said, not everyone has this luxury sadly.
---
Question being if they still consider themselves an American company if they are punishing a guy fighting for freedom, protesting against China.
---
Rapinoe kneeled to the US Anthem more than a couple times, people hated it (a lot). FIFA hates any kinda of political manifestation on soccer games and is draconic with fines and stuff. She still is playing soccer, she still won FIFA awards, she still had her freedom of speech, even if a lot of people don't agree with her.
---
Then Blizzard, which claims to be an American Company with values, goes out trying to censor everything to defend China.
---
1st amendment and the spirit of it makes it not a big deal.
---
Now, imagine an NA player commenting on an actually hot topic, like how migrants are bad, or that migrants are treated poorly. Or imagine some player saying that the US killed 30 farmers in a drone strike. 
---
Point is, you kind of have to go beyond talking about the head of state to make an actually "politically incorrect" comment. Shit talking other countries is a good start, and you can see how someone literally said a country sucked got banned, when the context was that he meant some small fraction of people in that region suck. 
---
So, you have some examples, and they actually got a quite similar response. 
---
This is still irrelevant to the situation, and I think America and China are such different cultures in so many ways, that it's much harder to draw an equal comparison. 
---
One example I could think of is, if you're a Mexican, and someone working under you started spouting Trump's lines about your country and your people, like how there are only rapists and drug dealers, etc. You probably wouldn't want to have this guy work for you any longer.
---
He is casting in Magic now, WOTC will pick him up and he probably won't lose money. Also he is maintaining support with the popular opinion around here, so most likely people will donate to him more so
---
Welcome to authoritarian regimes
---
Naturally I was no match but this brought me much happiness amongst the turmoil now that is Blizzard.
---
Review bombing is just pathetic and useless.
---
A very level-headed statement and probably the best thing I've read about this whole cause since it happened.
---
Okay
---
Cosplay as Winnie the Pooh at Blizzcon..
---
The thing is that making a tweet about moving to Canada is very easy and it makes you feel good when everyone likes it.
---
But actually moving out of your country is difficult. So they end up not doing it.
---
As someone posted in another comment: This is the culture of "let's do next to nothing, and pretend we're a hero". 
---
People are trying to hold Thijs accountable, implying he's wrong to want to keep his fucking job... But all they are willing to do is to make an angry comment that Blizzard won't even read, or quit a game they don't even like much anymore.
---
Or both
---
According to their rules, the minimum punishment is removal from Grandmasters and removal of all earnings. The 1-year ban seems added on.
---
2019 HEARTHSTONE® GRANDMASTERS OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES v1.4   p.12, Section 6.1 (o)
---
Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image **will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies** which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
Ok bye, you leaving does nothing, except make you think that you're actually contributing to something.   When in reality, you're not.
---
Oh nice. Final Fantasy is an old favorite of mine and I put a lot of time into Record Keeper which has XIV content in it, so I'll definitely check it out.
---
Him being just one member is part of my point. He is heavily implying that he speaks for more than just one random person with that letter.
---
Like you said, you lose on gold doing the solo adventures. Personally I like the solo adventures and tavern brawls more than anything so it was worth it for ME to buy. If you dont enjoy the content, dont buy it? It's just like the last expansion with rewards. You always get a card back for completing them in both adventure and heroic. Cardbacks are kind of pointless to me.
---
Absolutely
---
is
---
There's no trading card games, but ccgs like hs yes. There's tesl, eternal, mythgard, and shadowverse. Probably some others too.
---
&gt;	Being controlled by the Chinese government is a bad business move. At some point it's going to blow up in their face
---
It isn’t, though, and that is precisely the problem we are very really facing.
---
America has 300 million people rapidly losing their disposable income; China has a billion rapidly gaining theirs.
---
The people who actually own and operate corporations are immune to the problems of nationality. They’ve purchased their way out of that food chain, and will do what is required without compunction to remain there, including revealing a complete absence of loyalty to anyone or anything.
---
Who's human rights have been stripped away though? 
---
All Blizzard did is punish someone for breaking the rules outlined by their tournament. No one had their rights stripped. Blizzard is not condoning the issues in China. They're simply not taking a stance. There's no reason for them to. It's not what they do.
---
Place and time being the broadcast. I understand that Kibler points to severity, but I kept myself to what the troll seemed to be going against.
---
The only video game I know of polish playing is CS and the fervent fanbase VP had.
---
Oh blizzard is definitely being political in this, and showing a huge favoritism towards China. There's no doubt there. I agree 1000% this makes blizzard look like hypocrites, and that them claiming this is just about "a" political stance vs the one he used is obviously horseshit.
---
But we should be clear on why we're mad. This was an incredibly inappropriate response to what was said. But it's the severity that's the issue.
---
It's just a hot topic right now and it has hearthstone scene heavily involved in it. It's only natural people will be talking about it in hearthstone streams. Let them do it, it will die down. I'd understand it if hearthstone wasn't involved in this, but it's the other way around.
---
What do you think would be a rational punishment?
---
Kazmir#1973 NA trade 80g, you go first.
---
But why won't these streamers upend their lives and careers to speak out on a political issue on the other wide of the world?!?
---
They punished someone for using their platform as a political tool. That's a reasonable thing to do. Try to pull this shit off at your job and you'll get reprimanded for sure. Their punishment was way over the top though and it's why people are pissed off. If Blizzard had slapped the guy on the wrist and said "Don't do that again or you're banned" and threw a small fine at him most people would have dismissed this as reasonable. That said the steep punishment reeks of ulterior motives instead of rule breaking and that's the problem... Which is exactly what Kibler was talking about.  Kibler had a completely reasonable take on this situation. Your own expectations is the thing that's out of line with reality.
---
I think both should be okay but whatever. People should be able to express themselves.
---
Here's the difference, in America we're free to say just about anything we want. Online, in person whatever. So kibler can rant about Trump online and that's totally fine because he's free and he should be about to say what he wants
---
Blitzchung is not free, he's oppressed by a censoring government and he used his opportunity to highlight his oppression when he had the opportunity and blizzard punished him for it
---
Do you see the difference between punishing the free person who can say what they want whenever they want vs punishing a person who only has small opportunities to express themselves?
---
He is more like r/sino
---
Yeah, I think you're right, there's no way to tell, and really no reason to try to determine such a thing. Like I said originally, I think I was probably projecting my own prior apathy onto others. I find it hard to believe people care so much and so quickly when they didn't seem to care at all before. But so what if they do, and who is anyone to judge that transformation, and how does it negatively impact the overall cause? In other words, there probably are people who aren't particularly authentic, but that's still probably better than outward apathy.
---
This is the part of this whole situation that makes me the angriest and shows how much Blizzard has been affected by the Chinese government.  As if banning the guy who said it wasn't enough, they have to literally FIRE THE GUY WHO WAS JUST THERE AND DIDN'T EVEN SAY IT just because he's associated.  This needs to change.
---
They were literally enforcing their rules. It's in their rulebook.
---
Governments can call themselves whatever they want, doesn't make it true.  The National Socialist Party sure as hell weren't socialists.
---
That’s the thing about a moral stance: if you had to take it, it wouldn’t be so moral. Yeah. Blizzard certainty is *free* to silence anti-Chinese sentiment. And it’s fans and players are free to throw a massive shitfit about working for the interests of an authoritarian genocidal regime.
---
It might feel like "something" to you, but it doesn't matter to anyone else that you gave up a hobby.
---
There are over 20 companies on that list, I understand that the NBA one is particularly tricky.
---
K
---
Deleting your account does nothing, except have a minor drop of player base.  Which they'll just chalk it up to a standard lose of players.  Then after a week or two, once the outrage settles, people will come back.
---
Exactly.. The problem is that blizzard cares way more about $ than basic human rights
---
Dreads too. Very disappointing that they won't take a principled stance on clear injustice.
---
How do I delete my Blizzard account? Although I never was a big fan of their games, but now I just don't want to have anything in common with them.
---
That’s like saying someone should leave their high paying job that has higher-ups who are POS’s for one of the countless startup businesses, ignoring the fact that their income will likely plummet which they may very well depend on to keep bills paid and food on the table.

No there is a big difference in watching a football game next to g. W. Bush and Blizz banning the dude, the first one I don't give a fuck about, the second I do care about mostly because of all the shit that china does, and that HK is the most western place in that region due to the British having that land until the 1980 or something like that
---
&gt; ThatsAdmirable
---
He's been stepping into MTG:A more and more.  Might be time for him to fully switch over.
---
Download and play, just don’t buy anything! You will make them loose money by playing and not buying anything.
---
Also the casters!
---
I hope you've contacted OSHA.
---
The issue I have with it is this:
---
The rule he broke is a rule that says:
---
"Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms."
---
The intent of the rule makes sense. If it turns out you are a rapist or say something racist on stream, or do something else that is going to damage Blizzard's brand, Blizzard can cut ties and cut you off.
---
Within context, it makes sense to have a rule like that.
---
But the issue is that it's at Blizzards SOLE discretion. And apparently Blizzards SOLE discretion is that supporting Hong Kong is damaging to Blizzards brand.
---
Kibler isn't right here. This wasn't just an issue of wrong place, wrong time. If Blitzchung had commented about Turkey killing Kurds, probably nothing would have happened.
---
Once again my country makes me proud.
---
If the people are not playing the game in protest as they say, myself included, then there's gonna be a whole lot fewer people to talk about whatever is happening in the game.
---
Ya know, Thijs had his shot, but apparently he's just not a *true* hero in this world.   /s
---
&gt;By all mean, make a post when you throw away everything Made in China you own. 
---
Can't, I avoid buying Made in China crap if I can because not only I don't wanna but stuff made by people under unbearable conditions, but most of the time is, unsurprisingly, of really poor quality 
---
The true problem is with stuff made there that pretends to be made elsewhere
---
I play Shadowverse  for more than a year now, it is uncomparably more F2P than HS and is more flavorful, I quited HS for Shadowverse last year.
---
I don't think shadowbans can be sub specific. They are always global AFAIK
---
I just did this search from tor browser (and you can thank me for filling out twelve fucking capchas), and the Great Leap Forward Blizzard Logo is indeed there!
---
Please point out. I can't find any.
---
I mean it’s still a dilemma cause if he picks any of the cards now he needs to draft accordingly after that rather than if this came out on the last few picks
---
Hey man, I’m not judging anyone who keeps playing HS. It’s a fun game and that’s a personal choice. But there IS power in collective action.
---
You did it, you defeated communism
---
One could only wish that the president of the US promising China to stay silent on Hong Kong would spark as much outrage as a video game company not letting a guy protest in their tournament.
---
This is correct. 700 gold = 7 packs is better if you don’t care for solo adventure.
---
Wardens are really big on shadowy magic that isn’t strictly ‘void’ based. If you see how she plays in the Moba by Blizzard, she’s surprisingly agile and good at going through defenses.
---
Rogues in WoW tend to either be good at fighting, poisons, or ninja shadow magics. As such, since she is by no means using “The Light”, she’s not a true ‘warrior’, and she’s still more up front than any other magic based class, Rogue is the closest in Hearthstone.
---
&gt; It's a corporation that abuses human and animal rights
---
...source?
---
Thank you for the thoughtful comment. Mind sharing a link to Trump’s post?
---
Not yet. Venezuela could use some invading though

Remember when USA decided to go in hard on the Middle East? Isis was created, multiple countries went into war and its still a mess. No one cared then, why do you care now?
---
thats not the video i saw. now im confused, cause i remember the video being on stage. i'll try to continue this later
---
I feel like 99% of these ppl here don't even really know what's going on or have any actual idea on what's happening just based on the generic comments of "freedum" and "democruhseee"
---
Literally their sources come from reddit and reddit echo chamber, which is literally strewn with hypocritical sinophobic comments (the yellow peril never really died, we just got better at weaponizing other Asians against them), and HK rioters while conveniently ignoring the other side under the assumption that they're all "brainwashed CCP shills".
---
And I say this as a Taiwanese as well
---
Who's really the brainwashed one here?
---
I mean, I quoted it directly from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is retarded \[sic\], I guess?  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist\_Party\_of\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China) 
---
Also, using retarded that way is pretty offensive.
---
You’re missing the point. China is a small percentage of HS’s revenue. The US is a massive part of their revenue. So by appealing to Chinese sentiment they turned a significant portion of their player base against them. Because most Americans innately agree with the Hong Kong protestors. We can empathize with them asking for basic human liberties that we currently enjoy. And now the American, and more general Western playerbase is pissed. That means we’re showing Blizzard that they sided with the wrong player base.
---
Wow so noble of you. Thanks for sharing /s
---
&gt; Let them do it, it will die down.

Or how about no, go somewhere else where people wanna talk about shit. Dude just wants to play a game.
---
You clearly never watched him if you don't think he never talks politics.

Meanwhile, Hearthstone is still top 10 in viewership on Twitch.  The dent is hitting Blizzard hard.

Its like waving the rebel flag, you can claim nationalism/pride all you want but what it stands for is still relevant.

There's also Gods Unchained, Company that paid the prize money to the player Blizzard banned has a beta going on now for their card game, feel free to use my beta invite key;

---
Yeah, that's true, and I know I shouldn't be prejudiced against the US for the things they've done in the past to my and many other countries, but it's difficult most of the time, especially when at the moment they have a, umm, polemic administration.
---
Finally someone providing what looks like a correct assessment of the situation. Hoping that many will read, and not jump to harsh and rushed conclusions.
---
Regarding his decision, I respect it (while not thrilled about it) but, to me, it defeats a little bit the rationale of the blog post. Blizzard's decision was based on rules breaking, not content of the political protest - as correctly stated. But making a decision based on the assumption that the severity of the punishment (which is very severe) is tied to the content of the political protest itself does not appeal to me (and, I want to be clear, my comment has nothing to do with the geopolitics reality).
---
@u/Kibler: thank you for being a well-articulated and vocal member of this community.
---
If you want to come play guild wars 2 lemme know. Tons of content available
---
Monsanto bought out the company that made agent orange and has caused tons of physical deformities
---
He mails it when he says the punishment is completely out of proportion with the supposed offence. An example is being made with the harshest possible consequences that seem to be coming from outside of blizz. This is the crux of the issue and has been from the start. Well said Kibler.
---
Thanks. Would you mind sharing a link to Thijs’s response?
---
I feel the same way, but think reading this forum is the main source of that unease! Hope everything turns out for the better though.
---
I don’t fault you for playing, blizzard picking side on this issue effects everyone who enjoys their game unfortunately. However, this discourse shouldn’t be silenced because it makes some people uncomfortable.
---
Working as ~~intended~~ commanded.
---
FTFY
---
Its not a difficult decision pretty sure those china profits are the hong kong people they so casually pissed off. They chose to bend over for profit when in reality they just fucked up and burned that profit.
---
" I leave those views at home. "
---
Must be an extremely nice position to be in
---
I really applaud you for that. If you do find something new, let me know as well. I’m looking for something as well. Maybe we can start together.
---
You know who else just quit Blizzard? Bungie. Destiny is free to play now and recently divorced of that abusive relationship.
---
New headline: BLIZZARD PAYS EMPLOYEES TO ACTIVELY SUPPRESS CRITICISM IN THEIR POLITICALLY MOTIVATED BAN OF HONG KONG PLAYER
---
Brian "Please don't call me Brian "Brian Kibler" Kibler" Kibler is great
---
Expecting a 'Blizzard Sparks WW3' headline any minute now :/
---
"They did not penalize him for his political stance"
---
bullshit, look at blizzard's response to china about the dilemma.
---
they distance themselves and bow down to kiss the feet of Xi Arthas the Pooh, willing to sacrifice anything in the name of china's money.
---
Well personally, I don't believe they will ever be sorry either. But to show they're sorry and to try and right a wrong by their audience, I wonder how far they must go.
---
Yep, and that ties back into his last paragraph. He's able to leave and have no issues with other jobs, but other players/casters can't afford to just leave.
---
You know the situation is fucked up when Democrats and Republicans are both saying "This is fucked up."
---
I don't know many good mobile card games, unfortunately, but when it comes to mobile games I usually play rhythm games or gatcha games. I'm reluctant to get into another CCG right now because of how many resources I've committed to HS, but maybe I'll get back into Duelyst or Yugioh now
---
These are understandable questions, so here's my take on each:
---
1. It's not that hard to gain a basic perspective on something -- reading a couple of articles from sources you trust shouldn't take all day. Plenty has already been written about this specific incident, in fact. Sure, it's certainly not required that every person has to know everything about every issue, but if you're going to be talking about Hearthstone it's reasonable to expect 20 minutes learning what's up with this whole Hong Kong thing.
---
2. Sure, I respect that. Some people won't be happy with it, and I respect that too. I personally prefer when creators use their platform to take a stand for what they believe in, but I understand there are reasons why someone might want to keep their content and their beliefs separate. Note that I respect an individual creator making this choice but do not respect a giant international corporation making this choice.
---
3. Sure, what if? If the piece comes out then it's out and we can discuss it then, and if the piece isn't out yet but they have told us it's coming we can wait to see what they have to say. If no piece has come out and they have given no indication that one is coming then it doesn't really matter. We can only judge somebody by what they have and haven't said, not what they might be considering saying in the future that we don't know about.
---
So, basically what I wrote. Great.
---
I dunno, I feel like there are a tonne of things the US does that cross lines. Police gunning people down, the current Kurdish situation, the destruction of relationships with the rest of the western world that has massively empowered China.
---
 Would I say they were exactly the same? No. Would I say that lines have been crossed? Yes.
---
I prioritise the game because it brings me entertainment and happiness and that is what I value the most in my life :)
---
I'd be fine with this position if Blizzard was actually enforcing a "no politics" rule for everyone - but they don't. You can go on their platforms and casually bash religious people, Orange Man, trans-exclusionary feminists, the United States, men, etc - any "acceptable targets" and get *maybe* a slap on the wrist at worst and you can *promote* all sort of political causes.
---
But one sentence about supporting Hong Kong - ban you and steal all your stuff.
---
- Roll back 90% of the punishment against Blitzchung.
---
- Institute **binding, written policies** that *Blizzard* has to follow at all times.
---
- Make the eSports **completely** apolitical
---
Free democracy isn't a "political statement", it's basic human rights
---
Kripp chat has been hilarious. He doesnt say anything, but his chat was 90% anti China memes last night.
---
Gives some indication of his views.
---
How about a warning first?
---
Yo, Captain Contrarian authoritarian over here! How’s that boot taste bro?
---
So neutral position doesn’t exist? Wanting to stay away from the conflict is not a valid position? What if I don’t care about the conflict and want to focus on the game, I’m not free to do so?
---
This summarizes the whole thing
---
Except we have examples to point at:
---
Dyrus almost neverplays league, his stream goes very well;
---
Savjz almost never plays HS, he's stream is doing great;
---
Noxious switched to mtg, doing great;
---
Sjow switched to mtg, doing great
---
and there are likely many others that i don't know of.
---
Moreover, it really comes down to moral choices.
---
Just to make an example: say you work in a hotel and the owner tells you not to rent rooms to people of color. Would you keep working there? I know i quit after they asked me to be in the front of the kitchen where client could see us in place of a brazilian because "you know, you look more like one of ours".
---
You should also leave reddit because they are censoring this story and are owned by CN.
---
Plus good luck finding a brand with a clean record in the tech industry
---
I am not chinise nor that i support them.
---
So you are saying would quit your job that you spent years to build up and which you depend on for your entire livelihood if the higher ups in your company are like that? you would risk your future and possibly the future of whoever you might be supporting (i.e parents, siblings) so as to give your public opinion and 'stand up' to this kind of injustice? You would put this over your family? please don't speak as if you have so much empathy if your empathy is selective. You might be rich and not see your job as extremely important but everyone is in a different situation and you don't know his so have some consideration instead of just typing behind your screen about how they are 'evil' for putting the futures of their loved ones first
---
So how much does China pay you to do this?
---
He didn't say it did but OK
---
He is staying quiet, although he let his chat turn into almost entirely anti China memes.
---
Liberation isn’t “political drama”
---
Ohh i dindt get that one
---
Yeah surely he will stop streaming and making money just so he can show people that he is protesting, surely he would do that, not like he has money to make and family to feed.
---
I was on the fence about playing again, but this, this is over the line. I literally can’t in good conscience open my blizzard app. It’s done - I don’t care about how good the product is, abetting that sort of censorship is not okay by any means. Too strongly, too quickly, as though they were an arm of the communist party. It’s pathetic and spineless.
---
Well said friend
---
Amaz did half-respond mid-stream and, considering he has lived in HK, it wasn't a great response.
---
https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/hearthstone-streamer-amaz-analogizes-blizzard-honk-kong-controversy-to-ramen
---
Him, Firebat and Day9 are the only people I actively follow on Twitch because of this. They are entertaining, rational and good at the games they play.
---
Or the reviews get deleted.
---
This.
---
I will put it this way: if someone Frodan's age has assets over 100k, they have enough of a safety net to have an opinion. A person of his qualifications will not go hungry even if he spoke up.
---
Same for Kibler - he does not stand to lose his house or go broke over having a stance.
---
Dude I feel your pain. I'm hoping to find something similar to take its place. Hearthstone was the perfect outlet.
---
Esports content creators don't really make royalties.
---
By streaming hearthstone and ignoring the events of the past few days those streamers are implicitly condoning blizzards actions whether they mean to or not. Sometimes politics comes to your doorstep and you are forced to pick a side. This is one of those times for hearthstone streamers.
---
The terms for that act is circumstantial at best. No way any legislation can prove that this is unfair if it's written in the companies own Terms of Use. To the naked eye this is scummy af but its blizzards rules and they control their business practices. Nothing can legally be done on this matter. Just boycott them if you think it's not the right thing to do. Also, this didnt happen in the UK, but even if it did, it wouldnt have mattered.
---
It's exactly what I'm doing. But you're making dishonest statements that is extreme in any sense that no company would partake in. Hence why I cannot fathom you have any experience on this situation because you don't seem to understand the difficulties at all that is related.
---
Well, they might've fucked up according to Blizzard. I don't think they fucked up according to common decency.
---
never forget Harambe
---
Ah thanks for the correction
---
Like it or not if you prioritize your fantasy card games in the face of this struggle, your saying a lot about your values.
---
The rule they cited wasn't about political speech.  It was a vague rule about "any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image".
---
The point is that Blizzard was forced into a position where they had to use their discretion to determine whether support for Hong Kong was "offensive".  They were provided with a yes or no question where whichever option they picked would disturb a section of their audience.
---
This is wonderful
---
What if more players decide to eat that light punishment and keep dragging politics back into the event? My impression is that they had to make it sufficiently harsh to discourage everyone else.
---
You didn't read/understand a word he said and decided to go on an epic rant against him? Seems balanced...
---
And what do you mean 'avoid as much trouble as possible'. He didn't have to say or do anything. He could just have remained silent like every other high profile in the community. He chooses to put himself out there and take a personal stance against Blizzard.
---
Overall these kinds of nutty rants are hurting the cause more than it's helping. Just make you appear like a lunatic.
---
They're pulling the same move they did with Diablo: immortal. 
---
Staying quiet and hoping it blows over.
---
Kibler is actually the first person which took an adults stance on this situation and isnt jumping into "blizz nazi china enslaving if u dont uninstall and unsub and delete blizz acc u are supporting nazis".
---
It's pretty simple to just say this will not be an accepted action going forward.
---
Well, I think many people have been put into that position, relatively speaking. Corporations have been doing awful things for generations, and often people step down to sate their own conscious or morality.
---
At the end of the day, the problem here is runaway capitalism. It's the CEOs and board of directors to ensure the shareholders get as much money as possible. But when that means compromising our moral values? What do they do when that money comes business shadow-owned by despots, or even straight from the despots pockets? The answer, clearly, is "accept the money". And I think the only cure for that is our own cultural revolution.
---
how is he not dead yet? that much rot and corruption would kill palpatine.
---
He did the Mythic Invitational at PAX East earlier this year with Day9, met them both. Both were great.
---
Anecdotal. I have nothing to give to you in writing. 
---
Community Managers get paid decently. I also know what you are talking about with
---
&gt;I personally know that the mods for a certain country's sub are supported by a local workers union because that sub is politically aligned to their interests
---
But that is beyond the scope of a video game sub, however. People do make money from subs (there is always one or other controversy there) and there are definitely political interests there, but it is a different matter entirely.
---
Honestly, I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. What I'm trying to look for is precedent. If other players have been punished in similar ways for making political statements during official events.
---
Not sure if you need a sub. Was last night so ya was really recently.
---
FFXIV is gooood.
---
I don’t have a lot of gil in my wallet but if you wind up playing and rolling somewhere on Aether I’ll bring you a care package of low level food to get started with.

yes, Supreme Leader Pooh.
---
Man ive been playing destiny since RoI and I'm in love with it, Shadowkeep has been kicking it!
---
&gt;My biggest complaint is what happened to the casters. They had no control, didn't encourage it and yet one of thems account is even banned from ow. 
---
Yea.... no. They told him to "say the line" and were giggling and laughing as he did it.  It was obvious what was happening and they absoLUTELY encouraged it and allowed it to happen.
---
He could, but I'd be surprised if he doesn't still mainly play HS. He's sensible enough to take a break from it till the heat dies down.
---
This is the sort of response needed. This is the professional sort of response I would hope to see. Calling out an understanding of Blizzard's role but at the same time, stating an inability to be part of/support the tournament. Much respect to him and any that take a stand against Blizzard's actions.
---
Hello, here from your friends over at r/Overwatch
---
I just wanted to show my support and agree to what you are saying. Luckily already tons of boycotts against buying modern warfare, might make activi$ion pull out against blizzard now we’ll see.
---
We can’t keep letting gaming companies stomp on us.
---
Fuck Blizzard, FUCK EA, and fuck Activi$ion
---
I bought both bundles. The deal is way too good to pass up tbh
---
Am I remembering wrong, or are some of these hero powers different than in the previous E.V.I.L. brawl?
---
People are deleting their accounts which not only gets rid of your cards but the purchase of all blizzard games. So they won’t be back in a month
---
I legit deleted my account and the games I bought along with it. There are other game companies out there who won’t force me to bend to an authoritarian regime that I have no loyalty to. 
---
Fuck Blizzard (supposedly an American/Californian company) and anyone else who tries to control what I can say. 
---
If you play Blizzard games, then you’re ok with other people telling you what you can/can’t say.
---
What's the deal with the empty buckets? That's the first I've seen of them.
---
while in transition, I recommend checking out The Witcher's GWENT or bit complex Elder Scrolls Legends ( I find ESL much harder than Hearthstone)
---
Support those that make the shift-don’t support those that dont. Simple.
---
Check out Overdungeon for a Slay the Spire type game. I've been playing that and I play a lot of Gems of War and Divinity Original Sin 2 with friends when I can.
---
If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.
---
光復香港，時代革命.
---
the time your played shouldn't have any bearing. But it does show how invested you are to the company.
---
You are not going to change China with boycotts but what you can do is change the behavior of US companies that do not share the same values here in America.
---
More like twisting nether on muslims
---
lol
---
They took the winnings from the tournament. The rule they cited in the official statement allows for this to happen.
---
BYE DUDE
---
By not taking a stance, you take a stance. It's that simple when you're a public figure.
---
Just joined ya.

Fuck you Blizzard.

And they moderate their facebook as they do their forums. You kinda missed the point of censorship

Tho hong kong mostly uses 電話, i cant remember anyone using 手機. Tho cantonese official name for a mobile phone is手機電話, but most hk'er are to lazy to say4 words instead of just 2 電話
---
Sorry I don't have the means to fly to Blizzard (or HK for that matter), to make a physical difference.
---
This is a matter of wallet protesting. Showing Blizzard we do in fact give a shit about the obvious kowtow to China as they suppress human rights in the most flagrant manner possible is protesting. Making tons of noise and smearing their public image is protesting. Standing in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong is protesting. Sure its a very hands off approach, and does nothing to immediately improve the quality of life to the people in Hong Kong, and it certainly isnt as significant as being there, but its a statement and it does matter, especially if the sentiment remains for a long time.
---
The principles of some people do not allow them to support companies that cover up the brutal suppression of democracy.
---
Agreed. Just don't leave those who leave out to dry when they try new games.
---
I like the nod to current events in the last option
---
“Pls, no more of any of Blizzard’s games.”
---
10/10 shitpost
---
Kibler is a pretty good guy.
---
Definitely not surprised.

---
I mean, a public statement denouncing the dude's actions or even a suspension for him and the casters for collusion would be fine. But taking the prize money and firing the casters, damn, that's a bitch move. And again companies trying to be silent and brush the issue under the rug only agitates the situation even more.
---
There was a Taiwanese user who did a full transcript of the interview, including the casters complimenting him on his mask, etc.
---
It's somewhere in these threads I think..
---
And the rule makes sense. 
---
The rule isn´t about China specifically. The rule has nothing to do with "human rights" or any bullshit that people like to spew. The rule is pretty clear: keep politics out of the competition. And the rule makes fucking sense. You wouldn´t want people to use the Grandmasters for their political agenda and turn esports into ways to push politics. *The rule is fine.*
---
I remember him when he played WoW on my server in vanilla. He always seemed to keep his cool, never saw him trolling chats or anything and he was incredibly geared.
---
These events are not genuine competitions, they are PR events, and the contracts are usually written in such a way to emphasise that.
---
That's not true at all. That's an extreme oversimplification and is not fair to the average employee of such a large company.
---
They don't seem to care much about upholding the dignity and pride of America though.
---
They chose correctly. Standing up against human rights violations is ALWAYS correct.
---
I agree and I am hoping that I will have the opportunity to start making this argument louder and more explicitly going forward. I dont want to say that capitalism is entirely bad or that we should abandon capitalism altogether, but I think we are starting to let it take control of us rather than us controlling capitalism and that concerns me very much so for the future. It feels increasingly like an addiction on a global scale.
---
I did take the statement:
---
&gt;But when I am on the desk for an official Hearthstone broadcast, I leave those views at home. Maybe I’ll make a subtle snide remark on occasion, but I know that I am representing Blizzard in addition to myself. If I were to close a show with speech about how I feel like Trump should be impeached, I wouldn’t expect to be invited back for future events.
---
And extend it to blitzchung.  And maybe you're right, it isn't what Kibler was implying, to extend his caster role representing blizzard onto a player.  And if that's the case, I was wrong and apologize.
---
I do recognize that Kibler sided with Blitzchung in the message that was conveyed.
---
Epic Games is also owned by Tencent, so I don't believe this for a damn second.
---
Brian "Milquetoast" Kibler
---
&gt; and simply finding a new one isn't a realistic option
---
More than being unrealistic, it's pretty much that finding a new job **overnight** is a pipe dream. Because that's what this angry mob is being pissed about, that there aren't more people who left Blizzard over the incident that occurred Monday.
---
You should be a comedian. I feel entertained
---
/u/kibler you just compared a totalitarian regime committing genocide on its people, to someone kneeling at a football game or backing an american political candidate. This is not a "either side is valid" situation, theyre jailing, murdering and harvesting the organs of people over there, and the more attention called to it the better.
---
Lmao r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
You enjoying that Xi jinping Chinese sausage? Is the special sauce that shoots out honey flavored?
---
Ehh, an artist can **absolutely** objectify women without the viewer. Objectification is a societal construct and it will always evolve and change as attitudes and opinions change
---
Maybe read the rest of the statement before hopping into the comment section.
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
I dont have the account. I closed it just before I got married and oppened a joint account with my wife.
---
I don't like apologists haha, especially when they're deflecting with some bs argument. If you don't want to quit don't, but trying to pretend blizz is right here is messed
---
Probably, doesn't mean it looks good on them for giggling about it rather than feigning to do anything to stop it. It's a harsh consequence that I don't agree with in the slightest but they had to know there were going to be repercussions.
---
I uninstalled too. I've been playing since the game dropped. I've been looking for a good replacement to play on mobile and desktop. Seems like gwent might be a good option (mobile version drops soon). Anyone got a list of good alternatives?
---
Thanks!
---
I don't know, just about anything would be better than nothing.
---
At this point I'm just waiting till the storm is over, give it a few days and I bet people will be back to posting normal content
---
Esport in Poland is still a brand new thing, while in US and other countries it seems to be normal. It only recently received larger exposure.
---
Dude I’m telling people to quit hearthstone.  Shit was I too subtle?
---
He's a public face for Hearthstone; because of that alone he has reasons to say SOMETHING. Have you never had a boss that did something stupid that you had to answer for?
---
Completely agree. Blitzchung broke the rules set by Blizzard - yes, but it was an act of patriotism. It wasn't a malicious attack against anyone.
---
&gt; The idea that someone is representing their organization in situations like this has some truth to it, but it's also an argument to keep people in line. I believe that platforms like this are the best way to shine light on the greater injustices in this world.
---
&gt; 
---
I don't think he was saying that *quite*. I think he was saying that Blizzard doesn't want players using their screentime during official events to make political messages, and by doing so Blitzchung did violate a rule. And that *some* punishment was warrented, but that they didn't give *some* but *a lot*.
---
And I vaguely agree with that, my issue is that the so-called "rule" Blitzchung broke wasn't "don't speak about politics" but "don't say anything that angers anybody or makes us look bad, and we'll decide if that's the case". And of course, that even if he did violate that rule that the punishment far exceeds the crime (but nobody here disagrees on that bit).
---
IMO, I think it's justifiable for organizations to either have a policy that says "We stand by whatever views our players have and support their free speech" (what the NBA does) or one that says "Absolutely no talking about politics at all or you will get punishment x". The important thing is neither of them allows for selective enforcement. Meanwhile, Blizzard's rule goes beyond plausible deniability and outright says they can selectively enforce it ("at [their] sole discretion").
---
Now even in the latter case I do think it's still *ethically* fine for players to use the platform as speech to voice their political issues. I will even suggest it in the case of Hong Kong. They'll get a moderate punishment for it, and it will make the news.
---
how though? they would get attacked either way. blizzard cannot win in this situation no matter what they do.
---
HAHAHA, you're actually bringing up the waste of your taxpayer dollars that are the "impeachment proceedings" as a serious example. Shows how up to date and informed you are about current events. God I can't wait for Trump's second term, you're doing such an amazing job campaigning for it.
---
I like Eternal.
---
The rule is incredibly vague.
---
Anyone who competes in/wins in Blizzards tournaments should remain completely silent during and after, don't give them anything to work with - deadpan, a form of malicious compliance. Can't steal back my prize if I don't break the rules.
---
Yeah like that guy gets invited to parties.
---
then you do you. Let us make a difference the only way we can as lowly peasants.
---
i know when you flunked out of college daddy gave you a nice job so you arent a total failure but some of us were smart enough to finish.
---
bye!
---
Its just the hive being hit it'll calm down.
---
&gt; prostates itself to China (Diablo Immortal, China exclusive card backs, recent artwork changes) and that already laid some foundation to criticism.
---
It's kind of funny how people have this anti-Chinese market attitude, even aside from the HK situation.
---
If it was Kazakhstan who had a 400 million+ emerging middle class with money to spend, most businesses would be kowtowing to Kazakhstan. That figure, 400,000,000 is more than the US population, and it includes ONLY people/households with disposable income.
---
I'm just saying if ANY country suddenly (in the last 20 or so years) had an emerging middle class of 400,000,000 people with money to spend you bet your ass most large corporate interests want to get a piece of that pie.
---
Heck, local fisheries in my area are now diverting huge amounts of lobster, scallops, and most other sea foods to China to appease a market that didn't exist 10 years ago.
---
I know the South Park meme references are great an all, but any company would do this for/with ANY country with that much disposable income up for grabs. It has nothing to do with China in and of itself...it's pure economics. 
---
We just find it unpalatable because they're shitty on human rights and a communist state.
---
This can be big , especially if this "shit" hits the EU parliament , it can get real big  , because if there's one thing those guys hate more than each other is China
---
Yeah, I'm not surprised by the ban, but withholding his prize money and *especially* firing the casters is way, *way* too far. If they'd stopped at just banning him for a year I would have been miffed but understood, but I'm not going to support a company that is this fucking draconian and petty.
---
Arguing with a nearly instantly banned series of cards from the first sets that weren't even meant to be competitive is a pretty weak argument. What's next, you gonna tell me channel fireball existed for like 6 months in 1994 and that means everything now is great?
---
try settings-&gt; game settings -&gt; additional commandline arguments -&gt; 
---
-force-d3d9  
---
maybe launch click 32bit too
---
I think it would be quite vocal but not as large in numbers.  Unless you count bots.
---
But I guess we will have to agree to disagree
---
So what is the reason I'd it is so obvious? If they so *obviously* investigated and reached such *obvious* conclusions, what was the reasoning then?  What can you come up with that would validate this reaction?
---
The only thing I can see is that they wanted to send a very clear message. That message is that speaking out against China is not tolerated.
---
When noxious quit hearthstone he went from 5000 to 300 viewers on his stream overnight. It took years and years and magic the gathering arena finally coming out for him to get back into the thousands again.
---
That was the interview. Blitz didn't say anything before or after, if they started an actual interview with him I'm pretty sure all he would have said is those words.
---
Exactly. I'm happy theres still some people thinking clearly here.
---
That's perfectly fine, and it's your right. You just don't have to be a customer for that. Anyone can support or not support him.
---
The word itself is stupid in this context because, again, a customer can demand stuff, a customer *has already paid*, or he's not a customer. A customer has a certain expectation that he gets what he paid for.
---
And none of that is true for watching a streamer on Twitch.
---
It becomes slightly more true if you're a sub, but even then: You sub to support the guy because you like him, you don't sub to gain influence over what he does. And if you don't like him anymore you unsub.
---
So the rules basically say ‘don’t damage blizzard’s image’. He said something that had nothing to do with blizzard (it was about Hong Kong protests), then blizzard damaged their own image by yeeting his opinion.
---
Right?
---
Kibler touched on this.
---
&gt; to me this penalty feels like it is deeply rooted in [the political situation in Hong Kong and Blizzard's interests in China].
---
And I agree, if any other political opinion was presented, the punishment from Blizzard would have been drastically different.
---
If they released a statement admitting they made a poor judgment call and revoked some of the punishments handed down on the player and rehired the casters, I do not think they would get attacked. People would still be mad but overall that would definitely be a positive PR move
---
I highly doubt most people move past the shitposting stage, actually taking action requires initiative and knowledge on the situation, in which you'd already be taking steps
---
There's people saying that China uses fucking yen as a currency, you think they have enough braincells to call a phone number?
---
When I came to this subreddit then I realized it is so easy to manipulate people with a few words of "freedom"
---
Blizzard was forced to take a stance on a subject they'd rather not take a stance on at all. It's really not that different except for scale. Of course I wont blame Thijs as much for his rash action as I would the calculated action of a large organization, but the principle is the same. Someday, you might have to make a similar choice.
---
I'm organizing a protest against Hong Kong as we speak. This is EVERYONES responsibility, as *individuals* as well as as companies.
---
Well they should learn from NBA unless China market is majority of their income or they don’t really care
---
Cool bro, buy me a ticket to HongKong.
---
I don’t think they were defending blizz’s actions, just clarifying. Also how did they deflect? I see no deflection.
---
But whatevs. Have a nice afternoon lol
---
You cannot complain about China's domination of HK if you support the colonization of Puerto Rico.
---
It’s a good conspiracy theory I’ll admit, but the fact of the matter is the cold, hard truth is that this is just out these kinds of productions work. It just is. I’ve worked on and born witness to similar live productions before.  The producer could have not pressed a button to allow him on screen or pressed a button to cut his audio. It was that simple. They did it for the American university one today with the kid and his white board message. Why they didn’t do it here is anyone’s guess. Not paying enough attention? Not able to make that quick decision? Not sure if they should allow it or not? Who knows. 
---
The point is, the casters literally had no choice but to stick it out on camera. They didn’t have cue cards telling them how to react or what to say. They made the decision to jokingly (and cautiously) play along and attempt to quell the chaos it could have caused as per their job, and that was obviously the wrong decision because it got them sacked. But would screaming at him to not say it or getting in to a fight with him on camera have been better? Would walking off have been better? That probably would have gotten them flack from the other side — a lose-lose situation. At the most this could have gotten them a reprimand, just like how at most blitz should have gotten a $1,000 fine. 
---
But instead Blizzard decided to just nuke everything in hopes no one would notice or not care. Which, we obviously do.
---
Banning people for talking about this in chat is 100% acceptable. It is his decision to not involve himself.
---
Yes playing hearthstone means I support genocide. 
---
Well looks like I'm a nazi now.
---
But will they feel it enough to care? Isn’t China by far their biggest market?
---
The opportunity cost of siding with China here heavily outweighs what the western world seems as fair and just. It would take a lot for them to switch their position I think.
---
You need to be authorized as a foreigner to go in a net cafe in China?? Fuck that place why would anybody visit it I don’t understand.
---
Good for you if you are not personally affected. Good for the rest of us that language is evolving.
---
I'd love to play TEPPEN too bad it's region locked so most of the planet can't play it including my country.
---
I am a big fan of Kibler and have been since he was The Dragonmaster in Magic. I also agree with about 99% of his post here, but I do wonder what he thinks about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. 
---
It does seem to me that both cases are analogous and it's difficult to agree with one and not with the other.
---
So the general feeling is that blizzard banned  blitzchung and fired the casters to try and not get involved in the whole HK issue; they were trying not to take a side?
---
Him and Krip have never given a shit about anything other than money so its no surprise
---
Damn I hope that snarkiness was worth it
---
Boy we've never been busy'er. you have no idea
---
I think they would have. "Vote for Trump!" would be a rather controversial statement. I think "Do not vote for Trump!" would be a better example for your point.
---
&gt; Executives made a call. The organization gets the penalty. all of them. Doesn’t make it right or fair or equitable. It’s simply what is.
---
Which isn't what you're advocating for. Lynching a streamer for not quitting their job overnight isn't the same as having a streamer lose their game as a result of the company faltering.
---
Asking CS to refund your purchases, or delete your account, isn't the same as DMing a CM telling them to off themselves, or pestering them to release a public statement. Targeted harassment is harassment. You aren't attacking the company, you're attacking human beings. Exactly the thing that you're trying to fight against over the internet.
---
Thanks for taking a principled, moral stance. Best of luck in your future endeavors,
---
Wow. Must be really hard times for you!
---
Yeah I was a bit too emotional earlier. What you say is reasonable. I still disagree about the sub thing because if lots of people unsub he would be pressured into taking action but yeah.
---
I think this is the best take on this. I understand that the company doesn't want the association with controversy, but we should seek to establish a business culture that allows oppressed peoples to speak out when given the platform. Anything less is dehumanizing the professional who speaks their mind.
---
I never claimed brutality against the police was acceptable.  I claimed protesters defending themselves was acceptable.
---
Show me pictures of protesters dressing up like cops and shooting them point blank in the chest or beating cops that are handcuffed on the ground and I will be equally appalled.
---
&gt;	using it as an insult makes it seem like they are in the wrong doing it.
---
Using anything as an insult is an insult though my dude. I could say you smoke raccoons with Jesus you hipster loving dumpster fire. 
---
But that doesn’t mean shit about it. It’s always up to your brain to filter then interpret for yourself what you think it means, and you’ve proven you think it means some stuff I don’t, so you gotta wonder about yourself I guess. 
---
Cocksucking is a beautiful act, if someone calls me a cocksucker I thank them. You should try it.
---
That's generally the gist, yes, but that's a capitalism thing not a libertarian thing. 
---
Publicly traded companies actually have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits within certain guidelines. Their strategies in doing so sometimes appear moral or immoral, but they are just reactions to public sentiment.
---
If "green" is in, green products are profitable. Companies go green because its popular with consumers and with employees, not because its "right". 
---
If you are a member of a capitalist society or is your responsibility to be aware of what you are supporting with your money and labour. Voting with your dollar and your time is just as important as voting with a ballot. 
---
Libertarians, speaking generically , just believe that if we all were more diligent in doing that we wouldn't need government to intervene. For example, government requires food packaging to include ingredients, but if consumers refused to buy food without ingredient lists then that law and the infrastructure required to enforce it would be unnecessary. The reason they seem shaky on the details may just be because every libertarian-leaning individual draws a different line for what they deem "necessary governmenr intervention" - there's no hard definition.
---
I am absolutely for supporting HK in this, but (ab)using a law for a right that has been granted, just to punish this company in protest for something that they have done, feels completely wrong for me personally. It should not be a tool or instrument to be used destructively as a burden and punishment, it should be used constructively, for something good. Please don't abuse this.
---
There have been plenty of pro gamers for years... it just isn’t as mainstream or broadcasted as massively. “Brand new” it is not.
---
that’s the thing though, they’re not going to do that. because if they do, they will get attacked once again for only “making the right choice” because they got caught. remember when the outrage over them firing their staff happened? they didn’t say anything about it, they just did it, and moved on.
---
again, there is no good way out of this. they just have to let it die down.
---
So we need make blizzard good again... If we win blizzard games and blizzard itself be more better
---
Yeah, that's self-censoring
---
&gt; I hate how people are clearly blowing up on front line support, streamers who just want to focus on their game (and lively hoods since a lot of them can't just swap to a new game as protest), and literally everyone else that isn't in a management position that actually made the decisions.
---
Indeed, a lot of the anger is misdirected. The decision came down from management and likely primarily from Blizzard Taiwan and NetEase offices.
---
I appreciate that Kibler and some others have the means to stand in solidarity and openly defy the decision, but not everyone who works for or relies on Blizzard for livelihood has that option. There are also many within Blizzard who disagree with this and are pushing internally for a reversal.
---
At the same time you see a lot of people threatening to quit HS and then announcing they're going to just switch to other games operated by the same companies that are doing this. If you want to take a stand, don't just go to some other NetEase or Tencent game.
---
Isn’t her father a Chinese billionaire?
---
I think there is no justification that is not morally repugnant for Blizzard to take the money from the winner when they won fair and square. Cheaters aren't handled this harshly and cheaters deserve it. Blizzard has shown it doesn't give a shit about the integrity of the game or its current customers.
---
&gt;why
---
People react differently to protesting. They come to Blizzcon to enjoy the games and people protesting might ruin the experience.
---
I don't really care to defend Blizzard on this but the prize money denial is part of the rule they're citing that bans inflammatory speech.  That said, they should have just given him a warning.
---
Supporting HK is racist? What in the actual fuck are you smoking?
---
The whole interview was Blitz saying his 8 words. They saw what he was wearing and knew that was what was going to happen anyway if they tried to do an actual interview with him. They didn't give him any extra time to protest or anything.
---
What Kibler says it's very on point. Blizzard does not want their games used for political statement, which is reasonable, but the punishment was insanely harsh. Blizzard comes off as China's lap dog, and the punishment itself is a political statement in support of China's repressing Hong Kong.
---
 I won't be giving blizzard any money for a long time to come and I'm not watching their esports either.
---
Ah yes, the same crowd that screams “Don’t politicize video games bc MUH IMMERSION” when there’s a gay or female character in games also doesn’t support basic human rights. Why am I not surprised
---
Hey my same exact three. When What the Deck was announced as having Day[9] and Kibler I was so excited even if I’m not super into MtG.
---
I mean, the hope is the same as any punishment that is meted out without the expectation of making true reparations: to discourage something.  Much in the way their response was to discourage ppl using their stream as a political platform (and to kowtow to Xhina), ppl's goal is to make Blizzards realize they have to make a choice -- Fucks with China, or be for freedom.  If other companies see consumers leave Blizzards over this, and ppl mess with them in healthy ways (that show how unhealthy their China relationship is), then maybe those companies, even if it is too late for Activision, decide to not be lead by the nose. 
---
That is the goal of such responses, even if many do indeed just want some form of petty revenge.
---
Ah Brian Kibler the voice of reason that I was waiting for. I completely agree with him on what he said in his post.
---
He's wrong comparing his standards as a caster with the standards applied to a player. But agreed with everything else.
---
Damn. This comment is underrated.
---
What, was this on Fox News?
---
I always just play in response to them, so if they are roping every turn I’m putting on netflix and just listening for the rope.  Usually after a turn or two of us both roping and me not emoting or doing anything they give up.
---
Sure he'd be uninvited, but the issue is of him comparing making statements about US politics versus someone making statements against China. Blitzchung was banned specifically because of pro-Hong Kong statements, not because of generic political statements. Kibler is downplaying the reason for what happened. The issue is not that Blizzard willingly punished Blitzchung in the way they did, it's that an American company was forced to do so by China.
---
Supporting or bad mouthing Trump doesn't put the market of an entire nation in jeopardy. China is a massive market and the government will happily oust anyone not playing by their rules. It's not like they care about the happiness of their own population.
---
because all the better decks were smacking those decks before they got a chance to do anything
---
The magnitude of the events being compared (impeaching trump vs HK protests and police brutality) is not comparable. While his argument holds true for something like an impeachment opinion, freedom is literally the table stake for HK. 4+ months of protests have been going on. Countless events of police brutality and Chinese govt-backed brutality. For freedom. We all take it for granted, but when freedom is being used against you, more drastic measures are warranted. His outcry on stream was still brave and still - in my eyes - warranted for the sake of democracy. If my nation (Canada) began going down the path of Communism, I’d make public outcries too.
---
J, I logged in yesterday just to see my new Valeera skin. I promptly logged out after seeing it and realizing that I can’t use previously existing golden cards for the wild event cards. That skin is so out of character for Valeera it’s unbelievable.
---
It really wouldn't. I wasn't being mean and then you jump in here and call me a fuckhead. The irony is not lost on me.
---
I had to even out all the BS in here. After all, the world should be perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Blizzard not related to hearthstone?????????????
---
No I'm not, thanks for asking. I just don't like lies or propaganda regardless of where they come from.
---
Not to mention the moral and ethical argument. Taiwan has gained what Hong Kong is asking for. I'd feel pretty hypocritical personally to prevent someone asking for the same rights I already enjoy.
---
But why is wishing one's platform that was formed to discuss a game  remain free of geopolitical issues a desire worth damning someone over?
---
I understand it is an important issue but you shouldn't expect everyone to instantly come to the same conclusions and make the same choices you did.
---
Some people have their own issues right in front of them to worry about, and others just want to play the game and have a good time doing it.
---
Cool! Just wanted to make sure. Sometimes my online tone doesn’t read right. Take your time :)
---
Likewise, it's always hilarious to watch people eat the edgy-act up.
---
I used to like Brian Kibler.
---
I still do, but I used to as well.
---
You never said about anything action being taken overnight, but you're accusing streamers and casters who haven't taken a stance against Blizzard based on what happened Monday.
---
(and I edited that post to explain my point at length, jsyk)
---
I guess I can somewhat agree with this. The only thing is, we don’t know what their contracts looked like or if someone told them prior to the show to not bring it up or whatnot. If they were informed that they shouldn’t talk about it yet they still brought it up despite blizzard instructing them not to then I do not believe the punishment was harsh at all, they were trying to stir up controversy when asked specifically not to do so.
---
&gt; ... let's just leav eit at that.
---
lul
---
If I remember correctly, he gave them the black gloves they're wearing in the iconic photo. While they clearly had a lot more to risk and to lose than he did, it stands as a powerful reminder that those of us who are more fortunate must be willing to assist those who are struggling. It would have been so easy for him, a white man, to look the other way.
---
We may not live in Hong Kong, but if we agree with them, it's our moral duty to support them when and where we can. It is so easy, so simple, to turn our heads and look the other way - it doesn't affect us, after all. But we can, and will, do better than that.
---
Please re-read, that's not what I'm saying at all.
---
I know what you mean. But it should be allowed to say, that you are for freedom and such.
---
Which Kibler specifically said he realizes he is in a place where he is lucky enough to do that’s and fully understands not everyone can
---
The blizzard rules make no assumptions on which is the "right" side. Which is the right thing to do. Everyone is saying that blizzard is acting like a pet of China for applying their rules (imo) fairly appropriately, but that's only because everyone is speculating that if he had said something against hong-kong that he wouldn't have been banned.
---
The truth is we only have one instance of this rule being applied for political reasons. Claiming that blizzard was biased in its enforcement of this rule is speculation until they are forced to enforce it on the opposite side of this political issue.
---
The false equivalency is ridiculous. I can shit talk Trump all I want. I can make memes about him and post them all over twitter with zero fear of reprisal. Try doing that about Xi in China and see how that goes for you.
---
WoW devs must be salty as hell right now.  They’re trying their hardest to regain player trust after the mess that was 8.0 (bad, grizzly hills good) and then Blizz pulls this stunt.
---
Note that the rule that Blizzard applied is: 
---
Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
This basically means that Blizzard can do whatever they want to do. There was no specific rule against making a political statement. According to the official rules, the casters could not prevent Blitzchung from making a political statement during his interview.
---
One of these days guys. China will blow up and something major will happen. Until then, show your support, or lack of it, with your wallet and choices!
---
That's a solid statement, thanks kibler you are a good guy.
---
And I have immense respect for your choice to not cast at blizcon.
---
I'm just gonna keep playing the game I like on the bus home, good luck though
---
Occams razor doesn't apply here as the casters literally had nothing they could do to prevent this and did their very best to show no involvement. Just because you need more text to explain a fucked up situation doesn't mean that you are wrong.
---
So Merica got da powa?? fuk em uppppp!!!!!!!
---
How? Does it work like magnetic? I tried attacking another minion with it and it died as usual, so what does the "Lasts forever" mean?
---
You literally repeated what I just said. 
---
My point was that its independent and seperate despite china's claim the island is clearly seperate and distinct, why did you think I said otherwise?
---
Better give up your phone, your PC, your laptop, your clothes, and virtually everything else you own, otherwise you're supporting the state government in China.
---
&gt;I won’t pretend to understand either the intricacies of the geopolitical situation in China and Hong Kong or the full extent of Blizzard’s business interests there, but to me this penalty feels like it is deeply rooted in both.
---
He clearly came out and said that he felt the penalty was too harsh and hence believing influence from China.
---
&gt;That kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with.
---
And then stated that this was reason he is stepping down.
---
I did, calmer now, lol. Just had a bit of a huff. XD
---
It's gonna be hard for you be taken seriously quoting thanos, but hey you do you.
---
Those people were 100% appointed by Tencent, and are just parroting the same old song and dance for the government
---
I doubt they had literally anything to do with the punishment, let alone have anything to do with Blizzard as a whole other than being an marketing tool for the mainland
---
Weren't Nazi soldiers just random German soldiers (i.e. random Blizzard employees)? Didn't we still persecute and condemn Nazi soldiers? Or is this situation different because its not as extreme? I'm not taking one position or the other, but I'm just asking the question.
---
I'm really hoping that with this happening so close to Blizzcon, there *will* be a noticeable drop in their earnings
---
&gt; where is the threshold where someone changes from an innocent bystander to authoritarian lackey?
---
Being a 1/1 with a powerful battlecry is a good tell.
---
Yeah respect, Brian "Don''t call me Brian "Brian Kibler" Kibler" Kibler
---
&gt;  and chose poorly.
---
Poorly? No, they chose correctly. Speaking out for human rights is always correct.
---
It may be the largest *potential* market in t future, but fuck appealing to your *current* market right?
---
Instead of writing what you deem is right, check the numbers first.
---
TVN24 is the biggest news channel in Poland. In fact it is 4 times as big as Polsat News

---
&gt;  It's in their contract.
---
That contract is garbage. I know of absolutely no other sport where the punishments start at "Ban you for a year, and literally take all your of your earnings for a year"
---
Glad that he has the balls to step away, but his idea of "professionalism" coming first, when the country in question is actively committing genocide, can go fuck itself.
---
If blizzard doesn't want Chinese politics in their games, they need to get out of bed with the Chinese government. THEY need to change, not those of us who notice the problem and say something.
---
they removed that button for halloween, I'm so sad
---
Like other dude said, that's EA 100%
---
The free cards everyone got will last 2 weeks (or so) but the event itself will last 2 months so then you can use your copies.
---
It's the same problem we see In the us political climate. There is constant chaos, crisis, and scandals. People have barely comprehended one day's insanity before they are deluged with the next. It's the same with China. Every day there is some new scandal that, decades ago might have caused an international response, but by the time the news has spread, news is already spreading of the latest catastrophe.
---
not sure if you are following the situation, but during the night where protesters, HKPF and Carrie Lam gathered to have an open discussion, there was a protester who ended his speech with: 
---
"If you are going to respond, do not call me 'friend', we are not friends"
---
"By the way, I have a happy life and no I will not be committing suicide."
---
something about showing them how cold they're being is very powerful.
---
There are other TCGs out there
---
&gt; As far as I can tell, no one is claiming moral superiority for giving no comment on the situation.
---
Maybe moral consistency is a better choice of words.
---
&gt; If someone wants to play the game while separating themselves from what's going on, just let them. If you don't like their lack of a stance, simply unfollow them and be done with it.
---
This is the exact passivity I talked about. Unfollowing them isn’t going to change the fact child protesters are being beaten to death in the streets of Hong Kong, and Blizzard is abetting that. 
---
&gt; Forcing them to take a side isn't going to do anything other than hardening their hearts to the whole thing.
---
I hate this argument that good people should be forced to swallow banal uncaring evil because if they speak up other people will just be worse. Maybe their hearts shouldn’t harden to cold blooded murder because it affects their card game.
---
&gt; They may, but Blizzard, on its own, is not worth being a binary, life or death choice.
---
Luckily, uninstalling your Blizz products won’t kill you.
---
Exactly. I have a basically genetic hatred of the chinese government as a vietnamese person, but could realistically accept some kind of slap on the wrist for the player, thats whatever. Nuking him and two casters from orbit goes way too far.
---
Free u/ishaan96s
---
I think they need to have it in their clause that it's up to their sole decision. Considering they have representatives from multiple nations, and if it was up to a board, they may have a different view. So if it was a board from NA, they may be okay with a pro democracy view but not a pro communist statement. Also it allows them to react faster and cut it off vs waiting until after the event takes place.
---
I hope this hits top all time.
---
&gt; Aye , heads will roll Mr. ~~Xi~~Pooh!
---

---
Well it’s gonna be hard explaining my frustrations to idiots so this will have to suffice.
---
Source on that? While only one game, an interview with a Blizz employee associated with WoW estimated 70% of players are Asian. Purely speculatively, I'd imagine a large population of those playing Starcraft still are from the Asian scene, and mobile games are exceedingly popular in Asia that I'd imagine Hearthstone makes excellent money there too. 13% seems a rather small.
---
Hmm so there seems to be some sort of contradiction in the [rules](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/w4/W4NWIBHB74T31564507077190.pdf).
---
P. 10 section 6.1.A stating:
---
*All prize deductions will be decided in Blizzard’s sole discretion*
---
While p. 12 section 6.1.O section plainly states:
---
*reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD*
---
Gotta agree with kibler. I’ve been a fan of his for a long time and this only adds another layer to my love for him.
---
Huh? 
---
Is there some sort of blizzard hate going around that I'm not aware?
---
Kibler is a gem.
---
I miss him in the MTG community so much. He has consistently shown his good character for the 9 or so years that I’ve followed him.
---
Yeah, but I think wearing gas mask was kinda too much, don't you thing so?
---
Maybe you're just a blind idiot.
---
By that logic, paying taxes to any country that trades with China is directly supporting the inhibition of HK protests, since China use that trade money to finance their army, which is sent to HK to "regulate" the protests.
---
You should contact your governor about suspending taxes, otherwise you're being complicit in the kidnapping of HK activists.
---
I also hope you used absolutely nothing that's "Made in China", and that you've written a letter to your local newspaper asking people to throwaway their Huawei phone, since it's also Chinese.
---
I sincerely wonder if Trump will do a custom card review on all of these. This is way too op!

2015
---
Idk dude, he made pretty clear hes not in line with how Blizzard handled the situation, and as response is steping away from potential future casting. He took a clear stance compared to various other streamers. 
---
Doesnt seem pointless to me.
---
No corporation should be allowed to withdraw your earnings after they have already profited after your work because of political disagreements.
---
Let me tell you one thing I do know. Frodan will SURE AS FUCK be there to cast.  Why? because he has no morals at all.  The fact that he has asian heritage makes it that much worse.
---
Agreed.
---
I'm not a Hearthstone person, so my views on this are purely from the outside. Entirely with you on this. If it had overtaken the interview or broadcast that's a different thing.
---
To punish someone for a phrase showing solidarity with people and is tied to human rights is straight BS. Accepting that a punishment for this is fair is just meeting the Chinese government in the middle tbh and that ain't something we want.
---
 Maybe somebody on the production side got reprimanded too, we don't know.  It's on the casters as well because they specifically asked him to "say the eight words."
---
It really is that simple.
---
The part that confuses me is people thinking something called "Empty Loot Box" being empty is a bug.
---
Virtue signaling is a term used by people who want a pat on the back for doing nothing.

As much as we want it to, participating in a broken system to fix it from the inside almost never works out.
---
Seikos situation was in part Blizzards fault, they owned up to that.
---
With Roger they owned up to their tardiness and handling as well and said they would handle it better in the future. Here we are, strong punishment instantly determined. People complaining again, this time  because it's not in line with what has happened in the past.
---
 Blizzard was never going to win here, which is why companies dread being associated with anything political so much; it's a lose - lose situation. You can't allow it to happen, but any punishment is always going to cause an outrage if enough people care about the cause in question.
---
He does have a point, to be fair. I could just redownload it.
---
Look I think the way that they handled the situation was shitty but it hasn't been confirmed in any way that this was due to pressure from China. Answer me this question, with a source - has Blizzard ever let anyone, of any political affiliation espouse political opinions during their tournaments? That's what this ultimately boils down to. The wider situation is dire yes but Blizzard aren't some bastard communist organisation overnight and many MANY companies have ties some way with China, Bluehole, Epic, Disney, Apple etc etc etc.   
---
These companies do 2 things. 1. make a corporate decision to make their market to open to a wider eastern audience and 2. Bring their technology or entertainment to innocent people in these regions. No one batted an eyelid when Blizzard initially signed with China to bring WoW there, censoring things like undeads, there were lots of news articles about it at the time. China have a nasty history but as it stands they're a major world player in import and export and have a large market it's profitable to tap into, a market of people that possibly no more support china bullshit than Blizzard ACTUALLY do.
---
What group? I’ll join it to do the same.
---
I only just remembered all the blizzard related social media follows I have. Unfriending and unfollowing every single one of ‘em.
---
Yes in a sense that both are bad. 
---
Same way I would "unequivocally associate" having your entire body crushed in a hydraulic press with dropping something on your foot. 
---
Same way I would call someone that has sex for 1 dollar or 1 million dollars a prostitute.
---
&gt;since it has been nearly 2 days since the events, not like half a year
---
Steal 1 penny or steal million, both are theft. I wouldn't give a shit about stealing 1 penny or 2 days since the event, but that doesn't change what it is.
---
&gt; That kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with. When I learned about the ruling, I reached out to Blizzard and informed them that I no longer feel comfortable casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon. I will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision. Unless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.
---
Dammit Kibler. You're supposed to wait until the day before you're supposed to be casting at Blizzcon so they don't have time to get a replacement!
---
Yeah I’ll leave my legit sports broadcasting career to go broadcast for video games lol
---
Ha... suggest Blizzard to move to Hong Kong...
---
Play more minions before you pop him into the head phase.
---
"I don't want politics in my games" doesn't make you even tempered, just a coward.
---
This isn't a really good comparison. You can still get the idea of what they were saying; the meaning of what it is, even if it makes no sense in your language. They can explain to you the meaning behind something that doesn't make sense, even if it won't make sense translated.
---
It's like someone bringing you just enough of the ingredients from their house and cooking it for you. It'll taste the same, it just won't make any sense how they made it.
---
CENSORSHIP IS CENSORSHIP.  He is still supporting China.  He can just ignore chat and stay neutral.
---
Here is the problem with the Blizzard hipocrisy. Blizzard has no business with the GOP, so they don't give a crap about Trump.
---
If some GOP investor and Trump supporter had  Blizzard shares they would get rid of Kibler asap.
---
Blizzard is only caring about their brand and sales. I remind you of the P4wnyhof Viewbotting and cheating case. Blizzard removed invitations because of Twitterdrama. Other streamers have shown solidarity and didn't participate because P4wnyhof has been invited.
---
Yes they removed players over Twitterdrama!
---
Your post is incoherent and sounds as if you strung together blather from a few different pundits without having any idea what any of them were talking about (if they even did themselves).
---
I get what you’re saying but I think two points are important. One, making $100,000 yearly back then from events is an amazing living. Not to discount the difficulty of the job, but making a couple grand for a weekend of work is a life-changing amount of money for most people.
---
Second point is that was nearly a decade ago. Before Twitch had ballooned, before sub buttons, before major monetization. I remember TeamLiquid’s primary sponsor in these days was ‘The Little App Factory’. Now it’s major tech companies. Day[9] had just gotten the first sub button ever.
---
And most notably, before Blizzard actually threw its hat in the ring financially. Have to believe Blizz is coughing up a big amount of dough to lure someone like Kibler to come record marketing, rehearsal, etc for a week, given most streamers will tell you a couple-day vacation can cripple their sub numbers
---
Blizzard literally wrote: "We will always respect and defend the pride of our country [China]."
---
Well, here's a start!  https://www.thedailybeast.com/blizzard-employees-staged-a-walkout-to-protest-banned-pro-hong-kong-gamer
---
Companies that censor American content to appease China should lose all rights and protections afforded by the US government.
---
I really dislike politics being brought into sports/entertainment because thats when you end up with shit storms like this where lots of uninformed people are just going with the herd whatever the topic is. This is not the place for that. People need something relaxing to let the steam out and while the message might be important, it's wrong to force it on folks.
---
Regarding the Hong Kong protest in their daily life. The people who care, read news and know what's up. The rest will talk about it for like 5 minutes, post empty garbage on social media and then forgets the whole thing. And I can understand that. When your have enough shiz to deal with in your daily life, who cares about riots in hk, ebola in Congo, genocide in Mianmar and so on. Respect for those who do and trying to actively do something about it, but what's happening here ain't that.
---
And he did a great job as a designer in the WoW TCG team (that is for me a better game than HS). He is really a talented guy.
---
Yeah I don't think there would be outrage if instead of supporting the Honk Kong protests he said "Heil Hitler, Nazis for life!" That's my problem with a lot of people reacting to this because a lot of them are clearly hypocritical about freedom of speech and when to use it.
---
Hong Konger here to say Thanks! Thank you all for speaking up against self-censorship and for standing with Hong Kong.
---
*looks at daryl moreys personal twitter*
---
Yea I don’t think China cares.
---
Yes it's bad. A personal website is a platform for where you can voice your personal views. A video game competition that is meant to encourage global unity no matter where you came from is not a place to discriminate against another nation (even if they are bad).  If a winner of a gold medal started talking crap about Russia, China, North Korea, etc.. it wouldn't be very sportsman like now would it?  It would make competitors from that nation who just want to enjoy the game feel persecuted too.
---
"“Doing business in China, it’s been easier to ignore the authoritarianism of the government because they were asking us to do things like remove a skeleton [from a game],” he said."
---
yep. it's a very slippery slope. it's too easy to compromise for money.
---
There are other employers in the world. Many of them aren't even chinazi sympathizers. Of course almost everyone in the world needs A job. They don't need THIS job. And if there's only one job in the whole world you can get hired for, well you made some poor career planning.
---
Lol.
---
Yet somehow you tripped into being both. Well that sucks.
---
That's because it wasn't Blizzard's idea, it was their China handlers who told them what to do with Blitz
---
What they really should do is unfire the casters. Thats what seems most diabolical to me, they just fucked over everyone they could as fast as possible to appease the Pooh Bear
---
Having corporation being politically neutral is better than them being politically activists imho.
---
If it become a popular sentiment then it become mainstream attitude and then a voting issue etc.. Acceptance of what is happening and saying you can't do anything is defeatist and actually doesn't do anything.
---
Get this orc to legend
---
This. How can people think that their unyielding support for the Chinese mobile market at the expense of their moral image is not political?
---
It’s hilarious. Nobody would have cared if they just let it slide, but they were placed into a trap by blitzchung. Blizzard either appeases China, or they potentially lose them. China market money &gt; their core player base and GMs. It’s that simple. They took the bait and they will lose because of it. They have betrayed their western values in the process. You can’t be simultaneously in favor of freedom and inclusion while also supporting censorship and government oppression because money. Blizzard rules don’t matter if the majority of their playerbase find the enforcement of those rules to be immoral.
---
Doing legendaries and epics took long enough, so I left the commons and rares, but the point is made, I think. I'm not coming back.

Write your senator/representative a letter, give money to non-profit journalists covering it, shit man protest in your city, anything that actually has an impact of more than "maybe someone will notice I disagree".

This is way too simplistic. You have to look at both the policy and the actions in how it is applied. They don’t jive with your account.

I'm against the Chinese system and their grasp on Hong Kong as well, but Blizzard has to protect their interests. And it is a legitimate interest for Blizzard as a company to not be banned from the (very important) Chinese market. Blizzard as a company can simply not afford to lose China - almost no company can. That is why almost no company that operates world-wide will criticize China (or accept being abused as a vehicle to criticize China). It's sad, but that's how things are. So a punishment had to happen. A punishment like a 2.000 $ fine would have been understandable. As for the casters, since they really actively promoted this entire thing, i do think that firing them is what most companies would do. Casters are employed by a company to do a certain job in the interest of a company - and since it's a live cast, you have to be able to trust your casters that they will not abuse that situation to act against your corporate interests - that kind of trust-relationship is important and if that is gone due to an incident like the one that happened here, firing them is an acceptable answer. Again, this has nothing to do with my political stances, it's about basic work ethics and work law.
---
Why would I even attempt discourse with someone who's as big a cunt as you are? "I'm certain I know infinitely more than you" who the fuck even says this kind of infantile shit?

&gt; The vast majority of D3 steamers shat on Blizzard completely when D:I was announced and explored at BlizzCon
---
Because there were zero stakes and they knew there would be no backlash. Mobile diablo might even be a great game, i don't know, but it's for a different audience than any existing diablo audience and by proxy diablo themed influencer audience.
---
Calmquit
---
Speaking of  political neutrality, I wonder what would they do if someone said Taiwan is part of PRC in the same situation.
---
It’s past politics. There isn’t two sides to this. You either support evil or you don’t. That’s not political. Blizzard supports murdering Hong Kong citizens. It’s pretty sick.
---
Can you explain your pro-China viewpoint?
---
Not only communism, every fucking type of government wants to control his population. Also, there's no communism in China that's a plainly awful dictatorship.
---
blizzard is a chinese company

He didn't stop working with Blizzard.
---
He walked away from a job offer. Nothing is preventing them from offering him another one down the line, or him accepting a different offer.
---
Because everything has to be about your tinfoil hat theory huh? 
---
They removed it because it broke the rules. Then people used appropriate channels to challenge the decision. Then mods talked about it, and agreed. Then rules were changed and the post was reinstated.
---
Funny how discussion works better than pitchforks.
---
Harambe: "Kid, i just got one thing to say. Liberate..."

The everyday folks that actually work in the fields and factories. The very definition of communism is that the people control the means of production. They decide what is done with it and they decide where everything goes. 
---
Now tell me, if you talk negatively about Xi or Kim, by say calling them monstrous genocidal dick faces, what happens to you? Is it
---
A. Nothing because the people's freedom of speech is protected. 
---
B. Nothing because there is a system of government in place that allows open criticism. 
---
Or 
---
C. You get your fucking organs harvested.
---
But he's the perfect card, he's got Divine Shield AND taunt, amazing value and a Deathrattle to boot, holy shit he's the perfect man.
---
It was a genuine question. It seems like you have strong opinions about this situation and I was wondering if that came from personal experience.
---
I do think you are oversimplifying a bit, even as I agree with you overall that ethics must be of the utmost importance for everyone, and certainly of higher precedence than they seem to be today.
---
You know what's hilarious? Foxconn is a Taiwanese company using cheap Chinese labor to make Iphones for Apple. So even Taiwan the target of that is a hypocrite themselves.
---
Do you even know what communism is? Modern China has as much doing with communism as Canada. Its just a plain old dictatorship.
---
well pretty much they saw what happened with NBA.  Business is closed.
---
If blizzard didnt say squat then their investment in china just became 0.
---
Blizzard is just bowing down to the money.
---
They could have sent a warning, or a week long ban at most. Roger only got banned after a year long community backlash. Seiko got a verbal warning for playing autochess during a GM match. Blizzards usual MO is "issue warning first, don't give heavy handed punishments".
---
The swiftness and intensity of the punishment makes it pretty clear it was politically motivated. Not to mention the hilarious "protect the dignity of China" official statement.
---
I disagree. Perhaps it’s just that too few other people have actual confidence in themselves.
---
Pride to torture and kill free people THAT HAS SUCCEEDED IN LIVING IN A FREE CITY? Imao
---
I´d say he is pro human rights. But his statement was addressed at Blizzard and their actions. 
---
He took a stance against the harsh way they converted their rules, and is steping away from potential co-working with Blizzard. Doesnt sound like a middle line tbh. 
---
Tbh i didnt expected him coming out and yelling : FREE Honkong, F..K BLIZZ+CHINA. 
---
But he did way more than every other streamer so far didnt he?
---
Well the rule is specifically written to give Blizz a legal right to always "nuh-uh its my Gamecube so I have to win or you have to go home" 
---
Its meant to be vague so the fact that theyre hiding behind it with no further context says that they cant say anything that isnt damaging to themselves
---
As for the Chinese hearthstone account I haven’t seen any of that. But I still feel like the way blizzard handled it is fine. Like I said, it has no impact on anything it only impacted their business. Having a few offended customers around the world vs. losing the business of the largest player base they have is an absolute win. We’ve known for years that blizzard is greedy yet obviously still buy and play their games so what’s gonna change that now? The only thing blizzard could do that in my opinion would be too far is if they actually publicly pick a side. I find it incredibly greedy and terrible when companies use social issues to play into the public. Such as the pride month bullshit where all sorts of companies turn their logos rainbow and shove it down my throat.
---
sure, what about it are you curios about?
---
Should've been a fine, like in the OWL for first offenders. Something like a $1k fine would've gone down well yet still upheld the precedent of "no political shit". If that had happened we wouldn't be talking about this right now and Blizzard's marketing team wouldn't be on fire.
---
The people who disagree with blizzards decision want blizzard to act like britain and northern ireland where blasphemy laws still exist, and could technically be enforced completely rightfully, but never are.
---
Vagueness and going with the flow is exact reason why this who debacle started to begin with. The problem is that Blizzard's rules are so incredibly vague and basically says "Blizzard will punish you however they want if they feel you need to be punished." If there was a clear rule with a clear punishment for expressing controversial opinions while utilizing their platform this wouldn't be an issue.
---
Oh boy. You really don't understand the world at all, do you?
---
Of course China can be hurt politically just like any other nation. They are not some crazy miracle state breaking all market conventions.
---
But it's not what you think. You directly jump to us trying to change China when in fact the real change starts at home. Chinese expansion has only been possible because western companies have been allowed to abuse the system and do whatever the fuck they want for so long. 
---
They can abuse the Chinese market because we let them. Until we're willing to change that we're stuck.
---
So yes. The real solution is political, not come cute 'consume boycott'. That's an incredibly simplistic and naive understanding of the situation.
---
If supporting basic human rights is a political statement then nobody should be able to talk at all, because if the bar is that low everything is a political statement.
---
The people talking are breathing in between sentences, they must be pro-air!  Ban em!
---
What a coward. Blizz is 100000% in the wrong, and there is no justification.
---
:) When it comes to money, everyone is a hypocrite.

Literally the ruling party of China. Why are you trying to deny this, they're the ones causing Human Right's violations.
---
And I do understand Communism, the modern left does not. They support Open-Borders, etc which Is a ultra-Capitalist policy. Atleast modern Communists do In the West, their Is no "true" Communism outside of China right now.
---
"  If any company don’t want their own event to market political agenda, then there absolutely will be sanctions against parties that break their agreement "
---
And yet their actions against this player can be interpreted as a political statement, tbf I find it already iffy that they have a ruling to punish people for essentially expressing their basic human right for freedom of speech but one could argue it's a shield against extremism and a way to protect your platform.
---
The funny thing is, if the punishment wasn't as harsh and blizzard had been more considerate and tactful this whole thing could've been swept under the rug. But now it's international news and everyone knows the people at the top of Blizzard are ccp cucks.

Anything that helps you justify continuing to play Blizzard games ;)

&gt; And maybe youd be better off arguing against my points instead of my person.
---
I haven't mentioned anything about you as a person. You may be referring to me responding to the _very first thing_ you said to me, "Get your head out of your ass" though. Your original post to me gives pretty much no factual points to argue against though, at least nothing immediately relevant.
---
&gt;no amount of yellow-bellied horseshit from people like you who can only get their dick hard by straddling an imaginary middle line will make me change my mind
---
OK. I'm on the side of the hong-kong protestors. It seems like you jumped to the conclusion that I want Hong-Kong to suffer under oppressionist China, or stay neutral and be completely fine with people being killed for wanting freedom, and that's patently false. All I was trying to say is that people are really jumping the gun by thinking that Blizzard is selectively enforcing a rule that they've only ever enforced once. Hopefully you can see that's a really odd thing to assume.
---
&gt;Do you have any evidence this is the regular reaction Blizz would make?
---
No, but neither do you, and I'm not the one jumping to conclusions about it. My stance is "I'm not going to assume they're selectively enforcing it based on a sample size of one.", whereas your stance appears to be "Blizzard is on China's side in this because $$$ and anyone who thinks otherwise as their head up their ass".
---
&gt; Yes you fucking can, you just might have to sacrifice a little bit of your comfort to do it, and most people would rather tacitly support genocide than take a pay cut.
---
Try telling that to someone who has a family to support. That they should risk making their family homeless because they can't pay a mortage or rent, just so they can stand up to their employer.
---
Fuck off with you. you know nothing off the financial or other situations of the thousands of people working for blizzard.

For all you know there are people barely scraping by allready.

Why Is the ruling party literally Communist then? Please be factually correct thanks.

Companies hold real world power while being a sociopathical hivemind dominated by shareholders and projections.

We need persoective on this issue and stop polarizing eachother for minor and major differences, this matters to all of us.

If we want human dignity and values to be a guiding force in the coming century we need to be aware of this.

Thank you for voicing your oppinion on this subject Brian.
---
Huge respect for you
---
Yes, I have read the book. My reference is to the early part of the book.
---
He quit Grand Masters, but nothing was said about BlizzCon. Are Grand Masters finals at BlizzCon?
---
Their rules are shit and it gives blizzard open season to remove you and take your money if you picked your nose. Maybe he met president trump and didn’t shake his hand and trump targeted blizzard. 
---
So yeah, blizzard is just being a bitch they wrote the rules in a way they lets them react AFTER the fact to public or private reactions and apply the harsher penalty possible.
---
Or Blizzard wouldn't because they only care about who they know are involved. They don't know whether faceless camera drone A or B was working so no need to fire them to appease the public. It is easy and logical.  
---
(They are the people Blizzard is appeasing by this heavy handed punishment)
---
Ah nice supporting tyranny I love it
---
Sick! Share this and encourage more! They need our support
---
Is it worth checking out in your opinion? What was your experience so far with it?
---
&gt;dont like lies or propaganda 
---
So you must hate china then
---
Does Blizzard have a general rule against political messages at GM? Because if not, that's still horse shit. If so, fine, but I don't like the rule.
---
The gaming industry is really shit though there aren't exactly jobs growing on trees
---
Really? You don't see how "someone using the winner's interview to publicize a slogan used by protesters trying to overturn their government" could be thought to be out of place? Then why did all 3 of them expect it? Why did the commenters laughingly ducked at the motto?
---
The rule is worded loosely, but saying that it is a surprise that "pushing a political agenda in your winner's interview while dressed as a rioter" is against the rules... that's a whole different stretch.
---
Is there anyway to get the sound files from the "interactions" in the beginning phase of the round?   
---
For Example when you are Reno and hit Thrud: Thrud: You have fancy things, fancy man? to which Reno replies "Stay out of my pockets!"  
---
I tried looking for awhile and my google foo has failed me and so i am not sure where i can pick those up?
---
I get that he doesn’t want to jeopardize his career in anyway and is scared of Blizzard, but wtf? Grow some balls. Don’t do exactly what people are getting pissed off about which is silencing people. Just makes him seem cowardly.
---
This situation has drawn a line in the sand and we’re gonna see what kind of people some of these players and streamers really are. Are they gonna stand up for what is right or protect their own neck?
---
Kibler got it right.
---
&gt;A bank of time will not punish people with poor connection, in fact it helps them while punishing the ropers. 
---
How wouldn't it? 
---
If the game take ten seconds to register each of my actions, I only have one minute left on my clock, and I lose if I can't say play my Bloodlust and attack with seven minions, how isn't the game punishing me for having a poor connection?
---
Kibler has the advantage that he could probably walk over to Wizards of the Coast and say “Hey I don’t wanna play again but I’ll join the coverage team for pro Magic” and he’d get the job yesterday.  They’d be thrilled to get him back.
---
&gt; You guys know me for a decade now. You know I generally don’t get into serious non-gaming issues on stream, YouTube, or socials. This isn’t because I don’t have opinions, it is because I try to create chill and entertaining content, and give you guys a place to relax and feel comfortable. With that said, I want to be clear that I support those protesting in Hong Kong. With such a large part of their country pushing for change, they are, and deserve to be on the right side of history.   
---
&gt;I haven't been involved with competitive esports Hearthstone for years now, but Hearthstone for me is much more than their esports division and their recent poor decision making. I invite Blizzard to reconsider their position. Sure, they are in the entertainment space, so they want to keep anything that isn’t about Hearthstone out of their official broadcast, but the penalty on Blitzchung and the casters seems just too over the top. All of us who have spent the best part of our lives on Battlenet expect better out of Blizzard.
---
&gt;**Engaging in any act** that, **in Blizzard’s sole discretion**, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms. 
---
But not going to argue with you.
---
I think it really depends on what is being translated and from which languages. I've had people give up on explaining things because it just didn't work. Whether due to translation or cultural differences. But I see your point
---
That's when integer overflow happens and gets reset to 0
---
There is a difference in tolerating something and actively trying to squash it.
---
I don't know what economic system you live in, but I'm pretty sure its expected that publicly traded companies would burn babies to increase quarterlies.
---
Because if they didn't, and profit on the table were lost, I'm sure the board of directors &amp;/| investors would see the management that made that decision replaced promptly.
---
We will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost, by outlining to the world what spineless, insecure, immoral babies they are.
---
This is so hypocritical by the players imo. They say boycott Blizzard  yet play a tournament on a Blizzard-based game.
---
With what did you replace? Need a new mobile game, but not some cash grab copy-paste game...

The irony of what I was implying was lost on you, I think.
---
Are you sure this is the side of the debate you want to take? 
---
Comparing people giving up their sub to be of equal severity to what punshment blizzard gave out is so out of touch, let me tell you what would be equal, blizzard has to not only lose all the subs they have, but lose all hearthstone, overwatch, BFA sales, HOTS microtransactions they have made this year and be barred from making any money off of them for the next year. THAT would be a punishment of equal severity that they are giving here.
---
How discouraged do you think blizzard would be then?
---
So, protesting violent cops is OK when it is violent Chinese cops, but not violent US American cops.
---
Got it. This is all just american chauvinism and a further step on the road for and US-Chinese ww3. Which is good actually, becase then Jesus will come and judge us all and all the sinners will go to hell while Jesus will rule the thousand year empire.
---
Which is bullshit by the way.
---
That's good, my above comment was not meant to come off as so pointed (rude I guess)  I just wanted to point out that the two situations (streamers silencing hong kong speak, and blizz silencing hong kong speak) were not so different.  So anyway I appreciate that you see that and are consistent with how you view each situation.
---
I mean, 50 usually should do the trick.  maybe 100 at the most
---
I would say this post deserves plat/gold/silver but that would just be giving China more moneys.
---
All the internet's to you good person.
---
Assign a flair before this gets taken down.

I figured, but I wanted to give this person the benefit of the doubt :/

If you would like to learn more about China I would totally happy to talk to you, feel free to dm me &lt;3
---
Fuck China, we are going back to focusing on western market?
---
Readily accepting the failure of something when it begins is being defeatist. If the Hong Kong protesters had been "realists" like the people on this subreddit then it wouldn't be going into month 4.
---
&gt; It's not just video games. It's your movies, your television, your news, your social media, and even this fucking website. If they get their way, everything you consume will support their regime, and the steady creep will have been too slow to notice.
---
Sooooo, the exact fucking thing that the yanks have been doing for decades? And if you get too iffy, ala south america, iraq/afghanistan, hundreds of other examples, they bring that freedom right to your doorstep?
---
I did do it, check the reviews. It about spreading the word. If I convinced one other to also stand with HK thats a lot better than just me doing it myself and not posting for "internet points" so I could make you feel better.
---
subtle ads
---
Yeah Corpraitism is disgusting in situations like this.
---
They are just trying to figure out the most profitable PR move.
---
Johnson &amp; Johnson just got hit with a 8b dollar verdict because they downplayed the risks of risperdal.
---
Baltimore is suing BP/Shell/Exxon because they downplayed the risks of fossil fuels for decades.
---
Is Blizzard downplaying the risks of "JUST a little bit of language you're not allowed to use. For now." Could Blizzard ALSO fully understand silencing certain language will lead to immediate and ongoing abuses?
---
IANAL
---
I'm right there with you. It's weird not having downtime and logging in for a few games. 
---
Hopefully we'll cross paths on another game!
---
I don't know if blitzchung read his contract in that much detail.
---
Also, I don't think there is much controversy over blitzchung's decision. And if there is, I don't care. He broke a bad rule that shouldn't have been a rule in the first place in order to do something good, which he should have done. What's the problem? Who here is arguing he shouldn't have done it?
---
They need to assess a little faster.
---
So someone who make money off bliz games backing their boss.  Gee didn’t see this coming.
---
Because the punishment doesn't fit the offense. You wouldn't have someone's drivers license taken away for not feeding the parking meter.
---
I remember when it was about Jesus Christ
---
Yes. The US has the fewest restrictions on speech in the world. Open threats of violence are banned everywhere, but vague terms like "hate speech" are not banned in the US
---
I fully believe all of this will only ever negatively effect the employees of the company, not the rich people who make the decisions and certainly not China since Blizz is an exporter of goods to them not an importer. I know it might seem crazy to not want my own people to lose their jobs. The notion of someone doing something that they believe is morally right shouldn't be this astounding.
---
&gt; he pointed out that many other people involved in Hearthstone just would not be able to afford to do this.
---
That's the yuppie nuremburg defense.  I was just following orders, I gotta pay the mortgage, blah blah blah blah.  Anyone who doesn't cut ties with Blizzard after this is complicit in what they do moving forward.  I'd rather work at McDonalds than support this kind of filth.
---
Imagine after The Night if Broken Glass you made a comment like this. People are being beaten, tortured, shot in cold blood. Their crime? Wanting the right to make a choice for themselves. Think about that really really hard.
---
Now we need to make Kripparrian to uninstall Hearthstone and every Activision game from his PC.
---
The point is that in communism the population controls politics via voting, so the groundstone for communism is democracy. All the historical entities who called themselfes communist were the opposite of democracy, and so is china. State controll isnt communist. Communism is an utopy that is only possible after humanity cures its greed anger and anguish. For now its only usefull as a state of mind in striving for a better world.
---
The core idea of unionization. Join the union folks, they can't fire you all.
---
I applaud Kibler, but Kibler still has his stream and Omnislash,  he's financially sound compared to some of the other casters.  
---
Its not really fair for me to call for other people to sacrifice their finances when I have done nothing myself but post on reddit.
---
I don't know how you got that considering that isn't what he said at all. He doesn't do so during broadcasts as an employee because he represents the company. He does however and has for years had the 2016 election deck which is political. 
---
He has never taken an issue with politics being involved in games. The same way no comic reader really has a problem with politics in comics. They have a problem with it being used to push political ideologies.
---
Still so mad about being wrong you can't let it go.  😂
---
It's a sad day indeed. Our two acts probably won't do much in the grand scheme.
---
But at least we will be able to live with ourselves knowing we didn't sell out Hong Kong.
---
A very vague and flexible rule. And then Blizzard China just released a statement saying they will always stand by China...
---
Fantastic statement Kibler and well done distancing yourself when you have the opportunity.
---
Good, lemme know when all this overreaction bs is over
---
I completely disagree, this is one of those moments in history that people shouldn't sit by and watch - punishing him for voicing his desire to not be oppressed by a country that harvests organs from prisoners, among a whole host of other things,  is fucking vile.
---
thats exactly what it was 
---
another time, some guy came that was the ex boyfriend of one of this employees. He started threatening her in his shop, some other guy there told him to back off, they got in a fight and the guy destroyed the place, busted up all the glass, etc. Cops come and since the aggressor was military, they just let him go.
---
&gt;I dont think anyone should be pressuring them to bail on their jobs through social media.
---
If they stay they're complicit.  You can't stand against something and still get a paycheque from them.
---
The camera people and backend staff weren't egging him on to make his statement.
---
Fucking Kibler. Always calm and logical. I strive to be as wise as this man.
---
Good thing this isn't a conversation, this is q&amp;a. This also isn't a verbal exchange, it's written, which makes it perfectly viable to respond to numerous questions at a time, much easier than machine gunning questions verbally. He has plenty of time to think and respond. 
---
He asked what people were curious about regarding his stance, i responded with various things i wanted him to defend with his stance. He has not.
---
Again, sorry you can't understand answering various questions to defend your stance when you ask others to question you.

Does anybody have a link to a clip of the interview?
---
I understand making a comprehensive list, but you need to not be biased in doing so. The very first entry (about this HS Blitzchung situation) is already misleading. Blizzard didn't ban him simply for support Hong Kong democracy protest. He's been doing that for quite some time, without any repercussion. Blizzard banned him for utilizing their broadcast to make his political statement. Unfortunately, when the very first entry of your list is inaccurate, it makes the reader question how factual the rest is. Oftentimes it's the case that these comprehensive lists are skewed to inspire outrage and shock in the reader.
---
Thanks lmao. I was super hyped about the three epics and golden legendary, esp since I love meme decks like obelisk and mogu
---
Hey, it is possible! But for real, I appreciate the levelheaded correspondence.
---
Yeah, I have no sympathy for a multi-billion dollar company. Fuck them and their greed.
---
The downvotes XD
---
fuck blizzard
---
hooray cenzorship and supporting dicatotorships
---
And everything Thijs talks about is strictly related to Hearthstone? that is a massive reach. There is a huge difference between doing something so it doesn't upset Blizzard, when he actually makes most of his money from streaming on *Twitch* where no such standards about politics exist, and having a political conversation in an office.
---
There was no rule against political messages. The rule that Blizzard applied simply states that Blizzard can do whatever it wants.
---
No no, bitching about other people trying to make a change is the way to go. I just want the front page to be braindead "look at my wacky board/pack" posts again as I support organ harvesting and genocide with my dollars.
---
I just think it's interesting that they claim to want to keep politics out of their games, yet also choose to build their character's for Overwatch largely outside of the game itself with a heavy focus on sexual orientation. Not that I have a problem with the characters, but it's still a politically hot topic that they went out of their way to say "We support this".
---
You're not wrong of course, but I'm surprised by how often this sentiment is uttered. Yes, I respect different decisions of casters etc., but we all, everyday johnnys as well, can refrain from working for unethical companies and find other stuff to work. 
---
Putting people in such economic fragility that they fear to fall off the wagon if they employ ethical standards to their work is also a late stage capitalism strategy.
---
Instead, Donate it somewhere to help the protestors out or first responders.
---
That’s not really the argument he’s making. Kibler is saying that you can’t use their platform to promote those views. If a fast food worker tried to lecture everyone about abortion, they’d get fired, too.
---

It's back up again, and they've fully clarified - political posts that are important to the community are allowed in general now, while they were disallowed in general before.
---
Uhm, how's this https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/eyula/day9s_sexual_misadventures/
---
I don't agree. This is exactly how the statement would be worded if they wanted to say 'any country'. If they wanted to specify China, there a plethora of ways for the statement to be made less ambiguous.
---
Blizzard went full Sylvanas "The playerbase means nothing"
---
Its called a shit post.

How about a system that achieves overall economic efficiency using capitalism but also has a social safety set for those who can't afford basic necessities?

---
Blitzchung's statement didn't mention human rights violations, although it did imply connection with them.
---
I'm sure some members of the WBC believe that abortion is a human rights violation.
---
I'm not trying to paint this as a morally-gray issue, just saying that it's hard to have clear and effective rules about it.
---
It will most likely be Activision since Activision sucks Tencents dick and obviously Tencent = China.
---
I just pray that this ban and prize money taking was just a temp panic action and that they are working on amending such actions.
---
People need to understand Activision Blizzard had to act almost immediantly.
---
Thank you. I very much doubt China would actually ban NBA outright (at this stage.) More Chinese watched the NBA finals than people from the US. Banning such a popular activity of young people is how you create unrest within your own country. 
---
Not to say ccp won't take this further. Restricting games, viewing times, limiting chinese partnerships and sponsors etc etc are much more likely outcomes than actually flat out banning it at this stage.
---
Just nationalization is not socialism or communism. The workers owning the means of production is not the same as the state owning the means of production. That just makes the state into the capitalist, in a still capitalist-proletariat relationship.
---
The current Chinese system is State Capitalism, but with "Chinese characteristics" (meaning a more neo-liberal economic policy). It is very far from anything resembling socialism or communism.
---
Brave of them. 
---
It probably sucks to be a low cog in a company that makes crap moves like this.
---
Kibler IS Great
---
Yes but still a rule that he clearly broke, no matter how flexible it is. I don’t know anything about the second part so I won’t comment on that
---
Probably the most poignant and well written comment on this whole matter. Absolute respect.
---
This is becoming big enough that I could imagine at Blizzard, at the top of a very tall building, the owners are having an argument as to whether they remain silent and continue to lose credibility and Western money, or publicly apologize and reverse their actions and thus have to sever all ties with China since China would be outraged by them doing so.
---
From here on Blizzard will either be an American game developer or another Chinese shovelware producer
---
&gt; Do you disagree? 
---
No. You are correct, I do not disagree. I believe this case truly is clear-cut. China is in the wrong.
---
BUT I still agree with Kibler. This was not the time or the place and Blizzard does not have to accomodate you or give you a platform. Yes, the punishment was insane, also agree with him there.
---
HK has been on the news cycle for months now, why is it imperative that Blizzard gets involved and why must they allow anyone a voice on their platform?
---
Blizz is hosting a pro-tourney for one of their videogames. They did not invite Blitzchung for their political ideas, I assure you.
---
And, P.S.
---
&gt;Morality (from Latin: moralis, lit. 'manner, character, proper behavior') is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper.[1] Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a **particular philosophy, religion or culture**, or it can derive from a standard that a person **believes** should be universal.
---
Your values, your morality, might be vastly different than mine for something as simple as geographical location.
---
&gt;We all have morals and we expect everyone, including CEOs and Boards of directors, who have similar morals. We all live in a society with basic human rules
---
How naive, who is we all? Americans? Not even all Americans cherish the same values. Not even "not killing people" is universal. Americans have the death penalty. Get off your high horse.
---
&gt;Most countries, including almost all First World nations, have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice. Notable exceptions are the United States, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and most Islamic states. The United States is the only Western country to still use the death penalty.
---
Should we blindly follow your American values? Do you actually believe you hold the true universal values?
---
And just to be clear, I fully believe this case is clear-cut and I support Blitzchung, but there's a reason he agreed not to use Blizzard's platform in any form other than HS. I mean, Blizzard wants to focus on Hearthstone, the namesake of the tourney, fuck them right?
---
I can't decide to make your business the platform for my ideologies, wether I am truly right or wrong.
---
I absolutely AM rallying against China, but I am not doing it through Hearthstone.
---
Fuck China, fuck Mao, fuck Pooh, liberate Hong Kong.
---
I am 100% sure I would also argue that Zalae would be OK not commenting on The Night if Broken Glass...
---
\&gt;be a commie
---
\&gt; fight against chinese commies 
---
Make up your mind, dude
---
You need to work together to fight international corporations like Blizzard and global imperialism, not to play card games
---
Morals has nothing to do with it.  You're just being an overly emotional SJW.  
---
Better chuck your computer, your shoes, your TVs, half the shit in your house.... all the shit that comes from China.
---
We live in a market with global ramifications and Blizzard works with China.  Blizzard also has shareholders, employees, PLAYERS etc that rely on them to be successful.  Take out the China market and we might not have any tournaments with prize pools, we might not be able to pay GM players who rely on it for rent... we might not have these games anymore.  
---
The white knight soapbox shit needs to end.  I support HK and their people and want the best for them but that's a political issue that has nothing to do with HS.  Blitzchung fucked up when he politicized an event that could have major ramifications on Blizzards business.  Blizzard didn't ask for this, they didn't want to co-sign activism.  They wanted to have a HS tournament, advertise their brand, and pay players in their community.  
---
Holy shit, you people are mindless.
---
Thank u next
---
1. even if you could implement all the reforms you want you can't really fix something that is broken at it's very core.
---
2. The political system and economical system are inseparably tied, to claim one exists interdependently of the other is absolutely absurd. The capitalist system will always create a political situation where those who have the most capital will have the most political sway, and they will inevitably put that power towards further advancing capital.
---
Just don't go. Keep your money and you still get your message across.
---
I am getting ready to leave another 1 star, screen shot it and see what happens.
---
Reddit won't do anything as Tencent invested about a billion and a half into them a few years back. Does not at all mean we shouldn't still try, but Reddit as a company is going to be complicit in this.
---
people like me? there's nothing two faced about what ive said. ive simply stated my disagreeance about their take on the situation and how it is not enough for me to feel comfortable supporting them any further. seems like that is making you upset but there is nothing dishonest about where i am coming from.

&gt; A world in which his MMO doesnt nake a dime will never exist.
---
Firefall shut down after like...two years of questionable design decisions?
---
He definitely did some good work as part of the Classic and WC3 team *as far as I heard*, but Mark Kern is not exactly a developer with a stellar record for amazing triple AAA games. The games he did develop well at Blizzard were a team effort of the entire team, and probably succeeded because of it.
---
So you're just disregarding the fact that the rules, to the letter, state that a player's prize pool would be reduced to $0 in the case where they disrepute a portion of the population?
---
You just wanna ignore that, and say that the right call for blizzard would be to selectively enforce their rules for the viewpoint that you and I think is right?
---
ELI5 for r/all who is Kibler and why is his opinion and stepping down so significant?
---
Exactly right. 
---
80 years ago our grandparents were fighting and dying to save the world from a very similar authoritarian regime. 
---
Now in 2019 companies are censoring themselves and bowing to these regimes just to make money.
---
It’s infuriating. I hope this anger lasts.
---
It’s also really good. One of the better strategies in a deck builder is getting fewer cards in your deck so you find your better ones faster
---
You realize that the entire Chinese internet is monitored and people are toeing the party line right? What people say behind closed doors is far different than what they say publicly under the watchful gaze of censors.
---
Vanished because Venezuela is a socialist country praised by Bernie Sanders, and they want to try exactly the same things in the US
---
Welp we've resorted to name-calling. Guess I found the soft spot. 
---
Look, I'm not taking a side. I don't really care either way, because I don't worry about things I can't change. In the mean-time it is fun to poke and prod at people who do think they are making a difference by throwing tantrum on the internet.
---
Mark was removed because he was driving Firefall into the ground. He literally removed PVP from the game without telling anyone beforehand - people simply logged in one day and it was gone. No other devs or the community folks knew this was coming. He also wasted huge amounts of money trying to push an "eSports mode" and kept forcing folks to remake the base game systems over and over and over.
---
He was a cancer there and thinks he's god's gift to gaming. He's an avowed GamerGater. Don't let him fucking whitewash his past.
---
The poverty, starvation, and totalitarianism metrics.
---
Good idea. Ill screen cap mine too.
---
Then its a dictatorship.
---
The nazis came about the exact same way.
---
I actually quit HS because I felt it was getting boring and lack of new contents, but seeing what blizzard had become,  I am pretty happy about my decision
---
Yeah, for real. This is not their fault. Executives made this happen, not low-level employees.
---
This is a rational thought blizzard had to punish him and the casters, but they went way to far with the punishment and that’s a problem
---
If you really feel strongly about the way blizzard is being run. Uninstall. That's what I'm doing.
---
They kicked their off tank, so they needed another off tank :/ They both played on the account: [Take a look at this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/acpc3y/a_summary_of_the_ellie_events/)
---
Honestly, this post hits the nail on the head exactly. I was really enjoying WoW Classic and when I first heard the news, I unsubbed but having some sub time left I thought I could at least still use it up and I could hope that Blizz would make amends before the time ran out.
---
But then as the day went on and as I looked deeper and deeper into the situation, into Blizzard's response, into the communities response and searched my own feelings, by the time I got home and would normally log in... I just stared at the black screen and felt my very being vehemently opposed to the idea of even opening the bnet app at all...
---
This act by Blizzard... hurts so much, it's been apart of my life for so long now, I can't believe this disgusting corruption could seep into our safe, fantasy world... But that was foolish.
---
It's almost poetic, that this should happen so soon after Blizzard released WoW Classic and in a sense, handed us our childhoods back... for them to do this, to slap us in the face with reality so harshly... drove home better then anything else ever could, that our childhood is long over, and that we cannot hide in the past any longer.
---
I think that if Blizzard had just included "no politics" in their rules and cited that rule instead, there would be nowhere near as much backlash.  The fact that they cited a catch-all rule is where they screwed up.
---
Wow, that's a lot of organs! At Red China for an unlimited time enjoy 30 kidneys for $10.99! What sounds good to you folks tonight? 30 kidneys, please. Great choice! With children's kidneys, men's kidneys, women's kidneys and our fantastic ethnic minority's kidneys, that's FOUR different kinds! 30 kidneys in one ice box just $10.99! And only at one place: Only at Red China. And bootlickers get kidneys too. A complete kidney, just a dollar ninety nine.
---
And what have you done lately? They risk their source of income/livelihood for speaking against blizzard. They are doing the right thing even if it means they could get banned when they could easily just avoid the issue
---
Tldr: grow the fuck up
---
So lets find their extensions and leave the grunts out of it? 7 digit extension number
---
China can go fuck itself and I've unsubbed from all Blizzard games. Having said that, read my fucking reply you dumb fuck. The casters got fired for goating the player into saying something political which is against Blizzard's rules. I disagree with the punishment but you're a literal troglodyte if you don't understand how these things work. Eat a fucking dick my man.
---
&gt;  but Blizz was in the right to penalize him for it to discourage GM being used as a political tool
---
Meh, if you win a tournament you can consider the speech as a prize and you should be able to talk about whatever you want.
---
You can say whatever you want but you cannot do so while standing in my backyard.
---
See above post.
---
&gt;Knowing better would be to use the proper platforms to express your opinions. Taking blizzards platform and using it to attack a huge business partner of blizzards is assinine. The GM of the Rockets used a third party platform on his own personal page to express his opinion. The thing is China is doing so many wrong and downright evil things that people could care less how the message is sent as long as its sent. And everyone wants to jump down blizzards throat. I agree with the message and things the casters and player said i dont agree with using blizzards platform.
---
China/Hong Kong doesn't give people "proper platforms"... Talking about the issue, period, and China/Hong Kong will send detain their citizenry. Even for saying shit online. They have mass surveillance programs that regularly monitor stuff. That's why, before filters got better, you could send Chinese people to jail by sending them certain content within emails. Hell, that might even still stand, but I wouldn't care to test it.
---
Proper Platforms when you're given none is "purposefully obtuse". And blizzard can bleed whatever tiny amount they will for supporting such punitive actions "on behalf of"... The reasons China has such ability to oppress comes down to money. And USA and corporations support China through money. Blizzard is as guilty as any other company.
---
Yeah it's full bandwagon going on. Why are you people boycotting a company with ties to China only now? It's not exactly a new conflict.
---
You make me laugh
---
nobody ever said " KILL CHINESE!". Dude just said "FREE HK".
---
Why the fk someones freedom is their issue?
---
Que suerte hermano. Yo estoy en las mismas. Intentando irme ahora que termine la universidad porque esta vaina no se la aguanta nadie

It is a chinese account run by a chinese person in chinese to a chinese public. This is filtered through the eyes of china. We will likely get a very different statement in english.

---
or you could pull your head out of your ass, realize its all one company playing both sides of the aisle, claiming to cherish western values while at the same time shutting down any and all discussion about anything the chinese dont like.   
---
Fuck blizzard, fuck the CCP, and fuck everyone defending or excusing this.
---
I was offering countries of different government types.
---
What is a country that we should mimic?
---
All the countries I would like to live in seem democratic and capitalistic with select socialistic policies.
---
By definition? Sure, the state owns much of the production. But the reason for it being a shitshow extends far beyond that. Much of it is because it’s also a dictatorship.
---
About the Edit: Kern simply recorded a ten minute video talking into the camera, speaking about Blizzard fans when they were discussing Classic and considering their options in the wake of the Nostalrius shutdown.
---
He did absolutely not *relaunch* Classic or was part of the team. In fact, people criticized him even back then for appearing to use this to try and get a job at Blizzard again after leaving in 2006 to open his own company. That company eventually voted him out for the Firefall thing. That was around the time the Classic debate happened, I believe.
---
His message about how involved China is in the western market is right, but JFC, he has a habit of inserting himself into the "popular" side of internet controversy.
---
The rule he broke is actually a common rule to have and enforce. It allows them discretion to punish people for misconduct that hurts their image so it cannot appear that they support such behavior. When applied fairly its fine. It tells them they should act professional and apolitical.
---
I know it's largely not about separatism - separatism is sometimes discussed, but doesn't have significant support as far as I know. But I'm not exactly a Chinese person.
---
Did you hear what the pro-Beijing people were saying during the protests in Canada? They said "One China, everything else is negotiable". To them, it clearly is a separatism issue. 
---
When you see graffiti on the protest streets saying things like "Hong Kong is not China", protesters coming up with their own national anthem or flying foreign flags, references and entities with ties to China being vandalized, etc. it's pretty easy to misunderstand.
---
Though at this point I would say 'maintaining HK autonomy' is probably not entirely accurate either. The biggest threat to HK autonomy was the extradition bill. Outside of that I haven't really seen any encroachment on their autonomy. More relevant at this point is probably police accountability and greater balance of political representation.
---
&gt;The casters for Riot Games generally refer to teams that have "easy" to say names by the full name regardless, so I highly doubt any of the casters were going to call them "Hong Kong" and not "Hong Kong Attitude."
---
I feel like they called them "Hong Kong" a time or two while watching in the groups stage--and yes, thank you for the correction. I keep making that same mistake, and I'm not sure why!
---
I mean game design choices directly effect them. They stream hearthstone and other games for a living. The hong kong protests, while important, dont directly effect them.
---
Kibler is right. Tournaments are not a platform to announce your politics. The punishment was overboard though.
---
Would you be happy watching all your esports just be a Trump 2020 advert or Orange Man Bad advert every time a player is on camera? We do need spaces where politics is kept out, there is literally no areas in our lives where the political war is not front and center now. A firm stance on politics from Blizz is mandatory regardless of what it is supporting.
---
In all honesty, Blizzard dug themselves a massive hole with how they handled Blitzchung’s expulsion from Hearthstone Grandmasters. They’re gonna have to take a side. They’re damned if they do and they’re damned if they don’t suckle upon the CCP’s teat.
---
Had they given Blitzchung a lighter punishment in the first place like a several match ban and a small fine for breaking their rules and using their event as a political soapbox, they could have certainly saved face with both their Chinese and international audiences and this situation would have blown over. But now, they’ve given Blitzchung the harshest possible punishment. If they back down and renege even one bit, they risk the wrath of the Chinese public and government. It could lead to them getting banned from China outright.
---
On the other hand, they’ve alienated so many of their Western fans that reports on Twitter have shown their website actually buckling from the sheer amount of users unsubscribing and making account removal requests. This is the worst PR disaster that Blizzard’s ever had. It’s so bad that it also led to politicians speaking out against them, which is absolutely not a situation Blizzard want to be in.
---
As for what I think will happen... I see Blizzard issuing a statement in the coming days. They will back down, rescind their ruling against Blitzchung, pay him the $10,000 he’s owed and apologise to their fans. I also see them speaking out in favour of the protests in Hong Kong because they’re likely going to lose the Chinese market anyway.
---
Why do I think Blizzard will do this? Because they honestly have a lot more to lose from alienating their core fans than from pandering to China, especially when the spotlight is shining upon them harder than the NBA. Anything other than a full 180 on their stance will come across as insincere.
---
Cool, but people are well within their rights to hold it against them later. "Where were you?" will be a legitimate question as the suppression of HK escalates.
---
I'd relate it to all the whitehouse aides and officials that refuse to rock any boats, blow any whistles, or even testify in a lawful Congress setting. They're making a choice with (at best) inaction, and when this administration is over and through, they'll deserve to be judged for it. They're just looking out for themselves and their career prospects, but we as the people don't need to be putting what *they personally want* (financial security) over what we ourselves want (accountability).
---
Being on the wrong side of history isn't inconsequential, and nobody should get a pass for trying to take the easy way as far as they think it can go before it would backfire.
---
Then again, half the people are kinda forced into working in sweatshops and cheap factories.
---
Is that socialism?
---
That's not been my experience from my co-workers. They have been firmly against the HK protesters. They believe that they are rioting criminals hurting people and destroying property. Many have said their mainland friends who were in HK have fled out of fear and that people who are identified as from the mainland are in danger. Don't shoot the messenger. This is simply what I'm hearing from them. I'm sure there are also many who are pro-HK too.
---
I didn't say I was brave you dumb cunt.   
---
Fuck off with your character assassination bullshit you fucking shill.
---
I may actually be in China next year on business. Tell you what, I f I do, I'll send you a message and let you know my thoughts. I don't want to be prejudiced against any idea without a thorough examination.
---
I appreciate your thoughtfulness in your responses. My concern is that those regimes that whitewash history and control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable to say about a government are in a great position to increase manipulation of the masses as technology advances. My worry is that this will only get worse.
---
I'm sure their government is not a major issue for the vast majority of Chinese citizens. But stifling free thought is never a net positive.
---
Not to mention Blizzard firing two Taiwanese casters essentially just for being on screen (they even tried to duck out of the screen when Blitzchung made his statement). Last we checked Taiwan still has freedom of speech too. Hope they file for wrongful termination and sue the hell out of Blizzard.
---
Not allowed in the EU. They have consumer rights against disabling easy access to cancel things like subscriptions.
---
This isnt helpping calm things down lol
---
No, you're mindless.
---
It's not about being a SJW, if you knew me you'd know how against SJW culture I am, but you don't. You're just being a boring contrarian who thinks your viewpoint earns you respect, but realistically you should not support allowing China to censor companies in the west. It's bigger than Blitzchung and your smallmindedness speaks volumes.
---
If you are okay with China telling your country and companies how to act, then your judgement is already questionable, but if you don't draw a line here, then there's nothing to stop them getting braver and imposing their will further.
---
You are mindless. Literally all you see is "lol SJW", when everyone else is seeing a literal invasion of rights from overseas.
---
You are a stupid person, and I won't respond to you further, because you being a contrarian is lame to begin with, but in regards to this particular issue, it's more than lame. It's borderline enablement.
---
No system is the best at everything.
---
Capitalism is great for individual choice, social mobility, and efficiently solving a whole lot of economic problems.
---
It tends to struggle with inequality, 'tragedy of the commons' scenarios with the environment, and in situations where consumers have no choice (healthcare, important services owned by a monopoly, etc.). So, you have to constantly update the rules to avoid exploitation and bad-faith stuff.
---
This is why a lot of nations favor e.g. a market economy for most goods with socialized healthcare, infrastructure, military, etc.
---
You can swap in alternative economic systems but they all have their own problems. Capitalism is great at what its good for, it just-so-happens that it's not the best model for all things at all times.
---
I'd hate to have a strictly-capitalist healthcare system or an unregulated market, but I'd also hate to buy my games and groceries from a planned economy where some bureaucrat tells me what I am allowed to consume and in what quantity.
---
So, no, the trick is not to 'get rid of capitalism', its to update it where we can and to switch models in the cases where capitalism sucks.
---
This needs to be bigger news - China blatantly attacking businesses IN OTHER COUNTRIES that disagree with them.
---
As usual the Australian government will do nothing in response, lest they risk China not buying our ores, and meat any more. I don't normally stick up for Trump, but at least he's doing SOMETHING about China. More countries need to follow America's lead in that regard, and stand up to China.
---
Well, I suppose they could just cut ties with NetEase, exit the Chinese market, cancel *Diablo: Immortal* (co-developed with NetEase), and probably generate an insane amount of goodwill in the West.
---
About a snowball's chance in hell of happening, but I don't think mainland China makes up such a large amount of their revenue that it would be *completely* outlandish.
---
This wasn't for karma. I hate the direction Blizzard is going and was quitting the game anyway, so I decided to do it in public to spread awareness and publicize my taking part in the Blizzard boycott.
---
That means society has problem with morality being changed. Do you have a problem with the fact that slavery is banned now? If you don’t, then would you have a problem if we went back to legalising slavery? How do you determine which one is correct?
---
Morality being subjective isn’t lazy straw man, it is the fundamental idea on which China is operating. It is the foundation on which claims like “you worry about your life, I’ll worry about mine” are established. Blizzard choosing money over morals could be argued to be morally correct decision, depending on your definition of morality. Or are you saying Western morality is superior to eastern morality? It’s starting to sound like Britain invading India for the sake of Christianity’s superior moral values, doesn’t it.
---
Lost the company drawing and had to do the token protest.

They didn't egg him on. What's the point of spreading misinformation?

The only thing they're guilty of is not stopping him. The casters and producer knew it was going to be said.

Don't forget the posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df29ry/ive_played_hs_every_day_for_about_4_years_now) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfkm8f/do_the_mods_actually_moderate_this_sub).

The quote "*I don't care about political drama half the world away, I just want a fun game to play on my commute*" is particularly telling.
---
Illegal and subject to heavy fines in the EU. If that affects you folks in the EU, start reporting them.
---
I don't know what the rules are or what the players have been told. And had they have done a slap or the wrist and a fine with the message that they did not want their competition used for as a political platform I would have been accepting of that.
---
But for them to come down so harshly on the player, especially for the rule they quoted which was very vague, feels to me like they were trying to make an example.
---
You are welcome to feel however you like but personally, I am no longer going to support a company that would act in this manner.
---
Can’t bait someone because of your shitty trolling? /u/fondanoreo has the solution: just write a painfully obvious gaslighting comment pretending like you successfully triggered someone.
---
Um just to chime in whilst were boycotting don't forget that Destiny isn't a part of Activision after bungie split with them so yay go bungie!
---
Yes but they are using Blizzards platform to catapult their message and Blizzard would be basically allowing it. That is not being politically neutral.
---
You know that all the stuff you're posting about in this tirade applies to the United States, right? Our country was built on atrocities. Our country is still committing atrocities. Yet we all get up and go back to work. We play video games. We relax. We take care of ourselves. When we can, we sacrifice, and we fight back against those atrocities.
---
If you have the power to improve the world, you should do it. But you have to take care of yourself, too. I can't blame people for not just walking away from their livelihoods. Everyone has their limit and I encourage them to fight to better the world with as much power as they can until they reach that limit. 
---
It's easy to sit here on a message board and rant about what other people should do, but it's a lot harder to get off your ass and take action yourself. Protest. Raise money and donate it. Raise awareness with the people you actually have clout with, and not just Reddit. Make a sacrifice.
---
It's not review bombing if the parent company's behavior actually affects your enjoyment of the game, to the point where you don't feel comfortable playing it. There are people who straight up no longer enjoy HearthStone because of this incident, why shouldn't they uninstall a game they won't play again?
---
According to the GDPR in the EU this is illegal to do.
---
I get the sense you were also there when Firefall died, friend? Curious if I ever played with you - IGN was the same as my Reddit name.
---
I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to get involved. The way Blizzard is right now is extremely violatile. It's not worth axing your stream over.
---
Can't assume anymore. Go to any Chinatown in North America and you're just as likely to find someone vehemently pro-CCP as someone anti-CCP. Or look at Hungary and Poland, two countries that should know from their history how awful authoritarianism is and yet tore down their democratic foundations.
---
Such as the values of blizzard and the card packs they sell
---
How are the characters? Part of what I love about heroes, is all the different and unique characters. How no two feel the same, and you got the funky ones like abathur, samuro, the lost Vikings, etc

Flair it and automod shouldn't get it.

I read your explanation. Saying countries in Africa and the Middle East support their treatment of minorities isn’t saying much. 
---
That’s like asking a bunch of barbarians if raping and pillaging is okay. Of course they’re for it. You see what I’m saying?
---
We do talk about the problems in our own countries. Just because we face challenges at home doesn’t mean we can’t call out atrocities abroad. We’re all just people on one rock, we need to band together. 
---
I’d like for you to expand on how what’s going on in the camps is exaggerated.

Their only link to the world is hearthstone?

Well, no, actually. The government isn't even allowed to make rules like that because they are too vague to know what they cover. That rule could be used to punish someone for anything. They could take away someone's prize money for wearing a shirt that is red and green because it offended colorblind people. There is no way to know in advance what it covers other than it's completely arbitrary and up to Blizzard's discretion, and they used that discretion to give him the maximum punishment to appease China. This wasn't about rule enforcement, it was about politics and money, plain and simple.

Yes. This is the company that runs *Hearthstone* in mainland China. It's also on what is essentially the government-approved social media platform.

At this stage though, doing the right thing can't negate the fact they did the wrong thing with full knowledge at the time that it was objectively the wrong thing to do. Hell, the only reason they'd now be trying to do the right thing is because they've realised there are consequences beyond their expectations when they do the wrong thing.

Pretty sure that’s the way it’s always been

China is astronomically worse than anything the USA or their companies do. Stop the whataboutism. The Chinese are sending in plainsclothes vigilantes to beat citizens, harvesting organs, trying to control or annihilate all religions within their nation and have consistently abused the people of Hong Kong, Tibet and others. They need to be stopped, like across the world MORE people need to bring up the politics of China in "unrelated" areas, there needs to be a grand understanding that if we don't do anything soon they'll not only be doing that shit over there, but they'll continue to exert more and more control over our media in the West.

China is quite literally a dystopian nightmare come to life.
---
Its spineless as fuck to reduce literal genocide to being a “political discussion”. It’s disgraceful and a slap in the face to human lives. Human lives are not political.
---
Martin Luther King Jr. had something to say not specifically on voting but I think the same message applies.
---
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
---
Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.
---
The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.
---
The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.
---
The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.
---
We will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
---
Pity may represent little more than the impersonal concern which prompts the mailing of a check, but true sympathy is the personal concern which demands the giving of one’s soul.
---
Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.
---
The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: “If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?” But… the good Samaritan reversed the question: “If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?”
---
In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
---
***He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.***
---
History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.
---
Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness.

Understandable. He just wants to prevent his chat from being a spam fiesta.
