no idea, but saving your gold for a maybe might be worth it then regretting it.

White Eyes and The Storm Guardian. I love Pandarian flavor, and this card (and the token) are top-notch. All of the Jade Lotus related legendaries are great, especially Aya and Kun, but White Eyes is definitely my favorite.
---
Really? He left to work on capeshit mobile games? ugh
---
How's Overwatch doing?
---
Twisting Nether is worse by a landslide. It doesn’t play around Deathrattles and doesn’t put a bunch of nonsense back into your opponent’s deck, making topdecks worse. 
---
Fair enough. I was just wondering if the play style would become different as players would need to either chose to hero power or to play a card from their deck. Thus making the deck a bit more diverse in it's play. As opposed to "oh an odd deck, turn two hero power", etc.
---
Regardless of how you feel about Brode (and I have my qualms), his message seemed like the best touch point to add a human dimension to the recent layoffs on the Hearthstone team. I feel terrible for everyone affected, but I didn’t want to focus unwanted attention on any of them while they’re in a rough spot.
---
Definitely and probably always will be Nefarian! 
---
Tried the Corpsetaker secret paladin and, while I'm no where remotely close to as good as I'm sure the creator is with it, I'm having a real hard time seeing how it operates unless you get some really good Favors. Bellringer Sentry in particular: I assumed it buffed Secretkeeper but it doesn't. It's one thing when Challenger thinned your deck by 5 and gave you a colossal follow up turn with multiple forms of protection from minion attacks into Competitive Spirit but most of the secrets seem not worth ever casting from hand costing a card, even buffing the Secretkeeper and Sentry only (immediately) thins the deck by 1.
---

---
Maybe I should try the non-Corpsetaker version as I was drawing my Thrallmar far too often and a 3/3 DS taunt for 4 isn't too hard to deal with on their turn unless I'm way ahead anyway.
---
Anyone who played it have any insight as to how the secret package fairs better than just a standard aggro/tempo/odd deck?
---
Gorgeous art and amazing sound. The best part is that those all see play.
---
I wouldn't say Anduin or Uther are really problematic because of infinite value, and certainly not Thrall and Garrosh. Anduin's strong, sure, but it's his *burst damage potential* that makes him strong. .
---
Best case scenario is everyone happy. None of these things are that. 
---
Who doesnt love a powerful dragon? I love how his voice line changes based on the class your opponent is.
---
Apex Legends?
---
Or in miracle if you run out of auctioneers
---
This is a subreddit about a mobile game
---
I'm personally more fond of post about defeating The Whisper with a rock.
---
Yeah technical buffed when players complained and got the beast pool to include new beasts
---
I really like the one Darius Crowley has... Idk it just feels epic
---
Hearthstone was originally desktop only, or were you unaware of that?
---
And fun is the only thing worth having.
---
It's matchup dependent. At 7 mana, Twisting Nether would be almost as played as Scream if it were a Priest card. 
---
Priest ruining an aggro deck's draws and avoiding Deathrattles are a bonus. The real power of the card is that it's an unconditional boardwipe. 
---
I wonder how Rexxar got through an entire rotation without any nerf... It is ridiculous. 
---
At least it isn't capeshit
---
Jesse J. Hill was one I saw on MMO-Champion. Who else is he known by?
---
Not great. Stagnant I believe was the word they used 
---
Maybe he wanted more board presence, maybe he's just dumb, who knows. Why are people down voting the OP for explaining his opponent's misplay?
---
[removed]
---
&gt;Why is there no mention of mid range?
---
Because Midrange changes between Aggro and "control" depending on what deck its facing
---
&gt; What about fatigue? 
---
What about it? So far, Fatigue has either been a Togwaggle+Naturalize/Coldlight+Shadowstep COMBO deck or a shitty no winconditiopn CONTROL deck
---
&gt; What about Mill? 
---
See above
---
&gt; What about some type of deck we haven't thought of yet?
---
Well, the deck doesnt exist yet so why give a shit? I dont think your entire argument rests on some concept you havent even figured out yourself, does it?
---
&gt; Why is the rock paper scissors approach the way the meta needs to be?
---
Its not an approach, its a theoretical way the meta always turns out based on the available deck types so far (which, by the way, holds true for pretty much every card game to date). 
---
Right now, you can go pretty far with any number versions of Hunter or Odd Paladin. If you need card suggestions, I'd check out HSReplay.
---
...but as far as crafting goes, just keep in mind that Journey, Knights, and Kobolds are all going to rotate out of standard by mid-April.
---
class based shooters were a thing for like, almost a decade before overwatch's release. How is it a "flavor a of the month" genre?
---
Probably Zilliax.  Just please don't go Chameleos if you are trying to win.
---
Took forever for Warrior and in the end only won cause the AI went stupid but I’ll take what I can get
---
Well technically next year is going to be a lot worse with all the things that happened this year. 
---
Good news, doesn't seem many, if any, devs are getting hit. Bad news, 99% of those who are being hit are from the Blizzard side.
---
We have Geist for Counterplay. What makes it annoying is that if you play Geist they still have Topsy Turvy
---
Where did you get these winrate from? I cant see secret pally , wall priest, secret odd mage and many others anywhere in high winrates on hsreplay.net
---
Yeah, I love blizzard games and all the CMs I've "worked" with, but they get worked to the bone.
---
learning politics from a video game reviewer 😎
---
They existed before TF2 back in Q1 days but outside of the peak of Tribes or TF2's popularity they weren't huge. Overwatch was still a good game imo.
---

---
I have been playing since beta, but have never received at least 1 ordinary.
---
Cheating? I never fight fair!
---
They are ENORMOUS problems. The only reason they are currently not dominating the game is the extremely powerful cards in koft and kobolds that can compete with them, come rotation they will be all you will see. They are probably the worst designed cards in the game as they promote doing the same thing repetitively and are almost impossible to change in any reasonable way. That last fact is especially frustrating as they very f2p friendly and some people’s whole collections are built around them. I thought these nerfs I suggested would be received better than what I would do if I worked at blizz. Which Is say we fucked up on their designs, ban the cards, And give double a full refund for each.
---
Nah I actually have 2 regular preps and 2 goldens. I just have 8k dust and not much that I'm dying to spend it on so I decided to hoard all of my extra copies of cards because I don't have a pressing need to disenchant them. 
---
&gt;Because to many investing firms it isn't about the profit as much as it is about the profit growth. If they 1.0B in profit and then 1.1B in profit this year they only see that as a .1B growth and want more.
---
not just investors, most people prefer having more money
---
Yes, awfully designed cards deserve to be killed.
---
This was pretty much what it was like lastly off when I lost my job
---
fucking kek
---
Wich Hunter Deck play Dire Frenzy? Midrange?
---
Not exactly. Work is a means, money is the end (or a fungible proxy). Most people prefer money and work is the most obvious vector. 
---
But what is the alternative to free market?
---
Blizzard higher ups.
---
***D E F E N D   G I L N E A S***
---
What's the cheapest deck on this list I could make with the most recent cards? 
---
&gt; Vicious Scalehide
---
If this card weren't a beast I think Rexxar would lose 10% more games.
---
it's designed to let anyone beat pro player. xD
---
I played a ton of Even Shaman a week before the patch hit. I got probably close to 75 Shaman wins in. I'm something like 48 away from a golden portrait.
---
Haven't tried it since. I've been too busy to do more then the minimum number of games necessary for my dailies since.
---
This is still better than the time, I had 2 crystalinne Oracle's only to steal deadly poison twice.
---
Next reset. In a few hours.
---
&gt;t board wipe that isn't named Holy Nova, so that we aren't seeing all these attempts at printing a new and improved Reset Button every few sets, but I don't have the strength for it right now. In any event I don't think anyone actually wants to see what happens to Hearthstone when board wipes stay poorly costed, not even Firebat
---
Fun card? Of course for the hunter player, every turn you have another bomb to drop, or a minion that is likely to deal with any challenges the board present to you.
---
No.
---
oof. let me clarify, any counters that won't cost me an arm and a leg?
---
Not necessarily. They want revenue growth and real investors know percentage gains decrease over time, but it’s close enough. 
---
The entire system is based on performance relative to an expectation that comes from a figure both carefully calculated and yet completely arbitrary so that the *perception of future growth* makes the stock price tick ever higher. 
---
If any of the players actually cared, we'd get a mass movement to skip the next xpac or two to show Activision what we think of the scummy topics.   Sadly, I think most of the players are more interested in shiny new cards than right or wrong.  Otherwise EA would be nothing but a bad memory from 10+ years ago.
---
Actually a few people on the Hearthstone community side got laid off. Jesse Hill, Zerinah, TheLyns are the ones I found on twitter. 
---
full communism right now before the planet puts us out of our misery
---
One man can’t use the singular of months
---
The problem is too many games are trying to force E-Sports onto the community and take full control of it to promote their games.
---
The most successful e-sports communities are those that formed organically with no help from the developer, like Starcraft 1, which makes it especially ironic that Blizzard doesn't get that.
---
One of the problems with e-sports is how they eat up developer time to, and can drive balance changes because of how the pro's play rather then how everyone else of much lower skill levels play. 
---
You can have markets in a non-capitalist system. Markets predate capitalism, and they’ll exist long after capitalism has been replaced. The first step to a post-capitalist society is the make businesses into worker coops that place value on creating an environmentally sustainable business along with balancing the concerns of its workers. 
---
Oh really? The truth has been hidden from me for for over 200 boss fights!
---
That's the secret part of her Battlecry: Gain sweet frozen booby
---
good to know, thanks man
---
Capeshit?
---
Not crap, but much more easily countered. Also hunter is also meh in a format with aggro decks that can kill you by turn 3
---
&gt; You make choices like this one, cutting into product quality and destroying your long term profit. So you make more in 2019 and 2020, but then your company is mortally wounded, customers are pissed at the drop in product quality, and A-list talent won't work for you anymore. So Blizzard languishes and dies a slow painful death.
---
That doesnt make any sense. If those people were essential to you making more money, why didn't you make more money?
---
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't OWL doing good numbers?  Haven't particularly kept up with it so I could be wrong but ya lol. 
---
He can come across as quite abrasive fairly often, pretty preachy at others. I remember on one of his videos, I believe it was fallout 4 related, he was talking about how in the game how you could (or should? I don't even remember how it works honestly) sleep with multiple party members at the same time and he went on some crazy tangent about how he's polyamorous and how he feels monogamy in games is an outdated concept and stuff. I dunno, he just seems incredibly preachy tbh, he's like that a lot. I don't disagree with him when it comes to most financial stuff, but everything else... eh.
---
I'm also honest enough to admit that the way he looks, dresses and sounds does not help my opinion.
---
I don't play much Overwatch. But from what I have played, I gotta give it credit for completely overhauling the team based shooter formula.
---
I never heard this about EA.
---
Missing like 9 legendaries total. Most junk classic legendaries that never see play. Can make any viable deck. Probably sunk in a grand or two over a few years. Totally worth it though, I enjoy the game, and play it everyday.  Someone has to give them money so the f2p deadbeats can continue playing and complaining on the subreddit about how expensive it is.
---
Play priest, or warrior, or druid, or mage (Debatable) or Paladin, or shaman with heals, or warlock.
---
Rogue and hunter are literally the only 2 classes in the game without somewhat viable at least tier 3 control decks.
---
I really don't see how an Overwatch BR would even work. It doesn't seem to fit with the game's mechanics at all. 
---
I got back into Hearthstone shortly after Un'goro came out, and the hype I saw for KFT was unlike any other set. I think it mostly had to do with the Death Knights and their absurd power level.
---
I don't think you know what capitalism is? Do you mean laissez faire? "Market economies" are a sub-type of capitalist society. Even mixed economies are still capitalist with public ownership. Also your "first-step" is kind of a load of crock as it doesn't discuss any monetization and it seems you mean seize the means of production. The fact is whether people realize it or not you always have a flow of utility and power whether split politically or not. Balancing the concerns of its workers while be environmentally sustainable is asking for people to just be different.

I was just trying to reply (simply) to the idiot putting profit growth of investors/board over the "means" of 800 working class people. Ideally we would have a universal basic income.
---
That’s technically an externality of a bunch of factors. 
---
But what really is the answer? Say you take away private ownership and means of production and you give it to one entity. Who do you trust? 
---
Ok this is epic 👌Make it so when u use ur hero power it increases the mana cost one of the cards in hand Wave goodbye to balance Kowalski☺️😔☺️😔🙏🙏🙏🙏
---
I really don't think they are that bad. Sure they are meta-warping, but not nearly as meta warping as say, the Death Knights. If I remember correctly, Genn in particular has only been in 2 high tier decks. 
---
Pro tip: play only ranked, Its the same tier 1 decks, but you still get progress towards the golden portraits if oyu win
---
The problem isn't that Blizzard wasn't making money, it's that it wasn't making ENOUGH money to appease shareholders/investors. More here: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/apzmqd/ben_brode_on_twitter_heard_the_news_about_layoffs/egckaez/

---
 *Tiny flies, flee before me!* 
---
&gt; broadly people are still logging into the game, but they're spending less money. 
---
I think most have realised that spending even $100 gets you, well, almost nothing, maybe 1-2 good decks, so if you spend at all it'd have to be $300+. And no one can justify that.
---
Guldan is pretty par for the course on 10 mana cards. Voidlord is what makes it insane
---
Sorry for misreading what you said. That’s my fault. To address your real point, innovation is not the result of capitalists taking risks. Innovation happens because governments fund research projects, and people then use the fruits of that research to create innovations. Vaccines, computers, the internet, the technology for smartphones, etc, were all created by government researchers. Companies then took those creations and make great products with them, but governments are required for that initial research because there’s not guarantee that the research will pan out to be profitable. And most companies can’t dedicate years of work to projects that may not ever be profitable. 
---
Geist and Mastermojo 
---
...Hunter has a ton of way to recover from behind, what are you talking about? Unleash the Hounds, Springpaw, Flanking Strike, Rexxar, Hunter's Mark; all of these are tools to recover the board and are very good at it as well. Don't forget about Zul'Jhin and Rhok'Delar for a ton of extra fuel instantaneously. Maybe if you were referring to 2016 Hunter then sure but you are seriously mistaken if you think Hunter is the worst class for recovering from behind.
---
Also, the person is getting shit on because the Hunter, who is clearly out of fuel at this point, is able to super high roll the perfect minion and get the perfect adaptations on top of that to secure a 0-counterplay victory. There's no skill involved in it, it's purely luck. 
---
Wait how?

ITT: Hearthstone players misunderstanding valuing cash flow and giving investing advice
---
It is by design. Adam Smith, the founder of capitalism himself, talked extensively about how monopolies would form and how action was needed by governments to make sure competition was kept in place. Monopolies result in income inequality and in a capitalist class of a few wealthy individuals that are able to exert control of a country’s political apparatus. 
---
If they keep an innervate they can do it same turn. Skulking geist right after or literally anything before togwaggle though. OR a card that stops those last couple spells.
---
Theres 3 types of decks in hearthstone at some point or another
---
Aggro 
---
Control/midrange with the death knight included 
---
Bad decks
---
Google says he’s worth 7 billion. I just found out how to afford the 800 workers.

What are these obvious and plentiful solutions then?

Wow that looks awesome man keep up the good work.
---
Ah lol. Wusste mich mal das es da deutsche Webseiten gibt 😅. Danke
---
/r/Titlegore 
---
Maly rogue
---
Aggro kingsbane
---
They're not available because they are **EXCLUSIVE** to a certain event. Why can't people ever seem to understand that concept. If you think it's fair to put these in the store imagine how the people who originally bought these skins are going to feel now that their exclusive can be bought for $20 in the store. 
---
Maly rogue. Such easy wins everytime. Also one of the most uninteractive matchups. 
---
I mean, in this case it *is* skill to recognize that you wouldn’t be likely to win with that hand and to play for the highest chance of winning.
---
King made almost as much money as Blizzard last quarter so probably
---
That's literally the opposite of how layoffs work.
---
I work in Europe. There are a lot of laws which protect the employee. How can they just fire people without paying enormous compensation fees? Or this a specific for the gaming industry, I heard the situation there was very grim for the everyday worker?
---
A true master keeps the mouth out of ear distance and I can read lips.
---
Hahahahaha did the cavalcade of bad decisions have repercussions BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Bloodreaver Gul'dan now costs 11 mana (up from 10)
---
Pfttt more like 9 damage snipe 
---
How did he finish it so quickly? 
---
Pray he doesn't have a heal + silence (T3 &amp; T4).
---
Has a title like this ever been used in a non sarcastic way in the history of this subbreddit? Tells you something about the game.
---
&gt; Who exactly are these investors we always hear about? Is it me? I invest in the S&amp;P500 which includes Activision.
---
That depends how exactly you invest in the S&amp;P500. It's possible that you use a fond system that is managed by an investment firm that is pushing for layoffs. In that case, yes it would be you because your proxy is telling them to fire people. You could also buy shares by yourself and not be responsible or even work for them to keep people on.
---
So depending on how exactly you invest it might very well be that you indirectly are pushing to fire people without ever saying so. In the end it's mostly investment firms pushing for stuff like this although they do it on behalf of their customers that want to make as much money as possible.
---
True that. Gotta go for it when you got it 
---
Does this mean they finished Overwatch 2 AND SACKED THE POOR WORKERS FOR MAKING THE GAME!!!!
---
##COME FORTH COWARD!
---
Pretty sure everybody the consensus in the community was that the HGC was pretty cool
---
Of course I'd love to get more for my money too, but that's not the point here. The guy above said it like it was some kind of revelation. As if people have suddenly realized that the game is expensive and that's why they've decided to spend less now. I've been on this sub for over 5 years now and believe me, people knew from the beginning. 
---
Plus, saying that spending $100 will get you maybe 1-2 good decks is false. It would be true if you had no cards at all and disenchanted everything from the packs you've bought. Spreading false information and overdramatizing is not a good way to make a change.
---
Funglemancer.
---
Instant include in most aggro decks. Has one of the highest winrates of any card. Without this card aggro decks would lose ste after turn 6 but this pushes their midrange game a lot.
---
when shitposting about the game is more fun than the current state of the game
---
How are hunters dying?
---
The only change in hunters I noticed was that they play 2 instead of 4 different decks. Winrate and encounter rate nearly unchanged
---
So your point is even though hots is a good esport, it has a small community? 
---
It's hard to imagine any game that could be considered a good esport published under a company that has as big an audience as blizzard does not having players. It's not impossible, but don't you think that indicates the game was not suitable as an esport?
---
Want me to be honest?
---
You don't speak for all of us.
---
To battle!
---
Blizzivision laying off while having record profits. Lmao cunts. 
---
- **stop grinding ladder.** 
---
 Frustration comes from those games. You're not a pro. You're not a streamer.  You don't owe Legend every month to no one. Get to rank 5 and get off.
---
- **start building meme decks.**
---
I've started tinkering with Treant Treespeaker Druid and I'm having a blast. It's super fun, it's not a shitty deck like Freeze Shaman. Yes, you would win 5-6 games in a row. Other decks can still be made, like: Deathrattle Rogue with Undatakah and Mechanical Dragon; Quest Warlock, Mecha'thun Warrior with BoomShip and Malygos; Big Spell Mage with double Geist to fuck over combo decks.
---
- **Play Casual**. 
---
Casual is the king mode for plenty of reasons. You don't face purely meta decks, you win more and you feel better. You win more and you make more gold per month, so that at the next expansion you have more packs to open. You can literally farm 30 wins a day with a meme deck in casual if you want to.
---
Awesome!
---
[I thought we have particular subreddit to discuss about this](r/hearthstonemeta)
---
Which is insane to me, because in my mien Blizzard has never been worse. 
---
There are couple good passives for jades: battlecry, deathrattle, double health, (extra mana crystal, maybe lower spell cost could work?). Win condition is just surviving and sustaining board before your jades are big enough. 
---
Yes and from those 2, none are tier 1 anymore and in 2 months they lose their best cards.
---
Not even 2 months ago, they had 4 decks, 3 of which was tier 1.
---
Congrats OP! I’m proud of you and don’t you forget it! 
---
So they shouldn't have made Hearthstone? That was a pretty large departure from Blizzard's other games...
---
A single card that can shutdown both of them, while people still limited themselves because of the restriction attached to the deck building in the first place? No thank you.
---
We’re finally coming off power creep in the next rotation, we don’t need more swingy bullshit cards like that in the game.
---
Either HoF them both and give HS a clean slate in the new year, or simply modify/tune the problematic Baku HP’s (which are truly only Warrior and Paladin) while also taking the rest into account when designing the new sets so they don’t become even more of an issue.
---
Does it limit their design space for another year? Sure. But the should’ve thought of that before printing them in the first place.
---
I did same gesture, at the same time as Thijs too.
---
Bruh, the deck tour encounter vary with your will rate. If you play mostly meta decks, you will encounter those.
---
The exact moment I built Even Rogue, I was matched up against Odd Priest and shiet.
---
I'm afraid that I can't find the source right now, but one of the devs said that it wasn't the case and they were't aiming at a lower power level because of that. Of course, it might not have been exactly true.
---
It's a common theory that I also leaned towards, but after finding that out I'm not sure. I'll add the source to this comment if I find it.

Like every single solution people have come up with, in the 15+ daily threads about them.
---
When all that really needs to happen, is a slight Baku HP’s tweaks here and there.
---
Ok, buddy. Whatever you say.
---
I'd also argue that the layoffs don't have anything to do with Hearthstone's revenue
---
It's just plain stupid. But what you can be sure is that they have no reason to be desperate for money.
---
Marrowgraw can be a pain.
---
Depending on how strong your collection is, a reliable way to take him down is probably to build a board-centric midrange/control warrior deck. 
---
Throw in cards that grow, such as Frothing Berserker, Gurubashi Berserker and Festeroot Hulk and hide them behind taunts. Cobalt Scalebane, Bonemare and Fungalmancer can bolster your board and give you the damage needed for lethal.
---
The „wrong” people? What exactly makes them the wrong people?
---
Lol, well done - love it. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DWaVEbmiw0&amp;t=2s

No, nobody from the dev team (design, art, fx, tech etc) was touched.

A whole bunch from the community team and a few from esports were though. Most of Zeriyah's (Christina Mikkonen) team is gone.

Just Use Myracle, it’s being slept on.

Yes, the streak stays
---
Yes it does

Like an episode of Yugioh

If you change Simulacri to Facelesses, you can be a bit more precise about your copy target. Rag for example is also a nice target. 
---
The rest of the classic set.

They are getting severance pay for the next month.

I'll just cheer my UCI on from the sidelines. 
---
Ah, that´s what Blizzard is wasting their time with! catering to feminists and PC-Types.
---
Yeah, I'm not really a fan of any of the quest warrior decks: they tends to create very repetitive games for both the opponent and the pilot.
---
You don't have to assume Any longer ;) 
---
The rewards I get turn me off enough to not want to open another pack because I know I'll get same cards anyways
---
The only way is dusting all the cards Everytime they rotate, and even then you will need to play a lot to farm gold for new expansions
---
Candy Crush: Immortal
---
They did in the EU post: https://playhearthstone.com/en-gb/blog/22868200/celebrate-lunar-new-year-2019
---
It’ll end at 10am Pacific 14 February. 
---
If you can somehow prove you were retaliated against for taking PTO or reporting someone for harassment. Or if you can prove you're being discriminated against for race, sex, etc. 
---
The problem is it can be incredibly difficult to prove any of that. They won't say "we're firing you because you actually use your time off or because you reported the creep who was stalking you". They'll sweep that under the rug and fire you later for being 2 minutes late or for general "cost cutting" that only happens to target "troublemakers". 
---
I feel people are confused about capitalism and the stock market in the US. No one is bitching about the capitalism of their local Chinese restaurant, it's always the large scale publicly traded companies. 
---
I feel like on turn 11 you overcommitted with playing the toxicologist. Without it on board you had lethal even if he played Guldan and cleared the ticket scalper with bone mare. By playing it you only made his board clears better
---
Tldr; my advice is to think more about your opponents best plays instead of always going for maximum board presence/Mana efficiency
---
What if they added a requirement that the deck not only start odd/even, but it stays odd/even. 
---
Then you can introduce tech cards like weasel tunneler in both odd and even formats as a counter. It’ll be just like the ‘no duplicates’ trigger, it turns off when the deck fails the check and turns back on if and when the deck passes. 
---
Probably more fair to do that after Scream rotates though. 
---
dammit, card, never give power to a mad man
---
I can't tell, are you referring to the woooosh or lack of sound?
---
Even more reason for them to learn code! 
---
How do you try changing it? It might sound stupid but even that I had before every deck set to another cardback I sat after the Hakkar autoswap 5 mins like an idiot to figure out I had to slide the cardback into the cardbackslot and that it wouldn't work by simply clicking.
---
I hope they fired some of hearthstone balance team
---
Pepega 7 clearly an axe
---
but this would floor the 3 drop category. Sindragosa is a good curve  there
---
The lines are the best part of the game, why do you play with no sound?
---
Most companies base their staffing off how many employees they need not how much money they make (i.e. you don't hire or keep employees to sit around a twiddle their thumbs just because you have the money to do it).
---
It sounds like that Blizzard is not working many new, large development projects, is focusing more on mobile games which have smaller development teams, and have many legacy products like WoW (or even Hearthstone) which are going more and more into maintenance where larger development teams are not required.
---
Oh yeah like what i'm saying is so outlandish "Blizzard Fannnnn"...
---
They killed Starcraft with there stupid money grabbing expansions...
---
They botched diablo3 and then they crapped all other the franchise with a mobile release by a 3rd party.
---
They killed HS the golden goose by power creeping the hell out of the cards.
---
Overwatch is just another FPS.
---
HOTS is a mess nobody is really interested in.
---
Blizzard has destroyed it's legacy... It badly needs a new hit. So yeah "blizzard fan" you tell me who isn't credible.
---
lul
---
The only thing amazing here is the level of your naivety.
---
You can check HSreplay or tempostorm for good decks. Midrange Hunter is a good cheap place to start. A few sets are rotating to wild. So I'd wait with crafting too many expensive cards.  
---
It also depends on the type of deck and style you like to play. Aggro? Or maybe control.  
---
But I'd start with midrange hunter. And with only badic, common and rare cards at first.  
---
And you can check Hearthpwn.com for budget decks. 
---
Activision Blizzard.  You'll want to call them what they are.
---
Since we gonna have a rotation in 2 months I suggest you just gather gold and dust and wait untill then. Unless you wanna play wild ofc since alot of standard decks will not be playable in 2 months because of rotation.
---
Thanks!
---
Save your dust until the meta settles after rotation
---
Alright I’ll keep that in mind thank you
---
👍🏻 how much dust should I be aiming to gather? Obviously as much as I can but like would 10K be good or 15?
---
As /u/SoupAndSalad911 correctly highlights, ressurection effects are powerful in most games.
---
The major difference is that in hearthstone it is nearly impossible to to interact with your opponent's resurrection pool (beside giving him trash minions through weird means). In games like MtG you can remove your opponent's entire graveyard (resurrection pool) for 0 mana.
---
It unhealthy for a card game to have mechanics which you can't interact with; this is why we're seeing more and more anti combo cards being introduced (mojo masters, demonic project). "Graveyard" removal/interaction is an obvious missing factor here which hearthstone could definitely use.
---
An additional factor which makes barnes and cloning gallery so toxic with resurrection is the fact that you're summoning 1/1 copies of the minions but resurrecting the full powered versions of the minions because technically you don't even summon a 1/1 copy, you summon a copy which has a debuff making it 1/1. An elegant solution would be to hard code the 1/1 into the summoned copy, preventing you from resurrecting a full powered copy (this still won't stop barnes from summoning a y'shaarj though).
---
What about maiev and in the future lunara
---
I didnt play during the year maeiv was able to beunlocked and id gladly pay 5$ to buy her
---
I feel happy and sad at the same time that Ben got out on top of HS right before it was gonna sorta plunge
---
Frodam and other casters are also employed by Blizz, right? Or how does it work?
---
REEEEEE the libs are takin the boobs away!!
---
On turn 2, the warlock had 10/7 stats across 4 bodies in play and the priest had a 14/14 with a useful effect in play.
---
Y'all remember when people played novice engineered and passed? I miss that.
---
I usually auto concede when matched against Priest with my Priest deck.
---
Thanks for the help but I managed to solve it on it own. I had 40GB on my internal storage and on my SD card I had only 500 MB left, so I unbounded the SD card and started the download.
---
First time since Grand Tournament, I didn't pre order the expansion.  I just barely play it.  If I don't enjoy the meta, what's going to draw me back?  As you mentioned, it's been years and they've added so few features that it's just the same thing over and over again.  I don't doubt that their team size isn't massive or anything, but printing cards is the easiest job they should have.  All the other client changes and modes should be higher on their list, or they should at least have a team working on them.
---
I worked at a company that made more money but profits fell 10%. That same year there was a 10% growth in payroll costs. You can guess what happened. 
---
Also, I'm pretty sure the heroes didnt sell very well - and not surprising given the price. That's the main reason they switched from selling heroes in the shop to looking for other ways to introduce them.
---
it's moments like these that I wish the "Sorry" was still in the game
---
Uhhh what stock are you looking at?? ATVI (Activision Blizzard) is trading at ~$43 a share today, nearly half of its high price back in September. And it hasn't been this low since early February 2017; until the last few months it had been trending upward consistently and quickly.
---
sorry, i dont understand your question. this is not really place to discuss movies, but i think in general opinion (which I share) all Mission impossible movies are good except or maybe MI:2 and are actually getting better with each (6 is better than 5, that is better than 4 and so on)
---
It is. The packs are juicier when a new x-pac drops for a few weeks so all the streamers can get their "200 pack opening!?!?!?!?" videos online and entice you with the epic pulls. 
---
&gt; Of course I'd love to get more for my money too, but that's not the point here. 
---
That is the *exact* point here. 
---
People want to get something for their money. If they spend 100 dollars but still won´t be able to get enough for all that money, then they won´t bother spending the money in the first place. 
---
It´s not about any "relevation", it´s about the fact that people slowly realized how unsustainable paying 150 dollars per year is, and how little support the game gets outside of a few nerfs here and there and printing new cards. No it´s not a "revelation", it was a gradual process of people getting fed up with paying for something that is not worth it. 
---
Last night i was playing arena, 1-3 really bad rogue deck but i was playing it out for quests. i get matched against a golden warrior and after mulligans i wish him a happy new year. only to be hit back with “I Will Crush You!”
---
it felt so good spamming “Happy New Year!” as i was the one who ended up crushing him lol. 
---
There’s any number of ways they could nerf rexxar but one thing I thought of was either removing or significantly reducing the appearance rate of certain cards which tend to be broken from the zombeast pool - e.g. stonetusk boar, vicious fledgling, cave hydra, tundra rhino, exploding bloatbat, flappy bird. I think this might be more elegant than simply increasing the mana cost of the dk or the hero power. But seeing as they’ve never nerfed a dk despite most of them being ridiculously strong and they are now rotating soon I doubt they will do anything to them. 
---
You can do all right as 100% f2p. 
---
You can just have one good deck. Not a few. 
---
Honestly, I don't think you need much for a Odd Paladin to beat a Hunter. Nice hand though!
---
Sure, but I've enjoyed all expansions so far. And I am thoroughly disappointed with BFA in a way that is unprecedented. 
---
No it's just you, everyone else finds it engaging and interactive.
---
I've been through and seen many layoffs. In almost every one, the "fat" that is trimmed turns out to be a vital part of the machinery. It often takes a while before the effects are realized, and then years more to correct the course again. There is a short-term increase in profits before the long-term effects become visible.
---
A company can only exist because of its customers. Blizzard is cutting roles that are in touch with their customers, they are cutting their understanding of their customers. It will take some time before losing touch becomes apparent, but eventually it will.
---
In various studies of companies that failed, it is a repeat pattern that record profits are made when the company is already failing inside. There is a delay between cause and effect, and the first thing to rot is company culture.
---
&gt; while King has never replicated the success of the one game.
---
Probably because they stole that game from some creator in the first place. 
---
I completely forgot about Geist tbh, I'll add it in. 
---
That's a fair point, but I still think it is they that should have more oversight and prevent these sort of situations since they supposedly plan so far ahead, have a clear design philosophy as well as experience when it comes to card games' lifecycles. We as a community on the other hand think in terms of here and now, since in general we both don't have the knowledge nor the commitment to the product to act on such fine motivation as you suggest.
---
What's the combo?
---
But I'm not sure why would they want to lie about the lower power level. After all, it's a good thing, I've generally seen players agreeing with this approach ("let's wait some time to let the OP stuff rotate out instead of creating a massive power creep, which would ruin HS in the long run").
---
Of course, that might have been the case, I just don't see a reason behind that kind of lie. Maybe it was just a coincidence.
---
And about not taking Genn/Baku into account... Lol. Not caring about two incredibly impactful cards that care about the cards' mana cost when doing mana cost nerfs would just be completely silly. That one can't be true (and if it is, the devs fired shots at themselves by basically saying that they don't know how to do their job).
---
&gt;I'm just stating reality.
---
And, somehow, he made it worse...
---
No hard feelings thou, sorry :(
---
Mage mechathun? Mage hero power otk? Warlock blood troll?
---
I knew the some are some kind of meme but you cant put them all in the same thing as holy wrath paladin or otk priest, because those are actual decks you see on ladder while the others are very inconsistent memey decks.
---
Those decks existing doesnt affect at all the metagame, what affects the  metagame, is as the name implies, the **meta** decks. And a meta deck is a deck that can provide significant winrates to the player, in order to actually be played with a competitive intent. Those decks are also the powerfull ones that may or may be not a problem to the meta, depending on how they operate and if they limit or not the viability of many other strategies. Right now they are an answer to the aggro-less meta, being used as the counter to infinite value mechanics. Blame rexxar and odd warrior for this.
---
Seen some token Druid decks run it,guess it could fit in token Shaman too..
---
but ye, it sucks nearly as much as it always has.. hsreplay doesn't have a single deck on record with it
---
[https://hsreplay.net/decks/#includedCards=1147](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#includedCards=1147)
---
Wasn't Sony only censoring those creepy underage child objectification sims like steam?
---
I mean not really? In aggro it would take Keleseth’s spot and you’re paying 2 mana for a 0/4. In control warlock you’re not gonna rely on a 50/50 to draw when you could have more reliable stuff. In warrior you would just play odd. So realistically no. But you can still stick it in for shits and giggles. 
---
&gt;stating the truth
---
We should give that guy a blog instead of having a disussion board if that was remotely the case.
---
it is absolutely useless in any deck
---
Discover hemet hunter.
---
You run hemet, stitched tracker and masters call, all designed to get you hemet and delete your deck.
---
Now you have 1-2 spots for minions while always being able to discover hemet.
---
No 1 drop quest hunter.
---
Topdeck buildabeast with direfrenzy hunter.
---
Play both spellstones + double animal companion rhok delor and zuljin.
---
Just a few options.
---
I mean. If you make crappy American minimum wage, it takes you about 3 hours to buy a stack of 15 packs. Or, 5 packs an hour.
---
There is no way to grind 5 packs an hour in game. 
---
If you have a good job you can do two hours of overtime and buy an entire 4mo expansion cycle of daily pack grinding. 
---
I used to do it when the cards were good, I only went f2p because the year of the raven was total trash. 
---
Oh dang i didn't even notice, was sent here from another thread haha.
---
Please don’t craft it... spellstones, shadow visions, eternal servitude, lich king, etc. are all rotating.
---
I've bought the preorders since Frozen and typically bought around 30-50 packs with gold each expansion, and I can barely make one meta deck and even that requires spending all my dust. I've typically opened 2-4 legendaries per expansion with an average of 90 packs per expansion. I've never opened the most anticipated legendary of any expanaion.
---
Luck plays a big part. Sure part of my problem is that I don't like disenchanting non-triplicate cards, but I'd have to dust most of my legendaries to make a second top-tier deck.
---
Tess rogue with raven caller pirates and raiding party
---
Yeah warlock has a hard time in that match up and there is only so much you can do. 
---
If you are able, net deck a mech hunter deck and play a few games. It will give your more insight into their strengths and weaknesses, so counter playing them is easier.
---
Also Tess recasts Dream Cards as well as Lich King cards.
---
Sorry but where does it say Activision and Blizzard are losing 8% of it's workforce? It just says Activision('s) Blizzard so I was assuming it was just Blizzard. 
---
Wouldn't work anyway because you're that class once you play the hero card once.
---
So the only way to have Tess trigger a non-rogue Hero Card would be if one somehow obtains the opponents Herocard, then plays it, then plays the Rogue Hero Card, then Tess.
---
In that case, let the Rogue have another water elemental ffs.
---
So I'm not allowed to have discussion if I have some opposite view that you carry? Where am I wrong anyways? 
---
I'm allowed to comment if I share the same opinion as you do lol?
---
The point of dirty rat is like Geist but more general. You can’t just run that card in any deck and have it be good. Pull an opponents krush on turn 2 then you gonna be hating life. And dirty rat pulls a random minion so it can miss. That’s the type of counterplay we need. Zihi is great if you can use those 4 turns and I love him, but he doesn’t have that skill based counterplay where if you big brain they can’t combo. IMO that’s how it should be. Like demonic project doesn’t feel broken even though it can do the same things. There should be some level of disruption from the other side. And this is from the perspective of an otk player. Imagine what someone who doesn’t play otk must feel about the available combo counterplay.
---
Blizzard once wrote in the patch notes:
---
&gt; Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat  your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board.  Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall  game of *Hearthstone* more fun and compelling, but **taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.** 
---
and that 
---
&gt; Gadgetzan Auctioneer’s ability allows for a player to potentially draw  many cards for little cost. Card draw and card advantage are important  to the game—**overall, games are less interesting when a player draws  their entire deck.** 
---
Then they continue to print cards like Mecha'Thun..
---
In this case how is it a big deal. all they did was remove some cleavage. 
---
With hunter or shaman you could get two, and then valeera, or backwards.
---
Dude, it's the title of the article!  "Activision Blizzard gives weak 2019 guidance, says it will slash 8% of workforce".   
---
Activision Blizzard is the name of the parent holding company. It does NOT mean Blizzard alone.
---
Take the L mate 
---
Ya this has been a meta deck for a while. Even conboed in some support for dk since you run it either way. 
---
Rule one in HS: you won when you won. 
---
Avast with ye heathens! 4-gate, 3-gate robo, 3-gate stargate all day everyday.
---
Wings of Liberty era was the best. Yes, they were.
---
Freeze mage generally did not rely upon one turn kills. It relied upon stalling the game up to a point, and then going in and dumping damage over several turns resulting in a kill. Freeze mage felt more fair because it really was interactive, you could save health gain for when they Alex'd you or clear their ice block on low health. Zihi is some counterplay, but it still doesn't enable you to survive their combo, which means control decks are out. Combo plays very differently than OTK
---
Then what's the other possible reason for the lay-offs if not trimming the fat?
---
Lich king, it's just like the least situational card. Lord godfrey's good but lich king is a  must kill 8/8 taunt
---
Yeah, that's where the enormous price of HS really feels bad. Pre-order 50 packs together with some quests and you can scrape together a few top-tire decks...
---
...But creating the fun meme decks using the obscure legendaries? Forget it. FeelsBadMan. 
---
No but the wouldn’t be campaigning to remove it if it was in
---
what did it cost?
---
Would that rly be problamatic, considering how unreliable it is?
---
If this guy wants to stomp on big priest then he should be playing shaman.
---
I'm playing evolve shaman between wild rank 10-5 and I just dominate every big priest. Hard mulligan for Hex. Plan B is to Earth Shock whatever big minion he pulls and keep it alive until I draw Hex. Devolve also destroys their plan.
---
Thats a really simply and good call. Thanks. I have all the expansions with differing levels of completion and at some point I'd like to go back and finish them all. 
---
If you like hearthstone arena, I highly reccomend trying out draft in magic the gathering Arena. I haven't played hearthstone since I started playing it, and I played hearthstone for years. 
---
Shaman has huge highroll potential. Far sight into a T2 rain of toads, for instance.
---
Try odd value warlock.  You get the best 1 drops from warlock class, 3 Mana cards like stonehill defender, witch's caludren, and then power 5 drops like cubes both 5 Mana demons, skull,rotten apple, and other power odd demons and azlina to switch to their hand.  
---
You can always add the word "friendly" to the title
---
"What kind of moron plays sudden betrayal?". These are the type of salt I get when people don't play around an uncommon card and try and act like it wasn't their dumbass that lost them the game.
---
still 5 wins in ranked to get the card back. 3 wins in the early ranks, but 4 and 5 in the higher ranks. Rank floors stay. Also, some cards were changed (cold blood costs 2, flame totem 3, hunter spellstone 6, hunters mark 2, equality 4, wild growth 3, nourish 6, level up 6, leeching poison now 1 but only gives lifesteal for 1 turn, and saronite chaingang doesnt work with shudderwock anymore)
---
Followed by BOOOOM hitting face, followed by hero portrait exploding.
---
&gt;[Who is](https://i.imgur.com/WaMrsd3.jpg) loa is the mightiest
---
Literally unplayable.
---
What winning deck do you put this in?
---
Yeah, I am F2P casual *at best* but it really is the game I play the most. Also, I conserve my dust for any good neutrals that might arrive next xpac. Things like Lich King, Leeroy, Baku, etc. I'd rather have a variety of decks versus marrying one class. I am proud to say that I am 75 wins away from my first golden portrait. 
---
I would be okay with starting to drop some cash in the future. It depends on how it goes with Activision/Blizzard. It looks bleak at the moment but I am...forever the optimist. 
---
You're mostly right on sunken cost from a financial perspective, there is a breaking point there, but people are also as I said invested emotionally into HS, too. Not from a "I'll never leave you!" emotion but rather they've invested mental energy into learning cards, mechanics, interactions, decks, meta, etc.
---
As for HS for new players, you have 25 tiers of 2 stars which is between about 35-50 wins depending on win streaks plus (for new players) another 40-80 losses as they learn and get matched against better decks, but they will never be blown out. That's the key difference. Then 25-20 is also gated off to veterans but they will face decks closer to the meta but still a least stand a chance. I was playing against what I assume were top tier decks day 1 given the crazy synergy and power of their cards that is absolutely not there in the awful starter decks.
---
Another major difference is new players can build a deck that for some classes uses between 10-20 of the classic/basic cards they can easily get or craft so their decks are on average much closer to good meta decks than mtga which uses a ton of cards they likely won't have. HS also only requires you to have 2 of a card, MTGA requires 4. HS also has 100 times the luck MTGA does so new players will get some wins against better players/decks where they largely won't get that in magic which has significantly better control on what resources you have access to.
---
I'm not saying MTGA will never surpass HS but it won't be for at least 2 years, probably longer.
---
Oh, so just random spells. I thought it'd be some infinite (only limited by turn limit) spells combo to buff the heck out of the C'thun. 
---
So the 5 wins I’m guessing it just doesn’t display it now? Won a game and didn’t show anything if the sort towards the card back. 
---
If you have 10 available combos, some will make it through to viability. If you have a whole 20, then yet more will make it through. Some amount of OTK is completely fine, but when every single class has an OTK option and most have 2 or more, then fundamentally either control tools cannot be printed, or OTK is going to dominate the meta. In essence, all of these different decks had some amount of probability to be viable once they were available in the sets. Part of the conversation is about how OTK should be handled in general and counterplay, but another part is how many are available. You can't come close to playing around something when there are 20 different ways that same basic thing can be done. 
---
I guess, predicting exactly what is going to dominate the meta is very difficult on Blizzards part. But, the number of OTKs available is something they can predict. Just like they should no print too many overpowered agro tools, or control tools, there should not be this number of possible OTK things available given the overall size of the set. 
---
You and all the other people are are acting like Blizzard is personally fucking you guys over because they *partially* censored her cleavage. My point about the breast size is that A) they're ridiculous and B) the size hasn't changed, so it's even funnier that you're all triggered over the fabric
---
Happy 🍰 day!

# THE TECHNOLOGY IS HERE
---
We're triggered? Dude you have over a dozen posts here losing your mind about how other people don't like the changes. I think the only one triggered here is you. Like all you've done is freak out at people about "Liking cartoon boobs" like it somehow affects your life in some major way. Get some help man.
---
I’m confused as to why this is possible after the layoffs. Maybe the positions are not the same as the ones that were vacated, I haven’t looked into that but it all just seems poorly handled...
---
I guess the fact that it also "kills" one of your minions makes people not want to slot it most of the time. Evenlock normally wants to win against otks by turn 5-6-7 via giants and drakes. And mechathun is the combo deck, and even if you run it to destroy other faster combo decks, you risk a lot getting your mechathun destroyed. Some people do run it still, and some evenlocks slot gnomeferatu too just for the chances of instawinning against certain combo decks.
---
That's not a problem with capitalism it's a problem. with divested ownership. The whole thing could be fixed with either a more centralized leadership, or a CEO who could manage investor expectations.
---
Boar is the more problem card.
---
Masterful! 
---
r/oddlysatisfying 
---
Hearthstone makes Blizzard stupid amounts of cash, and the developers are actually going to be increasing for the HS team from what I read — just side projects at Acti/Bliz are downsizing staff
---
Yeah man, good strat for sure. Zilliax should be priority number 1 if you don’t have it already, literally the strongest card in HS right now.
---
Who's is correct!
---
It's not who is, it's asking to whom does the mightiest loa belong.
---
Whose is not used as a question. For example: "It's the warriors whose loa is the mightiest."
---
Not nearly as much as I used to, only log in once or twice a week to clear the quests and do an arena run
---
it cost 800 employees but It´s finally done
---
Yo man I was agreeing with your point but totally weakens your argument to shit on someone for a hobby (not to mention uncalled for). 
---
Combined with War Kodo on T6....
---
Yeah but jaraxas dies to a basic spell. The Lich King has his own raid!
---
Fuck capitalism
---
i think the idea of messing with a player's turn timer is inherently flawed and non-accessible in a veey frustrating way.
---
Taking some examples: i sometimes have problems playing through a complex turn on my phone, most of the players (the non-reddit people) don't know every card and have to read the cards description, there are people who play hearthstone in between cooking or doing something else and take some time scrolling thrugh the history bar and there are countless stories on how players with some disability absolutely hate thia card.
---
I think the idea of "you don't have enough time" could be flavourly done in a bunch of ways that didn't disrupt the gameplay itself. "After your opponent plays two cards end their turn" or something like that.
---
Yeah it is quite like that. Only you get some crazy synergies!
---
Just now against a priest I got stole the priest DK, then played Tess a few turns later. Every single Rogue card id played entire game was recast! I didn’t know it worked like that! Crazy game. 
---
Kragwa is good yeah haha
---
Playing devil's advocate here, the tooltip for Battlecry says, "Does something when you play it *from your hand."* So based on that, even though the card is "played" again, it wasn't from your hand, and therefore Battlecries are not included.
---
You are missing the warlock tools to interact with combo:
---
* Gnomeferatu
---
* Demonic Project
---
* Void Contract
---
An Inner Fire priest that uses Master Oakheart to get 3 taunts: Tar Creeper, Mosh'ogg Enforcer and Witchwood Grizzly.
---
Then you Divine Spirit, Inner Fire or Topsy Turvy and win.

Just screenshot and send them to blizzard\_cs on twitter... I've gotten people banned for stuff like that before.
---
About 50% of the OTK possibilities in hearthstone over the years have been utilized competitively. It is a combination of control tools in the class and how many cards the combo takes versus draw available in the class. With this many possible combos possible across all classes, it is almost guaranteed that combo is going to dominate, because if any class has enough control tools then that class is going to work great with the many combos which lack significant counterplay. Its kind of like, if Blizzard prints about 10 different synergistic agro packages instead of 5 they won't all be viable, but with more of them available it is much more likely that agro will be doing great unless cards are specifically printed to shut it down.

He's the one with the infinite lynessa anyway.
---
Fire-Eater only boosts the next hero power.
---
So I had 3 and when I rerolled the bonus quest took the third quest's slot instead of getting a new one. So i lost 60 G /60 Dust :(
---
We are acting like it's a change that didn't need to be made because it didn't. Why does it matter so much to you? A) your point was litterally that they changed her breast size which they didn't B) Hiw does the size not changing make it funnier? Like from what you've been saying we would be more "triggered" if they did that which shpuld make it funnier. I get you're just trying to be the edgy one for a few laughs but could you atleast pretent to be somewhat intelligent.
---
You just like Apxvoid :D
---
He have only Mage's decks too
---
Well they have some openings in Esports, despite apparently downsizing that part of the company after the layoffs.
---
There's bound to be some degree of incompetence in something so massive, but still.
---
I completely missed that one. Also, like 6 of the decks here are top of the meta, and another 2 or 3 are quite viable. So, that 90% number is even more trash than the worst combos here. 
---
Jaina was so much better before the nerf 
---
Personally I run one copy in my evenlock. The meta has shifted a bit post nerfs, but last season it was necessary because it was an instant win against OTK paladins. It still wins me a few games in this meta
---
Damn you got hit pretty hard with those Jaina nerfs
---
Evenlock?
---
Better to die quickly in a blaze of hand-to-hand glory than to die much later as a cowardly sword user.
---
OK, yeah, I can see that.
---
Job well done! The CFO deserves another 15 million dollar bonus!
---
I read “bm’d” as “been” upon first read and was like, “Sure, you can say that, I guess...”
---
Hunter deck has far too many big minions in it to really take advantage of the shrine. 
---
I don't think it keeps the buff, it's next hero power, not "your hero power this turn".
---
There financial call yesterday discussed this. They are hiring developers and I believe programmers for their core games. HS, Diablo, WoW, etc. My guess is somebody woke up and said hey our games kind of suck, according to the players, so we need to fix that. 
---
Nice job!  Thanks for the reply.  I'll probably try this too.
---
I did consider that, but I ended up not including it because taunt is a form of counterplay which is available, and that deck has a pretty limited damage pool. I suppose I probably should include it considering I counted armor as a form of interaction though. 
---
Do you sell them?
---
I love Zilliax! I run him in a lot of decks.
---
How am I triggered for finding you guys so hilarious? And am I wrong for being disgusted with fellow men for being so, well, sad and disgusting? There's men in here, actual human men, who are losing their shit over the fact that they can't see a sliver of a cartoon woman's boobs and you're saying that I'm treating this as though it affects my life. This thread is LITTERED with no-life neckbeards saying this is the worst thing to happen and society is shit and *genuinely* acting like this is ruining their lives.
---
There's a guy here saying this is because modern feminists hate men so much that they are trying to kill sex-positivity for women. And I'M the one who needs help for having a laugh at that? Also, are you honestly defending these people? I'm not the one uninstalling games and warning people of a "slippery slope" that will lead us into "puritanism".
---
tbf, you should probably still crush him...
---
Oh! I didn't even realize! Yay cake day
---
Happy Cake Day Alaskan_Wildflower! Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come.
---
I thought Jeklik's was fun. A bit hard walking the line with that deck but the shrine synergises well with your cards.
---
You think he'd check for that with the 2/2
---
I'd like one cleavage please.
---
&gt; If you have 10 available combos, some will make it through to viability. If you have a whole 20, then yet more will make it through. Some amount of OTK is completely fine, but when every single class has an OTK option and most have 2 or more, then fundamentally either control tools cannot be printed, or OTK is going to dominate the meta.
---
False, there can be 10000 combos and none be viable. The fact they are viable is because of aggro weakness/control strengh, not because of the fact they exist. If only one combo was possible, all the combo decks in the meta would be just that combo deck. The amount of matchups against combo decks would be the same, but instead of being matched against different combo decks, you will always face that specific possible combo deck (I hope I explained this correctly lol).
---
Control tools can still be printed too. In fact, they are so strong thats the only reason we have a combo meta. We had many ways to OTK before, but none of them were problematic just because aggro was stronger. And the fact that there are 20+ different combos doesnt mean you have to counter them all in a different way.
---
All of them are countered the same way. Mechathun in any class, holy wrath paladin and any malygos class OTK are countered exactly in the same way. Mechathuns and malygos both also both get destroyed by gheist. Spell based OTKs (priest ones mainly) can be beated by mojomaster or nerubian unraveler. Mojomaster also works against the mechathuns, malygos, and paladin otks too. In the specific case of ressurect priest (malygos/velen, or the new wall priest) things like hex, poly, or saronite task master work against them. With just 1 card you can target 70-80% of the otk decks, and with 2-3 you basically cover 100% of them. You actually dont need 2-3 techs for them in any deck, since most control decks do have at least 1 or 2 favourable matchups against some certain otk deck that works in a specific way that the control deck can exploit innately. So just teching against a combo deck that is popular and that beats your control deck is more than enough.
---
The problem is not the amount of otks, the problem is we are realizing this many otks because they are one of the only ways to win appart from playing an infinite value control deck. Its not quantity nor quality, its how the meta works.
---
30% of people playing "slow" hunter decks with rexxar, of course almost any otk based deck will have a good time on ladder.
---
I didnt realized it didnt show now. I guess since many people were complaining that "I hate the animation its too long buuuu" they erased it.
---
Just went 5-0 with Paladin. BoM on Tier 1 is too much tempo
---
Why am I not surprised that most of the open positions for Hearthstone are internships?
---
Picked paladin, opening hand was arcane anomaly and buff cards.  Won on turn 4.
---
Actually i have to admit priest in wild has so much controlling tools aviable.. 🤔
---
next move: completing a quest gives you the opportunity to buy a pack with real money.
---
That sounds awesome, I will try it out
---
BUT ITS NEVER THAT ONE
---
So they will probably be released soon, then.

Plays zentimo “look at all the ways to develop a wide board, when I draw bloodlust or the legendary spell this guy is screwed” oh neither are in the deck. 
---
Thanks. I’ll think about it,
---
&gt; Assuming that any kind of balance is intended, there is a direct relation between number of cards printed within a given archetype and the power of that archetype. That is basic statistics.
---
I already explained to you that it doesnt matter how many otks they exist. if they were less otks, they would all be played more, to the point the matchup against combo decks would be very similar to the actual one. The metric of "number of combo decks in the game" is not a fiable statistic to evaluate if the metagame is healthy or balanced at all.
---
Opponent played Farsight into turn 2 Rain of Frogs and I just got bullied from there.
---
Did you test Muckhunter instead of Leeroy at some point? I assume that you play a non-quest list and figured that a more defensive card like him could be more useful. 
---
Thanks for the advice. Possibly will cause it seems fun to play 
---
Brave soul
---
Literally unplayable
---
It's all perspective. Think how much some people put into their hobbies. You can easily spend 2k+ on a single bike if your hobby is cycling.
---
Hate all if those priest decks, wall priest is no exception 😅
---
Fair enough, but yesterday's close was literally the single lowest trading price in years. Today's price is lower than every other day besides yesterday, so saying it's up 8%, or any amount at all, is misleading
---
YOU FACE JARAXXUS, EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
---
I'd suggest waiting for the meta to settle after rotation before spending any resources
---
We need a tri-class card that summons a Jade Golem at the end of your turn
---
Damn, Yu-Gi-Oh! surely has changed a lot since the last time I read it.
---
There's always wild :)
---
All the cool kids are doing it!
---
I was thinking that it would be cool if all the alternate heroes got renamed and skinned hero powers like Zul'jin has
---
I wouldnt recomend you this deck, not good at all to actually climb (if that is what you want) and pretty inconsistent. It does have fun plays but at the cost of some unavoidable loses to itself.
---
They won't because those are cards too.
---
This has definitely happened before... Can't recall exactly when though.

---
WC3 Reforged is almost completed, it comes out this year.  It doesn't have much of a future beyond that.
---
i really dont know why people think this is a big deal. They changed it so she isnt a pair of walking tits, so what?
---
there are many neutral low costed minions that summon random jank to the enemy board. Not the same as transfomr, but effective.
---
Also warrior has cornered sentry.
---
None of those matchups are 10-15% though? Control Priest has an over 30% winrate vs Odd Warrior, your comment is just disingenuous/lying. I'm not saying that a 95% winrate matchup wouldn't be an "autowin" just that you're horribly misrepresenting the situation.
---
"To each their own"
---
They can be used as singular when one's gender isn't specified.
---
I think they've transitioned to using Heroes as incentives for other purchases like the preorders.
---
They had already created them for the Rumble. They always repeat back your corresponding like their "oops" for your "oops", etc. So this didn't require much fresh development. 
---
I mean, every time you play it it will get larger and larger as it casts another Dire Frenzy on self. 
---
The legion lies in ruins. The madman with the guns or death itself shall change the tides of war

I've had an easy time with Hunter so far. 
---
Oh man, is this a movement now?
---
Yeah that's what happened to me too. Blizzard is such a joke when it comes to basic functions jesus christ. 
---
Getting a full collection must suck :(
---
Yes. Please and thank you. 
---
more cards like \[saronite taskmaster\].   
---
Freeze mage works pretty well against big priest fyi, but yeah, big priest seems kinda overwhelming sometimes:/
---
These two expansions were incredibly awesome and diverse. Being able to stop spell based combos for a turn? Amazing. 
---
If only :(
---
It’s BS that Paladin got Secrets from Rogue during alpha because they lacked enough archetypes. Never should’ve left Rogue.
---
Hmmm I guess you should ask how the picture of Jaina was sexualized in any way?
---
She was simply standing there?  Unless you suggest men would usually find girls just standing around arousing or something? 
---
*cough cough* multiply sentences here buddy
---
To be fair, they could probably do this in some events or something, it would be incredible. 
---
Classic and basic set nerfs have been all reverted 
---
Build a beast now costs four. 
---
Did 3 games as mage. Won 3 games as mage. Broken AF
---
I thought I was trash, lol.
---
Would the deck go infinite too?
---
Yep, every play shuffles in more cards. 
---
I is. I is loa. 
---
Reverted how? Like all nerfs and no more hall of fame?

---
An interesting nerf choice, why decided on 4?
---
If you want to try it out, just play without it. It’s a great card but not like it’s core to the combo.
---
It is but ladder is filled with priest which is its counter atm. You should have a couple decks for ranked incase you reach a pocket of players where your deck is unfavorable.
---
Asking the vital questions
---
BY THE HOLY LIGHT!
---
By the Holy Light!
---
Depends what your deck looks like already. If you have ample removal already I'd probably take LK, but Godfrey can turn the tide like no other.
---
"Curse your **Sudden** but inevitable **Betrayal**!"
---
are you implying I don't care about gratuitous cleavage in a CCG?
---
To be fair none of the decks are particularly good. They all depend on good rng to win. Talanji seems the most overpowered with her constant spell generation. 
---
Each Rumble Run boss has a special dialogue line to respond to each of Rikkar's 6 emotes, so it's not that basic. I think they added extra lines for this brawl too. 
---
Yeah fuck you blizzard for acting like a business and putting your financial needs ahead of the consumer needs!!!!!!!    
---
/s. 
---
&gt;7500 dust
---
That's a lot.
---
&gt;Only 4300 dust if you don't craft a card that carrys the deck and a card and another impactful card 
---
Still a decent amount compared to most aggro decks, especially considering the deck isn't meta by any means without the DK value/win condition. 
---
I can't for the life of me win 10 standard, then again I'm a loser that only uses wizbang. I also only play arena. Any links to some standard decks that can pull off a few wins in standard would be appreciated. 
---
How am i supposed to play this shrine
---
WITHOUT MY FAN OF FLAMES
---
Upvoted for truth
---
it was hardly gratuitous. Even if it was, would that really be a problem?
---
It's a very good card for mage, I have it in several of my decks. :)
---
No cultural change isnt censorship.
---
If the culture pushes a creator to alter their artistic vision to something that doesnt represent that vision properly properly, then its censorship.
---
Note: ya know, I actually dont think the change in Jaina's shirt is censorship because it's closer to modern incarnations of that outfit like in hots. If that outfit has changed over time because of cultural change, then that's all good. 
---
Ashmore was the last card I added and I think it’s almost essential. Without it you just run out of steam later in the game
---
Two of these characters are traitorous undead bastards, and the other is an Eredar Lord of the Burning Legion. Who do you thing you should pick?
---
Chicken survives one turn
---

---

---
GG
---
Actually just 7% of all employees
---
It kind of makes sense, because *Tess* is replaying the card not your hero. Only kind of makes sense though
---
And I think that was a poor comparison. You didn’t seem the catch that either, even when I explained that I believe Jaraxxus and Mecha-Jaraxxus is not comparable to Medivh and Medivh. I even said agree to disagree because its subjective, but I’m the one who didn’t catch up.
---
Yeah... I'm not going to spend my entire evening making a detailed reports with interviews and fully in depth statistics just over this silliness. As stated before it's all based on my own personal anecdotes. I know this is going to be a big shocker for you, but a lot of things are based around personal experiences.
---
And how exactly do I miss the bigger picture of agency? Are you implying that women that wear slut mogs lack agency, or are you meaning Jaina lacks agency. If you mean Jaina, then yeah, just like every other fictional character has no agency.
---
I came back to HS after 2 years and had winning streak with a Basic Mage and Basic Warlock deck. I barely had any card from the current expansions.
---
If you're at low rank (which it seems like you are), building a decent curve and good all around cards is enough to get a few wins there. I can't help you with specific decks since I just came back, but honestly it shouldn't be hard to do something half-decent even with the basic set. 
---
Is it Illidan??
---
He'd be insulted you just thanked God... and any company that isn't profitable dies. It means you get nothing... no jobs, no games, no anything. I fail to see the 'unhinging' he's talking about. He's just ranting about a downsizing.
---
It's not a financial *need.* It's a financial *want* from shareholders. They make more money year after year. The consumer needs should be met in order to meet your financial needs, anyway, or you're going the wrong direction as a company. This is just you wanting to be contrarian.
---
What cards could do that? 
---
Yup. Lost 60 gold and dust quest because of this. Fuck off Blizzard. 
---
In this case? Idk. I didnt say that was what changed it, just that it should be considered along side legal pressures if a change is censorious or natural.
---
What about the fact that I mentioned that I thought that the more likely thing were pressures from their mobile distribution platforms?
---
Or maybe they're changing the art to better match the outfit as it's been in more recent titles, like in hots. I dunno, I feel like those two are more likely than backlash against her boobs being out.
---
Yeah me too. Ive been playing since launch and it's nice to actually play my collection. 
---
I mean, if we're talking wild, Priest isn't a problem there outside Big Priest, and it's pretty clear the problem with Big Priest isn't Psychic Scream.
---
Cross-class comparisons for specific cards tend to be awkward, especially between classes as different as Rogue and Priest. 
---
No. Two words. Big priest.
---
I'll fight fair... this time. Prawmeess!
---
You're right, let's get some huge bulges and hard chested guys too. 
---
He literally said he wanted it outside of wild.
---
Happy Cakeday Mate!
---
Damn, some of you are actually mad at this? Some of you need to get outside more. 
---
Yup just trying to play traditional decks and all I can play is hard Afro to beat this nonsensical shit
---
Loatheb 
---
If they planned on doing that, they would have offered it together with the start of the event don't you think?
---
Only if you last long enough to play it, I found warrior to be too high end that I'd get smashed too hard early on.  
---
But... you said you never fight fair 🤔
---
Could be good for us. Get rid of a bunch of people who aren't directly related to game development, and (I hope this is what they are doing) bring in more developers.

---
You already saving up for the next expansion? 
---
I mean, you can look at the numbers. Shareholders want growth. Bliztivision has been growing. The only way to really grow further is cut on expenditure. They do make mountains more money year after year, including the new CFO with a new 15 million dollar bonus just for joining.
---
Because it costs them money. They have to use these numbers to determine if this makes casuals play more (resulting in them buying more card packs). If it does, they’ll continue to do it. If it makes people play more but pay less, they’ll stop. 
---
the shark
---
I saw someone with over 30k on twitch a couple of days ago, so yeah, I’m sure lots of people have over 10k. Still awesome though, 100 lovely packs for you next set, even more since we’re still a couple months away.
---
I’m at 6k myself, closing in on my usual goal (80 packs per expansion) 
---
Because you can only hold 10 cards in hand.
---
The playoffs were mostly in non-dev positions.
---
The jop openings are mostly artists, testers, designers and programmers. And I presume having 140 openigns is not related to the layoffs and they usually have many open positions
---
Working as expected I'd think.  
---
I don't see what's subjective in a 50% stock drops + layoffs + the bad press. But yeah sure it's me being all "subjective" and the outlook is really great. Get outta here clown!
---
Damn dude, I make a sarcastic comment and you wish I get fired? 
---
You’ll find out once you grow up that tough circumstances in life happen periodically, it’s all about how you deal with them. Of course I sympathize with the people that lost their jobs. But these people are adults (I assume) and will push through this tough time and find another sweet job because they now have blizzard on their resume.
