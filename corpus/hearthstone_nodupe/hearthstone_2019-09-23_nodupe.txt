I have 2 questions:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. Are these offered on Heroic only or Reg mode as well?
---
2. Is it only offered on the first reward screen?
---
Then you run into Plague Lord of Madness who has 2 copies of Plague of Madness on each phaze - 6 chances to kill your weapon.
---
Huh?
---
If they nerf mech warper, they should also nerf all cards that cheats mana to 0 cannot cost less than 1 as for the giants they cant cost less than 5. But this is dumb will gut otk mage no more infinite fireballs for sorc apprentice if this unicorn patch happens.
---
Arcane missiles adds missiles for spell damage, it doesnt increase the amount per shot. So its wouldve shot 5 missiles dealing one damage each not 3 dealing 3 damage each
---
Wish granted: you never complete the quest as you have no mana, therefore cannot have any unspent mana.
---
Hero Powers wouldn't work because they don't count as your character dealing the damage.
---
Can someone explain what happened here?
---
lived no poop dog
---
Is that actually true, lore-wise? Do you need to be smart enough to, say, sign a contract, with the elements in order to commune with them and use them?
---
you're right i'm an idiot. thanks.
---
[deleted]
---
This isn't Wrath. This is Madness.
---
Yeah and so are all the treasures, get over it
---
1. Both Regular and Heroic Mode    
---
2. Any of the possible reward screens, though the sooner you get it the better
---
&gt;Pushing extremes of power can break the game or polarizing it heavily.  If one class is pushed too far and dominates or one class isn‚Äôt pushed  as much and falls out of the meta, that can generate negative  experiences.
---
This seems like the direction that they've decided to go for the past three years, and it leads to clumsy nerfs in response to Jade Idol (with Skulking Geist) or The Caverns Below (which was nerfed at least three times).
---
Generating excitement seems to me like a strategy designed to attract new players while grinding out the old players, and that strikes me as a poor strategy for the long term. Eventually, it'll become common knowledge that Hearthstone isn't really worth it in the long run, and is therefore not really worth investing in.
---
Ive observed no one on this subreddit is able to search and see this exact interaction being posted 10 times a day

Shoulda played around it.
---
/r/imsorrybob
---
Rexxar's Battlecry is maybe coded as your hero dealing damage and not the card itself, which means that it triggers the Overkill of the weapon. But i'm not sure if that entirely makes sense considering you probably can't trigger Lifesteal or any other keyword with Rexxar.
---
WOW NO WAY HOLY SHIT OMG U SINGLE HANDEDLY CRACKED THE CODE!!!

it is very skillful, and it's absurd when played perfectly.
---
that's why the deck has such a high winrate in high legend and performs a lot worse in lower ranks.
---
It is random but all murloc died because we killed so many of them just to beat the plague lord. Now they are only survivors. Now what. Are you going to get them killed by sending them to battles? You cold hearted one

Then the Mage opens the Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron, causing the mutliverse to collapse in on itself. Genn Greymane and Tess Greymane are killed in the collision, and Doctor Boom rises to become the ruler of the meta before being overthrown by the combined forces of The Incredible Gruul, Captain Hooktusk, Tirion Fordring, Scarlet Crusader, and Elven Archer.
---
&gt;I think it is what hearthstone could aim to be.  
---
Hearthstone should aim to be based on decks that having healing mechanics that are already power in themselves become even more powerful by buffing minions or creating card draw?  
---
No thanks.  I wouldn't mind it quite so much if divine spirit were gone.  
---
I would probably agree it's one of the more skillful decks in the game though but the bar it set pretty low in this meta.

Arena win would count towards what total? It would only count towards the total arena wins unless I'm missing something here.
---
I like that weapon. With double battlecry and one C'thun in the deck you can deal 200 damage. (One C'thun battlecry deals 100 damage max.)
---
There is a minion that kill your hero?

I remember playing Patron with charging arcane giants as alternative win condition, jeez.

I picked up the 0 mana zephyrs lamp and I was hoping for Alexstrasza as I had 16 damage on board. I understand that would be "too easy", but it would miss lethal, which defeats the point of Zephyrs.

---
i'd say coining out the angler is best, since the opponent will probably trade and you can play 2 creatures next turn
---
if the opponent doesn't trade you play 2 murlocs,get 2 extra murlocs, and then you trade.
---
looks like the play,
---
coining out the two tidecallers is an option, but the first tidecaller played is an easy trade for the imp.
---
Mr. Bob Dobelina
---
My strat was with treasure double legendary minions, than got some small spells and 5 Edwins in the deck-thanks to Bob . Sonya Shadowdance is good ,they cant kill them both or you can kill one with hero power for insurance and do some infinite stuff ,if you can balance hand space. For ultimate Edwins do combo 2 sorcerer's apprentice (easy with Sonya) and infinite Cheap shot (now 0 mana echo deal 2 dmg). I made 2 64/64 Edwins cleared all of the murlocs even some of my stuff for board space . Do this after opponent plays Plague of Murlocs cause that's his only answer or poison+charge murloc, less likely. Sorcerer's apprentice + infinite Cheap shot  is offered in the same bucket so don't miss it. Amaz did similar thing with Arcane Devourer watch?v=Xt6O9g2s0KE .

Drboom is better and better for finisher by turn 7 you wanna close put game and booms does that better and if cleared it can still face dmg with the bots. With better pirates i could see hooktusk at 7 with ones got currently no. As bigger pirates that are good when hooktusk arent good on own.
---
And even then are far more poweefull stuff by then and control has 0 issue clearing few pirates by turn 7/8.
---
Hooktusk wouldnt be used without better pirates in odd rpgue and even if was ot woulndt push it overtop at all
---
I‚Äôve gotten from 20 to 6 so far with quest shaman, one addition that has been hilarious if sometimes not ideal is Harrison Jones.

---
How is this mecha'thun?
---
In 2019 where most number one popular games are FREE (league of legends just to name some). 15 EUR in the gaming world is a lot for a non RPG story based/cinematic game.  
---
Don't get me wrong, games like Borderland 3 or anything that has a lot of story content ect I can see it being justified as 40+ EUR game.   
---
But for hearstone where it's really just a card game, which is a free game, 15 EUR is a lot. But I am not really complaining cause the amount of content we got is quite worth 15 EUR IMO.

Considering how the card comes from the original League of Explorers it seems pretty safe to say it is
---
Ah, I knew they were the same but didn't put that together
---
can it hit your own face?
---
binging with bob‚Äòish
---
Yeah but it gets removed from your adventure deck after you use it, so if you can't make it to the plague lord without using it, it may not be the best choice
---
I hope you‚Äôll get it working :)
---
I thought it was from it being double casted by Firepaw or whatever the treasure's proper name is.
---
I just hit rank 3 after not being able to pass rank 10 in every other season. I feel like I have a much better understanding of the game now and how each deck works in the meta. Playing Quest Shaman btw.
---
Zoo has pretty weak turn 2 plays, EVIL cable rat, serpent egg, etc.
---
Having a 4/2 is kind of irrelevant when they have a 3/1 and initiative.
---
If your goal is to stop 3 damage to face, the soft taunt of angler is better than a tidecaller which wont kill the imp.

---
A friend on his cell had to switch to pc to challenge me recently.
---
OMEGALUL
---
And the first pack you open is this...
---
And thats exactly why the fight resets and he starts again against him with 300 hp instead of losing that run or the plaguelord staying at another hp.
---
What you are saying is what exactly happened in OP post. And what i am explaining here.
---
Does Rocket Boots work with the rhino loa?
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Wow almost like you chose to play a deck with no win condition and are losing because of it.
---
There's nothing that contest the flame imp other than angler. 
---
So your options are:
---
-Trade your 2 drop for his 1 drop
---
-Trade 2 one-drop for his 1 drop
---
-Pass
---
Passing doesn't really help, you don't have any good topdeck (and you can't rely on topdecks anyway, you're gonna get run over).
---
Trading 2 one-drop or one 2-drop is the same mana. The only difference is the number of cards you spend, and the number of minions you lose. Would you rather lose 1 card and 1 minion, or 2 cards and 2 minions? When you put it that way, the answer is rather obvious.
---
Coining angler is your best hope. 
---
Note that playing angler on 2 to save the coin doesn't achieve anything. You save the coin but you waste 1 mana on turn 1, it's not beneficial. 
---
Plus, if he plays another minion on 2, the angler might lose to that one rather than the imp, and then you're in a world of pain.
---
So coin angler, and if he doesn't trade for it, you play both tidecallers, draw 2 murlocs, and trade for it yourself.
---
If he buffs the imp's health, you're in serious trouble. But if he has a health buff, you're in trouble no matter what you do. Angler is your best shot.
---
No one is blaming the developers though (meaning those who actually code the game and develop its assets).  
---
  
---
The accusation is agaisnt the company,  and the community manager is just the person who speaks with the company's voice. Whose fault it is inside the company is for them to decide, and I think most people outside couldn't care less about it.  
---
Even if this behavior is just the result of the normal operation of the company and isn't the fault of any actual human being, it's still a product of the company's policies and they as a whole are still responsible for it.  
---
Long story short, we aren't accusing the community managers or even the developers, we are accusing Blizzard.
---
If you have the coins anomaly you can lock out the AI by putting ten coins in their hand- they throw one out each turn but you bring them back up to ten with another creature and boom, they don‚Äôt draw any cards for the rest of the game. It takes a while to get them up to ten but somehow it just happened. One-shotted the Murloc plague lord with it earlier.
---
Just because it‚Äôs sarcasm doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not stupid.
---
r/HSPulls
---
Had this weapon and Glyph of Warding in my run. He had a 1/1 C'thun on the field (I think from Zerek's?). 
---
I was really low health, so I played my really high damage Zilliax to heal back up, and summoned an amalgam so he'd rotate that over instead. Brilliant play, me! Sure, I lose the Zilliax but I'm stabilized in health with some of my hand cleared out.
---
But like an idiot, I didn't think to attack the C'thun because there was a higher damage minion on the field. He then used Blade of C'thun on the Zilliax and killed me because the 1/1 also gets the buff.
---
So remember kids, don't be an idiot like me and assume you're safe from C'thun with just Glyph!
---
It was from 5-Legend, but you're more likely to find aggro/other very tryhard decks there. There is also no streak boosts iirc, which makes those harder ranks take even longer.
---
Exactly. His analogy is flawed because passing your turn in zugzwang is something you'd like to do in Chess as making a move would put you at a disadvantage but can't because you must always make a move. In Hearthstone, you can pass your turn, but doing so in this example would put you at a further disadvantage.
---
Coin hp. Gg ez game
---
It is. 
---
I had this combo on a heroic run; still lost though because I suck.
---
It's also a dead draw. It's better to just have good cards in your deck.

---
Overall I wouldnt reccomand pick that treasure but if u somehow manage to cast it multiple times its definitly worth it
---
It wraps the word on the button? What a ghetto gaming company lol
---
Yes, Please.
---
We were referring to the use of the Hearthstone treasure anyway, not losing to the boss
---
Looks like he has nobody in rl who'd suck it, so no wonder he's frustrated.
---
It's not a dead draw, because it's an auto draw at start of game. Only inconvenience is it takes up room in the hand
---
Stop playing wild, boom solved

5/-/- | Force each minion to attack another random minion.  
---
I was most being a smartass. But thanks, I had no idea he came back at all.
---
I can usually beat the plague lords in 1-2 runs. The challenge for me right now is trying to win with each signature treasure, each deck and each hero power, since it checks them off after you successfully defeat the plague lord with them.
---
That's what we call an alternate win condition.  Not the worst thing for that deck to run.
---
Neither deck is considered very good as it stands.
---
He was a silver knight hand and then a lone champion until he took an arrow in the knee
---
Your win condition is primarily Fatigue.  You get so much armor your opponent can't possibly kill you.  OP is running Jade Idol so he can at least go even in the mirror when the opponent runs Jade Idol too. (or against decks that run an infinite combo like Reno decks)
---
It really is. I suggest drafting a lot of cards that provide random spells, this is what eventually got me a deck that could consistently trigger her battlecry
---
Fair enough, but on the other hand, it will bail me out of the "Your money or your life" line.

The best thing is that he made a missplay just as he was talking about it showing how much he cared about the moment they met.

That sounds pretty awesome. Taunt negates the old murk eye burst outta nowhere, hero power lets you generate enough resources to compete with giant fin. Seems good.
---
Totally agree. Annoying how when something like this comes up, where it obviously could go a few directions depending on developer choices, apologists always come out of the woodwork saying, "this is how it should work you dum-dum." I personally think developers should work towards a positive player experience but what do I know.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why these peasants don‚Äôt know how a draw works in every pve. Thanks for being very clear for them:).
---
The üÖ±ancient one!!!
---
Could you explain or hmu with a link to recommendations?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just him having trouble and my google search led me to guides on how to build control warrior rather than account for it.
---
Can you imagine though if you had a really good deck and expected to win in the event of a rematch?  So you're like "never mind, this went badly but I'll just make it a draw and immediately get a second attempt and win in the rematch" only to find it had kept the boss at 9hp and you had to go through a whole fresh run?  This result isn't always a downside.
---
I know, they're a step above a gimmick. I can't be the only one though that despises them
---
Theory: Madam Lazul, a known faceless, killed the real Finley and shapeshifted into the Sir Knight's appearance. League of E.V.I.L. has infiltrated into League of E.
---
I think it should probebly just be that draw is defeat and he stays at 9
---
Or he should just get a win, he beat the pleage lord, if thematicly losing to the PL is not death but a retread than a draw is a win
---
So censored art is bad but reused art isn‚Äôt?
---
Murloc Shaman is a goner if they pass here against Zoo. It's not exactly a deck that could "just tank a bit" and come back later.
---
This. Idk why they couldn't have made that an option or at least more clear in game.
---
Is this game good ?
---
It's not like you have options. You're sitting on 3 1's, a 2 and a dead card. You're going to get to play your cards. You're already reliant on them having bad draws. My play at least has a shot.
---
In no case you can coin Angler into a shit play that will get value traded if they play *anything but egg*.
---
Really he's just the evolved form of Fishflinger.
---
I wish it was offered to me :(
---
Meanwhile my golden Toki:
---
"Here have a Hobart Grapplehamer to make up for the tempo loss of playing a 6 mana 5/5"
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
F
---
No
---
&gt;That fresh Octosari to overdraw you 6-8 cards
---
FTFY
---
I think that if you enjoy the game you will keep playing it.  Can't fault people for wanting to take a break / leave if they are not enjoying it anymore.
---
Realistically all that Blizzard will probably do is release more powerful or interesting cards to draw people back.  Doubt they will be giving more freebies out or restructure anything as that involves development time.
---
I got something similar. On Vesh, he played plague of murlocs and gave me the 4/2/5 murloc that draws a card when a friendly murloc dies. My zero mana treasure was hiding on the bottom of my deck. so I played something, went face with the treasure and then traded a murloc to draw it into my hand again. Repeat around 5 times.
---
It would extremely cringey.
---
1. Crabs should not be made for tribes whose members often cost in excess of four mana
---
2. It's hard to make tech restricted to one class work, especially secret since secrets on their own suck
---
   1. In fact, it can be argued that an anti-battlecry secret would be too useful as a method to against many decks ensure your secret synergies trigger as many decks do not play large (if any) number of battlecry minions.
---
3. There aren't enough secrets played in Standard to really justify playing any anti-secret tech. Even then, what sort of anti-secret tech could be made at three mana if destroying one with a body is priced at four and destroying all with a body is priced at five mana?
---
4. As far as midrange decks looking to close out games are concerned, a silenced taunt is a destroyed taunt.
---
5. That sort of tech card is the exact opposite tech Team 5 wants to make the least.
---
Playing tech cards shouldn't be something you do without opportunity cost. If sideboard play was an aspect of playing on Hearthstone's ladder, yes, they would be more useful, but that in no way means new tech options need to be made stronger.
---
Plus, remember that when you drop that perfect tech card, you may be having the time of your life, but you're opponent is quite likely cursing you out behind their screen.
---
For playing weak deck? Ok
---
I'm all in for the Coin + Angler and it seems that there's nothing either of us could say that's changing either of us' minds and that's fine.
---
The father you are the more Multics and the more better Multics are spawned
---
no dummy he's binging with babish
---
And no one can see that from this post.
---
not to mention the lackey, in a deck able to generate a very high number of them.
---
Feels like you would need a new set of propellers after that.
---
Small price to pay for a hilarious video though.
---
That would be a theoretical 'best case' but it's such a big missplay you should not really expect it to happen.
---
I upvoted you until you said Keleseth. I realize he didn't say whether it's standard or wild, but I don't see any green in the blur over the rankings/names.
---
how do you get so much armour?
---
The guy could have 5 pyroblasts in his deck
---
It's very high risk low reward rng. 'Battlecry: win the game but low chance to lose your account.'
---
Have you seen how high it‚Äôs mulligan win rate is??? /s
---
Ahh I thought you were Reno since you have those Mage cards
---
I didn't screenshot when he played the card because how the hell was I supposed to know he'd cast that üòÇ
---
as another wild player tell my how you feel about the power level of mill right now? I feel like as a mill player i have so many more defensive options and basically infinte cards in the deck with all the shuffling they can do.
---
I swear this guy cheats lol. Always resurrects an old murk-eye, and a 10/10 even though his resurrection pool is filled with tinyfins
---
Well yes. If you are playing line cracker druid don't include the card that destroys line cracker druid. But also you can't complain about the deck then.
---
Oh, a player like you knows the line: "I hunger!"
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
In casual or at the safe cut of ranks (15,10,5), I cant blame them.
---
It's indeed boring and frustrating to play against cause its a little bit like Quest Rogue back in the days, you play your stuff ignoring pretty ereything the opponent playing.  There next to no interaction in those games.
---

Yeah prepurchase at blizzard.com
---
thank you
---
This is awesome
---
Wouldn't hesitate to drop there if I ever have the chance :)
---
r/wildhearthstone
---
mhm. And from a practical perspective you might as well Underbelly turn 2 and coin out a 1 drop and hope for a high roll.
---
Arguably Handbuff paladin is the most aggressive deck right now. The magnetic mechanic coupled with buffs&amp; mechwarper means they can kill incredibly quickly with minions that are difficult to deal with (Warlock's plague is one of the few, consistent ways to do so early on). 
---
Secret mage has moreso morphed into a burn-heavy midrange deck that seeks to clear their opponent's board and then burst them down. So closer to Odd rogue than Pirate Warrior.
---
blizzard.ru.com
---
Secret mage kills your really fast. One of the best aggro decks in wild right now
---
So tell us. Did it hit?
---

If you remove the stuff I added/start with to just get only the deck:
---
-Twist-Plague of Madness 
---
-Rocket Backpacks
---
-VIP Membership
---
-3x Kirin Tor Elemental
---
-Ronin
---
Other than that, that's the deck!
---
epic gamer moment
---
Save your dust. 1600 to craft whizbang the wonderful. It‚Äôs a card that will give u a random good deck to play with each game. That‚Äôs best way for f2p players to learn game. Then once u find or see a deck you really like, save all dust accumulated to craft that deck. Also play arena. Helps teach cards and in most cases it‚Äôs better bang for buck compared to just buying packs.
---
No you are being grilled for being stupid
---
You claimed there was no other free game. Now suddenly you know about yugioh and shadowverse? Shadowverse arguably has more flair in it as its PvE mode is a full blown jrpg style story and it's animations are fairly over the top.
---
Yugioh is fairly bland but that's because most players play in the mode with less models because it's a battery drain to run the 3d models
---
How the fuck do you not know mtga? How inside of a bubble are you?
---
Like dude branch out try some new stuff
---
TOO SOON.
---
I need this deck...
---
He went rank 5 to legend with his quest mage. Keep in mind kibler has decades of card game experience so hes pretty good at piloting bad decks.
---
no
---
Opponent suddenly gets two blackhowl gunspires from unexpected results.
---
Clever disguise --&gt; tree of life....
---
Fuck you‚Äôre right dude, I guess I really meant polish. I said a lot of other things too. What‚Äôd you think of the rest?
---
Playing a card designed for 8 mana and thus later game play, for possibly 1 mana isn't broken?  
---
Heh ok.
---
I really want that brawl where you draft 2 cards comes back.
---
Deck of Wonders and black cat was fucking hilarious.
---
does he mean in his deck , or the  amount he can summon ?
---
He could be referring to the fact that Sir Finley is a murloc
---
how much was the commission? I mean if the title was "look at my Fanart" it would be ok, but since you are promoting yourself with a free commercial and a link to your twitter, about drawing for commissions then my question looks fair...
---
how da hell have you guys not hit the turn limit yet
---
The only tech card the game really needs at this point is anti-armour tech. Its strictly better health with no way of punishing it, and often leads to the most degenerate playstyle possible, fatigue. A way to deal with would be very welcome (or just make Alexstraza reduce armour as well, thatd work).
---
Skull, cube, guldan win. 5 mana dearhrattle summon voidlord. 4 mana heal for 7. 1 mana destroy minion heal a shit ton.
---
May have been the anomaly that lets you get loot from any class
---
hmmm i usually win because he played plague of murlocs , tho to be fair i did have the titanic ring when he did that , its funny also because he cast it twice when i get way to good of a roll.
---
At least you stand a chance if they draw both tip the scales. Allot of broken decks have given me nightmares
---
I can't believe this happened, who won?
