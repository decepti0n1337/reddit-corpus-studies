Khadhar could be good on a tempo mage deck

Ok...

---
And what does creating a portal or teleporting a city have to do with creating clones?
---
If the meme is alive, its not longer a meme. The idea was to be a meme card, but ended up being strong. Same goes for mind control, "meme" idea with strong effect but pretty high cost, that actually was pretty good just for the 10 mana cost of it.

They didn't have artwork for Malygos and Chillmaw, so they used similar existing artwork for Kalecgos and Sindragosa instead.
---
They didn't want to commission additional artwork back then, because small indie company, etc. Now that they've laid off the plushy designer, they can finally afford bespoke artwork for the game.
---
There has always been a bit of a disconnect in peoples minds too about how priest got all the theft mechanics instead of rogue  
---
Blagh
---
I was nervous throwing my opinion about this on reddit. I am glad to see a lot of others tired of the same tool reprinted. Res ability for priest is so boring already. Just stop it bliz, please.
---
Well that was before they were forced into a corner by making priest minions expensive because they can be healed but then giving all the other classes overly efficient removal. Instead of resurrection I'd love to see a priest only keyword that is a spirit of redemption like effect, the minion on death becomes a spirit, so same class of effect as the imp portal but only until the end of the priests next turn, that provides a temporary benefit. 
---
yeah but they have to tag as re-run
---
Even Warlock to rank 3, even Shaman to rank 1, and Kingsbane Rogue to legend.
---
Congrats! Hopefully they'll have cool rewards in the near future for 1000+ wins too so you can shoot for that!
---
Its not a bug, spell damage affects healing effects if they become damage effects, because they are damage.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or are you refering to the spell not indicating that it does X damage correctly? If thats the case, then yeah they should change that.
---
Guaranteed he'll watch and rewatch many Youtube tutorials on how to open that damned thing.
---
This won't ever happen as a Tavern Brawl because it won't be different ruleset for people who own all/most of the cards.
---
That being said I'm surprised there hasn't been a 'Free Weekend' kind of thing where all the cards are available.

Bronze Herald is a new 3/2 RoS dragon and they always said they wanted Dragon to feel big and strong so they were trying to avoid printing weak dragons. Not anymore. No time for flavor! 
---
How am I going to OTK someone without Maly though? I don't want another expansion with zero OTK decks even close to viability. 
---
0/10 value not infinite, needed to draw wisp to win
---
If maly rotated, I wouldn't be sad at all. However, I think priest classic cards are the actual problem.
---
haha of course. isn't that the definition of anything that is viable? 
---
It does work as OP is posting. You can test it yourself. Auchenai makes regenerate become a damage spell, and malygos does affect it, empowering it.
---
This has been known from beta, stop spreading missinformation.
---
I have not. Hold on.  
---
.
---
.  
---
That seems pretty good. 4/7/7 even without Overload. This actually does make this card good!
---
I think that's the attack voice line.
---
Still waiting on a Mass Teleportation for mage that‚Äôs this but recruits/summons from deck instead
---
*Remembering armor gain doesn‚Äôt equal health*
---
I don't think Lazul's theme is on necromancy, more likely it's divination as she is a fortune teller. From the looks of her card this translates to seeing cards in your opponent's card and getting copies of them. This style of play could possibly work with Priest's other rastakhan legendary, Princess Talanji. 
---
It does affect it if an auchenai-like effect is in place.
---
Good thinking.
---
There should be a weekend or something where certain expansion would be available. Like League of Legends, for example, that enables certain champions every week so you can have a taste of them. Very new-player friendly stuff.
---
Thank you! And that would be really cool to see actually. I hope they do something along those lines. Although 1000+ Ranked wins would definitely take awhile for me haha.

It's terrible against any form of aggression, too slow against combo and mill Rogue: Shadow Vision is good enough to get more Spellstones against control.
---
So who in kalecgos art?

He‚Äôs not saying all cards available if you have them, he‚Äôs saying a brawl where all cards are unlocked for everyone regardless of collection.
---
*'Whoosh' 'Slicing sounds'*

I followed Toast.

I think it's part of rogues class identify to not have heal cards
---
I needed this. Thank you.
---
It's not even this turn, it's this game? This will be played for sure. 
---
It's already been done with brann
---
I was Enhancement and ducked out before or if that spec improved.
---
I reroll pack quests because I already have a complete classic collection. I prefer getting gold now because I want to be able to buy packs from the new expansion with gold rather than craft cards at a loss.
---
I already hate you
---
Hearthstone - RTS version
---
I must have misread the chalk board then! I thought it simply said you had to make a deck from your collection entirely (which isn't much good for me as mine is very sparse to say the least)
---
no i survive till the end of the turn and win just like last time
---
Maybe they shouldn't resurrect with full health?
---
I think not because this effect is unique in the entire game
---
If I ever got this combo to trigger, it would be against a priest with 2 SW:Death cards in their hand.
---
Lmao at how lazy most of these cards have been. They literally made one card to make sure the other card would see play so that the other card sees play. Brilliant!
---
Well it definitely goes from card -&gt; token on play, but that's beside the point.
---
And again, whether or not the card 'is' the minion is irrelevant. It's a card, and when you play it a minion is summoned. That makes it a card that summons a minion. The fact that 'you' play it also doesn't matter, that applies to every action in the game. It's the card that contains the effect.
---
How long can this go on.
---
Wow. That‚Äôs ANYTHING BUT A SHARD
---
Legendary spells were actually Boomsday. Witchwood was Even/Odds. No real high powered gimmick in RR (just the Loa).
---
It's actually there because there's a new 2 mana 2/1 Rush Deathrattle: summon a 1/1 murloc minion that depicts a murloc riding a boar.
---
The condition kind of sucks for druid because you have to take 5 damage before you can start armoring up. You basically have to lose board control in the early rounds to use this at which point you're just using this as a janky board clear.
---
True.  But they'll lose 50 games first.   Getting Khadgar and Barnes in hand early enough.  Without drawing the ancient one.   It'll happen but it will be rare for anyone playing that deck.
---
Welp, maybe I could be an artist after-all. 
---
Nah mage spell
---
Why not both
---
Also in early, early Combo Druid where you'd stall until Maly plus double Innervate Swipe/Moonfire/Moonfire as a finisher.

Naxx is out? But for real, congrats.
---

---
You all need to stop arguing like I am shitting on the card. I think the card is good, but not as good as some people are making it out to be. Specifically the people who want to curve turn 1 Sludge Slurper turn 2 Lackey. My original point is that a lot of the Lackeys suck when played on turn 2. The other issue is that the Lackey is totally random. The effects can be good, but they are very situational.
---
It's going to be fun to play around with, and it'll lead to a lot of very interesting turns where you need to strategize how to use the Lackeys most effectively. However, that doesn't change the fact that randomness like this makes cards really unreliable. Remember Crackle (1/4 chance) ? Boombots (1/4 chance)? Implosion (1/3 chance)? Prenerf Tuskarr Totemic (3/8 chance for a real card) ? People hated how random those cards were. They could either do very little or do amazing. And Lackeys are have a worse chance of getting what you want, a 1/5 chance. Not only that, the chance will go down as l they add more Lackeys in future expansions. The card is still good because it has so many possible synergies with Hagatha, murlocs, Likkem, Shudderwock, etc. but people are being blindsided by only imagining the perfect scenarios where they get the exact Lackey they want on the perfect turn they want.
---
Dragon waifus best waifus
---
Funny this post exists. I always felt really weird that 12 decently trained army men can take down a Dragon that's the literal incarnation of power and death. Even better yet, 12 baby murlocs can kill a dinosaur that is immune to fucking spellcasting, so for instance, he's immune to fire. Really makes me ponder sometimes lol
---
Yeah, I know, I just figured I'd play devil's advocate and bring up the niche possibility - cuz as we all know, Blizzard LOVES to clarify card text after the fact (Ethereal Peddler, Deathstalker Rexxar). I just felt compelled to mention it, no harm intended. ( '-')v

---
You are going out of your way to take my argument out of context. My original reply was to someone who got a few hundred of upvotes for saying that this card will see play because you can curve it out on turn 1. Just because you realize that turn 2 Lackeys aren't that great doesn't mean everyone thinks that way. And I posted a couple hours after the card was revealed. Was I supposed to know exactly how everyone thought of the card, when one of the top posts was about curving out the Lackey? All my original reply was meant to do was to point out how people should not just assume that a turn 2 Lackey is good. That is all. If you agree, that's good. You can stop trying to pick a fight and argue, when we are both agreeing on the same point. 
---
And you are right, the Lackeys aren't all bad. However, like my original point, I am talking about turn 2. On turn 2, some Lackeys are objectively better than others. You are right that late game, all the Lackeys can be situationally useful, similar to Ysera cards or Lich King cards. And I already did talk about how the card is pretty good value, though to compare it to Ysera, Lich King, Lyra, and Hagatha is a far stretch. Those are all late game cards that generate multiple cards, increasing the chance you will actually get something you want while also giving your opponent the mana and removal options to deal with them since it is late in the game. It is definitely more comparable to Swashburglar and Babbling Book, which both saw a good amount of play. And I did talk about how the card was pretty good value, and how it would be fun to strategize how to play the Lackeys based on the situation.
---
 But apparently you just want to antagonize everything I say, and ignore the parts where I actually agree with you, because you are so focused on trying to argue.

Because it's good for content creators to have something in their video besides just a reveal and a clip of the card being played?

I have to move rexxar to classic...only because I have him and not the others  
---
Don't mind Jaina technically since it's less of a steamroll of Gul'dan, Gul'dan= ban, Jaina = wild 
---
While I do think this is a good idea, it doesn't address the main problem with the resurrect mechanic which is the ability to cheat out token minions to get them in the rez pool early, and eventually have duplicates of that minion in the rez pool anyway. What they need to do is make it so that minions that are copies from the deck (barnes/Cloning gallery) do not add to the rez pool.
---
make quests to be able to play the hero cards. i hate them having them on curve
---
This is easy: jainna classic, guldan wild and ban rexxar forever üôÉ
---
I just can't upvote, the 69 only makes it better
---
Classic - Jaina - Actually not as broken as the others, for some matchups anyways. Get enough aggro, and you can just crush Jaina before she can even heal. Same with having a board, if you keep it, while dealing with the elementals, eventually your damage can exceed 3 health heals.
---
Wild - Rexxar - In wild, where the beast pool is much bigger, this card can be fun and not broken. In standard we will get a lot of beasts rotating, but I don't want this card shaping games anymore.
---
Remove - Guldan. In standard, this card doesn't have a lot left. But, it's the 3 damage 3 lifesteal that is so strong and swingy, as well as basically giving you back the board if you played a lot of demons. In wild, this card will just get stronger and stronger, especially having access to all the demons you would run with this card. So sadly, Guldan has gots to go :(
---
How is that 32 and 30? I see 16 and 14.

---
Wtf
---
Old cards always shine because of new expansions 
---
&gt;The game shouldn't be balanced around brand new players. Anyone that can hit rank 5 will be able to play freeze mage to an extent where differences in skill are negligible. 
---
The deck litterally had the highest difference of win-rate between new and experienced players based on rank and games played for several years. It is not a "just be competent" deck anyone can carry themselves with. It's rare for tier lists to even mention the deck exists anymore.
---
&gt;Freeze mage, and all combo decks, don't have meaningful decisions. They are always formulaic. Some are more complicated than others (APM priest), but every single game they will have the same plan and do the same thing
---
You just proved you have no idea how to play combo. You have to be very flexible and pay attention to your outs at all times. There is a lot of probabillity  and interactions to manage. You might manage a 30% winrate with if all you ever do is "Freeze the board when the enemy has x damage, otherwise draw, and pray you get Alex, Fireball, Fireball, FrostBolt."
---
&gt;And regardless of whether the player is new or not, the person playing against the combo deck has absolutely no meaningful choices to make. Its either they're playing aggro and win unless draw rng fucks them, or they're playing control and lose unless draw rng fucks that mage.
---
You have a shallow understanding of the game, and don't understand how to put them into an uncormfortable position to make suboptimal decisions because you don't understand the choices they have and are making; so you're letting them control the game.
---
&gt;If people want to play a deck that doesn't require skill I'm honestly fine with that. But they shouldn't be able to lock the opponent into playing a zero skill game as well.
---
I wasn't stating an opinion about combo being skillfull. Sampling from hundreds of thousands of players across all ranks and regions Freeze Mage has had the largest diffrence in win-rate between both low vs high rank players, and new vs experienced players of the deck. 
---
You are the equivelent of someone who goes to play Street Fighter then complains the opponent is "locking them out of the game" by always blocking; Instead of you know, using the grab button, or stopping blind rush down for 5 seconds to see what the opponent does. 
---
Classic, Wild, ban. In that order. 
---
Chill. The deck wont exist when Shadow visions rotates.
---

No, this community is garbage. We are never happy or datisfied but yet we keep playing the game

Its worth noting baring them releasing some trash-tier dragons the dragon pool is looking pretty darn strong post rotation for dragons-roar. 
---
Even just the removal of Temporus is a pretty ok buff to roar lol
---
Yooo, this would be so sick. I'm wagering it's gonna be some generic "summon any dragons you've played previously this game" or something similar that *juuust* barely scratches the surface of chronological flavor.

---
Seems two slow at 8 mana, I mean it only pairs with soularaiam and life tap, maybe if they had more heavy draw but it still seems to situational because you have to play it and draw cards and have those minions be big enough for the board to kill stuff or deathrattles.
---
"a copy of a minion" that's actually good, u can consider it as a free removal each turn, u just have to draw a card at turn it played (like with the hero power)
---
That's true but I still have my doubts on if this can see competitive play. Maybe it'll be good if we get more Anna synergy in future sets.

It's kind of like a bigger Dollmaster Dorian that has the ability to synergize with big statted minions, not just ones with good abilities. I really like the idea of using this with Deranged Doctor or perhaps even Dr. Morrigan.

Or 2 mana draw 2 demons.

need DR demons to make it work better though.

You have the clip?

That's what I thought! Maybe this card won't be the best in standard but imagine all the possibilities in wild!...

I find it ridiculous how little care Team 5 gives to mobile clients. Let's be real, more and more people don't play on their computers anymore, they do it on phones and tablets. I was close to quitting HS once already because it didn't work on my iPad for the longest time. I sticked around because it still works on my iPhone. I'm sure I'm not alone and I'm sure it's one of the reasons for the game's slow decline.
---
Nope, but its being replayed constantly on stream. Basically: 
---
1) The Warlock plays this Fel Lord, taps, draws Morrigan.
---
2) Fel Lord summons Morrigan copy with Rush, which attacks the enemy Lord of the Arena, pulling Leeroy.
---
3) Leeroy goes face for lethal.
---
Ehh, you mean 3 mana?
---
The word "Vanilla" is just an adjective to describe "bland / generic / basic", and in Hearthstone case, refers to "no card text". 
---
So "Vanilla" is not a stat line, it is the "Vanilla Cards" that give an average stat line. 
---
&gt; I'd take the vanilla 4/4 for 4 and hope not to draw it.
---
So he means he'd take the plain 4/4 minion for the over-costed 4 mana and hope not to draw it.
---
Aah, yes. Fel Lord Buttplug
---
All of them no shaman class cards.

but only for 4 days. ANd then they way want to buy the nice cards they tested

This guy is actually from WoW, he's one of the bosses in the Violet Hold. He even has the same axe.

Also, his axe has the E.V.I.L. symbol on it. Looks like he has joined the E.V.I.L. team.
---

---
This uh... Doesn't seem good. Even if you hit a big Demon (which there isnt too many left) with your lifetap (which is fairly unlikely) its basically just crowd roaster type effect 
---
The draw 3 card could be ok at 9 mana you will be discarding most of those cards.
---
I mean... Its a good roll for bane of doom I suppose 
---
So now i do not understand  \[\[Dr. Morrigan\]\] stats/cost even more...

Solarium was the first thing I thought of.  It's like the hunter legendary Flark's Boomzooka but you get to choose the attacks and a must kill 5/7 is still on the board.

We've seen similar effects in the past [[dollmaster dorian]] but rush and the full body is huge. Perhaps there's a [[star aligner]] combo lurking around the corner for this card ü§î. Could be extremely powerful or forgettable. I'm excited either way.

Zoo doesn‚Äôt want the game to go until turn 9. If you‚Äôre pulling off a 9 mana two card combo in zoo, it better end the game, not put rush minions/deathrattles on the field and contribute 0 face damage.

Priest doesn't win through tempo. They win all at once whether through a Velen combo, divine spirit + inner fire, or Alex into mind blasts. Every turn before that is them controlling the state of the game. You can't just chip away at them or they heal through it. But invest too much into the board and you can lose it all through Scream or Hysteria. They can be close to death and heal to full with a spell damage Spirit Lash or Amara. Also you almost always lose value trades because of their hero power, so you have to commit to going face or full clearing their minions.
---
Basically priest forces you to play by their rules. Not to mention how frustrating it is when priests beat you with cards they stole from your deck or minions they took from your side of the board.
---
What about all of the bad spells he missed? There were plenty of cards that could have messed up the OTK, for example \[\[Gang Up\]\], you would have to factor those in too.

---
Murloc package was not a thing until rockpool and that card is rotating.
---
It will be really useful in Wild though for Cubelocks and Renolock. 
---
The problem is that you're relying on a combo of 2 weak-to-mediocre legendaries, you've crippled yourself for the rest of the game if you don't win immediately, and the payoff is far from game-winning. Many controlling decks (Priest, Warrior, some Mage and Warlock variants, Paladin if they end up running Equality) can simply clear a board of vanilla 6/6's, and if you have the breathing room to pull of a combo like this against aggro/midrange as Rogue you were in a good spot anyway. FWIW, I will be trying this anyway if I  end up pulling Nomi. 
---
I think Nomi's only chance to see competitive play is as a way to force a board wipe with one card if the meta ends up really heavy on control warrior/priest.

Youre the kind of guy who said Prince Keleseth was trash and that it wouldnt see play in Zoo decks because the deck needed more 2 drops. We havnt seen all cards yet - we simply dont know yet. Its unlikely a 8 mana card will see play in a zoo deck. However, saying it 100% wont see play is just ignorant. People have been wrong before.

For me it sounds like a card designed for the "Specialist" competitive meta; Looks a lot worse than deathlord on a vacuum (+1 mana for +1 attack and immediate drawback instead of delayed) but when you think you can "sideboard it" onto a anti-aggro version of the deck, it suddenly looks more appealing. Makes me want specialist ranked.

And it also never really saw play, they werel taking about Mecha'thun decks that saw play.
---
I think "at end of turn" is used with other cards too.
---
Reading into this post I'm happy that I managed to snack a win vs double Jaina (mostly bc first on curve, 2nd bottom 3). I thought I missed copy effect.

Sure, but that doesn't mean that zoo is not running an 8 drop is sufficient or valid reasoning. If I say the sky is blue because elephants are Grey, yeah the sky is blue, but not because of what I said. Versions of zoo have included 8+ mana minions. 
---
So you want blizzard to somehow ban tier 1 and 2 decks from casual?
---
&gt; imagine Cubelock had had that card in it's prime. 1 mana Voidlords and Cubes, or even 1 mana lackeys.
---
None of which are really relevant if you only get to combo with them on turn 10. The scariest you can do it pop the lackey and cube combo a doomguard that late in the game. 
---
What I personally like about this card, compare to cloning gallery, is that it at least draws the minions, removing them from the deck. It bothers me that shadow essence, gallery, and barnes all summon copies instead of the actual thing.
---
RIP combo and control players in Wild vs Mill Rogue even more
---
Isn‚Äôt this kinda the worse version of of dirty rat, because at least the rat would kill the hand synergy/combo set up. 
---
This doesn‚Äôt do that outright. 
---
Am I right? Or is this card actually good 
---
!remindme 12 days
---
Your vague wording is easy to misinterpret. This card is still not on par with Barnes in terms of highrolling. This into Sylvanas is extremely specific, and not nearly as game winning as just playing Barnes on 4. Stealing a 3/3 with taunt from Kingsbane Rogue and a 3/3 buffed up dude from odd paladin is much worse than Barnes.
---
You act like every deck in Wild is a control deck, even though the only decks the insane highroll is good against is a dumb Cubelock player, a Big Priest (keep in mind this is happening either turn 5 or turn 9, in which case stealing a minion from big priest won't matter most of the time) or a Renolock. Aggro is 75% of the meta, so this highroll is actually bad for you 75% of the time. Barnes is never bad when he highrolls. 
---
"And the inclusion of just one card would not significantly reduce the deck's winrate" haha, if you seriously think Renolock still naturally runs Sylvanas, then you've been living under a rock. You would have to replace at least 2 anti-aggro cards for this, which slaughters your winrate further (having Ooze against Kingsbane Rogue is almost necessary to win, same goes for Zilliax or Healbot).
---
PS: this discussion was never about the card being fun, it was about the cars being good. Come up with 1 realistic example where this card would be good.

It's a well designed hate card, then. It's not an auto-include in every deck for the next two years: if big value control decks are popular you don't want to risk bringing out a 9-mana fatty on turn 4. But if it's an aggro-centric meta where you're only pulling out a 1-or-2 drop it's fantastic.
---
This is exactly the kind of targeted tech card the game needs more of.
---
It really depends on how it‚Äôs casted and presented, if it‚Äôs sterile like the last couple of years of e-sports I won‚Äôt be watching.
---
As with any anthology series there‚Äôs some episodes that are great and other less so. I would say there‚Äôs more than half I‚Äôd actively watch again and enough that made me wanting more. 4/5 - though I agree some were way to over sexualised (I‚Äôm looking at you the witness?).
---
No
---
Same, but I got double Mechathuns. I don't think the Priest could handle that.
---
Hearthstone doing a collab with wow? Nice!
---
Thats fair. The dk is definitely much less obnoxious in standard. It can still be pretty bad with cubes and faceless though.

This is worse than both Dirty Rat and Deathlord. It is worse than rat because rat is cheaper and hand&gt;deck. It is worse than Deathlord because Deathlord is cheaper and has synergy with Nzoth, play dead etc. 
---
Would be better at 4 mana, maybe subtract 1/1 and add overload 2. And make it a shaman card
---
How do you mechanically control the two effects though? Would they trigger on the same target, doing 2 damage first and healing for 5 after, or?
---
The graveyard could even be an entire selling point of a new expansion. Instead of a new keyword there could be a graveyard and a bunch of new cards that play off the graveyard.
---
&gt; And the minions you draw are still discarded.
---
You can get them back with a Soulwarden
---
At end of turn is perfectly fine. At the end of turn would be flat out bad wording. At the end of your turn would be the alternative, but at end of turn communicated the same message more concisely.
---
This isn‚Äôt a mistake, it‚Äôs how they meant to write it. 
---
you play it at 9 Mana and if a big thing comes out you can magnetic Zilliax on it and remove it.
---

This is so fucking bad.

---
Not really. The attack does though. This might actually kill something.
---
My favorite card from MTG is Debtors Knell and I'd LOVE to see something like that translated into Magic.
---
A lot worse than Deathlord. Deathlord had a deathrattle and it was hard to kill in one or two turns because it came down on turn 3. It gave you time to Inner Fire or silence or even do nothing and give your opponent a minion 2-3 turns later.
---
--
---
This one is battlecry, comes down 1 turn later than Deathlord and only has 1 more attack.
---
Terrible IMHO. 
---
:(
---

---
Nerds ussauly are perverts or anti sex so makes sense that your not comfortable with the human body if you dont like your own.

The sexualization wasnt bed since love death and robots is a spiritual succesor to heavy metal if you ever saw those.
---
I think people tend to have sex irl and it's a big part of relationships and life and was done in every episode to add to the story it wasnt balant best a random person being fucked.
---
l'elite de Hearthstone, sounds good
---
you can be overloaded at turn 2 since you have a 1 mana lackey, and all the lackey that have been showed are kinda OP.

They already explained that non-evergreen keywords like echo, magnetic, or recruit are only going to be used in the expansions they appeared, but not outside of it for flavour purposes, and because maybe we would have 1 or 2 recruit cards in standard outside of the main recruit expansion, and therefore players comming new would have to learn a lot of keywords that are only used in very few cards.
---
So things like rush remain and will be used a lot. Things like recruit are more rare and will not be called recruit.
---
&gt;people(you) thought this was the most broken thing ever 
---
The one quote I could find of myself stating how meta-defining this card would be is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9zeyyz/why_i_think_revenge_of_the_wild_is_overrated/ea99pgm/):

Maybe it's worse than dirty rat but it's better than deathlord and deathlord was played constantly. Dirty rat or not, it's the next best combo deck destroyer.
---
True but how much can you disrupt your opponent's combo? Unless they are running only 2-3 minions which are only parts of a combo, then sure. It's a fringe case scenario.
---
shroombrewer (warlock),Mountain/molten giant (warlock), Toxicologist (rogue), devilsauer egg ish (hunter), happy ghoul (warlock), Raid leader (paladin), clockwork automatron (mage),charged devilsaur (hunter), King togwaggle (druid), Froswolf warlord (paladin) 
---
This is suposed to be combo disruption, not a tempo play or an inner fire enabler.
---
Yeah, deathlord was more flexible, but this has his uses, like zilliax.
---
If you can remove it with 6 damage, it was probably not that bad anyway. Many of the big threats like Obsidian Statue and Lich King are rotating out, we'll have to see what late game horrors are to come
---
you got a link üëÄ
---
Ah, a man of culture as well I see.
---
strong disagree, deathlord was really strong because of the deathrattle. 
---
when it's a deathrattle effect, you can do things like AOE the whole board after he dies, or stall out aggro decks with the massive taunt with no immediate downside.
---
It'll be its main use, like dirty rats. Sure it probably won't be guaranteed but a card or 2 in your deck that could ruin your opponents entire gameplan could be pretty good. Just depends on the meta
---
You could play it as Rogue on turn 7 with a Walk the Plank if you pull out a Maly or something
---
This is the correct answer. Everyone else is wrong.

Best card in the set, right here

This card is interesting, but it's the opposite of what you want. If it's not a random minion your opponent can just summon their most expensive minion, or they can just protect their combo piece by picking any other minion in their hand. Either way they either get a tiny minion to protect a combo, or a massive minion to kill you on turn 4.
---
I don‚Äôt think it sees much play in either format (there are way better combo decks), but I think the issue that both OP and I have is that most of the options players have for tech cards are just completely random. Tempo decks work against Combo, so Blizzard hasn‚Äôt really seem much need to actually do anything, but it‚Äôs not exactly a new issue that Control gets the crap beaten out of it against Combo with little to be done even when you play as aggressively as possible, simply because Control tends to lack the pressure that is currently the only consistent ‚Äúcounterplay‚Äù.
---

It's not about demographic quotas (I don't need a diversity check box), it's about the messages the episodes (for the most part, there are some exceptions) convey. The entire show is marketed and aimed at teenage boys or old men that get off from feeling superior to women. 
---
Fincher is a brilliant director, but it doesn't mean he's not also a sexist jerk. Two decades after Fight Club, this guy still hasn't learned that women are more than just a tool to make male characters seem more 'macho'.

That said, this isn't the subreddit for this discussion, nor did I really want to initiate it. I just commented because I'm still carrying a bitter aftertaste from being so disappointed in L, D &amp; R. I'll just take my downvotes and leave it at that. 
---
While this is a fantastic suggestion that is in many other CCGs, i don't think it would make much of a difference. Sure it would prevent crazy swings like when they 3x rez their barnes token; however, usually players stabilize by killing the resurrected minion, which would then be resurrected again. It's a good idea but won't affect the deck THAT much.
---
What I get from this is that you are sure that you are right and everyone else should either agree on hating Blizzard or be a fanboy. That does not seem like a proper convo topic to me. Especially when the matter is something so extremely specific. I hope you find the support you wish(?) for though. Good luck.

Is it any good?
---
This will be a beast in arena. 
---
Elemental? This is surely a Kobold. 
---
Rexxar isn‚Äôt even really problematic, but I think he is poor game design, so I would remove him from the game
---
Jaina does similar things to rexxar (wins the game with a hero power over time), but doesn‚Äôt do it with the inevitability or efficiency as rexxar, And has come to be synonymous with control mage‚Äôs. I would move Jaina into classic for this reason, and it also fits the fact that classic mage cards are very strong in general for no reason.
---
Finally, I would move Guldan to wild. I play wild, and only wild, and he belongs here. There is nothing problematic about the power level of his card, and there are countless answers to the board state he produces. If anything, maybe his hero power shouldn‚Äôt be as cost efficient for what it does, so a decrease in damage by 1 would be reasonable maybe, if you really wanted him changed at all. 
---
Overall, I think that all three of these cards are fine in the game right now, since in wild, where these cards are going shortly, the only card I think was designed poorly (Rexxar) isn‚Äôt even that strong. However, if I had to choose, I think Guldan is the stronger of the other two and It would be ridiculous if he was added to the classic set. An argument could be made that Guldan is only good in standard if there are good demons in standard- like right now- and that Jaina is good no matter what, but I think that this is the reason Jaina could be in classic, because I believe that classic cards should see play, and she probably would always see play. On the other hand, maybe this isn‚Äôt good because it means that control mage would always be the pushed archetype, and much stronger non control mage cards. So actually, after reading what I just wrote, I don‚Äôt think they should do anything with any of these cards besides rotate them out of standard when the time comes.

Stormwatcher absolutely BTFO
---
The cooler [[Stormwatcher]]
---
No, it needs to heal you to do damage. There's a card that turns almost all your health to armor though... [[High Priest Thekal]]
---
Lightning strikes twice!
---
This looks like an amazing arena card, and maybe has the possibility to see some constructed play now the infinite value is rotating. 
---
This card seems really good actually: heal 8 health, deal 8 damage split across two attacks, and possibly be left with a body at the end? With an immediate impact, I could definitely see this being played if control Shaman becomes popular.
---
It's what we usually call *POWERCREEP* boi

Even if it draws 2 one drops it's still an arcane intellect + a 6/6. At worse this card is good at best it's game winning.

In arena this card will be great! Such a good catch up tool.
---
yea they should have figured low mana rush lifesteal and poisinous options would be op op
---
Oof
---
Shadow Essence for Shaman? Seems kinda lame. It even has anti-synergy with Shudderwock.
---
Idk what it means but that artwork is awesome!
---
Yeeeah.... In the reveal stream, didn‚Äôt Peter Whalen say that they switched out the Omega Defender art because it looked like a mech and that would have been to strong with Zilliax?
---
shit
---
So... more Big shaman?
---
also elemental synergy
---
Big Shaman help?
---
We're 5 minutes in, let's use the English thread.
---
Costs 1 more, stormwatcher is neutral.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isnt this just a worse [[deathlord]] ?? I mean since this is a battlecry, you might have options to immediately remove the minion. And this a mech so could be magnetized with a nice rush minions or something 
---
and then a skeleton popped out!!!
---
My condolences for the 3 illidans
---
I thought I was unlucky getting harbringer celestia twice, but this is on another level 
---
This is dust unless there's some stuuuupid combo with it.
---
One requires set up and the other requires that you sacrifice half your life
---
Skip to about 1:45 in the linked video.
---
This is a crazy good card for the right deck. Malygos comes to mind, of course.
---
Muckmorpher: 5/4/4 Battlecry transform into a 4/4 copy of a different minion in your deck.
---
Well done to them.
---
Nice to see the whole "Hearthstone P2W" argument fall flat on its face even today.
---
I feel it is going to be insane in Arena.  
---
For constructed it also seems very decent, actually.   
---
Not sure if the Elemental tag matters much, tho.  
---
Opponent plays this, it summons my blood of the ancient one. I play barns, which summons my other blood of the ancient one, and I summon the üÖ±Ô∏èncient one
---
"The killbots? It was a trifle...You see, the killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing this, I sent wave after wave of my own men..."
---
Reminds me of darth maul from the movie insidious, but yes great art.
---
Because the dolls dont die since dorian doesnt state the 1/1s he creates should die. The priest card (reckless experimenter) also only procs for minions played from hand, not summoned by dorian.
---
I can agree that the combo will not probably work, but your combo is something completely different than the one I was talking about.
---
Every expansion gave us a wiff of "damn, that could be good" and in the end either nothing changed or absolutely obnoxious shit like Quest Rogue dominated the ladder.
---
Some of the cards might look interesting but its up to the community what they make with it and as usual theyll use the most braindead shit and pollute the ladder with it. 
---
I got chu fam
---
Better go with Kyrie instead then.
---
Classic: Rexxar. Most creative card in such a long time. Potentially one of the most fun legendaries.  
---
Wild: Jaina. Elementals are good, but they‚Äôre never gonna run away with and steal the show. 
---
Ban: Guldan. I had a lot of fun playing with this and enjoyed it. But because Blizzard has to consider wild when printing cards, I think if one had to be put down it would be best for it to be this one. 
---
Surely they'll allow us to cheat it out for 8 mana somehow, so that sounds good to me!
---
https://www.hearthpwn.com/
---
yup. they gave shadow essence to shaman
---
I think it's better than al'akir. Life steal is a big thing with rush. Very very good card. 
---
Always Tarim!
---
Love it, love everything about it. It was about time standard got a new card in the vein of dirty rat/deathlord. 
---
On the other hand I play control a lot in wild so I‚Äôm sure the combo of having all 3 of these will be tilting but still, love it.
---
What is that to the right of tar creeper (tar creeper being under the car's right wheel)?
---
8 mana is too expensive and 4 attack is too weak. If there‚Äôs no corpsetaker, this card likely won‚Äôt see play 
---
As long as they fix the mobile crashing
---
[[Thaurissan]]
---
[[Dragon consort]]
---
Acolyte is a very bad example. Why do you think of it as a warrior card? Mage for example has used it extensively in control decks for years.

5/5/5 Dragon | Battlecry: The next Dragon you play costs (2) less.  
---
9 mana, draw 3 cards and dont draw 1 card 20 dmg combo.
---
Can this card Support deathrattle shaman? 
---
This just seems like a less consistent replacement for corpsetaker. Concerning because we are running out of shaman cards this set and only 1 seems to actually contribute to any sort of tempo play.
---
It really ruins the immersion that he says "scares" instead of "frightens" though.
---
I thought the opponent was playing quest priest and might have just had Mecha'thun in the first place. But there were probably other minions it could have pulled and we have no clue how many. There's also the odds of discarding your hand through other means before killing Mecha'thun with another spell.
---
No one here will ever (and more importantly, should ever) come close to actually figuring this out fully.
---
Probably not, you are correct. Midrange decks tend to whither in wild. Synergies, good synergies at that, compromise the meta.
---
Is Rexxar used in wild as a staple?
---
Because I‚Äôll be so sad when this card dies. 
---
That can't be right because I've died to mcthun combos where the coffin guy summons the mcthun from hand. It might be a summon effect vs a create effect, but you don't have to play them
---
Honestly we don't even need an expansion for hyping up. Just the rotation of those 3 sets are enough for a new fresh meta because they are so strong.
---
If the face plays Taunt, me still go face.
---
what I want to know is, what are the odds of yogg killing himself with the first spell? (no minions on board)
---
my autocorrect is evil!, Tarim
---
Yep, then later on Mal'Ganis and N'Zoth are great to add
---
What happens to shudder if this hits?
---
No but for some reason they kept making art for HS where murlocs had noses.
---
No. It even says that on the card. 
---
‚ÄùDifferent minion‚Äù
---
You're gonna have a bad time Vs any priest
---
Damn if this was a neutral card it would work sooooo goood with freeze mage
---
Totally agree! The xpac is a bonus
---
&gt; So you're running Soularium in a late-game oriented deck just to have it on the off-chance you need this kind of combo?
---
No, you'd use it for it's primary draw purpose a lot of the time.
---
&gt; In a world where Crowd Roaster exists with synergistic Dragon cards, I don't think an 8 Mana 5/7 that combines with another card to make a 9+ Mana combo for "tempo" is going to be particularly strong.
---
Sure, Crowd Roaster is a good response, but if you played this combo, you already got value out of it. Crowd Roaster is almost always going to get good value so it's better if you can get immediate value out of your expensive cards if they're vulnerable to getting roasted.
---
&gt;Why bother with all this situational stuff when you can just run a one-card combo, Twisting Nether, and be done with it? A 5/7 body is not worth it.
---
Sure, sometimes you just gotta Twisting to stay alive another turn.  But there's a reason it has always floated in and out of warlock decks: you're often immediately behind on board again after you spent your whole turn playing it.  
---
And it's not *just* a 5/7 left over.  Say you've cleared their board and have Betrug as the last survivor.  If they just play some minion, your next draw step could summon a 'free' minion that deals with theirs and lets you further develop your board, making it that much harder for the opponent to come back.
---
4 attack and *freaking windfury*, which will likely heal for 8 and possibly kill two minions. And if it survives, they will spend ressources to kill it, it is too scary to be left alive for an extra turn. You couldn't end up with a +2-3 card advantage plus the healing.
---
I don't know, I think it will see play.
---
odd secret mage is pretty real and runs subject 9
---
Agreed.  So what's the maximum burst off this?  With coin you have 7 mana for burn spells.  In an EXTREME edge case, you could get that 1 mana lightning bolt spell 7 times for 56 damage, but realistically, you could cast 2 lava shocks for 20, tho in Wild a few high roll crackles could be quite terrifying.
---
If maly rogue is still a thing, I will hate this card
---
Use the nerf bat on Glenn's head! Others have done it before!
---
This is good with the Walking Fountain card that was also just revealed
---
That doesn't even make sense
---
I'd just climbed from rank 15 to 10 with the deck without losing a single game, but it takes all the fun out :(
---
You can always play casual and ignore ladder. Wild is GREAT for that.
---
Great animations, but the stories were almost always terrible and full of cliches. I understand that they can't fit a great story into 15 minutes but still, even as someone who likes good animation I couldn't bring myself to watch more than 5 or 6 episodes.
---
seriously, the fact that people think garbage like Muckmorpher "comboing" with Malygos is indicative of a problem is laughable
---
Yeah, you missed the most important part: the color blue 
---
(I feel the same way as you about the episode)
---
That‚Äôs at 8 mana. It‚Äôs hard to get there verse aggro and it‚Äôs not that great of a card in control verse control. 
---
I just saw the 5 mana 4/4 transform. This looks like it would see play because of that card but definitely not as a stand-alone. 
---
All good lmao
---
Dirty Bot
---
Welcome back to arena shaman
---
You can build a deck around this combo and [THIS ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b6k802/shaman_is_back_boyz_2/) at the same time. If you draw 1 legendary, the other combo is still in deck. Also if you met the required cards, both combos would do 20+ damage on their own.
---
Yeah always struggling to climb with top tier decks at rank 5-1 have all the cards still can‚Äôt make legend. I suck.
---
Everybody acts like they forgot about Gruul.
---
I wasn‚Äôt hyped for Rastakhan mainly due to the disappointment that was Boomsday. Which is a shame cuz that trailer and song were absolutely lit and trolls are awesome.
---
If this card were from year of the Raven it would have been run for sure.  But so many elementals are rotating out, I just dunno.
---
It's an amazing arena card though.  It can likely kill 2 minions and stay alive, or punch through a high HP taunt minion.  
---
Really good card in a specialist format to fuck up combos.
---
from his/her deck*
---
( Õ°~ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Nah he actually played that.  He was running a cloning gallery type deck with malygos/velen/zilliax and radiant elementals.  He never actually played the gallery tho.  Maybe he didnt draw it.
---
Depends on aggro. I don't want to play this and pull Savannah Highmane
---
Can't wait to build some more Christmas Trees.
---
:V
---
Why did he explained twinspell twice?
---
This is the exact type of card I predicted would be printed the second I saw Kelecgos.. get ready to discover this and Elementary Evocation 
---
My deck didn‚Äôt run the Corpsetaker package and only one copy of Fungalmancer. But your main point is one that I mirror. As I mentioned, lots of that deck is rotating out. But cards like Never Surrender! and Commander Rhyssa are just what the archetype needs, moving forward. I‚Äôm already theory-crafting a Secret Dragon Paladin deck. So...we‚Äôll see!
---
Rush on death wing would be hard to use ;)
---
hey wait thats an elf not a tauren
---
Hah, you know, people complain about ROG.... But I love randomness in games... 
---
What about dust devil? If unanswered that‚Äôs 6 face damage on turn 2
---
Seriously? This is the best Card HS has ever produced. It will definitely see tons of play.
---
**HERE IT COOOMES!**
---
One has taunt, one has 1 more attack. I'd say the 8 health moreorless balances out with the divine shield 
---
IGotBaited
---
"GET DOWN!"
---
"NO! *YOU* GET DOWN!"
---
Snapjaw Shellfighter: "Bruh..."
---
Because he used Twinspell on the explanation.
---
He is very good at disguises
---
Another big reason they nerfed is was because it severely limited Druid deckbuilding. Any sort of Druid deck at the time that wasn't Malygos just added FoN + Savage Roar combo to their deck as a win con. 
---
Not as of recently in wow lore at least
---
This card is basically a shitty barnes right? 1 mana more and in total 1 hp less. 
---
From the above list, you'd replace a Highmane. 
---
Highmane and Stranglethorn Tiger would be the first 3 to be replaced by better cards.
---
It was hit or miss for me. Some were awesome. Some were less so. Some were just... Really weird. 
---
[[Frost Shock]], [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Totemic Smash]] can go face and cost 1 mana. 
---
There's already a meme-tier deck with reducing the cost of [[Electra Stormsurge]] through [[Fire Plume Harbinger]] and summoning two malygoses. This 4/4 card can add consistency or revise the deck all-together.
---
Well sure, but you dont include them to fight aggro. You include them to counter combos which a battlecry is much better at doing.
---
I'll give you that deathlord is better against aggro but that's not the point of the card
---
Are you implying people know how to play around paladin secrets?
---
Seems like this should have been released last expansion... Like a heckler in the crowd? What does heckling have to do with this expansion?
---
But wild
---
That's a bold statement.

---
What Card did druid have to keep in the mulligan even over wild growth against rogue before the nerfs?
---
Yeah the problem with that is, that most Gaming companies don't give a shit.
---
You don't buy the newesr FiFa , there will atleast 1 person out there , who makes up for you by buying 350 Euro worth of microtransactions.  EA is far worse, but every company is like that these days, because they found out we gamers are easily bought with just a little effort and a good moneygrab for them. There are so few of publishers and devs, who really care about their game and they need a lot of love from us. For blizz I can only say, I have seen a post today,where someone complained the app is not working properly,despite him spending 200$ alone this month and was angry too. You see,that a lot of people just dont care anymore :/ This is nearly all I have to say for that. Complaining on reddit won't do much tbh 
---
This card looks like something you definitely want to discover. It should also be insane in arena.
---
I would think that it only puts one in your hand, since it reads to return it to your hand, not add a copy to your hand. Don't know for sure though.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs strictly worse but yeah I see your reasoning. With this card at least the important minion will be a 4/4 instead of a pingable 1/1
---
[baleful banker]
---
Such a good card
---
I'm sure it will be consistent enough to demolish people during the first week of the expansion since the classic paladin aggro package is so good, but whether it will be tier 1 after rotation will mostly depend on whether a new OP deck rises from this expansion. Since the rotation is not only hitting secret paladin but also almost every other deck pretty hard there could be some surprises for us in store.
---
KushGobbla #1877 on NA trading quest. You go first.
---
Next to a flametongue totem.
---
Only if another minion dies, if she triggers the redemption then only one is summoned since her effect isn't active when she's not on the field.
---
Warlock is a tempo and card advantage centric class, the trade off of health for power is worth it if done correctly and backfires if done incorrectly. It‚Äôs actually really cool and my second favourite class after rogue.
---
Floop + starfire is basically a 2 card pyroblast though. Nothing to write home about.
---
[[baleful banker]]
---
1 noteworthy is a different minion.
---
You can play 2 or reshuffle more and still work.
---
I wish they have this on review stream and get people excited. It was not new but cool nonetheless
---
It wants revenge for all the mammoths that sat in it.
---
Baast hunter and secret (or is it spell?) hunter are OK, while mech hunter is wuite good. Only mech hunter does not run Rexxar. If Rexxar is your main love of hunter, he is going to keep getting worse, as drawing a midrange card every turn is eventually not going to be strong enough against the sheer amount of tempo wild decks can produce with ten mana after a while.
---
Yeah its either Sorc - &gt; Freeze two or deal two damage for two card s
---
Note that this isn't just 1 mana. It is 1 mana + class. Class cards being better than neutral counterparts isn't a new thing.
---
Yeah, Millhouse has been switching sides pretty much every other expansion. He only cares about himself and his well-being.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs way better. 8 heal the turn it‚Äôs played and a larger body in exchange for taunt and divine shield.
---
If no, Lay on Hands.
---
I really enjoyed the premise/story/art of Good Hunting, but I agree, the fact that like 80% of the frames have tits in them was a little bit much. 
---
(Though I will say, I think part of that, albeit poorly communicated, was "these specific characters aren't *human*, so they don't really give a shit about *human* ideals of cultural decency")
---
Been playing since Beta, just got past rank 11 for the first time last month.  now i'm stuck at rank 6

I haven't seen super strong stuff other than mage card pool that looks super solid with new cards after rotation and  warrior looks pretty fun (not sure how strong)
---
With conscripter you are paying 1 health to get a lackey - lackeys are all quite strong, it's definitely better than passing T2
---
I just picked all the cards that summon minions for your opponent and then added whirlwind/warpath to remove them.  Then I hit autocomplete lol.  It‚Äôs not a great deck unless you happen to get matched against a rez priest (but it‚Äôs totally worth it)
---
I also threw Griftah in cuz I opened him last week and it was already a meme deck
---
Five, but the battlecry makes up for it. 
---
Trading against taunt doesn't count lol
---
I mean right now it has synergy with 3 total secrets in standard. I dont think they have ever released more than 2 paladin secret per expansion but who knows really?
---
Guys they're talking about machine learning. The technology is here‚Ñ¢
---
You can summon the ancient one if you shadowstep it
---
Thank you for reminding me this exists. :)
---
I would agree if it stated that it adds a copy to your hand, but it states that it returns it to your hand. Once it is returned the first time, there is no remaining card to return to your hand. Just a theory though
---

I really like Peter, despite the fact he seems shy I think he really stood up and makes me excited about the game. 
---
Ah, ok. I was confused because I don't recall most gallery priest decks running Thalnos. 
---
The one that horribly corrupts your wishes something like half the time, yes.
---
The *only* reason I sort of agree with you is that the theme of this expansion is bringing back mechanics from other expansions. 
---
Otherwise, Team 5 has been pretty clear that Recruit was only a named mechanic for that one expansion because it played off of the expansion‚Äôs theme of questing adventurers. Every card that has used this mechanic before then and every one after has had it worded rather than using the ‚ÄúRecruit‚Äù tag. 
---
While I do get what you are saying, I don‚Äôt have a problem with they way they do this. Like I said though, it would make sense to have the one set that borrows mechanics from older sets to include the retired keyword.

Why not? I play Animal Companion. When I play a spell, what happens is the spell is cast. Then the spell does something, which for animal companion is it summons a minion. Playing a minion isn't like this though. There's no intermediary step. In the Animal Companion case, there's three, and two verbs. I play Animal Companion. Animal Companion summons Leok, versues. I summon Sorcerer's Apprentice. There's no third thing. Sorceror's Apprentice does not summon Sorcerer's Apprentice.  
---
And what is a token then? The minimised view of a card on the hearthstone table? Because that's just UI cleanup
---
Each of the four non-villain classes.  Four Twinspell cards, five Schemes.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty swank combo. Not only is this now zero mana, but you get a spell from playing elemental invocation. Good catch!
---

Priests have been the bane of my existence this expansion. 
---
You have to play the spells first.
---
your mother was an annoyotron.
---
You don't have to pay anything to access the deck with the best winrate.
---
There's probably a hundred thousands F2P playing that deck.
---
Well, shudderwock used to run 15. Holy wrath paladin used to run 12 as well. Mechathun warlock runs 21. mechathun priest runs 16, though to be fair 6 of those are combo pieces.
---
The only combo decks low on minions on the current meta are Mally rogue, priests, and druids. Mally rogue kills you if you play this on curve without a way to deal with Maligos, and already has Maligos in hand by the time you do. Both dirty rat and Hecklebot are useless against priests unless you are a mage or a shaman, but by the point you can play it + hex/polymorph, they might have already cheated out and killed a token. Druids would just have a high chance of being screwed up by Hecklebot, but they also telegraph their combo very conveniently for dirty rat.
---
All of those were at least tier 2 at points, except maybe mechathun priest (I honestly cant remember much about it, other than how it showed up, then disappeared)
---
Pulling cleric, knomes and librarians with this is not nearly as good as you believe. They dont get the draw, but they get the deck thinning, which is honestly even better for cards like this: Instead of having to spend 2 mana on a draw reroll, they just draw whatever they would get from it.
---
And this might be a good card on its own, but really, everyone else in here was freaking out about how dirty rat is back and combo decks are dead, when frankly... this does not hold a candle to dirty rat in terms of combo disruption. This is barely any better than gnomeferatu in terms of combo disruption.
---
Yes it is similar, but it's not the same. This is that card split in half. It counts as 2 triggers for anything that cares about playing spells and it can give up the damage half to freeze two things. Or one thing twice.
---
It's good design.
---
He was a Mage Order Hall follower in Legion.
---
And a lot of aoe if you want. Heal is the only thing it desperately needs for wild w/o FL Jaina
---
1 mana is def worth lifesteal and rush but you also gotta take into account that this is a class card and not neutral 
---
I hope the twin spell has the ray coming from the other hand but with otherwise the same art lol
---
Which is bad, since noone plays holy smite/etc
---
Did... Did you just thank God that someone is doing their job? Is the pro-Blizzard circlejerk that strong that we need to be thanking them for doing one of the most menial tasks for their jobs? I wish people jerked me off for doing my job like that

That was pretty much my first thought. "What gets destroyed before the box?"  But  I guess he's better with a hammer than I gave him credit for.

---
In big, high cost cards there's usually a checklist to go through.
---
Eg, does it provide immediate value? Does it help stabilize you? Does it win the game on its own if allowed to live? 
---
If you look at the big late game cards that saw wide play, they fit those types of effect. Dr. Boom gave big immediate value and was tough to clear. Lich king had taunt (some stabilization), immediate value, and if left alone snowballed quickly.
---
This card has immediate value, and helps stabilize you against aggressive or midrange decks by likely killing 2 minions and healing for 8-12 health. That's a *big* swing. But it doesn't have the long term value, or likely win on its own vs non hyper-aggressive decks. I think it's costed right around the amount it needs to be to see decent play - depends on the meta and if a control shaman is in place, with the tools to slow down the more aggressive decks long enough for this to rush out.
---
On mage? With sorcerer and flamewaker? No plz
---
I'd guess having more than 1 of her on board wouldn't change anything. The text says that the secrets trigger twice. Not one more time. Not double. Just twice. 
---
I don't, the deck I'm talking about lasts for a while, even when they don't draw DK. Kinda like a midrange deck or something.
---

How is this a Common?

Good point but details become invisible unless you are playing on a huge monitor.

This works via mobile app as well, correct?
---
Is it random?
---
when they first brought in rotations, sending our collections to wild, they introduced an expansion that was not only meta defining but powerful and fun. this new expansion, whispers of the old gods it is not. this is an underwhelming expansion in that they are replacing our collections (in standard) with cards that are underwhelming. 
---
It's so frustrating how they introduce new mechanics but only release a handful of cards with them. I guess that's to be expected with only 10(?) cards per class.
---
Hey Artorias2728, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
I'm still baffled that people get upset at their opponent using emotes.
---
It says "your secrets trigger twice." Not "your secret activations are doubled."
---
Yes this. I Think this is the main thing that annoys me as well it's reading stats not text :D
---
I‚Äôm hopeful
---
Doubtful. Without ice block, you have to devote too much to developing board in the mid game, or you'll just die. It's also unlikely that you'll be so far ahead that you can land Alex safely. And without Alex, and ice Lance being hall of famed, you won't have enough burn to get there. Burn mage is dead.
---
I think it was bad editing. They probably recorded him discussing things a few different ways to see what worked best. In the end they stitched those takes together and it kinda didn‚Äôt work. 
---
You are thinking of C'thun, Marin the fox was just given out.
---
"A single normal copy of Marin the Fox is automatically given to the player the first time they log into *Hearthstone* after November 6th, 2017 or open a Kobold &amp; Catacombs pack."
---
"A single non-golden copy of C'Thun is given to each player when opening their first [Whispers of the Old Gods](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Whispers_of_the_Old_Gods) card pack. Regular C'Thun is [uncraftable](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Uncraftable) and cannot be crafted or disenchanted."
---
If Rhyssa dies with Redemption up the secret triggers once like normal because Rhyssa's effect is only active while Ryssa is alive. 
---
Shit, it's good enough for constructed under the right circumstances too
---
Too bad CTA and Tarim are rotating and DF is bye bye. Secret Paladin is the only deck I play now
---
I believe Brann Bronzebeard had the exact same text and multiple copies didn't double multiple times, so I'd go with that.
---
Only twice, like Brann.
---
It used to be 0/3
---
It's not bad lol, it can freeze, counts as 2 spells casts, it's not even close to holy smite so you can compare both wth
---
Eh but when you're getting to this high of mana it's not just 1 extra mana. It's limiting what else you can do with your remaining mana
---
I checked your method using a very simplified version of the problem. It did not give the correct answer. Can you spot my error or explain your reasoning? I'm pretty interested in the problem after that. Here's what I was testing:
---
&gt;The hearthstone wiki tells me that there are 508 spells in wild. He cast 20 spells that game, so the probability of getting Mindgames, Myra, and Cataclysm in any order would already be 1/(508C3) * 20C3 = 1/19053.
---
Here's my test: Imagine only 3 harmless spells exist (labeled A, B, and C), Toast casts 3 spells, then plays Yogg. What are the odds of getting spell A followed by spell B. If you write them out, it turns out the odds are 7/27 (AAB, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACB, BAB, CAB). Using the approach you list but with the numbers in the test case, the odds of Yogg casting spell A and B in any order is 1/(3C2) * 3C2 = 1. That's not correct but would work if Yogg didn't cast duplicates. Can you spot the error in my test or explain the reasoning behind your calculation?

The one thing that always scares me about midrange metas is I fear it will be like Shamanstone or Dragon Priest again where control decks can‚Äôt compete and aggressive decks can still lose the early game.
---
Your comment is well thought out and shouldn't be downvoted, unfortunately even though most of the people on this sub don't even play Wild there is still an irrational hatred of Big Priest.
---
Tempo would be the last deck to play this, wouldn't it? Tempo means mana efficiency and board control, neither of which this provides. Elemental Invocation might make an exception, but that looks hard to justify after the strong Un'goro elementals rotate out.
---
Definitely a strong value engine, no argument there.
---
Businesses sell things. They have people explain the things they sell. Do you have any more knowledge bombs to drop?

CONSPIRACY CONSPIRACY CONSPIRACY

Good in wild, pretty terrible in standard atm.
---
As a mainly wild player, hoooooooo boy, this is going to be freaking annoying.
---
That's not even a good example. Choosing whether to take down a 2/2 with a 2/3 against a class with a ping happens much more often and requires much more decision making.
---
Can [Messenger Raven](https://imgur.com/LRFT9BB) discover a copy of itself?

Basically they tried to rush their opponents'  health points, and if by tour 7/8 they were behind they just conced to save time. (They also have an owl in the deck).

Could be a spell based on him instead of being a minion.
---
Hunter Mid range? How many Odd mage did they face? Everytime I face it, it feels like I just get completely bullied out by that busted hero power.
---
I've been pretty disappointed with the twinspells mostly because it's taken so long for the devs to revisit old mechanics and I love playing for value. Glad they're exploring the keyword more since most of my favourite classes are defenders. 
---
^^^^^#croppedoutofthescreenshot:(
---
There is the 2 mana 1/1 rat, that gives you a random lackey with it's battlecry.
---
Well then WoW got it wrong too.
---
Memes i think
---
The math: 5*2=10*2=20*2=40*2=80dmg for 9 mana
---
I think I saw a half blink or two around 2:40, but that really is uncanny and borderline unsettling.
---
Shuddermuck Shaman anyone?
---
EVIL Cable Rat is the only one so far, I think. There could end up being more.
---
EVERYTHING TWICE
---
I love you Peter. Your cute smile always melts my heart. 
---
Yeah. Probably because it was so reliant on Avenge to work well. Plus they introduced more secret hate cards. 
---
I like how they treat street magic in WoW. He says he makes things disappear, but his secret is that he uses portals.
---
Like, regular magic is so humdrum that he has to pretend he isn't using it when *performing magic tricks*.
---
Now we just need a dueling disk!
---
Yeah I think the key here is what you said, a COPY. Even if you only get one draw out of it, theres no real downside. You still keep the draw, and odds are you at least dealt damage to an enemy. Now you have a must deal with minion to occupy your oppenents turn.
---
Nerfing it is just sticking a bandaid on a flesh wound IMO. The problem isn't the card, it's that it's around forever. Rotating evergreen set is the real solution. 
---
This is somehow worse than deathlord.
---
Good to see a nightborn there
---
I think even against combo this will be pretty bad seeing as you are mostly just playing it for the battlecry and it costs twice as much as dirty rat and has a significantly worse battlecry. And the fact that it's awful vs mid-range and aggro make it a tech card that isn't even great in the best case and is sub par in the average/bad cases.
---
Just my opinion though, maybe I'll be wrong.
---
Remove jaina, wild rexxar, classic guldan.  
---
Tbf, I think most are going to have some strong inherent bias due to playing certain classes more than others.  I play warlock a lot, so I'm obviously incentivized to want guldan around more than jaina or rexxar, even if all of them were pretty despicable cards in standard.  
---
Jaina is the worst offended I'm though because she draws the game out so much and can be slapped in around deck with pretty much no deck building and still be strong.  Rexxar annoys me more due to being an infinite value engine.  If they removed all heal options from beasts he gets, for example, he would be more palatable.  Getting heals and things is a problem similar to why the control warlocks had a bunch of there things like pact nerfed....they were doing something outside their class identity too well.  Guldan is a problem as well, but at least he costs 10 mana, requires demons to both be played and in your deck building, and while powerful, doesn't do THAT much after the initial battle cry.  
---
Wild is probably the best location for all 3 though.  
---
Don't remember that exactly, but in general it doesn't bother me at all when people misjudge power for cards.  It's really hard to do and I've been wrong a lot of times before playing.  Cloning Gallery in particular is tough because that deck is new and hard to just build in your head on the spot.  I actually have a lot of fun watching people review cards, so I'd way rather they were negative on some things and wrong (or right!) rather than just never engaged at all.  On the other hand, when people give cards negative reviews and then also are really nasty to the design team/engineering team/art team/etc, that bothers me, but it's more the second half than the first.
---
Not sure what the original comment was but the only hunter deck that doesn't run rexxar odd hunter and its because they cant. They would if they could.

---
Yeah I feel you, but rogues donot have the heals or board clears to do anything more than meme with a deck like that. Big Priest is just better in most ways, so naturally Barnes is associated almost strictly with Big Priest.
---
You are correct
---
Don't remember all the cards that i opened but got Pyros, my other favorite legendary from the free packs awarded this week.
---
I hardly ever encounter this issue. Strange. 
---
Or 8 mana with Topsy Turvy 
---
):
---
When you multiply two negative things you get a positive.
---
Couldn't you throw in Moorabi + a handful of freeze cards and see what else it spits out?
---
So is playing a different meme deck every game against like 9 or 10 decks that make up over 50% of the higher level ladder that much less repetitive? If you're not interested in mastering a single/couple decks HS really doesn't have much to offer outside of brawls and challenge a friend. Both casual and Rank 20 feature their fair share of top tier decks or maybe budget versions thereof.
---
Yeah, but you could easily play around most of those, and the 2 card boardwipe scenario is very unlikely. 
---
Like if you Myra‚Äôs and know they have a boardwipe... don‚Äôt play your finisher yet. Rogue has other ways of winning 
---
Hopefully it's a hero card.
---
Maybe they'll do a neutral hero card.....
---
While the effect seems weak, twinspell is very powerful here I think. Being able to freeze something for two turns with one card is pretty nice. Double cheap spells for gadgetzan auctioneer, antonidas etc both of which also benefit from freezing to protect them. I‚Äôd be very surprised if this didn‚Äôt see *some* play in standard.
---
Hey, HEY!
---
The defenders of Dalaran are masters of magic, not all hunters. I've known a few insane gits who built for arcane shot in my day.
---
Both characters are stealth archer. 
---
The difference is how you intended the character to be played.
---
You‚Äôre a great ambassador. Keep it up.
---
It is only as close to Holy Smite as Frostbolt is to Dark Bomb. it doesn't unfreeze minions it deals two damage to.
---
Um... deal 4 dmg twice to up to 2 minions on the turn it comes out AND heal you is not useful enough for you?
---
Hey just so you know your card reveal was fun and hilarious and I totally laughed out loud with you when you realized that there was a puzzle box inside of the other boxes. Good stuff. Keep up the good work!
---
Fwiw it got nerfed like half a year ago. It wasnt a recent thing that caused people to think its too strong
---
The 0 mana in the choice "discover" popup only signifies you're not paying additional mana over the mana for the card you already played
---
...ok? You seem really defensive about this whole thing for one reason or another.
---

Even this is bullshit, it only took me roughly 2months to have 3/4 competitive decks from a fresh ftp account. The recourses available today make it so much easier, and this deck builder is a God‚Äôs gift for ftpers

Toast the Barbarian
---
Sounds pretty good vs aggo/zoo match up though. Can stall a creature for two rounds and potentially eliminate it.
---
&gt;wild is just an afterthought
---
It is an iterative process. They started where they have the most data, and where the most people will benefit from their effort. Seems like a good choice to me. Wild will presumably benefit later from the lessons learned. (or wild may not get the feature. But either way, starting with standard has the benefits already listed so not doing it would just be limiting themselves in the process of making this new feature.)
---
There might be some that exist, just not enough for there to be playable ones, such as the undead paladin barthalomew(sp).

Seriously though, I talked to a dude who was *super* into WoW, and he said that in WoW *everything* is part of a magic/god/elemental hierarchy. Just like there's always a lich king, there's always a Special Fountains in Daralan King.
---
Idk something like that.
---
I mean yeah a card can't be better at everything and Als better for being a potential fireball or eight damage. But in a grinder style deck you're either running all three, or cutting Al first and not them, because these guys play the long game better.
---
The issue is less about the cropping as it is about there should just be more real estate given to the art and lest to the card border.

Twinspellception
---
You need to play Control early against Mage, oddly enough.
---
Dire Mole razor maw is always a go if you draw it, but if not I find that just conceding the early board and playing to remove his stuff works better than trying too desperately for an early hyena or an early Crackling adapt.
---
Weapons, Flanking strike, pings with Springpaw. Let him waste stuff early and Get yourself to turn 5/6 before you attempt to build a board. Drop a Highmane or combo a massive hyena and it‚Äôs a lot easier from there

is definitely not an actual definition lmao, it's just a pretty decent backronym 
---
Ah, there's the 'look what Stonehill gave me as a Paladin have you seen this before???' thread I haven't seen in a while, 3 days or so. Waiting for the 'Thanks tracking...' post that shows tracking and 3 legendaries as a choice
---
Muh time to shine. (Software engineer who fucks around with ML in their free time.)
---
If I'm reading their article right, it doesn't look like their AI actually understands the game. The deck building process is three steps: first you put in what cards you want, the AI trys to netdeck for you based on what your rank is doing, and if it comes up short it'll look up individual card WRs and just dump in a pile of good stuff/popular tech cards until you hit 30. At no point does the AI try to understand the cards directly or tries to build an actual gameplan besides trying to math out the Jedi Curve. Hence why it needs handcrafted rules to not do wonky stuff like put keleseeth in a deck with swamp ooze. This works because standard allows for piles of good stuff to do ok up to a certain point and the list of nonsensical deckbuilding choices is fairly small.
---
Wild is kind of the opposite. It's a format that is predicated on broken synergies instead of staying above the Jedi Curve and the number of handrolled deckbuilding rules increases exponentially with every expansion since new cards need to be checked against every card that's ever existed for logical deck building guidelines. For Wild you would probably need to build a beefier AI that is capable of learning about the cards and understanding why, for example, Naga/Giants were good cards when they were together but kinda shitty as standalones or why a 3 drop doesn't work with Genn.
---
&gt; I'd way rather they were negative on some things and wrong (or right!) rather than just never engaged at all
---
This is such a great point, and I think it applies to this sub a whole lot too. We can be quite negative about HS, but it's because we care. Well mostly, some people are assholes - myself included
---
I hope they boost my handbuff warlock then
---
That divine mechostrider is glorious, and absolutely should be a mount of some kind.
---
Dirty Rat has a net neutral card advantage. This draws them a creature and plays it for them. 
---
If you‚Äôre playing Wild, you could use the weapon to summon this and then Sense Demons on the same turn. It could be as early as turn 5 if you coin out the weapon on 4. 
---
Shadow word pain Gunna be op this upcoming meta 
---
Zul'jin, Malacrass, and Jek'lik were either in new or old Zul'Gurub. Every loa is from WoW. None are Hearthstone lore only.
---
Is this a reference to last boss from Rogue Legacy?
---
This. I hate the current meta. It's way too repeative and boring
---
Itll be so unreliable though unless you don't run any other minions and will also be super draw dependent. I don't think this will be how it sees play unless there's some combo that makes it more reliable.
---
Casino Mage is back!
---
How did you find out about the coin back I have been waiting for a while and checking regularly but not seeing it?
---
Thanks
---
Gave you sympathy upvote for not getting as much attention as the other dude.
---
Also, doesn't die to BGH. 
---
Android user here.  
---
I have not been able to play a single game of arena.  
---
*I exclusively play arena.*
---
Nah. All of the Loa were already invented. 
---
Man imagine if there was a conditional card like Genn that made your minions not use their battlecries 
---
I mean, how is that card any difference of Shadow Essence? Besides the fact Shadow Essence is a 5/5
---
that sucks.. I'm not a fan of Paladin's boards that are hard to clear.
---
same
---
I mean, obviously it's made of rocks, I was focusing more on it's shape and form.
---
Tbh this makes Al' Akir seem really weak. I know it has some good effects on it, but they aren't that great unless you have rock biter and/ or flame tongue totem. That takes too many extra cards to be useful. It needs to have either more attack or health or less Mana cost at this point. A very unimpactful card. 
---
&gt; I'd like the highest win rate for a deck containing that card
---
That's what it gives you. What I think you're trying to say is that you want the highest win rate deck *featuring* that card, but that's an insanely more complicated tool to build. Each card, and combination of cards, would have to have it's major synergies mapped, and sometimes they may simply not exist.
---
If you want to build off-meta decks, people put out decklists for them, but frankly it's hard to understand why someone would both want to be playing creative, off-meta decks and *also* want to have the deckbuilding process automated. Seems like the whole point of specifically seeking out something different would be getting creative in the process, otherwise what's the point? It's never going to be great decks, those will already be known, and if they weren't they wouldn't be getting pumped out by an automated process reliant on existing data.
---
Does this work with yogg?
---
Lol, I don't think he knows what a flesh wound is.
---
If people are actually critical of him, that's just ridiculous. Yeah he's shy, but he's cute!!! And he loves the game! On another note, I think it's nice that he has stayed as our face of hearthstone, he was here when Ben was here, so if nothing else when I see him I feel a piece of Ben is still here with us too :D
---
He will find you, and he will break your precious box.
---
&gt; If Maly becomes a serious problem
---
Then the problem isn't Malygos, it's the cards that let you cheat out an effect that was on a 9-drop for a reason.
---
Haven't played in ages and I don't know the 50-20 meta, but I'm guessing it consists of 90+% entirely free wins, so you should be able to easily ride the win streak through those ranks within 4 or 5 hours. 
---
Should be the 4th
---
It's people in glass houses throwing stones when they criticize his behavior on streams for the most part.  
---
People behind monitors on keyboards who would be far worse in the same situation no doubt.  
---
For those wondering what my hand was, it was a automade deck
---
I know we're joking back and forth, but on a serious note with Hearthstone and color, why don't rush minions highlight in a different color like yellow or blue to indicate the minion can't go face?
---
Might want to specify that this is the tavern brawl
---
Ok I get it. I own a regular Baku, no Genn. I'm going to craft a golden Genn to get 3200 + 1600 for both of them. Since I don't play wild, I'll disenchant both for 400 + 1600. 
---
Perfect, honestly how dumb was it that they were trying to make streamers do this thing for 20 minutes on their stream with people waiting for a reveal 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how powerful that fountain would be, given how it survived Dalaran‚Äôs destruction and doomed a lot of people who threw coins into it wishing for good lucks.
---
Actually you‚Äôre right, I completely forgot about that.
---
Takes two to tango.
---
it's also a class card and they are usually stronger than neutral + the card was rarely played so some buff to make it relevant is appreciated
---
17 damage? Seems like a crappy combo for wild.
---
The 2 new keywords synergise with the original keyword. That's a lot of added calue for 1 mana
---
Have a link? 
---
I played a deck similar to this early RR meta and i really liked it. It wasnt really strong but felt pretty different to other aggro decks. It had insane burst potential and oyu had to organice the turns very carefully because of wanting to be overloaded but also the overload fucking up the curve.
---
I also ran Kragwa as the top of the curve (probably not optimal) and it just complicated things even more, making me decide to go all in then get back those burn spells, or playing it more carefull. Also, since many spells had overload, having enough mana next turn to kragwa was complicated.
---
I really hpe there is a bit of support for it this expansion, I would love to play this more when laddering, not only on casual.
---
&gt;nice and ultimately useless battlecry.
---
So it'll be an epic then.
---
I swear these are the choices i get like 90% of the time ,whenever i play stonehill on paladin.
---
Wild doesnt have the feature...
---
‚ÄúPut this piece of paper over your head whilst I take a photo for le reddit‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhy, what does it say?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúJust smile for the photo‚Äù
---
It's not bullshit, your anecdote doesn't invalidate my argument.
---
You point out doomguard but not the kobolds weapon, ok.
---
I ran Keleseth in a few big spell mage variants where it wasnt
---
16 hours of dedication is not a lot. The hard part is the skill required.
---
You have Ryhssa and Malygos out and your opponent pyroblasts your face = 30 damage. 
---
I don't think it's still active...this post is like 14 minutes old!
---
I went on and bought 40 classic packs for 5400 coins, I don't think I got any % discounted
---
Like a Blightnozzle Crawler
---
Maybe this one says FLASHKICK, I'd be down with that
---
Wow
---
I'm a simple man. I see "for each spell you've cast this turn" cards, I upvote.
---
Looking forward to some clips of streamers prepping the coin again.
---
Aggressive Burn mage hasn't been relevant since KnC. It largely relied on the secret package, which left at the start of year of the raven (Cabal Lackey and Crystal Runner). It would then get there at the end with frostbolt, fireball, and occasionally cinderstorm. Now it's losing Aluneth and Explosive Runes, in addition to Mana Wyrm having been nerfed. It's dead.
---
&gt;Pick a card, any card...
---
&gt;Wow, a golden Dr. Boom!
---
&gt;Hey! Not that card! Give it back!
---
They do have a different outline instead of color, and also make a different noise when played than charge minions do when they are played (and its actually really audible, its like a NNNNNGGYEEEEEEEEEH sound).
---
Also, when you click on them to attack, only the minions glow green (since they are the only avaiable targets) while other minions will have the enemy portrait also glowing green.
---
How long has it been since she was introduced?
---
Hard disagree. Most playable 2 drops are 2/3s, meaning trading into it is possible if they dont remove your minion. Even if they do, a 1/2 Mana Wyrm would have died to Odd Rogue and Mage hero powers, Backstab, two Candleshots instead of three, etc.
---
1/3 Mana Wyrm was oppressive because you typically couldn‚Äôt play a minion that actually traded into it until T3, when other board control options and problematic cards came into play (Counterspell, Explosive Runes mostly) so it snowballed out of control easily. Making it a 1/2 would have meant it dies much earlier and prevents it from surviving long enough to accumulate 3+ buffs.
---
Bwonsamdi (wotlk), Gonk (cata), and even Hir'eek (shadows of the horde/mop) existed before BFA.
---
Krag'wa and Gral were the only new loa from BFA in RR.
---
Skynet is taking over
---
Probably don't need to feed the ego with headlines like this...
---
It also gets double damage from spell damage, essentially.
---
Almost a year
---
The only thing I understood about that card was GRUUL, GOLDEN GOD OF THIS WORLD
---
So nerfed ice Lance 
---
If you have a Apprentice in play and Frostbolt the enemy face this is basicly Ice Lance.... SMOrc Mage coming back? :P 
---
That is correct.
---
I really don‚Äôt see how playing 10 standard games is so impossible you‚Äôd rather wait until they bring the feature to rotate in. Especially since you can‚Äôt get Lunara at all now. 
---
If you need the dust you need the dust. Cards in a match only give you value if you play them, and similarly cards in your collection that you don‚Äôt use effectively might as well not be there.
---
The longer you play Hearthstone though, the more appealing Wild will look. Your collection will increase over time, and more and more of the strategies and individual cards you were fond of back in the day will egg you on to give the mode a shot.
---
If spending money on the game isn‚Äôt a realistic option, do what you need to do you can keep up with the release pace. As someone who doesn‚Äôt grind every day and also likes playing with older cards, I shell out two to three times a year on Pre-Orders, but if you can enjoy the game just as much for free, by all means rip that bandage off and dust your rotating cards.
---
Geez
---
&gt;I think
---
Definitely confirmed for all 4 classes!
---
Game designer for this are so unoriginal. This set is just let's make everything happen twice. No wonder revenue is down.
---
this will be an insane arena card. book it
---
xD
---
Sniping powerful Battlecrys is still worth it, though. Not that anyone plays Giggling Inventor anymore, but grabbing that or Funglemancer is a really nice move in a deck that wants to play a longer game.
---
Why does it say rang¬ø
---
Sure, I guess, but freeze mage has always been a thing, long before emperor, going back to beta.
---
Emperor amplified the power of these decks a lot for while in standard but even with emperor rotating, blizzard felt ice lance burst was too powerful and too restricting on design space, hence they rotated it too.
---
This is it. We found the effect
---
This seems really fucking good. In a lot of cases this is gonna heal you for 8, significantly diminish/clear the enemy board, and leave you with a 4/something windfury lifesteal on board. If you want you can wait to combo it with [[Earthen Might]] on 10 for a fuckin 6/10 windfury lifesteal rush that also gives you an extra random elemental.
---
Some people are too stubborn you can't persuade to do the easy way.
---
I assume it also have the effect if your draw a card during your opponent turn so it still reads well
---
the sweet voice of a full time smoker  \^\^
---
It's so fake. We all know the 'summon a random 2 drop' Lackey will only ever give you doomsayer.
---
I have seen an asmr video of a person eating taco bell tacos with over 30,000 likes. You would be surprised what people want to listen to ;)  
---
Don't self select yourself out of anything if it's something you might enjoy. Give it a shot anyway, although i'm a bit biased in this case to recommend that.

My most successful version runs oondasta, charging devilsaur, witchwood grizzly and the spellstone, along with eureka/ancestral spirit of course.
---
Except that if you run more copies, it has a chance of pulling itself.
---
This is good to know! I've lucked out for once. Tips for which packs I'll need to buy? I'm expecting to have to pay $50-100 to get back into it.
---
Rexxar is entirely about tempo compared to this in control shaman
---
Or they're just playing a cruel prank regarding how Twinspells cast twice... /s
---
Hey, don‚Äôt forget the class discount.
---
I get that, playing the same deck over and over sure can get boring eventually. On the other hand I see that as opportunity to learn the deck and therefore don‚Äôt lose interest into it that quickly.
---
For climbing playing only one meta deck certainly seems like the best choice though. I never hit rank 5 before ( not playing much anyways ), crafted Baku, build a wild Budget Odd Pala without some of the important Epics and Rares and Leeroy, and got rank 5 in a few hours without ever having any thoughts other than "this deck is disgusting to face" prior to that day regarding Odd Pala. Meta decks are just that strong.
---
"A reprint means it is identical, or very SIMILAR."
---
So we just mtg with storm now? This is a really really good card
---
I'm crafting my stuff on April 1, just in case.
---
&gt;rare
---
seems about right
---
With the new specialist format you only bring 1 deck to tourneys, plus your sidedecks which are at most 5 cards different. That means that competing at the highest level is doable with 1 deck now. Doing that f2p is totally reasonable though maybe not when the acct is brand new. Also, once youve played for a while you can maintain multiple complete decks without too much trouble.
---
Quest Mage RNG Fiesta.
---
We need the most intellectual people to figure out why
---
No.  Because even when Priest is Dumpster tier, fuck priest.
---
Good time to play Wild.
---
I dunno, jokes are usually funny.

Im going to use this with my Supercollider

This card reveal was a puzzling, yet smashing success
---
A reprint that costs different and does different things is NOT A REPRINT.
---
Odd mage is high tier 2. It's one or 2 good cards away from tier 1. I've taken the no secret version to high legend twice with an above 60% winrate. It can beat any other aggro deck on board and poly boar boddies voidlord decks. 
---
 
---
Peter Whalen is quickly becoming one of my favorite designers. He's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at one view you watch him on the stream and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a spoiler to think about later in the day. And you also get this adorable little Cora that can laugh at things but usually is too nice to be removed.
---
But more than the PW is just so positive. He comes on the board like "do you want to see a card?" and I'm like "yeah PW i do want to see a card let's do this shit" and when he reveals he's like "This is a new card" and I'm like "yeah it IS a new card." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "This card will destroy you" he's just like "nah this is a new card." And he looks so happy. I mean this is a living being looking like he was literally brought to life by magic. He understands his life is a temporary biological gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. I mean look at his face he's just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when Peter Whalen is on stream. IDK if he's gonna make it into the future streams or not but for now he is a pretty chill dude.
---
You walked into a stable with a horse then came out with a better horse. Yes you can say it's a different horse but they're both the same
---
Will it trigger Bolvar, Fireblood?
---
Sorry but literally what would the point of Arena be if you could match against constructed decks?
---
Does anyone think saying shit like this absolves then from not noticing obvious jokes that have been widespread across communities for literal years?
---
like a girl like her would need &lt;3 mana to pull this through...
---
It's definitely not worth the effort but thanks for taking a look.
---
List? I'm playing yogg hunter and having a blast so I feel like me and casino mage would get along.
---
I'm excited to see what second dinner comes up with.
---
Ah, I forgot poly boar was a thing. I may be wrong then, my main reason for thinking odd mage was bad was that giving up poly vs bloodreaver guldan and big priest would be bad.
---
That runs both ways Liv. I've been in games dev since the 8-bit days and this is the most fun I've had. 
---
Will it trigger \[\[Bolvar, Fireblood\]\]?
---
both of them can low diff the current de facto Guardian

That‚Äôs right of course, maybe you can‚Äôt call it countered. But it takes away a lot of its power, so let me call it easy to play around.

keep your garbage game, this is the last expansion I spend money on this game.

Why did you say that?! Now I had to watch it looking for a blink. My eyes started to get dry watching him talk!! WTH

---
Well, as with most anything else, it‚Äôs a mix of skill, luck, and time commitment.  There are millions of HS players, and *average* player is probably not skilled enough to make it to legend regardless of time commitment, but I do believe that the average player who makes it past rank ~15 / 10 could make legend with a large enough time commitment 
---
I guess they're thinking in some kind of hearthstone perspective? IDK. But the guy above me was talking about math classes...oh well
---
If you paid close attention to the story you'd realise that she wasn't raped at all. She told that story so that guy would get off her back because she knew that would satisfy the guy and would stop him from asking further questions. The real reason it's called sonnie's edge is because the edge is that sonnie is actually the monster, not the girl. That's why she didn't die when her skull got crushed. When the fight starts you actually see her turn off the affinity link instead of turning it on.

How has the game been overall since around the time of brode's departure? Wasn't a fan of the game anymore with him at the helm. Any changes for the better, or for the worse?
