Each of the games in a bo3 match could end in 10 turns.
---

---
&gt; why would rewards scale? 
---
Because you're playing essentially 2-3 games instead of 1. 
---
Do you really took the hypothetical "bo3" change in vacuum an only exert the increased number of games from it? It doesn't helps the argument nor works like that on practice.

---
Stags are known to be part of druid. You have to think about the themes of the classes. Beasts are druid. Changing beasts are druid
---
 If genn and baku are only for 2 classes then they wouldnt be as good as they are. Those classes wouldnt even use them since you want to take them out of the classes they are. Its like restricting mechathun to rogue. Or hakkar to druid or cthun to mage. They are neutral legendaries for a reason. I like the idea of nerfing them but i have no idea how you would do that besides changing the hero powers. 
---
The hero power changes that i would think of is
---
Pala odd: summon 1 2/2
---
Mage: odd: deal 2 damage randomly to your opponents board
---
Warrior: odd 3 armor
---
Rogues is fine
---
Warlock 1 mana tap is already a downside since the life drain. But its a problem because of the 4 4/4 demon that gets +3/+3 when below 15 hp. 
---
Odd hunter isnt that great
---
Lol look at all the wannabe police in this thread.  
---
Probably not the right place to post this due to sub rules and yes the account can get deleted if Blizzard catch on. There are plenty of places on the net facilitating player to player account sales though and looking at the share volume there is I'd say Blizzard aren't overly concerned about this practice enough to strictly police it.  
---
Team 5 has verified that they have taken ideas from /r/customhearthstone.
---
I'm not sure why you're giving Dinosize as an example. I climbed legend with even paladin this month with a 71-46 record and I can say that Dinosize is one of the best cards you can put in the high drop slot. You'll always have a dude around, and that means it's direct damage or great board control. Not to mention if you somehow manage to Dinosize a Corpsetaker/Harpy it's basically game over.
---
The reality is buffing interesting cards that are absolutely garbage because of stats/cost would do as much to shake up the meta as the 4-5 nerfs they do every few months. But they actively avoid that due to either lost profits or laziness.
---
It takes a LOT before you buff cards like Holomancer to Arena Patron to KFT/KNC power levels.
---
Literally awesome line
---
spaghetti dinner for a spaghetti coder
---
that feeling when you queue into a ranked game but then you have to leave and do something
---
This is why I keep saying it. It's great Iksar is finally engaging the community... but its soooo freaking too late. They should have been on the horn with us months ago. Hell, maybe a year ago.
---
It really feels like there are two camps in Blizz HQ right now trying to bring back hearthstone to its prime, but neither is talking to each other and so it just makes the other camp seem like they are doing something at the worst possible time.
---
I quit playing and caring for HS, stopped watching Amaz, Toast and Savjiz. 
---
But kept watching Kibler. Even though I dont like HS anymore, him playing it is still entertaining somehow. Maybe because he can play all those interesting brewed decks a normal low spender low time investing player like me cant afford. Also Shiro.
---
But Since MtGA hooked Savjiz and Amaz, I started to watch them again, and with Autochess I went back to watch all my former HS streamer (Amaz, Dog, Savjiz) again - well, all except for Toast :(
---
Blizzard corporate culture would've ruined osfrog should they get him. His condition was rumored to include the fact that he will be given free reign to design and balance the game with him as the ultimate authority, and would answer to no management. Blizzard couldn't have given him that, but valve could. 
---
In fact, considering their corporate culture, osfrog and blizzard was never destined to be. And I'm glad it was that way. 
---
It wasn't a blizzard run tournament, was it?
---
&gt; tournaments arent for casual players
---
... Yes they are. FNM is a tournament and casuals FUCKING LOVE FNM. 
---
Lol, the irony of MTG moving to Multi Deck and Bo1 formats while Hearthstone moves to weird sideboarding is hilarious....
---
I will take a look.
---
Found the alt Mike Donais account XD
---
no but seriously. you are defending blizz with outdated stats. Like seriously, where have you been for the last 6 months? Shit is going down, and it really doesn't look good for blizz (at the moment). Yes, they are trying to bring changes... but it really does feel like this change shouldn't really be the "priority". Now mind you this is just because champions is coming up, so no matter when they announced it, it would have this effect. But I think many people are frustrated because this game has been out for 5 years and very little has changed in terms of the core game. Tavern Brawl and Rotation. That's it. And yet we lost Adventures, so we are at a +1 for "new features"
---
Would you prefer sniping specific cards for a set amount of gold/$?
---
Or just play MTG arena and stop funneling money into blizzavision.
---
lol 20 packs.
---
Hey you won and wasted your whole week. Here's $30. 
---
I‚Äôm really not that well versed into other card games. This format seemed a little convoluted and everyone is talking about sideboards. Could someone explain it to me please?
---
RainbowJack#1345 NA 80g.  You go first please.
---
damn. i stand corrected...but that makes the point even more. 
---
Thank you for the kind offer. Maybe one day. These days, I think I am getting far enogh into the old man territory that I am OK just standing on the sidelines, remembering the sweetness of the past and watching those that made it over the hapiness line and the new folks doing it all over again.
---
&gt;  Stags are known to be part of druid. You have to think about the themes of the classes. Beasts are druid. Changing beasts are druid
---
You're right.  I edited my previous Stag suggestion.  
---
I'm not dead-set on any particular changes to the odd/even class cards.  The point is, there are only four of them, not 40.  They are not an obstacle to restricting Genn and Baku.
---
&gt; If genn and baku are only for 2 classes then they wouldnt be as good as they are. 
---
Yeah, that's the goal.
---
&gt; Those classes wouldnt even use them since you want to take them out of the classes they are.
---
I wouldn't put them in classes where they are totally useless, like Baku in Shaman.
---
&gt; They are neutral legendaries for a reason. 
---
That reason is "Blizzard made a mistake".
---
Ever since those money hungry assholes at activision joined Blizzard it all went wrong.
---
Sounds EXACTLY like a number of hs cards to me.  I mean i could toss them in but they are too techy to be useful outside of that one scenario.
---
And the crowd goes mild...
---
But yeah that's so much better than tournament mode, achievement system or any other thing people actually want /s
---
Like seriously you can't even give em credit for any effort or anything. It's lazy, minimum garbage what they produce here. They could've made a new mode with whatever rules and they choose this. 
---
How bout next mode is called Quality Format? Let's just take the idea of 50 cards. The amount of same cards is based on rarity.
---
1 Legendary, 2 Epics, 3 Rare, 4 normal.
---
Probably the same impact on the game (none) but hey...
---
laziest shit that useless team 5 did so far
---
Yeah, those jerks. They're why Wrath of the Lich King is one of the most hated expansions ever.
---
Oh wait.
---
Didn't get any gameplay, only got the replay from HDT
---
&gt; Once they merged and Activision's management had control (and the Blizzard founders left), the culture changed.
---
You don't understand much, then. That didn't happen. They merged in 2008. Started the merge before that. Think about this for a moment.
---
In 2008?

This is not true. If there are enough strategies out there and various forms of soft and hard tech, then a sideboard of 5 cards would not be able to counter all of them. Not only that, but a with enough tech and the ability to switch decks means someone can also play around the tech by having different win conditions. And heaven forbid instead of having a single super powerful win condition the tournaments actually reach a point of strategic play and trading and we see more tempo and attrition matches.
---
You don't even need QA to catch this sort of thing. Ugh...
---
I used to do this with northern lions binding of Isaac videos. I started back in 2014 but I don't really watch him anymore.

Wrath of lichh king

&gt; Way too many expansions

It's almost like you don't understand card games.
---
It was on this subreddit at one point, one of the dev's responding. I don't know if I'll be able to find it.
---
I was playing Odd Mage this weekend and got Grand Archivist from Astromancer. He pulled Dragon's Fury for 7 and wiped my whole board. I had 6 minions and my opponent had nothing at all.
---
Smashing, I say!
---
How does he have the same effect? Yogg casts random spells while zuljin recasts the actual spells youve cast. 
---
&gt; giving DotA ... away
---
That... isn't, you know, like, an accurate representation of what happened.
---
But I guess this is par for the course for for this thread.
---
Enemy has Moorabi, Snap Freeze becomes the worse card in this scenario. 
---
&gt;You are freaking brilliant to think of this and make it! Any plans to do more? You could probably sell some of these!
---
Hello my friend, how are you? I want to do videos tutorials teaching, but here in Brazil I have no resources! I do commission, I charge 35 $, but I have a limit because it is a craft work, and also because of my health that is pessima!
---
I charge this amount, so I can buy better materials and equipment to record my videos!
---
I really want to show my work to blizzard, it would be a dream to work for them.
---
I might suggest playing magic arena if that is your desire
---
It does make it more interesting because tournament discussion can better revolve around deck choices, and player stories. Magic is full of stories of players taking down tournaments with crazy decks that no-one saw coming. And player stories like "Kibler always plays big aggressive creatures" and "Stan Cifka is a master of combo". 
---
Plus is shows a real look at the meta, which the current format hides. If Hunter starts making up almost all of the winning decks in competitive, they have to react quicker. 
---
It is bad, it was tested and deemed a massive failure. 
---

"Alright boss! When do you want the sideboard implemented by?"
---
"Implemented? In the client? Are you mad?! That will eat in to our profit margins. Call up Battlefy and have them organize it! Their problem now hahaha"
---
even the rarity
---
OHHHHHHH! Damn nice callout 
---
It‚Äôs going to be such a pain in the ass sending all these screen shots, and how will your opponent know you are playing the right deck
---
I don't understand. On one hand you're talking about Blizzard needing to care because of 'more unhappy players'; on the other hand this shouldn't matter to us - the players that are supposedly unhappy?
---
Perhaps I was unclear; I was saying that Blizzard might be more wary of nerfing Baku/Genn because they are much more popular, and they know nerfing them means breaking a lot of peoples decks. Kingsbane was much less popular and as such they could get away with it more.
---
I didn't try to justify anything; only that there should be some compensation if a deck you've built around a core card gets nerfed. Dust refunds of an epic doesn't do the players justice.
---
Maybe it's because I'm old, but I never got any pleasure out of watching *other* people play video games. I want interesting changes made to the way *I* play the game. For a game as basic and simple as HS seems to be, it's a little flabbergasting that they're making such a big deal out of a thing that a majority of players will never experience, or even see. 
---
&gt;I play the card and then later i win that game.
---
This is why it's unreliable.  What about all those times you drew it and didn't play it?  It didn't help you win that game.
---
Let's think of a hypothetical card to demonstrate this.  The card is a 10 mana 1/1 with "Battlecry:  If your opponent is at exactly 1 life, you win the game".
---
Never under any circumstances are you going to play a 10-mana 1/1 if it doesn't immediately win you the game.  So we can expect that the played winrate for a card like that would be almost 100%.  Does that mean the card should be included in every deck, due to its extreme played winrate?  No, it just means that there are certain specific, rare situations where it wins you the game.
---
Currently, the card with the highest played winrate on hsreplay is Ticking Abomination, which is by all accounts a terrible card.  However, it's part of the Mechathun combo, so a disproportionate amount of the time, when you do play it, you win the game.
---
Played winrate just doesn't measure the strength of a card.  It measures something else, which is usually not useful to look at.
---
what do you mean yogg worked like zuljin?
---
But none of the tournaments are IN CLIENT. Using a 3rd party website just allows people to cheat and for admins to rule in favor of their friends.
---
This is true, none of the stats are perfect.  However, you can mitigate the effect you mentioned by considering the drawn winrate only in a relative sense.
---
If a card, when drawn, wins you less games than all other cards in your deck, it's more likely to be the worst card.
---
But then there's a card like DK Rexxar which is famous for having low mulligan, drawn, and played winrates.  Is DK Rexxar a bad card that you shouldn't include?  Haha NO, it is one of the best cards in the game.  So the stats just aren't perfectly valid measures of card strength.
---
His method you don't kill off your bloatbat, only use the fact it has poison on it to kill the 3/6.
---
I don't mean to totally hate on a well written and heartfelt post, but this is literally the same things everyone else has been saying in slightly different words. Like point for point the same criticisms. 
---
I mean.... say what you want about the quality of the game itself (which is mostly personal opinion), but 
---
Yep
---
I agree with you; I like Hearthstone because I'm not constantly bombarded with "play more!" baubles. I get enough of that in almost every other game I play, and it's irritating after a while. I come to Hearthstone for a bit of gentle thought and to play fun/meme decks on ladder. 
---
I always say "In Hearthstone you have to make your own fun" and it's true. If you're only playing to win then you're missing the point of the game! And if you're playing to have fun, then you don't need baubles to keep playing at all. The golden hero portraits are nice because if you play for long enough, you'll get them without trying, not as a reward, but as a mark of your continued support for the game.
---
Hyena should have 12 attack because 5 hounds die during the process.
---
imagine yogg, but with zuljin's workings
---
They don't gather data from their contributors, they gather data from the opponents.
---
In addition, for a decent amount of reliability, no matter the size of the population you're sampling from, you only need around 500 samples to answer simple questions.  That's a statistical reality.  Even if the entire population of planet earth played Hearthstone, the existing contributor base would be enough to capture the broad trends of the meta.
---
There's a reason they don't talk about decks with a 0.1% playrate, they don't have the data for that.  But such decks are extremely fringe regardless, and aren't necessary to include in a "meta report".
---
Dust is the equivalent of trading and sometimes more generous because even trash cards can be dusted for value while CCGs have cards worth literally pennies

Idk if best of three with the same deck is the way to go, but im glad to see pseudo sideboards and the first tournament with these new rules is going to be interesting to watch. It's at least a more digestible format. 
---
Great stuff. Do You already have a platform where you sell them and do you create any card a customer wishes? 
---
I would spend 35$ but I am hesitate because I live in China and of the international shipping fees and It would be very unfortunate if cards don‚Äôt arrive. 
---
Seasons aren't region locked (and tournaments happen on all three regions servers each week).  This is referred to as the NA season because the level 2 tournament they feed is in NA.

Yeah but that's fits for what i was saying... Just hard Mulligan for early Options and if ur Not that lucky, Well then Ur Just dead...
---
So if Genn/Baku get nerfed will Zuljin be the card that everyone cries about?
---
You‚Äôre not though. You even said you‚Äôre basing that on a single game sample size lmao. The deck literally runs brawl, deathwing, and a million ways to discount it. Not to mention that you can very easily be the tempo threat, even against warlock and rogue. 
---
Dont know i personaly Just dont Like the concept of having a shitty deck with some OP OP draws that decide the game
---
hsreplay.net
---
There you can see the meta and decks played for Standart, Wild and Arena.
---
Meta changes every expansion so every 4 month.
---
Meta can change aswell when there are nerfs/buffs.
---
I‚Äôm glad someone made this post again today. Good to see people are still complaining daily about this nonsense 
---
In what world are these shitty decks... what? It‚Äôs a Kazakus deck with a huge legendary dragon package and high end removal plus value fountains. 
---
I'm having a hard time getting to legend, keep struggling around rank 4üò¢. Any ideas on beating all the aids between rank 5 and legend? (wild)
---
So I just started playing again after a long break. Is the best way to play without spending a bleeding fortune buying packs to just buy Classic packs with the gold I earn, dust everything, and then craft what I need for one deck? I realize that this severely limits my deck choices, but I already had a halfway decent Hunter deck, so it only cost me ~400 dust or so to make a competitive low budget mid-range deck. 
---
I played a couple nights on the ladder, and I'm up to rank 17, which I think is pretty good for not playing in a couple years.
---
I'm no pro. My best season was rank 10 during Blackrock with a half-assed dragon priest deck. 
---
I'm loving the solo adventures. Is it worth it to save up gold for Kara? 
---
I can't do anything but agree.  And it honestly saddens me far more than any other company, or any other trend in gaming.  Blizzard was what got me really into gaming so many years ago.  I still remember the original Warcraft, and Tides of War.  Diablo was great.  But for me, Starcraft 1 was without equal.  After that, I was following everything Blizzard did.  They established their whole brand on the message that they would release it when it was good enough.  Like lots of people, I accepted every delay because I knew the final product would be worth the wait.  And in the very few cases that it wasn't up to snuff (Diablo 3), they would put in the time and effort that it took to fix it.
---
I don't see that anymore, the old Blizzard is just dead.  The latest WoW expansion finally killed my on-and-off addiction for good.  If I had to sum it up in 3 words, it would be "lazy and rushed."  Bugs and issues that should never have made it anywhere near live.  Features that the entire expansion was marketed around ended up feeling like they were the first pass at the drawing board.  They slapped something together and called it a day.
---
"Lazy and Rushed" would be exactly how I feel about the most recent HS announcement.  After saying for years that they were going to implement a tournament mode, now they do this, and it's hosted on a third party site?  And this is Hearthstone!  Compared to nearly any other game, the program itself is very very simple (as it should be, to work on mobile).  The amount of effort and money that it would take to develop tournament mode is minimal at best.  Warcraft 3 had automated tournaments over 15 years ago!  The fact that it doesn't yet exist in Hearthstone is completely ridiculous.  And honestly, it's kind of the final nail in the coffin for me in terms of my opinion of Blizzard.  The fact that the quality and attention to detail has fallen so far as to be outsourcing something this easy is just not ok.
---
Blizzard is dead.  And I don't really see myself supporting any Actiblizzard games anytime soon.
---
&gt; Great stuff. Do You already have a platform where you sell them and do you create any card a customer wishes? I would spend 35$ but I am hesitate because I live in China and of the international shipping fees and It would be very unfortunate if cards don‚Äôt arrive.
---
Hello my friend, how are you? I'll send you a private message explaining every detail! Thank you very much for your attention!
---
Er.... Vanilla WoW was literally EQ for casuals.... WoW has always relied on being casual friendly (for an MMO).
---
Nah. I personally think that since it‚Äôs part of the game that people should adjust to it. Plus think about to, if they nerf these two cards people will just find new cards to cry about. 
---
Damn that is spicy haha

Honestly, for a company that's whole calling card for years was "It'll come out when it's ready," how did we end up here?

Find me a single member of the Hearthstone team that actually believes this to be an improvement over a real sideboard. If it wasn't ready, they shouldn't have released it.

Any card that wants you to have no cards in hand is going to inherently be aggressive.
---
You misunderstand. 2 to 3 top meta decks. Not a single tier 2 or 3 deck. Also, my comment isnt meant to garner any sympathy so not sure what youre getting at.
---
Unless the priest applied a lot of pressure to cut through the druids armor? Plus even if he hard drops Mecha'thun, OP has plenty of damage in hand, on board, and even extra damage through fatigue. TL:DR? In this particular game, the druid did NOT have a way to win, unless OP concedes with honor, OR loses internet/power/battery on their gaming  system.
---
I have been fascinated by these bots for the last few days for some reason.  Here are some the ones I found (in order I faced them, some are repeated if they played a different class).  I am actually analyzing their AI since they seem WAY better than most bots I have seen in HS (although still have issues, like trying to cast spells on dormant Darkness and roping out when they can't).

It also applies to the warlock playing Void Contract if it's Mecha'thun vs Mecha'thun. In all seriousness I don't think there's enough single-card win conditions for warlock to really make a deck around Void Contract.

I wasn‚Äôt talking about how often you see your tech cards but responding to the proportion of SB slots available and the deck size.

5/30 is way, way less than 15/38-40.

for the record, MTG isn't moving to a multi deck bo1 format.  They're doing it once, at an exhibition event.  all the gps and pro tours(thought they're renamed) are still the same format they've always been.

&gt; What am I supposed to take from that, if not that the article is not good? He also implied that VS was not being objective, which is classic bad-faith arguing.
---
I'm pointing out that he didn't literally say what you claimed. It's semantics, but it's a discussion about *how* someone said something so it's important to make the distinction.
---
&gt;As you get into the downvoted posts there is a lot more negativity, but, well, they're downvoted.
---
I'm glad they were downvoted, perhaps many of the early commenters I saw just happened to end up in a minority in the end, but that doesn't change the fact that there are vocal parts of the community who get disproportionately angry at things that really don't deserve that kind of emotion. And downvotes in one thread don't always indicate something similar will be downvoted in another. I've seen extremely similar threads in the past end up with completely different responses in terms of upvotes and downvotes. It's often just a matter of who gets their first.
---
&gt;If team5 makes an announcement, and people are unexcited or unhappy about the announcement, there's no reason for them not to speak up.
---
I'm not arguing otherwise. I'm saying there were people who appeared to be speaking up to say they were upset we got this announcement instead of another as if one prevents the other from happening.
---
But I do agree, it seems that a lot were downvoted in the time that has passed since the announcement was first made. But with the way Reddit works, that's not always the case and it's frustrating to see announcements bombarded with misplaced negativity all the time.
---
HS as a CCG followed its established monetization approach. And initially, it was more generous than that, since they released adventure expansions with fixed card distribution in the first couple of years.
---
But the adventures went away and new expansions came more frequently and with even more Legendary cards than before, which is a pretty clear tell that management (again: sales) took over at some point.
---
Been slow to get to the login screen for Asia and often it just times out. The other servers seem fine.

More like both. Decks lost worst counters, but there is still some incentive needed. Look at Secret Paladin - it was good deck since the first nerf in Rastakhan, but there was no incentive to play it before nerfs to other paladin cards. 
---
In Magic, typically the way you play constructed is you bring a deck of 75 cards: 60 cards "mainboard" and 15 "sideboard." You play against your opponent in a best of three, as opposed to best of one that HS uses. You play your first game with just your 60 mainboard cards, but then in games two and three you are allowed to swap out any of your mainboard cards for cards in your sideboard. So, for example, if I were building a sideboard for Control Warrior in HS, its sideboard might contain cards like Gluttonous Ooze, Skulking Geist, Dirty Rat - things you want in specific matchups to target certain things your opponent is doing. Maybe you just wanna throw a Ysera in the sideboard so you have that big value option in control mirrors, but you don't have to deal with having a 9 mana idiot in your main deck if you're expecting a lot of aggro. 
---
It's essentially a toolkit of options your deck gets to play to tweak its matchups and better adjust for the field. Because of this, in MTG very linear, brittle strategies don't work nearly as well as they do in HS. If your entire deck is ruined by someone Polymorphing your Hadronox, and Tempo Mage players are expecting your deck and come rocking 2x Polymorph in their sideboard, then your deck doesn't work nearly as well.
---
It's what gives Magic most of its complexity, TBH.
---

You are hanging onto the notion that people still spend money on Hearthstone. I run a prominent gaming club on my university campus. None of ny Hearthstone club members are happy where the game is at and havent preordered since Witchwood. We have moved onto Super Smash Ultimate and Tetris 99 recently.

So i dont know who you are reffering to when you say people buy this shit.

I get that, but i don't get how a new and interesting tournament game mode. Is bad news for people who want new features. 
---
Yes it is a placed to pronounce your frustration but do it in a reasonable way.

At least for this change, they could make an argument/excuse that it was in the interest of the game, in regards to balancing neutral legendarys.
---
I spend way more than that a year, but I like having those golden cards üëå
---
People bitch because Blizzard once again did what they do best - they released a great product that became a huge hit to a huge amount of people and then several months later they put it on the backburner without adding anything meaningful to it. Blizzard have a problem with maintaining their games and Hearthstone was no different.
---
There were new and exciting cards but they were released one year ago and these sets powercreeped the game so much, they spent last year trying to tone it down. And because of this every set the game got felt like a rehash. If people played other TCGs before Hearthstone they'd know that rehashing happens fairly often but Hearthstone is an online game and there is only as much the same old thing one can endure before they realize it bores them.
---
And then we come to the community part of the whole problem. This is a modern thing and it is plaguing every competitive game nowadays. A new set releases, instead of trying to have fun their own way with cards and decks they are hyped about the majority of people playing just netdeck the best winning deck and roll with it. So the breath of fresh air of new expansions is quickly lost once the ladder starts getting dominated by the best net decks.
---
I won't touch on their change of models and prizing since this is another topic, entirely. 
---
If we get another blizzcon, it will happen in November.
---
what is dire frenzy cut for in these 2 decks? because the reason that vs doesnt include it is because there are better cards
---
I wanted to say ‚Äòmakes you realize how bad it was and it still is not good enough‚Äô. But back in the days we had less expansions so more time to get a larger portion of them. Very affordable adventures with as many cards that have actual impact on the meta. Also higher rarity cards weren‚Äôt nearly as strong as they are now. So do they give more? Yes, they do. Are pushing expansions more frequently, having more but lesser value bundles, not having better arena rewards, making excuses to put more legendaries in expansions (ow legendary weapons and spells are so special, right) and making more must have cards a higher rarity, moves of greed? Yes, it is. In comparison getting 7 dollars is better than 5 in absolute numbers is undeniably being more generous. But it has little to no impact for your collection. The more important number the evaluate generousity would be RELATIVE numbers. 5/10 is better than 7/25 and that is the situation we are in.
---
The game needs more improvements over time and they are not delivering on it. They can easily give every account a couple packs effortlessly, but if they have to implement something like the highly anticipated tournement mode, they would have to spend REAL LIFE RESOURCES.
---
They have promised more features and NOT DELIVERED. We have asked more deck slots for a long time, which they delayed a long time saying they did not know how to implement it, how to make the UI better and we got a lazy mere 9 slots that we have to scroll down.
---
So in my opinion they have become more greedy instead.
---
You did an incredible job. 
---
/u/mdonais we love u
---
You are right, I didn't realize the leftmost militia has 3 health.
---
Did you have fun with the deck? If yes did it boring quite quickly?
---
tbh many decks aren't fun to match up against, state of hs is so toxic right now 
---
It's still the same core. Odd Paladin is part of the problem. Stupid Cauldron or Prince Meme-Liam doesn't help, they only reduce the powerlevel of an overpowered deck, which shouldn't be part of the meta in the first place.
---
But oh, it's so funny, you got The Stormbringer from the Cauldron, never happened before /s
---
Developers may care, but the final decision is never their own. That's corporatism. Clueless marketing people and managers making decisions about game they probably don't even play, all they see is financial graphs and statistics. All of the decisions in the industry today are very simple: Do we get a lot of profit from it? Green light. No big profit? Scratch it, who cares about players feedback anyway.
---
&gt;If you opened up Hearthstone a little but more, the community would create new game types and an automated tournament environment. My proposal is to open the API of Hearthstone a little (similar to what is already done for China already).
---
This is NOT going to happen. Reminder, we're talking about the same company that:
---
- Sued Warcraft 3 tournaments to stop showing their game in 2010 in preparation for SC2 launch
---
- Sued Kespa, South Korean organizer of Brood War events, to stop showing Brood War for same reasons
---
- Sued private WoW server, Nostalrius, to stop hosting their game.
---
Activision-Blizzard will NOT open up their game to any extent; they are actually more likely to sue people who created Hearthstone Deck Tracker than give us appreciable freedom in creating our gameplay.
---

You are being very caustic towards someone just trying to have fun. I'm sorry hearthstone hurt you so bad though.

Wait, so after hysteria the minions can attack once more?

Wooop great job !

Maybe others want to have fun as well but Odd Palas don't allow that? I tried Tess Rogue in casual the last days and guess what? Almost only Odd Palas as opponents. In casual...
---
Don't mind, if I'm sick of this shit.
---
I thought I was the only one who uses/remembers this card back! GJ
---
You forgot that they increased the price of the game drastically by increasing the number of expansions per year and the number of legendaries per expansion.
---
The miniscule amount of free stuff they give doesn't even come close to offsetting that.
---
Can I add "warrior playing Dragon roar on turn 2"
---
Your casual mmr is sooo low you are getting matched against some bots, you will stop seeing them after a while.
---
Report them, but dont expect them to be banned inmediately. They ban in waves in order to avoid giving information to the botters on how they detected them. This way, if a botter did 3-4 patches in the last 3-4 months, and then gets banned, he may thing something he changed in the last version is what triggered the system and revealed him. But in truth, it could be something he did 3 patches away.
---
Of course, the botters know they are getting banned in waves, but this doesnt give out yet what is the thing they need to improve in order to remain undetected, so it slows them down, and by creating more problems for people to create/use bots, it deterrs people for actually trying to bot, so less bots will be in the game.
---
But yeh, always in any game someone will use bots. At least, in hearthstone, they are nowhere the level of the normal players (although some botters say they reached legend with bots, so it seems there are some advanced ones that people dont recognice as bots) and therefore stay always in very very low ranks with shit decks, giving free wins to real people. They still need to win in order to get gold so the efficiency of those bots is really low.
---

Well i dont want to get THAT drunk!
---
I will make a list of your guys ideas and who knows, maybe we‚Äôll make a second board :-) 
---
You apparently never played during mean streets. There was only 4 decks you played. Pirate warrior, jade druid, renolock or aggro shaman. You are factoring one small part to the whole meta. Yes warlock didnt have a deck in ungoro, but the polarity between every other deck out there was minimal, They were interactive and people generally enjoyed the expansion. Yes, witchwood had the best class representation, but the meta is awful, the game is hemmoraging players, streamers are leaving left and right to play other games, because let's face it... most matches are decided on what class your playing against and what your mulligan is. 
---
Side note: My dragoncaller alanna has no face monkaW
---
Dat fat twitch paycheck of course /s
---
&gt; Why try to force the format into an existing one, though?
---
Because the playerbase is dwindling at this point, so further dividing it would be dangerous.
---
&gt;Yeah, you can sometimes draw conclusions on what your opponent is playing based on their class, but what if you sideboard wrong and give yourself an even worse matchup? You'd be punishing yourself for having knowledge of the meta.
---
That's just another aspect of the game to consider.  Maybe if you have a specific tech selection against Paladin class for example, it includes cards that are strong against multiple Paladin archetypes.  
---
&gt;Instead of shoehorning sideboards into a best of one format, what Blizzard should do is similar to what Magic Arena is doing adding more modal cards to expansions that have tech options as well as more maindeckable options on individual cards.
---
It would be tricky if not impossible to balance cards like this.  Historically Hearthstone has always had this problem.  
---
Kinda op with warlock quest ngl pls nerf

Really? What five cards can I add to, say, Odd Rogue, to make Caverns Below a viable configuration?

Ressurect is the one thing in this game that feels unfair to play against. Maybe it isnt unfair, but it sure feels like it. 
---
He is one of the main game developer from team 5, the team that created Hearthstone, the game you and I play, and that this subreddit was created for.
---
The tweet was a direct question to the playerbase about "what would make them go back to hearthstone", and people are voicing their own problems by responding to the tweet, hoping he reads it and it helps change the direction of the game.
---
Yo! I just started playing and opened 15 packs of Classic, and the best cards are pushing me towards Mage and Paladin. From what I've played so far I like those classes as Mage seems like Control + Burn and Paladin feels like Aggro with buffing. I am "U/B Control" player in MTG, typically.
---
Does that sound about right? What are the playstyles of the other heroes, and is there a better hero for control style play than Mage?
---
Cheers!
---
Tehnically this is just an azalina that is good in discolock
---
&gt; Because the playerbase is dwindling at this point, so further dividing it would be dangerous.
---
You think injecting a feature meant for best of three into the game's main best of one mode would *well* received?
---
&gt;That's just another aspect of the game to consider.
---
That's not something players should have to consider in this kind of format. It just turns what should be a strategic feature into a crap shoot.
---
&gt;Historically Hearthstone has always had this problem.
---
Outside of Druid and Kalimos, which modal cards are you referring to that have been problematic?
---
Great read up on the specialist format. It‚Äôs nice to see an opinion from an actual pro on it.
---
Not sure why so many were complaining that it only affected pros. The announcement was obviously gonna be hearthstone esports only.
---
And there goes my weekend
---
I‚Äôm not sure you understand. The league itself, where all the investments are going into, is doing quite well in terms of viewership. So there are viewers, there‚Äôs plenty of ads, sponsors from companies like Toyota, etc. the BRs aren‚Äôt killing overwatch because it‚Äôs a completely different type of game. It‚Äôs more in competition with csgo, and the overwatch league had more viewers than the recent cs major. 
---
Some people love the doom and gloom story. Sometimes stuff just goes well. But hey, haters gonna hate. 
---
We have clearly seen that they seem to disregard the community to an extreme to make profit. Last Blizzcon showed us exactly how far Blizzard is willing to.
---
They knew 100% that a huge fucking shitstorm would follow the Diablo: Immortal announcement. 
---
If their business model of pissing off fans in the name of profit will work in the long run? I guess we will see.
---
Some adjustments are to be made for sure! We‚Äôre trying the game for the first time tonight! 
---
Nice not rant with a clear view, arguments and possible improvments.
---
Upvoted
---
That'd be a cowardly way to go out.

I'll mark it as spoiler, because otherwise people on this sub may notice and it'll break the game

But damn blizzcon 2019 is gonna be something. Can‚Äôt wait to see those 3 hosts talking about how awesome the panels are gonna be. Hilarious.  
---
Precision 
---
&gt; The current state of ladder is not good. I hope that people are open to changing something that is currently not being well received. At least it would be fresh.
---
The issue with the ladder has thing to do with the format though.
---
&gt;How is this not even more strategic than the game is now? Most people just cut and paste decklists and cross their fingers hoping to queue into positive matchups. Any change that gives players multiple ways to tackle a single problem is a positive one at this point.
---
People love to oversimplify the game but there are still decisions to make in favorable matchups from the mulligan to the very end of the game. Adding a feature that lets you change the makeup of your actual deck based solely on the opponent's class removes the entire point of sideboarding which is to respond to your opponent's specific deck, not what you *think* their deck might be before you even play against it. This sounds more like a plot to make off-meta decks better but in really arbitrary way that would only make the game more frustrating.
---
&gt;Maybe I misunderstood what kind of cards you're referring to. How would these look?
---
They'd be like Choose One cards where one option is something fairly maindeckable and the other option is something more techy. Like "Destroy a Murloc OR draw a card" or "Your opponent's spells cost 1 more next turn OR freeze a minion." Stuff like that. Obviously you'd need to balance them out, base the options off the meta, and you wouldn't flood the game with them, but include just enough that players can run some tech that isn't completely worthless outside of one or two matchups in a best of one format. Currently, tech tends to be either worthless or staples. Probably the best we ever had was Golakka Crawler because it's statline and beast tag helped it play a role even when you weren't facing pirates. But those kinds of designs are really limited in a game like Hearthstone would adding the modal Choose One aspect.
---
What has changed is that rather than top finishes over three months, these masters qualifiers are over one month. Three months of top finishes is reserved for only the most dedicated players, but the system of reaching top 200 in a single month is doable for any legend player who puts their mind to it.
---
Hearthstone.
---
Sounds like it, since nothing is getting healed.
---
If MTG has shown anything, it's that the underlying game mechanics and innovation thereof are vastly more important to long term survival than any client niceties.  MtG:O is probably the *worst* user interface currently installed on my computer.  MtG:O tournaments have famously crashed and burned.  Despite being a *trading* card game, the trading interface in Mtg:O is *absolutely terrible*.  And yet people still play because MtG:O is MtG (although MtG:O numbers have been declining recently because of Arena, which is MtG with a *not* shitty interface).
---
Adding a better Tournament mode or other "quality of life" improvements aren't going to make or break Hearthstone's long term survival.  They matter to a minuscule portion of Hearthstone's revenue stream (i.e., players).  To survive, Hearthstone needs to be an engaging game.  In my opinion they need to focus more on card design and crafting a balanced meta with each expansion.  They need to ensure games aren't decided *a priori* by deck selection.  They should probably work on more interaction / disruption mechanics.  Too many games feel like "Did I draw my 'I win' card before my opponent drew theirs?", and that's not an engaging experience.
---
Secret Odd Mage and Odd Warrior are only losing a few cards so they feel pretty safe. However, Baku might get nerfed (the devs have hinted at it) before or after the rotation.
---
No one plays those games though.
---
If you already have a spot in the masters, then it probably doesn't matter. But if you are looking to qualify, finish top 200 gets a chance to compete in a tournament for a spot in the masters. As you said, only top four from that qualifying tourny get spots.
---
I don't know if blizzard is still tracking points for the 1-star, 2-star, 3-star masters thing separately. Ladder may still matter for that point system if it exists.
---
Well played, sir! Well played.
---
this is beyond so close. It‚Äôs basically the same unless you‚Äôre running discard lock
---
Sorry, what was the question again? 
---

---
I thought so too. The other guy's comment totally checks in. Im already in the 170 spot so im really hyped to get myself a top 4 on the qualifiers. Thank you so much for clearing this up. :)

I don't remember that he ever addressed the comment -- for clarification or apology -- which makes it a no from me.
---
Topsy Turvy literally built an OTK deck when it came out. That deck wasn't necessarily great, but the card itself CLEARLY enables degenerate combos because (NO SURPRISE HERE) 0 mana cards are extremely dangerous.
---
2/14 divine shield isn't anything really special, but now you just see how Divine Shield/Inner Fire limits design space. Printing any high health minion that can be cheated out puts that combo on the map.
---
divine spirit inner fire was only a rare meme before shadow visions improved its consistency. throw in oakheart and enforcer and you get a feeling of hopelessness that frustrates people. 
---
They can be bought in the store. Just bought Nax a couple of weeks ago.
---
I absolutely lost it at cow
---
Think again: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Moo...
---
Mass Dispel is definitely a polarizing card. Aside from Armor, Taunt is basically the only proactive way to prevent OTKs by minion damage. Mass Dispel invalidates Taunt as a defense tool against combos. It's generally not a busted card, but when it works it's definitely a little oppressive.
---
It does feel good to steal the enforcer, but you can still get hit by shadow madness for the kill. Shadow madness + mass dispel if you have any of your own taunts + divine spirit and topsy = 28 damage for 10 mana. 
---
I do agree that control priest has an okay matchup here, but it's always possible to get cheesed somehow. 
---
I would keep in mind the need to print "worse" cards for arena to function. I think a lot of the really lame cards that are strictly lame are cards with little abilities or text, or vanilla cards. The reason such cards need to exist is to add the statline to cards in standard for arena. I'm going to make a couple parallels to MTG here. MTG's limited format is exactly the same, because rarities are still tied to open rates there, (arena has buckets now), certain cards have to be certain rarities. They also print garbo cards for limited (MTG's arena equivalent).
---
Here's a really widely known article in the MTG community by MaRo, a pretty prevalent head in the card game industry. I would definitely give it a read. I think the notion of bad cards printed is a lot more accepted in the MTG community because of it. Not to mention, I'd argue MTG has a higher % of shitty unplayable cards than HS as well.[why bad cards are printed](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-2002-01-28). The article aged pretty well because Lion's Eye diamond (LED) is quoted by the complaint as utter garbage, and they can't see why anyone would play the card. Since then (the card was less than a dollar), it's $180 each now...
---
Tried. No repairs required.

Not MTG Players, Wizards of the Coast wants that Hearthstone money... and it looks like they're already getting it. Now we'll see if they end up holding on to Best of 3 or if they screw the pooch trying to copy the 'bad' of Hearthstone along with the good. 
---
Yeah, I think the future of gaming is in mods since it's too expensive to build systems from the ground up.
---
What are y‚Äôall on? My 2012 handled it like a beast for awhile.
---
I doubt it.
---
This is actually hilarious
---
To an extent. It also the case that this particular sub has always had a toxic undercurrent that often erupts into outright hostility towards the devs that just is not merited. That said, I agree that they need to step up their game. The fact that they are soliciting community feedback is great. It's a pity that some (not all!) of us are taking that opportunity to just bash the devs some more. I don't want an opportunity to improve the game lost to yet another round of "WE HATE BLIZZ!"
---
Godfrey is only used in warlock decks and Zilliax is the strongest card in its set, used in nearly every deck.
---
I would get zilliax for that reason simply because as a starting player I wouldn't get specific class legends over good neutral minions.
---
I'd agree the software was (is?) awful but no way did hardcore players only use it. It was used heavily by casuals. 
---
Nerubian Unraveller would not work. Mass Dispel would cost 6 correct? So Mass Dispel into 2x Divine Favor into Topsy is GG.
---
The problem with this deck is usually not that the combo is busted, it's that Mass Dispel removes your ability to counterplay by making a wall.
---
OTKs arent degenerate by definition. Combo decks are necessary for a healthy metagame the same way aggro and control decks are. And this deck is not that broken because of topsy turvi and for being 0 mana, the same thing can be achieved with inner fire (as we can see in the screenshot, this was the case).
---
Divine **spirit** and inner fire dont limit anything at all, and even if they did, that doesnt mean its automatically degenerate and unhealthy. Just because you dont like combo decks it doesnt mean they shouldnt exist at all.
---
Also, mogossh enforcer is not being cheated out at all. It costs 8 mana. He is being pulled by oackhearth, that costs 9 mana. Paying 9 mana for a 5/5 and an 8 cost is not fucking mana cheating, its tutoring. You guys dont even know what the fuck you are talking about, just trowing words that you dont even understand to pretend you know about the topic in disscusion.
---
This just made me realize that I already have streaming mode off and it still runs like Crysis on a Gameboy Color.
---
Judging by your user name, you're clearly a sadist. 
---
Im playing Odd control as well. Ive been playing  it a lot this month. I find when I do get the wins against priest, its wall or dragon - never OTK. Dragon is easier to beat, but when I do beat wall priest, its because I force out all 4 AoE cards. Mass hysteria is random, and you can often play around it as their minions dont start dropping until late. 
---
We haven‚Äôt seen any game of the format in action. Hard to make absolute judgments just yet. There are many different types of skills and different formats highlights different aspects of it.
---
Choosing, selecting, and constructing your pre-set packages is a very skillful thing to do right. Understanding which macro components of which kind of matchups you need to tweak to gain an edge is quite complex. How is there no agency in deciding which tech or substitutions go in each of the decks (1, 2, 3)?
---
You could argue on the flip side that selecting 10 great cards and adapting on the go is not as skillful. I think it is but a different type of skill. Deckbuilding is definitely highlighted in this format. We‚Äôll see. I wouldn‚Äôt rule it out just yet
---
If you don't think a company of that size can implement a tournament mode in 5 years-you are super confused.
---
I think Mass Hysteria into Holy Nova is a guaranteed lethal too
---
I'm not sold on Specialist as a format. While your point about targetting decks is very true, I feel Specialist may lead to more matches decided on lineup. It's far easier to pick one deck to target an archetype, than 4. So players would have to be very cautious about bringing (often exciting) archetypes which have a major weakness. For example, In previous metas, no one could ever bring Freeze mage, as it would be an auto-loss vs CW, and no amount of tweaking could bring the % to a reasonable level. As participants (and viewers) we may be losing out on seeing some great decks. I also feel it would get boring to watch (and play) the same decks facing off vs eachother over and over, especially when one side is heavily unfavored. 
---
That said, it does make the competitive scene much more affordable. Even the lowliest F2Per can afford 1 tournament worthy deck, so you may get a lot more interest. It also kills the argument that competitive success is P2W.  
---
The control version is pretty hard, you basically have 9 turns hard clock. They also have tons of board clears. However, aggro version is very popular lately and that is easy for odd pal.
---
Sounds like blizzard
---
In theory, but I don‚Äôt think that works either. I think there‚Äôs some HS shenanigans going on behind the scenes so that no matter what you steal (unless her hand is fully empty somehow) she‚Äôll have the combo ready. Kinda like how the wicked witch always draws Twisting Nether on 8.
---
He then hits with the weapon and picks Journey to Ungoro for the EZ win. 
---
Sorry, I'll rephrase, it should double twice when healing your own face by that logic.  Also spirit lash makes more sense, because it's actually doing 2 things; damaging the enemy and healing your own face.
---
Did they ever fix the issue with Kel‚ÄôThuzad+taunt making the AI never attack into taunt? I remember that from a while ago but wonder if that‚Äôs still abusable. 
---
Namely Shadowverse.
---
The problem is, you can only attack with this stolen minions in 2 whole turns.  One turn to steal, and another turn where it has summoning sickness. 
---
Can't tell if sarcastic or not.... ü§î
---
As all things should be
---
&gt;Though restricted to Priest and costing mana, Mind Blast never sees play. 
---
There are 3 priest decks in the meta right now and 2 of them (control and gallery) run 2 copies of mind blast.
---
ITT: sarcastic use of words is hard to detect.
---
&gt; I still somewhat enjoy standard, but the combo heavy meta makes many early turns feel useless.
---
Dude you play wild. Place of turn 4 Barnes into Ragnaros. Place of Thekal into 2 giants. Place of poison seeds into spreading plague. Wild is fun because low ranks are fun. High rank standard is not better than standard. Don't use wild to crticize standard.
---
 
---
PIzJustDie#2621 80g EU trade
---
Add a tab for 'pinned decks' and we're good to go.
---
I m assuming you asked for a friend?
---
I'm skeptical. If you're aggro Paladin, what do you tech in to beat Odd Warrior? It's a bad matchup no matter what, you might just close the margin a little. The tech cards in HS generally do very specific things that aren't big enough to change a losing matchup to a winning one unless it was already pretty close.
---
I chose bloodyface, primarily because everyone seems to be voting for my first instinct, Bunnyhoppor.
---
Yeah for a friend..
---
&gt;I have no issues, therefore no one has any issues
---
Quite true. I have a friend who doesn't have a good pc so he plays only on his phone so other games aren't accessible for him.
---
&gt; Stop complaining about things that don't apply to you.
---
As I recall they often delay, even further, addressing nerfs of cards because of the "e-sports" tournament that happens to be taking place around that time.
---
So, from that stand point it absolutely affects the majority of the player base for an extreme minority of people. 
---
I versed a couple in wild ranked around 18/19. Tried to add them, because I wanted to know why they were playing all basic cards, but no luck.
---
I wish they had a system similar to overwatch or HOTS where after every level of a hero you get a loot box.
---
&gt;Hearthstone will be part of blizzards development focus and gain more developers. 
---
Yeah and because they said it, it must be true...
---
&gt;Tournament mode is still planned. 
---
When a feature is being "planned" for multiple years it's not looking too good for the game
---
&gt;And a very interesting rotation is comming up. And the meta is pretty diverse and sports some new and interesting decks.
---
Yeah because the last rotation made the game so much healthier and entertaining...
---
No offense but you honestly do sound like the average Blizzard Fanboy that is to blame for the state the company that is in. 
---
Blizzard sells a brown bag full of dogshit with their logo on and you throw your wallet at them. Obviously they are going to produce more shit in more brown bags.
---
Look across all games they make. You can't find anything positive. BfA is a failure. The hype around Jaina was thanks to the race, not because Blizzard did a good job. HotS got completely gutted, Diablo hasn't received a meaningful update in years and the future is a fucking mobile game nobody asked for. Overwatch is doing okay I guess? And then obviously Hearthstone which is still in maximum "minimum effort" mode. No proper new features, rewards, anything people *actually* asked for. Great we now get a rare golden card every 3 months. All hail Blizzard?
---
You can continue to pretend that nothing is wrong with them but Blizzard(/Activision) are massively ruining the legacy of what was a fucking institution in the gaming industry. 
---
&gt;Tournament mode is still planned
---
AFAIK you're just talking out of your ass there, pretty sure they deconfirmed it a while ago. 
---
if you get max 100 g per day plus gold from quests, basically you can get full collection everytime an expansion comes out (roughly 20k gold per 4 months). I guess thats is more like the purpose of the bots. It is much cheaper to buy a bot accounts with all the cards than paying for the packs.
---
In Slay the Spire?
---
I saw someone mention the golden card quests which sounds like something I‚Äôd easily try to grind to. My favorite class is hunter (since GvG relax guys) and it‚Äôs the only class I have golden but my motivation to keep playing it went down drastically after hitting the 500 wins
---
Pretty sure they run 6.
---
Sounds promising but legit question - if this is how the mode is implemented, would the meta look any different from ladder?
---
When TB is brawliseum I always one and done it because if I wanna pay gold I'd rather do arena.  If I am gonna play net decks (or home brew) then the advantage is I don't have to pay gold.
---
My concern with this format is without bans and line ups, it would basically be the same meta as ranked.  While I still think it would be a nice addition to the game (side note - really like the idea of a free run once a week or month and would be nice if arena implemented it to attract newer players to the format), if the meta is the same as ladder, I don't know how much I personally (as an intermediate player who usually grins to 2 each season) I would play it.
---
The only other small crack in this plan is that players who never hit legend but are above average players, they could easily just stay at rank 1 (or even get an alt account) and farm new players.  Alternatively someone whose skill level is really more around a "rank 4-5 player" but who grinded the hell one month for a cardback, they may feel locked out.  Using the casual MMR or the arena format (match against players with same number of win/losses as you) would work around this.  Just food for thought.
---
are you making good trades?
---
Is this relevant if playing on an ipad or tablet?  Sorry newb question.
---
If there was a word for Druid, I'd go with punishing. A Druid punishes every play an opponent makes in the early-game, leaving the Druid in a very good state to clean house. Play a low health minion? Druid kills it and draws a card. Play a field of tokens? Swiped. Draw many cards? Druid can mill you. Play... absolutely nothing to not get punished? Druid ramps to punish you harder.
---
Rexxar can't really punish the same way Druid can historically.
---
Favourite thing to do vs mechathun druid is zihi, then psychic scream it into their deck. Usually when they draw it and realise they have to play it, sabotaging their own combo it's a concede. 
---
It is pretty pointless to try to debate with this person.  They don't have facts, obviously don't change their decks for the current meta of whatever time they are playing and tweak them based on their comments, and further more as a mage they have easy answers to what they were playing against.  These answers are voodoo doll + Ping, amazing AOE to help clear it, freezes potentially, and more.
---
Sure they didn't have them in this hand and I can't see what his minions attacked, but there was time to deal with the threat on board.
---
The issue in the past with decks being "Fun and Interactive" was literally not being able to kill the opponent and then they kill you in 1 turn with zero chance to counter it.  Hooraay Frost Mage.  
---
In the deck he played against he had a chance to counter it. That minion was on the board a turn before he lost. 
---
No afraid not as streamer mode is pc only
---
It's a fucking rule change. You can't equate that to in-game development. And no, there isn't a time cost as there's a separate esports team. It was also a much needed change.
---
And don't put up a strawman that I don't want any in-game development or that I don't think there shouldn't be. They should invest resources, preferably into a new constructed game mode and maybe a draft one as well (where you can put the event bullocks and so on). All I'm saying is that that's a separate issue entirely. 
---
There is this weird sentiment in this sub that the casual player, hell in particular the non-paying ones, should be the only ones pandered to. One example I saw recently was that someone suggested that high Legend should have real rewards and someone else reacted extremely adversily 'because they have cards'. How does it hurt you? It really bothers me how offended people get by others getting nice things.
---
One last note is that there has definitely been some development. Arena, an ignored mode for many years, has gotten through a lot of phases until it ended up at something that was actually really nice. There have been a variety of events and a ton of single-player content. Again, just because you don't care for it doesn't mean it's not a great change.
---
It's not wrong, it's just business. If they print less pack filler cards - you get the good ones faster. If you get the good cards faster - you will spend less money. If you spend less money - Blizzard earns less revene. 
---
The funny part is you probably played against a bot
---
'how does blizzard make more money with these changes?' 
---
1. How does that apply to the topic?
---
2. Why can't others have nice things just because they're in the minority?
---
Was going to say zoo decks work with most classes. And some cards just work no matter what. Happy ghoul / imp master / swamp giant 
---
Sorry for my spelling. Dont reamber to names all that well. 
---
I still think Team 5 didn't get enough shit for the Shudderwock fiasco. It's like they didn't test it at all. 
---
It would be cool to have no level caps with gold/stardust rewards as you reach new levels beyond 60. 
---
I have 0 legendarys and 0 dust, living that broke life :(
---
The game is five years old. At it's peak it was rajing in ~43million bucks A MONTH. It's beyond inexcusable there aren't more features or ways to play the game.
---
Godfrey if you're only going to play Warlock. Zilliax if you're going to play anything else. Tbh zilliax if great in Warlock too so either one is fine.
---
I think Rank 15 - 10 in wild are in a good spot. I even got a 60% Winrate in over 30 games with Renouncelock. You face some Net decks but they are often piloted by terrible players.
---
I don't think either are replaceable. Crowley is a star card that either gets dealt with that turn or GG, and countess is refill that the deck doesn't have. 
---
Ziliax is in just about every slower deck and then some, where it's always extremely strong. Godfrey is strong, but just a tech addition to a couple of slow Locks. 
---
It's neutral healing and removal that also happens to be decent tempo. It even got some mech synergy tacked on. If a card does so much, it's a must have.
---
The game and Blizzard as a whole is in a shit spot right now. There‚Äôs nothing good to say that hasn‚Äôt been said a while ago. We could make false positive claims that tell Blizzard nothing about how we feel and tell them to keep doing the same, or we could be honest and say the game is in a bad spot right now. 
---
I agree. I play Jadewock and it is insanely fun. I even faced a Gunspire Warrior.
---
Ave#2806 EU. Looking to trade 80g quest.
---
And also put your game on SSD, if you have any.
---
I... never actually knew there was a game console ban in China. I guess that explains China's love for mobile games in general. I always thought it was a convenience/cultural thing.
---
Ouch. See if you can make a budget zoo warlock deck, you may be able to pull it off
---
I mean a lot of them just play classic midrange and I think hearthstone is at its best when it‚Äôs these types of decks fighting for control of the board over the course of the game. Over time that has become more and more diluted in standard with combo and other over-said things. When it‚Äôs a battle of attrition and making smart trades your play feels impactful and important, rather than just solitaire or Rock Paper Scissors. 
---
&gt;So i dont know who you are reffering to when you say people buy this shit.
---
Like I said, people on this subreddit! And if people on the subreddit are doing it, 100% there are plenty of people in-game doing it too. But the people on the subreddit don't get downvoted, they get upvoted. Which means people are also SUPPORTING those who want to spend money on the game.
---
That might be at least 4 but I need someone to confirm the math.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
I chose Ike because I like Ike
---
Complaining about somebody playing the best deck in the competitive mode ü§≠
---
Would it really though? What if this is Un'Goro format, and you're matched up against a Mage? 
---
It could reasonably be Tempo Secret Mage, Control/Burn Mage, or Quest Mage, each of which played rather differently from one another. How would sideboarding before you even know what you're playing against in such a case be useful?
---
Sure, you could maybe side in an Eater of Secrets since that should do something against all three decks, but what if its a format where Cube Warlock, Zoo Warlock, Even Warlock, and Combo Warlock are all fairly viable at the same time like right now? Is it really useful in such a case? Quite often you can side into something meant to help deal with Zoo but actually end up playing against Cube, slanting your chances away from winning.
---
I don't seem to see complaints about rush warrior. Not yet at least.
---
And making it more fun for the people that are play HS on a daily basis because these expansions bring a lot more cards.
---
try to search for the last omnistone vod https://twitter.com/Omnislash/status/1098752793341358080
---
haven't seen they upload it on the yt channel yet, other than that , your best bet is to ask them when they stream and maybe they will response if they read chat.
---
It gets countered by cube is just about as good of a complaint as ‚ÄúIt gets killed by BGH‚Äù you can‚Äôt just use a random situation to say a card or combo is bad. 
---
I think you were joking but anyway - Playerbase retention. It's about not making less money.
---
To be fair, I have a lot of friends that also play Hearthstone and none of us have experienced this problem on desktop or mobile.
---
What specific boss do you need help with?
---
Thanks for the comment!
---
I was starting to get depressed thinking everyone here were already thinking the game is uninteractive and topsy turvi is degenerate and toxic and fuck blizzard etc etc techs dont work for anything.
---
I think..? I havent played *that* much, I have like a total of ~50 wins, not much experience
---
Don‚Äôt forget the dairy farmer
---
Ok, what tech card would you run in Warrior to beat Mechathun?  Even if you run Hakkar, you need to find a way to draw it and kill it before they combo.  They can even run Skulking Geist if they are afraid of that.
---
Or what about Exodia Paladin or Quest Rogue?  What tech cards are you running in Warrior to beat those variations?  And infinite resources like Rexxar aren't guaranteed either.  You can make it closer with a Cube/Direhorn package but you are unfavored and there isn't a real counter to it.
---
The only class that is well situated to respond to a variety of threats is Warlock.  They can make meaningful tech choices and we don't need to see this in practice.  We can see it in ladder when people try to counter/tech against specific decks and cannot.
---
Hello my friend, got any more angles of the card?
---
80g quest NA StanDalone#1521
---
It's almost like there are different teams in Team 5 that work on different areas of Hearthstone.  The esports team has little say on what card designers, UI designers, mode designers, or anyone else on Team 5 do.  They literally just plan and get approval for esports content.
---
It's an echo chamber and people here are the vocal minority (usually at least).
---
You have to think that reddit represents a portion of like minded people who play the game which means it is a bad place to poll for opinions on certain things. 
---
MTGA is really the only competition I can see anywhere close.
---
Yup...it also fueled my drinking problem...bar to room to work...my cousin traveled with me for a while then suddenly got cancer and was gone in like 2 months at 40 years old...I stopped traveling after that because it just wasn't the same alone and made me realize how miserable I was and how reckless I was being in general. I miss the money and the per diem sometimes but now my overall health and outlook on things is much more positive.
---
This is where the fun begins, and dont forget to assign flair at top
---
Along with the thoughts on a 100% custom deck, o think a nice QoL change could just be a ‚Äúfull collection‚Äù mode for playing vs the innkeeper and friends list only. Neither of these modes offer any gold (other than 10 and 100 wins) so couldn‚Äôt just be spammed. But would be a nice way to ‚Äútest out‚Äù deck ideas without the dust expenditure. Ladder and Innkeeper couldn‚Äôt be any less comparable either. 
---
I think it could really give people a taste of what‚Äôs available to people who spend money. 
---
Want to play solo adventures? Use your collection. 
---
Want to play casual or ranked with matchmaking? Use your collection. 
---
Play against friends, for fun? Get access to the entire card pool. 
---
No, their official statement said they pause the development but still planmed to release it at a later date. Google it. 
---
This is not in the game at all, it's just a format for tournaments.
---
I did but it didn't register or something I put it as a highlight
---
Eternal Servitude was like the worst idea of Blizzard in KFT
---
&gt; Some people hated ‚Äúcurvestone‚Äù, but I enjoyed that more than ‚Äúcombostone‚Äù. But to each their own.
---
I am the same. I hate combo and otk decks. I also hate death knights and midrange has always been my favorite but your post sounds like a sneak shot at standard while promoting wild. Wild is not different from standard if not worse.
---
delet this
---
I think the recent uptick in new model cards has more to do with the plane the last two sets have been set in, Ravnica, as it has always been associated with split cards and cards like the Guild Charm cycle more so than their desire to compensate for a lack of sideboard play in MTG Arena currently.
---
Lol you all really enjoy playing Hearthstone nowadays? You brainless cunts love playing against the same decks that just OTK you and you have to draw one of 3-4 cards to counter it? That‚Äôs fun to you? I think you morons are the vocal minority.
---
I was thinking that, lol. But he said well played, so either he‚Äôs human or a good bot :)
---
The endless achievements and goals things is more a consequence of casino services like Hearthstone. It's alright for a game to be designed to have finite goals and play. Hearthstone wants as many people playing as possible, while also encouraging a subset of them to make purchases. 
---
In some ways, I kind of think logging in to Hearthstone and completing daily quest out of habit as kind of a problem. The fact that immediately after you're asking yourself what's next builds into it. Ideally the reason you logged in would be to play the game because you wanted to and felt like 
---
Once you get into thinking of how you can incentivizes players to feel a need to log in daily, reward intervals, addictive psychology, etc, you're no longer designing just a game, you're making a casino with more concerns than just making as good a game as possible. 
---
I love druid..tends to be so underrated..or not played often
---
blizzard is evil they deserve our skorn you are just a shill.
---
Thanks for a reasonable response. 
---
I never said there are no reasons to complain or that there are good changes to demand. 
---
I am mostly refering to the destructive annoying meme tone it took on. 
---
Also nothing is not quite fair, but yeah no revolution that is true. 
---
When the guy in my friendslist plays the tier 1 deck I usually just instaconcede so the game ended to quickly and remove them from my friendslist. Only fun players allowed in my friendslist.
---
Thank you, finaly some reasonable respones. 
---
Playing doomsayer before she attacks makes her say "oh are we fighting?" Then still do nothing
---
What does the streaming setting actually do???
---
Check Muzzy's Twitch. He did an hour-long talk about it with Justsaiyan and Purple.
---
No clue
---
That's just your personal opinion.
---
Uncollectible cards aren't even supposed to have a rarity! The way it's designed, you could just put Ascension 6 in your deck right from the start!

I didn't have to read the post just to know this...

I love the personal attacks.
---
I play from time to time, just like any other game. Sometimes at work on lunch, sometimes at home while playing civ with friends, just whenever.  
---
I don't play combo decks but yeah you know.... keep insulting other people.  
---
Have fun with whatever man.  IF you're not enjoying it then don't play it and why are you still here?
---
Yeah but its one of (if not the most) toxic reddit I have ever seen... its worrying me
---
Have fun man! good luck on the climb
---
Your post is beyond redundant on the topic. Good job. 
---
531 packs retroactively? Sweet.
---
Ya I add people asking for the deck or just saying gg fun game, sometimes people don‚Äôt accept it which is fine as I have a fairly large friends list already.

We should all be so lucky tbh

It doesnt heal them first, however. The multiplier definetely should only apply once instead of twice.
---
But the developers are shit, right? They certainly will waste that potential like they have been doing this last 2 years, right?
---
I cant make it past the 3rd boss on Toki.
---
You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, huh?
---
Thanks! :D
---
You cant play bingo on a 4 by 5 grid.
---
Yeah this format is cheaper and arguably more intuitive/ accessible. UI wise it's pretty much the same
---
However if their main issue was with the format and they already had specialist in development why cancel tournament mode for "the forseeable future" over this? They more or less said they'd focus on social features first 
---
It's pretty clear team 5 had other issues with how to approach in client tournament (and said as much in their interviews)
---
&gt;Ultimately, we were forced to conclude that we needed to think about how and where we want to improve Hearthstone‚Äôs overall social experience before we can tackle adding a satisfying and robust implementation of In-game Tournaments that all players can enjoy. 
---
yeah and a lot have joined
---
Should i switch using warlock if all my cards are going now? I have more kobold cards than everything else combined
---
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE, WOW!
---
Everything that doesn't one-shot from hand is cool with me. 
---
Ive been playing this game for 3 years and i lost 2 accounts so i wont call myself a starting player
---
So I‚Äôve been playing for less than a year and I was scared of the rotation since like last April, so I only opened a few of the rotating sets, I feel like I‚Äôm lacking cards to make any real completed decks and now that they are rotating, I‚Äôm scared to craft or waste my dust.
---
Two times in a row, damn. Huge sample size.
---
Imagine if at the end of each match, the discover mechanic is used to select your next deck. 
---
For the decision if you like the crazy world of wild with OP combos and cards there is nothing better than just queue up in wild ranken and play some games. When I switched I reached in my first season with 100% standard decks rank 15 and decidd soon that I wanted to stay.
---
Magic Arena is pretty neat. 
---
You‚Äôre in luck, odd dragon warrior is a thing and features a few mechs as well. It‚Äôs a solid deck and I‚Äôve done well with it on the ladder since crafting it in December. As a bonus, only 1-2 cards will rotate out in April.
---
If I were to, I'd do paladin with the gargoyle, some weapons, the 4 mana dragon and the magnetize egg package
---
You cant sorry
---
Or i have a crazy idea. Do i abandon my account and create a new one? Mainly since new players get stuff real quick early on
---
Killermig#2967 EU
---
Looking to trade 80g quests.
---
Or add two tabs for pinned decks so we can have 18 deck slots
---
There was a time when i really need someone to complete quest so i added everyone i was playing with, i deleted the ones that don't play for like 2 weeks so the remaining ones are my "friends" now
---
I don't accept friend request unless i'm too bored, the only exception 
---
&gt; majority of the **non/low paying player base for an extreme minority of **big spending** people.
---
The game can only support F2P because of it's dedication to it's paying playerbase...the people playing for W-L records, not single player content they can stroll through leisurely.
---
And I'm saying this as a very small spender, myself.
---
Honestly I donÀãt think you would like it. If you stay in standard you can at east use dust from old now useless cards/cards that never saw play. A new account needs to unlock EVERYTHING and grind a lot more to get to that point.
---
I didn't find the option in my launcher? Is it normal? I'm playing on a mac.
---
Seems good. Can i add you?
---
Cool. Also think it would be cute if resurrect also summoned a 0/1 Sleepy Sheep or something 
---
Yes, but Abrade was also released prior to the initial stress test beta for the game.
---
Yeah sorry mac sucks as a built in rule it's not there
---
Everything is a lie.
---
Minimal upkeep, maximum profit is Activision's stance on everything. They are as greedy as it gets and are a detriment to mainstream gaming's technological advancement. 
---
The community is mad right now, and every call for even the mildest optimism is met with vitriol. It's a bit sad.
---
Thanks. I will look into it
---
Well I‚Äôm speaking from their point of view (sad, but it‚Äôs reality).
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you; was a whale for a while, but didn‚Äôt preorder Rastakhan or Boomsday. It‚Äôs hard to quit after all that investment.
---
If the mass rotation doesn‚Äôt shake the meta up, I‚Äôm done with this game for good.
---
Totally broken.  The only solution blizz devs can come up wth  is to nerf Malygos.
---
The question is: What deck *wouldn't* run this card? It opens an enormous pool of cards creating countless broken combos. There is no drawback. You put this in your deck, and whatever weakness your class card pool has‚Äìhealing, card draw, board presence‚Äìyou can now compensate for however you want.
---
This would fundamentally break the entire game I think. I don't see it happening... I don't think you realise how strong an elemental Mage/Priest deck would be. Or a Warrior/Rogue pirate deck.
---
Broken in Even Paladin.
---
Are you serious? This totally broken in Hearthstone, think just Radiant Elemental + Unstable Evolution.
---
Amazing
---
No these guys have it all wrong, it's one mally, 2 spells but the first spell is casting twice off electra. So its 10+10+10 
---
üòÄ
---
I played cho, took her spells, used her cards against her, and milled her once. It was epic.
---
i did that too recently but it ended up barely mattering when your hand is empty. playing over-statted minions but ending turns with 7 mana is not amazing.
---
You get a n'zoth
---
I think it's way more than that.
---
Nzoth
---
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There‚Äôs still plenty of meat on that crow. Now you take this home, throw it in a pot, add Toki, Time Tinker, a few weaponized pinatas. Baby, you‚Äôve got a stew going.
---
Another N'Zoth. Floop completely becomes a 3/4 copy of whatever he transforms into.
---
Lot of hunters for paladin to bully.
---
And hero power is insane. Make it a 2/2 body for 2 mana and reduce warrior armor from Baku to 3. Card may be less oppressive. 
---
Zola targets the minion on the board, so you would get whatever Floop turned into.
---
I think a great way to do it would be by paying a fee to enter the tournament (maybe 100?), which would make the reward for the first places, for the casual mode i mean.
---
That.... Couldn't be a more inaccurate interpretation of my comment.
---
I mean there are a priori arguments for both cases tbh so I can't blame you for not wanting to risk it.
---
We have probably ALL posted stupid stuff we regret.  I know I have.
---
It's past time to move on.
---
Assuming they're low on cards it should be easy to do over two turns as they may not have the removal for it when it's still on your side.
---
They did not cancel it. "Indefinite hiatus" or "on hold" with a statement of "revisit it later" is not a cancelation. But a "we will work on it in the future" 
---
If they actually do it us another thing but they never said there will be no tournament mode. 
---
Well the sound of written language is not quite universal i guess it wasn't meant that way. Sorry
---
I am pretty sure the bots always hero power if they can't do anything else with their mana.
---
I've seen a rogue who, at 7 mana, cast [[assassin's blade]] and then hero powered into a minion which then gave me lethal next turn.
---

5/3/4

community/reddit as a whole no , not at all anything that  beat them or plays card or is any good at all is unfair (ive seen people want swipe nerfed to 4mana deal 3 and no extra 1dmg aoe for example) ive seen pretty much evry played card and even unplayed hated on.
---
on indivudual bases  alot of decks are fair more, but as a whole no community(some part atleast) whines and complains about evry card that has seen play. im sure back in day i saw few complaints about illida(the current one) being to strong.
---
Announcing hearthstone amateurs 
---
If it is coming or not is another question from what their official statement was. 
---
And they said the mode was done but they canceled this aproach because it diverted strongly from community expectatoins. 
---
If they do it they will start from scratch.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even shadow visions that‚Äôs driving the combo. It‚Äôs the 2/14 ogre and all the Rez spells. I only even pick divine spirit some of the time when I see it. 
---
Am I the only one who doesn't care about more deck slots? I never even use the first nine, let alone all 18.
---
Antonidas is a key piece in Exodia OTK Mage if you want to look up that one.
---
I‚Äôve never seen curio played. 
---
Thats right. It existed before 2005 but still many custom maps were still playing, Enfo, Hero Line, Angel Arena, Tower Wars, i still have that maps on my old HDD. Dota didnt dominated all custom map meta yet. I remember i played it in highschool 2004, i saw that "Dota" custom map for a long time but i took months until i try it.
---
 5.84 was a very preferred version, some people was still pushing and playing 5.84 even when 6.20 was out. Some group of people refused to play new versions and just kept playing for a really long time 5.84, that was stupid imo. On 5.84 some map points was different. scourge had more advantage. Riki had death ward (witch doctor wasnt exist that time), medusa had purge, multi shot was ultimate and u dont even get damage reduction, u just keep hitting 3-4 targets aa it was crazy. Faceless Void had a global stun (2 secs i think) i keep remembering all of them as i write lol. Good times
---
you can be angy but still make a good post explaining things, that has a way betetr chance of getting something out of it and opening discussion then X is op, blizz bad,  X is only played by   horrible people that kind of stuff helps no one at all. 
---
Like on wow forum before/around bfa launch i saw alot about Alliance vs horde, but not ingame but people actully going to far with it.  Like actully going about how all horde/Alliance are maniacs irl. Like its fine to hate the faction ingame but is no need to bring it to irl stuff that goes to far.(and even if was for most part true which it isnt people still have alot of different reasons why they play X faction or in hs x cards/decks)
---
This is the first I'm hearing of the specialist mode, and I think it sounds brilliant. It would be annoying to have to wait for an opponent to pick through their sideboard if that were a game mode. Plus it maintains parity with other constructed play so we wouldn't need two new ladders.
---
Yeti doesnt count! Your living a lie!!!!
---
100% agree on that! 
---
those kind of posts help litterly no one, wont bring actual( good) discussions, wont get notice from blizz or devs and will change aboslutly nothing.
---
I add people to ask if my Harbinger Celestia put them in a tough position
---
Could I interest you in my proposed Baku nerf?
---
Deep 
---
Ah, the old "You're using it wrong". 
---
I don't think Brawlisseum is a satisfying replacement for "tournament mode".  How is Brawlisseum different from ladder?  A few ways:
---
1) Worse MMR system.  Every run, the game has to pin down your MMR again based on your number of wins.  For a good player with a good deck who doesn't get unlucky, the first 6 wins would be relative cakewalks.
---
2) More streaky.  No good player wins 85% of their games (12-2 record).  You inherently have to get lucky to do well.  It isn't possible to "skill" your way to 12 wins.  Good players will do better, of course, but 12 wins will always rely on luck, which is a little unsatisfying.
---
3) It has an exit point where you have to start over.  This isn't a problem, it would be a facet of any tournament mode.  It's just a difference.
---
4) Limited to one decklist.  So if you want to play something new, you have to cancel your run.  IMO, this makes a 14-round tournament less appealing.  I'd rather see something like 8man tournaments, which have 3 rounds.  Even for the Bo1 Brawlisseums, I don't think most people finished a run in one sitting, and for Bo3 it would take multiple play sessions just to get done with one tournament.
---
To me, Brawlisseum is just "ladder with worse MMR but you have to get lucky".  I know it's the lowest-hanging fruit for team5 as far as tournament mode goes, but I hope it's not the option they choose.
---
I highly doubt they care 
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** k3ndeezy! ^(hug)
---
I like your ideas. Also, I would like some more game modes than just ladder (standard/wild) and arena. For instance, what about an alternative, more chaotic ladder that allows you to play only cards from 3 sets that are NOT in standard right now (like in one of the recent tavern brawls)? With that, they would be able to keep the game fresh and more interesting for more casual players between expansions.
---
Agreed; certainly looks like that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs doing. Funny how the shrine takes that healing effect and then like runs it thought the hero power again so that it can get doubled a second time, meh interesting interaction 
---
forgot what sub I was on for a second
---
Matt1sSVK#1145 EU
---
Can show, you go first.
---
I'm clearly not great at dungeon run
---
Is that still not fixed? 
---
Everyone seems to think that activating a new game mode like this is like flipping a switch, but it would have to involve changes to the actual game engine (multiple platforms plus server software), which would require resources outside of the normal dev teams whose job is to add content.
---
Professional software development is expensive with lots of hidden costs. You might think that at a large company, it should be easier to get something like this pushed through, but it's really the opposite since budgets tend to get more closely scrutinized and nitpicked, while separation of duties rules prevent employees from working outside their specialty to get things done faster.
---
Back to the point, if they were going to go to the trouble of adding this to the game, it wouldn't make sense to do it just for legend players that make up a tiny fraction of the player base.
---
WoW has all the progression you desire and is fading like a dim light.
---
However you are right on basic functions the game should have. Here are a few that people don't bring up
---
- There's no fucking Tutorial to replay. Why is that important? Well, let's say I have a friend and i wanna show him real quick the tutorial without having him to make an account. This happened to me in real life. I showed him a normal match and couldn't quickly understand what was exciting about it. The tutorial has better charm and character that I personally don't have.
---
- There's no way to quickly share and import deck code via in game chat on mobile. Whenever I do need to get a code on mobile, I need to open up the Blizzard App to manually copy the string from the chat, so the game can recognize it. And if i share a code, i need him/her to open the Blizzard App on his/her own to get the code. There should be a simpler way to do that in game without all this hassle. PC players have this simpler, but we don't.
---
Games hemorrhaging players because its stagnant AF. decides to do an update that only effects 0.01% of the community. are idiots in charge over there?
---
I don‚Äôt think most people don‚Äôt care about bo3 and would rather have more freedom of how long they need to play for.
---
If you like this kind of greed, check out Reno Jackson's taunt druid.
---
Is this game unplayable for newcomers? I've built a deck that won me couple games in ranked but when I got to rank 20 where I can lose stars, opponents just have so amazing cards that I get stomped ultra hard like 95% of my games. Am I just supposed to buy packs and hope I can start playing properly some day? I didt realize this was a pay to play game... :(( 
---
exactly. If you play ladder, you encounter broken stuff. So, you play broken stuff yourself and hope for the best. I was using a wall priest list today to get from rank 10 standard to rank 5 in 16 wins and merely 4 losses. 30% of opponents were "midrange" hunters.
---
Management bought Blizzard because it‚Äôs customer appeal is so high. Lots of people are devoted to Blizzard. Somewhere in the business plan, they have a slide about burning customer good will to fatten the next quarters earnings.  That‚Äôs the whole plan. Any company that has that much good will from their customers is ripe to be bought and exploited like this.  Why not monetize the good will by offering less value?
---
We‚Äôre all gonna play diablo immortal pocket pinball edition diablo paper doll houses or Warcraft 4 or Starcraft X MMORPG or whatever.  No matter how bad it is.  They don‚Äôt have to make the game any better than this because the business plan is to exploit our brand loyalty not give us old school blizzard quality.  
---
Insta-preorder
---
Pretty sure the "engaged" audience they're targeting recently is the one actually spending money.
---
This sub may only represent 1% or so of the player base but it's gotta be huge in terms of spending
---
Check out the link and it looks cool, forgive me but I could not see where to download the cards and such. I'm pretty useless when it comes to working these things out so if you could send me the link for the cards I will definetly try them out!!!
---
I dunno what everyone else is talking about, multiclass decks were the best part of the Halloween arena. Putting something like that in standard sounds beyond fun. Beyond broken too but beyond fun nonetheless. If you add a fun restriction to it it could be feasible enough to be added. Something like, "You can't have duplicates of any 2nd class cards" or "You can't have any 1st and 2nd class cards that are the same cost" or even "Your first class's cards must be even/odd and the 2nd class's cards must be the opposite".
---
Also, I just realized this but I don't think any of these cards on my list are rotating.
---
Deck codes made it kinda irrelevant for me.
---
By not printing the card lmai
---
I will admit I am completely blindfolded when it comes to tech/coding and the budget it takes.  
---
I was under the impression that they would have to introduce a client for the torunament format anyways, which would only involve 0.01% of the playerbase, under which logic it would be very much feasible to add said "Specialist-client" to the live server.  
---
If I am wrong though, i understand how this might be seen as a naive proposal. 
---
Why in God's name would you need an SSD to run a unity game efficiently
---
Sounds intriguing :D
---
I‚Äôm just hear to stare at the Alex Grey art.

There is still the entomb Anubarak bug iirc.

Social Justice Warrior alert
---
Expecting Blizzard to utilize a modicum of common sense when it comes to this game. If that were the case Hearthstone would already have a tournament mode, permanent Brawliseum, more formats, etc, etc. Its five years too late to start thinking they're going to make Hearthstone anymore than a closed-alpha mobile game.
---
You wouldn't/shouldn't. The game is poorly written, simple as that.
---
Yknow I was writing a response trying to rationalise how they must decide where to put their effort, and how spending time on doing these things doesn‚Äôt directly effect profit compared to just doing the bare minimum in making a new expansion every so often with a bit more pve content to just about hold onto people; but it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. These changes, amongst a few others like certain bug fixes, would be such low effort to implement its almost unbelievable that in both the long and short run these sorts of things wouldn‚Äôt boost the profit from the game greatly.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre just happy to let the game fade and move onto other projects, I don‚Äôt know much about how companies like blizzard function but this is the only thing I can think of that makes sense.
---
"I'm making so much money, why does everyone hate our games?" -some Activision exec probably.

They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
HDDs don‚Äôt run any modern games efficiently. Do you know why cellphones run games so well? It‚Äôs not because they have GTX1080s in em dude 
---
FFFFFFFFF
---
If you give me nine for each class, I probably don't need a wild/standard split
---
Funny thing is when Ben Thompsons team was working on the infamous tournament mode even they didn't consult their esports department. And now a lot of them got fired.
---
so increase malygos to 11 mana?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt run anything off a HDD any more. You can run modern things off a HDD and complain about bad performance any longer. It makes the biggest difference in legitimately any application.
---
Same
---
It‚Äôs a different solution to the repetitiveness of ladder currently than just saying get better at making cards and balancing metas 
---
me too, that boss doesn't know what to do without the quest lol
---
You're in luck.
---
That's what they're focusing on according to their first and last ["in the works"](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22483774)
