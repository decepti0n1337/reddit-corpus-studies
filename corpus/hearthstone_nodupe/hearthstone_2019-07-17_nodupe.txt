This could be much better to a deck than pyro/equality.  You could clear your opponents board and buff your own by transforming all your totems/tokens/trash iinto murlocs that could end up being great or could get buffed by warleader next turn.   Is the card combo to strong?  Probably not, but we'll have to see how it plays out because there IS potential for it to blow out a game

Windows10 has an uninstall option for it, but stand along exe files normally aren't seen in the control center to uninstall. It has to make changes to the reg because after I delete it and download another and start it just pops up with my old settings again. No logging in.
---
Just up the cost of Venomizer to 5 mana. It‚Äôs slows it down considerably but with Galavnzier is still possible.
---
Plus with the way the card is designed it‚Äôs essentially the same as Assassinate or Vile Brood Skitterer.
---
&gt; Is it just me or do the spoilers seem extremely slow for this expansion. I remember for ROS they were releasing good chunks everday, but for this, I maybe see 1 oe 2 cards every few days it is kind of frustrating haha.
---

---
It's exactly the same as EVERY exp before. Between announcement and reveal period, there is a time with only a few cards per day.    
---
&gt; Also, Shaman has like half of its cards revealed while some classes like Hunter have none. What is up with that? I log on yesterday and see yet another shaman card (Plague of Murlocs) revealed, and there has been nothing else spoiled since!    
---
Same, this  happen with every exp where some class got more reveal than others. it balance over time.
---
If you conjurer an eight drop can you get Ragnaros the Firelord? Asking because it's not a playable card but it can be summoned through Jan'Alai.
---
I AM MURLOC! *Shreds
---
Cringe comment. Do you have a Brain?
---
Ok :). It just felt longer than usual haha! They should hopefully starting rolling in more spoilers soon :D.
---
it begins to roll much often starting friday/monday, don't worry.
---
What exactly is the great achievement to them? For pretty much all of them you either just got to rank 20, went to some event, bought a collector‚Äôs edition in a game, or played the game on a specific device.
---
The closest ones to achievements are the Legend cars back (which plenty of people are insistent just takes a meta deck and enough time), or the ones for heroic adventures (which I can personally say just takes a decent sized collection to do with how bad the AI is).
---
iirc u/toilet_drake_hs maintains that but he recently made a tft itemizer tool which just got completed so i'm sure he'll update that visual guide soon.
---
Say that to GMs PepeHands
---
shiet, i'd be stoked to watch hitler's card reaveal
---
Wonder if anyone has done this with the same deck in both standard and wild

Nice.

It is good to be da king.
---
Plenty of people do that lmao. Not everyone wants to stick around on it for too long at a time cause some quests can take a 3 to 4 games even if you try to stall them. I'll do like 20 to 30% of the annoying ones and leave it to double up the next day or even the day after. 
---
Anticipation for the new expansion also drives people to do their dailies and log out till they actually have time to spend playing.
---
I actually play Mech Paladin. That deck shreds Warrior
---
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
No one who doesn't play Warrior think Boom is "decently balanced".  
---
As for the rest of your argument you are basically advocating massive power creep throughout the game just to combat the likes of the overpowered dr. boom.  
---
What sort of power creep is going to address Dr. Boom exactly? Every class gets conjurers calling?  
---
It's pretty funny that the only cards that can help a deck deal with boom are in themselves quite broken too namely CC and Zuljin to name a couple.
---
Puzzle might be a little too easy because you would be able to group up all the different cardbacks together.
---
On the other hand maybe that's what would make it fun.  No agonizing hours lining up blades of grass in a picture of a meadow.  Just something quick and to the point.
---
inb4 2 millhouses
---
For those prices, I'd rather buy the puzzle, complete the puzzle, and laminate it rather than buy that mousepad.
---
I see it as a very minor issue.  I think only a tiny minority of players care about collecting cardbacks, and another tiny minority of players care about keeping the cardbacks exclusive.
---
Then you've got this enormous pool of casual players who have never been to this subreddit or any other Hearthstone forum, and don't care about any of that cardback stuff one way or the other.
---
Because I'm poor af in dust
---
I dont care about cardbacks in general. I just have the random cardback on. Even before that when a new monthly cardback came out I forgot about it 5-6 games later. I don't get how people are so obsessed and derive pleasure from others not having things. Especially when its something that took no effort. If they started giving out legend/heroic/preorder cardbacks then I would get the frustration. Because those either cost something or took effort. But its pathetic to whine about monthly cardbacks. I wonder how many of those people actually use all their cardbacks.
---
I see, it depends if you have the rest of the warrior cards. If you do, definitely. If not then you probably shouldn‚Äôt
---
I think it's not unreasonable to exclude Innkeeper, though. That's a bit TOO easy to do, imo.
---
"Why so confrontational it's just a helpful tip" literally said moments after confronting a helpful tip. Go fuck yourself buddy. Clearly you don't have better things to do or you wouldn't have replied in the first place. What a farce.
---
Harrison Jones is a great card, and he has the potential to completely blow-out a game that he‚Äôs worth keeping as a golden. Awesome!
---
Define better
---
nice
---
If you really think he is not going to play fresh expansion then you underestimate how much he loves money.
---
Nice
---
I typically play control actually, but nice ad hominem that in no way disproves my argument regardless. 
---
Blizzard has, for YEARS, nerfed cards that cheat out gigantic stats too early. There is absolutely no excuse for a card to exist that allows for multiple 7/8 taunt minions as early as turn 5 or 6. Almost no class can deal with it effectively, and decks that play solitaire are always dealt with because it makes the game completely un-fun. Mage either draws the nuts or doesn‚Äôt. That style almost always gets nerfed regardless of win rate. They DESTROYED Corridor Creeper and neutered Spiteful Summoner because both cards made for absurd boards way too early. 
---
And as someone who frankly has a soft spot for giants, I‚Äôd rather see Conjurer‚Äôs Calling nerfed instead of Mountain Giant.
---
Also blizzard has toast every day for breakfast. So its either give him one or admit that they murdering his people.
---
üÖ±Ô∏èarnes, king of 2 goons at a time

In addition to the other posters, check out the various drafting helper sites. The Lightforge is a really good one (http://thelightforge.com/TierList)
---
‚ÄúSame time‚Äù is nobody noticing the obvious 170 win difference? This is so obviously faked it‚Äôs not even funny
---
Agreed. I've been playing since the beta, and I couldn't care less if some player in 2019 gets the cardbacks I got back in 2014.
---
I've seen it time and time again that a vocal segment of the playerbase is anti-anything that doesn't directly benefit themselves.
---
There are several levels to this joke and I really appreciate it.
---
Because those people are paid and under contract.
---
Sometimes I'll notice a particularly flashy new cardback if it's something I've never seen before. But yeah, 99.9% of the time I couldn't tell you which cardback my last opponent was using. I think I've changed my own cardback 2 or 3 times ever. I have no idea what it's currently on, despite the fact that I've probably been using it since 2017.

IT'S THE ONLY OTHER MINION IN MY DECK
---
&gt;long while
---
It's been /barely/ one month since he stopped streaming Hearthstone.
---
Truth is, it's something we want to do, but having to manually keep track of it is less incentive, and having a visible achievement is more incentive. Combined, the effect really is significant
---
Purple won playing what ? Also almost no one got warrior because the rock paper scissor style now ( mage - warrior - rogue) and made a gamble toward that. Being mage the safest pick nowadays.
---
That priest did 292 damage in one turn!
---
Warrior isn't even tier 1...
---
That's why he literally bashes hearthstone at least once a steam now. I've heard him say he would quit streaming if he had to stream hearthstone as much as he chooses to stream tft
---
Kripp feels more real to me than other streamers. Other streamers feel like cam girls sometimes but Kripp feels like your bro your chilling with. Makes it easy to watch whatever he's playing. Even if its TFT
---
The sequel to dota
---
Some players still want to get old packs with gold
---
A priest that can‚Äôt survive a burst of damage complaining? Who has the trash deck???
---
With all things, as things grow old the maintenance goes up. This is the answer no one who invested a ton already in something (Blizzard here) wants to hear. There's only so much they will deem worth it vs a new endeavour
---
Exactly

$6 you can create your own [here] (http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/large-mousepad-160), couldn't find the exact photo they used but /r/gelfius made some [cool] (https://i.imgur.com/mcJNpve.jpg) [wallpapers] (http://i.imgur.com/FxdIzfz.png)

Sounds "fun"...
---
You're attempting to assign value to people based on the deck they play in a mobile game.

No, you have no life left

Making Grave Horrors cost 11 would buff priest and nerf mage all at once.

Copy and Paste the above into a Google Search, the Fandral Staghelm prediction appears to have been made on April 14th, 2016.
---
https://www.reddit.com/comments/49dwz9
---
In the above Whispers of the Old Gods Pre-Release Chart card reveal order, Fandral Staghelm was revealed on April 21st, 2016.
---
Yeah but the flip side of that is that there are millions of people who have already decided they don't like League, or who used to play it but swore off it, or similar.
---
They weren't a problem.  There were no crazy and oppressive giant decks floating around until CC came along.   
---
They were strong but they weren't over the top like they can be now as a result of CC.  
---
The ONLY reason people are defending CC is they want to keep the easy cheating mechanic in their deck.
---
I'll assume that you're a new'ish player without much resources (gold/dust)... I really wouldn't want to craft Brightwing. 
---
It's not even close to be one of the best legendaries in the game, and if you're building your collection, there surely is much better things to craft.
---
In the end that's your choice though, of course.
---
As for your question: Yes, you can always safely DE your golden legendaries;
---
The worst case scenario is that you change your mind and recraft a normal version later on, and you lost nothing but the "golden" animation.
---
Seriously I can‚Äôt be the only person to hear that
---
It's the consistency at 12 mana that makes Mountain Giant in particular problematic. It will either be a big minion or a slightly less big minion with taunt. Doing the same on bouncer might get you 2 giggling inventor. Sea giant can't come down and get khadgar/callinged unless your opponent already has a full board, or it's already later in the game.
---
I suggest giving the deck a shot because it really is one of the higher skill ceiling decks in standard right now.
---
YOU SEE IT'S VERY SIMPLE
---
Mecha'thun was played a lot in previous expansions, but the thing is that at the moment, about 70-80% of the meta is aggro/tempo.
---
Tough to play a combo deck against that meta.
---
I wouldn't craft that for a PVE fight, unless you're drowning in gold/dust.
---
His point was that warrior is boring to watch so nobody wants to watch the streams, so I was just pointing out that warrior wasn't a big part of the last tournament.
---
Because people are assholes.  
---
Toast is all good.
---
He plays other games sometimes.
---
blizzard's biggest regret
---
It's on my to do list after 500 with Shaman ... then there is Warrior and no way I'm playing Warrior in it's current state.
---
Why is this post even a thing?  Is a person not allowed to play other games during the hearthstone content lull?

Autochess is a game where you build a team of characters and they fight against another team.  You decide where they go on the board, but they automatically fight.
---
The genre naturally has high RNG and its an important part of the process.  The genre rewards flexibility and recognizing opportunities.   You could be planning to go X build, but the items and champions you are being offered pushes you towards Y build, so you take that and figure out how to transition.
---
Its like a deck building game.
---
You know why I know that he hasn't played Hearthstone for a while? Because I'm still subscribed to him on youtube, as will many other hearthstone players.
---
I knew you had my back.
---
This is peak hearthstone content right here, no other post can top this.
---
You can get legend also as a f2p, if you manage your collection right you can make a few 5k-10k dust decks each expansion
---
I am not on a crusade. I was asking a question(which was answered but definitely not thanks to you). You came in here pointing fingers at me for "crucifying" Toast and being "on a crusade against him." I'm not. To be frank, I couldn't care less, but I was just curious.
---
Also, yeah. I am discounting  his years of Hearthstone for this argument we're having. Because people go on Twitch to watch games played now not in the past. And the past VODs they might watch are closer to the present. Not in the past. And they are the biggest target audience. Your rhetorical statement doesn't invalidate my point above, and is nothing but stupid. 
---
Look, I am not saying Toast did huge for the game in the past. But we live in the present.
---
Also, you should try being more chill when  having an argument. Pointless rhetorisms and finger pointing will accomplish nothing.
---
Yes, but these hearthstone players will still play hearthstone despite him getting a card reveal or not
---
All blizzard has been really doing is releasing more of the same card expansions. Hearthstone has to change a lot more to get streamers who left the game indefinitely and players like me who lost lost interest in playing, back into hearthstone.
---
It would be interesting if someone would calculate the chance of getting 4 12 mana minion on turn 5. The mulligan, and the fact that you have two copies of MG and CC in deck makes it hard for me to calculate, as im not really great in combinatorics.
---
It's really hard to tell who smorced who in this kind of scenario.

thank you for taking the compliment while also defending a fellow artist - people are quick to dismiss art as 'good' or 'ugly' without taking into consideration all the technicalities that go on behind the scene. a lot of the times artist is drawing what he was told to, not what he would like to draw and it affects the final product.

Furthermore if you follow the legend meta there are far less decks being played and warrior is popular and mage is about the only true hard counter to warrior.

Slightly bullshit, considering kripp and trump, as well as toast do have a card reveal. Meanwhile somewhat smaller (but definitely growing) streamers like slysssa don't have a reveal.

Can you make it so that the Days wheel's "max comparison" is 15 days? It shows "13" days (last card) as a small section of the 'pizza', almost any difference from the 1 day ones. Just a QoL suggestion. I use Excel too much so these small things always catch my eye lol.

&gt;The idea that Sargeras and N'Zoth are working to the same end goal is basically impossible from what we know: Sargeras wanted Azeroth to help his Burning Crusade, which is to wipe out all life in the universe so the Void Lords can't take over.

You should refresh your lore, that's no longer accurate.

Volume I of the Chronicles mate. Where are you getting your lore from?

You're guaranteed to open a legendary within the first ten packs of any set you haven't opened yet, so I'd buy individual packs of a set until you get the legendary then move onto the next until you have them all.
---
I think they like to have some emotion behind the card reveals.
---
I'm 100% sure that it is not exclusively because of prime day though that might have affected the frequency (we have had 2 offers in less than 48 hours). I have searched for anything that would indicate a schedule or pattern for these but haven't found anything yet. I saw a post here for a 25% or 20% deal around 10 days ago as well, so there are some non-zero chances of another deal before the pre-order expires.

I've been saying for a while I think she'd be a great pick to do the live stream. She's a great on-screen personality and she's proven herself to be a strong player. It'd score points for diversity too as to my memory live streams up until now have been all male streamers.

Yes and you shouldn't magnetize a wargear on the same turn anyway, especially in real games. If you want to push face, then it can do that just fine after the surviving mechs are ready to attack.

Blizzard this is an outrage; this man is one of the most active members of the rank 20 community, and I am offended that he is getting passed up to show off the new legendary being added for the Zero Damage Priest archetype. Unless this is rectified, I will be cancelling my $140 pre-order and using that money to feed my children; I hope you're happy.
---
I get that quests aren't meant to be hardcore build-arounds (although the warlock quest begs to differ), but what deck would you want to run where you want to work towards giving your minions divine shield? A deck with bigger minions? Control with late game taunts? A token pally deck, what's the win con in that? Even if you don't build your deck around the quest, you still have to run some of those pally minions they showed and at least 2 of the cards they showed are terrible unless you're building your deck around getting a quest reward quickly. The 3 drop that tutors could be played in many decks tho.
---
Yes.  We got 3 cards so far: Plague of Madness (Rogue), Psychopomp (Priest) and Plague of Murlocs (Shaman)
---
Just a heads up, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcue,‚Äù but fantastic post anyways :)

One would wonder, why would they remove this? isn't it much more fun, interesting and takes more effort to make that the thousand "i am a dad that plays since beta while in the shitter and i have just reached rank 18 and have nobody to share it" posts? and the answer is that mods are a race of \[redacted\]
---
i¬¥ve came back after months in Magic Arena and i must say,  the emotes and BM are more prominent in HS.
---
I'm not actually too sure about reno mages Position in wild, but it's not a tier 1 or 2 deck.
---
A fringe inclusion in a tier 3 deck is likely not a good card. 
---
8 mana for a 5/5 with an "okay" effect is just really bad.
---
[r/hearthstonecirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/)
---
I mean, I never said it would be a powerful card. It's a prediction. It's what I think the card will be, not what I think it should be.
---
so did he only say he loves him or do they trash talk the shit out of each other?
---
User name checks out. Fanboy detected.
---
Pretty sure one of the designers said in the ama that it wouldn‚Äôt get added to single player but there‚Äôs a good chance it will pop up in the future as a tavern brawl.
---
He's not caving, it just shows he has morals and integrity.  He doesn't even stream HS much anymore, and Thijs would be much more deserving of the honor, so he passed it along to his friend.
---
These posts belong on /r/hearthstonecirclejerk not here

are you beind sacastic with the title?
---
Ooof
---
You can talk to opponents?
---
Who cares?
---
Genuine question, why are you  in the Hearthstone subreddit?
---
This. I mean Thijs.
---
According to this place, nope. And apparently it's easy to hate on Toast.
---
How would thjis have not got a card?  Is there only 1 card??
---
Tutant Meenage Neetle Teetles
---
What part of any of this has to do with a crybaby? Toast could‚Äôve revealed a card to milk views, but he doesn‚Äôt even like HS anymore, so he returned the card. Are you calling our community a crybaby or disguised toast a crybaby anyways?  What was the point of your comment?
---
I really respect Toast a little more because of this decision.
---
Well played Toast.
---
&gt; is the counter just carrying over?
---
it is. they did the first 3 reveals based on last week's runs &amp; it's believed they'll do the Legendary reveal later today
---
I lost once to Geddon, but I also took 15 damage from his hero power as Priest because of how bad my curve was.
---
It's literally the same brawl but with one extra character. They didn't even reset the timed rewards, so after your pack there's no reason at all to do it again. Real nice, blizzard.
---
Oh that's a shame. Cause I'm loving the strong hero powers and would've enjoyed these mechanics to be more fleshed out.
---
This is spot on, I followed quite a few streamers that started out as YouTubers, they all no longer make YouTube content, all with the same reasons.
---

---
People will say you are throwing a fit but you do you, hope you will continue to stream new HS content.
---
Good grief imagine if he starts with Hand of Rafaam, fucking ez game boys
---
Because I like the card playing part - I just can't stand the building part.
---
From the [Blizzard Press kit](https://blizzard.gamespress.com/Saviors-of-Uldum-Press-Kit)
---
there's also some art of brann and Elise that look like cards.
---
&gt; I absolutely think he should be changed to having rush.
---
But why? He's literally a tier 1 card already without it.
---
That is, unless the content quality is so off the charts in their reveal that they get a lot of praise for it. Like the guy that does the "Real Life Hearthstone" reveals.
---
There are 7 total in the quest chain, and each quest in the chain was only revealed after a day.
---
If you completed all 7 then the legendary quest chain is over.
---
this card needs a [[witching hour]] kind of card to be viable
---
ffam*
---
With Riot's design philosophy towards multiplayer games, I really doubt it. They change a lot of stuff (questionably sometimes) to keep the game new.
---
Hah really? Do you have a link to a particular twitch video?

I picked Hagatha, picked minion that gains +1/+1 in hand every turn and gets drawn at the start of the game, early on I turned all the minions in my deck into it, so I always had evolve targets, or even better yet at time I just had overwhelming board of creatures coming down

Got it, thanks

6/6/5 Dragon | Deathrattle: Add a random Dragon to your hand.  
---
thx
---
I know...
---
I'm also unsure if the Golden Bronze Herald or Recurring Villain will be available if you missed them last week.
---
However the speed run description still exists so I erred on the side of Blizzard being generous.
---
GOLDEN WISP
---
Rafaam's HP is too good, period. Most of the boss decks have little filler, so chances are you'll get something good. If it's a minion (and you remember to leave board space) it comes to your side right away -- the 10/2 taunt that one guy has is noice.
---
And it's not just "you get this", it's "the boss DOESN'T". Pretty sweet if you get something key like Garr's "summon 3 more Firesworn 0/5s)
---
His name is a fucking Hearthstone reference.
---
I can't see that not biting him in the ass.
---
Blizzard store merch always has huge sales in nov and spring. 
---
There‚Äôs also 20-25% off codes you can buy on eBay.
---
His streams in the past month have had zero livestream highlight content. The hate for switching games is not at all justified, and just attests the real maturity of this community.
---
Right? People keep saying he‚Äôs classy or that this a good response from him. The truth is he probably just doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about revealing a card.
---
Wheres the picture version?
---
That's true - but then it's not because of the reveal, but because of great content. The guy who does "Real Life Hearthstone" stuff would get a lot of attention no matter if it was a reveal or not, because it's amazing :)
---
Most sites won‚Äôt let you use copyrighted images
---
It has been going long enough that it is here to stay.
---
confirmed, I just did a new 55-minute run with Rafaam and did not get a second golden Bronze Herald
---
The second F died in the run. Press F to pay respects
---
I think that's fair... but TFT requires no deckbuilding at all. It's like playing that one adventure game mode HS had a while back. Don't knock it till you try it, right?
---
I REALLY enjoyed this and would love to see it stick around
---
Discord.gg/hearthstone
---
Well played, lol
---
It was mostly one thread against Toast and a few in favor of various streamers. It was clearly enough to make Toast give his card back
---
wouldn't fit the Brawl's overall narrative, which is "the League of Evil crashed into BRM".  the Explorer heroes are busy practicing their Flex-splosion technique &amp; otherwise prepping for Uldum
---
I'm sorry, who exactly is being an uber-despotic tyrant?
---
Toast quitting over this thread is quite sad for us and bad for Blizzard. It just gives him more reason not to go back on HS
---
I would love it if HS did a joke set like how Magic did with Unhinged.
---
Oh yea buddy. That's my bad. I officially apologize. See, I thought you were mad that you wouldn't get a reward. Reading comprehension fail = me. 
---
What you're actually mad about is you only a reward the very first time you play through... just like literally every single week the game mode has existed. Huh, that somehow makes it dumber.
---
Same thing here. Stuck on last Brawl when I left it at the 4th Boss.
---
When I click Play, the game looses connection and gives that ‚ÄúReconnect‚Äù pop-up.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried on desktop yet, that might be a potential solution.
---
The changes are cosmetic. They retire this card and then add another that's basically the same. The fundamentals of the game never change; tempo, OTK, combo, etc. It's been the same game for years and they just keep iterating on it to sell more packs. 
---
For people who have only been playing for a year or two it's probably still very interesting but dog has been playing forever. I'm amazed he lasted as long as he did. It was probably even worse for Hafu since she played arena and that doesn't change at all. She dominated arena years ago and then, nothing. No changes, no challenge. I'm amazed she played as long as *she* did. And then I'm both surprised and disappointed that Kripp is still at it. Ya gotta pay the bills I guess but c'mon, PoE has never been more awesome, regularly beats HS in viewer numbers (with the league over a month old even).  wtf, Kripp?
---
Anyways, I'm glad dog was able to transition. I'm glad toast transitioned as well. Being a variety streamer is so much more stable than being tied to one game. HS viewership has fallen off a cliff. If you were stuck tied to HS there goes your income.
---
Question is what if you faced a priest and the priest silenced it? Would it still be a 30/30?
---
yeah? rafam seems to be Warlock and the Rogue theif package, makes sense as he kinda steals things
---
pikachu.jpg
---
You‚Äôre implying they shouldn‚Äôt be bored with the game and that they should be content with the recent updates. ‚Äú what more do they want‚Äù
---
Brawl incoming
---
Get help.
---
It‚Äôs brilliant marketing. His fans become even more diehard, gets e-integrity, exposure. Big brain moves.
---
Yea. Vaelastrasz practically beats itself since the hero power lets him go into fatigue before you do. Plus a lot of the opponents are chock full of minions which are absurdly unbalanced at 2 mana.
---
&gt; Huh, that somehow makes it dumber. 
---
The idea that you come out of nowhere to pick fights with people on the internet and bully them and talk about "righteous indignation" is hilarious. Your fedora is showing.   
---
It's a lazy brawl. It's the same thing as last weak, with less rewards than last week. Defending this makes you an idiot.
---
Advent teaming up with E.V.I.L. would be something I would pay top money to see.
---
seems pretty easy to do, like literally 1 sentence to prove you're right. but yes im delusional for responding to a comment claiming something and then that person not willing to back it up with any evidence at all hahaha just google it 4head. thanks for being unintentially hilarious
---
They already kinda are, people farm karma and sell the accounts, or buy upvotes for extra visibility on their post. Stuff like this has been a thing for a while, see: Unidan.
---
It‚Äôs not just that. Look at the other post about toast and you will see why
---
I was also printed before Mountain Giant was made into an Elemental
---
This is the actual card art. It can be seen in the Plage of Murlocs preview, as well as Blizzards press kit for the Expansion.
---
Magma Rager has synergy with 1 health effects such as the new Paladin 3 drop and Steward of Darkshire
---
Well, I'm pretty sure they (and me) thought the implication was that you beat it once last week, so there's no reason to do it again this week. That's what caused the confusion
---
Wins in casual do not count towards the 500 win goal so your wins are not shown if you have it selected.  Plus when you reach 500 wins it still shows your wins past 500 (this was a change made some time ago.)  And no the right one is not "acting gold." The hero power would have a more gold colored border if he had 500 wins on the class.
---
Believe what you want. These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's "institutionalized."
---
I‚Äôm sorry it was auto correct! It framed me!
---
How would the other classes even be represented? League of Explorers? Nah that's reserved for SoU. It's called the Fire Fest-EVIL after all.
---
I like the idea too.  though I wonder how fast The One True Deck will emerge ... like maybe, the first 12 hours?  or if we'll get some kind of rock-paper/scissors action among 3 or 4 good decks
---
Ok, thanks for the explanation!
---
Welp so much for my 88 hour run well played
---

If it doesn‚Äôt apply to you, you shouldn‚Äôt feel attacked lmfao
---
&gt;after beating it once there's no reason at all to do it again.
---
A lot of the hate is from when his stream became increasingly toxic a year or two ago. If anyone said anything that he disagreed with in the slightest, they would get perma-banned and this reddit hasn't forgiven nor forgotten.
---
That said, returning the card is a classy move that he never should have felt he needed to do, but I respect it.
---
Great clip, needed to be cut shorter
---
What do the 2 elixir passive abilities do? I remember one is the draw cards + no fatigue
---
Exactly I see like 1 comment that explicitly insulting Toast. Few others are snarky comments referring to the 100% win-rate incident. Others are just discussing Blizzard‚Äôs decision. Toast probably just don‚Äôt want his name to be at the center of controversy in Reddit.
---
yes, it transforms into a different textless minion so silence wouldn't do anything
---
I think it moreso has to deal with they like what Hearthstone could be if Blizzard would just fix the issues that have been around for years. It feels like the game has been in maintenance mode for years.
---
To be fair to him, I also dislike Toast, but you‚Äôre correct as well.
---
&gt; just look at some people reactions when they gifted the Ragnaross card
---
"My cardback is now less special because people who wanted it and didn't have a chance to have it"
---
Sorry, some guy commented on my country's fb group that they gave Heroic Naxx. But I cant find any other source, it seems to be that he was joking/mistaken
---
I've always said the people here are salty as fuck. I get downvoted every time I do, but it's true. Even amongst gaming subs this is one of the more toxic one I've seen. Well at least we're not mtg level of bitching about a professional player all day and then act all shocked that he commited suicide.
---
Bag of coins is definitely my favorite OP card from any of the decks
---
Good thing blizzard doesn‚Äôt do shit about those reports and you‚Äôre wasting your time
---
However "Beat all 8 bosses using Arch-Villain Rafaam to earn a Golden Rafaam‚Äôs Scheme card". Now I just got to find a use for Rafaam's Scheme.
---
Sounds like he's just making a suggestion.
---
Not *everything* is bitching, stop being hypersensitive.
---
Guess I'm busting out the Quest Warrior in wild
---
I'd assume that's who they named him after
---
Omega Agent was an Omega 4/5 that costed more than 4 Mana. My initial suggestion was always to have Devastator at 5 Mana. I don't like it being a (Mech) Chillwind Yeti in the worst case scenario.
---
Mark my words, Devastator's popularity will go WAY down once Boomsday rotates out.
---
Hmm maybe, just maybe, because it's overpowered? Dunno dude, I think it's important to whine vocal so they can see our thoughts.
---
Glad I'm not the only one!
---
Unexciting, but might seen play if there are good taunts.
---
This isn't a game problem, this is a Twitch/streamer problem. If you build a community &amp; make people watch you for your personality, they'll stick around through anything. If you're just a good player but kinda bland, they'll move on to another channel the moment you switch games.
---
__UNITY, PRECISION, PERFECTION.__
---
Correct.Warrior seems oppresive so Im just thinking of ways to balance it a bit but also maintaining its strengths as it keeps a lot of other decks in check
---
no shit, i meant like a community made one that was sort of lfg
---
Is that really true? Then how are some streamers more popular than others?
---
What are peoples complaints about? I don't get why it matters
---
I‚Äôm absolutely positive this wasnt just an obvious PR stunt to drive traffic to Toast‚Äôs twitch stream. Nope! 
---
I mean, most people would simply turn down the offer and move on, but it sure was cool of Toast to let everyone know about it and make sure that he was the focus of the attention over the poor person who now has to do the reveal instead. 
---
Man! What a guy! &lt;3
---
This isn't even "whine." Dude said it looks way too strong, compared it to other cards. Then they made a suggestion for what they thought was an acceptable nerf.
---
I don't agree necessarily with the cards they compared Devastator to (they don't really see play), but the logic is there and they're raising points of discussion.
---
This isn't the same "Fuck you if you play X" or "I can't believe Y is allowed to exist" thread that you get every day.
---
Sounds like a Pok√©mon name.
---
So multiple things here.
---
1. Words mean things. If he didn't mean me, he would have specified it was only part of the subreddit. But no. He generalized everyone.
---
2. Subsequently, it's not just about what I think. Have you not seen how often people talk about "toxic fanbases" or "bad communities" or "subreddits going downhill"? Have you not seen the people who say "Thank God we're not X fanbase"? It seems quite common for people to lump entire communities together just based off a vocal minority of idiots. Saying "It doesn't apply to EVERYONE" doesn't change the fact that people sure seem to treat it that way.
---
3. People treat it like a legitimate thing. Why do you think people "apologize on behalf of the subreddit/community" for what happens? Why do you think people say "Why would Team 5 post here when they get chewed out for doing so"? That idea is literally contingent on the notion that Team 5 is going to be impacted by the actions of a few people, regardless of how many innocent people you are. And you can tell me the person who says that is dumb or incorrect but it's not an uncommon sentiment!
---
My overall point is, saying "If you're not named you shouldn't feel targeted" doesn't change how often I see people refer to an entire group and then act like the entire group is guilty or worthy of being treated badly. I've seen it so much over the past 4 or so years. I think I really noticed it starting with Undertale and that whole thing and it's only become more magnified for me.
---
People judge or reacts to others on a subreddit or in community off of the concerned notion that people outside that subreddit/community will judge them. Rational or not, it's still a concern they have.
---

No fair! You only won because you played the game and didn't skip your turn &gt;:(
---
Hey, free stuff. I like this free stuff, and Blizzard should do more of it!
---
SMDH.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs the fault of everyone who bitches about literally anything Blizzard does, even if they‚Äôre actually just the vocal minority.
---
Shouldn't that guy be blaming the subreddit mods, then, for letting so many people bitching "about literally anything Blizzard does"? If it were against the rules to do so, those posts could be reported and their quantity would decrease.
---
Well good for you some people do
---
Worked for me.  Shows as back up until 5pm pacific today.  Bought both preorders and got my 1950 coins back.
---
This is the only Golden I don't uncraft. Golden 0 Mana. The genesis card.
---
You do realize that you need to get to 10 mana for it to be "overpowered"? At that point basically every other class has some "overpowered" gimmick.
---
Mage can create a full board of 8/8s, 7/8 taunts or 4/12s for less than 10 mana. 
---
Druid and Shaman can deal 20+ damage with just 1 drops
---
Rogue can deal 20+ damage from an empty board
---
Paladin can deal 25 damage while being immune to any damage
---
Priest resurrected a full board of taunts for the 4th time probably...
---
A 4/5 that deals 10 damage to minions only is laughable compared to that.
---
But yeah. We get it. [WARRIOR = BAAAAAAAD](https://i.imgur.com/BHzRF0U.gifv)
---
Same
---
He sure is getting more attention from the HS community than he would have with just a reveal, and for a lot less work.
---
Very 'fair', could see play if Warrior gets some massive Taunt/Beast push. Worth mentioning it's pretty good in the Dimensional Ripper deck that wants specifically high-cost Taunt Beasts like Amani War Bear and Witchwood Grizzly for Oondasta synergy
---
Well this comment aged interestingly
---
It's really hard to accept that some people aren't fans of you but rather they are only fans of the game you play.
---
It's currently working (for me at least).
---
Dog, how'd they spell it wrong when it's literally spelled the right way on the top of the reward
---
He‚Äôs a goner, we lost him
---
Where do they track the total number of bosses killed by the community during the festival?
---
Bane is what I meant to say, yes. I get those two words mixed up ALL the time. It's my magnum opus.
---
It‚Äôs just a misspelling lol, I don‚Äôt give two Fs‚Äô about it.
---
Seems like it won't see play, in standard at least. Pretty disappointing for a legendary.
---
Too boring to play or stream, clearly
---
TIL
---
He wants to be a variety streamer. I get that, I'd hate playing the same game for 3 years nonstop too.
---
Variety streamers are a much harder sell than a dedicated game streamer. You have to be extremely likable (like Kibler level likable). Toast doesn't do that for me but I wish him the best at finding the right audience.
---
It makes a lot of sense if he wants to be a variety streamer that he's looking to shed a lot of the HS viewers. They're largely literal cancer and they ruin the chat and community experience for everyone.
---
wait what.....
---
why didnt BOTH get a card....
---
like i am totally out of HS recently but theres like 10 people that should get a reveal as a priority no matter what...and both thijs and toast would fit in that list. Thijs is like the guy who always streams HS from what i remember so it is disgusting to not give him a reveal..but at the same time....Toest is the ultimate memelord but also a guy who figures a lot of things out for the community.
---
like seriously if expansion had 3 cards...thijs and toast would be revealing 2 of those....
---
Bullied by r/Hearthstone
---
I think Omega Devastator is one of the best targets for nerfing. You can nerfs its stats or nerf its Mana Cost and it would still be playable. That alone says a lot.
---
It's not like, say, Warpath, where there's so little you can change about it without breaking the card. It costs 3 Mana? Wow, now it's insanely weak. It deals 0 damage? You just killed the card entirely.
---
You remove Echo? Now it's a worse Whirlwind.
---
Omega Devastator is an easy card to nerf. Your suggestion to make it 6 Mana sounds pretty severe to me, but honestly it would still see play. After all, you aim to play it on Turn 10 or later *anyway.*
---
I stand by what I said in my other comment. I'd like to hit Devastator *and* Mad Genius. Devastator at 5 Mana sounds more fair than at 4 Mana, and Mad Genius' Discover a Mech nerf is the "big hit" against the deck. Maybe it doesn't need to be hit *that* hard, but I think if the deck is too reliant on its one Hero Card, that alone spells a problem - especially in a Standard rotation where not every class has access to Hero Cards.
---
If people are going to be offended about him revealing a card then he should have the right to be offended by that
---
It's very straightforward, but if you get it on just 2 minions it's really good value. It's a threat that needs an immediate answer, and with that statline it won't be that easy to deal with. I'd run it.
---
You have a lot of personal feelings about me for someone who has never been forced to read his comments, read about him or hasn‚Äôt been a victim of any wrongdoing lol

Maybe a taunt quest as the fire plum hearth? If the reward is strong enough to create a archetype and create another possibility rather than only dr boom, I'm happy.
---
I finished a ‚ÄúWin as a warrior‚Äù quest by beating the first boss with Dr. Boom and the game kicked me back out to the main menu. I started up the tavern brawl and it had acted like I didn‚Äôt have a run going. I figure ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôll just play a game with Rafaam‚Äù and lo and behold, i kept the boom deck but got the Rafaam hero power.
---
well that could be a fun card if taunt warrior was still a real archetype

In the Amazon App (on android or emulator) under coins, on the ‚Äúearn‚Äù tab it will list the apps that are running coins back promos. Look for the yellow banner on app icons that say some percent coins back.
---
Yeah, I thought I was in easy mode when I dupla'd Grimmer Patron but he just kept board clearing even when I would have 4 of them on the board. 
---
I should have went with Elder.
---
Damn, Toast is sensitive
---
What were they thinking with that card, it was just bad in every single way, except the card art which was great!
---
Oh man, the chosen and EVIL could make a great sitcom. I have the feeling the hunter and dr boom could make a great duo.
---
We all knew control warrior would be in a good spot after rotation, and yet blizzard still gave them omega devastator. Also the new rush/reborn minion will easily replace militia commander in every deck.
---
I don‚Äôt think anything is stopping warrior from getting good cards lol.
---
Well Tempo Rogue has a positive win-rate against Mech Hunter. The reason is because Rogue is really good at keeping the opponent off the board with its combination of cheap removal and dagger. None of that really requires any of the mentioned Legendaries.
---
If the OP was netdecking and took advice on what to replace for those legendaries, I don't think the winrate would be negative against Mech Hunters. I think Midrange hunter would still be a good matchup as well as long as you have Leeroy since that can potentially win the game before they play Zul'jin.
---
To examine the legendaries we are asking to omit, there's Edwin which is a win condition on its own but can be situational. There's also Togwaggle which is a Value card and Tempo Rogue is mainly an aggressive deck so that can easily be omitted temporarily.
---
Just silence it to remove taunt!
---
I did it in about 3 bosses, just realised how lucky i was.
---
Also forgot but Myras Unstable Element is really important. Probably more important than Edwin and Togwaggle.
---
I mean, plague + lighting storm will almost always equal a board clear
---
I think it's that they gave him a card to reveal but he declined the offer because he's kind of down on Hearthstone these days.
---
Bad Warrior player is Mad.
---
Enjoy your free wins, you only have +/- 30 more days.
---
Well, to be fair, maybe they just have nothing else to play. "Gaming" has changed considerably, unless you're content with playing old school titles (like me).  
---
I've found hearthstone to be more enjoyable as a casual game with friends the last year, but I have found it more difficult to even just do daily quests. I've wasted money on the game I feel, unless I go back to it (for like the 5th time) in the future. It was definitely a fun run.
---
Especially these days
---
Taunt warrior is back on the menu
---
I did this exact thing earlier, still managed to win though :)
---
If you see a post saying "X is great everyone should buy it/vote for them" and it's a fresh account it's almost certainly astroturfing. But people have cottoned onto that so X buy older accounts to look more legitimate - if there's an account that was originally used by an actual person that starts shilling it's harder to figure out if they're astroturfing or not
---
Shieldbreaker meta?
---
I stopped liking his channel when he just arbitrarily decided to throw games, it wasn't really fun to watch him do well, then be like "Well, you aren't playing this deck" so he'd concede
---
When I see an off-meta deck, I like to add the player and congratulate them for their creativity. Weird how differently people can see things
---
Lmao Is this a joke or something? 
---
How sensitive of a man do you have to be to call a community super toxic then reference a post that was very clearly a joke he made 4 videos in a row titled "100% WINRATE EPIC GAMER DECK" and people made fun of it, nobody on here took it very seriously, he himself saw it and didn't take it seriously so why are you.
---
The guy gave away the card reveal because he doesn't play the game right now and wanted to get some credit in the community stop being such a drama queen
---
So you‚Äôre a troll, got it.
---
Yeah, why on earth would Arch*THIEF* Rafaam get thief cards?
---
I'm playing RDUs Shirvallah for a while now...you are right though, the wins are free :^)
---
I'm fine with warrior getting a trash legendary, though i feel like this could be an epic
---
the name don't fit a legendary
---
&gt; Desilxia 
---
I mea seriously. Who doesn't know how to spell dysleckseah?
---
That's the Heartsthone version of a tank I can buy into. Some giant Armadillo with a laser strapped to its back. Also punny name.
---
I also appreciate Team 5 going in with cool Handbuffs. I hark back on that a lot, but those kind of cards should have been in Mean Streets of Gadgtezan. Buffing one guy out of your hand at random, with your largely understatted cards, that's only controllable when the handbuff is keyword restricted (Stolen Goods), is pretty bad, especially when the buff is only like a +3/+3 at best. Buffing all cards of a specific type though, that's interesting to build around.
---
So, this digs into a lot of potential synergies, even when those aren't very present in Standard right now. It's a beast, so you can grab this guy with Barrens Stablehand or buff it with Untamed Beastmaster in your handbuff Beast Warrior. It's a taunt and handbuffs taunts with an end of turn effect, neither of those is currently supported in Standard afaik. 4/7 is a solid statline for 6 and the guy instantly effects the board with taunt. There is potential recurring value, but Armagedillo will likely never stick around for a turn, as this guy is a removal magnet. Mid Range Taunt Warrior is something I like quite a bit as an archetype idea that never quite came to fruition (so many tries with Bolster Warrior), but I'm not sure how good that would be. The current Taunt pool might be a bit lacking, outside of some notable beasts like Witchwood Grizzly, Armored War Bear, potential mana cheating Taunts like Rabble Bouncer or Bloodsail Corsair and Zilliax.
---
Pro tip: never accept the friend request. Nobody wants to be your friend.
---
So who should I be watching for newer combos and strategies?
---
For my strat I just got cards that enabled Dr Booms hero power and spammed the hell out of it. By the end of the run I ended at 23 minutes. I was a little lucky with the hero power triggering somewhat often that run, so with less luck than I had, you should still be able to get under 30.
---
Only had the first Remote when that boss came around so it was alright
---
That's the essence of streaming. People who watch video game streams initially look for 2 things: gameplay skill and personality. Of course after watching for years, you might have created a community surrounding the streamer, but at the start, the viewer retention is still based on those two factors. Though I've noticed that streams based on the latter would have an easier time creating a community as compared to the former.
---
both the name and effect don't fit legend√°ries
---
Believe what you want. These card backs are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you purchase 'em. That's "microtransactionalization."
---
Imagine in wild giving your opponent a board full of old murk-eyes
---
There was a time it was on menu??
---
So...why did he announce this publicly instead of just privately to Blizzard?
---
Those are some good choices, yes. I wouldn't say no to a new character if needed either.
---
Why the sarcastic classy?
---
Not to mention it‚Äôs not like we haven‚Äôt experienced Taunt Warrior before.
---

I‚Äôm really tired of Warriors that hide from damage.
---
&gt; I just think it's reaching when you see two pit lords looking alike to assume they're the same being.
---
That's just racist.
---
This guy is too smart he needs to be nerfed
---
Everyone is stupid. But me. I'm genius.
---
They‚Äôre powerful because they can build around the mech control archetype, this is a build around
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Well, I seriously dislike him more than most, I wont deny that, but my points are still true.
---
He just caters to a different audience, with huge over-reactions and an extreme behavior. Do what you do to get the cash, I wont judge.
---
I do the same thing when spelling tommoorroow
---
Anyone who can benefit from lots of 'trustworthy' accounts, either to other users or to the system (or both).
---
Advertisers, scammers, propagandists, bots, etc...
---
Ay guys careful, this guy sounds like an adult. I think we better listen.
---
Where can I get the menu?
---
I don't know, doesn't feel like Legendary card to me...
---
Didn't he also slowly switch to league before TFT even came out for the past year or so ?
---
I don't find it appropriate nor true in any way to call anyone a "TFT streamer" when the game came out less than a month ago.
---
A lot of big league of legends streamers switched to Apex Legends for a bit when it came out, for the vast majority they came back to league.
---
Good bot.
---
Yes because when i'm playing a game about elves and goblins i think of the diversity of the cast.
---
The neutral 4/2 carrot girl that makes targeted beast immune for your turn? I can't think of the name, but she says "Who's a good boy?" when played, I think.
---
Well, I don't think Unidan was planning on selling or anything was he? He boosted his own account of course but I figure that was more just him getting too obsessed with his 'fame' and such. Shame too, he was actually always a quite positive poster.
---
Well, *almost* always.
---
So that's a no then?
---
Its always funny to see people rage over stupid shit like this, i already know he was playing some super generic net deck and now rages because it diden‚Äôt work out
---
No, I have a disability
---
Beats me, I stopped playing Hearthstone. Game isn't fun anymore. Find it boring.
---
Yes, I can think critically therefore I'm just SO INVESTED. lol.
---
**PSA for this Brawl**: If you find up taking a Draw on one of these bosses, it doesn't end your run. Instead you get to take another crack at the boss you tied with.
---
this just happened to me as Rafaam vs Vaelastrasz -- the second-to-last guy, whose AutoCast h.p. draws 2 cards for both players. We were both down to like 10 health, and several cards into fatigue. I couldn't finish him off, then on his turn, the latest fatigue hits sent us both below 0. So I was like "great, no golden Rafaam's Scheme for me"
---
but then the run didn't end!  so I was like "woah, check this out"
---
Damn, that takes a lot of restraint. In the same position I'd imagine I wouldn't have the same patience/respect
---
Regis started getting to reveal cards and I‚Äôve seen his stream grow from around just about 100 per stream to consistently over 200. It‚Äôs great for those smaller streamers just trying to make it happen
---
Did you not see that like, 90% of the comments on here are jacking him off?
---
What's funny is that a comment on the original r/customhearthstone thread where this card was created was by someone that said that the card was OP because "just a few chargers" and you could OTK.
---
bad bot
---
&gt;Ad hominem? 
---
You should avoid using terms you don't understand. It's just making you look even worse.   
---
Nice stalking and double reply by the way! I'm going to block you now for your own sake. Just know that I feel very sorry for you.
---
I don't even play HS anymore but I don't have a problem with you having a card reveal.
---
These posts are getting ridiculous. He's an arch-thief. He steals stuff. The bucket says thief. He even has a hero power that steals cards from opponent's deck and gloves of mugging in his base deck. Figure it out...
---
Was this ripped straight out of DK64?  I love it.
---
Because Kripp is still primarily a Hearthstone player and as far as I know all his YouTube vids are about Hearthstone.  
---
Toast is not really a hearthstone player nowadays, shame cause I liked him, don't like TFT
---
&gt; I also said well played as he conceded, i was genuinly saying well played but he took it as a BM.   
---
Because Blizzard doesn't allow a BM response, they have destroyed communication.  Hence, players assume "well played" actually means something negative.  This is an inevitable result of Blizzard attempting to screw with language.
---
No it wasn‚Äôt but you might have gotten it through a pack and not noticed??
---
what are his personal feelings on hearthstone?
---
if your feeling for the game are this weak you werent paying money for it anyways who cares about f2p people from marketting point of view
---
Lol at this above comment. And people wonder why he wants nothing to do with the HS community anymore.
---
Sorry, you went against against the hivemind. have some dinvotes
---
Its a vanilla 30/30. Silence does nothing to it.
---
You can make a good amount of money selling accounts during elections.
---
Who is shitting on him "all over reddit?"
---
Maybe this is what happens when you Curse of Flesh an Oblivitron.  Was Oblivitron in WoW?
---
Eh, the benefits of advertising have been proven over and over again. The drawbacks of negative advertising, which are what that'd be is... well. Bad press is still press.
---
These posts are so ridiculous. Does no one actually think before posting. He's a freaking thief people. Figure it out
---
I actually did everything I was supposed to to earn the free Tyrande skin and then they never followed through. I never bother trying to buy any skins after that, if they don‚Äôt honor the free skins they make you jump through hoops for, who‚Äôs to say they don‚Äôt just pocket my money for nothing in return?
---
Mana Cyclone and Magic Dart Frog, Stargazer Luna. They're very strong cards and easy to activate by running a lot of cheap spells. Ray of Frost too.
---
It's always on the menu, but nobody orders it
---
I never liked the guy, but i dont think anybody should give half a fuck what some random angry people on the internet think. You could say it sends more wrong messages to morons who think they accomplished sth now.
---
Something something corridor creeper?
---
^^I may or may not have seen what you‚Äôre referencing
---
The game is stale. I have 0 interest in playing any games in HS right now but it is difficult to let go because of the investment I have in it. I really do not want to play and if I quit now I will never come back for any reason even if the game magically becomes 100x better as I will be too far behind to catch up. So basically it is a question of should I quit forever or keep playing? The game is way too expensive normally so there is no chance I will spend money to catch up because it would cost hundreds of dollars.
---
Easy solution. Release same card at same time by multiple streamers (one HS and one other).
---
While Taunt is a Warrior mechanic, one can argue, that the benefit of Taunt is keeping the party alive. In other words, Taunt, as a mechanic is meaningless on its own. 
---
In other words, what good is Taunt for the warrior who fights alone? The Taunt is there to help a party of classes cooperate. Taunt is as much a mechanic for Priests as it is warriors because most, if not all of, Priest‚Äôs healing efforts are going to the Taunt target. 
---
In other words, Taunt isn‚Äôt something that solely belongs to warrior.
---
Nope, there was literally one thread yesterday that was *mildly* critical of him, but that was it. And of the comments in this thread are super supportive of him, and his legions of fanboys are downvoting anything that says otherwise.
---
Their victim complex is inane. Imagine going berserk defending a guy with over 1 million Twitch followers from some mean words on the internet lol
---
The reason we see less hero portraits in the shop is when they first started doing them, there was huge complaints in the community that these skins were locked away (some reason the community has been very against paid cosmetics in the early days, perhaps general sentiment has changed now but who knows). Hence, why it has only been the initial three and none have been added since.
---
Reddit: Don't make Mech Warrior better.
---
Also Reddit: This doesn't go into Mech Warrior so this card is TRASH, **REEE**.
---
----
---
Mike Donais heavily implied we'll see playable taunt minions for Warrior. So given that, this could be good. Just depends on the support. Card seems good as long as the deck that it goes into exists.
---
Honestly, if I was Blizzard and I could pick between Thijs, Toast and Kripp to do card reveals for FREE on their stream, OR I could pay Will Smith 1 million dollars to do them, I'd be calling up Will Smith.  
---
This idea that you are supposed to be rewarded for your time invested/loyalty is total BS.  
---
Noone "deserves" anything.
---
Why do we still care what some variety streamers do. Well i can get behind it tho, distancing yourself from dying game's drama is healthy for his mental for sure
---
Better something than nothing.
---
&gt; The transformation would happen before the Battlecry. Twilight Drake would lose one attack, but it would gain two health. 
---
Normally a twillight drake is played as a 4/5. Here, after quest, it would be a 3/3.
---
Also, a horde of 3/3s do nothing to win a midgame/lategame. Why would you run a quest so bad? It synergices way less with 1 health minions than cards like never surrender, or simple silverhand synergies.
---
Also, mage quest reward isnt a legendary effect from before, same for shaman. Only druid and warlock were, and you guys already think its how all the rest of the 7 quests will be.
---
