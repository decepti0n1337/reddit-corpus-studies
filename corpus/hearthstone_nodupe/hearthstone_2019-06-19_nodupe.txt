Time to learn German (it‚Äôs German right?) so that I can learn what this post is saying and so I can appreciate Blizzard for these awesome interactions!

That escalated quickly
---
Opponent greats. I use "threaten" and squelch. I'm farming gold, I'm not looking for a social experience. 
---

---
Blizzard please, enable auto squelch. Sometimes I forget to do it.
---
What is this?
---
22 pogo hoppers in a dalaran heist deck, id say thats unbalanced
---
Naw, I just apparently didn't understand wock. When it transforms it stops. The Swampqueen minion cast storm bringer. I just got unlucky.
---
Fuck you're right. I've finished 1-3 rank in the last 3-4 months and somehow didn't know this. Thanks.
---
From my point of view the Jedi are evil!
---
It‚Äôs the case, they changed(nerfed) shudder to be like yogg where if it dies/it‚Äôs transformed the battlecry stops.
---
&gt;Magnetic is incredibly strong,
---
It's strong in the exact same way as Aura enchantments in Magic the Gathering. Yeah, it makes your minion big, but when your opponent inevitably removes it by spending only one card, you'll be down at least one more card than your opponent.
---
&gt;as long as they have even a 1/1 they can magnetize two warbots and bam that's an 11/11 with CHARGE. 
---
I will say buff effects in Hearthstone are stronger than Aura Enchantments in Magic because removal tends to be more expensive in the latter, attackers in the latter get to choose where damage goes, and card advantage is a bit more fluid in Hearthstone, but my point still stands.
---
Granted, buff effects do have an extra weakness in Hearthstone that they don't in Magic, and it's avible to all classes: Silence.
---
&gt;Or all they have to do is summon all of their bombs and that's an automatic 50% from the enemy's hp without them having to do anything else. 
---
Yeah. That's what aggressive decks do. Granted, the Goblin Bombs actually have to die. They don't just deal two damage naturally.
---
Control Warrior doesn't have the worst match-up against it for a good reason.
---
&gt;And what is up with the missle launcher/poison combo? 
---
Oh yes. The eight mana and two card combo in a class that can't really tutor either card up that does clear the board and leave a 6/6 up. It loses to pretty much every form outright single target removal and silence. Try playing some.
---
&gt;Did no seriously think that might be a little too strong? 
---
Well, for the first six months the combo existed, it did absolutely nothing in Standard or wild.
---
&gt; And if all else fails just summon ZulJin and gg. 
---
Mech Hunter doesn't play Zul'jin nor an ample amount of spells to really justify playing the card. If Unleash the Beast isn't being played in your Hunter deck, you really shouldn't even consider playing Zul'jin.
---
Xur'ios is a boss from the new Dalaran adventure. His hero power is that any spells drawn cost zero during the same turn. His first card drawn was Arcane Intellect into Power of Creation to summon two Auctioneers which results in him unloading his entire deck on my face.
---
Not that I really doubt it, but please include the pictures that show that you beat them with each hero power as well. I wanna see the ultimate proof of that 100% completion in one album.
---
Here's a little lesson in trickery
---
Why is Zilliax so good? I run him in my stupid shitty Oblivitron deck because he's magnetic and good but I see him all the time in stuff like murloc shaman and spell damage mage and other decks he doesn't belong in. Without magnetizing him, he's a 5 mana 3/2 underneath the keywords. Why does he earn a spot in all these nearly mechless decks?

Maybe a video of someone opening forty packs from a set and not getting a legendary.  If there's no pity timer, surely one would have surfaced by now?  All data collected in any sort of official capacity has supported the theory that there's a pity timer.
---
  
---
Blizzard support aren't the people who make the game.  They parrot whatever they're told to.  And they're blizzard, so they have a vested interest in the answer that's given to the question.
---
Shudderwock can only cast a maximum of 40 battlecries, maybe that is the problem?
---
Maybe for the others, but Mountain Giant has been a core/deck-defining card in at least one top tier deck for at least the last year and a half.
---
You are really facing two opponents. The other player, and the whims of our dear lord RNGeezus.
---
he still gets ashbringer so 6 dmg / turn, but you have fatigue protection and can still put stuff on the board so you win
---
This sums up Warrior matches after Boom drops early.
---
A few ideas:
---
1. Pick a letter of the alphabet and make a deck only out of cards that have that letter in the name
---
2. Pick a color, only choose cards with that color decently featured in the art 
---
3. Use a random number generator to randomly pick 5 cards, put as many copies of them in a deck as you can, and build the rest of your deck around them
---
4. Try to win with a rule where you only allow yourself to do face damage with certain cards - stolen cards (if playing rogue/priest), weapons only, spells only, etc.
---
These are all great, especially since I can kinda do all of these on 1 account
---
Good bot
---
The flip side of that, is that once the cards rotate you now have all this extra dust for keeping up with new sets (which Wild players also need to do)
---
Carousel is the dumbest imo, fuck that ride
---
I play Wild because I don't want to let cards go that I enjoy to play. On the other hand I like to build my own decks and win Games with a strategy I chose rather than limiting myself to a smaller card pool and a "predictable" line of play. If my opponent knows what I am playing (which in Standard it is mostly the case) he can hard Mulligan for an answer and play around certain cards - leaving me vulnerable and with a major disadvantage. Creativity will always be my main motivation playing Hearthstone and Wild satisfies a huge portion of that. Also your point about Standard having less degenerate stuff is invalid since a card like [[Toki, Time-Tinker]] exists which makes Wild also a part of Standard. In my opinion Wild is as competitive as Standard because it takes a certain amount of understanding the game until you reach high ranks or high Legend.

Please tell me I'm not alone in thinking Rastakhan's Rumble is the most unbalanced RNG-based piece of trite imaginable? I skipped this solo adventure pretty much the first time it came out because I wasn't too interested in continuing to play Hearthstone at the time, but now that I've come back to it, I realize I must have played one match, gotten obliterated by RNG and rage-quit.
---
Why the hell didn't they ever go back and balance it? I mean aside from not caring about old solo adventures.
---
I agree. Wild is where all the jank I‚Äôm sick of goes to die and never come back.
---
This is going down in history
---
Good to see classic cards seeing so much play. Back in the black rock mountain days, never in my life did I think I would get a 1 mana 1/1 Alexstraza and 1/1 maly  in my hand so I could burst my opponent down with mind blasts, but look at us now. Tier 3 baby

Chadgar will give you more cards, not to worry
---
ofc buddy, you cant beat 10 packs and 400 dust for 5 bucks
---
What are you generally playing right now?
---
This ain't it, Chief.
---
Whats the difference between stronger alternatives and rotating or hof cards?
---
If there is stronger alternatives you need the new sets cards to be competitive
---
If there is rotating classic or more hof cards you need the new sets cards to be competitive because there is less options to choose from classic.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like your option does anything different but power creep the game faster
---
Khadgar's text reads as "minions you summon summon twice as many". He comboed with conjurer's calling can summon 4 big minions. In this case however, deathrattle triggered first so he could only summon a bunch of 1/1's (could have summoned 4 6 drops if not the deathrattle)

Haha I see, thank you!

Geezz.. It's only within 1 second isn't it?

I‚Äôm very low level. I play everything, but I play mage and warrior the most because they are the most completed for the classic deck.

---
Kizi is my mortal enemy. She had a 6/3 chest in wing 1 after three turns
---
Those failures will exist at any level of any game you play, not only card ones, would be extremely dificult to develop a game so deeply that reseembles reality, and it's understable, anyway, that wasn't the point I wanted to make clear but the implementation of a mechanic closely to existing card games, like MtG with the Black Decks. It's not news that sometimes Blizzard take ideas from another card games to be implemented on Hearthstone, and why not use something from them to maybe solve a problem as the community has called it?
---
Im not against the power of the deck, but can't be denied that sometimes unbeatable plays can be made, some classes just cannot deal with them, how to deal with 4 - 5 Ragnaros, or 2 - 3 Y'shaarj, without having any Board clear spell like Lightbomb or Brawl, and also to mention unspected OTK from nowhere more than resurrecting stuff without counterplay.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not profitable. I‚Äôm saying it exponentially increases the work team five has to do.
---
I believe you met Balthazar Bratt.
---
&gt;  Unless graveyard interaction outside of mostly Big Priest is added to the game in a future set, it should not be added to the game. Simple as that. As Hearthstone is right now, it would be adding a layer of complexity where it does not need to be. 
---
Why? Every expansion a new mechanic is added to the game, it keep it fresh, interesting and fun, and currently we have the History Bar, just a lesser not developed version of a graveyard, I would love to be able to manipulate the History Bar just to see what card has been played since I dont use any tracker.
---
I agree, balance shouldn't be done through a change on the current mechanics, but the resurrect mechanic as it is now, seems something done deepness, but the game must go on and blizzard must avoid future problems.
---
Blizzard will never read this, and they may never implement the things I'm saying, and honestly I don't mind as long as the game is playable and Fun, so stay calm, if they ever do, they will find a way to exploit it with new mechanic just as you said.

that description does not explain what "concealing" a spell means mechanically. a spell has an effect and mana cost that happens as soon as you play it and is hidden in the hand before. how is it concealed? does its effect just not happen, or...?
---
See, thats my point exactly. Xurios is NOT challenging... unless he burns you down turn in a single turn. I have never lost to him turn 1 like that, but the one time I lost to him was turn 3, with turn 1 arcane intellect into tools of creation + pyroblast. And then there really isnt a lot of counterplay of drafting strategies that you can blame yourself for not using.

With mage decks these days Alex is bs. They constantly build a massive board with khadgar / conjurer and if you don't manage to clear everything and have to tank damage you just lose. It's really not healthy.
---
Yeah but wing one is the only one where she really has any power, due to starting with a minion.

---
Worst, as, extremely efficient and deadly:  
---
1 mana, tunnel trogg. 2 mana, totem golem. 3 mana, totem golem. 4 mana, tuskarr totemic. I was so frustrated that I conceded, added him as a friend, then insulted his mom. He laughed, then I insulted his grandmother.
---
on the contrary that's exactly what you do with weasel priest
---
Hello Blizzard,can you please stop matching me with people that obviously played a lot longer and put good amounts of cash into the game? When I see my opponent has a golden animation or even a character that isn't free I cringe. How am I supposed to ever get coins and level up in ranked if people that are matched against me have as many legendaries as I have normal minions?
---
Be honest now, this is not from actually your account or is it.
---
Inefficient, of course. That‚Äôs a nasty curve though, ouch.
---
As for the first guy, hope he got the boulderfist value he was looking for
---
I'm kinda hoping that they deal with it another way, namely by (re-)adding reliable removal options for *all* classes. As things stand right now, Paladin, Warlock, and especially Druid lack a reasonable way to deal with an early giant (and Druid in particular has no reliable removal for big targets at all since the latest nerfs).
---
I mean, as I see it, the typical problem cards in Hearthstone are those that are plain unfair in the sense that you just can't effectively play around them. Explosive Runes was a particularly striking example since there was no 3-mana-option that could possibly deal with a 3-mana-secret so that the other player came out on top of that exchange.
---
It's the same reason why *every* "growing 1-mana-drop" had to been nerfed eventually -- they always force the opponent to spend more resources for removal than it takes to play them, so the 1-mana-drop generates value even with optimal counterplay.
---
So, in my opinion, the primary problem with the different variants of Conjurer Mage is the scarcity of adequate removal options and their unequal distribution among the classes. Case in point, considering that this Mage archetype was designed specifically to target Warriors, it's somewhat telling that the matchup against Warrior isn't even the most favorable one, simply because Warrior has removal options coming out of his ears.
---
F2P player here. Played quite a lot of heists until now but only recently unlocked the last chapter.   
---
This is the first time I've seen him. My quest was to "slay the bears". Three popped up, \[\[Ironfur Grizzly\]\], then \[\[Bearshark\]\] and as the last \[\[Amani War Bear\]\]. He didn't draw any cards and after defeating the bears I got to choose one of three treasures. After that he immediately died and the match ended.
---
I assume there's a range of quests of which he'll give you one randomly? And the encounter has to be really rare or only possibly in the last chapter. Didn't find any posts about him so I thought I'd give it some highlight.

I think he shows up in ~10% of Citadel runs.

His quests include: Escorting an Oasis Snapjaw, clearing the sewers of Murlocs, collecting bear livers, and dealing with gnolls and Hogger.
---
That is hilarious
---
When only 3-4 decks don't run a card, I think it's still a pretty ubiquitous card.
---
Azure Drake wasn't played in Zoolock and Aggro Shaman and Midrange Hunter during Whispers.

Yet the card was pretty fucking everywhere

Were you playing hunter? If so, i would do the same thing

I‚Äôll try casual and see how it goes. Thanks! I‚Äôd build a meta deck if I had all the cards for one. Still getting there.

It had the highest winrate prior to the last round of "balancing", as well.

---
This just sounds like a weaker version of the dragon-based Divine Spirit combo deck from the previous meta. How does this not auto-lose to the mech warrior deck?
---
It was super strong with a Shirvallah + Bolvar deck, for me. Just had to survive and draw Shirvallah and the game was over.
---
Wait, where's the BM? 
---
Or do you mean you're going to BM him before killing him? I don't see any BM from the opponent.
---
probably BM before screenshot.
---
By uninstalling the game because it‚Äôs had its glory days ! Used to love the game but it‚Äôs ruined now.
---
Proves that people who play mage are brainless (coming from a guy who has mage golden). Lmao, but still I think Conjurer's Calling is a problem not only in arena but also in constructed. Mana Cyclone seems a bit OP as well imo. CC should be bumped up to at least 4 mana and Cyclone should be at least 3 to prevent the 0 mana draw 5+ spells shenanigans. Even on like turn 5 a Conjurer's on a 4 drop can be game winning in arena if you get a thicc value trade beforehand. To be fair, I think they increased it's bucket since the Rise of Mech update, so I see it much less than before. I myself have played mage 2 or 3 times and I've gotten it twice. Opponent typically conceded the turn it was played. Just such a toxic card in arena that has little counter play...
---
Why isn't anyone playing token druid? It's fairly cheap and powerful deck, had such nice winning streaks with it, got from rank 14 to rank 8 in about 2 hours, but then i stopped, because i want my friends to see i'm rank 8 :D overall it's a good deck
---
r/WatchPeopleDieInside
---
Dire frenzy is not a very good card in this matchup. You want hyenas (with 1 drops), animal companions, kill commands and unleash sometimes. You need to hero power often in this matchup, because by turn 8/9 if you don't kill them you lose. Squeezing damage is very important. You only want to dire frenzy huffer and hounds tbh. Misha is ok, springpaw maybe if that's your only play. Hard Mulligan for animal companions and hyenas, that's about it. It's a 60-40 matchup for the hunter in my experience, only way you lose is they play early mirror images and you don't have unleash
---
That‚Äôs a mechanic. You need board space for magnetic to trigger.

It says what is going on. Your board was full. Magnetic minions require a spot on the board, even when magnetized.

I dont get it.

Can someone please explain?

---
*if you want to be a villain number one

It's not a bug. You need board space to magnetize because you have to be able to put the minion in play first.

Also, read that again but imagine it was in caps. Looks stupid doesn't it?
---
Take control of the spell damage totem then holy nova ez gg

Control warlock is kinda dead. It has been since cubelock rotated out I believe, and even that deck wasn't that controlly. Warlock is one of the worst classes in the game right now, zoolock gets outclassed by hunter and rogue, while losing hard to any control decks. I miss playing zoo so much, used to have a ton of fun, but we need warrior to be bad in order to play zoo again

A complete lack of subtlety has been a thing in the TV-series since season 1. [Game of Thrones] &gt;!Like how they needed to explicitly spell out that Renly and Loras were gay several times in the first season, effectively reducing them both to tired stereotypes of what gay people are like.!&lt;

---
Instructions unclear accidentally burnt rope
---
Ya man I got hit with a similar deck and I believe it was T7 when he dropped 4 Grave Horror in one turn with double Seance. Brutal.
---
First and foremost, what you're experiencing is an inherent weakness of the deck archetype. Murlocs aren't good lategame units, and even though they can *hold* a board reasonably well, they're pretty bad at getting board control back once you've actually lost it. No amount of tinkering with the deck will actually solve that weakness, otherwise everybody would be playing only Murlocs because they'd be unbeatable.
---
That said, I still see some options to improve your decklist in a way that increases your chances of not losing the board to your opponent in the first place. The first ideas that come to mind (without outright changing the archetype away from Murloc Shaman) would be Henchclan Hogsteed, Belligerent Gnome and/or Feral Spirit to protect your board, Likkim or the axe to kill off other minions during the first few turns, perhaps Storm Bringer to "upgrade" your Murlocs during the late game, maybe Swampqueen Hagatha for her potential to swing things around. At the same time, I'd take out all the shitty Murloc cards that you're probably never keen to draw in the first place. Start with Murloc Raider who isn't even a desirable minion to play on turn 1 and only gets worse from there.
---
I remember when I was a young kid watching Yu-Gi-Oh thinking how cool it would be if we could actually have the technology to 'summon' the cards. Here we are with the technology, just lacking the person mad enough to make it happen.
---
Yes I thought it's different for opponent since he's on the other side of the board.
---
its always like this. priest has by far the worst classic set, because it has no direction its going or too many directions to be precise. the only way of making priest strong, is by giving it op or borderline-op cards.
---
i'd love it, if blizzard gave priest a little love (that doesnt help cancerous shit as reviving big minions for 10 turns straight or inner fire bullshit)
---
and i'd love it if blizzard stopped giants getting abused by mage.
---
There are already a lot of good tips in this thread so I'll just keep it short.

I'm using a similar decklist I just hit 5 from 10 in like 3 hours, some of the cards I added were Earth shock,Shudderwock, Hagatha, Zilliax, Swamp queen, Acidic Ooze(don't have Harrison) its 26-12(68% wr) right now.   
---
Remember for aggro matchup you mostly trade, for control you go face. Try mulligan an Earth shock for Mech or rogue matchups.  
---
Token Druid is a really unfavourable match-up and is almost always a loss, similarly Zoo warlock is a unfavourable match up too so watch out for those.
---
odd time to chat but, Hello!

Then your opponent didnt know what they were doing.  An immune taunt is the same as a stealth taunt, it can be ignored and attacked past

Lindsey copied Carol of Bells from me with the anomaly of spells cost 2 less active. I had to painfully watch the computer play bells until it could 1 shot me.
---
Also don't forget the Slowpoke who reads this three days too late.
---
I dont think it works like this man
---
You‚Äôve misunderstood me. I primarily play Wild.
---
The /r/WildHearthstone subreddit is useful because it is focused and usually receives a lot more meaningful discussion than Wild posts in the ‚Äúmain‚Äù subreddit.
---
You are obviously welcome to post wild content here but I think you will be disappointed with the results.
---
Totems summon always to the right from your point of view. So it's the spell damage totem that was summoned before OP's turn.
---
I have a mug with that picture on it
---
Big priest is the one everybody is constantly complaining about....but it's only ever that people not paying attention think they're winning then get board cleared and immediately lose when they drop a statue.
---
That's not the decks fault. S
---
Hell the list isn't great it just has high roll potential.
---
I heard the "awwwroooooo"
---
Few days ago some troll tried bashing hearthstone... I wasn't like bruh you're 2 months too late.
---
So... it‚Äôs bad manners to win on a top deck?
---
Nobody has good manners then lol
---
Tell that to the OP not me. I'm not saying it's bad manners, just forwarding. I told them it isn't bm.
---
I cAnT fInD iT
---
Except quests, right?
---
Snip snap i cracc your bacc
---
guys, i know its not literally BM but what i meant is that it felt that way 
---

Shadow madness into healing stream totem and holy nova :) 
---
Pray that your opponent dcs
---
I love you.
---
Eh. So I miss a classic pack this week. Nbd. Might even be fun trying to win with  just one expansion.
---
That's the risk you run when buying things from total strangers on the internet.
---
Ooh neat. At least it lets you queue even if your deck only had 12 cards.
---
Just won another 3 games in a row, 1 vs bomb warrior and 2 of them vs tempo rouge.
---
Honestly im incredibly suprised with these results myself, im going to keep testing it out.
---
The last game vs rouge was me having a hand full of buffs until turn 5. He completely destroyed me tempo wise, i was at 3 health at turn 14 or something and i managed to slap down grave horror into double divine spirit and inner fire to give me a 32/32 with taunt. Gg! he had already used sap, and every time i win with tge deck i think people are genuinely shocked, i always get the wow
---
not exactly rocket science. There‚Äôs only two cards. Is this really how far ‚ÄúSpot the lethal‚Äù has fallen?
---
agreed
---
Started in GvG, now also have all standard cards and wouldnt need to dust wild cards anymore. But if i had not dusted them there is no way I would have all nessecary cards.
---
I know.  I always looked forward to seeing his work on this subreddit.  I may have gotten burned, but the least I can do is help others learn from my mistake.
---
so someone who started yesterday can just make the same variety of decks as someone who's played for years, and built a solid collection *and* had the foresight to keep their Wild cards?
---
so basically, you would just have Blizzard hand everyone a free pack.  They already do that several times a year; getting a pack from Brawl entails at least a little effort
---
now its like nothing happened!
---
You should never pay a stranger over the internet BEFORE the service/good is produced.
---
I've got no problem making any standard deck, either. And most wild decks. Try not being poor.
---
Ooh, the extremely rare well done shitpost. If I could upvote this again I would.
---
I made an order with that user as well at about the same time as you, and while I have not received my order yet I did learn that he was having some health problems that delayed his work. I have sent him messages though and have received pictures of the card I ordered so I believe it should still be coming despite the wait. We are currently working out shipping details. One note is that I ordered a golden version of a card but the images he sent ended up being the standard version with him claiming the gold material he was going to use ended up being poor quality so he switched to the standard card instead (Without updating me). So it‚Äôs not optimal, but it does seem like he is working on it and it seems like he may not be entirely fluent in English.
---
yup, it's almost like dusting all your cards was dumb.
---
/r/subsyoufellfor
---
It lets you play a ton of spells while going down only 1 card. Magic trick and 1 cast of frost ray even net you +1 card.
---
Funny enough, I'd been struggling with first rogue completion always failing at either 7th or the final boss but when I finally managed to win rogue has become my most played class in dungeon runs.
---
Sure but you should also never provide goods or services to a stranger over the internet before they pay you.  Someone has to make the first move.
---
Well, that is *IMPOSSIBLE* advice for new players to follow, period. It's also dumb. There are cards from every set that are unplayable garbage. Every player has one class they just don't like to play. And every season has one class that's stuck to the bottom of the ladder. New to midrange players have to - wait for it! - actually win games in order to advance.
---
The smartest advice has always been "use it or dust it." That got me from F2P to pro level with dust to spare last time I had the game, that's what's getting me through now, that's what everybody should do.
---
Yeah, RNG is the real final boss in this game.
---
Can Da Undatakah copy the deathrattles of the minions that magnetic'd into other mechs?
---
THIS IS A SCAM. TAKES PAYMENT BUT NEVER SENDS ANYTHING.
---
# NOT AGAIN
---
I made a Hooktusk deck with Naga Corsairs, Squidfaces, and Ticket Scalpers. I don't have patches thou. I did make the mistake of putting in Sharkfin fan because I wanted to use cannon barrage but luckily it hasn't messed me up yet. Also counterfeit coins for ramp.
---
Until a few hours from now when every deck is copypaste from hearthpwn
---
/u/pequenoartesao - wtf?
---
This is really a public play test for arena to identify broken combos. 
---
The last Brawl Block new and old had Boomsday and GvG, along with other sets and those two are in arena currently. 
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs brilliant execution to satisfy player demand for limited card pool modes while also identifying potential broken or OP combos for future arena mixes.
---
0-3 with almost the exact same deck. You auto lose to basically any kind of aggro
---
I‚Äôd like to say formats like this are great for keeping things fresh as well as integrating old sets. This rewards long time players and creates new, fun combinations for decks. As someone mentioned before, it would be very cool to have a legacy format. I also think a pauper like format, in which only common cards can be played would be super interesting.
---
Aggressive jade/evolve/yogg shaman has worked well so far. Most decks have no way to recover from Rain of Toads/Doppelgangster Evolve turns, and Jade Claws, Thing From Below, Devolve, and 4 mana 7/7 are just as broken as ever. Once you take control of the board it is very hard to lose it since Priest is really the only class with AOE.
---
It is illegal, but plenty of people still do it because the risk is worth having a unique piece of art. My basement is full of ‚Äúillegal‚Äù art. 
---
It‚Äôs a good law to have in place, but I think it‚Äôs also fine to solicit it if you‚Äôre willing to bear the risk of being screwed.
---
If they're on C'thun, they do. Even for "C'thun Lover's" like the Twin Emperors.
---
Now do it with Noggenfogger for the sorry emote.
---
If you Mulligan Unleash the Hounds vs Druid, Shaman, Warlock and even Rogue you keep it. They tend to go very wide on board and you punish that with a single card. Also [[Revenge of the Wild]] will help you vs those archetypes. Hyena is also your friend.
---
Imagine having a full board as shaman and you get killed by your own basic totem
---
Alright then make good on your end and start finishing those orders. Everybody here will forgive you if you just give them what they paid for.
---

2/-/- | Summon your Beasts that died this turn.  
---
Quest Mage is even less interactive than Warriors though
---
Yeah, as someone with a small collection, I really, really hate Wild brawls.
---
I don't know if "illegal" is quite the right word to use here.  Isn't it more of a civil matter?
---
Meaning that if Blizzard decided to sue then they would win, but if Blizzard decided they were fine with it then no harm done.
---
"Illegal" implies that you are in violation of the law regardless of what Blizzard thinks about it.
---
I am not a lawyer.
---
I beat him with the young dragon hawk buffed by spells, and a little luck. You can find some versions of that deck, it's cheap.
---
Absolutely! Let me know how you do! Another thing I forgot to mention is how great haunting visions is because there is a such a small pool of spells and every one of them is almost always useful
---
Yes, I am working exhaustively to make those cards late!
---
This is more of a big nerf to Mage than it‚Äôs a buff to priest soooo yeah give us the buff
---
Who do you think enforces that, exactly?
---
Leeroy and Edwin will always be good, from here until they are HOF.
---
So, just pick one and you can't go wrong.
---
&gt; Paypal is basically an extinct product.
---
Although coincidentally it is one the main forms of payment that Blizzard accepts.
---
the term "illegal" doesn't only apply to criminal cases but also to civil law cases.
---
hell yeah dude
---
I‚Äôm glad they are ‚Äúwatching big priest‚Äù ; I‚Äôm sure it will be nerfed sometime within the next decade.
---
12?  I made a deck with 3 cards.  Sure, it took me 4 or 5 matches to win a game...
---
This is a fantastic brawl format. After a long time, I have had to use cards that I would not normally use. Also my opponents used cards that I would not have normally have seen - so it definitely makes HS fresh again to play!
---
OP wrote that you finished his order 2 months ago, you just haven't shipped it to OP yet.  Is that accurate?
---
of what
---
Possibly, but I have never tested that interaction. 
---
It seems like it would be pretty fringe though since your draw phase happens at the beginnign of your turn, so the only way it could happen is playing Omega Mind and then playing something else to draw into the bomb.
---
Nah... We need more data... It¬¥ll be in the game forever.
---
I found that the meta in wild went on for way longer than standard. Big Priest lasted over a year.
---
When you let poor people into your game and then make a super cheap tier 1 deck that requires no decision making and can pilot itself, you get this.
---
We're basically playing Hearthstone: Idle Heroes.
---
Hey Ninjawings, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/hearthstone) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Yeah, Arcane Intellect is really his best card
---
Patches and Small-Time bucc are such a strong opener I couldn't resist
---
What‚Äôs to figure out? Use all your mana each turn
---
Yeah, it's a well known bug
---
 It seems related ti classic and basic cards. There's a thread from yesterday discussing this
---
Knights of the Frozen Throne and Kobolds and Catacombs are expansions just like every other one you see today.
---
They were the first sets to introduce free Single Player content with each set.  So, that's where your confusion might be coming from.
---
I cannot vouch at all for u/peguenoartesau because I know nothing of this person.
---
I did look through a few comments and can verify however that pay-pal can be an absolute horrendous bitch to work with. 2 years ago I subbed to the r/makeamillionaire sub, and went to give someone $1 through pay-pal, only to discover I had my account locked. 
---
I faxed/e-mailed multiple forms of verification, opened two tickets 6 months apart, and my account was never unlocked, I've got no feedback on how to continue, and repeated requests to their support team fall on deaf ears.
---
I'm extremely grateful I was only trying to give a stranger $1 for fun, not trying to pay a bill or manage a business. 
---
So, again, I'm not trying to stand up for some guy I don't know in any way shape or form, but I know for myself that Paypal is a horrendous service with support that makes commcast employees look like they go above and beyond.
---
Yeah that is very likely
---
Oh, thank you for the tip!
---
You can't magnetize a minion with a full board either. FYI
---
Well, actually thats what I did. I used every card I had and it was only 27. It didnt fill in any extra cards. It wa just a 27 card deck
---
does he have a sorry emote tho? gotta get a mayor from bar to find out.
---
Blink fox lol
---
Priest was easiest for me. That cthun package is insane
---
Blink fox lol. I flipped w this post, sorry guys ü§ß
---
My post somehow was deleted, yeah, now I understand that adventures have their own cards which you get by completing adventure and expansions are way bigger and you need to buy them or craft. And I understood where my confusion came from, I thought that journey of ungoro packs are the same as league of explorers (because that expansion and adventure shares the same theme) but now I see, that they are way different things haha, thanks!
---
This is Blizzard's purpose. They want to sell the new Toki bundle (8 packs from each wild set) to new players. This is pretty disgusting marketing imo.
---
Someone drew blink fox so I had too ü§ßüòÇ
---
Nice
---
I can give you the decklist if you want but I have a really fun Reno quest warrior I play time to time it is actually pretty decent and extremely fun
---
I have been doing that my whole life and rarely have had a problems. Also sometimes I sell things once
---
Does anyone know why renounce darkness in Warlock doesnt work? My hero power stays the same and I get warlock class cards.
---
Yeah, cthun let‚Äôs you slide across with almost every class (which has one, I don‚Äôt know if every class can get cthun), it was very pleasing to watch double battlecry 26/26 cthun crushing last boss
---
A likely story...
---
Go for it, sounds like fun!
---
About the same logic as "you should never leave the house" because someone was hurt outside.
---
Well, I for one believe u/pequenoartesao because I know first hand that PayPal refunds can be annoying with different currencies recently. Also, he very obviously did have cancer recently and has always had a long backlog. It seems likely to me that an error in google translate made ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on it it‚Äôll be done‚Äù to ‚ÄúI worked on it and it‚Äôs done‚Äù or something of the sort, and I haven‚Äôt seen OP claim that he‚Äôs asked for a refund before this post. I‚Äôm going to give him the benefit of the doubt because reddit is awful at separating foreign speakers from scammers, and because I‚Äôve never seen a real scammer try to defend themselves on threads calling them out. I could very well be wrong, but if I‚Äôm not, you owe him more than an apology for severely damaging his reputation on a good site to advertise his products.
---
Mayor Noggenfogger.
---
Yeah, saw that, finished kobolds and catacombs dungeon run with all classes about 8hours ago! Tried knights of the frozen throne, but after seeing what lich king can do, I dropped it haha
---
I want to see it increased to 13, so my wild shaman can evolve a 12 cost giant to a taunt if I need it.
---
Would you care to dm me a pic of it? Ive been thinking of buying a couole myself.
---
How long can this go on?
---
Would you ever add a new game mode, maybe one which rotates sets every 2-4 weeks? You can even make it ranked, or give it a different reward structure. 
---
I think/hope that these brawls are playtests for such possibilities.
---

---
Devolving One Drops doesnt work either !!
---
Np
---
That's just stupid.  
---
If it was deliberate scamming he would a) not post and b) run multiple accounts to scam with.  
---
Refunding a scam isn't what one does when one runs a scam.
---
I think it's like that in Heist moreso than other modes.  Obv I can't objectively prove it, but I have that feeling of "okay, guess I lose" much more often in Heist than KNC or TWW.  Rumble Run was pretty snowbally too though, since the Shrines started in play.
---
Congrats that‚Äôs super impressive!!!
---
Use counter spell instead

vS knows good, but not perfect. For Rogue I would always look what [J\_Alexander\_HS/](https://twitter.com/J_Alexander_HS/) says, he is a rogue expert.
---
He said ([Source](https://twitter.com/J_Alexander_HS/status/1139209744277823489)):
---
&gt;I agree with everything written here. Count the number of times they call Spirit of the Shark garbage.     
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I like their Hooktusk build. I‚Äôm still favoring a Thug over Edwin but I think that difference will be marginal
---
Yeah but it fucking lies about ALL cards in Wild mode. It wouldn‚Äôt let me play my Foil Charizard and I paid good money for that shit.
---
Thanks for the nice msg!
---
Mill Rogue or Revive Priest. The only correct decks to play in Wild.
---
hm good idea. I have none of the cards in like any of these decks people are suggesting lol
---
So leaving the house is assessing the same risk as giving a stranger money over the internet.  Good try
---
Why did you delete your Reddit comments about taking more orders on as of 2 weeks ago?
---
Sooo you are posting decks that you personally don't agree are good?  
---
Are you just posting random decks that people play at legend or something?  Fuck if that's the case anyone can do that.  
---
I'm a bit confused at the purpose of this thread if it's not to highlight decks you, as the poster, at least think are good?
---
I lost a game the other day because discover UI on mobile blocks being able to see opponents armor.
---
For what it's worth, you really do not seem like a bad guy. I wish you a speedy recovery. 
---
P.S. Your product is amazing.
---
The lottery of opening packs is also a concern. So it's not only grinding for coins to get cards to maybe enchant some card you need for a cheap deck, it's also a lot of luck.
---
I would start by playing ranked. From rank 50 -25 you'll earn packs every five ranks. It's a good way to learn to play and build your collection.
---
Music#21245 NA 80g quest
---
I think it would be easier if you see me as 2 persons:
---
* [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) : The Job is just to post decks hit high legend. They don't have any opinion, except maybe stats.
---
* neon31 : This is the person behind it, I have a lot of personal opinions.
---
Let's say neon31 is one of the wild players that hate Big Priest, that's fine, but [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) will still post it.
---
If neon31 says he trusts Alexander more than others that's fine, but [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) will still posts decks that runs Shark. 
---
If I remember correct stats had shown that Mossy Horror was good in Heal Zoo Warlock. A lot good players didn't agree with it. This proofs that just cause you run a card or not doesn't mean they have to be correct.
---
Wisp in Rogue is also a good example. Players had different opinions, but stats would shown who is correct (I don't know who was correct).
---
I think it's very hard to say who is correct, Alexander and vS saying Shark is not good (tbh I am not sure if Alexander maybe even has ironic :D), or Players who had success with it. This is the reason why I think it's important to have [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) on one hand and neon31 on the other and this is why their can be a deck that neon31 doesn't like but [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) does.
---
If you just force yourself to manually squelch at the start of every game it quickly becomes an automatic reflex.
---
Cringe
---
I think it is reasonable to run one operative and one spellbreaker. I made a handlock deck that runs one of each and in the non mech matchups i just use golden rafaam to turn it into a golden legendary. It doesn‚Äôt feel that good against mech hunter but it is fantastic against mech paladin. It turns a matchup that is otherwise unwinnable into one that I almost always win
---
This is the very definition of a witch hunt.
---
If I made an op right now that said that /u/Olistone_was_taken ripped me off with no actual proof of an order or anything what would you call that?
---
A fucking *witch hunt*
---
I would still be watching it if I didn‚Äôt see this comment ü§£
---
I'd love this so much. It makes sense to me to rotate it every month along with the other ranked ladders.
---
Can people just stop complaining about unnecessary stuff like this?
---
Question now is, should you dust ü§î
---
I saw you looking for new clients in MtG subreddit 2 weeks ago. It even still shows on your profile.
---
Spilleng
---
Ok, I‚Äôm trying to experiment with off the beat decks now that I‚Äôve found some of the good decks.
---
I think [[Gurubashi Hypemon]] might actually be good in this brawl.  Class cards it can discover are like Aya and Blade of C‚ÄôThun.  Neutral cards it can discover include C‚ÄôThun, Yogg, and N‚ÄôZoth.
---
Spirit of the Shark has not impressed so far.  Not too surprising, but I thought maybe with Jades.  (But the one time I had it, I was like ok, let me set this up so that I can get two battlecries on Aya, and honestly I think I would have been better just playing Aya on curve).  Maybe it sets up an OTK with C‚ÄôThun?

Also, the root cause of this issue is not ‚Äúhis word‚Äù at all - it was delayed orders, to which he has responded.

Are there any budget one turn kill decks in standard? I got the Frozen Throne adventure and the first boss requires OTK. I think with enough luck I could do it with Murloc Shaman but I'd rather not rely on a 6 wide board and Bloodlust.

Since 12 days, if you were sick for months and still had orders queued (like the previous post about you) why would you have started looking for new orders less than 2 weeks ago?
