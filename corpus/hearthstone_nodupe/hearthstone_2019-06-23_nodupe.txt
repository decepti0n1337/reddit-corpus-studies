Heya, I wrote a reply to a comment on my "finally reached legend" post earlier and it pretty much answered this question.
---
 
---
"My original aim when deciding what deck to use from rank 5 onwards was to beat Bomb Warriors. I came across across tons of them in the rank 8-3 range.
---
I personally found that warriors excel in removing single big threats (shield slam, execute) as well as numerous smaller threats (Warpath &amp; Brawl). Thus i found the trick is to build up 2 or so strong minions through use of the magnetic mechanic and you play around their best cards. I also started focusing on going face whilst being mindful of making solid trades.
---
Leeroy helped close out games and I found that i virtually always lost once warrior hit 10 mana crystals and had the extra effects of cards online (like that 10 damage battlecry) and the discover 3 mechs. So try to close it before 10 turns."

Someone in the chat asked "What card took the most amount of time to make work in the game?" and Mike said that its one of the cards from the next expansion.

Then you have seen a *similar* post. And I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you have to wonder how much is coincidence and how much is by design.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I did the Lich King with a combo as simple as Gurubashi Beserker and some buff cards. And then the divine spirit inner fire for the final punch out.
---
when op doesnt realizes mech hunter consistently wins by turn 6-7
---
Looks really solid for a new deck, nice job man
---
Let me do a quick count here:  
---
* You play Vargoth and take 2 Extra turns. 
---
* During the first extra turn you hit them with Vargoth for 2 and play Mimi's Head + 2 Dummies to make Voltron. 
---
* During the second extra turn, you flip Voltron with Alchemist into an 8/4 Mega Windfury and copy it with Molten Reflection twice and attack face with three 8 attack Voltrons and Vargoth for a grand total of 100 Damage ((32 x 3) + 2 + 2). Or, just enough to remove an Odd Warrior's Armor.
---
Casual hearthstone is just as fun as ever. The pve stuff is awesome. I quit for similar reasons as you right after witchwood released. I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I’ve had upon returning. Another reason I quit was because I had an unhealthy relationship with it. I would get overly frustrated about losses and it was effecting me negatively. I haven’t had that experience since returning.
---
The golden Mimiron’s Head really makes this. Thank you
---
You can just Mirmadon Time Warp. Then alchemist double molten. Vargoth is just BM here.
---
I mean,  sure, but that's not big priest.
---
That is just a menagerie of hot garbage
---
5 + 1 + 1 = ???
---
Nice job, congrats man
---
Thanks man
---
Yeah but who wants to be forced to chat with someone they don’t want to chat with. Like I don’t want to have people BMing me without me being able to stop it. And if you upgrade the feature to have to initiate or accept first, that wouldn’t be any different than just adding someone using the built in feature
---
Kripp also got the exact same zombeast before
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DrabDeliciousPuppyKeyboardCat
---
I wouldn’t overthink it at this point. Your deck, as you built it, should usually have something to do each turn, and has ways to survive and kill your opponent. That means it’s good enough- it does what it’s designed to do.
---
Added spoiler tag so that if somebody hasn't completed the adventure the "final boss" I guess won't be spoiled.
---
I made a 3rd version If you want to see it. I’m currently in bed and can’t post it until tommorow, thanks for the advice so far!
---
There's also check marks for every deck and hero power.
---
Looks like I have a lot to do.
---
Also I got death wing and he’s really good
---
Shvachko#1287 80g trade, you go first I'll show. NA
---
And it's still bad advice, and just plain wrong, for the simple reason that Priest doesn't have any Basic minions except Northshire Cleric, and no Class-based win condition except the Inner Fire/Divine Spirit combo. You'd be dead against every Aggro deck in the game. Priest has always been considered to have the WORST Basic deck in the game.
---
Silence Priest is a reasonable budget deck for someone who doesn't want to play Aggro, but it's still a terrible deck to recommend to an absolute beginner.
---
Wow, such a prolonged BM against an AI. How much did you heal her for in total?
---
Over?
---
nice that's great...
---
Unf.
---
That combo is so crazy I can't believe I'm allowed to play it.
---
because the cards are designed that way
---
Argus for sure. Wisp is a hard no. Raid leader can be good - but you have to plan for it. Try it out and see how it performs for you. Gnomish inventor probably not.
---

---
EliteTech89d#1139
---
No quest, just looking to make game friends
---
8 bananas
---
Especially since Morrigan has a very low cap on iterations. This combo is basically hard-coded not to work.
---
Some older ones:
---
“WHO AM I???” and “HEY EVERRRYONE, GET EEEEN HERRE”
---
If you don't have Zul'jin, you probably have a better deck option instead. Mech Hunter can do exceptionally well with 0 legendaries.
---
&gt;!Even this?!&lt;
---
But basically this minion doubles his attack each time he overkills something, I also had a lot of healing in my deck so I could keep him alive as long as possible. Each minion he put down got 1-shot'ed, and so I kept just doubling his attack until we both ran out of cards. i also overkilled the enemy hero by -20836 and since that also counted as a overkills he doubled his attack to 41672.
---
Thanks for pointing me to the sub. Cheers
---
Will there be more pve content coming out in the second and third expansion of this year? I play the singleplayer stuff in this game a looot, and I need to know if I should be saving my itunes gift card for another paid adventure, or if I should just buy packs now. Thanks!

---
ah fuck
---
Yeah, I know it's not new but it's one of the better ones and more early on than most I've seen
---
and frostbolt didn't do 3, its based off not the exact same
---
You are in mmr hell, you are matched with other low mmr players so your gain per win is minimal, AFAIK nothing changed in that matter recently.
---
You are most likely to win if you are able to stick a really huge mech on turn 9 on the board, because they struggle to deal with it, because they have no Devastator ready.

best beginner deck

---
You underestimate Blizzard's power.
---
Seriously though, Small Indie developers need money, rather not let cheap decks stay.
---
Ahh thx, i never encountered that before.
---
Seems like your offerings to rngesus were lacking. Next time dust a wisp in advance, maybe that pleases him
---
Btw the minion is on the opponent's cards
---
AHA!
---
I mean, I'm not against cheap decks (3 cheap deck are in the Tier 1 rn) but the whole Midrange ME GO FACE Hunter has become so stale and boring, especially the beast version. All Hunter decks since the dawn of time have been the same thing. Curve out, go face or go fuck yourself. Any deck, Beast Hunter, Mech Hunter, Spell Hunter, Secret Hunter... (only deck that kinda doesn't follow that straight line is deathrattle/big hunter)
---
win streaks stop being a thing after a certain rank, it was probably that
---
Any newbie want to be my friend? I have the "challenge a friend" quest that grants us both 80g.
---
You're gonna need to give more details. What rank are you at? Did have a disconnect issue at any point?
---
really? after what rank?
---
Looks like the Farseer hasn't taken a shower in quite some time
---
New player here, pls explain
---
My grandpa's phone has no pathetic apps, Kaiba
---
I am at rank five ( I won got to rank 5 with 2 star) and then I watched that game and went back on my game and only got 1 star
---
really? what rank?
---
There aren't win-streaks at Rank 5.
---
In regular mode the silence isn't automatic, it's her hero power.
---
In heroic it's autocast.
---
And the other minions threw him away cause they couldnt stand the smell
---
Oh ok good to know
---
THANKS
---
Proof that murloc decks cause your brain to atrophy due to lack of use. Seriously? Playing the murloc Lyra generated by the murloc Lyra or saving it for later so you can refill the entire board twice for literally 1 card is an "interesting decision?" What a joke lmao
---
I probably will continue to not play it due to lack of rewards, Naxx was so fun- it’s a shame we don’t get adventures like it anymore.
---
Yeah I’m running a midrange secret hybrid.  Straight midrange beast hunter had me stalled around 7.  I have gotten better at piloting but I think the right secrets takes midrange to another level.
---
Nah it’s a feature to help hint when there’s lethal and direct you towards face
---
I think mage is the hardest. I recommend using kabal lackey and counterspell and restart the game until you get it.

Spudy#1828 Trading 80g quest add in game

Stick with it man.  It’s all about adjusting to the meta quick and dirty and then hitting the play button when you know you’ve found the sweet spot.  Here’s my deck list.
---
Exciting content
---
Thanks man!
---
Eh, I think I’ll be ok. Thanks though!
---
Thanks!
---
I want to try and see if I can break through the meta with silence priest. It seems like a pretty solid deck and probably one of the cheapest right now, it only requires Vargoth and Snip-snap as legendaries, which are both available for everyone.
---
Does anyone wanna do the 80g quest? I need someone. HarisWins #2468 on US.
---
Hi there, I can answer your question about purchasing packs. First of all, as a new player you will need quite a few cards if you want to play with some of the most popular decks. The general strategy you should aim for is to look up some decks that are cheap to make (that don't have much legendaries for example) and are still competitively viable. There are many sites like HSreplay that showcase such decks. Next when you have some decks in mind, you should look at what kind of cards they use and buy packs accordingly. Every 10 packs of a new expansion will give you at least one guaranteed legendary so take advantage of that.  
---
  
---
Then there are 2 packs that are really good to buy for you. Classic packs are always great because there is a "starter deal" of some sorts in the store which gives you classic packs for cheap. Classic cards are always going to be relevant and useful so you can't really go wrong with these, but don't focus only on classic cards. The second great option is Rise of Shadows packs. The RoS expansion is the newest one so these cards will be used for the next 2 years, whereas other expansions will rotate out to Wild in a year.
---
You need Zul'jin, if you can afford it. If you can't, and you're dead set on playing secret or midrange hunter, dust for it. Do whatever you can. It's your entire mid-to-late game. 
---
- 2x Savannah Highmanes. There's better bang for your buck lower down on the mana curve, and you're not running pure beasts so you don't need to overthink this. 
---
- 1x Scavenging Hyena. Just stop.
---
-1 Secret Plan. I think you're aiming for flexibility here (and that's fine) but if I were you I'd just cut the shit and put in a good secret instead. You'll get it back with Zul'jin. If you want a 1 drop that bad, you have shimmerflies and lynxes. 
---
-2x Secretkeeper. It doesn't work as well as you think it does. Too early a drop, too susceptible to silence or removal, and gives away your entire strat.
---
- 2x whatever. Hard choices but you need to make room for:
---
+ 2x Dire Frenzy. Shuffle lynxes, hounds or scalehides into your deck to dilute bombs and for fast, cheap rush/charge and health regen. 
---
+ 2x Vicious Scalehide. See above. 
---
+ 1 Unleash The Beast You'll want this when you play Zul'jin. 
---
+ 1 Zul'jin. The less said abotu this, the better. I hate this motherfucker. That means he's good for you.
---
So how did it go?
---
Get an OTK off. I beat him with Paladin and priest, once with the infinite sound the bells and another with Lyra.
---
tl;dr : "might", "maybe", "in the future"
---
I had no idea this was a thing haha
---
Barnes isn't the *only* thing that makes Big Priest annoying, but it's easily the swingiest card in the deck and feels really bad to lose to. Additionally, if you nerf Barnes and it falls out of Big Priest lists, that reduces the consistency of drawing the minion-cheating cards since the Priest only has 2x Shadow Essence, and makes the aggro matchups several degrees worse since the Priest can no longer cheese wins with Barnes on 3/4 into Statue or some other big taunt they can rez a dozen times. That should be enough to knock Big Priest down at least a tier or two which would push the deck out of the meta enough not to bother the rest of players, while the depraved perverts who actually *like* playing Big Priest will still have a fringe-viable deck to play at rank 5.
---
feelsbadman haha
---
you have space for a weapon's project to tech against aggro, 2 executes and a supercollider to tech against mage, a spellbreaker to tech against mech hunter/paladin and elysiana for the mirror but you can't justify switching 2 of those tech slots to countering the deck which you claim is 50% of your games? cool story bro.  
---
you'd have an easier time against secret hunter with a more minion heavy list to be able to proc the first freezing trap and keep pressure on board to kill them before zuljin but you're missing the most key card to making that happen and the strongest card in a bomb warrior deck: blastmaster boom.
---
have only heard legends of the parting. now it graces me with its presence, thank you
---
this is one of the things that made me leave the game for awhile as weird as it sounds
---
The problem with big priest is that once 1 minion dies, it can not only be resurrected infinite times, but you can rez into the same minion twice. A notable example being that you killed 1 lich king, and on their turn they use 3 rez spells to bring back that 1 lich king thrice.
---
If you want to nerf big priest properly, you need to make it so the spells remove whatever you summon from the list of dead minions even after the summoned minion dies again. Kills big priest without punishing other rez-based decks.
---
your decklist
---
To be fair, it’s much harder to spoof a picture than a screenshot.
---
Seems like u have some aggression problems Bro. Get therapy.
---
Crafty ethereal
---
This line also gave 50% chance of instant loss if the cyclone doesn't give him anything.
---
Scorch first on 3/4 is the most "try not to lose" play, which would have done enough here.
---
Scorch first on the gunspire either leaves a 3/1 or makes hp a 50% lethal and cyclone can roll before you have to choose.

go face
---
Well deserved when you have that much patience
---
What he could have done better is not put himself in the position to be dead on board. His ordering made some
---
So start using Scorch at 3/4. Mana cyclone. You are very likely to get something that deals damage. [Looking at the list below 6 Mana spells](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mage), except for a couple secrets, pyroblast flamestrike, blizzard and a few others, anything else will give him lethal, like Ray of frost, icicle, blastwave, etc. 
---
If he got like elemental evocation or spellbender he would be dead against the 3/4 + zap hero power with his ordering, when could be avoided.
---
a picture of what should be a comment but is now its own post. I must say kudos for creativity
---
Remove necrium blade. That’s useless
---
I reached Legend last season (and always did well against hunter), using variations of Zetalots recent Shadowform/Mind Blast decks. I’m not sure exactly you would go about finding the lists for those. I believe he has posted a few recent YouTube videos of them in use.
---
To a committed murderer in front of cops: Someday I'll be just like you.
---
It’s a treasure in adventure mode that makes all minions that cost more than 5 to cost 5
---
Sorry to intrude in the convo, but it’d suggest checking out some of Regis Killbin’s videos. He’s recently posted about the best cards in RoS, to draft etc
---
"Hey guys, I need advice for A!"
---
"Here's some advice, do B!"
---
I always respect the combo.
---
Exactly. I meant that is a perfect example of the graveyard not working like it does in classic card games. Sorry for the poor wording.
---
Snip snap combo gets drawn almost every game before turn 6, and then it is an easy win. With murlocs you have to control the board and get war leader our there most of the time. Even if you don't get it by 6, you can taunt lifesteal it on 7 or 8 and win that way.
---
All I know is that I tried every variation of murloc decks and none seemed powerful at all, and with snip snap I beat lich king with almost every hero in like 3 hours.
---
It summons a Bolderfist Ogre
---
If it is still pure RNG according to you, why do you still play it? And if not, why are you subbed to Hearthstone on Reddit? Have some fun playing hearthstone also matters! You are one of the people the Hearthstone community should better not have.
---
probably just confirmation bias but in general a weaker player will have an easier time playing a faster deck
---
The hell is your problem lol
---
At an airport : wanna blow something up? Haha!
---
IMO quests and hero cards should always be in rotation BUT their power level needs to be reduced
---
My magic will tear you apart!
---
I didn't lose either. A deck full of Clockwork Goblins pulled with Vim was too much aggro for him.
---
That’s what I’m saying
---
Where did you get the dust?
---
Misclicks and proceeds to pyroblasts his own face
---
From a true story
---
Sorry but I don't care about your satisfaction. I'm trying to win.
---
Stinky
---
In the Rise of Shadows Announcement Trailer, Dave Kosak talked about how the adventure "will take us from flying cities, to ancient depths". Naturally the flying city is Dalaran, but I'm curious if the latter is either up next, or during the 3rd expansion.
---
Whoops!
---
Haha it's like tying a bunch of firecrackers together and like two go off and the rest die in a little pile.
---
I saw a lot of people laughing at the cringe, i think the majority gets it
---
By turn6 you with oblivitron in hand you should also have a welp in hand.
---
So he's basically a better statted welp.
---
And opponents tend to not kill it, which also helps a lot
---
Man, the other day I made a post talking about exactly the same, The resurrect mechanic need a fix and a way to do it is doing a proper graveyard (wich we already have but isn't developed as it). Not being able to resurrect a minion that's already alive, would slow down the power of the deck without killing it, because Big priest is all about Quality &gt; Quantity. 
---
Barnes isn't even the problem and the comunity will lose the chance to make a proper nerf, even if it get nerfed, Big priest will continue to be opressive due vargoth, wich has taken barnes place in many big priest decks (mine included) it feels even better because he doesn't polute the resurrection pool. 
---
the people hated my post.
---
It's not just my experience the deck's bad right now. Kibler's said many times that it's not a good deck in this meta, regardless of how powerful it is.
---
Yea, instead of the cyclone + conjuring giant combo, you run a dragon package Alex, Maly, and the 1 damage wrath dragons, with dragon discover 2 drop.  (which I have found really helps with aggro) 
---
Throw in a blast wave, Blizzard, 2 frost novas, 2 doomsayers and you have the aggro down.
---
2 frostbolts, antonidas, Lunas pocket galaxy and archivist are the backbone for the control / warrior matchup.
---
1 acolyte of pain, 2 arcane intellect, and thanks for draw,
---
2 polymorph and 1 ironbeak owl for mech shenanigans,
---
And finally the heal / taunts (cause you will need em)
---
2 ice barrier, 1 zilliax, 1 phantom militia.
---
And last but not least, your I got nothing else to do, might as well pressure the opponent:
---
1 astronomer, 2 mountain giant, 1 conjurers calling.
---
Yes that is the deck pieces I don't like, but it honestly is really good against certain mech decks.
---
Also using archivist when a warrior has played out all their bombs is hilarious.
---
would you know! I had quite abreak, thanks for clarifying. Kinda stopped on the good ol BRM times
---
Skip to 0:30
---
Overrated reply
---
Wait that still exists in Dalaran Heist? I have yet to see this one lol, thought it was only in Dungeon run and Monster hunt
---
Heh-heh-heh, iz time for a little blood
---
As a new player was wondering what rewards you get from doing the single player content and is it with it in terms of building a decent deck? Thanks guys
---
I had the same thing happen :(
---
This is how I dealth with Khadgar casting 3 Fly-Bys (so 3x 50 damage bombs in my deck. The treasure anomaly backfired a bit). Got one of his elementals with Sylvanas, then cast Ultimate Infection and burned 2 of them. Then 3rd one got burned at the start of the next turn, and Khadgar pulled the 50 damage bomb I put in his deck for lethal.
---
I went for Togwaggle's Dice with full legendaries and it was the easiest heroic ever lol
---
Just sent the request my dude
---
Yesssss.....I loved the mage hero power lowering the cost of a card in your hand and if you get the buff your hero power cost one less and you can use it again each turn wwwwwwoooooooooo that's some hot shit.....much to broken for real gameplay lol
---
in jail
---
What ever happened to this guy? I remember he used to make COD commentary, then his weapon videos used to be huge, all over the front page of YouTube
---
Then discover another pyroblast and use that one to finish them just to rub salt in your opponent's wounds
---
Outjerked again...
---
I don't think stats will happen for simple reason: Blizzard cares a lot about how all the players that are not good at this game feel about self. Over the years they made laddering/doing quests/heroic pve easier. Any stats about winrate would destroy many people illusions.
---
He’s always been a pretty decent card, needs some deathrattle support in the next expansion to be truly nutty.
---
Finally pulled it off :)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHByvrCwSao&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHByvrCwSao&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Because rogue was played way more and those rogue decks had 60-70% winrates. Also not alot of good decks countered rogue
---
There are some treasures common to all of the adventures scepter is one of them
---
I always use discovered cards to get the win if I can, it just adds so much salt
---
Been there
---
People don't like it when you post metastats or hsreplay but if you would check out those sites theyll tell you that Hunter is the highest winrate and the highest popularity by far in the game right now
---
So not sure what you're into.
