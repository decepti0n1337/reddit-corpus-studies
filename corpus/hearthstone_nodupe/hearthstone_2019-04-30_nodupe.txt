I'm honestly surprised this sub wasn't at 1mil already. I never checked and assumed it was past that. Anyway, it's nice to see the game growing!
---
Gz such many people around here
---
Yes i know that. 
---
1. There are many more games played than 2k.
---
2. Every single outcome is equally as likely, there is nothing special about this outcome except the arbitrary patter perception humans project on it, it is a result like every other and ot is the expected result for this to happen once i while.
---
Free things are nice.

I believe what makes this card really powerful is twinspell. The mage deck would run out off resources much quicker if it wasn't. I think those streamers rated this card as if this is just a one off card. They didn't realize how powerful twinspell of this effect.

If your a F2P then mid-range hunter is one of the best decks on the ladder .. If your willing to spend some $ then craft anything you feel like .. 
---
You can make your deck by possibly analyzing your games/ meta and make the changes as you seem fit .. In most decks it's not the legendaries but the epic's that truly break the bank .. 
---
Arena is always good because you have a level playing field most of the times, but remember you need 6-7 wins to go into "infinite value mode"
---
In the end don't craft a card that people are hype about, don't craft a card that everyone says is strong .. IMO craft cards that you see yourself playing most of the time and enjoy the game ..

Hiyah friend
---
Yeah rogue tends to destroy these midrange decks easily, though paladin has a much better time against them imo with secret golem, fiery secret axe, and consecration/equality/shrink ray to fight the early board and control the mid game ones.
---
Make whizbang evergreen!
---
Those sound like cool prizes, especially the art books and clothing!
---
Thats what you get for forgetting nozari, it would have saved you.
---
They're giving away all these knick knacks cuz nobody is buying them. Lol 
---
Just kidding, I hope I win.
---
&gt;because once we start bringing in the mods then everyones line of where they should stop is different.
---
The mods can stop wherever you've drawn the line based on what you've said to me. You said:
---
&gt;Thing is, a large portion sub gets itself lathered up about all sorts of things that it may have had no initial stake in, because outrage is easy. And then you hear the same arguments parroted from comment section to comment section, upvoted based on familiarity.
---
Bam, right here you've summarized the posts that need to be cleared out based on your own experience! If this isn't just baseless conjecture on your part and you can 100% identify the posts that are just circle-jerking, just throw out all of them except the first one on the topic. Easy as that.
---
Throw out every other post so all the "panic button slamming" is contained. No worries about drawing a line. 1 is a simple number. Two is messy, three starts to be a bit much. Confine it to 1, that's that. There's your proposal for the mods: Whenever any outrage or controversy happens, ensure it's confined to one thread. Unless you're talking about senseless outrage. Then just give them the guidelines you gave me above! 
---
And no, I'm not joking. If you truly believe your mindset/ideals here are the most rational ones, then there's no reason to NOT speak up and improve the subreddit for everyone else. Talking to the mods or making an actual post about this is certainly better than responding to me, some random guy on Reddit.
---
It always baffles me when people are dissatisfied to some extent with the way a subreddit plays out, and they'll take however much time to explain those issues to me or others, but then I go to Submitted and I see ZERO subreddit meta-related posts. I'm doing my own part by "complaining" to the person I know can fix things. In this case, it's the person making these comments. And if you are complaining, if you are dissatisfied, if you feel things could be run better, then speak up or shut up!
---
You literally wrote a summary of your rationale for why outrage should be limited, in your response to me. You did like half the work in writing a post or DM to the mods, right there. If you don't want to change things that's fine but you don't need to waste my time writing about something you could put in the effort to changing but choose not to for God knows what reason. If you're not going to make an actual effort, don't waste my time, and don't waste the time of anyone else you reply in comments to.
---
***So to sum up: The mods don't need to consider everyone's line in the sand. Unless you want to admit you're not that rational of a person, your comments in this thread sure indicate you know what you're talking about. And if in talking about the issue of Rexxar you feel so confidently that people "threw a fit", as well as being able to tell when people are just outraged to be outraged, then you seem like a prime candidate to speak on the matter of "containing" these sorts of "panic button" posts. Which is why you should DM the mods and speak up about the issue, if it bothers you that much. Or if it bothers you enough that you feel the need to talk about it to me/anyone else. You could improve this subreddit, if you put in the effort. And if you don't want to put in the effort to even TRY fixing or improving the subreddit, then why keep complaining?***

How are you level 60 on rogue? (Not judging, I' seriously don't understand how you got to that level)

ikr, for once I actually tried and got to rank 10,  but at the same time it was during the grace period of people testing decks at the start of the new year rotation
---
Golden Lorewalker Cho is the best card to ever have existed.
---
Is reno priest or renolock ethical?
---
I dunno if they're that devious. There are way easier ways to monetize than subtle mind fucks lol. They can just sell more hero portraits, deckslots, and other cosmetics.
---
I'm actually super confused why they don't sell more cosmetics. It's like printing money. And people don't feel shitty buying cosmetics
---
Thanks Blizz 😀
---
You could argue that, but in response that in order to get that value you first have to spend the first 4 turns playing the game in a way that,  in my opinion, makes the game less fun.  If there were a card that say rewarded you for effectively controlling the board, I would say that card pushed the game in a more fun and rewarding direction as now the person with that card wants to actively interact with their opponents board.

I lost to a Mage running it recently.  Would’ve had lethal either of the previous two turns if it had been any regular taunt.
---
Cool, thanks for running the giveaway guys.
---
Wow, thanks
---
Congrats to those who get the Legendary scarf or wallet.
---
Well, true that, but 2 random minions *now* might be better than 2 specific minions later. And while Cubelock was going for specific minions for damage burst or to get a million taunts, cube hunter was often going just for value (cubing eggs and the like).
---
And the 'cheat' card that warlock used to get the minions *now* and not later just healed him for a bit. The 'cheat' card mage uses gives them 2 full new minions. That's a lot better than a 4 (or even 8, pre nerf) heal!
---
Haha that’s awesome
---
Ed-u-ward San
---
Good luck, everyone!
---
Sweet a giveaway!
---
Yeah, you have to play the value game instead of tempo, but my problem were these people claiming that murloc shaman is *favored* versus mech/bomb warrior and its variants, when all the matchup data I've seen so far say the opposite. 
---
The amount of warriors have been going down which is great. And the overload package has been working well for me vs rogue. One thing I haven't seen people do is add spirit wolves in their lists. It's really hard for rogue to deal with, and increases the chances of buying enough time to avoid lethal and overrun them with value cards.
---
Heh, greetings!
---
Why am I never F****** lucky?!
---
weee, rng!

Regardless of the outcome, I'd like to say that it's awesome to have so many in the community, now.

Best advice I can give is find which hero you like best and look up “Budget ____ Decks Rise of Shadows” and that should give you a solid deck list which won’t cost much dust to craft. This is how I ended up progressing when I first started about 8 months ago. Hunter is my go to, try it out if you are still figuring out which you like. Good luck!

WOOOOOOAAAHHHHH! LEEEEEEGENDARY!
---
Good luck, everyone :)
---
Yeah without healing from applebaum and deranged doctor the deck is unplayable. I can’t count the number of times I was in a bad spot but got full clear and a huge heal. One of the best combos is getting betrug to stick by getting safe for the free taunt and then playing rafaam for free legendaries played every turn. It has the same feel as constant delivery drones into omega devastator. I feel like it’s on the same meme level as something like bomb warrior and if the meta shifts just right it would be good (like how the current control centered meta allows for bomb warrior to be good). The current popularity of archivist does make the hakkar combo sometimes feel like a lot of work for like maybe 1-2 procs but it’s still lots of fun and stands up decently enough. I’m something like 19-20 on my current deck according to my deck tracker at around rank 12-13 which I know isn’t super high but still it’s the only deck I’ve played since the expansion and I started at rank 18.

In the Resources section you should mention the HS discord and tell players to join and ask questions if they need further help in the #newbie-advice channel
---
In the Tutorial and First Quests section you should include the Recruit A Friend system.  
---
&gt;Recruit A Friend: Ask a friend or someone from discord/reddit for a referral link when you start the game. Only players with less than 20 levels in total across all classes can be recruited so do this as early as possible. (Rewards: 1 Card Pack)
---
Also you should replace the best deck links from hearthstonetopdecks with links to [VS](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/deck-library/hunter-decks/) or [HSreplay](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;gameType=RANKED_STANDARD). hearthstonetopdecks.com seems to be quite outdated; none of the decks in any link is from Rise of Shadows, they are all from Rastakhan.
---
You can have intuitive and consistent game rules without hard coding anything. Probably not anymore with hearthstone because of some old inflexible decisions but stop acting like the way this is designed makes sense. Consistent does not mean good. I don't see how you can't see that this is fucked, whether you can explain the interaction or not.
---
On to 2,000,000! Thanks for an awesome game, Blizz!

Cheers!

I already know how it works shithead. I'm not arguing whether you can make sense of it I'm arguing that this is bad design and you are all doing mental gymnastics to justify it. Just because you can explain something from a code point of view doesn't mean it makes sense.

I play tempo rogue with 3 card mechathun otk for warrior counterque, walk the plank (usefull vs giants if needed), wanted okay removal, Mecha (dead draw). You can still win vs other classes and up your winrate vs warrior goes up a lot. Just make sure to get the combo ready, once you have it use leeroy for removal and just bm as much as possible.

The average winrate of all Warlock decks compared to the average winrate of the decks of all other classes places the class as a whole at bottom 3. That doesn't necessarily mean that you lose most of the time with Zoolock, because that particular deck is actually quite good. It's just that things like Shufflelock exist that are fun to play, but pretty bad really. It brings down the average class winrate of warlock by quite a bit.
---
Yep, maybe change it's cost to 7, cause its like casting frost nova and consecration in the same card.

Hahah thanks! I've tried in wild, but no luck yet. I used to disenchat EVERYTHING when it rotated. It's really screwing me now. At least it's forcing me to get creative
---
Control Warrior &gt; any other control deck
---
And since it's so strong/popular right now, it shuts down every other control style of deck.
---
It's kinda boring that only Warrior has anything to say in the "control" archetype, because why play another control style deck, if you lose to warrior every time after a 30+ min game?
---
Your flair makes me wonder how good of a mom Frost Lich Jaina would be.
---
Blink Fox swag!
---
Okay, now i see what you meant.
---
yolo
---
I'm sorry if that came out bad, but I was just really happy at the situation at hand. Like the chances of getting Dr.Boom Mad Genius and Shield Slam from the Blink Foxes were extremely low so I was just happy it turned out that way.
---
Don't do it. I'm playing since 1 1/2 years and just recently started wild. You can have a lot of fun witj somewhat cheap decks
---
any way to turn it off?
---
Nice Guys !
---
This is great! But is it just me, or is the image quality somewhat low?
---
Wow been wishing for the art of hearthstone book! Thanks
---
Well... I hope Ben Brode will let my win...
---
I know but that's rather late-game than early, on turn 3 it's still just a 1/5 that is easy to deal with, and early game is all this deck needs. Zilliax is way more game-swinging as a magnetic taunt late game. But I can't deny that the gatekeeper can also win games on its own.
---
In!
---

Sometimes the game just stops mid way through and the only way to restart it is to close the app.
---
Cool stuff!
---
I always homebrew my decks. There may be combos and synergies that match meta decks but most of the fun in card games to me is building my own deck. I’m with you, I have NO IDEA how people copy paste a code onto their deck list and say they are having fun. It’s clear they haven’t played any other card games. That or they are worthless degenerates who play aggro, which are most if not all net deckers.
---
Yee haw
---
That's the point it's not necessarily a bug.
---
I've also made that mistake. Half asleep lizard brain took over. "Me want litch king dead. Me play vodoo doll. Me hero power litch king.... Why litch king no dead?"

Pirate warrior is much harder to pilot than any standard deck right now so I dont know why you would say that?

One question: Is Hunterace now the winner from 2018 or 2019? ;)
---
This post reads as “waaaaah I couldn’t beat hunter until he was able to play all his two spells and his 10 mana hero card, please remove the card from the game because I’m so shit that I give him free turns to set up for it”.

I enjoy prizes this game and fun
---
Playing too fast, Netflix show just got really good, gf wanted to play a few turns. Lots of ways for this to happen.
---
Cool! Thanks guys!
---
I wonder if it's worldwide shipping
---
Anyways, good luck everyone
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Judging from his past comments, his social life consists of living vicariously through streamers and typing twitch emotes on r/LivestreamFail 
---
He also despises aggro hearthstone players and will call most of them retards but yet he plays a hero in league that's often perma banned in ranked due to his power level in solo q
---
What a weird fella
---
If its not intended its a bug thats it and im pretty sure there is a "bug team" thats supposed to fix these things
---
That part is simply something I was/am unclear on. Feel free to point out any mechanic in hearthstone it is inconsistent with though. Until you manage that, my hypothesis is leagues ahead of the people saying "its a bug because... uh... reasons".
---
But I've actually since solved that one I think. I believe that "absolute cost" auras are higher priority than "relative cost" ones, when applied in the same step. Its consistent with how naga sea witch worked to my knowledge.
---
Even if kalecgos didn't get priority though, literally everything I said would still be correct.  I'm not defending blizzard, I'm simply calling out people for being wrong, which they are. 
---
They tried to explain how they think these two auras should work, and I gave very good examples of why they don't and couldn't work like that.
---
&gt;How is this predictable if you can't even explain why Kalecgos gets priority?
---
If everything I personally couldn't explain in hearthstone was a bug we'd be in trouble.

How long can this go on?
---
Playing on the phone shouldn't matter. You still get friend requests no matter how you play.
---
Perhaps you're not playing decks that are cancerous enough to get total strangers to call you racial slurs? Or not top-decking enough?

I think they mean in-game or in-mobile-app. Since a lot of people only play Mobile, they're never on the Battlenet launcher and may not even have it on their computer.
---
I've played my fair share of cancerous decks ngl, but only when I really need to climb ladder
---
Well, at most physical card game tournaments, there is a time limit on a round. At least at official Yugioh events, its forty minutes. As such having some reasonable turn limit, which ninety turns is reasonable for almost all cases, is fine, and ladder is a competitive environment.
---
I love you
---
Awwww yeah! I'm in!
---
Swag
---
nerf please. should be at least 5 mana.
---
That is how chuds say 'I love you'. Verbal violence is their only experience of intimacy.
---
...Or stop trying to stall games.
---
I gotta be honest, I thought this was a copypasta til I read the replies
---
You wouldn't beleve how many Hakkars I pulled from heavy metal, and it's really hard to hold on to it with 20+ armour for dozen of turns.
---
 *Unity. Precision. Perfection.*
---
"all his twinspells" are removal cards :P so him playing them makes the game last longer :)
---
we cant all play aggro decks like you i guess
---
No you didn't ;)
---
I like winning free stuff by RNG!
---
5-5s and dire frenzy
---
So funny, post the same shit every 5 minutes fool
---
I had a guy play a Big Rez Priest deck. I was playing Shudderwock Jade Shaman (this was in wild). He summoned at least 5 Rags the whole game but I was still able to beat him after I played Shudder. He told me "Nice RNG win" yet I had played no RNG cards. I tried asking what he meant, but he had already dropped me from my friends list. Also, this was in casual.
---
"Its a bug because... uh... I said so"
---
vs
---
"Its actually consistent with every other aura in the game, this is the expected outcome if we apply the same rules we know to exist elsewhere in the game"
---
And you have a problem with the second one?
---
You literally have like 4 posts complaining about all kinds of different things so I’m gonna guess you just don’t know how to play the game
---
Always noggenfogger he’s basically yogg if you have a board of minions and low health
---
It's not at all, that's a draw combo so it makes sense you want to run all of that, it would just be bad to only run part of the combo even if there were some less weapons in the meta. And thief Rogue (assuming you mean espionage) is pretty good vs Warrior regardless so at least you can spank him for his insolence.
---
I accept every single friend request hoping to see this message immediately after.
---
Love to see you guys giving back to the community
---
Wow so creative. Hey look you could do so much more with your life but you decide to be one of many fucking retards that spam the subreddit for TWO FUCKING DAYS with the same stale meme.
---
I hope you are proud of yourself. You could've picked up the trash outside or help someone get their shit together. But nah, you decide you go on the internet and just spam the same fucking dumb picture as everybody else for internet recognition.
---
SO COOOOOOOOL BRO
---
This is like playing a game of Rock Paper Scissors .
---
Tempo rogue is like scissors and bomb warrior is like rock.
---
You’re highly unfavored in the matchup.
---
Sucks that your win con was working so well for you though.
---
That’s where I get it the most! Those tryharding to get to legend who lose to my home brew Jank can’t handle it well
---
1 million thanks or 1 million subs!!!
---
For all the efforts you put in this sub :-)
---
It's the least we can do when giveaways are up,
---
Everyone keep smiling, Mods cheer us up!!
---
Yeah that's my thought too. If they give a salty, over the top response like OP, man I live for those moments. It just makes the win 10x better. If they say good game and that we played well and it was fun? That's also a great outcome. I've had games where I was super salty by a close loss and my opponent adds me and turns out to be a great guy. Then you know you have a good person on your friends list, not someone who calls others "fags" after losing a game.
---
I haven't had any major issues apart from tabbing on phone triggering a tiny dc.

Got my iPhone 8 yesterday and whenever I play hearthstone, the screen will blur from time to time. Apple support says this is a problem with the developers but does anyone have or know of any fixes?
---
Almost cheesed it with Mechathun from crown but I had one tog in hand I couldn’t play
---
Huh. I’ve prolly played 2-300 games there. Funny then that I’ve never seen it.
---
Let's try this
---
Free stuff! Good luck
---
sounds like you need to have a nap.
---
I play on US servers, maybe that’s the reason
---
I love free stuff! Especially from blizzard, touches my little nerdy heart!
---
They just want to practice or do quests without altering their rank. Top tier =/= your best deck. If you played zoo and nothing else for 100 games you'll be better at zoo than at anything else no matter zoo is in the meta.
---
Maybe they’re testing out the decks to see if it’s viable in ranked. If it absolutely decimates some unsuspecting victim in casual, they use it in rank because it’s too OP for casual. That’s how I operate anyways. If I lose with a deck in casual, it’s certainly not for ranked. Or maybe they’re just trolling/smurfing
---
r/fuckwarrior

Congrats and TY for the contest.

Good luck all!

Surprised there’s not like 4/4 jade

i do coin prep in the last tavren brawl :0
---
Toki has tangled the timelines!
---
Never thought of that. 3 mana take another of your opponents minions with sylvanas in hand again. Playing necromechanic with nine lives seems busted. Take 2 minions for 3 mana

Ive been playing plot twist warlock to see if i can get betrug and hakkar to trigger with plot twist. Won every game in casual. Played at rank 4, got hakkar trigger and made a warlock mechathun to concede. Laughed my ass off
---
Tag it NSFW just for fun
---
&gt;the
---
Yes!
---
Great good luck to everyone 👍
---
To be clear, I believe the turn limit is referring to the actual hard cap on the number of turns a game can go...not the turn duration timer (rope).
---
This is the one!!! i really need a wallet or a hoddie :P
---
This was the main deck I used. I also have a dragon control and a dragon elemental combination deck. Cards like elementary reaction, bog slosher, and Electra can be cut for more anti-aggro cards like pyromancers and the like. I just wasn't running into those so I put in more value.

Welcome back!

Give it to me baby!

Go Blizzard, keep those cards coming!!
---
A new Hearthstone item would be really nice.
---
Leeroooooy!
---
Yay Hearthstone, time to swag up.
---
I'm in charge now!
---
Very nice
---
Random effects first my man
---
Thank you for doing this. Good luck everyone!
---
What are some must craft legendaries for the new meta?
---
All hail maboi Anduin.
---
Very nice!
---
That's vastly incorrect. Warrior is a powerhouse against the majority of the field, save for Mech Hunter. To think that Warriors will reduce in number when Rogue gets nerfed is goofy. If anything, the 30% of ladder that plays Rogue will now join the 30% of ladder that plays Warrior, resulting in a 60% Warrior meta, aka the p2w dream.
---
Let's not kid each other. Warrior is meme tier. I'm not knocking it, I play it, but I'm not trying to pretend it's not broken. If I draw boom pre turn 7, I win, unless you're a mage. The end.
---
Everyone get in here!

---
By the holy light!
---
Congratulations on passing such a huge mark!
---
I will win for sure
---
Acornbearer, Whispering woods, landscaping, and dreamway guardians.  Basically, cards that out multiple cheap creatures out to immediately start pressure and be buffed.
---
I'm in.
---
Yuhu i won :)
---
Right? I ignore pretty much all other content due to how low effort it is. Most of the content is people jerking themselves off over them playing the cards in their hand.
---
Such a small community but with a heart so big
---
Thats a cold one.
---
It's pretty cool that you're doing this giveaway.
---
OP is the bad guy because, while busted, the mage is at least trying to play the game. The warrior is trying to do as little as possible, while trying to prevent the mage from playing the game.
---
Control play is degenerate and hated in every card game that's ever existed, this is nothing new.
---
Men’s wallet would be great
---
I'm in!
---
Beeg Yoshi
---
Is Myra’s totally necessary? I have everything else on the list, but I’m missing Myra’s. Any good replacements for it? I could craft it but idk how I feel about crafting it just for pogo rogue

cupcakes :D

top level comments rewarding free stuff, count me in.
---
Hype lol
---
Good luck everyone!

For sure!

Yeah!

Any tips for playing Zoo Warlock with Rafaam?
---
thank you!
---
Prizes
---
I would rock that swag until the day I die. 🤪
---
I gained 57 life yesterday through an amazing sequence of cards. 
---
Akali the rhino buff into zilliax, play that new 2/2 mech that gives armor for the damage it deals, and the new spell that gives a minion the cleave effect. Opponent had exactly 3 minions on board. 
---
Drop the 2/2, magnetize zilliax, cast the spell, clear the board and a full heal x2
---
Hell yeah
---
Free stuff? Thats second only to Malorne in terms of value.
---
A big congratulations from all of us over at /r/customhearthstone. Despite the "quirks" of this subreddit, we wouldn't have existed in the first place and definitely wouldn't have grown as quickly (we'll catch up one day! :p).

Good luck to all
---
If I win I will craft 100 Golden 4 Mana 7/7 &lt;3
---
I need the wallet!!! :D

I'm glad Gonk is getting some love

f2p btw

Gimme!

Good luck.
---
lol!
---
Let me top deck Leeroy!
---
Well this is cool. Thanks, Blizz!
---
But at least in tournament play, “Elysiana into turn limit draw into win by life total” is a valid strategy at the moment so a burst of 30 armor could be a win condition in a tournament.
---
Hey, for anyone from Vermont Maryland North Dakota or Connecticut, you cant join. It says it in the rules.
---
Wow great!
---
Fingers crossed!
---
I will fight with honor!

just trying my luck

Stuff!

Patches got patched pretty quickly

Thanks Blizzard! *fingers crossed*

At the beginning of your turn, shuffle 10 RAM into your deck.  When you draw a RAM shuffle 10 RAM into your deck and draw a card.
---
Just participating so RNG can fuck me royally again
---
Mrglgrgl
---
Ill take whatever :)
---
Woop woop!
---
Because Bliz want to promote standard so people have to buy new cards to keep up. On the brighter side the meta does change more frequently. 
---
Financially speaking, standard is for the rich kid, wild is much cheaper in the long run.
---
Nice one but still cheering for Thanos
---
Does the art book include the drawing of the favorite card?
---
Great promotion!
---
Murloc main let's go!!!!!
---
Let's do this!
---
Welcome to the new RNG game!
---
Thanks!
---
lofasz
---
I want a cool thingie, thanks blizzard
---
Not exactly, since after turn 90 both players explode....
---
I just subscribe for the loot :)
---
That’s how it was. Now when I reply it just tells me I lost due to disconnect.
---
 I did this for awhile too. Ultimately, I decided adding an extra bounce for Elysiana was more useful/consistent in the mirror. Could have been a tilt-influenced decision though---I drew scheme late in a couple matches when I needed it and lost a game when Hecklebot pulled Elysiana but she survived until my turn and I didn't have bounce to save her.
---
This is the opposite of what I wanted to accomplish.
---
Wow. Just a comment?
---
Only way to learn how to win is to play. Meta changes enough by people teching in cards against certain archetypes. There always also a chance the warrior draws badly. 
---
If you have the time, might as well be worth it.

Blizz are you planning on doing anything to Baku and Genn in wild. They are still sort of a problem there and I would also like to know what are your plans on improving wild. A lot of cards are very unbalanced and un-fun to play against (Barnes).
---
Wahoo new Apple Watch background. Now I need to change the background to black.
---
Comments dont always generate value!
---
I doubt it's any good
---
 Unnerf Patches or give me a hoodie! Congrats of the million subs!
---
You're not wrong and shouldn't be downvoted.
---
It would never be supported.  That seems like the most frustrating and boring archetype to ever queue into.
---
I mean there used to be only 9 deck spots
---
The update for the store should go live around the same time the next adventure comes out. This did create a small gap where new players wouldn't have access to these old adventures, sorry about that!
---
Let me win bc I lost at life
---
I exclusively play on mobile and I can say from experience it's not Blizzard's fault with this, it's either your phone or your carrier, more likely the latter. I was playing on an old TracPhone and their service. DC'd all the time. Got a new phone and I'm on Sprint and I don't have issues unless I'm in a spot with shitty signal or if I'm on our WiFi, because we've got base package. I can say that when I had my shitty phone, I never had to close out of the game during a disconnect, so that's probably something with your phone.
---
woo HS
---
4 / 7 / 7 🙂
---
Oh boy, free stuff! Alright, gimme some Hearthstone swag. I want the world to see my superior power at playing virtual children card games!
---
Give out 25 prizes. (Targets chosen randomly)
---
swag pls
---
Is this a top-level comment?
---
Yeah, but you can only have 1 of those.
---
That's the first thing I think every time I see that card and I don't even play decks with lackeys. Haha
---
Hola amigos
---
I just wish the deck we're more consistent. It needs a few buffs/reworks
---
good luck !
---
Yeah I’m moving over to competitive hearthstone. Not as big but better quality stuff and moderation.
---
For freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!

hello\~ hello\~

&gt;To put it simply there isn’t much of a community in the game for me anymore.
---
I've made a lot of new friends through Battlefy when joining tournaments. It's easy and you can meet others who are passionate about the game.
---
Aslo, when I'm in casual or rank floors, I reach out to people playing interesting decks and make friends with them. I will occasionally challenge them to a best of 3. Since they only play non-meta decks, you get some new ideas for deckbuilding (and can complete quests in the process).
---
If you make the effort, you can have an active friends list of players.

I've been playing hearthstone for many years now and though there's been some ups and downs I'm so glad for all the work everyone puts into the game, thank you and congratulations!

Congrats on 1 million! And good luck to everyone!

Hello There

Well that's awful nice of Blizzard.

Oh i just saw big priest and thought "oh I hope I never see that"
---
1. There are always going to be filler cards.
---
2. Just because elemental synergy doesn’t work now doesn’t mean it won’t work a couple of expansions from now. More cards will get printed that may help with these synergies in later expansions.
---
Fingers crossed.

Greeting from Norway. I chose Hunterace as my champion... let's see if this luck streak continues.

I wish you were giving away my favorite card, it's called Blink Fox! It's really cute and I love it.

---
These posts get downvoted, but posts with the same stupid Blink Fox get upvoted.
---
 Starting to feel like the Blink Fox meme is being pushed so hard to prevent the inevitable "nerf rogue/warrior/elysiana" posts that will soon arrive.
---
Well ok i'll just put in an [[Ancient mage]] instead for the spirit of the shark-&gt;shadowstep-&gt;9 damage fan synergy. ^^/s

---
Yes, you are right. However this deck has a ton of variations: cold bloods, fan of knives, the togwaggle package, the burgle package, you could even tech in zilliax. I didn't even knew of the Life drinker inclusion before today, and I just gave it a go, not even expecting to get near Legend this season.
---
I just added the deck code for people who are interested in the exact card choices.
---
Wtf were they thinking with khadgar.  One of the most stupid high roll decks we've seen in years.
---
Shadowstep should probably be replaced with cold blood, but yeah. Still, having a good deck doesn't automatically get you to legend. This particular deck, while strong, is not as easy to pilot as it might seem. There are quite a few decisions to make at various stages of any game depending on match ups and board state. There's also a point where you have to do a 180 and shift from board control to face. That particular point in the game varies and if you miss it, you get rolled.
---
Not everyone can take a deck, even the highest win rate deck, and take it to legend.
---
What do we know about Zayle so far?
---
I understood that reference!
---
I think the front page being plastered with Blink Fox memes is another concerted effort to prevent topics such as this to reach the front page of r/hearthstone.
---
It won't work. Nerf Rogue/Warrior threads are coming.
---
Here's to another million!

Yaay!
---
Arcanosaur was pretty good in Elemental Mage in the RR meta. Rotation obvious hurt such decks, particularly the loss of [[Fire Fly]] and [[Tar Creeper]], but Elementals have been in the game since the beginning.
---
Soo... Infinite turn instead of fatigue?
---
Mind if I roll need?

Hi, i love hearthstone, i've been playing for 4 years now and i really enjoy my time around.

Why do I even need to sub to r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
I'm so happy shaman is good again.

Cheers! :P
---
jhghgh dunno what to write

Hopefully I can get a shirt with the art of my favorite card!

I hope they silenced one so you kill off that one first.  
---
That was one of my favorite things in Naxx.

Wild is the superior format :^)
---
Busy night... but there's always room for another!
---
"Infinite board clears" = 4. None of which are actually full clears in many situations. Well proven.
---
I'm not that fast. When I'm about to deal lethal, I say Well Played and then do it. Just as a way to say good game, in time so that the opponent will see it and has a chance to respond. Never any BM intended. And I think it's the same for most people.
---
Awesome!
---
Thanks Blizz! Good luck everyone!
---
Count me in!!
---
Khadgar being 2 cost...while cc being only three sets up stupid possibilities too early to reasonably counter.
---
Woot, I would love some Hearthstone swag!

You forgot the humour tag

This is just incredible lol. Some good stuff coming out of these 'shitposts'

don't apologize, it's just a game dude, you can't be responsable of people tilting over an emote, that was indeed an extremely rare situation by the way hehe.

---
To be fair mech hunter has been at least tier 2 in wild since Boomsday thanks to GVG mechs. And without support in future sets (and I doubt Blizzard will print more) it will almost certainly be taken back out of the meta with healing and board clears meant to take the power level of rogue down.
---
Those who've seen the expansions have consistently described it as "Dungeon Run/Monster Hunt+++" and considering that I think it's pretty obvious there'll be buckets. I certainly hope it's not another adventure that requires you to bring your own cards, because those were frankly never fun from the start.
---
+1 for me
---
That's why i kinda miss Bloodreaver Gul'dan despite hating DK cards. His "Nicely done." emote never felt like a BM towards me.
---
I dunno, the way he says it sounds a bit sleek and graceful.
---
My friend told me arcanosaur was bad and a more expensive version of dusk breaker but I insisted it was useful because of jaina life steal. Two weeks later I’m watching him play and he has 2 in his deck lol. We both enjoyed elemental mage &amp; shaman decks before rotation :D
---
Thinking about my moves won't change fundamental flaws of the game, though. As I said, when you like Control Matchups you get the same rewards for a 45 minute game as you'd get for a 3 minute stomp. That's already bad design.
---
Then you got the costs of the decks. Controldecks often cost 5 digit dust numbers while aggressive decks are cheap af. Another reason why aggressive decks are always more popular.
---
And overall the absurd time you have to invest to reach legend so the game starts to become fun is sad. The game should be fun all the time but it's not right now because 90% of the opponents play as if I don't even exist.
---
I know I could just quit the game but after playing since beta I got a bit attached to the game and it has soooo much potential but Blizzard is just not doing anything with it, that it's just sad.
---
Huzzah
---
3/5?
---
Again, in my experience the above strategy allows you to go toe to toe with warrior into the endgame, and forces them to have a really good elysiana/omega assemblies to win. Give it a shot yourself, though. My sample size is still pretty small and it's entirely possible that I was playing incorrectly and just getting lucky.
---
I hope I win!

Fuck yeah, Blizz splashing the cash these days, thanks for caring about the reddit.

Oh I didn’t see any of those descriptions. I agree if it’s a monster hunt kind of deal bringing your own cards would suck. I didn’t like koft either

This has at least been the impression I got this month - there is no really no "safe" rank except for dumpster legend. Play casual and its people playing ladder meta decks missing one or two cards to do quests. Play ranked anywhere but dumpster legend and you fight people who have no clue how to play but crafted tempo rogue.
---
If you want to actually experiment with cards and fight people not playing degenerate aggro rushdown decks you need to be in 2000+ legend rank. Its the only safe haven.
---
Hoodie aficionado at your service.
---
Theres no thought about this... its natural... signs of disrespect are avoided by following social discourse.
---
It is way more modest for the loser to say well played first in any context not just hearthstone. 
---
The only time a "well played" from the winner isnt bm is after a real life confrontation where emotions can be read on peoples face.
---
On the internet well played first from winner goes agaisnt social discourse.
---
Here's Hoping
---
Thank you =)
---
And the cards were done at this point in that production cycle. Doesn't mean we expected those early and I didn't see anyone saying they were dragging their feet for waiting to release the cards until when they said they were going to release it. They've set a schedule and given a reason for why they're doing it. Until they dont meet one of those expectations, I don't get what the bitching is about.
---
But it makes no fucking sense.  In all games, video or real, saying well played at the end of the match is interpreted as a compliment to your opponent.  Interpreting it in any other way is just overly sensitive.  If long time players have developed non-intuitive meanings for various emotes then how are new users supposed to know that?
---
I agree. Odd paladin was insane but I’m usually playing control mage so odd pally was a good matchup for me. The worst for me was odd warrior as well.
---
AwoooAwooo
---
I find that not bm but trickery. The difference between wellplayed before recieving turn and after &gt;&lt;
---
;D
---
we need a tourney mode, i tired af of ladder, so boring, same thing over and over...something like arena but with a standard and wild decks , its so much fun when youre giving the best of you trying to build new decks and in the end you receive  a really decent reward. Thats my opinion, after a couple of weeks the game became monotonous again. Why is it so hard for them to make a tourney mode, like those in tavern brawl.
---
Turtles
---
Justice demands retribution!
---
He can, but only at low ranks or high rolling a Talanji. 
---
Low ranks will tend to trade a lot, making it likely that you will be at a comfortable 30-15 hp. The only decks that should be allowing this is control or combo. 
---
The talanji high roll will close out aggro and mid range decks in one swoop, but can be particularly effective if you play out all the removal like both brawls from warriors or mass hysteria from priest.
---
Yeah I like stuff!
---
Nice! Count me in :)
---
Any tips for the control Shaman matchup?
---
Darkest Hour is more degenerate than giants were in wild, its really bad there.
---
Totally high roll, but that doesn't stop how unfun it is in the same way Big Priest Barnes into Y'shaarj into Rag is a totally non-interactive auto loss without something ridiculous like devolve, and then you are just giving your opponent a random 9 and 7 drop to tempo you down with.
---
Currently climbing at rank 7 in wild with a ridiculous quest, mana cyclone, arcane giant miracle mage! Hearthstone is an awesome game that keeps on giving!!
---
You sound like you know what you're talking about so I'ma take your word for it. Do you think we're limited to 18 decks because of technical reasons or game design reasons?
---
Well Played Blizzard!
---
Very cool.
---
Hello! Hello! Hello!
---
Yeah - this is my feelings as well
---
I'm still trying to get legend :'(
---
Imagine some dude wins 10 grand on a slot machine and meanwhile this poor bastard got a “hmm, what a wacky coincidence” hearthstone screenshot from the same roll of the dice
---
Tempo rogue feels a tinge oppressive to me just because it only has one counter and the counter takes 15 minutes to win by just depleting their resources where two bad draws can still lose you the game.
---
I also had the pleasure of queueing into a tempo rogue the other day running the normal build with Nomi and 2 shadowsteps, and I honestly think that build probably gets a positive winrate against control warrior because you don't play around it yet and even if you did the wide midgame boards can kill you without brawl.
---
I've been playing around Rank 3 and am really stuck in a morass of lackey rogues and bomb hunters. There is also a smaller tier of Summoner Mage, Token Druid, and a spectrum of Control Warrior decks. I did run into a single Secret Paladin and a single Murloc/Aggro Shaman the other day. That was nice.
---
I like the board-based combat, but it does feel like a couple decks are really taking over everything. This may also be a problem since Rogue and Hunter are both relatively cheap, so there isn't much barrier to entry. Yes, I know that I've found myself marooned in the most anti-fun part of the ladder.
---
I agree :D also a manner developped if you played sports/competitve things growing up. Not on the internet :D
---
Swag me baby!
---
Oger love

Big shaman is one of my favorite decks in standard right now! :)

but how many time it lose you game?

I don't want to spoil it but aggro players love aggro, combo players love combo, control players love combo, and midrange players love midrange decks.

---
Aw shit, here we go again
---
The way I see I see it if you Well Play when you lose its good sportsmanship, if you Well Play if you're gonna win it's BM.
---
You only give someone a "well played" or "gg" sincerely if you care about them. Logically, it follows that you should take into consideration how they will probably interpret your sign of intended goodwill. In Hearthstone and video games, there is a lot of disrespect and egoism, which makes sincere congratulations harder, but not impossible.
---
GGing as the loser is very safe; GGing as the winner can easily be misinterpreted, even if your intentions are good.
---
It's similar to handshakes, smiles, and eye contact across different cultures. In the southern USA, these things are often interpreted as friendly. In many other countries, the same actions are incredibly rude, and if you want to actually be friendly, you understand this and conform to the social norms of the region. Otherwise you are an asshole who doesn't care about others or an idiot who is too dumb to understand the local culture.

---
Have you looked in crafting?
---
DO NOT TAKE CANDLE! MIIIIINE! MIIIIINE!
---
An improved arcane intellect I’d say..
---
Its in wild its not gone just select ungoro set in your collection you will see it. 
---
You can play it on wild duel or wild constructed.
---
no,hes the one facing this luck(look at the board state) so i imagine hes not really that lucky
---
Woot free stuff
---
no,thats the opponent
---
I never win anything.
---
Thanks for the giveaway
---
Sweet...
---
Just gimme packs and it will be ok
---
wild is aslo cheaper in long run, and even if you dont play wild i recomend atleast keeping some cards (like ui,the dk's and legendary weapons and some others) just incase they ever get changed/nerfed and if isnt you still have some of storngest cards for clas in wild for brawls and what not.
---
Wooo! Deck me out in nerd gear, please, Blizz!
---
I won't win anyway :&lt;
---
Hearthstone still going strong!
---
Jeez man. This is a community after all, be nice with people that want to help you!
---
I hadn’t seen eviscerate yet and I was on four health before I CC’ed a Rotten Applebaum, I couldn’t play around both that and a Leroy play (assuming I got the grave horror taunt from it), that was my reasoning
---
That's really sweet actually!
---
This is how stale the game becomes. We are already in wait for next expac mode.
---
This game needs new content that is more than just new sets
---
Stuff
---
Cool! Good luck everyone!
---
Yeah, I can't even see him there or do I have to switch crafting to wild somehow?
---
Yep, he played captain greenskin for 0 mana and +1 on dagger, plus Leroy. Quite silly but never mind!
---
Boom!
---
Helllllll yeah free stuff &lt;3
---
I like the expansio, just scared about nerfs once they come, cause i got feelong they wil go druid route and kill of multiple rogue/warrior classic cards(prep,edwin,shadowtsep,bacstab i fear most) when they just had to chance to hof it. But else i like the expansion.
---
The fun or unfun playstyles and archetypes are a thing of preference, but yes
---
Archivist Elysiana was meant to be a crazy card with the unexpected results (something like Renounce Darkness but not exactly) and it's sad to see the card being abused as a forever play for Control decks. And what I think really pisses people off is that this card with bounce  effects essentially becomes an infinite value generator. Which was the sole reason why people waited for rotation that much. Everyone were happy that we won't see Odd Warrior was going to rotate out because they didn't want to play against an infinite armor strategy they knew they couldn't out value, and now we got a fatigueless strategy that people know they can't out value
---
Does any of this make sense?
---
Sure but overall win rate most likely will be lower.
---
(Hsreplay statistics)
---
Nice!
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/7/token-druid#tab=matchups  
---
token druid's worst matchup is zoo warlock  
---
their only other bad matchup is nomi priest  
---
in my experience playing token druid it feels very unfavored against khadgar dragon mage but according to hsreplay it is favored
---
Everyone, git in here!
---
This has far to many upvotes, respect isn’t about acting in tune to your opponent if that was the case and they used this same rule everyone would just be a dick to each other. 
---
I wish I could win a game and also just be a cool person but I guess that doesn’t add up. I “well played” after every game no matter what.
---
I don't mind it. It's not like people post the same thing. They put effort in every post. It's fun
---
This post and people upvoting it is itself a circlejerk and is also not useful.
---
Irony like this is why the other sub exists at all, to mock the posts and people of this sub who think the content here is somehow useful and actually funny shit that is against the rules is not useful.
---

---
If you can't see him in crafting, then you haven't switched your deck to wild yet
---

---
WHAT? Lambo would never do this. I'm crying and shaking right now.
---
Wooo
---
Yaayy lets goooo
---
That's an interesting suggestion and I wouldn't mind experimenting with it. Don't underestimate the 1/1 that the hogsteed leaves behind, though. That 1/1 means you're OK playing it out on T2 (going first) against rogue or druid, since a dagger/punch leaves a body behind. Even in matchups where mastif might be better, like Token Druid and Zoolock, I'm not sure how much better mastif would be. You're not really trying to play it until T4+, and preferably T6+, but then you'd have to weigh that upside against not having a small removal on T2.
---
Push forward!!

In any competitive environment, some consideration for time must be taken. Physical card game tournaments have round time limits and Hearthstone itself already has turn time limits.

For some people solo content is enjoyable the same way like solving puzzles - for example sudoku. It's fine if you don't get it, people are different, enjoy different things and consider different things as a waste of time.

I love free things and hearthstone and free hearthstone things

Some sort of broccoli-headed man?
---
Whoever reads this: Have a nice day!
---
Also Schemes say "upgrades each turn" but really only mean your turn,  compared to cards like Gruul or Micro Minibot that actually trigger at each turn.
---
I still want to know why witch's brew doesn't have echo. It is supposed to be a call back to witchwood and yet the card it has the most in common with is unstable evolution from Kobolds
---
At least I tried.
---
Stuff is good!
---
I may stuck at the game, but it's fun
---
I got emeriss from the 2 mana warrior spell, playing rogue; played it twice (with shadowstep). I felt pretty dirty playing my lerroy after that
---
Blizzard's answer to token decks from the start has always been Wild Pyro and wasting your cheap spells as Wild Pyro triggers.
---
Congrats on 1 million subs! Gotta love the giveaway :)

Well Met !!!

The Echo vs repeatable has been brought up a lot, pretty sure its intentional, it just annoys me. Same for recruit. Why not do it all one way. Doesnt matter which way, just do it the same.
---
Switch to MTG Arena, it’s better
---
hello there
---
Damn this looks epic
---
Might as well try
---
best hunting party i've seen played
---
Who said this? This is like, week 1 hearthstone bs
---
But you dealt 1 dmg to it?
---
I am just glad that hearthstone has such a great community that can post advice about hearthstone it has helped me as a new player get better at the game.
---
Ha, this threads toast
---
Kalecgos would say **Millhouse Manastorm** the first spell you play each turn.
---
Wow!
---
Blizzard and the Hearthstone community are awesome people! :D good luck everyone
---
GL to everyone :)
---
No, check last moves beside. I dealt 2 dmgs and won that match.
---
LEEEEEROOOOYYYY JENKINS!
---
There is literally no world in which attacking first is the right choice.
---
Explosive trap? Dead.
---
Freezing trap?  Waste of mana and by attacking first you miss lethal by using 2 hero powers.
---
Snipe? Safe #1
---
Misdirection? Dead.
---
Venomstrike Trap?  Miss lethal via hero power 50% of the time.
---
Wandering Monster?  Miss lethal, die.
---
Rat Trap?  Safe #2
---
Snake Trap?  Miss lethal via hero power 75% of the time.
---
Why didn't he hit the button first!?!?
---
At least in explosive trap case you hit draw.
---
In Freezing trap case you have a second chance at lethal via the hero power.
---
I would like free stuff!
---
Cool idea.
---
Sup bliz love the game
---
Obligatory.
---
Thank you Blizzard
---
Small indie company

Hello hello hello
---
Comletitivehs is an even bigger joke of a sub than this one.
---
You wouldn't know them, they go to to a different subreddit
---
“whats with all this couch psychiatry?” says the guy spending hours posting about his overwrought analysis of emote use in a wizard poker video game
---
Holy moley I checked the subreddit on the right day. Willing to discard my deck and replace it with 2x copies of 5 random prizes plz.
---
Actually, in the current meta I don't think you even expect a mage to have a board clear really.  Normally you would absolutely hold off here due to blizzard/flame, but vs all the conjuring mages out there that rarely have aoe, you really don't need to play around it too much.  You are more worried about them getting double taunts from a giant or their 8 mana spell, stopping your ability to get damage via the board.
---
Welcome to the great tournament!
---
Stay awhile and listen.
---
My point here is maybe the community should reflect on their perceptions. They have chosen to perceive things in a negative manner absent any other data. This is an awful way to live life and maybe if more people perceive well played as the literal words it could become a larger influence. Instead I am being told that the communities negative perception is right and more people should follow that.

Hearthstoooooone

Also if you're a new player, you really should NOT, and I mean it, try to netdeck during the first month or so of playing. You will get frustrated very quickly because 1) you won't be able to actually craft anything, 2) you won't really get to understand the strengths of each card and 3) you will not get to enjoy the thrill of playing a deck you figured out yourself. Deckbuilding is a big part of the fun in this game, don't spoil it :)
---
And as everyone said, your collection will naturally grow over time, but fairly slowly for sure. Always dust your golden duplicates (dust &gt; shiny). I would advise, if you ever get to open trash/meme tier legendaries (such as Nozdormu), to dust them if you need the dust. But don't dust your commons and your rares!
---
Ay 1M subs, happy to see that, now letsl's go for 2M!
---
Send Leeroy to hall of fame!
---
You are not prepared.

Yahoo

Winter is ended...
---
Well thanks for the hoody, I'm size Large
---
I mean, even two 1/1s is a decent 1 drop value (cats), and outside doomsayer, that's pretty much the low roll (and sometimes doomsayer is actually your high roll...just...not here.
---
For Doomhammer!
---
It's a diffrent doom I'm whitelisted thank you
---
I have no idea what to say that hasn't already been said here. But congratulations to our community on hitting this amazing milestone!
---
Win a giveaway. Ez profit.
---
Is it weird than I don't like playing certain classes because of heroes appearance? :) Don't want to be judgemental, but I just don't like playing Horde characters lol! Also I don't see myself playing Warlock and Mage. I was always a Priest / Warrior / Paladin in my WOW days, so I guess I'm stuck with those, haha!
---
I am still tramatized from our 4 drop robot overlord.  So many board lost and won to master shredder.
---
Gorillas reach sexual maturity at 7.
---
It checks out.
---
Wild Growth uses Mana Crystals and Excess Mana uses Mana.
---
**Jeweled Scarab** one spell as well
---
Hearthstone Reddit, best Reddit
---
Hey
---
Like seriously everytime someone does this it takes forever for my trade to happen. Read fully and you would see next to doom it says whitelisted DooM#13660
---
Boom
---
Hell yeah free stuff
---
I stand corrected! However, there is evidence where I can confirm that they deliberately chose not to include echo on Unstable Evolution because it's not quite the same and do in fact have different interactions
---
Here is my comment
---
Not blink fox 1/10
---
Thanks for the evidence, I stand corrected on that specific point.
