NERF KRONX!!!

---
---
I think I actually forgot how to play normal hearthstone now. Haven‚Äôt touched it since battlegrounds lmao.
---
Could there be a possible worse name for this card?
---
It is too strong for it's tier.  It's an oppressive early game card that is showing up more with junk bot banished to tier 5 taverns.  I have had games where I really shouldn't have top 4 because it carried me. I have also had games where my opponent gets 5 divine shield procs on 1 guardian.
---
I mean you could run the 1 damage twinspell or explosive trap i guess
---
Got really dizzy shen i played for 2 games. please take this to higher instance, we all want to play a fanrastic mode.
---
Amber left you cuz you only cared about your job
---
You have to be Galakrond for that part of the battlecry to trigger.
---
Brann and battlecries tend to be inherently synergistic through being mostly buffs.
---
This along with speeding up animation times would be perfect.
---
Well, realistically, the 15 gold you spend here on zerus(es?) means you cant tech up quickly to 5 without gimping your board, hard.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt this be a Paladin card?
---
What is this game your are playing? Is it HearthStone?
---
I've been there more time than I care to admit. Good tips
---
Ye
---
Still a good card though
---
Sorry, I'm still clouded by a meta filled with decks that hinge around a Legendary that, if you don't have, the deck doesn't function. Life's tough for free to plays, I guess.
---
I SWEAR TO GOD, I‚ÄôM GONNA DO IT
---
HOW IS EVERYONE FORGETTING ABOUT THE WAVECLEAR THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU ANYWAYS???
---
Giving something stealth is not good if it's a weenie. You cannot play this with other minions that are big. Everything that would be stealthed dies to lightning storm.
---
You are still weak to the exact same things while winning the matchups you would have won anyways. The only difference is you waited until they have mana for blizzard and flamestrike. Don't forget that you're now weak to MCT, which is not the case with coppertail.
---
And it's COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE otherwise. It's a total clunker with no upside other than stealthing your mechs. Playing this outside of the combo (which is a bad combo) is also bad. It's between a usual case of bad and a niche case of also bad.
---
Everything is relative. in SN1P SN4P, would you want this, or a 4 mana 2/4 that draws you a card? Or Another copy of a mech you already run? Or even a piloted shredder?
---
One is an unplayable abomination, the others are also bad cards but further your game plan.
---
This dude is -1 draw when you get him. It's a bomb, but you dont take damage and you don't draw a card.
---
I just... I can't even. This does not "surely" set you up for lethal. Just stick the goddamn mechs and pass. 9 times out of 10 they will concede to a 20/30 snip snap. 
---
The other 1 out of 10 they would have beaten you even if you had stealthed your mecharoo. Trust me.
---
What does putting him first in line have to do with who the opponent puts first? All that matters is either he's taunted and will potentially get hit first or he will be hitting a taunt first.
---
??? What are you responding to?
---
I'm talking about game design. The devs said warlock shouldn't have face damage. Giving them one new face damage card means they can burst people to death once they get low. Letting this card exist breaks the identity of "Can't burst people."
---
Malygos Druid is proof that is doesn't take much for a deck to be all about using spells to kill people. Druid is "Supposed" to be the "Play big minions, have trouble removing them" class, but they've become the spell-centric combo class because of only a couple cards.
---
This is closer to the twin emperors than it is to the old tutor. It's a late game tempo play that rewards you for committing a specific archetype. Like twin emperor, it's a really mediocre card until you've met its condition. 
---
A 6/6 for 6 that draws you your late game win con is ok, but the fact that it only tutors galk can make it awkward/ a dead card for most of the game. 
---
Galkoron's want to stay in your hand while you scale it up up, but this guy encourages you to play your galk quickly, since it's a vanilla 6/6 (basically a dead draw) if galk is already in your hand. Also, the 4/6 tutor from wotog was unplayable trash, and this is meant to be a powerful neutral legendary. The fact that kronx is better than a garbage 6 drop from 3+ years ago doesn't really mean much.
---
time to make guardian of kings restore 12 health to hero!
---
I mean, doesn't it seem like a large portion of the upcoming set is mega broken? They really went ham on the power creep this time
---
Um
---
I‚Äôve spent zero dollars and suggest others do the same. Why on earth would Blizzard pay me to share that?
---
If you think Hearthstone is too expensive, you probably don‚Äôt know how to manage your resources properly or think the game is pay to win.
---

---
You wouldn't. But you might *draw* him, giving you a 6 mana 6/6 that does absolutely nothing.

Well, five Galakronds are free for everyone, so the real cost of any card that supports Galakrond is the same as of any card.

[Corrupt the water]
---
Meanwhile, I've never been offered Ice Block with Akazamzarak, so I generally avoid playing him.
---
That's why it is tier 1.   It could be good early to early-mid-game with the right other cards and fall off in late-mid-game, and shitty late game.
---
So you play many slow decks then complain when the archetype is countered? Like what you just dont want to have a strategy that could beat slow decks or what?
---
[[corrupt the water]]
---
Hunter is probably the class which has the hardest time making this card work, but it is likely still going to be good in a slower deck. 
---
Tarim is the card most comparable to this Is say, especially so since Hunter doesn't really have any Arcane Explosion effects. Veranus is probably going to be worse than Tarim, due to the latter being able to buff your board plus paladin is much better at generating a wide board than Hunter is.
---
Just make all other minions cost (2) more.

Literally no one has had that happen, look at ANY post that shows this exact same thing and youll get your answer for what happened
---
Burgle rouge isn‚Äôt slow by any means, and neither is battlecry shamen. Both fast paced. Both get wrecked by hunter 85% of the time.
---
In other classes I'd say it's a straight bomb, but Hunter does have a difficult time making it work like you said.
---
Was the "That's an absurd name" bit supposed to be a joke?
---
Burgle rogue is tier 4 rn isnt it? Dont play standard myself but im pretty sure its not a strong archetype, 85% is a false statistic, best thing is to take a break from the game for a little, rant posts that are statistically wrong dont help or change anything
---
I had no clue this sub existed and now I‚Äôm interested
---
Wouldn't you just wait to play the card
---
And either way 6mana 6/6 is hardly the worst thing in the world
---
Warrior Galakround seems legit af now
---
Any idea how much ram it has? If its 3 or less thats entirely why, optimization update is supposed to happen some time next month so you probably will have to just be patient

My prediction : in future we will have a epic card with same text but smaller (4 mana 4/4, 3 mana 3/3...)

Just play this then Consecration

Healbot with a better tribe, can heal anywhere, and has more than 50% more stats

Yeah, no worries.
---
you think that if you play this turn 1 your opponent wont just immediately kill it?
---
bruh
---
I think this guy is measuring how good these buff minions are for all strategies, not just mechs
---
That weapon sucks because it will just be killed by Harrison Jones. And Possessed Whelpling looks way too weak. There is no way it will have to get nerfed to be 6 mana.

So let's say you've got a Galakrond in your deck and you are already Galakrond. (Plenty of ways to do this; \[\[Chromaggus\]\] + \[\[Plot Twist\]\], \[\[Archbishop Benedictus\]\], etc.). You play Kronx - do you get both effects, or just the Devastation?

This card has some serious potential.

7/4/6 | Battlecry: Shuffle a copy of your opponent's deck into your deck.  
---
Things like this have happened before with the Obelisk deck, but not to this extent! Got close to getting creamed too!
---
Its beautiful, isn't it?
---
Well honestly it isn‚Äôt a pure board wipe. You get the 7/6 but the only real way it becomes a board wipe is with unleash, and that‚Äôs 9 mana and two cards. So on turn 9 you can spend 2 specific cards to swing a board back into your favor and establish a 7/6. On a more control-oriented class maybe this could see play, but hunter doesn‚Äôt really have the deck archetype to really justify running this. 
---
There‚Äôs no reason to run it in face hunter... and who even plays face hunter anymore
---
This is way too slow for midrange hunter. If you‚Äôre behind on turn 6-9 when this hits the board, then you‚Äôre already losing. Not only that but the unleash combo with this card is 2 dead cards until turn 9 if you draw it in your opening hand. Midrange hunter should already be ahead on board when this hits, which minimizes the impact this will have compared to other cards hunter could run instead.
---
Control hunter just doesn‚Äôt really exist outside of meme decks. 
---
I just don‚Äôt see this thing having any competitive success at all.
---
&gt; a card doesn't necessarily have to be strictly better than a former card in order to engage in power creep.
---
That's a really bizzare statement to make. 
---
Also "power creep" refers to the power level of **cards that are actually played** "power creeping" a card that  never sees play is meaningless.
---
I could definitely see this being played in a paladin or priest deck list for sure.
---
Brilliant
---
Yeah I don't know why people are rating this so badly when vanilla 1/3s have been played in agro decks in every expansion they were included. This is only slightly worse when going second, but it's a 1/3 or better when going first.
---
Read your own comment. Your whole rant right there, had no substance to refute what I said. You're just trying to justify why it's okay for a card to be OP as long as it's control, not saying any other way your comment could be interpreted. Because that's exactly what it is.
---
How do I verify that I had both of these issues?
---
I would want the ability to purchase a specific card with cash.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If I had access to all the cards, I would no longer play standard unless I found a deck I truly enjoy. I like having to make do with what I have, and like to fight opponents who are playing the same way, which is why i'm loving battlegrounds.
---
I might do 5$ a month for 15 packs.
---
This card is way too good

How is it power creep if it‚Äôs a class card. Ice rager was power creep because it was a 5/2 that cost 3, 1 hp more then magma rager. And heckler is a 5/4 taunt for 4 vs booty bay bodyguard which was the same but for 5

My highest triple was 15 in a single game. Shudderwock with golden khadgar is amazing. 1 token card. 2triplets. It requires a lot of space and time on your hands though. But it's amazing. Managed to get golden mama bears through triplet discovering.
---
I get what you're saying, I meant battlecry specific synergies, like "gain +1/+1 whenever you play a battlecry minion" or "battlecries trigger twice"
---

Wasn't C'thun Druid really high up there at one point? Not sure if T1, but T2 from what I can recall.

The fact that you can use them and sell them get money back and free up space... The entire idea if limited board space... It's all tailored to battlecry minions.

---
She's the Lifebinder throughout the Warcraft Lore, aswell as technically the Queen of dragons. 
---
Lifebinder, Spellweaver, Dreamer, Earthwarder are the Aspect's titles. Only Neltharion's being changed to multiple different ones after becoming Deathwing.
---
I‚Äôm saying what her card name is.
---
Or we hall of fame the only  remaining still broken classic 1 drop.
---
One hit point matters.
---
While making it more complex may go against Blizzard's philosophy, here's how I see it:
---
1. Getting matched with the same person repeatedly in a short timeframe is undesirable.
---
2. Getting matched with people around the same *rank* repeatedly in a short timeframe is undesirable (in reality, it's people around the same *strength*, but using rank as a proxy for strength seems to be the only realistic approach that can't be gamed in undesirable ways)
---
3. Matching being *too* predictable is undesirable (personal opinion, but I don't think you should be able to play greedy 2+ turns because you know you'll be facing weak boards for multiple turns)
---
My solution: weight opponent based on 1. recent matches with that exact opponent, 2. recent matches around the rank the opponent was when you matched.
---
There's various approaches you could use, but for a very simple model, you could simply have a counter that starts at 1 for all opponents and increases by 1 every turn, going back to 0 (after the increase) when you play against them for the "recent opponent" weights. Then have another weight that starts at 1 for all ranks and also goes up by, I don't know, 0.25 each turn, but only returns to 1 rather than 0 after playing that rank, and also the ranks 1 above and 1 below are, say, halved.
---
To pick an overall pairing configuration out of all possible choices, just weight each of them by product of all relevant weights, i.e. (opponent_history_weight[firstPair] * rank_history_weight[firstPair]) * (opponent_history_weight[secondPair] * rank_history_weight[secondPair]) * ... (keeping the logic to exclude unnecessary ghosts as-is)
---
You may need to do the calculations in a slightly fancier way to keep floating point precision from being an issue in extreme cases, but it's probably fine as-is for 8 players.
---
Somewhat related, I wish that AF Kay did only half damage on turn 3, or something. Getting hit for 11 on a turn you really couldn't do anything about is really frustrating.
---
It is, and I can‚Äôt deny that. It adds a new dimension to the game that tabletop card games can‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs great for that. It‚Äôs just their discovery criteria (Discover a Dragon, oh look Ysera) and its looseness that dampens it for me.
---
Still get PTSD from it though.

1. People trying to go for a specific strategy way too early and passing on very good units that would allow you to immidietly switch to a different/better strategy
---

trading 80g quest, NA
---
you go first
---
Here's all you need to know about battleground.
---
Plan 1 -
---
1. Get Amalgam ASAP.
---
2. Give it taunt divine shield.
---
3. Give it Poisonous.
---
4. Buff it's health to infinity.
---
5. Have 3-4 murlocs with divine shield, poisonous and Winfury.
---
6. You are now #1.
---
Plan 2 -
---
1. Get the Rat Pack card with the guy who gives +3 attach whenever you summon a beast.
---
2. Repeat the above process with Amalgam.
---
2. Get Scavenging Hyena. (Golden is even better)
---
3. Get Hydra.
---
4. Buff all the beasts as much as possible.
---
5. Get Mamma Bear.
---
6. Win.
---
Plan 3 -
---
1. Get all the mechs especially Cobalt Guardian.
---
2. Repeat the same thing with Amalgam like above.
---
3. Get a golden Junkbot.
---
4. Win.
---
Miscallaneous tips -
---
1. Bryan helps a lot to buff all minions.
---
2. Battlemaster is nice when your health is under 10.
---
3. Lightfang is nice for buffing too.
---
The end.
---
How do you plan the order of your minions?
---
Yeah I crop a gold at 2/3 sit on it to 4 so I can sprint discover to 5 and PRAYYYYYY I get bran or lightfang or im fucked. It's all a race to 5.

Astonishing#2504 EU, trading 80g after you show it.

Constant health supply starting from tavern 2 is really big. Especially with brann, your murlocs easily see 40 50 hp. And discovering further coldlights were great too. Why I said better was because you can constantly buy and play coldlights. You can sell buy for an eternity. One game I stopped leveling and tavern 4 after getting a brann from a triple and rolled for coldlights like madmen. I took the crown.

Both are also made by the same artist, Nicola Saviori. His style is pretty particular, you can easily tell appart his cards from the other artists. He also did stuff like snip snap and betrug.
---
Where's the cube Dragon?
---
On average they should be two 1/1's and 2/1. So in a vacuum it is kind of like Sen'jin Shieldmaster. In the real world, one can expect half the decks should run Zephrys though... so it is just going to be a bad card.
---
This is awesome.
---
Or even any priest deck that runs Psychopomp (which is all of them). Would possibly like to run this in decks with Mountain Giant/ Mogu Fleshshaper (cost nothing in a turn where you could play one of those already)
---
Rip! My by Ragnaros isn't in standard no more??! He was so fun to play

You can play anything you want in wild.

What it sounds like is I should definitely wait until the expansion and see then?
---
you ok there bud?

1/0/2 | At the start of your turn, destroy this and gain 8 Armor.

aka another high roll for Desert Hare evolve
---
On the other hand a lot of mechs have deathrattles, so you could just stick him in there for a while.

Still good as long as your purpose is to muddle res pool.

Yea wsup wya

---
The best way to come back is always at the beginning of the Standard year, because there are least expansions in Standard at the same time (4). After Descent of Dragons drops, there will be 6 of them at the same time, so you would have a lot more catching up to do, not to mention that buying any packs / crafting any cards from 2018 (which are often necessary to build decks) would be a waste, given that they rotate out very soon.
---
&gt; Not sure why you're getting downvoted 
---
Because some kids/teens need to believe they are winning due to their skill, not because of RNG that favoured them into getting the meta units they needed. And that is the same reason why you and me are gonna be/being downvoted: People here don't want to see the truth.
---
Obvious statement, but it's the type of card that's not gonna be played by itself. You have to take advantage of 3 1 drops. Mogu, Sea Giant, MCT, G O N K, etc.
---
They are not in battlegrounds, I'm pretty sure that the implied context is battlegrounds.
---
Not by default, no. But everyone got a free copy of said Wild cards for the duration of the event (basically a new card but has the same name pic and effects), they'll be gone by 10th.
---
SN1P-SN4P and handbuff pally really needed the buffs. Thanks blizzard.
---
Effective mill strategy.
---
I saw two pogos when all other options sucked so I grabbed them and it ended up like this. It's funny because pogos usually make me lose even with shudderwock.
---
Whoops I posted on mobile so I couldn't see the art while typing the comment. Had a suspicion in the back of my mind though.
---
SN1P-SN4P is already absurdly consistent. It doesn‚Äôt need any help in that regard. This card is way too slow to see any play in that deck.
---
This happens any time I timeout.  The game just doesn't know how to reconnect.
---
just let it happen
---
I wonder what the right infinite play is here... Defend Gilneas helps you clear the board, and grows into a 6/3, but the opponent can just Defend Gilneas to clear them. 
---
Pretty sure the best play is simply to Kalecgos and pray... You're down on health, even if you Alex him (which you should, right after), and you can just always play Kalecgos and a spell. You need that RNG upswing to win, and the only real source of RNG is Kalecgos.
---
**Sidequest:** If your opponent plays control, at the end of their turn summon a 3/6 minion with **Taunt**.
---
I think we're supposed to look at the black bar on the left.
---
It‚Äôs not strong. People seem to be thinking it‚Äôll be OP in Wild SN1P-SN4P Warlock, but the card is way too slow for that and it‚Äôs not an effect the deck even needs.
---
Different hero powers for different uses. Daryl is for early mid game Finley's is for late game.
---
&gt; Would aggro want to give up turn 2 for this, though?  
---
If they're in a situation where they can have nine stats ready to attack on turn three, yeah.
---
Neither deck will run this card.
---
 Finally more support for shudderwock
---
Minions also deal damage. 
---
This card is only good when activated on turn 2-3, 4 classes can prevent that at no cost.
---
I just can't figure out how to finish ungoro quest before 10 Mana in wild.
---
he didn't imply they did. he said people playing against priest like this card.
---
AND ALSO
---
people playing mogu in their deck would like to play this card.
---
This looks like they wanted it to be a secret at first but it was more fun if both players knew what the card was. Also at 2 mana they could bump up the stats of the minion.
---
Forces your opponent to make suboptimal plays if they don't want you to have a discounted minion. I assume this doesn't trigger on the turn you use it.
---
you still don't get the d-word pass, though
---
You should farm your 10 packs from each expansion first, not wait to spend everything on the new expansion. 
---
25K = 250 packs worth of dust, but that's assuming you 
---
(1) Have to craft everything instead of opening good cards
---
(2) Want to play every deck in the meta (which you shouldn't as a budget player)
---
The Galakrond decks basically build themselves as they require so many cards. You put in: 
---
* 10-12 Galakrond cards (Galakrond, Gronx, the Epic support card in every class, 6-8 Invokes) 
---
* 10-12 OP cards/legendaries from your class (obvious once you play a while e.g. Edwin Van Cleef)
---
* 6-8 win condition/gimmick cards. 
---
Its the non-Galakrond classes that need a wait &amp; see approach.
---
His quest isn't done yet so it must be a good one.
---
Oh yeah, if this were deckfill rogue it'd be great.
---
People are playing BG only because the current meta sucks donkey dick, it‚Äôll be better after the expansion.
---
That seems about the only time it would be worth playing as aggro, and would be super situational. I dunno. For aggro, this seems like maybe an included as tech against slower decks, but definitely not an auto-include.
---
Would this activate at the start of your turn? Wondering if it can attack the turn it is summoned.
---
Did anyone else notice that his hair kept changing sides, when switching between explorers and evil
---
They look way too similar. Especially bad because one is absolute trash and the other is pretty strong. I did buy a Siegebreaker by mistake once (and was thoroughly confused when the next Annihilan wasn't glowing for the triple...)
---
and maybe give one a different color
---
This card is broken. It will trigger at some point 100% so it's basically 2 mana 3/6. You can't effectively trade and forced to do useless face damage since paladin have free heals anyway.
---
It's a problem man, just because you don't recognize it doesn't mean it's not a problem
---
Solution: Mirror the art on Battlemaster.
---
Question about the Pogo strat
---
Do you upgrade your tavern normally or stay at T2 so you have a higher chance of getting pogos?
---
warcraft only has so many demons and the burning legions look all the same at the same rank
---
Desert Hare will be completely gone from standard when this new set releases. It‚Äôs garbage without evolve
---
Desert Hare won't see play after this expansion comes out. Evolve is gone.
---
Why would ppl play desert hare without evolve ?
---
Imagine this, you're playing vs aggro, you have 2 of these in your hand, they don't have a T1, and you start second.
---
T1, they skip.
---
T1, coin + this.
---
Now they either need a taunt, or they have to use HP every single turn until they can HP + minion, because otherwise, you get a taunt that's going to make it nearly impossible to stop the second 3/6 taunt from spawning without another 2 mana investment every turn.
---
This card is a stud, 5 star.  You obviously won't be drawing 2, but it's power level and control is massive.
---
i don think he needs synergy with a tribe. some way to buff him wouldn't be horrible, but hes already really strong as a niche card for late-Extreme late game.  he ignores taunts to hit the lowest attack minons, and thats actually kind of a big deal against certain boards that can result in an auto win. it will tend to alpha strike things like junkbot, hyena, mama bear, souljugglers, barron and khadgar.  the last 3 in particular he is really strong against since they them selves cant be buffed and if any of the above are taken out early. he can easily swing final rounds that the opponent would dominate in, by taking out key cards.  its less usefull against things like murlocs, lightfang, brann, etc so again. hes also weak to unbuffed mexenna. i think hes an interesting decision card and is a good T6 card. you pick him up if you need him for a particular opponent, or to hold in your hand until you hit said opponent and swap him out for your buff slot that turn to knock them out in the late game.
---
It did see play from streamers for sure. Dane, Solem, and Roffle all played it for a bit
---
It should be summoning on your opponents turn, so
---
As in you want to use Evolve on this? How? It's already got better stats than most 5 drops.
---
Yesterday i played BG on pc for the first time after playing it on mobile only. Out of 5 games i won 4 and made 2nd once LOL. Without the constant time pressure its a totally different game. I had 50 seconds recruiting time on average. In comparison, I usually have 20-30 seconds recruiting time (minus animations totals to 10-15 seconds) I have never had a mobile lategame turn where I could do everything I wanted, let alone make good decisions.
---
the thing is if she gets sniped its all over
---
we rise!
---
dont forget mama bear/barron/and to a lesser extent khadgar.
---
What about Pit Snake?
---
It can't mean both players. If it counted your own turn, you play this, click end turn, you get a 3/6 taunt. That's just dumb. It DEFINITELY means take no damage on any opponent's turn.
---
That actually makes the combo impossible though since it would be 11 mana :(
---
They had to assign a rarity to all battlegrounds cards due to cards like Sneed‚Äôs. 
---
Each card also has a mana cost for the purposes of shredders and effigy.
---
it's pretty good but getting those triples is really good, especially at level 5 shop so you can get mama bear.
---
&gt; you‚Äôre playing vs aggro
---
&gt; they skip turn 1
---
Evaluating a card based on these dream scenarios does not show how powerful it is lol. Of course it‚Äôs great if that situation pops up, but the situations where it‚Äôs average or completely useless will be a lot more common I think, and so running this over another card will be tough
---
*With my mind on my minions and my minions on my mind*
---
Thanks Blizzard, this 2 Mana quest will forever trigger my OCD

 **Pisach#1507 EU** Looking for 80g Quest Trade.
---
We will challenge each other and deny the challenge to verify that both have the quest.
---
You go first. You can check my Reddit history, many successful quest trades here.
---
Uhh I have no idea why this is being downvoted to hell, because the shredders in Battlegrounds don¬¥t spawn any other minion, just those approximately 10 2-mana costed minions, that are in the Battlegrounds pool. (They range from 1 star cards like Humungulous or a 3 star card like Khaddgar). So no, for example the Piloted Shredder in the Battlegrounds as of now will never spawn Doomsayer
---
I did that once to kill myself when I had already made the top four and I knew there was no way I could best my next opponent. It has its uses as a stylish concede button!
---

---

---
Ok I guess we will never agree on this because u think this is burst dmg so ok man
---
trump: makes up a rating based entirely on whether or not he thinks the card will see play and he thought warlock was going to be trash
---
everyone: GOOD CARD LOW STAR XD
---
Stop getting the gold varieties then... or get yourself checked for color blindness?
---
3+6=9
---
If the minion is summoned at the end of your opponent's turn, it will be able to attack when your turn comes around.
---
I think a lot of people don't realize that "cracker" comes from "whip-cracker" rather than "saltine cracker".
---
That seems *really* risky. 
---
...I kinda want to try it.
---
Antonio Brown: "No" *farts*
---
Trumps reviews are about as good as his trades used to be. Entertaining though.
---
what about the triplets?
---
Except in the expansion it launched defile genuinely saw almost no play due to the state of warlock. He even admit that an a later expansion it could be broken, but not in the koft meta.
---
"I concede to you."
---
You could hope that Blizzard intends to build on an interesting card by supporting it in future expansions. But that often ends in situations like "Oh, we forgot about Reckless Experimenter, we have to nerf it so we can print this new Neutral Legendary."
---
Every single time a Pack Rat dies with a Pack Leader or Mama Bear out, I want to beat my head against a table.  I don't understand why it spawns a rat, then buffs that rat, then spawns the next rat, then buffs that rat, etc. Just spawn them all at once, then buff them all at once. Two animations instead of upwards of 15.
---
Can't you only look at the top 200?
---
Yeah I totally picked Battlemaster once thinking "There's my triple!" and was sorely disappointed.
---
Coin this on turn 1 if the opponent didnt drop a turn 1 minion is really good as well.
---
this is a 6 mana 6/6 that summons an 8/8 with taunt (or many others equally powerful effects) there is no way this won't be included in every single galakrond deck
---
This card is absolutely fucking nuts and anyone who doesn‚Äôt think so isn‚Äôt paying attention
---
I'm not against 5 extra seconds as that isn't a huge benefit (assuming everyone had a minimum baseline), but currently you are effectively penalized upwards of 40+ seconds on some comps and matchups.  I'm not personally a big fan of hyena / junkbot comps but even if I was, I basically can't play them due to the animations burning up all of my time.
---
=you only play it against zoo lock
---
I'm not saying it means you cant win games, I'm saying it pointlessly makes it a little harder and less fun. And I was talking mainly about the early access. Its like a month for f2p players having to play with 2 heroes.
---
I misread the card i thought it was just if you already drew him you get it.
---
That would explain why i thought this card was so op
---
Coin into this
---
I have a question. I didn't play any game, but I made a deck. So I will win the 300 gold reward?
---
And every other quest that is worded to fit both game modes
---
Arcane tracker for Android, and the hsreplay tracker for pc...
---
It's a lost cause, dude. This has to be explained to people every single expansion, but a lot refuse to understand it. They like applying terms in ways that undermine their meaning and won't hear otherwise.
---
He'll need a different hero power then.
---
The bigger issue for me has been mobile performance. In the top 2 and while I'm still nowhere near finished watching the battle unfold, my opponent upgrades his tavern...turns out he had nearly a full minute whereas I got less than 20 seconds. I just pay on desktop now which works fantastically and has improved my winrate - it shouldn't be that way.
---
I assume it's like a secret where it means take no damage on your opponents turn.
---
The mechathun combo is only 3 cards. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs doable
---

---
Selling it puts it back in the pool, if there are no copies of it left then you wont get one until someone sells or dies.
---
If you can't stabilize for 1 turn against aggro, you're going to lose regardless of these 2 cards in your deck, which are massive tools to keep you stabilized.
---
Also if they have the card in hand; then you are effectively denying a draw.
---
The technology is here!
---
Are you sure? Check new cards that are being announced.
---
All of these cards look *so* awesome. I legitimately cannot wait for the expansion to come out so i can open my 163 packs lol

2/-/- | Deal 1 damage to all minions. If any die, cast this again.  
---
They revealed a new legendary that increases the maximum hand size to 12.
---
Wait, so if you use it on a treant and someone then casts force of nature, you think it won't do anything?
---
False
---
Play zephyrus -&gt; kill your own zephyrus with this boi -&gt; lol at their discarded zephyrus
---
That's an original design! Very cool!
---
Also a fair application, although while that is a thing that *can* happen, it won't always happen. 
---
Most of the time, it will end up as the thing I mentioned, with some chances to high roll from time to time, and some chances for skill testing.
---
Yeah I did write about that, and also a Hellfire on a stick. But who knows if that will be enough, since it's still just small heal and Warlock needs bigger bursts (Spellstone grows up to 7, and Dark Pact used to heal 8).
---
I wonder if this card and the other one that increases hand size is to lead them towards HOFing Mountain Giant.
---
wtf youre literally a monk in a temple
---
Ah good point! I forgot about twilight Drake for some reason.
---
&gt; Since you don‚Äôt deny a draw
---
This can hit cards in the opponent‚Äôs hand as well, so you absolutely can deny draws with it.
---
Okkkk..
---
So....
---
How TF does this work with multiple copies of Undatakah with the Prelate DR ?!
---
So, does this destroy copies in *both* decks? Per the wording, I would assume so.
---
So much for DODPRT being up to date. I didn't need to be downvoted for not knowing about a card that was released 30 minutes ago, geez.
---
Expensive stuff is amazing in quest warlock, because it's the stuff that gets the biggest discount when you draw it with your hero power. The deck does need some cheaper control tools, but luckily it got two of those this week already.
---
So, will there actually be a maximum hand size with this? I'm curious about what happens if you repeatedly bounce and replay this.
---
No, I lack wisdom. Monks have wisdom. I merely have a small but larger the average amount of intellect.
---
that‚Äôs defo not how it‚Äôs gonna work. it can‚Äôt destroy copies that don‚Äôt exist yet.
---
Ah yes, thank you. Me no math good.
---
It‚Äôd be 0 if you tapped after playing this, yeah?
---
Mecathunlock in wild I think would love this card. It's better sprint for drawing purposes and let's you cheat out the bloodbloom cataclysm combo with more cards unplayed.
---
Saying "false" means nothing to me.
---
Haha, i made a very similar post just an hour ago. Sadly mod removed it because "no rants allowed". Trust me you're not alone with this one.
---
Current
---
Tired of veasel priest?
---
Arguably auto-include in every rogue deck for the next year
---
WHAT. I thought this was a custom card at first. Handlock is for sure going to have some fun tools. Honestly warlock needed some spicy cards though. They suffered enough these past two expansions.
---
I think you misread the card, mate.
---
You would not run this in something like Zoolock.
---
They should indeed be the same card internally, with different stats and art applied as they are summoned. That's the most efficient way to implement them, and is mechanically consistent with cards that have similar effects like Spirit of the Tiger.
---
[Meanwhile, in reality...](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?filter-name=Jade+Golem)
---
Demented?
---
Vilespine is still a very strong card. And the power level of new sets since 2017 when it was added has been *lower* on average.
---
Likely in January and almost definitely in March.
---
No it isn't  this card is garbage, you are rarely going to have 12 cards in hand and this card is really slow...
---
I highly doubt it counts your own turn. Otherwise, it'd even be able to pop the turn you played it.
---
Found the Forsen sub
---
Yeah, but it still accomplishes a whole boardclear for 5 mana, which is useful for Rogue.
---
I really love this card, will play the shit out of it and I'll make handlock work.  
---
Imagine 1 mana mountain giant.
---
Blizzard I get that you keep buffing PogoHopper but we did not need a tech card for this.
---
You see that on desktops as well, fairly often, now that people have started closing HS in order to skip animations and get more time than their opponents or 1st pick of 5-6* minions.
---
Waaat
---
Hats off to them, they're really having some fun with these cards now!
---
Yeah had a few times where I meant to buy one and got the other, when it‚Äôs absolutely the opposite of what my team needed.
---
Whoa...
---
Why do I need 12 cards in hand and the card former champ exists. 5 mana 1/1 summons a 5/5 with no taunt.
---
Hopping the soul juggler is a new card of the set, Demonlock OP OP
---
I don't like this. It seems to be made for control or midrange... But I feel like it's the aggro decks that will really benefit from this.
---
Gotta love Mr. Bat ü¶á
---
Gotta have coins to be fast enough. I've seen locks snap on 4.
---
Not needing combo is a way bigger deal than you‚Äôre making it out to be. Vilespine‚Äôs strongest showings were in decks that had no zero mana activators (Odd Rogue) or only Backstab and Shadowstep (Tempo Rogue). Vilespine was very rarely just getting slapped down on turn 5 with combo active. This card is almost all upside.
---
This isn't the actual card... It summons a demon with stats equal to your hand size
---
Are beasts that were buffed with [[Dire Frenzy]] considered the same ‚Äúcopies‚Äù?
---
Nefarian's hero power deals 1 damage to all enemy minions.
---
The new Abyssal Summoner comes to mind. Seems spicy.
---
FUUUUUUCK dudeeeee wild dragon priest will be my fav deck

How can you predict the "functional value of an individual card" outside the context of the meta? Cube is an especially bad example since it literally relies upon other cards to get any value out of its ability. It's not "obviously" overpowered unless there are specific cards that it can interact with in a way that is part of a winning strategy in the meta.
---
6 mana.
---
I think I just jizzed in my pants
---
Identical caption? "You vs the guy..." is an identical caption for thousands and thousands of reddit posts. Thats how memes work.
---
Gonna be tough to play this card but it will be hilarious
---
Firebat said after that Blizz was disappointed in his last card reveal because he just talked about the card straight up, so it looks like this time he added some silliness to appease them.
---
Same here. I'm in the group that should be getting the packs so hopefully that'll kick in.
---
Same for me, got the gold but 0 packs even though I downloaded the update on Day 1.
---
The servers are full.
---
I wonder what happens in case you would die because you lose the fight in this round. Would you still win? Would nobody get the crown?
---
Hard agree. Ungoro, KotFT, and KnC, were some of the most fun decks in hearthstone. Much rather have sets which bring a big impact to the game then sets like Boomsday and Rhastakhan's Rumble.
---
Thats why you play faceless manipulator and zola to steal his Flik. Then you can shuffle that.
---
Why definitely on March?
---
On Nov 5th my internet was out for a couple of hours so I had to route hearthstone through a VPN, but fake the correct user agent. At the same time, my dog ate my router. and so I was unable to play until the exact minute your end date is. Is the end date "less than" or "less than or equal to"??? I need to know, need to feed my family.
---
One of them has armor covering the lower part of their chest. The other does not. And the one on the left is from wow lore.
---
11/11 incoming bois
---
The potential for a turn 2 3/6 is scary alone :D
---
Finally a good card design! Half the cards in arena draft are unplayable!
---
Not much. Unless you have a job and like sleeping.
---
The paladin himself can also play a 1-drop on his first turn...
---
i see this card being nerf to oblivion pretty much after release.
---
A random rating **is** a rating. Just a bad one. That‚Äôs the entire point of my conversation, and for some reason you‚Äôre physically unable to distinguish the word ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù from ‚Äúuseless‚Äù.
---
I dont think they actually hate BG. I like the mode but it is oversaturating a lot of HS content ATM, thats to be expected though since it is a brand new mode in HS
---
Right. In that same context (Odd Paladin), that would mean we should have been rating Raid Leader as a five star card since the beginning of the game because it was a staple in a top deck.
---
Still broken, FYI
---
I hate this is a rogue card. It's the OTHER classes that need this to combat rogue.
---
Mountain doesn‚Äôt count itself.
---
I'm skeptical. Control lock, when it's good, usually has all the cards it needs, and a 7 mana 4/4 sucks. The hand size is nice but not really necessary. Maybe if there's a combo warlock deck that's struggling with a hand clogged up with combo pieces, or control lock mirrors become an issue so you can play this instead of dumping cards.
---
Custom Hearthstone is shaking
---
Listen. This set is called descent of dragons. There's going to be good dragons in the set. There will be at least one dragon archetype that is meta viable, I guarantee it.
---
i'm the only one that thinks this will not be played much in the long run? 
---
i mean i love the idea of changing a core mechanic of the game, but i don't think it has intrinsically much value, specially on turn 7 with such a small body. sprint comparisons are not very spot on also, it's an over-expensive card on purpose (in order to use it with preparation).
---
And you're unable to understand semantics. Why are you even bothering with this discussion if your argument is "bad ratings are ratings too?" That's not what this comment thread was about.
---
4 mana 3/8 taunt that gives opponent 24 armor seems really good anti aggro
---
1. Have 12 cards in hand
---
2. Play Glinda
---
3. Tap
---
4. Play 6 mountain Giants
---
I will admit I was a bit confused in the definition of the term, considering it‚Äôs very commonly used in this sub to mean specifically bad or inconsistent code. My bad. 
---
But I don‚Äôt agree with the idea that this animation is an issue in the first place. It‚Äôs not terribly time consuming unless it‚Äôs being triggered by cleave minions or something like [[Dreadscale]], and it‚Äôs an accurate representation of how poisonous actually functions mechanically.
---
Wasn't there a post where Trump was generally one of the highest % of being right because of his system?

3/4/2 Beast | At the end of your turn, deal 1 damage to all other minions.  
---
Here‚Äôs my guess: 9 Mana 8/8 Neutral dragon called Alexszraza the Melter: Battlecry: Detroy both Heros Armor
---
If your opponent drops this turn 2, instead of what you were going to do on your turn, you're now changing strategy and using up mana just to ping them.
---
I love that it's also an odd cost so you can play it with Baku in Wild.
---
Reminds me of the good old days of beta üòÇ
---
i just thought it meant that everyone playing had an opponent and you have to wait for someone to play.  like all 10 people online are in a match with each other right now.
---
So does this mean we are getting a 12 cost demon now??
---
And maximum cards in a deck!
---
Or at the very least a 'low res' / 'slow computer' animation option.
---
no, chaingang nerf already killed him.
---
To be fair, heroes have been coded as cards that exist on the field since the beginning.
---
The game is pretty much designed to where having one or two amalgams is huge for poison/Divine shield/taunt. Poison is mostly through murlocs. Divine shield is mostly through mechs. Beasts have the best death rattles, token buffs, and early cleave (and multiple buffers). Also you waste most the best battlecry cards unless you have no synergy.
---
Just concede against Shaman? Especially if you‚Äôre already at the rank 5 floor for the month. All my problems with any disagreeable meta fall out the window once I remember this is an option lol.
---
lol
---
Emperor 1 &amp; Emperor A
---
have a sense of perspective and overview as the madness that is a nascent meta unfolds around you
---
Imagine doing this to a deck that depends on underbelly angler
---
Okay, this. This is some custom hearthstone level cool.
---
just copy him with togglewaggle scheme, then delete every minion in their deck.
---
Beasts still work with megacleave and tokens, but you usually need 1-2 amalgams by the end for poison/taunt/shield.
---
Yep same here.
---
Nice.
---
Hey, I received 300g but did not receive the 3 Saviors of Uldum pack. I am an active daily player so I am positive that I downloaded 15.6 patch in the mentioned interval. Any idea of what might have happened?
---
I'm thinking this would be insane with Shadowstep. Essentially destroying 6 cards from your opponents deck if the rogue isn't running those same cards.
---
odd was even a greater example as a whole. horrid cards like raidleader became effectively tier 1 cards.
---
With Valdris your hand maximun is 12 cards you ignorant casual.
---
just gotta steil theirs, copy it, reduce cost, and use it to destroy itself from their deck before they play it. ez
---
I know it doesn't, but man of this could hit rez pools I'd be the happiest camper.
---
But what will a golden version do?
---
Surely you jest
---
That's what I addressed in my original post.  It depends what they mean by "turn".  But yes, if it always spawn on turn 3, then yeah, it's just a delayed minions and is pretty good
---
Nope. I debated posting the same comment after mistakenly thinking I found a triple.
---
Dont kid yourself it's fun for the side doing the teabagging.
---
Disconnect. Probably by cutting your wifi signal and then reconnecting.
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily that hard even if you don‚Äôt contest the board on turn 1 (although this is also something Paladin doesn‚Äôt have much trouble doing). Your aggro opponent will have to dedicate a minion to hitting face on turns 3+ to keep the 3/6 at bay, which in turn lessens their own ability to contest board.
---
its a more consistent astromancer
---
Finley sucks so much. The HP needs to be fixed. Should maybe cost 1 to start, then be free every time you sell.
---
Except it does. When people talk about power level of sets they‚Äôre never talking about the arena chaff most sets are full of, so I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre even bringing that up. 
---
Even the meta relevant cars of the last two years have so far been on a significantly lower power level than the 2017 sets. Or are you genuinely trying to argue that everything we got in 2018-19 was on the same level as Knights of the Frozen Throne and Kobolds and Catacombs?
---
What do you mean this card won't work on it?
---
Odd rogue has a guaranteed combo activator in 50% of games that also lets you play slayer on turn 4.
---
i hope not,as a straight up destroy all armor card is uneeded and to much of i Win regardless Tech card.
---
and I dont think legendaries should be tech cards really regardless.
---
And i think its not that intresting effect for a legendary and certainly for alexstraza and compared to what other aspects get.
---
So if its mech and there is no mech you get anoyed aswell?
---
But do we have the technology?
---
I started to restart Hearthstone when I get into early lategame and have any time to spare. Sometimes I need to start it twice so it recognizes my game, but animation speeds right up again. Perhaps a buffering issue Blizzard could tackle.
---
Hi *excite* i'm dad
---
Espionage rogue pulling this will be so epic
---
And? No one ever evaluates decks of cards under the assumption that you‚Äôll have the Coin, because that‚Äôs a terrible way to judge them.
---
Entomb was good, and that didn‚Äôt leave a minion on your side.
---
If your opponent is Jaraxxus, can you target your own Jaraxxus on the board with this to destroy the enemy hero?
---
Dragon aggro warrior was a thing at one point.
---
But in general dragon decks have been tempo/mid-range. They curve extremely effectively and play well statted minions every turn.
---
You could actually play this card even in a tempo deck and put any combination in ammounts of the 9 cost that gives your minions in hand +3/+3 and mechanical Whelps or Waxadred or whatever crazy ass deathrattle is revealed
---
For one? I want to *gain* mana when I play them.
---
yes
---
Off off with your hand, tap tap till you're dead. Giant will roll on the floor.
---
&gt; The first post being downvoted has nothing to do with me correcting misinformation in one of the responses.
---
Your first post is you missing the point, and your second is you doubling down on it. It helps explain why people are downvoting, something you whined about in your second post.
---
&gt;The person tried to say that that was because it got changed.
---
He was saying it doesn't make sense to rate cards on potential beyond the immediate meta because the context can change, in this case literally the card itself changed. You know, the entire point of the comment chain this all stemmed from?
---
&gt;People then upvoted the post containing the wrong information for whatever reason.
---
Again, there was no information. People upvoted the person who was explaining why your post wasn't relevant to the thread and downvoting you for providing all this irrelevant info that misses the point and then whining about it.
---
&gt;I made that post because the original poster seemed to be making fun of people who say that, even though it‚Äôs a perfectly valid criticism of Trump‚Äôs rating method.
---
It's not, though. He isn't trying to evaluate that nor should he since it's something that can't be quantified the way his other ratings can.
---
A little too fair if you ask me.
---
Well, every set will have a few cards that stick, but I think a true testament to how good a set is is how good the main themed cards are, or how much they make people excited to try new decks. Everyone wanted to try out the ungoro quests and koft death knights day 1 but not so many people were excited for the legendary spells or shrines from boomsday and rumble, and you almost never see them in the current meta.
---
I, for one, welcome our new dragon overlords.
---
... lest?
---
reminds me of frothing beserker. You have to act fast if you're doing some frothing / warpath tactics, coz the animation alone will consume half your turn.
---
We agreed on this 4 days ago.

Hangelos#2599 looking to trade 80g quest on NA! I'll show and you go first please!
---
Aha who the fuck are you? Why would anyone care what you think?
---
In b4 unexpected interaction on release day removes cards across every user account
---
Evaluating cards under the assumption you'll never have the coin is equally terrible, because both situations are equally likely.
---
wow, the technology is there yet
---
Ok but even if they look exactly the same you could still use different poses, perspectives, backgrounds, or lighting.
---
Are people not buying packs? I see a bunch of people on battlegrounds with emotes
---
It wouldn‚Äôt destroy from those places.
---
What happens if you coin Sanctuary against warlock or shaman? If they hadn't play a minion, its a turn 2 3/6 taunt
---
That would be a great idea if you wanted to make the hero a "choose this to lower your rating".
---
This is it lads, the most value, greedy card ever
---
And summon the üÖ±Ô∏èancient one then I...
---
I've been rolling over a tournament idea in my head recently: Players can build decks based on two different lists:
---
- Cards in Basic, Classic and every Standard set besides Descent of Dragons
---
- Cards in Basic, Classic and Descent of Dragons
---
Because, yeah, this is feeling like the strongest set since Kobolds and Catacombs.
---
Lest he jest, or try to best the rest.
---
Yeah, but then someone will set up faceless/Sonya/Shaw/portal/brann combos in friendly and find a way to Break the signed integer limit on hand size.
---
Please show me the part where I evaluated a card based on the assumption that you‚Äôll always have the Coin.
---
What a pessimist
---
it seems to be very hard to do on mobile
---
That's how you know your doing right ;)

*Ding*
---
Insane how you're being upvoted for something that can't happen.
---
After you unlock all the free shit (basic cards, new player quests, etc) you only need to do your dailies to get around 80-90 packs per expansion.
---
Thanks bro this is so much better. Now I can see whats going on.
---
This whole year centers around the EVIL adventures of an etherial warlock, a goblin engineer, a kobold rogue, a troll shadow priest, and an orc shaman. Why wouldn't things involving them and their related races/equipment not take priority over other options?
---
Presumably it's manageable if that's where they landed when toning it down from 15.

---
Nice video, what did you use to record?
---
The hype is legitimate. This card is bonkers.
---
Ragequit worthy.  Well done.
---
Actually I'm pretty sure if you get 3 cute cats on board they become a triple too, so the play would just be buy both cats, and possibly wait till next turn after taverning up to play them to get 2 tier 4 triple rewards, which is actually insane. Heck maybe you could save one of the cats until you tavern up again later, you probably don't need both rewards immediately for a tier 5 minion.
---
Oof. I crafted hooktusk
---
he was using poetic license
---
Talking mostly about the 12 hand limit isn't it a bit pointless if you get it late in the game.
---
It's really good if you get it on turn 7 but the body is kinda weak you don't drop this against a full board if you could clear and drop this afterwards it would be good.
---
&gt;It's not a hyperbole.   
---
3-5 damage for 1 maybe 2 turns is not "heaps" of damage if you get into a position where you won't be taking any damage any further.  
---
&gt;It's not a hyperbole. Why do you think the best performing heroes are the ones who get some bonus stats early game?   
---
Because they quickly ramp up your amalgams in the first place. The rat kings is a guaranteed "give your amalgam +1/+2" totally bypassing the "switches each turn".  
---
&gt;And it's not like it will get bigger on its own. You still need to invest, which is expensive until later.  
---
It's an amalgam ... whatever you "invest" to build on your game plan it is going to benefit from also OR you are playing single buff minion to only the amalgam and plenty of the single buff minions have great stats in of themselves to tide you over to late game.  
---
&gt;I can't imagine any other card I'd take over a 2/2 amalgam in any situation under the current state of game but by all means ... educate me.  
---
Still waiting.
---
it feels handy
---
I think he read it as "Add a copy to your hand" so you can buy the same minion twice.
---
wow epic card 0 mana mountain giant
---
To be fair Wild Discard was pretty solid after RR
---
Most jesters were pretty clever, since they were often killed if they displeased the king.
---
Luckily the angry mob that is the internet is being held back by the massive plot hole in the firewall.
---
Whenever you're tabbed out from Hearthstone and it's your turn again, Deck Tracker lets you know by 'flashing' the Hearthstone icon on the task bar. This works with Battlegrounds too, also when it is time to choose a hero.
---
And if you didn't know, HDT actually has special features for BG!: it keeps tabs of the opponents' boards for you. It only displays information available to the player, of course‚Äîi.e. the last known board of a given opponent, no real-time tracking
---
c'thun was alse a special case with being the only card with wherever so we cant really say what is gonna happen but i still think it will be only both players hand, board and deck
---
Yugi used this to destroy the exodia deck in duel city
---
Yes
---
Death rattles would not trigger.
---
Sprint was only played with Prep anyways and Warlock doesn't need more card draw. The handsize is the real headline.
---
All those years of coin hero power would finally pay off!
---
They most likely are; even if I got knocked out from someone else, at least I definitely would have know "I don't have a chance"
---
yeah but then you would be wasting card slots teching against a tier 4 deck
---
Facts
---
Several questions
---
* Can this destroy jaraxxus by targetting a minion version of jaraxxus?
---
* Will this remove minions from the graveyard (rez pool)?
---
'nuff said.  My apologies /u/Hydralo.  It was clearly my wit that was lacking in picking up your brilliant word play.
---
Shifter Zerus
---
Gain 4 armor deal 4 damage
---
Yeah plus the card didn't see play initially, he wasn't even wrong. It was good like a year later.
---
Reverse "Don't you guys have phones?"
---
"Just don't take damage lol."
---
HOW DID YOU NOT USE THAT??? üòÇ
---
Here!
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying. If you can‚Äôt deal with 12 cards in your hand, just don‚Äôt play this card. I know my phone screen is big enough that this won‚Äôt be a problem for me, if it‚Äôs a problem for you just play a different deck or play on the desktop version.
---
The Handolorian
---
Because the joke clearly went over your heard. You acting stupid on the internet looks the same as you being actually stupid.
---
Better Sprint
---
Holy!, Can deathrattles activate from the deck?
---
Weird that they vaguely worded it.
---
God I hope I can keep prospective employers from finding out.  How do I scrub this from my resume?
---
any 1 drop with draw one attached to it is strong and will see play. period.
---
10/10 bro.
---
Sprint with a 4/4 body is really solid in zoo I think. Not giving up too much tempo and can get to burn, especially paired with the new 4 damage lifesteal card.
---
Well, if you have a hand size of 12...
---
Nefarian did really well too it seems.
---
Hey, just to let you know in case you guys don't already, there's a bug in battlegrounds where the game permanently hangs but matches are still ongoing. I closed the client and reconnected and was still stuck in the tavern. After half an hour and noticing that everyone else had already been defeated I realized I could concede and got first place.
---
It's possible to win but extremely fragile and inconsistent and also very hard to build as it requires very key high-tier minions that are suicide to go after early. 
---
I've played in the 5500-6500 range a lot and I see zero difference in anything lol. 
---
One thing I'll say is in the last couple days people have gotten even more aggressive, often not upgrading to 3 on turn 7, just to try and not lose that 7-8 extra HP haha.
---
Ironically this is one of the more interesting things about battlegrounds atm, when to just go full ham to save that extra HP. Plus this randomly takes out the early brann/lightfang luckbags.
---
Your title literally says "Now it is real" and references your card.  
---
Your card is not real, you are wrong and you'll no doubt be downvoted highly again.
---
Why don't *you* move? /r/hearthstoneStandard is awaiting
---
a 4/4 sprint with upside?
---
This might sound insane, but I love all three of you
---
Windfury and divine shield are also very strong. Imagine a windfury divine shield cave hydra...
---
Lmao fuck this game
---
Whenever a card like this is on there everyone comments 
---
‚ÄúBlizzard will never add this.‚Äù
---
Mama bear last never lucky.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Kings of Wild are Secret Mage and Snip-Lock. Big Priest has taken a large dive, and is around tier 4.
---
Thx for the feedbask, Noz is in the deck as it is a cool new dragon that fits nicely into the deck but i'd be happy to remove him. Presuming they fix evolve shaman before the Descent the meta should move slightly slower. Also so many descent of dragons cards aim for a slower game plan which is where this deck should shine.
---
I didn't get a chance to use my free ticket to play the Brawliseum before you disabled it. How come I get no compensation?
---
Ok, but based on a quick Google search on "plot hole" definition, I don't think OP is using that phrase correctly O.o
---
No problem, from what I've seen on here the 3 goldens don't combine.
---
New?
---
Lol they were so hopeful
---
Really? Last I checked warlock didn't get a new weapon. I'm confused. This is very clearly not real. Methinks you should delete this because posting created cards during reveal season is a very bad move. It's basically taboo.
---
I play Barnes
---
The EVIL classes get 3 legendaries, the League of Explorer classes get 2 legendaries. Confirmed by the devs.
---
Nothing to compensate, hunter have had an extra legendary since TGT, the Devs just wanted all classes to have 2 non-Galakrond based legendaries since Galakrond is free.
---
The last time this was used was with c'th and it did target rez pool
---
Jesus Christ....
---
Blizzard making that preorder look appealing tn ngl
---
King of the Goons.
---
I never said the complete card is real, i just said "it" is real. As the new released card has a unusual effect, which this card also has, im obviously refering to the effect.
---
[Fatecleaver](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Fatecleaver) anyone? I guess no one plays Arena...
---
You made a ‚Äústart of game effect‚Äù which is completely and unbelievably different to putting this effect on a high cost minion
---
Wait why the fuck is this a rogue exclusive? This is the card everybody needs to counter shuffle decks... of which ROGUE is a huge culprit.
---
Guess what? I got 300 gold.  Thats why I always start a brawl even if I never get a chance to play / finish it.

it didn't, since someone just killed warlock

---
Alley cat doesn't even have tooth jewelry. Ugh.
---
Current ranking system is broken, try not to obsess over that number. I sure hope it's just a placeholder for something better.
---
&gt;  the meta should move slightly slower
---
Not really. I intend to limit my crafts in the first week and start immediately with Galakrond miracle rogue and Galakrond Zoo Warlock. On top of that, Mage and Hunter will go fast as well. 
---
Your deck is mid-rangey but lacks the tools to stand up vs aggro.
---
No. From the top of my head, it's supposed to be \~12.5% at T2 and \~9% at T3.
---
I know there are people who work hard on the animations, but a fast mode would be something I'd be interested in. Some card games like Slay the Spire have a fast mode.
