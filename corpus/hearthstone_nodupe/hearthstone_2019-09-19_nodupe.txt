well now I know where that heroe comes from! Congratulations, considering how frustrating and time consuming these adventure can get you deserve to boast. Sure there are people who happily say they one with just a few tries, but I dont believe them, Ive never finished any HS adventure because I play to have fun, not get bogged down in frustration.

---
There are too many good cards that need synergy with other good cards that are all high rarity (epic-legendary), which forces players who want the "full experience" to spend a bunch of money or gold to even get a chance at getting the card via dust. 
---
Problem isn't the gameplay, but the way people get cards, which is $$$
---
Does Reno look like a man who lived his life sucking sparkly jewels hard enough to start casting spells?
---
Or perhaps you're too Blinded By Your Love of the Game Ferengi does exist but there didn't have to be this much level of RNG in Hearthstone and as far as unstable portal goes that was one card but do you realize how many cards there are that generate cards especially for mage and Road and priest it's really sad that there people fighting me on this it really is
---
As someone who has played nothing but tavern brawls and the Dalaran adventure since the last expac, yes. I would buy it.
---
Do you like the singleplayer content? Because the adventure is definitely not worth it if you're just here for the packs.
---
I'm a fan of his videos, but I do not agree at all with his last point in the video. The game is the healthiest it's ever been at this point, but that's bad because it's expensive? So he would rather the game be less balanced and cheaper? No idea where he's coming from with that.
---
I'm not blinded by my love of the game, I recognize that there are flaws and things that not everyone will love, my point is that if you have disliked things like the level of RNG in the game since journey to ungoro, there's no need for you to be here. Unless you still actively play the game (which I wouldn't understand why you do based on how heavily you dislike the game) you're like a Path of Exile player commenting in the Diablo subreddit. Cool, you don't like the game, so just play and participate in the game(s) that you do like and let us play and participate in ours.
---
They have to make the transition from spending every time they hit 100 to saving at some point if they want to start taking advantage of the benefits that come with opening the majority of your packs from a set toward the beginning of its time in Standard. It's true they'll get the same amount of cards either way, but the timing of when you open certain cards can save you hundreds or even thousands of dust.
---
Like you said, we can't accurately predict whether or not the next set will hold less value overall, but at the very least they'll be able to start getting those aforementioned potential benefits as soon as possible while biting the bullet and crafting what they need from older sets as they need it. Otherwise, they'll always be playing this awkward game of never quite taking as much advantage of front loading packs as they could while hoping they open good cards from older sets.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt think of it as buying packs, but rather just the adventure. Packs are a bonus. If you enjoy the idea of this adventure play style then probably. Also though, do you see yourself replaying it countless times? If so then 100%. If maybe only a few times I would wait and spend your gold on specifics Wong‚Äôs that seem the most fun.
---
If you‚Äôre in it for the packs I would spend gold on arena, on packs, or save for next expansion.
---
Yeah, some of the permanent treasures would indeed carry over. How did you get Gnomebliterator to deal 100 instead of the regular 10?
---

---
Good knowledge
---
[[[Random]]]
---
To clarify (because I might be getting the name wrong), there's a treasure in the new adventure which reduces the cost of your cards by (1) whenever you play an odd-cost card. I played Muckmorpher for (5), which then transformed into the 10-cost Colossus, thus not triggering the treasure (if it had triggered, the Soul of the Murloc in my hand would cost 1).
---
Ha! True, maybe I‚Äôll be back if I can beat that first try :P
---
Not much of a guide.But definitely cool!
---
Wha-
---
Why do we even need to be forced to play normal to begin with? Just allow us to play heroic from the start.
---
Old God. Old God!! Old Gooooooood!!!!
---
I think the format fit really well with Kobold and Catacomb: diving into a cave and finding treasure along the way. However, it doesn‚Äôt make as much sense with the later expansions. For example, why should invading a city(RoS) be like diving into a cave? Nonetheless, I still enjoy the format but agree that it‚Äôs getting repetitive. There should be a room for improvement.
---
It will not
---
Also press 3 dots
---
Previous adventures have gone down by $5 each wing you buy/700g you spend.
---
Well that wasn‚Äôt very creative
---
Nice

It's like a normal Bazaar Bob encounter. You improve your deck, then fight that battle again. It's worth noting that if you can get extra copies of Hearthstone (the card in question), you can get infinite Bazaar Bob entrances. I did this with Hex Lord Malacras until my deck was insane.

It could even be that the expansion was profitable, just not profitable enough to satisfy papa Blizz. You can see this in the stock market too: stocks can lose value just because the company grew less than expected, even if the expected value was idealistic at worst.

They really need to add a solid priest board clear into the classic set. Printing an absurdly powerful one each standard year is simply unsustainable (which I guess must be their greater plan for wild). I am a proponent of bringing lightbomb into evergreen.
---
The first wing of Tombs of Terror has a twist. At the start of each game, Cast When Drawn cards that summon Murlocs are shuffled into your deck. More and more of them are shuffled into your deck as you progress in your run. These are duplicates.

How???

Ouch. That sucks.
---
Thank you very much, and year a bit more detail there wouldnt be a bad idea :)
---
The problem arises with snip snap itself. Why u ask? U can say an odd warrior or wild druid cant lose to it cause of their immense armour. Well technically speaking thats wrong. 
---
HS is an online video game. Its card game that should u be able to play it on a physical adaptation there would be no turn time limit.
---
 The turn time limit only exists cause its an online game. A person could out of spite not touch the game and drag it for hours.
---
 Example MtG Arena. Its an adaption of the physical version in which ive played since i was a kid and there was no worries about time.
---
 Online version has a turn time limit for obvious reasons. Meaning that as soon as u can discount ur snip snap to zero u would win.
---
 Thats idiotic and should never exist and its solely accepted cause the turn time limit makes it not possible to go over the top.
---
No minions shold be able to cost 0. Summoning portal has that specification so why cant this ?
---
Coin and preparation
---
wow im sleeves addicted i woulddefinetly play these !!!
---
If you are really willing to spend so much money at one game only to have enough cards for a few meta decks for a couple months until you have to buy more packs to stay relevant, sure....
---
Penises everywhere.
---
Thats 2400 mana dust btw
---
Dude, if you have that much money left over. Invite a girl to a nice dinner and invest into her instead
---
It's already been posted here.
---
Very good looking, definitely better than any cardback made by Blizzard in the last couple months if not a whole year.
---
Inb4 divine spirit to 4 mana and good luck to priests.
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are three of them!
---
Honestly I‚Äôm a wild player so I‚Äôm more biased but I would recommend when the new set comes out just get 50 of all of them if you want to throw that much money away
---
Yay :) 
---
Thank you very much !
---
It was already said but with Mind Blast getting yeeted to wild, HoFing Divine spirit and/or Inner fire Priest gets absolutely thrashed. And silence standard priest (if there is still such a deck) will drop like 30% in power level. As infuriating as it may be to see a priest kill you in turn 5 with 2x Divine etc there are faster and better decks
---
I think Alchemist Stone is probably the best passive as well.  We tried nerfing it a few ways but it ended up losing so much of it's fun factor so we just changed it's offering rate.  The only passive I'd personally pick over it is VIP Memembership, but I have a soft spot for it.  But yea, mana cheating is much harder to come by so you can't rely on it in Heroic as much as Heist.
---
I think having a static final boss has some downsides, but I sometimes do like knowing what I'm working my way towards.  300 Health vs 150 Health changes what my deck composition looks like and how I draft my cards.  I'd be curious how you feel about it in the later weeks once some of the more tougher bosses get added to the pool.  Some of them come really fast out of the gate but have little gas so you can't be as greedy with your decks.
---
Gorebite is up there as one of the hardest early bosses. There might be a couple more in wings 3/4 that are harder as far as early bosses go.  We'll be keeping an eye on individual boss difficulty and see if we need to make adjustments on a case by case basis.
---
Anyways, interesting read for me, as a player and designer.  I hope you keep posting once the other wings comes out as I'd like to hear how things change for you.
---
Good luck with the rest of your runs!
---
This is absolutely amazing. If this was real I'd use it in a heartbeat
---
Thank you very much, that made me very happy :D !
---
If you're brand new to the game, I'd slow play it. Buy a bundle or two of classic and play with cards til you figure out what you like to play and what classes you like playing.
---
So you're in the minority of people that actually know you can change the card back. I'm playing against people with the Mark of Hakkar card back in 90% of my games.
---
The problem with HSreplay data is that all the bad and mobile players lower the winrate shown there. Everybody is talking about the deck and everyone wants to try it.
---

---
wyrm
---
Long story.  I got the VIP card to get the improved tavern with more points (6). I chose the Bob‚Äôs bombastic deck for 4 points. It replaces your cards with treasure and quest reward cards, etc. I had a couple points left so I tripled up that big card that does 20 damage at the end of the round. I also picked the option where one of your cards gets 3 cheaper, and it randomly picked the wand treasure.  So when the next game started I got the wand (which was 0), threw it down, and all three of the big guys I tripled popped up for 0 each. Haha. The odds of all that happening are staggering, hence the boner.
---
not something extraordinary, you get alot of sinergy with murlocs with the first plague...
---
Better than Blizzard!
---
game is 100% decks that play cards. zero variety.
---
He's actually wrong. Nozari restores the enemy to the maximum health they've had that you left them on on your last run, so for example I left him on 10 HP and that's what he was restored to, as opposed to a full 100, which is the original limit for that phase.
---
Hot take - Extra Arms is perfectly fine at 2 mana if Divine Spirit gets sent to HoF. I don‚Äôt mind losing to turn 1 Northshire that gets 1737 arms on turn 2. It sucks, but you can play around it sometimes.
---
There is literally no way to play around Divine Favor outside of ‚Äúkill everything Priest plays‚Äù, which is not fun or realistic. That card is laughably overdue to get the boot. ü•æ

Rotate the entire Classic set for every class. It‚Äôs well past overdue. Magic the Gathering was only two years old when type 2 (standard) was invented. Hearthstone is 6 years old and we still have to play with the same core set. It truly needs to go. The entire thing.
---
Not quite what was planned...
---
Or hope they draw bad. Like most combo decks the either roll you over or lose to themselves.
---
I play Aggro Warrior when I am climbing the ladder. It has a decent match up against everything except basically control warrior. You can sometimes snowball Shaman with Frothing Berserker for a turn 5 or 6 win. Druid is more tough, but you're favored the first like 5-6 turns. Quest Rogue also should be easy to beat.
---
 Brolio#2548 80g quest trade EU. You go first please.
---
First wing shuffles a load of duplicate cards into your own deck
---
The vast majority were nerfed in practice. Generally, the nerf text says that a card was changed. So I think with a card like stonehill, it's hard to argue it wasn't nerfed in the sense that nerfs have been in the past.
---
"Too many cards are affected" and "people would expect it for other cards" sound like shitty excuses. I get that they don't want to give out a lot of dust, but that's what they're supposed to do when they nerf cards. If they didn't want to give refunds for the cards they nerfed, they shouldn't have nerfed them.
---
Also I like the simplicity and the details in the water &lt;3
---
Wow that means a much to me :D !
---
Which is a problem for the devs ‚Äì the community is torn between 'that's great, another!' and 'come on please give me something else already'. If you keep in mind people tend to voice discontet a lot more than praise, I guess the statistics show a lot of the playerbase likes it. And of course, it's a lot cheaper to make a variant of existing code, than to come up with something completely new (which might even be hated).

How cool, thank you so much :D !
---
It says play but I don't think there's any card in the game that actually "plays" another card. Something only counts as being played if you actually play it from hand. It should say "put three random secrets onto the battlefield". Something something "Blizzard consistency", but it does ACT consistently with how these mechanics work rather than the text accurately reflecting what it does.
---

To unlock content f2p and (eventually) get a cardback. But there really isn‚Äôt that great a pull and I could see myself giving up on it. This expansion has been the least exciting for me and has pushed me close to giving up on the game.
---
Exactly. It feels like every single Priest deck is just window dressing to get this combo out.
---
That makes me really happy, thank you very much :D 
---
It took me for ages and i got lots of help from a very talented artist friend of mine so i really cant tell for sure :)
---
Maybe it restores to either the amount of health you left him with, OR his max health limit for the phase, depending on what's closer. That would make sense.
---
Holy... This is amazing! Hope they'll add this to the game

He could have used sir Finley to bring boss to 1 hp before finishing it with Reno. Doing 300-0 in normal run is reasonably easy, I did both wings on my first attempts but on heroic...lets say it's "little"  more difficult, for starters the plague's hero power base cost in third phase is 10 mana. I'm not saying it's not possible, I'm just curious about details.

Theres 4 so if you buy 3 the last one is free?
---
Update: just finished the animation now after like 3 whole minutes T _ T
---
Deathwing is a disenchant
---
Remember they get a replacement card.
---
How about:
---
Divine Wrath
---
Spell - 2 mana
---
Wish for the perfect card.
---
You wanna be thicc? I wanna be thicc!
---
There are like two cards for which it's not a nerf. Overall, it's a *huge* nerf to the mechanic and every card that has it. It's like they changed the charge mechanic to just straight up make it rush. I really don't understand the apologetics.
---
Both dis in my view.
---
Check out dekkster gaming. Known for hitting legend with off meta decks.
---
Look at the history bar
---
Both not very useful then?
---
What? I literally tried to use a strategy to accumulate the maximum  fatigue as possible in previous phases, but it resets...?
---
Well then, never trying it again.

I haven't switched from the heroic Karazhan blue/pink portal back for years, but this would be an instaswitch for me.
---
A well deserved gold post, thanks for the art!
---
I‚Äôd like to watch a video of someone making something like this just to see how it‚Äôs all done.
---
they always come back around.
---
I‚Äôd use it in a hearthbeat
---
I mean isn‚Äôt that kind of like what a New Game Plus is?
---
Think Diablo or Borderlands or Destiny: You beat the mission on normal, get some gear, use that to beat Hard, get some better gear, use that to take on the next difficulty level, etc.
---
It‚Äôs not cheap, it‚Äôs progression.
---
Judging by the way Blizzard designed these Plague Lord bosses (to be tackled over the course of multiple runs) it seems like they are shooting for a more ‚Äòprogression-oriented‚Äô Dungeon Run, so I really don‚Äôt see why unlocks shouldn‚Äôt be shared.
---
If you don‚Äôt like your first Heroic runs being easier, roll with the default gear. That option wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.
---
Tyrion is not a bitch who skips leg day!
---
Yeah at the 200 and 100 health mark
---
Greenskin is definitely not necessary
---
Reno seems so much weaker than finly, what are your thoughts?
---
Great report, as always!
---
Is that a...
---
Makes sense imo
---
I would say titanic ring is one of the best treasures in wing 1.
---
Can you submit this to Hearthstone?  It's amazing!  I want it!
---
Zoo Warlock has a 61% winrate against quest druid, it's fairly balanced
---
On a different note, does killing the same plaguelord count towards sr. tomb diver progress?
---
You did a good job, so you do worth it. The proof is post itself.
---
Steel your heart and your soul will shine brighter than a thousand suns
---
Do I just need a better deck? It is budget so its all cheap cards.
---
This is not fair use. 
---
Fair use is generally for educational, critique, news, research, or derivative works (and derivative works is super sketch).
---
This is none of those things.
---
Edit: also fair use is a *legal defense*, it works to defend yourself from the suit after you appear in court, it doesn't restrain them from filing.
---
Just to give us some insight, what's the QA process like over there?
---
Well played.
---
Try not to disenchant classic cards if you can help it. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and gone through bouts of being a free to play player. I‚Äôve regretted disenchanting seemingly unplayable classic cards only to end up crafting them again more times than I can count.
---
People get it wrapped up in their identities, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Just like fan boy stuff. grow up, consume rationally. There‚Äôs a million games out there, go play something else if you feel like you‚Äôre getting screwed.
---
The card quality difference between neutral and class cards is gonna depend on what class your playing the discover card in as well as what the target cards are. On average yeah most things were probably slightly nerfed but that doesnt change the fact that evaluating each card individually would be subjective and difficult
---
A murloc isn't an ALL. Nihtmare Amalgam is ALL.
---
I want that to be in the game so badly.
---
It exists, but i have only seen it once in 50 bosses so it might as well not exist
---
That would be so obnoxious to play
---
Had a run recently where I lined up two treasures to do broken things (playing even cards resets your hero power, playing even cards reduces the cost of your cards in hand by 1) but the cards themselves were just whatever.
---
the OG combo, the conversation basically becomes whether you think that OTK combos should exist in any form in HS
---
personally I don't like them, but the question is do we want the game to be long drawn out control/value mirrors forever. Again personally I do, but I can see why some wouldn't
---
Well I don't live in the US, so I think even if Blizzard or anyone files a suit it's very unlikely that my home country would even bother. Anyway I don't want to breach anyone copyright and was hoping to ask for permission, it is still better to be safe than sorry. Thanks for replying.
---
Cheers! :D
---
PETA?yea, yea...
---
Better than most actual card backs.
---
Heyho looking for someone to trade the quest
---
Xanar#2352 EU i can show you the quest - you go first
---
Both leagues teaming up to fight the Old Gods.
---
I was in the same boat except it was 4 health for me.
---
My real "feels bad, man" moment came on the second plague lord when I thought I was in good shape to win first try until it got a Tree of Life off Yogg. Fortunately it only reset to 100 health instead of 300 but I got him back down to 9 before drying in my first try.
---
Calm down. Let's fix Titanic Lackey first. One step at a time.
---
There is most likely technical limitations that prevents stuff like this from being done (while running well enough on all the supported device).  Fanmade cardback do not follow those specifications, and generally have a lot more freedom.
---
This cardback, and many other are "2d" and might not translate easily to 3D. 
---
And lastly, we have plenty of good one already. It's just that the one we cannot get are always going to seem more desirable.  It's been like that since the beginning of time with "fanmade skin".
---
 Nice to have good old Tirion back in standard

---
wait- the treasures actually stay in your deck???  That's amazing
---
All of those cards would be played in a Quest Shaman deck in wild anyways. Every Control Shaman runs Hagatha's Scheme and Sludge Belcher, and Questing + Shudder in a quest deck. The only card in hand that is "out of place" is Witchwood Piper.
---
Hopefully it wasn't a boss, or else you sat there for 5 hours
---
I love that the one of the few pieces of quality content on this sub is buried underneath 20+ shitposts on the front page.
---
Yes sir. That's probably why they made the requirements to activate the Hero Power so steep!
---
A bit too vitriolic for my taste, but I do believe that HS' current pricing model is predatory.
---
They went fully digital to separate themselves from the burden of physical boosters, but the pricing is very similar to those physical boosters that have material value and requires shipping, and maintenance, and insurance for theft, and everything like that.
---
Plus, everything else they release is priced based on the boosters' price. An adventure should cost around X because it grants you Y number of packs and include an adventure. An arena ticket costs X because it includes at least 1 pack, as well as potentially going infinite if you can sustain a roughly 72% win rate.
---
Ah, the pro-gamer turn 1
---
Coin into Kalegos
---
nah, dude.  I'm really jones'ing for that second 4/2 weapon.
---
While I don't usually get on Hearthstone's case about consistent wording, in this case it's important.  "Play" means something very specific in Hearthstone and is a common effect trigger.  Other words like "summon", "cast", "put", etc. are more interchangeable but "play" should be sacrosanct for this reason.  They should change the wording for Mysterious Tome for the next update.
---
I agree, I wouldn't have assumed that Mysterious Tome would count towards Jr. Tomb Diver EXCEPT that it specifically says "play".
---
harvesting souls to power a magical WMD, nice
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
It's mana wyrm nerf all over again. I love mage but right now it's very difficult to survive the amount of damage most classes can do,ice barrier/khartuts help a bit, but often it isn't enough. When I manage to stabilize I'm often around 10 hp and I get killed in the next few turns. I hope to see good cards for mage next expansion, not just one or two broken cards that keep the class alive.
---
I prefer [Jaina version](https://i.imgflip.com/22ole2.jpg)
---
The Warlock quest reward is really quite good. It's a bit too dependent on drawing plot twist, is all. With some support it will be pretty decent.
---
thanks
---
Soon. It's already basically safe to just assume a priest always has at least one boardclear in hand. 
---
Combined with resurrection effects "mono board clear" is actually probably a really resilient deck.
---
the penultimate
---
There's still a major difference between what you're suggesting could be done with Charge and what had been done with Discover.
---
Discover is still functionally Discover with it just being better than random card generation. It's just that very good choices come up a bit less often than they did previously.
---
Your theoretical change to Charge would make it no longer Charge, being even worse than Rush.
---
One of the reasons priests work better in wild is that games are generally longer.
---
Ahhhhhhh shit
---
Hey, thanks! I thought it in my head when I saw it and figured it‚Äôd be good enough for Reddit lol
---
I'm ashamed of how long it took me to realize it was in a different language and not just jibberish
---
So...I am a game developer, and would like to see game developers reduce crunch; I‚Äôm paying attention to orgs like Game Worker‚Äôs Unite.
---
Just going to note if you want to push against crunch in game development, asking for more frequent content releases is NOT how you achieve that.  In fact that does the opposite.
---
A more frequent release/update schedule almost always means more crunch.  A slower release schedule almost always means less crunch.
---
If your actual goal is to reduce crunch culture in game development, please remember that.
---
What makes Tombs of Terror repetitive while the Great Dalaran Heist is expansive?
---
What made Dungeon Run, a mode where you only had basic classes and their hero powers to work with, amazing while the Witchwood Hunt, a mode that offered a great deal more variety when it came to the actual playable characters, boring?
---
A frickin plus my dude.
---
Which hero power?  I've had it work with amateur mage (the first one)...
---
He plays hearthstone, don‚Äôt be too surprised.
---
Aggro warrior ayaya
---
That's beautiful

Hey therealmemeforce, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Agreed, most times if you can win a match you can win by a lot and keep the game stalled long enough to get back to 100 health before lethal, giving you double HP for the last fight.
---
But do NOT use Thekal.  Your armor does not carry through from match to match (although I was still able to get back to 100hp before the finale).
---
if you got to rank 16 than your deck is cutting it against at least half of the meta decks. if you're getting stomped by the other half that's still a 50% winrate which as someone with a lot still to learn about the game you should be happy with. sounds like you'd rather just farm noobs with starter decks than challenge yourself and improve. everyone has win streaks and loss streaks. a lot of times i've felt like i hit a wall with a particular deck but most times i eventually hit another win streak and kept climbing.
---
You can do 256 with an empty board.
---
I thought that titanic ring was the 2/2 buff
---
Cards used in a winning heroic run turn golden
---
Anshim#2673 NA  80g quest - You can watch my stream for proof that I got the quest then you go first.
---
You can shuffle even more if you happen to have Archmage Vargoth too!
---
I am now very upset that the possibility of this being real is very low. This is sensational. Dear lord.
---
That‚Äôs what would happen so big oof
---
craft a specific legendary would not be that good for a new player
---
we call it... decent worldbuilding
---
Ehhhh, anything official by blizzard? I'd rather not bank on speculation. No offense.
---
How?
---
In tombs of terror I got bob to make her cost zero. sheer luck
---
In deck against a plague Lord, made a 31/2 book due to the sword treasure. but In hand? That's is some impressive dedication to knowledge haha
---
You already were legend before you started that game. I think it broke.
---
Who won? Your Opponent or You(r Opponent)?
---
Prob vip then?
---
Yes there is but every time I encounter it, it has 1 secret and 2 secret-based minions. I've only ever been able to activate Jr. Tomb Diver's battlecry once.
---
Reminds me of trumps deck where his wincon was just killing off his tinyfins.
---
your opponent won.
---
Mecha'Thuned the fucker. Very satisfying. Blew up the board with a twisting nether off a random zephrus from astral riff. (Had that sweet "play an odd card to reduce cost of cards by 1).
