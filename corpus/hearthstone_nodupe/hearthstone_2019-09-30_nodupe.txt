Same difference. Downvotes were for non-contributing content altogether, not because you disagree with what was said. Something you apparently do given you've already downvoted me, presumably over no reason other than that you're upset.

Not at all. If you log on to MTGA right now, they will give you over a dozen starter decks, plus many more packs for free. It's also 20 bucks to get a "season pass" type of deal that nets you many card packs, gold, and gems. It is a lot easier to get into MTGA right now if you are a newbie price wise. Hearthstone is insane. You get 1 pack a week with lousy cards. You can grind 100 gold a day if you have absolutely no life and only play hearthstone.
---
No, not really. Downvoting on posts is exactly to discourage people from posting that kind of content on the subreddit they're on. You really think people would go to subreddits if the highest upvoted content was the MOST RELEVANT and not the MOST LIKED?
---
Some streamers have been using it lately, so maybe people are memedecking it.
---
It also probably should be mentioned that he's got no Plague of Deaths in hand.  
---
As soon as I realised that he passed a turn and didn't clear my board again, I knew what happened.
---
I played quest rogue to rank 4 and then got bored and switched to druid.
---

---
Questing explorer and underbelly fence fit the archetype but they are just bad cards that aren't in my deck.
---
Same, Whizbang and Zayle (yes, I finally cracked) were the two cards that kept me playing until I was able to afford more expensive decks

Oh so he's rich, just like Bernie. And old and white. Just like Bernie. And implemented governement healthcare in Massachusetts. Just like Bernie wants to do for the nation.

‚ÄúOk‚Äù üñïüèª
---
Im pretty sure whizbang has a below 50% winrate. I think one of the priest iterations had a below 45%. I wouldnt consider his decks top tier.
---
Thank you for doing the math, I was feeling lazy :).  But that's the fun part of randomness, creates very interesting/tense situations that rarely affect the game.
---
Shouldnt explain your own joke. Makes it better for people that have no idea what happened
---
Bad for tournaments I'd say
---
 I was against the plague lord of madness
---
Oow yeah of course
---
Would it be more fair rather than nerfing any particular card to make it so echo cards cannot be reduced below (1)? It would just prevent combos like this in the future if echo is ever revisited.
---
No. Clever Disguise gives you two random spells from two random classes. Sometimes both cards come from the same class but it's only about 12.5% of the time.
---
If you think this simply about the game then you probably have a lot of room for improvement yourself and have a big mindset problem and should focus on that not on calling to nerf cards that beat you.
---
The card is gross in aggro decks when they curve out and also draw zeph cause that's not very beatable but it doesn't happen often enough for those decks to be tier 1.
---
In other kinds of decks like druid and otk paladin zephrys is pretty important and timing zeph and how you use it is very matchup dependent and game-state dependent, so if you're the better player you can gain an edge from being able to recognize when to use him or when to force the other player to need him or force it out in general if you have good refill/followup.
---
It‚Äôs not just that. I always have cards to play on curve. Plus rouge has this card that if you have a card from another class gain 1/1 and rush. That card fucking sucks. Rouge doesn‚Äôt need to be deleted but my god it needs to be gravity slammed by the nerf hammer and then shove grip up Valeeras ass
---
If you are good enough, play hours every day, and get exceptionally lucky, then sure you can do just that. To say what you said as if any significant portion of the player base is willing to do that, is laughable.
---
You sound exactly like some corporate suit defending loot boxes (which this game's card packs are, if you forgot). In a game where playing only gets you ~1 - 2 loot boxes a day, you have up until the next release before even more cards are released to get the cards you need (which again you get at random). All the while missing out while players who did pay the premium enjoy the season... and its only 50$, for just 50$ I could probably get everything I need to- FUCK OFF. Oh look my friend opened a legendary, that could have been me if I just bought- FUCK OFF. Oh look they'll only charge me 50$ for 60 packs of the next set! I better hurry its only there for a limited- FUCK OFF.
---
They are just like any other fremium game, try to convince me otherwise.
---
Edit: Also, arguably the most fun time is the first 2 - 3 weeks where people are actually experimenting and playing interesting things. After that the meta regresses into most everybody just playing the same copy pasted decks, and if you are free to play only, you don't get to experiment with everyone else.
---
One was inspired to take a break
---
Its more about being able to play with the new cards and interactions
---
Wrong. They're always from the same class.
---
GOD I hop those leaks are real. I miss playing Renounce Warlock. 
---
I can play it in wild but in there my winchance is even lower.
---
[deleted]
---
I feel like I can be more creative in magic. I also like and dislike having to draw mana. Having mana guaranteed can make certain decks feel very similar turn after turn each game.
---
Thanks and which type of Combe is best?
---
Malygos,togwaggle,star aligner...
---
I would say the Toggwaggle, NorthSea Kraken, Star Aligner. Its basically the Toggwaggle combo but with the Kraken you can active the Star Aligner as well. On top of that it gives an extra 9-drop for the psychmelon draw
---
shit, you're right! I've been playing quest rogue for the whole month and never realized it.
---
thx

Dude, crack is reasonable compared to magic. Shit, 40k is reasonable compared to magic!
---
&gt;Most of the games I have lost have been because of this card.  
---
Wow, so like what ... 90% win rate if Zephrys wasn't in the game?  You must be really good at this game!  
---
Love how you conveniently ignore the fact that people have to run singleton decks to ideally a detriment to run this card anyway.

---
So he's definitely not out of line. Got it.
---
It's a dead card in most druid matches unless they manage to get through their deck and that's not going to happen all that often.  
---
Paladin well ... lens into scales is the broken part of that deck. Zephrys is again a dead card for the most part unless they get right through their deck.
---
They'll be in standard until 2021, so I would caution against it. If you are done opening RoS packs (although you were almost definitely get a few along the way from events and whatnot), then I think you can safely dust Nozari. Rhyssa could see play if Paladin gets some new secrets in any of the next 4 expansions.
---
Whiz since it‚Äôs all mine classes and has updated to the latest expansion
---
I mean miles exist.
---
Priest is fine. Sure thing.
---
I can only offer my thoughts on it. Bright wing gives a little better aggro on early and has dragon synergies. And sometimes the hand becomes cluttered with spells making the echo sometimes annoying. But face collector is certainly better in other scenarios. Just my 2 cents.
---
I would too
---
Pretty sure he was asking for the quest. I had this happen the other day but after a minute I asked if they were going to challengeb and was met with 'i was ask for yours' and the unfriend
---
I really am hoping we see a Hearthstone Lite sometime. Download without all the smoke and mirrors, just the raw game without special effects, animations, moving pieces, etc.
---
Aight lissen! Ima need 2 more videos from you to help me get through next week. 
---
Scratch that, make it 3. 
---
Joke aside, awesome editing!
---
Sure, but you said it as if it's a well-established pattern that health carries over and armor does not.  This is the first instance where this comes up (it's not like your health is going to carry over in constructed games), so it's reasonable to expect either one.  Although I believe we did already know that plaguelords don't keep armor between runs.

Isn‚Äôt kazakuss He dragons in World of Warcraft

Ah... you might be right about this. They unfriended me before I had a chance to ask.
---

---
This post doesn‚Äôt have all the awards so it sucks
---
&gt;There is also some thought that Kazakus is a dragon.
---
That's confirmed. You can see his Dragon Form in the MSoG trailer and there was an oficial lore post stating he "definitely ISN'T a dragon" with a sarcastic tone.
---

---
&gt;The point of playing is to win
---
That is *a* point of playing.  If it were the only aim, then Heroic mode wouldn't need to exist, because people would be happy cruising through Normal and getting easy victories.  For a lot of people, winning is only rewarding if it is a challenge.  And starting from 1 hp is certainly a challenge, which would make for a very satisfying victory I would think.
---
I'm actually a highly deliberate and risk-averse person, but I don't perceive any risk in what OP did.  It seems like free value (entertainment, sociality, karma) to me.

&gt;I'm not going to change my [moral/philosophical] position because you think risky behavior should be lauded,
---
earlier: 
---
&gt;I'm perplexed as to why we're still discussing this as though there's deeper layers to it.
---
I just *knew* there were deeper layers to it!
---
I dont think blaming the hearthstone community is fair. If u are looking for people to play or discuss hearthstone with, there are so many individuals in this subreddit who are nice enough to do the same.
---
Are there not enough samples for anyfin paladin or mill rogue? I feel that anyfin has at least gotten some fun stuff with tip the scales and prismatic lense. Mill rogue is still pretty tough to play but i saw a few variants on my climb through ladder
---
How to go face?

If you want to proclaim that you won this discussion so that we can stop talking about an issue that for me was over and done with on my first comment, you are free to do so; I was content to simply end at the 'agree to disagree' state I was in as of last comment.
---
I feel like this isn't going to end until you somehow obtain a victory state, so if that's what you need, consider this an official sanction.
---
Get iphone 11 pro
---
If it really bothers you, just craft the couple of cards you're missing.
---
If you're missing mostly legendary cards, it really would be more efficient to craft them rather then spending tens of thousands of gold hoping you'll finally open them.
---
If you're missing mostly commons and rares, then the amount of dust you'd spend to complete your collection is really rather minimal.
---
Even then, the worst way to obtain a worthwhile Wild collection for playing in the format is opening Wild Packs. So little of each individual set sees play in Wild that you could open fifty packs of GvG, TGT, and MSoG, and just about any Epic and Legendary card you open would be worthless as far as Wild playability is concerned.
---
If Blizzard and Team 5 ever make Wild card packs purchasable with gold, it would need to be curated set full of cards that actually see play in the format, not just throwing up the rotated expansions.
---
I had this combo, as well as a guaranteed 1 drop in my opening hand. It was so dirty.  At least until the final boss, when I got about 45 cards deep and never drew unstable evolution.
---
Well when you're casting it 50 times, who has the patience to check for anything but the charge glow?
---
That fucking genie.. I don't think it reads deathrattles so this must be a fairly standard offering.
---
Oh, ohhh. Yea it was kinda weird that no class used green. I guess I have to play with rexx more often.
---
Forgot about hunter. Please don't kill me.
---
He is strong, but you can absolutely deal with him if you have a good deck.
---
Lol you're right
---
Didn't take the time for reinstalling or googling. Just used my reliable memory. That went well.
---
I did not hit her
---
Nothing much to see. 
---
The druid played his quest on turn 2, having 1 mana leftover, then he also wasted his coin to activate the quest even if he already had unspent mana.
---
So if you concede the turn after he plays thekal will his health be 1 when you come back?
---
Unless your comment is sMaLl InDiE cOmPaNy or OuTjErKeD aGaIn, it'll probably get downvoted

YES

This is correct.

Hello, I am a Hearthstone player from China. I recently encountered the same thing as you, my game account was banned due to play sn1p-sn4p. But slightly different from your situation, China's Hearthstone legend is run by a third-party company called NetEase. This third-party company does nothing. He ignored the player's re-examination request. They simply don't want to solve this matter.
---
Due to China's policy, Chinese Hearthstone players can't reach forums such as reddit. But because of the inaction of this third-party company, there are more and more situations like yours happening. So a few Chinese players came out to come to you for help - like me. I sent a private message to the designer on reddit, but the designer did not reply to me.
---
I don't know what to do now, do I send a post like you to explain my situation? But what if no one sees this post? Or do I have to wait for the designer to give me a reply?
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks dude I really appreciate that!!
---
The moment when you realize you play too much Wild and there actually is a hunter class
---
Hey :)
---
It's not an otk if it takes til turn 6 to do it.
---
He offers Pyroblast some of the time when he's not sure what else to give you and you have 10 mana next turn, not simply because it's lethal.
---
Mark's Blessing
---
A deck can only hold 60 cards‚Ä¶ at least, that‚Äôs true during the game. I don‚Äôt know if there are methods to go over the limit during drafting in PvE.
---
This post trigerred a literal ton of fat chicks, and I commend and respect you for that.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to stick a board unless you can build it big and fast. 
---
On the bright side, the phases only get easier so the remaining 200 HP shouldn‚Äôt be as bad.
---
# N E V E R S K I P D I G D A Y

I mean my comment on the time it was made, not the post itself. Had -ve votes at that time. That's strange for me.
---
Well, if it's common knowledge, why does nobody know Zul'jin's Sorry emote?
---
Amazing! I didn't know the Internet Explorer could play Hearthstone.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have been lethal and the way that it is programmed in order for it to give a card like gift of the wild or bloodlust is if it gives you lethal
---
Mark, the Natures Chosen
---
He has extremely strong "I just got into grad school and want to unleash my smug condescension on people online" vibes. AKA the worst kind of scientist to work for/with.
---
The angle is brilliant. Well done.
---
Back to the office!
---
Look at this.  Look at your other posts.  Look at how many words you've written about something so harmless/silly.  Think about all the other useful things you could have been doing instead of writing all these words.
---
Thread full of puns and no one thought of "Mark of chain"?
---
Na, I think Kazakus is more likely. Og reno is way too busted as a neutral legendary.
---
Fake post for free karma.
---
It literally says 'wanna challenge for 80g' but in Greek letters, like English but in greek alphabet. Not even greek.
---
Yes
---
gift of the wild is one of the new classic cards from a couple months ago
---
It regularly offers power of the wild without it being lethal tho
---
You're tearing me apart Lisa!
---
Will you buy me 80 packs?
---
His health is lower so thats why siphon was offered as well.
---
I guess I haven‚Äôt played with zephyrus enough then but I have only had it give me power of wild when I had lethal with it, or maybe I just haven‚Äôt been paying attention enough and when I play it on 10 there‚Äôs usually a better option
---
It's just THAT good.
---
I post this every few months. I obviously think yes, and I usually get shouted down.
---
You are probably right, but the fun though :-p
---
Honestly between savage roars, windfurys, tiryon, board clears, Z helped a ton!!
---
That's like 10 whole golden legendaries
---
Aka playing as Elise with the jr and the moonfire hero power. Playing jr and the staff to get her immune. And spamming the boss and the jr with moonfires till you win/run out of battery
---
My biggest issue with this kind of player exaggeration is that it hurts the cause of trying to get Blizzard to listen to the community. I see this a lot in all of those "The game costs $200 per expansion!" threads. Exaggerating a complaint doesn't magnify the complaint; it diminishes it and, by association, all valid complaints that are trying to make similar points (e.g., that the game is too expensive for a lot of players).
---
How about we just unnerf it in the Wild casual room? That way people don't need to be anxious about losing stars to it.
---
you should put in a sandbinder to draw zephyrs, you effectively get him twice as often with that. The highest wr reno warrior has that on hsreplay.
---
Mark here, hi!
---
So, you got Pogo deck from Bob?
---

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLEvtMpO3aw  Show match against Roger in 2017, at 22:20 he plays a unactivated raza poking fun at roger misplaying earlier in the weekend.
---
I personally don't dust any Legendaries, but Nozari seems like a safe one to disenchant if you're in a bind for some dust. Also depending on who you talk to, some people still find it worth the risk to disenchant. It's all up to the person.
---
It‚Äôs still a no for me. Yogg as a bail out isn‚Äôt good for competitive play
---
Good point, can draw Siamat too if I already drew Z!
---
Pretty much, plus the upgraded pack mule so I can spam all 4 turn 1
---
I love that. In the face of disagreement and contrary explainations blindly shout your opinion over and over and over again until you get what you want.
---
Damn, thats a really nasty play! Well done haha
---
From my experience finley + lance + overload hero power works well against him, his damagae is high but stable there are no sudden spikes in damage so you can heal, also as somevody mentioned reno with secret package and secret synergy starting treasure works great.
---
Tournament mode is so overrated. It's gonna be like brawliseum 2.0. Stop bitching and enjoy the game for at least a day. We have some new events coming and you're here whining about tournament mode. Stfu
---
Issue is I have like just a few GvG cards and I like completing sets, opening packs is more fun but again, I‚Äôll just accept my fate.
---
Does the .... switch phase happen again when you pass the trigger points again?

Implying thighs and butts aren't serious.
---
I've played purely on my phone for three and a half years. There aren't really any features you miss out on.
---
I didn't one shot him but I was incredibly lucky on my second attempt with Elise. I got him from 262 to 0, with a bizarre combination of Elixer of Vim, cloak of invisibility, Jade Idol (Discovered from Raven Idol), Addarah, stone fox statue (2 copies with shadow visions used both on Addarah), Kel'thuzaad (who survived a surprisingly long time before he used plague of death) and Gnombliterator. Then even more luck when the tomb on the board gave me Rin the First Disciple and I managed to use Azzari shortly after he entered phase 3.
---
Took me until Bob gave me a deck of just Pogos and was able to just keep going face and knock off the last 225 health I needed.
---
Funny enough I never played wild always played standard or tried one of the single player modes, though I liked the tavern battles
---
The hell else is reporting gonna do? And a "timeout" isnt much better. Theres literally nothing forcing you into playing the game against that opponent, no leave penalty like other games besides losing ofc, just concede and move on, not stick around and make a complain post on reddit
---
Nice quotes but he didn't say "missing out".  He said "missing a lot of stuff".
---
Should have ate the first one.
---
That's what I'm asking.  Do cards like Mogor the Ogre give Rush minions a chance to hit face?
---
After a few turns it already tells you your opponent left and you insta win?
---
yes, that is basically like drawing patches. Only bad players do it.
---
I don‚Äôt think this player left though I had a similar thing. They played a card killed my minion and let the rope end, they did this several turns in a row. I imagine just to be rude.
---
Completed
---
Your deck better be good if you plan to beat a 499 HP plague lord in a single game.
---
Good question. I dunno really but I think so, because the ‚Äúwrong enemy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt consider the taunt limitation, so I guess going face is a viable option in this particular case.
---
Yes... It is.
---
Its blue.
---
Probably using reddit.
---
I agree that it‚Äôs annoying but they will probably never do something about it because finding a good solution is near impossible.
---
pretty sure it's a draw, resetting the fight at 300 health for the boss.
---
Double battlecry:
---
destroy a 10/10. 
---
you gain 20 + 20 = 40. 
---
Barrista. gain 2 crabs. 
---
Crab 2 : Gain 80 + 80 = 160. 
---
Crab 3: Gain 320 + 320 = 640
---
I feel dumb.
---
That's gonna leave a mark
---
That being said, I'd like to add that in both of those play style, I think Standard require more skills and concentration to win cause usually, both players knows what they are up against meaning strategy and mindtrick are more incline to make you the winnner than the deck itself.  In the end, its still a card game relying heavily on RNG and luck (bad mulligan, bad draw, low roll, ect).
---
Oh, didn't know that. Still, I crafted Deathwing back in the day, so it might be something to consider:)
---
This will be great! It's even better than the amazing card Core Hound!
---
Agreed, anything against roping is a good thing.
---
Take my upvote.
---
I mean, why are you hurting yourself ?
---
Make sure you eat enough vegetables on a daily basis and sometimes go for a walk.
---
Are we even playing the same game?
---
Can you make another post but in the new reddit site?
---
That‚Äôs some interesting feedback. Is it just other control decks that outvalue it or is there bigger/other problems?
---
Make another then
---
I played Nozari when boss was at like 40, then lost miserably. When I faced it again, it was at 40 rather than 100, so I guess it counts the minimum health it ever was on during the fight
---
It really depends on your matchups. Going with the best decks in the meta like sn1p-snap warlock or secret mage is a great way to make a final climb due to the power level of these decks. If you are looking for a fast climb then go with secret mage. If you notice you are playing a lot of decks that are trying to counter you then switch it to an odd rouge. If you go on a losing streak don‚Äôt give up! Keep on pushing you‚Äôll eventually find your win streak!
---
Because when you only release a handful of UI features in the entire games life, it would look pretty incompetent to be flip flopping on this one thing.
---
It doesnt work like that, the same way it doesnt work with alextraza. One thing is taking damage/being dealt damage, the other is having your hp be set up to a certain number. Alextraza or tekal dont activate warlock spellstone, for example. And they wont activate nethersoul buster either. Something similar happens with bloodbloom too, since you are paying health, not receiving damage. 
---
Anyway, a 29/5 turn 6 would be interesting indeed. Warlock can put up better boards by that turn though (cough *snip* cough *snap*)
---
Please don't pressure the small indie company into doing unnecessary work they might go bankrupt.
---
Hi
---
This is why that new Atelier game is doing so well, right?
---
Well it‚Äôs free so why not
---
I'm talking about Dalaran Heist, Tombs of Terror, and "o shit Lazul was summoning N'Zoth this whole time" not the old ones.
---
They will probably decide to put it again 6 months before they decide to phase out adventures again or something
---
yep next turn! and then beat 200 health heroic plague lord madness afterward
---
I want galavadon back in standard just so we could hear kiblers song on his stream again
---
The hero powers are not very well balanced.
---
Finley Power Up is absurd. The Divine Shield and Windfury are worth a hero power itself, as you can you see in Dalaran Heist Jorge 'divine shield' hero power.
---
Then you combine the two for the same 2 cost? Too OP....
---
Other hero powers are more balanced, and I think they made a good work to make them fun. I hope they continue this trend.
---
Crowdsourcing is a thing. And it's extremely powerful.
---
But hey, good thing I won't accidentally use one of my wild decks in standard! I might even accidentally convert it :)
---
My favourite is when you speak out against massively oversexualised art/characters and you get called a prude.
---
I think with benedictus it just goes to the turn limit
---
I too would like 80 gold.
---
That's the point, they have no money, they are an inexperient indie company. I mean, they don't have an amount of consumers to base off their decisions

I'd like to get off Mr Bones Wild ride

Pay it what?
---
same thing for the heroes shop , like whats the points of it anymore ?
---
Hah, kudos on that deck name.
---
Obviously the one who has no trouble is the one doing it wrong.
---
I hear you, but this sounds fine. Now that word is spreading, it will actually make it interesting to see if people pick Thekal more for this very reason. If they do, I'm sure Blizz is fine with that. If you are trying too hard for it, you are probably having to go down in quality of buckets just to pick something with a very small change of triggering.
---
Also if you do it later, it saves at the lowest point
---
"There is effectively no way to play around it because it is the ultimate counter to anything."
---
You can try to Dirty Rat, Deathlord, Hecklebot or mill Zephrys.
---
Too expensive to come back.
---
If you don't want to spend money, sorry but if you abandoned, there is no comming back.

I nuked him from 300&gt;0 with a Reno the recruiter deck. Crook and cane summoned a y‚Äôshar with rush turn 1 and a murloc tiny fin and I knew tiny fin would take me all the way
---
Focus on beating all the classes in training first to unlock everything, the very basic cards you will have unlocked are not viable as a complete deck when you start playing against actual people, except at the very beginning when you will be matched with people similar to you. If you want to build competitive decks, prepare for a long grind.

tip of the ice bark.....

You can download apps that display a deck tracker overlay on the screen.
---
Agreed, I probably wouldn't play it anymore if I already had all the meta decks completed.

Idk what you're talking about with tournament mode but you can switch the region for your account it'll be just like you made a new account. i.e none of the cards/card backs  you currently have.

I never said that it does? No one ever said anything about anyone being a racist. What the hell are you on about?
---
I also never said he can't be annoyed by something. Not sure where you got that idea from.
---
Oh thank you
---
Sure did.  Went super conservative with the PW: Shields beforehand, though!
---
Edit: Also got super lucky I was able to recruit out the Bloodmage Thalnos to reduce the spell-casting effectively by half.
