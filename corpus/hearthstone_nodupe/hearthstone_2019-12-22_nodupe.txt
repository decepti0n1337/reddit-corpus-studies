Beast is trash after like 2 turns. I think all it does in tier 3 is reducing your chances of getting something really good
---
---
---
Wait until April.....of 2025.
---
Seems like ipads especially are having this issue
---
So you want your greedy, busted deck with a ton of mid-late game power to also be good against aggro? A deck like that will be hated and your class will be gutted due to cries of nerf from reddit and you won't have a viable mage deck again until several expansions later.
---
Yep I just realized hahahaha
---
Deryl still not in the best of positions?
---

---
Has been the best hero available since launch...
---
I never said you said it was a good alternative. I said you said it was an alternative. Which you just did again. My point was that there is a stage at which being technically correct isn't good enough. If I tell you to buy an egg and you buy five, technically you have bought an egg, you've just bought four more too. You are technically correct, but no one is going to be very impressed with you.
---
In the same way, saying that SP is an alternative to Shudderwock is technically correct, but I belive you know it's not what the definition was referring to. Definitions are designed to be clear and consise, and hanging on this kind of technicality is definitely not clear.
---
I made a [post a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ed3fs6/ipad_keeps_crashing_and_not_reconnecting_started/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about this.  My post has a link in it to a thread on the blizzard support forums that someone made about the same issue.  If everyone complains there it will probably get more attention than a bunch of separate Reddit posts.
---
Same, except when playing battlegeounds...  come on blizzard, that latest stability patch made things waaaay worse
---
If you think this, you're probably playing the card wrong. There's more to Time Out than that
---
I rope all the tier1 deck players in Casual. It is dirty work but somebody needs to deliver justice.
---
I don't really care about your tier list assessment, especially since you offered no constructive advice, rather you just trashed it. 
---
The deck works well for me, and while I am aware it is not the strongest version of Reno Mage, I said I enjoyed playing it, not that it was tier 1. 
---
I have 4 versions of Reno Mage built, and they are all crafted fully golden. I have the "Best" versions of Reno Mage according to tier lists. Additionally I have 3 golden reno-lock decks, and 4 Golden reno-priests. I am well aware of how to build a proper Reno deck. 
---
Now if you want to offer criticism that is actually constructive, I'm all ears, and I am happy to debate.
---
I'll let you have your lethal, but you're playing BM cards when you had lethal in hand, I'm out. I don't have time to sit there while you jerk off.
---
Hm, I just came to say, I disagree.
---
That is all.
---
What’s clear to me is my definition of powercreep. I find yours to be unclear because yours is using things that are unmentioned in the original definition of the ~~card.~~ word.
---
I think I like what Kripp says about the rng, is that everytime you choose the best option given at the first instance and aim for top 4 instead of winning. You don't get the perfect team all the time and this instance is one of them.

---
I'm sorry, you'll have to clarify, the definition of which card?
---
I'm fairly new to wild, but so far only lost to that taunt warrior deck
---
Sorry, meant to say ‘word.’ My mistake.
---
Nah, gotta get that full charge
---
"Are you SMORCing me??"
---
I have less of an issue with the actual time and much more of an issue with the fact that whatever the time is, it’s not equal among players.
---
If we want to say hey this is a game of quick wits and speed and 30 seconds is what you get, fine.
---
But don’t give my opponent 70 seconds and I get 30 just because I had to sit threw a bunch of animations and they didn’t.
---
If I have lethal I play as much of my hand (or only big stuff) just to show what I did have in hand. Especially if they were playing around cards in hand
---
Not really. There's more room for armchair speculations to be right over one result because one result only proves that it's possible for demon decks to win games, whereas armchair speculations makes a good argument that demon decks can't be good (an argument you haven't even addressed). How do demons compete with mechs with their divine shields or beasts with their massive stat value?
---
So you use them to prevent a lot of damage. Obviously you want to maximize your mana and be efficient, but the idea that you need to board clear or win after a time out isn't some big brain play. If anything the skill in the card comes more from predicting when the opponent is going to try and burst you down more than being aware that you need to clear a board.
---
This has me thinking about an opposite card to plate breaker. What about another warrior dragon like a 6 mana 2/3 that “recover all armor you’ve lost so far this game”. Don’t know how that’ll work though
---
This is why I don't play wild
---
Stop. Nobody cares how clever you are. Kill me so I can go again.
---
If you don’t play Mage I think you should do it.
---
Kronx, easy.
---
Ah yes, competent opponents get to choose whether to hit the homunculus or the voidlord, my bad! Can truly skilled opponents hit the soul juggler and then the malganis?
---
As cool as that sounds maybe not put it in warrior. Maybe it could be something like “regain the highest amount of armor you’ve lost this game”. That’s a bit wordy but if warriors can just hero power and armor cards until they’ve lost 100 or more armor and then bam! New line cracker Druid but in wild you can play 2 in the same turn. Awesome idea though, super interesting concept.
---
I would also consider /r/hearthstone worse than many other games' primary subreddit, including LoL, Overwatch, Starcraft, WoW, and Rocket League.
---
r/fuckpriest
---
For Reference:  
---
I had on curve upgraded Warrior Hero power against face hunter.   
---
I did end up winning but he put me to 1 with 10 burst damage. I healed for 16 and he cleared his board. He couldn't find the damage to win
---
Praising this sub

Whining about being banned three times

Is that a red flag? Seems crimson.

Definitely. Especially the old miracle rogue with shadowsteps. Play the Leeroy without shadowstep and they still conceded half the time.

 (the following was posted on the blizzard support forum by customer support)
---
Thanks for your reports, everyone! We’re aware of the crashing issues with iPad/iOS devices. I wanted to break this down a bit more on what we know is happening with iPad devices.
---
There are two separate issues causing the iPad device issues.
---
1. Devices with less than 2GB of RAM may experience frequent crashes. This will impact iPad Mini/iPad Airs mostly. There’s also been reports of this with iPhone 6 devices.  
---
*Note: This may potentially be impacting iPad 6th &amp; 7th Gen with 2GB or more memory.*
---
2. iPad Pros are crashing when matching into a ranked game.
---
Our team is aware of both issues, and hopefully working on a quick resolution. We’ll provide updates and information as more becomes available.
---
Sure, as long as you have Shudderwock.
---
I think he's pretty cute :3
---
It'd be funny if when Leeroy is played with lethal he screams, "LEEEEETHAAAAAAL!"
---
perhaps zapp has the priority order of 
---
lowest attack
---
no divine shield
---
taunt
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
that way his attack would get re-routed as voidord gains taunt to the next minion with the same attack and no divine shield
---
I remember when murloc hunter was sort of a thing wayyy long ago.  Fun times, and pretty hilarious when it actually worked out.
---
I would keep it fo shore.
---
Yes, because it's Golden.
---
Reno Jackson is why I don't play wild.
---
I've been struggling with quest Hunter at rank 5.  Shamans seem to be better against it now and face Hunter generally wins against it but it's close.  I think I have to put in more taunt or healing other than zilliax
---
It looks like they [know about us now. ](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/dec2019-main-thread-for-ipad-crashes-after-latest-patch/21019/38) .

---

---
You're remembering all the bad things but forgetting the times things didn't kill the important guy on the right.
---
is there a tier list for decks after the nerfs?
---
It should just be Unstable Ghoul since it takes away your own divine shields making it a lot fairer.
---
So you played it turn 2 and he pinged you every turn till turn seven? So he spent at least 12 mana to stop you from getting a 3/6. He definitely did the wrong thing.
---
Get gud?
---
Wow and he still had more bombs left.
---
And the solution is to fix those problems when they happen (or, even better, not let them happen) not destroy the mechanic completely.
---
I was wondering if it was just my client haha
---
cheers bud
---
True! I’d love mechathun to have one last bang
---
 Can you explain
---
For the challenge, at least.
---
Try jepetto maly Hunter.

2x arcane shot

2x rapid fire

1x Alexstrasza
---
1x Malygos
---
1x Jeppetto

---
Oof. You right.
---
This,had a murlock shaman get me down to 3 hp before I stabalized. Let him too deck for a while to see if he could did for reach. I miss murlock shaman and and wanted to give him hope.
---
Baron geddons effect stacks like that? I figured it would combo with itself, kinda like brann...
---
Neither, zephrys
---
It’s a lot different. More people trying hard at rank 3+. Rank 5 you can hit with a negative win rate due to win streak bonus stars. With a 55% win rate you need 250 games till legend from rank 5.
---
Uh... TFT? Battlegrounds?
---
Summon linecracker then cast Beees!! on it, it will trigger the overkill for each the bee token,  then casts earthen scales on it, gaing armor per attack point
---
Linecracker doubles it's attack whenever it overkills (deals more damage than necessary), and Bees summons 4 1/1's to attack it. This triggers the doubling each time, and since it has 10 hp, you can cast Bees on it twice even.
---
Then, Earthen Scales gives +1/+1 and armour equal to the minion's attack
---
You can Bees your own minions?!
---
I got the 1k paladin class too but i still play with Liadrin like her too much
---
Could just be to hide the player’s name since the post would break a rule if it didn’t hide his opponents name
---
I don’t like it when it rains.
---
How ??
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know, I haven’t played long enough to know all this stuff
---
I just have you an example of a dragon deck.
---
"our"
---
So, you want dragons and their support to exist in their own cornered-off decks rather than as part of other decks like they have been played for the past three years roughly?
---
Its nice but it's just a handlock deck with a couple of dragons not a deck based on dragons that we used to have
---
I’m having fun with it at rank 8
---
Arcane Tracker is open source and has Battlegrounds support.
---
It has 7-10 dragons, depending on the list. Including 5 cards that are of dragon synergy. That’s half the deck.
---
Just say your younger sibling drew this and farm karma. 
---
Sincerely though: it looks fantastic.
---
I was coming to say zoolock.....
---
But maybe that’s just because I’m playing a more discounted type of zoolock
---
Well, its good that people can make some tricks in this game
---
You payed for this 80 bucks hehe
---
I’m glad your post is getting traction. I posted about this the day of the update and it didn’t get far. There are some serious stability issues at least on iPad that need to be investigated. I crash at the start of games when I first go to play a card, at post-game screens, and intermittently during matches.
---
All he needs is your coina
---
Not sure what you mean by that. I have the new iPad mini 5 and have had zero issues previously. the stability issues are definitely with the hearthstone app and the latest patch, not the age of the platform.
---
I am amazed that your playing odd paladin.
---
...isnt that the same as stream sniping?
---
Are we sure this isn't Battlegrounds mode?
---
I usually don’t emote besides greetings at the very beginning sometimes and BM-ing if my opponent does it first
---
deck code?
---
thats the big oof
---
his weapon was insane tho
---
Clam bees are easily the worst ones.
---
The win condition
---
hunter is the best class right now and they weren’t one of the galakrond classes
---
no shit, they're everywhere in the ladder atm... sheeps. /QQ.
---
I can see your anger, but Face Hunter is just an amazing deck for f2p players. If players want to play a good deck that is very cheap, they almost have no other chance than playing this deck. 
---
IksarHS, Game Designer announced they think about a new nerf if needed early January, so a chance is there for an upcoming nerf (even tho most talked before the announced nerfs about Deathrattle Hunter, not Face Hunter).
---
https://twitter.com/IksarHS/status/1207434490869616640
---
Maybe try what it was like? Was the card making human like voice? Remember anything?
---
Same goes to Hunter when I play heal
---
Now here's 5 different one star minions at level 4.
---
Why are you still playing this deck. People wanna have fun
---
Secret Mage is slightly better, but Reno comes close. So if you enjoy a fast deck - play Secret, if you enjoy a slow one - play Reno. Pretty good spot for Mage players in Wild right now.
---
I agree with OP’opinion. The classic opinion: “it’s aggro, you can tech against it” is not true. I have put in my deck ziliax, kharthut, ice barrier, I have zephrys and I still lose, because even if I have taunt and health regeneration due to board minion, face hunter completely ignores them. How can you counter direct damage to the face? There’s no way apart from direct healing, that most of the classes have not.
---
About 50/50.
---
There are different versions of Galakrond Warrior, but OP seems to be referring to an aggressive one. This is a list that got played Top 100 Legend.

---
First point: Why are you playing Rat Trap in Face Hunter? It's a slow card and shouldn't be in that deck.
---
Second point: I'm pretty sure nobody else has reported any bug with it. Are your opponents definitely playing that number of cards per turn, not just summoning lots of minions from a single cards There aren't really that many decks at the moment, other than mage, that play that many cards in one turn.
---
Nerfs to Hunter and Rogue might happen next month, but we didn't get any details.
---
Face Hunter looks pretty cheap though, can you craft that?
---
Probably because the damage varies conditionally and its near-useless against 5/9 classes
---
You like aggro more, but you wanna play armored goon?
---
Honestly, Town Crier is insanely good and goes into all archetypes of warrior. The pirate literally has the same stats, but gives you a less valuable card.
---
It might be a fine replacement to save 800 Dust however.
---
The Goon I wouldn't recommend however, he's too slow and situational.
---
I have one account where I do have face hunter, but I like highlander mage and it is not really about climbing it is about having fun, and i eon't have fun when I lose three times in a row on turn 6. And I hate playing face hunter, it is just boring
---
Sometimes people get quests to do stuff during the game. Draw more cards/play more minions/deal more damage to face. If you are sure that you are dead and don’t want to waste these precious seconds of your life, the concede button is always there for you.
---
The sad state of this community though. By just reading the comments Zephyr's battlecry should be: "When this card is played, you win the game". 
---
And btw, Zephyr has given my opponent Mass dispel numerous of time when having multiple taunt/reborn minions on the field as Quest reserruct priest.
---
I feel bad for the fecker
---
Thanks so much for the input! Yeah I like the idea of having innate armor gain while being aggressive so I don't lose the smorc race basically. But if you say it's too slow I'll take your word for it, my experience with warrior is limited at best. I wonder if a pirate Galakrond archetype would ever be viable?
---
YoTimbo#2473 looking to trade 80g on EU. Can show but you have to go first as I've been scammed before :(
---
Casual is probably filled with face Hunters too, but it might be worth a try
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
That is a good idea! Thank you!
---
I am currently rank 2 with quest reserruct priest. Got some tips to push Legend?
---
Malygos Warlock is great against face hunter. Alot of healing and big minions which kill them, as face hunter doesn't interact with board much. Altho I hate misdirection as a secret literally lost some games cuz of it.
---
no, permafreeze and level, then get three 20/20 rats and a highrolled mama bear-&gt; easy win
---
Well im like 100% sure that the adventure will bring **heavily dragon synergestic cards.**
---
So my guesses will be dragon druid, dragon hand buff paladin and dragon mage.
---
He's like the tool that's in everybody's garage.
---
i don't have dust :/
---
There was a custom warrior card called Reno Armorisbackson
---
Take mine aswell,you'll definitely need it
---
I see hs has gone down the same way of WoW with the absurd numbers.
---
For those that don't know, It's easier to dance at lower levels because you have fewer minions from the store, so you can more easily predict which minions will get the buffs. 
---
Although leveling to 2 is considered much better than staying on 1.
---
Patience is a virtue.
---
Why embiggen tho ? Isnt it that 0 cost card that gives +2/+2 ?
---
Farsight and mana tide totem because shaman shouldn't acces to card draws
---
Please just play another aggro deck,secret mage is already giving me nightmares,Don't sell your soul man
---
True. But he's not too hard to account for or play around or get rid off. I think that's why they didn't nerf him.
---
For a card that would be rotating eventually, I think nerfs should be considered before HoFing.
---
Of course, you can't nerf some effects satisfactorily or cleanly enough, like Baku or Genn. Those merit HoF.
---
Yes! #metoo
---
That will probably be the case yes.
---
Well descent literally means going down so it’s technically correct if they are low tier decks at best
---
Leeroy
---
To be fair Faceless Rager is somewhat decent but it's not the right meta for it
---
Expect this beautiful art on custom cards in a near future. :D
---
Dude Priest is trash right now what are you talking about
---
Huh Bob only says "..." to me
---
So far I've been keeping them and they usually do something, might do 1-1. Siamat is such a beast in this deck. It's pretty gross if you draw him with Galakrond and have a Spirit of the Rhino, just slapping those big minions like it's nothing.
---
I didn't put in Voone, though I have him, so maybe it's something to consider. Think I'll swap him in for 1 of the Breeders maybe.
---
Also, in one of the other threads, you were discussing the Tastyfin, but I actually like him a lot. 3 5/4's pressure a lot more than 3/2's. Even if you don't have a Scion, your opponent doesn't know that, and it's still a 2/2 to put down on turn 2, where the other 2 drops are usually synergy cards that you don't put out that early.
---
Did you try ya know... teching against them instead of netdecking and being just as annoying as them?
---
👌
---
Just wait till the first decks that counter face hunter will become more popular. I give it maybe 2 weeks. Then your deck will be good again
---
subbing luna in your secret mage deck is not the same as subbing her in your highlander mage deck.
---
It doesn't, actually. You're a control/greedy warrior playing against a deck who's entire purpose is to counter you.  
---
Imagine if we nerfed aggro's bad match ups for example. Just because they were good against aggro.
---
1. Yes lots of people have and theres been many posts about it 2. Visuals are one of the top reasons hearthstone is so popular, so of course they will show it, computers calculate the battle instantly which is why you can see the outcome right away
---
So same decks as previous expansion just spiced up with 1 new card.. wowzie. Buff galakrond pls blizz
---
Once I was playing Cthun Warrior, and had 40 odd armour. Quest mage couldn't fireball me in time cuz they had to play a few more cards to pull the combo off, that was so fking satisfying.
---
Whenever I usually make a meta counter deck the only decks I face are not meta and somehow counter my own
---
You can use it.  
---
Reasons its not being ran:   
---
Costs a lot of mana  
---
Gets blocked by taunts.
---
Wow, what a well thought out reply! Problem with pure pirates is I don't have Ancharr and I have 0 intention of crafting it. I'll definitely give the Galakrond version a shot though!
---
That’s just my wishlist. Yeah they won’t get rid of Mountain Giant anytime soon, but still.
---
Mech hunters other matchups are to weak to be popular in wild, people are messing with odd and even hunter right now
---
Ok boomer.
---
Yeah that’s when they’re being the major douche
---
Yes, happening to me only after the last update. It was fine before.
---
Its real

I fucking hate Sylvanas Windrunner. I know what you’re thinking, this is some kind of funny joke, but no. Sylvanas Windrunner is a piece of shit. A damn elf got resurrected over actual heroes in Silvermoon City and she’s supposed to be a hero? And I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realize Sylvanas Windrunner is already parked there on her stupid little fucking wyvern. She took my husband and the kids and my tent and my job. I swear to fucking god, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn traitor to hell with me. Sylvanas Windrunner has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable banshee in the street, and asked her for her autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking corpse gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the corpsefucker didn't write her autograph, no, she wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your dad”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the pointy-eared devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Sylvanas. All the orcs you’ve wronged will rise against you.

Just anything that offers some incentive in-game to discuss things without going through the effort of continuing 1 on 1 conversations from reddit or any other 3rd party.

Often I boot the client and sit staring at the main menu, whereas Heroes of the Storm has those few premade chat channels and custom ones, in Hearthstone I sometimes feel a void when not playing. I would not want just any public chatroom. Seeing as Blizzard made the basis of group chats in their Battle Net client, I am a little hopeful that these functionalities could be shared within the game.

Depends on what you're interested in on the viable-meme spectrum.

Juuuuuust maybe [[Tinkmaster Overspark]] would be a tech card you'd appreciate, 3 mana and probably no other minions on the board, this would seriously halt the rogue player in their tracks.

oh yes I was playing arena before, that was it! thank you
---
Me go face
---
I now just notified this
---
This doesn’t make much sense. The meta is being dictated by aggro right now, so wouldn’t hunter be part of the meta?
---
Taunts help a little, some removal is nice, but most of their damage is spells and hero power by a long shot, so if you just heal a couple of points of health you're golden.
---
Alternatively, build a board and smack em. They run almost no defense. Just beware of Unleash. 
---
Be careful not to get dragged to a stage where they can heropower you down.
---
Well it’s accurate, sooo that’s a good thing?
---
is secret mage gone in wild?
---
We lost Rag and Sylvanas for what? Brightwing and Whitemane. 
---
Lost Azure Drake and get what? I dont even know what we got. None of the card they print for classic does anything. Do you want to fill the classic set with trash?
---
Malygos, Alex, Mountain giant are the last strong minions left in the classic. I dont think leaving no good minions in classic set is a good idea at all.
---
my highest win streak is 15 as AFK. Is that good?
---
Ah but as the one who said “iPad Air” instead of “iPad Air 3” refusing to make a distinction between these models, it is indeed you who does not know what you are talking about. Perhaps the issue lies with optimization. Try messing around with the settings. On most phones the app works fine but the game gives some trouble to some computers or laptops. Blizzard probably has different versions of the game that run better on different devices. Perhaps the version for iPads is the same as ones for computers leading to issues. Messing with the settings may help, but playing on other devices will be a safer bet. Keep in mind the model of your device when you ask for help. Thanks.
---
Oh good idea
---
As long as you’re not spamming emotes the whole game, they aren’t bm. Occasionally you’ll come across the guy who colorfully disagrees with this philosophy in a longwinded rant about what a failure of a human being you are for saying “well played”. I find it’s best to ignore these people.
---
Hey, zzeraku isn't bad
---
HSReplay reports: Shaman sits at the 7th place of the meta, with 48.2% average winrate through the ranks.
---
# ad funny how u only have 15 karma nice try blizzard nobody buying packs
---
I said my device is less than a year old. Seems like you’re the one who had no idea theyve made newer versions. Bottomline is theres no excuse for the game not working on a brand new device. Its not just me. theres tons of posts in the last few days from people having the exact same problem.
---
Afraid not laddy
---
you just got a pack thats worth my entire collection
---
Taverns of time? You mean tombs of terror?
---
Rogue is quite ass with dealing with big boards, so pirate warrior is awful with that, and face hunter will kill you by turn 7 or 8 unless they get unlucky.The best rogue deck right now would be deathrattle rogue, but is very dependent on what draws you get.
---
Well my concern is the next sets will either be dissapointing or have to keep up the power creep
---
Does he look like a bitch?
---
That’s a weird shaman hero you got, and why run Scargill in this meta?
---
I demand a refund
---
DOD is most likely your best bet, though for every 10 packs of a expansion you've opened, is a gaurenteed [legendary.You](https://legendary.You) can try the cheap face hunter that's only 1600 dust posted on competitivehs a few days ago only with 2 toxic reinforcements.
---
Yeah, I don't play HS anymore but many control decks that are just solely based on removing enemy stuff are probably the easiest decks to play at high level. Aggro is very often very easy, but there are matchups and situations where the line between winning and losing is very thin.
---
Adding more tribes will further polarize the luck aspect. They need some cross tribe support.
---
You're too late! His return is nigh! 😁👍
---
If you are talking about waxadred, I agree it's pretty bad but right now deathwing is thrown in mostly all galakrond warrior decks and some control decks, def not bad or usleess
---
Don't forget to tip your Tauren!
---
Maybe :)

It was fun to paint, but I want to focus more on improving my Splash Art pieces!

Hey there, just noticed this thread and thought it might apply to my stream. I am usually pretty high on the legend ladder and I started streaming again lately. I also have streamed a little Battlegrounds and might give Legends of Runeterra a go once that comes out, but for now I'm focused primarily on Hearthstone ladder. I am all about the gameplay, i don't like silly drama or gimmicks, just deckbuilding around whatever the meta might be on any given day. I will say that i like to throw a little flavor in my decks sometimes to make them more fun, but at the end of the day I am still trying to play the best that I can.
---
I try to stream on most weekdays when I can, and of course I welcome new viewers! The stream is about as small as it can be right now but would love to expand it and hopefully both me and my viewers can become better players from it.
---
Cya in the tavern!
---
I get that a lot of players love winning (including myself) and having a high win rate gets them more endorphine and more happiness. But why would you then not just stick to ranked? You already have a strong even the strongest deck. Your win chances are already higher. Plus, with ranking up you get an even higher sense of "achievement".
---
Oh well, terrible people also exist in hearthstone so what did i honestly expect.
---
Any Control Warrior decklists?
---

Jokes make fun of the reality of a situation. If it’s not true in any sense it’s usually not funny in any sense
---
Thank you
---
i think the most notable gnoll is [[Hogger]], which admittedly doesn't set the standards for gnolls very high
---
As Shaman? Do you play Witch's Brew now, that seems to be the anti-aggro tech choice many Shamans are going with after the nerfs. I've also seen a lot of Walking Fountains too, but that comes down kind of late
---
Some say it’s probably just a bug, but I say ... *puts on tinfoil hat* ... this a leak of something yet to come. Platinum cards coming soon? Alternate art shenanigans leaking in somehow and those are given silver borders? Hmmmmm....

6/4/4 | At the end of your turn, summon a 2/2 Gnoll with Taunt.  
---
Or.. platinum? I'd opt in for woodcarving themed dragons.

Funny story, i had been slogging along on it for quite a while, not making a lot of progress, when my mentor asked me what the chances were that I would finish the piece within a week were. Having a deadline, so to speak. And with that ‘challenge’ in my mind, I was just making a lot more steady progress, so I was able to finish it. I probably spent about two weeks on it, altogether. It is quite slow, but speed comes with time. :)
---
Dork#21828 always happy to be a friend with a random pepole that i never met👍

I could see 1/6 taunt being good against 1 toughness rush and poison stealth against large rush bodies
---
You played 83 hours how much you play?
---
Damn good point, don't know what to get rid of for it tho
---
I’m never quite sure why people use the Velen version of this OTK. The Leeroy version is *much* better &amp; easier to pull off, as demonstrated by Zetalot in the past week and a half or so.  
---
I really think it’s just because many people intuitively don’t even think to include Leeroy in a Priest deck?
---
In World of Warcraft, a creature with a golden dragon around the portrait is Elite. If it has the silver dragon without wings, it’s Rare. If it has the silver dragon *with* wings, it’s a Rare Elite.
---
83 hours is close to what I've put into the mode and I'd say I've played it pretty regularly. The mode hasn't been around for that long. Less than two months including the exclusive preorder beta. That's 1.6 hours a day for me, though closer to 2.4 if you didn't pre-order.
---
Alex actually helped the evil classes more by doubling the highlander payoff. For explorer classes it was a bump but not as much, especially for a weaker highlander card like finley that doesn't mesh with the dragon control deck Alex encourages
---
Hmmmmmmmm.....
---
Possibly the cleaves, I'd also try to sub something like the evasive faywing for something that would benefit more from galakronds battlecry, possibly like leeroy or zilliax since your dragon roars will give you enough to make the Frizz worth it. Zilliax would be able to give you 7 health back and a beefy taunt, while leeroy turns into a cheaper Gromm. The cleaves seem to stand out as just a way to keep board control early but are pretty dead later on.
---
While adding more tribes will expand the card pool substantially, adding tribes also means that there will be fewer people in a match going for the same tribe which means that you as an individual player are more likely to see the good cards from your tribe overall. Making demons viable as a tribe will do the same because people will choose them more frequently than they do now, and without the amalgams in the game, there are really only three tribes that are viable for getting first, being mechs, murlocs, and beasts, which means that most people will usually be gunning for the good cards from those three tribes, meaning it comes down to which of the players going for beasts (for example) gets mama bears and rat packs and which of the players going for murlocs get toxfins and cold light seers, and which of the players going for mechs get the security drones and annoy o modules.
---
face hunter? not really. deathrattle rogue? is that even a legit question? they give one good card to an archtype that previously sucked ass and you question a nerf? kids these days man
---
Highlander rogue is the best rogue deck atm and it doesn’t run Apothecary. rogue is fine
---
just play Healadin 4head
---
oh i was just thinking of the standard control Galakrond. In Op's case i would swap the dragons for the cards I recommended in my other comment
---
How did you not see this lol
---
I totally agree. Good, direct competition only benefits us. I would love to have fun playing both games, though time probably wouldn’t allow for it. 
---
Perhaps the games will run parallel and keep each other honest and innovating.
---
dude really. they give ONE decent card to an archtype that previously sucked ass and you want it removed from the game. stop whining and use tech cards like everyone else
---
[deleted]
---
Wtf is zeperono...
---
So you are saying OP is a big fat phony!
---
All enemy minions lose
---
sometimes i come to this subreddit because of the ridiculous amount of laughable shit people post. quit whining and get good 4head
---
Achievements.
---
New formats other than wild and standard.
---
Tournament mode.
---
Much appreciated
---
I might have thought so too except for the name
---
!!!
---
dungeon run isnt heroic tho?
---
I’ve been doing great with it the sathrovar version you have to know when to use ur clears and when to just face tank it also helps to use one holy wrath for draw if your playing someone with no heal like hunter also it’s important to know what to keep in mulligan obviously card draw but I also like to keep timeouts and shrink rays most of the time it’s really matchup dependent how you play so pay attention to what your opponent has been doing and think about how your going to use your  cards most effectively against their deck like against aggro you want to maximize healing and against control you want to draw draw draw

The effect was so niche that it's rememberable
---
Huge disagree.
---
The hype around an expansion launch is the high point of Hearthstone. Ruining that because you are bad at your job e.g. "make a mistake" is just that - they are bad at playtesting.
---
They made the exact same mistake with not nerfing Boom and Conj Calling.
---
The odds were 1/(number of all minions)
---
Odd paladin braindead deck KEKW
---
Then the hogger but corrupted one
---
I cant unsee this now
---
Ditto
---
Street Investigator OP confirmed.
---
What do you mean. His voiceline is fantastic
---
Click on convert to wild under the portrait above the deck list in the creation screen
---
I do like Handlock a lot, but I'm missing a good bit holding me back unfortunately, but I will prob get the winter veil bundle or something for some dust or to craft a deck like that.
---
Won a match yesterday against a mage who had the exact amount of damage needed to kill me if they went face with their minions and hero power.
---
Instead they lost because they were focused on trying to clear my board because I would have had lethal next turn.
---
I see that card in arena alot
---
Get gyrocopter, then recycling. Draw thru your deck, and keep playing it every turn. It’s a board wipe and it gives u sustain
---
Agreed. This OP is trolling is own post.
---
It doesn't read effects of minions, just their stats and if they have reborn/deathrattle. He will be less willing to give aoe if they have a deathrattle, and I'm pretty sure things like zombie chow will do so as well.
---
I've been doing well against it with my handlock deck. Nether Breath and Abyssal Summoner are key cards, since lifegain and taunt are excellent against face hunter. You just have to be fast to build a board to kill them, because you can't extend the game forever
---
Hm I see the points you are making. I am not a f2p player and never will be. So its a question of money at the end. I mean its not really a Problem, I am not young anymore so I earn enough to support my games. But i also dont like to just throw it away like it is nothing. Are there resources that let me know wich cards are safe to dust, like an xml or a website?
---
OTK paladins have to draw they're whole deck, they literally can't win. Warrior is most likely a aggro matchup
---
Hearthstone has always had terrible devs idk what u expect lol
---
lol i didn't do anything though. i just think there's no reason to be this bitter about the whole thing. this post is far more of a 'hissy fit' than the people talking about hk
---
All the battles are precomputed once the recruitment phase ends. Replaying is just looking up the entry. 
---
This was a glitch with the Client side not realizing you saw what transpired already.
---
I thought more or less the same thing. After some experimentation after the launch, the few people on my friendlist who did not entirely switch to battlegrounds already \*completely\* stopped playing until the nerfs went live. Blizz absolutely shattered the important momentum of the expansion launch with this one. And you can still observe the effect of it even now. If you would not know better, you could think they are trying to kill what enthusiasm is left for this game. For a really longtime fan, it is kind of heart breaking. Maybe I'm wrong, but to me it feels like the era of online card games is coming to an end finally.
---
For me Hunter was the hardest one
