That's hilarious

Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

I think the hall of fame move was simpler than that, Odd and Even decks had been the mainstay for multiple expansions, it felt like the game wasn't changing because every match started the same way. A big part of the standard experience is that the game changes quickly and often, it feels new. Baku and Genn were too powerful and consistent and prevented them from keeping the format fresh.
---
Removing them was good for standard, I just think the move wasn't good for wild.
---
**COMPLETE**
---
&gt; Are we imagining we might play the wrong card because it looks different?
---
Exactly. Hearthstone have too many 'random generation' effects. Specially in single player.
---
Imagine someone watching a tournament and the players generate card with alternate art. The viewer will never know what the hell it is before the player plays it.
---
And by personal experience: I have a friend that already confuse different cards that have the same character, imagine having the same card with different art...
---
Thanks!!  Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better complement :D
---
The sample size of gm is too small to draw any conclusion from it. But I don't think that's the point here, calling someone a worthless insect is distasteful no matter how good they are at the game.
---
If you want to give a 400 dust bonus to legend, why not move it to rank 5 so we don't have to grind to legend?
---
Ah, but you see, I am a Linecracker Druid player, therefore I must oppose it.
---
That aside, however, something like that might work. The only issue I can see is that giving it a cost that'd make it viable would be difficult without also handing it to aggro/burn decks on a silver platter.
---
Getting good amounts of armor(not Linecracker level armor, but regular druid level) is one of the things that beats burn decks like Secret Mage. I really don't want Secret Mages to get a card that lets them cut my health in half in one fell swoop.

well thats jr tomb diver, which is garbage. Senior tomb diver is 3. Pick the secret deck and thin your deck with bob and go for card draw.

Agree to disagree I suppose.  A third of the tavern brawls have one-off cards, 135 or so new cards get released every few months, and with that comes an adventure with tons of new dynamics to understand.  In my mind there are tons of confusing things you have to adapt to in Hearthstone, you get used to them.  Then there's Magic the Gathering and my God, trying to read all that card text, navigate the phases of play, and make intelligent decisions...you want to be confused coming from a Hearthstone player's context, play that.

For me it used to be that, but recently I've had more and more positive people. I always accept adds, and 9/10 in recent years have either been "gg" or "looking for friends". Maybe it's because I mostly play wild, but it seems like people have calmed down since it's early years. 
---
Also I usually play non-meta and non-opressive decks, so that might be a contributing factor as well

She seems really good at first, since she's cheap, has good stats and isn't as awkward to use as Reno's treasure spammer.
---
...Then you factor in the hunter deathrattle cards Brann can get and she's just *insane*. When I did Halls of Origination with Brann, I visited Bob at least 5 times and ended pretty much every fight with a full field and a hand full of random treasures.
---
Maybe because she is a girl, or maybe because so many people defend her. Either way no matter how "mean" something is it is just an opinion. 
---
Speaking for me I use to try to watch her streams for hearthstone education, but have found her chat to be focused on other things.
---
Is this a bad thing? Lol

This was the OG Miracle Rogue finisher.
---
I think it's basically useless without Robes if Gaudiness which isn't in ToT?
---
I mean, "2-cost cards are useless on turn 7" is a wonderful statement, but if your opponent starts with 3 mana and a health advantage, and you got rid of your 0, 1 and 2 cost cards, what are YOU gonna play for the first three turns if all you draw are 5's and 8's?
---
I'm confused...what am I supposed to be seeing here
---
Okay good, so my question isn‚Äôt stupid then!
---
So why is it even in the game?  Is it just a trap card?  And why does it cost two gold?  That‚Äôs your entire first trip to the bazaar unless you got VIP membership.  Just doesn‚Äôt make sense why it would be on par with Work Work or Upgraded Pack Mule, both of which are fantastic cards. 
---
Every other card offered in the bazaar makes perfect sense. I may not be a fan of them, like Tea Time, but I can understand why you would take it. But I‚Äôve never taken Do The Math and I‚Äôm just trying to understand why they would take the time to put it in the game AND make it one of the most expensive cards. Only House Special is more expensive.

---
Silvername is another one. And I do agree that picks like Pavel, Firebat, Strifecro are highly questionable. I do respect those players and their achievements, but you can clearly see that the main goal for Blizzard was to promote a brand with famous people rather than caring about the competitive aspect.

I didn't mind the historic earnings ones so much as at least they proved they were at the top of the game at some point (and their results are showing this, a lot of them are doing pretty well and they don't seem at all out of their depth).
---

---
Oh, of course not. It's just kind of hilarious how easily you can abuse her treasure spam.
---
I did this also but I used dead man's hand + I had the hearthstone treasure card.
---
Ryvius got his grandmaster spot by placing top 3 in HCT points last year, while Pathra got in because Blizzard decided to pick her under the ‚Äòlegend spot‚Äô which doesn‚Äôt really factor in competitive achievements as much. 
---
With Blizzard marketing grandmaster league as ‚Äòthe pinnacle of competitive hearthstone‚Äô, you can‚Äôt blame people for being outraged.
---
You've found the crux of the problem.
---
same shit happens if you discover nightmare amalgam. 
---
theres only one true "ALL"
---
popular tournament decks are combo priest, quest druid variations, control warrior, shirvallah otk paladin, aggro shaman, quest shaman, highlander hunter. Might have missed some
---
What we need is Blizzard making an official statement regarding the selection procedure for GM's, so people don't misplace their anger on Pathra herself. I don't think anyone worth listening to would argue that she's out of her league and Blizzard f-ed up. But this outrage is uncalled for.
---
It's simple. First you play barnes..
---
As a wild player, I dont even know what the meta is. So, I take that as a sign that it is a good meta. Players being quiet mean they are content.
---
You play barnes
---
Every deck is a combo deck. Even Odd Warrior plays mill. There is absolutely no classic control decks, where you have to match up your answers to the questions and out attrition them. It's just slower/defensive broken things. You cannot control infinite combos and the calibre of things in wild. I have played a lot of wild, there's no real control at high ranks.
---
It shows me the end screen.
---
How can there be 3 boots if people have 2 feet?
---
How do you ever play Yogg?
---
Well, that's the problem, isn't it? If someone at the bottom of the barrel is still much better than a 'Grandmaster' from another region, then something went wrong. He being in an apparently similar spot as hers reflects poorly on him. The frustration is understandable. He worked hard for this.
---
TL;DR : Pro tours remove the shield phase from the current GM format. Current format struggles because the 3rd most played class is brought by 41/48 GM, 4th is 28/48, and 5th is 18/48. No one plays Rogue.
---
It‚Äôs actually in 4 hours from this comment!

Surprised I haven‚Äôt seen so much talk about it. I personally find Zephrys super boring to play against. You‚Äôre normally trying to play towards your enemy‚Äôs weakness but then there is just his card...

If you don't like hearthstone then why the fuck are you in the subreddit ?

Replace mind blast with Grave Horror and you're set. You can get a bunch of them on the board for 0 cost and then buff them with PW Shield and then Topsy Turvy them. Most people will just concede...it's really oppresive.
---
To be fair, Ryvius came 2nd on points in the HCT for 2018 (with 150+ and only lost out on last call due to Tyler changing regions. Pathra finished around 900th, with 9 points.
---
dat ankward moment when you realize that 1) true hunter-fixated are on average better players than others 2) control hunters are possible, but you had not the necessary balls. 
---
Anyway, after some moments of shock, fortunately you are ready to substitute reality with your imaginary world -again-.
---
That's not really the point of this article, to be honest.
---
Masters Tour going away from Conquest with Shield was already announced before (it's not news at this point), and class distribution from each week of Grandmasters is available online.
---
Old Guardian tries to analyze the implications of the recent shake-ups in the competitive format, why the Specialist and Shielded Conquest were dropped, how a quickly solved meta impacts tournaments etc.
---
It's niche useful for cheating some win conditions so you can get to a certain card really quick. E.g. Reno's card that replaces your hero power with 'discover a treasure'. Although then you have to be prepared for fatigue, so...
---
What doesn't count? You can literally throw Zephrys in every deck in this brawl unless your plan is to shuffle multiple copies of the same card in your deck.
---
To convince you to start playing something else that isnt p2w and outdated. If you like hearthstone but dont dont have an infinite source of wealth you can play teamfight tactics

I found this interesting, what i was thinking about is a mode where they do the same as in arena. Make specific sets available for each seasons with a rotation every 2 or 3 months ? would be pretty refreshing imo but your idea looks great also ! The thing is by making a third mode they might be affraid to split even more the playerbase?

Kazakus is the card I've had the most fun with but Zephrys is starting to dethrone him.
---
They got in a loop because they had the anomaly that keeps your health consistent between matches - basically both characters started the game with negative health, so it was an endless set of draws.
---
I'm not sure if it got fixed, I haven't seen any follow-ups to it.

It could be cool, but once the excitement of a new mixed format or return to an old Standard format dies down, which would die down after a week, and the best decks are figured out (Assuming its a special format. Old Standard formats would pretty much go right back to where they once were), player numbers in each of them would plummet.
---
At best, such a format should be kept to a semi-regular Tavern Brawl.

This topics have been talked a lot since the creation of MTG and the solution is already known. There are no solutions to the "problem" you complain about. Its not even a "sad" thing (or a problem), its the normal thing to happen. Not everybody can be the best, because by definition we wouldnt be the best then. Same happens for cards and decks. Not all decks cant be the best. If they are all the same then deckbuilding is out of the question and then why play a deckbuilder card game instead of league of legends or overwatch instead?
---
There is still alot of experimentation to be done in wild. Sniplock was low tier deck but trough experimentation it eventually got where it is now. Handbuff paladin didnt got much more new cards and at first was considered a funny meme version of mech hunter, but now it has proven to be very efffective. The meta also switches and although good decks remain good, they can be tier 1 one expansion and tier 2 the other, while new decks rising to tier 1 to suplant them.
---
[Check this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-2002-01-28) done by the lead designer of MTG, a game that basically works the same way as hearthstone, that has been running for 25 years. This guy knows what he is saying and is not the typical streamer that does articles pretending he knows game desing better than 10+ year veterans in the genre (cough cough). Mainly read the first point, called "All the cards cant be good" for an explanation why all cards cant simply be good *IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIROMENT*.
---
To be honest, by the way you talk, you look more like a tymmo/jhonny that wants to be a spyke. You arent. If you enjoy deckbuilding and discovering and expresing yourself, then doing that trough high winrates is going to get you depresed, because its not possible. Its great to think we are going to be the ones that create the new metabreaker etc etc, but there is so many card combinations that make sense and although some decks may go under the radar untill half the expansion (heal zoolock, worgen otk, etc...) this is the rare case and the people that do this are normally profesionals that know a lot about deckbuilding and use data to identify the posibility of a metabreaker deck appearing and how it should work in order to beat the current meta, not something any random player can normally do.
---
Also, wild is better than standard in rewarding creative players. There are a ton more of decks, and a ton more of options to combat them. Its way easier to climb in wild if you know what you are doing since you have way more ways to tech against the meta decks, or simply use a non-conventional deck that happens to beat the common matchups. It may not be meta, but for example quest shaman is now doing a lot of work in the wild ladder. If it actually is that good, the better decks will adapt to it and bring it back down to low tiers, or maybe quest shaman makes a space for himself in the meta top tiers. This deck isnt even in most wild reports but by simply seeing what are the popular decks and what are they weak to, people have a lot more room to create decks able to beat them. So in any case, if you like that sensation, even if it truly cant exist in a pure form, wild is where it would be instead of in standard.
---
Lastly, the "no meta" thing is an utopia and will never happen no matter how hard to fight against it. In MTG early days, with no internet, people still played against each other (thats how the game is suposed to be) and learned that their deck sucked and the opponents had a better deck, so they change decks and eventually, the meta is formed. There is always going to be a strategy thats optimal, or better explained, there is always a combination of cards that simply isnt as strong as others. Therefore some decks will always be weaker than others, and its just a matter of time (and believe me, its a matter of VERY little time) when the top deck is found, and then the process slows dramatically and the meta is stablished, untill new cards come. There will always be a meta. And thats not something bad, thats how the game plays. For non-meta games or suboptimal, never seen strategies, casual exist.
---
For now, dont blame the fact that wild has a meta to "non-willingness of the devs to fix it", because thats pretty lazy of you.
---
It would confuse new players.
---
You haven‚Äôt faced Grave Horror Priest
---
I assume tournament winnings only, it would be impossible to pin down someone's precise streaming earnings from HS and if they did the Grandmasters would be filled with people like Kripp, Savitz, Kibler etc.
---
At 2 mana it's too easy to slot into decks.  Spellbreaker is chosen but needs some consideration.  Also there should be a neutral silence option for even and odd decks in wild.

Nice.

in beta even more,1mana draw a card,combo draw a extra card. edwin had 1/1less but always stealth,defias ringleader was a 2/3 and i think the token was a 2/2 at one point aswell(not sure 2/3 and 2/2 ever where together but if so who thought a 2mana 4/5 you can have turn 1 for going second was a good idea?)
---
Rogue hero power aslo gave 1attack if had weapon equiped. And a card to double weapons attack(for just 3mana)

And warrior had  2mana that removes their armor and give them 1attack for each,

Elise Druid is going to be *stupid* and I can't wait!
---
I've said it in the original post and I'll repeat it here : Those cards make no sense. 
---
You're bringing back :
---
* A really big powerhouse for an already dominant Druid deck (quest).
---
* One of the most hated card in HS history for paladin, along with one of the best secret they've ever had.
---
* A card that single-handedly made aggro mage one of the most oppressive deck (Flamewalker).
---
* A stupidly strong spell for Hunter, to make sure that Zul'Jin and discover effects remain as polarizing as possible.
---
* More priest board clear, when people complain that all priests have are board clears.
---
* Shaku, the useless legendary, for a deck that sees quite literally 0% pro play.
---
* Even more power for Battlecry shaman, through Evolve.
---
* Another strong aggressive minion, in case zoolock was to ever become oppressive again.
---
* Bloodhoof Brave, just to make sure Taunt warrior will forever be painful to deal with.
---
* 4 of the most controversial Legendary cards (only card that doesn't cause ragequit among those 5 is The Curator).
---
They bring back cards that strengthen oppressive decks, don't help with any of the weaker classes' issues, go against the class identities (card generation and taunt for Hunter, for instance), and has historically caused *many* balance issues...
---
Like, what is the goal with that event? That's not how you design a rotating core set... At the very least they should've made it so there were a few neutral cards so that all classes are impacted by more than just 5-6 added legendary minions and 1-2 class cards...
---
I instantly dismissed the leak, because it made no sense from a design point of view, and I think it had those 23 exact cards. I really would love to see a designer interviewed about the reasons they went with those cards.
---
There was a Mysterious Challenger shit post on here years ago where a man was standing on top of a mountain and screamed "WHO AM I?", then a bunch of secrets appeared around him. I think it was an edited clip from a Chinese movie. It made me laugh, if anybody knows where to find that please link it.
---
Gnomeferatu.
---
I love everything about this card
---
I agree with stonekeep. Obv. all of us would like to be on the frontpage, but I would never downvote other posts.
---
Holy heck I forgot about bellringer sentry, that guy is mad scientist on steroids. You're right about all the secret-based early game, even just spy and blade are pretty huge for the deck, avenge is pretty key too. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being really strong.
---
Zephrys isn‚Äôt a spell
---
yes but the existence of Zul'jin makes 9 mana Call of the Wild way better than it was back then
---
I feel like the 2 Warrior cards are a waste of space. They could have added Forge of Souls and N'Zoth's First Mate to push Quest Warrior, which no one plays right now, but I don't see Varian and the Brave appearing anywhere.
---
No, the Horseman is a major update, it has its own Tavern Brawl, new format, a cinematic... etc etc. It's almost an expansion on its own, of course not a real one. But I think we can all safely assume this is the next major update.
---
God dammit Flamewanker is back.
---
Can't say for 100% certain, but they are very likely based on almost all past bundles having been limited to one.
---
Pre-nerf Dr Boom, Mad Genius
---
The announcement doesn't say anything about that, so that's probably not going to happen.
---
pfft... 77%... what a shmuck
---
Portal first. Then mechwarper.  It costs 0. I promise.  Its the wild meta
---
Hopefully. Would be interesting.
---
Wouldn't that lose to priest's topsy turvy build?
---
I did indeed.
---
Time to start brainstorming now I guess
---
Having played wild during SoU, yes.
---
&gt; But I never downvote "competition"
---
That's good to hear!
---
&gt; Mummified Sylvanases
---
Oh dear god.
---
Yare Yare
---
The Legendaries N'Zoth, Sylvanas, Ragnaros and Thaurissan are very strong and meta-breaking.  I think these could dramatically transform the meta.  N'Zoth and Thaurissan in particular could open up new archetypes (or revive old archetypes not in today's meta).
---
I had kinda expected to see Dr Boom. I'd be interested in seeing whether he got play these days.
---
Lmao I had no idea that was a thing. I don't think I would stand a chance. That sounds fun as heck though!
---
*I serve the fiya lord*
---
I think all recent ones were one buy only. Don't think they will change it.
---
As well as Marked Shot...
---
I doubt it sees any play, frankly
---
This format is straight up unfair for classes without highlander class cards...
---
Probably. The post has been edited (it originally had the arena sets currently used), and originally it *did* say the Basic and Classic sets.
---
It will lose to a lot of things. The joke is that this references a popular video in which this strategy is repeatedly (and enthusiastically) tried and countered.
---
And Priest can give her reborn. Won't that be something?
---
Mad scientist wasn‚Äôt played in secret paladin.
---
Well, I have been trying Reno hunter in wild a ton lately, and I can tell you Call of the wild is way too slow and greedy for a deck that already struggles against aggressive strategies, even with old Reno. There's a slim chance that it could work since aggro in standard is no where near as fast as it is in wild, but I doubt it.
---
But all you really need is EITHER a coldlight oracle or a shadowstep in hand in a deck with only cards in it, and you're constantly drawing more cards. If you have a brann or a shark totem (or whatever it's called) out, it's even easier to draw the cards you need.
---
He makes spells, including Flare when it‚Äôs relevant
---
Neutral Reborn guy with 1/2 stats is good enough.
---
Naga was not broken, it's weaker than SN1P-SN4P which is a perfectly fine deck.
---
Syvanas+Nine Lives is enough. Especially when hunter is so strong.
---
The meta will likely shift dramatically. All the legendaries are insane (maybe not curator) and Flamewalker is insane.
---
&gt; fun
---
wait wait wait... do we get all those cards.. for free with the disadvantage that we cant disenchant them? is that it? I'm not sure i got it right. if that is the case I am SOOOO excited as I have never played n'zoth before as I joined hs when he was rotating out and I didnt have enough dust to play him
---
Deathstalker Rexxar. Insanely broken, but building beasts was fun
---
&gt; one of the reason of the introduction of wild in the first place.
---
A few weeks long event =/= being in standard set
---
My sweet Doppio
---
Do we get two copies of the non-legendaries?
---
[[Valeera The Hollow]] easily- her flavor is so on point- hero stealth for a turn, duplicating fun value cards, and just creating a unique game state while also being quite skill testing- deciding which card in hand to copy can lead to some really interesting decisions, especially with things like zero-cost [[Arcane Giant]]s and [[Vanish]], where you can decide if you want to send threats all at once or a slow-drop for your opponent to attempt to deal with.

It's not about druid running it, it's about puzzle box casting it.
---
Quest druid with Kun... Must be nasty
---
We've got official clarification. The Wild cards DO NOT rotate out after the event is over - they rotate out "with the next major update". From what we've gathered, it means until next expansion (2 months).
---
So torn!! On the one hand I absolutely adore cards like Thaurisan, astral communion, n\`zoth and renounce dankness, but on the other I might just legit quit this game if I have to deal with evolve bs, free 5/5's and the wankmeister pinging my entire board down every game.
---
What do you mean! It‚Äôs 23 free cards! How can you be this upset? What did you expect?
---
Challenger isn't a problem. Avenge is a problem. Challenger was in standard for a full year after avenge rotated and did almost nothing. That card is brutal to play against, and one of the things that makes a challenger truly frightening (competitive spirit isn't bad, but we don't have good token spam for pallies right now)
---
Nice
---
Sylv is totally going in my quest paladin.
---
Maybe N'Zoth too.
---
Bet there's some way to OTK with Rag too.
---
Oh, I thought that was just random, everyone gets him?
---
Yes Druid
---
If it‚Äôs anything like when I played TESPA, you might end up playing a team that is one or two metas behind, or brings off meta decks, anyways lol
---
Jade Druid was fun to play.  After the 6th or 7th round, most conceded the match to me.
---
Bringing n'zoth's first mate to push quest warrior would probably leave quest warrior being completely unplayed, but push the current aggro warrior lists over the edge.
---
[[Astral Communion]] and [[Lock and Load]], I guess [[Varian Wrynn]] as well, all seem like complete throwaways for being brought back. I'm not sure if [[The Curator]] has enough good targets in standard to be worth it, although I could see it as a 7 card draw for OTK pally I guess. 
---
[[Renounce Darkness]] is at least pure meme quality.
---
&gt; There's a reason why Zoo doesn't run it even though it's an option.

Because lackey synergy and eggs are better suited to zoo.

---
**WHOOSHWHOOSH**
---
Renounce Darkness is super fun at least.
---
Nzoth + Togwaggle scheme
---
Honestly, I feel like if you‚Äôve spent a lot of money/time on the game, Blizzard CS may give you a one-time exception. I recently got the Lunara hero even though I barely played last year since I had screenshots proving I had received the quest. 
---
I mean, if you‚Äôve been a loyal customer for this long, it‚Äôs worth a shot just to ask. The worst that could happen is that they‚Äôll say no.
---
How? Big Priest is far and away the best deck in standard right now and control warrior is still as offensive as ever. Even more so AFTER the buff cause the one class that held it's own against it is litteraly unplayable right now (mage)
---
There's been worse meta but i wouldn't say this is one of the best metas ever.
---
Doom in the Tomb is all the Tavern Brawl stuff. What they're saying is that the Wild cards in Standard will remain for a little while longer after the Doom in the Tomb events are over. Everyone will have full access to the free Wild cards for the entirety of their time in Standard.
---
We hate priest already. Northshire on 1 into tolvir circle. This will just make it worse
---
The real answer is they're probably toying around with a rotating classic set instead if having the same classic and basic sets forever. Which if done right would be insanely good for the game. 
---
Imagine if say Azure Drake came back for awhile because it's not OP in a certain set. Or if for example Divine Spirit / Inner Fire went away this year but came back in 2 when it's not so oppressive. 
---
Just a few ideas.
---
I'm calling it now, Pirate Thief Rogue is gonna be legit.
---
I am actually somewhat optimistic about swashburgler. While it is not as individually powerful as Pharaoh Cat, it is another one drop that replaces itself. Rogue can use whatever one drop it can get right now. Additionally, we do have some of the strongest burgle synergy in standard right now in vendetta and underbelly fence. Swash may just see a ton of play within rogue.
---
However, that is probably not enough to get rogue itself out of its current rut, especially if *any* N'zoth deck emerges. It doesn't help that Shaku Doesn't really seem that special either.
---
Might not end up relevant, but I can't wait for N'Zoth/Sylvanas Rez Priest
---
Sylvanas. Cube. 9 lives. Nzoth. All of Rogue and Hunters deathrattle stuff. 
---
Deathrattle. Res. Priest. With lightbomb.
---
Unfortunately You will learn the hard way why some of these cards were so hated
---
*Who am I?*
---
Any word if these temporary cards will work in wild? I've got most of them, but I don't have some of the legendaries and epics.
---
Well Bloodhoof is just GOOD considering that Warrior has good Taunt and great Self-damage synergies right now.
---
Varian though... He's thrown in to help the Boom Reaver and Dimensional Ripper Archetype.
---
Yeahhh, plus it‚Äôs a full 6/6, literally no downside
---
so it would be good idea to geta  arena run going now to 2 losses?
---
Well, this is supposed to mix up standard and make people have fun...not cause people to get pissed and leave. They added sylv, flamwaker, mysterious challenger, Thing from bellow...this seems like it'll just piss people off
---
Weasel Tunneler. 
---
It's not a good card but it's funny as heck.
---
Later in the Wild version it was. There was a point where it played Mad Scientist and Call to Arms. So you just decked out by turn 10 combined with Mysterious Challenger, but you usually won.
---
Oof i now regret dusting rag
---
Too bad you can't use those.
---
The Coin.
---
It is absolutely not fair. 
---
It should not count as playing a spell. 
---
It should not give you an extra spell for Mana Cyclone.
---
It should not be able to negate a counter spell.
---
(Or he used to play around other secrets)
---
It shouldn‚Äôt make Vanclef bigger.
---
There are so many problems with this card and how it functions within the game. It is completely broken. 
---
But damn if I don‚Äôt love every single time I go second.
---
It probably gets them to start running [[Desert Hare]]
---
I imagine that even if some of the Wild card returns end up backfiring a bit (such as powerful combo enablers, looking at you Emperor Thaurissan) that the team will look back on this event with positivity, much like how they've reverted buffs on Luna's Pocket Galaxy and the like but said that the idea was great, just that a couple of cards went overboard.
---
Quest druid is going to get a bit stronger, cause  a *hundred kings will rise again!*
---
Rip the other old gods
---
Microbots are 1 mana tokens. The hares are 3 mana
---
Wow so the leak WAS real, I'm happy as the leak had very competent and fun picks.
---
No Duplicate format makes me feel like I would definitely be playing Even Warlock.
---
The point of Desert Hare is that the tokens cost 3, so they evolve into 4-drops.
---
That would be so awesome
---
Forget Sylvanas, hope everyone's ready for Thaurissan and Maly Druid.
---
Maybe, but without Divine Favor the deck will run out of cards very fast. Maybe we'll see secrets return to Highlander Paladin.
---
Thank the Lord I stopped playing when I did. I wouldn't like this nah, not one bit
---
I'm hyped for Emporor
---
I think I went against you you fkin destroyed me
---
No they'll be in the game 2 months https://twitter.com/Chris_Attalus/status/1180175531444060160
---
Warrior doesn‚Äôt have class specific highlander cards yet Highlander Warrior/Reno Warrior is/has been arguably stronger than Highlander Druid ever was.
---
Such a legendary vid. Have a great day for reminding me of it.
---
They'll be in the game for 2 months
---
https://twitter.com/Chris_Attalus/status/1180175531444060160

Lightbomb?  fml
---
Yup, Flamewaker is gonna single handedly enable Cyclone Mage.

---
&gt; *Bow down before the God of Death.*
---
Im sorry :c
---
Are you in the business of misery?
---
I haven't won yet, so that must've been another memelord :P
---
First thing I thought of was Quest Pally with Rag and Sylvanas.
---
Azure Drake.
---
It is a dragon, it has Spell Damage, it draws a card, it is blue and it annoys the hell out of Priest due to 4 attack and 4 health. And it is blue again.
---
Same, we'll actually get some time to really see the meta change.
---
"only rush i have a lecture at 9"
---
Actually can win with fatigue damage from Coldlight! I can't seem to figure out how it works though, I think you have to use it when they have exactly one card left, then use more Coldlights for incremental damage. I only outright killed an opponent once though.
---
The moment you realize that you don't care about the complaining since you play wild.
---
Fucking PTSD right there
---
Standard Highlander Hunter has no problems getting to turn 10.
---
\[\[Spits coffee from mouth\]\]
---
Wow they really didnt care about Druid huh
---
Also oh dear god not mysterious challenger
---
Awww woulda been cool if it was you
---
Warrior, Rogue, and Druid got the short end of the stick.
---
What about the other reno so you can stay alive
---
I really think Warlock should have gotten some actual support rather than a meme card and something that only fits the one thing it's already doing.
---
Yup, that's one of the ways of beating him with priest, and it happens quite often from what I've seen.
---
I remember beating all the chapters with the same control(kinda midrange-y)paladin deck, since uther was the card I was excited the most. My highlights were using the horsemen's against marrowgar and killing saurfang with ashbringer and 1 hit of the dk weapon.
---
That's great, has anyone tried [[Hakkar, the Soulflayer]], too bad I don't have the card.
---
what about unnerfing prep and move vanish to standard?
---
Gotta bring back Mage up from the lower tiers. Ya know Blizzard can‚Äôt abide Mage not having a tier 1/2 deck. 
---
Warlock, on the other hand, gets a meme card in Renounce Darkness. Imp Gang Boss may help Zoo lists, though.
---
Im so excited for this. Even if bringing back some of these cards turns out to be a mistake it will sure as hell be exciting to experiment with them again - Seems like Blizzard have been really stepping up their game lately!
---
You're making a lot of broad claims that are just plain untrue.
---
&gt;if you want a deck that ca climb ladder to about rank 5, you have to craft some legendaries and epics.
---
No, you don't. Any skilled player can climb to Rank 5 with a budget deck consisting entirely of commons and rares.
---
&gt;Players who dont grind or just F2P players are forced to play midrange hunter and their wild decks.
---
No, they aren't. You can just complete most of your quests (not even all of them) and be able to build top tier decks every expansion, and not just the budget-friendly ones.
---
But even if it weren't possible to get to Rank 5 without crafting a few epics or legendaries here or there or if your deck options were limited as a F2P player, how is that a problem when you're getting that content for free? Your "solutions" would more than likely introduce new problems in the form of Blizzard trying to recoup expenses through some other avenue.
---
Meanwhile, it sounds the real problem is that you aren't managing your resources very well if you're describing your own experience with the game. So many people point fingers at the game's economy when I would be willing to bet that a lot of those players are losing out on thousands of dust a year in the form of dust they could have acquired but didn't and dust they shouldn't have spent but did.
---
Even worse is that he played the coin after the Mana Cyclone. Really makes you wonder just how hard some of those Heroic Adventures (including Dungeon Runs) would become if they made the AI better.
---
until you meet iceblock. yeah, that was the deck I rolled until 25-30 wins then I got shit on by iceblock mage. Apprectice, iceblock, arcane intellect, research project, ancient mysteries, and the 6th doesnt even matter. I play that deck right now and use frostbolt, but thinking of glyph
---
Also made a deck centred around playing Yogg as much as possible but then i realised i had made a stall deck that later allowed me to reach the turn limit against bomb warrior. Ferocious Howl, Wild Growth, Astral Communion, Tree of Life, Ultimate Infestation and Yogg.
---
The leak came from me posting it to the comphs discord, then sipiwipi took the information, tweeted it, and it went large. 
---
I don't think I'll ever be in a position to leak again but I want to strongly encourage anybody who is to do so. The GMs and their friends knew about these cards a week in advance and got to practice a lot more for Bucharest as a result of it. It was a big FU to the tier 2 players who didn't have mates that were GM. 
---
I heard Blizzard were furious about the leak and honestly, they should be (and I don't care how angry they are) - a lot of people found out about the cards. Multiple people were able to confirm the cards to me and I knew a lot of other people (mates with GMs) who were told early too. They had a "don't leak, keep the trust" policy though because they are actually invested in competition still. This isn't even the first time, the preparation and co nerfs were revealed early to the GMs (and anyone else in the GM discord like the casters).

7/5/6 | Battlecry: Equip Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury.  
---
Wow, how can anybody drop that low because of something like a Wild meta report. Congrats, rofl.
---
You monster D:
---
It says they'll remain in Standard until the next patch, meaning in the third expansion of the year they won't be in Standard anymore.
---
They‚Äôre not rotating out after only three weeks; they‚Äôll be in Standard for about two months. It says this before the list of rotating cards:
---
&gt; **IMPORTANT NOTE:** While these cards were re-introduced during the Doom in the Tomb event, they will remain in Standard past the event's conclusion, until the launch of our next major update. More details will be shared, including exact end dates and times, in the coming weeks.
---
‚ÄúNext major update‚Äù in this case most likely means the release of the next expansion.
---
And I'm missing every single piece of it because of WoW classic, and before then I've had an up to date collection from every expansion before now. Bad timing I guess. Pulling back cards from wild is a neat stunt but I don't think it's going to pull me out of old Azeroth.
---
i dint get offered rogue,so went druid ,and only went 1 in 2(gonna let it run out for event for free ticket) but that cause i dint have that good of a deck and i queed in 2 decks way better then i had. Just bad luck.
---
Mysterious Challenger could definitely be super interesting. Besides a lot of people would love to see the cards other people dislike come back, even Sylvanas.  
---
The currently good Priest deck wouldn't run N'zoth and Lightbomb. Deathrattle Rez is an archetype which isn't good right now.
---
Thank you for this. I myself am an F2P player, and I can't get past shieldbearer rank, but that's down to my own incompetence.
---
Why you gotta keep jerking them off? They're not a good resource.
---
I meant more something to get them into the end game. Spellstone would've been cool with the insane amount of self damaging cards they have.
---
Just do whatever the heck Kibler did with Quest Mage
---
Lock and Load was only in the game when Spell Hunter wasn't a thing yet, so who knows.
---
Depends on the color spell being held
---
First deck I tried was 
---
Ray of Frost
---
Frostbolt
---
Zephrys the Great
---
Kazakus
---
Reno Jackson
---
Reno the Relicologist
---
That was fun.
---
Lol when you almost ended a turn without attacking
---
Evolve Shaman is already a niche deck in wild, tier 4 probably. Even there Desert Hare into Evolve on turn 4 (or 3 with coin) is pretty tough to deal with for other tempo decks. In Standard this combo is going to win you at least some games, I'm sure, even if the deck overall is still bad.
---
FeLlOw hUmAnS
---
Pretty hyped about call of the wild... scared to see flamewalker
---
Coldlight Oracle without a doubt. The reason my favorite deck exists.
---
Call me 'old-school' but I like Stormwind Champion.
---
&gt; Flamewa**n**ker
---
*Eyyy*, another /r/flamewanker enthusiast!
---
I have yet to lose with this Warrior deck:
---
- Zephyrys
---
- Clockwork Goblin
---
- Zola the Gorgon
---
- Eater of Secrets _(Fuck off, Mages)_
---
- Wrenchcalibur
---
- Reno Fucking Jackson
---
I've been considering swapping out _Wrenchcalibur_ for an _Ironbeak Owl_ or an _Execute_ for those Pesky Priests, but I doubt either would help much once their ball gets rolling.
---
*runs to check deck slots*
---
Doom in the Tomb? That‚Äôs what my friends call me after a nice Indian dinner!!
---
And warlock still getting shafted LOL
---
[deleted]
---
Pretty sure I've dusted all of them.
---
Malygos Druid is a particularly difficult deck to pilot, so it‚Äôs not going to be as common as the typical Quest variation. However, its tournament presence is undeniable.
---
When?
---
Also thuarissan + wraps on 7
---
I'm excited that Sylvanas is coming back, too. I'm weirdly excited to see if turn 10 Sylvanas + Brawl is still a relevant combo in 2019.

Who's ready for some N' Zoth action?!
---
Too bad astral communion is complete garbage with the wild growth and innervate nerfs. It used to be my favorite wild deck, now it‚Äôs practically unplayable
---
Doomsayer? All three hares cost three
---
PowerCreep is more likely to happen in Wild because cards don't leave so if they are weak, they don't get ran.
---
In Standard, things change a lot. For example, the power level of decks this year are not as strong as the KoFT/Baku/Genn Meta. Hard to determine if Rag is good, but a solid big drop like Rag can easily find its way in decks especially as good cards cycle out.

Not a counter vs mill rogue, discard warlock and quest OTK mage
---
Weasel Priest is one of my all-time favorite decks (because I'm a jerk), and I still play it occasionally in Wild.
---
Doomsayer costs 2, not 4
---
I really hope this is them testing the waters of a core set.
---
Looks like all us F2P players have to stop playing and wait this out
---
These cards should be available to everyone
---
...i really can‚Äôt wait for full renounce darkness RNG deck...
---
Highlander Mage is likely to include Bablling Book, Emperor Thaurissian, Ragnaros the Firelord, and Sylvannas Windrunner. What cards the deck is going to cut to make room for those, I can't really say.
