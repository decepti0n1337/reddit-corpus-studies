Lol sorry for the badly phrased title
---
Pick your battles man. You could have complained about anything and you chose the amount of clicks to get to the new (free) content.
---
At least you could play around Jaina to a degree (don't give her 1 HP targets to kill). There is nothing you can do to stop the river of value coming from Boom (and previously Rexxar) once it gets played.
---
I was able to win my run with it. You're gonna burn cards out of your deck, but honestly always having a full hand is very nice. Just make sure to draft low cost cards + value generators for late game.
---
I love this new mode don't get me wrong, but I wish I could disenchant Zayle. I just reallllly don't want to play random premade decks. 
---
I totally get why it, and especially Whizbang, are so popular and loved, but it just does not appeal to me one single bit. I would much rather have 1600, hell, even 400 dust. I would even take a garbage meme golden legendary instead. It is a very cool reward, but I know it's just going to sit in my collection collecting dust.
---
trogg-&gt;totem golem-&gt;coin tuskar-&gt;4 mana 7/7. the good ol days.
---
Can you describe the difficulty gradient. I haven‚Äôt tried heroic but am curious what you mean
---
Hunter spells aren't trash, but in order to get good usage out of Zul'jin you need to have a) planned in advance by building spells that work well with Zul'jin and can't wreck your own board, and b) actually have *played* those spells. If you've put two copies of a secret in your deck and played both already then one of those is still wasted. Then there's also the possibility of order misfires; if your enemy has a heavy board set up and Release the Hounds fills up your side before you can do anything, you can say goodbye to all those big chungus wyverns you were hoping to get to wipe out your enemy's stuff...
---
I was vaguely considering picking him. Thank you for suffering for the sake of all the players who shall bravely follow in your footsteps...
---
If you're stuck at a rank floor with a tier 1/2 deck, then you should consider evaluating your tech choices and your piloting of the deck. Otherwise, take a break from HS and wait for nerfs or the next expansion.
---
I mean current hero cards are much weaker then previous DKs
---
It more about Blizzard pushing too much, they make same mistake with hunter (better beast for zombeast pool) or warlock (healing) when release so many good mechs for warrior because they want mech (control) warrior will be a thing,a 4/5 deal 10 damage and can be discover is ridiculous value
---
Pardon my ignorance, which hunter deck?
---
You'd be surprised by how many things I can complain about
---
?
---
A worm of that size is NSFW, and that probably has multiple meanings in this scenario.
---
Working properly, its your understanding of the interaction that lead to the loss.
---
Batterheads text requires two components, the attack and the kill, together. One attack gave no kill and then an enchantment gave a kill. The attack and the kill were seperate and therefore the conditions were not met.
---
Embarrassingly, the first time I faced him, I accidentally gave him both the minion that increases the opponent's spell cost by 1, rendering my coins useless, AND the minion that makes it so whenever your opponent play a card it overloads them by 1.
---
This is a reference to the toy from WoW with the same name. You get it off of random mobs in Icecrown (Or as me, inside ICC) and it has about &lt;1% chance of dropping.
---
Lmao Firebat (World Champion, Omnislash content creator) couldn‚Äôt get past the first boss after like 3 attempts on stream during the reveal. Normal mode, especially the final bosses, can have some unrelenting RNG
---
That's my Bishhhh, I miss her so much
---
Morrigan is pretty good if you didn't have to pay the mana cost.
---
He can't take more than 3 damage at a time. He was the 7th boss on my first run with the free chapter.
---
I'd also like to see stats for achievements after you've unlocked the new power or hero. Like how many times you've played an elemental or froze a character as mage.
---
I'm not watching them for that very reason, but if it's anything like what I'm picturing, at least maybe that will make HS people realize how utterly boring this is, and make changes.
---
We must not be playing the same game if your opponent doesn‚Äôt have warpath on demand at all times
---
It may shock you to learn that yes, I did indeed hit him in the face with a battlecry for 2048
---
Well done, glad you persevered!
---
I wouldn't overthink it too much though. I played giggling inventor vs a boss that had a few 1 attack minions and big minions and the boss traded with the big minions to remove the divine shield then traded into the 1/2s with their 1/1s then traded into the 1/1s with their other big minions lol. It was almost as if they were trying to find the worse way to get through giggling inventor possible.
---
70 members, unless you have an extremely recent source. Hearthstone didn't even come out originally on mobile so not comfortable calling it a mobile game. I think a more reasonable comparison is Magic the Gathering, whose team over at Wizards of the Coast is much larger (ten folks on story design alone)
---
Damn, the secret's out!
---
Then the doppelgangsters should work too.

when you think you have lethal but she plays Baron Geddon and heals for 10+
---
Yeah but you can't sap an immune target anyway, can you?
---
 [pics](https://imgur.com/a/pcs8A6t) 
---
I had that staff which makes all 5+ minions cost 5 and the other passive which halfs the cost of all cards, needless to say it was pretty fun and I felt very sad when I after finishing the run
---
Yep.  This feels the same as dungeon run, which this being the 4th one now has worn a little thin.
---
After summoning the Jade it updates to show the next Jade that would be summoned.
---
But they do work if they got buffed in Handbuff Paladin
---
&gt; (don't give her 1 HP targets to kill)
---
That's nearly impossible with all the damage spells mage has.  Not to mention she can ping her own minions like Voodoo doll
---
I usually just do the solo content for whatever quest they give and grind ladder, but I haven't touched ladder since this was released. It's so fun! It's almost like a whole new game. Really pleased and glad they took as long as they needed with this.
---
It's an item in WoW

How he have all the hero unlocked ? I just have the first three and I have Buy the adventure.

---
I saved up gold for it and don't regret it at all. It is a lot of fun. With the packs you get in return + the dust from the golden pack, the loss isn't too much at all imo
---
Your welcome sir ^_^
---
Do not, under any circumstances, dust Shaw. You can build all sorts of low-cost decks around him.
---
So I guess all  the Dalaran bartenders are named Bob? Like a Nurse Joy/Officer Jenny from Pokemon thing?
---
I also had the boss who steals Pyros until I kill him, but instead of going into my hand he got the 6/6 into
---
I added jan'alai, removal and sustainability
---
üåäüåäüåäüåä
---
Did he not gain armor?
---
uhhhh
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say it. Rush was a mistake. Minions should not be able to attack on the turn they are played.
---
I got Mayor in my first run.
---
Apparently, "randomly" means getting hit in face  6 outta 6 times.
---
Not going to lie I took this guy as a joke before I knew all the things he actually did (first or second run) I didn‚Äôt regret it as much as I thought I would either 
---
Except when he turned my lich king into dragon caller Alana ‚Äúrandom legendaries are always good‚Äù smh
---
You're one hundred percent wrong. Dr boom isn't even that good because without it control warrior gets stomped even worse by every control deck right now. 
---
Also apparently Dr boom is busted yet the top 4 decks in the game right now are all aggro decks lol
---
Dammit why are you back
---
i tagged this as gameplay, hopefully that is sufficient idk how to flair things here lmao
---
Not you again... Can we have a karma threshold on this sub?
---
300 runs...And I can‚Äôt wait to play every single one of them. :)
---
But how could you not take the 4/7/7 anyways?
---
god that boss is such a fuckfest, at least make it a minimum 1 attack cause he can make some decks become literally useless
---
I think u left him with 9 hp, unless you got very lucky with the hero power discounts
---
Were you able to clear the dungeon with such a high chance of drawing them over and over lol
---
Did you win lol
---
I think u left him with 9 hp, unless you got lucky with hero power discounts.
---
Just change it to ‚Äúadd a random mech to your hand‚Äù or ‚Äúadd a spare part to your hand‚Äù
---
It would still be infinite value, but waaaaay less powerful
---
He's stronger than 5/9 of them. Arguably 6/9 of them.
---
I think u left him with 9 hp, unless you got lucky with hero power discounts

If he silences it though he can totally attack.
---
Part of it is that voicing them probably costs more than people think. Michele Morrow did an Angry Chicken interview years ago on being brought in to voice Alleria for the $10 hunter hero and I believe she said it was a surprising amount of work, requiring several sessions. I do wonder if they'd sold them for $5 if there would have been significantly more purchases, but seeing the reaction to the Adventure makes me think otherwise
---
I'm done with both chapters but it's still so fun trying out like 3 different hero powers and 4 different decks per hero. Also heroic mode. So many different outcomes and styles to choose from in this solo adventure. It is definitely worth it

verdelucht#1695
---
Was the blank taunt token able to be interacted with, or just a visual error to you?
---
If that isn‚Äôt what you are talking about, the purple portal that spawns imps is the Warlock discard quest reward. It is intended to be unable to be interacted with or removed. That kind of token is called a **Permanent** and is used for dormant effects ([[The Darkness]], [[Sherazin, Corpse Flower]]) and otherwise environmental effects like the imp summoning.
---
I apologize if this is not what you are posting about. Were you able to complete the match?
---
What do you guys think about more hero powers too? Like 3 per hero?
---
As long as you didn't play 1 or 4 health minions you were mostly fine.
---
Now it will be the last card in your deck
---
Is there a ladder in wild too?
---
Test
---
The first thing advice dude ever did for me was make a 2 mana spell into 8 mana. He has done really good things since, but I was like "wtf is this stupid treasure I picked?"
---
Uhmm, yes, he's definitely better. Yogg was just a hail mary. He was nerfed because a card that random shouldn't see competitive play. Zul'jin is a powerful finisher.
---
I 100% every pve in the past (including all 27 combinations in the  rumble run after blizzard toned it down) this time it will not happen its just to much and not different enough. 
---
I miss the way it was done in the old adventures like League of Explorers. Unique encounters - cart drive, Rafam stealing your deck.     It was much more focused on telling story in a cool way and focusing on main characters -  Reno, Elise, Finley, Brann.  
---
Compare it to Heist or Rumble. There is not much story telling behind the hero you are piloting. In Heist the first two wings feel very similar: now you are fighting in bank so here is a thing that gives 2 coins, now it's a prison so here is a cage. It doesn't have big impact, there is not much story telling it just feels little bland. 
---
Of course it's very strong in other aspects but for me replay ability was never a concern. And it looks like it's balanced much better compared to Rumble, heroic is little to easy if somebody wants to just unlock cardback and not do 100%. 
---
Btw. Dungeon run, Rumble, Heist should have some special prize (card back, whatever) for doing 100% imho. It's like missing the tip of mountain after climbing.
---
Nobody said so.

---
It seems obvious that they don‚Äôt waste budget on something that‚Äôs going to sell less than the value of the work that goes into it. You think artists are cheap?
---
The issue isn't the format but the time they decided to implement it. Plus, tournament formats have always favored slower decks.
---
As a Warrior main, it feels nice to know Blizzard loves me.
---
I beat gallywix the same way today but with 4 of those kladvir that get +2/+2 per inspire
---
You mad lad
---
Side note: This card is the most unfun thing I've ever seen. Not necessarily most powerful but definitely least fun.
---
That sounds more like a completionist's paradise.
---
1. That replayability value.
---
2. There's no point calling yourself a completionist if all you're willing to set yourself up for is the easy stuff. I'm not a completionist because I beat the Lich King with all 9 classes. I'm just a dude who wanted Arthas.
---
Hats off to anyone who does a "100% completion" of the Dalaran Heist. It's a far better flex than "100% completion" of a Dungeon Run.
---
How do you buy chapter 2 of the Heist with gold? Can't find it anywhere :(
---
Hello,
---
I‚Äôd like to ask about your policy.  You said I can post my own content to subreddit but I need to participate in the discussions on reddit.  I don‚Äôt know how to participate in the discussions on reddit to participate in subreddit.   
---
I‚Äôm new to reddit and wish to continue to post my works on reddit, so please let me know what exactly I have to do to do so.  
---
Thank you in advance for your help.
---
Go dalaran bank&gt;flip book to chapter 2&gt; buy&gt; enjoy
---
even some DK is a joke compaed to other DK
---
Yeah happened to me too today
---
If you just want the packs, Dalaran Heist is not a good way to spend your gold/cash. You get 12 more RoS packs, the un-disenchantable legendary, and a golden vanilla pack for $25/2800g. You could get 28 packs for that gold. 
---
If you enjoy adventure, get it. If you‚Äôre in it for the packs, you should pass.
---
It's still pretty easy to beat him with that.
---
The post sounds more tongue-in-cheek to me than anything, I love that there's so much content that completing all of it takes so long. The unlocks not transferring to heroic however is genuinely frustrating.
---
Oh that's why .. I thought my totems will be gold if my hero is gold
---
i did heroic for first time in both chapters lol
---
This card is awesome, gave me the win in a fight i had no business winning.... i lost to the big eye guy at the end, but still pretty nice.
---
didnt you already post that before?
---
I feel like a lot of the end bosses are weak in comparison to other bosses. The ones you face between 5-7 are way more difficult and some are even overturned such as the discard lady. 
---
From the last 4 bosses I faced in heroic mode, 2 were somewhat challenging and the other 2 were a walk in park. Gallywix and the multiple eyed demon are extremely easy since their hero powers are way to slow or have very little influence in the game. Wag toggle and Cyonasa are slightly challenging, I would say wagtoggle is a bit more difficulty compared to the other boss.
---
From my experience it feels like most bosses run out of steam fast and sometimes you can just generate way to many threats thanks to combos and absolutely broken treasures.
---
Wait-

krle#2766 80g trade EU

I just tried him, and it's ok a lot of rng as with most things in HS, like he changed my loot hoarder into cairne, which was great, he did frost nova on my enemy's board again, great, sometimes drew me a second card on my turn, pretty nice. But then my spell power totem would die and he would shuffle it into my deck again... which is not terrible but certainly not the minion i'd like to get copies of.
---
I'm assuming that the AI is going to get harder the further in that you get, and that it's been done this way on purpose
---
Update: The guy had been added to scammer list
---
no, he doesn't know about business but he admits it and he doesn't pretend he knows shit

therock#22138 EU trading 80g quest, check and then you going first
---
&gt;Compared to last expansion, the free PvE is pitiful. You get ONE class. There are TWO final bosses. Even Rumble Run has more replayability, and Rumble Run kinda sucked. At the very least they should give everyone one deck and one hero power from every class. You get less stuff than before unless you pay. The game is more expensive.  
---
so far I did about 5 runs with rakanishu and all 5 runs were completely different with completely insane and crazy things that didn't happen in any previous runs, I would say the replayability is decent
---
An illusion, what are you hiding?
---
Maybe you organized one, is your "friends" button yellow?
---
Blows my mind btw that we've still yet to see the words "ignores Taunt" on any minion in the game so far
---
No, it's normal as seen on the screenshot.
---
Nice
---
I think your game broke af, the only thing you can do now is reinstall hearthstone or wait a month for blizzard to fix it. Tried my best, sorry
---
This is it, isn't it?
---
This is our new rock.
---
There is a video on Youtube of a rant by David Mitchell about exactly this, where he expresses his indignation about how Americans have turned certain English sayings into nonsensical phrases, this being a prime example.
---
One of the new bosses got a hero power called Greed Is Good. Gotta love infinite money &amp; wood cheats in Warcraft 3!
---
You can consistently have a board full of huge minions by turn 3 or 4 simply by rolling for robe of gaudiness and pick shaman or hunter because they have a lot of big minions
---
Oh my GOD, why is your title as clickbaity and ill-informed as something freakin' Toast makes!?
---
Getting the robe early enough &amp; then getting enough big minions to justify it isn't consistant. If it were, that would also be pretty busted.
---
That doesn't sound right. I had an enemy boss use 2 Coins with litterally nothing to use Mana on &amp; no spell synergy.
---
I also had another boss get my 6 hp minion down to 2 hp, and then slam his minion with Deathrattle: Destroy a random minion into it. I didn't have any other minions.
---
Both of those happened in Heroic mode, I thought the AI was supposed to be less shit in that? It doesn't seem any harder than the regular mode.
---
Such Finesse
---
This is what happens when middle aged men play games. Brilliant
---
&gt; fyi Zayle will only be updated after the next rotation
---
He said they won't change next expansion which is correct. 
---
Whizbang gets a new deck every expansion for every class, Zayle gets updated in a year.
---
I bought it despite suspecting that it wasn't worth it. Was feeling left out, or something. My favorite thing is the ability to tweak your deck in the Inn, although I think that aspect should be a little deeper.
---
The biggest flaw with it in my eyes is that normal mode is a push-over, while heroic mode feels like rolling the dice and hoping you don't hit something you simply can't beat. I think this is a big problem. I don't feel as if I'm "adventuring" on either mode, because on one, my choices don't matter much (I'll win regardless) and on the other, it feels like constant desperation.
---
Warrior is the best !
---
Which doesn't matter when Standard lacks the deathknights. He's still infinite value. So what's your point....?  
---
Also its arguable that he's actually just overall better than warrior's own DK.
---
Bob should be in ANY adventure from now on.

Haha exactly
---
Dats just how they have announced it
---
Maybe not Bomb Warrior, as games can go down to a LOT of RNG. Other than that, you mentioned 3 decks on the aggressive side, Tempo, Token and Zoo. Do you just hate aggro? Sure, the synergy between Waggle Pick, Dread Corsair and Raiding Party is OP af, but other than that, the deck would be fun to play against. Token Druid is a bit polarising, requiring a board wipe to counter it, but still, other than Wispering Woods, with a Soul Of The Forest follow, or just any big board with Soul Of The Forest, the deck is fine. Those circumstances are a bit specific and contesting the board well will play around them. Zoolock, I see no problem with. If you need to play on curve to beat Zoo, then it's a pretty normal Zoo deck. Bomb Warriors aren't the 30 minute matches, CW matches are. A lot of those matches require a ton of skill to outvalue your opponent, or would without Omega Assembly, Delivery Drone and especially Elysiana. You don't just 'lose' against Summoner Mage, you have to remove any high cost minion or you lose. I think that's fair and fun, although the deck does have its BS moments. With a few nerfs, the meta would be even better. Hopefully it's Raiding Party, Boom and Elysiana. But the meta feels great.

You get 12 RoS packs + a golden classic pack for buying the whole thing. If you ignore the golden classic, it's a 1600 gold loss. Not as bad if you value the PvE content.
---
So what your saying is that we should limit content because some dudes with OCD might go overboard. 
---
Yeah fuck off.
---
Beautiful
---
It would fit Hearthstone‚Äôs inconsistency theme.
---
It's almost like nobody knows the full circumstance and only know bits and pieces lol
---
Yeah i thought first 2 wings were stupid easy.  Didnt lose a round
---
Does the golden classic pack share the pity timer with normal classic packs? I want to save mine for when I'm about to hit the pity timer for a epic if that's the case.
---
It's amazing how you don't really get a compensation for it. They messed up and don't even care.
---

---
Golden candle turned a Flame of Azzinoth into Dr. Boom, but the image did not change in game.
---
I know your assumption of 30 minutes per run is arbitrary, but the last wing is longer than all of the others. It has 12 encounters instead of 8, so it would, in theory, take 50% longer to do than runs in any other chapter.
---

---
And the 9 cost discover a legendary get 5 copies

Did they use the Hero Power twice between the last Battlecry they played, and this minion? Because it doesn't say it's limited to this turn.
---
I‚Äôve had zero mana Ragnaros and DK Jaina. Bob is such a bro
---
Exactly, that reward is probably the lamest thing they could come up with.
---
Pathetic.
---
Yeahhh should of waited till he could attack
---
that's nice flejegofio, I'm canarian too
---
Well I've found heroic really really easy once you have unlocked hero powers and decks. So at least having to unlock the powers a decks ment I had some replay value from the first 2 wings.
---
I'm short heroic is too easy
---
... well, until you roll them all into The Darkness at least.

He killed the NA grand masters. Almost 100% warrior mirrors unwatchable. I tuned it for 30 minutes of Amnesiac roping and eating between pushing the button then gave up.
---
Very glad to meet Katsuhiro Otomo here in Reddit
---
I didn't pick it because I wasn't sure what the card actually does when cast. Do you get three copies into your hand?
---
Just 2 weeks and the nerf hammer is going to hit this one.
---
Here‚Äôs a little lesson in trickery...
---
yeah this looks insane
---
I understand what he's saying, that is just not what the word means. You could say it would *have* been nice if he knew what he's talking about before typing.
---
I won against Gallywix with my 1 drop quest hunter deck with deathrattle anomoly. He dropped a Fel Reaver on turn 4, and I simply killed the Coin guy, played 8 cards and burned his entire deck. Eventually cleared his board and passed turn until he died.
---

---
Not bad :)
---
You are going to be disappointed. "My jank isn't good" is a universal complaint with CCGs. You want a game that is diverse, yet perfectly balanced. That doesn't exist.
---
I pulled him through Army of the Dead, she said something which I can't remember. She didn't concede though.
---
You must pay if you want the king!
---
This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them.
---
Just had 3 draw and shuffle 1 cost minions infinite value ftw
---
He filled my hand with jaina DK at turn 2...
---
They had that secret in play for so many turns I assumed it was Ice Block, boy was I wrong.
---
Shu#12977 NA 80g quest, I'll show and you go first.
---
When I played 2 of him she said something funny too.
---
How is having dinner out a mandatory?
---
&gt;360 hours
---
That's like halfway to 99 Runecrafting
---
Please nerf her first
---
Is it using play dead on a goblin bomb?
---
Fuck that encounter. Sometimes its an autoloss. If you play zoo decks
---
Passive should ne nerfed
---
Why pick that one with a Carnassa deck? Isn‚Äôt it kind of the endgame to spam the board with Raptors every turn?
---
To be honest this is not so good :(
---
Had a double battle cry synergy hunter deck and she wiped me by turn 7ish, I got tilted to say the least.
---
You can with kidnapper
---
Wow this got quite a lot of attention! I don't want to look like a piece of shit but I'm just gonna mention down here in the comments real quick that [I'm starting out as a small Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0D37XdaQ4abUxeyfyzY_-Q?view_as=subscriber). If any of you would like to take a look and see if the content interests you, feel free to do so! Thanks either way for all the upvotes and good luck out there in the field of Hearthstone :)
---
What does that spell summon?
---
That‚Äôs not a huge number of bugs
---
Any of the annoyo bots with taunt and divine shield.
---
I'm not talking about the delete one minion. That I use almost every time.
---
I'm talking the fire every minion on your side.
---
No way I'm gonna dismiss antonidas and apprentice, just to get rid of brewmaster
---
Not as massive as this fella.
---
 Clarity#11678 (NA) looking to trade 80 gold quest, I show then you go first üò∫ (36th time trading check history)
---
Knuckles for the win. Duh.
---
That means annoy o tron, annoy o module and psych o tron?
---
I think so
---
Misplay on the turn 7, should have weapon killed the pirate
---
No, i did it :)
---
jk Cool Ragnaros.
---
Is it +2/+2 when played?
---
OMG PEOPLE PLAY GOOD DECKS WAAAAA!
---
Do something different. Play wild or arena. Enjoy the solo content.
---
Gallywix is almost impossible to heat if you have robes of gaudiness I learned. My hand was eventually just full of coins and I couldn't do anything.
---
This image is inconsistent itself.
---
Normal Zayle is from packs, you get golden if you buy the 5 cha√±s of the new adventure
---
German scien- err... magic is the best in the world!
---
My luck was nowhere to be found. Had shaman with hero power: draw a card (Overkill 1). Then the hero power upgrade (cost 1 less and can be used twice). 
---
I had Wilfred Fizzlebang (cards drawn from your hero power have their mana cost reduced to 0) always start on my hand and left card -2.
---
I thought it would be OP.
---
The combo did not work, cards kept their costs... Just my luck. 
---
I don't understand why it did not work though. I use my hero power to draw a card... Sure, I am not a warlock, but that was not a requirement...
---
Hello darkness my old friend
---
Actually, yes. I haven‚Äôt been able to finish ANY of the dungeon runs/witchwood/rumble, but I got through the first chapter in one go with both Hunter and Mage. I didn‚Äôt get the second chapter, so maybe they increase in difficulty over the chapters? But yeah, if I, who has never finished any of the other single player runs, can finish one chapter in one go, it should be labeled easy.
---
(Please don‚Äôt make fun of me I love this game I‚Äôm just super bad at it)
---
Bob has a family, let the guy have a day off once in awhile.
---
 I met him in chapter 1, in heroic mode
---
Nah, just got my Zayle that I pulled taken away from my collection and they gave me a new random one. Got an email as well saying that you're not suppose to be able to get Zayle from packs.
---
are you a fisherman?
---
Rhino. RTFC.
---
That hero power exists? I only ever see the Paladin one, and occasionallly Druid and rogue.
---
Could you explain why it gets easy after you unlock things?
---
Gang‚Äôs All Here is a weird Card, something in the wording makes it work the way they described.
---
I haven't played heroic yet, but normal mode seems very easy. Dungeon run difficulty was pretty good for most classes, but some, mage specifically, are impossible.
---
Why not both? Everybody needs to relax sometimes.
---
I actually think hes a better rexxar. The mech synergy with rush is already a buff to all mechs you play. Rexxar had to find a minion with rush to get that buff. Mechs you discover could board clearplus rush, rexxar just built big minions with no direct impact on the board besides generating more than the need to remove it. 
---
Dr boom has a damage hero power plus 7 life (armor) gain, summon 3 microbots with rush and the ability to magnetize with other mechs found with assembly or delivery drone. The only downside is the hero power is randomized thank God. Theres simply way more upside to playing dr boom over rexxar. Rexxar had to pay 2 mana to build a big minion that you may not even be able to play and if you did the enemy would usually just remove it. 
---
Rexxars power came from the fact that they usually had board control and pressure with spellstone and the threat of double kill command and the damage they already put on your face to threaten lethal. You then had to choose if you keep their big threat up or clear the smaller minions.
---
Genuine question, since it‚Äôs relevant: what should this sub consist of instead?
---
Thank you very much
---
Thanks for the guide. One difference from my experience has been that rocket backpack would be excellent for every class. It's been an easy win for me everytime, use it to keep initiative and then just make a really greedy top-end heavy deck. Better than goggles IMO
---
I really don't like playing paladin / mage. I disenchanted everything from mage but I have some cards from pally but I feel that it's very boring to play. I play hunter/rogue.
---
Hello my friend, how are you? I accept orders!
---
wow ur youtube is good u should do youtube full time
---
Hopefully they will hotfix it soon then.
---
Many thanks my friend for your comment! I love making these greeting cards!
---
Reminds me of that one quest for Chromie in Dragonblight where you were aided by your future self and then had to aid your past self.
---
Thank you my friend!
---
Hunter quest + always start with halazi. Think the game goes long? Get your free quest completion on 6. Think you don't need it? You'll never get it in your opening hand!
---
It's not necessarily how the decks work, or how to tech against them, it's just how unenjoyable it is to play against them.  When a rogue can pop 5ish cards turn 4 and drop a 12/12, it's a little disheartening.  Token druid is not as bad, given that it either works well, or falls flat on its face.  I guess that's what makes it so unenjoyable to play against.  Knowing exactly what you need to do to stop it, but not being able to solely based on your card draw.  Zoolock is definitely fine, and I'll take back my qualms with it.  My only issue is that it sucks knowing that if I don't get a good curve in the opening hand, I might as well concede.
---
Second sentence..
---
Because you lost...? We need some context buddy
---
Many thanks my friend for your comment!

Wisdomball does as much harm as good, but he's fun to play with and these runs are easy so I pick it every time.
---
Tempo rogue or conjurer mage and buy ros packs
---
Yeah I beat the heist wing 1 normal on my first try and I still had fun trying it out and was satisfied with it. I'd much rather this way than the old way where "difficulty" was some bullshit card that summons a full board of gnomes for 4 mana or other insane gimmicks.
---
Dalaran heist is single player so it matters even less than ranked or casual.  Just pick whatever seems fun based on what your deck it
---
There's a treasure that replaces every minion in your deck with one of the minions on the board. I used it on Kalecgos. Note that I also have the "your minions that cost 5+ cost 5" passive. It was not the most difficult run from there...
---
haHAA
---
I think you underestimate what it‚Äôs like to be a new player in a game that you‚Äôve never seen before
---
I would prefer it if you could unlock them by completing the heroic mode, like Arthras.
---
omg
---
Now you fucked up
---
Your Dungeon Run guided ended up being more accurate than the wiki, so props for your efforts!
---
The friendly encounter or the Bartendotron?
---
There's already an unlock for doing that, the card back.
---
This would give you an additional challenge to want to complete.
---
Yeah i have same problem. The support just told me [this](http://prntscr.com/nq7jvl)

---
You say F2P but the gold required is more than enough payment for the skins.
---
Prince's Ring is great for a control deck what are you smoking my dude? Below Mysterious Tome? Below Dr. Boom's Remote? Below Book of Wonders? **Absolutely not.**
---
S-tier outcome:
---
* Jaina. Making a 3/6 every turn is **pretty good**. I feel like this doesn't need justification. Auto-wins every boss before 6. 
---
Great outcomes:
---
* Gul'dan. Deal 3 heal 3. You have so much HP to play with that you can face tank a lot of damage, let the opponent over-commit, munch some guys, then swing back with a board-clear and get that HP back with your hero power. This hero power also just beats some of the early aggro bosses. 
---
* Shadow Reflections  - Oh, you have retardedly OP cards in your deck? Why not another? Oh, I'm losing on board? Orb Orb. Filthy as fuck. You have a very slow start without use of a traditional hero power but you absolutely nut if you're playing Control and the opponent can't race you down first.
---
* Build-a-Beast - Yeah, member how insane DK Rexxar was? Turns out drawing an extra OP card every turn is really really good.
---
Good outcomes :
---
* Pally 2/2. Not great. But if you control the board and keep your opponent from establishing himself you can just deal 80+ damage with the instant-kill effect. Bad against aggressive opponents, but if you have the right draws in your deck it's fine. 
---
* Priest is actually pretty okay. I assumed rolling it would be a disaster, but dealing 2 twice per turn can be really really good for just getting that little bit of extra juice to get a full board clear in a tough spot. 
---
Bad outcomes:
---
* Druid Swinging your face is pretty bad when there's a lot of big stuff later in the run. Heal 3 is pretty bad. Not a great outcome. You may smack a minion or two early in the game but otherwise it's really just a warrior hero power. 
---
* Shaman - This is literally just the Shaman starting hero power. This is the ultimate low-roll. You can do stuff with it in a Control deck and it works for your overall game-plan to be fair, healing your big stuff to full HP, but you're basically salty as fuck that you have a starting hero power as your hero power. 
---
* Warrior I haven't seen this in-action but I'm almost positive this would be really shitty, you don't have synergy effects with it and it doesn't do enough to really answer any threats. 
---
In summary, 1/9 to nut, pretty solid outcomes the majority of the time, it's definitely not in the league of the absolute best of the best (agree that emerald goggles, robes of gaudiness, and wisdomball are way better) but I definitely think if you draft accordingly going for a grinder value plan, it's generally high-impact. I'm guessing you just had a bad experience with it and are feeling burned.
---
Yeah i have same problem. The support just told me [this](http://prntscr.com/nq7jvl) Translation: many players currently have that problem. The devs are working on a fix already. So we just have to wait

this is why they say greed is bad.
---
Bartendotron
---
i can't tell if you're serious or not lol
---
While I like pretty much everything carbot does, including this one. I think Hearthstone is the one he least keep track on. Especially when you compare it to his other series that have more detail. Diablo specially.
---
I mean, Guldan drew final seal from his deck. HIS, DECK.
---
really? Do you REALLY think people are so retarded that they can't read the word 'warrior' or 'druid' on their screen to check what class their opponent is?
---
Just think of the benefits of having a whole raft of characters to choose from each class!
