&gt; There are certain cards like Emperor Thaurissan and Loatheb that may not be in the top decks, but are Wild staples and often useful.
---

---
Loatheb is mentioned in a blurb, so maybe the final "Wild Staple Cards" are ill-named..? Or should be "Other Wild Staples"?
---
Either way, Loatheb is a fine addition to any Wild collection. Strong card and is used in a few meta decks (e.g. Odd Rogue)

Hmm, I'll give it a try. What type of ticket did you open? Payments?

Not sure if you’re serious but this graphic has some issues. First of all it shows how certain cards are bad against dirty rat and yet it calls dirty rat a bad battlecry.

So bad that it doesnt even have a battlecry
---
No see think about it. You have two minions in hand: Wardruid Loti, and Silverback King. Your opponent plays Dirty Rat. What would be better for it to pull? It's a bad result for the opponent no matter what, but for you, there's only one bad result.
---
maybe replace the stargazer luna odd mage shell with the clockwork automaton odd mage shell instead? pushes more face damage, in exchange for crazy draw turns i guess. Plus, you still have black cat and pyromaniac to draw you cards.
---

---
If you’re being serious, Patriarch has never been power creeped, even though it’s an intro card.
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
Situationally awful...
---
Turn 2 Tyrion ggwp 
---
Players, especially Spikes (those who derive their fun from winning), will typically crowd around decks that find the closest balance between expedient to climb ladder with (as in games are short), cheap to build, and capable of winning more than fifty percent of games. This applies doubly so for formats with heavily restricted and figured out card pools, as standard currently is, and the fact it tends to happen is not a fault of the game. It pretty much happens in every card game.
---
Dr. Boom was the best card a few years back. You won’t see it in wild much now but he is a meme card
---
At least dirty rat actually sees play in wild sometimes
---
Wouldn't it be fair to only compare it to other neutrals as class cards are meant to be stronger on average than class cards?
---
It works if 0 packs have been opened since the guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs was introduced. Packs before that dont matter.
---
Do you play in Americas server?
---
The 1/1 counts as a buff, which doesn't persist trough death/silence/shuffle etc.
---
What about Druid? Will they finally release that class?
---
Wat? 
---
A "1/1 copy" is nothing more than a regular minion which has a specific enchantment applied. Cards that go to Graveyard don't keep their enchantments. That's about it actually.
---
I'm glad we can at least agree that the matchup is heavily slanted in Even Rogue's favor, whatever terminology we use.
---
i looked through it and thought the same thing.  The ratings seem off and fail to define the nuances of something like aya blackpaw being a jade deck nuetral staple and very good for any deck runnings jades.  Being marked as C, which is noted as "tech card or doesn't have a huge impact" is pretty counter to what the actual case with the card is (its not a tech in the slightest, but a staple to the deck archetype regardless of what you are playing against unless you see literally only aggro or something strange like that...it also DOES have a huge impact being a deathrattle card that fits with nzoth (who is marked as a staple) that brings solid immediate states early game and insane immediate stats late game and often will pull hard removal options and silences from an opponent's deck since each iteration of the battlecry/deathrattle increases your next jade).  As another example, crackle is one of the best damage spells in the game, and is somehow marked as a C as well, which to me shows a lack of understanding about what makes the decks strong.  crackle is one of the many reasons why even shaman is stong in wild as it gives the deck a LOT of reach (and is also, as an aside, part of why the aggro shamans of old were so frustrating).  As said below, then things like boom are in there as staples.  While boom is still a solid card that can fit in pretty much every deck as a "well, i don't have that...so...i'll just use boom here" he isn't an insta-craft anymore by any means unless you are new to the format and need something you can slip into a great number of decks due to not having a lot of card options.  Being called a staple, again, fails to show the nuances as to what boom actually is...a great card for newer players to craft to help them fill out their decks before they get the ACTUAL cards they would want in that slot.  Even then, at this point i'd recommend a crafting of lich king over boom in that situation.  
---
So yea, I'd skip over anything related to crafting in the guide until furthur notice.  Instead of assuming incompetence on grading, I think the problem is more so that the OP's grading scale lacks enough nuance to make the grades mean something.
---
As for ideas for the OP, so I'm not just being all negative here, I would recommend trying to seperate cards less on an A, B, C scale and more on "deck staple," "meta staple," "evergreen staple,"  "tech/quirky," "filler/stop gap/value," and "bulk" ssystem while actively avoiding any ordering to the scale at all (as there are many times a deck staple will be stronger than an evergreen staple and a tech/quirky card being better than a meta staple...the main point of the names is to indicate whether the card is good to craft because it is always going to be good, is good becuase it fits in the meta atm, is good because it is important to a specific deck type, or is good because its a high value craft.  
---
As an example, Dr. boom would be marked imo as a "filler/stop gap/value" card only, as he isn't really required for any decks, he isn't really "meta," he isn't an evergreen staple like someone like lotheb as boom can both replace and be replaced by things rather easily nowadays and would have other cards crafted before it as the "just craft this one card and fill up your open 7+ slot", but he also isn't just bulk either.  
---
Aya, under these groupings, would be marked as "deck staple" because she is too important to be merely a tech card, but also isn't going to generally be played in decks outside of the jade umbrella.  A similar card in the "deck staple" would be any other high power jade card, any high powered cthun card (some are not deck staple worthy, but cthun himself obviously is), and kazakus (who also probably fits into "meta" as well since reno is such a ubiquitous deck archtype in the format and possible other titles).  
---
Meta staple is a shifting title that would basically be on any card that is very heavily used in decks that are part of the top meta decks.  I would argue, for example, that both lotheb and lich king would fit under "meta staple" "evergreen" and "filler/stop gap/value" as both are nuetral, can fit in a lot of decks, are solid options to replace things in a deck if you don't have a given card, are part of meta decks, and don't have anything about them that makes it seem like they would all of a sudden drop off in value (usually meaning they are strong on their own and aren't strong due to being part of a particular combo).  
---
As for the "meaning" of each title, id match it most nearly to this:
---
"deck staple = if you want to play this deck, crafting these are a priority"
---
meta staple = "a deck staple might be better for a given deck, but you can't go wrong crafting these atm because they are seen all over the place"
---
evergreen staple = "some of the safest crafts in the game.  They are used in a lot of decks, are strong, and don't run the risk of getting hammered too hard if something else around it got nerfed.  Unless you have a very specific deck you are wanting to play, these are probably going to be the cards you craft first."
---
tech/quirky = "these are cards are "hate" cards, "cool" cards, or any kind of card you might sideboard if you were allowed to change cards out between matches in a best of series (a la magic the gathering)."
---
filler/stop gap/value = "You craft this card because you would rather craft one card to put in five decklists than the 3-4 different cards those decks TOLD you to use.  They can be played in a lot of things when you don't have the actual card being called for and often have such a strong initial power to them that it doesn't matter if they aren't the best fit for the deck because they are just so strong on their own."  
---
 bulk = "not as harsh as saying 'don't craft,' bulk here means more so that the card is neither a staple for a deck nor a crazy power level meta card nor a super cool or super techy card nor a big value craft.  Some are actually fairly strong cards, but they aren't necessarily things you would say "i should craft this and only this to fill out that 2 drop spot in my deck."  This section also houses all the straight up garbage cards, so it could absolutely be further differentiated, but since even ppl posting large comments on reddit only have so much free time to kill, its best to probably just leave them lumped together here.  
---
But yea, just some thoughts on how to improve the card crafting evaluation for op.  And maybe you want to stick with a numbered/letter system, and that is fine, but if you are then i think you have to be VERY accurate with those numbers (and you will STILL not give the clearest picture for what to craft outside some of the very obvious choices).  I do understand that often ppl don't want to think and just want to be told what to craft though, so i understand the value of a bit more mindless numbering/lettering system as far as letting people quickly understand your general message.  
---

Just because the majority of packs are below100 dust doesnt mean the average is less than 100. Because legendaries and golden legendaires are so far outside the average dust value of other cards they tend to have the average shift back, which makes up for the 40 dust packs. For every X 40 dust packs there are Y packs that have thousands of dust value. 
---
If you were to silence a 1/1 copy of a minion created by Twilight's Call, the copy then has the stats of the original. The same applies to Shadow Essence. The stat change is an enchantment much like Blessing of Kings.
---
When a card like Diamond Spellstone resurrects a minion, it brings back an unenchanted copy of it.

I agree with most of what you're saying, and I'll even concede that more disruption tools would be nice, but I don't think that there is something inherently wrong with Hearthstone at the moment. You're correct that Odd warrior is a tier 1 deck, and it's just as oppressive to certain decks as OTK decks are to them. OTK decks themselves are polarizing by their very nature. Decks with immensely strong win conditions need hard counters for the sake of balance. I know it's frustrating to queue into decks that you have no hope of beating, but that's the price you pay for playing a deck that does one thing extremely well and ignores all other aspects of the game. My opposition to OP's post is that he CHOOSES to play a polarizing deck, then complains on reddit when he finds the game too polarizing. There are plenty of other options out there with more even spreads, and I don't see anything wrong with certain decks being extremely polarizing as long as those other options exist. Some people like to dominate matches while forgoing others, and that's perfectly OK.

I would be surprised if out of 40 packs the average dust was over 100. I play arena and i consider it worth it to get a pack and 45 dust if i only even get 2 wins because that’s like a 50 gold pack essentially with 45 dust. And i earn dust much faster that way then by buying packs

---
if it's the first set having an under water theme, i'm hoping for the year of the narwhal!
---
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. One silverback patriarch is a tremendous amount of value in one card.
---
One patriarch can trade into and kill four silver hand recruits. Four recruits can kill two stoneskin basilisks. Two basilisks can kill four Tyrantuses (would that be the plural of tyrantus?). With some quik maths and ez logic, the above means that a single silverback patriarch can kill approximately four Tyrantuses for only 3 mana and it’s a neutral card in the basic set.
---
For Paladin it’s a concede and there aren’t many combos out there. No one plays mecjathun
---
Woke Leaver was my favorite deck for a real long time. I brought it to a local Swiss tournament once and went 3–0 with it on my way to a money finish. Good times. 
---
I 100% agree with you.
---
Even Shaman has been part of the top three decks of Wild for more than half a year. It, along with Odd Paladin and Odd Rogue have been considered the strongest decks in Wild based on Vicious Syndicate and Tempo Storm meta reports. I'm not exaggerating, go look at either meta report and you'll find Even Shaman / Odd Rogue / Odd Paladin as the top three decks in both meta reports month after moth. Odd Paladin moved out post-nerf, nerf Even Shaman and Odd Rogue are still the Top 2 decks.
---
Even some of my decks which target Even Shaman are hugely reliant on opening draws to ensure I don't get stomped hard Even Shaman players in the midgame who know how to play the matchup correctly.
---
Big Priest is a strong, but super susceptible to aggro decks. Most of my aggro decks can comfortably beat Big Priest but Even Shaman is so strong at keeping board control, that it's pretty much impossible for me to run an aggro deck that can beat Big Priest and have a positive winrate against Even Shaman.
---
If you look at the matchup chart on VS, many decks have favorable winrates against Big Priest: Mech Hunter, Exodia Mage, Big Rogue, Kingsbane Rogue, Odd Rogue, Pirate Warrior
---
But Even Shaman only has two bad matchups: Reno Priest and Evenlock.
---
Realistically?
---
3 new card sets, and extremely importantly the rotating out of both Quests and Hero Cards.
---
The rotating out of Hero Cards, especially, will change the way Standard is played, *massively.* So much so that Genn and Baku will become ever more present, I think. Especially the possibility of grinder Baku decks, that accumulate value over time by virtue of their Hero Power, that no longer gets so strongly outclassed by, for instance, Frost Lich Jaina or Deathstalker Rexxar's Hero Power.
---
Hopefully a new feature or two as well. Tournament Mode would be nice but we know that's on hold. Anything that offers additional free rewards, or improvements to the card collection system like when they made duplicate Legendaries from packs impossible (unless you already had all the Legendaries of the set) would be fantastic.
---
Unrealistically, I would kill if they made &gt;2 Epics impossible, so if you had two of the same Epic from a set, the next Epic is guaranteed to be a different one, one that you only own one or less of. Epics tend to be really neat (e.g. Untamed Beastmaster, Toxmonger) and/or really powerful (e.g. Carnivorous Cube, Voodoo Doll, Voidlord) cards that serve as excellent skeletons in many decks alongside the Legendaries. And yet, they are rather difficult to obtain two of, and despite being less expensive than a Legendary, there's nothing stopping you from getting wrekt by opening one shortly after crafting a couple.
---
___
---
**TL;DR:** Hero Cards cycling out is huge. 3 card sets will swing by, which will be great. New feature or two would be great, what I most hope for is an improvement to gathering a better collection -- *super* hopefully is the possibility of not getting duplicate Epics in packs, though I think this is unlikely.
---
Worse vs mind control works for every card really

If it isn't worth it to you, there's your answer to your question.

---
yeah these people have no idea what they’re talking about, its more rare to not get offered any super coliders or warpaths than to get them. The bucket system favors warrior, and you can basically draft control warrior everytime, weapons are stupid value.
---
this argument isn't a good one due to its subjectivity. the problem control players have against OTK decks isn't that they hate OTK decks, it's that they hate not having an option to have a chance in the game.
---
with your logic I can say that aggro should be out of the game because I don't like it and that's that. OTK should be out of the game because it makes me sad. there's no logical argument with either of those statements that progresses the conversation and yet you've essentially only said this

---
Of course, it's not a good career move, but it's easy to say 'well just move on, how hard is it?!" when you can't relate to anything he's said. 
---
Argent Commander is a finisher option in Even Shaman and sees play only in that deck in part because of the applicability with Corpsetaker, and Mind Control tech has come and gone between formats before now, especially when board spamming is the go to strategy.
---
The classic set pretty much is the strongest set in Standard at any given time. Even now. However, the average card strength in of last year's sets are all things considered are between that of Whispers of the Old Gods and The Grand Tournament. That place might just be a sweetspot for a set's general power level.
---
The legendary cards especially have some really interesting ideas behind them that aren't far off from being viable if they aren't already. Archmage Arugal, Darius Crowley, Toki, Time-Tinker, and Myra Rotspring are a few I can think of quickly that could be playable in April.
---
I also doubt Odd and Even decks will be anywhere near as prevalent as they are now. With the smaller card pool, they'll find themselves with fewer playable cards compared to decks that don't want to play with the restriction. At the very least, Even Warlock, Even Shaman, Even Paladin, Odd Rogue, Odd Mage, and Odd Paladin will be each losing upwards of five cards critical to the deck. Only Odd Warrior come out somewhat unscathed, but the lose of Reckless Flurry will have a greater effect on that deck than most thing.
---
The game isn't going to return to the original classic format. Even if it does, somehow, it will still be refreshing and be representative of the hard reset this year's rotation will be for the game. Everything someone can reasonably complain about this Standard format is at least enabled by Year of the Mammoth cards.
---
They are both terrible Mage decks that work the same way.  Both play Luna's Pocket Galaxy.  One requires getting 8+ damage with the hero power before playing Jan'alie + Cube + Faceless + Faceless + Deathwing.  The other uses Leeroy/Charged Devilsaur instead of Jan'alie

I'm not going to give thoughts regarding the concerns of racism, as someone who's worked for a decent-sized company, this spoke to me:
---
&gt;Drew assured me that he would talk with her, that she was going through life things, and that things would get better once we got more headcount and my workload reduced—I was still working stupid hours to get things done regularly and my health under the pressure of having to deal with Gemma started to nosedive
---
as I've definitely had managers (and later directors) use this exact excuse with me.  "Things will get better when we are at the mythical level of being fully staffed, so I will choose to ignore the concerns you bring."  I have yet to see us fully staffed.
---
Boring cards are just not interesting.  Look at Time Out!, just don't take damage until your next turn starts, while that is a powerful game winning effect, it is boring.  Gonk would be a good example of a weak card that isn't boring.
---
It feels like the game isn't even a back and forth anymore. If my opponent is playing a combo deck, they are playing solitaire instead of Hearthstone. When they lose they didn't lose to me, they lost to draw RNG or the match-up. I get that you can't just smack minions around with every new expansion, but it just feels obnoxious to print so many decks with linear playstyles. How is it fun to play against a deck that is basically "survive until you collect x, y, and z, then win". And then the game devs need to walk on eggshells with every expansion because every card that improves draw or survivability pushes these decks closer and closer into the top spot. Look at Kingsbane; feels awful to play against if you were slow, but it wasn't common enough to be overly frustrating. Then they print a card that seriously feels like it must have been hand sculpted to fit into the deck (draw 2 weapon buff minions and kingsbane), and it is all over the place.
---
Maybe I'm just overly nostalgic of the good old days when decks didn't just spit out infinite value as if it was the norm.
---
I guess I should specify as long as explosive runes was going to look it if it was handbuffed to six and you had no spell damage it would die.
---
You can put a /s for sarcasm so we know, because this doesn't look like half-assed sarcasm even. 
---
That's fair, but rank 5 is still way better than rank 20 like how someone who could get to diamond 5 or plat is a lot better than bronze and silver even if they are in danger if dropping a rank or do drop down 1. I have been watching my friend struggle with fully made hunter decks in ranks 20 to 15 and hasnt been able to get over that benchmark yet. I think we both exaggerated but you did bring up a good point and that video was from last week I am like rank 4 or 3 rn 
---
So one good deck out of 18? You get a 1/18 chance to play a good deck for 1600 dust. 
---
Yeah u right

It was a meme on another post 
---
That was only initially and even then he admitted it was "in a joking manner", not that that makes it any better.

The rest of the post no racism or sexism comes up again, at all.  That seemed the catalyst perhaps for his downward spiral.

Hey Julian.

In case you are reading this.
---
Don't take this comment section to heart, no one here has insight into the situation, and your story goes against conventional wisdom. 
---
We humans have patterns naratives and expectations and everything that goes against that will be seen very critically. Most of the stuff written here has nothing to do with you and is only a result of peoples own agendas and narratives. 
---
It is sad to hear what you had to experience. Being treated as a someone you are not and would hate to be, is a horrible experience.
---
I hope your next chapter of life will offer many good things to you and esoecially some air to breathe.

And i hope at some point we will be better equipped to avoi/deal with situations like this.

Not sure what contract law is in the US so it's hard to relate for me because you we tend to have a heavy focus on worker rights here and situations like this leading to mental illness (regardless of who/what is fault) and allowing the individual to continue working in the situation causing the issues (long hours) would be grounds for large fines against the company and compensation for the employee.  
---
I think Korea would care as much because of things like Asian games, and Korea as a culture promoting esports quite a bit on national and sponsored level, Cups in the Far-East have high price pools and production quality/budgets, so I doubt they are in loss there otherwise price pools and production quality would already be lower.
---
This would affect Europe, NA etc a lot more. 
---
Personally, I wont care much. I find it difficult to follow the tournaments anyways, and really don't have a grasp on hearthstone esports enough to figure out which ones matter and how the championship paths are setup. The thing that will matter to me is if it causes shows like Angry Chicken and Omnislash and Value town to die/end. If this affects HSReplay and hearthpwn etc. well, then that means meta will take longer to get stale and netdecking will go down and i will be able to win with homebrews. 
---
Very nerdy and geeky (in a good way), Good Job!
---
Though that wall of text was hard to get through maybe add a **tl;dr** summary and demonstrate it's pratical uses in an actual game(even a friendly one).
---
Also please add the actual readme in the readme file and not a link to this subreddit, you never when a post will get archived or something.
---
Thanks for making this :D
---
Druid will be pure garbage. It will be the ungoro warlock, where all classes are decent but warlock had no viable decks.
---
Very interesting.  
---
Who do companies get away with this in the US? That is allowing someone to work such hours etc. to get themselves into such a state in the first place?  Do you not have laws protecting workers rights or something?
---
That story in no way, shape or form is anywhere near close to what Harvey Weinstein is accused of, get real.
---
I mean its just a really forced and not really a good joke, at best a decent meme.

But i mean who cares.

I got 5 legendarys and 3 Golden epics so id day it’s worth it if you need dust or play wild

That implies intention. This to me is still an quite ill individual (reading some of his recent tweets supports this) and could easily be interpreting events much worse than they are.  
---
No updated list on here, but you could search up updated Lich Kings decks on the internet. This is the old cheap decks though. You could probably expand or improve with these decks as a baseline.

&gt; I know how it feels to face racism in your work environment. 
---
The racism is just the shiny cherry on the abuse sundae. These people were piling on dangerous straw-mans and stereotypes to associated "problematic" attitudes and opinions to this man based on his **sex**, and then doubling down by attributing it to the country he was raised in. This would be just as fundamentally wrong if he'd been pegged for a chauvinistic redneck stereotype for being born in Alabama, it just wouldn't get as much attention.
---
The problem was people in the office ascribing motives and opinions based to him based on superficial characteristics and stereotypes rather than his own speech and actions. Those particular motives and opinions also happen to be absolute landmines in HR land. People gossiping or joking about that sort of crap in the office can seriously endanger someone's career, and it looks like this wasn't the kind of office environment where you're safe to insist people knock it off.

To put it more positively, they are trying to see what they should spend the budget on. Personally I'd far prefer if they spent it on improvements to the game rather than tournaments.
---
As a War Odd Player, this seems like a good play since it gives your AOE / Super Collider more value.

I don't know what was the exact case for your game, but there are reasons to play that way \^\^

They should be emailed to you

That remember me that game in a french tournament (open list) : player 1 was playing a deck with dirty rat, player 2 was playing Spell Hunter (with Barnes + YShaarj).
---
Player 2 kept YShaarj in the mulligan, player 1 sees he kept a card, assumes it was Barnes, plays dirty rat and then conceded.
---
One of the best play I've ever seen \^\^

I definitely wouldn't call this spellhunter. It has 8 minions dude :D I was so confused reading the title, like "wtf kathreena = recruit, what does it have in common with spellhunter :D

This is kind of hybrid between rattle hunter and some kind of beast hunter..

You’re coming from the assumption that people holding a job have a lot of opportunities open to them. They can’t always be picky about where they’re able to find work. There’s an inequity of bargaining power. Then, ironically, you talk about how immigration increases supply, but this weakens your first argument. With the assumption/conclusion that there are then more people competing for jobs, naturally people would be willing to fill in positions where companies abuse them, out of desperation. 
---
As for immigration increasing just supply, the fact is that you’re also increasing the amount of consumers in the country. You potentially create more jobs in the process of handling increased consumer demands. Not to mention, it seems pretty damn likely that someone working at a high profile company like Blizzard is a legal immigrant, so I don’t understand what your problem is with him in being an immigrant at all.  
---
Yes, I understood that your comment about Trump was a joke. But it’s a very revealing comment nonetheless about where you’re coming from. 
---
If punching down on the mentally ill makes you feel better about life somehow, good for you, I guess. This man did deal with his life. According to his story, he got meds, he got counseling, and despite feeling so much despair, he made it work. You call that weakness? And even for those who don’t win the fight against depression, who are you to judge everyone’s personal struggle? 
---
Finally, don’t play dumb. You know as well as I do that you’re dismissing this story. You aren’t being neutral when you’re casting doubt on his story on the basis of mental health, his race, and his social class. If you were really “neutral” you would have just left some comment like “I sure hope this isn’t true” or “let’s not witch hunt until we have more information.” Even then, in this case, it would be really hard to find much more proof than anecdotes unless the people he accused of abusing him were stupid enough to leave their racial comments in writing.  
---
I’d ask if they did the same for the shaman totems from the upgraded hero power but nobody in the universe has ever played odd shaman so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
They must have fucked up on a scale as grand as to equal the collection manager implementation on the business side ;-) Either that or they are as greedy as their actions indicate LOL

Really? Stories about month long crushes with 100+ hour workweeks regularly surface for other companies, but I haven't heard them much from Blizzard
---
Fun watch, can we get a deck list?
---
It doesn't loses because it's a bad deck. It loses because the nature of the deck can't do anything against armor gain. 
---
You calling the deck bad is completely arbitrary and creates a double standard convenient for your favorite deck.
---
There are no bad cards. Just clever techs agains \[\[Death Grip\]\]

That would ruin a good shitpost.

*get in
---
&gt; You’re only an outlier if you’re an obvious exception to the data. If most peoples votes included extremes this would be within the trend and obviously not omitted an an outlier.
---
Of course, what i mean is that usually people that play a game don't hate said game. And those that do ARE outliers. The answers you posted are indicative of hating the game, so they are outliers and will be ignored (or labeled as "poor suckers that play something they hate).
---
&gt; Also if it help, these weren’t my exact answers. Just a heads up to let people know that currently Blizzard are offering a platform to voice you opinion. Futile or not, I think it’s a good idea people attempt to voice their opinions they may have when possible, it can’t hurt, can it?
---
Blizzard just canceled HGC because they deemed it "Not worthy" after doing surveys like this and people voting "We don't care about competitive / game is too expensive"
---
Are you sure there is no relationship?
---
Voicing a reasonable opinion is perfectly fine, and you should totally state if you think prices are unfair, you belive hearthstone is p2w or whatever but voting ONLY extremes helps noone.
---
Well, creeper, stonehill, mace, righteous protector, dire mole, fire fly, void ripper and acherus veteran.
---
"Should trouble people" why? Nobody actually cares about HS eSports. It's a waste of time and money for them to keep supporting tournaments and stuff. They should much rather use it to make the game more fun to play, with new game modes and such. 
---
I though this only happens when you play odd rogue in wild. In standard I think it doesnt have any expansion mark.
---
Baku?
---
OWL seems to be making money for Blizzard so I doubt it will get the axe.
---
Tournaments aren't cool. It's pretty much coin flip simulator as the skill cap on this game is very low. I don't see a need for them. 
---
Yeah. But at least they told me that I am a rock star! Which is nice. 
---
&gt; Actually i'd say the opposite, Blizzard just had its worst PR year in the history of the company and has a lot of gamers thinking they're not the same company anymore, not worth investing in anymore, so they really need to nail consumer expectations in 2019, so it would make sense to survey before making any more drastic decisions.
---
I would agree if... the leadership of Activision Blizzard wouldn't had lost touch with it's customers. Because imho that is the core problem behind all of these developments.
---
I made something similar here :)
---
I do agree although in this case it seems consumer opinion over the value of tournaments is, at best, divided.
---
Assholes: "Feminists only care about women's problems, they don't care that men are abused, exploited and overworked".
---

Also assholes: lol man up and take it.
---
The improved hero powers were added with justicar trueheart with the grand tournament. The 2/2 dagger was first seen in the grand tournament, and therefore has a grand tournament watermark on it.
---
BREAKING: people like winning and therefore play good decks
---
I doubt they can just cut OWL, considering the buy instead teams had to pay to get in.
---
Yeah same, guess they really just wanted that vote
---
So its more of a midrange/value hunter then?
---
What do you work? Sounds great
---
I don't 100% agree with the take, but you know what: if the stress level of a job is too much... maybe it's time to look for a new job instead of trying to grind it out.
---
The job required a certain level of stress and this guy couldn't handle it. The sexism and racism is a separate thing but if you can't get a hold of anyone from HR to deal with it, maybe take that as a sign that maybe the company isn't a good one to work for. 
---
If you don't like something? Deal with it. Leave.
---
Get good. 
---
It’s the crown that does it for me 
---
I see Rexxar played incorrectly a lot. I'm down to 10 HP. I have zero defence against the Hunter's hero power. Then they drop Rexxar and lose their momentum allowing me to sneak a comeback win.
---
Just like I incorrectly drop Bish Benedictus filling my high mana Priest deck their with small aggro Hunter minions. I lose momentum and they make a sneaky comeback. When will I learn?
---
No, the game is not popular.. Randomness is not a competitive driving points kill it off so another game can fill the void.
---
On the one hand, when I played Hearthstone I had exactly zero interest in the competitive scene and I can't think of anyone I know who had an interest either. Every time they did those "pick the potential winner for packs" things threads were full of people asking who to pick because they had no idea who anyone was.
---
On the other hand, I hope people are vocal about it because as long as people are able to make a career off of a video game I am all for it. Especially if it is Blizzard/Activision losing that money and giving it to their top players. 
---
Congrats. Can you give me the deck code please?
---
Paladin deck
---
29 1-mana spells 
---
1 [[skulking geist]]
---
This is called Yes Paladin because when you play it you think "Yes"
---
Don't dust Kingsbane. It's still really strong in wild.
---
Some of them look really good.

---
There is a reason odd pala and odd rogue are top decks even in wild
---
Just look at level up nerf, replaced by a "sleeper" neutral card, and odd pala remains tier 1.  
---
Decks like odd rogue and odd pala do well even when you put "janky" neutrals in them because their HP carries them, hence so many neutrals in both decks
---
Just my opinion, I do see your point as well!
---
I didn't get the email, how do we access the survey?
---
Baku totems have the Grand Tournament symbol.
---
Answered this survey earlier, was quite annoyed that it didn't allow me to express my opinion and only asked standard questions.
---
Uhmm... No, they are very far off. I guess some of the low scores are correct, but it was a weak xpac and those tend to be.
---
&gt; l with trans people joining? I mean being one of them, I feel like people would be enraged in both cases of excluding/including us.
---
Afaik riots workshop was for everyone whos not a cis-gender male. And most female-only events were free for trans-people. On the other hand female e-sports and sports scene is pretty much anti-trans.
---
Dude, you're not Rihanna. No one is hating on you lmao. 
---
But all you have to do is wait 3 months and the game might be playable lol. You find something wrong with that design philosophy???
---
Eh, sensible in the short term, unknown results long term. Lots of companies completely lose the respect of costumers and their public image over time by making decisions which make customers unhappy but saves them money.
---
No need for tournament mode if there are no tournaments. *taps forehead*
---
Blizzard is on its downfall. People are finally tired of their lackluster effort put into their games. Their days of living solely off their name are limited.
---

---
I'm pretty sure it's not the game. My PC was built back in 2011 and last upgraded around 2014. Still runs perfect on it and also still runs normal on my old af HTC one that I use for my alt. It's definetely not on the game. 
---
I just played against a priest who used this card on his first turn. I have no idea how this happened, but I got wrecked.
---
People have put a lot of money into a lot of stupid things. Just because rich investors are putting money into OWL does not mean they are smart, that they know what they are doing, or that they have anymore insight than regular players do. 
---
The number of investors and corporations that have gone bankrupt after they made significant investments or doubled down on bad business decisions is huge and do not need listing. 
---
Listen and believe.
---
OK. Cool. 
---
Hearthstone gets enough clips from streams, I think it can do fine without a competitive scene.
---
Imagine saying that after Riot Games' case.
---
That money will not.  That money will go to pump up corporate earnings when they present to wall st.  
---
Why they never pick me? I would love to take on this survey.
---

---
The one thing I wanna know is this Gemma's or social media because she is named as one of the primary reasons for the discrimination.
---
We get it, Jules should have asked for help but at the same time working crazy hours for HCT points(who's doing it now?) was very likely a mandatory part of the job.
---
Gemma it's on. You gone too far.
---
ITT: people not understanding jokes
---
Just a casual shitpost. 
---
&gt;Unlike Hots, people actually play HS.
---
You're so far up your ass that you have no idea what you're talking about. Heroes of the Storm even has activity in South America. It's incredibly active.
---
You are SPECIFICALLY still shaming her, because her "time is spent on YouTube thumbnails and not using her PhD in Computer Science". 
---
YOU JUST WROTE THOSE WORDS. The words you just wrote are the DEFINITION OF SHAMING. Jebus save me.
---
Plus, you then double-shamed her for "following the money", implying that by choosing the way she makes a living, she's somehow abdicating the high moral ground gained by getting a Computer Science degree.
---
 
---
This Gemma went all buddy-buddy with Kim Pham(no surprise) and I tweeted Kim to stop being manipulated by Gemma as what's been happening.
---
For her to drive a man to suicide is despicable and we have a villain here. Che Chou who recently left Blizzard is not blameless either, I tweeted him too and shamed him.
---
Thx for the effort, have you some stats to share? Like win rate, good/bad matchups, with/with out coin, etc? 
---
You typed “shame she had to.” She didn’t have to, she chose to.  If the streaming thing didn’t work out they were going to make bots for games and sell currencies to make money.
---
This is a view of "sensible business" that is doomed in the long term. There's a reason why businesses have "loss leaders" in their portfolio.
---
In the specific case of hearthstone - and also HOTS - products like tournaments with little discernible revenue of their own serve to help people feel like their participation in the game is part of something bigger (your own anecdotal experience aside). It's classic Common Knowledge Game/crowd psychology tactics.
---
Its super long but it sounds to me like this guy had demons and the situation didn't help. Not to blame the victim but there are enough flags being raised early on in his story that it should never have gotten to the point it did. Hope he's doing better now
---
Hence "has posted" instead of just "posted"
---
I've already invested too much, so no xD feelsbad
---
No, but technically you can make them take out their phone and use the Wizards Store and Event Locator until they use up all their data
---
Didn't really know what to feel regarding the Soldier 76 short story. I read the story and I was fine with it, but I knew immediately that this was going to be jumped all over by people.
---
That said I can't go without admitting to myself that Blizz does seem to be stretching a little far on the whole...trying to make a statement. Not gonna say anymore on this cause people will get mad of course.
---
here are all 27 of the cards that were in choice for all classes and it also tells what card was chosen: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/full-list-nine-unique-cards-will-enter-hearthstone-arena-future-patch/ , 
---
I think it's the right fit
---
I think she was a lecturer in Greece, could be wrong though!
---
The only question I think was missing and that I would have liked was a, in order of preference which new features would improve the HS experience for you?
---
I want achievements and more things to unlock god dammit 
---
I read the whole thing too and was completely disgusted by this Gemma.
---
This goes to show me(but not shock me) that women can be discriminators too and use social currency as a weapon to inflict racism on men too.
---
The reason why it's so hard to stand up to Gemma is because women also tend to have all these other methods of redirection, guilt-tripping and other tools that guys really aren't very good at to fight back easily.
---
Men are inferior in many cases when it comes to verbally sparring with women and in this case Jules stood no chance. Especially not when she's buddy-buddy with Kim Pham.
---
It runs fine on my shitbox. There is a 30fps cap at low settings, maybe that's your problem. 
---
If they do this to HS then you can bid farewell to the WoW Arena tourneys because that gets even less viewers/interest. 
---
The most glorious Big Meme Priest I've ever seen was a Big Priest with nothing but Nozdormu in it.  You just revive the Schnoz over and over to piss people off.  Actualy devastating in lower ranks.
---
You can also do the same thing with Blood of the Ancient One for the maximum BIG.  Or with silly Dane style stuff like Noggenfogger, Sneed's and whatnot.
---
You’re probably someone who never got past rank 10.
---
It runs ok when there's nothing going on in the background (still random menu freezes though) but a new thing that's pretty recent for me is how much freaking bandwidth the game is taking now.
---
I usually have YouTube/Spotify in the back but I literally can't play an audio only podcast without it stopping because HS is using pretty much the entire internet. Don't know how many people are facing similar issues. 
---
Nah, it’s “Fuck Hunters” now. We have evolved.
---
Why "for the love of Uther"? According to [hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/meta/), there already are two Paladin decks that are stronger than any Hunter deck 
---
They haven’t suddenly hated Hunter, they’ve just kept on hating the most popular class.
---
They haven’t just started hating either, they’ve been hating since the day they found out Hearthstone has a most popular class. They seem to hate a lot.
---
I think computer science is more productive for society than making YouTube thumbnails. I think it is bad for society when computer scientists spend their time making YouTube thumbnails. Do I judge either side for what they do? Not at all.
---
In your black and white world, people are judged based on their value provided to society. I can view those things objectively, say one is more productive than the other, and get this *not pass judgement on either person!*
---
Now, stick with me, I don’t give a rats ass how she makes her money. If it was YouTube thumbnails, making the next great AI, or working as a prostitute, I don’t care. I do think AI is more beneficial to society than prostitution, but, get this, I DONT CARE WHAT THEY DO. 
---
Jeebus. People like you are so ready to be outraged without thinking, maybe *just maybe* the person you’re upset with didn’t mean it how you interpreted it. 
---
That and Blizzard is a slowly sinking ship. I think Brode just reached a "plateau" state at Blizzard, and could no longer see any improvement/innovation where he currently was.
---
I have to concede that you are right in many ways about this. After being completely disgusted by this story, there has to be a story in the middle but this did not stop me from reaching out to Kim Pham, Che Chou, and trying to find this Gemma's twitter.

Poker does NOT have more RNG than Hearthstone. If we are assuming you are talking about Texas Hold'em, the only opportunities for RNG to affect the game are the cards dealt to each player and the 5 community cards. A big difference between poker and hearthstone is the ability for the player to decide WHEN RNG should affect the game. In poker, the player has no control over which cards come out, how many cards are played, how many cards you start with, etc. Their decision making is much more concrete.
---
Hearthstone has RNG that can affect the game in ways that cannot possibly be anticipated no matter what skill level you have. Add that to the possibilities of good and bad starting hands, good and bad matchups, aggro vs control, and what you have is a game of rock, paper, scissors. When you talk about win rates, you are talking about win rates over hundreds of games. It's only after that many games can you start to see the differences between good and great players. But in a tournament setting? Best out of 3? That 5 - 15% difference is not apparent, and the better player will often lose. I love hearthstone, but it is not "tournament style" kind of game.

Don't harass people. This has nothing to do with you.

If you have opened the pack type before the rules were applied you wont get the the 10pack pity timer.

stop regurgitating bullshit you read on Reddit. Its not a fucking shame that she "gave up her career" in computer science to manage Kripp's streaming empire. I think you dont understand what the phrase "to support Kripp" means. She is supporting him in his career, yes, but they are making money hand over fist, they are a cute couple that are having a good time.
---
You are trying desperately to make it sound like she dropped out of college to work at McDondalds while Kripp sits on his ass playing video games and that just isnt the case.
---
I’ve been playing big spell mage and I’m winning against most of them but that doesn’t stop it being boring, I lost to that priest who was playing Mecha’thun and it was a much more fun game.
---
&gt;She is! Shame she had to give up her career to support Krip but follow the money I suppose.
---
Alternatively, 
---
&gt;She is! It's so nice to see her do what she love, and use her wit, education and skills to further the family business.
---
It's not like she *had to* give up anything, she decided to. 
---
Similarly, I don't think she did it to support Kripp, I think she did it because it was a job description that she was interested in, with coworkers she felt comfortable with.
---
Lastly, I don't think the money really was the main point of decision. Kripp definitely earns enough for a family, so a professor's salary is more than enough added on top of that. 
---
Cap is at 30 FPS for low/med settings, 60 FPS for high setting.

The frown both sounds like a nitpick and a hate.

No they won't without manipulation. If you roll dice 35 times without seeing a 6, your 36th roll has a 1 in 6 chance of being 6. Hearth packs don't have static odds 
---
Oh yeah fuck brsinfart 
---
It applies to any set you've never opened a pack from yet regardless of when the change was applied. So, for your example, you're not guaranteed a legendary in ten TGT packs since you've already opened one.
---
What about just 2 totems effects and stats combined. At random of course.

Wouldn't a new gamemode be more fun? Or an entirely new Blizzard game for that matter? It just doesn't make sense to support it if they aren't making a lot of money from it. 
---
You can do that on pc. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3bdkec/how_to_multibox_hearthstone/

Why? Lich King a neutral is a better 8/8 class taunt from Druid
---
You can't modify config files on iOS. 
---
The expansion is fine, it's just that the old sets still hold the dominant cards, so there's little room to really shine. Once rotation comes around, we might see the Rastakhan cards start to shine some.
---
Several sites have them. This one is pretty good: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/hearthstone-legendaries-can-safely-disenchant/
---
There is always some meta that is annoying. I am sure we all remember pirate warrior, jade druid, secret mage, ect.  There is ALWAYS a hot deck / class that half of the players will be using and hunter is just the latest one.  This is the nature of Hearthstone and all games of this type.  
---
I'm not certain how to access the config from iTunes. Do you have more info or a link you can share?
---
Cool!!! Didn't know that. 
---
Congratulations you found an exception to the general design rule.

And do you see how much lichking is played?

Because its OP/ stronger than classcards but available for everyone.

---
Probably not. The state of PvE AI is largely due to a lack of attention and unwillingness to devote more Blizzard server resources to make it function better.
---
It goes back to something Jon Schafer and others have observed regarding AI in strategy games: you reach the point of diminishing returns in cost from investing time/money/resources in AI improvements much faster than with other areas. Particularly so for a game in which single-player content is more of a side dish and not the primary focus.
---
Plug ur iPhone in go to iTunes go to the screen where it shows everything on your phone. Click on the files section and there should be a folder labeled hearthstone. Click into it you’ll see options.txt. Drag it to ur desktop add in the line and save it, then drag it back into iTunes to overwrite the existing options file. Force quit hearthstone if it’s already running on your device then open it. 
---
I’d ask for a switch port but this game is terrible enough on my 2000$ PC, its mind boggling. Aside from that does anyone know how to get the game to properly size itself in windowed mode on dual monitors? 
---
I get Legend when I want to get Legend. I can share a screenshot if you want it, but I shouldn't even have to. If you actually think that this game takes serious talent, you are probably trash at literally every other game. 
---
You don't because class minions don't automatically mean better. See Lich King vs Druid's 8/8 taunt
---
OK yeah, but why does it need to maintain 60fps it's just a card game? I'd notice if Skyrim or Red Dead or Witcher or etc. dropped a bunch of frames, but HS? This is the game where I read reddit for 50% of the game time and tab back in when I hear my mana refreshing. 
---
Overkill probably checks for negative health everytime an Overkill card deals damage.
---
How about 'there is a Deathlord with a battlecry which is bad'?

Yeah but Rexxar is better than Alleria.

---
Sounds like it could be a hardware issue. I would check the drivers on your GPU first. Have you found posts online with a problem similar to yours?
---
It's not that people dont like solo content. I personally love solo content. It's that ever since the original dungeon run, everything since has felt like watered down cheap knockoffs of it. Also no quality of life changes to solo content such as a retire deck option, or on rumble run, let us pick the class, then 1 of their 3 loas so that we can play the one we want. Why add an ring element to an already ring packed mess that is rumble run? Also lack of creativity when designing the AI. No new creative hero powers. The ai rumble run bosses all have perfectly optimized decks. I've beaten rumble run multiple times with different loas, but most are just hoping you get the loa you want to play with, then hoping you get cards that support it. It's an rng clown fiesta.
---
Getting this mad about a joke
---
Yeah and right after cancelling HGC and gutting HotS.
---
I find standard way more fun, I dislike seeing the same broken cards in the rotation. I'm sure wild is very fun and exciting with a ton of OP decks but I enjoy the constant changes in standard.

---
I got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder during some chaos at my last job. I went on medical leave just like him. It’s extremely difficult to get leave for depression or anxiety unless you have heavy documentation, and he did it twice. So he was definitely very sick.
---
But, the fact that he was able to get leave makes it seem like Blizzard’s company wide HR was doing ok. Now his divisions HR is what fucked up. It sounds like it was practically non-existent. And his managers definitely fucked up too. Those are crazy hours even for someone, even in the industry. It’s the managers job to step and and tell him to slow down. And when he makes multiple complaints about an individual to HR, then that individual becomes his manager? That’s wild.
---
It sounds like HR and his managers saw that he was becoming a pain in the ass, and did their best to make him quit. They couldn’t fire him outright because he was a protected class under ADA. That low review was the first step taken to fire him for performance, which they could in fact do. Probably a CYA thing. So even if he didn’t quit he was probably going to get fired in a year or so.
---
I’m glad he got out, I hope he gets the time and treatment he needs, and I really hope his next job treats him better.
---
But *the game* doesn't need to run at 60fps. Nothing ever moves unless you make it, nothing is reaction based, and nothing requires 60fps. Asking for 60fps seems like just nitpicking, when there are much more important things to complain about, like the friends list freezing the game. 
---
Very disappointed. First week I probably won't win a game. My deck is filled with garbage that doesn't interact with itself. Experiment one with no buffs. 2/1 for 2. And my opponents are playing competitive wild decks lol. 0/4, never seen the 7th turn. 
---
Does Mech Hunter run Candleshot? Legit question btw, I have no idea
---
Probably because there is only 51 responses to the survey, they would need more for it to give more accurate results. 
---
The thing that annoys me the most is that I can't minimize the game to desktop, only alt tab to already open programs. 
---
Whatever it was, I'm sure making thumbnails, editing Hearthstone videos and streaming is a much more enjoyable way to make money.
---
HR doesn't protect you, it protects the company
---
trusting HR is the most horrible idea 
---
Single dragonhawk gets every buff card, is protected with secrets, and goes face every turn, pretty much?

Interesting brawl, but I feel like it's kinda weird that they didn't pair TGT with Rumble. That way it'll get players to try out all of the non-hunter Rumble cards.

You lost ten matches in 23 minutes?

So all those bots on ladder actually play the game on their own accord, because they want to get into esports? Oh.

PSA that they aren't kidding about the "only cards from those sets" restriction.  Tried to make a Beast Hunter deck on one of my FTP alt accounts ... then noticed I wouldn't have Basic &amp; Classic staples like Animal Companion or Kill Command

Good job Blizz, just give a fuck you to anyone that doesn't have full sets from 3-4 years ago ESPECIALLY for people that use the weekly brawl pack as a drip feed of dust

The more I read this, the more it makes sense. Blizzard needs to fix their game. There’s no excuse after you put it so eloquently.

I didn't find it particularly inspiring even taken on its own. Felt very much like a Grand Tournament retread, but with less interesting card design. It says something when of the highlights just lets you bring back an existing card that got hall of famed.

They don't see it bringing in any extra proceeds. Time spent not making money is time not well spent from a business PoV, which is all they really care about.

I don't know why you people always have to say this. Literally no one said it was good for the consumer, someone point where anyone said that. They are saying this makes sense for Blizzard and that's why they are doing it. They aren't condoning it.

&gt;**Hearthstone Update – January 9, 2019**
---
&gt;This Hearthstone update mixes Rumble Run up for a refreshing new change, while also bringing in some updates to Arena buckets together with the cessation of December 2018’s dust refund. Read on for details!
---
&gt;**Arena Updates**
---
&gt;Following our Arena update last December, we have adjusted the appearance rate of each individual card available in Arena to ensure the overall win-rate of each class remains as close as possible to our ideal of 50%.
---
&gt;Hunter, Rogue, and Warrior have had the average quality of their Arena picks lowered.
---
Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Shaman, and Warlock have had the average quality of their Arena picks raised.
---
December Update
---
The dust refunds that were available following our last update in December 2018 are no longer available as of this post.
---
&gt;**Rumble Run Changes**
---
&gt;Champions, rumblers, and trolls of all sizes! We’ve watched you spend a month punching faces in the Rumble Run, and we think there’s room for some changes based on how things have gone. Here’s what’s new with the Rumble Run.
---
&gt;*Weighted Card Rewards*
---
&gt;We’ve increased the possibility of synergistic cards for your shrine appearing more often. One of our primary goals with this mode was to showcase the nine troll champions and have you really get to know them. We wanted you to “live the dream” of fighting in the Gurubashi Arena, and to do so, we had to make sure that each Run had its own strong theme. Adjusting the card bucket offerings for decks and re-adding bonus buckets will help strengthen that experience.
---
&gt;*Boss Deck Adjustments*
---
&gt;One of our design goals with the Rumble Run was to provide huge, overpowered combat. Balancing at such a high power level is a challenge. When it works, it works great. You get epic, monumental combat against overwhelming odds. But when it doesn’t work, it feels random and swingy – like when the AI pulls an overwhelming combo. And since no one likes being repeatedly hit in the face with a club, we’ve pruned some of the power from the boss decks so that your Runs will play out more moderately. We have a lot of data about which bosses have the biggest body counts, and we’ve used that to target the worst offenders. Rumble Runs are now a little easier, but more importantly, they’ll feel a little more fair.
---
&gt;*Shrine Selection Changes*
---
&gt;In early builds of the Rumble Run, we allowed players to pick a class and shrine before playing. What we found was that playtesters immediately picked their favorite class, gravitated to a certain shrine, and played that shrine repeatedly.
---
&gt;We had wanted to encourage players to try different shrines, especially to experiment with stuff they normally wouldn’t, so we put the current random shrine drafting in place. While that helped achieve our initial goal, it removed that feeling of mastery – the ability to choose a shrine and play with it until you feel you’ve mastered it or exhausted its possibilities.
---
&gt;So we want to bring that back. With this update, whenever you lose, you can expect to always be offered the shrine you just lost with. The shrine that the boss used to beat you in your last run will also be offered, per the status quo.
---
&gt;**Some Final Rumble Ruminations**
---
&gt;We always prefer to experiment, try extreme ideas, and get feedback rather than play it safe. In true troll fashion, we went big with the Rumble Run and tried some different ideas to give this expansion a unique feel and to capture the thrill of stepping into an arena against known opponents for some superpowered brutality. It’s wallop or be walloped in there, for better or for worse.
---
&gt;One of the things we experimented with—and heard great feedback on—was about the earlier pack rewards for the Rumble Run. Previous Hearthstone missions awarded packs via quests for completing content. For The Boomsday Project, we gave packs out without a quest to celebrate the launch of the expansion’s missions. This time around, we front-loaded the rewards and gave players three extra packs on launch day instead of during the Rumble Run. We felt that packs might be more interesting to people during the initial weeks of the expansion.
---
&gt;As many of you have pointed out, this decision just made the missions feel especially un-rewarding. It’s always more gratifying to earn packs by competing a quest, rather than just being given them. To this end, we’re adding the new quest described above, and going forward, we’ll keep this feedback in mind for the launch of new single-player content.
---
&gt;We had a ton of fun making mode and really appreciate the time that many of you took to write out thoughtful feedback. Everything we learn helps make future content better.
---
&gt;And now, it’s back to the Rumble Run!
---
Decklist?
---
Haha I had the quest to win three tavern brawls, then played a couple more just because. 
---
Should have been craft a custom zomtotembie
---
I hope we will see that soon.
---
i love what they did with Arena

It's in March or April because the hearthstone year ends after Worlds, which happens when the April-expansion comes around.

I super appreciate the context you added and the attention you guys paid to the Rumble Run experience and feedback. Nice work. 
---
THIIISSSSSSSSSS
---
I've had a similar thought to this, but you could even target it blocks between sets.
---
Something as simple as all Standard legal cards, plus all Dragon synergy cards are legal for 4 months.  It would make it a different meta from Standard, but not quite Wild.
---
I think the card pool is getting to a point where you need to have more constructed modes outside of Standard and Wild.
---
They're too busy making dungeon run for the 5th time as the single-player content.
---
&gt;  Justicar Trueheart is even, which seems like a big deal.
---
if only there was some way you could reliably get that upgraded power...
---
Plus wild is more free to play friendly long term.
---
Even decks like renolock has still been King for the longest time
---
Open format in MTG or unlimited in Shadowverse even in those games, the wild equivalent is much more fun
---
Oh my bad.  First time I'd seen the article.  Certainly no intent to "karma farm".  I can delete if necessary.
---
I think you overestimate the number of people who care about watching streamers. Hearthstone has what, 80 million accounts, and it caps at what, 40k viewers unless a huge tourney is on? It's the high ranking people that care about streams, the casuals don't. People love to overestimate the impact of their own group.
---
But it's not Secret Hunter because it doesn't run Secretkeeper and Subject 9, and Secret Hunter is also a more aggressive deck.
---
Hunter - Midrange/Beast
---
Priest - Innerfire
---
Mage - Tempo
---
Rogue - Tempo Pirates
---
Warrior - Aggro/Weapons Midrange
---
Shaman - Token/Midrange
---
Druid - Ramp Token
---
Warlock - Zoo
---
Paladin - Buff Midrange
---
In ranked mode, below legend rank, MMR is calculated but not used for matchmaking - the matches are based entirely on your star rank (relaxing things a little if queues times would be long). Though only new accounts are able to play at the lowest ranks, new players can still get a bunch of legendaries early on, so you will still see some people running decent decks in the 50-26 range. And pretty much anyone could get Whizzbang, which gives you a full constructed deck on its own (which are not amazing, but far better than basic decks). So there's a bit of luck involved just in who is at your rank; they'll all be new accounts but won't all have the same resources available.
---
Searched for hunter, no nerfs, didn't read.
---
Thank you for your quick feedback guys! &lt;3
---
I've just finished reading some articles and your responses and I think I'll just pass.
---
I don't want to have to crawl for months just to be able to barely pull off a solid win.
---
Don't get me wrong, its not hard,  but its not fun either; and fun is why we play games :(
---
I hope the new player experience changes at some point, but as it stands now, for a new player, no fun is to be had.
---
Cheers and hope you guys get your times worth!
---
Expected Microadjustments in arena
---
Massive changes and improvements to Rumble Run.
---
Thank you for listening to feedback
---
It's a nice sentiment but it just appears to be an unreasonable request for a digital card game. One of the largest shortcomings from the player side when they designed this damn game was to prevent transfer/trading, most likely to increase that bottom line for Blizzo. Super shitty and I hope your son appreciates the thought either way.
---
Of the 18 constructed brawls in 2018, eight of them included wild cards. But don't let that stop your clearly much needed jab at wild players who want to build decks too.
---
Not perfect, just better. As long as the AI isn't smarter than a pro player it's fair and you can learn from it.
---
It would also be weird because HS isn't like HotS where you can slow development and people won't get bored. Without constant new card sets a CCG dies very quickly. Just dumping the competitive scene in HS wouldn't save much money. They'd have to also slow down development of new sets. That would kill the game.
---

&gt;dude,blizzard CATERS to new players almost every single brawl. sometimes vets who have been playing since meta deserve to have some fun too. deal with it. i am bored every time its a standard brawl, but im not gonna whine about it either.

It got nerfed in Arena, sorta. If that counts. Definitely was needed. 
---
This can't bode well for the future of Hearthstone.
---
There is nothing proving this and you acting upon this just makes you far worse than she is portrayed.

In fact if you can read something like this on the internet and have thoughts of even contacting her I suggest you book yourself into a doctor for your own mental health check up because you are losing touch with reality.

Granted it’s only one side of the story but Gemma’s “jokes” were clearly racist and she was the one in the wrong even if they were exaggerated in the story.

Idk how much bad management and overwork factored into this, and again it’s only one side of story, but you can’t just victim blame a dude for being stereotyped. 
---
“Facetiously”? How the hell did you read that ? He planned to kill himself over this. Whether or not you believe him 100% or not why don’t you stop treating it 
---
Facetiously
---
Thank you for doing this!
---
if you put just one card in it'll fill the rest of the deck for you. i did that and got my pack. 
---
This brawl sucks anyway. The only thing you're missing out on is one classic pack. 
---
Glad to see them improve the Rumble Run experience. I started enjoying it more once I adjusted to the crap factor, but it really gave a terrible first impression. Can't wait to grind out the rest of the Shrines.
---
I agree to an extent but the problem with mental health issues is you often don't know you have mental health issues ... everyone is to blame! That's the mindset you end up with.

---
I guess the lack of time for a few months. Also, given the nature of a card game, at its very core this game involves a lot of luck, if you are facing some veterans coming back after a break you can easily get stuck on a certain rank for days if you don't have enough time - especially in a rock-paper-scissors meta like this.
---
Try crafting a cheap deck which is viable, odd paladin/hunter decks might not be the most sophisticated ones, but quite strong and good at going up the ladder
---
If you only play 2 out of the 7 expansions/adventures available in wild, is it fair to characterize yourself as a "wild player?"
---
(I know, I'm probably [gatekeeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/).)
---
I want a survey about Standard and Wild, because I am really hoping they reconsider allowing Classic. It's really killing enjoyment of the game when every deck has to start with the best classic cards, then whatever is better than those cards. Each rotation, I would just love if I didn't have the exact same pool of cards to compare the new ones too, and instead could compare them to other new cards.
---
" Where we going Papa Blizzard ? "
---
Hearthstone has one of the best and fairest free to play models in the entire gaming industry. Have you ever played a card game before? This game allows you to have practically every tier 1 deck at no-cost. I don't get people like you. Also, if you don't play wild and disenchant all your useless cards you pretty much never have to pay a dime for anything. Throw them a couple of bucks each expansion and you're good to go. Do you not have a job?
---
Blizzard would need to be interested in having their staff put 100+ hours into a game for that to be a thing. Lowest effort for maximum profit has been their MO since the Warcraft days. 
---
I feel like this shows off the mechs well. I'm getting a ton of value off EMP operative, which is usually terrible. So that's pretty fun.
---
Too many brawls like this would be awful though. I only have the new expansions and it makes it hard to be competitive.
---
Golden portraits mean nothing 
---
I was thinking the same thing. This is the first brawl i wanted to keep playing in a long time, but i couldn't bring myself to do it without some type of ladder or tournament reward.
---
I just cant understand why the dev team cant be more transparent about what's going on. Did Druid die because of salty players or is there actual support coming to help Druid post rotation? If you drop tournaments will there be a tournament mode organized by players available? Will Wild ever get actual support with balance changes? Reverted nerfs? Wild shop?

Im on mobile, and was loading the img through reddits internal browser. I get pretty decent speeds on my mobile data.. 
---
I believe this meme is of the Shirvallah OTK, where you shuffle Shirvallahs into your deck with Baleful Banker and then draw them with Holy Wrath for massive face damage.
---
Ya, you're right :/
---
That was my best guess, it seems decent for just maintaining board control.  Do you know if Shellfighter absorbs damage from aoe affecting adjacent minions?
---
this game has never been free-to-play on the competitive level (actually neither way below that), it can be translated basically to a monthly subscription fee if you want to have all the decks - if not, you can save up enough gold for one for sure, can't see the problem
---
&gt;&gt;In early builds of the Rumble Run, we allowed players to pick a class and shrine before playing. What we found was that playtesters immediately picked their favorite class, gravitated to a certain shrine, and played that shrine repeatedly.
---
What the fuck? Basically, you found that players wanted to have fun with **single player content** the way they wanted to have fun with it, and you said "well screw them, not on my watch!" and then deliberately hamstrung the mode so that people were forced to not have as much fun.
---
Do you ever think about using your knowledge/skillset from those years for a project of your own? Not as a job or anything, just for fun. I’m sure there’s a lot of cool things you can do with a deep knowledge of AI (hey, you could even make a better Hearthstone AI opponent!)
---
Does this mean you adjusted the imbalanced life totals (late into the run) and card counts in the opponent's deck  (early run)? Since they have access to the same treasure cards this time (unlike the other "Run" style SP content) it's only fair they not get a massive HP advantage or a bigger deck.
---
So if I completed Rumble Run on the current difficulty it's the same card back reward as this new and easier difficulty? I feel like a Kobold who's had his candle taken.
---
I have the exact same feeling. Trying to win with all the shrines could really be an interesting challenge ! Hopefully, they will just make a slight change and show the winning shrines.
---
&gt;Imagine if there was a thread for every reply a dev made to a thread outside of the thread the reply was made in.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There were plenty in that thread alone, it's just unnecessary.
---
i agree with u on that but this comment is especial because it's talking about what they are possibly planing in the future of Solo-content mode
---
Some people did experiment with it but yeah as terrorforge said, you don't really want to wipe your board out as playing big minions is your win condition, and as far as clearing smaller minions, you already have defile, hellfire and taunts to do so.  Basically shadowflame improves you vs "token decks" which, with the exception of midrange hunter perhaps, evenlock already performs well against.
---
Did you opt in to blizzard emails?  I think you need to be getting there monthly newsletters to get this
---
What about the imbalanced life totals (late into the run) and card counts in the opponent's deck (early run)? Since they have access to the same treasure cards this time (unlike the other "Run" style SP content) it's only fair they not get a massive HP advantage or a bigger deck.
---
And my counter to you, is that you are no professional yourself on this matter.
---
We were all emotional regarding what happened to someone and I think we've all already moved past this. As many have stated and I have also discussed and agreed with, it is one person's side of the story and there's more to things than meets the eye.
---
Many have reacted to this emotionally including myself. I have done nothing, will be doing nothing, and if you're offended by what I've said then I apologize.
---
You just described a huge part of this sub and I thank you for that.
---
I pretty much expected that :). 
---
I think the reason you where downvoted might have been the tone, or that it came across as quite extreme, even though you intended to present only the other side. 
---
Written language is often unprecise like that. 
---
Anyways i did not downvote you in case you wonder. 
---
Thank you for the nice response. 
---
Welcome to new Blizzard. Activision is forcing them to cut costs. Now they are coming for the competitive scene for all of thier games. Feels great. Wonder if they will axe vanilla wow at this point.
---
It was an emotional reaction and I've moved past it as well as many others have as well. 
---
Basically, everyone is playing Mech.
---
You're right in that the changes definitely impact the people who want to win over and over again with the same shrine in favor of encouraging people to try to play with lots of different shrines. This time around we thought the latter was more important for more people.
---
I'm not sure we'd make the same decision again; we definitely want to experiment with each release and get lots of feedback. The early feedback we had indicated people had more fun when they were trying lots of different shrines and different builds, so we leaned into it for Rumble Run. 
---
Hey there friend
---
3 main reasons are that it's built on a very old version of unity. It's constantly streaming data. Card art takes up a lot of memory.
---
This has been posted many times and yep still agree with it though it does make that mode more heavily p2w arguably.
---
It’s rather nice, I missed some old cards, but the classic and nasic cards are waaaay to core to be able to build a decent deck
---
This is almost exactly the deck I've been using this brawl, only difference is I use flame jugglers instead of scalehides and a second kodo instead of replicating menace. I do miss ice walkers and the spirit though, you get to feel like an adventure boss if those two stick.
---
No one wants it to be perfect, just good enough that they feel smart when they beat it. When the AI does stupid or nonsensical things it just takes a lot of the fun and satisfaction out of a game.
---
Yep, that's arcane tracker. Pretty damn useful if you ask me, considering i only play on my phone.
---
I have a golden paladin, but that’s because my dad and I tag team our account. I’m only in rank twenty, and I also have never played paladin
---
Compare to: https://hsreplay.net/cards/#set=TROLL
---
Baited Arrow heavily underrated. Daring Fire-Eater and Pyromaniac pretty underrated. Da Undatakah really overrated. :(
---
This seems like a connectivity bug that may or may not be related to the patch. Have you restarted the client and reconnected? Curious if anyone else is seeing connectivity issues since this morning's rollout.
---
Almost cried the first time it happened to me, he did only have a 50/50 chance of getting it though.
---
0-3
---
Then boy do I have the list for you!
---
Since Boom was revealed I've been excited (then and now) to do this exact thing. It wins about 60% of the games, but damn son, I just like control warrior and greedy value

I run it at 1080p on a 2017 Macbook Pro and it runs like a champ.
---
My biggest problem with the rumble run was you always had a worse deck than the bosses at the late stages of a run just simply due to the fact that yours was basically randomized by what you get in buckets. I'm glad they are fixing the balance of both the bosses decks and the bucket synergy.
---
I'm amused that Blizzard admits to trolling the players in an official post:
---
&gt;In true troll fashion, we went big with the Rumble Run \[...\]
---
/s
---
You mean the Riots Games case that involved one of the founders/CEOs making rape jokes in front of the entire company?
---
Totally the same thing.
---
getting mana screwd is really rare (bo3) compared to the rng fiesta that hs is
---
Do you mean something that tells you which card to play from your hand? I hope not
---
Do you mean which cards from your collection to add to a deck? Hearthpwn and hsreplay both have apps to help you netdeck
---
After 30min worth of buffs for Lynessa I would lose my will as well
---
I couldn't stop.  Someone came into my room and broke my focus freeing me me
---
Wait - you're saying that Blizzard records which shrines we've beaten Rumble Run with? Is there a possibility this information can be accessible through the Client's UI?
---
I did it with something similar to this priest deck, but used Mossy Horror instead of Shadow Word: Horror for his Frostmorne turn. The rest is all basic cards to there's tons of room for improvement.
---
[https://imgur.com/OHLfFGj](https://imgur.com/OHLfFGj)
---
Yes. This. This is easily the best brawl Blizz has ever done.
---
You win. Immune doesn't stop untargetable enemy hero destruction.
---
Sweeeeet! Any replacements for starseeker and Sneed? 
---
Big Dick Packs
---
Thats not what hes asking for. He wants a bot to tell him what card to play each time he needs to decide. He need to change hobbies. basic decision making is not for him.
---
I feel like the graph for Need to spend money to stay Competitive and the one for Need to spend in order to have Fun should prolly be switched. I’ve seen many ppl come to the defense that you can play meta decks for very cheap-free even, but FUN? Not unless your content with every card you’ve ever opened and ever crafted. Which I highly doubt is the case with most ppl and prolly why so many ppl watch people like Toast and Kibler.
---
Doesn't matter, it only lasts one month, and it's just for fun. 
---
Karma whoring at its worst
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/adz68t/nobody_beats_rikkar_100_times_in_a_row_nobody/
---
It looks like a rip-off attempt of this post
---
Ceiling at 25. If you make it to 15 ever, then the ceiling becomes 20.
---
Someone else, this guy is just trying to karma whore, it seems
---
Damn, someone thinks their rank means they don't have to try to get a win.  What a jerk.  
---
Just curious, but how much do you play? I also am a F2P wild player but I still usually manage to get about 40 packs of each expansion just through doing quests every day or two.
---
76.8 warrior 4-3. Greedy deck and got overrun?
---
This is not uncommon and his rank really isn’t that impressive. Wild mode is actually a lot easier to climb to higher ranks as opposed to standard, that’s just how it is.
---
Unfortunately you will just come to understand what sort of games would likely have p*ssed your opponent off. Then if you receive an immediate friend request it might be better to ignore it.
---
What's a computer?
---
whats the pity timer?
---
I like how winning only one entire run already earns one the cardback, but future runs don't really offer anything else. After the KOTFT adventure unlocked Arthas, I kind of wanted to see Rikkar being unlocked as a reward for clearing the Rumble Run with each loa/class.
---
What do you think? It seems like Rikkar is already a full-fledged hero. Will we see him again outside of the Rumble Run?
---
Surprised nobody else has mentioned the fact that "None of the above" is there twice on the promotions question. Seems a rather silly oversight for Blizzard to make.
---
Completely useless decks 
---
It'd make sense if it was a pack from what the content is based on but yeah it's probably a classic pack. I could see either way though. 
---
They don't know what you won with prepatch. It starts fresh as of today. 
---
Hmmmmm different usernames also different pictures, i dont know what to tell ya bud its a huge coincidence
---
Punny
---
In Tournaments, yes. And that's the intended gameplay by design.
---
Doesn't mean we haven't tried all types of crazy stuff with some opaque card backs at home, tho.
---
HS on my mobile is almost a slideshow during every big animation. And my phone is not that old and sliw.
---
I have all nine, because when I first started playing, I wasn't very good at climbing ladder but I had the time to play a lot of games.
---
Hunter was the first, and I got it because it was very fast, so I won two games, lost two games all the way to Rank 15.
---
Warlock was the last, it was during Un'goro, when Warlock was dumpster, and I did it by playing 1000 Questlock games in Wild over a three-month period.
---
So nobody should feel intimidated when facing a Golden Hero, or a Legend cardback. The first just means they've played the class a lot, which doesn't mean they're good at it. The second means they reached Legend once, but it could have been four years ago. What matters is that they're the same rank as you, which means that right now, they're the same as you.
---
If your unlucky like me when you open 39 packs without a legendary you have a 100% chance to get one meaning I opened 40 packs and got 1 legendary and I am now at 35 packs after that. Meaning I am extremely unlucky.
---
The artist is happy to know you like it! 
---
But that means that, say it’s the Secret or the Divine Shield or the Armor Mana one, you have to beat the entire run to get it basically.
---
You get a golden portrait even if you're not good, but played for a long time (so you got enough wins). It means they're just playing longer than you HS. It doesn't tell you anything about their quality (only quantity).
---
Have had HS installed for 4 years or so on my HDD, uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, never had any issues
---
As many other people suggested, having a new format with random sets each month would be a fantastic addition to the game. Considering they've been listening to the community recently, it wouldn't surprise me if this Brawl was a test to see how the community would react to such a format.
---
Not everyone want to explore what can be done within the confine of the brawl's rule.
---
Heartharena.com. Input is entirely manual but can be as simple as win total or as detailed as class faced and coin/first. 
---
Or "whenever your opponent equips a weapon, reduce that weapon's durability to 1"
---
I think op is just using random article to indirectly gain view for the betting website. Today, he posted one directly promoting it as betting website.
---
So fucking what? I don't give a fuck if nobody plays it. Just because it's under represented and doesn't have a circle jerk like control warrior does, doesn't make the argument less valid.
---
The combo works, just because it sucks across the field doesn't make the combo less combo. 
---
With that stupid reasoning, OP shouldn't complain either if his deck magically had lower win rate, because all of sudden ( it's normal for a bad deck to lose?)
---
On my pc hearthstone tries to run in double resolution which tanks the performance. I would check that if this is an issue for it. Other than that I am not sure why this is an issue, the game seems to be poorly optimized overall :/
---
Yeah that makes sense. I myself dont play super tryhard either, though I have played consistently and that has helped my card acquisition. It also helps that I play exclusively control and then only Priest/Paladin/Mage/Warrior, so I've been able to dust some other classes' cards to solidify the base there.
---
Copying a 3 year old deck makes you so much more original than copying a current one.  I'm sure that typing 'mech' into the search bar took all your mental abilities.
---
Unfortunately only the first sentence was /s.
---
It's random. The only controllable aspect is if the horseman it would generate is on the board, it creates a different horseman instead.
---
I play wild so I would keep any good legendary but I would dust bad ones (Moroes, Maexxna, etc.). 
---
Maybe, but there are a lot of weapons that would do nothing on or even help. At least a higher percentage compared to minions with stuff like Explosive Runes and Snipe.
---
It's not a joke and you're simply defending a lack of clarity as though it were a feature. I'm glad that you don't mind parsing icons in the sidebar to puzzle out what the posting is talking about, but that doesn't mean that the rest of us should feel happy about being required to do so when a few words are all that's required. 
---
People like the OP.  Mech mage is hardly an original concept.
---
The saved money will never be put into improving the game. This is Blizzard cutting costs.
---
Yea I got the 19.99 value pack in december and opened 30 with no legendary...so I feel you 
---
Unity
---
That's not dissimilar from my own setup other than that I'm running an i7. I suppose you could try reinstalling it as some are suggesting. 
---
The technology isn't there yet. 
---
i still play chess. i think the last balance patch came before my parents even met. 
---
I expect Blizzard to Hall of Fame Baku and Genn either at rotation or very soon afterward.
---
Baku and Genn decks are already problematic for the meta.
---
The ones that don't lose anything significant at rotation (work it out) will go beyond problematic into meta-warping territory.
---
They either see that now or they see it when it happens, but they can't ignore it.
