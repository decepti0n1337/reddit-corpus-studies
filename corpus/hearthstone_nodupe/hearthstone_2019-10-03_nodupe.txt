Damn man that top comment.

He/she is a good person.

i have finished every single adventure in the heroic mode, and one of the reasons i did that was to prove myself i could do something nearly impossible, to laugh about my friends that couldnt do it, because it was legit hard! for example, many tried to defeat toki and even after 999 tries they couldnt do it, and the ones who could felt proud about that. Now in tombs of terror is just a matter of time, you can be UTTER TRASH NOOB, if you keed trying you are eventually going to win, even if you only remove 1 health poing from the plage lord per try... so, i aint going to wast my time in something ANYONE can do it...
---
Shit yes! I kept thinking it doesn‚Äôt feel right, then u described it perfectly!
---
Hope to see an updated version from OP
---
‚ÄúYes?
---
Arrgghh. For the last time, I‚Äôm a DREADLORD, not a DRUGLORD!!‚Äù
---
That was my otk too
---
Rank 25 play.
---
I've found this to be very strong:
---
\-Daring Fire-Eater
---
\-Novice Engineer
---
\-Ancient Mysteries
---
\-Khadgar
---
\-Ice Block
---
\-Jan'alai, the Dragonhawk
---
I think that the forced normal mode can fairly easily be argued for : it's an interactive tutorial. The idea is that by forcing players to play normal mode before heading into Heroic, you let them interact with every single game mechanic once before putting additional challenges on top of it. 
---
However, there are a few issues with that explanation. First, as some people mentioned, defeating the plague lord will often take more than one run, especially when you begin. So you're actually forced to discover that mechanic a few times before you're able to unlock the challenging mode.
---
Another one is how unlocks are the same in both modes, but requires to be unlocked independently. This also means that you have to "discover the mechanics" again.
---
It was tried before by getting 39 packs with  no legendary card and open a golden one. you don‚Äôt always get a legendary.
---
Oh god, you got me
---
Owned in both senses.
---
What is this combo? I couldn't tell what the buff card was or the target. I know what the priest card that reduces spell cost is tho.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see more!
---
1st thing i built was that but with Mogu Cultist instead of Grave Horror. Luckily I played against a crappy paladin deck because what i imagined did not work: couldnt manage hand size with low mana and when I did have 7 cultist in hand i had to kill off 2 radiants first, didn't get the combo off until turn 9 ;(
---
Did somebody say boom?
---
Definitely not the best deck but I‚Äôve been running Elemental Evocation, Zephrys, Book of Specters, Zilliax, Reno, and Siamat. Basically mulligan for ele evo and Zephrys and let him carry early game.  Reno for clears, siamat for threats, and Zilliax for healing
---
Grave Horror instead of Divine is much better.
---
Reflection on the spiders. Duh. Why would you not do that. The enemy just concedes when they see that.
---
Elise is already used in normal quest druid decks (regular and Maly). Her effect is a refuel or a combo enabler later in the game. Key in mirror and control matches. Getting 4 Nomis vs a control warrior is clutch; getting 4 Zephyrs is also insanely powerful. I think Elise is a great card even if the deck isn't highlander
---
 This is not a dress. It's the standard Dreadlord uniform!
---
Can confirm that it works.
---
How many treasures did you have?
---
I have all for Reno, missing two for brann and Finley, and I have none for elise
---
I‚Äôve only faced decks that seem like they need 6 or more turns to win. They haven‚Äôt.
---
How did you get crab at the final boss?
---
No you only get banned if cards say SN1P-SN4P on them)
---
Most Grave Horrors I've had out on turn 3 is 3. The Embalm-PWS-Topsy combo only draws one card at a time, so it needs to cycle six cards for each Horror. Even with my quickest efforts it's hard to cycle enough to get more than a couple Horrors each turn.
---
Still hard to answer though, esp when you have drawn extra Embalms and can toss them on your Horrors/Radiants as well to counter boardclear.
---
This deck is so dirty.. I hate losing to it
---
it's just so simple...
---
In Standard, yes. In Wild, no. Standard mage got hit hard with the nerfs as most of the decks revolved around Conjurers and PG.
---
Wild is an entirely different story, as Secret Mage is one of the top decks right now. Reno mage is also pretty good thanks inclusions luke the new Reno and Zephyrs (then again, Zephyrs can make any deck better).
---
So, overall, if you wanna play mage, go to Wild.
---
Just play RuneScape
---
You realize a lot about the state of Diablo when people post screens from it in Hearthstone sub.
---
What is APM? I've been getting about 2 Horrors (which have taunt) on turn 2 pretty consistently. Also, Radiant Elemental is the card I don't have access to btw because I have only been playing for about a week.
---
Yeah it sucked big time. I had to use the hp on a cultist to even get one ra turn 20 or so. My new list doesn't run Time Out,  
---
Righteous Protector  
---
Crystology  
---
Sir Finley (Can be replaced, but he's fun)  
---
Zephrys  
---
Novice Engineer  
---
Not I Cultist
---
Would've needed to go to 4472 for 10 mil.
---
This deck is quite literally unbeatable. It is the definition of unfairness and should be banned straight up. I have never advocated for a banned deck but this is literally unbeatable and unfair beyond the stars themselves. Their turn will literally keep going after it ended for a solid 2 minutes and its fucking ridiculous and I hate conceding to such a scummy piece of shit who plays this deck but I cannot stand it and almost makes the mode unplayable by how common it is already.
---
It's T4 actually (look at the latest VS report).
---
Post again after
---
APM = Actions per minute
---
But yeah, some brawls dont favour new players cause you have to create a deck. If they just gave you all the cards it wouldnt incentivise you to spend money on the game (Not speaking for or against it, just rationalizing what they're doing)
---
Kibler, is that you?
---
Did you check all 3 regions? Maybe you switched at one point accidentally
---
Play him again
---
Ah, thanks! Do you like it more because of the variety?
---
Buff is Earthen scales used on Jr. Navigator (which gives you back 2 of those buff cards = an infinite supply).
---
Wait, do you have a source for that? Every source I‚Äôve ever heard says that it shares a timer
---
I was calculating all kinds of possibilities but after I accidentally used the Spirit Lash and it messed up the numbers I just went full braindead spam mode and didn't care anymore.
---
Three wins is where you start to break even with the entrance cost, and a pack and forty-five gold is only a loss of five.
---
In order to really start profiting from Arena, you'll need to start getting at least six wins, and seven is when you start getting the entry fee back.
---
Nice gonk, but was the attack on the last minion necessary?
---
Favorite card of the set
---
There is an audience for competitive Yoyo, you know?
---
Jesus christ, that would've taken me about 3 hours. What is the math behind that btw?
---
&gt;"oh wow, you mean the deck was stacked against you so I won? boy howdy is that fun".
---
You mean Arena? Part of the fun all card games is making due with the cards you have.
---
Glad I didn't dust High Priestess Jeklik. She's the star of this thing.
---
I actually am really sad whenever I get a premade deck to play with instead of using the rule set to create fun stuff and try different things.
---
Made a pogohopper primary jade shuriken secondary deck. Went pretty well
---
if you were around when it was hall of famed, you could get it for free by crafting it before the rotation.
---
When it is not your turn and they keep making you draw cards..........
---
i weren't. also real smooth guys downvote cause pays.
---
I'm aware, but usually the threat to getting milled is the fatigue damage. You get your deck refilled so how did you take fatigue?
---
Odds are, standard players dust their HOF cards.
---
It doesnt refill once you have a large enough hand. It's dumb
---
'Oh it is another check hearthpwn brawl'
---
You don‚Äôt need a perfect mulligan if you have:
---
Glacial shard
---
Book of specters
---
Doomsayer 
---
Zephrys the Great
---
Ice block
---
Reno Jackson
---
Skull of the manari and voidlord
---
Oh sure yeah I'd rather have another encounter at the crossroads for the umpteenth time or other RaNdOm cArDs wohoa so wacky because the team couldn't be arsed to come up with a decent deckbuilding brawl.
---
cracklover#1683 na, you first
---
It's hard control if you consider turn 5 the lategame ü§î
---
Dude, what about the Leper Gnome???
---
Now Reno can finally use his machine gun wand
---
I wont let jt go for anything less than 6 and a hot dog.
---
Well aside from the decks that were too broken and got nerfed e.g. Naga giants
---
It's a deck in wild already.
---
Zephrys, both Reno's, 1 mana twinfreeze, doomsayer, arcane intellect. Easiest game of my life.
---
it's already a deck on wild
---
Great vid dude, definitely deserves an upvote haha. :)
---
VS is pretty accurate since they use real data for their reports.
---
It can be potentially fun when it happens, but as others said, Sorcerers isn't that common, depends on the board.
---
Guess people don't like finding out they actually are bad at the game.
---
&gt;Make a six-card deck and duel! Don't worry -- when you're out of cards you get a free reload!
---

---
turn 5 their best play is oaken summons after hero powering or using spellstone in the turns before
---
Wild jade druid is NOT a midrange deck by any means.
---
Was tempted to, just to reset my hero power and fish for spells
---
*mercenery 14 - for Europe
---
Nice writeup - but Wild is quite the mess.  Basically every deck in Wild is ridiculously powerful and polarizing, including the ones I play.  For example, look at secret mage.  Its fucking stupid.  You cant do anything against that deck except hammer their face fast.  Any other deck....and yer DEAD.   Against any Reno deck if you are playing aggro or even midrange....yer DEAD.   Then, you have the "joy" of Guldan/NZoth decks, Priest resurrect bull shit, Huntard mechs, etc, etc.
---
Standard is boring with nothing but Quest deck horse shit but Wild is so borken its almost unplayable.
---
Hey, welcome to HS mate.
---
I tend to find that Malygos works very well with Druid (and even Rogue at times) so it's worth looking as those options too. A good way of doing this is a quick search of "budget malygos decks" on Google. 
---
However, having a quick look online, I found this one for you:
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/budget-malygos-druid-deck-shadows-may-2019
---
Unfortunately I can't comment on how effective this deck would even be, Malygos decks are not my strong point, but perhaps a starting point depending on what other cards you may have received?
---
Good luck mate
---
On average, every 6 spells, you will draw an auctioneer which does not cycle.  
---
At the same time you get 2 extra mana from project and innervate, while only using one on scales, so manawise you get one mana per 6 cards.  
---
Casting a second auctioneer however will probably lead to you taking fatigue damage I guess, so all you can do is play X cycles where X is the number of cards in your hand after you played auctioneer. before your hand is only unplayable auctioneers.  
---
On the play (with the turn 3 project and turn 4 auctioneer) that means: 5 cycles = 5 damage to their face and 5+6+7+8+9 = 35 armor.  
---
Considering that the coin is basically a redraw that means going second you get 7 cycles = 7x Moonfire and 35+10+11 = 56 armor.
---
4 mana 7/7
---

---
How‚Äôd u get the bars on top of the words?
---
Thank you bro!
---
deck doesn't reload when you burn cards
---
And as I have told you before, that definition is wrong and thats why we started this dialoge to begin with. You also said to the first commenter that he didnt understood you with his comment in wich he assumed you used "broken" as the "resources dont matter" meaning. Hence all this discussion.
---
And again, as I and others have told you, its still wrong even if that was the definition, because resources do matter a lot in the wild format, just not in the same way that it does in standard.
---
There's heavy RNG involved in some of the bosses. Not everyone who failed to one shot Plague lords is bad. Get your head out of your ass.
---
And what have you actually achieved other than a big number?

So, I am from Belarus, and really wondering, what what the thought process about leaving us behind? Saving a few 100.000$, they got from us buying packs? Seriously, I was so happy this tournament came back, I loved the last Global Games, and now I'm so angry, because blizzard thought "Yeah, Belarus? Not so important, let's cut them off, save some $, and some time, nobody will care anyway!"
---
This is fantastic. Nice work!
---
Exactly right - they lose more than they gain with this move!
---
I‚Äôm sure reading hurting your head isn‚Äôt an uncommon experience
---
No you're fine. This op is dumb. Reno Mage is fun to play with really rewarding lines of play so stick with it imo

---
Wow! I absolutely adore the recruit board/map and the alliance/horde crossout graffiti. Awesome stuff!
---
totally correct - my bad. so given no taunts it is 15 (play) and 21 (coin) damage. ...given how popular topsy priest seems to be, you probably have to kill ~10 taunts first though.

I agree 100% about reno decks, but to be fair, the entirety of wild ladder is 66% someone getting blown out and 33% mirrors since wild is hyper polarized
---
Really? I must have missed it, thanks!
---
Oh I didn't know normal counted for both in that case.
---
We did both. We gave everyone a two weeks heads up and some instructions to get them through the tutorials. For anyone who didn‚Äôt do this, we had a few devices/accounts for them to rotate through. 
---
I‚Äôd say it was about 50/50 for the 15-18 kids that showed up.
---
As someone who has played since 2014 and loves the Single Player content, I enjoyed it but I'm getting a bit tired of Dungeon Run campaigns. The choice of a strong card to add to your deck is nice, but the Plague Lords are pretty boring and monotonous fights. 
---
I'm looking forward to reading the quarterly report that's released next month to see how the expansion performed relative to Boomsday to get a sense of how popular this expansion was.
---
Thanks! :D

---
&gt; I really don't have a problem with you sometimes losing games to a Reno. 
---
Especially since if they actually committed to board, reno doesnt answer the board so they can put the damage right back to face
---
as for your analysis of big priest I disagree in the same way that quest rogue at it's peak only had a 48-52% winrate despite being one of the strongest decks
---
There are three murlocs in this picture

Why?

At least at 5 mana, the bright side is that leeroy fits into baku decks, well, most baku decks are aggro too (maybe except odd warrior and odd mage, but for odd mage there‚Äôs an aggro version as well which is worth running leeroy in).

That is, if you do play wild. Haha

---
Thanks for asking
---
Well put for how I felt about it! And although the unlocking of hero powers/treasures isn't entirely new, that also added to the sense of progression so it wasn't bad if I lost
---
Take on of your better heroes in a run. Smash the run till you get the PL down to 50ish hp or less without killing him. Then concede and take the hero you're trying to unlock the navs on.
---
YoU cAnT tReAt AnImAls LiKe ThAt
---
Ah I see, I forgot you were killing him from full. I'll take your word that he doesn't have any plagues of deaths in phase 1, but he definitely gets them at some point in the encounter. I remember building up a huge board before moving him to phase 2 in heroic, and he immediately plague of deathed me. I do agree that twisting is usually better for him, particularly with shitty AI casting plague of death at bad times.
---
Alternatively, was your fight in normal or heroic? That might be another reason for differences in decks.
---
dump the broodmother, add expired merchant.
---
Totally the opposite for me. I really enjoyed that the final boss was just one longer but epic battle and not a tedious grind like the Plague Lords 1-4. I really felt great finishing it on heroic and didn't got this **"phew finally it's over"** feeling like with Heroic Dalaran heist.
---
I really hope they keep the bosses similar to Tombs of Terror!
---
No, I would rather have the ability to craft/have access to the same cards that I am competing with.

Escpially with Uldum quests, since thye give hero powers. and im just in general not fan of perma destroy /disable hero power,certain cards from hand/deck(aslo not fan of rat style eiter i get right and basicly win or i dont and i loose cause i pulled a ragnaros on turn 3 or something)
---
Im more fan of zihi/loatheb style,or mind breaker it disables but when minion is gone its back.
---
Flippin awesome!
---
Blizcon is November 1st, they should announce the next expansion and offer the preorders then. Given how close it is I doubt we'll see another sale this expansion
---
Awesome!!!
---
Drawing/not drawing your treasures just makes a huge difference. Of course, unlocking more helps, but even then you can brick and in that case you are pretty fucked (considering the base deck isn't anything special and you have no passive treasures).
---
wheres the BEEER
---
Trading 80g EU, you go first Kingiedingie#2711

Edit: done
---
&gt; I don't know, I tried a few times and got whupped on heroic. How many treasures have you unlocked? I've only the first got the 4 for each, and not even all the hero powers, and certainly no upgraded treasures.
---
Ignore the boasting. Heroic final boss involves quite a bit of luck like all heroic bosses. If you don't get the needed treasures he steamrolls your whole team without much you can do about it. Maybe OP just rolled lucky and got an exodia combo or just the right pieces at the right time and it felt too easy for him, but on average it isn't easy.
---
Why have both shadowstep and daring escape? That‚Äôs a little greedy. Maybe replace shadowstep with sap. I‚Äôve run into a few ‚Äúdivine shield taunt‚Äù decks and sap ruins them.

---

---
In other words you‚Äôre probably fucked
---
Today I made the craziest deck I've personally built before.
---
Sr. Tomb Diver with the Secrets deck which has exactly three secrets. Then I win against the first boss and get VIP Membership. On the second boss, I just farm as many Hearthstones as I can get over and over again until I get Subject 9. I add that to my deck and cast Right Hand Man on it. I continue farming Hearthstones until my entire deck consists of Sr. Tomb Divers, one Subject 9 and an Elven Minstrel. For added flair, I got an Echoes of Medivh always starting in my hand. I went to that damn Tavern so often that all of my cards cost 0. Then you steamroll the rest of the run while kicking back, with Turn 1 activated Sr. Tomb Diver on every single boss.
---
Took me a while but it was fun. In the end I had like 10 Treasure Crab dudes aswell and the Elixir that shuffles copies of your played minions into your deck. I had turn 6 lethal on the final boss.

The OTK Mill combo is just pure evil.
---
I'm both fascinated and horrified by it.  I think I'll try it out on a few more poor souls to see if I can solidify my position on it.
---
Can you be offered the same passive treasure you already have later in a run?
---
I disagree. It's still good, but the same final boss every time is repetitive and takes away half the fun. 
---
Also not a fan of the health persisting thing. It doesn't feel like an accomplishment when you win but it's the 3rd run and you've been whittling his health down. 
---
If the next one is just dungeon run again I'm out except the free part.

As a 12 year old who plays with his dad and has been playing since naxxramas I would like to know if anyone here around my age would be down to play?
---
Great finisher for miracle rogue. My favorite was still a stealthed [Mana Addict] and stealthed gadgetzan auctioneer, if you could keep those on the board you could smack the opponent in the face for 30

Can I adopt you as my new father?
---
This one might just work, yeah.
---
Why don't you just leave it like this? 10/10, would live in

Dude its beautiful hopes your son appreciates it as much as reddit does

Maxwell found a lady Maxwell and now his entire income goes to the child support of five little Maxwell‚Äôs.
---
Ah, if she was intentionally removed from the Zephrys pool then that makes a lot of sense then! I'll consider this as a learning moment for me and for anyone finishing up the Tombs of Terror
---
Confirmed coming back then :)
---
Thanks for making this video. Very entertaining!
---
And then, at the end of my turn...
---
Still not as bad as that fucker with the passive ‚Äúgive all minions +1/+1 every time **any** Discover card is played‚Äù who also runs a zoo deck.
---
you definitely just blizzard and ping face for the turn pictured
---
Because it's a game, and it can be fun! Even if a certain goal or achievement has already been completed before
---
Flo can help farm gnobliterators for turn 1 win against final boss.
---
Combining this find with the VIP Membership would guarantee one of Bob's Bombastic Decks! This is a great find. Gotta go with the Flo!
---
The tracker is the hunter class hero in the witch wood solo adventure :)
---
yes, thnaks,
---
It's for the monster hunt solo adventure i think.
---
I have this problem. I have one rando on my list who isn't on much but who really enjoys playing properly and chatting about the game with me (exactly what Blizzard was hoping for)
---
 ...and 20 others who never respond to requests to play for 80g
---
That's hilarious
---
Looks fucking epic

Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

I have never defeated her in 6 fights on heroic. I have no idea what the problem is but I just can‚Äôt do it. She‚Äôs killed several runs that could have destroyed a plague lord

I think the hall of fame move was simpler than that, Odd and Even decks had been the mainstay for multiple expansions, it felt like the game wasn't changing because every match started the same way. A big part of the standard experience is that the game changes quickly and often, it feels new. Baku and Genn were too powerful and consistent and prevented them from keeping the format fresh.
---
Removing them was good for standard, I just think the move wasn't good for wild.
