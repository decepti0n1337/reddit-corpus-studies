Not to mention that by the point in the game Omega Assembly is played you USUALLY are in Boom Form, which means the rover has rush and so does the token.

 I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Aya  Blackpaw. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child  bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing  that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her  birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance  to get Aya Blackpaw pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I  can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Blizzard  create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in  our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.

I don't think this is a mistake. Its nice that there's an easy button since its a good way for people to get resources.

---
For those who want a challenge, they can try Hagatha or Lazul. They don't all have to be the same or balanced. Think of it is an Easy, Medium, Hard mode.
---
So when you see a turn 7 linecracker you immediately waste everyhting on it because the opponent MIGHT be able to kill you? I'm sure that works out just fine
---
if this is satire it's very well done. i barely skimmed the text but i don't think i could make a more hilariously bad deck if i tried.
---
The first boss isn't hard for Shaman.  It's an easy blow out, 1 mana 2 use per turn Evolve is busted as hell if played correctly.
---
He should've been named Beta Devastator. That's a great name.
---
When heist first came out I took a few tries to do a run where the killing blow of each boss had to be an improvised explosive or bomb from deck
---
Seeing how powerful the warrior hero power is here, I'm now trying to do a run where 100% of face damage is from bombs alone

Who cares though? The card backs have no value. You can't sell them or trade them or whatever else.
---
And I say this as someone who has every card back possible apart from the ones you had to pay an absurd amount for (like huge set preorders) - I keep it on random anyway because I like 95% of the designs... And I definitely don't care about one of the designs being "less exclusive" now or what the fuck ever.
---
Change it's cost to 4 mana, change stats to 7/7 and maybe change the text to overload 2
---
Yeah, that could work. I‚Äôll play around with the idea!
---
I‚Äôd give it 1 less health and 2 less cost to make it mediocre instead of complete shit.
---
Oh, I‚Äôm a moron. Misread the title and spent several minutes staring at the pic without getting it at all. My bad.
---
Too aggressive sucks, but to be so uninteractive as warrior is? That's so frustrating. Watching people throw down giant threat after giant threat only to be answered by one of Warriors seemingly infinite removal is absolutely dumb. 
---
Control warrior is literally so uninteractive that they have no idea what to do when I play spell Hunter for an OTK. I play nothing because I'm just waiting for Jepetto and they just sit there confused and not knowing what to do because they don't have any minions to use their cards on. I never feel as confident about a win as when I play this deck vs specifically control warrior.
---
...well shit üòÇ that actually sounds like a very reasonable combo. It's only two cards, and the kill turn only requires you to spend 3 mana so you'll easily have the spare mana to silence or otherwise remove a taunt.
---
That's **actually** going to be a thing, isn't it?
---
Cool
---
That's not even remotely true. No need to throw slander out there because your post was removed 4 months ago.
---
No, I think Execute and Shield Slam are better. Omega Devastator is frustating because the best case scenario is excellent (turn 10 and with Dr. Boom) and Warrior can get 4-5 of them in long games. But it wasn't even two of for a while.
---
1 mana lol
---
Good cheap decks include Mid-range Hunter, Silence Priest, and Murloc Shaman. You can definitely climb and compete with those.  
---
  
---
Staple Legendaries include Zilliax, Leeroy Jenkins, and right now Blastmaster Boom is very very strong if you can manage a good Warrior deck (Bomb and Control are the two most popular Warrior decks)
---
The point of the subreddit is to be all inclusive of all hearthstone content while trying to appeal to as many users as possible. Right now memes are where we draw the line, that could change in the future.
---
Don't be a cunt mate, just giving my opinion on it.
---
Dire wolf won‚Äôt work, the bees attack at the same time, so dire wolf would only buff  one bee
---
What about Clockwork Goblin?
---
There's only 6 of them
---
It doesn‚Äôt take effort to make a funny joke.
---
What's the lowest prize?  My first win was 30 minutes 32 seconds, and I had no idea there were time basses prizes.  I assume I was just off something cool?
---
It lets Rogues run weapon removal, too, since they can combo a Harrison or Ooze with this card in dead match ups. I like this card a lot.
---
And even less to not bother.
---
Romake #1738 NA  Trading quest.  Ill show you go first.
---
Shaman is very good if you can replace everything with Tunnel Trogg and picking overload spells, though
---
cant you just run ooze or harrison just like warrior does for weapons project?
---
Here's an announcement for an announcement, except it's not really confirming the announcement.
---
Except having to take 8 face damage and giving your opponent easy removal for any of your answers...
---
but... you can still buy the blackrock mountain adventure from the blizzard store??? it hasn't been locked away. https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-gb/family/hearthstone#wild-only (euro prices are following you need to get in there at your to see your prices) 24.99‚Ç¨ for blackrock mountain and curse of naxxramas, 19,99 for league of explorers and night before karazhan. and you can buy for free the kobolds&amp;dungeons adventure and knights of the frozen throne adventure too. the dalaran heist probably joins to blackrock mountain and naxxramas once the rise of the shadows rotates to wild.

there is always oozes and harrison jones

I can also confirm this as someone who can read the card texts and keyword explanations which pop up when you hover over the cards.
---
Keep him and give him a shot, at least until you see what cards you get for the next expansion. He's a good card, and it looks like there might be some fun synergies in the near future that could make different "styles" of Druid playable again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For full disclosure, though, I play the game more to collect cards than to "play" it, so I'm biased in favor of only dusting things as a last resort.
---
Yes, lets devalue every single old cardback. Lol
---
That's honestly some terrible news in terms of design, because it says that there might be several cards that were changed at last moment due the "class identity" theme, let's get ready to embrace the bugs and balance issues...
---
Livin' the dream!  That was, what, a 1:18 chance?
---
...How sure are we?
---
here. (and you can‚Äòt really ‚Äûsee‚Äú anyone on reddit, anyway)
---
To be fair, it also keeps any buffs you‚Äôve played on it....
---
laugh now, fools! little do you know I also have 2 copies of mad bomber in this deck! turn 9 is only the beginning! just wait, for on turn 10, my up to 4 oozes will attack, dealing up to 12 face damage! game over nerds.
---
If that doesn't work, try unplaying 14 cards
---
Happy cake day!
---
You know rouge runs lots of small minions and this kills two giants for 1 mana?
---
Still not as bad as what happened to Dr. Boom's Scheme
---
Well, they kinda had to do it this way considering most results would come from assembly at turn 10, meaning you can't pick the mechs
---
I have changed my default address to Oregon, but it is still showing the tax amount. Not sure what is wrong. It is the default address for both regular orders and in one-click settings.
---
We appreciate you being so candid.
---
If you don't mind me throwing my hat into the ring here, I think this could be a tech of sorts, against those pesky warrior weapons(the one that forces your minions to hit each other) and also screws over any aggro shamans with their doomhammers.

---
10 mana bunch of shitty minions on the board.seems good.
---
Rogue already has fan of knives. You could give them a plague that affects every minion that isn't a board wipe if you have a smidgen of imagination/creativity.
---
1 mana removal.I am sure that cant go wrong.
---
"each player" oh boy here comes 4 player game mode! who am I kidding =(
---
idk, have you seen the mass hysteria interaction? seems to me like this could work depending on how it's implemented
---
This card is pretty good. 3 mana, Give yourself a 2/2 knife with poisonous and summon a 3/2 ooze.
---
So close, almost there!
---
And that's 8
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point of my wild Druid decks?
---
Pretty much the same thing, but it also hit face and used to cost 2 mana.
---
I might be misremembering, but originally it had the effect of Hagatha's Scheme.
---
Rogue cares little for opponent's removal? Uhh they care if the opponent literally gets two removals for free. Current successful Rogue decks are tempo decks that win by sticking stuff and hitting the opponent with it. This would see play in a combo Rogue deck like if Miracle was still playable but it doesn't go into a tempo deck.
---
I mean I understand the want for this to be good but as a Rogue player it‚Äôs just super shit. Another thing is what if the non weapon classes like Warlock and Priest get a power spike, do you really want to give them more ways to stop them from letting you stick a board. The only way I can understand the use of this card is with Pogo Rogue and Harrison and even that is a pipe dream since Harrison is a one of.
---
2 mana, break your weapon and do it's damage to all enemies.  Including face.  In the same Meta as [[Tinker's Sharpsword Oil]].  Which gave the Rogue an incredibly efficient card that could either be used as a board clear or a combo-kill.  The interaction was strong enough to make Oil Rogue a meta-defining deck.
---
This is better?
---
You know that Pyromancer is a a card, right?
---
There's no way that giving pyromancer poisonous with a spell was no better than this.

2 Mana AND it would hit face as well as minions.
---
Imagine 15 damage kingsbane, hit face, blade flurry. 30 to 0.
---
Oh, I see it now. But 4 mana and no face is too hard Blizz. I dislike when they do this kind of stuff. Cards that are too strong should be re-*balanced* not made useless.
---
It's not half that is not how maths works
---
That card was honestly bonkers
---
Plague knives
---
This is not the first time.
---
Remember when Legendaries 7sed to be only minions, even though some weapons are likewise worth of legendary status but were made epic nonetheless? Remember how Gorehowl and Doomhammer are forced to be epic?
---
Then remember how they ditched this philosophy and later on made some weird meme cards more prestigious than those two epics in the form of stupid legendary weapons?
---
Doomhammer should a Legendary weapon, not stupid Runespear to shoot frost shock out of your dick.
---
Two removals that demand their biggest threat gets to go face at least once.  Which is better than average.
---
Not saying the card will be great, but in a big threat meta it has a place.
---
It seems unintuitive with how Overkill works. The bees are doing the attacking!
---
I think it's fine. It's like driving people crazy then putting a deadly weapon in their hands so they cause all kinds of mayhem. Makes sense to me.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a destroy your weapon and deal it‚Äôs attack to all minions card? Or am I crazy? Would this work with that?
---
Overkill triggers as long as it is your turn, not whether the minion attacked
---
I do agree, I think either or would have been fine.  Either the cost up to 4, or no face damage from it.  But this was also during the "Blizzard doesn't nerf cards, they kill cards" phase.
---
This is not how Overkill works.
---
Overkill triggers when the minion deals damage higher than the opposing minion during your turn.
---
Best Warrior weapon. Thank you Blizzard lol
---
Oh no, your digital thing you can't sell has lost _value_... it doesn't really even have value in the first place except to showoffs that feel it's cool to boast about what cardbacks they own... it's a digital card game, one that you can only illegally sell your account for, last I checked. So the cardback is literally worthless in monetary value, unlike MTG cards IRL.
---
*cries in mech paladin*
---
Not sure, as I just got it myself obviously. Hopefully someone else pipes in
---
Beeutiful!
---
I used Dr. Boom and minimize all action as much as possible.
---

Only the greediest control decks lose easily to pogo rouge. Most warriors run bombs, rush minions, and mechs in addition to the control cards

Rarity?... it was a seasonal card back from getting to rank 20 ages ago. Anyone playing ranked at the time got it. It wasn't exclusive, just when you happened to have joined the game.
---
I managed to beat rag since this proving sometimes a nights sleep can do wonders lol
---
That's what I said in _my_ top comment as well, btw :3 So I'm not sure what you mean?
---
Kind of unrelated, but I‚Äôve been thinking because of all the overkill discussion from this card. Overkill works with damage and if it‚Äôs on your turn, but what happens when an opponent steals a battlecry of [[Servant of Yogg-Saron]] with Illidan shenanigans? It‚Äôs not their turn so it shouldn‚Äôt work, but I feel like it would end up still triggering.

---
I'll just post what I posted in another thread. 
---
I never cared for card backs so Blizzard can do whatever they want with them as far as I'm concerned. 
---
That said, this will no doubt make the first season card backs and other more exclusive card backs less prestigious. For that reason I suspect that despite more people having access to them less people will actually be using them anymore. There's no achievement attached to them, even if that achievement is just having played since the beginning.
---
Well that's boring. From what they said in the reveal I thought plagues are supposed to have some sort of a "catastrophic impact". This just feels like projects 2.0...
---
if only Druid still had combos
---
That said, bringing back old card backs will no doubt make them less prestigious. For that reason I suspect that despite more people having access to them less people will actually be using them anymore.

---
He‚Äôs being downvoted because it‚Äôs a completely irrelevant point. There is 0 chance they just decide to buff Alexstrasza out of the blue.
---
yea, would of been screwed if i didnt pull wolves
---
I actually don‚Äôt expect Linecracker to work with this card. I thought overkill only works when that minion is initiating the attack.
---
Or just get it down to 4 or less health
---
Or reduce linecracker by 7 with that other Druid minion
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this will work, the bees attack the Linecracker, not the other way. So maybe the overkill won‚Äôt trigger?
---
I aggre
---
I think line cracker needs to attack, not be attacked
---
Will this work? Isnt overkill activated when the minion attacks? I dont think it work when the minion is attacked
---
Cant just BEEEES and linecracker OTK already?
---
Overkill is not working like that.You need to attack with a minion to activate overkill, not to be attacked...So everthing you said is dumb and usseles
---
So, rogue will be the a w f u l class for the next few expansions, huh?
---
RemindMe! 24 days
---
Don't you have to attack the minion in order to use overkill, not the other way round?
---
Not saying outrageous armor counts are good, but wouldn't that kill warrior? Killing a class is just as bad as breaking one imo
---
I thought overkill only worked if the overkill minion was the attacker. Meaning all the bees attacking Linecracker wouldn't do anything.

Madness because it makes people turn on each other (would have been better flavor if it was give all minions poisonous like it was before they changed it)
---
Probably not.
---
I mean weapons project legit gave warrior a really easy reason to run harrison. As well acted as weapon removal in itself. This is basically that just removing the defensive nature and focusing more of the removal aspect of weapons obviously.
---
Vancleef!!!
---
Minions with overkill only trigger when they are the ones attacking
---
i'm not following the thought process here, someone care to explain?
---
Without knowing the rest of your deck besides snipsnap i'd take jepetto. If you don't have any good battlecry minions then maybe i'd give more credence to head. The problem is it's just really easy to remove unless you already have the board - otherwise, it's just an understatted 5. 
---
IMO Jepetto &gt; Head &gt;Knight
---
Does anyone read the comments before replying. Or does that 'only work when my minion is attacking'?
---
Assuming I did the math right, and mechanics didn't change when I wasn't looking, that's enough armor to survive **72 draws** worth of fatigue.
---
Fuck off. Why give your opinion if you never pay wild?
---
As of right now it should work, libebacker triggers for example of mass hysteria
---
you mean 5/1..?
---
If the linecracker sticks one turn bees pretty much makes this an OTK
---
Hahaha thats the default effect for the fourth heist I think 
---
You can‚Äôt change that
---
I mean.. the bees will be attacking it, it won‚Äôt be attacking them... so the overkill wouldn‚Äôt trigger right?
---
* laughs in Malfurion *
---
Pretty sure the max damage from exodia mage is like 300 damage?
---
Yes, can someone teach me how to stick a minion on board vs Dr Boom? "Light the fuses!" "Save the best for last" "Unity, precision, perfection!"
---
This is a normal complication for chapter four.
---
Doesn't overkill only work if the overkill minion is the attacker?
---
It's anninvaild combo. The bees attack the Linecracker so overkill isn't triggered.
---
Why announce it as a feature of the expansion then?  If they described it like it is, "Hey in Saviours of Uldum we're going to release five spells that all have a common word in their name!", then it is zero hype.  It just comes off as shoddy work for them to say "Plagues are big and exciting and affect all minions!" and then it turns out that Plagues are just... spells.
---
The Saviors legendaries are special because they actually represent those cards and let people put their cherished characters into their decks.  Imagine if Blastmaster Boom were like, a 4-mana 2/3 that had a couple random keywords.  Would that not be disappointing?  That's analogous to the Rogue plague.
---
No unless a synergy card is released this is boom plan bad.
---
i guess than 7 cards combo should win you the game
---
Wait, doesn't overkill only work when the said minion is attacking? I'm confused
---
Won't work, Overkill only works when the minion attacks
---
I knew I forgot something...
---
It's a bad design decision.  I would much prefer to have one Aggro, one Control and one Combo deck (at minimum) playable from each class at all times.  I would love to have choice playing one class, but i don't.  They could also release fewer cards, more often, from weakest to strongest throughout the year, to keep the meta fresh, and more cards played.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  You want to play a different archetype?  You need to play a different class, which means owning more cards, which means buying more packs.  Its designed so that kids don't cry when they expect to play vs token Druid and die to combo turn 10.  Also probably makes more money.  I could also be completely wrong. it may be by mistake, or may be for tournament play.  Either way the old ways are done.
---
Ladder: 2,1,3,4
---
Competitive: 3,1,4,2.
---
Half for 5 cards? Nope. Half for 6 cards, yes.  
---
5 cards is significantly less. With just 1 bees you have 1/16 power on the linebreaker. So you'd have approx 1/32 of armour of the full combo if you use just 5 cards.
---

The Beta Devastator vs the Alpha Zilliax

I beat priest once with 7 cthun buckets (including 5 cthuns) and the randomized cost treasure. The biggest problem are the first two bosses. Only 2 of my 6 tries got further than that
---
Poof
---
You broke r/woosh... congrats?
---
The wording for overkill is "deals damage on your turn" so unless they change it for this specific card, it should mean that every time the 1/1 hits the overkill minion, the overkill minion will deal its damage, and since it's your turn, overkill will proc.
---
Priest is definetly the worst out of the 4 classes. You need a bit rng to even win against the first two bosses.
---
[laughs in Mecha'thun]
---
I know. Just kill it and go next game.
---
If you have additional cheap spells to fuel the initial Fireball generation then you can cast more spells before the timer runs out because you can cast the other Fireballs while the generation animation is ongoing.
---
Good thinking on Harrison. 6 mana draw 2 cards, on top of a 5/4 body and the weapon itself is a pretty sweet combo.
---
These posts will never get old!
---
Active on your turn from what I've seen... all sadly yes this works
---
Overkill only works if the card with overkill is attacking right? If so, this wouldn't work
---
Great time. I got 26 minutes last night. Could probably shave off a few minutes during the treasure and deck building sections but I doubt I can get anywhere near 15. You must have gotten some amazing combos!
---

Zul'jin may not be a great example because it's a hero card so it is conceivable that after being played, Zuljin becomes the hero/player entity. So even though you aren't "playing" his spells from hand, it still counts as "you" casting them. 
---
I think it's so funny how much phrasing and semantics matter in the game mechanics
---
Dude op combo how did blizzard not think of this
---
There's only two 1 cost
---
Yeah without that distinction it's basically a rehashing of symmetrical projects so far.
---
I like some of them.
---
Thank you for SHOWING you're an idiot. Saying you did something dumb isn't the same as 'admitting to being an idiot' you moron.
---

---
Asia already finished, we get EU &amp; North America later on, i think EU starts around 19:00 CEST but don't quote on me that.
---
"I do something idiotic all the time" makes you an idiot.
---
You idiot.
---
I am. We had a good friendship going.
---
Yea because all popups are the same. You think a popup on some spam site is the same as a popup when you pay for something? Also there are other tools than popups to convey messages, but I don't expect reddit 8 year olds to know anything about UI/UX.
---
They already confirmed that one new lackey will come with SoU

1-1=0 cause they fight each other :)

It returns in three hours with Europe (Orange vs Kolento), you can find the schedule [here](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/esports/schedule/grandmasters).

Oh now you're completely changing what I said. Nice try mr 70 IQ troll.

BOMB AXE!

Memes are always bad content, everywhere. They're lazy, tired, and the same old joke recycled until until it's so unfunny it actually annots you.

Maybe he was talking from the Warriors point of view...Who has nearly no chance to win this.
---
&gt; Yea because all popups are the same.
---
This is an example of you trying to defend your idiocy with more idiocy.
---
It's what makes this hilarious.
---
&gt; You think a popup on some spam site is the same as a popup when you pay for something?
---
No idea what you're even talking about, here.
---
You're not on a pop-up site. You're on a free to play game. One that doesn't give you pop-ups that often. When they do, it's usually because of card changes - buffs, nerfs, Hall of Fame.
---
i.e. It's very often relevant.
---
&gt; Also there are other tools than popups to convey messages,
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
A pop-up is the most immediate and attention gripping way of communicating, though. **And that's what they were aiming to achieve.**
---
You would know that if you knew anything about UI, lol. Actually, no. You would know that if you had any common sense.
---
Keep tilting, though. That'll surely help you get your dust back. :\^)
---
It's still played but it has seen better days.
---
The first time i beat the brawl was with priest lol i guess 0 mana cthun carried me
---
The more relaxed, low effort MS Paint spam?
---
You said you ignore pop-ups all the time.
---
That's not "completely changing what you said," that's translating it.
---
If you constantly act like an idiot, guess what? That makes you an idiot.
---
Damn you're retarded lol
---
My favorite deck will forever be milk and it still kills me that Oracle was hof‚Äôd.  While I understand the decision and also that mill in particular was hated by a ton of people, to actually win with the deck takes a ton of skill and forethought.
---
Bwahahaha! This is why we can‚Äôt have nice stuff LMFAO.
---
No Rogues ever played Envenom Weapon, that's kind of a hint.
---
It will be interesting to see what happens. I will play paladin and just make the sieve breaker play by the rules.
---
Snip-Snap every time, not even close
---
Would this combo actually work? The line cracker isn‚Äôt attacking the bees so would the overkill actually activate or are you just dealing 8 damage to your own minion? Ik that blizzard interactions can be strange sometimes so if I‚Äôm missing something here sorry.
---
putting in microtech controller or scarab egg would up the consistency of token generation while still pulling off cool combos. Mabye even the acorn dude
---
5 mana would be okay, or limit the effect to pull out max 8 mana minions
---
What they are doing is ok for "competitive" ranked play, but majority of players don't care about tournament play. It is the complete opposite of what they should be doing for normal play, which is allowing people to play a class in the way they want to. This concept that a class needs a pre-defined deck archetype is completely incorrect, and is one of the things that is limiting standard. Of course there are going to be stronger decks, and weaker decks, and of course decks have counters, but the options for classes to build how they choose, regardless of how similar you think one class will be to another is what makes a game like this interesting.
---
Exactly.. from my experience every match against warrior runs out EXACTLY the same
---
I dunno how kids have fun running it. It's beyond me bro
---
Which is annoying why they have to be Legendary and not epic. They don‚Äôt feel like a legendary effect like the last quests did.
---
Why is everyone in this thread forgetting wep removal exists
---
Found the warrior player. And look he's bitching about the one class that has a decent chance of beating him.
---
Aggro Warrior hasn't been a thing for a long time now.
---
its worth mentioning that gloop has a lot of ramp potential already. poison seeds/whispering woods along pyro can easily get you to 10 mana on turn ~6/7 plus you have the gloop active so each beees is +1 mana. when you actually think about it this combo is incredibly easy to pull off
---
To be honest it's because I can't be bothered explaining why removing deck choices within classes is bad for the game...
---
*Fact check'er? I hardly know her.*
---
Yeah, Lackeys alone would make a "all minions get poisonous" Rogue card ridiculous.
---
Is it bad I don't see the problem in the article?
---
He used two shield slams, 2 executes, 2 devastators, a big game hunter, and got a second zilliax.
---
How is that stupidly implemented? Is deck building part of the run? I think the answer is unanimously yes. That said, your run time should include it.
---
Yeah this isn't supposed to be a good deck, just something to mess around with.
---
Itll be one of those snake dudes.
---
Sethrak?
---
Obviously no one tried to throw a chicken of a plane
---
This. There is nothing wrong with Big Priest. It's not anywhere close to oppressive and constitutes a very small portion of the ladder.
---
I dont care how many others use my card back, I was damn proud of beating heroic Karazhan
---
This may look like a meme but it's actually a very scary thing.
---
Take Jade Druid for instance, Bees is not a bad card. It's 3 mana deal 4 to a minion with Overkill: get that many 1/1s, it's a good card that will very likely see play.
---
Now Earthen Scales is where things get more difficult but as I see there are 2 ways to play Jade Druid, you can go full-control and focus entirely on looping jades or you can play a midrange deck that doesn't shuffle. I'm running 2 Elephants and Aya, I've seen legend builds running Zilliax and I already thought about including something like Thaurissan a few times when I wish I had more minions to pressure those pesky Big Priests or Reno Warlocks.
---
There is a warrior card for 3 mana that draws 1 and gives you 5 armor, it's a staple. Earthen Scales doesn't pay for itself unfortunately but it costs only 1 and makes a minion harder to kill, it's still not good enough by itself, I fully agree. You can gain 6 armor with Aya and make it a 6/4, you can play it in a large Jade Golem and gain a lot of armor, you can combo it with Vargoth turn 5 to make it harder to kill since it only targets friendly minions but it's not good enough.
---
But now imagine you have this combo, even a single bees and a single Earthen Scales can give you 80 armor. EIGHTY. Can you imagine? You're playing Odd Paladin or any other aggro deck and then suddenly your enemy gains 80 armor? Just the threat is ridiculous, drop the Linecracker and force your opponent to trade their entire board or spend all their removal dealing with a 5/10. If a Linecracker survives a turn you can get 160 armor with a single bees and scales, it's really not that difficult to accomplish any of this, if I play Spreading Plague T6 and Linecracker T7 most opponents will be unable to clear it.
---
Why are you so angry? Blizzard didn't forsee snip snap at zero in priest, and they admitted it. This combo is much more complicated so it is likely they didn't forsee it, and I even said "probably", so you are gonna have to explain your statement.
---
Everyone seems to be overlooking the fact that Linecracker needs to attack the minion its killing fot its overkill to trigger. From my understanding, the bees would be attacking it and therefore would not trigger its overkill
---
Devs confirmed that the overkill mechanic is programmed based on who's turn it is, not who is attacking. So overkill would work with bees.
---
Personally I hope they fix that, because it seems like a pretty obvious oversight that could open up some dumb possibilities.
---
Those BEES!
---
Don't ask me, the game could be just numbers without any graphics for all I care. But some people get enjoyment over art they like.
---
Why is this a wild combo?
---
u guys are forgetting about the hero power
---
I haven‚Äôt played against a priest in at least a month, and the patch finished them.
---
Another option is to leave the rezz cards alone but get rid of Priests healing cards and some of their removal cards.  This way, they cant just sit back and take damage.  The problem now is that even if you get some good damage in &amp; they draw poorly..... the healing and board clearing saves their behinds far too often.  Make them PAY a price for sitting there for severa turns and dont give them such easy health-reload options.
---
I don't think you want to pull this with Dirty Rat.  If you play Bee's and Naturalize or clear their Taunt its an OTK too of 80 damage.  (5-&gt;10-&gt;20-&gt;40-&gt;80).
---
Did you win?
---
I wish
---
Trading 80g quest NA JFaction#1201
---
I'll show, you go first
---
Thats some great removal for rogue right there
---
Does this work as the bees are the ones doing the attacking? I thought overkill didn't work that way?
---
It's a meme deck, the mechathun will have no support besides surviving with 2K armor so you can play it normally and slowly trade minions or hit face.
---

---
My briefcase full of BEES!
---
Sorry but your post has been removed as it violates the rules of this Subreddit.
---
Why are you going around starting arguments about that's you don't care about.
---
It's rogue.
---
Noob question:
---
I thought overkill only works if the minion attacks?
---
Real talk: I may be in the minority here, but I think Vargoth is way worse. Sure there‚Äôs no major highroll like Barnes, but Vargoth is a much better rez target, and killing Barnes on 4 dilutes their pool while Vargoth makes every rez spell cast twice.
---
If/when Barnes is hit, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Big Priest continues to be almost as strong with just Vargoth, there were already variations that didn‚Äôt use Barnes to ensure rez pool was good.
---
I mean big priest isn't the only deck you have to think about. I always consider how my deck will beat cyclone mage, reno warlock, and odd paladin way over big priest. 
---
I think honestly the sheer number of rez effects big priest has is the real problem. I played a lot of astral druid (RIP) and that deck could get some disgusting early highrolls with a surprising frequency but past that it didn't have the sheer sustain and tempo swings that the glut of priest's rez spells provide. Astral druid never got anything close to the same volume of calls for nerfs; rather it got nerfed indirectly by the massive druid core nerfs.
---
Quite, I‚Äôve amended my statement
---
Lmao shut up nerd.
---
You can use the random card back! It's not much but you select the random card back, the is a chance it will be randomly selected because you technically own it as a card back. I agree though it's a shame one of the nicest card back is locked behind a random chance.
---
Imagine having a life that makes you think this is interesting.
---
Try it now, I got mine in EU

It's less that and more that Dynomatic isn't that great past turn 10

My lord, is that legal?

Its not a story the Kirin Tor would tell you
---
That sub should be fucking ashamed for letting sandstorm and Damph get 'top voted'
---
or run them all along with auctioneer
---
Nevermind, apparently it does work that way. Again, JFC.
---
Just wait until the meta is defined. People thought the old quests and hero cards sucked too. These are a mix of hero cards and quests which looks more balanced to me. You get the benefit of a hero card/power with the requirement of a quest instead of just playing a hero card for an instant swing. 
---
These could go very well or very poorly for the game. I don't see it being in the middle personally but not going to speculate until then.
---
What do they use to cycle?
---
Haplo#11591 80g trade NA challenge a friend
---
And therefore stupid boring
---
This was obviously going to be something like, ‚Äúevery minion attacks it‚Äôs neighbor.‚Äù But I think that it maybe was basically the same as Priest‚Äôs madness card so they instead went with this?
---
Im saying it is one possible reason, another could be that it is simpler to code that way. Blizzard dont just give free stuff for no reason so they probs would try and prevent people from getting 100 free dust cos they might buy packs instead.
---
Yea, i used that evolve lackey on a former champ and BOOM
---
I count 6 distinct ways to win
---
I know, right? Damph is so dumb. "I know they just added a new keyword, but I don't like it. Get it out of here."
---
Exactly, I used to play a lot of conceal miracle rogue in wild, the nerf to cold blood killed all hope to make it work to climb reliably.  
---
So big priest is protected from nerf because he use mostly wild card but barely surviving deck get nerfed to death because due to new card addition they become too strong in standard ?
---
Or the last nerf of Raza and quest rogue just before rotation ? Both effectively killed the deck, when was the last Reno priest you saw on ladder ?
---
It's not casting a spell.

---
I played it a lot, but it was still like 1-2% of the meta.
---
Thanks, I might give it a shot. I've been messing with some jank esper combo deck in bo1 recently.
---
That version of Barnes would still work in Big Rogue, Y'Shaarj Spell Hunter or other Barnes+Y'Shaarj cheese decks. It might not be used competitively in Big Priest, but most other decks utilising Barnes wouldn't be hurt, which is an upside of the proposed nerf.
---
If you put those in chronological order, it seems far less silly.
---
Blizzard - Here's Conjurers Calling and Khadgar.
---
Blizzard - Hmm, maybe we're getting too lose with class identity.  Here's the definitions that we're working with for future sets.
---
I mean...i used ring the bells a few times lol.
---
I think hunter quest decks with the powerful treasures were good too.
---
Might have a priest win too?
---
It costs zero because a random selection from the entire card pool is almost certainly going to be the hottest of garbage. We've seen more than one "Discover a specific type of card" to be one mana, so I kind of get why this one costs 0.
---
This card should deal 5 or 6 dmg tbh
---
Don't underestimate how much I can fuck up a deck.
---
Because that would be a specific combo which requires a built-around deck and to draw the right cards. The idea of this was to just have a bunch of synergising stuff to have fun with.
---
How is it way too OP? First you need to survive to even play it, then you need to fill your board and your hand just to win. To fill your board, you need to play at least 1 card which would make your hand have 9 or less cards. To get fill both your hand and your board, you need to somehow have 6 minions on board while having 9 cards in your hand, then hope your opponent can't destroy any of the minions. That's a much much harder thing to do than something like Mecha'thun where you just draw your deck and then play a few cards.
---
Well see, a global sap would be okay if it wasn't classic, ie rotates out eventually
---
ha
---
What if Priest was able to transform these guys into more favorable dead minions? Like stealing Rafaam or evolve effects?
---
Bloodmage Thalnos, Loothoarder, and Acolyte of Pain all seem really strong with this. 4 mana for 3 bodies and 2 cards just seems good.
---
My first was Gruul :-{
---
Before complaining about "more support for big priest", how about taking half a second to think if big priest actually wants to play this.
---
The answer is it doesn't.
---
I'm guessing that the data shows people hate losing to classic Priest. So they just never want Priest to be powerful again.
---
My first was actually rag way back when. Opened another one a couple months later and dissed the golden one. Kinda wish I didn‚Äôt but having another meta legendary was probably the smarter decision
---
My first was,  I shit you not, Gruul.
---
My first was Cho - no joke - I de'd that without blinking. I was a huge noob back then too, even still I knew a shit card when I saw one
---
What does the reborn keyword do?
---
That's the wrong face for the GOLDEN GOD of Hearthstone.
---
Razakus Priest / Reno Razakus Priest was hated, but as a player who predominantly plays Priest, it was IMO the most interesting Priest deck I've played in my years of playing HS. Every game really felt different and I loved the variations in deck building.
---
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!
---
mana cheat and build towards late game.
---
all of your treasures and buckets (after the first 2-4) should be with the late game bosses in mind.
---
I opened a gruul too and I can't disenchant him because it feels wrong but also I've never played him ever.
---
hey guys how it going Kripparrian here
---
Pretty sure they don't have a tracker at all and they're just making it up and releasing it whenever.
---
Why would they spend time and engineering resources to implement a tracker when they could just make it up?
---

---
Where are my r/japanesebreakfast fans at?
---
hey guys hows it going Kripparrian here
---
Totally trying to avoid power creep!
---
This is my favorite card from the new treasures
---
I only keep golden cards that generate other cards or minions, otherwise I disenchant them. This one is great because every copy created by it will be golden!
---
My first golden legendary was Prophet Velen. :)
---
First thing I thought of when I saw the card's name!
---
What?
---
BOTH players?  Yeah rogue gets screwed again.  
---
Almost done my 500 then I can be done with rogue at least which is a shame as it's a pretty fun class to play when it's not being screwed over by Blizzard.
---
Tryna flex on you
---
How many more quests do we have until the end of the questline?
---
I like the looks of this card a lot for standard. If it summons a Safeguard you have a really annoying wall to bust through, Convincing Infiltrator is sort of a luke-warm board clear, Mosh'ogg Enforcer would be a real pain in the ass also. Pretty bad turn 4 drop, but if you load a deck with annoying taunts I can see this card single-handedly winning a good number of games when paired with divine spirit/inner fire
---
what a scam :/
---
Holy shit this was painful to read  
---
You're delusional
---
They clearly nerfed Elise from Epic to Rare
---
But would you reaally put this in instead of something that has some actual sinergy with your deck? This card is just too random and would probably never be impactful in the meta. And that "perfect card situation" you described is basically why anyone would even run this card, and, if you actually run this, looking at the chances for this to actually happen, you kinda deserve to spam wow at your opponent.
---
wew lad, got an example of the kinda treasure or deck choices you make?
---
A lot of the treasures (and buckets) can be deceptive, either looking far stronger than they play out or vice versa.  If you're struggling with the, I'd suggest taking a look at the guides over at icy-veins to get a second opinion of your picks.
---
People have definitely gotten lower. There's some in the 11-12 range.
---
People just hate priest win conditions
---
Razakus priest was the best
---
Lol all those those don't deal with 8/8s without some other help and it sounds like you are telling me you can only have a chance if you pull the hero card.
---
Hearthstone adventures uses a different mind set than constructed  or arena. Maybe watching others complete the heist or letting someone coach you will help make better decisions
---
It is extremely close. I watced the Grandmasters for the packs and in every game, turn 5 and 6 mage had and an empty board, and during that turn he filled it with 8-8 minions or 7-8 minions ( with taunt) and froze the enemy board. It's on the same level of BS as the Naga decks if not more. Also, I thought mage's weakness were taunt minions/healing. Well conjurer's calling is all they need you can never get past 4 minions with taunt that have 7-8 in stats.While they removed mind blast and vanish to be consistent with the same class identity that doesn't apply to mage. They should honestly raise the cost of the taunt giant by 1 and it would all be good imho
---
No, and that's the problem.  The only reason to run the card is to pull out some random BS.  It's on average not great at even 0 mana, but the high roll potential just isn't fun at all, and the high rolls are made worse by the potential for it being available the turn of sometimes.  ie pyroblast.
---
That and the flavour is just... not there.

Dammmmn! Source?
---
Yes but with the recent patches most classes clearly got the vulnerabilities described in the class identities while mage doesn't. Honestly the hole class identity idea was bad but I think Blizz didn't know in what direction to start balancing things( I'm talking about clasic bc who cares about wild,right?)
---
Yes but it was much better in the brawl when Rag had 80 hp lol
---
If it hits itself you get 3 3 1s which isn't that bad
---
All the different things priest can do in wow, and blizzard decides that resurrection in the end-all, be-all or priest. How bored do you want priest players to be?
---
You're right and it's better, since you don't have to mod on every update, but sadly I don't have this option in developer settings (Nougat).
---
that rank 18 bothers me with so many games xD but tbh 60 lvls is looking dope
---
I used the stones to destroy the stone
---
I think cars draw is often the most or second most important factor in deciding the outcome of close matchup games.  If the decks are relatively equal, generally whoever draws better will win, assuming equal player skill.  Now the skill gap is obviously capable of being pretty wide which is why it‚Äôs the other top attribute but I‚Äôd actually say great draw order, which is luck, is the best thing to have.
---
Chinese censorship you mean.
