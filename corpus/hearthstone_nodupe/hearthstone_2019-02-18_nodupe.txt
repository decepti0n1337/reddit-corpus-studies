If you craft Kel'Thuzad, you have to play the Big decks (Big Priest, Big Rogue, Big Warlock, Big Druid, etc.) Those are loads of fun.

Hooktusk is also pretty good. In tempo rogue the winrate for getting it in your opening mulligan was better than keleseth.

I just started seeing this deck on the ladder 
---
Loses to a smart CW player 
---
No, because i like to play wild more then  standard, because as bad as one turn kills are and how out of control combo or infinite value decks are i can at least play with counters to them..
---
 Like taking a weblord if im facing a lot of shudderwocks, or playing singleton deathrattle priest to piss off aggro players.  And who maybe someday blizzard will put old wild cards into standard again with a rotating classic set like every single pro player has said needs to happen to fix the classic problem.
---
It'd be the most expensive thing ever in hearthstone. You couldn't afford a house if you bought this.
---
50% it either happens or it doesn't. Obviously 
---
Oof
---
Oh no, that’s unfortunate! However, that matchup is favored according to HSReplay. The best way to win against Warrior is to either find an opportunity to Cube the Mech Whelps, or to do a ton of damage with Cube on Devilsaurs. It’s a tricky matchup, but rewarding when you win :)
---
Any cards that limits deck building with a huge upside where most decks on ladder are slight variations of net-decks means the deck-building restrictions are negated.    
---
So cards like the princes, baku/Genn etc. Don’t actually have a downside, they either make a broken deck or they are quest hunter.  There’s no choices there, the deck is pretty much already built, it’s either good or it’s bad.    
---
I play hearthstone to deck-build, it used to be my favourite part of the game. Pre-built otk packages playing Rock Paper Scissors on ladder with pre-built hero/quest/odd/even/only spells hunter is not fun.   
---
There have always been synergies that we’re fairly obvious but now we are really spoon fed, the first iteration of this was C’thun but it felt a cool idea at the time to have this one archetype/deck for new players that was pre-built but It started getting out of control in mean streets when they turned Reno from a cool card into 3 pre-built decks +jade/goons, since then they have continued down this route with lots of different pre-built decks that give the illusion of choice but quest rogue has 26 cards that always need to be played.  
---
I feel like the last expac was pretty good because there was less of that(make an argument for zul’jin) but the whole standard rotation is clogged full of it and Wild is even worse. Next expac please no pre-built decks.
---
Um, even when I play off-meta decks I am only one half of the game. I can be all kinds of innovative and special, but the meta will still feel stale if I play against the same tier decks all the time.

Pretty much everything I see on pinterest fits this description

Funnily, the odds of you dying to the Rod of Roasting at 70hp vs 30hp are exactly the same as losing in arena with less than 7 wins - 91%.
---
Also, coming from someone who just completed the Dungeon Runs again just for the fun of it - the end boss RNG is just complete bullshit. Xol, Azari and The Darkness are perfectly beatable if you keep in mind that you will have to face them, but the Dragon and Tog are absolute bullshit. Out of maybe... 20 completed runs, I doubt I've beaten Tog and the Dragon more than 1 time each. This is something The Witchwood fixed - the end-game bosses are not completely broken.

**Sunkeeper Tarim** has anti-synergy with our garbage deck. **Tirion Fordring** has the best synergy with our deck as it is the most garbage of the three

That's a woooosh on you. My reply was sarcastic.

You know what *is* fun? Countering frustrating decks. Just play something that beats Wall Priest.
---
Just decided to buy a Witchwood pack on a whim and finally got Baku, I'm F2P and don't have Genn either so I'm pretty happy. 
---
Odd Warrior is one of the decks best situated for rotation because of the cards rotating out, only Reckless Flurry is so high impact it raises the question of what will replace it (though both the Hatchling/Elise fatigue gameplan and the Quest are important variants).  However, Odd Warrior is a highly polarized deck so there can be/likely will be certain metas where the deck really struggles, even considering that it's keeping most of its key cards.

Why would Miracle Rogue want to shuffle more bad cards into their deck?
---
I suppose deathrattle rogue is the only deck that can consistently get the card draw from him without worrying about silence, since you can usually have a necrium blade on hand  when you play him. I’m still iffy about it though, since their are much better deathrattles to trigger. It’s definitely a weird card. 
---
But there is no graveyard. It doesn't say "summon a minion from your graveyard". You discover a minion that died this game. Even if you resurrected it once, it's still a minion that died this game.

This is why i play wild and I put dirty rat in all my non-aggro decks.

Zoolock is unfavorable match so "countering it" isn't entirely true.  
---
Midrange does have a nice favorable match (depending which you run I find - Dire Frenzy is essential imo) and is a fun deck but still quite reliant on getting the right draw rather than any decent decision making against a deck like wall.  
---
The only hard counter right now I can see is Maly Rogue and that's far from "fun and interactive" either.  There are others with a slightl favorable win rate and there could be others too but the match counts are pretty low to be sure.

---
My point was that no... he didn’t name himself after Donald lol
---
Baku and Genn do not limit design space any more so than the Death Knight cycle of Hero Cards or really any other legendary card that defines decks. Like with those, the best way to design around them would be to create new designs decks with them would not want to play.
---
And for Wild, Team 5, like all other game makers whose games have an eternal formats, should know they tend to balance themselves out fairly nicely outside of select circumstances, and the heavy hand of card changes should only be used *after* the creation of response designs (cards that are meant to strengthen counters to dominate decks) isn't enough on its own.
---
&gt; I don't make sense? That literally made no sense at all in the context of the previous posts? Fatigue? Wtf? Strawman much?
---
Fatigue, as in you said you don't have an endless supply of small minions, which Warlock essentially *does* have until you draw your entire deck. You know, the point in which you get into fatigue?
---
&gt;Again, that is not what I said. Read and respond accordingly, don't make things up.
---
Please enlighten me then because you have yet to explain how it is you're emptying your hand and running out of minions yet have nothing to show for it.
---
&gt;I prefer HSReplay personally and this is an example of why.
---
We'll see how it shapes up, but that doesn't address the issues with your description how you're playing Zoo. Or maybe the data is just reflecting other people who don't know how to play Zoo. /s
---
&gt;By all accounts your story doesn't stack up and it doesn't but cool story anyway. :)
---
Your story is that of either a deck that isn't Zoo, or one that is used by someone who doesn't know how to play Zoo properly. Again, please explain to me how you're emptying your hand and running out of minions yet somehow aren't over extending.
---
He's talking about Elise the Trailblazer in Un'Goro preciously not shuffling a pack but instead having something like "Whenever you adapt a minion, gain all 3 adaptations".

Hey u/BigLebowskiBot , I'm not sure what you're asking. It's Sunday February 17 but I'm guessing that's not the real question. What's up?

[Huh.](http://i.imgur.com/0auxGaZ.gif)
---
I mean yeah. Nobody’s saying he is a Trump supporter, just that he admired his confidence in the past and that influenced him choosing the name 
---
Agreed, you don’t want to get a really good board past turn 4-5 bc you know that either mass hysteria or Psychic is going to decimate it
---
they're $2 each where i live. That's over four times as expensive
---
OHHHHH. Thanks for the clarification, I didn’t read it like that 
---
I’ve watched Trump for 5+ years and every time he’s given a reasoning behind his name it’s never been because of Donald
---
What. This is so wrong in so many ways lol. Genn provides an upgrade that is powerful in more than just the early game: 1 mana lifetap is nuts on any turn, for example. I don't understand your fixation on "infinite value" when the real issue with these cards is the design restrictions they place on future cards (and nerfs, as seen with equality).
---
what you said isn’t evidence of that. He could still have named himself after Donald Trump before he got into politics 
---
and you're still going to be playing against the same decks all the time regardless of whether genn and baku are in the game or not.  
---
look at warlock right now. equal representation of cubelock, evenlock and zoo. what do you think happens if you delete evenlock? you just have 1 less deck in the meta. everyone who was playing it switches to another meta deck. all you accomplished was less diversty.  
---
what happens if you delete odd paladin? everyone playing it switches to the new secret paladin deck which has a higher winrate right now on hsreplay. instead of both decks being playable you now have only 1 competitively relevant paladin deck. the fact that secret paladin has proven so competitive is all the evidence you need that baku and genn aren't restricting the meta, the playerbase is by only playing tierlisted netdecks and that's never going to change no matter how many supposedly problem cards are nerfed.  
---
&gt;He chose the “Trump” nickname as a teenager simply because he got a kick out of Donald J. Trump’s showy management style on The Apprentice.
---
source: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/the-other-trump-meet-hearthstone-star-gamer-jeffrey-shih-250389/
---
This just isn’t correct thinking lol. Genn and Baku are the most design restricting cards in the history of Hearthstone 
---
Yeah. Applying the Laffer curve to this situation could suggest such a thing, but I doubt it. If anything, Hearthstone's pricing model more likely lies just to the left of peak revenue instead of to the right.
---
But adding strong cards to either you would always have to keep in mind their power level. Even wild has changed to. Baku and Genn as they give you such an advantage in tempo and value with just your HP
---
But he didn’t lol. I have my reasoning earlier 
---
It's fucking good, bro. 
---
I love a good thread backfire, and this is a great one
---
&gt;Fatigue, as in you said you don't have an endless supply of small minions, which Zoolock essentially does have until you draw your entire deck. You know, the point in which you get into fatigue?  
---
No it doesn't. If you go big early (i.e. use mana to play minions) you aren't also tapping. If you wait until late it's far too easy for the opponent to clear you or just throw walls up.    
---
There is no magic resource you've got that's allowing what you think can happen to happen regularly.  You play early and they're gone if they get cleared, you play late - too late it's combo time.  
---
So far what you say and what the reality of the situation sually ends up as are two different things.  
---
Maybe explain it more in depth? Give some decent examples as I've played a lot of games against wall priest and they rarely ever turn out like you seem to think they do.  
---
Druid is weak as fuck now. They kept getting nerfec
---
Honestly, you're probably right. They make more money this way than they would if packs had higher value.
---
That doesn't mean I need to keep throwing my money at them though. 
---
Started happening more often. 
---
Both Genn and Baku cause an issue of adjusting mana costs for any nerf that needs to happen, as well as literally any future card printed within this rotation/forever in Wild. It no longer becomes "Make this +1 mana to make it a little weaker" because it opens the can of worms that "now it can be used in the opposite archetype decks." Now everything must get bumped up by 2 so it's stuck in the same archetype and now sucks in ALL departments.
---
It doesn't matter if Baku decks are inherently stronger, there have been plenty of Even decks that are just as powerful, if not more (hello Wild), and are just as problematic. Even Paladin at launch (still strong now, even after Equality nerf), Even Warlock in general (even more insane in Wild), and Even Shaman (still nuts in Wild) are all just as powerful as Odd Paladin, Odd Warrior, Odd Rogue, and Odd Mage.
---
Salty asf

Do you mean I should have polymorphed the whole board? That's a 10-mana potion effect
---
All Even decks are pretty boring. Improving hero powers from the start of game makes every game too basic and similar. 
---
Is it that lucrative? That it's worth the cartels efforts to control its trade?
---
So druid choice card are not an interesting mechanic and that's why they allowed fandral?

&gt; I can assure you that most games I've played, people had those cards that changed their Hero person...... from the welcome bundle I bought 2 days ago.

I live in California and don’t see much of a drop in quality from fresh local avocados compared to the off-season ones that have to be imported from Chile.
---
But 10 turns worth of value is still unfair, and if my math is correct you can use your hero power at least 9 times on those 10 turns, turn 1 and 3 to 10, and 2 can be a hero power turn with coin (Making 10 Turns of proactive hero powering) wich is arguably better that coin on turn 1 in Baku decks, because you can play a 2-cost card with it, making your coin turn much more proactive than a Baku deck
---
And yet it'll still have the additional context of getting associated of the worst humans in the word. Funny how language works!

&gt;The only evidence is that people who like to show off slutmog on twitter are often women (and I saw a lot of men to, so even that is shaky at best). That's it. 
---
Right, and given that twitter users are mostly male, that is evidence for the premise that most slutmog users are female. Since there is no reason to believe that male slutmog users would be more likely to post pictures on twitter than female ones.
---
&gt;With what would it disagree when my position is that we don't know ? Stop projecting it's embarassing.
---
No, your position is that there is no reason to believe that that most slutmog users are female. When in fact, we do have some reason to believe it.
---
&gt;Because I already did FFS
---
No you didn't. That was the first comment you said to me, and it had no argument.
---
I ask again, why are you being dishonest and refusing to actually give an argument for what you're saying? If you actually did previously, which you didn't, then it should be easy to just paste it again.
---
Why is it wrong for a fictional character to show cleavage? Your previous statement, that they have no agency, is not an argument as I said multiple times.
---
TL;DR at the end, I didn't want this post to be so long.
---
I have two or maybe three big problems with Hearthstone, and I am really sad, because Hearthstone is nowhere compared to its potential. The core of the game is really good and it's really fun to play, and even the competitive aspect of the game is good. I really want to play this game as my main game, but it just doesn't change in a good direction. And this is coming from a 15+ times legend player. So yes, I really like(d) the game, and was waiting for years for changes, but it just doesn't happen. And following the news, the game is just going downwards with continuous incomprehensible basic/classic set nerfs that are the problem of card design, and not admitting and correcting the real mistakes made.
---
**1. Lack of new game modes.** 
---
Ever since the introduction of Tawern brawl in 2015, which is a really good game mode, nothing new was added. I don't think this is okay for the most popular digital CCG in the world that makes a lot of money just by releasing new expansions consistently. 
---
With the wild game mode basically being a trash can for problematic cards, standard is the only real competitive game mode in the whole game. If standard is bad, Hearthstone is not fun, standard is good, Hearthstone is fun. And sadly this whole standard year was kind of mediocre compared to what Hearthstone usually is. (underpowered sets in 2018, Kobolds/Frozen Throne powercreep, Baku/Genn, Druid that had to be destroyed, then Hunterstone, then whatever we have now after the latest nerfs, looking at the VS report things don't seem too good even now.)
---
**2. Designing problematic cards, and the lack of acknowledging those cards as problems from the dev team. (With nerfs)**
---
The meta was usually okay and fun for me. But they always manage to somehow give us some cards that just ruin the otherwise good and fun meta.
---
Karazhan had shamanstone. Patches was a general problem that was only adressed like 2 months before it would have rotated out anyway. Keleseth is also a card that if played on curve increases your winrate by like 20%. Barnes is also not okay, it's just BS that you can summon a 10 drop on 4 and then revive it and often just win the game. Like it's not okay to print cards like this with the only balancing factor being that you won't always draw them on curve.
---
And I could still list many examples, the point is, they don't act fast enough when there is an obvious problem, and sometimes just don't act at all. And recently they are not even adressing the actual problems (like UI and spreading plague that just delete the disadvantage of druid, instead they destroy their identity) they are just nerfing classic/basic set cards that were fine for years.
---
These two are the main issues I have.
---
TL;DR, There are no new game modes or significant features, it doesn't feel like the game is changing in a good direction or improving in any way. They always print problematic cards that just make the game not fun, and don't act on time, or don't act at all. So Hearthstone is becoming less fun. 
---
And vegans are happy
---
There's definitely people trying to figure pricing out, but i don't think it's an exact science. You have to wonder why other games give you more value for your money, while they obviously want to make as much as possible too.
---
It seems to me that blizzard has kinda decided to do this high cost low reward type monetization in all of their games. Looking at the wow and heroes shop back in the day, i always wondered why i'd spend like 25$ on ONE skin/mount. Seems like their system might be built on getting the most out of whales.
---
But then you look at like, league of legends and such (and they obviously makes TONS of money) where they're much more generous, and you get more for your money, and you have to think that that's at least close to as good as blizzard's model.
---
weird flex.

---
Yeah 2 balance changes... Did they make the game more enjoyable? For me it's clearly no. I would even say it's worse.
---
new game modes. or better said, more ways to play a game.
---
I always said, even in times of Shamanstone or Druidstone - primary problem is not that constructed ranked has high concentration of one class. Problem is there is no way to do other thing with your cards but to play constructed (Arena is draft game mode). There is no way to play tournaments in client. There is no Arcade and Custom games like Overwatch has, and i have no idea what is the problem of copying that 100% (saying it is splitting playerbase is moronic, considering they solved it in Arcade by rotating formats and custom games you do with friends, so that can have eg. ALL Tavern Brawls to be selected from). 
---
HS isn't main game, because people did everything but competed in HS esport, and that's simply not for anyone but relatively few players. Even more so, they dont even support hs esport AT ALL in client, too (no game history, no replays, no ingame spectating tournaments), spectator mode is bare minimum.
---
**what would get you back**: Doing more than releasing new cards set 3 times a year.
---
[I spent $1000 on the game with four months of daily play and only had obtained 75% of a Standard playset](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aeglv6/ive_been_playing_hearthstone_daily_for_four/), but because I compared it to Artifact (and had blatantly lied about being new to HS in another unrelated thread, and admitted this, but Reddit button-clickers rendered this invisible) people brought out the pitchforks in defense of Blizzard. Nothing will ever change.
---
A third format, slightly larger expansions and better designed tech cards. If we get bigger expansions I'd like to see the classic set leave standard but have the basic set stay.

Oh fu--?????? It isn't real? I was about to come out of hiatus for that!
---
You're comparing HS 6 expansions + Classic to Artifact's base set.
---
Artifact is cheap because the game died. It dropped from 60K players concurrent to under 1000 peak. So the marketplace is flooded with cards no one wants to buy.
---
Artifact has an even worse monetization model where you have to buy all your cards (no free cards to grind/reward) as well as pay to play expert mode. *based on release
---
Either way, all card games are the biggest ripoffs. Just because the units are rectangles, they can get away with selling everything as lootboxes. - "But hey it's cheaper than MTG"

- Nerfs to (problematic/frustrating) cards and/or strategies don't happen enough. Buffs also never happened before
---
- Epic and legendary cards cost too much dust for how many I need to build for some decks
---
- Better optimization for the PC client. Game runs better on my phone (wtf?)
---
- More alternative heroes at a reasonable price. 10 bucks is **not** reasonable.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Trades out 2 shadow steps and a sap for 1 more Coirsair, an Edwin, and a Deadly Poison. Shadow Step didn't do much. Deadly becomes really good with both weapons, and it heals you more for leeching. It also hits 5 attack on your weapons, which is a pretty big deal - that means you can take care of the common 5/5 stat line with a weapon. It also adds more face damage too, especially with Assassins Blade. 
---
This is literally how markets function. A transaction only happens when both parties believe they're getting their money's worth. The only exception to this would be a monopoly where people have no alternatives to switch to. Whether for pure reasons (truly feeling that they're getting what they're paying for), or impure ones (eg. fuelling a gambling/gaming addiction) everyone who has bought cardpacks confirmed that the transaction was 'fair' (at least at the time) through the mere act of buying them.
---
Having to play spells to heal up also negates the card advantage downside.
---
Additionally, warlocks will lifetap basically every game, yet the healing is limited to a few card in the deck which you might not always draw when you need them.
---
this is awesome, i'd buy those.
---
&gt;And more hero skins would be nice. A lot more
---
And bring back Tyrande while you're at it, considering there were countries that weren't even able to get it even if they wanted to during the limited window it was available.
---
Plus the skin section of the shop has had only Magni, Alleria and Medivh in it *for 3.5 years.*
---
why hall of fame basic/standard card when you can just nerf the shit out of them (insert taping forehead guy meme)
---
Hearthstone autochess Kappa
---
I could see them rotating \[\[Wild Pyromancer\]\] and/or \[\[Acolyte of Pain\]\]. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They've both seen play in at least 1 deck for pretty much every meta since beta. I don't think there's a problem with their power level but I could see Blizzard disliking their ubiquity.
---
Honourable mention goes to \[\[Doomsayer\]\] for similar reasons, though it's been less prevalent this year so I think it's less likely to be moved to HoF.
---
Yes
---
I play him simply because I don't have Myra RotSpring but I have him.
---
It's not that bad, when it eats a big minion. I had it eat a buffed Harrison, skyrocketing his stats to 9/7. 
---
What about it?
---
in-game tournament spectate would be great. also a tournament mode, not because I play in tournaments, but having followed the tournament scene, I believe that having everything under the control of the blizzard game client is much better than using multiple third party softwares/websites to manage tournaments.
---
Why?
---
Wow, just wow
---
Full agreement on this one! Especially right now it's a chore to get all epics. Legendaries are somewhat fair since the no-duplicate-rule - but you can have every legendary from packs and easily still miss some epics.
---
Ahh i see the problem ...... you're not a paladin

**HEARTHSTONE 2!**
---
Time to sort out all spaghetti code as well as implement all the QOL demands by the long time players. Along with this, some slight/minor upgrades to the UI could also be implemented, although its damn near perfect as is.
---
But this shouldn't cause everyone to start building their collection from scratch. NO. Everyone should have the same collection they originally had under the old Hearthstone app. Otherwise, you'll end up losing your loyal existing fanbase.
---
We need an in app mechanism/mode for more community engagement. Theres many ways this could be done, for example something like Pokémon go where you receive a notification if theres another Hearthstone player in the real world vicinity who has their privacy options toggled to allow detection. Or public lobbies for casual games. Ideally this mode should be something that interests the casual community but also be one that keeps hardcore players engaged. Ideally, such a mode would also allow Blizzard to identify/separate botters from the real players.
---
**TOURNAMENT MODE!**
---
I'm told hardcore players want this very much. But as a casual whale, I'm not particularly invested in this. But what might catch my attention is if interesting things happen that are unique within the mode.  It must also be something that i feel invested in following. 
---
Don’t forget to tip your Tauren 
---
Glad to hear it man, see you on the ladder! 
---
How could druid choice be interesting when druid is braindead cancer
---
Bewbs. She recently acquired a top. However here, she's feeling a little more.. Open. 
---
Not surprised, Deathspeaker is almost always useful in arena. Mosh'Ogg isn't too bad either. Longneck is definitely to be avoided here.
---
I'd like an unnerfed wild format; i.e. wild but with every nerf throughout the course of the game post-release reverted. Whenever there's a balance update, it's made with standard in mind without considering wild at all.
---
Also, more support for wild in general. In MtG, modern and legacy are beloved formats despite everything, in large part due to organised play and tournaments actually including those formats. In Hearthstone, Wild is treated as nothing more but the place cards are put when Blizzard does not want players to play with them anymore.
---
Although I have never been an achievement hunter, this makes so much sense.
---
The limits (500 wins for Gold) and Level 60 made sense for the base game. Neither has since been touched - they might as well remove them.
---
What I would like most is a rotating standard set, like the Tavern Brawl we had not too long ago, e.g. March only Un'Goro and Mean Streets, April only TGT and Boomsday, etc. Everyone agrees the best time in Hearthstone is before the meta has settled and this way, the meta would never really settle before being shuffled again.

He chose the “Trump” nickname as a teenager simply because he got a kick out of Donald J. Trump’s showy management style on The Apprentice.

Sprinkle some lemon juice over it and thank me later
---
3-3 for 3 ..... great stats for a 3 drop is 3-4 so already doing ok. 
---
More of a problem in arena, but the idea of having multiple minions surviving on the board is you're doing well, potentially even winning. 
---
So its incredibly disheartening to see that 25% chance of killing off your strongest minion, ignoring deathrattles, and then summon you're strongest minion. Again all for 3 mana. 
---
Very very swingy for such a cheap minion. 
---
Genn and Baku...
---
I don't believe, they will stay in Standard for another year tbh. If so, I'm sure, that Odd and Even Decks will totally dominate again after rotation, because Hunter and Priest will lose almost everything, which is viable. 
---
HS loses some of its shine when you play mostly meta decks. That's why Arena is so great, decks are different. I would really love a mode where you start collecting from zero and make the best deck you can with the cards you have. The run could last 2 weeks or a month, idk. Like the streamers event they made where they could not craft cards and were playing from what they opened in the packs. 
---
for the downvoters
---
&gt; **don't log in from another PC into your** [**Battle.net**](https://battle.net/) **account** \- you're gonna regret it... 
---
To be fair: changing your password, logging onto another PC with the new password, hitting legend, then changing the password back and logging in with a different IP seems really sketchy.
---
oh fuck its time for gamers to rise up
---
(I forgot to mention that the action starts near 4:40 but it was my 1st post here I think and I am not sure where to edit my post to add it - sorry for that guys and have a nice day!)
---
I would say, as a player who bought all adventure, and doesn't play everyday, that the problem with HS right now is that you don't get enough for your $$. Adventures were great value, and no gambling. Compared to that, expansions are 10 times more expensive and is not sustainable for a side game.
---
Otherwise, what could help is an unranked mode with all the cards unlocked. Maybe pay 100g (or any reasonable amount of gold) to get a weekly pass at this new game mode that let you build any deck with any cards. That would let us experiment with the meta decks or joke decks and let us decide if we want to spend dust there.
---
Um.... no
---
Achievements to earn cardbacks/heroes. 
---
As a cardback/skin-collector I would love to see some real challenges that would reward you with something to show off to other people online. Something that make other players go "okay this guy’s actually gone through a real challenge to get this cardback/hero". 
---
Blizzard did this pretty good in WoW with all the Titles earned by completing achievements, imo. 
---
I love the old heroic cardbacks and all that stuff, but there’s really nothing special about that. The only things in the game that got that kind of effect on me atleast is the tournament cardbacks, but those are way too unacquirable for "casuals".  The Legend cardbacks was also kind off awesome before I reached the rank myself, now it’s just "meh"..
---
Shit, you got me; can we now talk about what my whole argument was? I mean I'm writing without giving it too much thought, mistakes can be made
---
Mosh'ogg seems insane, I don't play arena but I watch every kripp upload lol
---
I love arena but I am about average so I usually go around 3-4 wins. And loosing in the arena can be really frustrating. Because most of the time it's not a toe to toe fight that you just barely lost. When you loose you usually get roflstomped into the ground. Even when you have a really good deck (or at least you think you do) you can get a bad draw or your opponent has just a god tier deck and there is no thing you can do. 
---
The larger issue is that they move at a glacial pace. 
---
Anything that would help HS with user retention should have been in the works for a year now. 
---
I understand human nature and how people get conservative with changes when you're being wildly successful ("if it ain't broke, don't fix it) ... but this mindset his permeated every aspect of this game for too long. 
---
It's about 100 dust on average, including the possibility of getting legendaries and goldens, of course - but not including the non-duplicate cards you're getting, even though those worth more.
---
It's only sold as a "pack" to make people think they're getting more than they really do - by exploiting gambling addiction and misinformation.
---
To me it's not about modes, it's about deck diversity. I need to be able to craft multiple decks and see multiple decks been played. In the last two years I played, it was almost always the same (often unfunny, see Big Priest) decks. That made me quit.
---
Yeah it's decent stats and it gets really funny if you get lucky and they can't trade into it XD
---
Jesus Christ yall are all horny for drawings again 
---
but was the last card left mind control?
---
I don't mind infinite value cards but when it's literally one card that does it (JADE IDOL REXXAR) there's a problem.  These cards are fine if they have a huge downside like Jaraxxus.
---
Since my original comment was buried in the thread and I don't use twitter, I'll just copy it here:
---
It basically boils down to anything to do besides queuing into ranked mode. It's ranked mode, where you feel staleness of the meta the most. Casual is supposed to be a second mode, but falls short of its promise, as people largely run the same decks and the incentives of getting to rank 5 for dust are missing.
---
Some good ideas for this include
---
1. A new mode entirely. I like Frodan's suggestion of a 2v2 mode. In WC3 playing 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 was always very fun and made for a very different experience. I think those modes also tend to be more casual and I would guess even if you made a 2v2 ladder, there would still be much less effort (in both playtime and analysis) to solve its meta. So this way it stays more interesting.
---
2. An easy to use mode to set up tournaments and leagues. I participate in the Call of the Wild league whenever it is on and it is a lot of fun, since it has a different meta from regular ranked play. You can also rid yourself of a "cancer" deck of your choice by just banning it or in the case of CotW, where Strike is played you can almost do that
---
3. Another mode building on either wild or standard that has cardchoice restrictions. For example we could have a "Restricted" version of wild and standard, where 10 cards are banned each month (maybe those are even determined by player vote?). Basically it's another interesting iteration of a secondary format with a different meta. It also seems rather easy to implement, as you can copy all the existing ladder structure for this mode and bannings have already been implemented in tavern brawl and arena.
---
4. In a similar manner to suggestion three, one could also have some hodgepodge format, where something like 4-5 expansions are chosen each month and those make up the allowed cardpool. One could take 2 standard + 2 wild expansions each time to make for an interesting mix. An obvious choice might be to always take the current expansion as one of the two standard expansions.
---
5. Achievements for PvP and/or PvE content. Just a simple way to give people stuff to play towards and make some meme cards more interesting. Small incentives (e.g. some gold or dust) could be given as well. It's a really easy way to stretch existing content into more content.
---
6. Similar to the previous one, extending the levelmax for classes from 60 to some higher number and giving some incentives for the higher levels would also be a great start.
---
7. Some evergreen tavernbrawl(s). In addition to the current tavern brawl we could have a monthly selection of 3 all time favorites. There are some brawls I just can't get enough of and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Naturally one would need to decide for some really good brawls here.
---
Lol
---
Yes. The legendary was very nice, but I had already played for a while, so the 10 classic packs I got were mostly useless.
---
There is some cool stuff in the Blizzard store if you want to go down that road

---
Other than that what is your argument?
---
This is why I'm bad at arena lmao 
---
You have to read internet to know it is no snek
---
A significant improvement in the epic economy. A game mode for fun with no meta shit. Dunno who to implement that, but damn would I like to have one. The removal of Baku, Gen and DKs from the game with an official written apology.
---
Porbably nothing at this point. I've played this game for years, and honestly Hearthstone feels like it has reached its sunset for me. I found out about Magic: The Gathering Arena and after playing a few games, I haven't looked back since.
---
It's nothing against hearthstone, I love hearthstone and always will. It's just reached its end in entertainment for me. My thousands of hours were well spent, it's just time for me to move on.
---
I mean, it is better than 2x deathwing
---
Just do a day of the Volcanosaur sort of thing. 
---
1) In client tournaments  
---
2) Gamemode where I can play every card as it was released.   
---
3) Release more interesting cards; the last set was horribly uninspired. The article on their design process for the new cards makes it clear that they have lots of good idea but often reject them in favour of more conservative choices, for example Self damage hero power buffing Zuljin vs hero Yogg without the randomness.  
---
4) A viable control hunter deck running Acidmaw, Gazhrilla, Dred, Krush and Emeriss. It would be glorious. 
---
Hopefully getting shipped to the Hall of Fame where we won't have to deal with his oppression in standard anymore.
---
I think getting rid of duplicate Epics would go a long way towards making players happy.  Most decks require multiple copies of Epics and they print so many each expansion that the odds of getting the 2 you want are low so you end up crafting them, which feels bad because to do so you had to dust 5 copies of some other useless Epic.
---
Moral of the story? Don't buy Legend boosts. You'll get banned and have to concoct a ridiculous story to pretend like you didn't buy a boost, and you still won't get your account back. 
---
This game should be more about deck building, and I think they could solve that problem by just making a best of three system where you actually can sideboard in cards for certain archetypes rather than playing meta deck versus meta deck.
---
r/OutofTheLoop Jaina got a shirt?
---
If I got that kind of bundle for a new expansion, I probably would've been it a lot more satisfied.
---
It's all about the bodies mate. MoshOgg is a great body, do t get me wrong, but Deathspeaker let's a body you already have on the board get a beautiful trade, so creates much more tempo. If you watch Kripp, you'll get better, but only with practice. Don't be scared of failing the first fifty times or so, the payoff is having fun in a better game mode.
---
Toast, melted butter, avocado, cherry tomatoes, creme fraiche, lemon-pepper, and sweet chili sauce is a godly sandwich
---
I haven't played Hearthstone as my main game in ages. It was mostly the childish aspect that drove me away. I wasn't pleased with the direction of Goblins vs Gnomes, but Naxxramas and Blackrock Mountain made up for it. 
---
After that, it just devolved... Grand Tournament, Explorers League, One Night in Karazhan, Mean Streets, Witchwood, Kobolds &amp; Catacombs... You have SO much flavour and so many amazing characters to choose from in the Warcraft Universe, but you opt for this silly, childish, and almost disney-like direction with all the musical animated trailers which is ultimately losing you fans.
---
We want Blackrock Mountain. We want Naxxramas. We want Whispers of the Old Gods. There's a reason Knights of the Frozen Throne was one of the most popular expansions ever; it was because it had the LICH KING. That expansion proved that you can have HUMOUR and silliness while still having KEY Warcraft characters. Why the hell did our Netherstorm/TBC expansion have to be The Boomsday Project...? Nobody wanted that.  
---

1-mana hero power is unfair, not because it can be used on every turn, but because it can be used on all turns
---
Snake totem is best totem. OP is asshole
---
I haven't played in a while (somethink like... 6 months maybe?) I was a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! player before HS, and quit YGO because of the game getting to expensive, and not being from the US make it even worse.
---
Hearthstone was a god send, regional pricing, and solid online make it something great to get my TCG/CCG dose without suffering the issues of a physical one.
---
But what drove me away was the lack of variance. Mostly because of the class system. 
---
I know this is fundamental to the game and impossible to change, but that was my issue... with HS and some other games like Shadowverse.
---
most TCG games have the appeal (at least for me) that you read a card and think "uh, let's build a crazy deck around it", you start brewing a crazy deck and have fun, I am having a blast with MtG: Arena beacause of this, I got a couple of Mirror Marche and start building crazy shit.
---
In HS I feel I can't do that, I put a crazy card, put the class staples and I don't have much left to imagination, maybe 6 or 7 under used cards and the rest is the same as everyone playing Mage or Druid.
---
Maybe I would come back if a could mix two classes? I know it would be a NIGHTMARE to balance or build, but new classes that mix to of the original ones might be crazy fun (I think that there was a brawl like this).
---
The rest that I can think would change the game to much and won't happen, like rising the size of the deck or things like that...
---
Sorry if my english is wierd, it's not my first language.
---
Hate to say it, but this is exactly what all tcg people experience. The issue with digital is no selling or trading (which would break anyway so they have reason NOT to)
---
Inb4 Blizzard actually decides to HoF Baku and Genn.
---
fucking socialism, man (/s)
---
Counterpoint: Genn should be bundled with Baku, because games that are centered around the hero power are bad.
---
Yeah people are speaking like there's an objective value-o-meter that determines for everyone if a purchase is worth it or not. It's gonna change between people. I'll probably preorder because I play a good amount of Hearthstone. The $50 spent there will bring me more enjoyment than spending $50 on whatever AAA game people want to bring up. If people feel like they'll get more value out of that AAA game, I encourage them to spend their money there then.
---
That brawl was so refreshing for a while! It kinda got solved eventually with the huge Mech Core that most decks were built out of, but hey it would be fine for a month. 
---
It's no fun if you don't have a hidden motive :P  
---
I'm not who you addressed the question to, but could we get more progression stuff? Capping the level to 60 and win rewards to 500 makes you lose some feeling of progress after you hit that. I know I'm a minority in having all classes over 500, but still it would be nice to feel like I'm progressing at something when I queue into ladder.  
---
Maybe it's too much, or too niche to ask for something after 500 wins (even 1000 wouldn't help much since I already have 7 at 950+ :D), but a profile/stats page would be nice. The monthly emails were at least something, and even they have stopped. It would be nice to see those stats without the email, and to have them all all the time. You could just list the stuff there like, "standard ranked wins", "winstreak", "daily quests", "peak rank" (more detailed than just legend), and all the rest per season and also be able to see your personal best ever. That way if nothing else then you can always try and beat your personal best at those stats each season.

Auto chess is a game mod of a game mod of warcraft 3, so technically it could be a heroes of warcraft game.
---
I’m just speculating with that remark based on posters here who gloat about never having spent a cent on HS as if being chained to daily quests for years to gradually, barely amass a decent collection is somehow noble. I will never understand those who value their time at zero.
---
I feel like this will never happen unfortunately for multiple reasons:
---
* 'Too confusing for new players' if they have to re-add wild packs to the shop.
---
* A bunch of people will complain who either weren't around during past expansions, or dusted all their wild cards.
---
* Split the player base up into too many modes as the player base decreases and you'll get issues with long queue times (like HOTS).
---
* Based on what Blizzard has said in the past, they're going to remove some old content from the game to stop the mobile download from ballooning in size overtime with all the new expansions. Needing to force everyone to download a bunch of wild content for a new mode goes against that goal.
---
Make it easier for F2P card acquisition. Do one of the 3: add dust into rewards like the recent quests, increase gold rate for first few wins daily, or do the weekly quest like MTGA has where you earn up to 3 extra packs a week. 
---
Then, increase the amount of custom cosmetics that can be purchased with money. Some ideas: custom emotes for standard heroes, custom boards, spell effects on basic cards, music tracks.
---
That’s not at all what I’ve been saying. 
---
Oh for sure. I just don't play much cuz I spend my gold on packs lol oops. 
---
I'll keep at it! :)
---
Why IseeDrunkPeople hate?
---
I've bought adventures, welcome bundles and bundles where you get 3 packs per &lt;2 dollars/euros.
---
I think those are the only correctly priced things. But buying those has got me enough stuff to play a lot of different decks both in wild and standard assuming I actively roll and complete quests and do events.
---
I think one important thing for hearthstone economy would be making arena reward you a pack voucher instead of the newest pack. I want to save gold for the next expansion which means that I can't play arena unless I can go infinite, which I can't.
---
I say we just remove OP's eyes and head instead. 
---
I don't see how whether it's your first bundle or not is dependent on the expected outcome of 10 classic packs + legendary
---
She's dressed for a night out, not a "Horde, out!" buddy
---
The same way we all do, buy more packs
---
I don't mind either, but if you bring up principal concerns against overly consistent value, you can't use it on Baku and not on Genn. At least historically, extreme late game value is only relevant for a fraction of decks anyway.
---
Let’s make some things clear here. $406 is not some paltry amount of money but spending $406 over the course of a few years definitely does not make you a whale. Maybe a dolphin depending on how long you’ve played HS.
---
If you really want to gut blizzards profits, the ones who should cease spending aren’t the light P2P players like you but the actual whales that drop thousands per year on the game. Like every other f2p lootbox oriented game, HS revenue follows the 80-20 rule whereby a large percentage of the profits stem from an exceedingly small group of players (whales). The whales themselves are what allows the game to even be f2p and in a sense, fund the game for strictly f2p players.
---
Playing with an old ragnaros in big priest : (
---
Let's be honest here: They moved away from Adventures because they make way more money with Expansions.
---
When Adventures were shelved, ONiK actually outperformed the previous adventure, meaning they axed a feature when it was actually selling quite well.
---
Adventures had an upper limit of $25 USD whereas spending $60 on a pre-order for an expansions wouldn't even give you 50% of the entire set.
---
I'm not an expert at all but isn't tournaments meta different because players know others' complete decklists and prepare accordingly. Won't this be same as ladder this way. 
---
Yikes

"We're seeing a high playrate of OTK Mind Blast Priest right now, so in order to address the OTK possibilities with Mind Blast and Malygos, we're making Twilight Drake cost 6 mana.  We feel this will reduce the playrate and reliance on Dragon based decks and as a result, we expect Firetree Witchdoctor to see less play, resulting in less of a reach of Mind Blast Priest."
---
You kill them first. That's the counterplay.
---
Message me and I'll add you and play vs you and give it to you
---
&gt;and the former implies that Blizzard is too incompetent to maximize their profit even though they probably pay people to figure this exact stuff out.
---
I am sure there was people paid to figure out how to maximize the profits for Battlefield 5 and Fallout 76 as well, and look where those "maximization's" got them.
---
Greedy anti consumer behavior might yield higher short term profits (as long as you have done well in the past and have accumulated good will, but good will won´t last long when it is apparent that the company has non of that back towards their consumers), but in the long run that obviously will run it into the ground.
---
The exception seems to be the FIFA games, probably due to the sheer lack of competition, almost feel bad for the people that enjoys those games because they are being fucked monetary over and over again. 
---
Thank you! I've actually been wondering about whether people read or enjoy them at all, especially since I do spend a lot of time researching and writing for some of them.
---
The ones such as today's are particularly tricky, and I've been rewording large parts of it throughout the evening, trying to be as neutral and fair as possible.

“Your Opponent” Smh
---
I paid approx. 500 $ for bundles and expansions on 2 or 3 different accounts since Hearthstone release and I must say that I am fucking done. I just barely finished lately crafting every usable classic legendary but I still miss about 15 competitive legendaries from witchwood, boomsday and rastakhans. I won't even count  epics. This is such a bullshit and I am fucking done with it. By this time I could write better version of Hearthstone, release and play it instead. Thinking about selling my account on ebay and moving forward. Last games from Activision shit I am waiting for are War3 Reforged and Classic Wow. If they will fuck this up as well, I am finally done with company.

Unexpected /r/nba 🐍

That really depends on what you plan on playing. Jan'alai is a must have in Odd Mage. Control and aggro version. And the deck will be there as long as Baku is in standard. The only real problem could be Dragon's Fury rotating out for the control version. 
---
But the deck is highly competitive to im sitting at 150 Legend right now with Odd Control Mage. So ask yourself if you want to spend the dust or not.
---
I made a ton of suggestions the last years, but most of them are never heard or read by any blizzard employee and the fact that you asked this question and not /u/IksarHS sets the same signal as it was all the time.
---
One guy can not find a solution for it, a community could craft a lot of ideas, but as mentioned above I never got enough positive feedback for it - the opposite was the case, all suggestions were downvoted to hell. In any case it's Blizzard's job to find a solution for this but I have not seen anything since the release of Hearthstone that Blizzard will change the star system into a more complex one.
---
HS is no longer a "young game" and if they did not do it the last 5 years I doubt it will happen the next 5 years. That's why they lost a whale and HS is no longer my maingame anymore.

Not literally 0 counterplay. All classes have the option of setting their health to &lt;=4 or playing one of the following:

\- \[\[Hoarding dragon\]\]

\- \[\[nerubian unraveler\]\]

\- \[\[the beast\]\]

\- \[\[Hakkar, the Soulflayer\]\]

&gt; but just because they've hired people to do this doesn't mean those people are always right.

No offense but those people with real, practical experience in financials/economic background are STRICTLY going to make a better decision that is in the best interest of their employer than a random redditor is......

More modes. Tournament, sealed, proper draft, block,  singleton witz bigger decks. All those things that spice  MTG so much. It needs to provide more for the player that isn't just into ladder grind

As someone who has been playing since the closed beta and has recently dropped HS altogether for other games, more mechanical depth would be nice. Controlled discard introduced in RR was nice, but things like deck manipulation, revealing cards from the opponent's hand/deck, return of multi-class cards, etc. Also no more silly infinite-value cards like Rexxar or Jaina, so the resource-management part of the game can be more relevant again.
---
Magic is a game that I only play on and off, but every time I jump back in it feels new thanks to how many new mechanics they introduce from set to set.
---
A couple of days
---
They know the others complete decklists after everyone submits their decklists.
---
Think about it this way: imagine 30% of the meta is Odd Paladin. All the other decks are teching against it (like spirit lash, dreadlord, dragonmaw, whirlwind) - cards that doens't make sense in other matchups, but are there to increase their chances against odd paladin.
---
In a tournament you could just ban odd paladin and either change your techs or play more cards to support your gameplan.
---
For the same reason, some decks are viable for ladder and terrible for tournaments and vice-versa.
---
Um you forget that he must of devoted so much to get that big a Hireek
---
Northshire Cleric has always seen play. Frostbolt has always seen play. Truesilver Champion has always seen play. It's ok for classes to have core basic cards that define the class and always make it into decks. 
---
It's mostly been said down below - but in my view they need more formats.
---
It seems like a missed trick that they only have Standard and Wild at the moment. I'm not an MTG player but have heard from others that MTG does multiple formats well. Hearthstone is just missing the opportunity here.
---
Pitcure this - Heathstone has a format for every possible expansion combination released since the beginning. Naxx + GVG, Naxx + Boomsday, Witchwood + TGT, Frozen Throne + Black Rock Mountain. You name a pairing, and there's a place that you can ladder with it!...
---
... Okay maybe that's slightly overkill, as it would be hard to balance that many and would probably lead to others being sharply underpopulated. But my point still stands. The amount of variety to be gained from offering parallel formats is huge. It could make Hearthstone stay *seriously* fresh.
---
If there was a mode to play people with the shrines and you could make your own deck or draft it like in the Rumble I would only ever play that mode. 
---
My first and only 2 matches against a real player had them playing nothing but legendary cards against my shit starting deck... Game is p2w no matter how you look at it.
---
same here lol
---
Please blizz no more OTK
---
Oh yea the amount I used to spend on Hearthstone I was fine with it, I would usually get the pre-order pack once per expansion and the occasional arena ticket, for me that was worth the amount of time I put in. Lately I dont have time to put into Hearthstone to make the money worth it however.
---
using deck trackers is cheating and takes away a layer of depth of the game. its a handicap that is allowed, simply because gamers now a days enjoy handicaps.
---
your brain is the most powerful tool as it can calculate hundreds/thousands of calculations at once if trained enough. guess people don't train their brain and need to rely on a robot to tell them where a card is in a hand of 1-10.
---
You cant see a difference between the two pictures???
---
Avocados are native to Central America, but have been cultivated and consumed all across the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Until very recently, outside of areas with high concentration of CA/SA/Carri immigrants in the US, avocados were also unknown and rare. It popularized very quickly once the general public started tasting it, due to its very creamy texture and unique pungent flavor.
---
Do you have a video of this?
---
The problem is that you would need to program the AI to consider future turns and to understand the nuances behind certain decks. It does no good to practice against a Holy Wrath Paladin deck that plays holy wrath on turn 5, or a Clone Priest that coins out a mind blast.
---
Now you're understanding why Blizzard shelved it.  Their vision and the community's vision (or lack thereof) were so very different.
---
I have been seeing this bug as well as of late. Perhaps only once every 15-20 games, but it is there.
---
Previously, it would show the 'you have been disconnected screen', so you could force-restart the game or try to toggle your internet connectivity, but now you basically have to keep track of how long your opponent's turn has been and proactively restart the game.
---
Unfortunately, I haven't seen a solution for this yet.
---
I started playing 3 months ago, there's absolutely no way for me to accumulate that many Wild cards. This mode would be completely inaccessible not just to very new players, but anyone that started playing after the very first rotation.
---
how is it disgusting
---
The thing is, for it to be really good it needs to absorb quite some buffs that you don't get on your other minions. Most hand buffs are single card buffs so every buff Hi'reek gets, another card that you want to play doesn't.
---
you know avocado consumption is not an art form, its just food.
---
Hmm fuck druid or fuck otk decks...
---
I actually thiught that totem was some kind of snake up until now.
---
Maybe, maybe not depends on a few variables.
---
On the otherhand not everythibg should be new player focused. Whilst I agree completely that there needs to be stuff for new players I think there should also be content for older players as well.
---
I also think Blizzard should sell old sets at a discount but that is another issue entirely
---
Good in theory, but games were pretty much decided by whoever had a better tempo in the first three turns. 
---
Well, Frost Lich Jaina also needs a shirt.  She is definitely OUT THERE.
---
I knew it was never going to be a mode. I think a lot of people knew that if they put in a “tournament mode” it wouldn’t be satisfactory no matter what they did. They keep asking for it but they don’t know what they want, they just say it and it’s a meme at this point.
---
The best thing they can do at the moment is to design new formats to keep things fresh when the Standard meta is stale.
---
I'm sure everyone will have fully understood what you meant, but thought I'd just mention that 'prize' is like a reward, so you would mean 'price'. Apologies if this came off patronising at all, just trying to help out for next time!
---
redo jaina's chest
---
I'd guess that he drew and played one of the shuffled copies
---
I have faced this issue 10-15 times at least , that too mostly on ranked. Even posted here but got downvoted. Please reply to my comment if someone tells you the fix it you are able to raise a bug report.
---
Cost me a few, as well. iOS iphoneX
---
Welcome to the club.  Breathe the free air once again.
---
I never even realized that wasn't the totem's face
---
Well this is the case for almost any deck since they decided to create huge polarization.
---
[[Bloodmage Thalnos]] is a card people barely even know about, but it fits well in pretty much any deck.
---
By now, the murloc is the totem.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be

Just gonna [link this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/aqzyiu/a_beginners_guide_to_open_hearthstone_tournaments/) explaining all the hoops players currently have to jump through in order to enjoy an aspect of hearthstone team 5 *loves* to brag about but hates to support.
---
Adding some special game modes would be cool. 
---
Pauper (can only use commons and rares)
---
Modes with rotating expansions (one month classic, GVG, MSOG, Boomsday)
---
How is there not internal statistics? Seriously, it is 2019. I can't see my winrate vs each class? I can't see how often I have played a certain card? I can't see my average game time?
---
There is no way for me to get value out of grumble or shudderwok or (for me personally, though can be played in other decks) zola for my midrange shaman that got nerfed (giggling inventor) or combo shudderwok that I made after (saronite).  Same thing happened for non-wild players using kingsbane.  Kingsbane wasn't nerfed but leeching poison made the deck so by leeching it, RIP the deck and no dust refund for the players.  Hope this makes sense.
---
Good point
---
Everyone hates Americas current health care system but no one agrees on an alternative.
---
That's why it's the best solution and should absolutely not change.
---
Symmetry appreciated. 
---
I still don't see it. Can somebody help me out here?
---
So it's time to choose now?  I didn't see a post about this yet but gotta get in on the packs!

but it IS free to play and it ISNT T rated, its actually rated ages 7 and above

I think I see why you don't get the argument. So let me try it this way (I promise, it's not me being facetious)  :
---
Why is it wrong for a fictional character who was wearing cleavage to not wear it anymore ? 
---
As a new(er) player I never heard of this and found this post interesting as well as very well written.  Sounds like a lot of drama haha but really leaves me with a lot of questions like what was the big issue ultimately?!?! and did she rip people off or what?
---
* Improved player agency (I want my turns to matter)
---
* Viable control decks that don’t rely on a combo finisher
---
* A permenant game mode that encourages fun decks without meta decks
---
* A way to try out cards / decks before commiting months worth of F2P gold / dust
---
* Nerf Barnes
---
More **fun** RNG cards (cards like Evolve, Yogg, Academic Espionage, Elises, etc). Less boring cards and mechanics (Rush, +1/1, summon 1/1 tokens, etc).
---
I agree, that's currently the biggest problem with handbuff warlock.
---
However that's easily fixed if some more "buff all"-cards like arena fanatic get released.
---
i enjoy playing the game,but not climbing the ladder,especially for the last year or so
---
i would love to play tournament format in game with my friend or stranger without the hassle it currently have
---
also it potentiall help all the tournament organizer and pro player
---
but im indifferent about it,if it got implemented ill definitelly play more hearthstone,if its not the ill just play another game that i enjoy instead of hearthstone,simple as that
---
Gotten it plenty on times. I once made a meme murlock priest that carried me to rank 18 ready AF last season. 
---
We have exactly the same story. I never spend real cash anymore. It's drives me nuts that $50 every 3 months and I still can't pull together an evolve deck for funsies. So, fuck it, I just save up close to 5000 gold in dailys and just go with that. 
---
Probably the best card from the set. Why do you even ask?
---
why didnt they nerf lunara if they nerfed jaina
---
It is one of the quests I think you only can complete once.  
---
moistquae#1283 NA, check both then you go first
---
I disagree completely. Detective_Kappa was the peak of drama. 
---
It would help if the variety of viable decks weren't constrained so much, so you could at least make something fun and effective to play in ranked without having to craft *exactly* the right set of 'good' legendaries and epics.
---
Except he wasn’t playing mechathun lmao it’s so obvious why would he have an aggro pally with mecha in it
---
Majority of the cards that should have been hall of famed this time around were nerfed, so, I wouldn't expect many, if any cards to go into the hall of fame. 
---
No this is wrong. Gotten in a few times.
---
[[Violet Wyrm]]
---
Why can't it be both? I honestly think if this game is to remain (or return?) significant, they need to both restructure the crafting system and make pre-orders better. Also possibly better single-player campaigns, like they used to.

---
Nothing. You'd have to completely redesign hearthstone from the ground up. It's too simple and childish in general, throw in the fact it's over priced, why would I stick around?
---
Tournament mode. As a former semipro Magic player whose life got too busy for FNMs and the PTQ grind, I got drawn to Hearthstone because of its best-in-class mobile play (though that’s more an indictment of mobile TCG play than anything). I’d happily spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon once a month queueing for tournies, and then I’d be back to playing daily in the ladder grind as I practice for those tournaments. 
---
1. Tavern Brawl all week instead of a set time
---
2. Tournament mode
---
3. Be more forgiving on rate of obtaining cards/dust for the ability to try new decks.
---
Biggest thing I love in card games is making stupid decks. Hearthstone actively blocks me from doing that by being so stingy in its rewards. I used to spend occasional cash on hearthstone but with lack of changes to the business model and lack of changes to anything in the client - and other games being far more willing to nerf cards and hold onto their players - I got bored and left, and am now playing Faeria and much happier.
---
Yeah, basically.
---
Just wanted to celebrate a first attempt win and show off this absurd deck I wound up with!
---
(I attempted once before but conceded the first game immediately because I realized I picked a horrible Shrine lol.)
---
The deck had FOUR Radient Elementals, and tons of low cost spells that gave me some ridiculous spell combos. My hand basically permanently had 9-10 cards.
---
In one game, the Tome gave me THREE Velen's Chosen buffs in a row. Won turn 4 that game against the fifth-ish boss.
---
Pfft, didn't even see it was 2015.
---
So it has to be Rexxar.
---
Mind actually making a point?
---
I've only been playing for a couple years so it's interesting to hear about things that happened before that, I've been liking these posts so far.
---
Yup, this is literally the only reason anyone would ever use a tracker. xD
---
This is beyond science. 
---
Agreed, Genn and Baku influence way too much of how the game is going to go before the game even really starts!
---
I believe in you
---
Hi mom? I'm not familiar with that drama. 
---
They definitely don’t make money off banning people’s accounts. If you explained to them the situation, in the same manor you did here then they probably thought the exact same thing. That someone boosted you, and they took into consideration your past log-in history / achievements and determined your story was BS.

Here I thought the hufer + dog drama was good. I had no idea

Fundamentally It's media/art being sterilized and watered down for the lowest common denominator.  The censorship of artwork is disgusting.

I can't find the new portrait, but they just threw a tank top on her underneath her armored corset or whatever it is so her cleavage isn't as pronounced.
---
a game mode like the old elo mode in urban rivals that lasted one week in which there had banned cards and people voted for the cards that should be banned the next week and the higher you went the better price you got 
---
The entire strategy for this game's development seems to be around new players. Existing players has always been an afterthought. A common trend with every public update since the beginning of Hearthstone has been "we can't do X because of new players". Eg. We can't do frequent balance changes because it's confusing to new players. We can't do more deck slots because of new players. We can't give you a more interesting/complex mechanic/interface because of new players. 
---
I think existing players are leaving the game simply because of this historical lack of focus on their wants. We can name interesting content ideas in this thread all we want but unless Blizzard changes their fundamental strategy, nobody is going to come back. 
---
(Also, coming back into this game after being competitive for multiple years and taking a year off is absolutely prohibitive. I'm not going to start from scratch after having experienced playing almost exclusively top tier decks for my entire Hearthstone career. A new game mode is not going to convince me to come back and spend more money/time. You should work on keeping what you have now.)

He picked the name long before Trump decided to run a racist campaign for president. The only place liberals would hate him for him is in the minds of strawmen constructed by shitty Trump-trolls. 
---
Be patient, it's just a small indie company, they'll get to it eventually
---
That means players would be less motivated to purchase cosmetic skins. Blizzard doesn't want this to happen.
---
This is nothing compared to the fact that the golden Air Totem just floats in nothing space and doesn't even touch the bottom of the card frame when it's on the board
---
Cool, a new Netflix documentary.
---
I used to be hardcore, but its fucking expensive. Give people better options to get cards. I rather play competetive CSGO. Where skill actually matters. 
---
Are you, by chance, trying to insinuate that my version wasn't flawless? &gt;:(
---
^srsly ^tho ^good ^job
---
There's another game that did that too, I don't think it's much of a big deal lol it's not like it affects gameplay it's just the characters appearance at the end of the day
---
Quality stuff right here
---
Epic gamer moment
---
Damn that's a killer hand
---
if you're kripp, about 5 years' worth?
---
It's about the change to Jaina's avatar.
---
The problem is both.
---
It happened to all players. No reason for Me/My/I. Everyone has to adjust. 
---
Well, first they're accused of not being communicative enough. And then when they're the bearer of bad news, everyone loses their mind.
---
I've done tournament modes before in another Blizzard games(notably, *Starcraft 2*'s tournament mode) and won a Diamond tournament...fine fine...I know I know it's nothing special, it's just Diamond League...but hey let me be proud of one thing in my gaming career.
---
But that tournament format, while interesting enough and intense enough for me, wasn't perfect either. But it was something. *Starcraft 2* enforced a hard cap on game length which was necessary yes, but I didn't like how the game decided who was the ultimate victor of the match when it's a stalemate situation(it simply added up all the "points" from resource gathering, damage etc etc and decided oh this guy did more, so he wins).
---
But it is a concern, if the matchups are a bunch of BO1's for example. Format is everything and a bad one could turn away more players than it attracts. Wait time between games is also another issue that Firebat talked about. He does not want to sit there and wait around.
---
For other tournament modes in other games that exist, you should look into Magic the Gathering: Arena's modes.
---
It’s because you’re being a cunt
---
Here's a hint, look at jaina, then look at this subreddit for the past week
---
So you want Rogue to lose one of their few combo enablers and early game removal just because it's one of their best cards?
---
They did it for the new tavern brawl event quests. The tech is finally here.
---
Less new cards, 3 expansions with over 100 cards each per year are too much for me, at some point I didn't ever bother to read them all and just googled a tier list and eventually quit at some point during Kobolds and Catacombs
---
It was standard. I used a combination of  the biggest fan buff neutral minion, Zola/spirit of the bat (had 3 bats out) then I had that echo legendary card that gives your minions echo/portal (minions cost 2 less). I had a pretty cool play where I got off maybe... 5 of those hand buff cards with echo in one play. 
---
Care to elaborate on what's bugged here?
---
You can play for free, but the fun is going to cost you. 
---
I was under the impression that female and woman we're synonyms, has something changed?
---
I had seen a video or I heard somewhere people talking about shrink ray being the new equality. I guess I should of considered that. 
---
That big deathrattle rogue...  Dane would be proud.  Shame you can't fit Sneed's in Standard.
---
Aggro Drood seeing some love in wild makes me happy, I love that deck to bits.  Drood in general got a lot of attention this week in wild.
---
Also, that Thicc Priest reached 22 legend with The Bancient One.
---
There's been a few disparate videos on Massan, some of which were voiced by Dog, and one even from Amaz.
---
There was a series of tournaments "The Pinnacle" which was hosted by Amaz. He mentioned much later, long after the tourney concluded, that there was some suspicious activity from Massan during the tourney(which didn't show up on the livecast, due to heavy editing).
---
Basically there were at least 6 different occasions where, at the start of the match, Massan would "disconnect". He claimed that it was a Blizzard issue and that if the tourney had a problem with it, then they need to contact tech support right away.
---
Not wanting to go through the whole pain of troubleshooting and especially with a tournament schedule on the line, Amaz would just "let it go" and Masaan, at the each of start of each match that didn't go south from connection issues, always had the perfect starting hand.
---
Massan would go on to win the tourney. There was also some controversy with Massan approaching Dog and trying to sell Dog some kind of entry ticket for $5k. Dog refused, stating he's already got an invite.
---
There another incident where Reckful of all people, engaged Massan on stream, and challenged him that his stream is full of viewbots. Massan became angry on stream, and most surprising of all, Reckful was taken aback and a little intimidated by Massan's rage.
---
I fully expect wild tournaments to ban parity decks, since Baku and Genn are fundamentally broken.
---
I swear it taken me a full year of playing warrior to realise Armoursmith is a girl.
---
Stop printing play one card, summon a full board
---
Haven't spent a cent on this game in a year or more. As you said, I realized that if I got the 3 shittiest legendaries I still couldn't play a MILDLY COMPETITIVE DECK after having SPENT $50, nearly the full cost of a regular game. So the $50 I spent got me literally nothing but a shitty, off-meta deck. 
---
I'm a native English speaker, so generally speaking, I use the correct form; however insisting it's "so dehumanizing" when it's more than likely a 2nd language or just a typo is where it comes across as overly sensitive.
---
Can someone give context?
---
As someone who’s had their account hacked and gear / gold stolen back when playing WoW. This was before Authenticators.
---
I can tell you that they take everything into account and all issues very seriously, I had to prove who I was in order for them to unlock my account. 
---
Best advice I can give is to try calling their support line , or keep putting in a ticket. Maybe have proof you didn’t share your account / pay for boosting 
---
ok up until this point i never realised thats a murloc and not a snake
---
been playing for about 4 years on-off
---
I thought the warrior was ok. Crowley, rush minions, linecracker. What do you think could improve it? 
---
More complex card design, unique and skill-rewarding keywords that aren't just rehashed versions of existing mechsnics, bo3 ladder, more game modes, new and interesting solo player content (read: not replays of dungeon run), ability to earn exclusive alternate heroes and old cardbacks and sortable deckslots.
---
Basically everything people have been asking for for years.
---
That was easily the lamest, most unconvincing moment that Reynad and Frodan put out. It was clearly a move to protect the TempoStorm brand.
---
Remember the accusers - key notable among them...was Chakki(who as we currently know, works for Blizzard)?
---
Even in the early days of magicamy, TeamLiquid had interviewed Tarei and voiced his skepticism *even then*, whether magicamy was real. Tarei's response was incredibly shifty...the body language, the vocal response...which drew a look of consternation from the interviewer.
---
If they're not going to change their price model at least give me the option to buy the cards I need with real cash.
---
1.6k dust to craft a legendary is ridiculous.
---
Paladin was ridiculous. And I saw very few people running it. 
---
New goals. All golden heroes, 12-0 arenas, multiple legend runs, it just becomes too repetitive 
---
One card I thought they would do last year was Bloodmage Thalnos.  That card used to see play in several different decks.  It was never broken or OP, it just saw a lot of play.  The card hasn't seen much play lately, partly due to the fact that Keleseth is in the game and has been really prominent over the last year.  
---
Because the card hasn't been seen a ton, I'm kind of thinking that they might not HoF Thalnos, but I think it will go back to seeing more play once Keleseth rotates out in a month or two. 
---
People are wanting the mode so they can ban cards and classes as they see fit.
---
It won't create a new meta but instead create new strategies.
---
Before I saw this, I ended up adding a second Healing Rain, Far Sight (for card draw), Tidal Surge (healing/ board control), and The Runespear (for shiggles). I was also debating Rain of Toads for more board control and Beakered Lighting as a cheap board clear (and can be used to draw combo pieces). I'm really trying to avoid crafting cards that are gonna rotate in a couple months, so I doubt I'll add a second Volcano. 
---
Because it's not really under the radar. People have been speculating auctioneer would rotate ever since the hall of fame was introduced
---
MasterMoist#11385 NA Quest Trade
---
And then Warrior played Brawl
---
I'm probably just still angry about the chickens.
---
Because you think that by using "female" instead of "woman" that it's pejorative or how the terms male/female are used in the animal kingdom type of context?
---
I didn't find it offensive. But that might be because I'm seeing in a purely science textbook sort of way.
---
Thanks for the list, bummer there's no standard shaman, but always enjoy looking at the top decks in your report
---
That's the question of the year. No one can give a concise explanation without contradicting someone else's idea of what a tournament mode should be.
---
I see, no need to be aggressive about it😂
---
Man Ive been all around cuba. They are definetly not better off. Not even the poor. All shops are literally empty. Wifi is only in public places like one place a town and u have to pay hourly. Honestly its a beautifull country turned into a shithole.
---
despite the downvotes I thought the picture in your post was pretty funny OP. I don’t really know the answer to your question though
---
Neamek#2396 EU, 80g Trade, ill show, you go first
---
Ok and? He still chose the name after the Apprenticr. You’re making shit up about him being named after the card term.
---
As with any large company, expect their prices to come down/offerings get better once they start seeing a dip in revenues from Hearthstone. Until then, their not likely to change anything. Same reason Nintendo isn't coming out with a new version of the switch yet. Saving that for when sales for the switch begin to stagnate.
---
I feel like some classes get fucked too early, and what I mean by that is this.
---
Some classes get a lot of early game cards? And by like turn 3 they have 3 minions on the board while you place down your first one.
---
It's like, just quit and join another game.
---
Massan/Pwnyhoof viewbotting is up there for me, but let's not forget the time Hosty was stream cheating for that one tournament and got caught because of a mirror reflecting the cheating monitor.
---
Trump vs Disguisedtoast (or was it kripp vs disguisedtoast?) a couple of months ago. Still not that big and iirc they solved it in a mature way so yeah nah
---
&gt; as it can calculate hundreds/thousands of calculations at once if trained enough. 
---
I'd like to see the study on that.
---
Also, a computer can do millions of calculations at once, so...
---
You can't just believe something because it barely matters. People could just go around accusing them of stupid stuff, like /u/LetsHaveTon2 enjoys sniffing feet. 
---
True, but a lot of people like to play off meta decks too. Additionally in best of X you have to play other decks. That makes it so you won’t run into the same thing every game. It makes you have to be good with more than one deck to do well.
---
Blizz better not touch my totem!
---
Yep, you can lose games from full health in a single turn because "Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive”
---
Hahahaha shaman None found
---
How is there not a bot for this? 
---
I would like to see "Ban 1 hero" option in play mode before tournament mode.
---
Back in the day, HS drama was something greater. MagicAmy was proper HS drama. Scamaz was HS drama. Reynad calling out ViciousSyndicate for being a "worse" meta report than the MagicAmy report based on no factual evidence whatsoever was... well, that was just Reynad being Reynad, but still more entertaining than anything going on in the Hearthstone community today.
---
/r/competitivehs is slowly becoming a desert with a few good posts a month, and /r/hearthstone has become a poor parody of /r/hearthstonecirclejerk – one or two years ago, /r/hearthstone was at least ahead in the circlejerk meta but this time is now long gone.
---
TL;DR: ded gaem
---
I don't think I could see them selling them individually, but I could see them selling them as the "Troll Champions" bundle or something like that. Same with the Witchwood characters. Considering that individual heroes are pretty expensive, I bet that it would be fairly cost prohibitive though.
---
I suspect one reason that they don't do this is because as with Mecha-Jaraxxus, they can use hero portraits as exclusives in the pricier pre-orders. Maybe if they find something else to make pre-orders more appealing, then they won't mind saturating the store with more characters for sale?

So by your logic why can't I buy more deck slots yet?
---
Ugh. You're spot on there. I have been completely sucked into it. What's worse is I know I've got an addiction, but I still get sucked in every time.
---
Time for Grabulfund's Odd "Black Beans" Shaman with the spell damage package.
---
If only you were as bright as you are angry :(
---
idk what your problem is. if you send $50 an expansion, by disenchanting the right cards, not playing wild (honestly, stuff wild but &lt;3 dane), and playing 4 of 9 classes instead of all of them, i get every card i want for standard. i've never had a problem with their pack purchasing to dust ratio, nor their reward system. hell, i haven't been buying anything but ultra value bundles for the last 2 years and by completing dailies i have more than enough.
---
so long as you're capable of making decisions as to disenchanting what you don't like, and playing what you do like, you'll see you have plenty enough to experiment and have fun outside of exactly 30 cards for some stupid meta deck.
---
50 dollars should absolutely not give you access to all 9 classes at full power. honestly i think the game's economy is exceptionally well thought out and fair. i've never been partial to these types of posts. 
---
f2p if done right should at least gain access to all the important/relevant cards of 1 full class, though i can't confirm this. people need to stop pretending they're kripp, noodle or kibler. these people spend thousands.
---
&gt; My main concern is that these cards do not support fun gameplay they focus more on building decks that are fairly straight forward (which can be good) but also result in very repetitive gameplay and do not make each game feel like a new and exciting experience
---
Because non genn/baku decks are different...
---
Cause he fights for his friends?
---
Inappropriate, kids can see this.
---
2/20 is a third
---
Actually, I have a hearthstone addiction. I have to work really hard to keep a lid on it, and quite often I fail and end up spending way more than I can afford. More cards never sates the desire for more cards. 
---
How am I white knighting? I'm just not seeing any real proof about MagicAmy not being realy. There might be, but it's not here.
---
I used to hate Big Priest, but now I love playing versus it. What's your class and are you playing Wild?
---
Why don't you actually try playing combo against aggro or even Midrange?
---
Even then, other card games can be just as bad. MTG has two card infinite combos, sometimes even in Standard, the card Armageddon Knight was capable of starting thirty plus step play sequences in Yugioh, and as far as I am aware (I could be wrong), EX Pokemon haven't been doing the best things for the Pokemon TCG since their inception.
