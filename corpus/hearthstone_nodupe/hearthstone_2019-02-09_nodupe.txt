I just assumed it was Hunter’s passive ability to draw exactly what you needed, and that’s why they always played Deathstalker Rexxar or greater spell stone on curve
---
---
---
Well, I'm not trolling and I have finished top 500 legend 5 times, so maybe you're just bad.
---
But we're talking about a situation where they got mojo'd LOL. Can't do all those things. And LOL if they put it back in before they finish drawing their deck then they can't use holy wrath (unless they wanna hit you in the face for 2 damage)  LEARN THE GAME BRUH
---
&gt; got every card back since closed beta
---

---
No you don't. Dalaran flame, power core, golden celebration. You don't have any of those.
---
Your collection is incomplete and you will never be able to have them all.

---
What is SAD?
---
nice
---
At least Druid is still good at drawing cards and gaining a fuckton of armor. So now their main win condition is to stall the game out, draw their entire deck in one turn and win with some degenerate combo.
---
The class designed around cheating out big minions doesn’t give a shit about minions anymore. LOL
---
&gt;Something is super fucked here.
---
like you believing a random redditor over a Blizzard employer?

---
-coine

---
Puhleeze. Just go tall. Put on pressure without going all in.
---
&gt; If there is one class that can thrive in a meta without powerful cards it is Warlock because of Lifetap.
---
You havent been around during Un'goro have you?  
---
  
---
Ungoro warlock was so bad not even zoo was seen anywhere.
---
A burst finish, sounds a lot like a combo deck when you say it like that. A 4 attack minion, that's like saying "my 4/4 Arcane tyrant is my win condition." You can say it, but just don't expect anyone to take you seriously. 
---
Not like this sub wasnt crying constantly to give rogue healing and hunter draw lol
---
LOL what control priest is extremely favored against both of those. LMAO what those are matchups that I am excited to see. Where did you get those whackass stats just look at it yourself NOOB
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-120/
---
I mean, you can even "think" a little and understand why control priest is favored.
---
&gt;  with a real lack of weaknesses
---
They are weak to multiple large creatures.
---
If Defile was the best designed card, it would not have been necessary to nerf a preexisting, archetype-defining card to make room for it. It is not good design to create a square peg when you need it to fit in a round hole.
---
My Jaina displate is still in the box. It was delivered three weeks ago but I never got around to opening it. 
---
That’s just semantics. I was here for my cardbacks. 
---
I always agreed with Kripp that it should be nerfed to a 2/6

Sad but true......
---
A 4 attack minion with 9 health is a legitimate threat LOL. Maybe you've never felt the twilight drake beatdown, but that shit legit bruh.
---
Soooo if you cant have a burst finish, I guess the only way control decks can win is fatigue? Sounds like a pretty narrow description to me LOL
---
Sometimes is a far fetch, I think you mean all the time. Without the burst damage, "control" priest has no way to win most if not all matchups. That's not really what a control deck is, actually it's more of what a combo deck is. 
---
The kobold librarian seems like it would only be done by a bad player which could explain WR (trading the 2/1 seems like it would almost always be better) and the doomsayer is just "?"
---
If you look closely, the mana crystal from the coin disappears before the card enters play. So it works fine, it just gives the illusion that it should work
---
Well, adding things to the board while removing their things is what I always called tempo. backstab si7 on turn 3 can remove a lot from the board while adding a 3/3. Dagger on 2 is preserving tempo for later turns. I agree, though, that it's not exactly a full tempo deck.

Awesome, glad to hear that!

Wow thanks for saying so! Glad it's working

ah, snowball cards. cards that really drive home the concept that if you don't have the mcguffin answer, you lose. so instead of addressing snowball cards like fledgling, thug, fungal, tarim, ~~mana wyrm~~ , tidecaller, any murloc card ever, bla bla bla, they created giant legendaries that solve every problem in one neat bundle.. if you draw it. /slowclap
---
9 out of 10 decks is playing watch me draw my whole deck with 0 interaction. Don't bother building a board because anything is easily answered regardless of tempo. Very very boring meta. Can't wait for rotation

I got some karma, so I'd say me.

How do you have time to play 30-40 matches per day?

To be fair, there are just too many mage secrets that counter that play... user error
---
You are so fucking stupid you can't even read your own fucking links.
---
Find the column with Control Priest.  Move your fat stub of a finger to the right.  See the red square under Exodia Paladin?  That's an OTK deck.  Red means unfavorable winrate you dumbshit.  Move over more, see the red square under Holy Wrath Paladin?  Also unfavorable.
---
Here's TempoStorm in a nice, easier-for-an-idiot graph:
---
https://i.imgur.com/ev7nMsN.png

So you pretend to play a deck you clearly know nothing about because you think all the cool kids play Combo Priest, you lie about your winrate, then you get caught in a lie, and you follow up with a link that proves you are a liar.
---
And top to it all off, your pathetic 10yo ass goes back to throw a temper tantrum on every other unrelated post I've made in this thread.
---
Congratulations, you've proven you aren't worth the oxygen you waste.
---
Noice
---
This is a turn 1 tracking, so I think the pick is always Rexxar. But in other situations or game states the other two could certainly be correct as you suggest.
---
In addition to that, you can build a t1 deck right now for the cost of 1 legendary, 2 epics and the rest are rares. Hunters pretty good, which means being competitive (at least on ladder) is absurdly cheap right now. 
---
Reading this article just realized armorsmith is still in the game, I thought it rotated or something. Went from pretty common to nonexistent
---
You mean just slam Benedictus, play their answers and just let them burn in fatigue while you have 17 cards left in your deck?
---
Ironic
---
&gt; Considering how I used to love HOTS until the ranked scene quickly scattered after support for it was cut
---
i don't follow hots at all, is there no support for the competitive scene whatsoever?
---
Yes
---
There's people who miss Affinity in Magic, so I'm not surprised.
---
So excited I wrote epic :/ oh well
---
Thank you for the kind words! :)
---
They need to keep giving out more stuff to offset the increased price of it and the declining demand.
---
Fun detected, they'll nerf future posters from now on. 
---
Lmao indeed it is. I appreciate your humor!
---
Ugh, screw Activition raw.
---
Judging by what aggro players are saying here, they really don't like the last of those 3 relationships.
---
playing tempo rogue right now and have crushed a few cloning priests. 
---
Windfury Harpy.
---
Take screenshots before shes nerfed.
---
Hearthstone is declining, just like Overwatch.
---
Blizzard hasn't come out with any new IPs in years. Overwatch was the last one. Before that....uh, nothing really?
---
me too, its pretty much why i love wild. I love playing slow reno decks. 
---
This idea that control decks should lack proactive win conditions is one of the most baffling things I've seen from the Hearthstone fandom.   
---
Maps are small and there aren't many of them. So far, Overwatch has gotten 2-3 heroes a year and maybe 1-2 maps a year.
---
That shouldn't take anywhere near as large a team as a game like WoW or Destiny.
---
The title seems as if it may imply you were no longer excited after you opened them?
---
Double meme legendaries is where it's at. 
---
i think its because it takes skill and practice to pull off, it feels satisfactory to be killed by one because the feeling is somewhat "fair and square" that you lost to someone who took time to learn the combo, rather someone who plays 10 shudderwocks within a time limit and kills you instantly...
---
can you please put a NSFW tag on this my 5 year old son views this subreddit 
---
Except getting a quest for 2/3 of classes instantly makes me reroll it... not an incentive to play that class, I'd rather just keep rerolling them
---
This is lmao how? Like what's the humor aspect?
---
I've seen some bad jokes, but this takes the cake
---
Computer, describe Standard in one sentence.
---
Titan project is overwatch bankrupted blizzard and they had to sign with actvision gg
---
That's still an encouragement, though it seems to have little effect on you
---
Heck naw
---
How did you get this so quick guys
---
Like wow this is from a while ago
---
Humour is subjective 
---
It's funny cuz this is the state of the game. So many OTK decks
---
3 heroes a year consistently.
---
The maps probably take a fair bit in terms of art and lighting as each map is its own thing, they don't have a palette for them for... whatever reason.  
---
One turn kill.
---
That proves nothing. If it's bugged in one way why couldn't it also be bugged in another way?
---
Hi there, taking your time to reply and any feedback is already very welcome.  
---
To address a few of your concerns:
---
* Biology Project can certainly be held onto when necessary against decks that specifically run Mojomaster Zihi and I will consider adding a small paragraph into the guide to shed light into it.
---
* Floop is the best counter to Geist available. While it may not be ideal in all situations, it is the best option available. The use of Geist fluctuates in and out of the meta over the time and for this reason it is included as an optional card swap and not part of the main deck for those who find themselves wanting to tech against it.
---
* At what point would 2 Polymorphs and a Geist stop you from using Floop - it seems like you have identified the perfect scenario for such a tech to contradict your own point.
---
* Guides are in place for people who want to play a certain deck, and therefore how to play it in all situations so having it say "Don't play the deck" is quite ridiculous.  
---

We're assuming there's no bug and trying to figure out if it's possible normally. If we're assuming it's a bug literally anything can be possible. 
---
Yes i agree with you but i think it is wrong to give anyone top much shit for their bad english as most don’t have english as their native language and sometimes need to learn and additional language in school
---
Thank you!
---
If you look at the screenshot, that's not the case, as volcanic potion was generated to the hand by an autocast burgle. This circumstance involves cast actors taking the spell buff as if it were the next spell cast by the player.
---
Yeah GvG actually a golden age of HS where every card matters, every drop of value matters. Now who give a shiit when you got type of cards like Ultimate Infestation or DK Rexxar in your hand
---
I think, you are wrong, people who fear losing a job will work harder, though not better or creatively. 
---
Also, &gt;will end up with a kingdom of thrash 
---
They already did. Mobile Diablo was a spit in the face 
---
Not your deal. It's everyone's own choice how to spend their time

What game you play. thats Control Mage style now

Stop arguing with *this game is dead* plebs.They just spend their time playing their so called *popular* games to be part of the norm and shame people for playing other games.He is not worth your time, he is just here to please his pity ego.

but i love my cube

(Bonus points for going back on the whole “you wouldn’t have been defending it a year ago” bit though.)
---
Good question. Upvoted. Does anyone know?
---
Yep, def should of done it yesterday when I did not need to re roll yesterday.
---
Morrigan have an animation. It is meat wagon.
---
It had a good couple years, but the game was not well managed; particularly the new characters. 
---
People also grew bored with it as the game became solved. Was super fun at the start. 
---
Blizzard Activision will never see a dime from me ever again. Bought Overwatch on release, had a blast and then it all went downhill from there.
---
Autocad

I mean, if a company stops growing, that essentially means it's going to be on a downward trend, no?

To post this???? Maybe?? 😂😂

it would also make for a nice copypasta outside of this sub.  
---
p.ex. as a reply to inclusive or 
---
Oh you poor baby! Do you pick broken, broken, or broken? You can only have ONE!?! Oh the tragedy!
---
many but not all. there are still companies that aren't taking the Blizzard and Bethesada route and becoming unfavorable to their consumers
---
So new direction for blizzard? Fire all your devs and keep a skeleton crew for the mobile games because it's more profitable 
---
Wanted to upvote but its at 69...
---
I feel like the guy who named himself goebbels is not being entirely honest here... how would you even know that lol, ive added a few ropers and let me tell you those were not some rich or enlightening conversations
---
The people who would censor card art for ideological reasons will remain.
---
In my experience Odd warriors rope the most. Aggro players don't want to waste time. 
---
Cloning gallery is very strong and the deck is one of the only valuable deck with wich I have fun at the moment. I usually lose a lot of games with Tess-pionage and it limits the fun I can have with it. 
---
Oh yeah, I know. all encompassing statements don't work here because there most likely is a company that isn't like that
---
People wonder how CCGs like Eternal can sustain themselves with barely 1k concurrent players. HS has to have a mindboggling profit margin...
---
How is that cold? That's just common sense...
---
It won't be going F2P, it only just received a permanent price drop.
---
Im sorry to be the one to tell you this and ruin your world view but there are other countries outside the US who are also capitalist, including Canada.
---
Ha, turn 5? I raise you STB + Patches + that mosquito hook thing + Dread Corsair + Southsea Captain. Turn 5 is late game.
---
That really is no excuse. That is just an indictment of those many other large corporations.
---
If they are expecting slower growth and lean times than they shouldn't be spending so extravagantly on the top of the company. They are following one set of beliefs for the executives, that they will grow and can afford massive salaries, and another for the rest of the employees, that lean times are coming.
---
TILTED!
---
Completing my turn and letting it rope means I avoid the situation where the other player has their turn all set-up and I hear the YOUR TURN sound from the other room when I'm mid-pee.
---
Nice
---
Most likely 8
---
I see, thanks!
---
So we don't have to complete them before the event ends. 
---
Isn’t it:
---
Control&gt;Aggro
---
Aggro&gt;Midrange
---
Midrange&gt;Control
---
With current examples:
---
Control Warlock&gt;Odd Pally
---
Odd Pally&gt;Midrange Hunter
---
Midrange Hunter&gt;Control Warlock
---
It's because the wording should have been "Put a secret from your deck into the battlefield". But this sounds so lame that they decided to go with a shorter, easier to understand version.
---
Magic the Gathering has had remarkable staying power. It has been going strong for 26 years, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon.
---
I would argue that their reasonable growth projections, meaning that they have never been to overly ambitious, is what has kept them around.
---
Yeah this shit happens in canada too bud... 
---
oh yeah, I know its no excuse. But if OP is boycotting from a game company due to layoffs/execs being paid a lot of money, then that would suggest that boycotting from many of the large corps may be warranted
---
No, MTG has been going strong since 1993, and there isn't much of a reason to believe that game will die any time soon.
---
ahh I see, yeah, true, yeah revenue is important as well.
---
This should just be illegal imo. It sounds like fucking stealing but then 'official'.
---
I completely agree. We've now officially seen blizzard's soul leave its body. There's a growing disconnect between the love for gaming, engaging entertainment, world building, and the individuals in control of its creation. 
---
I want to offer an extremely limited defense of Activision's motivation. The cost model for modern games is flawed and has been for about ten years. We as consumers still hold the expectation that we'll pay for a game up front, once, and continue playing it for years. 
---
In the early days this 'one time cost' standard for home gaming was a sort of marketing posture companies took. In order to offset the burden the consumer faced in purchasing a console, which at the time was both new and super expensive, as well as to set them apart from arcade gaming where you'd pay per play. I think that this standard has aged to the degree that it's hurting the industry and our experience of it. If Activision were still collecting a consistent income from overwatch we might not have seen this layoff. But players outrage is evoked every time a company tries to implement an income stream beyond basic charge for the game. 
---
Hearthstone as an example we all sort of half heartedly admit that paying for packs is the standard for a card game, but also internally rage when we realize we've spent 500$ on packs in the past 3 years. HoTS is outright free to play until you decide to buy a character or mount. Wow is a monthly cost and tbh everybody seems pretty ok with that, but complains about the pace of content release.
---
So it seems to me Activision is, if we're being honest, in a hard position. They do need to make money to function, and it's not very compassionate of me to shit on them for making the (absolutely wrong and terrible) hard decision.
---
I think we need to see developers shift to subscription models across the entire industry. In the case of blizzard I think it would have been amazing to see them implement a monthly charge model where you immediately get access to all their games. Then the user can additionally choose how much of their subscription goes to what specific game. If you love wow only, put all 15$ per month on wow. If you want to see new overwatch characters you put some of your subscription into them. 
---
This alleviates the inconsistency of Activision's income, removes the risk of pay 2 win, and empowers the user to decide what they want their money to actually do. I'm probably ignoring huge gaps in how this would go wrong, but if I were in charge I would have tried it just to see before killing blizzard with the sacrificial knife.
---
I was expecting this reply. Ok, so there's a 1 in thousands chance that you're wrong and Hearthstone becomes one of the extremely small number of games that lasts for generations of players. Still, not much of a prediction.
---
MtG is a pretty massive exception to the general rule of how long games stick around for.
---
All I want to know is, is Chakki’s job safe? 
---
&gt;If this is a desktop only game there is a good chance it doesn't even still exist today.
---
 I can live with that trade. HS had two good years. 
---
Aww, gets caught resulting into a completely irrelevant argumentation error, doesn't make up any other comeback than this. Pathetic.
---
It's factual, sorry.
---
Hi T&amp;E :)
---
I would wonder what you're confused about on a slightly more specific level; hearthstone is hearthstone all the same.. few new terms;
---
Rush: like charge, but only for minions. Can attack normally next turn
---
Overkill: effect happens if the attackers damage is +1 or more over the target's health
---
Lifesteal: return the damage you do with that character/weapon as health
---
Echo: When you play a card, you may continue playing copies of this card until you run out of mana or choose to play something else.
---
Otherwise the terms are the same by and large. Let me know if you are confused on anything else specific.
---
All rank ranges differ a bit in which decks are played, could be more counters to tier 1 decks (hunters ain't tier 1 anymore) in the rank 5-1 range
---
It's given. All you had to respond with was an ad hominem argumentation error. You don't get to decide that an argument isn't an argument.
---
Learn the basics of argumentation and try to improve on your kindergarten level antics, as it stands they're pathetic.
---
We're seeing some unforseen moral issues surrounding Facebook. Data is currently a hot button and it's difficult to say how that will burden Facebook in the future. Whether through people leaving, lawsuits, or governmental intervention. At the time of their ipo people were speculating wildly, and in my opinion the company hasn't really delivered anything. They seem to make their money peddling user data near exclusively.
---
Of course that's just my loosely informed opinion, so maybe I could do with an education on the subject.
---
The rumble solo adventure, in solo adventure.
---
I've had an opponent try to bluff me by holding his last card with a reticle over my hero until time. So I waited til rope to win. We were both at 2 hp
---
Even if having plateaued was the end of the world, cutting off the wings of the plane to save on fuel can only have 1 out come. Crashing hard.
---
Imagine thinking everything is sarcastic because it doesn't align with your point of view
---
Good reason to stop preordering packs. The game has been going nowhere but in circles. Should gave stop when Brode left. I mean he left for a good reason probably.
---
&gt;Big Priest
---
&gt;F2P
---
&gt;No wild decks
---
Damn you got me.
---
It’s unfortunate, Hearthstone is dieing, I cant speak for other blizzard games as I have no interest whatsoever in overwatch or anything else.
---
They’ve let hearthstone go from a GREAT game to a boring, mediocre game because the design team has failed, the balance team has failed to make timely adjustments... I hate to be he doomsayer but HS needs drastic changes if it’s going to survive, otherwise I give the game another year or 2 max and it’s dead relatively speaking.
---
Classic needs to rotate out. So many cards butchered because Blizzard lacks common sense.
---
Respectable, but this question is more for people that dedicate what is supposed to be a 10-15 minute game of hearthstone into 30+ mins
---
Kay. Ever played against a FrostLinch Jaina late game? Such fun..
---
Do you have user numbers to support that or are you just another salty Sally? 
---
Under Brode’s watch the game starting to decline, I think people give brode too much credit because he’s a fun guy, with a funny laugh. 
---
If we’re honest though, he failed at making the game great, he oversaw as the game got worse and worse and worse.. I loved HS, now I play if I’m really bored that’s about it.
---
They sat on their laurels too long, milking WoW for over 10 years, releasing terrible expansions for HS and losing their top streamers left and right, losing the OW playerbase and streamers to frustration, no new IPs since OW and no new Warcraft or Starcraft games in ages, Diablo Immortal on mobile, no wonder they're floundering. They've lost what confidence people had in the brand, Blizzard used to be a name that garnered respect and confidence, not anymore.
---
Honestly, I kinda agree as long as the aggro isn’t unstoppable like the pirate warrior fiasco. 
---
I love the feeling of being in control. I hate the feeling of  the opponent drawing until victory.
---
I would say I also hate when one card totally changes the entire dynamic of the deck like Rexxar.  It was a mistake that they added new beasts to that hero. It was an undercosted Death Knight because it was weak, but as the expansions came it got stronger while still costing the same. One card allowing an aggressive mid range deck compete with fully crafted control decks is absurd.
---
Christ I've never seen this meme in emoji format before
---
Unaffected account gets deleted.

I love this nuanced discussion. Hopefully somebody who actually works for the company is thinking along the same lines because it's painful from the outside looking in.
---
An otk combo deck world make all his stall tactics bad for him. 
---
We all know Odd Warriors are just watching video on youtube instead of paying attention to their opponent's turn.
---
Interesting, will look into this. Thanks man
---
I do it because 1) I have a 100% success ratio getting them to stop roping, and 2) my time is precious, and I’m not gonna waste it just so I can pat myself on the back for taking the high road. Always choose the passive approach and the world will walk all over you. To each his/her own!
---
Are you defending the use of meta decks in CASUAL mode?
---
Best way i have found to beating elemental mage is playing a slow control deck. Once they run out of cards in their deck, it is very hard for them to win. Once they are in fatigue, they might have a few elementals on board but if you kill them quickly, they run out of steam quickly. Kill their minions quickly, and you won't have any problems. Also, don't play too many low health minions since frost lich jaina's hero power is extremely good. 
---
I sometimes let them off if it's a turn 1 rope, but if they rope turn 2 again then I rope them till the game finishes. Usually they stop pretty soon but too late dick head I am incredibly petty we riding this rope to the station
---
That's literally Jaina in the picture, how she's always been.         
---
IF you're that strict then how about we put some clothes on to Malf and Garrosh too? I find it unfair.
---
It's because I'm playing some fatigue or OTK deck.
---
If you're playing a deck that actually plays the game fair and square and I roped you then I'm sorry, it was probably a misunderstanding.
---
Haha I rerolled 80g quests to get 100g mannnn
---
Hunter just feels insane to me. Even after the nerfs, I see them all over the place and there's no telling what they're running because you can kind of just throw together Hunter packages + Rexxar and have a tier 1 competitive deck. 
---
Secret package + Hyena/Lynx beast package- tier 1
---
Secret Package + Spells only package- tier 1
---
Secret package + Kathreena package- tier 1
---
Deathrattle package + Kathreena package-tier 1
---
Hell I'm pretty sure I've seen a course Hyena/Lynx beasts package + Kathreena package
---
And I'm sure I'm missing some. They're all strong, but they also all do well because of Rexxar. 
---
I'm kind of looking at cheap Wild decks right now because Standard feels so meh for me with this super strong Hunter class running around. It's better after the nerfs but they didn't hit the right cards imo other than Spellstone. 
---
It's especially fun against the Res Priest that try to  draw cards before they know your archetype!
---
@@
---
Implying a good aggro player isnt thinking a few turns ahead
---
I rope quite often regardless of archetype that I’m playing, and its never a conscious decision. I try to consider every option available, every line, and then evaluate those lines to find the best play. I’m also thinking about what my opponent will do the next turn based on the line I choose, and if I’m able to, a second turn ahead. 
---
There’s nothing wrong with using the amount of time you are allowed to use.
---
The impact the flametongue nerf had on Even Shaman is evidence the nerf was justified.

Spellhunter or secrethunter is not a good deck anymore. Spellstone nerf hit that deck pretty hard. Think about it that deck has nothing to do on 5 anymore and on 6 you have both spell stone and To m side. Anyway try midrange variant, you should have all the cards for it. That deck will get you to 5.

I was originally doing it without Valeera the Hallows but I finally had enough to craft her. So it's easier now then before 
---
Yeah he just uses spells to cut my minnions down to 1 health and pings them to death to get a 3/6 lifeteal. Even plays 1 health minnions of his own to ping them into 3/6.
---
It's a kind of mental warfare. In Overwatch I make a note of who on the enemy team is most vocal about 'bullshit kills' etc, then I make a point of teabagging them every single time they die, and I do it for twice as long if they were already low health and I killed them with the tiniest bit of chip damage. They will generally either go full tilt mode trying to focus me with counters and disregarding any team play, constantly inting into my team just to focus me, or they'll just leave the game.
---
Some might call it toxic but I don't ever speak to them, just teabag. Psyching out your opponents seems fair game to me.
---
With four cards in hand?
---
I think this is a great point - they have a fully digital game that they refuse to balance more than a few times a year.  Of course it's going to feel stale when literally nothing changes for months at a time.  If they made balance changes (nerfs _and_ buffs) every month the ladder might actually feel interesting.
---
Sort by ciontroversal to have real answers and not some bittersweet "multitasking". 1 guy at arena roped me hard for 20 turns, I asked why, he said "to get win for free". Another time someone added me, trashtalk me hard and said something like "you were too slow your first turn so I wanted to teach you" (I went for tea to the kitchen after mulligun, but didn;t even roped him).
---
So the real answer - some people are shit. Or tilted. Or tilted shit. Don't mind them and move on.
---
Yes, Blizzard partnered with Finatics so they had to sell all the existing stuff in the store.
---
Can we talk about the 4th Mass Hyteria though? Does anyone expect that?
---
"I\`m sure they\`ll bounce back with announcing yet another overwatch character being gay."
---
I'll post later today. Around 90 games played with 61% WR. 
---
Hearthstone’s getting a yugioh style series too?
---
Now you can run Hunters mark with Keleseth
---
Also works well with overload giant
---
Honestly it's not enough. Shamans are still too strong in this meta.
---
Nerf hex to 5 mana.
---
Man, they probably think they're like geniuses whenever they something like that.
---
A cut above the mindless meta sheep.
---
I wonder will Big Paladin with Prismatic Lens ever become popular
---
The problem with analyzing flametongue totem like this is that the only deck that was doing well and using FTT can literally no longer use the card.
---
It's much easier to evaluate equality and the hunter cards because the deck list doesn't change.
---
It's somewhat easier to evaluate cold blood bc decent decks besides odd rogue still used it.
---
The only semi-refined deck that used FTT besides Even Shaman is aggro Shaman, and it wasnt doing well to begin with
---
Yeah that’s what I meant. I’ve also thrown in arcanes.
---
Draw 1 mana antoidas 
---
They don't need to deliver anything except ads to you while people look at memes on fbook, pictures of their friends on instagram, or whatever chat theyre having on whatsapp. That's their business model, and it is successful.

Not sure what I'm looking at here, is he even?
---
Death rattle typo
---
What a low tier argument. Guess my mom is right: whiners are weiners.
---
I'm glad people are starting to realise that Blizzard have been actively trying to cuck the classic set since they introduced the HoF, and are now starting to complain.
---
There are a dozen different busted decks that run in wild, only a portion of which ever get nerfed. Murdering a minor offender seems pretty over the top imo.
---
Not defending or anything, but how can we say it's a failure if it's not even out yet?
---
Now w8 for new expansion.
---
They're different in that in one game you don't build log cabins.
---
Look at the actions bar
---
Can you even read? There's a huge change in numbers. I also prefer when needs don't completely gut an archetype or a class, but just tone down the power level.
---
At least every second game I play is Hunter. Sometimes I get lucky and get 2 games without seeing a Hunter. It's so fucking bland. 
---
I faced one. What's the win con? Hakkar, Liam, go infinite? I got Journey from Un'Goro from Elise, so I got rid of my bloods, and then I just outvalued him until I conceded out of pity.
---
I still sometimes instinctively hit sorry when this happens... Most people don't react well
---
6 mana 12/12 divided over 4 minions. It's still stupid good.
---
Basically the entire “good old days” of America post-WWII.
---
The door is always open to return either way.  In fact you could argue you are more likely to return when you are boycotting because you are more likely to back down over a point of principle than play something you just don't enjoy.  Much like someone on a diet is more likely to start eating chocolate again than someone who just doesn't like the taste of chocolate.
---
Well the weapon rotates out in April, so there's that.
---
You're right about Genn/baku but flametongue definitely deserved a nerf, it's been in every aggro and most of midrange shaman deck since beta. At least Blizz are following the FW policy
---
Usually just distracted. 
---
I'll rope aggro decks because I hate them so much and know they are just trying to go for quick easy wins. I don't know about "win" or "easy" but I can certainly take "quick" away from them.
---
Pants on the knees
---
Took me a couple of days, because I didn't play at all for a couple of days before release. Second casual game I queue into, it's a Priest with the Hakkar cardback. So I'm guessing it's been spread far and wide by now.
---
And Quest mages trying to play sorcerers!
---
I'm also interested on that list,facing a lot of priests on wild.
---
and?
---
Nah, it’s more that Blizzard has been responding to the community complaints every step of the way, but it just generates new complaints because we don’t think of the ramifications of these changes we ask for.
---
I saw Thijs was playing this recently, maybe him?
---
Isn't it the other way around? Since it's made your favorite cardback automatically after you get it, wouldn't that mean it is a deliberate effort to SPREAD it? Sorry, but I got confused by this.
---
&gt; That card has always been some ridiculously broken bullshit that somehow dodges criticism. 
---
It's beyond broken in terms of power-level. It's an auto-include in every single Paladin deck (Save for Odd Paladin) and will continue to be until banning in competitive HS is introduced. People like to complain about UI or Defile, but those cards belong to certain archetypes - Tarim just goes into any archetype. If it were part of the Classic set, Reddit would've lost it's collective mind.
---
I’m just high bro, sometimes I just can’t decide what the play should be!
---
I’d say the same tools are being used as before, you just get one more turn to draw them. 
---
No. They are wrong for thinking that the developers are doing anything meaningful. I still play and enjoy HS to this day. Doesnt mean they aren't fucking up a lot of aspects of it. 
---
Neither of those changes would've made it odd so nah.
---
Some dude got high legend with it recently and it became really popular.
---
Sounds about right. It seemed like Thijs or Savjz nonsense. God I hope this doesn't keep up 
---
blizzard putting an end to equality
---
That was the term i was looking for! Changed it.
---
It's possible that he has friends and they don't know what hearthstone is.
---
Even “OP” cards like ziliax and Lich King weren’t on the same level as flametongue. In wild (higher power level) ziliax is a questionable renolock include and LK only sees play in big priest and the occasional even shaman (despite being a sub-par include in that list). Comparatively, flametongue has seen play in every non-maly/shudder shaman deck since ever. The fact that they see lots of play in standard is totally fine, that’s the whole point of standard. 
---
Control paladin is fine. Sure, it can’t highroll a board wipe on turn 4 anymore, it’ll have to wait for t5 shrink ray, but it will be fine and is probably still viable right now (wild).
---
If it was Odd Paladin it might be a viable play if you don't have a 1-drop.
---
But he's not
---
If that's why they nerfed it they should have waited for the release
---
&gt;I'm kind of looking at cheap Wild decks right now 
---
You just barely missed the boat on even Shaman. 
---
It's been one of the top decks in Wild since Genn was released and only plays 1 legendary (Genn) and 2 epics (Sea Giant). Can also run Lich King, but not core. 
---
May have to wait a while and see if it survives the Flametounge totem nerf. The totem synergy was really helpful for 0-mana 5/5 and the Totem-carver 4-mana 7/7 dude. 
---
Did you win?
---
i play wild only (outside new hs year quests for maeiv/lunara) and i think wild should eb untouched for nefs unless its like naga overtop and baku and genn but not power but cause design those 2
---
,it needs lot more cards unerfed. but in general wild should imo be left alone it sorts itself out.
---
And if 1deck is among top for long but not opressive/bad for game who cares, it will happen eventually anyway its eternal format. and nerfs escpially latly have just made it worse then before nerfs.
---
&gt;  Also Ziliax isn’t the center or wincon of literaly any deck.
---
Against aggro, he is your win con. Ziliax is arguably the strongest card in the game for that matchup.
---
Reinstall hearthstone 
---
I'd go zul'jin, it's a more versatile card and isn't rotating in April
---
Out of all the nerfs that one is the most nonsensical.  Shaman has no meta presence in any format
---
&gt; In my experience, they ALWAYS stop roping me when I do this.
---
Same. But I continue to rope them for the rest of the game anyways.
---
I thought Whizbang isn't even allowed to played in ranks 50-25..?
---
what?
---
Combos like that already existed with Knife Juggler and Silver Hand Recruit generation tools except better. It could quite easily be a late game board sweep while you kept your board. Even then, it was only just powerful enough in addition to the other applications Equality had to warrant usually one copy of Equality in K&amp;C Silver Hand Paladin.
---
The nerf to Equality may have had something to do with future proofing design, but it also could have quite as easily been that Team 5, now with about five years of card design experience speficifally under their belt, felt that a effect that casts Hunter's Mark on everything without targeting is far more valuable than two mana
---
Flametongue was definitely too good. It’s a 4/3 charge if you have 2 minions on board, in a class that specializes in keeping minions on board, with the potential upside of being 6/8/10 damage in token decks. It’s still strong at 3 in any deck that isn’t even shaman. 
---
I mean, it's logical for the CEO. He gets 15 millions.
---
Just because something is allowed within the game doesn't mean it is "socially acceptable / polite". From what I see on those posts, for a lot of people, roping is considered "impolite / being a jerk". The fact that you have the right to do it doesn't change anything to this. 
---
I mean, you totally have the right to wait 1min between each of your sentences when you are at the post office. And in some circumstances, you indeed need this time to know what to answer. But if you do it systematically, that's not kind to peoples that are waiting after you. (Even if sure, they could be listening some music, or come with a drink to wait, or learn to be patient)
---
Oof
---
It's just a meme but
---
https://youtu.be/0GrMSs6Mb5Y
---
Made an edit since others seem to be downvoting me for making that comment. Thanks for taking the time to reply rather than downvoting and ignoring. 
---
I don't think 25% is accurate, just made up a number for the sake of conversation. The point simply being that it's a terrible card to draw. 
---
If you could see it getting nerfed from a 3 mama 0/4, then why not make it one?
---
If you're not even certain of whether a 3 mana 0/4 is broken, then what's the harm in trying it? It's not like they can't nerf it again.
---
I'd rather try smaller, incremental changes so nerfed cards have a chance of some viability.
---
&gt;kill command is only good in decks with access to beasts
---
All aggressive and midrange hunter decks have access to beasts through at the very least Animal Companion and generally early game minions, but even Spell Hunter runs Kill Commands. In fact, now that I look at it, KC is even more ubiquitous in Hunter than Flametongue was in Shaman.
---
I respect the view that Flametongue was too good at 2 mana (even if I don't agree), but I don't think it being a staple in an archetype is sufficient reason to nerf it when there are many other staples that go unnerfed, especially if it isn't an autoinclude in every archetype. It's strong in decks looking to play early game minions and keep board control, but Shaman has other archetypes that don't want it. I don't think that alone is enough for it to be nerfed, and I suspect Blizzard just wanted to nerf Even Shaman (the only playable Shaman deck which matched Flametongue's strengths quite well) rather than make a stand on whether archetype staples should exist.
---
It was a one time occurrence 
---
You dust all your collection and play wall priest
---
Nerd
---
Wolf is nowhere near the power of Flametongue. The totem synergy was a nice plus but the real power came from that insane +2 attack buff and the fact it had 3 health instead of 2. Flametongue had the highest played winrate, followed closely by Thing From Below. In my opinion they should've nerfed TFB instead..
---
Its just too easy to be a “late game fest” it often feels like whoever can bigdick it turn 20 wins. Too many matches coming down to kazakus rng, or resurrect rng.  
---
Nice logic. Then no class or archetype is ever dead.
---
K lmao
---
The "minion gains 6 health when attacked" secret seems like it'd see play in some inner fire deck though.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NG5N-L2GSQ
---
I was thinking it's Auchenai, but you can see on the history bar that the 3 attack minion on his board is [[Electra Stormsurge]]. It also couldn't have been [[Auchenai Phantasm]].

I don't know. I reached Rank 1 full Stars once. Lost the Game and tilted down to rank 4 in one losing streak. Lol.
---
Successful companies have sales all the time. 
---
Remind yourself that the game is fun and losing is part of the game. If you don’t enjoy playing the game or are getting tilted, just take a break.
---
Im saying the cost of crafting a wild card is the same as crafting a standard card, there is a cap on how expensive a deck can be standard or wild. If someone gets into standard and doesnt dust their cards they have a leg up compared to someone who opens a few packs for mtg and tries to play legacy with that pile. Id say just dusting and crafting is much easier and surefire than having to trade up cards for 6+ years.
---
I want more disruption tools, and interaction for oppressive decks. I also don't see how bringing back 10 or 12 tier 3, 2 and 1 decks would hurt the metagame, it would just provide more variety in what you can play against. 
---
&gt;you saw this with Priest's old board clear (Auchenai+Circle of Healing) is that 2 cards combos for the early game are very inconsistent
---
The difference is that Priest needed the combo to clear those minions immediately or it would lose.
---
Whereas Paladin can draw it later on and still clear all the board.
---
Not sure who made the deck but Dekkster popularized it by climbing to rank #12 legend and posting a guide on the competitive sub reddit one forum over.  After that it seemed to gain further popularity on stream and in the game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The deck concept however is largely based off an older deck with the same strategy though using witchwood grizzlies and damaged stegadon (sorry if spelling is wrong) rather than grizzlies and enforcers.
---
It is basically just another AFK til i OTK priest deck with a couple notable differences, mostly being northshire clerics and the fact that it needs a two turn set up since the enforcers and/or grizzlies lack charge.  It has resurrect so is weakest to cards like hex.
---
lmao look this guy actually has friends
---
Mecha'thun Priest. 
---
Something something please asign a flair something something (Bots are being lazy today)
---
I'm wiping 
---
Not to mention how much stronger of a body it is than sorcerers apprentice, especially in priest. It’s ability was great and carried countless games but it didn’t need to be overstatted too. 
---
Why?  It wasn't running the meta anymore, that was more of a release-RKR thing.  Most people had moved on to other Hunter decks from what I'd seen.
---
No this time it required calling her a fourth rate duelist with a fifth rate deck
---
Ass to grass
---
That pesky 5/5 ghoul throws everything off with his two fives.
---
Hot take: the reason combo decks/hunter are so prevalent in the standard format is because odd warrior exists as a competitive deck and people are sick of playing against it.
---
Taunt Druid doesn't run UI, too clunky.
---
Thanks fam
---
I bet they could have given someone $1 million to push through massive lay offs
---
And who the fuck are you?
---
pack = 100 gold
---
even the worst lunar quest is 60 gold + 60 dust (and the top 100 + 100)
---
roughly, 1 gold = 1 dust
---
so yes re roll the pack quests too
---
No matter what the meta is theres always a zoo lock or midrange hunter list thatll get you to legend in under 2k dust
---
i recommend against dusting cards just cuz they rotate... what if you wanna play wild later?  thrall is not competitive but is a lot of fun.
---
I played 57 games from 12-5 as big priest. 12 of them were mirror matches, so a touch over 20% for me. 
---
paladin?
---
Cube should either have
---
Deathrattle : Summon two 1/1 copies of it  
---
or  
---
Deathrattle : Summon 1 copy of it.
---
Change my mind on this. Two full copies of what you destroyed was a very gross powerlevel creep even before the ideas of spell like Feign Death existing. 
---
I can keep playing as normal and everything, its just that half the textures spontaneously disappear. Only thing that fixes it is going into my collection for some reason. Then everything's fine again until it randomly happens again.

---
it's the opposite at rank 5 everyone and their mother is playing combo here
---
at the higher ranks aggro is favored since it results in a quicker climb and those decks are cheaper
---
anyway you can just make a control deck and farm them if you want
---
This right here, my only win was T4 barnes into rag, into res rag &amp; vivid nightmare, all on face and he didn't have any bounce. That MU is hell.
---
it's really a midrange deck that can play like aggro since it goes face a lot
---
they lost a lot of power (and hsreplay numbers back this) after the nerf and (no pun intended) priest is in a class of its own at this time IMHO
---
Man cut this, they've nerfed epics or legendaries several times in the past 2 years, I'd wager they're about half the nerfs including the recent one.
---
don't play hunter personally but zuljin is in standard much longer so that'd be my recommendation
---
but really the deck needs both
---
paladin literally has a spell that makes you immune. and you can use it twice. his DK hero power is literally an otk. no rng required, unlike with cloning gallery priest
---
K
---
Sorry to say this but... you deserve this
---
Odd warrior is annoying as hell but your deck is even more obnoxious as are all the other priest decks (which are arguably much worse, at least yours does play some minion interaction) that do nothing for turn after turn after turn then OTK
---
You are playing a top tier deck and odd warrior is a lower tier than you and they played around your win condition, so what do you expect?
---
Imagine how other players feel when they do an attrition battle for 15 turns then you just mind blast them to death.
---
Forgive me if I don’t use the appropriate lingo.
---
Whoa I just came here from hearthstone because I’m a F2P newb who just made it to around rank 20 and I’m running into a problem where if I can’t do significant damage by turn seven or eight, the other player starts playing legendary cards and I can’t sweep back the tide.
---
What’s funny is the last game I played was against a UI using Druid who came back from 4 health and wrecked me. They had a quest deck where if you played seven taunt minions you got a card that made every minion in your deck cost zero. UI the first time got them the taunt minions, UI the second time filled their hand with zero cost minions. Granted I’m a mage user and my vex crow accidentally summoned a doomsayer when I had him against the ropes. He cleverly played the beast that made his minions cost zero that turn. 
---
Regardless the only legendary card I have is a Pyros and I feel like that’s a very tame, appropriate way to approach powerful legendary cards. You get a 2/2, 6/6 and 10/10 minion in your deck for one slot. If the enemy has a silence card, then you lose the other ones. Further, every Pyros has to be played from your hand at cost. 
---
Sorry if this is disjointed but I’m still learning how to talk about the game. I appreciate hearing your rant coming from a seasoned player. I keep running into decks that are built around stalling until the opponent has the mana to completely change the rules of the game, and it doesn’t seem particularly strategic, it just feels like I’m playing against kids who have nicer toys than I do. 
---
Tbh it was a buff for me because I blew equality too early vs aggro like all the time.
---
Your view matches most of say... I'm going to give it a shot purely for the story. Which will almost definitely be terrible. But I'm a weird lore need when it comes to blizzard games. 
---
I consider it more of a fun deck than actually good
---
So if it's worth the fun then go for it but if not I wouldn't
---
maly is always gonna be a safe craft IMHO though
---
Good.
---
They should be weak to aggro.
---
very valid point BUT paladin's clears, now that equality has been nerfed to 4 mana, do not compare to priests.  Also the DK OTK is much more tedious to pull off, requiring a lot more cards, than the priest OTKs, IMHO.
---
anyway just a difference of opinion but I do get your point for sure!
---
And these retarded morons downvoting because I asked a question. Time to get off reddit, it's becoming more toxic than twitch chat, specially this sub.
---
Im sad to be losing charged devilsaur..
---
I think i can handle losing psychic scream for priest.. but my big beast priest is gonna be screwed without devilsaurs
---
I never called evenlock aggro I said "it's really a midrange deck"
---
I think you and I are in an agreement here &gt;&lt; you disagree with the OP not me.
---
Blazing for the Shudderwocks, and any grinder Shaman would run 2x Stonehill.  So could play at least 4x Saronites and as many Shudders as Hagatha chose to give.
---
Looks like you can't write english for shit.

Kazakus mage?

The strongest thing about Reno Mage was playing Ice Block and then Heal up to full with Reno. Once Reno rotated, the whole reason to play Reno Mage vanished.

Your internet connection can be up and hearthstone can still disconnect from the server. There are several posts about this on the subreddit if you search for it, the same thing that happened to you happened to them too.

---
How do you make one of these? Hunter player and I want this on my mantle. 
---
r/fuckhunter
---
I've been playing elemental mage fir the last 4 months and i believe the best way to counter it is either otk decks (mechathun druid is almost impossible to win against) or odd warrior to outlast them through seer armor generation and removal. Any card with "cannot be targeted by spells and hero powers" is also very strong since usually the only non-spell removal mages run is one voodo-doll.
---
For Jaraxxus, you want to be able to taunt up and have some adequate healing to get to Jaraxxus.  
---
Since you're a new player, you probably want to invest in the most cost effective cards (so Classic cards, and something that isn't going to rotate any time soon).  Cards that come to mind are Earthen Ring Farseer, Sunfury Protector, Siphon Soul, Shadowflame. There was an older deck that was well received (and continues to be a popular nostalgia trip) called Handlock. For that flavour of Control Warlock, you need Twilight Drake and Mountain Giant.
---
Add in some of the basic board clears like Hellfire and Mortal Coil and you got a pretty good deck going.  If you're looking for more minions, you can throw in things like Senjin Shieldmasta.
---
If you want to get fancy, you can start adding some of the new cards in there like Shriek, Jeklik and Soulwarden (much less budget though)
---
You really want the 2xTerrorscale Stalker and 2x Witchwood Grizzly, if not the rest of the deathrattle package, in that deck.  There's way too many times that Play Dead and Corpse-dude can become dead cards.  Spiderbombs are also great removal with those combos.
---
If you bounce back to hand when their hand is full, it counts as destroying the minion and triggers deathrattles. If hand is full and a minion is burned from overdraw, then the minion is essentially removed from game
---
How is it a "right" to waste someone else's time?
---
Yes, the game gives you 75 seconds in case you need it, but the "end turn" button is there for you to use when you've made your moves!
---
You sound like and obnoxious dickhole, tbh.
---
Great idea!
---
Congratulations!
---
Something wrong, I hold my head, Flametongue gone, a totem dead
---
Quest druid is my favorite deck archetype of all time.

Spellstone will bounce back, it's still an insane card at 6.

Hi reddit,
---
long time lurker, thought this was worthy to share!
---
I've been playing since beta and pretty much played through all metas since then.
---
It's been quite a journey!
---
Honestly curious, if your haven't played in more than 2 years, how did you find this post?
---
I don't know why people are downvoting. I had a phone that just barely met the specs for hearthstone. Quite often it would just be running so slowly or disconnect so often that every single turn I hit my rope and quite often lost games in which I needed to make more than two or three actions in a turn.

Quests are terrible cards that make every game play out linearly from the beginning. At least DKs and other hero cards make the game mechanically more interesting.
---
Just play odd quest warrior.  I farm the ladder up to rank 5 the last couple months with that deck.

I get that and it is really important not to run out of eggs.  I played another game where the Hunter cubed an egg when he had a 1/1 devilsaur on board from shrink Ray. He lost three turns later because he only had a board full of eggs left. I get that cubing egg has its uses, but players need to stop doing it so mindlessly lol.

I honestly never really liked the quests that much since I felt like there was little to no counter-play. You can't really do much to delay the opponent finishing their quest (other than a little bit Rogue, but they're still gonna finish it quickly) and most of them really weren't even that good or usable. I did sort of like the Priest quest though, that one felt alright to me.

100%? So... two out of two?
---
I’ve had success with mid-range hunter and found it can be pretty cheap to craft. I even did ok without being able to craft master’s call for a while
---
How does Fortnite esports even work?
---
Yeah mulligan has been/is one of my biggest problems always
---
Assuming you have a decent classic collection, I would focus on packs from Witchwood, Boomsday and Rastakhan. While their power level is lower than Un’Goro, KoFT and Kobolds, those cards will be legal in standard after the April rotation.

You can calm it that but watch any streamer playing it(warshack,trump on YouTube) and they’ll probably mention that it’s a control deck for the most part some version are more combo like but the deck that I’m playing is control
