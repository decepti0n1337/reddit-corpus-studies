Silver immediately stood up for Morey, he didn't wait for backlash. The translation that confused everyone was *not* done by his office and possibly not even an NBA employee ("NBA China" is jointly produced by the NBA and Weibo, and the Washington Post stated that the translation sounded a lot like official state media statements from China - it was probably translated by Weibo).

Stop what? Stop asking karma whores to gtfo so this sub can talk about its main topic, Hearthstone?
---
I can understand where you're coming from, but you have to understand other people's opinions as well. Hearthstone may be just a game to you, but it's become a symbol to others of how companies will lick boots and kiss assholes in order to please China. It's showing us of a trend that a lot of people didn't even know was there, a trend that CAN affect people in here personally.
---
It's become the latest symbol in a long line of them. (Most) Gamers didn't care when a Marriott employee was fired for liking the wrong tweet. Many people didn't care when the NBA had to censor a general manager, or when google and apple were pulling apps from their stores. But this event was a wake-up call to the players - playing a game and saying something that China doesn't want can lead to censorship and punishment. It's more personal to gamers when it's one of them, when it's a fellow fan and enthusiast getting trampled underfoot instead of someone unrelated.
---
So while I understand your frustration and I can see your side of things, please look at the larger picture. Look at this as gamers standing up together as a community against a much greater evil, and showing solidarity and compassion for real-life events. Please consider how if we don't stand up now, how long before we see this censorship spreading throughout other games? How long before you have to wonder whether or not saying or doing the wrong thing in game can lead to a company across the globe singling you out for punishment?
---
This may fall on deaf ears, but consider more than the here-and-now. Consider the future, ask yourself if you're OK with Blizzard's non-apology and if you're comfortable with the way that China has been worming their way into the things you love and are trying to change them to conform to their vision and values instead.
---
I have not looked up the Webster dictionary on the definition on propaganda but I thought it was related to false information used for political purposes. After thinking about it I agree with your use of the word propaganda in your statement. Been seeing a lot of propaganda at my university in support of China.
---
Well, one of us desperately stalks people's comments when they run out of valid arguments and one of us doesn't. Such is life. You're probably one of those weak Tim Pool "liberals."
---
Yes. They were hired by Blizzard as representatives of the company, and it was their job to try as best as they were able to ensure the event went smoothly and in accordance with the image Blizzard wanted to project. That clearly is not what happened. 
---
They'd be fine if they were simply ignorant of what was going to happen, or acted as if they were. When they started laughing on-air at the shitshow that they knew was about to unfold at their employer's expense, it's pretty understandable that their employer isn't all that happy with them.
---
"Punishment" is an odd way of putting it in the first place. They have no particular right to be hired by Blizzard for an event. If Blizzard thinks that they actively contributed to this mess, they'd obviously in the future want to hire someone who won't.
---
Lol from retards in comments and in whole section.
---
They were moderators, they were fully awair about what's gonna happen, they were from Taiwan as I remember? I guess so they acted like a bias morons letting it go. I mean if my country is having conflict with another country to let offensive messages towards my countries "enemy" would be a disasterous for my reputation and it would be considered as sabotage and abusing my power for my own political views. Damaging "own" country is morally fine, though.
---
I'magine the situation where on some event hosted in CIS one of russian players with CIS moderators stands up and shout something like "Long live rebellious states of eastern Ukraine, fuck Ukraine" or smthing like that.
---
Or In GB - letting "Revolution now, Scotland will be free" from scottish player with, Argentinian moderators? That's absolutely inappropriate.
---
They didn't stop the damage to the company that pays them money. It's clearly that they made a reputational and direct $ damage of billions. I guess from Blizzard point of view they deserved a lifetime ban.
---
By directly telling the player to "say the words" and then hiding behind their desks, it could be interpreted as them effectively directly encouraging him to say it
---
&gt; Who make suspension decisions? 
---
Yeah. If that was made public, guess who's getting bullied of all social media including Linkedin?

https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3a5xx/blizzard-doesnt-respect-the-human-rights-of-its-customers-major-rights-organization-says
---
They're now human rights abusers.
---
Any reasonable person would say that that is an important topic for discussion here, seeing as how it's monitored by blizzard but not controlled by them.
---
Agreed, and to be clear, this is ILLEGAL.  Always get the offer in writing.  Always.
---
Also, avoid interfering with pedestrians and the flow of traffic. Most people around and about the area will have no idea what Blizzard is or what happened. Ruining their trip to Disneyland makes you the bad guy in their eyes.

Why are people downvoting you?
---
&gt; Just check the upvote ratings of the Hong Kong related posts.
---
I'm not sure what this is trying to prove.
---
While way overkill imo, it's not new. You can have your credit card on your account, you could be a spiteful ex who wants the account owner to suffer and lose all of their precious games and progress.  The photo id stipulation to recover, remove or otherwise permanently alter an account had been a thing for years. That said, I've quit hearthstone, Diablo and starcraft all together.  Blizzard gets no more money from me. Ever.
---
How dare they punish a person for going political on a stream that is supposed to be 6+! And how dare I ask for Hearthstone discussion on r/hearthstone. I guess all HS discussion belongs to r/HongKong.
---
Really cool game, doesn't quite match HS for me but im still loving it.
---
&gt; You're probably one of those weak Tim Pool "liberals."
---
Wrong again.  I'm awestruck by the vastness of your arrogance and the simplicity of your understanding of things.   Interesting.
---
This is the silly part to me.  Blizzard walks back the punishment and it still comes off as draconian for the sake of appeasing China.  Blitzchung even said he thought the 6 months for himself was still a bit harsh, and I completely agree.  The casters don't need to be made an example of at all though.
---
It feels like Blizzard isn't even capable of walking this back enough to appease their western audiences because they're more concerned with appeasing China.  They just hope they've done enough for this to blow over, when what they've done isn't at all reassuring.
---
Anyway, I don't need this sub to be in constant riot state forever lest we not forget this.  It's simply the case for me now that I'm no longer comfortable giving Blizzard money.
---
Yup.
---
Why do you believe human rights abusers should be let off the hook?
---
They told him to get it over with because censoring someone's speech is against the tenants of the company that hired them.
---
Cause Blizzard are too busy bending over before China these days... Mine also crashes a lot. Mostly happens in crafting/deck managing.

When you post hearthstone gaming content.
---
I thought by "boot licker" he was referring to the original person who wrote the comment criticising the casters?
---
nah it's pretty fucked
---
what if, lez say feno has right believes and is a neonazi in disguise... so in a stream he tells frodan that he desperatly wants to talk some nazi-shit but they tell him "only one line".
---
than on matchday they interview and at the end, frodan gives in "say ur statement and move on", he goes "sieg heil, hitler was right".
---
would frodan be at fault here? ofc he would, so punishing those guys is totally acceptable... but reddit is full of hypocrits, asians, liberals and sjw-morons ofc they cant accept rules and consequences.
---
Then head on over to Blizzard's forums. You'll be happier there, I think.
---
No reason for frustrating yourself.

when you stop complaining about what other people are posting about and start contributing game-related content to the sub you ridiculous hypocrite.

Hong kongers are taking action. And they should, and i support them. Everyone else is speaking their mind as you said, which im sorry, is not going to have an effect on China's decision.
---
Their job was to interview and they did their job, their job wasnt to censor him.
---
You missed what a lot of people were actually upset about. Yes this was sparked by blitz and the casters being banned but why did blizzard have to go nuclear with their punishment? Because he talked shit about China, so he had to go and the casters had to go because they were there and allowed it in a sense by letting him talk.
---
Need anymore proof just look at the weibo post made shortly after the ban declaring themselves as protecting their national pride. They have made no real apology. Sure they shorted the ban but didn’t apologize or acknowledge the blatant support for the countries pride comment. 
---
If you want players to not be political don’t take a political side after you ban someone for being political. Even if this is done by blizzards China branch, it’s still not a branch of blizzard. You can’t just ignore it like it’s some other unrelated business.
---
Blizzard could have asked to take it down since it has created a divide. Just how they tried to take down Blitzchung's video since it has created a "divide".
---
Curious - how is this considered low effort? I dont see this on karmadecay nor google image searching. Is this a repost im not seeing (nor karmadecay)?
---
Thanks. Glad you noticed that. Also 🎰
---
Oh, by the way you also misinterpreted the post in your screenshot. He literally said "I'll put another 100 million into this game" which is by no means to be taken seriously. Imagine calling one an extreme nationalist because he told a joke wtf. If you do read Chinese you're misinterpreting his words on purpose then, shame on you.
---
What I believe you are meaning to say is "Blizzard violated Blitzchung's right to *protest* for human rights."
---
Note that this is an entirely different claim from "Blizzard is violating human rights."
---
I can assure you rhetoric doesn't work on me. Just throwing out the phrase "but muh human rights" is not, and never will be a complete argument. Try again.
---
They want Chinese money
---
I agree. I went with 7,7,7 for it's meaning. He is definitely more powerful than this stat
---
Dr. Balanced is still a perfectly fine 7 drop however
---
There are many Americans who love their country, but hate the current government. This is not possible in China. The CCP replaced "nationalism" and "patriotism" 70 years ago.

Thanks DarkChild, have a good day and remember that China is number 1
---
Thank you 🙏🏼

Toast can do what he wants. I won't watch him playing the game, but Toast is still awesome.

He's a pretty interesting character. I'm not sure what games he's working on these days but his time at Firefall is an [entertaining read](https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story).
---
If Blizzard were so concerned that a caster/player saying the wrong thing could cause the Chinese government to take violent action against their employees, *they should never have set up an office in China*. It's that simple.  
---
  
---
*Fuck China*.
---
Looks like most HTC phones, and Google Pixels.  Samsung has manufacturing in several countries and seems like you can figure out from which based on the IMEI number.

Oh, and Caterpillar is partnered with a British manufacturer to produce a line of phones.

Mind you Im not planning on a phone purchase for a good while.

Is it adding Hench-Clan Thug as well? Recently played against a Mage running that and Sharkfin Fan, now I'm wondering if they just ran with the deckbuilder results.

You have to counter ShamanStone right now if you want to win.

Probably net downvoted b/c people don't agree you should be telling people how to vote.  People just downvote on /r/hearthstone/new a lot.

If the past is a good predictor, most of this should thin out in a week or so.  Then probably have a strong resurgence around Blizzcon.

Indeed, talk about it. Just not in this gaming subreddit. Go to r/HongKong
---
I mean Valve still fund their biggest tournament by selling pointless tat to fans and only putting a small part of the proceeds toward the actual players.
---
It's just how it's done. People love games; corporations exploit that.
---
But it does though, prolonged exposure to this issue makes sure that Blizz and Activision can't sweep it under the rug, and people can't say "no one cares about this anymore". 
---
It forces the national conversation on the matter, and continued protests and making scenes at their events tells them we're not forgetting or are we going toet them pretend it never happened.
---
That's the point of a boycott and protest.
---
Except that's all just...wrong lol
---
Here in Britain we protest by obstructing the Queen's highway. How, you ask? We turn up on Waterloo bridge and crack out the tea and scones.
---
Providing it's peaceful it's very effective - the police can only arrest so many, and such things are often pre-arranged with the police along the lines of "Hi, we're doing this, we know it's illegal but it won't be violent, so how can we make your life as easy as possible?"
---
Fantastic use of a historical reference point. Take an upvote.
---
I'm not removing it to censor and impede freedom of speech, I'm removing it because you broke Rule 2.
---
I feel like "I'm not angry, just disappointed" sums up my feelings in this way. I don't feel right calling people out on a relatively minor incident. For example my wife probably won't stop playing WoW unless they shut their doors outright condone murder in the streets. But on the other hand, this event is not happening in a vacuum and so it says something about us, how we react in times like this. As minor as it seems, history shows that these are the events that fuel the larger events. It's hard to be caught up in not judging someone I love for just wanting to enjoy a small part of her life like she (and I) has done for many years, and knowing that sitting on the sidelines permits Blizzard to acquiesce to the whims of the next Nazi Regime.
---
Maybe try another website then. I know that you don’t know what’s going on or care about it since it doesn’t affect you directly but others do. This is a sub about a game. So talking about the developers and what they do is perfectly acceptable.
---
You really don’t understand how these things work, do you? Others have pointed out how utterly wrong you are, so I won’t repeat what they said.
---
I'm actually pissed he took the prize money back.
---
"reddit freaked out on him."
---
Not at all. A minority of people pointed out his clickbait and he made a big deal out of it because he's thin-skinned and he knew his sheep would then make a big deal out of it.
---
Well yeah, I mean isn't it completely reasonable that I get punished for what someone else says?
---
Just the other week, I got news I was suspended from work for six months and my pay for that period would be reduced to $0 all because my co-worker hurt someone's feelings by claiming that people deserve human rights and a choice on who runs their country.
---
Perfectly fair and reasonable imo.
---
Your deck is already viable, usually meme at that point, and other buckets would only clog up deck with pointless cards with no synergy.
---
How dare you! Wouldn't you rather see yet another post of someone deleting their blizzard account?!
---
Are you kidding me? It absolutely is. There are probably more people pro Hong Kong in the US than pro LGBT. And worldwide I doubt being pro LGBT is even a majority of the population seeing how China, India and Indonesia regard it. 
---
It’s absolutely a sensitive subject, maybe not in the west so much, but your view is pretty limited.
---
Yes and no. I agree with your overall sentiment, but it's also reasonable to understand that things change quickly in geopolitics. Protesting in Hong Kong started 31 March of this year. Assuming the Shanghai studio has been open longer than that, Blizzard may not have had as much reason to fear reprisal from the Chinese when they originally set up. If their tenure there goes back far enough (and I have no idea when it started), then they might have actually set up shop during an era before the trade wars, when relationships with China were actually improving.
---
Android crashing? I am running on a s8 and it runs fine
---
Think about how hard they had been milking us. Brode knew all of it, and got out before it got bad.
---
It used to work pretty good - I could start with a couple cards, and it would give me a meta deck with those cards in it. I think something broke a couple of patches ago, because it's only giving me garbage decks now. 
---
I've also noticed that it never puts in a golden and a non-golden version of the same card.
---
What I don't get is this -- Are the casters supposed to use their subjective sense of what is appropriate to censor the content of the stream?
---
I get that maybe the HK statement might be less subjective as it's clearly political in nature.  But, what of much more subjective situations?  What if all Blitzchung did was make a subtle reference?  Or just wear the mask without saying anything?  What if an American streamer has a MAGA hat on or is wearing a Bernie t-shirt?
---
Are casters now supposed to be the judge of what is appropriate?  I sure hope they're being paid for that type of responsibility, then.
---
It always amazes me when companies invest nothing into their "employees" and then demand those employees understand perfectly what they want.

---
While 4 balances out as bad luck in chinese as well.
---
I disagree with this mindset, but to each their own. I would rather not go around assuming that because someone can take advantage of me, that they will do so. 
---
Aside from that, let's assume that they do have contracts and Blizzard refused to pay. Does that really change the situation? If Blizzard is determined not to pay them, then it's not like the casters have the legal resources to fight for their pay. The pay for a single event is also not worth litigation over. So it's not like the existence of a contract would mean that Blizzard couldn't still do this. Contract or not, the casters would still have to have some level of trust that Blizzard would pay them for their work.
---
Why do you need them to do any of that? They denied their relationships in China *specifically* influenced their decision because that’s obviously true. They, and any other company, would do the same thing (obviously not as harshly) in the future in a similar context as they should. You need companies to explain obvious influences to you and apologize for punishing people for hijacking their brand to make political statements in hostile political environments?
---
Chindivision.
---
Depends on whether there is evidence whether they are in on it or not. But very likely it will be a blanket ban (the stuff I mentioned above) on everyone involved just to be on the safe side.
---
Going forward, I’m almost certain Blizzard will go for a longer delay on their broadcast to stop such issues. Just needs one staff with a hand hovering over the red button,
---
Verbal agreements hold up in court with proof (ie recording) or witnesses.

Im having a blast now with this deck, and I can garantee that secrets are the core of the deck. Rhyssa, challenger, early secret sinergy are the powerhouse. Anyway, the name on HS replays is Secret highlander deck, so... It's up to you craft the golden Rhyssa.

Man I've had it crash on me so many times its frustrating. I refuse to play PvP because of the random disconnects. Hopefully they fix it with this next patch Wednesday.

human rights *in general*. the general *cause* of *all human rights*. 
---
I believe free speech is a basic human right, ones that governments have no right to take away, and corporations have even less right to take away, i dont care what is in their rules, or a countries laws, or not. its an unalienable, self evident right. 
---
Blitzchung's right to free speech is not the only human right at stake here, but more importantly those he speaks for (which no co-incidence, is THE POINT of free speech).
---
So essentially the company that blizzard partnered with just to be in the Chinese market because they had to can make political statements and we should allow blizzard to shrug “Yeah that’s them guys. It’s just our game and licensing/ trademark.” 
---
Can’t even be bothered to say that the view point of Netease and any comments made by them do not reflect the view point of Blizzard HQ.
---
I think you’re either getting upset with or replying to the wrong person. The person you’re responding to didn’t sound like they were supporting Blizzard. Just pointing out that saying ‘China had nothing to do with it’ is just as much a political statement as ‘China is why we did it’.
---
Basically a tip jar for the CEO and absolutely nothing more
---
They knew what Blitzchung was up to and asked him to say it. Why would anyone continue to employ people that incompetent after the shit storm it would have led to regardless of how Blizzard reacted?
---
 
---
Sorry, wrong sub. You are looking for [r/FuckBlizzard](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckBlizzard/) or whatever. We talk about cards here.
---
Not really. If you choose to not support blizzard why give them your play time? they record their MAU and show to investor
---
So if they are bad as you make out why reduce it to 6 months then?  
---
Nice to see what side of the fence you sit on though, always knew you to be the Blizzard apologist you clearly are.
---
Was gonna get mad at you for bring overly serious but I re-read your post and you are right. OP didn't have bad intentions with this and the majority of people who see this are aware of what's going on and know it hasn't escalated to the stage you described. OP should save his meme and repost it in about 1-2 months
---
Blitzchung said he supports blizzard and is competing in the next gramdmasters.
---
I'm talking about boiling water, homie.
---
Boiling. Water.
---
Chung stood up and said something in the full face of major threats to his livelihood and possibly his life. How do you think he got to that place in his life? He doesn't live in a free country dude. He lives in a place where the police will assault you if you're wearing goggles and a mask. He lives in a place where the government can take everything he has, legally. The boycott is because everyone should have the freedom to say that you support a cause without the threat of losing your job and paycheck. Doesn't that worry you? It's him today, but it is very likely you tomorrow. 
---
Besides that point, you could make your own mind up about what freedom is and what it's worth to you instead of relying on someone else to fight in your place. That's giving a lot of authority to someone else to make decisions for you.
---
You have all of he information about the situation at your disposal. Some people don't have the information because they live a in a country with censorship. You can make up your mind and no one can tell you what your decision should be. But you have to decide if you're doing something because it's the right thing for everyone, or if it's the right thing for you personally, or if you're sitting out because you don't give a shit. 
---
Would it be fair to say, Blitzchung himself most likely isn't even going to boycott Blizzard so why should everyone else do so when we could hope that it doesn't happen to us?
---

&gt;Blitzchang deserved his punishment but blizzard also needs to take a more strict stance against politics in general.
---
Huzzah! A comment of quality!
---
The punishment could have been a warning. That’s the punishment other players have gotten for actually cheating, which seems a more serious rules violation than supporting human rights during a post game interview.

It was never about the situation in HK for me anyway as much as it was the unfair treatment against people for viewing their rather mild opinions publicly (2 of which did nothing).
---
Are people not allowed to be pissed off about this? Are you saying that loyal fans like myself who have enjoyed Hearthstone and other Blizzard games for the past several years, who practically grew up playing Blizzard games, shouldn't be allowed to voice their anger and concern toward Blizzard's shitty actions recently? Like it or not, this is still very relevant to Hearthstone. People want news and updates on the situation, and what better place to put and find those updates then the community centred around the source of the issue?

If you sort by new, or even by hot, you'll definitely see a lot of gameplay related content. Maybe try that.

The battle.net account still exists, you just don't have access to it. If you want to get it back, contact support and explain the issue. If you have ID and control over whatever card/paypal account/etc you used to buy things on the account (if any), you should be able to recover it.

Do you really think China would have banned such a massive company from their country because of the statement of an individual that is not representative of blizzard on a stream? Your speculation that it would be economic suicide for blizzard do have done nothing at all has no basis.  Its speculation.

Human rights are more important than profits. Bottom line. There's no controversy or neutral stance. Human rights are not politics. Appeasement of governments that commit human rights violations again... is not ok or acceptable.

I think he said, "Liberate Honkhonk" which is definitely a call to action.

7mana 7/7 is a bit shite isnt it
---
To everyone in this thread that is trying to shift the blame to "the casters" that "encouraged" blitzchung to say the 8 words, 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
to be VERY SPECIFIC, if u even watched the clip, it was Tommy that said that line, meanwhile the other Mr Yee said NOTHING and received the same punishment. How is this even fair ?
---
My take, the casters do not deserve any punishment, it was 100% the production team's fault for putting them on the spot AND ALSO air that interview, when the production team has the full ability to just censor the whole interview and just play ads and end the stream.
---
How the hell is it unrelated to Heartstone? Heartstone literally started this?
---
Stand up for human rights...

It kinda looks like you’re playing the battery gambling game where at any given second a coin flip happens and the fate of your phone is decided, at least for the next 2 minutes.
---
sometimes using free speech has consequences. maybe getting fired from a grocery store for telling off a customer, or getting kicked out of a venue for screaming into someone elses mic. 
---
sometimes what the person is saying is rude, sometimes is an idea that needs to be spread for the better of the world. these finer details arent all that important to the issues here. Blitzchung shared his idea in a very civil way. he wasnt shouting in someones window, or following someone around yelling. 
---
whats important is that terrible things are happening to people in Hong Kong and its better for the whole world if we let more people know and do things to help instead of trying to silence people.
---
Don't bring back the trend of rags killing/healing insects.
---
Tri-class cards can also discover DKs. :)
---
You know they shortened the ban, right?
---
Quotes plz
---
It wasn't about holding someone accountable, it was about setting an example.
---
Correction: “Krypton” in this context actually means “gacha” if you do a proper translation.
---
So he is saying he is going to spend more money on HS to support blizzard (in a joke/meme way)
---
Have the exact same problems, had no issues before the latest patch.
---
I think the argument here is 'yes, but the punishment is disproportionally harsh' in favor of this being not okay.
---
Perhaps you missed the previous point I made? The only times I've downvoted you are the times when you are blatantly incorrect. Also, "hahahaha"? Mmm, I love the smell of salt in the evening~
---
Also, I'm not taking anything too literally; if Toast wanted Blitz to be unbanned, he could have simply said that. Perhaps you really just hate Toast, but maybe you should admit to that fact before vehemently arguing? After all, the only rage I can feel here is from you~ 😉
---
Or ignore that he's about to talk about HK, not reference it, not acknowledge it and hurry up to the next segment if he does say it. You know, acting professional.
---
wahh

No one fucking cares what you do with your time. Leave already.

---
please join r/HongKong learning more story about the protesters, they need our concerning than ever, Thanks.
---
first off, who are you hoping streamers protest about? china or blizz? i hope you aren't implying that all streamers rally against china, because despite your view on it, streamers still reach only a small percentage of the global audience, and they are putting themselves at great risk for doing so. people with a greater audience have disappeared and the world still turned.
---
2nd, whats your place in all this to ask people who you only know through a computer screen, to put all which they have worked on, and throw it against blizz? you are expecting them to react accordingly to your view on the subject, exactly like blizz is, only on polar objectives. 
---
Freedom of speech goes both ways. They have the right to speak for themselves. Don't you dare tell them what to do
---
That’s a really good portrait! Would be cool if it had the HK lotus instead of the classic symbol.
---
&gt;I'm not taking anything too literally
---
Uh ye you are. If you think Toast should've started again if they increased his ban to 5 years, you're a bit of a sperg (no offense).
---
&gt; I love the smell of salt in the evening~
---
&gt;After all, the only rage I can feel here is from you~ 😉
---
What is projection? 😎
---
I agree, punishing him is not censorship. And I'm using free speech incorrectly.
---
However:
---
- VODs pulled globally, by blizzard, not just in China
---
- Shutting off live feeds during collegiate tournament
---
Both are forms of censorship, whether Blizzard is within their right to do so or not.
---
If two NA casters let someone say "Hillary 2016!" during a broadcast, it wouldn't have even been mentioned.
---
The appropriate punishment for these casters is "don't do that again, please."
---
China OMEGALUL
---
Then my question would be, "disproportionately harsh compared to what?" At my job, a serious mistep would result in immediate firing, not a 6 month "leave" status. If anything this punishment seems more than fair considering they will get to cast in the future. 
---
At the end of the day, if this was too harsh, then I have to ask myself "why would they sign their contracts with this in it then? Why not negotiate this down?" If you sign on the dotted line, you signed plain and simple. Crying about harshness is childish.
---
Have to disappoint you but this is due to self-imposed censorship and political correctness, not because of China. 
---
They have region specific launchers and if they were changing stuff for China they could've just pushed the changes for that region. Like they did in WoW with undead models.
---
Unless you have a strong leader that will implement communism, then you will never have communism.

Specialized websites of course, but not general media. They don't give a damn about kids' games.
---
Missed the 4 mana 7/7 opportunity
---
Honestly though, it should be also a sensitive and important issue that needs to be discussed for gamers too. No doubt that Hong Kong and the human right issues are important, but it is also equally important but in a different territory, cultures and media. It's not just HS and Blizz, companies are preemptively or retroactively applying censorship to their games (the same for movie and tv show industry too) for China. Currently, game developers that need to sell their games in China are mostly maintaining different versions each for China and not-China, but one day, they'll just develop one pro-china-censorship version only for less hassles to deal with. It's an invasion, but China itself is not actually invading, but practically.
---
Lol you’re so triggered.
---
Also dear you don’t seem to understand, your opinion on if you’re a shill or not, doesn’t bother me. It’s quite clear you’ve climbed so far up blizzards colon, you’re probably able to chew their food for them. So I’m not really assed what you think. 
---
Now as I’ve dismissed you repeatedly, maybe you’ll finally get the message... shoo shill.
---
Their job was also to interview the player.  They did that.
---
Like I asked, was their job also to judge what is and isn't appropriate for the broadcast?
---
Blitzchung deserves a punishment.  The casters don't.
---
If the casters cut the broadcast immediately when seeing Blitzchung in a gas mask and the community reacted negatively to perceived censorship and kowtowing to the CCP on HK, do you think those casters could shoulder the potential financial impact that could have on Blizzard?  Do you think either, being from Taiwan, could deal with the personal blow back?
---
Daryl Morey cost the Houston Rockets $25 million with a tweet because of China.  And, he's actually part of management and a US citizen.
---
How are two probably poorly paid casters supposed to act?
---
I strongly disagree with any punishment for the casters. This to a degree where I think less of Blizzard and value them lower as a brand. 
---
Everyone who helped make or enforce that decision towards the outcome of that getting a punishment should be sued for damage to the brand.
---
Homie do you think I agree with everything King said. His entire basis for his belief was the Christian God. I have read this letter and trust me it is in no way applicable to this situation.
---
I read russian media (because it's my native language), and despite it's not being censored and people being able to post whatever they like to, the absolute majority there is also supporting blizzard, mostly saying "they did a right thing by keeping politics out of the game, i came to play a game and nothing else". Every opposite opinion are rare and usually heavily downvoted.
---
Nice trick, you are too dumb to change my mind, so you convince yourself that I actually dont want to change my mind to give yourself an out. 
---
Have a terrible day, retard.
---
Like, why can‘t I boycott Blizzard because I support HK? Why do you think I boycott Blizzard because of Blitzchung?
---
And when there are people getting their organs harvested, or imprisoned for mundane things like wearing black shirts, or the concentration camps of the third reich get rebuild with muslim-Chinese, that’s none of your business, but when your favorite game gets boycotted, that’s a problem?
---
That seems very twisted to me. Just you all try to think about it.
---
Thanks man
---
So basically I'm an autist
---
&gt;Anyways, I think I'm done here. 
---
In case any random stumbles upon this: This is how you win an argument. I didn't sink to his level, I didn't resort to insults. I just picked his shitty arguments apart, and that broke him. GG.
---

---
Prove that I am shill. Go ahead. You can't. Also, if anything, I am amused by how pathetic abd stupid you are
---
What do they do? The text is inscrutable. "Combines" what? "Forever" what?
---
China and the west is two totaly different places when it comes to culture and how you say things etc. I doubt any other chinese company would handle it different than Netease. 
---
Either you accept that other parts of the world is different, or you say that everyone has to be like the west if we gonna accept them. 
---
I bet Blizzard will think globaly
---
Turns out people getting mad on social media isnt exactly the best way to ruin a company or support HK.
---
It's the problem with alot of modern causes that nobody does anything outside of shouting about in on social media platforms which has no lasting effects due to those platforms changing controversy every 3 days and outside of a very small % of people deleting accounts it's very likely that most will play again next expansion.
---
So many people love to get behind a cause like this but very few will actually make a change through fundraising or rallies.
---
But do they explicitly need to use my ID for it? I'm always rather cautious when people, especially large corporations, ask for my ID when I can, for example, safely get rid of a facebook account without the use of an ID.

The AU student did *not* sign the same contract as Chung. They signed a different contract with another agency. It did not contain the Blizzard clause.

The two cases aren't comparable. And if you don't believe me, then Chung himself said he doesn't think the two are comparable.

Are you saying the first tweet was posted before he knew anything about what had transpired regarding Blitzchung?
---
I'm the message everyone is both agreeing with AND disagreeing with. 
---
Everyone agreed with me that this is the biggest news in Hearthstone, then some people got all salty that I said yes, it's bigger news than some dumb temporary changes.
---
I can't believe you white knight cucks keep defending Blizzard when it is so fucking obvious. The exact same shit happens to so many people and it is no coincidence. They register that you are willing to spend money and then manipulate you into buying more by rigging the game. It' so obvious I actually hate Blizzard/Tencent and all you white knight cucks so much. Oh and don't dare calling me bad at the game. I easily climbed to Legend rank 300 then the exact same thing happened to me after buying 60 packs for a new deck. They are immoral human trash degenerates and they will burn in hell for what they are doing.

---
Nobody gives a shit buddy.
---
Yeah, I see it as an opportunity to show many other corporations that it is not ok to kowtow to China.
---
Not really that stupid. The bold and intrusive are getting what they want most of the time. If there would have been a little bit less protest against it and more careful handling by politicians and police they might have gotten away with it unharmed.
---
Just like with every other things, lawmakers always test the waters by just doing what they want to have and get repelled by other legislative organs or the public. Then they can just row back and pretent nothing happened if the outrage is too big or get a smaller law passed because its not as harsh as the original one.
---
Yeah sure. Although this is still a hearthstone sub so we might aswell talk about hearthstone.
---
The problem is that we aren't just talking about 5% here. The chinese mobile market is projected to become huge since large portions of China are lower class and lower middle class, but they can spent money on microtransactions for phone games.
---
Games like Diablo: Immortal and the undisclosed project with mobile developer job descriptions are supposed to cash in on that market.
---
What Blizzard would lose if they went against China is *immediately* 5% of their revenue *and* the possibility of getting into a growth market for mobile games, making them increasingly unattractive for investors.
---
This isn't even against western values. They have a *fiduciary duty*, which is an accepted concept in most western laws. If they were just making decisions for their own sake instead of trying their best to manage their investors money, they could face backlash for breaking their fiduciary duty.
---
Their stock didn't take a major hit and almost immediately recovered by 2.2% because this was the best decision from that point of view, even though it was *morally* questionable.
---
the enemy is somebody who isnt a potential moneymaker duuuh. how can you all be so fucking blind, retarded and loyal like good little dogs. fuck yall and fuck this degenerate company.
---
Blizzard should just rename this year's BlizzCon to BlizzKong and get it over with
---
What's the reward?
---
Except he's talking about the US where Hearthstone is 6+ and certain cards like Succubus could be a problem.
---
china isn't north korea.
---
I feel this on a personal level. I have played HS since launch and it's really hard to quit. But I just can't be content with myself knowing I'd support a company like this. Even if they don't care, I just can't.

Hey buddy, fuck off back to the bleachers ok? :)

I uninstalled everything and deleted my account completely. Don't want to deal with Blizzard anymore. It's plenty of other games that I can play instead out there.
---
*small indie company intesifies*
---
YiannisK#2702 80g on EU, you go first
---
And what you fail to see is they were trying to stifle people from deleting their data by requiring measures that were in direct violation of GDRP, and only when people threatened legal actions that blizzard tried to justify it by saying it was a big, but you go ahead and defend the pride of your overlords. I'm not going to sit here and argue with someone that so blindly follows a corrupt company.
---
Same way with you and your data. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Thank you for sharing! We are standing with you!
---
Then stop saying banned.  They're suspended.  It's an even lighter punishment for breaking their contracts.  Which they did.
---
Just (transmogrify?) Best friends forever and win every run nearly guaranteed after that

---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
ok
---
Ah fuck
---
*22 days ago from OP* ItS OvErTuNeD
---
Let‘s clarify some things you seem to not catch on to.
---
1. Blizzard being ok with crimes committed by China:
---
- Blizzard did not punish political views brought up in recent years. They did - themselves - promote political views, e.g. on the LGBT community. This is the first time Blizzard announces a political view should not be connected with Blizzard. If you do not think this has anything to do with Blizzard supporting China, why do you think this is the first time a political view has seen a ban attached to it?
---
- The (original) punishment, as in the ban from competitive play for 1 year, in addition to not granting the price money, was seen as too harsh by many in comparison to worse offenses, such as cheating. If you think this was not as a symbolic act to show support to China, why do you think the punishment was so big?
---
- Blizzard stated that it will protect the pride and dignity of China. Yeah.
---
Of course, Blizzard never said they think it is okay that China slaughters people. But did they show support to Hong Kong? No. Did they show support to China? Yes. More than enough people think so, it‘s not like I’m making shit up.
---
2. I’m not „twisting“ things to suit my agenda.
---
- You are the one twisting things. You twist „Blizzard never said they like organ harvesting!“ into Blizzard being not pro China. And again, you didn’t mention my original post mentioning how twisted it is that the crimes are okay for you, but when people talk bad about your Favorit game, then you take action. That are indeed twisted priorities.
---
 3. I‘m not a made-up Account.
---
- I posted in other subs before and have a history you can check.
---
- I‘m not on discord, never had it installed.
---
- I would like to see how you link me to any of the above in any way.
---
Or Hearthstone could just have a system more similar to MtG Arena's with a set time and timeouts if a change is really necessary, which it isn't.
---
Why does everyone recommending changes err on the side of unneeded complexity?
---
They're not saying the producer should be punished, they're saying that *if anyone* on the team should be punished, it should be the producer. The casters did what they could with what they were given, since the production clearly told them what was going to happen.
---
Lets go China
---
It is absolutely no different. The matter here is basic human rights, not nation of origin.
---
"Yes, I will call my manager. Please wait a moment."
---
You can probably find a lot of variations online but the key cards are to use Shadowstep and Togwaggles scheme to replay N'Zoth over and over again.
---
NetEase is the publisher of Blizzard's games in China -- they renewed [an 11 year publishing agreement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blizzard-entertainment-and-netease-extend-publishing-partnership-in-china-300776179.html) in January.
---
My understanding is NetEase does all of the operations for the games in China (hosts them, runs them, localises them, etc) and pays a royalty to Blizzard. It would be pretty strange if they did all that yet somehow Blizzard ran the Chinese social media accounts.
---
*than
---
Most of the streamers’ positions I saw were mostly upset about the severity of the punishment, which was walked back pretty substantially.  I know plenty of people still want blood but it’s crazy to think there’d be no punishment.
---
I mean to be fair people say that about every wow expansion. So I tend to view it as "worst expansion WoW has ever seen... thus far."
---
It's not over you can still spam in twitch chat and send each other your funny memes but not here.
---
&gt; climbed 
---
 不会英文就说中文嘛，惨不忍睹
---
Wait how
---
Lmao this is actually related to the subreddit, nobody is going to up vote it
---
You're totally right, it's not fair to underestimate Blizzard and their terrible writing and game decisions of the last 6 years.
---
Finished the run as warrior where I got the weapon saying "Deathrattle: summon all minions killed by this weapon" I killed the horseman 3/35 minion with the weapon and next run as warlock I got the weapon too and to my surprise it summoned the minions from previous run
---
I've been using him and Sylvanas in the old deathrattle deck with Mechanical Whelps, Oblivitron and Nine Lives. It's pretty fun.
---
He did do something wrong though, he was fully cognizant of that and willing to accept the punishment.  The initial outrage (see Kibler’s post, he really put it best) was over the excessive severity of the punishment, not the existence of a punishment.  That was walked back to something much more reasonable and he accepted it for the most part.
---
*laughs at the edit
---
I have yet to craft the quest, am looking for answers as well
---
I'll continue to play the game, but if you think I'm an "annoying smart person." because I don't agree with your agenda, then I guess you're too far out.
---
There are plenty of better ways to support the HK movement, like donating to their fundraisers, or by creating awareness for the cause, instead of targeting specific companies.
---
Either way, the casters should've been trying to avoid controversial topics while representing a company right? Why didn't they just try and do a normal interview and ignore what he was wearing? Why did they say "just get it over with" instead of  "this is not the time to bring up controversial topics"
---
wait a minute. you are comparing siding with human rights over some luxury demand to play videogames. the fucking company is selling human rights for 1.30 a cardpack and you sit here talking about chinese players being hurt.
---
oh good, StackExchange is here to complain about content, topic, and petty displacement.  The very definition of holding one finger up and saying “well actually...”.  I always read those comments in famous comic book nerd voice from the simpsons.  Appreciate your input Gamefighter3000, take it back to stack, nobody here is impressed.
---
I tried saying this before and was deemed a China supporter. Typical.
---
Good. I hate resurrect priest. So spammy
---
the point is, just because china is willing to  oppress their own citizens does not mean they are willing to do it to people of another nation, because they fear international scandal and retaliation.  basic human rights is not in the discussion here, only international politics.
---
Hong Kong protest news or Boycott Blizzard news? For the former wouldn't /r/Hong_Kong  be better? And for the later... isn't participation just bringing the focus back on to blizzard instead of just dropping them?
---
The first and most important point to make is that it shouldn’t matter whether the requests for censorship come from China, Sweden, the US, or anywhere. It is clear that things like sexually-suggestive imagery/words, violence/blood, and skulls/bones are being gradually toned down and removed. They are being removed because someone is requesting they be censored and that blizzard is giving into that suggests they’ll be perfectly happy to censor for other entities as well. If your not a fan of censorship, the source hardly matters. If you give them a stamp of approval here, they will use it again. 
---
Eventually they’ll do something you don’t like and by that point it will be too late. This goes for all the people laughing about how people are only made because they can’t jerk it to succubus anymore, as if anyone was doing that. I like the new artwork better there, truth be told, but I also hate censorship and hate why it is different. Because I know what it means. 
---
Second, I’m going to bet Blizzard lies from time to time about what and why it does what does in their official communications. Why? Because lies sometimes make money by making unpalatable decisions easy to swallow. “We changed art to appease Chinese government censors” doesn’t feel as nice as, “we wanted to bring the art up to our standards and make everyone feel good about it”. 
---
I mean no one felt bad about that art before and we know from other blizzard communications they didn’t want to change the art on cards because it would confuse players even if it fit better. Or maybe that part was the lie?
---
Third, we know - as you pointed out - that blizzard already does this for China. There are some artworks that are different there to cover up bones. I see no reason to not suspect, then, that other changes like these will be made for China. Such as the removal of skulls from guldans necklace. I can think of no other reason they’d do that. 
---
Why globally instead of just in China? Hell if I know. Tournaments? Twitch streams? But just because that answer isn’t readily apparent or obvious doesn’t mean I won’t be skeptical as hell of lines like “our relationship with China has no impact on our decisions”
---
might as well use this subreddit for what it's meant for right
---
Blizzard = bad
---
I'm sorry but you are actually completely wrong. They are the ones that encouraged him to say it. Go back and watch the video with translations. They explicitly tell him, "Say the eight words." Which is a direct reference to what Blitz said.
---
Part of the reason why I've cut sylvannas from my rez priest
---
Best friends forever stay in your deck forever. Up to 20 carry over to future runs. So 1 mana 20/20 charge taunt guaranteed on turn 1 kills all bosses by turn 2
---
Who's spamming troll posts on stuff the mods have explicitly allowed?
---
Not me. You. Check yourself homeslice. 
---
Have a nice day, go outside and cool down and stop being angry that other people are defending human rights that you have argued yourself into fighting against. You have work to do repairing your reputation with the community if you want to be a part of it here.
---
If you truly did not want to talk about it, you would be gone already. Stop being dishonest with yourself and everyone else, it's not fooling anyone. Nobody buys it.
---
Why not include your list in the post?
---
Just like to say that I started playing Gwent and I'm really enjoying the game. Thank you for your suggestions.
---
you want Blizzard to Strawman someone?  
---
lol
---
Ball of Spiders - 9 mana priest version

\&gt; still calling me angry  
---
LMAO
---
There is no difference, when fb was new and hyped I looked into it and if I recall correctly, what you do is their property not yours, so they deleted the access you got to their data, but it's a private company for which you accepted the TOS, so your data still exist, the question would be, will they restore it once you requested a full deletion?
---
I think they won't but you can try 
---
If that doesn't work, hs support but I won't get my hopes high if I were you. 
---
Hope it helped
---
Censoring free speech and silently supporting a government that censors free speech and violated basic human rights.
---
It's OK, they'll probably fix the 1000-win hero bug quickly, don't worry. Good to see you're planning to spend money and not continue to be f2p though.
---
Yeah with Nzoth in standard, I'd say it's pretty good.
---
In the US it’s mostly used by people after they get criticized for saying something racist.
---
Just gunna say this ain’t the best time to come back
---
Nice video ben, cool to to see you're making content. How do you cycle if you want to keep your burn spells? As I'm playing deathrattle rogue, I want to know what pressure I can put on this greedy shaman list.
---
This is a strawman argument. They weren't banned for "daring to support human rights" they were banned for violating their contract.   
---
Sorry but you don't get to sign something agreeing to censor yourself because money, then decide not to censor yourself and then still expect money.
---
\&gt; in support of China and the casters gave him the okay to say it, would you think the same thing would have happened? 
---
Yes.
---
Shudderwock while Best Friends are on the board will absorb the friends and they no longer last forever. :(
---
....... (*whistles*) [Puts deck back into box]
---
ey, i'd take flat boobies over no boobies all day
---
nice
---
I'm aware of all the drama with Hong Kong and whatnot but I'm just here to play the card game I love. Any deck recommendation?
---
&gt;People should be paid what they’re worth and not be exploited for doing what they love.
---
A person is always worth what they perceive themselves to be worth.
---
If a person thinks he or she is only worth minimum wage, then that's on said person. If that person hands in their application for a job paying less than the median average for his or her profession, but still above legal minimum wage, then that's \*also\* on said person.
---
after turn 4 shaman can swing the board in their favour quite easily. So if you lose board before then, it is hard to beat shaman at least with the tempo rogue that I made.
---
I mean, accepting LGBTQ+ people as people isn’t exactly a divisive stance if your not a fucking idiot
---
Similarly, nor should human rights be
---
But i really like hearthstone, but also believe in the Hong Kong revolution
---
But i also like to think blizzards actions were at least somewhat justified, they acted directly within the rules
---
But also the statement blitzchung made is significantly more important that the rules
---
But blizzard also back-pedalled on the punishment, despite the rules that blitz broke not requiring blizz to do so
---
But it probably was just to try and calm the outcry and controversy
---
This is so fucking conflicting
---
I really dont like the new secret keeper either.
---
Still gets silenced by Iron Beak Owl and Spell Breaker
---
Literally unplayable
---
Yes, both of our statements are true.
---
"Artistic vision" is a generous description of a small amount of art in the game. When you see talks by the devs they aren't talking about how proud they are of the succubus art. They talk about the gameplay. The devs themselves made this change! Maybe their artistic vision is "no distracting fanservice" and now they are closer to that vision.
---
I meant fix things with Hong-Kong...
---
I think if you do not have access to Elise or King Phaoris you want to focus on draw so you can get to your win condition faster (Chef Nomi or Maly) faster. So I would try Jepetto Joybuzz (who was in a few Grandmaster decks) and Bloodmage Thanos.
---
 Not really the best player to ask (I’m still kinda a noob) but there’s a warrior deck that’s dominating right now you could look up
---
What?
---
Both. It's both. But for me, it's more about China than it is about Blizzard specifically.
---
I finally got off my ass and read about what's going on over there (camps, organ harvesting, etc).
---
I know I can't do much, but I can absolutely spend 10 cents more to buy something not "Made in China". Not gonna pretend like I can avoid it all, but something is better than nothing. And products that are "entertainment" - that's even easier to sort out. I don't need an alternative to those.
---
I doubt the succubus change was due to china, I assumed it had more to do to appeal the SJW and feminists
---
I have been thinking of buying the welcome bundle, but this incided set any chance of that happening. I guess I will be f2p casual forever.
---
I'll check it out mate 👍
---
Companies take political stances because it is profitable.
---
I mean, I would have just netdeck something. Currently the mostly used I find (top 700 legend EU) is the one with Kun, Banker and Elise.
---
You can put Thaurissian followed by Floop to have Banker at 0 , or keep Floop to play more Kuns late game 
---
If the problem is the budget you can work something but the fact is that it’s actually very dust heavy: it plays Loti, Floop, Quest, Zephrys, Elise and you could add much more like Nomi, Phaoris, Cenarius or go for the malygos build. 
---
Its a heavy budget deck, there are much more lighter decks very strong in the meta atm if you want to go for ladder
---
It was literally in their contract that if you do something controversial on stream you'll lose your winnings and be banned for "X" amount of time. How the hell is that disproportionately harsh? They literally signed an agreement saying it would happen...
---
Agreed. It was on a Chinese language stream even, if I understand correctly. It’s a political message very sensitive to the audience. I think it’s appropriate for Blizzard to ensure these streams do not get political. ”Impeach Trump” would likely get shut down on an American stream, I suppose, for the same reason.
---
I don't want fb back. It's literally the worst. I'll try the support route tomorrow. There's such a thing as a permanent deletion; https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674
---
r/CompetitiveHS
---
I have no idea why this is supposed to be important , even if it was done specifically for China (which I highly doubt). I didnt like that they censored Succubus but censoring sexual content and censoring political content is very different.
---
they are busy getting approval from china before they release them worldwide
---
He's just restating what other people have already said.
---
That's just like, your opinion, man.
---
People would be upset but not to the extent of flooding Reddit with memes. On top of that, there would be no demand of rolling back the punishment. If they did, that's when the meme outrage would start.
---
Nnnooo I bet it was communist China that made Jania cover up. Let's spam the hearthstone sub reddit. #Free Jania's boobs
---
What you are asking is to appeal to the lower common denominator, it's lowering our values in order to appease to some hypothetic offended group.
---
What you are doing IS LITERALLY what blizzard is doing with Hong Kong right now.
---
Also, I know you know, but I'll say it anyway : The only people who have problem with stuff like cleavage right now are either dictatorship (like CCP, the common chinese man is more than fine with cleavage) or countries under backward and oppressive religions... and the neo-puritain lefties that are activelly working to undermine what the second wave feminists have built.
---
You have clearly no fucking idea of how the rest of the world works it seems and you probably should try to unplug from your heavy PC social media and realize how twisted and frankly evil your word view as become.
---
You are LITERALLY defending fascistic censorship and oppression of women and you still try to pretend you have some sort of morale highground.
---
And please, I'm not "the donald guy", I'm my own man and unlike you I'm not so full of prejudices that I label people like you just did. What the fuck do you even think "the donald guy" even mean?
---
Murloc shaman is cheap and very good. If your low on dust I would give that a look.
---
There was a vocal contingent claiming to be genuinely upset about the art changes.
---
Obvious troll is obvious. Doesn't even deserve a token downvote.
---
\&gt; even Blizzard has struggled lately.
---
lmao by what metric, they rake in higher profits basically ever quarter.
---
I'm my own man too, I'm just much more slick and relaxed in how I express myself : p
---
What-aboutism does nobody any good
---
So, a lot of times Reddit users know the basic level of informations.  This is the general fact list.  
---
* Hong Kong is protesting for human rights, against China.
---
* A Hearthstone player spoke in favor of the Hong Kong revolution.  
---
* Blizzard then banned that player and both casters.  
---
That first point is far deeper though.  Some users might look up the protests, but even then, they might skim.  So they'll understand human rights, and freedom from China, but may not know exactly what rights are being infringed upon.  So they perhaps aren't aware of the free speech being threatened as China would gladly extradite people of the media who speak out against their country the way they do within their own political borders already.
---
But hey.  It's easy to be for freedom, easy to dislike corporations, and easy to see that the two are linked by reading reddit.
---
I mean sure I liked the tits but it never actually mattered to me. When the changes went live I disn't really notice them at all tbh.
---
Less /r/conspiracy and more /r/KotakuInAction
---
nope, still waiting(((
---
This case is not related to OGN, this happened after Blizzard abolished the OGN-hosted Korean competition.  Rather, he was properly paid by OGN
---
Its both and it is neither. 
---
I would be just as upset if they took the same actions towards someone with anti-HK statements. I would agree with them and be less upset than now, but if they banned the player, fired the casters and took away the prize money that would be completely wrong. 
---
Remember blizzard has not taken the same stance or tactics in the past when it came to political statements. [Blizzard has even made official LGBTQ+ pride merch](https://www.wowhead.com/news=292034/new-blizzard-shop-merch-blizzard-pride-pin-and-summer-apparel) which is and of itself a political statement. 
---
So not only is it a hypocritical action, the punishment is so far beyond harsh for what was done is apprehensible. Even the "light" sentence it was reduced to (6 month ban for the player and 6 month unpaid suspension for the casters) is still far too harsh for what blizzard themselves has done more on for different issues. 
---
Add in Blizzards partner company who they I operate through making a even more politically loaded statement saying that blitzchung was wrong and it was disrespectful towards China within a couple hours is just adding more fuel to the fire. Then taking 4 whole days to make an English language statement which didn't clarify anything only made it worse in my eyes. Not only did it take them most of a week to make a statement which took their other half hours to make, it contradicted the two statements. 
---
Add in the actions blizzard has taken in the past (art changes mostly) because of their ties with china, and now their sudden and extremely about-face on their stance on political statements all feels wrong to me
---
You might as well complain that *expansions* are just a ploy to get more money too. This is a fun event that doesn't actually require you to make any significant investment to enjoy. Stop whining.

Battlecry, silence your board and reveal the opponent hand
---
It's pretty simple, USA and China have two very different morals, it actually stems from philosophy.
---
USA is built on Classical Liberalism aka John Locke type philosophy and is bent almost completely on individualism.
---
China is ancient built on a lot of Confucianism and now Communism, both are very collectivist philosophies that have developed from thousands of years of HORRIBLE civil wars.
---
They are obviously very different and value different things for different reasons, but both see them as 100% mandatory to their lives. 
---
I personally feel that the two are incompatible and that companies trying to chose both are facing an impossibility.  It appears they are trying to "tow the line" and are counting on the individualism of The West to "be ok with" what is going on.
---
It's going to be interesting to watch, I think that Blizzard will continue to lose business as they court China, until a new company comes to take Blizzards spot in The West.
---
But time will tell!
---
Here was my sub-8 min [time](https://ibb.co/Zd5LsZd). 20 BFF, and gotta spam click all animations (and pick loot fast, pref. empty buckets or Mirror, Mirror). I made some small mistakes that could have shaved a couple seconds, so I'm thinking the absolute limit of time that is **consistent** is around 7:25-7:30. You can even get faster if you get lucky with getting Mirror in your opening hand, which could potentially drop you closer to 7 minutes flat. Afaik the current world record is at 7:12, using that same Mirror strat. :)
---
I am uncomfortable relying on corporations to be our moral vanguard in any context, period.
---
I sense that people only want corporations to take the moral lead on issues when those corporations agree with them. I recognize corporations as probably the worst vehicle you could choose for something like that, and I stick by that even when corps agree with me.
---
Are you sure? I thought we will keep them through the next explanation as well?
---
Because it's a systematic evil that companies are allowed to be neutral on political and human rights issues in the quest for "profits". Ergo, to right this wrong, we are right to shit on companies that DON'T take stances. Profits are not an end-all response to any criticism; fuck your company and fuck your profits. I understand why they would want to stay neutral, but I will condemn them even given this understanding. If your company chases profits above ethics, then it is fundamentally immoral. I feel no guilt in trashing immoral companies, even if they are the majority.
---
I make a suggestion to reduce the “dead time” in the game and it must be because my peanut brain can’t handle the thousands of decisions GMs are making when figuring out what maximizes their odds of winning. 
---
I understand GM matches are consequential - there is money on the line - but that doesn’t mean they need to wait 50 seconds before passing Turn 1. They do need to bluff whether they have “that card” or not, which could easily be done in 30 seconds if the turn was half as long...
---
The reason for “earning” time as cards are played is to not break combo/APM turns, which inherently have more actions, interactions and animations, leading to a turn that warrants additional time than what you need to decide whether to play your 1-drop or pass on Turn 1.
---
&gt;as of this morning NBA basketball is back on chinese TV
---
Just wanna correct something here. It's not back on TV, but Tencent has resumed streaming the games. I guess the Chinese side is unwilling to forego the millions of ad and subscription revenue too. When economic activity breaks down, it hurts both sides.
---
Top comment is claiming logic and reason but you have to scroll down to this post to find actual logic and reason.
---
The dog is pretty silly. 
---
Speed runs are essentially how fast can you click, and have nothing to do with gaming.
---
When your deck is all 1 mana 60/60 Charge minions that you are guaranteed to draw turn 1, that is hardly a dungeon run.
---
I'm actually with kiblers point of view on this, it's fine to reprimand Blitzchung, or this hypothetical person in your scenerio, but the punishment given was excessive and indicative of much broader going ons.
---
Which is why I've quit hearthstone.
---
AppleFlesh#2321 NA Trading 80g gold quest, i prefer you go first.

by that logic he must also be an "ex-communist" for recognising this game is hearthstone

Damn shame that isn't the case, huh bucko?

Dude. Gamers not wanting to talk about politics all the time doesn't mean they're supporting China and against human rights and free speech. When will you guys stop blowing up our inboxes with this garbage?

Hundreds of people have seen this post. I knew it was going to be downvoted, my plan was just to get this in front of eyes.

It has been six days from the last update. There is still no hot-fix or patch.

This. I fully agree with what you are saying. If people want REAL change they need to help the people of HK more and remember China is the real enemy. Thank you for understanding my pov and giving yours kindly :)

I know that electra makes things easier but is she essential to the deck? I hate crafting legendaries that will rotate out soon.

&gt; The idea that everything is political is postmodern nonsense. It's literally rooted in the Foucaultian belief that there is no objective truth, which is explicitly anti-science, by the way. 
---
Wow, so many wrong things in so few words.
---
The idea that everything is political was popularized in the US by the second-wave feminist movement, which was decidedly modernist, not post-modern.
---
"There is no objective truth" was the belief of the classical Greek Sophists and countless people throughout all of recorded history, among every political party and every belief system, not a new or "Foucaultian" thing. In fact, Foucault's beliefs about truth most nearly come from Nietzsche.
---
Foucault has been pretty passe in the academy for at least 30 years.
---
Most second-wave feminists (the folks who claims everything is political) - and many feminists in general - strongly opposed Foucault.
---
Foucault was primarily a historian. When he questioned objective truth, he wasn't dismissing objective reality or facts, but making a statement sort-of like that "history is always written by the victors." I suspect you'd agree with that sentiment.
---
Nothing about that is anti-science. If you talk to actual research scientists, they'll tell you that our theories and laws work as heuristics. They're models that are highly accurate and predictive. But even Newton's laws of motion have been proven to be dependent on the context of our everyday level of experience.
---
Other commenters have demonstrated why the body of your post is wrong; I'm just hoping you'll accept that (regardless of your beliefs about undergraduate identity-study courses) this particular idea is wrong.
---
I'm not sure how that invalidates the counterpoint, actually. At least some of the protest is about getting Blizzard to make a clear repudiation of Chinese political influence. To that end, Blizzard's silence on the matter and the implication of consent via that silence is, in fact, cogent. I agree that it's important to recognize that Blizzard and Netease are partners and not the same company, but the fact that Netease acts as a representative of Blizzard when it comes to their game's presence in China is, I think, relevant and, as such, Blizzard's reluctance to repudiate the statement or to affirm that it does *not* represent Blizzard's official position is a perfect valid point of protest, your arguments notwithstanding.
---
Doom in the Tomb had also just happened and some folks probably wanted to talk about that. Nothe sure. I don't sort by New
---
That way people who are not very good at it can feel better about themselves
---
 ad hominem: (of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.
---
no you are still exactly saying "hey its not as bad as NORTH KOREA!" 
---
North Korea isnt relevant to this conversation. 
---
Hong Kong DOES have militant police on every corner. their leader gets offended at fucking WINNIE THE POOH MEMES, and bans them. what a fucking crybaby loser this guy is. 
---
now that we look at it, it really ISNT that different than North Korea.
---
Exactly. People who say that boycotts don't work are also missing that point. A boycott against littering isn't going to stop littering, but that doesn't mean I have to feel ok about throwing garbage out the window.
---
I think we're in agreement here.  That's kind of exactly what  I meant.  My wife is my other half, so yeah, if she insults someone, I may as well have done it.  That may sound unfair, but it isn't... and it has it's perks as well. =)
---
I think that if it wasn't for the events in the NBA and Rockets organization (Rockets general manager tweeting support for HK and getting Rockets merchandise/broadcasts immediately blacklisted in China) I think Blizzard might have just not done anything and it's entirely possible China wouldn't have even noticed.
---
But once Blizzard saw that Chinese government is so quick to act and cut ties with any organization if it doesn't pander to them, Blizzard entered panic mode and, without being fully sure what sort of punishment would appease China, had a knee-jerk reaction and went all the way with their initial punishment to minimize the chance China would "pull the plug".
---
It's pretty likely that after the shitstorm Blizzard later contacted Chinese side (and I'm not talking about the conspiracy theory that Blizzard's response was written by China directly) and told them "look, we are having some troubles with our PR here, can we make some sort of deal?" and found a compromise that still satisfies Chinese side while giving western side SOME sort of plausible scenario where the punishment was truly not related to the fear of losing Chinese market (which is obviously BS, but at least some people will be satisfied with that).
---
Unpopular take, I guess.  I would argue the streamers are more at fault than the player.  They are 100% responsible for what goes on their stream.  And like you said, they dove behind their tables.  They knew exactly what was going to happen.  They could have just said no.
---
Honestly now I'm just disappointed it wasn't from the same game.
---
Pretty sure the dude you accused of supporting a totalitarian regime/narrative also felt kinda offended but that didn't stop you, did it?
---
Nope, TESPA has it own set of rules, but players are still subject to the tournament handbook, which Blizzchung violated. 
---
So Blizzard could choose to punish them. 
---
It is absolutely madness to enforce a rule on Blizzchung, and not on the AU players, when they did pretty much the same thing, i.e stating free Hong Kong, and in UAs case also Boycot Blizzard.
---
So surely, if Blizzard felt the need to punish Blizzchung but not UA players, for the same violation, we as players have a problem. Setting a precedent with Blizzchung and not following it just a couple of days later, makes it A) really fucking hard for all pro players not knowing where the line is drawn. And B) Shows the consumers (casual players, viewers on stream etc) that Blizzard does what ever the fuck they want in order to maximise their yuan gains while sucking Xi’s dick as much as possible.
---
Right there with you. The fact that they waited this long before responding and their official fully considered response was "sorry not sorry", there's little they can do to fix the problem.
---
It's really disappointing. I've been a devout blizzard fan since Warcraft 1. I've bought every iteration of Warcraft/StarCraft/Diablo (less a bunch of WoW expansions) and turned a bunch of friends to the company over the years. Hell, I even got my non gamer GF addicted to hearthstone.
---
But that's over. I can't in good conscience support a company - once known for its devotion to their product and customers - that will throw it's own community under the bus to protect the fragile ego of a government actively brutalizing their own people.
---
Fuck you Blizzard/Activision, you ruined a wonderful company that made amazing things.
---
You're referring of course to Apple's recent Chinese controversy, and by controversy I mean naked appeasement of Beijing.
---
The last phone I bought (two years ago) was an iPhone (the phone I still have); I will not buy another, nor buy anything from Apple, until they likewise issue a statement against the brutality of the Chinese government. 
---
But what I would like to know is: what point are you trying to make? Are you saying you support the CCP because people can be morally inconsistent?
---
Why are you exaggerating? I call BS.
---
Don’t bother.  This is an issue that people are *wayyyy* too emotionally invested in, compared to all of the bigger human rights violations happening right now throughout the world (i.e. actual civilians getting killed by drone strikes, anyone?).  You’re either with them or you get demonized.
---
Make it your favorite and make a new deck.  Should stick until they fix the bug from what I've read
---
You should also realize that the internet is like an infinite well of people, and while you saw a lot of deletion posts, once those people leave the community you will be left with nothing but people who didn't delete, so it will appear like nothing really happened regardless.
---
The only way to tell for sure would be to track like posts per hour or something and see if that number goes down in the next couple weeks, or maybe if Blizzard were to ever share real time active users data... but they won't do that so who knows.
---
So in 2024?
---
I feel Blizzard is choosing profit over doing the morally right thing. Sure they would lose 1/3 (not sure the exact %) of their profits if China ceases to do business with them. But human rights are priceless. Freedom of speech is something to fight for. Freedom from oppression and harm is something to fight for.
---
5head
---
I also had a problem with his first point. On one side, there are so many scenarios and ways to break the rules that it's nearly impossible to not overbloat a contract. Drafters often partially circumvent this by listing the worst penalty possible. You see this stuff all the time -
---
Example: *Breaking the aforementioned rules is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $100,000 fine*.
---
Blizzard should have had an umbrella of this sort to give players an idea of what could happen if they break the rules and justify their decisions to the public.
---
Issueing a "Warning" is not harsh enough, it leaves the idea open for other people to capitalize on the leniency.

It basically says "Everyone gets 1 soapbox moment." to all pro players, because if they just warn Blitzchung, then they can't exactly be a soft-touch with later pro players doing the exact same thing, because then everyone would argue a double standard, that it was unfair or that there was no precedence for this.  By doling out a hard-line punishment you ensure nobody else thinks "Well I'll just take the slap on the wrist, they won't do anything for this first offense..."  
---
That said, the punishment in this instance was too severe, but a punish absolutely was warranted.

I usually don't run into those issues with my build indeed because of the flexibility. I can heal outside of any range rogue has and can burst down warriors with 70+dmg. The only reason why it would be considered lower tier is because it's a hard to learn and pilot deck. This will always lower the average winrate on sites like hsreplay (just like pogo rogue etc) since a lot of less-experienced players won't perform optimally. Tempo decks just need you to play minions on curve and go face, which is why the avg winrate goes up.

Virtue Signaling is the lowest form of activism. You are absolutely braindead if you think *not* playing a game does jack shit to support Human Rights. How delusional are you?

Man, way to get upset over a little term just because once in a blue moon it turns out to be right.

Just because you can't disprove there aren't pink elephants doing the Macarena on Pluto, doesn't mean you can't call it BS.

Why are blizzard legally not allowed to operate in china?
---
Congrats! I'm still working on my second one as well .
---
_checks date_ ... yup, right on cue
---
I guess we will see when COD: MW drops in less than two weeks. I hope I'll be back here admitting I was being cynical.
---
We should be talking about the china stuff, its a big deal. we really shouldn't be playing hearthstone anymore
---
Who cares? Ted Nugent could say the same things and it wouldn't make him worthy of being highlighted either. Highlight takes from people who aren't shitheels.
---
Sorry, who are you again? You're speaking for quite a lot of people.

The description of the card is extremely misleading. that's the part that annoys me the most
---
...you don't know what a straw man is, do you...? Or that what you set up could, indeed, be an example of one?
---
C'mon, man. If you're gonna troll, troll better. At least don't stoop to, "I know you are, but what am I?"
---
My point is that a boycott isn't only about stopping something, it's also about not actively contributing to the problem. That was the most straightforward example I could think of. If you think I was comparing the impact of littering to China then you don't understand analogies and you're a fucking moron.
---
If you like to build them that way I can reccomend going to a deck builder web page, that's what I do.
---
Had no intent to censor you. Was just making a friendly suggestion. :)
---
For someone with "writing" in his username, your prose sure is dull and uninspired. And therefore, uninspiring. Bland, boring, basic. Bad. Maybe take a writing course and try again?
---
Thank you
---
1% is nothing. The Diablo debacle last year dropped the stock by fucking 25%. That is a drop. Everything below 5% is nothing to even acknowledge.
---
People just need to hate something
---
yeah this is more what I mean. I realize it's a character, I just don't really like the character. didn't feel like I needed to differentiate considering we were talking about the video in which he is playing the character
---
Blizzard did not censor free speech. They are a private company with clearly stated rules for what can and cannot be said on their stream. Free speech doesn't apply. 
---
The anger came, at least for me, from the overpunishment and then doubling and later tripling down on supporting China. The return of the prize money has cooled me to the point where I'm now left to consider how much I expect from a multinational corporation. I'm leaning towards more, but it requires more thought.
---

There was a market dip, but no other company dropped by 25% and most company who's stock dipped, recovered within a few weeks.
---
Blizzard still has not recovered from the Blizzcon dip.
---
So yeah, some of it was because of Diablo Immortal.
---
People still play this shit? I got 20 of my friends to delete this game and we haven’t looked back.
---
FREE HONG KONG. Fuck Blizzard.
---
&gt;Have you seen what these companies put into their games?
---
Nothing in these games is any different from pokemon cards which have existed for decades. And which I love. 
---
They're only a problem when they replace a progression system in a game. 
---
&gt;It's literally gambling
---
Who gives a fuck. So is opening a business. Everything you do is gambling. And anti-gambling laws have never worked before...soooo. 
---
Also it's not even technically gambling. There's no payout...Like is opening packs of cards gambling? 
---
People laugh at the "surprise mechanic thing" But it's legit. Sometimes adding unexpected results to a product isn't strictly a bad thing...It's all useless digital goods anyways.
---
I hate to say it but no you haven’t, not at all. Lol. This is a completely routine fluctuation.

Probably not native English.
---
I was thinking about it... you thin it’s better than Archevist?
---
&gt; Who's the sheep there? Me, for still playing Hearthstone, or you because you boycott Blizz for this but won't boycott companies that do things like actual slavery?
---
I play HS, I'm just not a puppet who thinks "ooo new shiny cards, must give lots of money" like many.  
---
As to "actual slavery" by all means outst those companies and lets see if I indeed do support them rather than making insinuations.

In this case many are aware of what blizzard has done and it's hurt their image imo.  Others think "that's cool, fair enough" and no harm done at all.  
---
It's on the individual to make a decision on if they feel the blizzard issue is something they feel strongly enough to not spend money on Blizzard anymore or not.
---
A very well thought out post. Thanks for giving your knowledgeable perspective. I was completely unaware of the Opium Wars and 1967 riots until now.
---
I dont play wild, but in standard I sure would.

That should be a fallacy for the reason you gave and if by some chance people were going to make a decision based on the stream then it's not going to be overly positive.

So how did this analyst get access to Blizzard's internal sales figures? Well, let's be upfront about this: he didn't. This "analysis" is inference, and it's the same inference that we're all making: we *expect* sales to be impacted because some fraction of the public will stop buying Blizzard products as a form of protest.
---
What no one outside of Blizzard knows, however, is to what actual extent this is happening. Again, we can make inferences, but we need to be cautious about how much inference we're engaging in. One of the reasons that so many protest movements far prey to conspiratorial thinking is precisely because people follow a chain of inferences which lead them to irrational conclusions. 
---
I would, personally, like for this protest to mean something and for it to have a real impact on how Blizzard operates; but I also want to make sure that we're sticking as closely to the facts of the situation as we can. Rumors and speculations should not dominate the conversation.
---
Imagine being a lowlife piece of shit who thinks it's acceptable to make fun of persons with disabilities.
---
I’m going to fundamentally disagree with you on the “well it’s not their fault if the guy can’t control himself” thing.
---
It is a fact that predatory systems such as loot boxes prey on people with gambling addictions.  Real people are losing real money from this, money they sometimes need for essentials.  To a certain segment of the population, gambling is a compulsion (that’s why it’s called gambling addiction) and the prevalence of gambling-like systems in quite a lot of major games can make abstinence unreasonably difficult.
---
But I guess all of that can be overlooked if one wants to believe axiomatically in the free market.
---
I actually am yes. I'm boycotting Apple and Disney for a start. I'm not in the US so I can't speak for all the corporations there but I'm technically boycotting them too. I'm actually from Hong Kong, I grew up there, and am in Australia now, a country with representative democracy.
---
What you're doing here is resorting to a bunch of fallacies to discredit my opinion. Just because someone isn't in a position to boycott a company it doesn't mean they don't care, they are individually not able to make a change with their wallets, that is what the global economy has created, that said, they can still voice their opinions and contact their political representatives, and those that can boycott absolutely should. In that same way, you can definitely stand with and support HK whether or not you are physically there to protest, or are able to donate to their causes.
---
A huge goal of the HK protests is to spread international awareness. Just hearing about them and forming your own opinion is enough. My counter question to you is; why are you so critical of those boycots? Why is the possible thought of someone being a hypocrite such a motivating factor for you?
---
Anything political has a stance, and someone will always oppose a stance. Talking about Hearthstone as you were expected? No stance.
---
I really don't want to get into a 10 paragraph long reply chain on this so let me reply with some succinct points.
---
* You can't claim "heavy handedness" when the consequences of their actions were clearly outlined *before* the event occurred. They might be harsh, but it was not unexpected, and whether or not it was pro-human rights is 110% irrelevant.
---
* TESPA ran the collegiate tournament, not Blizzard, and they had [clearly different rules](https://dm.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dhhc89/is_everyone_really_ok_with_the_casters_getting_a/f3oiy7a/). Again, not the same situation, so you cannot and should not directly compare the two, even if the actions themselves were similar in nature.
---
* What happens in Taiwan is huge on China's radar, as they've had a pretty continuous relationship for the last several decades. It should be painfully obvious how the statement made can be considered incendiary in that part of the world, again regardless if we agree with it or not.
---
* You're conflating with what I said about legalities in some countries (Russia) with the Hearthstone situation, which is inaccurate, and Blitzchung wasn't punished because what he said was illegal in China in the first place either.
---
&gt; So then you would also feel that a rule that essentially say "We may take any action against any statement" is a bit of a fussy rule.
---
No I would not, because virtually every institution with any kind of robust rules and regulations have some kind of general/catch-all rule specifically written in order to cover situations which are not explicitly stated otherwise. In simple terms, these are setup in order to avoid loopholes, but they're also generally understood to deter participants from doing anything that will cause issues for the greater company/team/business/institution/etc.

---
The theoretical vaugities of the rule don't matter because it *wasn't* applied to something innocuous like wearing the wrong shirt or saying "I'd like to thank my mom and dad...". It exists to deter players from causing trouble for the company and in this case its application was absolutely and completely justified - he made a decision which he *knew* would be contentious and he should be held accountable, and the casters were complicate in encouraging it, regardless if some production staff also dropped the ball - nobody is innocent here. I also cannot stress enough that this is completely dissociated from the message itself.
---
That's not nuance, that's you ignoring any valid points made by the person simply because you don't like them. THAT is intellectually lazy and you know it.
---
I'm completely done with Blizzard. I found Paladins and Eternal. Problem solved.
---
1,5% is nothing, dude. You have actually just proved the opposite.
---
Imagine being such a salty SJW clown LOL.
---
You know that Ben Brode's new company was funded by NetEase, right?
---
Apologies. I meant to say revenue rather than profits. I wrote that hastily. 
---
I don't agree with it being "rolled into salaries" as the same thing. With that said, I haven't seen hard numbers about how much people have earned, how much salaries were increased, etc. It's possible it's equal. It's possible it's not. I do know the people I know who work at Blizzard were down about it when it happened.
---
It's a game studio. They are going to have a rush of profits around new releases and they're going to make less in between releases.
---
Hopefully this post doesn't come across as against you. Thank you for clearing a few things up.  I'm dodging amazon because bonus vs slight pay bump is splitting hairs; they're abusing low-skill workers either way like most other large corporations.
---
17% reduction  wipes out Profit on most business models

I've been called a whale. I've decided that I won't be paying for the next expansion. I think that six months of abstaining for purchasing Blizzard products is perfectly proportional to the punishment that they ended up meting out.
---

---
I respect that you are going through actually boycotting multiple companies and are legitimately trying to fight for a good cause. However what is the fallacy here? The fact I said " I hope you are ready to boycott a shitload more companies if simply operating in said country now means you support them". Well its true. There are many companies there because China simply has many resources and all that you cant find elsewhere. Almost everything you use is from China in some capacity and would require alot more then the companies mentioned backing out for anything to ever change.
---
Not even that.  Publishers just give advance review copies to openly chummy streamers to stream, and deny advance access to critical steamers.  Boom, done.  We had access media, now we have access influencers.
---
Yeah are servers super unstable? My collection is one big mess
---
&gt;It is a fact that predatory systems such as loot boxes prey on people with gambling addictions.
---
So? People with addictions should be used to making sacrifices to lower temptations. 
---
If your favorite restaurant sells alcohol and that tempts you too much, stop going. You think I care that this guy can't play the latest madden garbage? That's a reason to regulate all of gaming?

Yea. Whales, streamers, addicts, and children who steal their parents credit card. Nobody I give a fuck about. 
---
&gt;and the prevalence of gambling-like systems in quite a lot of major games can make abstinence unreasonably difficult.
---
Why does this guy even have a credit card that he can put into games? This guy just sounds like an idiot. If this was me in the same situation I would have found a way to play my favorite game without any worries. Really sounds easy af.
---
The problem here Blizzard don't make that much releases. So it make sense to cut bonus program but rather increased the base salary. They might hire less people and lay off some worker but ultimately it is better in long run.
---
"Yes"
---
I just did the same thing but I have first aid kit and the weapon of finley so... I think I am fine. Still. Having armor carry over wouldn't be much to ask for I feel. It makes more sense in the run's fairness.
---
Objectivity implies that someone has access to their realtime sales figures. This isn't objective; it's inference. Mind you, it's a reasonable inference, all things considered, but it's far from being factually established at this point. We'll need to wait for the next relevant quarterly report to really see what kind of impact we've had.
---
You see that's the thing, it's not on me to teach others how will they run their country, and that's exactly the reason why 80% of the world hates the USA, because of their "exporting democracy" politics.

I would rather stand by my corrupted government than to allow foreign-backed forces to take power in my country.

Thank you for telling us what is happening in Hong Kong. This is why I made the artwork. Blitzchung raised awareness. Companies like Blizzard are choosing their profits in China over doing the right thing. When their customer (The government of China) uses censorship, oppression, and violence to get its way, that is a big problem and it is affecting all nations of the world. Is the U.S. really "free" if our corporations are perpetuating the problem? And we as consumers are also responsible when we buy from these companies.
---
If people care about their way of life as they know it, I encourage them to take notice and get involved in making a difference for the better of all. As you said, "...what is happening here can also happen anywhere else in the world and I do not wish this upon any other nation ever." We are in this together.
---
It’s not even weak at all. It works well with the [[SN1P-SN4P]] thing.

It's not that people don't know, but that they may not know the specifics.  Consider all the people copying and pasting "spam this pong to free Hong Kong" in the twitch chat and I'm sure you could find some who couldn't tell you the full story.

CS:GO might technically be gambling. Most games aren't like CS:GO where they have a 3rd party website with a black market for digital goods.
---
I agree with the game theory aspect. People build games for people to keep coming back. 
---
Looks like my hands were ahead of my brain with the above quote. It was supposed to be "how do surprise mechanics fall out side of the scope of gambling".
---
 I guess I compare it to a roulette wheel. I know exactly what my odds are for each reward. I might get garbage, but if i am lucky i get a big payout. I can put in as much as I want but bigger risk gives more chance for reward. With a loot box we just swap a cash reward for the digital item, right?
---
Ok, keep insulting me if that helps you to let off steam.
---
Yea there are two interpretations of that. Stakes could mean that you need to cash out. 
---
Otherwise it would include investing time into your WoW character to get a chance at a random item. Which obviously most people wouldn't consider gambling because there's no stakes....I mean technically there are stakes, time, and a digital item...but come on.
---
That sounds almost as bad as getting tear gassed or your head caved in by a police officer.
---
I took the one insult out of my last comment, are you ready to say anything valuable now?
---
Thank you for the link. The first person talking about Kern to actually provide something more than just "Mark bad!"
---
Definitely agree that he sounds like a pretty crap dude, and I figured in the first place that a big part of why he's involved in all this is shameless self-promotion, but a lot of people (streamers included) are doing the same.
---
Fair enough that we can't trust Mark's words, but I stand by what I said in that the points aren't invalidated just because Mark repeated them.
---
Okay? Stop rioting and the police will go back to normal...problem solved.
---
Yeah, well, indifference in the face of all this is pretty monstrous in my eyes.
---
OK? I don’t see how that has literally anything to do with people not liking his persona. I have no personal issue with the guy and hope he prospers in his personal life, but am I not allowed to say that in regards to the entertainment he puts out I don’t care for his man child persona and find it annoying?

Most people just choose not to get informed because their whole political beliefs would collapse.
---
Yes, they do that, and yes, it sucks, but so does literally every multinational company on the planet, and in fact pretty much every small business, and indeed anyone who wants to make money ever, even just to feed their kids. This was a really lousy PR attempt from Blizzard but let's not pretend it's anything new or anything out of the ordinary. This shit happens everywhere, every day. People moderate their opinions and act differently to different people. I doubt you'd talk to your boss the way you talk to your drinking buddies, for example. It's a fact of life and society.
---
I really wanted to talk with you, it could have been interesting conversation, but you are obviously getting angry whenever someone says something that doesn't fit your agenda or views on the world, so we can't really have nice little chat here.
---
This sub proved that some people do care about karma.
---
Thanks for the downvote.
---
Sorry you didn't like my explanation, i won't bother you again. Stop being so aggressive with people trying to have a discussion with you.
---
I'm sure that's true, I'm just not sure what your point is. If you're saying that people shouldn't comment on things that they don't fully know about, I agree wholeheartedly. That said determining whether or not someone knows about a topic before they comment is difficult to say the least, and I don't think that putting all the onus on the protestors is fair. There are just as many pro-Blizzard people criticising the protestors who don't know the full situation either. By singling out only the protestors it appears that you are painting them exclusively as ignorant, which is what I take issue with.
---
Wow, a silver gilt! Before the brouhaha no one would upvote this. But now we're desperate for content, even meme posts gets gilted and upvoted!

No surprise mechancis I wouldn't compare to a roulette wheel. A surprise mechanic is when you have random rewards with no real stakes...you know it's just a game you play.
