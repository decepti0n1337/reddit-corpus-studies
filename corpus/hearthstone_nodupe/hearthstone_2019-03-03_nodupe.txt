Now that you've mentioned it, rouge hero looks like it's a Vulpera.
---
Or you know, you could have attacked with the 1/1s before the wurm, to deal 4 damage, or before the defile for 2. 
---
Yes, and also it basically prevents any weapons from being played at all. If you‚Äôre a rogue, you can‚Äôt even hero power without taking 10 to the face...

I have an S7 and it runs perfectly. It's extremely minimal overhead. Shouldn't affect performance on any phone really.

Yes.

Elise is value if you‚Äôve got decent card draw. Otherwise Lich king might be better.

God making players think... What a travesty that would be.
---
I've been out of arena for a while but zilliax has got to be really good. Lich King is very strong too, neither is a bad pick.

Streak stars let you advance in ranks while losing more games than you are winning, it should definitely not be possible to achieve legend that way.

I get that you want the card back, but giving it away like that is not going to make people happier.

If they made legend easy to get, In a few months time you'll make a new tread about wanting to get to high legend and not just dumpster legend.

I would actually be close to druid!
---
Do you suppose that is a viable business these days? I have played a lot of blizzard games in my time and havent found anybody selling hearthstone accounts to begin with or even advertising it. Besides the big fact that it's against the ToS agreement, the big money makers have primarily been diablo and world of warcraft. I would be really interested in seeing some profit margins.
---
Just to add, I would never sell my account- I am too attached to my years of hard work! This whole thing just fascinates me.

Can't see twitch chat, but did Roger just miss an easy lethal or am I miscounting?

Arcane tracker is great. It's a bit of a battery suck, but that mostly comes from HS itself.

I wouldn't call it broken as a standalone card (Recruit and Gul'dan are the real culprits) but cards should absolutely not be balanced around Silence. That's a bandaid solution.

---
Genn and Baku get nerfed to 1/1 and start in your hand (can't be mulliganed out) and no longer work if a non-odd/even card is shuffled in your deck.
---
Slightly reduces power level (essentially starting down one card) and introduces limited counter-play, but still preserves the essence of the card. 
---
I ain‚Äôt talkin!
---
Really glad to see it go. Tar creeper always felt like a giant ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to aggro. Felt a bit outrageous at 3 mana IMO. It‚Äôs one of those cards that‚Äôs super powerful without feeling OP, kind of like Firefly or Zilliax. 
---
Are these two dating or something? I don't really get it.
---
the list needs to be shorter; burn decks have been hated since freeze mage days. they are noninteractive and there's often little to nothing decks that don't go above 30 can do to about them

It was just something random that happened at one of the major tournaments a long time ago. They were just healing each others' faces for the first couple of turns. There was a lot of shipping after that, good times. Don't really know what happened to BaiZe since then, but I think I heard somewhere she had gotten banned for making a statement against blizzard or something.
---
download the mobile deck tracker...
---
That's the one, I knew there was a minion, had them mixed up.
---
I don't plan to spend all of it. And my arena winrate is not that great (between 3 and 4 wins per run). I've just saved up a lot over the years.
---
Mirror image would be my guess. 
---
I was close I said the last one was going to be troll/zandalar
---
50/50 it happens or it dosent 
---
Looking back, I kinda miss Yogg
---
Considering the new HCT tournament format is single deck, it would be wild if multiclass decks were actually a thing. Not just in a limited sense. Almost impossible to balance because warlock hero power is so strong and really only balanced by comparatively weak card pool. Couldn't just be straightforward like dual class arena.

I understand that. I was replying to the following statement the previous person had made:

Zilliax is a blood death knight confirmed
---
I didn‚Äôt pass, but I have no clue why it shows Baku in his hand
---
But if you win games at Rank 15, you rank up anyway, right? Otherwise you would have to intentionally lose games to stay at rank 15. Are you saying that intentionally losing games to stay at a rank floor and farming gold there is more efficient than just playing the game normally and accruing gold naturally?
---
His quest got counterspelled, for anyone that didn‚Äôt get it. 
---
Sexual healing. 
---
I like how this guy calls farming 10 gold for 3 wins an "exploit". As if that would incur a non-zero marginal cost for Blizzard.
---
i mean im pretty sure i can tweet "buck flizz" at play hearthsotne and not get banned. china is harsh.
---
And Swamp Dragon egg.
---
Wait that was a card....
---
I agree with this. Zilliax is hella good, but can become a bit situational in arena. The life gain is great, and divine shield and rush is cool but he can still often times trade out with 2 small creatures.
---
Lich King is a freakin' house, your hardest challenge there is making it until turn 8 if he's in your hand but he's a tough card to remove and if they don't, the bonus of a random DK card every turn can help spiral games. One of the downsides of Lich King is often Army of the Dead or Doom Pact milling good cards but in arena I don't think self-mill is a major impact.
---
Yes you play 50/50 you win one game and insta surrender the next to stay on the same rank I thought that was obvious. 
---
THE LIGHT SHALL BURN YOU!
---
Dust unless you want to play doomguard in wild.
---
not sure what point you're trying to make.

decent copypasta
---
To all the scrubs trying to rank... I'm enjoying the gold mine at rank 15. Thanks! I hope you spend your time wisely. The exploitation of the ladder is in full effect, thanks devs for being as stupid as you are. The basement babies can keep on trying for that card back.. I'll keep laughing. Nothing like another 120 packs on relase day B)  Oh and that hall of fame complete golden card dust refund... oh my.. thanks Activision rejects!

My best Turn with my Tessspionage deck was a Call to Arms into Tirion, Shirvalla and another taunt. Shame the opponent quit right after:(
---
No, you don't have to evaluate all 5 wings, because you don't buy the first one.  You evaluate 4 wings and the rewards you get from the 4 wings.
---
Is 12 packs, a gold pack, and a gold legendary worth 2800 gold, is the question.  The answer is debatably yes, debatably no, it's definitely not a bargain but it's also not a horrible deal; however, it is something you're required to buy if you want to enjoy the full PvE experience, so I think that's pretty lame.
---
Yeah, it's probably Dalaran themed.
---
Do you need to disenchant all 9 cards? Or not at all for the dust?
---
A lot of people did guess a troll theme for the third expansion, though. Boomsday was just about impossible to guess.

Why even bother lying and making a list of stupid changes "as if you know"?

I don't get it.
---
Were you listening to a thing he said during the video? He was already guaranteed the win. Winning quickly wasn't the point. He was going full meme for maximum Boar damage.
---
I don't know why you're being downvoting. You're right. People who play MTG or other physical card games don't need achievement logs and free stuff to keep them playing.
---
The game ***should*** be enough, but sadly it's not.
---
I‚Äôve done this once, to a rouge on turn 3 who didn‚Äôt play anything turn 1. Insta concede

Underrated comment.

Apart from HoF stuff like other said I'd suggest waiting until new expansion/rotation and sticking to Standard. http://standardhearth.com

"Surrounded by Priests. Every time I close my eyes, I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces."

OOPS! All ~Berries~ Zilliax!

These cards are rather weak in wild mostly. Sounds like some uninformed Standard player projecting their biases on a format they know little about.
---

They are saying that you can't hear part of the line without mentally finishing it.  Idea is that simply remembering part of the meme makes you think of the rest.

It doesn‚Äôt need to, because Netherstorm has goblins almost everywhere. It was pretty much a given that a Netherstorm set would include goblins in some capacity.

It‚Äôs gonna suck! ü§°
---
I do play chess.
---
And I don't get the justification "It's a card game of course there's that shit element in it".
---
The idea is, the least RNG the better. There will always be some (say, draw RNG) but even this can be fixed, by making the power level of cards more on par, so games aren't won/lost simply due to deck ordering; The ordering should change your strategy, NOT your winrate.
---
There is not a single reason why the games *needs* to have bullshit rng like playing a stonehill on 10 and sometimes you get underpowered 3 mana taunts, and sometimes you get one of the big ones (tarim, lich king etc...).
---
That's ignoring the other rewards apart from the 10g per 3 wins though. This game is perfectly playable f2p. 
---
Besides, making more money by working in real life is nothing surprising or special, in fact, the in game economy would be *fucked* if that wasn't the case.
---
Imagine playing for an hour bought you 10 packs, everyone would have full collections within no time and no-one would ever buy packs. The game would shutdown as Blizzard would never make any money.
---
If Blizzard are stingy with anything, it's the opposite, that paying real money buys you fuck all packs...

I actually bought all the seasons of HIMYM. The last season is unopened because of how it ended. Even on Netflix, if I have it on in the background, I just stop the show on the last season cuz that ending was complete bullshit
---
You know what else is in the Netherstorm? A lot of things that aren't Dr. Boom.
---
No one is saying it doesn't make sense in retrospect, just that it would have been impossible to narrow it down to Dr. Boom specifically just from the teaser image. Pretty sure nobody guessed that about it, which is the point - there's always an important aspect of the expansion which can't be deciphered from this image alone.
---
I usually wear cologne.
---
I've tried building a couple dragon based decks for post rotation. Warlock and Paladin have been looking decent.
---
that loop on the Thank emote tho.
---
For me, it's a lack of tools to combat hyper-aggressive decks, and combo decks that don't have to risk combo pieces to stay alive.
---
This card ended up being a snowball enabler.  
---
Card text should have been:  If your a mage, maintain board control with blizzard of flamestrike.  If you are any other class, the board can only be reset and you lose only the board advantage.  All other options means your change of winning are all on RNG.
---
They quit way before the message that they left popped up. It just waits that long to end the game in case they come back I assume.
---
Wut?
---
But I saw them move the cards though while the time was running out.
---
That's racist /s
---
I tried in vain to [make sense of the hieroglyphs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avxef9/can_we_decipher_the_hieroglyphs_in_the_2nd/) in the second expansion. Can anybody help?
---
I average 7 wins. It's definitely a skill that you get better at. While you might not see a lot of kripps 2-3s and 1-3s, he definitely is really REALLY good at arena, as shown by the fact that he had the highest average wins a while ago.

Not really. That isn‚Äôt even Android so my point still stands.

So I should craft a Golden Genn, 2 golden copies of both Gloom Stag and Glitter Moth and 2 golden Divine Favors.
---
They have a good deck tracker on mobile though.
---
Blizzard would rather surgically removing the testicles of their underpaid and mistreated employees than nerf anything higher in rarity than a rare.
---
If they do that, they have to refund the dust, which means less players buying packs.  Less players buying packs means they have to lay off even more employees to give their CEO an absurd bonus.
---
fuck bro, nice downvotes
---
I mean, it's artistically placed there to resemble a cigar, so you were meant to see it
---
You get the dust value of the highest version of your cards up to the deck limit. If you have a regular Baku you get 1600 dust. If you craft golden Baku you spend 3200 dust and receive 3200 dust. Then you can disenchant the normal Baku for 400.
---
You get the dust and keep the card. Which means you can get a profit of the normal dust amount per card

Nice! That sort of Mana curve has been working for me too lately, load up on 2 drops, fuck 6 drops, handful of big boys. Your deck looks fun and frustrating to play against. 
---
Yes, thats an awesome deck!  
---
You think it was intentional?
---
Oh this is that source for that fresh pasta in kripp's chat last night

Of course it is. Even the way he pouts the lips and that old man gaze looks like he's about to take a deep chug off that cigar. 
---
I started playing arena more regularly in January. I started out getting 1-3 wins. But the last few weeks my average is probably 5 wins, including my first 12 win run ever. On top of understanding which cards work for your playstyle and how to play in general, you definitely gain an understanding of the meta and what frequently picked cards your opponent might have.
---
Yes, you'll get refunded on the playable copies of golden cards that get sent to the Hall of Fame and get to keep them.

What was the best thing Bane of Doom have you? And did it steal and games?

Question being:
---
Did the AI eventually end the match, or is it hero powering to this day 
---
100% agree. Cubing a doomguard or voidlord is absolutely fine. Cubing a doomguard or voidlord that you got for free on turn 4 is not fine.
---
try playing against a guy whose mana crystals refresh every time he plays a card
---
If you talking about that adventure golden legendary I should say that's a fixed legendary for everyone who buys the solo adventure. &amp; I'm not sure if you can dust it or not.
---
Is the influx of solitaire decks complaining about solitaire decks them becoming self aware? Or are they completely oblivious at the hypocrisy?
---
you afford at least nongolden Genn/Glitter/Gloom
---
Try saving up for golden versions of the epics if you can
---
You could also make 2 golden Black Cats for profit
---
The class identity is just the general theme of the class.  They can change over time but some things won't (like Priest being a good healer or Mage having powerful Spells.)
---
The strengths and weaknesses are usually pretty subtle too.  Sometimes the strongest classes might seem to do everything.  The classical one is that Druid is supposed to be bad at efficiently removing big minions (why they are losing Naturalize) at rotation.
---
You can read the other  comment on this page but I find that Blizzard's descriptions of what a class *should be* doesn't always equal that result.
---
I mean, you can't rely deny that it's an iconic card lol
---
Because in this case, the difference between 'killing a minion' and 'doing x damage' is why the secret works how it does.
---
Because it's simple design and it seems to be a strong cars to the uninitiated. 
---
The ending wasn't the problem.the problem was the freaking 3 seasons about Barney's wedding

I guess people will never learn that single games don't matter.

I didn‚Äôt lose a game with him and thought he was OP. The only matchup I lost was to warlock (which is beyond broken).
---
Oh man, I have kept a golden copy of this stupid card for so long even though I rarely put it in my decks, I'm honestly a little salty and kind of amazed it dodged the nerf bat so many balance patches in a row !! 
---
And now that it's rotating to wild, there's very little chance it'll ever get touched again, so might as well just grab the 400dust and make my peace with it :/
---
It's not an AI. He's playing Tavern Brawl
---
Cubelock and Deathrattle Hunter were my favorite decks because of their adaptability, not having them around will be weird, but probably overall better for the health of the game. 
---
Damn freeloaders. 
---
Doomguard was never a problem before this card was printed. 
---
People were definitely guessing a troll-related third expansion from day one, turned out pretty accurate.
---
We know that the devs inability to balance cards will lead to broken decks and interactions that will cause more players to quit the game 
---
Same with the toad
---
Only a fool would play Malygos on an empty board
---
No, is a good card, but is annoying as fuck
---
https://youtu.be/9Trj6eVhs-M?t=38
---
heh.  this guy's (possessive form) toast.
---
Thank you. Single cards are almost never oppressive on their own. It‚Äôs always a combination. Baku is not oppressive in a deck with even cost cards, and odd decks with no Baku are crap. Their combined effect is the problem.
---
But either way, the Cube was part of the equation that resulted in something pretty annoying. It isn‚Äôt the only thing to blame, but it was a major enabler. 
---
There are plenty of cool designs that I would love to be in the game in concept, but they would be too good in reality. Cube is just one of those that happened to make it in. As you said, good riddance.

In Druid  Bloodsail Corsair is much better for Mark of the Lotus, Paladin deckhand is pretty good with Muster for battle, truesilver. What other classes are you wanting to run it in
---
They‚Äôve nerfed so many cards that the decks aren‚Äôt nearly as strong as most people imagine who haven‚Äôt played wild. You can take the top standard deck and ladder pretty well.
---
&gt; decks that play this card don't wait a whole turn to attack with cube
---
This is a fundamental issue with charge, not the cube. Also you'll note your main offender is doomguard, which I believe is correctly being Hall of famed. 
---
Not as unfun as [[Fungalmancer]].

Yeah. 10/2 kingbane on turn 5? It's crazy man. 
---
not really when they get the death rattle to trigger
---
Let me change your mind
---
I literally just had this happen to me in a game of tavern brawl, thats an insane coincidence.
---
That's the actual quote, it sounds kind of like an F instead of an M though
---
I actually regret not crafting him in standard, because he sees so much use even today. 
---
Cubelocks and Catacombs
---
Odd zoo?
---
One of my favorite cards ever I have a displate of it 
---
I missed lethal in multiple spots, on purpose, to achieve the big boar. In my youtube video I even included the end of the previous game, where I said "I wanna make a really big boar." I deleted my original post because I realized it was probably better to include just the highlight of the turn rather than the whole game because a highlight on reddit probably shouldn't be 11 minutes long if I want people to actually watch it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, this comment makes no sense, because I still included the full game on youtube, where I "miss lethal," for everyone to see in my previous comment.
---
*Dark spirits, twist the trees. Foul the lakes! And curse this lad!*
---
it does get punished by silence.
---
there‚Äôs no world where silence isnt good against deathrattles. It might not be an instant win button, but silencing a cube still silenced the cube even if it‚Äôs deathrattle was already triggered
---
8 packs from Bunny for the last 2 events. More than my 4 years of picking 1 pack scrubs 
---
Just use the search bar.
---
Lol that may be OP. Who knows amigo i played since open beta, and honestly have only gotten more and more dissapointed and frustrated as the game has evolved. aggro seems completely destroyed( zoo loc or hunter especially), and the mechanic i was most excited for are all terrible.( discard warlock ) its been about a month since ive played, and i am loving mtga! :D
---
Of sewers, yes, but not necessarily *the* sewers. They love to deliberately mislead people with these. Remember how the teaser image for Rumble was a Pirate Parrot, and pirates were only a sliver of the theme? Could totally be something similar.
---
How dare you talk shit about magma rager?
---
You can change your feed to "new" instead of "hot" or "best". This will let you see all posts rather than just memes. About once every 20 minutes this question is asked and answered.
---
I would never. üò¨
---
Infinite mana! Armored druidscales!
---
I find that the card's complexity varies a lot depending on the matchup. There's the question of what you want to cube, when to be greedy, and when to go for pure tempo. 
---
Against some decks you just want to sacc it immediately, whereas in other cases you need the value. 
---
just found a link to a video explaining what to do. Thanks guys 
---
You‚Äôll have to do some very involved math to figure out the most efficient method, but you can safely dust 2x Naturalize and any other extras now.  You‚Äôll only get dust for the first two copies.  
---
The stupid thing is, if it actually did what it said it does, it would be pretty balanced. It says ‚ÄúDeathrattle: Summon two copies of it‚Äù. So by that logic, if you were to target a 1 HP Zilliax without it‚Äôs divine shield, you would summon two 1 HP Zilliaxes without divine shield. But instead it summons two Zilliaxes at full heath and with everything the card started with. If they truly wanted that to be the case, they should have made it say: ‚ÄúDeathrattle: REsummon two copies of it‚Äù.
---
... my God.
---
I remember the rage coming from everyone when after Tft they said they didn't want to update the pool with the new sets.
---
Not to take away from the other presenters, but if Firebat was (co)casting every game, I think I'd rediscover some love for watching entire HS tournaments even when I don't like the meta. There is something very engaging about his casual yet knowledgeable style.
---
Definition had no real outs to the situation. If I remember the board state:
---
Definition - 0 cards in deck, ~6 in hand. 5/5 Toggwaggle, 9/4 Hakkar, 1/5 Scarab
---
Lueying - Is Malf DK. 1 card in deck, 9 in hand. 5/4 Ghoul, 1/5 Scarab
---
Both players had over 30 health+armor, but Lueying had a slight lead. Definition's hand was dead IIRC, just ramp and draw, whereas Lueying still had a Naturalize and some other low-impact-but-not-totally-dead cards.
---
Definition has already burned his Toggwaggle combo. Lueying has the lead in fatigue plus Malf DK, and can just burn any corrupted bloods by filling up his hand. Definition can't fill up his hand or get a lead in fatigue, so if his two minions are cleaned up he has no way to win the game.
---
So Definition's only win con is beatdown with his two big minions. But he can't stop Lueying from trading his own ghoul into one, and Definition knows Lueying will have a Naturalize in hand next turn to clear out the other one. So, he concedes.
---
Grats now hes fired!
---
That seems good.Have you ever realised that they‚Äôve nerfed hunter after 1 month of being op but that they‚Äôve only nerfed odd paladin after 6 months of being op(witchwood to level up nerf)?
---
People really milking the tar creeper karma ha
---
Don‚Äôt dust cards you want to keep to craft any of those cards though - you‚Äôll lose dust then.  
---
It's one of those decks which doesn't have a very good winrate but feels terrible to play against. I personally don't want team 5 to kill the decks but a few options outside of Aggro would be nice.
---
Hey, my Deathrattle Jade Rogue with Cube was perfectly balanced (as all things should be)
---
Jade rogue is a decent deck if you know what to do and change depending on what you face. You have a decent chance against aggro, though if you go with n'zoth focus which i recomend, even shaman is probably your worst match up due devolve(gets through your taunts, removes healing from beetle/misstres of mixtures/applebaum and such and ruins your deathrattle synergy).
---
Big priest if you have decent draw is beatable aswell, if they dont have turn 3barnes into yshaarij into rag or something.
---
Overal if you like the deck id say jade rogue is something that certainly can get wins and is worth playing But you have to adept aswell acording to meta(face alot of pirate warrior and kingsbane is worth using a ooze prolly and golaka crawlers).

---
Is my current list i got in total  387 recorded games and over 400 in total with not recorded ones.
---
Sonya is just a insane value card, that has multiple uses but main one is extra jades. can aslo be worth using backstab on your own minion to get even more copies or if you got 2out from valeera or shadowcaster use it on 1sonya so you have a future cheap copy ready for use.
---
Valeera is  large cost but she gives just a ton of value and is a big resource generator,she also allows you to be more lenient with jade use in early game(like not being able to combo shuriken but you have to use it, or using jade spirit as first jade card, raptor without a deathrattle etc) Also gives you more control over what you want from n'zoth as you can duplicate the deathrattles to have more chance to show up from n'zoth.
---
N'zoth just grants a large board swing, demands a imeadte asnwer and often leaves behind a few big threats aswell. Just be wary of kazzakus 10mana poly potion.
---
Coldlight is just consistent draw it doesnt put you ahead in fatique(not big issue at all but it helps even a bit at times) and can mill important cards like combo pieces or malganis from lock, or burning minions so priest cant ress them. Sap aslo works well with coldlight and no combo makes it consitent draw you cab Always use unlike minstrel. Also in grindy matches can give lethal through a gulldan/n'zoth wall of taunts.
---
Vial can be used for extra healing when needed on beetle/misstres or applebaum. But most of the time youl want to use on aya or swarmer for bumping your jades. Builds your jades early and creates huge threats lategame while still having the deathrattle that spawns a extra minion to protect against aoe.
---
Shadowcaster is alot like vial but has more flexibilty. Also allows for aya + aya with valeera the hollow later. Can give you basicly infinite minions late game  if you use shadowcaster into shadowcaster (from valeera). You can go jade spirit, 1mana shadowcaster on spirit and shadowcaster copy on the shadowcaster which gives you basicly infinite threats.
---
I use walk the plank over vilespine cause doesnt have a combo so i can Always use it, it answer a on curve giant or 4 mana 7/7 and allows you to have mana left over for a swarmer or shuriken even after using 2.
---
And i use applebaum over sludgebelcher as its better against burn decks, and it aslo doesnt make you loose health against explosive runes,same goes for beetle and misstress who are important cards to battle against aggro.
---
Feel free to ask me anything about the deck aswell :)
---
It's sort of sad that rexxar gonna be a pain in the ass for blizz in the following years.
---
So many classes can easily have viable aggro decks with the addition of just one or two key cards in expansions. I think what they're trying to move away from is having aggro always enabled and in the same way every expansion.
---
to be fair, the search bar in reddit is kinda wack

Hearthstone and the Merseyside derby, nice. 
---
Agreed.  Also, the framing device of the story, Ted telling his kids about all his courtships over the years, demands the show end the way it did.  It doesn't make sense that two kids would sit and listen as their dad talks in detail about his dating history with other women...  unless maybe their mother isn't in the picture anymore, and they want to help him move on.  
---
I think that was just the default class deck...
---
For putting a card game up on the TV? Right.

---
Oh I know of Gallery Priest, which is one of the (at most) 2 decks that it sees play in. Myra even sees occasional play in deathrattle rogue, but Mecharoo is in like 5+ high tier decks. That's what I mean by most playable

Greiton #2546 EU trading 80g quest.
---
What's the difference between this and the one kripps using? 
---
As far as I am aware. 
---
One this that can be pretty consistent if you feel like the opponent doesnt have the AOE is: 
---
Turn 2 - Jade Swarmer
---
 Turn 3 - Necrium Blade hit something
---
 Turn 4- Baron Rivendare, Break your weapon to get 2 Jade ticks, and then run your Jade Swarmer into something for 2 more Jade ticks.
---
Swept him
---
He has a very confident casting style that makes me feel more engaged with the game. He never says "that could possibly be the maybe best play". Instead he knows exactly what's going on and what to say and it makes me feel like I'm part of the match rather than watching from afar
---
Deck list? Priest is my favorite class and I have two golden star aligners that need something to do, and I‚Äôve been trying to make an odd priest deck forever.
---
His greeting should be the entire Algalon speech. 
---
OMG! That's not a cigar!
---
Yo I thought he had a cigar in his mouth this whole time
---
We were actually told by blizzard that it *would* add new beasts with subsequent expansions, at the time of its first release. That was why people were still hyped about it
---
Team spirits be the best spirits.
---
Actually it looks like the opposite. Cards designed for Aggro specifically is getting rarer and rarer in newer expansions. Without Baku and Keleseth, getting that last bit of damage in before two turns of big taunts will be hard for many classes soon. The Year of The Raven didn't add much to help that... unless you play hunter 
---
Plus Loatheb battlecry to basically lock the game
---
I picked him because of his name and because he was European. My friend did it for the same reasons and we are watching the GF now. 
---
He wouldn't have though.
---
People hate on Rexxar because he's a one card win condition against control decks. Even with the old pool, he still would have done that. Most of the beasts you make with Rexxar are pretty mediocre anyway, but since they never stop coming it doesn't matter.
---
He would have been a worse card with only the old pool, sure, but not in the way that people complain about.
---
SAME it's my most hated card ever. It's the core for my two most hated decks, cubelock and deathratle hunter
---
By final chapter, I mean the one with the massive battle that ends the war. She even [said it, herself](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5119836.stm) when referring to the battle and the deaths therein.

I hate this card
---
Reminds memoreof nagrand than stranglethorn
---
They look gud, and it's a luxury. I from the start never dusted gold. I wish I had never started collecting them though, Id probably have every card. 
---
a few expension later, none of the classic cards were playable. classes identity changes every expansion 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt use Tracking on turn one. The goal of that card is to maximize value, you use it when you need a specific card in a specific situation. Not on turn one, when you don‚Äôt yet know what you are going to need. If used in turn one, it‚Äôs nothing more, than deck trimming, which hunter generally doesn‚Äôt need,
---
Ok, stealing this right now. Thank you, fellas.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much how arena works. You think you‚Äôve built the best deck ever, with constructed synergies and combos, and you‚Äôll still go 0-3 because of rng. Fully random cards with low tier scores are just as capable of getting 12 wins as they are getting 0. Arena always feels like a casino game to me, and strategy so rarely comes up, that it‚Äôs better to just play everything on curve. 
---
&gt;Cards designed for Aggro specifically is getting rarer and rarer in newer expansions.
---
Unless they literally stop printing new burn for Mage, token synergy for Druid, cheap efficient minions for Warlock, etc. and fundamentally change the identity of the classes by removing Basic and Classic entirely, the potential will always be there.
---
Some classes only need one or two aggressive cards every other year for it to happen in Standard.
---
Yup. People think that legacy is a faster format than modern and it isn't because of force of will. It really adds a lot of depth to the game
