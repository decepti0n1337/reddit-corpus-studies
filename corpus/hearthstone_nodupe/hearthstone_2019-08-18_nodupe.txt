I really really didn't know why I thought this was a real video and the hearthstone development team would actually communicate with us
---
I’m just here for that Warsong Commander change. Patron Warrior was the first deck I ever used to climb to Legend, and one of the only decks I’ve ever really loved playing in Hearthstone. I understood why it needed to be nerfed, but it never sat right with me that they essentially deleted Warsong from the game and never bothered to revisit it. I think incorporating Rush into the Core set is a brilliant idea (especially since it’s clear Blizzard prefers Rush to Charge, and Rush seems to be a much healthier mechanic).
---
I have a few problems with your other ideas, but plenty of others have pointed those out. I just want to support the Warsong change. I don’t wanna be sad every time I see her in my Collection.
---
Definitely aggro warrior. Since you had the dust to get control warrior I’m sure you’ll be able to afford it. It only runs three legends, zilliax, an auto-include in the majority of decks, leeroy, an auto-include in most aggro decks and grom. I found that the deck can easily be played without grom if you don’t have it. Besides that it also runs two copies of town crier and two bloodsworn mercenaries and everything else is common and rare. Check hsreplay.net for the most popular decklist. Just in case, grom can be replace with arcanite reaper. Aggro warrior is really fun to play and has a favorable matchup against basically every relevant deck besides control warrior.
---
That would look quite bad when your 1 or 2 cards were displayed way over to the left where they’d be in a 10-card hand.
---
This one actually makes sense, it's just missing quotations. It reads much better as:
---
Discover a spell or a "pick a mystery" choice
---
You're region and standard or wild?
---
USA Standard
---
Legend is for best. If you are not then watch out for mistakes and avoid them. Trust me it feels better when you achive it alone. As many said every deck is legend viable if you are good enough
---
Yeah because what's more fun than playing against control? Playing a card game with no deck.
---
Why? As long as you can still see them and read them ...
---
#$%$ you dad its who I am!
---
1. It wound take time of your turn.
---
2. It’s because of your “Let the Pain speak to me” Minions (Idk the name).
---
Things like Live-steal and Poison need time to trigger if you noticed this before. This Minions also. They get hit, animation of this mage minion is interrupted, you draw a card -&gt; and it goes on.
---
Request sent
---
I can get behind this complaint
---
I think it's very fun for a Dungeon Run boss, but i don't know anyone who likes their hero card to be this inconsistent. This definitely nerf Boom, but this is so unfun to play (and i don't even play Warrior).
---
Hey everybody! I am rarran, been playing hearthstone since closed beta, and hit legend multiple times! My youtube is normally about making memes and dreams happen, love to make people laugh and have a good time.
---
THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT!
---
I upload everyday on my YouTube channel: https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCrWJQayN_0HTwgxsuqYMVIA
---
My personal change to dr boom is not removing any hero power or changing the cost, he just simply doesn't gain the 7 armor from playing dr boom. This gives aggro decks and tempo decks a chance to run boom down before any healing happens, while still making the card a viable choice
---
High five! Probably the most fun in Standard that I’ve ever had
---
I have a challenge a friend quest. Stratix#1752, Region: NA.
---
SandWitch#11943
---
I think compared to other metas its fine. Of course cards like pocket galaxy might be a little to powerful but it's nowhere as BS as compared to the aggro shaman or jade meta that blizzard refused to even fix
---
OP is clearly talking about July's Brawls, not Brawliseum.
---
stars are usually made of gas... so it's just farting on people to death
---
I actual love this card. Its super close to being viable as well, just needs a deck with enough face damage. I tried a face rogue early on with this and Plague of Madness to just be super duper aggro. Didn't work too well past the first few turns.
---
yeah, it's unfortunately for the few seriously disabled people suffering due to the majorities behavior. And It happens everyone in life, not just in hearthstone. The few good always pay for the masses bad.
---
Hey OP if you play in the american server pls pm me your battletag I would have no problem to play with someone that takes extra time. Also you seem very polite, maybe we could have a fun time.
---
Black knight and I got lich king I believe
---
This is squarely for newbies, some one new buys  20 packs from wild, and gets upset when they realize its not playable in standard. 
---
Dont get me wrong I wish they would just remind me like MTG arena does but I get their position.
---
I've been playing for 3 years and I've could tolerate any meta except for this one, I have to choose between a 40 min game against warrior and lost anyway, or go against mage drooping 1 mana alex, Antonidas and Kalegcos in that order and get frozen until the otk.
---
Just like how everyone is on even footing before you roll a hearthstone game. The fact that before you start rolling your arena deck you are on even footing doesn’t really justify the idea that it’s more skill based.
---
“Look how stupid this is they just rolled three 1/3 chances! I wish they rolled a 1/27, that would take more skill”
---
Hearthstone’s skill show in constant ladder play and overall statistic of wins since the game is so volatile. There is a lot of skill you can have in this game, but it’s kind of stupid to try to put it in an esports format. A pro arena player will almost always get above seven wins. A pro ladder player will have a ludicrous win rate. A pro tourney player ... wins ... sometimes? The point of hearthstone tourneys is to watch the good ladder players play against each other, just because someone won doesn’t mean they’re necessarily better than the other, it just showcases high level play.
---
An arena tourney would be equal skill to a standard tourney even though it would probably be more fun to watch.
---
P.S. Specialist format fucking sucks
---
I don’t stream but I watch a lot of streamers as it gives me insights on to decks I wouldn’t normally play, and shows me what opponents tend to do.
---
I’ve found that Mattchu is one of the more entertaining streamers out there, he interacts with his followers and teaches them along the way.  He is also pretty funny especially with his interactions with his viewers. 
---
He’s currently running the combo priest, and cruising through the high ranks (rank 2) on his way to legend.
---
If you find yourself on Twitch, you gotta check him out!
---

---
Hey! I'm a relatively new streamer and I mainly play arena.
---
Would love to have you guys drop by for a chat and feel free to give any advice!
---
https://www.twitch.tv/loldrones
---
Yes. You can beat them. They lose to ladder all the time. Can you come anywhere close to their ladder win percentages is the question.
---
It’s just hard as a new player to get cards from all the expansions than it is to from the last 6 only
---
"We want to cut costs on paying people to keep actively balancing a game mode nobody except Kripp cares about" is what I read between the lines.
---
I love Arena and hate the fact it's not ever taken seriously. I would watch the shit out of tournaments of people playing with Arena-style drafted decks.
---
I recently received a friend request from someone who said "that emote at the end was unnecessary man. Why do you feel the need to bm?" 
---
I emote "well played" at the end of most of my games. I did so in that game. My intention was to let my opponent know that they played well. 
---
What's the lesson? Assuming makes an ass out of you and me. It's unfortunate that there is such a large amount of players who would rather assume the worst than give you the benefit of the doubt. I don't forsee this changing in the future, either. Maybe if more people like yourself voice these issues, Blizzard will do something about it. I have little hope though, as they don't have a great track record of responding quickly to public issues.
---
Who DIDN’T get this statistic in their monthly review? Feels like everyone I talk to got this or the warlock equivalent.
---
Mind Blast offers damage from hand and encourages building decks that OTK opponents *from having no Board.* In the decks that it is/was core (Cloning Gallery Priest, Mind Blast Priest) the Priest player would often just 0 to death the opponent over one or two turns with little interaction. While I personally found those decks engaging as the one playing them, they definitely are sour to play against when you can be on the verge of victory, at full health, against an opponent with no board, and watch them just cloning gallery, double mind blast, and win.
---
Divine Spirit/Inner Fire generally requires minions to stick to be good. It fits with the Priest fantasy of healing and buffing your minions, keeping them alive so they keep you alive. Yes, Divine Spirit/Inner Fire does present the potential for an "OTK" but it is something the opponent can interact with as they clear the board, as we have rarely seen decks go from no board to DS/IF OTK combos (and those that have weren't particularly good).
---
While it might be powerful right now, which ultimately makes something unfun to play against (because we don't like losing), it comes and goes because it is *not* powerful enough in its own right to pull a deck. As a combo it only works if there are enough supporting cards from expansions, which is a very healthy spot for a classic combo to be in (as opposed to Leeroy &gt; Shadowstep, for instance). It is also predictable if you are reading your opponent's hand and highly techable (silence, taunts, polymorphs, rush, etc all interact with it).
---
Your desire for games that "should not end after 4 turns" is a little silly. Many aggro decks top out at 5 mana with Leeroy or a similar finisher. They are looking to close out on turns 5 and 6. If they aren't presenting lethal by turn 7 they are probably going to lose. Problematically, you are also complaining about the "perfect" hand from the opponent, but there are lots of perfect hands in lots of decks that present difficult solutions. Every aggro deck has an ideal curve that can quickly get out of control.
---
*Trump has left the chat*
---
Asstistics.
---
I’ve been playing a secret quest mage which has been fun. Basically a mixture of cyclone mage and secret mage with the quest added in (since it was the free one I got)
---
Renolock definitely, or you could go Mecha'thunlock if you enjoyed it so much in Standard.
---
You may want to look at the Tempostorm lists for both.
---
https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/wild/2019-08-16
---
Honestly, I don’t think KEA needs to be as necessarily powerful as it was in mech Paladin. To me it feels like more of a backup plan in Quest, because otherwise you should be duplicating enough eggs to keep constant pressure.
---
Because people are still paying 80-150€/$ every expansion, so Blizzard won't change their business model.
---
Mustn't
---
So how does one buy a new hero? I went there today and couldn’t understand why there were so few options.
---
He played the safe card.
---
Screw warrior at the moment. I rather have jade druid instead
---
Now that's what I call a rank 10 combo!
---
Haha I loved the past phrase
---
One class that makes you have a 20 minute match almost every time you face it. It's agonizingly slow and painful.
---
Sov? You mean Sou? If then it quite strong with some highlander card and open a lot of archtype with quest,other than warrior domination I say sou is pretty fine for an expansion unlike rastakhan.
---
I do enjoy hearthstone.
---
I think the game has its ups and it's downs but overall, I enjoy playing the games.
---
I do think there are some issues with the game as is. I think the Murloc Pally combo is an issue, similar to Luna's Pocket Galaxy because they both decide the game very early. I think, similarly Dr Boom is an issue, and while there is a lot of counterplay to him, a lot of players feel like when he comes down, it decides the game very quickly.
---
Other cards I take issues with include the Druid Quest, and the Shaman quest, for almost the same reason. The druid quest requires very little effort to double the value of your choose one cards at no cost. The shaman quest also doubles the value of cards, but in this case it doubles the power of your battlecry cards. To fix this, I'd like to see the druid power cost 1 Mana to use, and the shaman quest require overload cards rather than battlecry cards to complete it. I don't have an issue with the shaman reward, but the quest is completed WAY too fast to make games against it fun at all because of the density of lackey generating cards. Requiring the shaman to overload at least 6 Mana means that they are making a sacrifice, much like the druid, to get the doubling of their cards, rather than being rewarded for doing something you already want to do.
---
Is it in a good spot? Yeah. Is it fun? For sure! But these are the cards/concepts that I'd like to see adjusted to make the game more fun, for me anyway.
---
Ehh I’m gonna be honest I’m torn here. At the human level I do sympathize with you. But that said, I’m still 100% sure if I queued up with you I would be very annoyed. Even if you have legitimate reasons (which I have no way of knowing anyways), I still couldn’t feel anything except annoyance. You could be disabled, you could just have bad internet, or you could even be being beaten with jumper cables by your dad. Truth is the reasons don’t matter, I don’t want my time wasted when I’m playing. Depends how long your turns take but I would definitely get annoyed and I even rope back if my opponent is constantly roping me for basic turns. I mean I’m not going to assume you’re disabled and give you the benefit of the doubt, I’m going to assume you’re a dick and act accordingly. I think that friending you and harassing you is a bit much but roping back is totally something I do...  
---
So yeah don’t expect other people to treat you any differently when you literally come off as a dick when you play. No one knows or cares about the reason, the end result is annoying all the same. Like same as how no one cares if you had good intentions if you screwed things up anyways. Like at some point you just gotta own that you are a big annoyance when you play and accept the salt. I mean if multiple people have gotten mad, I’m pretty sure the problem isn’t them, it’s you...
---
And Dr Boom please.
---
MTG:A is a FAR better f2p game than hearthstone have ever been.
---
“I used the stones to destroy the stones”
---
Because that wouldn't be as fun
---
They don't want too many options in the game. Wild players would have no problem getting in the site to buy their packs. Honestly I totally understand and agree with not having that option in game. They want to only entice people to play standard and that's good, Wild is there as an option (not saying they shouldn't give it attention or balance)
---
Message Received: Blizzard will remove this section and sell the heroes with future expansion bundles.
---
You say Mage has some of the best Basic and Classic cards... and then suggest a buff to Spellbender? :thinking:
---
i hate these kind of rng brawls
---
The sheer irony of you possibly playing someone else who is disabled and roping for the same reason you are is mind boggling.
---
no.
---
Spellbender doesn't affect spells that target heroes.
---
No, you have to change the way it sorts to All Cards. Then everytime you go into the menu to craft it gives you a warning message like "This card can not be used in Standard. It is for Wild only. Do you still wish to continue?" which I think is more than enough. Anybody but a small child would craft a ton of Wild cards when they first start and a child shouldn't be spending that kind of money on a game like that before they've played enough to know the difference between Wild and Standard.
---
 I'm 25 and I made enough bad choices dusting legends the first few months I played and I put about 60$ to get me started (same as a new video game). I wish they were more transparent like that about the only getting one of each legend until you have them all so I didn't open and dust 3 [[blackhowl gunspire]].

I actually like Standard atm while being mainly a wild player because there is no Mill Deck to fuck you over like Mill rogue. I am only for Mill if it’s very hard to pull off, not some Spirit of the shark + Coldlight + Lab Recruiter bs.

Or just a deck full of 1 mana, cast a random spell for each spell that you've cast this game.

Control Warrior: 56.07
---
Big Spell Mage: 54.4
---
Control Mage 54.38
---
Highlander Mage: 53.58
---
Control Warrior is now 2nd best by winrate, still better than Highlander Mage (which isn't even the best mage deck)
---
People who doesn't care are detrimental to have good things
---
Alright then. I’ve never had to deal with that since I’be switched over to mainly just being a wild player
---
Might as well take it out with the arena buckets while we are removing features
---
Only gripe I have with this game has to do with the insane cost. And no, I dont think a digital card game is equivalent to a physical one so comparing this to the absurdness of MTG feels disingenuous to me. Spending money in a game that I love shouldn't feel bad. But whenever I pre-order or buy couple of packs with money, I always get bullshit and I feel terrible after that. For fucks sake, I want to spend money but blizzard isn't providing enough value in return.
---
So yeah, apart from stupid predatory economoy, the game is good
---
Lol I am opposite, not sure if I will ever play wild.
---
Oh. I just thought Blizzardy was just being more stingy than usual. Pretty disappointing either way. 
---
Very glad with my decision to literally never spend any more money on this game. Will keep playing until the poor dust returns and collection building rates mean I won't have enough for a competitive deck after a rotation.
---
Bryzgalov approves
---
This game has needed auto-squelch and an "ADHD Off" option for awhile now -- by the latter I mean being able to turn off seeing what my opponent highlights over.
---
Honestly, I thought I was crazy when I saw it just disappear, and then the same thing happened the same day when I logged into my second Hearthstone account.
---
It really wouldn't be anything for them to give a free pack or some gold as an apology.
---
I've been playing Marvel Puzzle Quest (which is also F2P) for years and if the servers are down for even 30 minutes or they screw up on the tiniest thing with an event, they just give everyone some free currency, because it's really just fictional money and doesn't cost them anything and gets them a lot of goodwill.
---
&gt;I mean I’ll emote a hello if someone is taking a long time or seems to have finished.
---
I also do this if an opponent is apparently doing nothing at all, not even hovering over anything, because I fear that I have been silently disconnecting again. Emoting during that time causes the game to reconnect. I only do that once per turn, though.
---
No.
---
Squelch.
---
Someone has probably posed or asked for this before, but just in case. Why can't Blizzard give us the characters form past adventures as playable "skins" for each class, like the heist? Maybe through some sort of new achievement system, that was mentionted 4 years ago and is still completelly ignored, or at least by just reaching a specific milestone of wins for each class. I feel like that would make the game much more interactive and fun to play. After all these are brand new 9 characters Blizzard made just for solo, and they literally have to put zero effort to make the game at least a bit more entertaining, so why not? (I for example would love to play as Rakanishu on ladder) 
---
Sorry for my grammar!
---
Where are you getting your stats from?
---
It should be there naturally until April. Check the web store, you have to "buy" the frozen throne, and kabolds adventures there now, they are free
---
I already went and downloaded them but Boomsday and Witchewood are nowhere to be found 😕
---
I bought them recently.when I returned. Maybe something to do with prepping for release of new adventure?
---
Best board clear of the set
---
V sad if so, also happy cake day!
---
I am not trying to be rude but can I ask you a non-related question? I'm assuming you're male, do you ever get sexual urges? Like, any activity/warmth down south?
---
So we all got just the one special quest?
---
Gravity is a harness
---
yes
---
I agree, but also find it exceedingly unlikely they would offer refunds on all overkill cards. Probably they would cop out by citing Linecracker as the problem and only offering a refund for that, even though it would technically be a nerf to all overkill cards for fringe cases like Mass Hysteria.
---
There is also the problem that certain cards at the bottom of every bucket go unpicked like fireball, which gets bucketed with insane cards.
---
* Dr. Boom changed to "Give all Mechs in your hand Rush".

* Pocket Galaxy back to 7 mana.

* Conjurers Calling to 5 mana.

Stars are hydrogen+helium, farts are methane+other stuff that isn't H or He.
---
The E.V.I.L. classes ARE the controll decks. Paladin on the other hand has a fluid identity, so it would be the perfect class for mill support.
---
I just hope you are not playing control warrior. Disabled or not, you would totally deserve the hate.
---
I have been playing this deck a lot in the past week. I have found it is amazing late game against almost every deck with the exception of miracle decks. It struggles against fast rush decks but if you can make it to turn 5 and blizzard the crap out of everything, you can usually dominate the board and take the win. Thanks for sharing!
---
Id pay $100 for an alternate coin art that was just a middle finger.
---
What makes more sense for blizzard: charging more or less?
---
And with gold!
---
[removed]
---
I appreciate this
---
Oh right I see, thanks.
---
Yea that's surely unintended, Overkill is proactive not reactive.
---
No we don’t.
---
&gt;High Exarch Turalyon is broken. Start of game effects are very powerful inherently, so you need a meaningful restriction to subdue them. This isnt one of them. Hell with Zephrys Im not even sure it is a restriction that matters at all. 
---
I think you're overblowing it a bit. At baseline, he turns the paladin hero power into a bad mage one. Obviously you give any sort of buff effect rush too, but I don't think that's serious enough that it's broken. I think it's decently balanced given the restriction.
---
It's not about being efficient, it's about sending a message. You show that roping isn't bothering you. I have never been roped more than 2 or 3 turns when I counter rope.
---
Reddit moderators and giant egos, name a more iconic duo
---
What do you mean? Warrior has this great hero portrait called Dr boom! /s
---
In a vacuum the current meta is great, but it all feels like a repeat of the past without any significant new features or innovative mechanics in the set. And that's only aggravated by the cost.
---
OF OF
---
Might've run to the bathroom or gotten a glass of water or something.  Turn 1 has a shorter rope timer anyway.
---
MTG:A absolutely isn't a better economy than HS. Half the MTG sets are filler, and craftables are very sparse. If you want to play anything that isn't mono, you're looking at grinding 20 rares a deck. Which is incredibly slow.
---
Actually not so bad idea but commons ruin it
---
because there is no incentive for a market leader to make any sort of changes whatsoever. the fact is that shadowverse has been around several years and they are not the market leader or anywhere near, while hs is, which means hs is doing it right and shadowverse isn't, in a twisted kind of way.
---
As sad as this might be, but I wish we can actually change the attitude of gamers
---
I don't see this happening anytime soon man, just try to ignore them all, maybe mute them and don't respond to friend requests.
---
A similar issue happened to me just now, but instead of involving 0 attack minions, I believe the bug I ran into is related to Dark Pharaoh Tekahn buffs on lackeys. I had 14 attack on board able to hit face (6 from a normal minion + 8 from two buffed 4/4 lackeys) and the opponent had 21 health. I played Zephrys with four mana saved for afterword. It should have given me Savage Roar (+8 attack = 22 total) for immediate lethal but instead gave me Defender of Argus, Pyroblast, and Shadowflame. Turn 16 here if you'd like to see the replay: https://hsreplay.net/replay/dfFhVoH6tqnN6kKQkk5cjY
---
Isn't that only 2 though?
---
Your friend work in Blizzard?
---
Can I get the next day?
---
There was a) Every minion cast a random spell (cost doesn’t matter)  
---
b) Every spell summons a minion of the same cost  
---
and c) Every minion adds a spell of the same cost to your hand, it costs 0, also your deck is constructed instead of random
---
Infinite dust loop whenever they nerf a card. Repeatedly craft and disenchant any nerfed card to earn unlimited dust.
---
Manual squelching costs time, especially considering the first turns are shorter.
---
Why?  Then you're just being patronizing.  The opponent isn't saying it was a good game, they're just saying gg.
---
What does it have to do then to survive ? Its an old game it makes sense people will eventually get bored of it if its more of the same,and new mechanics just enable more creative freedom to devs.And as I explained more cards could become viable.
---
Does your friend work in Blizzard?
---
The game still has a lot of the depth it would if it was PC exclusive. I’m sure there were ways they had to cut back things for casual players, but I’m pretty sure they would have done those things anyways. A new player on PC would be quite overwhelmed if there were no pro-casual features. It would hinder the game’s growth if that were to happen

Mage also has no good board clears and it’s difficult for them to get on board. Freezes by themselves don’t do much, you need minions on board to go face with to capitalize on it. And yes despite mage’s high rolls with conj and pocket galaxy, it is still very difficult for them to be on board. As someone who played a decent bit of mage, freezes are mostly used from behind constantly stalling until you can either get a swing turn with conj or get to puzzle box to address the board. Literally freezing the board turn after turn and praying for a top deck.  
---
The only deck where I felt like freeze absolutely had an unfair effect on them was quest paladin. They don’t have any way to react if their minions are frozen except to taunt up so you kind of have your way with them. Especially because they are slow and let you get the board.   
---
But vs aggro decks freeze is a stalling and reactive play. And control doesn’t have a problem answering threats from hand so freezing their minions is pretty irrelevant. What deck were you playing that the mage stuck an 8 mana 5/5 and a 3 mana 2/3 for multiple turns and went face? It could be a problem with your deck or you’re playing a deck that is more susceptible to freeze than normal.
---
note when I say or define power level I don't just see the card in vacuum I also see all the cards around it and so that would mean the card power level may change when new expansions come out but that's a problem in itself I feel they should print cards with their support cards in the same expansion.
---
When the only possible counter play to something is playing an extreme aggro deck its not fun to play against, see crystal core
---
You mean like the way it was obvious before this launch that Elise and Sir Finlay were the best Highlander Class Legendaries, but that Bomb Warrior's existence would make all Highlander decks non-viable so they were all rubbish?
---
You could but I don't have it and I think if you have Storm Bringer you slightly dilute your pool of tutored spells and in most situations where you could play Storm Bringer, you usually can play Bloodlust and achieve potentially game-ending damage.
---
I'm glad they agree that it's an overrated Taylor Swift album, but this seems heavy-handed.
---
Possible otherwise this thread wouldn't exist. Those people are in the extreme minority though.
---
Arena for new players? That won't work unless you are good in Arena. Most likely you are going to end up below 5 wins, which is a bad investment imo
---
I saw a few on the climb from 15-5, not so much now.  I imagine they do quite well vs. a slow deck like big priest, which is rampant at lower levels of ladder.
---
what no it was obvious to me reno and Brann were best I heard the same from various streamers too thijs, trump etc etc and bomb warrior doest counter them but its not prevalent in meta so...
---
I dont know, i dont feel like i did. But i dont get why the msg wont go away even if i did press pay money option.
---
Blizzard please rotate Reno to classic so I can discover a Reno
---
I hope they nerf it so it does give good options but not best.
---
Good point. I suggest arena for new players who grasp the game fast.
---
I think it’s better if they’ve ever reached rank 20 in wild they can purchase. A lot of people don’t play Ranked that much, so to have to climb every month to purchase packs would be annoying.
---
How about we let the cards be clear and easy to understand and stop obsessing over minor things that nobody cares about.
---
Going to disagree entirely.  It offers insane tempo compared to those if it lands
---
Rattlemancer and Wagtoggle have 1-star design. They're interesting concepts but will never be added to the game due to limitations. The Hive is also flavorful but very OP. Turalyon is nice but we're really sick of both many dudes and little dudes with rush and this card combines those concepts (although in a relatively balanced manner. If you get Finley on 2 and get the paladin hero power it's broken, otherwise it's useless. Eh.
---
There were better cards this week. Admittedly some of these are also kind of cool.
---
Props to the creators of all the cards though!
---
yes it's about getting that 1 win for the pack, if i have to play 15 games just to get it its stupid
---
In standard, you could play 4 coldlights with shuffling+shadows. With their regular draw, that's 45 damage from 9 draws
---
It's a strong tool but at seven mana, he's rarely been good enough to dramatically change the course of the game since Control decks tend to want answers earlier in the matchup.
---
I think the most times I've seen him used are in decks revolving around FLJ including right now in some Wild Reno Mage decks since you can get a quasi-Reno heal from Geddon.
---
It would be a LOT of animation work for no profit in return, especially if they wanted the animations to be good enough to where everyone doesn’t whine about them.
---
That aside, while an animated card game is probably something many people would be interested in, hearthstone’s current art style and animation are very charming and fit together perfectly, and I think 3d animation would make it lose its charm.
---
I bet nobody is working on the UI. The only new thing they added in 5 years is the indicator for your collection that shows up if your deck isn’t complete and... and that’s pretty much it.
---
IMHO the UI was wrote long ago and the guys who did it left already. But it works. So they don’t touch it too much and they prefer to focus on printing cards than offering a more modern experience.
---
1989 is banned in other games too not just HS 
---
its a form of censorship to appease the overlords in china :)
---
&gt; clearly they have never done a good job at balancing all classes
---
Very subjective opinion. I think they've done a pretty good job, considering that in pretty much every expansion, at least 7/9 classes are competitively viable. It's fine if you disagree, but maybe you're setting up unrealistic expectations. 
---
&gt; what's the point of realase cards like Anka The buried with out proper support
---
It normally takes a couple of expansions for some cards to receive enough support. I think that's fine. Not every card or class has to be powerful all the time. Also, there were people who predicted that this card would be really good. It may still be very good, but we may not ever realise it because it might be very hard to find the right build or to play it optimally. Or maybe it was never meant to be competitive, but a card designed for the more casual players. Not all cards are designed to be good because "good" cards don't appeal to all players. Some people prefer playing with "bad" cards to see how "good" they can make it. 
---
I've kinda lost track of the original point, so I apologize if I've strayed quite far from it. That's why I love talking about hearthstone; there's so much to discuss, even if we don't agree.
---
More stats -  [https://escharts.com/tournaments/hs/masters-tour-2019-seoul](https://escharts.com/tournaments/hs/masters-tour-2019-seoul)
---
Yeah, 70% were mages and warriors.
---
The deck also shits on board based aggro like Murloc Shaman and Token Druid.
---
Oh no you couldnt win because you relied on one card giving it to you /s
---
I'd enjoy it a lot more than Brawliseum again.
---
plzz u are making mistake here don't look at cards in vacuum that will never give u the true power-level of a card try a to also look for support cards before deciding power-level or else its all moot
---
if you played even decent amount it has been really easy to get the new heroes/skins. Hots it has been really easy to get the new heroes.
---
I agree. Sometimes I add people whether I win or lose because I want to know what deck they were using or just be friendly and have a conversation. I usually never get added lol
---
Mummy Paladin shits on warrior ... but isn’t that great against the rest of the meta decks
---
And it's still trash.
---
Ok, since this was down voted, let me explain with more detail.
---
The OP has expressed that (s)he:
---
* Is almost fully paralyzed
---
* Plays the game using his/her eyes, which
---
* Is unwieldy, and
---
* Takes a while to make a move.
---
Please understand that the act of just (manually) **squelching someone at the start of the game is just as unwieldy and also takes a while**. Considering the first turns are shorter too, I would expect it's not preferred!
---
Lol if it were 5$ a pop I would’ve already bought all three and one for my wife. But since they’re 10$ I haven’t bought even one.
---
If I play this card with Brann Bronzebeard on the board, swapping a random card is far, far different from swapping the top card of the deck.
---
In the first case, I could end up with two of my opponent's cards, one of my opponent's cards, or none of my opponent's cards at random positions in my deck. In the second, I end up with my deck exactly as it was.
---
This is not an uncommon situation - you don't even need to play Brann, you can just play two of the card back-to-back. The difference between the effects is massive. Even just the fact that I know the next card I draw will not be one I put in my deck is very important.
---
Suck my thicc hogger?
---
Only basic and classic
---
You need to spend enough mana to FORCE him to give you a silence. Play Barista, then Zephrys and you have 0 mana left. He will offer you a silence in this case.
---
Yes, snowbally 1 drops are bad but there should be more aggressive options, for example, leper gnome was fine.
---
Game does begin with 1 mana afterall and if you don't provide the options to start aggressively, cards like luna's pocket galaxy will creep in and dominate instead. It was the same situation when cubelocks can sit back and play a 5 mana 0/3 weapon. (well, at least that is counterable with oozes, unlike luna's)
---
I feel like Zephrys is going to become the next big issue, after folks stop focusing on Warrior. Both games against DeadDraw, Fel wouldn't have won if it didn't consistently hand him a Tirion. *twice* in the second game.
---
People will love this card until they hate it. There's only so long folks are going to be on the side of a card that just hands their opponents win conditions from *other classes.*
---
What on earth do you people do with your cards, gold, and dust that you can’t build the decks you need for free much less with “fifty dollars a month?”
---
There’s no reason you should need to spend money on the game at all if you’re not taking long breaks. You absolutely must be doing something wrong with your resources to be in the situation you’re in if you’re aren’t exaggerating that as well.
---
No
---
Georgec might be who you’re thinking of: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/54aqpw/georgec_when_asked_how_he_made_it_again_to_the/
---
Exactly a lot of these people want the game to be full of bad cards
---
wait what counterplay does dr boom have
---
You're ignoring his point which is that the deck has a terrible winrate against aggro decks.
---
The sad truth is Team 5 is full of hacks, and Actibli$$ are just milking the hearthstone whales with minimum effort
---
Zephy only looks at the board, not hands
---
You're right, it's not fun. If you look at the stats, there are surprisingly few murloc palllies on ladder. Probably because the results are so polarizing.
---
Unrelated, but i really enjoy the hunter decks that are being played, especially highlander. They're very consistent, and take alot of skill to play, both when playing as it but also against it.
---
That was Georgec. Source:
---
That doesn’t make the card interactive and only majorly loses to burn based decks like hunter.
---
Thats why i usually wait like an hour before accepting friens request they usually forget who you are and become chill by that time
---
Let's remove dust refund for him while we're at it.
---
Reno decks were running with duplicates in the beginning. I don’t see a point to add a deck building restriction like this, the “real” highlander decks are running one offs anyways and in duplicate decks the cards are often dead in hand. When there will be more cards released then it will be easier to build a highlander deck for a lot of classes.
---
Is the chance of silence in this scenario 100%?
---
I don’t mind people taking a while to take turns at all if it’s obvious they’re doing something! Ignore those people being upset and keep doing you, most of the higher up ranks have long turns because they get complicated anyway!
---
It’s only when I’m sitting there and not a single movement is being made that tilts me. Like if they aren’t highlighting anything and are just sitting there in silence I go craaaazzzzyyy
---
Yeah it's funny that people complain about Singleton op cards, but no one seems to see the problem in a card giving you the perfect answer every single time. When they nerf mage and warrior, zephrys will be the new Target
---
Why couldn’t a hot fox be released when iOS devices were crashing on start up during RoS announcement to launch? 
---
More then 1000s of players couldn’t play for a month. We couldn’t earn coins for RoS or anything, and it took you guys 3 whole weeks to even come out with a statement, to acknowledge the fact that it was even going on.
---
This is probably the best course of action. I'll take your advice for next time.
---
If they literally make a different tab dedicated to wild packs, then you would need to be exceptionally dense to buy the wrong packs.
---
He sacrifices his armor up for his rotating hero power which can low roll and he can not get armor up. I’m not saying that dr boom is interactive but he’s slightly more interactive then Luna’s pocket galaxy
---
I think if it was generally about PG, there would be other cards you target first. There was a distinct focus on showing human skeletons and inner organs which is especially frowned upon in asia
---
All I'm saying is that early on as a newer player unless you got a founders pack it was a lot of play to pick up all the heroes and the new heroes introduced were pretty pricey for a moba. (Thrall was 9.99 when they dropped him in and)
---
Atleast there was an argument to be made about the abilities, animation, character model and voice lines compared to the HS portraits.
---
Change my View: It would do Blizzard well to bundle these with Classic packs. I would buy all three heroes right now for 30$ if I also got 30 Classic packs.
---
Doubt they’ll compensate you, 
---
They didn’t compensate the 1000s if users who couldnt Play the game from RoS announcement to launch.
---
Portraits from old preorders should just become available in the shop for 5$ when the set they came out with rotates. That solves the exclusivity problem, so they can still sell them in preorders and it solves to lack of options and price for players that want the portrait but can’t justify spending 80$ just to get a picture. Win-Win.
---
Reno mage is one of the top decks in wild currently. If you still have reno/kazakus and enjoy wild, I would 100% craft them.
---
MTG ones don't even have any voice lines.
---
Hearthstone is competing with MTG Arena. It's a valid comparison.
---
Meme or not, yogg was a problem in competitive. Saying "Well i slotted yogg just in case i was losing" would have been the same.
---
&gt;Aggro Shaman also beats it. Druid with Doomsayers beats it. Mage with Polymorph beats it.
---
None of these are real decks. 
---
&gt;Control Shaman dumpsters it (needs warrior to be nerfed though).
---
That's why priest has a 62% win rate against it. Huh. 
---
&gt;
---
Fun is in the eye of the beholder though
---
Didnt know hard facts could be interpreted any other way. Move aside. The antivaxxer is here to tell us all about how facts are wrong.
---
It's not that it has a bearing on win rate that's outrageous it's that saying something like "all I had to do was play yogg" is 100% untrue. Also it got nerfed because of the incessant bitching and moaning from this subreddit
---
"Destroy all enemy minions. Then you die."
---
I want Turalyon, complain about Baku all you will but anything that makes Odd Paladin more interesting is a good thing even if it also makes it more powerful, right now the deck is a not a huge problem and it would become so much more fun as Highlander. In fact, ANYTHING gets more fun and interesting if you add Zephrys.
---
It's hardly a grind. It happens passively while you play the game that you opened.
---
yeah not happening run away from the game while u can these guys are all wimpy bastards
---
Are you talking about heroic or normal?
---
I agree with Eternium Rover being tuned. Undebatably the best 1 drop in Standard, given to a class with very little competition for 1 drops to begin with, and which used to have a weakness of early board pressure (post Fiery War Axe nerf).
---
Vive la France 🇫🇷
---
Upvote cuz Reno
---
We say North Korea isn't really democratic because democracy refers to a specific set of procedures that you either bother following or don't, and from what we can tell, North Korea doesn't.
---
Communism on the other hand is just a term for a belief system, not a specific set of actions. Whether a place is Communist thus a rather different question.
---
The argument for why they're not Communist normally goes that because Mao Zedong opened the country to trade with the United States et al. the country now has widespread commerce and by this fact alone must be considered non-Communist. But they'd have argued that using the capitalist system to build their economy was all part of the plan, that it was just a phase they were going through, and they were, meanwhile, ensuring they remained in power, so that when the time is right they'll be in a position to put things back on track.
---
Whether you think that's a good way of viewing it, from their Communist perspective, or whether you want to say they're lying and don't really believe in Communism anymore, it is nonetheless not so much of a stretch to say that if a country is ruled by a party that still insists on calling itself Communist and which still teaches and celebrates old Communist figures and ideas, we can fairly label it a Communist country.
---
Bro this sub is a literal cesspool of Blizzard hate...
---
&gt; They got scared by OP 1 drops and stopped printing them. What's the most aggressive 1 drop these days? Flame imp
---
And what 1 drop was more aggressive than Flame imp "not these days"? Unnerfed Undertaker during times when Earth was still flat?
---
Saying aggro decks are bad is just silly, especially since Murlock Paladin is the highest win rate deck in the game as of today.
---
Why in the world do people accept friend requests after they get emoted and roped. I never accept friend requests because this is not a team game and I'm honestly not playing to make friends, but I guess I understand some people like to.... BUT if: 
---
 
---
1) you got insanely lucky with rng.
---
2) got emoted and roped.
---
Or 3) you emoted and roped.
---
Then the friend request is obviously your opponent wanting to trashtalk you.   
---
  
---
Now on the main topic I have very little to say, I'm sorry this happens to you but you should probably squelch every game. Your opponents probably think you are roping, or they're actual assholes but nothing is going to change that.
---
Plenty of cards get nerfed in Standard that don't see any play in Wild. The point of the Standard format is to "keep things fresh", and seeing the same cards and classes for a full two years is not accomplishing that goal
---
It's not the silence mechanic; it's the fact that he can't see your hand. Zephrys had no clue OP wanted to copy the board. Had OP played barista and then zephrys again, it would give silence
---
Isn't the timezone a problem to most of LA and NA? 
---
Here in Arg it was pretty late and I was usually out with friends, so I didn't even watch a whole 3 hours
---
Where the fuck are you getting the 62% number when HS replay is not tracking control shaman at all and VS barely has the data for the new expansion (and they admit as much in their most recent writeup).
---
Quest Druid with Doomsayer IS a deck and is the type of adjusting for the meta that you like to see.
---
Aside from the first 4 you listed the rest don’t make any sense.
---
Just discard, baby discard
---
Eshaton#1359 NA gold trade, will show and go, quick
---
Those decks STILL need to run spell heavy to charge up high so there is obviously a greater strategy at play than just slamming yogg down whenever wherever
---
''We also made it affect the spells to make players feel rewarded even if they didn't draw a minion''
---
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Master Boom?
---
Malygos, Leeroy, and Preparation are nowhere near immune to Hall of Faming. They are 100% Hall of Fame candidates, and could easily go out within the next, say, 3 years.
---
A nerfed card does not make it un-HoFable.
---
I’d call Murloc Paladin an aggro deck though, and it’s the best aggro deck *and* the best Paladin deck in Standard now...
---
Wonder how to get a game to work with these?
---
So for rng you would use dice. Discover could just be top three cards of a pre selected deck.
---
You would need to keep track on hp and attack somehow. Seems a lot of work, I would just neatly cut around the edges and maybe a glossy finish.
---
This list is literally just a list of good cards. Very few of these are actually HoF-able, and even then you can just nerf or rework the expansion cards. No need to ruin the classic/basic sets anymore than they already have.
---
I occasionally get friend requests from people and they usually just wanna do an 80 gold quest lol. I also insta accept and add people who use unique and creative decks!
---
Anyone notice the pre nerf equality
---
Lol
---
80g EU quest ZombieSan#2798, i show and you go first
---
I swear, drunk me continually undoes all of the good I've earned up. Go a whole expansion just using dust and being careful about what I craft? "Ugh fuck this I wanna open 40 packs" *BUY*
---
im not
---
I mean, surely someone wouldn't go to all that trouble to use an an abbreviation for five letters, right? 13 letters is obviously more.
---
You know the pros have to give decklists. So each player know what’s in the decks as well.
---
Hm resorting to namecalling already because you can’t defend your shit position anymore?
---
evenflow#2284 EU. Trading the 80g quest.
---
Not to mention poker doesn’t immediately end when you fail to draw the winning suits... you can fold and only lose a nominal fee. You can play to your opponents emotions and assumptions that is just not available in a game like hearthstone so you have to have cards that win the game or you lose.
---
Reno isn't that good of a card it's just an extra board clear. If you don't have it it doesn't mean you can't play the deck. Zephrys is why you okay highlander in mage reno is just nice. Meteorologist is pretty terrible but it will often do the exact same thing Reno does.
---
In the short term it will cost quite a bit of dust but in the long term i think it's worth it. Higher power level, much faster games, a lot of great cards that are used in many different decks and the price of keeping up with the meta following each expansion is way cheaper than standard.
---
That said, if you don't like the same few decks reigning over the meta for a long time or hate facing aggro decks then wild is not for you
---
Yes I'm sure they 100% do it thinking only in the money profits they will do.
---
How bad is idea to make two modes for arena - with buckets and  without?
---
I'd argue Boom is below the power level of recent non-classic/basic nerfs, and there are more pressing nerfs out there.
---
The card has been around for over a year and rotates in 8 months. I don't think it happens.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That is really awesome thanks for sharing :).
---
If Blizzard's balance team is remotely competent, LPG should be hit as well which will hurt the deck a lot. It should remain viable, but not top tier.
---
Then you don’t operate inside of oppressive regimes. Easy. 
---
What you never do is capitulate to an oppressive regime.
---
Lmao saying what user started the money discussion is now name-calling?
---
What is wrong with you?
---
Normal
---
That's a difference in degree, not kind. 
---
Card games inherently have a strong RNG-type component, as which particular cards you draw in a given game is random; skill at such games involves managing the randomness to give yourself the best chance to win.
---
HS dials that inherent randomness up several notches with many of its card effects, but that doesn't change the fundamental nature of card-based games as RNG-based.
---
Sorry you have to deal with that.  Some deck trackers have auto squelch and I personally never accept friend requests because I know a lot of it is going to just be BM.  This is another reason I personally never BM people because you don't know their situation.  Some people rope to be rude but others may be in your situation or have a slow wifi connection.
---
Also if you ever want look up "nohandsgamer" he also uses an eye track system and is a pro HS player.  Best of luck to you with your ALS and gaming.
---
That's like saying Mad Bomber is basically a 2 mana Dy-no-matic. Reno is even better than Zephrys. It instantly wins a bunch of matchups.
---
The top competitive players have very consistent results, so saying it's all about luck is a bit too crude. It plays a part, but it's not as overwhelming as you're trying to convey here.
---
My suggestion is to, first of all, add heroes from past events not marked as exclusive. Keep the price of 10 bucks a piece, but run sales. For example 50% off Magni for a suited event, be it the fire festival, a brawl or PVE release. 
---
Add the option to pay with gold too, preferably.
---
Just start playing magic at this point.
---
Doubtful. If Hearthstone was a physical game, building Control Warrior right now would cost hundreds of dollars to build versus the potentially nothing it costs now.
---
Actually and consistently making money, not just breaking even, with opening packs of physical card games is really only conceivable with MtG, a game with myriad issues in its economy (thousand dollar mana bases in eternal formats, hundred dollar bases in Standard, overly stingy reprint policy, the reserve list, etc.). Even then, few people are really able to do it.
---
Man I’ve never heard a post I relate to this much. Always start around R5 and have to choose between grinding to rank 1-2 or just enjoying myself from ranks 4-5. 
---
Sometimes I’ll play the same decks for playing to win and to have fun, but just change my mentality going into games. If I’m playing for fun I may have twitch on in the background and care less about the outcome, but more about the fun combos (I’ve been playing a lot of Quest Druid). Playing to win I’ll throw headphones on and really tune into the game. Feels like two different ballgames to me, but both are enjoyable in their own right.
---
&gt; First one is 2 weeks in.
---
No wonder arena has issues. Each arena season is only 2 months long. 2 weeks is 23% of that. So for nearly a quarter of the time arena can have massive imbalances. Screw *what* metric they use. What they need to do is make use of that metric *faster*.
---
It's not broken with Echo, the cost reduction is not static, it's a one time thing for all minions in the deck thus only the first copy of the Echo card is discounted, while the others would cost as much as the original.
---
Part of the imbalance seems to be intentional though. New cards are always incredibly overbucketed. They could just stop doing that.
---
delete ur mom she is polluting the earth
---
I didn't play before buckets but I used to be a main arena player and quit as it got to feel as redundant as ranked.  IDK if this is a good or bad choice but I am happy to give it a try and see if it re ignites my enjoyment for arena.  I am always happy to see blizz TRYING different things so long as they keep an eye on it - if it works awesome, if not they can revert it.
---
Just need everything and hall of fame all of the classic and basic set you feel slightly inconvenienced by while playing
---
It's better than most quest rewards TBH.
---
both cards are in standard
---
i probably should have been a little clearer in my original post. The emoting isn't really the problem, it's just part of a pattern of behavior. The roping is what really frustrates me, and I am baffled as to why someone would take time out of their day to curse someone out. I assure you I am not "triggered" HS is something I can still do that I enjoy. I just thought it might help to discuss it on a forum of fellow players.
---
Belgian too.
---
GanGtoni
---
sucking balls: Since date of birth
---
Nothing to see here
---
&gt;HS is not like this; we can both play the same card in the same way, and get different outcomes. 
---
Poker is literally like this.
---
I go all in with pocket Aces pre-flop, I flop an Ace and win a huge pot
---
You go all in with pocket Aces pre-flop, but the other guy hits a flush and you lose.
---
It's also (amusingly enough) 5 random cards in the middle of the table.  My 5 random cards made me win, your 5 random cards made you lose.
---
If you were trying to make a case of why HS isn't like Poker, you chose a *horrible* analogy.
---
This is really cool.. I know I would drop money on these cards easily. Great work man! Keep it up!
---
Immaioz#2491 EU. Looking to trade 80g quest, you go first.
---
fair enough, had 5 mana left. i get that he doesn't know the enemy has inner fire in his deck but a 2/17 taunt should at least give me a removal for that one.
---
They don’t even need to do that. If there’s a tab for wild, and the shop defaults to standard, then you have to click on the tab for wild to buy wild packs in the first place.
---
Do you have double copies or do you just avoid playing decide with shared cards?
---
I think it's a great idea. A buddy and I built a site to facilitate this. It needs some love right now, but we're working on it. I'll let you know when it's live again. www.draft-stone.com
---
sorry, salty control players whined mill decks out of the game, like they did with combo
---
How about we make it so this one card.. is two cards!
---
Honestly it would still be good even if it wasn't twin spell, it's so Op
---
I have been here but I got over it by setting my goals here is my thought process of how I evaluate what to do
---
1) do I wanna get legend??
---
if answer to this is no I don't care even if I am at rank 1 I have fallen from rank1 to rank 5 literally playing shitty home-brew decks with 20% chance of achieving the win con(there's no big reward to reach legend after all aside from the reward of reaching legend)
---
2)if answer of 1) is yes then Therese simply 2 things that I think of 
---
1)do I wanna reach legend with a particular deck or 2)reaching legend is my prirority
---
if answer is 1) I jam my deck with which I  wanna reach legend with.no matter what happens if I reach legend great or else whatever....(I die trying haha)
---
2)if answer is 2 then its a bit different story I will do whatever it takes to reach legend playing the tier 1 deck or playing the counter to tier 1 deck .and whenever I went with this mindset I always get legend and then stop playing due to complete burnout after that.(I have stop doing this but it may not be the same for you )
---
so choose wisely what u wanna do.
---
Mill decks are fine. If they become popular, then you just farm them with Aggro.
---
His french accent is rather thick. I bet majority of ppl on this sub still heard "I just play Boom" so they can keep their circlejerk alive and ignore the real problems of the game :^)
---
Fuck, beat me to it. Take the updoot.
---
Its because Mill isn't a super strong archtype. Its only successful against control. Aggro completely murders it and midrange often will pulverize it.  
---
There's really no excuse for it to not be maintained in standard.
---
Makes sense, if I could I'd ban all those spooky scary ske-le-tons too.
---
combo is my favorite archetype and I never had a problem with mill. I seriously hate how salty control players whined mill/combo decks out of standard, like nothing is allowed to be good against control.
---
This is exactly why I think Mill needs to be allowed to exist in standard. It is NOT a strong archtype. It can only do well against control and greedy decks.   
---
Aggro completely destroys it and midrange decks often pulverize it. There's no reason Mill can't exist and be kept alive in standard.
---
Aggro is just fine. The problem is the control/highroll decks are overturned, mage with Lunas and warrior with boom.
---
Only strong full aggro would help here. You can build a midrange deck right now and even beat control warrior but as long as a mage plays a card every 3 turns you're going to lose 100% of your games to them.
---
That's the most unique spelling of rogue that I've seen so far.
---
Go back in time to MSOG era and you'll understand. It might scar you for life.
---
the real sin of combo and mill is that those archetypes are good against control, and control players have run the whining meta since the game's inception
---
I better not catch you playing a deck that's ever been featured by another Hearthstone player.
---
That'd be unoriginal.
---
Yeah there's only two copies of every card, minus legendaries. This was planned, we we're thinking that it would make diverse decks and interesting games.
---
&gt; trying to educate some random dipshits free of charge.
---
And you honestly think that people are going to give you any consideration or passing thought by going about it like that?
---
Ran out of cards in hand and he nickle an dimed me to death lol
---
Hall of fame NOW!!!!

---
Springpaw turn 1 is a worse Boar
---
REEEEEE
---
Yeah, that's what boggles my mind. Also its only Control/Greedy players that hate Mill, since Mill demolishes them (And literally only them). Yet Its fine we have control and control is allowed to completely demolish aggro.  
---
The double standards is disgusting.
---
I play for fun, but I don't find it very fun to lose all the time, so I usually end up playing tier 2 or 3 decks (and yes I netdeck, because I am total garbage at making my own decks)
---
One more mana would probably give Cabal Shadow Priest guaranteed.
---
Zephrys is a predictable card but only if you work it right. You needed to have 4 mana left after zephrys to manipulate it into giving a good 4 mana card. I wonder if he gives those 3 cards 100% of the time in that situation.
---
Yeah I agree, they should nerf CW.
---
The meaning of life.
---
How is Mill bad for the game? It can only succeed against control/greedy decks. Aggro completely destroys Mill and midrange decks have a good chance of just brutalizing them to.
---
It depends on what you like. 
---
If you want variety, crazy decks, and a massive pool of commons to craft, then Wild (ranks 15-5) is for you. 
---
If you want to smash people with finely tuned decks over and over until your eyes bleed, then stick to standard.
---
to be fair he did give me 3 different mana cost cards so i don't think that's the best reason as to why he didn't give mass dispel
---
Dr. Boom, Mad Genius
---
10 mana
---
Replace your hero with Dr. Boom. Gain 7 armor. 70% increased chance to lose the game.
---
Now that's what I call balanced.
---
I can personally assure you its north of 4k at this point
---
The problem is that winning is a part of the fun, so if you lose because of bad playing, bad rng, bad decks or not enough dust to craft a meta deck, you will not have fun anymore.
---
Yeah. I don't get it. It had its draw backs. Oracle isn't something you EVER want to play into Aggro, because refueling their hand is going to cause you to die like 1-2 turns sooner.   
---
Guess we're only allowed to have tools against aggro decks, but no tools against control decks.
---
Why not? Secret Mage is one of the best decks to kill BPs
---
One thing you could do is start the season playing high tier decks, get to legend and then start playing meme decks. It’s what a lot of others do meaning you’d also get to play against more meme decks. Ranks 5-1 and high legend are the most competitive ranks in ladder. Once you get to low legend many people are just goofing around.
---
The only gameplan against mill deck as a control deck is to play your smallest cards and hope you don't burn anything important. That's not fun to me.
---
What other reason is there to ban it though?
---
Thanks to the free packs, otherwise, it would have been a 2k viewers max.
---
Romake #1738 - NA Trade 80g.  I'll show, you go.
---
GRAPHICALLY, he means tragically like Keeper of Secrets
---
lmao this is spot on
---
Lunas pocket Galaxy on 5, then you've got 1 mana: kalycegos, antonidas, and Alexstraza. Plus free giants.
---
It's pretty easy for them to drop Antonidas, create a couple fire balls, make another threat. Next turn play Alex and kill you from 30.
---
Isn't aggro priest the best deck in the game right now?
---
It was 1989 my thoughts were short my hair was long!
---
Your parents seem quite unreasonable, to put it lightly. If you’ve been blowing off homework and studying to play games then I understand why they might crack down on you like this. However, if you’re already doing well then I think they’re being ridiculous
---
Only if you consider rank 15 equal to Legend.
---
I don't really care for the art but "I'll never tell" &gt;&gt;&gt; "I know what you did"
---
CoNtRoL WaRrIoR NeEdS sO mUcH sKiLl To PlAy
---
Exactly. I think aggro is actually at the perfect place right now. You can also include the aggro shamen but that even doesn't plan to kill you until mid game. The worst thing is a game feeling out of reach from turn 2 and I'm glad they stopped that garbage no counter play nonsense.
---
I agree. My father holds me to high standards and my mom just straight up doesn’t trust video games at all - she is one of those people that reads all the mom blogs, etc. I wish I didn’t have to deal with it, but I do, so :/
---
You have a point, it would depend on whether rogue could run a viable control deck with mill as a win condition, pure mill like they have in wild would get roasted
---
treachery is in wild. I'm using forest guide in a token deck which a bunch of gifting cards. I honestly want to try to make it into a hand druid, but I lack a second mountain giant.
---
First time I have experienced this against me.
---
I still contend the Mage reward should've been a hero power where you craft a spell based on a narrow set of choices, similar to Kazakus but with significantly lower power level to compensate for the fact that it's a hero power. The reward being a Discover-less version of Primordial Glyph is IMO really boring and uncreative.
---
The submitter's comment is probably the main reason it got so high up.

WELL MET.

Boulderfist Ogre making an appearance in competetive HS in a recent specialist format deck list
---
Crystal Core. They nerfed it 3 freaking times.
---
Luna’s isn’t as problematic as boom or CC. Y’all are silly.
---
If you are still looking, request sent KnotSteve#1809
---
Just out of curiosity where do you see conj and mountain now. Cyclone mage isn't seen at all, most mage decks I've seen are highlander so that combo is pretty rare.
---
You would need to print a pool of every “basic” beast and then a pool of every beast in the second pool. You would the draw three random cards from pool 1, choose one, shuffle the other three back, draw other three random ones from pool 2 and do the same. Then you would put one card on the top of the other you just chose and act like they are a single card. Maybe use a paper clip to hold them together. Anyway, it’s definitely doable!
---
Wrong. It has two losing matchups in Highlander Hunter and Aggro Warrior and both are still at 45%. It's even or favored against anything else. So who is the retarded person now?
---

I’m dying too! sitting on so many undusted duplicates. I can barley handle this level of delayed gratification.
---
Did you watch live? The reruns don’t give packs.
---
Aggro more like Dang bro.
---
Bruh just print every single spell in the game, draw and cast one randomly, shuffle it back, repeat.
---
The guys at Omnislash disagree. And the guy that won this major tournament.
---
I'm gonna guess they're WAY better at hearthstone than you are.
---
Mechathun more like Mechaswoon
---
Honestly i love this, i play mtg strictly with paper because i have hearth for the phone. 
---
My only issue i have to ask is what do you do with rng based things? Like arcane missle or tome of yag (that 10 mana thing that casts 10 random spells) or with the hero power changes for dr. Boom
---
I bet yours is “Friday” ya jabroni.
---
 Mein Führer...! I can walk!
---
lolcasual
---
Netdecking and optimal play patterns. There is skill to playing HS, but we're also commenting in a thread about a very popular HS streamer saying that he won through sheer luck, so maybe this isn't the hill you want to die on?
---
wait i play on mute, they changed that? blizz is the idiots
---
The person that used it was a hunter, so I'm inclined to agree with it not being an intentional pick.
---
It still costs 1 mana.
---
For every three hours of watching the stream, you would earn one SoU pack.
---
This is a Warsong Commander level of nerf lol
---
I will gladly listen to you in good faith! But we both know that if you could have, you would have already done so.
---
Did you print hero powers and put them on an actual button? I feel like that would be so satisfying to press
---
And it isn't even technically in P&amp;R.
---
I don’t know if agro would have helped me in this situation, I had a 8/8 Edwin on turn 3, 2 evil misc. and a bunch of lackies. My hand was plenty agro. The fact is my minions were all frozen and I couldn’t trade at all.
---
Ah ok thank you
---
Those numbers are why i don’t like new Hearthstone. We should not be seeing these kind of numbers.
---
Discover isn't the only example; "add a random mage spell to your hand", or "summon a random minion", or Conjurer's Calling, or "destroy a random enemy minion"- there are tons of examples.
---
Myra can pick Mecha'thun! /S
---
Rogue and Warrior are pretty decent Zayle rolls iirc
---
Auctioneer could work. I'm toying with the idea of faceless manipulators
---
The deck is really inconsistent but it's more of sending a message than winning
---
LMAO I just imagined how Blizzard would deal with this.
---
12 mana 8/8 Elemental
---
Your charge minions have +1 attack LOL
---
Idk... in my opinion freeze is just really frustrating to play against, especially as someone who loves zoo decks. I just can’t play anything and it’s unfun.
---
Crazy story dude
---
I don’t get it.
---
Just like Naga Sea Witch before it.
---
Too weak, needs to deal 10 damage to a minion twice every turn from turn 10 onwards
---
If you can buy those new portraits for 9.99 no one would ever buy those super expensive pre-orders anymore.
---
I’m only missing.... three legendaries that rotate in 6 months.
---
Ok well I guess no hunter for me!
---
Slower, and with more.....intensity.
---
Smart man
---
Depends on the nerf.  They've also never nerfed a hero card, so it's possible they just nerf some of warrior's power plays instead.  For instance if Devestator wasn't a mech it's still a really good control warrior card, but you can only get 2 and they won't have rush.
---
I had a Faceless Lackey summon an EVIL Totem yesterday. THE VALUE.
---
For quest.
---
There's literally no difference in what you just described &amp; one person winning with pocket aces &amp; another player losing.
---
I feel this so much.
---
Personally I usually resort to playing casual when not at a ranked floor and I want to play janky decks, so I don't loose progress to the next ranked floor. On the other hand, casual is just as much filled with meta decks as ranked, so I don't really gain anything which usually leaves me with just playing to complete quests and nothing more. That is also the reason why I have only climbed one rank this season. I try to play more arena as a refreshment but I don't really feel that game mode because I am not a good arena player and can't go infinite which kinda feels bad, so sooner or later I have to play for quests to gain gold for the arena entey again. My HS experience atm is... Complicated you could say.
---
If it's still have rush, then yes.
---
I'd consider putting out Ancient and put in Barista if I was serious about a fast handlock like that.
---
wow, that's a lot of text. you have this odd insistence that your perception as a player matters in this conversation, could you quote me what in my original comment lead you to believe this? let's just jump to the root mistake here and skip the next dozen comments of clarifying terms to each other
---
Those arent mage cards
---
got any good hunter strategies you could share because my hunter game have been off recently with new cards comin in
---
I feel like a fair nerf for CC would just be that it summons two minions equal to the cost of what you summoned it for, vs it’s original base cost.
---
me too
---
Oh yeah I remember that
---
Grow some balls and tell them to screw off. Not like they can kick you out of the house. Am I right twitch chat?!?
---
I guess I just got desensitized to it after the casters made the same joke constantly.
---
And now that you have all that.. now what?
---
Also triggers even with \[Immortal Prelate\] as long as you summon Mecha'thun first, and basically any minion that returns to the deck on death, if you destroy both at the same time. Happened to me a few times playing Mecha'thun Warlock with Faceless Lackey summoning him and not being able to evolve it away or anything
---
now print all the combinations off deathstalker rexxar.
---
What sucks is that there is already a better neutral combo card in Mechathun. Every class has access to galvanizer and can make some sort of mechathun combo deck. Its basically dead until MT rotates. I’ve tried to make it work. When you get the combo off it isnt even a guarenteed win. While Malygos and Mechathun combos are guarenteed wins
---
Come back a few hours later and most comments are about how i wrote the word ruogue.
---
So they should only balance mage cards?
---
How are you gonna do buffs?
---
That's too dreamy dude...
---
Every control would love to play 4 premium one drops which can block aggro for 2 turns.
---
Same counter Justicar had for old CW.

Mechathun Warlock, Priest, Druid, and Warrior (maybe a stretch) were all viable archetypes last year, what are you talking about? Druid especially was top tier at one point.
---
"Discovered from O M E G A A S S E M B L Y"
---
Unless they tripled the number of cards to be closer to the size of expansions, grouped the cards in wings together in a way that made sense archetype or class-wise, and released them all at once I wouldn't want old Adventures back. It was nice being able to get staple cards for a set cost, but I don't think the pros outweighed the cons of expansions.
---
r/comedycemetary
---
Mage is one of my favorite classes the one sentence I particurly agree with is "it's not a good control class",because in my opinion mage is good class for tempo,burn or combo,this last part of its class identity makes it so that they also have the tools to play control,but those tools are bot designed to be specifically control and as a result they are not as good as good as some others designed this way.
---
Mountain Giant (and Sea Giant but that has way more counterplay and isn't as bad) and Pocket Galaxy are the reason that happens which is what "cheat out" means. Conj is obviously strong, but mana cheating is the major problem right now.
---
do you have a link because from what i see priest in general doesn't see any play compared to bomb warrior or mage decks so i am unsure how you can justify anything of what you are saying.
---
I feel like playing with the original set wouldnt be that hard
---
Not sure if you’ve heard but they are taking away the bucket system.
---
You can do what?!
---
I don't have barista :( but it's a little too expensive, 5 mana while i can get almost the same effect and slighlty better tempo with brewmaster looks a little better, but thank you for the advise
---
I dont think they're ever gonna print a 0 attack minion with no effect when on board.
---
Are you the guy at the party bragging when nobody is listening ?
---
Hearthstone is a pre-alpha mobile game. I think the devs know this game is shit, and has been shit for 4+ years.
---
Except in casual games wishes work exactly that way. Sideboards do not exist in casual kitchen table play, so you can literally choose any card from your binder.
---
That’s like just 3 full expansions.
---

---
Loving when people call blizz out
---
Never forget: "Is this an off-season april fools joke?"
---
Good enough reason to stop playing HS for me.
---
What's even more bizarre is the idea of someone playing Mortuary Machine. Surely, that must have appeared randomly, right?
---
They are still looking into Big Priest 2 years later. I've decided that some devs are big priest mains and that is the reason it hasn't been nerfed/changed. Because the wild community hates it
---
Crossfire nerf because of Patches.
---
No, it's literally the game that is broken/imbalanced
---
That's not true tho. In none of the 8 changed cards were any human skeletons or inner organs shown. Instead 4 were changed because they were too sexual and the other 4 because they showed flesh wounds, but no human skeletons or inner organs. The closest thing is headcrack because you can make out the shape of the skull, but 1 "maybe" out of 8 is far from a "distinct focus" imo.
---
Same, I used to rank up to 4-2 back before they had rank floors and I kept finding myself not having fun at all.
---
I took a break during Boomsday and now just play causal to complete quests and run random decks.
---
I had to get out of the mind set that I need to win and get into one where I just wanna have fun.
---
Don't get me wrong, I can get salty after queuing into Warrior or Mage over and over again but i learned to take a break at that point and come back later or the next day.
---
I saw a combo with khadgar plus piloted reaper, with a discounted antonidas and faceless.
---
Mage too, but reno mage and big spell.  Get all legendaries opening the packs, and crafted zephyrs.  Your account is in america server ? We can add each other and borrow our decks.
---
I fucking hope not.
---
Shield slam is fine. Sure Warrior's level of armor gain has been amped up making it easier to get shield slam off, but I think it's fine.
---
As for Brawl, it's practically a full clear but I think it is fair. You can play around it. Once the problem cards rotate, you realize Brawl and Shield Slam are not problem cards.
---
Im a simple man, i see a D4 on the background, i upvote.
---
I think the main issue is the minions costing only 1. They can play 3 huge/powerful minions in a turn and then still play multiple spells. I think the minions should cost 3. That way you build your deck about it (so you don't want small minions)
---
trying so hard
---
Says a person that doesn't play the game.
---
The hearthstone community could play poker and bitch about the power of the Ace card.
---
Wowza!
---
sorry
---
Sad part is they like swingy game-play since that makes youtube etc highlights. That's their goal. They don't really care about competitive game-play. I wish they just game us a game mode for those of us who do care about interactive and not swingy game-play
---
Your friend is 10/10

I will unleash my full fury on Reddit.  
---
It will be like a scene from Carnage in the Temple of the Damned.  
---
I might also quit.
---
The way Zephrys works is cool, innovative and all, but I still wish it would die in a fire after it made the opposing mage Mass Dispell my board full of Zilliaxed eggs (Switched to Quest Pala after facing 3 Control Warriors in a row with Whizbang. Faced no warriors after switching).
---
I don't think there should be a universal tech card such as this one. You didn't tech against secrets? Now you have to deal with the advantage they give your opponent. Or at least you would until last month. Instead, now Zephrys lets you tech on the fly by giving you a Flare or something you'd normally have no access to.
---
Lul
---
&gt; Warrior (maybe a stretch) 
---
Warrior was also fantastic for a while. It gave you an instant win in the mirror and allowed you to retain the majority of the control warrior she'll for other matchups.
---
did you write this 3 months ago and forget to post it? if you paid any attention to the meta last expansion cycle you'd know sea giant was standard in cyclone mage and won just as many games with conjurer's calling as mountain giant did. and in the current expansion cycle the most played mage archetype is highlander which is not even remotely reliant on mountain giant or sea giant to win games.
---
