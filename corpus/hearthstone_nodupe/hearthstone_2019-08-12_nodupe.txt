I'd argue that the game needs more win conditions.
---

---
Conjurers calling is an interesting card. It's a build around card. It MAKES the deck. Without this card at all there is no deck. I'd rather hearthstone has more interesting win conditions than less. I don't want every class to just have a tempo deck ...
---
---
---
Very good points, however I've played the deck alot and against it with other decks, I have to say alot of rng is happening in winning regardless and even if murloc paladin don't draw Prismatic Lens they still have a semi decent chance of winning (40ish percent maybe more maybe less by 5%) just by being so heavy in agro and they hard muligin for Lens so still average win rate is pretty high I'd say
---
It is on average molten reflection + full heal. You can consider twinspell as card draw. Card draw is 1.5 mana, molten is 4, with bundling the worth of this card is approximately 6, 5 if you want it to be a competitive card. This is not an opinion.
---
I'm not anywhere close to a reasonable rank with it (16) so it's probably not worth copying my list but I'll try and remember to put it up when I get home from work if you like.  
---
I think the main difference we have in lists is Witchwood Piper to make sure I can draw both Cultists. And I'm playing standard so no Pod, Vanish or Gang Up, which does make it a little more tricky I reckon. Would be keen to give it a try in wild.
---
Im having tons of fun with burgle quest rogue. Dont remember having such a good time since I quit in that medivh expansion.
---
I trust control warrior stuff is gonna get fixed. You people whine too much.
---
Or just hall of fame him. He's existed long enough.
---
Ye
---
Yeah that's why I'm asking
---
If Eternal had any name recognition whatsoever it would likely the second most played digital card game behind Hearthstone. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have the name of Warcraft, or Elder Scrolls, or Magic the Gathering, or *whatever else* attached to it in support. 
---
I enjoy Hearthstone, but I genuinely think Eternal is the better game. Along with working better at what it‚Äôs trying to do than any of the other ‚Äúbig brand‚Äù digital card games out there.
---
My problem is neither that I dont like to loose aginst this nor that I think it was to strong.
---
All I wanted to say is that attacking someones face for about 20 minutes without anything changing during that time just to find out if the game is won or lost or draw isnt a very good gaming experience for me. And an opponent starting to rope every turn in this situation doesnt make that better.
---
Yes, because if a deck is great against warrior, it will certainly lose against the other 8 classes. Lol @ you lower ranked scrubs, clueless about the game but luv to whine.
---
If you see a deck that is way more common than others, you will statically win more if you include cards that are better vs that deck. I know it's hard to think for yourself without copying net decks, but you can try.
---
Missing 12-14 cards for Highlander decks is not fun.
---
Yes, it's THE f2p legendary you'll just have to buy for 1600 dust or be the luckiest f2p player in the world to open it in your packs.
---
Rumor has it Gwent's going mobile at the end of the year. I'm gonna be playing both!!
---
probably druid quest + jade idols. Just full of that
---
Technically it is not the worst, nothing compares to how bad Warlock's quest is
---
No skill huh? I'm not saying the deck and it's spot in the meta is a good thing but definitely seems like there's skill expression there.
---
They need aggro league with all control cards banned, that's pretty much the only way I'd ever play again

The new model for single player is garbage.   It makes you waste money for a mini game rather than allowing you to grind gold to keep up.   Having a set be an adventure allowed a f2p player catch up with other sets.

It loves parties

Devs don‚Äôt care about wild so good luck üçÄ
---
You‚Äôre drunk. How come I haven‚Äôt opened my five thousand Millhouse Manastorms yet, even though I dust them every time?
---
RA RA RASPUTIN
---
Players have been saying that for years. I still recall saying that back in 2014/2015 when Ysera was one of the few cards that had custom cards associated with her and some people here said that wasn‚Äôt needed because people could just go online and find that information.
---
I‚Äôm just glad that it seems like the tide has turned and the overwhelming majority here are annoyed by how these elements are missing from the game.
---
I think it has to be "mana: odd" or something entirely too specific like that
---
Blizzard is lazy and won't put in the effort to update their game.
---
So he is supposed to always offer lethal but yet not know how individual minions work?
---
Wild is fine it's just big priest that Ru ms the fun
---
Lol, you still don't get it. When you are missing legendaries and epics, you can still craft a great deck if you actually take the time to learn how to deck build instead of copy / pasting decks all the time. Of course it won't be as efficient as if you owned all the cards. You newbs are ridiculously obsessed with copying pro decks without knowing how they work, and it's hilarious.
---
I expect the Paladin quest will be top 2 pretty soon. Some of the mech cards and the hero power synergy is pretty busted.
---
Depends. If you have limited budget and really care about just having the best deck. It's too early to be sure.  However ...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think Genie and Siamat are both safe crafts. Both neutral and super powerful. Also, Genie is great but you should probably craft a whole highlander deck as well (or murloc pally). Otherwise its unplayable.
---
Lastly, depends on goals. I have a lot of the cards. But if I was only to play one deck. I'd craft control rogue. Why? Because its the most random and the most fun. Will I win a lot? Probably less than most decks. Will it eventually get even worse? Maybe. But I don't care.
---
We'll shut up when this game is fucking playable.  
---
Us who are older to Hearthstone have seen it live long enough to become shit. It genuinely hurts.
---
This is still probably the biggest feature this game is honestly missing. The fact that I can craft a card, and actually have ZERO clue what it does is beyond me.
---
Considering how often Blizzard likes to talk about the new player experience, not being able to see what a quest reward is seems very backwards to that thinking
---
Same reason I quit long ago, I realized Hearthstone is a cycle that isn't going to change
---
&gt; New Expansion
---
&gt; Meta figured out within a few hours
---
&gt; Decks that are horrendously unfun to play against
---
&gt; Too much RNG
---
&gt; Matchups that are basically unwinnable
---
Reinstalled HS to give this expansion a try, uninstalled it the next day, this game is the same shit all the time and it's depressing
---
Oh yeah, it's reminiscent of the old heavy MR paladin that ran justicar, you just keep spitting out 2/2s.  Though eventually emperor wraps will run out of value, but it can definitely grind out control decks eventually.
---
The difference is the witcher 3 is a God awful game
---
Not the only thing I'll blame the devs for.
---
I played storm bringer on 3 minions and got 2 octosari... instant loss
---
I completely agree. I like cards that are built up throughout a game and serve as a win condition. Shudderwock being a good example. My favorite one that wasn‚Äôt good enough was Linessa.
---
CMs only exist to sell packs
---
Absolutely agree! I also stand by my opinion of expansions being far superior before the trend of unrestricted prereleases to streamers.  The meta is seemingly settled day 2 and the set becomes worse to me faster.
---
Of course that‚Äôs not the only problem and all it does is quicken the meta, but wow I‚Äôm not a fan.
---
Best mage deck?
---
Am I the only one that faced like 1 real conj mage the last 3 days? All I see is box mage / reno mage / quest druid / murloc paly and shaman / zoo warlock / dr control.
---
But tyrande, flavor text, and card iterations are the only things players *want* to hear about! /s
---
I got the Druid quest as my free Quest and I‚Äôve been enjoying it. It‚Äôs easy to imagine the deck could be a bit too slow once the best aggro decks are settled on, but, for now it‚Äôs been great.
---
The meta settles faster now that they do these streamer free beeies. 
---
It's a buzzkill
---
There are a million decks to play in wild though. Big Priest is popular at low ranks, but drops off significantly at higher levels. Cyclone mage is also quite good and sometimes annoying, but very counterable as well.
---
I can't speak for the standard meta but the wild meta probably has at least 5 tier 1 decks and 10 tier 2 decks at any given time. And within that huge pool you can absolutely find decks that specifically destroy the decks you hate to play against. Odd rogue is very good against both of the decks you've mentioned, by the way.
---
there is a whole explanation below and I wonder how you can miss that.
---
I reach rank 5 each month in either standard or wild. Last month it was wild, so my standard rank was 9. 
---
This month my standard rank was reset to 13, wild to 9. 
---
First day of SoU I made it from 13 to 5.
---
which part of it is confusing?
---
Day 6. You may go ahead and "Choose One" to your heart's content, Druid. The "one" I choose is _Highkeeper Ra_.
---
There's plenty! I'm always finishing turn 4-6 with 5 mana rush dudes, blink Fox, pick pocket, Hench clan burglar, Clever Disguise and Face Collector. Not a big fan of the cat as it produces neutral minions a lot.
---
Are you actually posting a cookie cutter big priest list as if it's unique and something to be proud of? LOL
---
I'd be amazed if that actually was their tactic. They're not cunning enough to go to such veiled lengths.
---
I always Threaten then Concede. Khadgar's is particularly funny. "Time for a lesson, insolent pup". Not so scary when you give up after saying it lol.
---
Think you should point your frustrations at game designers, not developers. Devs are just building the ideas put out by the designers and it tends to look/feel amazing. Game designers are missing their cues for what players want pretty badly though.
---
Dibs on posting this tomorrow!!!
---
But you only need to play for 7-14 minutes every two days to get 100g from daily quests.
---
It's a very powerful deck, it can out value anything and will never lose the long game. It just struggles against aggression and burn.
---
So you wouldn‚Äôt be just as fine with it not being nerfed at all?
---
As Reno would say: "*We're gonna be rich!*
---
Reno Jackson is a Blizzard executive, experiences may vary, conditions may apply.
---
Ever been to Oregon or Washington? Amazing tap water.
---
Which pack opening thread? Find me three people complaining about it.
---
I don't get it. As a Warrior I don't give the least bit of care if you pull one of those 4 or 5 cost minions. I am confused why you believe that those are important cards in the slightest
---
So far i really enjoy the expansion and havent encountered any problems, my deck is dia de los muertos and its such a fun deck to play and even better with the new cards! Easy to play and a lot of value so i still enjoy the game a lot and i don't spend real money and i havent encountered the same deck over and over again so far.
---
The one thing Artifact does better
---
If you think giant is the real problem here that's insane. I do think it was a mistake to print the 7/8 taunt as a way for these decks to stabilize but giant has been a staple in control/hand decks for years. Conjurer's is what pushed it to feeling broken.
---
OUT OF MY JUNGLE
---
Idk, the ever increasing control warrior is making my Mecha‚Äôthun rogue more viable which is fun
---
Heh, this happened to me once. But I also was playing rogue. So I got to copy the Nozaris too! I lost the game anyway
---
Because of consistency.  If playing a 1 cost giant means that the value of that giant on the board is now 1 then the same has to apply to all other cards under similar circumstances.  If a rogue plays an 4 mana minion and shadowsteps it then it's value goes to 2 in their hand, if they play that 2 mana minion again and shadowstep it then to be consistent with the changes you want they'd be shadowstepping a 2 mana card rather than it's original 4 mana value giving them a 0 mana minion in hand.  This is why when a minion is on the board it's cost defaults to it's base value, to avoid interactions like this.
---
Hearthstone doesn't do "implicit" because that leads to confusion, it's either stated on the card or it doesn't happen. they'd have to change every single card that can have this kind of interaction.
---
Okay, so:    
---
Helm of the Ancients on board. Use Tezzeret (I swear there's like at least 3 tezzies that turn artifacts into creatures, just pick one) to turn Helm into a creature. Spark Double comes into play, making a nonlegendary Helm. Helm your nonlegendary Spark Double Helm.     
---
Now, you can generate infinite helms. But why? So that you can use EVERY infinite superior use of helm before finally having a reason to copy chimney bois.  
---
Jank forever
---
Ah, good point - now that I zoom in on the pic, I see you‚Äôre just using a standard Big Priest package. So, did you get your board that big just by having the LK spell, over and over?
---
I assume this was just a for-fun game, then, yeah?
---
"Played fair" aka played a deck that wasn't conjurer mage or dr boom warrior.
---
" So you are trying to say that control warrior isn't an issue right now? "
---
The first post I saw when I checked your history. Circlejerker detected, hahaha.
---
I'm not saying that people won't get tired of the meta, especially Dr. Boom, calling etc. I'm saying that the annoyance of not being able to build the decks will wane significantly, that's all. It always does, I just think the contrast in feeling will be greater because right now it's quite hard to access a lot of the decks.
---
This is actually the most interest I've had in awhile which was surprising. But the cost is feeling worse and worse each expansion. I was going to skip the pre order but I had the Amazon coins. Next expansion I'm just using gold.
---
Hellfire. Brawl. Frost Nova + Doomsayer or just Frost Nova into Blizzard, Lightning Storm, etc. etc. there are so many board clears. 
---
Not to mention if you‚Äôre ahead on board, minion trades + Lackeys can clear. 
---
Look it‚Äôs a strong combo, but nothing to get all riled up about.
---
Look at the usernames.
---
Ikr 3 fucking packs only
---
Meh, I'm enjoying Highlander mage and puzzle box. Quest warlock is also a lot of fun.
---
All in all I'm satisfied with my purchase.
---
It was fixed during Rise of Shadows
---
Reduce the cost of overload cards so you can cast more of them in the same turn. i.e. far sight into Elemental Destruction would be 0 mana overload 5.
---
Hell yeah brother! That's what I wanted to hear!
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù to assert that, but if that were the case, why wouldn‚Äôt Blizzard do it? Are the people who handle Blizzard‚Äôs pricing for a living less knowledgeable about it than Reddit?
---
You'd think the kind of matchup where it's correct to toss the quest would be unfavorable so you'd still usually lose. Same kind of thing as pyroblast and other finishers having very high played winrates. It's weird that this does not seem to be the case for any quest.
---
He's not taking a weekend away from the internet. He's on twitter tweeting about the expansion. Ignoring reddit.
---
literally everyone I know. yes.
---
When I read ‚Äúkeep it‚Äù I interpreted that as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt play it‚Äù.
---
Then u have control warrior that even if u win .. u dont want to play anymore
---
Just wait until they find out their cards are drawn in a random order.
---
When I play quest shaman vs murloc paladain, I try to mulligan for Thunderhead, Voltaic Burst, and Lightning storm.... I realize it's harder to get that combo than to play Prismatic Lens but when it works it feels really good.
---
Generally speaking.    
---
   
---
If I have a question about setting up a Bluetooth speaker, doing a quick Google search about it before making a post should be more effecient for everyone

Such a childish idiot
---
How can played win rate and win rate be so different? I can‚Äôt imagine that many people mulliganing the quest in shaman or others
---
Do you play arena? Arena has enormous amounts of random cards but notice that people like kripp always end up on the top because they have great fundamental skills. At the end of the day those skills eclipse random RNG.
---
I love this game, but this would be a very nice addition to the user interface.
---
How can he trade against the death rattles?
---
It‚Äôs also 100% guaranteed that your priest opponent will have Barnes on 4 or 3 with coin

Happy cake day!
---
Dude no one wants your negativity fuck off
---
The fire festival this year was the worst won yet.
---
Opposite for me tbh, mostly because I am actually able to play a decent deck this time around (F2P) that has already allowed me to climb higher than I did last season.
---
That requires I craft wild cards. Sure, I'd enjoy it if I could afford it
---
Well said.
---
Cant wish for more wishes but you can wish for more genies
---
When my friends lose me they post my search history to Reddit
---
Better than 0 Saviors of Uldum packs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but yeah kinda shitty of blizzard to only give us 3 this time around.
---
A lot of these would actually make the game affordable and accessible. So it's unlikely they would, but I'm with ya.
---
I suspect you are right, and even if he were that high, he makes himself look like a prick, which is why he‚Äôs on a throwaway
---
As a F2P, nothing has changed.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm mishearing, but I swear Aldor Peacekeeper angrily tells ‚ÄúDAMN IT!‚Äù when he dies.
---
I dont take it that way. I am like you and just always use it, but i've also had people take it as BM.
---
I think people are just easily triggered sometimes and see everything as an attack.
---
Dusting your whole collection.....
---
Why would you do such a thing for 2 decks that‚Äôll be rotated out eventually
---
Decreasing cost does not necessarily decrease revenue and vice versa. Desirability is also a huge factor and maybe Blizzard constantly making their game more expensive is part of the reason for their decreasing sales. Blizzard giving less stuff away and making the game more expensive is a gut reaction to apease shareholders and prop up short term sales. It's counter productive and drives more people away when they most need them to stay.
---
It's short sighted in the extreme but they won't consider giving more away because most people react like you do. They dismiss any attempt to be more generous because they only see how they can force people to pay more rather than realizing they can entice more people to pay if they feel they're getting more for their money (or time!). No they want their money now and let their greed get in the way of actually allowing the game to be improved.
---
There exceptions specifically shadowstep and brewmaster
---
Why did you do that??
---
A majority of it is not. Sometimes when it's a post it is laid out well. Also just typing a lot of nonsense isn't a well laid out post, sometimes people put a wall of text that really means nothing.
---
Capitalism mother fucker, do you speak it?!
---
Just play the quest and find out!
---
How else would you get the sense of discovery and achievement of playing 6 battlecry minions? /s
---
In regard to your first point, I think that's due to Blizzard's insane policy of having one balance update per expansion. Any reasonable company would not have released Uldum while both archetypes remained untouched. Especially Warrior, it was pretty obvious that there'd be a public outcry if Dr. Boom was still in standard when Uldum launched.
---
I think the most reasonable solution to Dr Boom would be to move him to wild. Any other solution would either kill the card, or keep the archetype too dominant.
---
All of my suggested nerfs are about play experience as opposed to power level. I don't think any of these new decks are as strong as Tempo Rogue was, but they all feel terrible to play against.
---
That technology definitely does not exist
---
&gt; What make botting lucrative is that it double the gold intake per account.
---
The fact that a bot playing 24/7 *only* doubles the gold intake of an account says the system is a success, not a failure. Without the cap it would be closer to 5 times.
---
I did that cause I'm done with Hearthstone.
---
Okay
---
Imagine not playing wild lul. I'm done with Hearthstone, I'm trying to make a point of how p2w this game has become.
---
This one.
---
&gt; F2Ps will always find a way to progress, because they want to catch up to non-F2P. They *had* to get that 100G daily.
---
I don't think this is true. Honestly, I think the opposite is more likely. The people spending the time to reach the daily cap seem like the kind of people willing to drop money on the game.
---
And a lot of players don't even know the cap exists. I'd say the system is working for them. All the upside of fewer bots. No downside in sight.
---
Uninstall
---
I'm not surprised, majority of the cards in your collection are going to be worth &lt;50 dust per
---
But now you cant wish...
---
How am I suppose to try quest/highlander decks and other archetypes with only 18 deck slots ? Not even talking about wild. There should be a sub folder with 9 slots for each class.
---
The cap is not designed to be something you reach.
---
That was basically my winrate as well to legend. And the fact that it does well against warrior doesn't make it trash against other decks; it's just a good deck overall.
---
You double plot twist or you just can't use it before you die
---
Probably the best advise here
---
I do agree that a lot of the mechanics in the past couples of expansions were rehashing of basically already existing mechanics (druid quest=fandral effect). The last most interesting mechanics was discover imo. I have to say that despite that, this expansion has the most interesting/playable cards, zephrys. 
---
But I think to have hearthstone be a serious competitive game, not just a mobile casual game, it needs to take way more risks in terms of card design philosophy, more complex/experimental.
---
Well bye...
---
Lol, luv how you make random assumptions to try and validate your rebuttal. Small brain.
---
That's a short sighted way of looking at it. Getting people exited to actually play by rewarding them and making them feel like their money actually gets them something worthwhile is far more likely to boost sales in the long run than trying to force players to spend more and get less.
---
You sound nice
---
...No, because the card is only good because it costs 5 now. When it costed 7 it was awful; that's about when the haymakers start coming out and you're spending your turn doing nothing, hoping to get future value out of it. And the later you cast it, the less you get out of it. People won't just "keep using it because now they know how good it is" because adding 2 mana to it makes it \*not good.\*
---
Giggling Inventor was a bonkers card at 5 mana, when it got nerfed up to 7, everyone stopped playing it because \*it costing so much made the card bad.\* Mana cost is one of the key aspects to making a card good.
---
Hey HS is also on macOS!
---
Yep I'm loving it too. I'm not laddering in standard and am playing with all kinds of highlander decks  in casual wild.  Zephrys opens up a lot of deck options.
---
I don't know, this doesn't look like a joke post, though I will grant you the comparison is funny.
---
????
---
Same. Been playing since before TGT and I just can't make the decks I want. The decks I can make I am super lucky to have because my two legendaries were siamat and zephrys... I wasn't always this lucky though, when in frozen throne I got Runespear and Moorabi.
---
I don't want T1 decks, but the price seems to disincentivise anything other than a netdeck. You just know no one is gonna play warlock quest next expansion, so why bother?
---
&gt;Try Duel Links for a week
---
Because that's the maximum amount of time a person can enjoy it.
---
Most of that is trading, as well as so many mystery box like cosmetics. Neither of those are viable in hearthstone.
---
I truly didn‚Äôt expect a reply. My comment wasn‚Äôt rather thoughtful, I thought I was more or less shouting to the void. For your response, I greatly thank you. If I may ask you the questions I‚Äôve always wanted to, I would be interested to hear something new. 
---
With all due respect - and I do hold respect for you as your game is my favorite - It would be nice to hear non-boilerplate answers. 
---
What is frustrating, to me, is that hearing you speak on a number of different issues, it usually speaks only to issues of development. I would primarily like to hear your thoughts on the issues of rising costs in preorder bundles, the abundance of useless legendaries that clutter packs and collections, and the stale single player mode. 
---
Please feel free to look me up in your system, my Battletag matches my Reddit username. You‚Äôll see I‚Äôm a faithful player since the beginning. The amount of money I have offered up has dwindled and dwindled. I simply don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm getting my value.
---
Thank you
---
They havent "pleased anyone", I only just realised this after a very controversial post yesterday which really shows their arrogance.
---
Btw the team who works on HS is Completely different from WoW
---
Maybe once a month probably less, I have 1hour commute to and from work but cause of bad cellular I only play casual on the bus
---
While that may be true, it has a real new player experience for that period.
---
The point of that sentence is that there are other games Team 5 can get some ideas from.
---
So he‚Äôs asking about what the other poster thinks is engaging with HS in a way that‚Äôs ‚Äúproper‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt say what‚Äôs right or wrong. You sorta defensively responded as if he was attacking netdecking when he wanted to see if the other poster thought that was the ‚Äúproper‚Äù way to engage in HS.
---
https://i.imgur.com/dTcAHZc.jpg?fb
---
The expansion isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs the lack of care he devs have put into the game. 
---
No new QOL improvements in over 4 years.
---
Being f2p gets harder every year.
---
Failed promises.
---
Games just overall stale, and blizzard has been treating it like a cash cow.
---
You never open crates in TF2 if you know what you're doing. Players have been screaming about how they want new heroes, boards, card backs, just to have everything customizable. I'm not saying this is what blizzard should sell exclusively, but they can implement this while also actually trying to improve the game more than they are now.
---
I think Eternal is gonna take more and more Hearthstone players. 
---
I came back to HS for Dalaran Heist, but I beat on normal in a week. 
---
Once I beat it on Heroic I‚Äôm not gonna play standard...I dunno...
---
I love the new expansion, but I enjoy HS at it's core.
---
I'm having a lot of fun playing Tess thief Rogue with the lifesteal weapon instead of the new Quest. It seems like most people have gotten greedy and cut their weapon removal to make room for Uldum cards.
---
When ot comes to the packs yes. But cards like Loatheb and Medivh should be available by gold not only real money.
---
That's some good luck.
---
One solution that I think would keep the visual flourish of the animations while speeding things up could be if Bliz had it so that **simultaneous repeated** animations could be played simultaneously.
---
Seeing the lightning bolt at the bottom of Eternium Rover and Frothing Berserker glow only needs attention drawn to it once per turn for clarity's sake. After the first time the lightning bolts would still glow, but all animations would be played simultaneously, reducing the time consumed from 4 animations per Warpath to 4 on the first and 1 on subsequent Warpaths.
---
I've seen less the  1% rogues, which is nice because I feel like almost all metas had a rogue deck. I'm really disappointed with warlock that have been terrible lately. I don't have Luna and pocket, and the fact that will be in the next rotation  discourage me to craft it. I'm considering hunter cause I only miss brann right now
---
30+ packs, 1 legendary so far. Not many epics either.

They didn't ban him because of him pointing out text inconsistencies.

&gt; For example, when you resurrect a card, that card is no longer "in" your graveyard.
---
I don't care much about a viewable graveyard. This is what I want. Resurrect decks are way too snowbally right now. If you res a really good minion and it dies again you now have two of those minions in your res pool, making all future resurrects far more likely to be good. But if you resurrect a Barnes all your future resurrects become significantly worse. The lucky get luckier and the unlucky get unluckier. With a proper graveyard this wouldn't happen.
---
I'm mostly enjoying this expansion, but I still think people are sleeping on the Shaman Quest Hero Power. It's ridiculously powerful for how easy it is to complete.
---
People that complain the most tend to be the most invested. I used to feel that way. I gave up.
---
it existed before boom so why won't it exist without it ocrs rest of hero cards zuzlzin , HAGATHA has to be removed too
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
The technology isnt here yet.

---
Can't really call this change stealthy as it was a big part of the recent patch notes.
---
The biggest issue I have and I can sympathize with is the cost of new decks. I don't spend money on this game, so I grind my quests and gather everything Blizzard is ready to give to me so that I can buy 25-30 packs at the beginning of an expansion. Because I also don't play a lot. So here I am, with no new usable cards in the two tier 3 decks that I have. Which is why I shifted to wild some months ago. 
---
Regarding Control Warrior being OP.. well, that has always been the case, ppl complaining I mean. Before that, it was Conjurer's Mage, before that, OTK paladin, Odd Paladin, Even Shaman, Quest Rogue and, sometime ago, Priest stood amongst the OP OP with Raza and the Dragon Package. *Cries in priest and it's 45% winrate*
---
I am not feeling the same, i feel the game more then last year. I enjoy the different decks. I agree control warriors are a pain in the ass. With combo priest i defeated a lot, that makes the game even more fun.
---
I was referring to the situation in the comment I replied to; it's not something that happened to me. 
---
However, if you use very simple math, you'll realize that $200 of packs that are $2 each normally (or $1 each at pre-order) will be 100 packs, also known as the number of packs in the post I replied to. 
---
Using your exact provided numbers, it is very possible that the poster received their first 10 legendary, and then two other legendaries in 30-40 packs each; not reaching their fourth pity timer by the hundredth pack.
---
Im f2p. I only craft cards for mage. I do every daily quest, capitalize on dusting all nerfs from other classes, craft golden copies of whatever gets sent to HoF to then dust, and i still cant afford to craft every mage card this expansion. Lol.
---
shadowverse is better they just don't advertise or create fake hype as much there targeted audience is Japan any ways and its the most played cog there I am currently in process of deleting hearthstone from my life enuf is enuf
---
Byeeeeeee
---
Every 4-5 times a month but still some days I play a lot and the gold cap feels like it saying me to stop playing so I just stop
---

You got to see it to beleive it.
---
I had only 1500 dust f2p btw game sucks only whales can enjoy it nw since I stopped being whale an year ago the game is no more fun so not gonna play anyore
---
And that gamƒô was So much ahead of hs
---
Quest shaman is kinda in the middle,cause it's a fuckfest of RNG
---
Might be just a phrase to mean the center or source of a river, not necessarily an item; a place, or maybe even a feeling. 
---
Who knows?
---
Me too, playing quest rogue and completely stuck between rank 10-12 but at least I don‚Äôt get beaten by the same decks every time! Having way more fun than last expansion
---
But for example if you had deathrattles trigger twice passive would he know
---
True.
---
I'm just saying that giving them a good amount of the expansion, plus gold, will mean there's nothing to buy...
---
122 is unreasonable on their end, but I do think dust prices should be adjusted and there should be more free rewards, just not to this extent...
---
Over exaggerated af.
---
Restless mummy isnt best 4 drop, armegadillo isnt best 6 drop, tomb warden isnt best 8 drop.
---
What if you had deathrattles trigger twice passive
---
Its gotten to the point for me where over the years I've had to cut out classes completely just so I can continue to enjoy the game. I can admit I'm a casual player and will open a few packs a month from quests etc., but I'm also the audience the game seems to be aiming at. 
---
I'd honestly spend more money on packs if I could buy packs that had a better chance of giving me class cards either from the classic or the new sets or any non-wild set really. I'd also be more inclined to actually invest in the game if we could have picked what DK, quest, legendary spell we get as a login bonus at the start of the expansion. 
---
As you highlighted the exchange rate is crazy, its really disheartening logging in and getting something like the warrior quest when I disenchanted all my warrior cards last expansion just to try and make some fun, enjoyable decks.
---
Vulpera acts as a fourth discover option essentially if you‚Äôre fishing for a certain card.  You‚Äôll get another class spell that won‚Äôt be one of the original three.  So if you‚Äôre trying to find the odds of something specific you need to take that into account.
---
This is retarded. Instead of making a serious argument of a completely valid issue, you feel like you have to use a lie, and say that they have done nothing. When they have been churning out expansions. It's only harming your own argument
---
That fact that those control warriors are also stuck in 16 is sad itself.
---
Technically not an otk but you still win regardless.  
---
Linecracker druid.
---
And even then I love the new cards! But I don't love giants + conjurer's calling &amp; Dr Boom still being the top of the meta.
---
Where is the auto squelch button?
---
Can you get new cards in the buckets?
---
Yeah, let's hof every good card in the game. Just play ogres and yetis all day.
---
I'm not sure they even have the ability. They can do an account roll back but they rarely do those
---
So I do the same, but over the years the rate of exchange doesn't work out. I've slowly had to disenchant more classes just to make the decks I'd like to play. 
---
I can admit I'm a causal player who opens a few packs each week, but realistically I won't be playing the game in a year or so as I can't compete. Even budget, fun decks don't work out well with how much you have to disenchant to make them.
---
I think it's maybe the heart of that serpent that tried to lay eggs in virnaal
---
If I had one two wishes, one would be to free Blizzard from Activision, or maybe just use it to excise Activsion, Ubisoft, EA,  Take-Two Interactive, and NCsoft from our reality.
---
Second wish would be to bring back WWF Ice Cream Cookie Bars and La Choy Mini Eggrolls
---
You sound like an entitled child, honestly.
---
Even assuming I had enough dust to craft all the decks I want, which I don't, what I'm gonna face doesn't change no matter what I play. If I wanted to have the same matches over and over again I'd play singleplayer, at least there the decks are fun.
---
You could at least have explained what CCG actually means..
---
Fair enough, I think they could've done more and I'm hopeful they will/are doing more. This guy however says, and I quote ,there was " nothing new introduced since day 1." I'm simply saying they have done a lot. I didn't even mention a lot of things in my comment. Hyperbole or not this guy and so many like him are willing and ready to ignore any progress made so they can complain they didn't get exactly what they wanted. At the end of the day, its a video game. Play the decks you find fun. If they aren't tier 1 or 2 or even 3 decks, it doesn't matter, have fun. So, yeah, Blizz could've and maybe should've done more, but complaining that the game you can pretty easily play for free doesn't have every feature you could ever want and ignoring the good and awesome things they have done, I can't stress how much the arena was improved, is stupid and childish and needs to stop. We need real criticism not whining that you didn't get everything on your wishlist.
---
Wild is fun if you're deckbuilder at heart. So much potential to uncover. Wanna try my Aggro Reno Mage? Went 24-7 to rank 5 yesterday, beats everything but Big Priest (god I hate you Barnes). You can try teching in Polymorph: Boar if you're facing a lot of them.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the calculator affects the mystery choice which when looking for a specific card, is statistically the same as a fourth discover option.  In which case the odds for Vupera would be higher.
---
Dude, expansion has been out for a week. No way the meta is stale yet. If you don't wanna play, don't play and stop complaining.
---
&gt;HS has radically changed in its 5 year run.
---
Lol. If even people like Frodan and Kibler complain about a lack of development then you know Team 5 is doing poorly
---
I'm kind of okay with them not replying or saying anything, the sub is already annoying with complains. Can you even imagine what it would be if they started paying attention, it just would be a constant blizz plizz !
---
I opened the two worst ones yay.
---
Ah thats a shame
---
Even Magic Arena recently added a feature that shows the cards (tokens) generated by cards. Even though the text on MtG cards is extremely clear about the cards it generates.
---
That Hearthstone still doesn't do that is beyond embarassing.
---
Wait but you still die here.
---
Are those values supposed to be disenchantment values or something else?
---
The have not printed any charge minion for at least two years now I‚Äôm saying if they think charge is sooo op that they don‚Äôt want to print any card with it might as well change all charge to rush
---
You should wait until you are sure that the meta has settled.
---
How much it costs to craft a card is like what value hearthstone gives to each rarity.  So like the value of a legendary is 1600 dust
---
What are you ralking about, saying control warrior is not a top deck? It's currently the highest performing deck across all ranks and its only bad matchup seems to be quest paladin. I'd say that's a pretty good deck. It's very popular, but my streak of running into only CW still seems unlucky considering the numbers.
---
it will never give you espionage or the archmage when fatiguing tho.
---
1/1's from Sonja no longer become 4/4. That was what made the endgame of the deck work well.
---
Because casual and mobile. You can't make the game too complex, otherwise it will be too inaccessible. You can't introduce features that take too much space on the screen, otherwise it will be impossible play it on the phone
---
Best trailer song don't @me
---
I have a question here: I noticed you took out Questing Explorer. Personally I only run one copy of it b/c i think the card is a little awkward.
---
Question is, do you notice the lack of a 2/3 body in the early game against aggressive decks or is not noticeable?
---
Wait, is THAT why my search function was just not working for the  past years for me?
---
brann spawns king crush so technically, they want to keep up the keyword charge
---
You're right, i was just going off of the "free portion is completely fine" part
---
play unranked puzzle box: clears the board creates your board, draws mana gives live does damage to face
---
play ranked puzzle box: soularium, remove whatever minion you have, buff the opponents board, overdraw a million cards and myra's unstable element. Eat that opponent!
---
The real reason is probably you are a rank 1 player playing at rank 15. The data is showing highlander hunter is 60-40 favorable against control warrior.
---
Fuck you OP
---
I don't think it's right to compare Hearthstone packs and loot boxes from Overwatch, they are totally different things. In HS you need to open (a lot of) packs to have more chances of winning, more variety in terms of gameplay, "improving" in the game if you know what i mean
---
I've stopped playing because of this, adding more hard board clears did not help, but infinite rush means warrior doesn't need board clears, as there's no way to out tempo that anyway. So it's either play warrior and reach old age to gain one star, or play mage, and stop you opponent from playing the game. Great meta.
---
This is technically doable hmm :P.
---
Did you ever consider running the Tak + Scheme/Lab recruiter combo for a win condition against more aggro decks?
---
Ok bye!
---
It is seriously my most favorite deck, just be more greedy than the greedy ass warrior and you'll win, especially if you have a cutlass and they don't have weapon removal (or you bait out the weapon removal with the quest dagger).
---
Also, with resurrect being around how is there not an exile mechanic!?
---
You still browse a subreddit for a game you quit two years ago?
---
Sure!
---
Tinyfinish him! Hahahaha
---
I would if I had any intention of picking it up after pulling it off. I lost 10 games in a row before I got it, and dropped from rank 3 to 5. Worth it though.
---
I paid for the whole adventure with gold and did not receive Zayle. Was I supposed to?
---
&gt; This has always been the case
---
--
---
&gt; It's just catching up to more people now
---
I didn't say it wasn't always the case; I said it's now affecting more people than it has ever done before. I said this in very first sentence.
---
Turns out, people are now just choosing to quit out of all the other options.
---
im planning on crafting it as well, probably the best quest this expansion.
---
Please educate me
---
Yep, at hearthstones peak they prioritized overwatch and told HS to eff off and find it.
---
In August 2018 HS had average 50k viewers a day. This month it is just 32k and the expansion is not even a week old.
---
No problem man! Hope the very little we can do could help! Stay cool bro
---
Really? I don't think people are quitting now substantially more than before.
---
Same, I was only able to barely craft quest druid after nuking 2 of my old decks...sad
---
Back when I was working IT we pulled about a million dollars a year per employee. Salary was around a 100k. Just as a reference in the dope game I always made sure my employees made twice my profit. Which I thought was fair since I was pushing several times more weight. 
---
It is flabbergasting that drug dealers, who are portrayed as the evil villains, have so much higher morals than your average "legit" business owner XD
---
Yes you have some incentive to do right by people when you know there are consequences. It does beg the question. Why are there no consequences in the law abiding part of the world??? If blizzard was a drug dealer nobody would by their overpriced shit, someone would probably get mad and take their shit or even call the cops on them god forbid.
---
its a card game to play and not an art gallery. If they want cards for their art they should play physical games
---
I didn't play at all in forever actually. I'm still interested in how the world evolves, lore and Story. I've been following it ever since WC3. Videos, cinematics, Novels. There is plenty to do to most video games today that doesn't include just playing said game.
---
The one thing I know for sure about this expansion is that the new Paladin deck where you summon a bunch of Murlocs on one turn is a pretty fucking dumb deck.
---
The Reddit community for most gaming subs now is shit. People do nothing but bitch.
---
They can also buy players. In fact, *puts on tinfoil hat*, I think most players on HS aren't real, maybe only like 10% of the playerbase is real
---
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,10
---
Avg: 1.9
---
90% are below average
---
Anything fast
---
I don't know what the problem is. They release content, I play the game. I'm a consumer not a collaborator.
---
Dude, she's Italian. Apicka choice between carbonara ora puttanesca!
---
Arent all other card games out there trash and dead too? They are barely visible on twitch from what I have seen.  Ded genre inc I guess.  
---
LoL is really the greatest game of this generation crushing every competition.
---
Almost no one is hitting the cap anyways, it would have an extremely negligible effect.
---
How is Celestial better aside from being able to dust her?
---
Thijs is a freaking machine man. Years in and he still not only plays HS every day but enjoys doing it without burning out. Also his streams are constantly funny and positive which is refreshing.
---
I don't think "playing how my favourite streamers play" means do a specific composition
---
But why would one play celestial in the first place?
---
Every metric shows decline. Blizzards own quarterly report has told us of Hearthstones continued decline.
---
Please don‚Äôt pull attention away from where it needs to be. The game hasn‚Äôt had any substantial changes outside of the expansions and adventures.
---
No new game modes.
---
No achievements.
---
Paid for only Heroes.
---
No custom games with friends.
---
No real new design iterations.
---
No new formats.
---
Just literally rinse, wash, repeat.
---
I get that you don‚Äôt want to see ‚Äúnegativity‚Äù but Team 5 needs some criticism, and that‚Äôs what most of the recent posts are about.
---
No way in hell this game is dead in a year.
---
what nerf of what card? caverns below? what changed?
---
\&gt;Accidentally ropes  
---
\&gt;"That was a mistake"  
---
\&gt;Now I look like an asshole
---
Thank you Blizzard.
---
While I would love to see this feature most of the time, I think it would reveal the playstyle of your opponent too. (You could rewatch the whole game knowing every card in their hand.) 
---
This doesn't matter in most games, but in (high) legend &amp; tournament play this is crucial information. Facing the same opponent over and over again is a part of the competitive gameplay. This feature will never be implemented.
---
No.
---
OK, in that case you're right.
---
In that cases my theory is obviously wrong.
---
Not at all. They are good, and worth a bit more than what you pay for them, but paying 9 mana for a minion without taunt (this is a big deal and one of the main reasons the lich king was so much better than ysera) and very underwhelming stats for the cost is an enormous tempo loss and absolutely not worth the mildly overstatted/undercosted cards you get as a payoff. The cards you get (and the fact that you only get one a turn, assuming ysera even survives for more than one turn) are also just mostly not at all worth going for in the late game. Say you drop ysera on 9 and on 10 you get a 4 mana 7/6 dragon or a 3 mana 3/5 elusive. Great - who the hell cares? On turn 10 you play a mid-sized minion at a one or two mana discount. On turn 10 your opponent plays a massive combo or buffs their developed board and they kill you. Admittedly some cards from ysera are hugely better than others - the aoe board clear in particular is something you‚Äôre usually very happy to see, even in the late game.
---
But yeah, overall I would advise against running ysera in any deck, even in a super control/value heavy dragon deck like dragon warrior. Imo ysera actually has the greatest chance of viability in a priest resurrect deck, but then you‚Äôve got a new problem which is that if you get 3/5s from ysera, you won‚Äôt want to play them (you might not even want to play the 7/6s) because you won‚Äôt want to dilute your resurrect pool.
---
See this claim all the time... I guess they just hang around waiting for the opportunity to spread negativity in a community they aren‚Äôt a part of anymore. *shrug*
---
No, we haven't considered this yet.
---
Yup, came to write this exact thing. Expansions by itself is really cool, but it's not able to cover ridiculous prices of multiple new decks and game itself being somewhat stale. 
---
I'm hoping that at least single player will be something cool this time. Boomsday puzzles didn't hook me in at all, and even though Dalaran Heist is really great evolution of dungeon run and I've spent countless hours replaying it in new and new ways I'm not sure if reheating it again will be good.
---
the #1 thing is wanting the most busted cards in the meta to be nerfed.
---
I don't understand people's obsession with achievements
---
So are you almost missing 2 sets (TBP and WW)?
---
We have, in fact, implemented a new game mode! It's "Randomonium" but permanent and accessible to both Standard and Wild formats.
---
Will I ever get past rank 49?
---
This was to be added, but we deemed it too confusing for our new players and the returning ones after a long break.
---
I switched a questing for a prismatic lens. The body is nice but half the time i played her i was already done with quest and after the second time that happened i dropped her. This deck isnt amazing vs aggro but you still have a chance because the sticky reborn minions are great for trading and board control. I tend to lose to aggro because they play good one drops while i have to play quest and skip that turn basically. I dont miss questing at all
---
Interesting idea! I don't have a pen with me, but I'll make sure to remember to write it on a sticky note and pass it on the team!
---
oh good a control warrior mirror. I wish you many more mirrors in the future.
---
These don't even make sense.
---
We wanted to implement this, but we decided to discontinue it in order to focus on other features.
---
Top comment &amp; thread closed.
---
Thats why i suggested to Make it just rewind to garrosh
---
That was my mistake not to mention the full name. I thought it is obvious on what Dr. Boom identity people focused now :)
---
Sorry we can't have new features, the technology isn't here yet.
---
How long was this game?
---
Fortunately that's the least of my worries pal, got kids like you to do that sort of worrying for me
---
We do not have the tools required for this feature to work, so it will not be added anytime soon.
---
I think this is the best solution.
---
But things are usually in a normal distribution curve though, no?
---
Mage and Warrior are too strong. Let's nerf Rogue again.
---
Have you added a new game mode yet?
---
This was to be added, but we deemed it too confusing for our new players and the returning ones after a long break, so we decided not to add it.
---
The community comes up with truly amazing and original ideas
---
Those ideas must just get a little attention but it seems it‚Äòs too much to ask for
---
Then point about entry cost is kinda irrelavant, because entry coast of hearthstone is not stopping you from playing like your fav streamers, unless you mean playing specific deck.  
---
Context matters.
---
They should give you an hourly rate. It is not cool that you are incentivized to play a specific type of deck or class. It is also not cool they require you to completely fuck over your life. Just to get basic income. If you play the game for 40 hours a month that's a 1/4 of what normal people put into their actual job. You should get all in game incentives. This play at least every 3 days SLAVE and grind 10 hours a day SLAVE. Bullshit has to end before people try to take back control of their lives.
---
Our stats show that our players are not interested in this particular feature, so we don't have any plans of going forward with it.
---
They clearly realized that charge is problematic and can cause too many OTK problems so they wisely decided to not push possible issues even further and keep the charge pool limited. It's very simple. Charge still exist, they just won't risk (rightfully so) having to deal with even more problems.
---
Will you add any more free alt heroes to the game?
---
No plans on balance changes yet. Wild is exactly that: wild!
---
I took quest paladin to rank 3, it definitely does well against most decks but suffers vs mage, priest and hard aggro
---
We do not intend on adding a feature as such.
---
No. They won't be like that in the future.
---
Get used to it
---
Above 35 entries you can assume standard deviation, yes.
---
The problem is that you are making an assumption, which means what you are saying is not always true.
---
That's why I didn't say you were wrong :p
---
The game is bad and not getting better. We keep playing because of sunk cost fallacy and the (very) occasional endorphin rush that comes with playing Zephyrs into lethal.
---
&gt; There is someone at blizzard who has the job of making sure the game isn‚Äôt too much fun
---
Basically sums up the game industry post-microtransaction. Most major releases are like this now. Before anything else, the first thing major publishers think about is what's the minimum amount of "game" they can release for the box price before asking for a highwayman's tithe for each remaining piece. Either that, or the game is made deliberately painful and grindy to induce impatience. Or they use a huge fear of missing out to bust open wallets. Hearthstone is an extremely egregious example of all 3 combined.
---
..for those who prefer play him.
---
Your hearthstone streamers will play a lot of decks, your autochess streamers will play a lot of compositions, you can play like your favorites autochess streamers without paying nothing, wilhe in hearthstone.. got it?
---
Never touted my superiority. And my apologies for the assumption because you sure sounded like one. 
---
My initial comments were merely promoting the game, especially amongst all the negativity that is spreading everywhere.. cannot have a civil conversation without people instigating and bringing up deteriorating statements with no real evidence. Don't forget this is a game that was made FREE by blizzard. Who put up the risk of no return? Was it you? Me? No.. they did. If you cannot afford by all means don't, no need to bring the negativity upon everyone else. There is no point in arguing with them because they will always have something else to worry about.
---
And sure your two bullet points make sense but are far from the actual truth and merely exaggerations. You have no more insight than I do on what epics will be useful or not, and if I want to dust and play other meme or meta decks whos to say I can't? My money, I spend it how I want to. $50 a expansion as well as grinding dailies, 10g, AND arena awards will get you far more than 30 packs a day.
---
If you truly do have kids I am truly sorry for them, for you act like your my age, and I'm sorry all of this is riling you up so much. Rather than come instigate every post anyone puts up and further encouraging a pessimistic way of life you could do other things. Teach your kids something right. 
---
And oh I'm sorry that offends you, this is the internet if you didn't remember. People have fun, enjoy themselves, joke with others. You should try it, learn to laugh a little.. your killing me
---
&gt; they absolutely blew it
---
&gt; nobody has even come close to dethroning Hearthstone.
---
choose one
---
artifact completely blew it. hearthstone has been wildly successful.
---
But "more stuff" doesn't mean "more QoL features and free events to get new players interested", does it.
---
Guys, How about a round of Gwent?
---
I'm sorry what's your problem? Are you digging through people's post history to try and call them out?
---
If you'd stalked me correctly you would seen that yesterday I said I *would* have bought some packs this expansion, but haven't for the past 3 due to the environment created by Blizz.
---
Stop causing unnecessary grief and trying to start arguments please.
---
I really don't want to see the other 6 Omega Devastators my opponent got from Dr Boom
---
The other problem is, ActiBlizz doesn't need their product to be hearthstone. If they decide the competition is too stiff or that the return on their investment is too low then they're better off keeping HS on life-support for whatever cash-trickle it generates and putting their money to use in a different game where they don't have serious competition.
---
I only saw it once and I high rolled him regardless. it's incredibly underwhelming. It's one reason I just didn't mention it here.
---
Yeap, feel the same way. The game is much much better around rank 15 than it is at legend. Same busted annoying decks everytime (which is expected, but still boring).
---
I'm holding onto my Finley in hopes that enough paladin cards eventually surface that'll make him actually worth being ran in a singleton deck.
---
Ah, the "if it is not no.1 it is literally unplayable trash" mentality.
---
Is this consistent or did he just want to give you a possibly good 3 drop? I have to test this a few times. brb.
---
Blizzard hasn't been its own company since around 1999. Before Activision it was Vivendi.
---
The quest is rather strong and building a good deck around it is cheap.
---
You are not the hero we deserve, but the anti-hero Blizzaro needs.
---
Looks great, however I'm pretty certain that when I say this I speak for everyone:
---
* If it could be integrated into Hearthstone Deck Tracker
---
It‚Äôs a good expansion but it‚Äôs not a cheap expansion, but the good cards are supposed to have higher rarity so this makes a lot of sense and honestly is indicative of good, consistent design choices.
---
Will you ever reveal how Reno Jackson stays so trim?
---
I always wonder how inept Blizzard management feels when they see stuff like this. People can chant "Activision is driving the game into the ground" all they want.  The reality is Activision is interested in both short and long-term growth.  If the pubes at Blizzard had half a ballsack to make a good business case to Activision for adding this type of content to Hearthstone, they would get the OK.  
---
This is completely subjective, but I feel everyone at Blizzard is just scared as fuck of Activision and want to fly under the radar from behind their computer screens.  Unfortunately, Activision doesn't know Hearthstone or the community as well as the team that developed the game, and their time will be cut short if they don't speak up, letting Activision run it into the ground.
---
I‚ÄôM SUITING UP
---
Can salt be mined for gold or mana?
---
Great work!

Really really sad though.
---
But It's not that expensive if you have the cards. weSmart
---
Long is a bit of an over statement. They did this once or twice over the last 14 months. Some people cite mekgineer, but to me while still wrong  that wasn‚Äôt a consistency change.
---
There‚Äôs only about 18 or so tavern brawls between expansions so not sure how you get 75 promo plus brawl packs ?
---
i didn't do a double take on celestia and assumed it was morrigan
---
Have you considered changing the current hero portraits to a variety of finely selected pale butts?
---
Wild cards will never matter to the larger playerbase of standard, especially if the card was so irritating to play against and also lowkey nowdays chances are you are an old player, rather than a new player starting now,  that stuck with the game and played through the expansions so the dust for one card only will seem irrelevant to you
---
Is there a phone version of that^^ xD
---
Ok I want to make a deck around Icelandic characters in this game but I won't be able to balance between 3 CCG'S. So just tell me is that good or I'll be heartbroken (if you're wondering wtf is wrong with me yes I listened to too much Bjork)
---
But barnes isnt even a issue the deck doesnt even nescarly need barnes
---
Just took a brief scroll over your first page of comments..

It's disgusting.. and to even think you could possibly have kids abusing the internet like this? No wonder why children these days are troubled look what you teach them. Your a pagan, contemptuous, a polemicist.

&gt; If we let blizzard think that we‚Äôve forgotten they‚Äôll get away with this blatant nerf and they‚Äôll think that they can just walk all over us. 
---
The only way they won't "walk all over you" is if you quit when the game is no longer worth your money/time.  Shouting on reddit is just slacktivism.
---
This one I can actually see happening

No it isn‚Äôt, people just don‚Äôt want to admit that precious blizzard is the one screwing them so they blame it all on Activision despite them being very independent of each other

Are you releasing Dr Boom again (the fifth one by now)?
---
If you think this nerf removes Dr boom from the game you have no idea how Bad it is to have a emp operative in your Deck against other matchups and the thing is you cant rly play most of the warrior archetypes because why arent you playing control warrior then
---
yyaaayyyy happy endind g&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I mean yeah if they get lucky with the combo on 5 cool but we‚Äôre in a world where by turn 5 against an aggro deck it won‚Äôt matter and against control they have removal. KotFT priest which I assume is highlander priest was an overturned deck that if it got raza on 5 you lost but big pally is pretty easy to counter
---
How is it a Nerf? Minions will still be 4/4. Btw, this isn't the only minor Nerf not to receive a refund. They count it as a bug fix
---
They buffed the armor gain animation, so maybe sometime in the next 5 year's they'll fix the other animations
---
We did the random card back, why hasn‚Äôt this satisfied the trihards?
---
If you've bought at least one wing of an adventure (either with cash or with gold), you can still play through it, buy access to the other wings, and get the card rewards from it.
---
I honestly believe that if Hearthstone somehow brings about a 180 degree in their development, putting gameplay first, they could attract so many old and new players that it would net them more profit in the long term. Look at games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Counterstrike; they have communities that have been loyal for years or decades with no signs of dying out. 
---
Freebies and updates makes me want to invest more in games. One of the reasons I played a shit ton of WoW back in the day; yes, you had to buy expansions but gained quite some 'free' (I did pay monthly, lol) content afterwards. Because I knew WoW was a long-term thing, I payed for migrations, racechanges, etc.
---
Or the time EA bought Mythic and sometime later shutdown both Warhammer Online and the still in beta but awesome Wrath of Heroes. Such a waste...
---
The piano-toes on the new Uldum board are pretty fun and interactive.
---
Well I'm a normal person too. If you want to try out a meta deck and your on NA feel free to pm &amp; add me. I'll craft what you want to play if I don't already have it and you can try it out before crafting yourself.
---
To be fair, for a very long time, it didn't. I remember an early video where editors from my preferred monthly gaming magazine discussed the merger and reached to the conclusion that it won't really impact the games.
---
I think it would be silly to call them and everyone else who had the same predictions wrong, because for a veeeery long time it was true. The market changed, and instead of adapting trying to adapt to it, they just opened their legs to Activision, but this only happened recently (= a few years ago).
---
For example, the biggest reason Blizz stopped releasing brand new stuff was the success of WoW. And when they did release something, they fucked it up on their own, without any Activision input. I am, of course, talking about SC2 Wings of Liberty and the disgustingly sad state of it. Blizzard thought the success of Brood Was 100% on them, so they were extremely cocky. They had shitty maps, they ran shitty tourneys, they had shitty competitive support (lackluster interface, laggy tournaments, dogshit balance) and almost no social interactivity within their game.
---
Activision did not ruin Blizzard, they did it willingly over a long period of time.
---
Rejected
---
They already could not be silenced. But the change makes it so things that generate cats with specific stats (most importantly Sonya in this case) do not generate Tham as 4/4s.
---
Are you a frayed knot?
---
That was different. Microsoft didnt merge with them, Microsoft owns them, sort of like how Nintendo owns HAL labratories or Intelligrnt Systems. They no longer need to make money they need to make good games, like Insomniac, now obsidians goal is to make amazing games that make you say I should buy an xbox to play that.
---
Blizzard and activision was more now we work together to make a shit ton of money.

Finley is strong. He's just not strong enough to make Highlander Secret Paladin stronger than Highlander Secret Hunter. It turns out not having Zul'jin and not having 4 mana 7/7 are kind of big deals - Paladin struggles to transition to the late-game as well as Hunter can and that's a big problem. 
---
If Blizzard prints some good cheating cards for Secret Paladin, Highlander Secret Paladin could be a deck.
---
&gt;Where are all of the CCGs that are doing better to indicate that Blizzard has "blown it" and no longer has market control?
---
They don't exist because his entire post is absurd. If it was so easy to create a CCG and rake in the millions, Blizz would have a ton of competition. You'd have as many variations of HS as you have variations of Candy Crush.
---
Aw mean, up this point I was sure you were using actual Team 5's answers from the past.

I feel like that about Auto-Battlers now, particularly DOTA Underlords. Its just so good.
---
I like how this comment has edit but not mark as edited by Reddit.
---
Yeah, and I'm gonna guess the guy who is #3 on the ladder probably knows his shit. I havent seen a Flamestrike run in a single Reno list in the last 18 months or so.
---
thank you! this artwork really took around 3 weeks to finish the first, second and third draft was really lackluster i kept coming back to this one in between shifts im happy it turned out okay! thanks djinni!
---
Yeah, I only have two competitive decks right now (and a meme one) because of that. And I have been playing for one year now. I'd rather stick to arena
---
I think he means how having free stuff to hold players makes more money off of the long term sales... 
---
I dont much care for fortnite, but economically, ignoring its successes and what it did right would be foolish.
---
I wonder how rapidly cards would be devalued if Blizzard opened a card market akin to Artifact. I can imagine many millions of people rushing back in to offload their collections even for just a few bucks, because it's better than nothing. I personally quit well over a year ago now and had had a really strong collection at that point, likely over $500 spent over the course of some 4 years. I'd take even 20 bucks for it at this point, as I'll literally never open the client again.
---
(For those wondering why I'm still here, I still like *watching* hearthstone, and checking out new cards, just not playing it.)
---
My source is my own eyes, watching Blizzard develop games for 25 years.
---
this company is dead why are people playing their games still? they've proven time and again that they don't care about their players.
---
Gah! My eyes.
---
Small lie earlier, there's actually 2 epics in this, 1 doomsayer and 1 Ancient of War, but the doomsayer is totally un-needed, and the Ancient is mostly in there because I wanted to try him out in all honesty. There's also a few weird ones like the lifeweaver that aren't run in a deck like this, but I threw it in because I'm f2p and don't have much else to replace it with. 
---

Hope this helps! Additionally I've never shared a deck before so I'm not entirely sure how I'm supposed to do it, so if this is wrong or there is a better way I'd be happy to hear it!

You're not alone. People act like you have to grind endlessly to stay competitive as a F2P player even though there's very little incentive to actually grind in this game. In reality, people make the game expensive for themselves with poor resource management and unreasonable expectations.
---
I had probably invested well over $1000 into my Hearthstone account when I just walked away. Just logged off one day and never logged back in. Picked up some MTG here and there but nothing even remotely close to what I spent on Hearthstone.
---
It was too many releases, too quickly, terrible dust returns/cost, and joke daily rewards. I like games, but I shouldn't be spending $100+ on a single game every couple of months. If Blizzard had found a way to bring down the average monthly cost for players to around $10-$15 per month to stay relevant and competitive, I think they may have actually dominated the genre for 20+ years. 
---
Loot boxes are a joke. The 1/4th dust return is absolutely the worst possible thing about it. The $60 new card set "relevance requirement" is a bad practice. They never even once updated their AI "opponents" if you just wanted to play against the computer for funzies. The whole thing just deteriorated from being a really fun online card game into a wholesale lootbox gambling operation designed to unload whales for as much as possible.
---
I have never been more disappointed in a company. They really, really dropped the ball just to make a quick buck and turn children into gamblers in the process. The sad thing is...they would have made so, so much more over time had they not been so greedy. Fuck you Blizzard.
---
It's a response in PR form to say they're lazy as fuck. Just be patient, guys! We're putting new things in, honest!
---
It's been 6 years. That's the time it takes to go through your ENTIRE teenage life. He can fuck off already with the lying.
---
Yes, very. The lack of healing is supposed to be one of hunter's biggest weaknesses, and it's not like it's that rare to play against decks that are much more aggro than yours is.
---
Maybe you needed to up your damage?
---
http://i.imgur.com/wJdhptv.jpg?1
---
I feel the main reason people are moving on is because of competition in the strategy game field. The new wave of auto chess has spilt most communities because its new. I see it in the same light that BR‚Äôs have taken over and I see hearthstone reviving eventually.
---
I think there's a huge difference between criticizing the game and criticizing Blizzard's business decisions (not providing dust refund). 
---
It also depends on whether they are in a Blizzard-sponsored stream when doing the criticizing.
---
Please don't use Twitch as a reference point to gauge a games popularity. Twitch is a fucking joke and represents a tiny fraction of the overall population of any game and the gaming industry itself. At any given point Twitch has \~250k viewers unless there's a special event happening...that's less than the trash commercial news broadcast in my small country and considerably less than a standard YouTube video. It's a tiny insignificant platform, yet somehow it's used as a standard for what's good or bad. Please, be better than Twitch.
---
Hearthstone is like fifa ultimate team. Its blizzards money printing machine.
---
That's a fair point, but I don't have the time or enjoy hs enough to do that
---
Yeah this is it. Any criticisms I have over hearthstone being super greedy is fully aimed at the top like Bobby Kotick because I know the team puts a lot of effort and love and care into the game.
---
So is GW2.
---
&gt; I don't fault them for making a financial decision, but even as a past-whale, it has made it significantly tougher to keep up with content.
---
This is what gets me too. I've got money to spend, I can actually afford to buy pre-orders, but I just don't want to because I feel like they've reached the point where you pay so much and get so little, I can't convince myself it's not worth buying over something actually useful. 
---
I pre-ordered last expansion, then refused to buy the adventure because I felt like I already dropped so much money into this expansion, I shouldn't be paying _fucking extra_ for the full content. Honestly, any reasonable company would've thrown the adventure into the pre-order.
---
But that really drained my gold, and now I've barely got any of the new cards. And yet, I just don't care---this business model is killing my interest in the game. The prices are too insane. They're really testing their customers with them.
---
A mega-bundle is 80$. I've legit gotten games with way more content and longevity at a cheaper cost than that. A modded Skyrim has given me hundreds of hours worth of fun gameplay for a game I bought several years ago. Even Blizzard's own Warcraft 3: Reforged is only 30$ and is going to have an _ocean_ of new custom game maps you can enjoy for free, which will range from tower defenses, auto chesses, moba's, arenas, RPGs, heck even Pok√©mon.
---
I wish Hearthstone's pricing model was fair. I'd drop money into it without hesitation. I used to, but after the removal of adventures it's gotten so awful.
---
fixed thanks
---
Your "hot take" is so far off it's easily dismissed. Some notably erroneous assumptions:
---
1) Blizz had "complete and total control" of the CCG market. This is just outright false. They had first mover advantage in licensed digital CCG. They did not have any control or means to control the CCG market in general, or even just with respect to digital.
---
2) Blizzard was in a "monopoly" position with HS...false. They could do nothing to prevent other entrants to the market and they had/have no way to control competition outside of attracting more players themselves...which is what every business in every industry has to do. That, in itself, is not a control tactic or the basis to form/cement a monopoly. It just isn't. There never was a monopoly here.
---
&gt; A new expansion just released 5 days ago and you'd never know it. It's the same shit. It's the same soulless monetization cycle and the same exact repetitive game-play(that got more oppressive as more expansions released) with nothing new introduced since day 1.
---
I mean...have you played successful, long term, physical CCGs? It doesn't sound like it.
---
All in all your take is pretty off, IMO. It's just a whine post, really, and an incorrect one at that. HS has been an inarguable success from a business standpoint, and continues to be. For every post we see from a disgruntled player on reddit there is 1000 users happily paying and playing.
---
The notion that Twich numbers are "in the garbage can" is just outright false...HS can often be found floating in the 2-3-4 spot. YT content is still netting people 100k views a day, etc.
---
Your take is highly personal and not very well rooted in objective analysis from a business perspective, which is what you've framed it as. It's just a whine post about what you don't like.
---
&gt;we have content in development that is well beyond the idea phase
---
I have no doubt they can continue to churn out content with the same formula they've been using for years. But what I really want and we haven't gotten much of is features. Tournament mode, new ways to get old heros, deckbuilder improvements, single player content that isn't just dungeon run 2, etc. That is what really will keep the game fresh and exciting for me.
---
HS is not a F2P game. You need to spend $100-$200 (CDN) per expansion minimum to have some sort of collection unless you plan on playing only 1 or 2 decks. The average casual player doesn't have enough skill to climb ladder with budget decks. And some classes right now need 10,000 + dust decks just to be viable. I think the overall balance right now is off and the only class IMO that has a balanced great set is Shaman. Shaman has so many good playable decks right now, but most have at least 2 -3 leggos. Even with the new expansion I still think druid is a mess as well as Priest to some extent.
---
No problem.  And even if you don't know much about the game, I'd like to see this effect in some form.   Probably make it a Legendary Mage minion, maybe slightly cheaper to allow synergy with Freeze spells (since freeze usually wears off after your opponents turn ends).
---
This man is right, the definition of innovate is to "make changes in something established, especially by introducing new methods, ideas, or products". This is exactly what Blizzard does.
---
Honestly though, I‚Äôm pretty sure the majority of the community have only stayed because there‚Äôs not a good mobile alternative yet
---
[WOW](https://imgur.com/a/i5O22WZ)
---
The Shadowreaper hero power isnt even the most devastating part about the Spawn of Shadows combo now, but at 0 mana that deck would probably do pretty well right now. Priest already has the control options to keep up with Odd Rogue/Pally and Quest Mage.
---
I honestly wouldnt play Krul even off a discover. It just opens you up to throw away all your demons, and means that if your Bloodreaver battlecry gets cleared immediately, you're now burning resources.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with most of what you wrote here, I‚Äôm just wondering: what do you think pressuring the *dev* team would accomplish?
---
They are probably pressured-enough as it is, hence, many departing from the team last year. And as you say, they probably would love to implement many of these features, but are probably limited to working on whatever Blizzard delegates them to do (i.e., stimulating card sales). 
---
If *anyone* deserves to be pressured, it‚Äôs Blizzard‚Äôs management/corporate structure. If the cost of losing players (i.e., potential card sales) exceeds that of implementing new features, then we might see actual change.

Nope. Wotc have said there wont be a mobile client. Its far too resource heavy as a game
---
magic arena &gt; hearthstone
---
It's honestly shocking how little they've done to improve the interface and how few QOL features they've added over the years. I've never played a game that's still supported and still selling stuff that has less actual support than HS. Why is the search feature still so stupid? Search for something, clear the search and then type something new in and it just shows nothing or makes the search box jump from top to bottom?

You'd discover that TgT had more staple legendaries played compared to GvG and GvG had way more legendaries that ended up massively ignored.
---
The people that are laughing most are shareholders and upper management.. and they're laughing all the way to the bank.
---
So no response at all...?
---
Which doesn't necessarily mean the game is bad. Hearthstone is over 5 years old and a natural lack of interest is normal. The game is essentially what it's always been and it's still fun for the most part. Not only that, it's free and you don't have to play it.
---
As an alternative opinion, I think the Dalaran heist is the best single player content released to date, and has tons of little hooks and modifiers to keep every run fresh. In addition, they ran a ton of mini-events last season: Dalaran X Blackrock, the Snip-Snip release/rebalance, burn down (Though I do take issue with the implementation on this one, it was a cool idea)
---
How can you say that both DotA and League were here first when they are in the same genre and DotA came out way before League?  This kind of goes against your point that the game that comes first tends to have control of the market, because League came way after DotA but is still wildly successful.
---
Avenging Wrath is mostly a board clear card, but Zephrys will not offer it since it depends on RNG. In this particular case, it was lethal without RNG involved.
---
This is the expansion that killed it for me. It looks fun but for the first time I just can't make any actual decks without throwing exorbitant amounts of money at the game so I've just stopped playing.
---
I like Hearthstone but I can't justify these prices for a digital non-tradeable card game to myself.
---
Why would they invest more cost into the game when you guys pay so much regardless
---
3 expansions a year is good enough for me. I don't sit on this game all day. I play it from time to time and the amount of time now is perfect with how long it takes me to start getting bored of the expansion / getting enough cards from it. Arena is always exciting.
---
hello warrior :

Ill0lIlIll#1179 EU 80g quest
---
Shadowverse is another good CCG
---
Ever since gold is removed in 2022, will we see any new ways to expand our collection without spending money?
---
That's one of the many reasons I'm so happy that I moved to MtG:A. Magic Arena is much better in every aspect of the game: more f2p friendly, gameplay is more fun, more competitive, meta MUCH more diversed. I wish everyone realised what they are missing by keep playing HS.
---
I never put a single dime into hearthstone. I do my daily quest and pack up my gold and I usualy have enough gold to buy 50-60 pack once the next expac goes live. I enjoy the game casually and this expansion intoduce his fair share of new dynamics. Reborn  is quite nice and the QUEST are back with a boost. While I agree that Blizzard didnt add anyhting new in terms of gameplay, Heartstone does exactly what i want it to do for a mobile game (I play almost exclusively on my phone). I have yet to discover another good mobile game that i can enjoy daily.. And i dont see any card game that come even close to the level of polished and complexity like hearthtstone. MtG is way too convoluted, Glenn is good for a few weeks but it quickly run his course. Yes, Blizzard could improve their game and add a few more playstyle and I will be more than happy to try them out. But I am sure I will be back to my routine in no time.
---
You guys suck, how bout you stick this pen up your arse.
---
We've heard all this before and you guys have a track record of going "just be patient guys, we're really working on it we promise!". We've been hearing that for literally years. 
---
6 years, in fact. Enough is enough. Get your asses in gear. This game NEEDS frequent balance changes (one per month two week into the season is the absolute bare minimum), if nothing else. But given the track record, we all feel like we'll get nothing. And if you don't like people being negative, it's Blizzard's own fault.
---
r/CompetitiveHS is pretty good if you want to actually talk about hearthstone
---
If you have the same secret equipped already, it'll show you the secret.
---
Add the *choice* to reveal your hand
---
What about refunds of every single card you have that goes wild at rotation...
---
I started playing the beta. 
---
The game should balanced for the sake of balance, not to make up for past "injustices".
---
More like,
---
Add an omega devastator to your hand
---
I actually much preffer control game style over aggro so Warrior being at the top isn't that bad. And with the limited packs I bought I got exclusively warrior legendaries... So playing some of the other cool decks (unfortunately including all quests and all highlanders) is out of my reach.
---
So yeah. Don't hate me, but imma play some Warrior this expansion. And then switch back to Arena.
---
I only paid for the adventures you had to buy early on. Since then I have had more than enough cards and enough gold to play arena every time I want to. I don't dust anything besides duplicates and have enough dust to make 2 legendaries.
---
Up the gold count on winning three games to 20g?
---
I put faith in the response. 
---
The team has been killing it in these areas for the past 6-12 months:
---
* Card design
---
* Single player content
---
* Improving Arena (still a work in progress, though)
---
* More responsive nerfs. Added buffs.
---
* More consistent/better Tavern Brawls
---
 
---
So, if those people are applying the same kind of thought/excellence to new features, then I'm optimistic for what they have in store.
---
This game is ridiculously expensive. I didn‚Äôt realize it before because I played a few classes and kept up with them for a while (Druid, priest, and warlock). That is until rotation and nerfs. Now blizzard prints absolute garbage for those classes that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I didn‚Äôt play warlocknfor zoo, I didn‚Äôt play Druid for token, and I for sure didn‚Äôt play priest to play goddamn zoo. Now I have to start from scratch basically because blizzard deleted what I enjoyed most about my favorite classes. The game is also way more expensive now so it‚Äôs a huge barrier to me getting started again. I‚Äôm looking to try cyclone or conj mage because it has the cool combos and semi control style gameplay I like. Like I enjoy control but with a combo finisher (cubelock, gallery priest, maly or tog Druid). Feel free to hate on me but ya what I enjoy. Sadly mage decks are wayyyu too expensive for me to get into now.
---
The fact that you promised more communication to the comunity and after all is the same thing, when you only comunicate before an expansion, really makes me doubt every single word coming from Team 5.
---
Clearly people are upset about the state of the game, people want more achievements, people want warrior balanced, literally everyone that plays hearthstone except Team 5 knows that warrior needs to be adressed.
---
And its always the same thing, you take MONTHS to adress some situations. I have played a lot of video games and sincerely i have never seen a development team so lazy as hearthstone's development team. 
---
Its sad that you let such a cool game fade away because you refuse to change cards or make some QoL improvements (lets not talk about the time you took to adress Psychic Scream in Wild).
---
&gt; but because they had very low impact on the game, Karazhan and BrM were thrash and LoE was mediocre at best.
---
What???? All 3 had significant impact to the meta for YEARS and some cards are still played in tier 1 decks in Wild to this day! They specifically made the cards in adventures more powerful in order to change up the meta. What are you talking about?

Everyone I face on ladder has a complete meta deck, no replacements, nothing missing. This is how I know your post is 'the vocal minority'
---
Yes, but Blizzard has replaced regular solo adventures for them, which can raise the argument on whether blizzard really "added" anything to the game, or did they take 1 step foward and 2 steps back?
---
When even Kibler is like "this card is dumb and I don't like it" you know it's a badly designed card.
---
some of the stuff people want is about literally changing a few numbers that one person could implement in a short amount of time. it does not take a team. 10 gold to 20 gold, 50 gold to 60 gold, 5 gold tipping, no duplicate epics, better epic pity timer, etc. just little quality of life things like that which will stop droves of people from walking away because they cant build any fucking decks without paying a small fortune.
---
Okay? I never said it was bar. Just that the new expansion cycle feels expedited and my interest has waned.
---
It‚Äôs free to play, I haven‚Äôt spent a dime on cards. I bought one character skin and that‚Äôs it. I earn my cards through arena. You don‚Äôt have to spend much to create the best deck. I still have fun playing.

---
I'd make it 8 mana so you can combo with Ray of Frost.
---
That is basically why I stopped playing, I have made this decision ( I have been playing since launch) when I saw the new cards. They look good , but they didn't excite me. The game kinda lost its feel for me, it has been stale forever now imo
---
&gt; WOL was a hot mess, because all kinds of super broken cheesy stuff could win you games. 
---
I never played SC2 past WoL, but it was my first true foray into being a "serious" esports fan back when Tastosis was casting the GSL on shitty 480p streams at like 3 in the morning.
---
Now I only played casually, but at least at the GSL level you're exaggerating on how broken the game was. There were consistent top players for each race like Nestea and MVP for quite a long time, and each faction had players who consistently won tournaments. There were heavy cheese stategies of course - it's an RTS that's a given, but those players almost never won extended series against top pros. 
---
Even the Starcraft 1 legends ended up transferring over but by that time I had fallen out of watching it due to a lot of players/teams going to LoL/Dota and it might have been after HotS was released.
---
I've been playing since Gnomes and Goblins and this is literally the situation I fall in to every expansion. I want X deck, but don't have enough dust. I've only paid for 1 adventure since playing and am totally fine with that. I am playing an amazing game that I can play for free with no extra expensive each month. That is literally awesome, yet Reddit seems to shit on anything that isn't given to them.   
---
I'm an adult, so you know what I do. I find a different deck to play until I have enough dust saved up or coins to get a certain deck. So many people want something right now. Just save some dust, it's like real life. If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes, I save up until I have enough money to buy it. Same goes with decks and cards.
---
 And guess what, I don't get ever card so I can't craft every deck. But this is just a fun game for me, I'm not trying to make it big or stream or anything.
---
We need a new competitive mode.
---
I've always been a fan of Restricted Ranked Mode. Basically, it's standard ladder that has 5 cards banned from the standard set for 1 season, with new banned cards chosen at the start of the new season. Whether that's determined by popular vote, win percentages of cards, or what the devs want to ban; having 5 top cards removed will definitely shake up the meta every time a new season happens. Make it its own ladder, with Legend and everything.
---
Can you imagine the meta for a month if Dr Boom Mad Genius, Ziliax, Eviscerate, Spring Paw, and Novice Engineer were removed for 30 days?
---
Well, I mean back then just checking online for the three or so cards was a reasonable solution, not anymore.
---
Why do people who know so little about card games feel so compelled to complain about them as if they're experts?
---
It is *not* lazy to use existing mechanics or characters. This argument has been made so many times over the last month or so, and it's so ignorant. Calling Reborn "essentially just deathrattle" is equally nonsensical.
---
I can only hope this is sarcasm that went over my head, though I've seen several other threads making pretty much the same exact complaints. It makes me glad Blizzard doesn't respond as much as people want because this crap should really be ignored by them.
---
I mean this can't be true. Or if it is, dust your shit legendaries and your HoF cards and play the cards you want to play.
---
n o b o d y c a r e s b r o
---
Ive been playing since the beginning and never dusted any of my old cards. I play exclusively wild as I find standard slow and boring.
---
LOLLL bringing justice upon the world I see, doing your part for the salvation of humanity.
---
Yeh honestly I have an aggro warrior deck made but I haven't played much warrior at all period. I'll definitely heed your advice if I run it especially if I see those murloc paladins. I tried that murloc pally and it's so degenerate even when you win it's no fun, it feels like casino Royale.
---
I'm running Highlander Hunter and Highlander mage mostly right now we'll see how it goes 
---
But is otk kkk hunter actually a good deck?? I thought they were all hot trash and it was just a meme deck.. could be wrong lol saw thijs playing it and he got smacked upside the cheek
---
I made a highlander paladin spell based deck that works more like a control deck and has been pretty decent. 
---
Mainly just board control then dropping big guys in the late game
---
Question being : Wouldn't it be better to have 2 slightly larger expansions, and more frequent balance changes? I feel like they're required to increase the frequency of new content because of Hearthstone's shallow rules and the apparent lack of balance changes.
---
#Why do other decks play cards REEE??1?
---
Gotta pay for that Epstien hitman somehow
---
Trying it out as a Singleton Mech build, having mixed results. Of course, I'm low rank so what so I know.
---
Idk never thought this was a feature lul, spent years just browsing everything to find the new cards
---
Wow, I dropped that card from my burgle rogue because it was only getting me rogue and neutral deathrattles.  Today I find out I'm just not very lucky.
---
Seriously, I played that card a good 10 times before cutting it.
---
Lol git gud, play around them
---
Release Naxx already
---
I mean this is blizzards marketing plan?
---
Keep the game just fun enough to maintain a player base while making you pay a small fortune to enjoy the areas of the game that are truely fun...and temporary. All under the guise of free to play.
---
Looking at the played win rates, Armagedillo is slightly higher than Boom and they are both tied in Drawn win rate. If Boom was like 5% higher win rate than other cards, the stats themselves would speak louder. 
---
Now that I do hate Boom sooooo much. His value and rushing mechs make him the absolute worst. However, I just don't know if the stats support the claim that he is broken though. 
---
If anyone who understands statistics would like to fill me in on why I'm looking at the stats wrong, please let me know as I always enjoy learning about the analysis of card statistics!
---
It‚Äôs not enough for them to move on- you need to see how bad the game is for YOU so the creators will know how badly they‚Äôve treated US and will come back and grovel to have us back and give out free shit.
---
Most of the people whining on here would still suck no matter what was nerfed.
---
Incoming complaints about control warrior in 3... 2... 1...
---
From what I've dealt with so far Kangor's isn't critical. It's a strong swing card late game though and very glad I got it in a pack a while ago. 
---
But, Undatakah (who I crafted 3 months ago for hunter) has won a bunch of games against control (since on turn 10 you can play him and then copy him...which means your opponent has to deal with 6 new 7/7's or 8/8's. He's vital against control basically. But to be fair he stinks against agro. 
---
Personal opinion: don't craft either and see how you do. If you don't do well against control consider crafting Undatakah since he is at least neutral and can go in future decks.
---
&gt;you can't play the new cards and the new decks, because of the old leader decks.   
---
https://hsreplay.net/meta/  
---
murloc paladin, highlander hunter, big spell mage, aggro warrior, combo priest, highlander mage, zoo warlock, quest paladin, quest druid and quest shaman are all competitively viable decks built around new cards. quest druid's winrate is being lowered by malygos and elise combo decks, the standard deck is a solid tier 2. quest shaman is doing poorly overall but zalae seemed to be doing fine with it in top 100 legend.
---
that's every online community that gets big
---
Don't blame the devs. Blame their bosses who are likely telling them not to work on those things because they aren't profitable and threatening their jobs if they don't continue to pump out cash cow expansions.
---
die prescriptivist scum
---
Looks like a basic deck for new players, but why the murlocs?
---
The game is annoyingly pricey to keep up with if you‚Äôre a casual player
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_cg5mgkp03w6aWxszEO1Hg here you go!
---
&gt;The truth is our game has a ton of development upkeep.
---
Like this with so many problems in the development of Hearthstone, are there any plans to fix this going forward? We are your playerbase and we like your game but we can't play it in the state it is in.
---
It's actually just this. I'm still subscribed to casually see what's happening. I know i'm not returning, yet the memes and threads like this still give me a chuckle because it's nothing unexpected to see the community whine about mundane things that aren't the actual problem. It's not even a HS community problem, it is the same shit everywhere. Dota, CS, LoL, BF, Fifa, NBA, CoD, PUBG and so on. Everybody is crying because the skins, dances, weapons, card packs, or whatever the fuck is the actual primary content, is too expensive.
---
The community of those games doesn't realise how these things are the main reason why the games are so shitty these days. They don't care about fixing game breaking bugs. They don't care about some cheaters or script kiddies destroying the experience of an unsignificant minority. They don't care about what the community wants (e.g. Tournament mode, replays, etc.).
---
Just to give an example whats wrong with all of gaming these days: Valve had a revenue of 4.3 BILLION Dollars in 2017. TI9, the biggest e-sport tournament of all times, was funded by valve for 1.6 MILLION Dollars. Prize pool is now at 32.7 Million. MILLION. The community contributed over 31 MILLION DOLLARS just by buying some basic content and worthless skins. Fucking what?!
---
And yet, the community thinks these companies are obliged to change the games to the better or just give them what they once promised (Dota2 people are still waiting for some content they were promised back in ti7 in 2017). 
---
Why the fuck would you think those companies are putting even minimal effort into some important stuff when they can make record revenues year after year by adding trivial skins and cards into the game.
---
Sorry for the rant, just pisses me off and had to be said.
---
Because they probably are when dealing with the bureaucracy within the lumbering monster that is Activision-Blizzard.
---
I agree i spent less this expansion than i have on any other as well, im just curious the viability of blizz selling a set instead of packs. at the launch of an expansion.
---
If you spend all your working hours on shortterm consumable content and almost none on the longterm development of the game, something is off.
---
Isn't this game supposed to last for 10+ years?
---
Gallery Priest pre-rotation. My favorite deck of all time. No better feeling that watching an Odd Warrior do nothing but hero power all game and feel safe before ending their entire career with 80-100 damage to face.
---
What about your equipped life steal weapon
---
&gt; It's 5 years later, and all the people who invested all their time, money and energy into this game are still on this sub begging Blizzard to get their shit together.
---
No they (we) aren't. You made r/all, otherwise I'd have never seen this. I put hundreds of dollars in, had my fun, and quit over a year ago. I dusted my entire collection except for one card - whatever that Legendary is that gives you a random deck. Whenever I'm in the mood I just play that or some Arena.
---
I watch dog because I've been watching him forever but I far prefer his TFT content to his HS content. 
---
If you still like HS then keep on keepin on. Get your packs and enjoy your game. If you don't like it but feel 'trapped' by the money you've already spent, you are fucking dumb and need to get over that shit. There's a million games out there. Go find one that makes you happy.
---
Someone said in a comment that Zephyrs's wishes are based in the public information on the board. So it may be possible that a deathrattle that interacts with the opponent's hand would not affect your options. If a deathrattle is, for example, summon a 1/1 minion, that a different thing.
---
Brann turned out to be so much better than I expected. Octosari, though.
---
Pretty satisfying since I had a 75% win-rate going up. December 2017 KNC meta I played Spiteful Priest tech'd against Cubelock. It felt pretty good. Everyone was saying it was this beyond god-like grind and I just knocked it out and that was that.
---
Right, but typically those extra removals come from an extended game. If the game goes that long, most hunters are going to lose anyways. We want to negate the removal you have in your deck to start so we can end before we run out of steam.
---
They will release stuff once the players start to drop until then its time to hold stuff back for unknown reasons
---
If you think being a spike is bad try being a Johnny... Any card that you would want to experiment with is pretty much an epic. Unless you are willing to dish out 1k a year you won't ever experiment.
---
First time I‚Äôve seen this posted! 
---
Wait...wait, no. That‚Äôs not true at all.
---
tbh they aren't comparable. HotS was far below League and Dota and it's 2.0 didn't do anything about that. Hearthstone was (and still is) the leading game in the online TCG market. In fact, Hearthstone's dominance in its field is bigger than League's dominance in MOBAs.
---
I wouldn't recommend anyone starting now or last year but if you play 2 year+ you should be fine
---
*finishing anything
---
Exactly this. I always roll my eyes when some Reddit misguidedly says like, ‚ÄúWell all you have to do is constantly treat the game like a second job &amp; you‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù
---
r/UsernameChecksOut
---
Lmao they never had control over CCG... their market share was several billions below Hasbro even before MTGA
---
My point is this is a very special case where people are still traumatized by that cancer of a deck from back when it was in standard. Any other nerfs to any other decks and people would be in an outrage.
---
If blizzard wants to sell pre-orders of 50eu for 50 packs or whatever, that's fine. I don't spend money because I don't like the direction they're going, not because it's too expensive. 
---
Though I have to admit even if I did like the team I would only buy like a portrait cause I'm cheap like that.
---
The answer is don‚Äôt queue into them lol. Honestly most shaman decks beat this deck because they either have a ton of silence/hexes or they are aggro and beat you before you get going. Also sometimes the mct can wreck you with double battlecry. So yeah just don‚Äôt queue them lol. I currently rank 1 three stars and have only weird shaman once from rank 3.
---
Tyrande! Where are you?!
---
Man, they are like politicians. "Don't worry, we're working on it".
---
Even if they do, right now, nobody believes.
---
 Battletag: Jimotonic#2749, Region: Asia, Trade only: Yes, you go first
---
the thing i liked about the idea of the set purchase though is that if you are like me you opened 100+ packs and ended up with at least 15+ of one card. 
---
Imagine how much money it would actually take to get every card of an expansion if it was impossible to get duplicates? waaayyy less than it currently does that's for sure.
---
I mean, the deck now has some pretty clear counters. Quest Paladin and Reno Hunter both have very high win rates against Control Warrior.
---
That doesn't explain that cards that I own for many years will randomly show up marked as new.
---
A singular expansion doesn't need to be more expensive; the game as a whole compounds its expense with each new expansion. If you've just come back from a break, you suddenly need not only this expansions cards, but a bunch of cards from other expansions that you may not even have played through.
---
That is a core reason that many people will leave the game. Not every one can justify spending money in such regular intervals. There comes a breaking point.
---
Good thing the minecraft launcher is great for old versions! 
---
    
---
Why do you like beta more? I like to play the newer versions, because there's so much more content but if I want, I can ignore it and still play like beta.
---
Most of the dust cost is from free ledgendaries given out in the past or other cards. Like zill and sn1. You should have enough to invest into solid deck and get a free 500 dust per month and pack each week in addition to gold daily. I think it‚Äôs fine the way it is except maybe adding more game modes. Having more beawliseuns would be great
---
Oh lawd aight imma check it out
---
&gt;yet they cannot simple finish one at a time
---
isnt that normal in game or software development? an average small scale game dev would spend a year developing tens of concepts just to scrap most of them and if they are lucky, they can get only one published.
---
this post is why nobody want to reach out to the community when there are always some who don't know shit about the nature of their work.
---
Not trying to defend them as there are some shady shits here and there but you should, at least, be a bit more reasonable for your criticism.
---
Ok, I have been playing since open beta, and have invested quite a portion of my time, and a bit of money(not too much, around 150‚Ç¨ throughout that period). As expansions got larger and got progressively more boring I started playing less and less to the point of even not caring to reach rank 10 (used to be a legend player until two years ago). Usually a month before a new expansion I would save up 2000 gold max (because I'm extremely bored to gather more) and spend it on packs just to get a legendary(wow)... Now I want to quit the game forever but that everlasting bond won't let me. Any tips?
---
Just play highlander decks; they‚Äôre so much fucking fun I‚Äôm loving it 
---
And putting 13 legendary in a viable deck is also very fun hahha
---
Yes but it was mostly from non-engineering roles
---
Well "nondeveloppers" (mainly esports and community managers)
---
Breaking: people with similar interests have different opinions regarding those interests
---
To be honest, I don't really buy it. I have played this game as long as you have. Pretty much did every single quest every day and even put 40-50‚Ç¨ into every expansion until last one. As soon as they put out 3 expansions a year I fell behind. I don't nearly have 80% of every set.
---
I even grind Arena mostly with an average of 5-6 wins.
---
I will no longer pay money for this game and just accept that constructed is no longer for my collection as being able to maybe play two iterations of a competitive deck gets boring within days. 
---
I am not saying you are lying, but it sound unbelievable to me.
---
I might get downvoted here but to be honest I wanted to get this out.
---
No hate from me.
---
Not really. I've got 3600 dust saved up and have pretty much every important legendary in the game. If I wanted to play hunter I could, If I wanted to play mage I could. I unpacked mage quest and Zephrys. Also shaman and rouge quest.
---
How will you prepare for it as a rogue? A backstab a minion or two to trade and that‚Äôs it.
---
If they nerf warrior highlander mage will be a king of standard
---
Imagine posting this 10-15:years ago. Imagine what could have been if Activision hadn't entered the picture
---
Microsoft is throwing tons of money at Minecraft. It's just on the Augmented/Mixed Reality side rather than core game play.
---
TBH I thought of creating a Murloc combo,by increasing their attacks etc. But its bad ;right?
---
Stop buying expansions, they'll only improve the game when profits dip. Haven't bought an expansion ungoro.
---
Yikes that's where anonymous hacks right?
---
Yes they will mindstorm and test features. No denial in that. However it is that they‚Äôre WORKING on so many things and not TESTING which is the wording in said statement.
---
No one expected bomb warrior to feel so weak.  It‚Äôs neither fast enough or controlling enough.
---
I think most of the people who are upset are the ones who spent money. I like to say caveat emptor, but I also feel bad for people who spent money on this game and then later realize the pitiful value they get.
---
I'm getting downvoted, but I still think the Shaman hero power is OP. Bran Bronzebeard was an autoinclude in most decks, this hero power is much, much better.
---
Achievements?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm aligned with this. Or like 30 gets me like 60-80 packs so I have enough to craft one or two decks I really like and can grind the rest out. I really can‚Äôt justify spending one full games worth for these.
---
Have you ever wanted to dress up like a lobster and chase your wife until she cries?
---
Why do you have ‚Äúhack the system‚Äù when you don‚Äôt have any weapons and only one upgrade? Those are two wasted deck slots without weapons.
---
I'm a practice manager at a hospital taking in 1.5 million dollars per year. You can keep your moronic assumptions to yourself.

Every couple weeks, that's "only" about 156 times in 6 years and they manage to answer the same thing in different fashion the exact same amount xD
---
&gt; The Diablo mobile "you all have phones, right?" debacle shows how even some Blizzard devs have lost touch with its audience, compared to the Starcraft 1/Diablo 2 years.
---
I wouldn't be sure about that. The guy had to present the new Diablo as a mobile game and pretend that was great and the best decision ever. We don't know whose decision it was to turn Diablo into a mobile game, but the guy that said that sentence couldn't say anything else. He wouldn't keep his job if he said "yeah, we suck, but we think we can make more money off of you in a mobile platform".
---
IMO that's what blizzard does best. They enter the market probably not at first but in such a way that it disrupts the competition and keeps them on top. Take WOW for example, not the first MOM but made the grmenre immense.
---
Why not go for a Highlander Dragon Paladin then? Why does it have to be Highlander Secret Paladin?   
---
You could try to control the board earlier with cards like \[\[Cathedral Gargoyle\]\] and \[\[Sandwasp Queen\]\]. And then you can drop your \[\[Bronze Herald\]\] into a \[\[Dragon Speaker\]\] and \[\[Glowstone Technician\]\] for 4 mana 9/9 dragons. I know that takes a bit of set up, but Highlander Paladin seems like it would be much better if it worked as a control list as opposed to an aggressive one with secrets.
---
Ok, ok, you got us there! But please stop asking questions about the flat earth, ok?
---
Are we talking about Hearthstone or the Steam client right now?
---
I love the new Finley, he instantly replaced his 1 mana 1/3 cousin in my Wild N'zoth Renodin and along with Zephrys made it a little bit more competitive (still folds massively to Big Priest, but that's nothing newn). In Standard right now Pallies have issues with late-game value compared to Reno Mage, let alone Warrior, so my deck is on the janky side (some dragons, some big spells for Shirvallah, some bombs like Tirion and Ashmore), but is still incredibly fun to play unless your goal is to break the meta wide open. Hard mulligan for Finley - and onward, to adventure! I must insist!

&gt;The first tavern brawl this expansion requires you to have new cards to keep up with the other decks   
---
what deck were you playing that was competitive before but struggles now?
---
How is your butthole today?
---
Totally understand this complaint! And that's really my point: the problem isn't the cards themselves, but the structural elements of the game. Hard to keep up with due to cost, no new game modes added in years, tournament support has taken a step back, etc. Those are real problems that I agree with.
---
I just think it's worth also pointing out that Blizzard is nailing card design, because I really think they are. It's just not enough on its own.
---
salty boi
---
You're ten years old and you know it.
---
Best art of this expansion
---
Its pure statistics. If you are not completely retarded you have an average win chance of 55% of with a Tier 1 Meta Deck. Play enough games and you are bound to reach legend.
---
That's bullshit or wishful thinking.
---
Not like any dev can say "yeah we think this price is fucking thievery but we don't have the power to lower it".
---
Highlander/Big Spell Mage costs 20k, so congratulation, you Can build a deck!
---
Your deck isn‚Äôt viable if it loses to every common deck in the format. You‚Äôre arbitrarily assigning a more narrow definition to the word ‚Äúviable‚Äù to make yourself seem right. You‚Äôre not. Just stop, lol.
---
Can confirm I face more meta decks in casual than I do at rank 10. For both wild and standard.
---
I've always said to myself that when the game drastically changes its model, it's a sign of it dying off. Hearthstone isnt nearly as monumental at it was years ago, and in the past year have started offering more incentives to preorder, which is a bad sign for us as players. Give us enough to make us feel like we are getting more value without actually creating anything new. Once we start seeing massive swings in the economy, game modes, etc the game is already out the door. This is classic Blizzard, always acting far too late and losing half their playerbase or more before implementing what should have been already in the game years prior. WoW did it, Overwatch is doing it, Starcraft did it... you catch my drift. Sure itll retain enough players to survive, but the hype around Hearthstone is dead and gone.
---
Atziri is a she? Wow.
---
Yup. Res priest barely exists where I am right now lol (rank 8)
---
I've drank my one beer at the worst possible time. I've already switched to my native language halfway through one of my posts, lol.
---
OG Boom was whatever. It was a strong popular card that encouraged midrange and was a comeback mechanic (better against a full board). 3 mana BGH existed, I have no bad feelings against him.
---
Agreed. There are a lot of easy wins they haven't put any effort into.
---
Playing big priestbfor all eternity i say
---
Sure, you can say this! Some people might mean an actual mode where you play 1 deck vs everyone else's deck's. Or maybe they want a 3 deck mode where you have to win with 2 decks to beat your opponent and move up the ladder. Or perhaps they want it to be formatted like the pro scene and only put in a pool of like 30 people
---
You see why saying "Tournament mode" is detrimental?
---
Irpn jurggernaut is the only acceptable bomb deck lol
---
Can we please have no epic 3x when opening packs?
---
How? They‚Äôd see you topdecked it anyway. Its better because I know some people ALWAYS lethal with a topdecked/generated card; I‚Äôd be less salty if I knew they had a different out.
---
"We started work on a bunch of different things" and other kneeslappers from the Hearthstone dev team
---
i concede to murloc pally every time because i'd rather lose a star on ladder than run aoe*  
---
FTFY
---
Yea I agree. A lot of the other complaints, or feedback are totally valid. Its jut the whole thing with decks, and even expecting a dm reply from a dev is just funny.
---
I don't think you understand. "A month of grinding" is not something I'm willing to do for this game. That's why I've spent about $300 on cards. Back when Blackrock Mountain was released, I did grind for 1400 gold just to buy the first two stages. Afterwards, I did not enjoy playing, and I was not about to spend $20 to unlock the remainder of the expansion. I have other things to play besides Hearthstone, games that don't require me to spend enormous amounts of time/money to enjoy them.
---
As for the "secret", I'll copy from another comment I wrote about my collection.
---
&gt; I have no wild collection to speak of, because I dusted it completely at the start of this year's card rotation, as I did the year before. I have a total of 23 legendaries, with all of them being useful in some capacity. Lucentbark being the most useless, but if I wanted to play Heal Druid, it's basically a requirement. I have a total of 3 decks this expansion, with 2,325 dust remaining.
---
If I had to take a guess, Dr Boom.
---
This sub: lol wild is a joke
---
Blizzard: makes a small change to a wild card
---
This sub: DOES BLIZZARD HATE HAPPINESS???
---
I wouldn't even be surprised if I get 300 replies about how it's not even a small change and blizzard just wants all our money because they wont give dust over such a grievous nerf to such a beloved and top tier deck
---
Translation: "If I told you we were a small indie company still would you believe me?"
---
Please smash your head against a wall, you delusional tardlord.
---
In Wild I saw Dane (maker of the best wacky wild decks) playing a Singleton N'zoth druid that copied Elise and N'zoth a bunch of times by copying Elise with banker/zola.
---
Nice, upvote worthy
---
Several things wrong with this... first, reno mage is tier one. Second, Elise is very garbage in this meta and sees no competitive play. Third, murloc paladin plays finley so it‚Äôs not like you can get angry that it‚Äôs effect goes off once in like 5 games. Just be happy it sees play because the way it looks before expansion it was complete trash
---
'k ... just checking - the wait's killing me!!!! Haven't had a good (NEW) adventure in a while!
---
If you want your own deck of legendaries just look through the most recent expansions and find the bullshit ones that either give you a premade deck (wizbang) or one that changes all your cards to legendaries (Rafam)
---
Thanks for the info! Yeah I'm preeeetty far off from any legendary so Ill hold them both for awhile.
---
Have you tried a lackey build with hack the system using upgrade and livewire Lance? It might take your agro pirate build and make it into a much more fun and value oriented build. I guess it depends on your style. I feel like lCkeys would be supported better for warrior In wild.

I still browse the sub for r/halo even though I haven't really played the game in years due to the constant abuse of hearing 12 year olds talking about banging my baby boomer mother.
---
I sure hope you LOVE it because you'll be getting 15 variations of it over the next 5 years.
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Slow Midrange Hunter?
---
Do you mean the new legendary Zephyrius?
---
Yes, the new set is great, but also are the problems, the recurrent ones are the balance team taking ages to fix cards and the game is damn costly, add to that, the lack of new games modes and simple features like achievements and tournament mode.
---
Unfortunately for you and the rest of us, zephrys can only discover classic and basic cards
---
Because HotS and Dota/LoL are two fundamentally different games. They are the same genre, true. But you can't compare them in the same way that you can't compare Battlefield with Counterstrike.
---
We disagree, but I can tell we are fans of the same things...StarCraft, eSports, and beer.  Cheers!
---
mage decks def have a good aoe on turn 5 /s
---
Yea, it has a high roll problem for sure. A lot of people who think control decks are unfun are about to get their first taste of a truly high rolling deck where you win or lose entirely based on the opponents draw. Deck probably isn't op I would guess, but we've been here before.
---
The idea of the post is very clever and cool!
---
For an exceptionally busy hospital guy bringing in millions of dollars he sure does have a lot of time to troll Reddit.
---
pretty sure you played it wrong and still had leftnover mana
---
If they had a constructed mode that changed every 2 hours to the effects of a different brawl, it would honestly be the best mode in the game
---
I was so happy to have an online car game that was fun that I just hoped it would be great. I knew who Ben Brode was and I knew he would try to make a fun and casual feeling game, but I hoped he and the people at blizzard could make it that and give it the room to be a truly enjoyable competative game. But they didnt. Instead they leaned into "wacky" and misunderstood the fundamentals of balance. I should have know as early as piloted shredder that they were never going to balance the game in a satisfying way for competative play. I just hoped it was a mistake and that theyd learn from it but they didnt.
---
Is it annoying? Yes. Does it have weaknesses? Also yes
---
Can only discover classic and basic cards
---
The problem with the guy presenting it was, that he basically drew the short stick. He knew that it was shit, but couldn't do anything about it.
---
If you want to play your Ysera, I recommend resurrect Priest. Not a top tier deck for sure, but I'm winning with it at rank 5, so it can't be that bad. It's surprisingly cheap too, I only play 3 legendaries besides Ysera.
---
I think you underestimate how much playtime that adds up to. Especially those arena runs, which are a great way to get cards from the new expansion if you have the playtime to go through them. (I'm still trying to finish my free tavern brawl, let alone my first arena run of the expansion. I'm up to 5:1 on the brawl, need to finish that tonight if I can find the time.)
---
I don't dust anything except extras, including legendaries. (Until they hit wild, then I consider it, but only if they're really bad like I think I dusted Moorabi.) I don't dust cards unless I need the dust, otherwise I keep extras in case of nerfs/HoF. I complete probably 2/3 of my daily quests. I only make decks that I have most of the cards for already, when possible.
---
So whatever stupid tactics you seem to think I'm doing to drain all my dust, I'm not.
---
Even so, I generally have enough resources for about 2 decks per expansion tops.
---
I can pretty much guarantee those arena runs are the reason you have such abundant resources, and not everyone has time to grind those out like that.
---
will we see an increase in the frequency of newer tavern brawls or an increase in beloved tavern brawls from the past being the ones we revisit?
---
Yea, its kind of like 2.5 Expansions per year. Im sure it wont happen because, you know, Money.   
---
Thought in principle it would benefit the game immensely and could actually be profitable for them in the long run.
---
How about matching them together in a separate queue? :v
---
Wow, imagine that. The ‚Äúrapid cadence‚Äù of pumping out 3 expansions per year leaves little time for anything else. In other words, were focusing on our primary mechanism for taking your money and don‚Äôt have time to implement features that you want or that will make our game better. 
---
The sad part is that the design team probably has very little to do with this. Tons of smart and hardworking people work at Team 5 and surely want HS to succeed. The lack of new features, modes, and depth to HS is likely a function of upper management within Activision/Blizzard choking out ideas that aren‚Äôt in line with directly boosting profits.
---
Did wow classic get pvp before its third year after release?
---
Usually the best ideas are directly lifted from the creative members of its own community even if they tried to kill it off with the sc2 arcade.
---
ah ok i did not know they reset the data on old cards when a new ex-pack comes around thx for clarifying. I knew the power of Armagedillo i was just under i impression that it need more time to settle before it became more accurate.
---
Brann is not a leading card in highlander hunter. The only reason to play that deck is zephyrs. If brann didn‚Äôt exist highlander hunter would still be played
---
Well you found me
---
They say this literally every time it's brought up: "We have things in the pipeline! We swear we are working on it!"
---
5 years on and they are still in the pipeline.
---
&gt;Stayed busted after 3 nerfs
---
The second nerf pushed the deck to meme tier, the only wins you could get were opponents that didn‚Äôt know how to play the matchup. 
---
Fucking control warrior could out-pressure quest rogue at that point.
---
In addition to this, it was actually well designed, as it was meant as a meta check for greedy combo and control decks. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs also why people hated it, because it‚Äôs _sooo_ unfair to not be able to combo every opponent you fight, and everyone knows how fun and interactive exodia mage was.
---
The majority of the Year of the Raven was way worse than this.
---
I am still having fun but I will probably give magic arena a try . I hope they have good characters and story.
---
tL;dr: Capitalism.
---
That's honestly why I hate all the whine posts so much, though this post is clearly not one of those. It's like the whole concept of HS being a business is lost on some people. Or, even if they do somewhat acknowledge that, they don't make the next step connection that OP here has: Things that generate revenue get pushed up the queue, QoL stuff/fan requests/non-essentials are pushed down the queue. That is the state of gaming today in the mainstream. If the Dev isn't an Indie, the team likely answer to a person or people whose job it is to maximize shareholder wealth. That's what businesses do and it isn't even "greed", it's just their mandate.
---
Solid post, OP.
---
From someone who is currently succeeding only with homebrewed Quest Rez Priest: It's strong against Warrior but the DK can still go suck a Murloc : )
---
Agreed
---
the game is free. there is no need to complain this much.
---
I mean, for a huge game with a pretty big esports scene to not have a tournament 5 years after launching is ridiculous if you ask me. Watching the Blizzcon tournament where they still have to make use of the homemade solution is just painful when you know how much money this game makes.
---
It‚Äôs only fun when your deck wins. I usually just shove one or two cards in for fun
---
Elise was far from trash, I don't think you remember LoE meta correctly
---
Are you going to add monk as a new class?
---
I second this
---
I have a profound sense of regret after reading this gibberish. Thanks, OP.
---
70% of epics is more than enough, half the epic set is useless or only used in just 1 very specific deck type.
---
And 60% of the legendaries ain't that bad considering the same, i think with disenchanting golden cards and the duplicates you can have every main/good legendary
---
I read that in 2014.
---
Spiteful Summoner and Ultimate Infestation / Mind Control
---
And what if, after two years of seeing these cards dominate the meta, there was a format where you could keep playing those cards while still letting new cards feel fresh and exciting?
---
This is disgusting I dont like looking at it and it offends me Ree.
---
I think you‚Äôre right. Like I said, the game is probably more balanced than it has been in years. And there have been a few things - like card buffs- that are really nice new additions.
---
A new class AAA game costs $60. The amount of work for a design studio to put that game together is much less than what it takes to put out an expansion. For that amount of money, I would expect the full set of cards AND any Adventure that is produced.
---
Iksar's response to what?
---
Well if that's what you meant, the solution is that we *all* stop being complacent about it. We take action. We throw Bobby Kotick into the ocean.
---
Coz they've been saying this for years but there's like no features coming out. Last major feature added was Dungeon Run.
---
It doesn‚Äôt lose to every common deck. It‚Äôs not a T1 deck. Sure. But saying anything not T1 isn‚Äôt viable is wrong. 
---
I will stop now because you don‚Äôt seem to understand the difference definitions of the words discussed. So enjoy your T1 decks and I‚Äôll enjoy my viable decks at rank 5 floor ;)
---
I mean, sure. But there is a Highlander Mage deck that is more control oriented than aggro, so why not base the list on that?   
---
You could have something like this:   
---
* Flash of Light
---
* Cathedral Gargoyle
---
* Firetree Witchdoctor  
---
* Lighforged Blessing
---
* Sir Finley of the Sands 
---
* Sandwasp Queen
---
* Sound of Bells
---
* Subdue
---
* Wild Pyromancer
---
* Zeyphrys the Great
---
* Aldor Peacekeeper
---
* Bronze Herald
---
* High Priest Thekal
---
* Blessing of Kings
---
* Consecration
---
* Equality
---
* Dragonmaw Scorcher
---
* Dragon Speaker
---
* Glowstone Technician
---
* Shrink Ray
---
* Zilliax
---
* Khartut Defender
---
* Pharaoh's Blessing
---
* A New Challenger
---
* Crowd Roaster
---
* Tiron Fording
---
* Lay on Hands
---
* Archivist Elysiana 
---
* Nozari
---
* Shirvallah, the Tiger  
---
I don't have all the cards for a list like this (missing Nozari among a couple epics), but it seems like it might be able to win a few games.
---
Kindly go fuck yourself
---
That's actually exactly what this is guy literally saying. Perhaps he's using hyperbole when he says it, but the point is he'd rather ignore the changes that have been made, as if they were insignificant, and complain about the things they didn't do.
---
What I love about other games PR/Dev teams is when they post comments or answers on Reddit to people. It's fun to find them and bring answers from the teams and makes it more personal. Games that do this well are games like clash Royale and Terraria and sometimes even league of legends, to name a few. The reason that is not an option is actually so dumb and disappointing to me.
---
When I started playing hearthstone I was so hooked. Then I saw how much I had to pay or grind to get a good deck.
---
After 1 month I said, nope. Fuck off, and went back to overwatch. I wasn't able and wanted to pay for overpriced digital cards if I had games like overwatch where I pay one time and all characters and maps are free for me to use and developers update it regularly. It isn't a system that milks me money just to get a good deck after each expansion. I prefer to use my time on developing skills in a fun game that just asked my money once 
---
Just my take on this
---
&gt; would you prefer that they announce a feature then get super upset if it doesn't pan out?
---
You mean like tournament mode?
---
So like when heartyhst first came out lol? That was nice.
---
If you take even a modest perusal of my comment history, you‚Äôll see I‚Äôm usually a defender of the game, so find someone else to call hyperbolic or whiny. 
---
Wither and wilt is accurate by objective metrics. Viewership has collapsed, earnings have collapsed year-to-year, and pro-player engagement is fading. It‚Äôs also accurate by my own subjective metrics; most of my friends have moved on and my own interest has flagged. 
---
So yeah, I stand by the phrase.
---
Thanks.
---
Nowhere did I ever claim it needed to be a tier 1 deck to be ‚Äúviable‚Äù, and nowhere did I say meme decks are bad. Nice strawmen you got there. 
---
Stop making arbitrary definitions for words, and stop deluding yourself.
---
How long will dis go on
---
RARE OR BETTER!!!
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a good example of it. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. People have always been pissed. Every game community has complaints.
---
This is not just regular complaints.
---
Only the mammoth is true. We had ravens in the Year of the Kraken and the Year of the Mammoth, and there was a Kraken before Standard years were a thing.
---
That makes sense, but sucks that it‚Äôs been so long and stuff we keep asking for doesn‚Äôt get added.
---
So call me omega male.
---
I remember the same response 3 years ago.
---
The leeching nerf still hurts my soul.
---
Quest Highlander Shaman is pretty fun. Two perfect cards? Yes please.
---
I'm also messing with a Quest Bomb Shaman. Summon a bunch of Goblin Bombs with double battlecries and then a Mossy Horror to kill them. Then do a double battlecry Undataker for a "12 damage to enemy hero" deathrattle. If they manage to survive that, then Shudderwock to repeat both.
---
If I'm bring 100% honest I could see going as high as 150 on a set I'm really excited about, but at 100 I'd give most sets a shot.
---
nitoryu
---
lol yeah.  I should clarify that I got my preorder 1, a quest free one and the first 1 in 10 packs.  But after that I opened 137+ (probably 145 now) and have gotten only 3 additional legendaries. So I'm average probably 1 in 36 packs.
---
What exactly does this achieve though ?
---
I understand your sentiment but they did ‚Äòblow it‚Äô in the complacency stakes. Mediocrity and lack of innovation sit on the throne so don‚Äôt question it?
---
The only reason I haven't switched to MTG is a combination of sunk cost fallacy with Hearthstone and the fact that I'm not willing to jump into another goddamn shitty "pay 2 have fun" scheme. MtG is a better game but the business model was shitty with paper, and worse digitally. 
---
Card games can be a lot of fun but the toxic combination between it and gambling is unbearable for me now. I'll buy card games that give me the whole fucking game, I'm not willing to fuck around getting cards peicemeal randomly over time/money. 
---
Paying even 50 dollars are not getting every card of a new set... That's fucking trash and there's no good excuse for it besides that human brains are fucking suckers for cheapass psychological tricks.
---
Ok
---
No sadly :/
---
Finley isn't at fault. Paladin has NO WIN CONDITIONS.
---
Ruben #22702 80g EU trade.
---
You show, i will go first.
---
As far as I know in some tournaments they don't have open decklists, since I have watched firebat play in some and when he already won someone played an inervate and then conceded and he said that was a big misplay since it gave him so much intel for their next match.
---
I doubt that MTG Arena will ever have a mobile client.  Things aren't dumbed down enough for that.  Artifacts and enchantments would basically need to stack in a specific location as they do in Eternal.  You can make unlimited creatures in MTG.  Could you imagine Field of the Dead decks being played on mobile?
---
By business decisions I didn't mean every decision the company makes, but decisions that are focused on the bottom line.
---
People are actually criticizing you BECAUSE you are reposting. It's like those nozari placeholders that have been posted a gazillion times. When you explain something over and over you get annoyed. You trying to be a smartass doesn't help it either.
---
Banning a card for being overpowered and meta-centralizing is something that happens in every card game though
---
You can DM me whats coming in the future, I wont tell anyone! I swear!
---
Response to what?
---
It's unfortunate, because it's trading short term profits for long term stability.
---
If Blizzard had hired an extra small team in 2017 (or expanded Team 5) they could have slowly but surely implemented a few game modes and QoL improvements by now. Hearthstone already felt a lot fresher when we got a single really good PvE mode in the Dalaran Heist.
---
Sometimes these formats aren't even that much additional work to implement. Magic's pauper format (common rarity cards only), for instance, is quite popular and was completely unofficial until very recently. When it did become official, Wizards of the Coast (game makers) just had to do a little bit of research work into banning cards. They didn't have to redo any online infrastructure for it because the cards already existed.
---
Just search up ‚ÄúFind a friend‚Äù on this subreddit and you can find one who is willing to trade with you.
---
Blizzard definitely blew it. They were doing really well, and had some great ideas for the game (original adventurers, brawl). But they also introduced some terrible ideas to the game (Removed adventures, 3 sets of packs each year, Keeping the base set evergreen but nerfing or removing many of the popular cards). Now I can't bring myself to look at the cards in the free packs I got from the latest set. I'm just not interested in this game at all anymore.
---
But how does he stay so fit?
---
honestly, even shadowverse is less bad than this game and magic arena is great fun to play, I'm sadly too stupid for it
---
don't ask questions just consume product and then get excited for next products
---
Why play bomb warrior when you can play control warrior with shiny new tools?
---
I think it is less draw dependent than reno, because the aggro meta is not that bad compared to patches etc.
---
So, I think he's actually great and the biggest reason highlander decks (my favorite) exist in this meta.
---
damn, is anyone from the hearthstone team thinking of becoming a politician? so many words that say literally nothing
---
maybe make it an option to show your hand
---
Sure. But you also made a lower tempo play last turn than you could have. 
---
Most players don‚Äôt understand tempo. Thats *part* of the reason for so much frustration. 
---
(I‚Äôm not saying those other cards aren‚Äôt powerful, but playing poorly against them only makes matters worse.
---
Fair enough, I don't hate him as a player just not a fan of that content.
---
As far as I can tell, no card has been removed from being the result of a random effect. If it is a collectible card and it meets the criteria written on the card generator, it can be found.
---
Expect midrange hunter now feels more like a control deck rather then trying to fight and maintain board.
---
To apply the concepts others have already explained, when you are playing well past the point of having fun for the next drip of reward that‚Äôs when you know the games been created like a Skinner Box.  In hearthstone this would be found in systems like the daily quests, 10 gold drops, showing 1 card at a time, and the big flashy legendary reveals along with much more.
---
It's just an atrocious meta, caused by the bad dev team at Blizzard.  Ridiculous all the answers Warrior has and never has anything so stupid existed in a meta until this (playing since beta).  And yes I'm the exact same; See Rover turn 1 - concede.
---
&gt; The design philosophy behind it is quite incredible (props to the people behind designing and coding it) but it's an unfair, unbalanced card that should not exist.
---
I just crafted this card and tossed into a deck.  So far I've won 2 games with it (swung the match in my favor), and lose 2 that swung in their favor.
---
I'm not a fan of 50/50 coin flip cards to whoever plays their Zephrys last...win.
---
yeah, even if its done saying something about before offcial time by company could cause alot of trouble.
---
Capitano#21548; EU server; Trade. You show, I can go first.

Looking for good players to add! BT: Extern#11975
---
&gt;like modern in MTG
---
... wild?
---
I choose to believe that the +1 attack comes from the scarab he‚Äôs riding.
---
Grow up
---
It isn't fun to lose all the time with a fun deck. If you've seen hearthstone mishaps, I've missed that aspect of playing the game. Just a dumb deck that you can laugh at cause it is surprising that it works.
---
Chuckled
---
&gt; Adress that. Blizzard. 
---
They adressed it by making the game even more expensive. This year is much stingier with giving out gold than the last (or the year before). Just compare how underwhelming the Ragnaros event was compared to before.
---
Adventures are way better value for the player my dude, that's why they were stopped
---
Were you playing a homebrew pet deck or an actually competitive deck in wild?
---
The expansion is great, there‚Äôs complaining about how little new features are implemented and also about how greedy the current state is.
---
I feel for you my dude.
---
the whole deckslot thing is ridiculous. my idea for it would be: on the first page you see all 9 classes. then you click it and have 9 deck slots for that class. that wouldnt even need new UI and we instantly could have enough deck slots for wild+standard AND have it well organized, without the "cant change order of decks" thing. 
---
that would be such a small change, but would improve the quality of the game by a lot (at least for me, who likes playing many different decks, without deleting them all the time, because of missing deck slots lol)
---
Wild is nothing like modern.
---
Wild is more like legacy or vintage
---
Great online CCG's existed before HS, like Shadow Era.  It's biggest advantage has always been that it based on one of the largest, longest running, most well renowned PC gaming franchises in history.  You slap a different theme on this exact same game and it would have gone nowhere from the beginning.
---
Not sure why you mention League or DOTA?  They are the exact same genre and market share and listing both runs contrary to your entire point.  One of them even used the same franchise to get popular as Hearthstone did.
---
Why should Blizzard do anything?  People still keep shoveling money at them regardless.  Spending money that wont be recouped?  I remember last year people complaining about the meta too, and the year before that, and before that.  They always come back and Blizzard posts record numbers.
---
Not to mention the people leaving are leaving over things like the current meta.  Improvements people have been asking for for years like a tournament mode wouldn't bring these players back, so it's still a terrible investment for Blizzard to make.
---
But if you want to quit the game, please do.  That is literally the only way to get them to fix anything.  I haven't spend a dime on this game since ONIK was released since I refuse to pay for any skinner boxes.  Welcome to the club, sorry you didn't wise up sooner before throwing thousands of dollars on a gambling addiction.
---
I wouldn't say its a bad counter play at all.
---
Its won me matches when I played properly, and lost it when I waited too long.
---
Pulling a [[Twisted Nether]] late game when I lose board control swung the game in my favor.
---
Its a swing card.  Kind of like Reno was.
---
If you don't like don't play. Pretty easy solution
---
Future content is on our radar.
---
&gt; Now what I am not sure about is whether the additions made to the dungeon crawl formula in the heist warranted a $20 price tag.
---
Imho it's not remotely worth the money or gold. They mostly added *grind* with Dalaran Heist. I found the mechanics from Monster Hunt more interesting and it didn't costed me 20 bucks. And delayed packs from a weeks old expansion don't feel that rewarding, not to mention the joke that Zayle was.
---
better idea: throw the entire ruling capitalist class in the ocean
---
And this is something that I've learned the hard way.  Don't play a wide board.
---

---
Yes, Blizzard should pull a Yu-Gi-Oh and just powercreep everything to force people to buy new cards. Then this board would bitch about everything being expensive.
---
A better version of this post would explain why it could be a good answer at times.
---
What‚Äôs your rank ? What tournament have you won ?
---
If even the best player in the world says boom is an issue in the current format, then who the f are you mister rank 49 random to say that it is fine ??
---
And don‚Äôt talk to me if you‚Äôre going to say ¬´¬†jUsT pLaY MecThuN itS EZASY¬†¬ª
---
f2oger btw
---
I created a horror with Rain of Toads and Lightning Storm. Hero Power then Summon the Horror just for fun, and yes I won the game.
---
Does it matter? Big priest is a problem for almost every deck in wild, there might be a few niche decks that can counter it, but you have to actively build against it in a format that is supposed to support a high number of deck archetypes. You run into them from ranks 20-master, there is no avoiding them. it's the most unhealthy meta I've ever seen in this game and I've been playing since beta.
---
Well actually you are, my guess is the negative vibe on this sub comes from a vocal 1% of dissatisfied gamers. I love this expansion and don‚Äôt understand the rage going on.
---
Blizzard exists to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. That's it. They don't pay taxes.
---
This is just a golden Whizbang I got from the pack, I‚Äôm too poor to even create a budget deck.
---
Maybe if your deck didn't do nothing for the first 6 turns you would have been able to punish his slow start?
---
EXCEPTION_RENO_NOT_RICH_YET

(typo, meme is ruined)
---
We need another tavern brawl but instead of Championship Decks we need all "cancer decks" from around the years
---
that's respectable. hopefully one of these days youtube will change things up a bit so people aren't encouraged to just clickbait and stretch videos just over 10 minutes for the money.
---
A lot are overt consequences of being digital. The board limit, lasting damage, and partial mulligan are the most obvious. but almost every other keyword or ability is much harder to do in real life.  Adapt, Choose, Discover, Echo, Magnetic, Recruit, and Joust would be the most obvious.
---
Umm yea that's what I said I'm doing. Wow you're a real genius aren't you? Telling me to do something I said I'm doing in the post.
---
Try putting the title of the game after the youtubers name if they have a pretty generic name.
---
For instance "Trump Hearthstone" because typing trump into youtube will give you alooooot of videos lol
---
Isn‚Äôt that illegal? Any armchair lawyers want to weigh in?
---
Adventures were cancer. You had to spend weeks farming for the gold for them at a really inefficient rate, or pay up. I don't miss them.
---
This makes me wonder did they design these cards with the intention of Baku and Genn still being in standard?
---
Man, I have to disagree with your sentiment. This year has been great. Rise of Shadows, New Classic Cards, Dalaran Heist, Rise of Mechs, Midsummer Fire Fest. We just had the most packed 4 months of HS ever. I stayed interested, at no point since the rotation have things felt stale.
---
I do play wild, so maybe my patience for meta change is greater than a standard players. There's an amazing variety of decks in wild. I've been switching my 'main deck' about once a month. I made legend with a Togwaggle Druid, as stupid as that is. I just got 500 priest wins with a Quest-Mindblast Combo Priest. I think next I'm going to work on refining N'zoth rogue.
---
TLDR: I feel like I've got plenty of stuff to be doing. Plus, more solo content is coming in a month.
---
Oooooo, I like that! Goes goof with the desert vibes, but maybe theme it more around the beating sun of the desert, so maybe Sunkeeper Tarim?
---
Yea, I stopped buying into expansions because it became clear Blizzard had no intention of ever putting resources into anything *other* than expansions. And yea, I can totally understand that content releases as frequent and polished as Hearthstone expansions takes a lot of resources, but that really isn't what I care about. "It already consumes a lot of resources" isn't an acceptable response to mass complaints that the game is being underdeveloped for a game as financially successful as Hearthstone. Yea the game already consumes a ton of resources **give it more.**
---
The standard response to all this is "vote with your wallet." First, I've already done so by no longer purchasing Hearthstone (or any Blizzard content). Second, players voting with their wallet is no guarantee that Blizzard will enact meaningful change. As we've seen with other Blizzard titles (and other companies when their games under perform), there is a good chance that if Hearthstone ever stopped being profitable, Blizzard would simply reduces development to Hearthstone to a trickle and milk the remaining player base rather than seek to recapture what it lost. I don't want to see a game I used to love completely destroyed, and the players who remain exploited with empty promises.
---
Academic is not a classic card
---
If only you read a card before playing it you would know that Zephrys' pool is made by Classic and Basic sets
---
&gt; YES! WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS WITH THE PIZZA ANALOGY!
---
It is still free. 
---
No, don't complain. Stop crying about a restaurant you've spent 10,000 hours at. If you don't like it, stop going there.
---
Electra recasts the base copy, if I remember.
---
I remember formats that held the block though. Rebels, Merfolk, Mill, Allies, Poison Counter, fuckin Elf still holds strong. Hearthstone doesn‚Äôt have close to thirty years of sets to pull from yet. 
---
Big Priest is a problem but it‚Äôs a problem that will work itself out
---
The shine on that knee is impeccable!
---
You know, this comment made me realize... I actually don‚Äôt know much about the meta of Legends. (Though I don‚Äôt know much about Hearthstone‚Äôs meta-terms, either. Is there a glossary or something?)
---
A small price to pay for classic wow
---
Generally it takes a few weeks longer for the budget decks to emerge on the deck sites.  Early experimentation is driven more by the whales  who have large collections as the wise budget players wait for the meta to stabilize a bit.
---
Whizbang is particularly awesome for the first week or two, try out some new decks as the midcost and budget decks form.
---
He's so not a pain in the ass in wild. I almost never ever encounter him
---
I am sorry, but I fear that this won't work. This is Reddit, not the official channel of communication between a player and Blizzard, so they are not required to see and respond to posts made here. Thing is since the first day of hearthstone people like you already exist. Things likes this already happened. But in the end? Nothing changed. Dr. Boom was never nerfed. Fiery war axe and ancient of lore were nerfed but people didn't ask for it. I commend you on your efforts, but I hate seeing history repeats itself. Had you put less effort into this, you wouldn't hurt yourself too much from disappointment if things didn't go your way.
---
Best comment ever
---
Also take the money you make from doing what you're good at and use it to buy the innovators. Then repeat until their is nobody left to acquire and then just do what you do best and put out the same product again and again.
---
What? They increased from 9 to 18 years ago üòÇ
---
I've been playing the game since the beta. They've added a lot of features and improved the game. All of it for a free to play game. The people around here are out of their minds.
---
Sure man, but they haven't added any features to the game in *5 years*. "We're working on things" for the sixth or seventh time doesn't hold as much weight anymore.
---
Because the game players are really impatient and think they deserve something that they do not.
---
https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1301921-budget-quest-lackey-shaman
---
I also have Zoo Warlock on hearthpwn thats maybe better and is 1600 dust. I hit rank 5 playing these two decks.
---
To me, why this feels different is that we may be very well coming onto two straight years of year over year decline in both revenue and monthly active users in Hearthstone. That coupled with a multi-year decline in Twitch viewership is showing that the game declining in popularity is more than just a blip. People justified it last year because of s decrease in power level and getting bored of cards from KFT / K&amp;C, but now that both sets are rotated out it‚Äôs really notable that the popularity of the game is even lower than last year.
---
This is my favourite set in the past couple years, but to everyones knowledge not even 10% of players can afford playing half of the decks.
---
I don't disagree with your title, that the outrage over this expansion came much faster than normal.
---
But you do hurt your argument with the descriptions of your proposed solutions. You make a lot of assumptions about Blizzard's tech and implementations. For example, Blizzard has repeatedly said they want to expand basic backpacks in WoW (something that you'd think would be easy) but they simply cannot do it because of how the game is implemented. And it's silly to assume Blizzard just "has code lying around" that can be ported from one game (made in a custom engine) to another (made in Unity). That's not even to mention the fact that guilds would need to serve a purpose in the game, so you'd need to add a ton of new systems based around the guilds.
---
Blizzard should add much needed support and features to the game. Definitely. But don't underestimate how much time and resources the changes you suggest would take.
---
Going on a loop here
---
Hmm, did you consider that the people who work on all those things you mentioned have nothing to do with feature development?
---

&gt;They literally do fucking nothing. NOTHING!
---
Get a grip, dude. Go play another game if you would like. This game is still fun.
---
Not a game developer, but a coder in big corporation. It is 100% true. Our PO is pretty cool and fights corporate to allow us to do stuff like that.
---
Just give us the fuckin achievements, god dammit. People will want to get achievements for the heroes that they don't usually play, so they will be motivated to grow their collections, i.e. buy more packs. How is it not a win/win? Just roll us a fuckin bone, will ya? We've been your loyal customers for years, yeah, we're salty as fuck sometimes, but goddamit, you trying queuing in to turn 5 pocket galaxy a few times in a row and stay. 
---
So tired of this "in our pipeline" bullshit. Your pipeline sucks so much ass, even Mario wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.
---
Well your personal standard is improper from accepted writing standards. Writing the numerals is correct in those situations.
---
2 expansions means less money, so I doubt thatll ever happen.
---
There's no such thing as alpha wolf.
---
They only rehash Dungeon Run anyway. But they tasted blood when they saw that they can sell low effort content for 20 bucks. Thus we will see iterations of dungeon run for at least the next 2 years.
---
&gt; How can you count it?
---
By having eyes and a brain. 
---
&gt; game modes? graphic assets? Voice lines? narrative? the number of codes?
---
Yes, all of the above. Very little of Dungeon Run's content was created from scratch specifically for Dungeon Run. The vast majority of cards, including art and audio, were borrowed from existing constructed cards. The vast majority of Dungeon Run's code is borrowed from the main game. Almost nothing in Dungeon Run, or any Dungeon-like modes since then, was created from scratch specifically for those modes. Most content was simply taken, a lot was recycled or repurposed. 
---
Comparing it to a game that was created from scratch with completely original assets is ludicrous. You don't sound half as smart as you think you do.
---
I believe this is as tight as it gets, he picked it from Elysians, and we were definitely nearing the 45 turn timer.
---
I understand your points and agree with lots of what you say, however to say they have done literally nothing and reiterate it constantly doesn‚Äôt really communicate anything other than you are a hostile, angry customer whose valid points get dismissed. Also, it‚Äôs important to note that Hearthstone‚Äôs playerbase is still much larger than that of games you listed such as CounterStrike so using that as a baseline example isn‚Äôt the greatest. HS still has a player count that many devs dream of despite the decline. League of Legends has done a great job though despite dicey decisions from Riot over the years.
---
Oasis Surger?
---
My piece is that I would love new features and think the game should have several of the suggested features that pop up constantly on this subreddit. Failing that, though, they really need to address the balance concerns about Mage and Warrior if they don‚Äôt want this expansion to burn out quickly. We‚Äôre seeing so many complaints right now because the expansion period has a lot of issues despite all the cool new cards it has introduced. 
---
Naturally, people should not treat the developers like they‚Äôre not people. But we can and should criticize Hearthstone for its faults. You don‚Äôt have to single people out to point out the problems that exist in this game. For me personally, there isn‚Äôt enough interesting stuff this time around to keep my interest besides Arena, and so I hope for balance changes to be pushed on the double. Ultimately, people complain because they hope and think the game can be better than it currently is.
---
It's because the 18 deck slots are hard coded in the original code, and they either can't figure out how or are too far behind in tech debt to fix it.
---
&gt; Blizzard never innovate anything they just do user-friendly super polished versions of other ideas that already exist.
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaah
---
One of the things I miss about Magic the Gathering was all the painted alters of cool cards. It‚Äôs a shame we can‚Äôt really install legal-ish art packs into the game from third party people.
---
Woooooshhhhhhhhh
---
Doubt it. Don't underestimate how terribly optimized the game is. My computer is hardly good nowadays, but it can take me a minute to do 3 flip effects in a row.
---
That‚Äôs an illogical assumption. They‚Äôre asking for the hearthstone devs to put the money they‚Äôre making back into developing the game. They want proper responses to what they‚Äôre asking, and they want more features to *actually* be implemented. Not just hinted at. This will help free-to-play people as well. Stop arguing against something that benefits you. You‚Äôre making yourself look like an ass.
---
OP is a sore loser
---
Dudes what‚Äôs Oasis surger gonna do to 50/50 worth of stats
---
No, nothing is different.
---
sorry not sorry
---
It wouldn't be such a terrible idea if they were capable of delivering on time and without completely fucking it up, at least some of the time.
---
No. The best ways to learn the meta is from twitch, YouTube, Reddit, and your own experience. I regret having AW be the meta in which I got serious and climbed to top 300 with. My aggro mage did it's best but I wasn't very happy doing so. This was later inflamed by the fact that they didn't balance patch the game until around the time of the next expansion. Very uncool. From what I  hear the meta for MoE is midrange bm using that storm atronach summoning card
---
All i'm saying is that they are saying that the solution was to hire more people, as if they aren't already hiring tons of people.
---

Not gonna lie buddy, you came at a bad time.....

No. Is that the problem? Too many nice legendaries that they aren't giving away for free?
---
They hated him because he told them the truth.
---
it legit is a bug cuz I wasn't disconnected.  my opponent was spamming emotes
---
Is he really my friend if he wastes my time with this analogy? 
---
Also he did not have to pay for it.
---
Yes, the expansion was dissapointing and I was having a miserable time. New decks are frustrating and boring. Four months of saving gold for virtually nothing to work on, dust wise (and I was very lucky with the number of legendaries opened).
---
So I decided it was time to acnowledge HS is not a good game. I nuked muy collection (no cards, no dust) and uninstalled. Good riddance.
---
Im dumbass
---
Sorry, you are correct, I remember having CC in hand. I honestly don't recall what the 3rd card was. I just remember not seeing Silence and picking Flamestrike with Blizzard being next to it. Logic would say it was Twisting Nether based on the other two options but I don't believe it was because I had a minion on the board and Zephyrs generally won't give you Twisting Nether if you had a big minion on the board.

Enemy topdecked lethal on him, eh?
---
I mean, on the one hand I get what your saying. On the other hand......it has been 6 YEARS! Like, I get that things are probably harder to do then they first appear, but it's pretty obvious at this point the answer with a lot of things as to when will it get done is "Never". See the new card "bug" (which is apparently just a feature at this point), Tournament Mode that has been asked for since the game's release, or the "more deck slots" meme which has been asked for.....well been asked for since we got 18 deck slots basically.
---
That things are harder than they seem I get. That it's just impossible after literally years of "development" (and that is a generous term to use with regards to this game) is just crazy to me.
---
Point is they have no reason to work on 10 concepts to scrap some, it is pretty clear what needs to be done at this point. Also they shouldn't be an average small scale team.
---
Saying "FoN+savage roar druid" is like saying "druid druid", don't think that there was a single druid deck that wouldn't run at least one copy of the combo before the nerfs.
---
Quest Rogue with Tess also dominates Control Warrior.
---
Haha, you won't admit that it's okay for somebody to complain if they are unhappy with something they have paid for :)
---
Guess we're done then, nice argument there.

&gt;Tough luck if you don't enjoy the deck, there is no refund.

Every single tier 1-3 deck in existence is played by multiple streamers, thousands of times over. If you are so concerned about a deck, watch it for an hour or two before committing any gold/cash.

Read. You're just complaining. Better cards to complain about like Mad Doc Boom that can single handedly change a game than whinging on bout highroll cards.

I don't understand how can every deck be measured by the standard of whether or not it can beat Control Warrior and still consider it not overpowered

It was imprisoned for being unplayable.

My favorite deck this expansion.  I was heartbroken when my free quest was warrior and then I pulled a warlock quest. I decided to use all my dust to make the rogue quest and I've been having a blast since. I even specifically chose the cards myself and I'm happy with the result. I managed to go back to rank 7 after I didn't play that much this past expansion.
---
you know that blizzard could simply give more cards with the adventure right? It's not a law that they can only give you 1 card for battle or something like that.
---
Complaining about the speed in which you get free shit is the weakest.
---
&gt; just stop pumping out so many cards. Instead make 2 expansions a year and inbeetwen push out a bigger update that includes game changes such as new game modes, QoL improvements and so on
---
I agree totally, and I think that the variety of the old Adventure sets helped the game over a yearly cycle massively. They introduced a different way to play hearthstone to the other two expansions and they provided value for f2p and, like myself, almost f2p players. I also agree with Blizzard's decision not to make new adventures, because actually people had had enough of them after Karazan. But two years on, maybe it's now time for a new Adventure set, just to keep things fresh, one with card rewards unlike the KotFT, although that was still cool. I'd suggest that the community now feels the same way about dungeon runs as it used to feel about adventures.

played control warrior with a ysera to outvalue the mirror, went 7-3. 3 losses were to mech hunter which I expected, quest shaman which discovered storm bringer to turn a board of 1/1s into the best evolve board I've ever seen, and the 3rd game was against control mage where his kalecgos survived a 7 minion brawl. won every mirror, including a 'priest' who lazul'd dr boom and elysia only lost because of those two RNG swings. 
---
still fuming about RNG in a competitive card game so i guess i was definitely playing hearthstone
---
Do you only definine I win cards as literal Mechathun decks or other cards that instantly end the game that turn?

What I mean by this is any card that grants a ridiculous advantage that might as well be instantaneous victory. Barnes does not destroy the enemy hero when played, but he often grants such a large advantage that he basically won the game on his own unless your opponent is able to perform a sort of miracle - basically, any card that almost always wins the game, directly or indirectly.

I feel that the options I gave are fair examples. A board full of murlocs, especially when some have charge and all have massive attack boosts, can instantly close out an otherwise competitive, or even favored for the opponent game. Rexxar would quite often provide such stron beasts and lifesteal, and his boardclear make such an impact, that it was rare to take him out afterwards. Dr. Boom provides such insane value between his passive and hero power that it's virtually impossible to take the board or outvalue him afterwards. Barnes, similarly, provides such an early boost to your ressurect pool that it's very rare to make a successful comeback.

I don't think this is a loose definition at all. A card that singlehandedly almost always removes your opponent's chance of winning is an "I win" to me. It doesn't need to literally kill the opponent on turn 4 to have the same effect.

I wish I would get 1 euro for every time I have to link that thread. You could call me Reno Jackson cause I'm gonna be rich...

I don‚Äôt agree with him. He told me to give him more reasons why the game is getting increasingly expensive (at the end of a 2 page wall of text disagreeing with the sentiment) so I figured he‚Äôd appreciate me linking him to further rationale for why the game is getting more expensive.

Flair checks out. Kids, don't do drugs, and don't snipe Kripp. It's bad for his hairline.
