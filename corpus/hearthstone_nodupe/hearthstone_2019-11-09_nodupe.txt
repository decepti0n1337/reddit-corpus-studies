They really aren't, as Mage has already had most of those spells and they were never used.
---

---
History has proven those cards to not be effective
---
It's a glorified tavern brawl, has little in common with normal HS and overall it's too RNG heavy for it's own good. It's even more random and less deep than normal hearthstone. Especially the meta is so shallow that I would consider it solved right now.
---
It got changed and noticed by ppl on some forum. Google it.

Pretty much agree with you but druid is fine imo. Zephyrs is such a bullshit card and priest is just mindless removal bullshit. I hate priest more than anything.
---
I’m on iOS and I can’t squelch without CTD. So you are not alone.
---
This game really has the worst milestones
---
Imho nope. They are just very grindy with mediocre content otherwise. It's not worth it for the rewards alone.
---
The old adventures like League of Explorers were great though!
---
Don’t forget Arcane flakmage
---
So you don't think the carrot of early access is a major contributor to the spike?  I myself almost never watch streams yet I've got one going now simply for the chance.  
---
As to the new mode I find people like yourself who claim "this mode is too RNG reliant to be ever considered competitive" yet HS itself is competitive and is easily just as RNG dependent if not more so.  
---
Take decks like quest/resurrect priest or quest druid - completely less skill and knowledge required than BG and their success comes completely down to luck.  
---
I'd say BG is a breath of fresh air and the skill barrier is a lot higher than the naysayers would imply.
---
only one week later  why are you saying 5?
---
If you read my comment I said we've had some of these spells before, not all.
---
And the lack of shamans using hex, proves how the meta's shifted away from spells with effects like this.
---
Jeff Kaplan gives me hope for the future of gaming at Blizzard. His remarks on Overwatch two also show very much how he cares for the players.
---
My assertion was not that 90% of cards are critical.  My assertion is that to get all critical cards, you will have to pay total cost &gt; 90% of cost needed to complete the collection.
---
This number ($4,513) does not take into account, 3 wins gold, doing quest, free card give aways from events and expansion releases, bundles or the weekly free pack from brawl and arena runs. If you have been playing for years earning the gold for packs makes that number is alot lower. Also you don't need every card. If you just want to play standard only factor the last three expansions. New players can make a budget deck and farm gold for cards like most of us did to help negate some cost.
---
You are so good luck with two golden marganis !
---
The mode is obviously ready to go. Making it a limited release tied to preorder is just a money grab. 
---
Downvote me all you want.
---
Whatever it was, it hasn't left anything in the history.
---
Umm cause it’s the weekend and everyone that can’t play has had the mode spoiled??
---
dont worry this is very possible since they will likely nerf every playable card, and give you a dust refund !
---
Beta is supposed to be to work out bugs...not encourage preorder sales for an unrelated mode.
---
Been playing since 2016 Winter and I'm glad that I've been playing ever since and I would never see myself getting into this game so late.
---
Ya it gets boring to watch after some time.
---
Looks like you had a bad experience with Battlegrounds, so you're going around bashing it. It's actually one of the least rng-based autobattlers out there. Skilled players can make top 4 80% of the time. Something like that wouldn't be possible if randomness were such a huge factor.
---
Hah nice :)
---
I miss the time of infinite rerolls at a certain time of the day
---
&gt;  I'd choose Hearthstone over BG because I want to play an strategic game, not a casino roulette.
---
And I'd say you are delusional if you don't think that's exactly what you are playing with most decks in HS.  
---
The only true skill parts are designing your own decks and arena.  
---
The rest is net decking decks that for the most part will rely on both their and their opponents RNG as to their success.  
---
The same about of skill of what to play when is no different as to which minions to swap/keep/buff in BG.  
---
They are both heavily RNG dependent and often matches are decided before they even begin ... we just don't know it yet.
---
Battlegrounds is boring to watch but it's a blast to play
---
If you concede turn 1 it doesn't count towards play, I tested it jsut to make sure, but if you play the game through win or loss it does count
---
It is because you are not playing Shaman.
---
There's probably some spousal legal thing that makes it ok, because of common property an what not.
---
Does this include the triple rewards? If I get a mama bear does that mean tier 6 people only have 5 more to pull from?
---
Spectral Pillager is a wild card, from Knights of the Frozen Throne
---
Could be a deathrattle that destroys a random murloc (or demon or beast or mech). It'd fit right in with the RNG clown fiesta that is battlegrounds, but any of them would make amalgam *much* worse since it'd always be a target.
---
ah my bad i didnt look at spectral pillager XD
---
And wanna of them was an evolve shaman who bmed you.  Seriously, who are these paste-eaters playing s-tier decks and bming like they just did something amazing win they win?
---
It's not the same without an empty the warrens for 15
---
You losing a lot doesn't stop my HSreplay showing 80% shaman at high ranks.
---
Yes the deck can be beaten. Yes the deck can draw bad. When we talk about what we don't like in the meta we aren't saying there is an unstoppable deck that owns everything. The complaints are that the meta is warped because there are so many people playing that class. That's on top of shaman having access to a high roll combo. 
---
I beat shaman a lot with my deck, but I still want more variety in my games. That's what the complaint is.
---
that meta shaman is so annoying
---
Is this from a game or did you find a 90’s recording of playboy tv?
---
Why do people keep peddling this "they were innocent!" lie? They KNEW what Blitz was going to do. They ALLOWED it to happen and even ENCOURAGED it.

For example poisonous and divine shield. Stoneskin Basilisk gets to terrorise yet another format \&gt;:D.

I have a deck in wild that relies on using ancestral call to summon Malygos from my hand that shitslap the opponent with cheap spells.
---
I've been added four times after some of the wins. 3 told me they were dying from laughter while 1 called me a dumbass for using a minionless deck and I only won because of luck.

A N’Zoth rogue betrayed me after I left them alive when I was playing Renounce Plot twist warlock. Ever since then I’ve had no mercy against you traitorous rogues. I played Duskfallen Aviana and they said thanks and killed me.
---
[deleted]
---
kiss him maybe he will turn into something.
---
Well, time to call it quits anyways as they are incapable of fixing their when it is clearly not fun due to very few certain cards. They had more than half a decade to learn, but they always knew better LUL
---
Last expansion we had long discussions about mana cheat. Now we got mogu with mutate and also evolve... Lunas is even broken at 7 due to fitting well into reno decks. 
---
Would not be surprised if highlander cards and shaman quest have to leave already next april. Cant even imagine how broken highlander must be at the end of a 2y rotation. Doubled battlecries sounds also a bit mental to have in the game for years. 
---
But it is also me, I just cannot stand seeing rogues and quest shaman with their random card generation anymore. And I doubt the dragon lackey who comes with a set of powercreeped dragons will make this any better. HS is just too expensive at this point for what it has to offer. It is also fairly pathetic that they sell cards the rotate in a half a year still cost the same as cards that will soon be release. Pack prices should adapted all three months or so. Cant be for real that they dont give ppl the option to return to HS unless they drop 500+ bucks on expansions with a half life of at best 12 months.

I would change Lyra for piloted shredder.
---
The rest is more or less right. For me, there was a time where I would clearly put baku and genn at the top. Every single game just starting with thier voices just inta-tilted me even before I got to play my first turn.
---
Do you have a link to the template?

I mean he (the guy you’re replying to) said that Kaplan didn’t actually say that but it was “implied”.

This isn't even hearthstone related. You just posted a playlist.
---
With vanish and sap to keep them from having a mech on board for snip snap to magnetize to it might not be so bad if they can't gat to pseudo charge in
---
That's not self-awareness, that's just interpretation. And for all we know, it's very uncharitable interpretation at that.
---
if you will have no strategy and planning you will end 8th every time
---
Vanish can actually be great against paladins. You usually return their 3/3 dudes to their hand making them 1/1 again and burning away the quartermaster as he was played last. Then they burn their next draw and have to dump 5 1/1s from their hand
---
&gt; To confuse everyone, call it SSSS
---
Gridman it is
---
The order of  most cards in each tier is not in best to worst.
---
I am aware I did it in a very complicated way, and it has no use in practical applications in Hearthstone, it was only for fun. You can eyeball the correct answer much quicker, like you did. With the equation I did you can insert any possible combination of draws, damages you need to do and so on.
---
0,5x^2 -(2N+1)x+(N^2 +N)-HP=0
---
The lowest solution to this equation will give you the maximum allowed number of cards in your opponents deck in order to deal HP damage with N draws.
---
The bug with showing incomplete decks is caused by having one normal and one golden copy of the same card in a deck. I copied a deck code of a broken deck and pasted it to the Notepad. I have 1 copy of normal Plagure of Death and 1 copy of golden one, and in the Notepad it says that I have 1x Plague of Death twice, instead of just 2x Plague of Death. When I try to paste the code back to Hearthstone, Hearthstone says that the code is broken.
---
This whole post is redundant then
---
"If I can't win with the deck it can't be that good"
---
&gt; At the moment that's one of the only decks in the game which I think is so overpowered that it's worth conceding against it instantly.
---
It's not, it's pretty bad in the current meta. It doesn't prey on greedy control decks anymore because they can now make multiple Zephrys and beat them in a long game.
---
!remindme 2 days
---
So you would rather spend 500 and sell for 250 than buy for 200? What sense does that make?
---
By the time you want to cash out of MTG you better pray that the expensive cards of your deck are still in standard otherwise the price tanks to a tiny fraction of what it was
---
I mean you're just wrong. Most of the cost in every expac is the legendaries and you don't need 90% of the legendaries from every expac.
---
I mean i get that its annoying and surely belongs on the list, im just arguing that  other account deleting examples are much more annoying to me personaly.Once operative hits the board i don't get nearly as annoyed then when any of the other tier one and even most of the tier 2 (shudderwock/baku) happen. ("Secret agent, coming through " is the voice line)
---
Isn't that the point though? Anyone who makes a tier list like this would have their own biases.

If you preorder both bundles and are still missing important cards then frankly you're retardedly spending your dust on garbage cards and that's completely your fault. I've had every playable meta deck for the last two years playing completely free, just stacking up 8k gold between expansions.
---
Other autobattlers have items, positioning, scouting(tft has carousel). 
---
AFAIK you cant get the game state from riot's api, so you need to get it via computer vision(probably why we dont even have an app that can record replays). Not sure about battlegrounds, but they may be able to track game state via game log, considering the similarity to dungeon run(even if they have to use computer vision, it is a lot easier, since the cards are shown at fixed locations on the screen). [Riot](https://www.riotgames.com/en/DevRel/teamfight-tactics-match-history) also explicitly said bot is not allowed.
---
I am just a lucky son of a bitch when it comes to opening free packs, so many legendaries that I just statistically should never have gotten. Honestly it's the only way I can play and i couldn't imagine trying to make a decent deck at this point without access to those cards. Newbies would be fucked, especially if they're cheap like me and refuse to spend a dime on hearthstone.

Both regular HS and battleground meta is trash, lol.

So? How was your run?

wait until you play enough and realize theres no depth

And Blizzard still won't care cause they made more money in a day with their 80 euro GIF pre orders than the average redditor makes in an entire year of working...

Ben Lee is the Game Director but (I am 90% sure) Ben Thompson is now the Team 5 Lead. He was promoted from Art Director to Creative Director last summer.

He's certainly the public face of the game, now, in any case.
---
&gt; No, what I'm saying isnt I'm not a fucking slave to video games like you.

That really hurts my dude, I too can post pictures of my dailies and no pre-orders, it also looks like you play 2x as much as me! Very cool!

https://imgur.com/a/6Q1ayCR
---
My gamer tag is also the same one From before.
---
That's part of the strategy. Juggling late game greed vs health total. Playing for the win vs top 4. It's really hard not to place top 4 if you just spam out decent early boards and chip people down, but you won't have late game power doing so.
---
Health is very much a resource. It's why patchwerk is a strong hero despite no board based benefit. You can prioritize late game from the start.
---
This is the right answer. He also needs to reach at least rank 25 in Standard ladder.
---
The only reason those decks win or lose to one card is because Skulking Geist is a horribly designed, massively polarized card

---
Funny that we can't even play the card if we don't destroy a beast with it if there's one on the field. Even if it's ours.
---
He’s evolved beyond his normal form. Now he grants you 9 legendaries and they’re all shifter zerus.
---
Some cards (like whizbang and zayle) cant be crafted until rank 25,  not aware that this was the case for sir finley, but maybe a bug. you might also have accidentally selected the golden version and don't have enough dust to craft that.
---
No, you're not lucky. The deck is receiving massive proportions of circle-jerk. It sees around 2-3% meta representation until you actually get into legend, then it spikes to 10-13%. It's not even close to as popular as people like to suggest.
---
Sure it can, I'll wait for that Trolden clip.
---
knife juggler?
---
no yogg-saron?
---
hella broken . i need that shit with all my matches.some people are fun to play with but some are just annoying
---
It might be but I think they are for specific regions too, I watch like 10hrs of krip with no drop but watched 45mins of thjs(I can’t remember the exact spelling) an got on so I think it may because he’s in Europe perhaps
---
Cant see unstable portal on the list. Sometimes you just wanted to concede if your opponent rolled a good unstable portal
---
Why updated it? Isn't it just your opinion?
---
Personally Dr Boom was totally ok. But Baku and Genn nearly made me stop playing the game. All decks we similar and synergies were boring as hell.

I don't own Voraxx :( but it would be SO sweet in the deck, wish I could craft it, but saving for Zephrys the Great right now :/ . I would take out a djinni (or a haunted creeper if not finding too much aggro) and add Voraxx.
---
Well, having to complete a quest, + 6 mana for a 6 dmg drain isnt comparable to leeroy when he was 4 mana and dealt 6 damage alone, as a neutral card, without needing to complete any quest whatsoever. Shamans cant normally finish the quest on 5 to play this combo on curve either, so this is basically something you will see arround turn 8+.
---
Compare any kind of 8+ mana possible combo to a single 8 mana card and it will always look stupid. Why play ragnaros when you can play leeroy + shadowstep + leeroy? Why play hero power + lifedrinker when you can play frostbolt and fireball and deal more dmg?
---
This is not a fair comparison. Yes, quest shaman right now is strong but not because they can burst you for 6 damage... Every single other deck in standard can do a similar stuff in power. The main problem with quest shaman is the chance of autowinning the match by rolling hare, mogu and evolve turn 4.
---
I think the problem isn’t that it can’t be taken seriously as an e-sport, I think that Blizz is putting **too much** emphasis on it becoming one.
---
 Not only are they forcing a scene, they are trying to recreate a traditional sports league. While certainly ambitious, I do wonder how long it can be sustained. Football, Baseball and Basketball can do it, but they have much lower requirements to entry, broader appeal, don’t exist within a medium that is constantly changing and exist without new balance patches.
---
Speak for yourself. Playing battlegrounds is the first time I have had fun playing this game in probably over a year. It’s refreshing and needed
---
Aww OK, I thought that it would be a fascinating observation if conceding after "power play" turns became more frequent when squelching is broken.
---
I would move raza and death knight rexxar into account delete, but still pretty good list. Well played sir
---
Oh Whoa!!! No Way!
---
No Brawl?
---
The thing is I get that, but it’s not even the same game.
---
All hail Brian Kibler, "The Dragonmaster"!

Good luck, I had a 4 legendary draft recently and went 1-3.
---
Hi. We don't care.
---
Regards,
---
Heartstone developers.
---
Sure, but it doesn't matter. Unless I am in legend, I am ranked against people with the same rank and stars as me, not against people with the same MMR, so MMR is meaningless until I get into legend.
---
1: zephrys should be higher
---
2: where's hadronox?
---
EDIT:
---
3: Dr. boom wasn't really annoying. Rexxar makes way more long term value and stupid combos
---
4: frost lich jaina needs to be higher.
---
5: obsidian statue and convincing infiltrator need to be on here, and probably at least "very annoying"
---
[removed]
---
That's why I mentioned Streamers and Players as well. And now players are already answering. Maybe if HS influencers will speak about it as well we have some chance. Sitting and bitching about the state of game does nothing so I might as well try to bring some awareness about the poor state of the format

Even though some expansions are rotating next April (witchwood, booms day and rastakhan), I'd advise you to buy packs from them one by one until you hit a legendary then when you finish all of them start saving for next one which drops December 10th. Don't craft anything for now as the current meta is based off some wild cards that rotated back to standard for an event. Good luck and have fun.

I'd put him in the not annoying box
---
Oh man Kobolds and Catacombs was a good one

From Mike Donais:
---
'Higher tavern tier gives you access to higher tier minions. There are 18 copies of each tier 1 minion and 15 copies of each tier 2 minion (and 13,11,9,6)'
---
And cardpool is shared.
---
In which case they should reconsider their dealings with that company.
---
Not gonna lie, I wish the Death Knight's were in standard.
---
That would just be ending operations in China period.  That's just how you do business in China as a media company, you have to go through a government approved company in China to operate.
---
Yeah, people who don’t screenshot can’t use golden cards. It’s a feature.
---
That’s definitely not how it works. See how well that worked for pro-HotS. You can throw money at something and try to make it work, but that doesn’t mean enough people will come to support it.
---
Its anothe mukling not another muckmorpher
---
I went hard into Wild sometime after The Witchwood and have loved being able to escape standard metas I don't enjoy for cards I've loved playing throughout hearthstone history.
---
Diversity of formats is why Magic: the Gathering has thrived for so long, and hearthstone needs to take some notes on how to support their formats other than standard (and then give those notes to MTG Arena but that's a different story).

Another prominent [ex-HS player](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9m7tjp/why_noxious_wont_play_hearthstone_gwent_or/) returning to play the new game mode.
---
Yep and I'm still downvoted... OK...
---
I started playing wild for 2 reasons, 1st I missed playing my Highlander and Quest decks, and 2nd, I thought that monthly rewards were given separately from Wild and Standard, the logic was telling me that. Big was my surprise when after a month I discovered that you only received rewards for one mode.
---
My suggestion to help wild would be that, give monthly rewards separately from standard, I'm sure a lot of people would play the mode more frecuently and discover the vast amazing variety of decks.

If you hadn't stoped playing you too could have a bigger and better collection. Those people with complete decks at rank 20 most likely do not care at all with ranking, therefore they hover arround rank20, only playing enough for the 5 wins and thats it.
---
Even if you are not happy with the meta, like me, you can still play tavern brawl, arena, solo or even casual and keep doing your daily quests and hording gold for the next expansion, this way you are less likely to fall behind.
---
I have three straight 60g quests since the patch update. I still got one or two 50g quests. That's my anecdote at least.
---
you'd make things a lot easier on him if you used standard decks and didn't make him collect a ton more cards to work in your preferred format
---
at first at least.
---
I got a drop from watching a VoD, then streamed it and one of my viewers got a drop.
---
Hi. We don't care either.
---
Regards, Hearthstone streamers.
---
Play rogue and just dab an execute on that baby
---
It’s great when you double battlecry those with shudderwock
---
He told me he just wants to battle me with some of my other decks, he doesn't care if he loses or not.
---
Which one did you play first? You need to play summoning portal first and then mechwarper. The opposite doesn't work and it will stay at 1 Mana.
