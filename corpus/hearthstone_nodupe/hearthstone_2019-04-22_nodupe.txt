Yes but at the same time, when you're taught how to write in Chinese, you're told that every character should fit in a perfect square.

Playing zoolock, turn 7 Rafaam into 2 emeriss’ followed by a Princess Talanji. Yeah I’m a low rank player, but I can be happy with this sort of stuff.
---
Add another tracking and marked shot, and then maybe from there u could add a grievous bite for token druids, and yeah secrets are good
---
Hearthstone was realistically never touching *paper* Magic.
---
It should be good because you have to buy the wings.
---
your argument is based on a person who has a heavy accent, I feel like it's a waste of time to even to trying to talk you
---
Intresting name
---
I've been running a deck without Nomi so idk if its worth including him
---
I added blood list into my permanent list! Thanks
---
"Death Knights" are what a lot of people use to describe Hero Cards, since all of the first Hero Cards introducing the new card type were Death Knight versions.
---
It miffs me a bit that people conflate the two but it's not hard to know exactly what they mean, rofl.
---
My argument is based on most Chinese people being unable to speak English well before they put in a certain amount of work. Your argument is based off people not even trying to learn your language because it is less necessary in the world. It seems talking to you is idiotic because you are emotionally hurt about something lol
---
Erm... Clonemaster Zerek is a Priest cars last I checked
---
The problem is that you absolutely have to run Elysiana+baleful banker/brewmaster in control warrior or you always lose the mirror, but then every mirror reaches the turn limit.
---
Do you mean Rastakhan's Rumble?
---
Because most people really liked Rumble Run, last I checked.
---
at that point just fill the page with [REDACTED]s
---
&gt;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON
---
Thanks. I honestly did look for the source to give credit, but only found reposters
---
You made me waste time in reading Bomb Warrior doesnt run Elysiana. Seriously, you should at least consider your ladder experience and check if your statistics dont sound odd and checking them a bit. Regardless, yes, Blizzard can nerf a card for just one match up in a top meta deck.
---
You can put her in any decent deck and make the deck worse.
---
And how do you go face when rushing?
---
It's also 0 mana so it will still die like ironbeak to a rogues weapon.
---
One of those written from the authors perspective given a biased view and tiny sample size. Neither are dominating.
---
Both are POPULAR, but neither has a dominating winrate. Token Druid is highest winrate (barely) and zoolock has the highest winrate on any specific deck composition. Both warrior and rogue come in at under 54% overall.
---
 JokeR8Greece#2953 EU trading 80g Quest
---
It's just the typical deck at the top of HSReplay at the moment: https://hsreplay.net/decks/nMO4cjoONeRGT8LKKSWkA/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD  
---
I'm considering swapping it out for one without the lackey rat which I'm unimpressed with.
---
Jesus christ. Do you consider that to be a long name, in the same sense as Mackenzie is a long English name? Does a word take longer to pronounce the more complicated the character is? Sorry I got super curious, guess i should google it
---
I just copied the quote and didn't even notice.
---
What?
---
Look up emergence.
---
At that low, just use autocomplete.
---
Do you realize that it takes only 12 pen strokes to make that character and yet the English words equivalent "competition" takes nearly 20 pen strokes to write
---
Every time I see stuff like this it makes me sad for how great this game could be if they actually tried.
---
I think the solution is to raise her cost to 10 mana, the issue and what leads to fatigue is when you baleful banker elysania, something that is now essential to win the control warrior mirror.
---
caiocanic#1523 NA, 80g trade. I show, you go first.
---
Without it. People can just auto fill deck with removals and Elysianna banker though. Warrior just happens to be the best control class atm. Shaman is very close to be one and paladin only needs cheap aoe. 
---
Her mechanic is cool but the strategy around this card is very unfun and I ain't sure if anyone happy to play her in this meta, they just have to include her or lose. 
---
It will only get worse if they print more control-ish cards and don't print her counter.
---
What deck doesn't?
---
That's what I mean, though.  You're eating up another resource.  Instead of *just* the dagger charge, you're also eating up Backstab, which means they have less removal for later on.
---
Playing Control Warrior is all about eating up their resources.  For one more mana on Spellbreaker, you usually eat up another resource from your opponent.
---
We only got the 18 deck slots (up from 9) because we got wild. They both came in the same patch (if I remember correctly). *Clearly we need a third format so that Blizzard would deem it necessary for as to get 9 more deck slots.*
---
Timezone would have been Europe but you can forget it, streaming Hearthstone is currently a waste of time. You can not blame the viewers: if you just want to sell new cards and do not want to make any improvements to the game, then it will slowly die out - just as the nerd mentality of Blizzard has already been eradicated by Activision.
---
As long as it's all about winning at Hearthstone and not just the fun, the current streamers serve just that craving. I think the only exception is currently WoWHobbs.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh, by the way - you were the only person who had answered to my request.
---
Can’t they just move hagatha, zuljin and dr boom to HoF ?
---
And for one more mana you can only play so many less resources that turn.
---
Why would it be a bug? It's understandable that the effect checks for another card to apply the cost reduction
---
I did a qualifier yesterday; there were several rounds where it felt like the last match ended a full half hour later than the second last. And there were also several occurrences yesterday where all active qualifiers had just one game playing out.
---
One way to fix this would be to allow tiebreaker rules to the last series remaining in a round (i.e. if going to game 3, whoever won their game with higher health, win the series). But that would be quite a radical change to change the qualifier rules just for one card, and they're not going to do it cause they're not going to change the rules in the middle of the qualifying period. A ban or nerf is much more likely - but something's gotta be done.
---
Hero cards not being death knights has nothing to do about general knowledge of the game, it’s strictly a lore thing. It’s also a completely understandable mistake when a majority of the hero cards are death knights.
---
Only in the later turns.  In the early turns, you're often hero power/passing anyway.
---
That would be sick, I would definitely love an update to all the original hero portraits.
---
Hoes mad

---
Is this a bug? Yes. Does this have anything to do with hs being an old game? No. This bug is new because it's a new mechanic.
---
Jains already wears a cowl...
---
Thanks for making Warrior worse, OP
---
/s
---
This is hilarious.  I could not stop laughing.🤪
---
I mean atleast you know that you’re going to win/lose on turn 6 rather than just lose on turn 34 or draw the game
---
That’s assuming they have bad draw but frankly that’s why most people lose hs anyway
---
I can't imagine what Wild is like at this point... best of luck to everyone braving that.
---

Wait how did you get rid of your shrine to have 7?
---
Since I had the rouge shrine I got the mage hero card and ig that got rid of the shrine, I hadn't even noticed I lost it till I had all 7 and i got all confused but brushed it off bc I knew I was gonna win anyways
---
Tfw bae tighten two 1/2 firewood pipe
---
Blizzard doesn't want people to play Wild. I don't agree with this, but pretty sure there's nothing that will make them change their stance. Best just forget about it and move on.
---
Yeah bro I ran a similar list at a point with dragons, this one seems to have more firepower Haha, I agree dropping the mage causes panic and they waste a turning killing it and using resources, maybe even a grave horror because this is so spelled based, I like it man I'll keep tweaking while you are as well and maybe your deck might become the next meta deck Haha, that'd be awesome
---
It is though. The card itself is rogue so by holding it you are holding one from another class.
---
RIP CED
---
This isn't really fair. It's hardly only stroke number that determines complexity. For example, you can write competition without having seen it before, if you know how English works. I doubt the same is true for that.
---
Rogue is incredibly balanced right now. The high winrate variants run completely different packages, the cards you listed are the ones that appear in the balanced lists. So those aren't the issues.
---
Nerfing Elysiana just makes shaman incredibly powerful and the instant winner on control decks. Make that nerf and I promise you control shaman T1, in a toxic fashion.
---
Dr booms hero power is balanced as is, it's the rush that's broken. With so many good mechs it pretty much doubles the amount of removal they have. No rush? Suddenly the opponent is dictating all those trades and they are a ton weaker.
---
Tempo rogues are at least fun to play against, since you can try to figure out what’s in their hand and how you can counter. With Token Druid it’s just “fuck, where’s my AoE?”
---
I still strongly believe the Classic set should be a rotating one. There would be no need for HOFing cards, alleviates some of the staleness those classic cards cause, and stop classes from playing new versions of the same old decks.
---
As for nerfing Rogue things just to bring down Lackey Rogue, I don’t think it’ll provide any meaningful change since we know another deck will simply replace it as the deck to beat. There must and will always be a best deck. 
---
And I really don’t see the problem with Leeroy. Only one deck runs him currently. It’s just a worse Fireball and if that card isn’t getting HOFed then it has no right to be either.
---
All right, I'll bite, I've played a minimal amount of MTG, 1 WTF is "the stack" and 2: why should I care, MTG isnt Hearthstone.
---
It's rare for a new expansion to change the wild meta, I'd say wild is cheaper than standard in the long run.
---
given his reaction and the context I think it's pretty clear that he is referring to the complexity of the strokes/how to write it/how it looks
---
Have you tried asking through speech to subscribe?
---
I found that I subscribe more often to channels that reminds me to subscribe to them via speech rather than banners/outro screens. You don't have to make it sound like how some Youtubers(Pewds/Mark) asks their audience, just simply add to your intro speech something like "If you like our content then be sure to subscribe and hit notification to always be updated, it really helps a lot and I'll see you guys on the next one..".
---
Might help, might not.
---
Cheers!
---
Same lmao I had about 10k dust saved up, built bomb warrior, only replaced Darius Crowley with militia commander and captain green skin with upgrade, the deck is really fun and I’m winning a lot more than I’m losing. I also crafted whizbang so whenever I want a break I just play a couple whizbang games (and hope I don’t get Druid lmao)
---
For hero cards I think the infinite value from Hagatha and Dr. Boom are the problem. If they were toned down to have a one turn affect like Zul'Jin I think that would positively impact the game.
---
Only 80? Count me in.
---
Rafaam is a lot more fun AND has the best intro in the game, I think. Catrina will likely be better as the next expansions roll out and Rez Priest decks get more focused.
---
With so much removal you can’t keep a board against warriors
---
As far as Wild goes, the card that irritates me more than any other is Coldlight Oracle. I think it's time for that to receive the Warsong Commander treatment simply because some strategies just shouldn't be a part of the game. Mark Rosewater stomped on land destruction 20 years ago in Magic because it was fundamentally a shitty mechanic, and Mill Rogue needs to go to the same way, winrates notwithstanding.
---
The other thing that needs to happen: Blizzard needs to quit pussyfooting and print a shitty expensive neutral minion with "Battlecry: Transform all minions into 1/1 sheep." The resurrection/deathrattle business is fine in theory, but not when most classes have no direct counter other than SMORC faster.
---
With Hagatha you get mostly bad spells or removal. Dr. Boom gives you minions, control, healing, and Rush to get even more value out of your mechs.
---
Yeah, I am too. It's complicated because there's no shortcuts like "sounding it out" in English. There's no hints, you just have to remember that those specific strokes are for that word. Because of how English works, you really only need 26 patterns, and none are that complex. Knowing how they go together is also easier with etymology, which is only sort of there in Chinese.
---
Priest is playing a deck that doubles the minions health then sets the attack equal to the health. Warrior has a hero power every once in awhile that gives him 7 armor, plus other stuff like [[Eternium Rover]] and [[Armorsmith]]

Kul'Tiras when.

Forgot token druid for 2019, did bomb warrior go away the last 3 days?
---
Can that spell res the same minion three times? Say you DID NOT res the lich king 3 times; only 1 died.
---
Will you have 3 lich kings? 
---
I know spell stone specifies 3 different so you can’t have 3 of the same minion even if you resurrected it multiple times and it died more than 3 times.
---
Complains are complains, people always complain on any deck that's top of the meta.
---
The things is, I don't see this as the problem that much to be "Has to go" by got some nerf as the topic says. As they already have even more anti-fatigue card, and it's going just fine, so the problem is not this card.
---
If Benedictus Priest was top of the last meta, you think he need some nerf because mirror always get to drawing in fatigue ? I don't think so. Same goes for Dead man's hand Warrior that's bring fatigue in tournaments before.
---
Dont... Don't you need.. Cards... To make... Decks?

Warlock should be 10 mana if its gonna board clear except demons

You got my upvote, but I am 105% sure the rabid wombats out there will downvote into oblivion. The typical scroll of truth reaction. ;-)

The thief Rogue I’m talking about is Kibler’s version, it has a 52.4% win rate on hsreplay.
---
I dislike playing warrior.
---
Thanks for the other inputs though.
---
I don’t really care about dust, I’m sitting on about 17,000 right now so I’m just looking for something decent and fun that doesn’t get repetitive.
---
But in that 63.7% he does it every time!
---
Don't be a dick :p the game just isn't fun when you lose by turn 5 and nothing fun or interesting or random happened. It's. Boring.
---
He just meant it’s unlikely to low roll 4 times in a row. You need to roll ~2% (made this up) to get your guaranteed legendary on your near 40th pack; and then you have to roll that chance 3 more times. 
---
It’s not impossible. Just unlikely. But we’re on the internet so I believe you. There’s bound to be someone who receives the worst luck.

---
Seriously so little complaints about these decks were made it's disingenuous to include them. Unless you want to cover every deck ever complained about, just put every single deck permutation up there. Kind of defeats the point doesn't it?
---
But on the hole I think this is a great overview of just how consistent this sub is at being right. I know, praising this sub goes against the circlejerk that everyone here is brain dead except whoever is making the observation. But hear me out...
---
The majority of these decks that were heavily complained about were nerfed and they most certainly held the meta back. Most of these decks did lead to a number of issues. Whether they created very polarizing match ups or coin flippy match ups, held back archtypes b/c they were just too dominate against them, or were just so consistent that there was little reason to play anything else. 
---
When this sub complains about it long enough, it's eventually proven right. Everyone who bitches and complains that everyone here is stupid or just circlejerking is proven wrong time and time again, but the need to feel superior never ends. The reality is this sub is made up a number of different people with differing opinions and with how reddit works, they all get a voice. I think a number of others fall into this false assumption that b/c something reaches the front page, the majority must agree with it. Or that b/c it has X amount of uptvotes or Y ratio of upvotes to downvotes, that it's representative of the community. Which makes the top comment about perspective kind of... ironic. 
---
I'll never forget the days of Undertaker hunter. It was such a great example that in the end, this community can know what's better for the game from time to time. Numerous times BBrode and the people at Team 5 defended the deck, encouraged people to try counters, and really made a stand to hold off on nerfing any cards. What followed was, IMO, the worst state of Hearthstone thanks to what can only be described was a stupid decision. But alas we had people defending Blizzard b/c "the devs know better than you stupid cunts" and the classic "lol these people do this for a living you're just a fat nerd." So for several weeks Hunter literally made up half of the meta and the Blizzard fanboys did their best at trying to quell the complaints on here with the EXACT same rhetoric you still see today. And what did we learn? Basically nothing. The majority of counter complaints are just "lol you're complaining about the popular deck you're dumb" Very little counter points being made or different perspectives being shared. Just "lol you're dumb" and "stop complaining about the popular deck"
---

Hi there. You appear to have been shadowbanned for some reason. Being shadowbanned means other users can't read your comments unless manually approved by a moderator, which is a bit of a hassle for us, and a hassle for you if no moderator is online to approve it for you.
---
Please contact the reddit admins by modmailing /r/reddit.com ([click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&amp;subject=&amp;message=)) to resolve this matter.
---
In the meantime, I have approved your comment.
---
Balance problems are one thing, but the point of OP's post is that the negative community response is completely out of proportion to the issue. Complaints about the meta inevitably degenerate into toxic comments aimed at the player base. Explicit flame comments are pretty far between, but you start to see micro aggressions against anyone playing a good deck along the lines of:
---
Net deckers have no creativity
---
Aggro players have low skill
---
combo players are uninteractive
---
ladder is broken because of so and so players
---
etc
---
Not only are these completely unjustified complaints, but they also create an extremely toxic community. Nobody should feel discriminated based on something stupid like what deck they find fun/choose to play. You shouldn't have to justify why your playing your own decks to the community at large, everybody should just play whatever the hell they feel like.
---
Loatheb might be my favorite card ever printed.  Dropping that for the win on turn 5 after going all in the past 4 turns was so very satisfying against a lot of these OP decks.
---
That's if they go in in the right order and current board state. The frenzies can go off beforehand, and it also requires you to play all the spells first. He's a massive swing, yes, but you can't just play him whenever; you must time him. For Boom/Hagatha, there's no reason not to play them on curve unless lethal is threatened.
---
Ha. I actually find it pretty hilarious when someone fills my death pool with useless crap. These days though it’s almost irrelevant now that we have catrina muerte, vargoth, and kel thusad. It’s an insane trio.
---
Are there even any friendly Saurok in WoW? I find it doubtful that one could manage to sneak into Dalaran(and it doesn’t appear to be part of the invasion)
---
Decklist?
---
How do you play this against bomb warrior ? 
---
I get eventually destroyed by Dr boom value, with no more cards in my hand ..
---
I mostly survive until their deck is empty but I need to spend all my hand ressources dealing with the mech swarm.
---
Gotta agree with the Waggle Pick. I'm not sure who at Blizzard decided Rogue needs a better Truesilver Champion.
---
Yeah I run him in my hand lock but his winnrate is lower it seems lol.
---
Fibonacci packs 0 Elysiana in his control warrior and his winrate in the mirror is great.
---
I loved the great majority of the decks you listed (those I recognize anyway, a few may have been before my time) and I would gladly welcome the unnerfing of many of the cards in those decks so they can return to their former glory in wild.  Particularly Pirate Warrior, god I miss old Patches.
---
Been away from hs for two expansions, logged back in to check the new RoS. I got the usual free packs and opening this was not a bad welcome back present at all!
---
I still use Pirate Warrior in wild. It still tilts the shit out of people when you put them on 0 by turn 6. I even had a few people just quit on turn 2 or 3. Also, thank you to everyone who tried adding me after playing, but I am not accepting rage requests at this time.
---
Damn, why did they have to change the portrait and add clothes? Blizzard has done it again
---
I play him in my control warlock but its wierd that warrior hero card gives more value and control tools then 6/6 every turn...
---
it's good the way it is, you just press on the link and see the image without having half a page occupied by a single image
---
i just saying there was a lot of male guests.. and taric was supporting and giving everyone a helping hand o.O
---
Not interested and would be a waste of my reroll
---
Uther is my personal favorite, but the only reason I don't consider him healthy is because how he was used for combo. If it was just that if you couldn't answer a 2/2 for 3 turns in a row, you lose, that would be awesome. But all of his competitive play ended up being based on bouncing the minions to hand and OTKing.
---
He's basically shitting on people having valid complaints about actual broken decks, decks that got nerfed hard by Blizzard themselves.
---
I get that there are always people who whine about everything but that doesn't mean ALL the criticism is unwarranted.
---
Haha that’s cool as, thanks for pulling through with the source 👌👌
---
Because a single card tutors almost all of it for three mana now
---
I remember in card reviews when streamers would unironically say "This card would be better if it had one less attack".
---
I don't think we need to encourage people to spam 'well played' after every move you make. It happens enough already. Discovering 'squelch' was a dream come true.
---
The point is that there are lots of ways to win in magic, not all of them result in direct loss of life. Not every game is going to go like that. But if you are in a situation where you have no cards in hand and no board, while they have a full hand and full life, does it matter that they haven't been dealing damage to you up until now? It just means that strategies that don't require consistent strong board presence can win just as well as those that do.
---
umm what happened to the text?
---
You don't have to necessarily netdeck to get to rank 5. It's more about picking the right decks that counters the deck you're playing against most.
---
I personally alternated between my own Zoolock and Kingsbane Rogue decks to counter Kingsbane and Big Priest respectively.
---
Damn an ultra rare 0 mana kalecgos too!
---
I agree with you. This is the most popular place to discuss the game, of course criticism of the metagame is a common topic. That can be a good thing too’ critique can enthuse progress. Even Blizzard themselves can use it to gauge how the community feels about certain cards or decks. 
---
My two main issues as I attempted to convey in the past is most importantly that we need a more active stance against toxicity in this subreddit (and as a product of being the most popular forum, the HS community at large) but also that the very legitimate issues (such as the control warrior mirror right now,  or the game warping nature of even and odd decks from last year) seem a lot smaller when they’re surrounded by droves what comes down to deck hate threads.
---
This whole community needs to focus on a Love for Hearthstone over a Hate it. I made my reddit account just because I heard that there was a community of people who enjoy the same game as me (nobody plays that I know) and from day one I just saw negative comments and people who I could swear just came here to insult the game that I enjoy,
---
No, the standard packs only contain standard play cards. I think it’s to help new players or they could end up with cards they can’t use or have to play wild which would be almost impossible for new players

Molten Giant cost goes up when you get healed despite the card only saying each  damage your hero has taken.
---
It doesn't say: This game. It doesn't say: Cost increased when restoring health. If I'm reduced to 1 health and then I Reno, Molten should still be free according to the text because my hero has taken at least 29 damage (as well as healed for at least 29).
---
They're not going to turn card text into older MTG cards with a paragraph of text. Some things are just going to have to be assumed and unfortunately just like not getting to cast a free Molten after healing to full despite that being contrary to the card text, you'll just have to accept Vendetta working the same way. Just as Molten requires you to assume that healing makes Molten forget the history of the damage you've taken that game, Vendetta only thinks about the other cards in your hand.

And a 3/2.

No, but the point is that if they were the only class able to abuse Elysiana (via Shudderwock) then they would become the new problem.

Tf is sunshine Hunter?

This plus the fact that the dust system is abyssmal and people have to make do with the cards they have and only craft select cards which belong to the best/better decks.

"Don't lose?"

That's why we play 7/7 on 4, duh...

Got today a golden Myra Element. But I'm F2p, and guess who doesn't have a lot of cards to make a tempo rogue, or any cool deck with Myra? Guess I'll wait a little
---
Ah, I see you are a degenerate of culture as well
---
I think all heroes look at the center of their hero portrait though
---
Even though I excitedly crafted it in gold knowing it would be amazing, I have to agree. I am terrified to see this card in a deck because I know I won’t win fatigue
---
I wish they would *buff anything* instead of using nerfs as only means of change.
---
Surprise BM best BM! Funnily enough, I met a bunch of my HS friends this way. ;D
---
80g trade quest. NA you go first.
---
Well, just blame who put the emotes in game. I.e Blizzard.
---
ur broken
---
MEHMET?? DID YOU REALLY DREW THAT?? THAT IS SOO GOOD
---
Hmmmm. Interesting thought, but might be hard to implement.
---
?
---
Nah this looks like the Khadgar one, color scheme wise
---
I'm confused, why did you make a list of every deck in the game??
---
The are simple, coinflippy, throw down aggro decks and complex, reliable, carefully planned aggro decks. Many downplay aggro by claiming aggro is all the former and not the later. If you play complex aggro like simple aggro, your winrate will suffer bad.
---
Please don't downvote me then based on an assumption. I stated very clearly that **IF** that ordering is correct then the card is not bugged.
---
You know you speak the truth when you get downvoted here
---
Well then we would have a bugged ordering, so let's not assume that.
---
People who concede to the ancient one need to suffer, It's a satisfying hit everyone should try at least once
---
Hunter really doesn't have many decent draw options right now except Tracking, which you are using, and Master's Call, which sucks in Mech Hunter. You should also be using Ursatron and Nine Lives, but any neutral card draw you can probably think of isn't good enough for the deck as we currently know it, especially in the Goblin Bomb heavy variants.
---
I have a feeling they’ll nerf Boom by taking away the Rush part of his Battlecry
---
People don't do honest cards right anymore.
---
Completely off topic but I just realised.... Couldn't you play the pally card that reduces health to 1 followed by 2x Molten Giants?
---
As a player who started after Nax, i would love to play from 50 to 20!!!!
---
The rewards are amazing and the fun Decks that could work using whizbang would double the fun. From 15 to 1 you only encounter the same 3 Decks all the time. Thats not fun. I don't play standard anymore. Only brawl once a week and singleplayer
---
You implied that by including decks like huntertaker, patron warrior, quest rogue.
---
Ungoro was indeed one of the best meta but despite that, it had decks like quest rogue and pirate warrior. The game can't be 100% flawless, some people acknowledge that while some don't. I think both sides are fine..
---
Yeah, I agree. They could really be a bit more proactive with changes. It would be cool to see certain cards intentionally buffed too. Like, imagine if they buffed the boogymonster or perhaps made totemic might summon 2 random totems if you had none in play.
---
On the topic of nerfs though, most of the biggest offenders that people bitched ceaselessly about did in fact get retuned. Hunters lost buzzards, undertaker got nerfed, both the lock and the druid charge finishers got HoF'd etc etc etc. I think the devs actually do a pretty good job, I just wish that they were a little more ambitious and we could see formats that didn't use the classic set at all with different ladders or something. The single largest contributor to people bitching on reddit about OP decks is boredom, the boredom of seeing the same cards over and over again and the boredom of knowing those cards will forever be a part of the best decks. Shield slam anyone? Brawl? Fiery War axe (not you) execute . These cards are boring. We have played them thousands of times and when we make a deck, we still use them.
---
You nailed it. I've played a lot of control warrior right from the start and liked having to choose when to play what because removal was limited/when was the right time to go on the aggressive. Warrior was my first golden portrait for a long time. I can't play it any more because of the hero power RNG.
---
Hmmm... is that how it works? Off to Google I go.
---
Id disagree but thats ok. Imo Zoo at the start sure,  but that was time where many people didnt have cards+dint know how to play so Zoo was perfect to contest the Wallet warriors. Eveything else not really from what I remember. My issue with tempo rogue was always only coin flappy bird into lose the game in turn 4.   There was always some counterplay for the other decks. Shudderwock was just annying when he went off, but was hard to play(winrate ~&lt;50%) and most variations had to go for same gamble to pull it off, it was like Tier 2 deck. Quest mage similar stuff tier 2 deck at best, with just some annoying part.
---
Bruh you just listed nearly all good decks from these time periods
---
"Double time and double pay" every time.
---
Played winrate is less through so he is actually worse, it's just that his shell is better
---
Just buy the packs theyvare free
---
I personally try to wait a while until the meta settles before crafting any legendaries due to their high crafting cost. But, if you are planning on crafting her, I don't think it's a bad idea. Secret paladin is having great success with her, especially if you are able to combo her with mysterious challenger. However, the deck itself has been changed quite a bit since RoS has been released, so I might hold off a little bit (like a week or so, if you have the patience), before committing to the craft. That said, she is a very strong card, and I think she is more value than fun in the right deck
---
Any deck that can run Commander Rhyssa will be able to function without it reasonably. She's one of those sorts of cards that will really only increase the winrate of the deck rather than making or breaking it.

Unlucky but I feel you. Cannot understand the hate you are getting though. If had to pick between control Warrior / bomb shitfest, waggle pick tempo rogue and token I would play token druid all day everday.

Yah I agree with OPs sentiment but the reason tempo rogue is oppressive is not because “minions on curve” are bad for the game.
---
I fully expected to open this and just see "All of them"
---
Welcome to dad legend xD
---
I agree with this assessment. She is good in the deck, so I am sure that she increases the winrate. But, the deck can be played without her, it will just be slightly worse
---
It's the same reason people hated Pirate Warrior and Face Mage it's not interactive at all. Pirate Warrior was probably the most interactive because at least they needed some minions but Face Mage, Burn Mage whatever you want to call it was just hoping you could survive their burn or kill them before they burn you.
---
if you couldn't kill a 2/2 for 3 turns in a row, you were going to lose anyway
---
I see, so you're the type that if you get what you want it doesn't matter the way you do it or how it happened?
---
I'd better call the police.
---
Hero powers are not a place to put exciting effects on. Exciting usually ends up with being connected to big, and big hero powers result in stuff like Zombeasts and Water Elementals with Lifesteal.
---
Honestly against priest that isn’t a big deal. Priest early game is nonexistent except the fringe silence decks.
---
Yeah, it’s really Myracle. The name switch for the deck was really shitty for that reason
---
Sh&lt;&lt;it eating ret&lt;&lt;&lt;ard, what the fu&lt;&lt;&lt;ck is wrong with you
---
Were you born ret&lt;&lt;arded? Be honest, i wont laugh
---
&gt; Control decks only have brainless games when they draw very well against aggro
---
They do that often because majority of their deck is littered with removal and zero actual wincon besides fatigue based bs. 
---
Which is why they get destroyed by combo decks unless they can land the RNG hecklebot/cast a random spell guy pulls of a key combo piece.
---
Fwiw other control decks like big shaman have decent thought and aren't brainless. In every matchup. 
---
It's just control/fatigue warrior that's utterly brain dead across the board in today's meta. Just play removals, pray to have Dr boom in top half of deck, and good Omega assemblys that give you more removal/heals.
---
That's literally what tempo is, though. You seem to be confused with midrange.
---
Now that standard has the advantage of having no Genn or Baku my chances of playing wild are slim to none.
---
a people or a miis?
---
Wow for a second I thought this was a hate post and was about to write what you said at the and. Reading the whole post os useful
---
Did someone just say "*INFINITE VALUE*"?
---
I agree with more frequent balance updates, but I downvoted you just for suggesting no full dust refund, are you out of your mind?
---
A month is about how long it takes to see if the meta can adjust to a power card or deck, and going faster has the inadvertant consequence of making collections less stable. Yes, you get dust refunds on nerfed cards, but you don't get refunds on other cards that you crafted to build around the nerfed card. Going to weekly or semi-monthly nerfs would be a terrible idea in my opinion.

I've played about 30 hours of HS since the expansion launched and have been largely enjoying it.
---
There are things I don't like, of course.  Losing 30 minute warrior matches is frustrating.  Losing to Lackey rogue when they get a god draw and have infinite resources and free removal is nauseating.  
---
But overall, I love where HS is as a game.  Yes, it has flaws that are built into the core architecture of the experience.  I do think those will need to be addressed if Blizz wants to take HS from a "6-8 year" game up to a "10-15 year" game.  
---
That said, I plan to keep supporting HS.  I do hope they make some balance changes here shortly, but I am very pleased with where the meta sits right now.  Nothing is unbeatable.  Nothing has an absolute lack of counter.  The way they printed well designed hate cards shows me that this team is capable of growing.
---
It's the most intuitive, yes. You can get Legend by just spamming minions with a top tier aggressive deck. But in terms of skill cap, it's significantly harder than any of the other archetypes. A necessary result from having to plan ahead, rather than reacting to the board.
---
I don't think OP is arguing it's a good card, just not bad because it's only a problem for mirror matches for decks whose only won condition is to fatigue the opponent. Decks that include win condition cards don't have a problem with it. Either the warrior removes their WC and they lose, or they pull it off and win. Warrior mirror match means their WC cancel each other out and they just hit turn limit.
---
tl;dr
---
Include a win condition in your deck instead of just relying on fatigue. Or don't, and don't complain.
---
I don't really much care about Elysiana personally, and could very much care less about the going to turn limit situation, as currently I'm running a mechrattle hunter which has been letting me breeze through control and bombs like no tomorrow.   
---
What I do care about is your assertion that "oh just run Mecha'thun" like doing so doesn't require a multi-card setup to work efficiently, and can easily be countered if not done correctly - ESPECIALLY with Elysiana. 
---
If you're running the multi-card setup to make Mecha'thun work in one turn, the OTK setup that is, you're effectively completely changing your deck and tailoring it towards killing one specific deck which can make you a lot worse against a lot of other decks as you remove maybe some of your control aspects for the aggressive decks or your removals for the slower decks or your resource generation - any number of things that are fairly vital to fighting... everything except Elysiana.   
---
If you aren't running the multi-card setup, and you're planning on just dropping the Mecha'thun and hoping it dies, there are so many counters that can be slapped right in your face to make Mecha'thun either just a dead card or a 10/10. Silences, deck shuffling cards, aggressive cards that can allow burst whilst you sit there floundering with your 10/10 being just dropped on the board - and many of these can be created through Elysiana herself! Mecha'thun himself may have rush, but if you're implying that your opponent is going to have a 10/10 on board for you to run yours in to - remember, you can't have any cards in your hand to kill him off with after you hit something smaller - then you're missing the point so hard, you can't see the point anymore for how far you've went past the point. "Most control warriors don't even run silence"? Great, let me tech in a card that is absurdly easy to tech against once it becomes """popular""" and is just a good card in general, but it's okay, because MOST don't run it CURRENTLY. How absurdly short-sighted.
---
As for "any ACTUAL win condition", that's a strange bit of simultaneous gatekeeping and No True Scotsman. What, fatigue isn't a win condition these days? Controlling your opponent out the game isn't a win condition? Why, because you say so?
---
Your arrogance is absurd and your """solution""" is a band-aid for a problem that you don't seem to know anything about. You should genuinely, well and truly, feel bad for posting this.
---
The only deck I found very annoying and extremely unfair to play against was patron warrior, being able to to have 20+ attack charge berserkers followed by a round of patrons hits was ridiculous. Even if they got backing into a corner they could release the first wave of patrons with and Armor smith to clear the board and gain 20 Armor. 
---
The deck wasn’t easy to play but if you could pilot well you were unstoppable
---
Ah, RNG. Gotta love it.
---
Good for them. Hakkar is a win condition.
---
What annoys me is the people complaining about other people complaining about other people complaining
---
Since they took the death knights away, they should add alternate versions of each original hero. Yes I know death knights were a card not a replaceable hero.
---
Buffs are a lot more risky than nerfs. If you buff a card and it becomes OP because of an unexpected deck popping out of it, you piss off far more people when you have to go back and nerf it into its original state, to say nothing about the fact that you'll need to give dust refunds when you do, which means that you are basically paying people to own one of your cards.

Hagatha trifecta op tho
---
The college open last night was painful. I tuned into a mirror match with archivist. The announcers knew it was a dead game with minimum  20 minutes of pud pounding left. They tried hard to keep talking but it was super cringe. Its going to kill specialist format where you cant ban bore you to death decks. Having one mirror set hold up a round for hours cant happen.
---
That's fair enough, though I think AI boss characters should have the special, exciting hero powers which usually they do. 
---
(The real problem is the infinite stream of Encounter at the Crossroads Tavern Brawls)
---
But I think we can all agree NAX death rattle hunter was op
---
I play wild if I dont want to win. You can play so many funny and crazy decks. The only problem are the res priests or exodia mages but the other matches are much fun
---
Thank you. Most of the ones people make now just have some half thought out phrase on the text. For example "fuck you warrior". Such comedy genius right there, I would have never been able to think of that.
---
damn, that bad huh?
---
yes .... now go plz
---
Into my upvote.
---
Tempo is another word for the aggro-control hybrid archetype. While I agree with you, HS players have historically put this under that same umbrella term.
---
Hahaha bothers me, I don't know why. Like her as a chatacter, I just find her off putting and and annoying.
---
Same with shadowstep into spellbender, the 1 cost 1/3 remains 1 cost
---
FOUL THE LAKES!!!
---
Like more Tavern Brawls...boring.  I prefer ones that were more whacky and crazy and while npt popular, I liked the co-op ones and ones where you played as Rag &amp; Nef.
---
This one boiled down to starting hand and what Legendaries you and your opponent got.
---
Yeah jesus, I feel like I have been playing this game for forever (I have taken some leaves of absence though) and I only have like, just over 200 ranked wins with each of my two most played classes (Mage and Paladin). Is that total win number for ranked only or for total wins?
---
Control/fatigue warrior is absolutely this braindead though. In today's meta. The ones from years ago were legit skill testing control
---
Other control decks like shaman are pretty good with decision making. It's just warrior that's braindead...minimal minion play, full blown removal/heal package, no other wincon besides fatigue.
---
Despite stating myself that "aggro in brainless" there is more to it then that.  Yes, aggro has critical decisions to make and the game needs to end by turn 8-10.   There are finesse plays in aggro.  Finding a way to trade on turn 2-3 so your minion keeps that 1 extra health could be win or lose moment.  Holding back, anticipating a board clear, but having potential lethal or draw for lethal.  But aggro's only win condition is pump cards out towards face damage.  There is no back-up plan after turn 10. 
---
Control, tempo, and even combo all exists "out of the normal" possibilities.   Aggro is beat the board clears and smash face, game over by turn 10 every time.  With the other styles of play, weird outcomes pop up on occasion.
---
Priest mirror?  Maybe you can manipulate their Northshire into overdrawing.   Control warrior game the other night, I saw a chance to burn just 1 of his cards and it was Archivist.  It's hilarious how these games can change with oddities that don't exist with aggro.  When Jepetto Hunter draws all his main minions, he can still get crafty and figure something out. 
---
When the aggro win condition fails, there is no back-up plan.
---
Well you're missing the point of why that specifically was no unfair. Being above 14 health wasn't exactly an easy thing to do against druid for a lot of classes. And clearing *everything* every turn was very difficult. For the druid, have a 2 card combo that did 14 from hand was not exactly difficult. And since they ran 2 copies of each, it was not hard to have these two cards. One 4 attack minion meant you couldn't be below 20 health. It was a degenerate combo
---
You didn't mention the same old cancer decks running rampant in wild. Well OK, maybe not the same like they originally were in standard but jacked up versions due to more cancer from older sets.
---
I have a love/hate relation with this sub. There is undoubtably a lot of toxicity, which I hate, but there is also creativity and insight to be found here as well.
---
Reminds me of the good old days playing against odd paladin. I clear my opponents whole board. Next turn he has a full board again.
---
Big reason why everyone thought Trogzor would be dominate and Boom would be terrible. "dies to BGH". Reminds me of the "dies to doom blade" MTG sentiment.
---
Just this one
---
To be honest, while for most I agree, I don't remember anyone disliking patron warrior. Pretty much everyone I know, and even back then, agreed that patron was the most amazing deck to emerge. Extremely skillfull, minimized RNG and needed a ton of practice to pull off right.
---
The only question was that everyone (rightfully) assumed it would get nerfed because it was dominating competitive play for too long.
---
Do you have a mental disability or have you just never learned to read?
---
you want to nerf her to the ground don't u
---
I’m a total hypocrite and loved playing a lot of these decks but absolutely hated playing against most. Only I can have fun &gt;:( haha
---
The coolest combo I ever pulled off was the shaman 3/3 that cast your next spell twice into shadowform, making my hero power deal 3 dmg. My opponent emoted well played and I came
---
Rather turns 5+ would be a waste of time if you win at that stage anyway for drawing your AoE.
---
i'll take jarax
---
The most important thing is knowing how much damage you need to do, and how you can get it there. 
---
Play your slow damage first. Weapons, and minion buffs act as charge damage.
---
You need to get used to the matchups, know the removal you'll face play enough to be a threat, but still enough to reload. Know when the big taunts start coming and sneak damage through before hand or devise a plan to deal with them. 
---
Knowing how greedy to be is key, Savage Roar isn't always a finisher, sometimes you need to know the 10 damage you'll get from it early will be the most you'll ever see and that it's worth sacrificing some development that turn. Or Leeroy might have to be played a turn or two early, either to line up mana properly for future turns or to get that damage through to allow you to play for your outs right as the game is about to swing out of your control.
---
Likewise Soul of the Forest doesn't always need to follow Wispering Woods or the Forest's aid, sometimes getting it on three minions when the board is still be contested will give you the leg up to stay ahead.
---
Same but too bad Tempo Rogue and Token just rape your face.
---
You say this like wild players haven't been bitching about a certain deck for like a year straight at this point
---
Elysiana is only poorly designed due to the fact that you only need one bounce card to trigger her effect again. Meaning we're going to turn 40 in the mirror. The worst part about mechacthun is that you will not be able to beat any deck with any sort of aggression (token druid, any rogue, bombs will kill you). Also the mechathun package is more than 5 cards meaning specialist decks won't be able to run 5 cards to swap into their decks.
---
This means the only way to beat both elysiana decks and aggro decks with a control deck is to play elysiana with a bounce card, which turns the game into an rng clown fiesta at the end.
---
Finally fatigue is an inherently interesting, interactive, and fun mechanic, and to remove it from the game completely because one neutral card exists is incredibly frustrating.
---
Custom Rogue 2
---
Please, Blizzard, no more Hero Powers. A card game with inherent infinite value is just asking for disaster. See Genn/Baku and all the hero cards.
---
Bruh I read that as dark harvest warlock for a second there.
---
Harrison, alex, baron, ysera, cairne
---
“unfun cancer” is subjective, just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean others don’t, especially because exodia mage and mill rogue aren’t all that popular
---
I can’t use that argument for big priest though
---
In what way is wild less expensive than standard?
---
It couldn't be any worse than Metamorphosis series right?
---
Now I need to know the title of this H-manga.
---
Not less expensive,  but the dust value for wild decks and standard decks are about the same
---
Nice
---
 Jade Druid was the only one I really hated. The OTK, aggro and control decks all required skill to play. With some luck it was still possible to win against an unfavorable matchup sometimes. Jade just felt so unfair and so stupid the whole time. The games were always so boring too
---
I have it. Doesn’t feel like that important. Just play some neutral minion that generate two bombs instead.
---
I had this happen for me in arena yesterday. Still lost that match :)
---
I was only being facetious, but anytime the answer to a deck is ‘play another deck’ that doesn’t solve anything in a format where the ladder is randomized
---
Craft the ones that go in decks you want to play.
---
Harrison is seeing the most play
---
Rogue for sure. Got me legend in a day
---
wild players are like army recruiters jeez
---
Pre nerf Jaina too
---
the priest may have mass hysteria
---
No? I said japan didnt i?
---
I never ever EVER use tracking. I think discarting 2 cards that could potentially turn your loss into a win is absolutely absurd. So just use ursatron man. Or bomb ross. Fireworks tech
---
I thought Khadgar was a 10 mana 2/2 with a Battlecry: Summon 4 Reckless Rocketeers
---
One and done brawl for me.  I’m glad some people enjoy the random brawls where you don’t make a deck... but it’s not my cup of tea.  
---
I’ll always give blizz credit for trying something new tho.
---
from rank 5 to legend i actually have seen exodia mage, odd pala, some locks, jade druid, big priest and some other random decks and big priest was played 35-45% of the time. Big priest is CANCER, it's all about stalling until u summon a board that can be resurrected how many times u want, u might say that aggro can beat it easily, but no, cuz they got a shit ton of removals and if they get barnes on turn 4, the oppo is DEAD for sure.
---
I was playing a game with a big priest and with poison seeds i managed to put 12 fucking treants in his res pool, he had 6 minion that were killed, he sumoned a treat with 1 resurrection, then he cleared the board with mass hysteria (discounted with thaurissan) and then he used spellstone for 3 and summon 3 of his 6 minions that died, including vargoth, so i was like:"great now he's gonna mass hysteria his own board cuz he's a fucking idiot(with vargoth), yeah lucky to get no treants out that spellstone but u are gonna die" and then vargoth used the spellstone and didn't summon ANY treant. How i'm i supposed to react on that? it's so unfair to lose to big priest and feels so bad even playing against it.
---
Big priest is a thing and if u don't know u have been playing casual for the last 3 years
---
So genius, I really was struggling with tokens but this might help

There are threads specifically for trading this on hearthpwn,

So whenever I get this quest I end up with 160g instead! Try that next time.

Good job trying to downplay Barnes' power even if this shit card has literally the highest winrate in the game when kept in the starting hand. Flame imp's winrate changes dramatically depending on whether the player starts first or second and can be countered by many cards. Oaken summon has a high winrate only because wild is full of aggro right now. Barnes on the other hand is good against any deck and can outright win games on his own.

Man, I have a premium account of hsreplay. In the last 7 days, ranks from 5 to legend, we have:
---
Roque - 840 matches 
---
Druid - 810 
---
Rogue - 660
---
Hunter - 590 
---
Paladin - 570
---
Warlock - 570
---
Mage - 570
---
PRIEST- 510
---
Isn’t at all the most played! It represent 2%! 
---
Lvl legend... isn’t played at all!
---
Get real. The point they’re making is that the best wild players aren’t concerned about the deck because it is inconsistent and is an insta loss to aggro decks. If a bad player isn’t able to beat a deck, that doesn’t mean the deck is OP, it just means the player needs to change strategies and or practice more.
---
Even at rank 10 in wild (which is where I hover each season), there has been at most 2 darkest hour warlocks.
---
**Jepetto is a perfect card** ***on its own***, because it is turn-8, and then its products cost an additional (1) each. Nothing to say about Jepetto. Combos are cool! I play Combos myself! 
---
What I am suggesting is that these Combos should happen SYSTEMATICALLY late in the game, with no possibility to cheat them out early.
---
That's just it. I am not suggesting WHAT, but WHEN. :)
---
I'm new to the game and I play a zoo/tempo warlock.  This is not one of the cards I have trouble with.   In fact if they play it turn 8 or 9 I usually always win because that means they weren't clearing my board and then next turn I play heroic innkeeper or grim rally and impferno and then I have so much damage potential its over in 1 or two turns.
---
Based on stat, rogue should be the first thing to be nerfed. If rogue is nerfed, warrior has one less favorable matchup and naturally more people will play warrior counters, warrior have to tech in silence and more removals so they may not even have room for greedy cards like elysiana+banker.
---
Playing wild for 2 years, not entering standard at all. Yes, you can play a lot of different decks but you can't avoid big priests in like every 3rd game. This deck is so unfun, so unfair and so boring to play against that I seriously want to play standard. But I know that standard is even more boring. Damn, that is so sad tbh, because I really enjoy Hearthstone and playing since beta because of it. But I have as almost as much...
---
Jade Druid and OTK Decks w no interaction have been a scourge on the game. Every other deck on your list Ive never had a problem with
---
Hmm?
---
I think he made clear that some of these decks were genuinely problematic and required nerfing. The point was to highlight how even the ones that were perfectly fine the community still bitched about. 
---
People will always both about the most popular decks at the time. The point is to realize that and not be an altogether toxic community.
---
Imagine if this game only had bad cards... everyone would play bad arena decks!
---
found the guy who disenchanted all of his rotating cards
---
There is no bad cards. Having no counter play is the design flaw.
---
Just imagine there is a card deals damage equals to opponent deck size. Then people need to think before dropping Elysiana.
---
&gt; Dr Boom's Scheme did used to do something else (summon boom boys, aoe), but changed earlier than everyone had been speculating
---
Though after the artwork was done for it apparently.
---
Aggro in card games is very similar to cannon rushing in StarCraft. You are trying to end the game as soon as possible by forcing your opponent to make the least amount of decisions required to finish the game. This in turn punishes the player harder who makes the mistake because they don't have the entire rest of the game to try and come back into the game. In StarCraft you always can beat the cannon rush but you have to make the correct decisions in the moment and you get punished harder than in a long macro game for making one tiny mistake. The same can be said for playing vs aggro in HS. If you use the wrong removal or don't use your tempo swing at the right time you will straight up lose simply because your opponent focused his deck building on ending the game early and hoping you miss play. This effect is amplified in card games due to draw rng. A "mistake" your opponent might be trying to punish is you not drawing your correct removal. This is inheritantly why aggro seems "easy" but in fact the control player is the one making less decisions.
---
I would rather they give us some proper interaction, and possibly also nerf Barnes. Otherwise we'll continue having issues with Archmage, Eternal, and resurrect (you could also nerf all three of them). Give us a "Rest in Peace" \&gt;:(
---
Currently I'd not say Big priest is T1, more T2-3, but it's a problematic deck because it is not fun to play against for most people. Thus simply making it weaker is not enough, because the deck will still feel bad to play against. 
---
As an aside, Archmage is likely going to see a nerf. The card is seeing a ton of play everywhere, with Druid and priest especially loving him.
---
Traditionally:  
---
Alexstrasza, Harrison Jones, Ysera, Cairne Bloodhoof, Baron Geddon
---
With the current meta:  
---
Harrison Jones, Alexstrasza, Ysera, Baron Geddon, Cairne Bloodhoof
---
&gt; Didn’t ask why the last expansion is so incredibly weak?
---
Which expansion?
---
I'd like to see abusive and leper gnome both unnerfed in terms of aggro. I think they would be fine, especially with the lack of charges available. 
---
I think undertaker might be still too strong in wild, but I agree regarding druid combo.
---
PTSD to Dark Harvest rework intensifies
---
Only bad player complains against big priest! Tell your rank and I tell you how bad you are!
---
Yeah, the fact that the entire deck relies on drawing a copy of one very specific spell to even do anything is a major weakness in its consistency. Sure you can try and Plot Twist to get it, but the fact that you first shuffle in your old hand before drawing for the new one makes that less likely to work. Sometimes the deck high-rolls and is crazy strong, but when it doesn't it falls apart completely. There's a reason Big Priest only got strong when multiple redundant effects were printed for it.
---
[Reynad’s analysis of how the meta game works.](https://youtu.be/qWN-LB85qsA)
---
Wild is more expensive.
---
Quit hounding the guy for a screenshot, damn.
---
Now I think about it, I've yet to see a doomsayer out of the summon 2drop lackey.
---
But heavn't you heard?
---
Any deck that beats me is bad for the game. I don't want a 50% win rate, I might as well just flip a coin. I want a 100% win rate or the game's trash.
---
&gt;  card has literally the highest winrate in the game when kept in the starting hand
---
That would actually be Thekal with 78.8% winrate when kept for Anyfin Paladin. 
---
&gt;Barnes on the other hand is good against any deck and can outright win games on his own.
---
Unless he pulls a 1/1 yshaarj, who then pulls another minion I would say Barnes is absolutely unable to win games on his own.
---
So again, this just shows that if the deck can keep their engine card in hand and play it early on curve, then they are likely to win. Be it Barnes, Keleseth or Thekal.
---
Big Priest is DEFINITELY T1 this expansion. It was T2 during Rastakhan and its much stronger than it used to be.
---
Golden monkey doesnt delay fatigue by 20 turns. It also has a huge drawback of replacing your hand so you cant keep your removals. If both sides play golden monkey, the game ends in a few turns. Warrior also didnt have dr boom hero power, which can give you more removals, when golden monkey was in standard.
---
I want to point out that prenerf razakus priest and quest rogue were both often considered not tier 1. They are still 2 of the most metawarping decks ever to exist in standard. The entire rest of the field had to completely target them, or else you lose a huge percentage of games.
---
Yea they blew over all the questions people wanted answered and continued to re explain things they've already stated
---
Even as an experienced arena player hearth arena is amazing for a second opinion if nothing else. Often late in the daft you forget about synergies with cards you drafted early on. Hearth arena reminds you and points out when a card you might overlook is actually amazing in your deck.
---
Have you tried HSReplay?
---
i think its about 25% of the meta

 [https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1268515-super-budget-token-druid](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1268515-super-budget-token-druid) 
---
Also, if you want to watch video, check out RegisKillbin on youtube.  He recently put together several budget decks (the decks with Vargoth say 3000+ because hearthpwn doesn't count it as a free card).  Hunter, Murloc Shaman, Zoo, and Token.
---
Ironically, Baku and Genn were greatly praised when they were released to the point this sub said they were the best designed cards ever. But people got tired of them and started to complain, and of course they blamed Blizzard for it.
---
Here we go because even though we have a fresh meta, people are hating meta decks like Bomb Warrior and Token Druid (and soon other decks I bet ), again.
---
I think he means the warlock hero powers, they *technically* deal 2 damage
---
Not aware of the current meta, but there's a lot of power spikes (like Reno, Tunnel Trogg) and inevitability (Jades, Resurrect). To be more precise, the power level in Wild being as high as it is leads to Aggro being *really* aggressive, Control having *extreme* removal, etc. I and many others enjoy a more grounded game.
---
I have a lot of issues with Wild, but wasn't really looking to dive into them. I just got annoyed by the meme.
---
Is it the one linked above?
---
paying the same dust value for cards with half the usage value in a format that requires WAY more core legendaries while also having stale metas of odd paladin and rez priest strikes me as more expensive in dust value.
---
“Holds darkest hour in check”? Big priest is one of the most favored matchups for darkest hour warlock.
---
Why would that card need to be nerfed
---
Rofl, that's all this comment deserves, and now i'm done with you, troll. Bye Felicia.
---
For starters, ressing a minion should remove it from the pool.
---
Thank you.  I enjoyed this much more.  The other "honest" hearthstone cards aren't honest, it is just salty or meta commentary.
---
Other examples off the top of my head:
---
Archivist Elysiana
---
10 mana, 3 attack, 2 health
---
Battlecry: Discover 5 cards.  Replace your deck with 2 copies of each.  Transform a card in your hand into Archivist Elysiana
---
Catrina Muerte
---
8 mana, 6 attack, 8 health
---
At the end of your turn, summon Catrina Muerte
---
Savannah Highmane (neutral)
---
6 mana, 6 attack, 4 health
---
Deathrattle: Summon four 1/1 scrolls
---
Sea Giant:
---
10 mana, 8 attack, 8 health
---
Costs (1) less for each minion on the battlefield.
---
Battlecry: If there are 9 other minions, gain +1 attack and rush
---
Standard meta is about the same level of variance. Tempo Rogue, Control/Bomb Warrior (technically two decks but they're pretty close), Token Druid, Zoolock, Conjurer Mage, and debatably Mech Hunter. Murloc Shaman appears every now and then, but not enough to be "meta".
---
RIP
---
the point hes making is that c'thun is unplayable because of the stupid cancer decks that are much more oppressive due to the unrestricted nature of wild.

This meme would be a lot better if the guys over at vS didn't do such a good job of compiling stats clearly showing the distribution of all the major archetypes lol.
---
The only problem is the single player stuff gets stale after a while. I play the hell out of them when they get released and you just kind of make most of the decks eventually. It is still fun to do a run or 2 every now and then as a break though.
---
"it would confuse new players"
---
What a crock of shit
---
In lower ranks, Big Priest runs a lot more rampant than the ranks they use to gather information on VS.
---
Big Priest is Tier 2, but it's high T2, only because the only decks that can be T1 are the decks that beat it. The meta is carved by Big Priest. Remember Quest Rogue? You know, unnerved QR, that was totally fair and not meta warping at all because it was Tier 2? Oh wait, a Tier 2 deck was format-warping because all the other decks had to play into or around queuing vs Quest Rogue. Saying its playrate is 8.3% (by far the highest of any deck in Wild) and it's only a Tier 2 deck (because the top tier is catered around beating Big Priest) is super unfair when you consider it the RNG-oppressive menace it is.
---
Most decent Tier 1 decks that beat it *also* still has to tech against Big Priest hard to beat it. Many Tier 2 decks have to warp their gameplan to get a 48% vibrate against Priest too. The meta is not friendly to offmeta. Either you build a deck that reliably beats Big Priest, or you're going to have a lot of difficulty rising above Rank 18. I say this as someone whose reached Wild Legend. Big Priest is not a fair deck.
---
Kingsbane has counters that arent dead against other decks. Odd or Aggro Pally decks can be out tempoed or hit with strong removal. Murloc decks lose to removal and taunts and fast tempo. Priest is beaten by EXACTLY transform effects or decks that can consistently deal 10 damage a turn or can kill it before Turn 6.

How is that a problem?
---
It's just that Control warrior has too many removals and  powerful hero card. It's not because Ellysiana is bad coz we had shuffle or anti control fatigue grindy matchups earlier. Mill rogue, togg druid, Jade idol, espionage etc. Ellysiana is fine and I find her an interesting card.
---
Indeed, however i will always dislike Mech Mage.
---
It's pretty hard to *not* climb in this game. This doesn't really make any sense. If you're any good at the game and play a half-decent deck, you'll hit the rank 5 threshold easily, at which point you then complain about 90% of the games being the same exact matchup.
---
Definitely helps in the beginning to get a feel for what makes cards good in Arena - but don't rely on it completely. Rounding out your curve with synergies is more important than just picking the best cards in a vacuum.
---
Anime girls seems legit though VoHiYo
---
People always attempt to refute the expense argument with a list of well-performing aggro decks that have a stupidly high winrate, totally ignoring the fact that almost no one actually gives a shit about winning or losing. Only the most metally inept sociopaths equate winrate with fun, but they're the most vocal advocates for Wild.
---
Sure they do. The Wild meta's not really that different. Different decks, sure, but it's the same shit just a different package.
---
the problem with HSReplay is that you often get Bad Decks, like also on Hearthpwn. This is the reason why i do this.
---
To be honest with you, I'd much rather have either Shadow Essence, Eternal Servitude or Obsidian Statue nerf (or all three) than Barnes. The deck is super consistent against everything that isn't super aggressive and weapon-based because of all these amazing board clears Priest have on its disposal, and we're getting to the point when people will start cutting Barnes just because there will be better options - Resurrect Priest got three new auto-include cards this expansion (which is A LOT for an oppressive high tier Wild deck)!
---
Yeah, playing against Barnes on turn 3 or 4 feels terrible, but they did say 
---
 the reason they refuse to nerf the deck is that lots of people (apparently) love playing it because of its highroll potential. And to be honest I'd much rather have something similar to the new Big Warlock that can highroll hard or just lose hard than dealing with guaranteed spawn on turn 5/6, resurrection of your chosing and infinite healing/killing your minions with Deathrattles.
---
Its only "the best" because it does nothing but stall. Put something that puts pressure on your opponent in your deck and she's suddenly a non-issue. 
---
This has already been done and proven to work, continuing to play a hard fatigue deck is your own choice.
---
Came here to say the same. Token druid basically vanishes when you hit legend, it's crazy. I've played quite a lot in legend and could count the token druids on one hand. The only thing I typically see that isnt rogue or warrior is shaman.
---
I feel so much better doing f2p. I bought both bundles for Boomsday and was super disappointed with my lackluster pulls from decks.
---
For the last two expansions I've been able to save around 10k gold, buy 50 packs and then do arena until I hit a legendary or get bored. I still get all the commons, most rares, a decent amount of epics and a few legendaries. I have enough dust saved I can craft missing epics and legendaries for decks I know are good or that I will enjoy.
---
I feel much better just playing a few games a day and having fun without having to spend $150 to $400 a year just to get a partial set.
---
You disconnected.
---
"We're happy with the money we are making and see no reason to make a decision that would only profit the players, artifact didnt work out so we still have no competition"
---
You said "hero cards" which have nothing to do with what the other person was talking about. I don't give a fuck about your 'meaning' I was simply pointing out how stupid you are.
---
It being a 2 tier deck in Wild for as long as it has means its still an incredibly strong deck. Cards/decks aren't nerfed just based on win-rate; how fun is it losing to a turn 4 Barnes?
---
I’m not at legend so I wouldn’t know anything about Jade Druid. I didn’t “leave it out” in the manner you’re asserting. 
---
Also, I think my point is being misunderstood. These 6 decks have been largely the same decks dominating the meta for over a year. I don’t think that’s variety. Year of the Mammoth cards along with Genn and Baku have warped the Wild format. 
---
There hasn’t been true variety since before Kobolds, IMO. Maybe even since Un’Goro.
---
they should consider it
---
Guys, I cannot stress this enough, **start playing Kingsbane Rogue!**
---
The deck is really good against it and the more people will start playing it, the less of Priests we will see (eventually).
---
"the right support" for this card won't come, because you'll break the game with other cards before you get halfway there.
---
Nothing compare to fcking mage around there.
---
I don't think you know what xD means
---
I hope you make it! I was stuck on rank 3 for the past year and couldnt make it out untill now!
---
Are you playing on EU? Some people I know + me got disconnects alot recently.
---
It is a good card though. It's only relevant in very niche situations. Most of the time you never play it, and it's always a bad draw since you'd rather it was the last card in your deck.
---
If you find yourself in that situation a lot, try playing a different deck that ends the game sooner. You'll get away from Elysiana completely since it will never be relevant in your games.
---
It's much less of a problem than what tunnel trog -&gt; totem golem used to be imo.
---
With any card game, the objectively good and "value" cards are always going to bubble to the top and make decklists. Are you frustrated that these good cards make it into decks, get posted and shared and then ultimately used? Well have fun playing literally any TCG out there dude, that's how it works. You get a shell of a deck or a card and you build around it, the deck sees play, does well, gets shared. This meta right now is completely different than what we were seeing before, if you disagree with that, then you need to go take a look at the oppressive meta that just rotated out. Games are playing out a lot differently now instead of queing into a match with Odd Paladin for the 20th time of the day and seeing the same curve and gameplay. I've played against several different types of decks in the last 2 weeks and it's been extremely fresh and fun. You're complaining to complain and not making any good arguments. Delete your post.
---
I wasn’t playing back then. Side note, not sure why the random downvotes in this subreddit. I sorted by new before bed and everything on the page was at 0.
---
I hated how they nerf Raza as I like using it for basic hero power only. Raza + Justicar Trueheart was my favorite combo and it can somewhat stand up to Raza Priest. Assuming they are not the OTK variant.
---
Easy to blame the game when it's consistently a rng crapfest.
---
No, the process they describe is final design, not final balance/bug playtesting. Final design for this set happened last fall.
---
But how often do they drop Barnes on 4? UI is just as unfun to play against and it was never nerfed. When BP hits it's curve it is nuts but it is not nearly as consistent as other decks. Odd Pally has been tier 1 for how long now and no one complains about that, when it can close out games by turn 5 way more consistently than BP drops Barnes on 4.
---
It's the circle of liiiife.
---
Just play with ur friend or another account🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I quit a year ago, the game is not well made or managed
---
I've been f2p in this game for the past couple years. I can't support blizz financially with how terrible their price model is.
---
Yeah Pyromancer is really underrated and I'm surprised it was omitted. Sound the bells + Pyro is a pretty good clear since it can also leave a body on the board.
---
I mean, I love HS and I would love to spend a little amount of money every now and then ( little amount of money = from 5 to 30 € ) but the way they treat their playerbase and their money is terrible. Either you spend 10 € or you have to spend 50 or more € and you are actually gambling the value of your money. With the current pack system with 130€ you could end up with 4 legendaries and a handful of epics ( not protected by the no duplicate rule ). I won't spend a dime under these conditions.
---
OMG I DID HAVE A STROKE LMFAO
---
You’re right, they’re not even big boys. Someone did this to me on ranked today and pulled alex, maly, and a ton of big boys. It was like a big darkest hour dragon warlock. I need it.
---
Yep, that made me roll my eyes so hard they came back around.  The current iteration of 'tempo rogue' is the most consistent 20 dmg from hand aggro deck ever made.  Implying that the complaints are anything less than justified is idiotic.
---
There were too many junk cards
---
Do you have a decklist?
---
It was never removed from the pool of random two cost minions though...
---
or is this a whoosh moment on my part?
---
In actually playing wizzbang from rank 20. In at 7 right now. You dont need to play the same 3 decks to climb. Just have fun with it and master all 18 decks .
---
Maybe it is the connection. Though I play in many places using both 4g and wifi, but maybe it just happens more under certain circumstances and I'm just not picking up on it. I'll probably get back to it in time, but I'm taking a little break for now. Good luck to you in arena though! Who knows, maybe you were my phantom loss haha
---
He has to go to the battlenet account and purchase the KoFT single Player content. It won't cost him anything, the purchase will be free, but for procedural reasons, the single player content is no longer available in-game, and has to be purchased from the store for it to show up in-game. So just ask him to log in and complete the purchase from the battlenet store, the cart should be free upon checkout.
---
What’s mind spike?
---
&gt; The worst part about mechacthun is that you will not be able to beat any deck with any sort of aggression (token druid, any rogue, bombs will kill you).
---
I've been playing a full Mecha'thun list since the expansion and can say this is not true. To take each of your examples:
---
* Token Druid - Unfavored but definitely winnable. I run an extra Whirlwind to help with this matchup.
---
* Rogue - Highly favored and currently farming rogues at 89% win rate.
---
* Bomb Warrior - Even. Most of my losses against warrior happen because they pick up Beryllium Nullifier off Omega Assembly, not because of bombs.
---
The real threats to Mecha'thun warrior are mech hunter and mech paladin, anything that builds one big mech you can't remove.
---
That would actually be op cause reduce effects affects max hp so every cast the target would lose 2 max hp (30 to 28 to 26 and goes on).
---
Well you dont get to pick your opponent at any rank so you have to personal adjust to the current match ups you face at any rank. A good deck is a good deck if played correctly at any rank. 
---
The only real thing that makes a top tier net deck is the player controlling it.
---
I think that only applies to Tyrande, not card backs.
---
x 9
---
Less so in Year of the Raven because combo decks were very well-supported.  Also, infinite value kind of rendered the control gameplan moot.  Odd Warrior was T1 by times, but not all the time.
---
Fellow f2P here. Tavern Brawls are your friend. And if you can get decent in Arena, you'll have no real issues.
---
Wtf is Ice Spike and Deadeye
---
Do you find that the dust cost of these decks is up, down, or about the same as usual?
---
Control warrior is not oppressive and Elysiana was not printed to punish them. I don't think anyone is saying that.
---
Real bromance right there.
---
With the way that legendaries work in packs, it just means that you can get the same bad legendary again.
---

It is both:)
---
Blastmaster Boom is going to be in standard for two years so you might not have the dust now but you could have later. He is very strong and only requires, a few cards to make it work. If you dust it, you might reopen later if you still open Shadow packs. You're only getting 400 dust so it's never great to dust legendaries.  
---
However, warrior decks are almost always very expensive (multiple epics and legendaries) so if you don't see yourself playing with it and you really need the dust now, it's your choice.
---
10 mana 1/4 Druid
---
Battlecry: Shuffle a copy of your starting deck make all cards golden
---
I think the idea is to have some way of presenting a threat. If you don't have any threats, then warrior just sits and armors up/does nothing.
---
Power of Creation is kinda hard to clear since the body it generates should ideally be out of War Path range.. and the only answer is brawl which isn't a guaranteed clear.
---
I hope they'll be high quality situational tech cards like Harrison, Tinkmaster, and Geddon.
---
Kingsbane Rogue, Big Priest and Freeze Mage are the only three decks I’ve properly hated playing against.
---
Oh, alright then. I'm actually more excited for older card backs :)
---
Controllock and dragon priest were also occasionally T1 and Bigspell mage was consistently T2.
---
Nibba want a scholarship?
---
But he was gonna be in Standard for the rest of time, and Zilliax’s batteries only last another year.
---
that was wild from start to finish
---
The thing is when piloted shredder was popular people would get a random 2 drop very frequently. When piloted shredder was gone there were significantly less options to get a random 2 drop on your board.
---
Now when lackeys are popular in arena and ranked its back again
---
I’d also accept better disenchant ratios for dust. Make it 50% dust back all the way down the line, not just for golden legendaries.
---
you want sets to be on the same power level as KotFT and K&amp;C?
---
They are not super common anymore, at least according to HSReplay.
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;rarity=LEGENDARY&amp;sortBy=includedPopularity
---
Baku is at 7.5% while Genn is at 4.3%. So less than 12% of decks.
---
It's surprising to me how they kind of disappeared but Odd/Even decks are still good, IMO.
---
Almost every complaint he listed that people had was either with charge minions or powerful cards which can be discounted.
---
Shudderwock is still a card
---
That's fair, I still don't like the RNG gamble that comes with the matchup but I'm aware that there are other approaches that can maybe make the matchup less cancerous to sit through.
---
I'd rather see Boom's "Discover a Mech" hero power removed.  That's the part that makes him go infinite.  Eventually, after a long, long time, Warrior could run out of removal if it weren't for Boom refilling mechs periodically.
---
Either that, or remove the discover part of the hero power so you get a random mech.  Both would power down the hero significantly, along the axis of the highest current abuse I think.
---
Control Shaman, I'm not convinced it is a problem due to the lack of Omega Assembly.  But I haven't played against many of them, and of course team5 would need to test Shaman to make sure it didn't just become the next OP class after warrior.
---
What a waste of time to type out all of that
---
Holy shit I must try it now
---
I have had some pretty sick decks in the past although i wasnt always using the app. Recently i had a 76.4 mage deck thats all i can remember.
---
1 and 2 are part of their routine...it's their job and duty as caretakers of the game.....them making changes to problem cards is not "outperforming expectations" it should be meeting expectatations...
---
3 is irrelevant to the big picture. No one quit this game because a priest portrait wasn't available. This also takes almost zero effort to make happen because it already existed 
---
4 is cool. 
---
5 is lol bullshit answer..."will try to figure something out....ignore the fact we said this before and have still put nothing together but ya, believe me this time."
---
You have seriously low expectations for this company. Setting the bar low for this team does nothing for the community. Only a real fanboy would say this was amazing answers.

Mulligan guide? Any advice per matchup? I want to try this one, currently sitting a R4. Thanks!
---
Pretty much this
---
Have they really stopped meaningful updates?  I guess they release fewer heroes now, but the balance patches are still regular.
---
That said, what they did to HotS esports is enough.  They ruined a lot of people's careers with no warning.  Actiblizz shouldn't get off scot free for that.

Ziliax in any normal deck is pretty good.
---
Ziliax in control warrior who can actually use the magnetic is ridiculous. The card probably shouldn't have had magnetic.
---
U mean to say to summon the 🅱️ancient one ??
---
You will regret this!
---
I think part of the reason mechs are great at the moment is because warrior is the meta defining class at the moment (IMO). Using mech negates on of warriors best removal options in liiiight the fuses
---
Ukab, the Suneater: Start of the Game. If you have only odd cost cards in your deck, you have no even cost cards in your deck
---
 I have not but will you elaborate on it more? I'm quite interested!
---
Sorry if I've been misrepresenting it, but its not that you *need* to concede. Control decks in Magic do have win conditions. It's just that actually sitting there and going through the motions for them to draw and execute it after they've locked up the game could take 10+ turns. That might sound bad but the turns leading up to that point are very meaningful.
---
You’re not dumb. That’s literally how he phrased it.
---
&gt;spell checks for the conditions as it's cast
---
I never said anything regarding whether it "count itself" or not.
---
You literally stated "spells checks for the conditions as it's cast not before it's cast" and all I did was show that there's a contradiction to that statement
---
The problem is, many people can.
---
Every expansion they have such a buttload of money from preorders it´s crazy. And they know it. Just looking through this sub when there were threads about how many packs everyone is getting, I was baffled to see how many commenters said they had 100+ packs (non-gold) and preorders ready.
---
And that´s the thing. Blizzard knows it´s fine. They are basically printing money every xpac. And those few reddit threads about people being sad about the HS economy don´t bother them because next xpac all those who preordered before will preorder again.
---
The only thing that actually works is not giving them money. But sadly, that is easier said then done when so many people are buying packs and preorders in masses.
---
just got scammed by  FvckAIIah # 1809,  i should have checked the scammer list
---
Hell, just making commons disenchant for 10 dust instead of 5 dust would give people about 20% more dust.  I'd take that for a start.
---
Commons disenchant for way less than other rarities compared to their crafting value, and the only reason for it is purely to make the game more expensive.
---
Ahh, my brain for some reason was thinking statue was 9 health and 8 mana instead of 8 health and 9 mana.
---
&gt;Questions were selectively answered, A lot of "we have no plans for x feature"
---
Your reaction to the second is part of the reason they do the first.
---
I'd pay $10 for that legendary card.
---
that is logically what it would be if they changed it.
---
They say that for every single expansion now. That "X expansion is made in Y way for the future of the game", and then the pay-off quite literally never comes. Your logic is flawed, and I bet if I said "Why is Rise of Shadows so weak?" You'd say "because it's set-up for the coming year, it isn't meant to be powerful." and then if I asked "Why is the second expansion of this year so weak?" you'd say "because it's set-up for the coming year." And then if I ask, "Why is the third expansion this year so weak?" you'd just say "because it's a set-up for the coming year." This was literally a defense used for all three sets from last year.
---
Can we get some expansions that are designed to be for *when they are release* instead of a future that never comes? Because when the future comes it's always "...it's to set up for..." every time.
---
I’ve been around continuously since beta.
---
And if your expectation is going to be “literally everything new they are doing should have been done three years ago” then obviously you will be disappointed.
---
Bottom line, they didn’t dodge the questions I wanted answered, ones I searched the topic to find, so I am pleasantly surprised.
---
Same happens when I play Big Rogue (except when I forget about magnetising and play it alone)
---
Need blood bloom first
---
Depends if an ok deck is worth a craft.  Your assessment of it is accurate.  If you value fun more and you think you'd enjoy it, sure.  If your focus is competitive performance, it's way to early to craft only 'ok' decks.
---
I liked the WTOG reveal too but she wasn’t the main villain of the expansion like Rafaam, Tog, Hahatha and Dr. Boom were. She also hasn’t done anything particularly villainous besides having some connection the Old Gods.
---
Pick any tier 1/2 deck, then treat the game like a second job instead of the toilet distraction that it is.
---
I was definitely there, free2play up to Rhastakan because I was right to the pity limit on legendaries and spending felt bad.  I quit playing in December, picked it up right after this expansion dropped and through all the quests I opened 2 legendaries from this expansion and 2 others from previous packs (including a golden zilliax).  I spent 25 and got two more legendaries.  Either Blizzard analyzed my shit and realized I was getting fed up, or, it all comes around haha.
---
maybe you have seen too much Voidlords
---
Thanks I’ll probably end up crafting it as it’s only about 1600 dust total. I’ve been getting kinda bored with stale meta decks so hopefully this’ll be a change.
---
this needs to be nerfed in wild.
---
you cant even play any spells either
---
token has 2 board fillers. Itll remove their win condition.
---
There's no thought or strategy involved in Murloc decks -- just put down as many as you can, buff with effects, and win. No challenge, no fun.
---
Genuine question: why are you running this deck in wild? What wild cards do you need for this deck? Just asking since both nomi and rebuke are standard. Is it just so you have the tar creepers and out of my jungles? I guess standard is pretty dire the options for control paly but it is possible to do still in standard.
---
Arguing about Orc/Half Orc hygiene is peak r/hearthstone
---
Could do this with Bill, except that no one runs booms scheme
---
Madam Lazul is evil.
---
Anduin is good guy.
---
That's pretty different, compared to Warlock (or Warrior to some). Rafaam is evil, so is Gul'dan.
---
Nozdormu has not purpose in the current meta. It is strictly a fun card that no one runs.
---
And the worst part? Baku and Odd Paladin, the reason why it was nerfed into an even cost? It was HoF'd, so now there's no excuse for Equality costing 4 mana.
---
That's the thing is that this card is poorly designed even though it isn't overpowered or overplayed. OP isn't the only way a card can be bad, and like I said it affects certain players more than others.
---
Don't have emotional relationships with companies.  Don't hate them, but especially don't love them.  If you think what they're selling is worth what they're charging, buy.  If you enjoy the game at the amount your comfortable playing, play.  If you think your friend would do both of those, recommend.  But never care, a company cannot.
---
How about if the new hero was altered so that you could tell that it was a new edition - different colour garments or something?
---
Ever since the random card back was introduced, I am not as keen to acquire old card backs -- it does seem like cheating -- but I really like seeing them in my opponent's hand -- some of the artwork is just awesome.
---
What struggles do you have?
---
- Archivist - makes the game look like random crap on camera = bad press.
---
- Barnes/Warlock spell - breaking wild.
---
The pickaxe is a candidate (too good, too reliable) and I believe the forest thing that creates treants as death rattle will be HoFed.
---
If you want to play long games classes, you get long-games. it's simple as that.
---
Games ending 3-7 minutes if you play aggro.
---
This was basically my experience as well. Used to do all the pre-orders + another $50-$100 each expansion and would be left feeling cheated with how little of the decks I wanted to make after spending so much money.
---
After a couple years of not playing I'm now jumping back in but only planning to do F2P. (my drop money on the single player content)
---
iNfInItE vAlUe
---
Haha thanks for posting this. I haven’t seen this in a long time and my god the animation quality was so good! :)))
---
Lets nerf a card that no one ever put in any deck in all of Hearthstone history!
---
yeah i think it would be really cool if you opened a craft whatever legend card. honestly i would rather get a craft your own legend than a golden legend as it feels bad disenchanting a legend even if its not one you were planning on using.
---
&gt;There aren't different versions of this sub either
---
Yes there are.  If you don't like this post, read a different one.  If you don't like that user, block them or whatever, you won't see their posts.  Reddit, unlike Blizzard, is not a monolithic entity.
---
&gt;how I would know that you are right compared to professionals?
---
You could weigh my statements on their merit???  What???  How do you think people become professionals?  They are game designers because they are good at what they do, they are not good at what they do because they are game designers.  Game designers do not have the monopoly on knowledge of what is fun in a game.
---
&gt;And repetitive gameplay is a good or a bad thing?
---
Both!  It's good when the game is a little bit predictable, otherwise there's no strategy.  But it's not good when it's too predictable, because then it's boring.
---
&gt;The only decks that didn't have counters ... , Blizzard nerfed
---
Blizzard also nerfs decks that do have counters.  Even if a deck has counters, if the counters are weak in the meta, then the deck is too strong.  Hell, even if the deck *isn't* too strong, sometimes it gets nerfed anyway if it's really unfun to play against, like Quest Rogue.
---
&gt;You seriously believed that this sub's complaining did it lol?
---
You can't prove that the sub has nothing to do with nerfs, and I can't prove that it did have to do with nerfs, so we're just going to have to ignore this point.  We can't really prove if complaining is good or bad as far as motivating good changes to the game goes.
---
&gt;Why they don't nerf Barnes
---
Well, that's because they know they can freely ignore Wild, they've been doing it for years... but like I said, we're not going to prove things one way or another here.  I'm pointing out that there is an argument, I'm not claiming that the argument is correct.
---
&gt;point out an online card game with at least those parameters
---
I can point out an online game that's better than Hearthstone pretty easily, MTGA is a better game than hearthstone.  If that's what you want.  I wouldn't say MTGA is 95% perfect or anything, but at least the devs seem like they're trying.
---
&gt;on them it's not really mistakes.
---
What does that matter to me?  If they make the game more expensive on purpose, you want me not to complain about that?  I understand it, I don't think it's likely to change if I complain, but complaining seems like just about the only thing I can do about that.
---
&gt;doomsayers
---
So when HS is making less money, getting less search queries, getting less viewers on twitch, streamers are quitting... nevermind, not even going to start with this one.
---
I can't 100% confirm, but it is also possible that he was on another server
---
Nomi works because it’s difficult to deal with that. Either you run priest down with damage what can prove to be difficult or leave for mid/late game and somehow find 3 board clears or a way to kill 7 6/6. Note that between you likely to have to deal with at least 2 7/8 0 mana, up to 4 if he uses the sense on that. It’s not uncommon priest have nomi on table on turn 9.
---
Wild decks can win by turn 4/5/6 (or have the game virtually sealed, such as Y'Shaarj in Big Priest's resurrect pool).
---
Standard decks may be able to win some games (Aggro Druid is powerful in both formats, with the Wild version only having about 10 Wild exclusive cards to boost the power level), but Standard decks are not tuned to beat the extreme power of Wild.
---
There are Wild decks that are very cheap (Inner Fire Priest, Silence Priest, Aggro Druid, Mech Hunter), so I would recommend trying those rather than a Standard deck.
---
I actually find the Elysiana games fun most of the time, and I'm not the only one. That's what a lot of divisive cards come down to- a lot of people enjoy them, a lot don't, and a lot don't care that much either way. It's just that those who don't like them tend to be the loudest, because why make a big deal if you're mostly happy?
---
youre implying that a few f2p kids bragging about keeping their empty wallets away from blizzard is in any way shape or form going to cause a slight drop in revenue. blizzard is a gaming titan and doesnt need to adhere to the rules that f2p players want them to play by, they make the rules and profit harder due to that. their stock and shareholder security isnt reliant on a small minority of f2ps that are willing to boycott them over a reddit circlejerk. monopolization is quite a factor that you are undermining here... thats really how multi billion dollar marketplaces work. ignore the niche broke kids on reddit and price for the mainstream audience with money to spend.
---
On wild? Just play shudder with loatheb and the 5 Mana copy guy
---
I have Tyrande but some of the old card backs I missed due to being unable to play. It would be awesome to have a chance to get them
---
I think they'll add some cards with Rush to the classic set. Since it's such a great keyword and they seem to use it a lot it would make sense that new players are introduced to it in the classic set.
---
Start of game:  The game begins.
---
It affects certain players more than others because it’s supposed to be primarily used as a tech card. After future expansions, a meta may develop which involves a combo which requires a lot of time, such as APM priest from last year. In the new specialist format, we may see more Nozdormu (although unlikely). Nonetheless, I think he has his niche place and is designed well, even though it’s a weak card.
---
Thanks for the downvote and the armchair market analytics, but I'm explaining to you how it is, not how I think it should be.
---
What was the nerf?
---
you can't seriously suggest that Kazakus warlock, priest and Mage felt like the same class... they played totally different.
---
Same with jade cards the class set really changed how you played with them, Druid was dominant and relied on ramp/going infinite but jade rogue while less dominant played totally different (focusing more on copying/bounce effects to grow jades and in my opinion was infinitely more fun to play)
---
You really don't need Nomi, shudderwock is already a 6/6 so just use 3x doppelgangster (with zola)
---
Big warrior is still control warrior. It's not a mirrored decklist but the whole point is you don't need Elysiana. If Elysiana is your only win con vs control...of course it's going to warp the match up lol.
---
