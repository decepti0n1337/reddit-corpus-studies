I did it with the 5/6 side swapper. Teammate windfuried it and won quickly. Helps if your teammate understands your choices

How did Raimi get away with this?
---
"Rough day?"
---
While his deck certainly is frustrating it seems like he often loses to his own mindgames pulling something weak from your deck. I personally find Zuramat much harder with his 2 mana silence and kill a minion heropower and way too many void callers.

Baron for sure.

Good luck to anyone trying to get a non-retarded player
---
Yeah I really miss having the even barely minimal removal I had in my warrior and hunter decks. I know I‚Äôm in trouble when I‚Äôm using my tokens for board control, but that hasn‚Äôt happened very often and about half the time I come out on top. Bigs fuck me up pretty bad if they stick.
---
Buy this man a drink!
---
Frog, Shark, and Tiger all saw or see play. Not a great sucess rate but how many Loa's see play? Pally only. Mage got a bit of play with Baku, and Shaman one sees fringe play but mostly has issues because Hagatha keeps your hand so full.

"this is what you get for taking my ragnaros"

ü¶ÄHearthstone coming for HBoxü¶Ä

Lol. I think it‚Äôs probably the fact that I‚Äôm on an older OS. I mean, it worked fine before the patch but now it‚Äôs broken. Same thing happened with Diablo 3 a few months back. 
---
Unfortunately I can‚Äôt upgrade my OS because I have audio hardware that is unsupported beyond where I‚Äôm at. More important to keep that working than blizzard games. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôll partition. I dunno if I want to go through the effort though. At least my phone works for now. Good luck!

Still have it?

Yeah that's about the reaction I expected. "You're a shitter" is definitely a new one, can't say I've been called a shitter before. Before you start insulting random strangers on the internet for playing the same game as you, perhaps you should learn to form a coherent sentence.

---
You can't have more than 7 minions on the board. So it doesn't trigger.
---
As far as I can tell, you had a full board when Rhonin attacked. If there's not an open spot for a minion, Noble Sacrifice won't trigger.
---
Thanks!
---
Noble Sacrifice doesn't trigger when the board is full, it needs one board space for the 2/1 to spawn.
---
You underestimate my power
---
Thanks I think I'll try this one!
---
Hero power one of your own treants. Say oops. Flamestrike, go face, win.
---
can someone give me some tips to clear the Heroic adventures? League of Explorers and Medivh one.
---
I play mostly wild so I was thinking it needed some iteration of whirlwind+double sleep with the fishes or something. This is much more elegant.
---
Barista is also neutral, so it can be used in other decks and maybe future.
---
They probably meant if the glyphs were more obvious as to which class they symbolized. Pretty easy to connect the dots (if... they knew the glyphs added every victory, that is).
---
Added you
---
Say you have a 5-cost minion in the hand. If you play 2 Summoning Portals it becomes 1-cost.
---
If what you said was correct, Summoning Portal-1 would reduce it to 3-mana from the original cost 5, and Summoning Portal-2 would reduce it to 3-mana again from the original cost 5. As a result it'd be 3-mana with 2 portals on the board. But it doesn't. So it's not reducing original mana cost. It's reducing the current cost.
---
You can't have 8 minions at once. Where is the 2/1 going to spawn?
---
Them's fighting words!
---
So it appears to be if he destroys wobbling runts or another deathrattle that fills the board during his attack phase before he switches he will self-destruct. Normally filling the board doesn't work.
---
Oh Wow
---
It's what I picked, but it's still not great.
---
Of course he gets Talanji.
---
is it random what class you get? I have been shaman every time. i even tried  conceding and restarting. 10 brawls later still morgl

But he‚Äôs got Togwaggle‚Äôs dice so it‚Äôs more like turn 1 play ancient 1 turn 4 play ancient one turn 6 play ancient one
---
Tog dice made it a lot better then that :p
---
RIP. Your opponent was probably breaking his keyboard at that point
---
Haven‚Äôt played much of the runs, no idea what it does.
---
he got the dice, so it could be a turn 2nd 4x 30/30 on board.
---
I'm getting as much enjoyment out of SS as I can, because the text I saw from Blizzard introducing the card seemed to make it VERY CLEAR that they'll be watching how it's used moving forward, and I take that to mean that if it's used too often or too much in ways Blizz doesn't like, it'll almost certainly be nerfed into the ground down the road.
---
You do. I made a smurf recently to try a F2P legend climb. The extra packs from solo adventures really helps
---
Wow.. How‚Äôd you get 17?

Its simple

How did you get one in your deck?
---
It‚Äôs simple, play Barnes, summon Blood of the Ancient One, bring him back to your hand, play Barnes, summon Blood of the Ancient One... AND SUMMON THE ZANCIENT ONE.
---
Yes!! 
---
It was so frustrating, so much so I‚Äôd just try to view the decklist image via switcher view.
---
He had 17 minions?
---
Can I make the naxx adventure appear and buy it with ingame gold?
---
Yep :-) thinking a billion + dollar company is being generous by allowing people to play free released content in a free to play game.
---
The message here is not that he thinks "it's cool". It's like a PSA for new players who don't know about this. I agree that blizz should have placed the download links in game but it is what it is.
---
 Argent#11448  Trading 80g quest on Asia. Will trade for Asia or NA.  If   you have history, I can go first. Otherwise you go first (check my    history).
---
What about lightforged draenei?
---
AND still no auto squelch.
---
Won my first time and neither of us knew or played around the break points but managed to recover both times. We we're kind of lucky on the face damage overall though barely had to heal at all. 
---
I like the coop Brawls so I played a few more and people were generally pretty responsive. Even if we weren't on the same game plan, you can use the emotes and highlighting to communicate. The threaten emote works as a good "no" and well played as the "yes." 
---
Once my partner was going to attack with our windfuried super questing adventurer, but I had just drawn divine spirit, and did the threaten emote as they got ready to attack. They emoted back and held off, and I was able to buff her enough to be able to kill the boss. We still lose because the random 10 damage went mostly to partners face before they could actually do it.
---
A wild miscalculation.
---
I also got 2 Wendy's in a row **on the same run**. One with 10 hp and one with 15 hp.  I've never seen that happened before an since it wasn't mentioned in the post I'm guessing this is a bug they are not aware of.
---
Good to know that's only a visual issue. Was wondering whether all my progress would be counted or cancelled after the fix. Not that I'm doing it only for the crowns but for now they are 70-80% of my motivation. After I get all: classes, HPs, starting decks for both normal and heroic - then I will play just for fun with whatever I find fun in some particular moment. And since I'm not there yet, I want these things to be tracked.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hopefully, it's gonna be fixed soon.
---
Don‚Äôt be silly, everyone knows you only get the doomsayers when your board is full and the enemy board is empty
---
Bugs. You solve one and create 10 more in the process.
---
I remember how exciting it was to get Old Murk-Eye... back in the days of vanilla it was really something to unlock a special card!
---
Bs.....token druid cant do it faster than murlocs. Also, salt is important for your health. No iodized salt = sleep forever.
---
It's simple:
---
Summon 2 Blood of the Ancient Ones in Dalaran Heist
---
Get the üÖ±Ô∏èAncient One
---
Use Duplatransmogrifier on it
---
Enjoy having all your minions become the üÖ±Ô∏èAncient One.
---
How much did they hit face for
---
No problem, like i said if you're still new to heatstone some things might not be clear (it doesn't really do a good job telling you this stuff). And yeah there is a rotation in constucted (mostly in april). Every time the sixth expansion is released the first 3 rotate to wild (where all sets are legal). In short every year 3 new sets are released and they will be in costructed for about 2 years, when the first set of the new year is released it pushes out the oldest 3 sets. Right now we are on the first set of the new year (Rise of shadows) this reased in april and pushed out "journey to ungoro", "Knights of the frozen throne" and "Kobolt and Cathacombs" from 2017. Right now the 3 sets of 2018 (Witchwood, Boomsday and Rastakhan's Rumble) and the first set of 2019 Rise of shadows. 
---
I hope it helps and i hope you enjoy the game. HS is more about learning the meta, and trying to predict what your opponent will do in 3-4 turn and setting up so you can handle it. As Aggro you want to make your game plan dictate the game, it's up to control to try and stabilize. Midrang is in between it's controling enough to stabilize aggro and fast enough to out-tempo control.
---
If you need cards, arena might be interesting (you draft a deck of "random" cards and try to get 12 wins, if you get 3 losses the run ends and you get rewards depending on the amount of wins, most of the times a pack +gold or dust)(p.s. you don't get to keep drafted cards like in MTG). If you get 3 wins on average it is worth it (with the potential of getting more) and you get more experienced in playing the game.  Small note arena is on a different rotation as constructed so you will see other cards than on ranked ladder.
---
T4 wispering woods, t5 double savage roar does it. There are other ways, but do math.
---
No king rules forever my son

DarkKnight#14764 NA 80 gold quest trade. You go first.

Talijanic#2757
---
I love this hand swap thing. It gives me a chance to see what amazing cards that idiot on the other side was holding on too the whole time. For example: I'm (Shamy) on extreme low health (10-14), he keeps healing himself. _nef swaps cards_ .. he's been holding onto the 4 mana drop that heals your teammate if you heal yourself.
---
 Just yesterday got mine Arthas, felt great
---
It doesn‚Äôt feel like any more of a slog than it did before though, to be fair.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre even seeing those buffs every game.  
---
Warrior probably overall got worse because Pogo Rogue seems to be a real thing now, and if it is, it is a very hard counter to warrior.
---
&gt; I really wish there was a chat function. 
---
I feel that, but the easiest solution would have been to let you see your opponent's hand. I ended up beating it with a friend and even with match chat it was extremely tedious to give each other information. Cooperative modes should have open face decks unless there is some good reason they shouldn't!
---
It could be Mecha'thun, they run a whirlwind.
---
Let's be honest tho, the warrior sucks for not having t1 eternium. Probably can't even draw Boom on 7
---
Its odd to see that deck have such crappy win rates tho.
---
Visual bugs, just hover over the deck or open it and it should go away. If tgis does not do the trick you need to wait for a fix.
---
Agreed. I have played and encountered new decks. For me, a fresh meta keeps ranked fun. The only meta that I would never liked to have seen changed was the one with Reno decks, as I am just addicted to one-of decks.
---
But generally, yes, this update is great. And I have the confidence that, should a card/deck really be busted, Blizzard will intervene more rapidly than before. 
---
Well done!
---
Thunderhead: after you play a overload card. Bl√°-bl√°-bl√° 
---
Spider bomb: deathrattle effect.
---
When spider bomb died and activated the deathrattle, it was still resolving the overload card (storm), still not considered after the overload card.
---
That doesn't look like Millhouse.
---
"Get out of my property !"
---
I did that with gruul myself lol
---
Thought I was condemning myself to a bad run with tog‚Äôs die, then the duplatransmog swooped in like a savior
---
Had like 18 Gruuls, one with +2/+2 always in my starting hand, and one with +4/+4
---
Needless to say, I made fuuls of my opponents
---
Yes and it's driving me crazy ever since.
---
The best part is when your teammate plays his 7th minion and you start emoting like a madman to convince him that hes about to make a huge mistake
---
DK Rexxar is good in just about any non-pure aggro deck.

I always like this brawl. Working together silently adds a different level of tension and seeing your partner pick up on your plan is always fun.
---
Not if you shuffle in Enemy Ziliax :D
---
It's the Rastakhan's Rumble solo adventure accessible in the Solo Adventures option from the main menu.
---
Can't but LoE at all, it was taken out years ago.
---
Now introducing Chomper
---
If you play every 2-3 days you can clear your quests in a couple hours at most. That nets me about 7k per expansion, which leads to plenty of dust on it's own.
---
I wouldn't consider a couple hours every few days ungodly
---
There's so many things wrong with this picture and I don't know where to start

Whisper
---
Look up malygos rouge, i beat him with that deck,
---
This is why I haven't chosen it. The thing is that you really need consistency during runs. It's not about crushing the opponent one run and then losing the next one. Barely beating every round is much better.
---
Top decking the exact card right before lethal but instead you feel like yugioh and drop the oops and lethal that hoe on rope
---
You can't dust most cards that you can't get from packs. That includes SN1P-SN4P.
---
It was made in a Jaina era and suffered because of that I think

So you see how a veteran, to make it in 18 hours straight, used a meta deck that required some good luck to not get smashed, squeezing dust from everything he could. You expect a mr anyone to do that AND to constantly hit high ranks for dust? Rank 5 is like 400 dust after the rank ladder closes? Plus if you are this lucky master genius and have a ton of free time to waste, you can make up to 100 gold per day, which is 1 pack per day. Duplicate commons give like 5 dust. From a good monthly run totally dedicated how much do you expect to gain? 500/700 dust? Let's subtract about 1K dust to squeeze at the start of your adventure if you were that knowledgeable, and you get to 3,2k dust in 3 months. If you are a genius.

Careless whisper
---
I sort of agree with you. I don't think just sticking a mech is enough, but whoever's 2 drop sticks usually wins every game. Lot of broken cards in these set, not enough comeback mechanics. Could be that I am just so used to playing in arena metas with rush and lifesteal that, but this is the first meta where I feel like games just end on one swing turn every game and it really sucks. 
---
And im not even coming as a sore loser, I am winning a lot of games too but it doesn't have the same back and forth swings it used to. To me, Rasthakan was arena's golden age with abundant rush and lifesteal, (overkill was a solid arena mechanic too) to keep games in check. It felt like a sum of your decisions amounted to a win, rather than one swing turn determining the entire game.

What lol. Rain of roads does NOT need a buff. Neither does akali. Akali is not a bad card it just doesn‚Äôt have much support. The more rush cards that are printed the better it gets.

Hello
---
A deck I made a few days ago was missing 9 cards when I logged in yesterday.  I thought I might have been stoned or something but it was a priest deck and northshire cleric had been removed which I am 100% sure I would never do, no matter how high.  The only connection I can think of is that it had a couple extra arms as part of the deck, which I put in post-buff .
---
Right, but the more aggro decks there are to counter the pogo decks the better matchups your control decks have.
---
&lt;Inconceivable!&gt;
---
Definitely want to do that; the one time I drafted that passive I lost to the 7th boss :(
---
Good job for doing the math
---
 /whisper: pssst am I too late to get in on this?!
---
Control warrior and shaman were and still are perfectly viable dekcs. Because they still farm these aggro decks which easily outnumber pogo rogues.
---

As it takes some hate what you are saying there, imo it is still a card game that's RNG Based, so let the legend players draw bad cars, high at the beginning yk, and the "normal" player have insane start luck. That's one way to go, but with exact cards, setup etc, the legend will probably win more often.
---
Pst pst...
---
It‚Äôs not a joke, that‚Äôs not the point
---
I see a lot of people playing it even at high Legend. I don't think it's that trash or else they probably wouldn't have sustained their rank there. Regardless of the power level, I think it just sucks from a design/fun standpoint.
---
Look at the parent comments and tell me what they say. Grasping so much at straws won't get you anywhere.
---
But would it then be reduced to two?
---
Maybe we are paying him in John Wick universe coins.
---
I think you need to go back, read the question I asked you, and think about what it actually means and why none or what you‚Äôre saying is in any way relevant.
---
I think ragging too hard on Dr. Boom's Scheme is unfair, they did admit they had to change the design at the last minute. It's a similar situation to the Thrall Deathknight which clearly had something to do with lolfreezeshaman mechanics before a last minute change.
---
I'm a huge nerd for Old God lore and I felt like they nailed the flavor of three so well, but the on that bugs me is Y'Shaarj. For those who don't play the Hearthstone MMO, Y'Shaarj was an ichorous eldritch horror that was empowered by folks succumbing to the emotions of Anger, Despair, Doubt, Fear, Hatred, Pride, and Violence. Him just recruiting a minion out of your deck does not jive at all with a pretty huge lore figure's actual power set.
---
I was playing Pogo Rogue and I actually lost to a Bomb Warrior. Granted I feel the Bomb Warrior got really lucky as he hit me with 5 bombs where I still had 17 cards left in my deck. I think Cyclone Mage can also win if they make a bunch of giants early on.
---
I have not played Pogo Rogue enough to know how consistently it gets high rolls compared to Bomb and Cyclone decks. Those decks can have explosive starts and can also play the long control game. Pogo Rogue so far feels a little similar to Cyclone Mage in that it has these passive turns into periodic explosive turns.
---
YTA - They have a quest to spectate a friend win a game and letting them spectate costs you nothing.
---
When someone straight up explodes when you kill them and they come right back (and aren't a machine or undead) there's no way it's not anything but a bug.
---
Theres no way devs didn't see huge early pogos coming. Its inconsistent enough that its not breaking the meta or forcing people to complain about it, but it happens enough that after playing the deck a few times you get a cool memorable board state, its like a Johnny combo deck that just happens to go off turn 2 once every 20 games.
---
Overwatch does that I guess. Maybe blizzard could learn with the company that made it... oh wait
---
Same on Android. It only seems to happen for a deck I built with autocomplete to begin with but could be a coincidence.
---
Spaghetti
---
People are also including a lot of shitty cards. Deck's in early stages. It probably won't be good, but it also won't be such a trainwreck.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;I stopped playing long ago
---
&gt;&gt;Then why are you still here bitching?
---
&gt;To follow the news and the memes.
---
&gt;Why are you gatekeeping?
---
&gt;That's what people were saying about Shudderwock and archetype still got nerfed. First of all you don't even know what the winrate of the optimized deck will be, people are still experimenting. 
---
Quest Rogue, Kingsbane Rogue, and Shudderwock Shaman weren't hit by card changed because they broken. They were hit becuase they were polarized *and* unusually unfun to play against.
---
&gt; It doesn't even have a separate archetype on hsreplay yet.
---
Tempo Rogue seems to have absorbed the card by replacing most of the Pirate support for it, Togwaggle's Scheme, and other support cards.
---
Granted, the stats on Pogo Hopper itself shows decks with the card in it only have a forty-one percent winrate.
---
&gt; And secondly Quest Rogue too didn't have a stellar winrate, it still was degenerate and was nerfed many times. 
---
That is true. However, with new cards like Viscious Scalehide added to the deck, Quest Rogue could also reasonably combat aggression. The same goes with Kingsbane Rogue as Rumble was released. With how little time Pogo Hopper really still has in Standard an, I doubt such a similar occurrence is on the Horizon.
---
I know that Zilliax into a big Togwaggle's Scheme can happen, but Leeching Poison and Scalehide were both two mana, making them much more playable early on.
---
I don't think rank matters beyond 25
---
You don‚Äôt even need a winrate above 50. The rank floor means that all you need to do is play enough games and eventually you‚Äôll hit a lucky streak and make it to legend. 
---
Think of it like this: with a rank floor, you are effectively limited on your losses. You can have a really bad string of games but you can never be further from legend than 25 wins. If you play long enough, you‚Äôll have a set of games where you hit enough wins that the last set of games you‚Äôve played has a winrate high enough to get you to legend, even if your overall average winrate is sub 50
---
You‚Äôre not terribly bright, are you?
---
Yeah. 4 mana Rag &gt; 2 mana barnes.
---
&gt;unless they draw the nuts.

i won it on the 2nd try... but it's definitely one of the hardest brawls; you need 2 players to both play optimally

Bob redecorated his pub. I think it looks great.
---
You've finally breached the Kirin Tor Citadel, but they've increased their defenses because they know we're coming (there's the story part).  What makes this chapter special is the addition of 4 more boss fights.
---
In terms of no new bosses, I'm sure they are they, you just may not have hit them because of RNG.
---
On android, I'm having an issue where my decks keep saying they are incomplete (26/30 cards) until I go to edit the deck itself and verify that all 30 are there. Cannot play unless I do this, bug resets on log in.

Hey Paperlnight, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

Decks that pressure the opponent will be favored vs pogo. If you play a slower deck that gives them time to draw through their pogos you will lose. Force them to use removal and vanish in awkward ways.
---
As a proud pogo player, pretty much anything aggressive just destroys me. Specifically, mech hunter is a really good counter. If the pogo player goes off they can win any game, but you should win quite a bit more than you lose if you play some mech hunter
---
I don't play this game, I only know this card.
---
Could get a turn 2 OTK with this lol.
---
I mean other chapters had a theme : treasure gives coin, Sindragosa rehash, health reverted, minor things like this.

I hope the 4 extra bosses are new ones at least, i'm so tired of doing the same thing all over

i played this mode TEN BLOODY TIMES AND I GOT SHAMAN EVERY SINGLE TIME. i was so in so much agony when the priest dumps all his spells on useless minions im like whuut?? still managed to win 7 of it since i knew what the boss would do and i clutched out everytike we swapped hands
---
I'm not sure I understand the point of this post. Is it going over my head?
---
We get it reddit, Elistra + Goggles + Bells is op
---
Definitely the best pack I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôve had a fair share of golden milhouses to make up for it though.
---
Also C'thun caps out at 100 damage (per battlecry)
---
Blizzard could have easily announced that the mobile version would be released a day later and that would have solved all the problems
---
We didn't concede in this particular brawl.  I'm sure you're correct and it would result in a double loss.
---
I'm already sick of seeing the next 500 posts of ppl that see that treasure + bells = unlimited damage.
---
Only those who pay with real money get the golden pack, right?
---
Can't forget about shudderwock on release day, where the win condition was holding your opponent hostage until they conceded out of boredom.
---
Khadgar starts with 110 health, his hero power summons an elemental that casts spells for him a second time. He used Research Project and it let me fish out Alexstraza with Scepter of Summoning
---
I agree generally but folks would probably even blame that for the Old Gods meta of control warrior that quickly drew to Justicar and then tanked up out of reach of most decks. If the thing you can do with two mana every turn is better than your opponent‚Äôs, you have a built in advantage if the match exits the midgame stage
---
Ohhhhh, so I have a 10% chance to pull a golden legendary?
---
i only see a golden harrison
---
This looks like a single player run, so I could see this being over baring in a duel.
---
i won with alex the last 3 bosses lol in normal tho
---
Pretty sure only the first copy is cost reduced.. right?

too long didn't read but ya i guess i like free shit so you have my support

---
Man Vargoth is so ass. Mad curve with + spell damage starting from T1 and clearing my stealthed board into turn 6 lethal. Stealth + malganis + guldan was a walk in the park until that one.
---
the "buffing random minions by one" thing is the worst thing, just why
---
Repost
---
Maybe.
---
I didn‚Äôt get a golden pack? How do you get one
---
Nope, just got mine from only paying Gold! You just have to complete all the chapters on at least Normal.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the rate for legendaries is different in the first 9 packs, and then you are guaranteed one on your tenth. So I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say 10%, rather 100% in the first 10 packs you open.
---
I know it's not that intuitive, but if you are a shaman and get fjola lightbane, wait for the hand swap so the priest can get her. She will carry games on her own if shes on the priest's board.
---
I was lucky enough to not draw it until late in the game on the last 2 bosses, so it at least felt somewhat earned. the one before Kadghar got me down to 9 health, of course I had Nozari, so...
---
I've had Heroic Marei Loom break on me 3 times so far. Only happens in Heroic but on the second time she does her thing I don't draw a card and then on my turn I don't draw a card and then I can't do anything except concede.
---
I see it fairly frequently actually
---
Hey it‚Äôs me!
---
Bouncing blade repeats until one dies
---
Guy wastes all his best cards before Phase 3. I'm still sitting with 9 cards in my hand, trying to carry his ass. I carefully build up another minion, the one that draw a card after targeting it, and I even had a Shadowfiend to reduce them by 1. Next turn I finally drew a Divine Spirit, I was about to make it a 36/36, and could slowly kill Nefarian with it. Then my "teammate" decided to concede. Made me extremely furious, not playing anymore of this bullshit.

---
Fan of knives? Maelstrom portal? I can't think of any others and they probably shouldn't be using it that early. Also not even sure how much they are played in wild
---
Nice start. Little correction - Jepetto is not the only final boss of chapter 3. There is also Captain Hannigan and he's quite different opponent.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm so confused by this guy is he a bot or something?
---
Wrong card, that is defile, and is capped at 14, not 80.
---
Ah - 5 mana 9/9 battlecry deal 95 damage does seem good! I like it.
---
wHy CAnT yOu LeT PEoPle eNjOy thINgS?!?!

Oh right, I forgot how it works, you also need Commanding Shout, so they don't die. Though I guess it means you also don't kill any of them at the end, so it does go on forever.
---
Got [hogger in my gold pack](https://i.imgur.com/jTwrPVK.png)
---
Out of curiosity, do we know if gold packs have a separate guaranteed legendary in the first 10? I guess we would find out if somebody opened a 10th golden pack and never got a legendary from any of the 10, but I don't even know if there's been 10 released since that rule began.

Oh, that explains it, for those who doesn‚Äôt want to use it anymore. Thx
---
Well then it is the fucking US government at fault, not the people who either wont or cant affors to tip.
---
 Because the way the law there is, is that the person from the three(customer, waiter, boss of the waiter) who is most likely to already be the wealthiest (the boss of the waiter) is the one who basically gets every cent tipped to the waiter up until enough has been tipped for ifor the tips and their wage combined add up to being the minimum wage they should be getting no questions asked and then every tip should just be on top of that. 
---
The system you have now means that the employer is the one who gets all the benefits of all tips until "the waiter has bee tipped" a really fucking high amount.
---
Its the same as if the waiters would be getting payed the rightful wage by the employer but the employer would literally steal all tips meant for the waiter until they have amassed most of what they originally payed to the waiter in the first place.
---
 Wich one should be the one who gets rewarded for good waiter service? The waiter or the much more well off employer who is already making a fucking shitton more money off the backs of the waiter and their colleagues.
---
If someone tried to make any contract in anyway that had the end result of ANY tips being counted as a part of the wage or ANY part of the tips going to anyone but the person who served the person who tipped the employer would be in fucking prison for slave labour, breaking human rights, embezzling from the customers (the customers of course always intend to give the money to the one who served them, and if they are giving money to the waiter but the money actually would only end up making the employers wallet fatter, it would literally be considered full blown fraud. Even if everyone involved knew what the contract was.)
---
Everytime i think about the US of A i refresh my memory how horrific and dystopian the laws there are.

TL;DR: USA is a third world country

**Bouncing Blades but every time it bounces it goes 100% faster**
---
It's an ez win but it feels kinda cheap. That dinging also gets old after about 90 times too.
---
Bob
---
&gt;at the same time it might convert paying players to stop giving money as they are making better gold now.
---
That's a fair point. Though I do think 6 extra packs a month is unlikely to be the thing that transitions spenders to f2p, but again, I can't say for sure.
---
With existing f2p players, blizzard won't be losing anything if they stay f2p since they were never getting their money anyway. Though, I guess you could argue this makes them more likely to theoretically stick as f2p, but I think they'd specifically need an incentive to go from f2p -&gt; spender, and this change doesn't interfere with that condition.
---
Heroic Dadghar was pretty brutal. Sacked it out with a turn 3 Rin with robes into a t7 Azari but even then I felt the pressure hard. The raw amount of card generation him, Vargoth and Kalec pack makes their fights tricky even when you think you've got them topdecking.
---
I agree now that i completed the whole chapter 5. It's a good adventure.
---
But then what was the point of chapter 1,2,3 and 4 then ? The whole adventure IS the chapter 5
---
To be fair, first play thru of the brawl was a win because that totem was buffed to hell and had windfury.
---
Even if it did, would they kill the second because you still have all 4?
---
I never in my life wished I could talk to someone more. I sware 90% of my teams mates never played this brawl before or are intentionally trying to lose.
---
Get lucky and find your control tools was how to play those decks. Jade druid was a bit of head scratcher in the mirror tho
---
Ya I'd love it if they gave more gold. But 100% still staying f2p until there's real change. 
---
Iast thing I ever bought was adventures. That was fair value for the consumer and worth the 20 bucks imo. And that's exactly why blizzard got rid of it lol.
---
Thanks for trade
---
That's what i meant with the (pls don't do it with that order), so maybe people notice this before actually doing it in game.

Thank you for the perfection!

*Laughs in APM Priest*
---
Good question. It could trigger whole the time or just once when the fourth one is being summoned
---
This is one of the better times for new players to start. Recent changes make sure that new players get a lot of packs when they first start, on that climb from rank 50 to rank 25, and during that climb you're only competing against other new players. Also, we're in the first expansion after an annual rotation, which means that Standard mode only has cards in it from four expansions (plus Classic/Basic).
---
So people aren't that far ahead of you in terms of collections, and you only need one deck anyway to do well. Also, "expensive decks" doesn't mean "good decks". You can climb with cheap decks that you'll definitely have enough gold to make once you make it to Rank 25. Like the other post said, Hunter is a good starting class, as it has some strong cheap decks that are fairly straightforward to play, or you could go the Whizbang route.

Yeah I stopped purchasing the pre-orders with this set for the first time because I finally convinced myself that it wasn't necessary or worthwhile. Adventures in their previous state would still be auto-purchases from me, provided they weren't all garbage cards, but yeah, that is no more, unfortunately.

Yea
---
Zoolock is and wasn‚Äôt ever hard, holding back minions before they aoe was about as hard as it gets. 
---
Deadman‚Äôs hand warrior was just bad, mill rogue on the other hand was actually a hard deck to pilot that could be good in the right meta 
---
Jade druid was only ever hard in the mirror, everywhere else was just draw rng.
---
I second this
---
Means for each turn where you keep it in your hand it upgrades.
---
First it's 1 1/1, then it's 2 1/1, then it's 3 1/1 and so on. Obviously it's capped at 7 eventually cause that's how many minions you can have on the board. 
---
But that's how Scheme cards work.
---
Super fun combos and scenarios that you can only achieve after 6 months of grinding every day as a f2p player.

It‚Äôs a great way for new players to experience the game at its best.
