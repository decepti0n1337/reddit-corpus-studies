Yeah, people always talk about playing Hearthstone on the toilet, but whenever I go to take a screenshot I accidentally flush instead. I once tried to play APM priest and ended up with a plunger on my face.

---
I think 2 copies of Book of Specters are way more important than late game bombs vs Control since it helps you get your early Giants online more consistently. Also I wouldn't cut Firetree since it's your biggest reason to run dragons.
---

---
The deck naturally does well against Control and struggles to interact with early boards so maybe going for the full aggro tech (MCT, Ooze, the 7 mana taunt) is the best approach. If you're low on Dragon synergy consider adding another Crowd Roaster or Scorcher.

During live streams i try to entertain my viewers and listen to them. I mainly focus on creating budget and meme decks and making them as competetive as possible. I try to be unique and do not play with the same stuff all the time, like tier 1 decks.
---
&gt; It was literally over next turn
---
Because he didn't draw the AoE, you were twice as lucky.
---

---
K, i will. Tnx for the quick reply
---
That's no moon
---
I think devastator should have its mech tag taken off but that may destroy the flavor of the card. I am fine with control warrior but bomb warrior is too good for its low skill floor.
---
Hey look it’s more Priest cards that carry an expansion’s advertised mechanic that never see any play. Put them into the trash bin with the others.
---
Yeah but as soon as you switch to the class that counters the class you see a lot, you'll start seeing only counters for the class you switched to.
---
It’s not one of the top tier decks but I love heal Druid.  If you can afford to wait on lucent until you have a Floop in hand they really can’t stop the lucent train either.
---
Bonus:  everyone mulligans against token when they see me playing Druid.
---
Token is situated the best when decks can also focus on removing minions as counterplay. In the current meta, they have way too many ways to spawn wide boards that most decks have no way to handle in time for the savage roar turn. My point: token in the past felt way better to play against than now
---
I think that's more in our head than anything. I hop on ladder as rogue and I think I see Warrior literally every damn match, but in reality, my data says they're like 24 percent of my matches. That's still a lot, but 1 in 4 isn't 90 percent. Just figure out what classes are actually played the most at what ranks, play the class that counters it, and you'll do well.
---
10 damage -&gt; 8
---
Or base stat changes pls.
---
The card is too valuable for warrior that can make it to 10 mana extremely easily
---

I added you.  I'm Dolus#1746

It might not be written on its card. But some say its secretly coded inside minecrafts coding files that it always wins brawls.
---
I believe it said; Bad RNG Curse
---
I only play on mobile.  I've played maybe 5 games on PC. 
---
All these screenshots of the full art boards with the easter eggs and stuff sucks for us.
---
I'll never forget the game where I was sticking out a warrior game with token druid. He used all of his removal and was down to two cards in his deck after archivist. I still had one dryad spell and a couple +1+1 in hand so I was feeling ok about my chances. That's when he dropped the second archivist he made with the first... The salt my friends. The salt
---
Make Paladin Control Again. I’m pretty convinced Priest and Paladin we’re going to get strong control tools during RoS, but they were pulled at last minute. Priest, in particular, was probably going to get Madam Lazul as a hero card with the passive hero power on display in this week’s Tavern Brawl. It’s triggered like Hagatha’s passive, but with spells instead of minions.
---
Awesome job! Definitely great looking work.
---
What kind of meme Rogue deck are you running? Tess Rogue?
---
You are most definetly right but thats a 10 mana play, he is at turn 9 =(
---
endless Heisbaron Togwaggle
---
if you enjoy the game playing for 1 hour a day is not a grind. if you don't enjoy it playing for 10 minutes a day will be a grind.
---
I think you should have been more clear that it was not a this turn lethal.
---
Not exactly a "spot the lethal" scenario. There is no lethal this turn. Title is a bit deceptive.
---
Too much
---
This isn't usually how this meme works. One is usually objectively better than the other in every conceivable way.
---
You missed a few decks I liked, but overall I think it’s a fantastic picture of what the meta had as far as major influencers in those metas. 
---
Sure there were a few balance patches that deleted a deck or two, but for the most part it’s a great picture of the past 4-5 years.
---
The obvious thing is that 'lethal' actually means NEXT turn not this turn. /s
---
Every context, everyone says 'lethal' as in enemy is dead this turn. So no, it was not obvious since the majority of us would think 'it must be within this turn'. OP is trying to be clever by using incorrect words.
---
It has to be 3 or more unique beasts and no non-beast minions in the deck.  Fail either condition and it may not discover 3 beasts.
---
Warlock and Rogue seem to be pretty up there in my experience. Shaman if you can get enough walking fountains
---

You had me in the first half (of the title) not gonna lie

I use it as a replacement because I’d rather save my dust than spend it on Darius crowley.

This is answered on hsreplay and updated constantly.

How did mage take 2 dmg on same turn as Reno dragon?
---
ITS SIMPLE
---
I came here to say this
---
You might want to try putting in [Hobgoblin]. Much stronger than knife juggler, annd works better with carpet and your 1drops
---
That's part of it, I had a grindy conjurer mage vs warrior game and we both got to fatigue, I was up a few cards (despite his highrolling delivery drones and Omega assembly) and then Elyaiana dropped. Ugh.
---
Why?
---

---
NA trading 80g. I show you go first. Name is EchoXD#11164
---

---
Does no one realize this is a way better warpath?
---
I think if both die at the same time, it's a draw but both lose.
---
https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2019-05-09
---
The ladder itself is a very huge range. Token Druid stomps low ranks but has a very noticeable dropoff in win rates at high ranks, and I can very much vouch for this. I've hit legend multiple times and have no interest in tournaments, so each month I just play to hit rank 5 and then grind wins for gold heroes. Of my non-golds Druid is closest to 500 so I've been playing it a lot, and the struggle once I hit rank 5 this month has been nuts.
---
https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=WARRIOR&amp;archetypes=2&amp;sortBy=winrate
---
Quite literally the version with the highest winrate plays Banker. If you go down the list, out of the top 10, about 20,000 players use Banker, in decks that use either banker or panda. In the top 10, 4000 people play decks that use Panda in it.
---
Case in point? The reason people use Panda isnt because its better. It's because it's way cheaper. Panda is a common from the base set. Banker is an epic from a set that was released quite awhile back in terms of this rotation. If we're both decked out, and you play Archive and Panda, and I play Archive and Banker, you're at a huge disadvantage, both in tempo and in the fatigue war. 
---
As a famous redditor once said, it's okay to admit when you're wrong.
---
The worst thing is, now the hunter cant emote
---

But is it possible to watch that amazing run to legend with ftp? Thanks

Metas change. Unused card get used. Op cards left over like floop.

Just want to point out that you don’t need an account to review replays I believe as I don’t have one but my replays are watchable. It’s just an extra feature of HSdecktracker.
---
I haven't been lurking for more than a year or so, so you must be talking about longer ago than that.  There isn't much discussion in the comp sub either tbh, like one new post every day or less.
---
Can i haz silver pls?
---
And then there is Druid, which is semi good against all of them
---
But if you eat too much fudge you might get a pudge and then you can't budge.
---
&gt; I heard that a golden myras element pulls all your cards - but golden.....is that true??
---
No.
---
Nomi does give you Golden Greasfire Elementals though, as expected.
---
It lacks infinite armor and infinite board clears
---
I bring barnes back and I play him again
---
And why rogues have pickaxes
---
Witch King wasnt backstabbed tho.
---
r/softwaregore
---
And then after having dusted everything the deck is nerfed or become useless in a new meta and you end up having to create a new account because you have nothing left.
---
Burning all your ressources to create ONE performing deck isn't an accurate representation of the new players experience. It doesn't disproove anything regarding the P2W stuff.
---
You really want to prove the P2W argument? Create 2 new account. One with 0 money on it and one with 200$. Play both of them for 500 games and see which one has the best win rate.
---
If they have the same win rate, then spending money doesn't improve your winrate so no P2W. If the one with money has a better win rate then Money improve your chance of winning so there is a P2W element in the game.
---
PRECISION.
---
People downvoting this are probably p2w smh

r/customhearthstone

Man, remember 40?

Never ever pick warrior in arena
---
lol, wtf bro i can imagine the pandemonium on that curve. you just convinced me to draft shaman next!
---
Sometimes people spend their removal on it which is nice because Darius isn't the win condition.
---
You are reading his post in bad faith. 
---
Obviously he is not saying "money does not help" 
---
P2W is a specific state of money mattering too much in his understanding.
---
You are talking about money giving any kind of advantage. 
---
Also this is kind of an absurd comparison as every game that has the option to be free to play means you are able to grind fpr the same stuff you usually pay for, so if the grind is manageable then it is seen as "not P2w."  
---
So the time race comparison is a bit absurd.
---
Maybe Ngin from crash bandicot.

\[Blood of The Ancient One\]
---
Congrats! I have been playing since launch and finally sat down and committed enough time to hit legend (wild) so I feel ya. Still don’t have a 12-0 arena so big ups.
---
Hey whatever you say man. I had fun grinding for three months trying to hit this, so thats all that matters. 
---
I also don’t know if running other decks like odd paladin and pirate warrior would’ve helped me experience a “wholesome” victory. 
---
I played serval decks and found everyone was running control decks at 2am, so I went with the best counter deck. If you think this was a cake walk, you are ignorant.
---
Very cool! Nice job :)
---
1. How much of your collection did you dust. 
---
2. Would be awesome to see how your average winrate was slowly decreasing by climbing higher, would be an awesome curve to see as a graph.

Have a good day.

You don't have to only play one game your entire life you know.

---
Decks with win condition being basically "doing nothing except avoiding death" should not exist in the first place. Turn limit is good and you deserve wasting your time for playing warrior.
---
*sssmokaaaing*
---
Leeroy is good, but he's kind of vulnerable to taunts. Like today, a mage got really lucky with conjurer's call and summoned 3 7/8 taunts on turn 6.
---
Why are you being a dick? You haven't countered any of my points, just made a generalisation. I've actually read through a lot of comments and changed my mind, yours did nothing.
---
I find this meta incredibly frustrating, but for a complete different reason. If something the game needs way more AoE. If you like playing wide just play Rogue/Hunter, and accept that Warrior is a bad matchup. You'll b fine.
---
Having thought on it I agree, I was letting myself get tilted by going against warriors and this was causing me to misplay in games I should be winning. I won't lie I fucking hate playing against warrior but it's my problem it tilts me, cheers for the feedback.
---
Nice reading skills, but you should try using your brains maybe it will help you understand what I wanted to say, smartypants lol
---
I agree, except Token Druid is a board-based combo deck, not really aggro deck (it usually wins through Savage roar + board buffs combo around turns 8-9).
---
Is one of the best decks besides Rogue. Try to learn how to pilot it better and you should easily climb with it. Also Elyssiana will most likely to get nerfed so you'll probably get your dust back anyway.
---
It's a bad thing.
---
Well, tbf this is an unpopular opinion. The game needs more AoE.
---
he said he finds the core gameplay loop boring and you opened up with a paragraph saying that's somehow supposed to convince him of it not being boring whilst making it sound even duller than it already is
---
Yes they do, sometimes are even more vocal than control players. Also Blizzard tends to hear them more.
---
&gt;  makes me doubt your latter statement.
---
This meta is a love letter to aggro so I don't know what are you complaining about.
---
&gt;we just care about stars/hour and getting to Legend asap every month
---
Yeah I know, having fun is completely irrelevant.
---
I assume this is a completely normal play for most people here, but I only started the game a few days back, so it felt very satisfying to make the combo. 
---
If you think this is nothing ordinary and isn't interesting content, I can delete it. Had no intention to spam.

"You are able to log into your phone and your computer with your account" I can't log into my PC with any account, my friends or my own. But I can use my account to log into my phone. (sorry about being a little confusing)

I dont know about best, but the most fun i have in arena right now is Hand Buff Paladin and the one time i got Glinda Crowskin and a buttload of Lackeys as a Warlock.
---
&gt; Rhino + (Dire Frenzy+Springpaw, x2)
---
I mean, that's not really a good comparison though. that one needs you to play Dire Frenzy on your 1/1, draw two of them, then play 3 cards for 12/14, which isn't too big of an upgrade for the amount of set-up it needs in the first place.
---
Sometimes when the wife is out of town I like to queue Control Warrior hunting other Control Warriors just so I can rope them every single turn while watching Netflix and barely paying attention to the game.

I like to imagine that I am saving at least 2-3 regular players from having to face that warrior on ladder on their subway ride. I am the hero the ladder needs.
---
You’re good, Reddit is just... unpleasant at times.
---
Support your claim that fatigue is not a win condition. 
---
The hearthstone team added a card that increases deck size from 30 to 40, but did nothing with the turn limit. If someone wants to play a stall deck and gets matched against a like-minded person, they're game shouldn't be ruined by an outdated system. I had a control warrior mirror match this weekend and it was the single most interesting match I've ever had, until the turn limit ruined it for us. At the very least, they should make it so it's not a draw and instead based on remaining health/armor.
---
It’s an old combo but still a good combo
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie

Always wins Brawl.

Since it's gold, will all the cards in the deck be gold as well?

Actually almost, I am missing an Unleash the Beast, but The King Himself was my first legendary, and I thought to myself hey, it could turn out to be pretty good.

Yes, while this is all good, I don't have Zul'jin and I am yet to craft him, because I'm very protective of my dust, so I try to climb with what I already have, and what I actually open from packs. King Krush in this instance is a relatively okay finisher, and pulled a lot of wins for me.
---
To be fair it is like running a leeroy in a midrange hunter. No one expects a king krush.
---
I am pretty happy with my King, always has its moments
---
What's that have to do with anything? He didn't misplay a damn thing. Also, mobile never shows rank.

ahh this is the type of designer insight I need.
---
Yep, whatever can you do, when you have to play this game on a budget
---
Nice! I recently reinstalled HS after not playing for a while. I crafted golden whizbang on day 1 so I dont really have much incentive to craft one of the meta decks today. Im currently rank 9. The decks are decent-ish on average. Just prepare to pull your hair out when you low roll to priest a couple of times in a row lol.
---
is no one gonna comment 31/30 warlock quest?
---
said no one ever
---
EWWWW BMER!
---
Chill bro ur gonna brake the game with these moves
---
For a brief moment I had a heart-attack for not thinking of putting Leeroy into this deck when I realized that it's probably because of \*Beast tag\*
---
Ah I love the smell of salt in the morning
---
nope, not even cleared it once, its to rng to get even halfway synergestic deck for shrines. and last bosses are even more bulshit then any dungeon run or monsterhunt boss and there you where lot stronger more consitently.
---
Like warduid loti with armor refres as last boss or hooktusk with  the one that draws whenever you cast a spell and reduces its cost.
---
Ah that's a good point. I was wondering why a rank 10 opponent had an all gold deck.
---
GOLD JERRY GOLDDDDDDDDDDD
---
have you ever played a game against elysiana control warrior?
---
I totally check the competitive sub all the time. This sub is sometimes unfairly trashed for not having more competitive posts unlike the competitive sub, but that idea doesnt understand the competitive sub's existence progressively puts less discussion here where its mixed with memes and moves it towards the centralized place. So, I'm fine this sub is not like the comp sub, but I also think the more images there are the less the players try to submit discussion here. I dont think there should be intensive gameplay talks here necessarely, but more about game ideas, questions, ladder experience, fun decks, etc, and those would pop up more if people see the space for them.
---
It doesnt help most of those discussion die in downvote hell because lots of people here dont like suggestions or state of the game talk cause they seem in vain and tag people as whining, but an screenshot of the quest log easily reaches the top again and again.
---
I would like the experiment of not having screenshots cause its not like the sub was dead before them.
---
A better topdeck then Rafaams Sheme
---
Er yeah but your enjoyment is way higher is you are part of the meta discovery instead of only playing when its discovered.
---
Also no, in anything irl, theres a huge difference between the skill of a top 100 player and the no1 player. for exmaple tennis, badminton, swimming. The same people always win all the stuff when theyre in their top form.
---
Game wise dota and csgo is like this, theres a huge difference between 2000 and 100.
---
&gt; This "meta" discovery phase happens regardless - the end resulting meta doesn't change depending on whether a streamer gets early access so why limit it?
---
I'm arguing for it not to be limited. As it stands it is since they limit the discovery phase to streamers only. ( for 1  week )
---
Some serious fundies.
---

&gt;Complain about "announcements of the announcement"
---
That's one group.
---
&gt;Complain about lack of "announcements of announcements"
---
That's another group. Unless you'd like to show me exactly WHERE OP "complained about the announcements of the announcements"? I'll wait for your proof of that. :) 
---
If he didn't say that, then what I mentioned above applies: Yes, different people will have different thoughts and feelings. That doesn't mean anyone should be discouraged from expressing their opinion.
---
Why do you think it's not a problem with the core set? Shield Slam is severely undercosted as a 1 mana, kill anything spell. Even Naturalize had the supposed drawback of making your opponent draw. Brawl is a 5 mana pretty much full board clear. To compare, Flamestrike is 7 mana and does 4 damage to enemy minions...
---
LEEROYYYYYYYY JENKINS
---
Wow, thanks for the info! Incredible job you did!!
---
One day I'll give it a try, but I gotta feel the need and spend the time.
---
Hmmm okay.
---
Go face. You're probably trading too much or keeping the wrong cards (reactive instead of proactive). They have no AoE and very limited healing options, the only way they beat you is conjuring into multiple 7/8 taunts or drawing all their early minions, neither is very likely. You should kill them by turn 7 or so.
---
Circlejerking all day every day.
---
I use a deck built off the preset for Kangor's Endless Army-themed deck from the previpus rotation updated with newer cards. Nothing quite matches the magic of ROFLstomping your opponent with mechs that spawn more mechs, then come back from the dead and ROFLstomp some more.
---
Don't let your schemes be dreams, boys.
---
I'm not talking about your cite, you said "Suggesting stuff like making prep legendary, removing the battlecry of dr boom or changing completely the coin mechanic are really really bad ideas." that's the post I replied first and that's what Im calling ironic to say.
---
They don't say it's not worth it because it doesn't do its job well in the match ups you want to use it in, they say it's not worth it because the card is a "win more" card in a lot of match ups that your deck is already favored in and is actually pretty bad in match ups you're unfavored in (token druid, zoo, rogue). It's also not necessarily "easy" to see it's bad in those match ups, but it's often a dead card in your hand or a card that you have to spend 2 Mana getting rid of, something that adds up a lot in tempo match ups. Right now especially, flare being essentially a dead card against rogue, the best and most common deck in the game, is probably going to have the biggest impact on your winrate overall
---
 Tracking does the same job for half the Mana and let's you discover a card from your deck, giving you a lot more flexibility when you are trying to cycle, for instance you can cast it fairly early and pick a card that fits your hand / curve / game plan or even still have a reasonably powerful turn 3-4 when you cast it by hitting a 2 or 3 drop, where as flare doesn't give that flexibility on those turns because you don't get to decide which card you want and costs 2 Mana.
---
If you have any goals for climbing you can probably reach them with flare instead of tracking and probably a slightly lower win rate, but hopefully now you see why it's not the best card for the deck.

Check out Disguised Toast’s budget midrange hunter on YouTube. It’s cheap and quite strong.

So what your saying is go aggro? Cheap filthy aggro?

Enemy minions
---
My bad, correcting now. I meant all enemy minions lol.

I dont want to make the entire sub about serious gameplay discussion, Comp HS is a great sub but its about improving in the game and thats perfect, but it should not have talk about the state of the game, nerfs, what you like about ladder or other modes or not. This should be the sub for that, and still has it a bit but screenshots are not good presentations for discussion and have become too repetitive IMO.
---
Nexus of Fate is a so-called Buy-A-Box Promo.
---
It is only available in Foil and the foiling is making it a bit bigger than all the other cards in a deck.
---
When you start a tournament with Nexus of Fate in your deck you usually have to use proxies to replace the card.
---
Proxies are no good PR (the player is playing with a "fake" card) also it's pretty annoying.
---
To top it all of Buy-A-Box Promos are not meant for  play in competitive formats and wizards admitted they made a mistake by printing the card.
---
Why he got downvoted? I mean, he is right
---
As in, what would you possibly run that's neither fast nor favoured against Warrior?
---
They have the golden border if your entire deck is golden.
---
fuck. ive been looking for this for ages. cheers
---
My guess is the vanilla one since it didn't die with the buffs
---
Ohhh damn that makes this play even crazier then lmao
---
not ogre 0/10
---
The Velen/Malygos/Cloning Gallery big priest runs it.
---
Is that DC?
---
So why was the couple pixelated out?
---
No, they shouldn't. Naturalize had more downsides than shield slam and it got HoF'ed. Why the fuck we wouldn't want it nerfed.
---
Cloning Gallery Priest is not Big Priest.

I got that exact reminder when I was watching Detective Pikachu and they were showing commercials for Play-Doh

But he denied the charge value

I don't get the hate centered towards the dr boom hero card. I feel like people started hating only when warrior became tier 1. As far as I remember, nobody really said anything about him a couple of months after he was released (but obviously people had concerns when he was spoiled).
---
This might he an unpopular opinion, but I like having the doctor boom cards in the game currently. Control hasn't really been a thing for a while, and I like that it's back now.
---
Flamestrike doesn't wipe your side of the board. That's why it costs more.
---
Have you tried asking them on Twitter?
---
I think they took the wrong approach with hero cards. Instead of just not making them because they make the classes that get them better, why not just give each class a few different ones that fit into different archetypes so even if they’re really strong every class has a few they can use as well
---
"Your opponent is randomly generate by random people"... sounds about right.
---
I've been trying to pull this off since walk the plank was released. I haven't found a deck that does it consistently yet.
---
You say you do. You clearly don't. Not at anywhere near a high level at least.
---
'I personally would take back even/odd meta over this monotonous bullshit'
---
Wait what? Genn and Baku were literally sent to the HoF early because they created the most monotonous gameplay ever.
---
The real reason Priest sucks is that their Classic cards are weak and don't enable the class identity as a control class so they suffer the most from there being only 4 available expansions instead of 6, especially since the last expansion is traditionally the strongest.
---
To make up for their weak Classic cards their expansion cards need to be disproportionately strong, so Priests are generally weakest at 4 expansions, stronger at 5, and strongest at 6, though of course exceptions can occur.
---
4 mana 7/7 ?
---
To be fair, Rafaam is pretty much the worst card in the Zoo deck. It has a very low win rate when played. Also the way Zoolock plays if you are resorting to playing Rafaam you are typically in a bad place and still lose anyways. This is in my experience at least. The new mech zoolock is pretty fun but I feel like the deck is better in a lot of instancea without Rafaam.
---
Read the sentence after that homie🙄
---
Really really reminds me of almost the same game as DMH warrior vs infinite pally. I realised his deck and dumped my both dmhs when I discovered Mechatun. Well, I discvovered 3 during that epic match, but turns out 10/10 10 mana rush is pritty gud. He was about to inflict lethal while I was ridding out of my last shitty cards in panic and spammed well played. He had that steeded taunted immortal prelate 14/something which my brave robot targeted with all it's oldmech's might. It was before the brokeback devastator was a thing though.
---
Bad Bad: Call the fire department, this one's out of control!
---
'Most really don't care about the healing, or the taunt, or whatever.'
---
But, but, they do? Roadblock, removal, healing. That are the reasons why he is played.
---
No, thank you, had enough after that.
---
Bye bye then👋
---
Yeah shield slam requires you to have armor, something you can build up by not taking damage
---
Just go face tbh
---
JAMBO SIR!
---
Depends on your collection.
---
With the right guide you can do it without a death.

I think 4 tries are reasonable

This deck is good, but not solid. You are heavily dependant on mulligan and the early game is not strong than others in the meta. If you mulligan right, you win. Against aggro and fast decks it's a problem too. I have a score of 30-13 with it but since rank 5 have a lot of Rogues and Mecha Hunter I had to quit it.

Ah shit, we have reached the bounds of my laziness, I just picked the weirdest one and tried it.
---
I concede. Have your karma
---
You're missing draw, considering the large amount of cards you need for your combo. It seems like an auctioneer and some small spells instead of the 4 and 5 cost minions would be better, so you can actually consistently get the cards you need. Next to that I'd say the combo itself looks really bad; needing two turns, where first you're doing nothing to the board, clearly showing you opponent what you're going to do, and the turn after it's stopped by taunt. Two silences are definitely in order (which would work with auctioneer too). Maybe Grave Horror if you're casting that many spells, so you can at least prevent some face damage the turn you're setting up the combo.
---
Really? What university? Which department? Which instructor? I'd like to email them to verify.
---
Yeah it feels like Lucentbark decks are absolutely the most brutal punishments against control warrior. They can do what they want, it doesnt matter. Bombs? Hah heal. A single strong mech every few turns? Hah 6 4/8 Taunts that respawn basicaly every turn. Removal? See number 2
---
That’s not what I am saying but if rng is decideing over some wins it takes out the fun
---
whats the turn limit?
---
read comments for 5 minutes then noticed not even ranked
---
Damn, feels like the whole subreddit hates control warrior. Where did all the control players go? Please tell me I’m not alone in reveling in the fact that my favorite slow deck is finally top tier after so long. Dr Boom is just such a fun card! Certainly better than an army of waggle pick rogues...
---
I'd track the opening and start choosing from whichever's closest to getting me a legendary.
---
That being said, you should priorice the sets that are not rotating next year. That way you'll make a collection that will last longer.

I'd suggest taking the following list and replacing unleash with a nine lives:

---
How did you get so edgy? Tell us your secret.
---
RNG doesn’t decide over some wins. Maybe how you draw could have some influence over the outcome but that’s true of every card game.
---
If you watch the recent world championships you will see just how little influence RNG has on the game. The people who go the furthest are just the better players. The person who won is the person most thought would win because he’s just the best.
---
Oh no i cant do this consistently not with aggro being meta right now. But its soooo satisfying to pull off
---
Try getting to rank 5. People tend to play off-meta decks there. Moreover, these players are skilled enough to be somewhat competitive with their weird builds. Today my secret hunter was countered by a thief rogue who plays barista and earthern ring farseer.  
---
If rank 5 is not good enough for you, push for legend. Dumpster legend has a craziest array of decks I've seen in Hearthstone.
---
What? Did someone say “Don’t let your schemes be memes?”
---
I would disagree here. The Shadowverse team checks in on the meta every month or so, giving some statistics about play-rates and class dominance. If they see an issue, they tend to adjust it. If they don't (even if the players do) the don't adjust, but explain why. Its possible to maintain that level of communication, even if it is a "hey guys, numbers seem to say high-level play is balanced, so no changes this month".
---
Apparently, the idea is, they're magnetic. In slow matchups, save the 1-drops to make something big. In fast matchups, use the mechs to not die.

I won't be watching because I don't want spoilers, but I'm curious if anyone will beat Kripp/Trump, they seem to have the most deckbuilding and Arena knowledge which should come in handy.
---
especially the name " resurrection of resurrection"
---
I still haven't even beat him with mage.
---

Happened the same to me, started around mid witchwood and even with rogue being my fav class (loved miracle with striders) it feels boring to play (god I hate facing warriors), I don’t have fun with this low level of power so I also moved to wild, yeah, you might see a lot of the same decks and stuff but at least there is variety and lots of viable decks (also is more dust friendly)
---
I think that's fair.  Combo decks often use a control shell to last until they get off their combo, otherwise they use cycle.  Nomi Priest right now obviously uses cycle; this is because the Classic Priest card Northshire Cleric (and the neutral Classic cards Gadgetzan Auctioneer, Acolyte of Pain, and Wild Pyromancer in conjunction with Cleric/Acolyte) aids in cycle, plus Nomi requires cycle to get to its payoff.  But traditionally Team 5 goes with a control shell for Priest over the expansions.  Mind Blast, Resurrect Priest, and Wall Priest from last expansion utilized the same control shell: Psychic Scream, Spirit Lash, and Mass Hysteria.  They also all utilized resurrect mechanics, which can definitely be thought of as an across-game combo in the same way Shudderwock is, especially since you tend to win "all at once," which is often a hallmark of combo.  There's also the issue now that Priest, like Shaman, can never win a control battle against Warrior as long as Dr. Boom is in rotation.
---
I would just be surprised if over the next two expansions Blizzard didn't print the equivalent of a Spirit Lash and/or Psychic Scream, since strong control cards for Priest are business as usual for them and strong control cards are what is missing now compared to most times when Priest is strong.
---
For paladin you could also replace young dragonhawk with the immortal prelate. I defeated lich king with it + with the double spell that gives lifesteal and it made lich king easy. Fill deck with minion draws/buffs (that costs higher than the guy you want to buff) and spell draws/buffs. Kinda worth noting:  if he kill's your immortal prelate you mess his draws since he's going to gain those immortal prelate's based on how many times that immortal prelate has died. so if your immortal prelate has died once, he gets 1x of 1/3's, if it has died twice, there's going to be 2x 1/3's spawning to his side 3x and he gets 3x and so on and on. here is my deck, only epic ones are the immortal prelate and 1x faceless manipulator. feel free to change to better.

leeroy is still better because it does 8 damage for 7 mana versus krush's 9. You should swap it with leeroy if you have it tbh
---
Just get lucky lol.
---
So you just like to play with some extremely favorable deck.
---
This meta is way better than Odd/Even, where you already lost in the matchmaking. Even if u got a perfect draw and played perfectly every single card, you get destroyed by an even warlock or Odd paladin.
---
Hunter is Hunter, that's how it works, or you expect him to clean boards and heal?
---
Control Warrior is kinda balanced, maybe the 4/3 weapon wich adds 2 bombs is too op, but the rest is very balanced, not every time you get a good hand and if the opponent gets ahead on the board you are done.
---
Everything except for the mage and hunter is consistent. For mage and hunter, you could also do it without molten giant if you want to have less risk, but of course it'll be slower.
