Leftists being leftists.  The coming civil war cant start soon enough.
---
---
---
I get that you don't like Deathstalker Rexxar. That's fine. But it's leading you to make some *really* weird leaps of logic.
---

---
&gt; Power of the deck so high that priest came from tier 2-3 to first tier solely due to hunter dominance. 
---
Leaving aside that you're ignoring the rise of Even/Odd Paladin (to counter Hunter) that provided even better prey for Control Priest... You seem able to acknowledge that there are counters against all existing Hunter decks. They have bad matchups. If it bothers you, you can just play Odd Paladin and enjoy a favorable matchup against every version of the class. *There were no counter matchups for Huntertaker in the meta of its time*. Its **worst** matchup was the mirror. If you wanted to beat Huntertaker, your best option was to just run Huntertaker yourself with 2x Flare and an ooze. If you can't see a material difference there, I don't know what to tell you.
---
Or UI for lethal?  
---
I’m about 20 games deep and I think I use it mostly to refill after Opponent invests a lot into a clear. Psychic scream, Dragons Fury, ect...
---
I’m on the fence TBH, but I wanna play more games where I have it against control
---
2 expansions later and people still post this. 
---
Never seen the rope playing against the AI before, even with Nozdormu or the board.
---
What he said was completely true though.  Men have a much higher tendency to be at the top and bottom of the IQ range while women are more likely to have average intelligence.  Its just leftists denying science because it contradicts their narrative.
---
The announcement of the announcement has been announced.  
---
  
---
As is tradition
---
That's no fun. 
---
It isn’t bad so by that logic it is worth keeping. Most legendaries are worth keeping for the sake of them being powerful and rare and 400 dust being very small. Most people use it in combo decks. 
---
The downside of this card is that it is expensive and because it is powerful it is a priority target. So you will only get 3 mana if used at 10 mana to use him before your opponent kills it on his turn. If he can’t kill it immediately chances are you were probably already winning. 
---
I remember the early days when 400 dust was a lot and I could craft a few needed rares or that one epic to complete a decent deck. I recommend keeping it but I say it is your call.  
---
/u/hel04ra6 Blizzard &amp; Twitch has rules against this sort of sexist and hateful comments like that. 
---
YES! Paladin. 
---
If you're an asshole sure.
---

---
Thanks for your questions!  
---
I've had about 10-15 versions of this deck, constantly changing cards over about 150 played games. Initially, I started without Flametongue Totem, added it, removed it but ultimately found its value and kept it as a core card.  
---
Against aggro-vulnerable // control decks, it gives such sweet pressure with it's 3 hp, taking it out takes one whole turn for the enemy. It's true moments are when you coin out both firefly elementals on turn 1 and drop the totem on turn 2 for 6 face damage, following up with tar creeper and/or stoneshaper with a really solid board against whatever archetype the enemy plays. if drawn later in the game, it smoothens out trading and gives direct impact on the board. wouldn't wanna miss it.  
---
as for dire wolf, i just think it might die too fast to hero powers / reach / whatever - it isnt punishing enough to have to kill it. also, the +2 attack on my 3-attack-mons gives them just the right amount of damage against enemy 4-5 drops  
---
As for servant of kalimos, it's the one card i'm still having thoughts about, too. im currently switching one out for a blazecaller and it seems to work alright, but my problem is this:  
---
\- i dont have any other 5 drops, servants smoothen out my curve a decent amount of times while providing an acceptable body  
---
\- i wouldn't want to switch it for lower drops, if there's any threat to this deck, it's running out of hand because i played out my mini-mentals too early and got AoE'd. i will try out both fungalmancer and scalebane in combination with another blazecaller after this season and see how it goes. its a shame that theres no decent 5-drop elemental.   
---
all the best to you!
---
If your opponent takes 3 you lose. They are at 2 health, go face leaving you at 1. End turn - you lose
---
&gt; Taunt cards should be the anti-aggro solution
---
Most taunt minions end up being better *in aggro* than against aggro. This is because protecting your other minions tends to be better than protecting face, and taunt minions do jackshit against aggressive tempo strategies. 
---
Even something like Tar Creeper that's deliberately designed to be worse on the attack still sees plenty of play in aggressive strategies.
---
&gt; Aggo, usually, can't recover. 
---
Question: Why *should* aggro be able to easily recover? The entire point of aggro decks is to burn the opponent down fast. If you can't get the opponent close to death by the time they hit Psychic Scream, your deck has arguably failed in its main goal. 
---
Sorry dad!
---
Gods I love Discardlock. So much sodding win...
---
Discolock requires a lot of skill to pilot.
---
No amount of mana is impossible to play
---
Are we actually complaining about this. Holy hell, go for a run dude damn. 
---
Yeah, you show that AI who's boss.
---
As a priest fighting against giant hunter before the nerf to naga sea witch.  
---
I also enjoyed playing giant hunter.
---
Yes, do you have Genn Greymane? Even shaman is pretty powerful and it's really fun to play. It has gotten me back into the game when I got sick of playing too much hunter. It has a pretty flexible deck list and plays like a board control mid range.
---
Give it a try, lots of fun.
---
"Yes it works." - Rank 10
---
yes for kalimos, but u can replace with lichking.  
---
&amp;runespear just for fun :D, i can't remember cut lightning bolt or earthen might for it
---
This is peak hearthstone; a completely stupid, objectively awful, play gets massively rewarded due to sheer RNG and his opponent loses the game on turn 1. 
---
Yeah i do have gen buy the problem is i dont have kalimos and saronite( disenchanted it ).. any replacements ?
---
Needs more Emeriss
---
The problem is, value shaman is not good at all since many other classes can generate more value than it.
---
Also, right now, value decks are very weak. They get aggroed down by faster decks, or OTKed by priest/pally later in the game. And if you run a ton of anti aggro+anti combo techs, then there is little value to generate.
---
You can make your own deck, but dont expect it to be good for ladder. It can perfectly be good for casual though.
---
Draw your *first* pathetic card so I can end this, Yugi
---
That's not the correct usage of "begs the question." Your "no wait, I used it wrong..." attempt at a correction was also wrong.
---
Some people actually value their time. I mean you're really defending him roping 40 minutes in a single game?
---
*HEY IF I HAVE THE WARLOCK TOTEM AND I FACE THE PALADIN GUY WITH THE DMG TOTEM I CAN OTK HIM FIRST TURN, IM SURE NOBODY KNEW ABOUT IT BEFORE*
---
The problem here is more that they didn't have any of their other board clears by turn 9. Shadow Visions into Psychic Scream is a thing.  
---
Of course, sometimes you just get a shit draw.
---
So when you call them over, how would anyone even prove that you did or didn't shuffle?
---
They opponent could be a huge dick and say he didn't cut either, right?

At 9 mana, Psychic Scream would be useless at its most important role: Giving a slower deck breathing space. 
---
I would say the most objectionable part of Psychic Scream is that it's in the same class as Shadow Visions.

Ive never lot to control or combo priest, probably because i rush out sulphurus the second i get it and go to town.

x2 baleful bankers, with no cards in the deck. 5mana 25dmg (tho mech'thun is better win condition in this case)

but bliz is trying to transition towards mobile, IDK why they don't at least perfect it
---
Jeeez I just faced a deck that played 6 obsidian statues. Not gonnplay for  a while after that lmao
---
Wild is a format using all the cards in the game.
---
Velen is good even there. 
---
It’s impossible to perfectly balance a card game. 
---
The memes bro, the memes.
---
also, putting him in a deck with pirates is basically a 29 deck card with a 1/30 chance of being 30 cards
---
I’ll take things you can do with the coin for 500, Alex.
---
&gt; but then it just ends up being frustrating as hell to play against.
---
I feel this is less a result of broken cards and more just the basic class concept. Priest is supposed to be a reactive control class. That means powerful removal/AOEs, which many players find frustrating to play against. 
---
It's kinda like White/Blue control in Magic the Gathering. You can't make White/Blue control good without it being frustrating for the people who don't like playing against White/Blue control.

Just because he was quoting a scientific study does not prevent him (or the study) from being sexist.  Science is not culturally aloof.
---
That said, you have to ask if it's worth banning him for it.  Clearly at least one person thought so, though to me the remarks seemed benign albeit controversial.
---
Casual games, cuts are fine just for the sake of time. If money is on the line, a shuffle while using their shuffle of choice is the way to go.
---
And he still sees play? Losing Charge is a ridiculously large nerf to any card of course, but that isn't what made Patches good.

"0 mana Novice Engineer"

Yea the reward for the quest is actually pretty mediocre. 
---
Man i've played arena enough now so I dont need it, but i found that overwolf whether it be dota or hearthstone absolutely shreds my cpu memory
---
I didn't have lethal this turn. this screenshot is of the board I made after my play on turn 7 (cube the 5/5 thingy prep vial). he conceded after. 
---
It's also a large boost to Lana'thel, assuming the Solarium doesn't draw her.
---
What happened during Shamanstone?
---
we like ike
---
There’s also that 6/6 that returns 3 cards you discarded.  Of course soularium could pull both of them and your DK Gul’dan.  That’s when you go for the turn 2 concede.
---
OTK wise the closest is probably going to be using the Boomship on Grommash and 2 Charged Devilsaurs. Aggro wise the best you can do is use the best of the early game rush package and combine it with the classic cards that were used in pirate warrior. 
---
The issue however is that rival aggro decks have enough board resilience that aggro warrior doesn't have enough going for them. When the 2019 rotation comes though you can expect quite a few good wins with this synergistic aggro deck against the unrefined and experimental control decks. 
---
Also with baiting out removals. Gotta keep the pressure up on the board to force the early, cheap removals that a lot of decks run now before overcomitting to the buffs. I’d assume people struggling with the deck get their first big board and start using the buff cards too soon and suddenly lose it all on turn 6-8, and subsequently run out of gas. 
---
I mean, a lay person is free to disagree with another lay person's interpretation of scientific research.  You say the theory is well-established, others say that it is not generally held as credible in expert circles.  It isn't religious dogmatism to dispute the theory even if it were widespread; skepticism is the soul of science.
---
However, we can be confident that the ban had nothing to do with the science, but was purely driven by the controversy.  The fact that Tarkam was apparently referring to a scientific theory has no relation to the ban.

KrippEU on my friends list and he was online 8 months ago.

I think it is morally better to be incapable of harm than to be capable of harm, and decide to harm.  If I could choose between the two, I would choose to be incapable of harm.  So, I think it is morally better to be incapable of causing mass extinction, than to be capable of causing mass extinction and to do so.  It's not as if humans accidentally discovered the means of driving species to extinction; they were developed and deployed deliberately, though not with the aim of extinction.
---
I don't believe humans are composed differently today than they were hundreds or thousands of years ago, so moral differences would come down to culture.  And trying to average a moral compass across the entirety of human activity at any point in time seems like a fool's errand when most of that activity is unknown.  Most of human activity in antiquity is unknown, and most of human activity today is unknown.  Lots of good and bad things going on.  
---
I don't see how a reasonable conclusion can be drawn one way or the other.  It seems like the kind of thing where you would have a belief going in, and then look for support for that belief.  At that point, you need to evaluate the belief itself, not the evidence; the evidence is practically useless, although interesting.
---
&gt;vague and frivolous reasons like whether they are "harmful"
---
I'm sorry, but the concept of harm is not vague or frivolous.  It is important to think about whether your actions (or others') cause harm.  Other than that, I don't have much comment on the rest.
---
No, he does not.
---
The angry messages are a consequence of the lack of in-game chat.  People need some way of getting it out of their system, so they use the """Friend Request""" for that.  If you could chat with your opponent in-game, the comments might be more frequent but they would also be much easier to ignore, simply by right-clicking and Squelching.

---
I do enjoy "midrange" hunter to an extent, but surviving until turn 10 and stabilizing against a full aggro face is the place deck, then having to fight until fatigue and maybe lose because for some reason one card is all that it takes to make it "midrange" can be pretty tilting.
---
Among top meta decks, even paladin is really the one with the biggest claim to a fair, minion interaction deck. You know what they have in their deck, whatever they have in their hand came from their deck, and the most dangerous part about them is that they can play strong minions the turn these strong minions were balanced around being played at. When an even paladin gets lucky, they are drawing well, not getting exactly what they needed from fifty rng effects.
---
Dungeon run is the whole reason I got into hearthstone. 
---
TBH Dungeon run was one of the reasons I started playing hearthstone too.
---
you either use it to bring out big monsters/spells for cheap
---
for big monsters you either go full giant+shirvallah or dragonhatcher + dragons

for big spells you usually do call to arms, dinosize, etc.

How to spend my gold, Packs or Arena? (or other?)
---
I have played the Arena 3 times and every time I got a Pack and \~50 gold. Is this a efficient use of my gold?
---
what the luck
---
Which means that you had to get through your whole deck, I would say that it's okay then, but not okay to deal 18 damage from hand with Leeory double Shadowstep for 8 mana - on turn 8 without setup. That is what the quote is referring to.
---
...ok, gotta ask, why two-of dozing marksman? I don’t see the connection.
---
No Rogue either
---
Just because a card doesn't find an application right away doesn't mean it's inherently bad.

I mean look at Umbra, Hadronox, Togwaggle, Grumble, Gallery.

[[Houndmaster Shaw]] exists, and works partly cause you can drop it on turn 4 as a 3/6 taunt.  At 2/3 you can't really use Warsong that way; it honestly probably would still be kinda weak (but at least it would be useable).

It's not that humans shouldn't develop any technology, but that humans shouldn't develop and knowingly use technology with harms greater than its benefits.  There is a lot of technology which is not ruled out by that maxim.  But I think that any technology which results in the extinction of humanity would outweigh the benefits of that technology.  Don't you?
---
&gt;I'd say it's easy to know enough to make a sound and probable judgement.
---
To me it is very surprising that you think this, because I know of my own extreme ignorance in this matter, but I don't think that I am more ignorant than average.  That's why I spoke up.  I know what *I* know about civilization, and I know that it's pathetically inadequate to answer the question of civilization-level general moral progress.  That's why I said that you should discuss the belief itself--is it better to believe in moral progress, or not?  That seems like a more approachable question, one more likely to yield useful results.
---
&gt;I already explained how.
---
You really haven't explained very much.  I've detailed some of the more major moral failings of today's civilization in my opinion, and you have given input on those, but you haven't brought up any of the progress.  You mention evidence, but, what evidence?  What do you find compelling enough to say "yes, I think this is a sign that we have made moral progress"?
---
CLyDeStRiFe#1782 NA 80g trade. reply here before adding me thanks.

The mad bomber synergy.

you worked hard for it and deserved it. congrats. perhaps pay some attention in class now lol
---
Best one imo is the vs data reaper report by vicious syndicate
---
&gt; But I think that any technology which results in the extinction of humanity would outweigh the benefits of that technology. Don't you?
---
That's begging the question, bigtime. For the very simple reason that there may not be even a single piece of technology that could do something like that *if simply limited enough.*
---
Which is a major reason why I mentioned population before. Because it's not necessarily what's being produced, but the scale of its production.
---
And with that said, it's the scale of production of *lots* of different things, and you're eerily sure of yourself passing commentary on this kind of thing for someone who thinks there's too little information to judge the general moral compass of humanity over millennia.
---
&gt; because I know of my own extreme ignorance in this matter, but I don't think that I am more ignorant than average.
---
What does the average matter, here?
---
&gt; I know what I know about civilization, and I know that it's pathetically inadequate to answer the question of civilization-level general moral progress.
---
And because you believe that your knowledge is "pathetically inadequate," it must mean mine is as well?
---
No.
---
&gt; That's why I said that you should discuss the belief itself--is it better to believe in moral progress, or not? 
---
You didn't say this at all. I don't even know where you came close to *implying* this in your previous comments.
---
&gt; You really haven't explained very much. I've detailed some of the more major moral failings of today's civilization in my opinion,
---
In what I have already identified as irrelevant comparisons.
---
&gt; and you have given input on those, but you haven't brought up any of the progress. 
---
You seriously need examples? Let's just go for equality in general. Slavery, women's and minorities' rights.
---
On that alone "modern" humanity gets a ridiculous edge, even if it's still rife with a ludicrous amount of flaws. And yes, it goes without saying that those things are not completely abolished or out of the way. And yet the influence and moral high horsing regarding these things is actually present, accepted, and *acknowledged* in a proportion of the world unprecedented.
---
You can talk about Genghis Khan's meritocracy or Sparta's mentee-mentor sexual relationships if you'd like, but this hardly changes the fact that the Mongols were warmongering conquerors and Sparta had its own slew of problems with slavery, killing messengers (actually a big deal, especially at the time), and inequality.
---
Nevermind how easy it is for many people to interpret the world as in dire straits and truly "messed up," thanks to the simple mass dissemination of information (AKA news outlets). People hear (or see, such as through /r/wtf or LiveLeak) of messed up things, including the morally disgusting. But the fact is they actually register it as such.
---
Contrast that to rape being normal in the Stone Age, beating of slaves being normal for as long as slaves have existed, and heart-carving rituals in the Aztec Empire. Were the West much better when they came to New America? Even if they were, how do they compare to the West of today?
---
The fact is we are two "average" people having a conversation on a game's subreddit about the development of humanity.
---
You tell me how much you think people ever cared to consider such a thing in the past. Whether they had the luxury or the care to.
---
Because that's what it boils down to. People have able to think and teach progressively better things. And this is why *any* societal movement takes quite a lot of time. Some people need time to die, others need time to change their mind, and others need time to be taught.
---
Does everyone get included in that? No, they do not. Which is why lots of "anachronistic" beliefs like white supremacy and general sexism or homophobia are existent, but similarly regarded as that: anachronistic (and often regarded much worse).
---
It's gotten to such a point where people have gone so heavy on the moral high horse that they're *actively fucking things up.* Like people who in the name of equality preach against males, whites, or straight people, or advocate for literally discriminatory practices on account of being "positive discrimination."
---
Though, I suppose you can say that that's not necessarily new. How many wars have used religion as a recruitment tool (like the Hundred Years' War?) to "fight for justice" or "fight for God" only to be... you know, a *war* with murder, raping, and pillaging?
---
Still, I'd take being talked down to by some self-righteous douchebag over a lot of what history had to offer.
---
The trend is that as time has progressed, humans have become more aware of their shortcomings, have become more adept at teaching and taking care of their young (and old), and have become more willing to speak and fight for equality. There are still *gaping* flaws in humanity, especially as you focus in on specific areas, but those flaws have been increasingly acknowledged and tackled.
---
If he played Uther he'd be dead though....
---
No chance they’d bring back an old hero as a preorder bonus for a new set.
---
Sry aswell:)
---
I don’t know about you , but if you wanna play standard, there is no real reason keeping cards from older sets. ( Although some ppl always whine about having Sylvannas or some of the core Legendarys back) .
---
Also the wild format doesn’t get a lot of attention/promoting from Blizzard. This month is the first or second time they did some Tournament for guys who reach top 100. 
---
So basically you can dust them, no signs from Blizzard to rotate anything back into standard. 
---
Like I wrote, Ungoro, KoFT, and Cobolds and Katacombs will rotate away in early/mid April. So think twice about crafting cards from those sets. I’m sure you find some cheap lists on hearthpwn or HSreplay.
---
Gl on Ladder:) 
---
Nice work! See if you can hit it again next month?
---
The rare spell hunter match up that everybody in the hearthstone community loves 🙄...
---
“Net decks” are more popular in online CCGs because it’s so much easier to play a large amount of games at home, and track statistics on why some cards are bad or don’t work together. The example you gave of a 55% WR is just an average of good and bad players piloting the same deck; good players often get to legend with higher than a 55% WR, and professional players even higher when they play a tier 1 deck. Maybe you should pay for some coaching, or play co-op ladder with some good players. It’ll change how you think about the game.

Thanks! gonna try my best nxt reset 
---
Thanks! 
---
Unless people voice their opinion on stuff like this we won't get nothing but a couple of dungeon run clones in the near future.
---
It's sad how many features the software deck tracker added years ago while the official game got no quality of life improvements in any way since they added deck codes. Heck I would be glad if we would get a reasonable number of deckslots so I could experiment a little and have decks for wild and standard and not delete a few decks each day.
---
Which means that your Warsong survived and you used Flanking Strike on the Servant?  Maximum Warsong Value!!
---
12 mana tho
---
Ah, I didn't know that, thanks for the explanation!
---
NO ONE EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION.OR CHIEF WEAPONS ARE FEAR, CORPSE, AND MEGAJURRHAXUS
---
Playing the nuts is easy for every deck in the history of HS. Not sure what 'these days' is for if you're just going to assume perfect draw.
---
Balance the problematic hero powers. Odd paladin spreads too much. Odd warrior gains too much health. So make it a 2/2. Let em gain 3 armor. Rogue is the only one you cant balance that way.
---
Someone explain? 
---
Mill#21195 NA, trade 80g quest, will show but you go first. Have history of trades on this sub
---
It’s unprecedented, first off. And secondly, every pre order hero has been set-specific. Mecha-Jaraxxas for boomsday, Rastakhan for RR. And lastly, there’d definitely be serious backlash from the community if Blizzard recycled a hero in this way.  The expectation for new hero’s is just that - new. They won’t do it. If they ever do you can link back to this post and call me out, but it won’t happen. 
---
1 mana 6/6 draw a card, if its a minion give it +2+2
---
Seems good.
---
Did you win? 
---
So there are 4 archetypes that work ? Good deck diversity, this game sounds nice !
---
Marin
---
You can get a code for Khadgar on eBay, but it ain’t cheap.
---
The totally stoppable soularium!
---
Git probe and bauble are both cards that cycle, and people just call it dressing through your deck as you self-mill.
---
The reason the distinction matters is A. Cycling tells you about the cards a deck plays - a "cycle heavy deck" like Combo Paladin plays a lot of cards with the text "draw a card" like Novice Engineer.
---
Furthermore, Deck Thinning is important to keep distinct because when it comes to fetchlands the statistical effect isn't particularly meaningful. People who don't understand this often try to praise the "deck thinning effects", revealing that they don't understand that the life cost and shuffle effect are more important considerations
---
He isn't running quest at all though.
---
Oakheart can help you thin out the deck of potentially unwanted topdecks, and it can summon basilisk as example. It's very strong, you basically summon for 9 mana stuff probably about 15+ mana average.
---
&gt;Discolock is better with quest
---
lol no it's not. Dead card at the start, too slow for aggro, not enough value vs control.
---
I misswrote, it’s better without quest. That makes the rest of my comment make more sense.
---
Because they want tyrande? And some would pay for her?
---
And since when does Blizzard care about backlash? They only communicate when a new set is about to release. When did we get the last information from the HS Team? Right. Before the set release.
---
Btw the Idea of selling an full price game full of mtx is also beyond stupid - but AcViBlizz did this with BOIIII. 
---
It's cool that you still believe in them but never say never. And I doubt they would miss this opportunity.

Could have survived the board with trades and +4 heal +2 armor + play rush minion. Depending on the buffs it might even set up lethal just as much. Tricky situation.
---
Heh, sorry, am also a Magic player. What's the Hearthstone term?
---
Sniping is using a stream to queue into somebody. Ghosting is using a stream to get information that wouldn't otherwise be available e.g. what they have in their hand.
---
People often snipe streamers in order to ghost them, leading to the confusion between the two terms. Also stream sniping is appealingly alliterative so ignorant interlocutors incorrectly use the term in preference to the proper phrase.
---
Just use a resource like HSReplay.net or hearthpwn.com, both will let you upload your collection and show you the decks you're closest to making. I prefer HSR myself as it actually gives you data on thousands (maybe tens of thousands) of decks with hard numbers on how the deck performs.
---
I remember that. Just forgot it was Lifecoach he played against. 
---
Man, Amaz was such a good Hearthstone ( standard) player... 
---
Not quite Dead Man's Hand Mirror Match slow, but up there! :D
---
I have to admit.. incredible detective work.
---
How is it "Battlecry: Draw a card"? Surely the Start of Game part covers you getting it without it costing a card? Granted, I may be being a bit slow on my end.
---
As a fellow F2P natural vegan bodybuilder who's also a beta stephfather of 3 kids, you have my gratitude.
---
You're playing a deck which is used by bots at rank 15. Hell you probably cant even reach the low ranks, you're actually an embarrassment for humanity.
---
Oh i forgot about that.Those matches usually ended with 90 turns being passed and draw,right?
---
Thanks for the tip - Since what I wrote was already getting pretty damn long, I omitted a paragraph about going to hearthpwn and checking out several of the top rated decks there.... long story short the closest was a priest deck but it still calls for the anduin death knight that I didn't open back during KFT, as well as a newer legendary and 4 missing epics... this was the closest I found, though I didn't use the automated tool.
---
Do you have a link to this? I must have missed it.
---
surely it would be random like the shudderwock battlecries?
---
I don't think we disagree. I'd just emphasise that winning, for some—and I include myself in this group—, is not enough. It may not even be the most weighted factor in the "fun equation", however one would go around formulating that. At the end of the day, you want to win *in your own terms*—Treachery Control Warlock being quite the nasty choice at that. :-)
---
Stop making fun of your own name
---
But you actually didn’t want to draw it at the start of the game? That would make it that much worse.
---
It's zoo lock with some discard synergy
---
Wow you seem pretty pissed about me for playing secret hunter.What decks are you playing to call me "an embarassment for humanity".I mean playing net decks is allowed
---
There is no term. Untap is specifically the action in magic at the start of a player's turn where they untap anything that can be untapped.
---
In hearthstone, you have no mana to tap to play cards. Attacking monsters do not tap as the attackers dictate targets (no input from opponent on blockers).
---
The phase itself has no hearthstone equivalent. In this case, it's just leaving Malygos alive until your opponent's turn.
---
It's POWER INCARNATE then.
---
Might I suggest the term "**Priority Target**".
---
I see no problem here. Still the best way to kill time while waiting on the bus to work.
---
Now for your next achievement: Charge your phone!
---
Just kidding, grats on legend!
---
&gt; I think one of the missions required ranked games, but they threw in an un-lockable priest portrait too 
---
 
---
Hold up, am I misunderstanding this or are you saying one of the returning player rewards is a freaking Tyrande hero portrait ? o.0
---
Well, you don’t have to play out the whole game vs control decks. By a certain point you can tell you’re most likely not gonna win and it’s not worth the extra 15 minutes. You may not like playing long games, but a lot of people do. Just like what I think is most unfun in HS is dying on t4/5. The trade off of being seemingly invincible vs aggro is that there are certain decks that warrior literally cannot win against unless crazy rng or if the opponent throws. 
---
&gt; but they threw in an un-lockable priest portrait too
---
Wait, what? Tyrande?
---
So many people I like, not sure who to root for.
---
If any of Allie, Kibler, Boar, Firebat, Dog, Kolento, Trump, Zalae wins, I'll be happy!
---
But then again, who would attack with that minion into a hunter secret :thinking:
---
Ah, yes I remember this drama. He wasn't called "Ghosty" for nothing after this.
---
Thanks for the daily post about this.
---
I agree with most of what you've said but I do see "Pseudo Taunt" being used as the term for this quite often in the community.
---
Fixed, thanks!

Nerub#2134 EU Trading Friend Q
---
only 90's know
---
[deleted]
---
I crafted Whizbang and use it for fun. I’m a rank 25 scrub who doesn’t try to climb. It at the least allows you to experience the 18 different class decks. The dragonhawk mage deck is definitely fun and feels very OP and dirty at rank 25. 
---
It does suck that it will go away in another year, I truly hope they put it in classic. But that’s another discussion
---
Some more off the top of my head that people often use, no particular order here. 
---
Lethal - pretty self explanatory but, play that ends the game. 
---
Line, or Line of play, is the particular strategy used on a turn. Often there are several lines of play available. 
---
BM - bad manners, e.g. excessive emoting, excessive roping, overkilling or dragging out a lethal, etc.
---
Pilot - the player 
---
Trading - minion to minion combat, resulting in the removal of all minions involved 
---
Face - the opponents hero/life total 
---
Smorc or smorcing - attacking the opponents face 
---
Topdeck - the most recently drawn card
---
Fatigue - damage taken on the draw when no cards are left in the deck 
---
Can someone explain the patches card to me, I’m too young to understand
---
Oakheart, 100%. Especially with stoneskin already
---
It was for a limited time yes. 
---
[I did it better]()https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7t9uuw/blizzard_finally_increased_the_size_of_the_reward/

Yeah I'm just saying that it's just muscle memory to smash that button on T2. His nervous system was probably already executing that action before his brain registered that he drew gul'dan.
---
Don't suppose there's a deck list?  I couldn't find it anywhere.

I thought the pity timer was revised to 20 at some point? This 10 from a new expansion might be new since I left, and In the first volley of packs I have received a priest card called Thekal (convert health to armor) and somehow got a Hunter one called Gonk, though I can't recall if I opened both.
---
&gt;Oh I absolutely don't think the game is good for new players. It is an aspect of the game that still needs a ton of work. But my point still stands about your problem. 1.5 years is a lot of time for this kind of game.
---
We might have to agree to disagree on this point. I'm coming at it from the point of view of 'wow this is kinda unpleasant even for a player that has almost the entire base set and two of the current expansions, I can't imagine how awful this is for a new player', while you seem quite open to having the new player experience be 'spicy'. Let me throw down a gauntlet.
---
I challenge you to write your own new player experience review:
---
 - Start a new Hearthstone account and level a single class up to the point where it can play ranked etc.
---
 - Do your dailies for a week after this hero is unlocked, without re-rolling them.
---
 - Keep a diary of your win rate.
---
Keep in mind that even this will still be an 'easier' experience than a real new player would have since you have the benefit of knowing the game inside out already, but it might be an interesting test. Do you have the will (and the time) to accept the challenge?
---
Goes 0-3 because Druid.
---
That I realise, but surely the "Start of Game: Draw this card" was your way of generating it as a free draw? Unless you meant "Always starts in your starting hand" a la quests, rather than added as an additional card. As it stands this card isn't just free, but generates card advantage with effectively two draws.
---
I feel like warlock upgraded hero power is one of the worst and almost all of the good warlock cards for such a deck are even.
---
I remember seeing some presentation a few years ago by a past hearthstone developer and why the ai is such shit. Since most vs ai games in other mediums can perform the calculations client side they can make them more advanced. But with hearthstone since everything is online even the single player stuff and has to be sent to the server and sent back they purposely worked to make the ai tax the servers as low as possible. 
---
They know its shit ai but its a purposeful design choice.
---
He double posted it by mistake
---
That's BS. There have been several competitive decks over the last few metas that have been really cheap like Odd Paladin, Odd Rogue, Zoolock, Tempo Mage, Midrange Hunter, etc.
---
The link to dogs channel is incorrect. It should be dogdog not hsdogdog
---
Unfortunately, the deck recipes available in the game are neither cheap nor competitive.
---
As others have mentioned, there are several fansites where you can find competitive decks (HSReplay, HStopdecks, Hearthpwn), but finding budget decks is extremely difficult. There are very few people building budget decks, and as you experienced, full-strength meta decks are all over the place on non-newbie ranks.
---
That said, you can succeed in the game with budget decks too, and they are possible to build for most classes - Baku the Mooneater and Genn Greymany, in particular, can carry entire decks as the only Legendary/Epic cards in their respective decks.
---
Here is a playlist of budget decks I've built or tested recently, I hope it gives you some ideas of your options: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAjYYYC68Q-nPaAOi17fhyrbocc_O3zTD
---
HSreplay is far better for a budget player.  Hearthpwn tends to be more of a creative theorycrafting site, hsreplay soulless data crunching.  And the latter is better for finding the most effective way of using your dust :)
---
Caliphate #11744 NA looking to trade quest
---
Why are you still playing Dungeon Run when there aren’t any rewards? /s
---
Fixed!
---
I believe that you are thinking of "charge" vs "rush".
---
If patches had the charge nerfed to rush, it would have seen the exact same amount of play.  The 1 face damage didn't matter.
---
But the trading damage?  That was huge.  And sometimes it was more than 1 damage due to buffs (Southsea Captain, Mark of the Lotus, etc).
---
Regarding arena, I just never found much enjoyment in that mode of play. I used to like watching streamers like Kripp playing arena but just never got in to it. It seems like going eternal in arena requires players who are pretty damn good.
---
Regarding shredding old cards to craft a new deck, here's what I wrote to another who suggested that, explaining that it's due to 'feelings' around my card 'collection': 
---
&gt;As long as wild is a thing I can't bring myself to smash old cards. This is allegedly a 'collectible' card game, and for whatever psychological reason I value the old cards too much to destroy them - yes even to the extent of not playing rather than smashing them. This is on me, but smashing them to keep up seems like burning the furniture to keep warm.
---
Well played :)
---
Thanks for the link, I will look in to this. Perhaps in combination with retreating in to the solo content for ~2 months I can earn up a few of these.
---
Preparation
---
Great answer. 
---
Do you feel that there should ever be a "constant" deck option available for a class in standard? For example, in Magic the Gathering, mono-Red aggro (which plays most similarly to face Hunter) always gets some support each year. Its power level can fluctuate, but mono-Red is always part of standard. 
---
The upside of this approach is that people who like mono-Red aggro always have a viable option, while the downside is that it can get stale always having the same deck in standard.
---
Thanks for the work you put into this! Nice and readable thread.
---
The point is playing that deck at rank 15...
---
What’s the reward??
---
pati*
---
i suffered.
---
Nice dog...let me guess, it's a rescue?
---
&gt;Your post surely is discouraging, but I don't think your approach is right. Instead of moving to Wild, why don't you turn the opposite way and disenchant however many Wild cards you need to craft new cards?
---
This is a terrible value proposition. In the long run and currently, Wild is the least expensive ladder format in the game. I would never recommend someone cannibalize their collection for some quick dust.
---
How is it not
---
Not a single legendary 16.99 Well spent kappa
---
Playing omega first could still give a decent chance for a taunt too.
---
That plus the spread of more minions would help a lot with the RNG lethal of the kobold.
---
nice
---
of course there is the possibility that there is another update coming after this. If not its pretty disappointing.
---
29 card decks + 5 mana Sylvanas. 
---
Command from my /r/wildhearthstone post by u/mapacheloco89:
---
&gt; More consistant cheating out demons with 2 void callers, and more removal. 
---
Last year we got wildfest, this year its basically nothing.
---
My thoughts too.. If all I have to do is stop playing HS for a year and get her I may do it. It will probably be faster than waiting until Blizz decides to rerelease her.
---
before the card's English name was revealed, Fluffy Potion Drinker was the placeholder name used in this sub.
---
&gt;Look up the difference between positive and normative statements. 
---
The example you gave would never be accepted in the scientific community as it is not scientific. Also, please work on your wording. 
---
You don't have to hard mulligan your one drops keep them unless you have 3 of them. I would ditch Dire Frenzy for another Rhino(or a Highmane for the Rhino).
---
Against Warlock play around defile all the time you don't have your Hyena up and keep in mind of infernal flames from turn 4.
---
We don't like psychic scream so around turn 6 you don't want to overcomit against priest. Mass Hysteria is stronger against similar attack and health minions and against even number of minions on board, keep that in mind.
---
Against Paladin keep your minions at 3 health. At turn 6 he clears with equality-consacrate
---
If odd paly you win by surviving not smorcing most of the time, fight for the board dominance
---
I usually always use DK on 8 even if the board if empty, unless the oponent is under 10 life. You dk on 6 vs agro or hard control matchups.
---
Don't be afraid to use kill command to fight the board against aggro or midrange
---
And don't save your rhino so much, put it down turn 5 on an empty board and your opponent HAS to deal with it. You don't have to wait for THE perfect oportunity to play a card, you can force the oportunity
---
Huh, it's interesting for sure. I play Renolock in Wild, so, I guess I'll have to try this one now too. 
---
In casual REL, cutting is the norm. 
---
At competitive/pro REL, shuffling when you're presented a deck is the norm, especially if they just searched through most of it with a fetchland or something. You can't contest if your opponent decides to shuffle unless they damage your cards (since now you have marked cards).
---
Going to time is a huge threat in competitive, especially in control mirrors. Just watching reid duke pilot legacy  control, he [asks for time](https://youtu.be/0A3n83EHjog?t=2456) again and they play noticeably faster game two anticipating game three.
---
Is this bundle supposed to be good?
---
Nice try Brode.
---
They tend to announce balance changes ya know.
---
Kind of stupid on your part to get excited over what it very likely wasn't to be, ain't it?
---
Yes they can reroll but every redraft counts as a 0 win run
---
Goldens? Epics? Legendaries are great, but you're not gonna get them all that often, so judging every pack opening by them is just guaranteeing some degree of disappointment.
---
Everyone recently celebrated how cool it was that Trump made up his own deck nobody had really done before and took it to legend.
---
It has 9 legendaries in it.
---
These are the opponents you play when you're stuck at rank 15.
---
"My thanks to you."
---
F is for the way you find me spells
---
R is for the ribbits (and the smells)
---
O - *my Krakatoa!* You're the only loa!
---
G is good goddamn why'd the AI Vanish you man
---
Say that's a pretty good deck
---
&gt;priest card called Thekal
---
That's a Paladin card
---
&gt;a Hunter one called Gonk
---
That's a Druid card
---
lol
---
But yeah, I think team5 has made an effort over the last year to increase the power of cards in higher rarities, making them more important for deckbuilding.  Epic rarity used to be the meme rarity, now it's the meme rarity but also the 'crucial part of any deck in that class' or the 'general purpose tech card' rarity, see things like Branching Paths or Town Crier or Mossy Horror.
---
But that implies not playing a beautiful 48-48 Deathwing!
---
Shit I played this when I started playing(kobolts and katacombs)
---
&gt;while an asymmetric Board Wipe affects only the opponent’s side of the board

[[Ticking Abomination]] is also an asymetrical (potentially incomplete) board wipe but affects only your own. But I'm nit-picking

---
8 Mana 14/14 Divine Shield and Taunt. I'd have a massive boner if that occurs during this run.
---
I would get 120 classic and 60 of each set. As a vet who preorders everytime, with 60 you have almost all the cards and enough dust to craft 1-2 legendaries or some epics you didn't get but need for a deck. Classic set is the most important, it has many legendaries and epics which are used consistantly for more than 4 years now.
---
You didn't answer my question.  Obviously the hypothetical study I came up with is exaggerated.
---
Yeah haha It was pretty disgusting.

Cubelock epitomises warlock to me. Large hands, life steal, self damage, cards that discard, killing your own minions, big demons, good boardclears.

---
Fair point. Asymmetric should explicitly be defined as affecting only one side of the board. Almost always that is your opponent's side though.
---
My first craft was spirit wolves for shaman.. it felt unbeatable everytime it was played against me.. i was like i gotta have that card
---
I love how Hearthstone events are just devs trying to get more of your money (and one card, yay).
---
I think you entirely missed the point of my post, but ok.
---
Well, the dust + gold quests were nice when they did those last, so that's something, at least.
---
I mean last year we got wildfest and balance changes in february, the meta was fresh again. I thought they are going to nerf some things again so the meta isnt too boring and settled in the last 2-3 months. 
---
You have the entire rest of the game to use Siphon Life but only one chance to get the weapon.
---
What if one turn you need the extra damage for removal?
---
Because that's not the main thing to pay attention to. Just as you wouldn't say "you don't lay attention if you didn't see what game board they were playing on." The main point is what cards were played.
---
Wow that’s like more than i make in a year!
---
It’s hard to pilot but if you used to use old mill Druid (before the latest expansion) then it shouldn’t be any problem.

It was my 4th run and my furst to pass the third boss smh i made it to the last boss using fire shrine and had him at 3hp my board was filled with heroic power cards and then that mother fucker played Shadderwock and it was my very first time to see that card. Just imagine setting there watching your board turn into ashes while his board filling up with minions and him gaining 20+ armor. To this day i still get nightmares from that card...
---
Only 15 damage and his 8/8 doesn’t even die...

Plus it's not like the dust value drops after they rotate out or anything.
---
t1 coin innervate yeti :(
---
&gt; The guy who appears in the main video (our left side) is Hosty, right? 
---
Yes.
---
&gt; So when he was watching the stream he had already finished playing against Lifecoach? Or was he basically watching what had happened 10 minutes ago?
---
My assumption is the problem was he was watching the 'live' (10 minute delay) stream during the game. 
---
&gt; So with this ghosting, he basically got to see his starting hand and the cards he drew 10 minutes ago? Is that the issue?
---
Yes. Even with a 10 minute delay, he is getting information he should not have. Regardless of intent, he should not be doing it.
---
Paper magic 4life
---
2 years ago, alternate heroes for golden classes didn't have a golden outline for their hero power. That is what  i meant
---
Yeah, he didn't have an answer for the 3atk minion, so it died next turn. Then he conceded after I equipped the 4/4 weapon. 
---
It was less about the opponent and more what the deck is capable of. With the addition of mass hysteria it can stall aggro the majority of the time and either gets the OTK or just wins on resurrect power swings. The only longer matches I’ve lost to are decks with a powerful endgame like DS rexxar and frost Jaina. 
---
It feels a little absurd 
---
Do you have enough coins for purchase and check if you changed default address on amazon. I use US amazon for coins, but when I changed the address to outside of US I wasn't able to use coins in hearthstone.

Scoeri#2270, EU, 80g, you go first
---
Wild is (by far) the less popular format. They should do it there. Every month, remove 2-3 sets of cards, then reintroduce them the following month and remove 2-3 other ones.
---
Do you not have to hit 'Done' and then yes or no to leave your deck for later anymore??????
---
No, because different expansions have each own a different pity timer.
---
Meaning you could be before purchase at 15/40  on one expansion 
---
20/40 on the other 
---
And 7/40.
---
Add 10 to each of those timer and you end with jack shit because the pity timer automatically ticks at 40.
---
So yeah. You could be really unlucky and get jack shit.
---
What's with the eyes being on and off constantly?

Hey, happened to me this month, too - I was already dreaming of the legend at rank two (second time in a row) and then fell to 4 in three days. Feels bad, but I'll try again next month, and rank 6 is a good place to start, so let's keep our collective chins up :)
---
I've actually built a control priest, but I'm not sure how it fully functions as I've only really gained some amount of success using Tempo Mage.  I used Spiteful Priest for ~300 games in a month and barely broke even as far as WR goes, and with Tempo Mage I probably played closer to 500+ games to not even come close to breaking through to rank 5 and a WR that is still fairly even.
---
After Year of the Raven, I felt the entire game shift to feeling really... sluggish and shitty.  The decks are even more draw reliant (Odd Rogue especially, unless you get a god tier hand you don't even have a shadow of a chance if they draw exactly one answer to anything) and unless you're dedicating a good portion of your deck to board control you won't be getting board control to survive against most aggressive decks.  Zoolock can often burst me down by turn 5/6 if I'm playing a slower deck, and if I bump into something like spell hunter, rinlock, or big spell mage, I'm often unable to gain any traction and run out of gas by turn 6.
---
Hopefully with the rank star changes I'll be able to climb again, but the game's not fun when it's win two lose three all day.
---
Better conveying yourself to people who otherwise might not understand you if you resort to a term they're not familiar with is awkward? I think the word you're looking for is "considerate".
---
Thanks for the guide!
---
this has been a thing for a while. in canada we have 3 prices for iOS, android and PC.
---
Is it about some console game?
---
you know, innervate, so this joke works 
---
Amazing isn't it?  The sorry emote still exists and you can hear them with Mayor Noggenfogger
---
15 damage is very, very relevant for a warlock. It’s unlikely that he can answer the 3/4 on turn 5/6 from hand some it’s a 18 vs 8 face damage
---
Yes, so glad he attacked with one of the big guys first. 
---
Revenger#2317 EU looking to trade 80g quest, I prefer you going first but I can show proof. Check my comment history to see my past successful trades.
---
10 is a rank floor, so people like playing jank.
---
Talking about no accomplishment, your mom delivered a child and it turned out to be you? FeelsBadMan
---
still he won
---
Because dungeon run is actually fun to play XD
---
It's the only time it has worked that well for me. I just got it from the Hydrologist, couldn't have worked out better.  
---
It seems it was that good of a change after all...
---
I thought it was going to be good, but it's has been actually kinda boring.
---
(op, you wrote two times 2018, just to let you know)
---
And then you have people complaining about how not listing the person was confusing and a bunch of people in the comments explaining the stuff that would be let out.
---
It's part of HS's history, and it was a pretty significant event.  Now if he's gotten better since then I'm sure no one will complain, but it's something that happened, and he has to live with the consequences.  
---
I guess I get a completely different feel from it.  Since this is a series of HS history, it only seems right to include the details as much as possible.  
---
yea this is the only reason I'm not really complaining about it being used again and again. At least it's enjoyable. Some improvements would definitely be nice though
---
Still see play
---
feelsbadman
---
I wouldve snap picked Marin, but thats because I tend to meme a bit too much in Hearthstone.
---
Rancelot0309#1131 looking to trade 80q NA.
---
People doing that in the comments would be fine. A mod doing it in the original post is different.
---
Oh. Do I still get allá the packs?
---
After rotation we will need a millenial one with patches, veteran, dire mole, firefly, corsair, keleseth, flappy, tar creeper, south sea, chain gang, scalebane, leeroy, creeper, bonemare.
---
All true, but his biggest impact was early board control. 
---
Shoot, thanks. Yeah I just do it cuz its fun, but after so many tries I'd like to win now lol. Don't want to try another hunter til I beat it with Toki, haven't given up yet!
---
I prefer the dust+gold
