---
These are all “real cards,” whatever that means. To the extent you mean cards that see play, deckhand and argent commander have repeatedly seen play, including within the past year, and I’m sure will see play again at some point.
---
Yeah I got screwed over by this.
---
Keep doing what you are doing. Eventually he is going to have to learn that what he did is wrong
---
Tremendous if accurate
---
I won my void game at 1 hp remaining with a 37 attack void. It was actually really interesting, I had to keep trading because my opponent would build pretty good threats and I’d be dead before I could smorc him to death
---
Its funny, Darius and Shaw I beat in one try each, but Toki and Tess gave me such headaches because of how RNG based their abilities are. The cannon(s!) is really powerful. If you get treasure that adds a cannon, or increases the damage, absolutely go for it, and do your best to pay attention to placement. You can do it.
---
"Just do stuff and win"
---
Have fun playing mountain giant on curve against a hunter with deadly shot.  I think you're salty because you never learned fundamentals, and you're angry that people keep beating you because they drew their go cards and you didn't.
---
Paladin hasn't really had a great class identity from the start.
---
Yeah but with unleash the hounds and unleash the beast it could be usable but yeah much less consistent without shimmerfly or lynx.
---
~~Trading 80g quest NA Zeus#1452.  I'll show, you go first.~~
---
Done
---
I had this happen to my opponent once except they also drew Power.
---
Hunter quest reward is good if you can get to turn 5.
---
Hah. Overwatch basically lets people make their own brawls by now, with custom rules and everything.
---
We can only dream of such technology.
---
Bingo. Resolved between the two effects before checking for death.
---
True true. The second wing isn't really that promising after all the new content in the first one though I'm going to be honest.  Might just finish it for a completionist standpoint thigh.
---
Lydun#1145 NA 80g quest trade
---
Midrange hunter
---
Works as intended now, before it wouldnt swap the costs so you'd basically spent 4 mana to draw a minion which was imo really bad
---
The art is taken from the Kill Command spell in WoW though, dating back way before wow tcg and hearthstone, so i doubt it was meant to have any card game aesthetic.
---
does it matter how they are unlocked? or when?
---
Uhhhh... If you follow definition of the word "immune" and give it taunt, only spells would be able to remove it (entomb, shadow word, mass dispell etc etc). How hard is it to admit that "immune" doesn't imply "untargetable" ?
---
Yes
---
So you are rank 10!!!  Good to know.
---
Why not play Wild and not have to waste 15000 dust worth of cards? Where you can just add a few new cars for the new sets and have your decks last a long time?
---
They did have it then in beta. However, Rogue had many mechanics and play styles while Paladin was lacking so they moved Secrets from Rogue to Paladin.
---
Considering there's 33 neutral mechs and 8 warrior mechs that appear 4 times as often that 20%, of which the devestator is on, that number seems pretty accurate.
---
Do you know why they chose that retarded url
---
The first two times I picked Khadgar’s head he managed to kill me.
---
What if Warlock Secrets cost 1 but dealt 2 damage to your hero (so ~2 Cost)
---
Yeah, MSG, Jade Druid, that was 2015 right?
---
The C’thun one seems like a bug, there’s no reason that it shouldn’t work. Especially considering temporary buffs like abusive sargeant are supposed to work
---
2016
---
I remember an earlier blue post where they said that they wanted each class to have its own feel. It’s why there were only four classes with weapons for a long time (and the ones that non-weapons classes got have like zero attack, except Druid).
---
I feel like usually people can tell tbh, especially if you have an animated portrait and completely golden cards. Maybe in the legendary scene it’s not obvious, but it certainly is in the teenage ranks.
---
Drunk mage casted the animation spell
---
No you only get a golden one if you get all 5 wings
---
Burn Insect
---
I spent years on MTGS. I'm pretty sure I still have the most-viewed EDH deck on there.
---
And cowardice is the better part of discretion.
---
There isn’t enough space for this thing in odd pally. So no
---
Thats a feelsbad
---
This is the perfect brawl for sobering up in my car at 10pm. I have no idea wtf the brawl.is but it helped me sober up
---
[You sure about that?](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34026/kill-command)
---
I'm not a long-time WoW player, so it's possible it *was* the Spell icon at some point, but it most certainly isn't now.
---
You are losing to Zuljin played properly. The strength of the card is directly related to the strength of the player. Knowing how to load him up and when to pop off takes some skill. 
---
I say this because I’m a terrible player that plays him badly and often don’t manage to make those huge game swings you’re experiencing.
---
lol? New features? From Blizzard? 
---
LMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAO
---
good cards generally win games. if you see someone at rank 18 or better, you can be somewhat certain the cards they play are the good ones.
---
that being said, if you dont have access to good cards there is a cheap strategy called 'aggro'. just pile in lots of well stated low mana cost minions. i recommend hunter. add removal as you get more cards.
---
Zoolock
---
Don’t craft Rafaam to save 1600 like I did.
---
https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1279737-ez-legend-complete-zoolock-guide
---
I'm hoping they are going to start scheduling in a buff pass at the midpoint of each expansion.
---
Since they kept all the buffs to Boomsday this time around, I'm hopeful that next expansion they'll buff a bunch of cards from Rastakhan.
---
I get what you're saying, I do want to clarify I would including "establishing rules" for conflict to fall under the umbrella of "justifying violence" which I mean as judgementally as possible. From the perspective of a Paladin though, they hold themselves to be righteous and I agree the game does a good job mechanically implementing aspects of that.
---
I have a Gold Nomi that I just can’t force myself to dust - it’ll sit there till I finally decided to try and play it
---
Huh?? It’s a high win rate card when kept in the mulligan because it fills your hand up for giant on turn 3/4
---
I totally understand the complaints.  Pulling a 7 of Spades out of a deck on the first try is hard, but not the fun kind of hard.  The heroics aren't so much hard as they are random.  You could get fucked by RNG in the past sure, but rather than getting unlucky, it feels like you have to get lucky now.
---
Way to be condescending.
---
It's a Sergeant.  Taunt + Divine Shield cause she's a protector.
---
Every time I do this the warrior just brawls and throws Down an omega devastator.
---
Look at Deathrattle Hunter for all of last year for the strongest Hunter archetype not being a kill you fast sort of deck. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for Hunters in the long run, they have empty hands because their card draw before Master's Call was crap and all burn doesn't have counterplay if it kills you, just do you best to be outside of burn range.
---
Toki be trolling.
---
Mage squad
---
Good point, didnt realize you meant only Control decks
---
Yeah mage is bullshit but it's inconsistently bullshit. And I'm not saying Hunter is super good vs it or anything, but literally every game I played vs rank 5 was Hunter and it was just tiring
---
Thanks for the trade...
---
This is so sad
---
In theory yes, in practice no. It's the worst of all brawls distilled into one clown fiesta. Random decks with random rules. At times you can concede turn one because your deck is just complete garbage.
---
Tog is insane tempo and versatile. He usually wins games and is fun to play right now.
---
I would not craft Tak or Jepetto until the buffs go live, just to see where the meta lands.
---
Except the certs on this site are actually good, the guy lied.
---
Need a friend?
---
What's his tag?
---
The people here know how the card works. The entire point is that it is unintuitive and the primary way to know what counts as a lackey or not is to either try it yourself, see it or be told, or to follow the game close enough to know to assume lackeys in the context of heistbaron are referring exclusively to a handful of RoS specific minions. AFAIK there isn't anywhere to even find out in the client was those cards are.
---
Yes please
---
ITT: Guy tries to celebrate accomplishment, calls out oppressive class while playing as one, gets shit on.
---
Every time she uses kabal chemist when Im on mobile, the game freezes. Disconnecting and reconnecting always solves the issue, but its still annoying. No idea what kund of spaghetti can cause this, though.
---
I like that idea as a playmode. Really though, we should just have custom lobby system where people can set up a rulesets like that and if you're interested hop in queue with a fitting deck
---
Rank 4 to legend requires ~20 more wins than losses. No way you had 66-75 W% if this is your first time getting to legend.
---
Good summary
---
A mimic?
---
Woah the card text for case study is nice in English... in French it says “discover a quest. Gain a copy of its reward.”
---
IIRC it was a Fireside Brawl thing. Never actually released to the Tavern Brawl itself.
---
Heroic "not for the faint of heart"
---
Thanks for the honest feedback, it's really useful. If you don't mind, I'd like to understand a bit more some of the experiences you've had (we can move to chat / DM / Discord if you're ok and if that's more convenient for you).
---
&gt; Overwolf always seems like it's trying to rope you into their ecosystem and start using all this other stuff outside of what you installed it for. It's totally bloated
---
My own experience is actually rather different here. I found that once I've installed the app, I'm not bothered by anything else - I'm just using the app(s) I installed it for.  
---
Do you have some concrete examples?
---
&gt; interferes with other apps
---
If that's the case it's probably a bug. Apps are registered to work on specific games, so if you're not playing that game there should be no interference. Do you have an example that I could share with the Overwolf team?
---
&gt; hooks into Hearthstone weird
---
This as well I'd like to understand better. AFAIK the hook into Hearthstone is pretty standard and done the same way as other HS apps do (ie read the logs, and sometimes the game's memory). If you have time, I'd love to get more of your inputs on that one.
---
&gt; has an annoying overlay system including the little app orb that's trying to act as a hub to different apps
---
Yeah I don't like that hub much myself either. I found that it was disappearing completely while in-game though, so it didn't really bother me.
---
Thanks again for the generous feedback and for taking the time to make the apps better :)
---
Cheers!
---
If they are totally new they aren’t gonna be winning arena for a while.
---
there are a lot of retarded combos - I got mana cost halved treasure, duplatransmogrified a wargear and had a (reduce mana cost by 2) hero power, so in other words, every game started out with a 5/5 which then grew +5/+5 each next turn. The funniest game was against a boss who have attack reducing cards and hero power.
---
The game took an interesting turn when he mindgamed an Antonidas from my deck of 19 wargears and some spells and then resurrected him twice. Unfortunately for him, his face could only take so much beating... https://hsreplay.net/replay/o5pgCDbeHmLEqRzARCksz3
---
Yeah my MMR got fuqed by playing resurrect Priest
---
Back in the day, if someone would say such a card existed i would tell them they are fucking drunk, now i lost my faith in the dev and balance team.
---
Becomes a regular Mukla then. Tk Tk.
---
Tol barad should suck dick but I just won against randomonium.
---
Yeah, I found out the hard way, but it makes sense I guess.
---
Summon the 🅱️ncient one.
---
One time I boiled some eggs. Forgot and went to a friends house. When my mom came home the house was filled with smoke and the pot ruined forever. They were on max settings for a few hours. It can happen to the best of us. Source: it happened to me
---
Thematically it makes sense but gameplay wise I don't think it really does. They really nailed the feel of the rogue class in classic and I don't think it needed anything else. The secrets that they tried to include later felt awkward and off-theme, actually.
---
You check your mana in that case. The zero cost spells are ones which remove cards from your deck (or refresh the board)
---
In Solo Adventures every Card who can transform (Chameleon, Shifting, etc...) freeze my Game.
---
What a shit tier brawl, it is basically 'Choose bag of spells or lose"
---
You know what he meant, and yes, the classic packs are bad
---
Look up some budget decks. It will take a while to gather dust for the top of the meta decks but if you're consistently playing and clearing your quests you'll be fine. Part of the game is losing.
---
Let this be our FINAL BATTLE!
---
I only stir them once at the beginning after adding salt and never burnt them (even though I would think that sometimes they do stick to the bottom). The only way I can imagine burning potatoes is to leave them long enough for the water to evaporate. Which was close to happening for me a few times after I left them on the stove and kind of forgot, so I don't really blame OP.
---
Absolutely no references to the potions being too powerful :|
---
And what do you mean by that?
---
&gt;game breaking
---
Far too strong a term. It’s good, it’s not autowin. I wouldn’t even say it’s overtuned.
---
Oh Thijs, such adorable.
---
I completely disagree that that's balanced. Aggro decks (tempo rogue, murloc shaman) shouldn't ever have an even vaguely viable value-generating alternate gameplan. Control decks (conjurer mage) shouldn't have the possibility to nut draw, curve out perfectly and kill by turn 5 or 6 (MG has allowed this for years and I've despised it the entire time). Midrange decks (midrange hunter, bomb warrior) shouldn't have insane burst potential early while also being able to beat fatigue decks on turn 30.
---
People are still posting this? *facepalm*
---
I'm so triggered
---
Thats what i call overkill. Damn
---
Weapon kills and re-summons the 6/6 drake for OP, which allows for continuous use of hero power. Hero power summons a horseman. Four Horsemen... gg.
---
I'd think most people would get the hint after 300 games. Your persistance is admirable, at least.
---
Yeah kinda sad, i played that deck a bunch since priest is my favourite class but it just gets punished for being soooo slow by a lot of the meta. Also mage does the same thing for half the mana plus cyclone. Priest could use some help rn.
---
Congrats on Legend!
---
Thanks. I'm always encouraged when I see someone listening to reason rather than relying on their ill-founded emotions.
---
The card is clearly inherently busted. Carnivorous Cube was an utterly broken card and it's so easy to craft decks where Calling is effectively Cube+cube activator for less mana and half of a card.
---
FACE IS THE PLACE
---
Can you show your decklist for Nerf Hunter?
---
Yes, was connected to WiFi. I have googled and it has happened to other players but they actually lost their cards which was unlucky.  My cards were showing in the collection when I reconnected.
---
May be mechathun warrior but any otk deck is hard to play conjure mage and mech hunter too strong for any deck able to sustain
---
This feels like the first response that actually feels like it could make the card outweigh the opportunity cost of not taking the other treasures
---
The class is still hated for some reason.
---
They could HoF Leeroy and then balance aggro decks around it. Aggro decks would be happy because they'd have more consistent gameplans (legendaries are inherently less consistent) while everyone else would be happier because the games would less often come down to "well I'm only dead to Leeroy...".
---
The only possible way to have more than 2 giants by turn 4 would be to go second, have book on turn 2, Giant turn 3, coin khad + cc t4. Sure, there are games where this may happen, but it is so unlikely everything clicks like that you can’t always say “that’s gonna happen”
---
Did you ever face pre nerfed cube warlock? Lol 
---
Warrior is super unfun to play against I will admit. But conceding before the game starts is crazy to me. Maybe it’s the types of decks I play but I beat warrior the majority of the time. Just takes a while
---

ezpz
---
I think the reason people are flipping tables is that they fear these cards will now be overpowered and it's generally not fun to play against overpowered cards.
---
Confirmed Gruul op blizzard nerf
---
o n e b y o n e
---
No i just played the adventure
---
Prep- raiding party- dread Corsair- dread Corsair- waggle pick was not an uncommon play pre nerf. And it certainly didn’t cost 8 mana
---
I mean no offense .. Why there is so many downvotes.. God it really feels bad man.
---
Your VPN is more than likely causing this issue for you. You should research certificate errors caused by VPN and consider updating your post.
---
It is absolutely realistic to play the game without spending any money. Money will speed things up in the beginning and allow you to experiment more, but even new players can build good decks very quickly since there are always affordable meta decks and the new player experience offers enough free packs and guaranteed legendaries that you can craft some of those decks pretty much without fail.
---
As long as you stick with the game and manage your resources properly, there's really no reason to spend money on the game.
---
Dice#21575 EU trade i'll show and you go first

Oh didn't realize that's how probability works.
---
I’m sure it’s 1600 per Elysiana, not just the first copy.
---
I dind't saw people requesting for scourgelord Garrosh get a buff, and Deathstalker Rexxar a nerf. And the power level of Rexxar is in other level that Dr Boom.
---
Definitely packs. Buy individual packs of each set until you get the legendary that is guaranteed within the first ten packs.
---
The first 10 packs of each expansion guarantee a legendary, so you should get that from each set first.
---
Witchwood, Boomsday and Rastakhan rotate put in april 2020. You can get cards from any of the sets really, it'll make it easier to eventually get into Wild.
---
Yeah I've made that mistake before, ended up transforming my deck which previously had great synergy and curve into 20+ copies of [[King Krush]]
---
What's the issue?

Ooh a Void Singularity vs Void Singularity brawl? My favorite!
---
I thought Brann doubled battlecries? Why didn't the 7/7 flood the board with 0/8 treasures?
---
Thanks for laying out the math for me. I usually only purchase pre-order packs for their extra value so I wanted to compare the benefits. Also, I don’t live in the US, so the actual value of 180 packs is closer to 160 USD considering the exchange rate in Korea if you purchase via online certificates.
---
What he says, specifically, is that battlecries trigger twice. That isn't double, it sets it to all battlecries trigger 2 times.
---
I figured that I would have to craft it. I wanted to know because I don't have the necessary amount of dust yet and I am trying to figure out which cards I ought to get rid of for more dust. Thanks.
---
yeah, but even then the weapon must be empty
---
oondasta x2 + cold + horseman x4 = 7
---
Seems like you are at your right rank.  I would just focus on one deck, even if you got on losing streaks, just pick one top tier deck and master it. If you really wanna try again next month here are some tips....
---
----
---
#How to Get Better at Hearthstone
---
#1. Find the best Deck to play
---
&gt;The most important thing for your first climb is to pick the most "overpowered" or "Tier-1" deck.  This will mask a lot of your early mistakes as you learn to play at a higher level and reduce the time to climb.
---
If there is a recent [Vicious Syndicate Meta Report](https://data-reaper-report.vicioussyndicate.com) I would use that as a primary reference.  [Hearthstone Top Decks](http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/?st=-HCT&amp;class_id=&amp;style_id=&amp;t_id=&amp;f_id=&amp;pt_id=1&amp;sort=new) keeps a pretty good curated list that is great between meta reports.  And [Neon31HS has a good Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/neon31hs?lang=en) that lists as many Legend decks as they can. *(Overwhelming but very thorough.)*
---
* I wouldn't use sites like [Hearthpwn](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-is-forge=2&amp;filter-unreleased-cards=f&amp;filter-show-standard=1&amp;filter-show-constructed-only=y&amp;filter-deck-tag=1) because they use clickbait stats and are often more fun/memes then competitive.
---
* I would [only use HSReplay if I had the premium service](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i) or wanted to find my opponents deck.  This is because they only show the winrate across all ranks.  So while a deck may show a 65% winrate across all ranks, it might have a 45% at 4-Legend.  You just don't truly know the best decklists (Also, doesn't capture breaking decklists because it requires 10 different submitters with at least 400 games.
---
* I would consider using decklists off /r/competitiveHS because they do a good job curating there and stay away from clickbait titles.  The plus side is sometimes you can find a guide along with the list to help your mulligans and reduce the learning curve.
---
* [Finally, you can see the strongest deck archetypes over the past 24 hours by using VS Live](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/data-reaper-live-beta/).  It tells you the 5 best decks for Legend, Rank 1-4, and 5-14. (*and its free*!)
---
#2. Identify Your Mistakes
---
&gt;You can get better playing hundreds of games and teaching yourself or you can speed this up by watching your replays, hiring a coach, studying other player/streamers, or using a premium service ([HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i))
---
######"Actively" study Replays
---
If you don't want to study your own replays, you can find high [Legend replays for your deck archetype at MetaLegend](https://metalegend.com/).  Before the player makes their move, make your decisions on mulligans or lines of play, say it aloud to commit yourself, and if the player does something different, ask yourself why.  Be harsh on yourself if your line of play deviates in the slightest.
---
######Find little known streamers to ask questions. 
---
There are lots of streamers who are Legend and never hit the front page on [Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hearthstone). Scroll down and find high ranked players with few viewers. (Look for Orange Diamond signifying Legend rank) They are a lot more interactive then the "top streams" where you have to make a donation to get seen and are probably playing purely competitive decks. (Instead of "fun" decks).  Alternatively, you can donate money or subscribe to a popular stream in hopes of having them answer your question. *(You can give a free sub with Amazon Prime)*
---
######Discord isn't a bad option either
---
You can join the /r/competitiveHS discord channel from their subreddit sidebard and there is a channel called ["Team-Up"](https://discordapp.com/channels/172846449854382081/458609710346534912) where you can voice chat with other players as they climb.  Even if you can't get free coaching, maybe just hanging out with a better play would help you learn.  If you don't want to voice chat, ask if you can add them as a friend and just spectate them.
---
#3. Learn the Mulligans
---
######Use a Premium Service like HSReplay for Mulligans
---
&gt;Paying for services or a coach can reduce the learning curve/time.  But is entirely optional and unnecessary to reach Legend.  
---
I don't think this is needed but the extra step besides studying players/replays is to pay $5/month for access to [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i).  Here you can look at the best performing decks at Legend and see their mulligan winrate percentages versus specific classes or decks.  
---
Knowing the right mulligans will increase your winrate by at least a few percentage points.  On this data alone, I think the Premium service justifies its cost for at least a month or two to fully learn and identify the correct mulligans for each matchup.   It's also useful to identify the underperforming or weakest cards in the deck as those are viable options to cut for tech cards.
---
######Find a Coach
---
Instead of [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i) you might find someone on the Hearthstone Discord (as mentioned above) who is willing to spectate/teach you how to play their deck.  Or you might offer to pay someone to teach you the ins, outs, and mulligans of a specific deck on a site like /r/HScoaching. It is up to you.
---
Daaaamn, that’s what I’m talking about, it’s silly, it’s fun, it’s annoying to others. Perfection
---
I know thats why im focusing my resources on rise of shadows that way my dust will last longer
---
So each Brann doesn't have it own active effect? Shouldn't the battlecry have trigger 5 times + 1 with the passive?
---
I caught boiled peas on fire because I forgot that they were on the stove for 3 hours
---
Interestig, not really into wild but ill check it out
---
Thanks for the suggesting, ill hold for a few packs and if i dont get togwaggle ill craft it
---
I had a run where I had picked "All your minions have Stealth". Then this guy came up and it was one of the most satisfying games I have ever had.
---
Sorry, You're welcome, wow that rng, wow that is a good play, wow you fucked up
---
lots of emotes would be nice... same with chat, but eh... idk
---
pretty sure that's a bug as it doesn't say summon.
---
I appreciate the help. However iv been playing HS for the past 4 years and it really boils down to grinding a fast, meta zoo or tempo deck for 100 games or so. The post is more just a fun summary of my quest to find the perfect deck to climb with in the past 2 months:)
---
All of them do have their own. Imagine it like this.
---
The battlecry counter for your 7/7 is 1. Your passive makes it 2. When Brann is on the board, he sets that counter to 2 again. The other Branns also set that counter to 2, they don't double it. All they do is make that number say "2."
---
indeed
---
(FYI: Zilliax was discounted to 0)
---
couldn't they just...buff shrink ray?
---
Unable to counter my point, they resort to a good old fashioned [Red Herring.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring)
---
Congrats on your loss.

That was back when they didn't buff cards. If it happened today it might be a possibility.
---
That could be the best solution, I guess I just always had a thing about not buying giftcards. Felt a bit too lazy, only like one step above just handing them cash, just less flexible, but he does play other Blizzard games so he will certainly find use for it.
---
Don't be disingenuous, swapping cards is clearly different from summoning cards both mechanically and semantically.
---
Fun fact, refreshing the tavern with this guy, he pulls out non mechs.
---
i mean they can jsut undo the nerfs then. Hopefully they do so, equality was a major staple in the paladin class and kept a lot of decks in check.
---
Which minion dies? The summoned minion or the controlled minion?
---
Not all minions are summoned; they can also be appear by being transformed. Polymorph/hex/faceless/evolves don’t trigger knife jugglers (or Khadgar, of course).
---
I thought arch villain Rafaam would be horrible since boomsday and rastakhan didn't have such impactfull legendaries.
---
I though that the best archetype would be dragon paladin and treant token druid
---
I also thought that Kadghar mage would suck since I knew that [[A new challenger]] was horrible, and it was based on random 6-drops, Wich meant that also [[Power of Creation]] would also be bad, Wich meant that the whole archetype would suck
---
I was pretty wrong and pessimist about the whole expansion
---
Yikes you’re really wrong here man. Alarmo-bot says to swap a minion from hand, and it triggers knife juggler when it does swap a minion with itself, this also happen with Doctor Morrigan and Madam Goya. Both trigger knife juggler, which specifies summon, and use the word “swap”. 
---
To start, if this this was an unintended interaction they likely would have fixed it six years ago when it was originally found that alarmo triggers knife juggler. But we don’t need that bit of common sense to debunk your argument. 
---
Minions can only enter play through two different ways in the code, being played from the hand and being summoned from other cards such as Unexpected Results. (Side note, based on your logic knife juggler wouldn’t work when playing a minion from hand). The word “swap” is seen by the game as “summon minion 1 from X location and move minion 2 to X location”, this comes to very very closely resemble the dictionary word “swap”. So the word swap is used as a pseudo keyword to define how the minions will move from place to place from the card’s effect. 
---
Hope that makes sense and clears up and confusion.
---
Thats the next logical evolution in game mechanics imo, would make some cards playable if you could handbuff them to have taunt/rush/divine shield
---
Looks like in our review, we rated Fel Lord Betrug a 5 out of 5. Whoops. :D [http://www.thehappyhearthstone.com/rise-of-shadows-review-part-1-episode-162/](http://www.thehappyhearthstone.com/rise-of-shadows-review-part-1-episode-162/)
---
This. One deck per month is what I do when I push for legend. Also helps focusing on a couple classes (pally, shaman, druid for me) and DEing the ones you're not interested in so you can really learn them and stay F2P.
---
That dragon has the most epic voice in the game
---
Dirty Rat pulled out a 6/6? Looks like the game loves you.
---
OK go
---
Already claimed
---
This is why we need a way to view our adventure deck while in the tavern.
---
Another hour
---
It's hard to master nine decks. Concentrate on one or a few and get to know those really well.
---
Yup, not a bug, just showing new players what a big minion looks like by making him extra big and appearing out of board.
---
Aggro?
---
Come one guys they are a small indie company give them a break
---
When I misplay and my opponent says thank you so I can channel my salt into something.
---
275... Should try 38268234438223
---
I’m aware lol
---
We need an entire post just explaining niche or weird flavor for cards
---
Why does that make you happy?
---
shield bearer does nothing????
---
I gave my gibberer +2/+2 and always start in my hand from one of my tavern encounters! Very brain dead with easy wins but not very fun
---
I thought conjurs calling was garbage when it was revealed. Oof
---
Currently it is too powerful for the state of the game, but before the last rotation it was an optional inclusion because it couldn't out value the good death knights anyways. It's a shame that we're in a position now where it looks stupid OP because the game around it has shifted away from long game value generators.
---
Does anyone ever remember what most of the elixirs do without looking them up or am I just a casual?
---
The infinite mode in slay the spire is pretty boring imo
---
Alright then. What if *you* have khadgar and play dirty rat?
---
But are you a dad with no friends to share it with and with a newborn.
---
Your complaints are literally just the negative version of Whizbang decks. The good decks you say are worse versions of the meta decks, which Whizbang has. The bad decks don't do anything - same thing can be said of the Whizbang decks.
---
Your argument can be 100% applied to Whizbang instead of Zayle and still make just as much sense.
---
Zayle is better for F2P players who don't have the meta decks because they're closer to meta decks than Whizbang. You can get pretty decent ranks with those decks, probably even Legend. Can't say the same about Whizbang.
---
At least you didnt have to bargain. :p
---
after the first 19 die
---
that is very cool, and to my knowledge, the first khadgar interaction that works without the word "summon" in it.
---
Elixir of vim always looks tempting but it always ends up with me burning a bunch of my cards by turn 5. How do you guys set up Elixir of vim for your drafts? Even if my deck starts pretty cheap, the picks they give me always end up making my decks pretty top heavy
---
Rhykker loves his plaid patterns
---
Sorry my internet did not work until now . Are you still up?
---
&gt;wouldn't work if you had a full hand
---
You're assuming there are other status checks
---
&gt; that isn't recursive, it's just a while loop.
---
It is recursive if you have at least one other minion in your hand as it will eventually meet it's terminate condition. Otherwise yeah it becomes a while loop lol.
---
You just need to lose 3 in row, then win 3 in a row, BOOM extra star. Wash, rinse, repeat. You'll be there in no time!
---
Basically we have seen this interaction since day 1 of the adventure
---
Got oblivitron, is there a mech deck that is using it?
---
In case anyone is curious, the warrior hero power that adds bombs to the opponent’s deck is two 3 damage bombs (so possibly a 6 damage hero power for 2, and still strong if one hits). Not sure how they interact with the new Boom that summons boombots.
---
Yea can do
---
I cringed so hard at that title I might produce a perfect diamond the next time I go to the toilet.
---
Let me add you , my name is PandaPadawan
---
hey guys I just hit dad legend xd
---
And? With all the different mechanics involved in the heist adventure, you think they can’t just remove the adding cards options from the tavern when you’re maxed out?
---
because they basicially moved all the hard challenges to heroic. its kind of similar to the old adventures, normal mode is a walk in the park, heroic beats your face in without any sign of remorse.
---
Someone gets it
---
Conjurer's Calling is by far the card I was most wrong about.
---
"What if I don't concede?"
---
"I'll try asking you again next turn."
---
If it's optional, it's going to mostly be those hilarious OP decks against each other though, which would probably be good for laughs :)
---
Like the sign at the corner.
---
Not from rank 5 to 1 bro. Winstreaks dont exist there
---
Okay. Except, they almost exclusively are for something like playing Hearthstone in bed.
---
Depends on which ones golden
---
While it took myself about 3 years to beat DK64
---
cloak is golden
---
No. It's because a 1 Mana increase is major, particularly in a tempo deck. It could likely have survived that increase if Prep wasn't hit, too, but it can't survive both. I'm not sure how you figure a card wasn't broken just because it sees no play after a nerf.
---
Busted card got nerfed and now sees very little play. Shocking.
---
*epiphany ensues*
---
HoneyCentaur#1670 NA 80g quest trade
---
*Just in time.*
---
It’s missing CHARRRRGE to make it good.
---
Look! No hands! 
---
Or anything else for that matter...
---
Make sure to add a golden copy so you get more dust when it’s nerfed 😈
---
Swampqueen.  She is standard in murloc shaman while lists that run scargil are very rare, and while a couple lists do run shudderwock, he is not standard in the archetype.  Additionally, a lot of his power in the deck comes from copying the swamp queen battlecry, so it doesn't make sense to craft him before her.
---
Control warrior
---
Meh I get around day to day with just arms
---
I think Alarm-o-bot would give you a run for your money on that claim.
---
They came from his deck, they're his cards, therefore they can't hurt him.
---
And again, I say, Blizz should bring in permanent effects on the board for some legendaries. Like deathwing leaving cracks on the board, or Lich King freezing it a bit, or even Tyrantus stomps remaining on the board would look so cool. The more the game went on, the more the board would reflect it.
---
That's for Hall of Fame, my dude. OP could disenchant every one of these for full cost if they were nerfed.
---

And it would probably be equally as boring in Hearthstone, since thats essentially what OP asked for.
---
Because plenty of cards have seen play after a 1 mana increase that were never considered broken.
---
It was never JUST raiding party that was “broken”. It was enabled by a broken card (prep). That’s why most evaluations of the nerf have been people saying they don’t understand why both were hit when the prep nerf alone was fine because a nerf to prep was a nerf to raiding party.
---
Your link literally just says you can perform a loop with recursion or with iteration but they way you described it literally wasn't recursion. You could have described it with recursion to get the same results but you didn't. Recursion and Iteration are not the same thing but they can both accomplish the same thing.
---
I thought evil miscreant would be mediocre due to the atrocious stats and combo requirement. Didn’t think the lackeys would be as busted as they are.

Wall Priest is definitely fuck aggro
---
Thanks
---
I'm guessing "that card exists" is for [[Cathedral Gargoyle]], and you're playing Dragon Paladin. Priest is probably Wall Priest.
---
that's not their answer. they don't do it because they want heroes to be more "important". by handing them out very rarely people tend to get more attached to their favorites than if we had 9 new ones dumped on us

$45 for a shitty $15 flannel lol

In this case its 0%. Truly unfortunate. Great screenshot!
---
It’s a delayed hero power that’s three times as strong as the hunter hero power.  It still isn’t good on the later bosses, but it’s more than slightly more powerful.
---
You better get that hero power off quick
---
cough cough cho
---
I had kind of a similar idea
---
&gt;The basic idea is, of course, after each clear of 8 bosses, you can start another run with an increased difficulty. Incrased health, extra mana, an extra draw, stronger hero powers &gt;etc. Additionally, I think, each week would have 3 treasures that bosses obtain as you clear successive runs e.g. Glyph of Warding, Small Backpack and so on. At the end of the &gt;week based on your relative performance, you might get a pack or golden card or two.
---
&gt;The main question is how does your deck carry on between runs. It's easy to imagine that as you get more and more treasures, they would quickly outscale anything the game &gt;could throw at you, and that as your deck becomes increasingly large, each bucket of cards that you pick has a relatively smaller effect.
---
&gt;My thought is that, between each clear, you have a special friendly encounter, with the Villain for that wing replacing Bartender Bob. You've handed over your deck, and he's giving &gt;you your cut back for the next run. So, just as in the normal friendly encounter, you get a series of cards that allow you to manipulate your deck, except you're setting up the deck &gt;that you get to keep in between each run, and rather than the 'enemy' minions/deck being randomly selected, it's the deck you just used to clear the previous run. You'd have 10 &gt;'gold' rather than the 2, but the cards might have more wildly varying costs - saving a treasure permanently might cost you 5 gold, for example.
---
&gt;Ultimately, the aim is that this means rather than just having a crazy exponentially scaling deck where the game is settled on turn 1, you're slowly improving the quality of your &gt;deck, preserving a bit of each run each time.
---
&gt;I think this would be an enjoyable competitive PvE mode, where players could demonstrate a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the dungeon run, rather than just waiting &gt;until they get the nuts and never coming back.
---
Does he jave a Knockoff Emote for Sorry with the help of Major?
