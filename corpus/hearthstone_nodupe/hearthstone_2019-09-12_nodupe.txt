I got hunter quest for my login, shaman quest within 20-30 packs and Druid quest on my 38th pack I believe.

Yeah it's some side panel one that reloads and for some reason make the main page article resize when the ads space loads a new ad.

Secret mage is pretty good. All you need is Aluneth and everything else is rare/epic/common. Sometimes stargazer Luna is used but not necessary.

I googled ARS too and now I'm grounded... must have safe search off..

Is that the part where a sentient bullet pulls a real bullet out of a guys brain and saves his life because the the real bullet was blocked by a chunk of ice the guy had in his hat?

This lost any sense of "being reasonable" as soon as you said we should get dust back for buffs.

Did the fact that you fucked up ever cross your mind?

She can be game-winning in arena but thats the only time I've seen her used well.
---
A card not intended for your particular classes doesn't work and you want to change it based on the interaction when it is stolen?
---
With that logic they should just remove all the badly stated high drops for when I want a good evolve target too.

Mage gives you more wishes just FYI

There is no rule prohibiting you from doing so.

OMG we have a new GM here. Someone call Blizzard and give this guy a spot on Blizzcom  in the finals.

Rogue from login and then unpacked most of them except Hunter and Warrior.

This is my dilemma :/

At least they added "from a different class" cards. Until you get some garbo warlock cards.

Wow...
---
My opponent used it turn 2 it to kill my tempo coined murloc with a crab. Then he played a murloc. So I used mine to do the same thing, because nothing else I could play turn 2 could compete with a 3/4.
---
He ended up conceding a few turns later after he lost the board.

That is the right way.

Lol I need to leave this subreddit cause I'm going to check out these posts everytime. I want ToT to be surprising!

Ok rad but where did the wish card come from? I haven't played in a while.

Ha, I'll take some of that.

Hmmm.... I like it. Blizzard would probably never print something like this, but I think it's a fantastic design.

I already saw this. It's a fucking bad solution and the AI play so bad it's not even fun.

You're right sorry, the word entitled is well out of my vocabulary.

They have no obligation to refund you for changes, we are lucky enough to get refunds for the hard nerfs.

Hows 199 RP life?

You missed Vulpera Scoundrel

Yeah, I know.

But I figured that they implement a real solution for the thing instead of hardcoding everything until today.

HS does so many things hardcoded it baffles me...
---
Turn 3 SI:7 Agent with a 2 health minion on the opponent's side. Pretty good swing.

This, coin, level up, lightforged dinosaur thing next turn... big rip

This is sad to hear, but it's the truth.

HS will always be the game of tomorrow, never adding the things that would make it a better game.

Hmm creepy.

I have a few...
---
I was sure [[Untamed Beastmaster]] was a sleeper. I tried my hardest to fit it into [[Master's Call]] midrange hunter, eventually evolving the deck into a variant using [[Emerald Hive Queen]] and [[Dinomancy]]. The big finish was Dire Frenzied Young Dragonhawks, [[Goblin Prank]]s and a Tundra Rhino for charge. I think with the old Hunter quest it could have been win.
---
This set it has been [[Whirlkick Master]] and [[Shadow of Death]]. Shadow of Death should be good, it's just hard to combo it at 4 mana, and whenever there is something cool an opponent plays to hit with it, I can't draw the copies. 
---
I unpacked golden [[Gronk]] and failed making that work for several weeks. 
---
I thought I was close with Baron Samedi, but it just wasn't fast enough.
---
I like these terrible decks so much my casual mmr tanked to the point I was getting rage-friended by rank 15+ players when I won.

/r/theydidntdothemath
---
I gave one example that EVEN WHEN THE TEXT IS LITERALLY THE SAME, the card DOES NOT WORK the same.
---
So in HS you can never know how the card will work, because even cards with literally the same text, work in different ways because reasons.
---
The bullshit cards that you literally don't know what it will does is beyond this.
---
That‚Äôs not creepy or anything
---
Yep, exactly.
---
You can get fucked by bosses hero powers and Cards too. AND miss buffs like the Dire Wolf. Cards like Meteor can really fuck you because you simple don't know how the card will work.
---
 [I actually drew another Prep](https://imgur.com/M6VvWmy)
---
After I played it.
---
Reading the text I expected the same behavior of Obsidian Destroyers because it have the same text.
---
But nope, I did NOT know what the card does. This can cost me a game because I expected to play around a meteor or use a dire wolf buff and simple lose because of inconsistency.
---
I play single player mode far more often than ranked or arena.
---
Really though, with faceless manipulator and leeroy in the neutral package you could push 16 with any classfrom an empty board using just neutral cards (abusive sergeant.) Stuff like power overwhelming, cold blood, and shadowstep made this a lot worse.

There is a difference between ‚Äúcontrolled RNG‚Äù and Flunky being able to pull itself, Tomb Guardian or Armegedillo almost every single time it‚Äôs played. 
---
Even as a long time Control Warrior player, these nerfs were a long time coming.
---
Before the patch I could juggle 2 Flunkys/Hero Power/Omega Assembly to the point where I was playing 3-4 Tomb Guardians/Armagedillos per game, often more.
---
Pretty unbalanced mechanic, to be honest.
---
your reply seems to suggest you don't understand that you can buy packs without using money simply by completing daily quests and playing ranked with the intention of climbing. conceding after every win to stay at rank 20 would gain a marginal increase in the amount of packs opened each expansion at the expense of never testing one's skill or accomplishing anything in the game. i don't find it plausible that anyone is actually doing that.
---
At first glance, it seems like bad design to have MCT be one of the only ways to counter MCT besides just never playing 4 minions
---
Yeah they should also remove inner fire and Divine spirit as the combo priest niche really limits the design potential for priest.
---
It does already.
---
Hey, Karl's alive! Good to know.
---
You get cards/packs for the Knights of the Frozen Throne adventure and for the first wing of Dalaran Heist, both of which are free. KotFT has already rotated to Wild, but you can always dust if you don't want to play Wild (although you should consider playing Wild). Next week's Adventure will also include free packs for the first wing. 
---
With both Dalaran Heist and next week's Tombs of Terror you can purchase for gold, your choice. The rewards aren't as good as just buying packs with gold, but there's a lot of replayability in these Adventures compared to the old ones, so buy if you enjoy.
---
On top of that, there are also occasional PvE-related quests in the dailies, so watch out for them.
---
The reason you're struggling right now is probably that genuinely new players start at Rank 50 and get enough free packs in the climb from R50 to R25 to get a decent deck by the time they hit R25. You, as a returning player, probably got less, but you should still have enough to build a competitive deck unless you only like ultra-expensive ones.
---
What's Beowulf?
---
Same here for me on Samsung Galaxy s10e

That‚Äôs true, I probably was lucky that my opponent tried to mirror my actions and picked flame imp as well without any significant follow up.

---
I have Galaxy S7, and the game runs "fine". The animations just take about 1.5x longer than on PC, which sucks when playing against people who do a lot of stuff in a single turn.
---
My guess is it doesn't see frost nova as a way of winning the game since it just delays a turn and your opponent will even play cards in his turn to gain further advantage. Which doesnt make sense in practice since you'll die in the next turn to the full board, but that's just my two cents on how the algorithm functions.
---
A beginner will get steamrolled by arena, not worth the risk. They need packs not dust, so arena rewards are less useful.
---
Very creative, but do it work against not warrior?
---
Just had the same thought. My problem is that the update goes live in the middle of the night (EU), so when I go to bed, there is no update but once I‚Äôm on the bus to commute to work I can‚Äôt play because update. And I have a very generous mobile data plan where I could easily download the 1GB. Now I have to wait the entire day to get home to download the update and won‚Äôt be able to play today because family. Quite frustrating as it means I lose a quest spot (was full yesterday).
---
2 gig updates every week when I'm on spotty wifi is asinine

Fantastic composition and color, just needs a little more polish on the details. Awesome work!

I'd say don't aim for 50 packs, aim to get the first two legendaries from each expansion from this year (normally takes around 30 packs) and then stop. Year of the dragon should be a somewhat half assed attempt for you, in order to have enough saved for a serious buying spree next year.
---
DO NOT blow all your gold on a single expansion, that's extremely cost inefficient as you'll open lots of crappy duplicates.

My bad about Arena, I only play constructed so that's where my mind immediately goes. Yeah, arena is a different game entirely and mctech is definitely busted there. But like you say, it was already removed there and is fine in constructed.
---
425 gold, a pack and a golden rare

I usually just wait until one is on then lol. If you're really desperate, just add someone after a game. Eventually someone will add you. Then you get to meme them with the classic "80?" message.

---
Yes.
---
RIP
---
But why, i only have 2 mana, that secret is explosion, why he gives me this pick when he can gives me the real "perfect" pick :v
---
The best way to beat murloc paladin is to make it extremely awkward for them to lens turn 4.
---
Oh,right,I remembered there was one,but it was Glowstone Technician which has been buffed to 5 mana.
---
On Android I have to:
---
1. Go to the Play store to download a 8MB update
---
2. Wait for 20 minutes with the game on intro screen downloading 1GB of data
---
3. Wait another 30 min for a 1.5GB asset download in-game. For me this slows the app so much I can't play while downloading, it would lose me every game. 
---
It's not just the insane amount of data to download each update, it's the babysitting.
---
Likely didn't see one secret as worth the flare (zephyrs wouldn't know it was explosive), what was on the board for explosive
---
Combo decks like Snip-Snap Warlock and Quest Mage / Exodia Mage also had strong winrates against it.
---
Ultimately, Big Priest is an anti-Control deck, so it's not surprising it had strong winrates against Control decks. 
---
If we're talking about dominance, I'd argue that Genn/Baku had a much more warping effect due to the power level of Even Shaman / Odd Paladin / Odd Rogue, decks that have been frequently assigned to the Top 3 of Tier 1 by both Vicious Syndicate and Tempo Storm. It wasn't until Secret Mage got a bunch of tools in SoU that we've seen a lasting shift at Tier 1.
---
I could never guess Elise was into dwarves...
---
Hearthstone is also a brand of chili, which is on that box there.

---
Face hunter is your best bet. The current meta is dominated by the deck especially since the catastrophic nerf to one of the very few defensive options of warrior; Dr.Boom the Mad Genius. It barely has any way to gain armor now which makes them an instant win against the mighty face hunter. As Kripparian (a famous professional card game strategist) always says; one drops are overpowered in this game, which makes elven archer and stonetusk boar imbalanced cards with no viable ways to counter.

If anything, I think it should be the other way round, as there's a clear monetary value associated with a "win" in a physical card pack, but not in the digital one.

Cool, happy to help.

That interaction would also freeze my brain
---
This is getting ridiculous. Can you scroll down and see there are dozens are posts of this matter?!
---
We don't see the turn from the start - OP might have still taken some time to think whether he wants to drop Grom or not. But there are no options to consider, there are no other plays you can make here. The only Secret you're really afraid of is Freezing Trap, and you aren't going to trigger it by dropping a vanilla 3/3 when your opponent has a 3/1 on the board to trade right into it. You could theoretically make it a 8/5 with Inner Rage + Rampage, but OP said that he was sure that the one of the Secrets is either Pressure Plate or Rat Trap and it plays into both of them. Grom is your only option.
---
The only consideration was whether to play Inner Rage or not, and that's what OP was most likely thinking about. Playing Inner Rage means that you still have lethal even if the Secret is not Explosive, but you basically lose the game to Pressure Plate. Not playing Inner Rage means that you have lethal if it's Explosive, don't have lethal if it's not, but you still keep a 4/9 minion on the board in that case, so you might still have a shot at winning the game. That's basically the only real decision he had this turn.
---
Also Mirror entity into potion of polymorph so it's not immediately destroyed.
---
I'd say that Control Warrior absolutely devastating you means that the deck is pretty much not Tier 1. Same issue as Aggro Warrior, since Control Warriors are just so common nowadays.
---
Even that being said however, I agree that Murloc Shaman is underrated. Underbelly Angler and Toxfin are still pretty much as close as you can get to an OP card, and honestly the addition of the Mogu package seems both intriguing and logical at the same time. ^^I ^^gotta ^^try ^^that ^^out.

It seesm that way, doesnt it?  Loads of Shamans and Hunters.  Then, you go to wild and expect to see a few different decks..... but....its just MORE shamans, huntards and a few Warlocks.  At least between ranks 7-10 where Im at.  Sooooooo boring, win or lose.

The other times I've hit Rank 5, I had to scrap for it. I'm kind of glad the first time I did it wasn't handed to me, but also really appreciate the step up this month.
---
It could be both, it's just more likely that they're just reusing sunk costs over getting stats. It's not a given they want more 'data', and it's not a given that the data from the brawl would be useful. But it's a lock-in that they want to get more out of their investment.

Was playing a game on ladder and with an almost full board I played Stormbringer. Everyminion was normal except Swampqueen. She didn't get any spells cast on her or debuffs, she was legit just summoned as a 1/5.

I had a similar experience first time pushing to legend.  There was a guy auto-conceding that gave me two wins when I was at rank 1 (but not the final boss).  I was a little sad that I didn't "earn" that first legend.  I did it the next month without getting any cheese wins at the end that time.
---
(and then i haven't played the game much since then....)
---
I mean it‚Äôs two different artists for the two Mage legendaries, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this one had a different artist from the original as well. Different art styles for different artists and all. Why they didn‚Äôt have one person do the art for all of them though, I have no clue.
---
I just went to HSReplay, and they have exactly zero hunter decks with Misdirection in it.  I specified that you need to worry about generated ones, but nobody has it in their deck.
---
Blame Unity Engine.
---
So team 5 realease a bunch of quests just to render them unplayable because they allow this types of decks to exist. SeemsGood
---
And they said no wishing for more wishes
---
Isn't the flavour that Brann rides the beast and then rides another beast when that dies?
---
With my RNG there is no chance I would've survived that.
---
4020 B0laze it
---
Which is why I specified rank 10+. Past rank 10 there are less netdecks and less people with full collections. I said you were probably right...
---
"Combo Priest is the best deck in the game, and it isn‚Äôt a close call."  
---
.23% better winrate than the next best deck over all ranks and .24% at legend isn't a close call?
---
If they have the maximum number of secrets then it should work like that with them too yea
---
Quest Shaman is tons of fun but has anti synergy with the quest. 
---
I totally understand hating hunter, but Druid is a really great class because of how much variety is core to its identity. Quest Druid is also a really fun midrange deck.
---
100% fake, this cannot happen
---
Alterantively, perhaps try starting and conceding a run or completeing one.
---
I do this every month.  Grind from rank 8 to 5, start playing my meme Mechathun Rogue deck, and once it's clear that I have lethal on a rank 6er, just concede and add them and hope they'll hit me with an 80g quest down the road.
---
Wins on wins on wins.
---
I got 2.24% of this happening.
---
Basically, in the first round, there's a 92.3% chance of not killing the opponent (1/13).
---
In the second round, there's a 91.7% chance of not killing the opponent (1/12). The probability of note hitting opponent in both 1st and 2nd round is therefor 0.923\*0.917 = 0.846, so 84.6%.
---
If we continue down this specific path, it's a 2.24% chance that the pyroblast *won't* hit the opponent in all of these cases.
---
Opening 100 packs, i got 3 legendarys i am so happy this game is not a cashgrab LUL
---
You da real MVP
---
With bad enough luck that could have gone on for literally forever with it just hitting your invulnerable face over and over again forever.
---
Yeah the answer is 7. 1 First wish, 3 Second Wish, and 3 Third Wish(because he had 3 Second wish cards).
---
Fuck divine spirit inner fire honestly, it's so frustrating losing to that even when you have a great start. 
---
It's so uninteractive to play against. I don't understand how mana wyrm and tunnel trogg have been nerfed, but northshire cleric is still here, and same for mind blast pushed to the hall of fame but we still have divine fire / inner spirit with these minions...
---
Thanks blizz
---
We're all hunters now.
---
The problem with being sarcastically stupid in short text is that it looks the same as someone being actually stupid enough to recommend these changes.  And you'd have to be pretty stupid to not realize that, so the difference is just splitting hairs either way.
---
Why would I try out a new strategy when ME CAN GO FACE
---
Completing a run worked for me.
---
Can I stop getting hyped?
---
In that case the original commenter just wrote the decimal answer but also with a percent sign haha.
---
ALWAYS GO FACE
---
You start with three wishes, and then thistle tea gives you two extra copies of one of them for a total of 5 right?
---
Golden rogue huh? A man of culture as well I see. You use card from another class synergies?
---
LOL - I'll fren u.
---
[High Priest Amet](https://feen.us/gl6o5x.png) in Bling form :D
---
From the Wish brawl! First Golden Legendary for this NA accout.
---
Same here. :/
---
Unless the thistle tea was a result of the first wish. Then the game would have given you six effective wishes. Or maybe I‚Äôm over thinking things
---
Same here... already deleted the cache files, stopped the agent process, restart pc but nothing works....
---
Eu had this problem all day yesterday just wait for it to get fixed quietly and blizz will pretend it never happened
---
Well he's in standard now. Don't worry.
---
He said nearly as close for a reason
---
I restarted my PC and the game whent normal this time.
---
Same. Restarting the app or windows doesn't solve it.
---
Agent Blizzard updating. Me too!
---
They conceded to let you get to rank 5? If so then thats not legit..
---
Probably nothing unbeatable. 
---
Perfect draw aggro decks would be beaten by perfect draw removal decks, perfect draw combo decks could get dirty rat etc. 
---
But it's an interesting question
---
But the issue is it can reach that value so it‚Äôs not a limit approaching infinity
---
I did the math and it has 50% chance of happening. Either it does or it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Last month I grinded from rank 16 to rank 2 with Highlander Hunter so I feel ya, I was so glad I climbed so far (my previous best was rank 9), but I was kinda disappointed I didn‚Äôt make legend.
---
On the other hand, you can argue that number has *more* significance.
---
"I cast Rod of Roasting at 50 hp and got hit three times before hitting my opponent" is not really noteworthy in any way. Whereas "I cast Rod of Roasting on a board with 11 minions and it killed *all of them* before touching my opponent" is actually a pretty cool event.
---
You could try the Amazon fire tablet, I've seen a lot of good reviews for the tablet
---
[deleted]
---
Not necessarily true. you have fish flingers and  you must save your anglers until you can generate multiple guaranteed murlocs from them.
---
opponents will try to clear multiple times but if you play the deck often, you'll be able to anticipate when your opponent will try to clear and you will hold back some of your murlocs for reload. You can make them use their board clears prematurely simply because they're afraid of a bloodlust or warleader.
---
I played mostly highlander control shaman and some nomi priest.
---
Unfortunately i don't even have a "repair" button, just an install button.
---
Same here, I guess it's a bug with their servers. Can't even start from .exe (it open then closes).
---
But it can't reach that value, every instance of the RNG is separate, and while the odds of getting any specific set of results may vary, each time there is still just as much chance that it would still just keep going face. It may be practically guaranteed, but it isn't. We are still assuming an endless amount of time, like you said.
---
This simple math doesn't quite work out. In the second round, it's not necessarily 1/12 to avoid your opponent. If you hit your face in the first round, it will still be 1/13 in the second round.
---
The actual math is super complicated.
---
Exactly, that part is obvious, what I am getting at is you can constantly use Zephyrs and the right time if Vanish was still in Classic to get a shit tonne of value off of Zephyrs
---
This is new to me.  Is this a whole channel dedicated to making fun of Kripp?
---
When you have double battlecries. Wish for Shadowsyep and Moonfire. OTK
---
Genova#1377 
---
NA
---
U go first
---
I will do this at rank floor but more frequently, after I get my first tavern brawl win of the week and especially if it is a difficult one for me, I always enter matchmaking again and instantly conceived just in case I get someone who also was having some struggles and getting frustrated and wanting a pack
---
It‚Äôs a neutral fireball. Almost Any aggressive deck will want to run it
---
outstanding move
---
5 mana deal 6 is just that good, really shows how insane fireball is, having burst in an aggro deck is really important
---
I like aggro hunter so I will consider
---
r/woooooosh
---
Collosus is pretty good in big decks, possibly can have uses in the future. 
---
I would say quest warlock is worse, at least you can complete this one without having to highroll.
---
Tbh I really hate the idea of just slaughtering like 8 different decks at once, some people play wild because it means very little money invested every expansion as decks only change a little, this would just make wild even less played
---
the insta concede afterwards speaks another language.
---
I actually do, thanks for the reminder!
---
So what do you do with the coin on turn 1 against this deck?
---
I was going to do that, thanks for letting me know it doesn't work!
---
You cant get bounce effects
---
its not available on iOS
---
Turn 2.  Zephyrs-Shadowstep, repeat until you have 7 Zephyrs on board and a free one in hand.  Then you play the free one on turn 3 for savage roar to win the game.
---
blizzard is now not legally allowed to use these suggestions.
---
Unfortunately, no. But if you want to retract your submission and send in a new one, you are welcome to do so.
---
There is no confirmation message.
---
Update - out of my last 10 games I have played 8 quest Shaman. What the fuck.
---
Omg its such a wonderful experience to be the gatekeeper! I did that a lot but once every full moon I try extra hard to win then the moment I get lethal I will waste all possible moves then conceding.
---
The mistake won't even be acknowledged, there's zero chance of free stuff
---
https://ibb.co/LRhdNgf
---
Works for me
---
yogg saron goes ham must see
---
Are you sure you're searching in "All Cards" rather than "Standard Cards"? All of the secrets are from Kobolds and Catacombs.
---
Are you searching in standard? There are no rouge secrets in standard right now, so that might be your issue.
---
I would be pissed off is someone gave me a free win to rank up. Would make hitting a level feel pretty bad
---
turns out rogue doesn't have any secrets right now which confuses me, my friend played thief rogue with me and had, like all secrets??
---
Spear is far from the one of the best cards hunter has. It‚Äôs good, but clearly gets outclassed by other cards, such as eagle horn bow.
---
Marked shot is a consideration for midrange, but most lists don‚Äôt run it.
---
The best version of midrange rn is hybrid hunter, and there‚Äôs no way you could fit those inclusions with Subject 9, Hyena Alphas and secrets.
---
Would this prevent the opponent from  targeting their own minions and face (like, they can‚Äôt buff their own minions)
---
you can order 1 piece, the option is below
---
I really wish people would look for other posts about it
---
Why would they HoF Divine Spirit instead of Inner Fire? By itself DS is the better card and has more potential though i wouldnt imagine either seeing much play alone.
---
Either he played secrets from other classes because it‚Äôs thief rogue, or you were playing a wild duel
---
I also had this experience once before, although I was playing Evenlock and my opponent only conceded about a few seconds after seeing the Genn Greymane animation.
---
Maybe because he hated zoo or Cubelock, but was fine with Evenlock
---
Rogue has only ever had 3 secrets. Thief Rogue would steal secrets from other classes.
---
I apparently have a lot to learn, thanks!
---
okay, I must admit I never thought I should do it at 5, good heads up!
---
What a perfect way to "spread the love"
---
on Reddit!
---
I think mdonais in his recent stream said they aren't doing any buffs this expansion.
---
Wow classic has crushed HS
---
Climbed from 10-5, 63% wr since yesterday with this  list that u/dekkster used on his stream not long ago.   Play control, survive until turn 5 and your odds of winning improve drastically. Survive until 9, drop one of your big spells and its basically gg even if your opponent thinks they can still somehow pull it off.   Good luck.
