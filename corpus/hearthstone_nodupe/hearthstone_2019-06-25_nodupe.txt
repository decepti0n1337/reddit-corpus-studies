Thats true but if you have a full board why would you doomsayer it in the first place
---
You also forgot the strongest of all, Nozdormu.
---
Bronze herald for pally and Marsh Drake, the 5/4 that spawns a 2/1 poison for your opponent.
---
It's a faerie dragon, just looks weird because of the angle.
---
Rip shadows, stranding further away from wow lore
---
Spell anomoly. Goggles, double battlecry, quest, sound the bells until quest is complete. Play super galv on 3 into this mess.
---
Or “buff” the males please?
---
There's plenty of shadowy cards in priest. Hell mind blast is an actual spell in the game hearthstone is based off of. It doesn't make any sense to me to remove a card from a class that is not doing good right now.
---
hmm okay, probably dust my non-goldens. Can't argue with a bit of free dust.
---
I disagree entirely. WoW priests have normal cleric style gameplay and shadow/evil-cleric style gameplay. Mind blast was very much in line with priests identity.
---
It gets even better with Luna's Galaxy.
---
Not a druid ability in WoW
---
I might be wrong about this, but I think Paletress was supposed to represent Chastity while Sally represented Lust. Which is why she didn't get pants. Yes, Paletress already has art but make no mistake, they can change it.
---
Is isn’t too powerful, but blizz hates priest apparently
---
We've been playing around Brawl in the same way for 5 years, it's getting tiresome. How you play around Mass Hysteria or Dragonfire Potion is different and I think it's a positive that we have to think about things differently each year rather than playing the same game.
---
Honestly, if you want to be established Murloc or Minion Swarm decks.
---
you cannot help but create minion generation card or something.
---
I cannot believe you guys put minion swarm as a weakness for warrior when In fact they’re one of the strongest class if not the strongest with dealing with it. How the hell are you guys going to remove mind blast when Priest is barely even in the game right now but you don’t nerf or hanger warrior a bit. They have warpath Brawl Super collider Dr Boom buffs the mechs that already are good at removing minions with the one treat deals 5 damage separately to non mechs and omega devastator for big mechs. I don’t even want to get started on shamans weakness not actually being their weakness either.
---
5 cards creating 7 minions. Such a swarm class.
---
_Priest strengths: "Narrow but powerful spells"_  
---
_Forbidden Words, would like to have a_ word _with you._
---
I like them
---
&gt; Oversexualizing women **makes me jealous of them**
---
FTFY
---
Discover isn't a keyword in classic or basic sets though
---
It does what Mindblast does. Mindblast is being replaced by Radiance in the Basic set. It's a joke.
---
She's a lot better than KT. But then again KT was absolute trash. I think this will see play in Warrior because of the rush, but not much more.
---
Yeah you're right, I guess faerie dragons are just a little derpy
---
Yeah sure and just ignore the first part of what he said. Also, I guess hunter is good at card draw since starving buzzard is a strong card draw engine.
---
Sadly :[
---
I really just wish it could be something original or unique, but maybe basic/classic cards shouldn’t be that.
---
When the newspost came out I kept reading "died this turn" as "died this game" on this card and was so confused why people weren't freaking out. This makes a lot more sense.
---
Problem is choose one is Druid only
---
This is revisionist history
---
Let's be real Mind Blast was only ever run in unfun to play against combo decks that rely on constantly resummoning velen and maly until you run out of answers and then double MBing your face for 40+
---
Jaraxxus is fine, as are most of the DKs (Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Shaman, Druid, Priest, and Rogue)
---
Healing is a weak mechanic in all card games without proper tools to benefit from it. A win at 1 hp and a win at 30 make no difference.
---
they already tried that with shadowreaper anduin
---
Being against something doesn't mean I have personal feelings about it. You're trying to find something where there isn't.
---
Oh don't worry, I was a victim. Awful times those were.
---
Taunt is the push there I think. You get value equal to Mark of the Wild (Better, as it costs 1 card over 4) with 4 minions, and that can delay face damage. Will work fine in Treant druid I imagine, possibly as a niche pick for midrangey token druids.
---
She's actually playable in Hots.
---
Do you find the pixels in the orginal post "hyper-sexualized"?
---
Serious question.
---
A picture is worth a thousand words, so screenshots are actually very high-effort content. /s
---
yeah she i literaly famous only for her sexy look, they just butchered her, other character could have been a better option
---
If your board clear is situational, you don't have a board clear at all. You people should've learned that after years of FoUr MaNa FlAmEsTrIkE.
---
shadowreaper had nothing to do with shadowform really and was just a straight up better version of it in voidform he had.
---
I wouldnt call anduin shadowform support whne only intreaction he has with it is making his hero power worse
---
My comment was specifically referring to interaction with Ysera...so I don't know why you felt the need to say that.
---
Khadgar is coming for us.
---
I do love sandwiches
---
I see...
---
I saw this and knew I'm probably not returning to Standard at all. Holy shit I expected a bad card for priest but not that bad.
---
the audiences has nothing to do with it, both are constantly updating TCGs that from time to time update their archetypes as the game evolves
---
Sinister strike has seen play in maly rogue decks and war song commander was initially strong enough to warrant a nerf
---
Doesn't have to be.
---
People like you are the reason I have to sit through twenty minute games where an opponent gets 90% through the rope ***every, single, turn***, because you're *literally not paying attention.*
---
Mobile or not, you deserve nothing. I will offer a counter-suggestion, which is that they should add a function that insta-bans people that 'multitask' while playing hearthstone.
---
post it to r/hearthstonecirclejerk for easy karma
---
HoF auchenai
---
and only good mana generation is jade blossom. Wild growth,nourish havent seen since nerfs .
---
I guess I'm a glutton for punishment but its my understand that this was an outline for future content updates. Which is why they say in the beginning of the article that its an outline for content updates. And it wasn't a reflection of the classes as they stand.
---
Give all minions stealth would be funny. Or give enemy minions stealth?
---
Would allow you to get past taunts for a turn.
---
That is definitely possible. It's just extremely frustrating that priest is in such a terrible position right now and this only makes it worse. My feelings are that if priest doesn't see some love in the next expac then there's simply no reason for me to keep playing.
---
I mean not really. Power shield is a single card buff which is a priest strength, shield block is armor gain and 1 draw which is strength and limitation because it’s still a 3 mana draw 1 And battle rage is situational so I would call that a limitation as well.  
---
I think they have this vision of how the game should be and they’re slowly trying to make that a reality. It’s gonna take some to get it to where they want to be. this is just the very very beginning.
---
I didn't read everything but this post seemed more focused on classic and basic set. In that context, this is absolutely true.
---
If the nerfs affect cards and decks that are relevant in the current meta, how are they pointless?
---
Looking for someone on NA Festive#11936
---
what did you mean then?
---
the blackrockmountain centred dragondecks where midrange-tempo decks but since their rotaion dragon has become a lategameish-strategy.
---
Right. It still feels very bad, and knowing blizzards track record, it's only going to get worse.
---
okay. just wait when it comes out.
---
I think after a major announcement like this, somebody from Dev team should do a proper Q&amp;A session either here on reddit or on the stream. 
---
I think it's fantastic that we're getting so many changes and so much insight at such a rapid pace, and I would hate it if the general perception of it was negative because reddit is being reddit.
---
Shit it’s not massive? He literally clears the entire enemy board of void lords + cubes with void lords inside of them in one card. How is that not a massive killing?
---
I totally get why they make replacement Basic/Classic cards pretty weak on average, but hooooooly shit this seems just unnecessarily terrible. One of the worst cards in the entire game.
---
Card games usually lean more into sums and differences than products and fractions.
---
In the case of Naturalize, you are trading one-for-one on the board while letting your opponent dig deeper for answers to whatever play you're about to make. While a larger hand may already mean they have it, it would also mean they are more likely to draw whatever answer they may be looking for assuming they've already been drawing cards beyond the one they get a turn.
---
Dorothy is on board, I have no idea why she didn't play it. She had lethal if she played it; I have lethal if she didn't. And she didn't—free win.
---
So does this mean they will only be obtainable through crafting?
---
Please, try to take a worse picture next time. Just stay away from that dreadful PrtSc button.
---
You are thinking in terms of how Priest exists right now whereas Blizzard is thinking in terms of how Priest will look after the next two expansions drop. We all know Priest gets more powerful later on in the year; healing 5 for 1 might have some crazy synergies in six months that we simply can't know about yet.
---
I don't know if this feels legendary to me, but it's a 3/2 for 3 that generates a card, so it's a pretty damn good card. I won't craft it, because fuck it, it's a classic legendary, I'll open it soon enough. And depending on how they dilute the legendary pool, it might not be amazing. But it's good.
---
Yeah I think the moral of the story here is Blizzard moving forward is aiming for more class identity. Clearly starting with basic/ classic with these new cards.
---
probably since that had all the early dragons eh?
---
I can *only* generate self synergistic tribal minions and the main thing that is not minions. Woe is me.
---
I think you're ignoring the track record of priest being the class that typically gets shit on. It's a meme for a reason.
---
No 
---
\- Team 5
---
Personally i have never beat off to a hearthstone card, so I don't see women in more functional armor to be some huge issue that warrants a complaint thread.
---
Get that fun and creative shit out of here.
---
Next rogue set will be entirely "steal a card from your opponents class" and poison.
---
Congrats brother, that's super rad! What a rad dad you are. Kudos!
---
Vanish was never a problem or at least in recent metas. In fact one could argue that it's the worst board clear of the classic set and it's barely played at all. The only deck that uses vanish is that meme tier tesspionage deck and it isn't even an auto include. 
---
You've only play been playing hearthstone for two months so you're just as good as those idiots employed at team 5 when it comes to analyzing card strengths.
---
[[Excavated Evil]]
---
As someone who has vehemently hated Priests since the game came out, I have to defend you. Mind Blast is a quintessential card for the class. Now, do I ever want to see another combo deck OTK me with a bunch of Velen BS again? No. I don't. But Mind Blast can stay.
---
I dunno... like, if we look at it from the Classic Set standpoint, then it's also saying that Shaman doesn't get card draw despite things like Mana Tide Totem and Far Sight. Whether we're looking at "things Shaman got from expansion" or "things Shaman got originally", the layout of a shaman's strengths and weaknesses is just... wrong.
---
Too bad the effect does not fit with Brightwings flair much. It is still cool though and i hope that she has some really creepy murder vibes on her summon voice line. (brightwing is brutal, try playing her in HotS)

Cute. I main her in HoTS. Gonna try and make a Dragon deck with whatever I have. don't really play Ranked so don't care if it's meta.
---
The Battlecry is boring but someone said it can be explained by BW bringing you *a friend*. Which is totally in line with her personality. I hope she gets good voicelines too.
---
It would look pretty weird for Priest to have 2 board clears in the basic set.
---
"This will only hurt until you die"
---
"You sure are good at murder"
---
Hecc no. This is the pinnacle of quality
---
Yep. Given their new description it seems the focus will be on buffs, situational spells(whatever this entails??) and copying stuff. That's doesn't really sounds very control at all. Those are generally midrange/tempo tools
---
But then they also say "priests should control the game through..."
---
What? It's like someone getting a picture of a stealthed saint minion
---
That's just standard. Murloc quest is massive card generation, and most of these work with Shutterwock.
---
Manatide Totem comes in and out of formats, which is exactly what Classic and Basic cards should do.
---
Far Sight, up until recently, never saw any play. Only now has it been decent. Sense Demons is actually a key card in many Wild Warlock decks since it can fine Voidcaller and a Voidlord or Mal'Ganis to summon off of it, and I believe there have been more periods of time where Thoughtsteal has seen play than Far Sight.
---
I knew as soon as I read that article that this sub was gonna try to lawyer Blizz on every word.  
---
  
---
Swaggy P!
---
wait is this official?
---
HS has abysmal variance because instead of mana colors or any kind of resource that allows to mix them, you can only play your class + neutral. once you take away the trash cards that are so bad they can't fit in any archetype, there's not much left.
---
I’d say that fits the definition of limitations. It’s a deck, but not the big archetype of the class. The class can do it sort of uniquely but it’s not especially strong. Mage uses a lot of setup for that Combo and it has very little support for it. It can do it at a big cost, that feels like a limitation. And the paladin deck feels different. It’s not a burn deck by any means, it’s OTK. Big difference. Also, I’m pretty sure they’re also talking about hammer of wrath versus frost bolt, fireball, and eviscerate. A much weaker level of direct damage, which is pretty much their only example of direct damage from spells. You wouldn’t compare The OTK deck to tempo mage.
---
That's a neutral card
---
Madum Lazul doesn't see play cause priest doesn't play, I have it in my decks and its a fair card
---
Card back images are client side. You'd have to hack into their phone and change the card back assets in order to do what he is saying. So you're either a technomancer or he is an idiot
---
They wouldn't give you a usable card, they'd give you Shadow Visions but it costs 8 mana and draws the spell and the spell costs 3 more mana than it cost before.
---
A lot better at 7 mana than 5 though. And it probably won’t be played because the low rolls.
---
They also said that one of warrior's weaknesses is minion swarm. Because brawl doesn't exist.
---
To teach their own I guess. I would rather poop in my hands and clap than play HotS.
---
I played a Priest Quest deck that generated a dozen-ish Amara's and could still lose.
---
Face healing just isnt that powerful in Hearthstone. Board state is far more valuable than even a full heal.
---
This is insane.  I haven't even finished reading, but as I was going through the different strength's, limitations and weaknesses I literally said to myself - Rogue's weakness is board clear, but they have Vanish.  Priest's weakness is face damage spells, but they have Mind Blast.  And the first thing I see after that, both of those spells will be removed.  Sick haha.
---
At least cover those male nipples with female ones.
---
What track record? You mean the track record that has existed for maybe one rotation post lich king? Shadow priest strong, divine favor strong, dragon priest strong, kazakus strong, lightbomb, Barnes resurrect.
---
Memes: silence and this. Oh noooo
---
There are definitely more fat/skinny male characters in fantasy media than remotely unattractive women. Witches sometimes, the occasional monsterous female, but be honest with yourself. Hot chicks as a demographic are way over-represented.
---
keep supporting censorship all you want until some day it hits you back
---
There are ways to discount mechs easily both in standard and wild.
---
Literally reading what they wrote is now "absurd extremes".  
---
Forever the blizzard apologist showing his true colors yet again. :)
---
Prolly not something you wanna share publicly
---
You keep using the word censorship unironically. That's adorable, honestly. It's pretty much like saying "black car" is racism. It's not, but that's cute.
---
Shouldn’t it be cubed? Since three games the same not two ?
---
It’s a really long story but trust me it works out
---
It has been, especially for control for quite a while, and the only reason its not at the top rn is simply cause the meta shifted to be more aggressive, with rogue one top, it by far has the best control options though, even beating priest
---
Where did they say that these definitions dictated the design of Boomsday cards?
---
Im done. This is absolute horseshit.
---
Removing Mindblast? Really? 
---
YOU HAVE 9 classes.  Zeroing in on effects 'core' to these classes now is such rubbish.
---
Look at any tier list, warlock is tier 2-3
---
I dont think any replacement theyve ever printed have seen any real amounts of play in any competitive scope, and I'd go ahead and bet all but maybe 1 of these will not as well
---
&gt;They've failed to understand that playstyle doesn't equal identity. Flooding the board is a zoo playstyle not a class identity. Mana ramping a la druid is a class identity.
---
Couldn't have put it better myself.
---
you can pretend all you want about being progressive but you cant fool yourself, this kind of concerns really shows of similar sjw are to the church people, always offended, cant laugh because its ofensice, cant see anything pretty because its pretty, so yeah keep making a more miserable world will you try to look like the cool kid
---
Fair point re: Rexxar, forgot about him. That's one of the most OP cards ever printed, though, even compared to the other DKs, and Blizzard has made it clear that they think printing such powerful Hero cards was a mistake. So, according to Blizzard, Hagatha SHOULD be worse than the DKs, not because Shaman is supposed to be bad at card generation but because Blizzard decided Hero cards for all classes should be less powerful moving forward.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dr. Boom might be better overall, but it's definitely not better at generating cards. It generates one card every few turns. Sure, Hagatha requires input in the form of minions, but it's not like that requirement is at all hard to meet. Hagatha generates a lot more cards on average than Boom, and a lot more of its overall strength as a card comes from card generation.
---
Valeera is a debatable case. It's very different from most forms of card generation, in that it's mostly about being able to duplicate specific cards in your deck to play them more than twice as opposed to just generating more value in general. And without consulting HSReplay stats, I feel like Hagatha is played at a much higher rate in Shaman now than Valeera was in Rogue.  
---
Jaina's effect isn't card generation. We seem to be veering from whether Hagatha is consistent with the idea of Shaman being bad at card generation to just comparing relative strengths of Hero cards.
---
Mad genius is overpowered, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the one really average hero power it has. Dr boom is overpowered because of how strong rush is. So no, it does not violate generation.
---
And omega assembly requires turn 10, and is three random mechs. Not that overpowered and well within the context of limited. It is again, Dr booms rush component that makes mechs so bloody powerful.
---
This is the hearthstone subreddit, where 90% of the posts are people blindly bitching and complaining about things so that's fine. But at the very least make sure you actually know what your talking about first.
---
Alright then just tell me what percentage is 3.5/1 because in basic knowledge that’s 350%.
---
[Here I am scrolling by and I’m like “ass identity?!”](https://i.imgur.com/39jn2a7.jpg)
---
maybe on wild?, if your hand is full and you get a bunch of shudders bounced back they all die, if you happen to get lucky with rng then ideally this goes off after that happens and you retain your board full of wocks if thats what youre going for, but i believe (i dont play shaman) there are wayy better strategies/combos with shudderwock
---
Don't even bother with this /u/esteman93 snowflake, honestly. He's extremely unintelligent and genuinely believes mild "censorship" = oppression.
---
Meanwhile, actual women in the world have to deal with actual oppression, but I guess the *real* issue here is some pixels in a video game.
---
Probably some 14-year-old failing school and shitposting on Reddit about how much he hates women.
---
He opened from different sets. Pity timer is 40, average is 20 per set. The wild bundle was 8 packs per set (totaling 56) and is entirely possible to not get a legendary.
---
remind of the old christians in early 2000, more similar each day
---
Where did they say they didn't? You're literally talking in circles now as opposed to just answering the question I asked previously
---
&gt;So then since the release of RoS they suddenly decided to completely change their identity concepts or just never really cared about them before then?  
---
You somehow think Warrior is the only class that doesn't fit their design criteria?  Maybe take a read impartially (i.e. take off those blizzard sponsored shill glasses) of what they wrote and come back later. :)
---
I'm an atheist and have been for all my life. Try again, snowflake.
---
This feels like very low effort design.
---
Except when people can’t count. “THIS WILL BE A SEVEN MANA CONSECRATION!”
---
Noo... I don't play the game that often but it sucks that they're removing mind-blast from classic
---
Homie. I'm not offended. I don't give a shit about the card art. I didn't make this post. You are the one offended about a bitch wearing pants. Quit trying to argue with me like I'm some strawman SJW. I know you don't speak English well, but you can't honestly be that stupid. If covering up a video game characters legs with some armor makes your world more miserable, I can't even imagine how sad every day is for you.
---
Wow. 1,459 Arena wins and still no Lightforge Key?
---
https://i.imgur.com/4BZpQEP.jpg
---
pretend all you want
---
It literally allows infinite generation in a class that apparently has limitation as one of it's limitation.  Infinite generation is NOT "very limited in power level".
---
If generation is it's limitation then that aspect of the hero power should never have been added.  
---
Thus they contradict themselves.
---
About the fact that I've been an atheist for longer than you've been alive? Lmao. Why would I lie about that?
---
Idiot.
---
The number of total cards is besides the point of their power level. It's not a class strength if you have a lot of a bad-to-mediocre thing.
---
Hell he’s a 6 mana 7/4 with a crappy joust effect, he’s basically a worse Anub’arak.
---
For one thing, EE kind of was a fringe play kind of card. For another, putting a solid aoe of some kind in the Priest core set a couple years ago would've done so, so much to mitigate the power of the much-hated Big Priest deck in Wild.
---
If they're going to open the floodgates to the complaints of only one class getting cards from Wild added to Standard, they'd better actually fix some of the problems with the core set.
---
Nah, make it a 4 mana 7/7 minion.
---
Wait that’s too strong.
---
Maybe add overload 2 to it and put it in Shaman.
---
This game is also f2p friendly, so make it a common.
---
That’s better, don’t you think?
---
Icehowl actually was a decent card for control decks back in the day. Big removal that keeps removing stuff.
---
Skeleton Knight... was pretty bad. It saw some little play in control decks to cheat out value (since crazy value generation didn't exist back them) control matches were decided by who had 1 more value card
---
Out of the 25 deathrattle cards Rogue has had, 16 of them saw a significant amount of play.
---
You just defended the best card draw card in the game as an example of a perfect card for a class that just lost draw because they didn’t want draw to be a class strength. 
---
All because you seem to think expansions don’t have to play by class identity rules the way evergreen does. 
---
I think I’ve seen enough
---
"So for priest we think their new identity should be fuck yourself."
---
Interesting. Super good Arena card for sure. I'm torn on Standard. It's like KT and that Hunter Spell. I'm not sure how good this'll be, definitely a massive value swing.
---
Blizzard, please remove Prophet Velen instead of Mind Blast. 
---
What’s the point of his effect then, If priest Burn spells are ineffective? 
---
HoF Velen, new Mind Blast, and give Priest a new Classic Legendary by the next expansion.
---
Just let me get my time machine...
---
It's not even the same "they" from years ago. It's an entirely different lead direction, team, tech, etc. So yes. We're the slow ones since people think the people making the game are an unchanging hivemind.
---
Maybe if these stupid fucking devs concentrated on making the game less boring instead of making sorry ass bitch made cards they would get some respect but all they deserve is to be laughed at and slapped like the fucking bitches they are for releasing garbage like this. Too bad I can’t slap the Lilly limp wrists myself
---
&gt; I do not care if they are "very limited in power"  
---
That's on you though and that's not the question I asked nor is it the issue I took with the article.  
---
If that's what they wrote then that's what design should adhere to.  
---
&gt;Because I am willing to give Team 5 the benifit of the doubt and interpret their statement in a more fair way than you want to  
---
Right so you are one of those people that when people literally quote things to show them they are wrong you want to apply your own logic to it?  
---
That's fine, you can do that, you can say whatever you like about how many draw cards or however they are and how fair it is.  
---
The fact of the matter is though ... I don't really care what YOU think.  I'm pointing out the inconsistency of Blizzard, not what /u/SoupAndSalad911 thinks is fair.   
---
We can have an entire new discussion about that if you like but that is not the scope of this topic.  
---
&gt;Rules in card design are made to eventually be broken, and for every broken mess, there is at least one true triumph is design because they allowed themselves to go beyond what was considered okay yesterday.   
---
Yet HoF cards that are far seemingly less of a problem to the philosophy they just told us about than some other cards in the game just reads like amateur hour.
---
I just wanted to note that these are quite literally the only 3 mana dragons in the entire game (not counting analgam, of course). I mainly play wild and looked it up because it seemed crazy when I first read it, but it’s true.
---
Should be Carlos Larkin, he does a lot of voices for Warcraft characters.
---
All kidding aside, I decided to google Malf to see what armor he could potentially wear to cover up because I don't recall ever seeing him in any (WoW night elf main for ~11 years). I can't find a single image of him wearing any armor. I see one or two where he has full night elf robes on, but none with armor. All I know is that I would cover my vital organs if I planned on fighting in any war, let alone multiple. Hard to believe we can't also see his balls hanging out given how big they have to be.
---
I’m in favor of changing up the classic set and HOFing cards to keep things fresh, but Mind Blast and Vanish? Now? Yeah, vanish sees play in some pogo decks, but it’s hardly oppressive. And Priest is absolutely no place on the standard ladder. Compare to last year when Maly Priest was everywhere. I just don’t get it.
---
Looks like a frog
---
Let me adjust the cost of that 10 mana card you had reduced to 0 at the tavern to 10 for you.
---
These goals seem very contradictory. Shamans will be great at swarming the board but your card draw/generation is bad. Like so we basically lose if we don’t OTK the opponent?
---
Ehh. Consider though that she’d likely ressurect the mechs without magnetic effects.
---
Yoooo good job man. I'm the same situation.

When I first saw it I thought it was from that sub. It's perfect for it. Good luck!

"a great Mage **conjures** the right tool when they need it"
---
im playing priest only since beta and i’m beat mage 4 times in a row with my deathrattle cloning gallery deck just today
---
So just get the passive that shuffles 3 1-cost copies of every minion you play into your deck as well as the passive that draws 2 extra cards every turn.  
---
What even are the odds of being offered both of these, combined with the odds of being offered the former before the latter? 
---
I haven't taken the shuffle 3 1-cost copies one yet because I figure it's a death sentence more often than  not as you'll end up drawing 10+ early game minions which you can't play without guaranteeing you'll draw them 3 more times. 
---
Once you start playing late game minions it's crazy good, but it seems too risky.
---
i hate this
---
The main disadvantage over KT is you can't cheat this out as effectively.

Brightwing is adorable support in the Nexus of HotS. Brightwing has friends! Brightwing calls friends for aid! Brightwing and her friends will all viciously murder you&lt;3
---
Lol "aggro is boring" is not an unpopular opinion.
---
&gt;Are buff cards a poor design in general for you? 
---
No.
---
&gt;Is the mana cost a poor design choice? 
---
Yes.
---
&gt;Is Druid not allowed to have an expensive buff card that could support future archetypes?
---
In the Classic/Basic Set?  Not allowed, yes.  It already has wide board support.
---
If it were 6 mana and +1/+1, it would still be bad, but at least it would make sense as a card.  You could play it after your Force of Nature to stop face decks that don't want to interact with your tokens.  At 8 mana it does not have that purpose.  Its purpose is as a redundant Savage Roar, but, like I said, it grants Taunt which is at odds with a finisher card.
---
Brightwing isn't tempo-oriented, it is a weak tempo play.  It is a weak card overall.  But the design is coherent, and it has a niche where it provides something that would otherwise be lacking from Classic.  And it's not overcosted to the degree that it would *never* see play, it is costed such that it will only see play in decks where it makes sense, which is good.
---
Like I said, it's not supposed to be a good card. But it is better than 1 mana do nothing. At least Mind Sear can trade one for one for another card.
---
Better than the Blizzard summary, but for Warrior, Priest, and Hunter, I would add that their hero powers limit them a lot. Unlike other hero powers, they don't interact with the board at all. It's part of why Warrior and Priest struggle in Arena - their hero powers can't generate tempo.
---
Welcome to big priest mentally. Theres a reason the deck almost always loses if they dont play barnes by turn 5
---
It was diferent sets.
---
I disagree it is powerful but I think this fits with their ideology that you get a bunch of Classic cards and start "upgrading" your decks with better versions of the cards as you go on.  It is kind of a wonky choice given Priests Classic set problems.
---
Lmaoooo very fair point. Nevertheless I think dragon decks will like this as a one-of for curve, likely not all dragon decks but I'm working on a dragon paladin that would really like this because I literally only have amalgam on 3 plus the shennanegans that are likely to occur will be wild. I know it won't be the strongest addition to my deck but dragon speaker doesn't care about stats. Only dragons.
---
LIterally is no reason to compare a class card to a basic set card. 
---
The main reason it is weak, is it's a baseline for stats and it doesn't rotate. 
---
And besides that there is no reason to buff it, unless you buff stats for a lot of basic cards.
---
Honestly even in arena this card sucks. it's literally only the dragon tag that makes this a viable pick in my book but I'll have fun with it I'm sure
---
The new cards are in the *Basic* set, not even Classic, so you can't expect something incredible.

Or because poetry is a completely different beast from prose?
---
To elaborate on the first one, on your turn your weapon is “unsheathed” and your attack damage is present. On your opponents turn your weapon is “sheathed” and the weapon is covered and no damage is visible. 
---
It’s a bit unintuitive but while you have a weapon equipped you always have combat damage on your turn, even if it’s your own minions attacking your face.
---
What would your core cards be then? Or even your entire decklist?
---
We are 1 million on this Subredit, that means 1 million (around) of people who plays the game, and some of the people in here know the game even better than the developers themselves, just take Shudderwock or Snip Snap/Reckless experimenter case as example, you can't deny that sometimes Blizzard's decisions lack of meaning, Imagine a game where comunity's feedback is totally ignored.

F this i want a darkk mane with a battlecry to instantly summon the ancient one
---
With vanish out the picture control rogue is an ever increasingly impossible control deck.
---
Literally how are you meant to use their legendaries like togwaggle if you have no clears or healing? If it's by tempo easier to just make the deck around that and ignore the legendary card
---
A spell that provides nearly the same effect at nearly half the cost was good when INSANE synergy was printed for it, synergy so good that it had to be rotated to Wild a year early (which has never happened before for any other card).  Level Up saw absolute nil play after it was nerfed out of Odd Pally to cost 1 more mana.  And this card costs 2 mana more than that.
---
Sure, but the odds of a low budget player opening any specific legendary are absolutely miniscule. I just don't think the "fun for low budget players" argument can apply to a legendary unless it's part of an adventure (rip) or given away for free.
---
Shaman has always got the shaft with identity.
---
I mean they've now permanently put us in with murlocs for fuck sale. Yeah a couple expansions having these cards is cool but I don't want shaman to forever more be the class that plays murlocs and bloodlust
---
We also had Aluneth Murloc Mage but that deck was a meme
---
Sand.
---
They're going to hall of fame those cards? Really? They havent been good in years
---
My point is that the dust isn’t wasted. There’s still a place to play them even if they aren’t as strong as they used to be.
---
I think 60/40 is probably fair.
---
Or its the ultimate counter to a spell damage mage

The majority of hearthstone players,( blizzard players in general, especially classic wow players) always find something to complain about. They just like to make long posts on reddit to look like they are smart but in most of the cases they are just wrong. As Asmongold ( a wow streamer) once said: If blizzard gave people gold, they would complain that it is too heavy.
---
Cerebral Combustion
---
why don't the uncraftable basic cards just upgrade to golden?
---
I agree, but different games face different challenges. 
---
And jeff is just a very great example and beloved by the community. 
---
Both games are made by blizzard, but in hearthstone everyone thinks they are a qualified game designer as it's "just cards". 
---
I agree i would love more communication, 
---
But remember how much they got memed o  when nerfing firey war axe? That was the first time they really extensively opened up after a long while, and the player feedback really hampered that project.
---
The game is a company and they have to make decisions that are good for their brand. 
---
And in the current climate they are probably not sure if it is a good decision thats why they are so hesitant. 
---
(I assure you they would love to talk openly about all of their insight, it is not for a lack of trying/attention to the community or lazyness. They are just worried about the outcome. 
---
And to be honest, i kind of get it.)
---
I see your point though,

Have a good day.

3/1/5 Mech | Magnetic Taunt  
---
"It is fine for this card to be a little bit stro g because it is a Druid card!" - Trump in a certain card review 2018
---
P/S: It is fine. One is a classic one is an expansion. Also 2 classes a different so the power of the same text on each class also different: 5 armor on Rogue is less meaningful than 5 armor on Warrior.
---
Brawl is a hell of a lot stronger than ee. Which is my point. 
---
Ee may be good or not depending on the meta. Even when it's good, it's rarely going to be great. Flamestrike is the same, not every mage deck wants it, not even every control mage wants it. It's good sometimes, but even then it's not meta warpingly good. 
---
But brawl is one of the defining cards of the control warrior archetype. It shapes the entire way that deck plays, and how people play against it. Comparing it to ee  doesn't give a good indication of how a meta where ee is evergreen would look.
---
and their pirate support isnt even that good. Like cursed castaway its slow as hell for pirate deck,hooktusk never gonna see play in full on pirate deck at 8mana and msot likly pulling small minions. Cannon barrage can be huge dmg but at 6mana you likly lost yout board already adn with prenerf now even after a hooktusk + coin you cant play it anymore. Coldblood aslo nerfed,draw with radiing party aslo nerfed double due prep aswell.
---
I played mill rogue from 25 to 6 two months ago. Over 60% of my games were against big priest past about rank 20. There might be a lot of decks in wild, but there’s only one people really play
---
At least Blizzard stays consistent: Always give Priest a punch in the guts when they are already down. I guess they didn't learn anything from the Purify fiasco.
---
Pandas are pretty unexplored in HS.  There's a couple brewmaster cards, but theres not really any Pandarian cards.
---
I honestly just like the fact that they keep changing it up, refreshes gameplay and strategies which is great.. I still would've preferred Inner Fire into Hall of Fame rather. It feels like I've lost more games to that instead of a Mind Blast Velen combo. 
---
IMO.
---
Maybe those were overcosted?
---
i feel like blizzard has absolutley no clue wtf they're talking about.
---
Because it would see play in Nomi Priest, then. And the card is designed specifically for new players who can experience finding a better card to replace it with.
---
(Despite sounding sarcastic, I'm fine with that.)
---
&gt; It's just sad any criticism is apparently viewed as a bad thing,
---
And it's silly shit like this that makes /r/hearthstone awful for feedback.
---
Fantastic strawman, buddy. Thank you for helping me make my point.
---
When people write magnificently dumb shit like that, and think they have an intellectual high ground, guess what?
---
There's no arguing with it.
---
It doesn't matter if you make a giant wall of text. Bad logic is bad logic.
---
&gt; I'm not saying I agree with it but if you want a subreddit worth visiting, the usual low effort mobile phone pictures of monitors aren't that.
---
Pictures of monitors are more easily digested content that are more entertaining when they're less stupid than a wall of text.
---
But if you want to waste your time stroking your own ego thinking that you know best while reading what some random stranger on line spent far too much time babbling on about (in proportion to their actual aptitude on the topic), you also do you.
---
That's actually a good reason to have such a card in standard.
---
If you're implying it wasn't the best deck in the game, you're absolutely wrong.
---
Whenever someone states something that they can't possibly know with 100% certainty, I always assume it is an opinion.  Could the OP know for a fact that Druid was never intended to be a zoo class?  No, only the developers could know that.  So I mentally rephrase it to "I never thought zoo was intended..."
---
Whether or not it is a fact doesn't change much, you can agree or disagree with it all the same, by bringing up supporting or counter-examples, past dev quotes, etc.  Facts can change, because knowledge can change.  It is simply a statement of one example toward OP's point about the muddling of class identity.
---
&gt; which definitely pertained to the discussion.
---
Pertained to, but did not contribute to.
---
&gt; I can only assume that you downvoted me for disagreeing with your opinion.
---
Well yes it would be *your* only assumption.
---
Far sight litterally is draw 1 for 0 in the best case scenario. Also, shaman has ancestral knowledge which is a draw 2 for 3/4 (depending on how you count overload towards card advantage). Mana Tide Totem is at least a draw 1 for 3 with totem synergy.
---
Shaman also has spirit of the frog which draws you at least 4-5 cards in the right deck.
---
Shaman does not lack either card draw or card generation at the moment.
---
Omega Medic did see play where Control Priest saw play. 1 mana heal 10 would be good enough to see play as well.
---
The idea is to argue with it. That's the point.
---
And please stop referring to me as your friend, I don't know you...
---
Didn’t they mention card draw for shaman or something haha. Beautiful.

There was a story 3 years ago about a 4 mana mech that summons doomsayer when it dies.
---
Is it?
---
Just because it's a litter picker's job to, well, pick up litter, doesn't mean people should just do it willy-nilly.
---
The same for providing feedback. Yeah it's their job to receive it. That doesn't excuse the rampant whining and bullshittery that dilutes the feedback, however.
---
Extra funny since Brode admitted that the timing of Purify was a mistake and that they should not give 'bad' cards to a struggling class at that moment...
---
I guess that wisdom left the company as well.
---
Underbelly Angler is so much fun to play though. Let it be known I am not advocating Murloc Shaman, as much fun as it is.
---
You weren't already playing Scheme and Hex in Control Shaman? What part of it was control then?
---
But Mage is a control counter. That won't change. However you shouldn't be doing as abysmal as you're doing now. Without gameplay, it's hard to tell where you're going wrong.
---
Lackey Rogue??? Last time I checked, those are the cards that make that deck work.
---
My apologies, stranger.
---
&gt; The idea is to argue with it. That's the point.
---
People who put that much effort trying to look right while being wrong are not why I come to forums.
---
People who express an actual degree of open-mindedness are ones I'd be happy to get into the nitty gritty details of my disagreement with them with.
---
Wish newbies were irrelevant :-) your story does not matter !!!
---
I have quest SirGooch#11949
---
Nice theory, but netfecking prevents this from being reality.  Every class is predictable.
---
I loved them more too, but it's different for every person. I would love to see at least one being released every year as they still need to change the adventure style time to time. I would also love a special events where you would go back to older adventures to complete a weekly quests or something like that and that wing or adventure would be free if you don't have it, but you couldn't get any cards or bonuses that advenure has as a normal reward.
---
So instead they made something much worse
---
Your hyperbolic rage is irrelevant, it's not an opinion.
---
If Purify was in standard it would be played in silence priest,  it's a good enabler for the archetype.
---
Just delete the first better and it's fine...
---
And it's not that hard to understand so not your fault.
---
&gt;To be fair, its still something druids have way better than other classes
---
Yes just like discard is warlock strenght and shaman is one of the top class for freeze effect
---
RNG makes your average drooling player smile, add the WOAH LEGENDARY to it and they drool and smile more!
---
Try to logout from the app store, login and try again. Let me know if it helped.
---
That being said if you open those exact same packs over again in similar sequence you will very likely get at least 10 legendaries in those 80 something packs.
---
RANDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111
---
Surely you understand the reasons why they did it, even if you don't agree to it. Is it really that big of a deal that you need to make a whole post about it?
---
Because it's a card that anyone can use?

---
The only tournament to lock out a gender being the crowning achievement of equality in games. 
---
A good article, or at least one with even the slightest merit, would have considered positive discrimination, such as this, as well. People lash out against female esports teams, because underqualified female teams have enjoyed so much support. Also one woman player in GM's. See how she did.
---
Positive discrimination isn't helping anyone in the long term.
---
You do know you can do both, right? Cool. They nerfed some obvious problems, buffed some almost universally still unplayable cards and gave us one free legendary. I'm not sure that's anywhere near as impressive as you think (especially since it followed them rolling back the quality of preorder bundles and charging us for solo adventures they had been giving us for free), but it's fine to give them credit for that. When I give an employee an annual performance eval, I don't just throw out all the bad of the last year because they did something good three months ago.
---
Radiance gonna be the next patches the pirate, you heard it here first... 😂😂😂
---
Tbh i think this card is great in some decks that uses vargoth cuz this card cant heal minions so it will only heal you at the end of the turn.
---
&gt;force tank is pretty crap in arena actually.
---
If you need to pick a big drop, it's one of the best (after Kraken or Burly). That said, you don't really need any big drops right now. Many of the best decks can top out with 6 drops.
---
Vanish
---
Perhaps we should also change the mechanic from "Heal your hero" to "Silence a friendly minion".
---
Sally, what on earth are you wearing?! Take those pants off *immediately*
---
They could have at least made it ‘a friendly character’ if they were worried about the Auchenai synergy.
---
The post said next update, so likely quite soon
---
It only took 1 month for the animation to be over on the devs's  computer so they could started to make the nerf.

No, I forgot my /s sorry.
---
That's my fault
---
But yeah, that's 3 legendaries and 4 epics. 6400 dust. And seaforium is not necessary, I agree. If you're only playing two classes and dusting cards a lot, then it's easy to get decks quickly.
---
I don't know what you mean ;)
---
My problem isn't the power of the deck,or archetype, as it is tier1. But rather the feeling of powerlessness in the face of rng.
---
I had so damn many games where the first card I could play way a whispering woods (which I had to play, considering i was already madly losing) just to have it instantly removed.
---
So secret based decks are dead then. Goodbye 2 archetypes for hunter and paladin i guess
---
More importantly, it can put valuable battlecry minions back in your opponent's hand so that they get to use them again next turn.
---
Hunter also has DR listed while having a staggering ONE DR card in Savanah Highmane. Just admit it's full of shit, and so are you by extension
---
I was thinking more along the lines of, your post must have flair
---
Maybe a card like "This turn, whenever your hero is healed, deal as much damage to your opponent"?
---
I would like to get rid of the goldens ones since i only collect regular cards from packs
---
Until then, it’s the “one card” that’s gonna show up in every deck lol
---
Y'all thirsty af.
---
I do this every time lol. Get the deck code, click away the 4-6 golden basic cards, add the non goldens
---
Yeah okay. But that doesn't mean we shouldnt ever give hunters card draw. For example lifesteal from Scalehide is just a product of a cool interaction between hunter's set and neutral set. That doesn't mean they are strong at that by themselves.
---
Murloc raider’s basically an auto include in most murloc decks, stormpike used to be usable in ungoro budget inner fire decks, windfury’s used in that combo deck with the whirlwind elemental thing. On top of this all the class cards you mentioned were either ok enough to have seen play occasionally, or were so good that they got nerfed into the ground.
---
Although more than how powerful (or lacking in power) each of these cards are, at least they do something, it’s just they often do what they do badly. This new card does nearly almost entirely nothing, give health to your hero directly has no synergy with anything. The only thing it is, is a cheap spell which fits into cycle decks and even then it might not make the cut in something like nomi priest because it’s actually that terrible.
---
"another blizzard game". I think many people here know or play Overwatch :)
---
But thanks anyway, I follow the Overwatch Reddit too but I didn't remember that post :)
---
they could just have made it heal 6 or 7
---
While I don't mind about Mind Blast specifically, I fear the direction they announced (no face damage priest) means priest will auto-lose to any kind of freeze-mage-like strategy.
---
That's [[void ripper]]
---
Aggressively stated one drop for an aggressive deck which doesn’t have enough other one drop murlocs without it.
---
The change make sense and the classe identity too. I think they should revert nerf they made on classic/basic card that no longer made sense in today standard  
---
For example
---
Shaman : Flametongue totem (nerf because of genn)  
---
Rogue : Cold Blood (nerf because of baku)  
---
Druid : Wild growth, nourrish (nerf because of year of raven)   
---
Warrior : Fiery war axe (nerf because of patches)  
---
Possibly other like equality, ancient of lore
---
It hits your own as well, whilst not giving too many stats over say EE.
---
It's balanced and could help Priest
---
So Prophet Velen is completely useless now ? RIP.
---
i dont really like the inner fire combo, when i started to play it was a fun noob trap, but now i'm kinda sick of seeing it
---
It's this philosophy of hilariously weakening everything and streamlining classes into rigid boring archetypes that moved me to Wild.
---
On the plus side it'll save me hundreds of dollars worth of preorders. Thanks Blizzard!
---
hey, they have northshire cleric! probably close to a 100% playrate.
---
I think they're intending to do just that with this year's expansions being a sort of classic MtG-style "block" wherein they're all linked together. I expect we'll see some reuse of mechanics from this set (we already know more lackeys are coming).
---
I don't think it's a problem, it's just odd that the class who supposed to have the weakest AoE clears has more unconditional AoE in their basic set than any other class.
---
If it was drop Holy Nova for Excevated Evil I don't think there'd be an issue (Although I'd prefer to see Holy Nova buffed to playability rather than adding a new card to the basic)
---
Well Velen doesn't really create OTKs anymore since mind blast would be gone, it'd be the most niche classic legendary out of all the classes in a class that already has a weak basic and classic set.
---
I still do that sometimes just cuz I love him but most of the people just take him down with a spell or something, it always breaks my heart ahahha that and being able to get the ancient one or thaddius and either a priest stealing them from me or just destroying them with spells
---
Agreed. Card games are fun when you can explore and build outside of the initial design intent. Otherwise, it's boring (at least to me).
---
Allowing that to happen has direct implications to card "refunds", when they eventually have to balance the game.
---
However, the way Blizzard works to prevent any unforeseen innovations just leads to a stale meta after a couple of weeks.
---
Priest is designed to be annoying, the exception being dragon midrange ..
---
Paladins currently out heal priest to
---
Lackey rogue isn't the only deck that uses heistbaron. You could also play hooktusk rogue.
---
Due to deathrattle-effects he triggers. Ticking Abomination, Spider Bomb, Obsidian Statue, Kaboom Bot, etc.
---
Thanks dude, I might start doing hearthstone art, the feedback is being pretty good and especially because the art on the game is so goddamn awesome
---
I doubt it. Priest is always going to be a secondary control deck compared to Warrior, just because Warriors hero power is so much better for control decks. Unless they just print something on the level of "3 mana Twisting Nether", Priest will remain second fiddle.
---
Your thesis makes no sense. They could just have them unlocked by default for every account. The issue is them leaving standard means people will want to be refunded for them
---
Yeah it's something new they wanna implement, even tho they make it sound like it was their plan from the start
---
I'd really rather see Holy Nova buffed than EE in the basic set.
---
Maybe make it 4 Mana "deal 3 to all minions, heal 3 to all minions that survived"? Not strong against big tanky minions but great against smaller agro swarms
---
But EE is very good and the new Radiance card is gash, although it's hard to see what else it could do without just being "It's like this other Basic card but better!"
---
Uhhh does that deck fit ranked? I'm looking for a cheap deck for ranked cuz I have been out of the game so long and now all my decks are wild only and I only have 1600 dust
---
This is literally "*Ben Brode 2.0 not feeling nor understanding what the community wants (given when the class has been since Razakus Priest) when Purify was released*".
---
2 updates from now: *we apologize guys, we didn't really feel nor understand that a 1 Mana Heal 5 Priest class card was the last thing the Priest players were looking for. We were also too dumb and not bold enough to come up with anything remotely more attractive.*
---
Fuck me.
---
Like others have said, at least the Rogue card has potential to be played around with with cards that copy battlecries, battlecry minions, shuffle them into your hand and whatever, especially if there ever would be a spell-less Rogue archetype to be born, where a card like Plaguebringer would let you take care of big minions without having Spell removal.
---
But noooo, let's print the most reduntant fucking shit ever yet again.
---
This subreddit is just a bunch of morons. The class identity thing is something they will stick to in the goddamn future, not change every fucking card in the existing cardpool to immediately.
---
Dude this and when your minions attack get attacked etc that would be incredibly dope
---
They don't want to make it a good card. At best they want it to be OK. They don't want to replace a card only to later have to replace it again when it ends up being HOF'd.
---
Isn't that just a flash of light?
---
Wild format
---
Which implies they just identified class strengths and weaknesses, despite being 4 years into their game.
---
I just disenchanted this gold card yesterday and said to myself how cool it is.. damn shame.

The issue is that too many of the recent priest spells have spell generation in mind. Ever since Lyra came out back in Ungoro, the priest legendary weapon from Kobolds (dont even know its name), and shadow visions, Priest spells have been getting cheaper and cheaper to indirectly strengthen spell generation in priest.
---
But I think this mechanic has reached saturation already. We dont need another cheap priest spell that does nothing but cycle spell generation effects.
---
Ikr, good to see someone agreeing with me :)
---
All three of those are generating value, that's why they stop
---
Oh right
---
I think I will open my classic packs so I don't open this. And will probably open it though.
---
Shadow Visions is honestly one of my favourite spells..
---
It felt fair and really gave Priest some meme material and it was a fair card, just getting more copies of spells, such as your Elise pack or Scream..
---
I wouldn't say Quest Rogue was enabled by Vanish to be fair, it was a fast deck in Un'goro and a good deck later on because of Sonya and Giggling Inventor respectively...
---
Oil Rogue was probably one of the best decks this game has had. Strong, difficult to play, with interesting and varied decisions throughout the game.
---
Decks these days are RNG card generation or RNG minion generation. Boring, no skill, no interesting decisions.
---
You know that ET game that was so bad they rounded up all the copies of it and buried them? Yeah, Barnes can get that, except they can bury the bastard on the moon.
---
I think you have a bit of Dunning Kruger going on yourself...
---
Why does that upset you? lol
---
I wrote that during my break at work after getting to 500 with paladin. Wanted it to feel like an authentic in the moment reaction. Sorry if that offended you somehow.
---
man that's a lotta gold
---
Either nerf would work for me
---
The damage happens first, so the minion dies, unfortunately.
---
Trivia: AI currently brakes and tries to heal 2 or less health friendly minions, thus killing them.
---
New Priest card is horrible. RIP Mind Blast combo.
---
well it's just my opinion. i stopped playing after exodus
---
That is simply not true. Just look at mage. Frostbolt, Fireball, Flameatrike, Blizzard, Polymorph. And then you have cqrds that have always been staples from the classic set. Hellfire, Backstab, Fan of Knives, Flame Imp, Shield Block, Truesilver Champion, Consecration, Lightning Storm, Power Word: shield, Shadow Word: Death, Hex, Unleash the Hounds, Houndmaster, Savannah Highmane, Freezing Trap, Swipe, Wrath, Sap, the list goes on and on.
---
The goal of the classic/basic set isn't to just not be used, because that would mean new players coming into the game would start with absolutely terrible cards with no hope of winning. However, these cards should not be so good that they see play in EVERY single competitive deck. They should be a baseline power level for each class, but the cards shouldn't be so good that they are never replaced from the deck. 
---
And that's the issue with Radiance. It doesn't even reach a playable baseline power level. If you look at past cards like Binding Heal, Flash of Light, Light of the Naaru, Regenerate, none of those were seen in top competitive decks. They were barely even in average power level decks. And Radiance is actually even worse than those cards. It only lets you heal your own face, even when cards that had an extra effect on top of that never even saw play. 
---
I'm not saying priest needs an OP card. I'm not even saying this new card should be a GOOD card. Hell, it doesn't even have to be AVERAGE. But right now it is worse than cards that were already weak. It is below below average.
---
ok?
---
I played plenty of silence priest and it's a really fun deck, and not like anything I've played before or since. That sounds like exactly the sort of weird deck that there ought to be more of in HS. That's why Purify doesn't actually suck.
---
Deathrattle Rogue was a tier 2 deck in both the Boomsday Project and Rastakhan's Rumble. Rogue also has the second most deathrattle related cards in the game.
---
I stopped buying packs after the first hall of fame. Sorry, not going to waste money. Aside from the heist, haven’t bought anything in years. 
---
If they rotate out old cards and change add news ones that are tweaked it is okay. Destroying them for every environment is not.
---
I feel like we are playing two different games. Face Hunter is an aggro deck even if you put the "Midrange" tag on it. Last season was Odd Paladin aggro shitshow, so much that Baku had to be hof. Aggro has always been dominant in HS, and they always be. When the devs are confronted about this they usually nod and say "there must be aggro", I don't really get why. Midrange is the style that is extict, for a long time you either play aggro or Warrior (the only control in HS due to their hero power and op core set), there have been some combo here and there but they come and goes.
---
Its not about changes, it's about a cost benefit evaluation.
---
And if their PR team concludes that putting resources into communication ends up affecting the mood of the community in a negative way and stumps sales they obviously don't like doing it. 
---
Also its obviously about the scope of the outrage. 
---
Yes there will be always negative feedback that doesn't mean that more outrage doesn't at some point become significant. 
---
The mood in this subreddit is atrocious, most people love to hate on blizzard and treat it as established fact that they are evil/greedy/stupid. 
---
This is a hard position to come back from.
---
Probably 2 different teams that designed the cards and wrote that blog post. /s
---
There’s usually a reason people miss things.
---
Kibler is a good example of someone who A) has a relationship with the devs, and B) has been a game dev himself. So he has a good perspective on the ramifications of changes, what to criticize, and how to communicate criticism in a constructive way. A lot of pro players only see it from the competitive player perspective, and communicate more like your average redditor. That doesn't make their criticism worthless, but I'd definitely expect Kibler to be on the more magnanimous side of the spectrum when it comes to judging the value of changes.
---
This flair stuff is stupid. Just seems like censorship.
---
I am just refering to the toxic ones, the rest is completely fine and valuable.
---
This, people need to read the article
---
Think I will when this "Update" (Downdate? Is that a thing?) hits.
---
Any tips for bullying Priest?
---
So you play deathwing first right?
---
&gt; classic cards aren't supposed to be staples
---
Says who? There are loads of classic cards which see lots of play, and plenty that see play depending on the current expansion. The latter is the case for classic cards which are properly balanced.
---
See here. Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
Anytime =D
---
Pogo-Hopper deck is getting worst now.
---
Nerf?  Sorry that would require dust refunds.  As this is actually better for minions with 3 and less attack we will be calling this a rework.  No dust refund.
---
There should not be decks in the meta that are simply unbeatable against certain decks. It’s very poor design and unfair. That’s the main problem with this mage deck, you either lose every time because you can’t do jack shit about big guys coming out on turn 4 or you play mech hunter and rush them down every time. There’s no in between against this deck
---
Magma eager + this card = two card 5 Mana 5/5
---
Then they should hire someone like you to write it in a more clear manner so we'd understand it.
---
Tight budget for small indie companie i get it, but what about love of the work you're doing ?
---
it's a bad deck, check others. playing a bad deck just to counter a specific matchup will make you lose more games in total.
---
Ideally they just skip over toxic posts, and ideally we as a community don't promote and support them. These changes are not some catastrophe even if you don't like them, so hopefully as a community we can lean into being constructive and not assume a change we don't agree with is because of evil or incompetence.
---
It's not like magic at all, once cards rotate out of standard there, they may still see play in modern (like wild, and unlikely), commander, and you can play cube draft with friends.
---
*laughs in Hireek*
---
This post is pure white knighting for Blizzard. PoE is 100% a flawless example of transparency and mitigating blowback from the community.
---
It takes actual work to deal with criticism and Blizzard is a control freak company that can do no wrong. Blizzard is just milking the game now. Their posts literally don’t even make sense.
---
Rogues and Priests class identity with Vanish and MB has somehow been wrong since release? Wow. It’s a shame they didn’t even know their own class they made was made wrong... who knew? It’s all bullshit.
---
Watch it doesn't burn you!
---
In the immortal words of khadgar: 
---
“Random legendaries are ALWAYS good!”
---
*Currently in the future* in the same sentence
---
For the only problem is the destruction of entire archetypes. I'm fine with the basic concept of class identities, but the just print cards for those. Don't remove existing staples that have been fine for years merely because they don't match your current vision. 
---
I hate being forced into a specific playstyle. Mind Blast is one of the most fun cards in Hearthstone for me, precisely because it doesn't fit the standard mold of what you'd expect from a 'defensive' class like priest. Even if it doesn't receive (much) support, it's just fun to have the option to try and craft some form of aggro priest. It's a great part of the game, so it really hurts when the dev team actively tries to remove my fun.
---
True, and nobody said it would be good... You had just argued that it would be a 1/1 from Barnes, when that's not the reason Barnes is used.
---
I’m on the fence because I think that it’s a really good demonstration for new players to the power of combos in the game and for the larger part of its history in standard it has been hard to pull off but not impossible.
---
Shadow Visions made the combo way more consistent to the point that, just my personal opinion, it will always now be one of the strongest decks in wild. In standard we have topsy turvy and really high defense minions that are not anywhere as consistent but still add some pseudo-redundancy to make it easier to pull off than full-vanilla hearthstone. 
---
to;dr: I think the cards are very restrictive to card design but also important teaching tools.
---
I don't understand how Priest's weakness are face damage spells, and the proceed to remove the only face damage spell
---
Let's remove Priest's entire Basic set and replace it with a single card that says, "Your next emote this turn deals 5 extra points of emotional damage".
---
Need a if you have tecieved 60 damage this game win spel for priest.
---
How can someone never heard of that deck and be rank 1. That deck was a thing since shirvallah was released
---
It's a basic card.
---
there is no way to gain it quickly, it will be a slow progress. you should focus on long term. dont burn out yourself trying to get 30 wins a day as a starter like others mentioned. it will be very difficult and make you quit the game. it's almost impossible. however you can google the hidden quests, there are some worthy ones to try to achieve that give good amount of rewards.
---
Add 2 health to a character includes your hero. And with that wording, you could make it be able to go above the 30 health cap. And then you can still be healed on top of that. For instance, you are at 27 health and use Hero Power and Regenerate on yourself. With the current hero power you woule go from 27/30 to 29/30 to 30/30. With the new hero power, it would be 27/30 to 29/32 to 32/32.
---
**If it has less than 4 Health, double it instead.**
---
Just more resurrect BS mechanic to make people loathe wild and force them to play STD
---
The 1 pogo list I saw from Toast's website ran Vanish.  
---
A bunch of other lists I saw ran 2 Sap's but no Vanish OR Evicerate.  These cards dilute the pool of pulling pogos and draw ability.  Sooner to bounce Pogo's you won't need Vanish anyway.
---
While I agree that Radiance needs to be changed, I don't think that changing Priest's identity is the way to solve Radiance. The real way to rework Radiance would be to put it in line with said identity. If we look at the post Radiance doesn't really fit that :
---
* **Narrow but powerful spells** : I guess it is narrow, but it isn't powerful. Also, I see narrow more as "you require X/Y/Z precondition to be met before this card is good", rather than "this card isn't playable unless X/Y/Z precondition is met". For instance, Purify would fit this section, since it is playable on any of your minion, but it can be detrimental to use on some of them.
---
* **Copying** : There is a slight synergy here where it helps priest use stolen cards such as Weapons or Demons that inflict damage to your face... but that's kind of a stretch.
---
* **Single-minion buffs :** Absolutely no interaction.
---
* **Deathrattle :** Absolutely no interaction.
---
* **Healing** : It does heal, but only heals your own hero, and for a fixed amount. 
---
Its best use case is abusing *Gadgetzan Auctioneer* and other "cheap spell" engines. So basically, the card you included exacerbates existing issues, without really fitting the class' identity. As such, it should be :
---
1. More expensive (3-4 mana)
---
2. Strong (have a "unique" effect)
---
3. Niche (requires certain conditions to be useful)
---
4. Potentially interacts with copying, deathrattles, or single-minion buffs.
---
***Idea #1*** 
---
&gt;2 mana : Give a friendly minion **Deathrattle** : restore 2 health to all friendly characters.
---
Simple, it interacts with Deathrattle, it is an AoE heal which has more uses than single-target... But it's a bit complex for a Basic or Expert card (Give a friendly minion Deathrattle can be confusing at first).
---
***Idea #2***
---
&gt;3 mana : Restore a minion with 1 Health to full Health. Restore as much life to your hero.
---
Can be used with Shadow effects to kill off a 1-health minion, otherwise it's a strong heal for big minions... still weak thanks to its 3-mana cost.
---
***Idea #3***
---
&gt;7 mana : Fill your hand with Healing spells.
---
Once again, very bad, but it's still a lot of healing, and can lead to some wacky shit since some healing cards have side effects (damage, copy, card draw, etc.)
---
Wait, how does that work here? Do you know what it means? 
---
How am i underestimating the complexity of the situation leading to an overconfident assesment of the situation?
---
I am saying it severely complex and thats why he doesn't get it. 
---
If that is a fallacy it is a completely different one.

Are there really hundreds of posts like this popping up? I just did a search on "designer" for the past 24 hours and found exactly one big rant about it.

It's not even draw, It's a cantrip, and a bad one.
---
Uh, mid tier 2 is pretty good. A lot of classes would kill for such an eternal spot. For that matter, nah, CW has been Tier 1 for the vast majority of Hearthstones lifespan. It took a brief break, but really, to say that Warrior "finally has the spotlight" after having had it for years is just a joke. Even Rogue wasnt as universal as Warrior is.
---
Paladin didn't lose draw, it is listed as a limitation.
---
Entombing the N'zoth pally's tirions... good times
---
&gt; Almost none of what is in that identity helps win games
---
I mean... healing is a win condition, since it lets you control board a lot better.
---
Similarly, single-target buffs win games. Just look at Edwin who can quite frequently close a game out.
---
Narrow but powerful spells also win games, just look at Conjuror's Calling or Kangor's Endless Army.
---
Deathrattles absolutely win games, the proof is that there currently are hunter and paladin competitive decks using Deathrattles as part of their strategy to win games.
---
Lastly, you have copying, something like Tess Rogue, wouldn't you say? Sure, if you just casually copy the whole deck, then it isn't a strategy. However, by using various mechanics, you can definitely do some wacky shits that other classes cannot do with their own cards. Lucentbark in Druid is playable; Lucentbark in Priest is complete nonsense. Pit Lord in Warlock is an average minion; Pit Lord in Priest is a great minion (big body, and the damage to face isn't all that relevant thanks to the various heals).
---
It also comes with the caveat that you can get 3, 4, and often even 6+ copies of a single card. Playing 2 Highmanes as Hunter isn't a win condition, but playing 4 as Priest might be.
---
Honestly, not only is the title of your post 100% unrelated with the body (title is that Radiance should be changed, body is that Priest should be changed), but your post is actually done in bad faith. You completely fail to actually acknowledge that each of those can be strengths, playing it off as if those cannot be win conditions, when they have all historically been.
---
It's all about looking at those strengths and weaknesses as a whole, rather than individually :
---
- Copying + Buffs : you can neuter their strategy by flipping the board on them (think Psychic scream or Mass Hysteria), and using their strength against them.
---
- Healing + Single minion buffs : You get a big board (tall rather than wide), and keep it alive. You can trade into their minions, and Circle of Healing your minions back to full health.
---
- Copying + Healing + Deathrattle : As long as you can generate more than 1 card per card (think of Thoughtsteal, or Shifting Shade, rather than Mind Vision), you can try to outvalue your opponent through card count and keeping those cards alive.
---
Then, you round it all up with those "Strong but narrow" cards (usually spells). Things like Zerek's Cloning Gallery can really bolster a deathrattle deck. Cards like Inner Fire can close out a game when you rely on big minions and single-target buffs. Stuff like Prophet Velen can let you get the most out of those reach cards.
---
Also, you have to keep in mind that the post wasn't about what the classes are good/bad at, but rather what they *should* be good/bad at. It's a work in progress, and it's the direction they intend to take over the next 3 years.
---
&gt; Priest needs a part of their identity that actually wins Hearthstone games. Something like Shadow or Dragons or anything.
---
Dragons isn't any better than Deathrattles, buffs, or any other win conditions. Dragons should be there, but it's a shit argument for it.
---
As for Shadow, Shadowpriest is in a weird spot right now because it tends to focus on face damage, and they don't want face damage to be a strength for Priest. Things like Shadow Word : Pain/Death/Horror is what they want Shadow Priest to be. Cabal Shadow Priest, Potion of Madness, and Shadow Madness also fit that idea. They're... wait for it... strong but niche cards!!!
---
respect
---
neutral cards are supposed to cover weakness I guess
---
Give me a hug please...
---
WHATTTTT ARE YOU FOR REAL???? I'M SO HYPED DON'T PLAY WITH MY HEART LIKE THIS IS THIS TRUE
---
&gt; The strength and weaknesses they outlined in the article are what they envision for the classes going forward
---
Holy shit someone actually read the post
---
I'm not saying battlecries are uninteractive, because that's not true, most of the time you can tell what type of deck are you up against and there are key minions/cards in every archetype so you can try play around spesific cards even when they are battlecry minions (for example if you are up against an even shaman you might not want to trade your 3/4 into a 1/1 to play around fire elemental). 
---
With this spesific card the only way you can play around it is if you decide to kill off an enemy minion on the board, so that they cant kill of it themselves and resurrect it on their turn, but if you kill that said minion off yourself then your opponent will probably not play it as a 7 mana 6/8 (until they desperately need tempo and/or have no other play, even then, 7 mana 6/8 isn't too bad on it's own). Not to mention u are missing out on the face damage if you do decide to trade. They will just wait for another opportunity to resurrect something else. And of course they will eventually resurrect something since it's borderline impossible to kill everything on board in every turn and prevent enemy from killing/trading off their stuff. 
---
This all boils down to resurrect mechanic being absolute bullshit, since it's impossible to prevent enemy minions from dying and somehow winning. (Unless u were freeze mage few years ago)
---
i just realized it costs 5.
---
Isn't there an evergreen card that gives divine shield to one minion and costs 1? And there is a 2 mana 2/2 that does the same as a battlecry? And neither is played? Are Blizzard afraid of blood knight paladins dominating the meta?
---
I think Paladin is the class that has no actual identity. Sure it has Divine Shield and stat manipulation, but those are just tools, not decks. Things like Truesilver and Consecration don't see play because Paladin can make them great, they see play because they're just great, and any class with access to them would probably try to play them. Contrary to cards like Mage's smaller spells that would be card disadvantage for years or just Gadgetzan Auctioneer fodder for most classes but Mage can use them better than anyone else with things like Cyclone and Sorcerer's Apprentice.
---
Since WOTOG there has been push for Divine Shield, Secret, Mech, Dragon, Murloc, Silver Hand Recruit, Spell, Heal, Handbuff, and Buff Paladin. Quite literally an archetype attempt every expansion. Each of these archetypes have gotten multiple cards supporting them, most over multiple expansions, and none have yielded fruit except Mech in Rise of Shadows, and that deck is still not near Tier 1. Whenever Paladin has been decent before Rise of Shadows, it was because they had a good control shell and a usable combo, Aggro Paladin based around Baku/Genn, or Murlocs reaching critical mass before the Warleader nerf. Then, they nerfed Equality. Somehow Shirvallah OTK Paladin has survived but this meta is not very forgiving for combo decks, so it's not top of the brass either.
---
None of the things they actually try to push for Paladin end up working, unless Murlocs somehow count. It's always some coincidental thing like combo decks involving the Murloc resurrection card or playing and shuffling Shirvallah then casting Holy Wrath, or Paladin being the best class at spamming Hero Powers in the meta that was dictated by them.
---
Can you actually use this deck?
---
This is huge and honestly what I keep having to remind myself.  Hearthstone is fundamentally a children’s card game.  A large swath of the user base is younger than 25ish and flat out don’t have the perspective needed to understand game design from a top-down perspective.  You can be a top notch player that consistently dominates and STILL have a limited perspective, so the randos here on reddit aren’t exactly going to super wise, especially when it’s easier to glom on to memes and popular opinions.
---
"Here's a durian."
---
I'd say that they need to quickly come out with a new card or cards in the next batch that show how this "freed design space" is going to make for fun, viable priest decks. Right now they've just removed an existing option (and any concern about damage from hand for those playing against priest) and made vague noises about it being good in the long run.
---
Sadly, to identify a class, a card needs to have somewhat of an impact and not be utter trash
---
no one is ever going to say mentally challenged instead of retarded except the people correcting the people who say retarded. good day sir.
---
Seems weak, let's remove the ogreload and make it a mage class card
---
Oh FUCK OFF. No it is not. Healing yourself for 5 is not worse than doing nothing.
---
Screenshot saved to desktop!
---
Scheme actually isn't bad as a one-of in greedy Control Warrior. It's a good way to armor back up after suiting up as Dr Boom.
---
That's actually crazy, the cost is less plus the 2 attack 2 shield. I mean, Kappa please
---
Also a much worse card to get resurrected or pulled by Barnes.
---
It’s true!
---
I’ll take the penis mightier for 200 Trebek
---
With Waggle Pick it would still occasionally give Rogue a 4 damage AoE with face damage for 2 mana. It's basically an easier version of Tinkers into Flurry because you don't need to combo the Tinkers.
---
&gt;Just think about it: Vanish has only ever been relevant when there has been a value oriented Rogue deck that does not mind losing card advantage because it can grind longer games out. 
---
This should be highlighted and it is so true.
---
In fact Vanish was particularly strong in 
---
- Quest Rogue
---
- Kingsbane Rogue
---
- Pogo Rogue
---
The best measurement
---
I feel this direction of the game is bad for its health. As a long time player whos spent money, I dont think ill ever buy packs again. I might buy another adventure if its low in cost. But this style of development, is not good. Class identity and flavour is a thing, but gutting the core gameplay for it to happen, is not good, and every time these changes happen it makes the bad new player experience even worse. 
---
We're witnessing the downward spiral beginning to accelerate

Well, a lot of these cards were released in RoS, and there are still powerful card draw effects in classic shaman (farsight/ mana tide). So while they might print less card generation stuff in the future, they've already printed much more of it for shaman then really any other class, and some of the cards like underbelly angler are so far above any other analogous card that it seems kind of ridiculous to say that card generation is a \*weakness\* of the class.
---
I wonder if the value of cards being different isn't a bad thing though? A card player told me once that some of the most interesting moments come from when players have to find strange ways of making things work. So I'm not sure if the end goal is in fact to make things like balanced, but rather than imbalance sometimes leads to interesting solutions
---
Rank 8 to 1 ive gone against 3 big priest total
---
Maybe, but if you have a deck that requires divine shield, I can see both of them being played in the same deck hahah
---
That's because you have to twist your deck around quest, start with 1 card less and wait for eons to get it. Greater Healing Potion is a better example.
---
&gt; Mill Rogue
---
They still have card draw in classic. Not to mention how literally every single expansion since the witchwood has given shaman resource generation.
---
Because it’s the only priest deck you might lose to?
---
Should be as long as you’ve levelled rogue enough to get the golden versions.
---
The heads are named from left to right; Ni, Ichi and Kevin.
---
I have been out of the loop for a while and come to see this... What a disgrace. 
---
Anyone who has ever played priest (clearly no one in the hearthstone team) knows that they key for a good heal card is its versatility with auchenai. If it cannot be used with auchenai it better heals a lot. It is true that priest craves healing, but not exactly hero healing. You need a way to keep your high health minions alive, flash heal was a good card. It wasn't busted, back then velen's OTK were rare. You can't velen OTK with flash heal unless some Mana reduction has occurred, and on top of that you'd need a 2 mana heal-&gt;damage card like embrace the shadows or auchenai phantom. So many cards! It is not something the hearthstone team should worry about.
---
Instead, we get this. Priest, the foster child for bad quirky classes, gets the equivalent of "gain 5 armor" except it's worse. It's a joke. This game. All of it. I haven't played in a long time but unless the next expansion really blows me away, which I doubt, I think I'll be dropping hearthstone entirely. 
---
The hearthstone team just doesn't know how to make good, entertaining cards anymore. They don't see what classes need, they don't know their own game anymore. How in the world you think radiance is a useful card? How does it compliment priest? It does nothing, you heal for 5 to your hero for what reason? Just go cast a cheap spell? It's not enough, they should have replaced mind blast with a good AoE so they don't have to print another aoe for them every single expansion. I mean, just think about how much brain power is wasted trying to come up with a different "deal 3+ damage AoE" version every year, a card that more than being interesting is simply needed. Yet you have to rework it again and again because if you don't then priest immediately falls to the last place.
---
Or we both missed the priest binding heal meta lol
---
It’s more just the aspect of losing all of a sudden like it didn’t matter what I did cause they were gonna win once they drew those two or three cards
---
Evis, SI and Backstab are still the best early game, high tempo removal in the game...
---
I have an 58% winrate, so I'm not an awful player, and when I used my priest deck for a daily quest it took me 12 matches to get two wins.  I tried mixing up my deck but it's just extremely underpowered.  Zoolock and mech decks absolutely dominated me.  My two wins were against a paladin and druid.
---
Why the fuck would you nerf base cards for the worst class
---
I dont think many cards will be a problem in paladin now. Without divine favor they have terrible card draw.  Even the 1 mana cycle 2 minions from your deck cant save them
---
Yes, also that
---
Why would you HOF cards for the worst class....
---
Could easily be give your minions divine shield and draw a card. Then it would be a "maybe..." card.
---
They really need to make shadow visions a basic class card from priest so they have a REAL "core" to play control from. And then find a clear that isnt as oppressive as Psychic Scream was.
---
Can you use zayle shadow cloak to play vs people? Also can you disenchant it?
---
Because of how the cyclical nature of card games means what is bad now might be overbearing in the future, just like how priest used the be trash then oppresses the meta for 2 years.  Bad design limits future design space even if it's not currently strong.
---
Dusted my gurubashi offerings, feelsbadman.
---
Same card, the golden version is premium
---
Win rate is meaningless without mentioning rank
---
What is dad legend, rank 5?
---
You can use the cloak like any other card, the deck you get will also be fully golden. You can't disenchant it though.
---
Calling it.
---
Warlock Control staple with bloodbloom.
---
Bloood bloom + doom/twisting neather + this.
---
those are his hands, duh
---
The one on the right is golden.
---
They aren't though. Devastator doesn't do 10 on turn 4. They don't get the discover mech hero power evert turn. The deck doesn't do a whole lot until the end game really.
---
You are playing a homebrew that is admittedly weak to control and are mad because it's weak to control. I see a lot of salt about control warrior, but most of it is just that. Salt. It feels bad to lose, particularly to control.
---
Character in GoT that &gt;!got killed by a guy called The Mountain!&lt;
---
Good save lol
---
But you get a 3/1 AND it has Windfury. If you don't queue against Mage, Rogue, Druid, Paladin or Warrior, they might not have a way to remove it on turn 2!
---
Yea my midrange hunter deck cant even win the Control Warriors cause by the time they have Dr. Boom its usually gg.
---
I more so assumed that was a mistake since they've made mistakes like that before (granting some uncollectable cards collectable gemstones like Tirion's weapon). But okay, I see this is just an assumption now, so I won't get my hopes up unless I see official confirmation.
---
Would love to get an official Team 5 response from this as I am in the same situation. Will buy welcome bundle if I can get Brightwing. u/mdonais
---
that...actually seems pretty fun? maybe if the total is zero damage by the end of the match, so you could do 11 damage through trading or whatever, but as long as you heal 11+ by the end of the match you can still get it
---
I was a bit of a whale before MTGA came out. After spending an initial $100 in that game, I've been coasting on dailies, drafts, and competitive events, collecting 100% of rares (epics in hearthstone) from the latest 3 sets. Since I've stopped spending money in Hearthstone when MTGA came out, I barely have enough of a collection to play standard, so now I have to choose between playing wild (a format I rather enjoyed) or dusting my wild cards to keep up in standard. It's a fucking yikes to me how anyone can keep defending Hearthstone's monetization model.
---
Not necessarily. I'd happy cheat out a deathwing, even if the battlecry can help me in some situations. Maybe you're just being too simplistic down there at rank 20? :P
---
Having your class be completely uncompetitive unless they print something nutty for it also shouldn't be part of the basic experience imo.
---
Call me Ice Block.
---
^ I can't find any official statement saying we will actually get a full dust refund.
---
But their argument is full proof. What could happen?
---
They actually right here, they put it in the limitations section for hunter and hunter really don't have a lot of good card draw/generation.
---
Master's call is a special and it's not "strong by himself" card since it have a huge deck building restriction.
---
Well we know it's not a mistake to make them common because they need to be craftable or new players won't have any way to get them, and basic cards are not craftable.
---
it's not getting smaller, it's just getting full of completely unplayable cards
---
well, that definitely sounds much better
---
Priest being OP in wild is literally a direct result of them having a shit basic  + classic set. IF priest is to be good in standard, you have to print new good cards every year, and this adds up to the current wild situation.
---
No, he's not.
---
Control priest was at least tier 2 back in the day. Don't forget lightbomb and entomb. And LOE Elise could turn that flash heal into a legendary.
---
Yeah, but have you considered the DUST DEVIL DREAM?
---
They don't have to be *meta*, they just have to be *slightly useful sometimes*. 
---
Like Mindblast! It's not a good card on it's own, but when a bit of combo support is printed, it finds a place. 
---
And Not like Radiance, which nobody should run in any deck ever!
---
That’s not the same thing as including exactly Excavated Evil in the Basic set though. I’m all for a better Priest AoE in Basic, but I don’t think EE fits what Basic should have.
---
it’s not bad 
---
it’s the worst heal card priest ever had
---
It's fun to finish quests with or in quick tavern brawls. Sometimes you get the dream of Tunnel trog + coin + Dust devil for a 3/3 and 3/1 windfury on turn 1, or even double dust devil on turn 1. That's 12 damage to face on turn 2. Throw in a flametongue totem on turn 3 for 20 damage on turn 3 alone, that's the dust devil dream.
---
Of course, since so many classes can easily clear it with either a ping or weapon, you hardly get to see it, but it's fun when it does.
---
You want the decklist? It's pretty much identical to the most popular midrange on hsreplay, except i run two rhinos.
---
WHAT THE HECK TED
---
well he is a little bigger, at least as boss but almost every boss is bigger then their normal counterpath, like gul'dan is gigantic as enemy as well although he is just another ork.
---
Cho ( 2 mana 0/4) because bombs are too offensive
---
bruh you just ripped off trump
---
Even wild paladin decks that run Stewart of Darkshire, Rallying Blade, etc. don't run blood knight. Blood knight is only good when it hits enemy minions.
---
I mean a dude is 1/1 and Harrison is 5/4 so he is like 4 dudes on top of each other with a bonus attack.
---
So the entire post is just "A decent position v secret hunter" if we remove the meme title?
---
You're right about this. Adding more Priest AOE isn't a huge problem, because there are already so many options. If they wanted to restrict Priest's access to board clears, that ship sailed a long, long time ago, probably when Dragonfire Potion got printed.
---
Have a silver on me
---
You can chance your settings so people don't see your name
---
I almost reached 3 and was knocked out by Warriors and Hunters. So many warriors. I dont know what to do other than hope I dont queue into one.
---
Baby murloc best murloc
---
I never realized how creepy his face looks....his eyes read murder, not theft
---
Oh gotcha. I’m running the spell variant. Again - I have some success, but Warrior still wins about 65% of the time. My biggest issue is how frequent I’m running into them. I chocked it up to bad luck, but it’s not. Control warriors are much more prevalent than Reddit wants to admit.
---
I confess
---
Warrior can use its hero power raise its max health. That is not great alone, but it still does something. 
---
When you are at full health as a priest and have no minions, then your hero power is actually worthless.
---
Shaman hero power also has Stoneclaw Totem that can affect the board. Shaman hero power does put things on the board, but the random aspect is its own issue.
---
I feel like this joke *belongs in a museum*
---
Still looking for someone...
---
Please, when you add no AFK mode or full friendlist...
---
&gt; teach new players the value of upgrading their decks
---
I'm just glad people see through this bullshit line now
---
Because back in the day people wouldn't stop sucking MaRo's dick and slurping down this bullshit excuse about shit cards
---
Are you running lifedrinker? I know its not much, but it dodges armor and i swear it has basically won half my games against warrior.
---
It would still be unplayable at 3 mana. 5 is just stupid
---
Still waiting on my dust from that. Blizzard, you be slackin’!
---
Not necessarily, in the future, you could have temporary mana generation rather than ramping up permanently. I question whether prenerf innervate would be as strong as it was without the support  of wild growth and nourish.  Also you can tack on ramp to weak minions like greedy sprite. I think the idea is fine, but the original mana ramp set was overtuned
---
Wow you're a real smart one arent you. Another salt comment in the books. Have you noticed yet that you're one of the only ones claiming "SALTY" 
---
while most everyone else is trying to talk about something?
---
This sub attracts the brightest minds I see.
---
Yes! Two copies of lifedrinker. I know what you mean - it’s won me some as well! What’s nice is the face damage, even against taunts in other classes too.
---
LOVE REJECTED
---
then you still have silence, Owl or the 4 mana silence guy. If taunt is your only option against such a combo you would be fucked either way. MAss dispel didnt even see any play at all prior to the rotation (for years).
---
Cyclone mage is unfavored 45-65  
---
Freeze mage and mid hunter are both only slightly favored at 55-45  
---
Your anecdotal stats don't mean anything. Mage and hunter are decks that are supposed to be good into warr, but still have more than a good chance to be overwhelmed by warrior unless they make very greedy tech choices that lower their chances in other matchups.
---
Priest having too much AOE isn't a huge problem, since it's removal. If there were 15 spells in the 5 to 8 mana board clear range, you wouldn't make a deck out of 30 AOE removal spells.
---
A better example is the Spellstone and Mass Resurrection. The 'Resurrect Priest' archetype doesn't exist much within the classic/basic set, so they keep printing new cards to keep it around. These are piling up in wild, and Big Priest is a Big Problem, warping the rest of the wild meta. Can your deck beat Big Priest? If not, you won't go anywhere.
---
I think a lot of wild players were totally flabbergasted to just see not 1 new big priest card, not 2, not 3, but 4 new cards for the archetype: Catrina Muerte, Archmage Vargoth, Mass Resurrection and Forbidden Words. Hell, even Convincing Infiltrator sees play in some big priest lists. Very few people think this was a good thing for wild, even if the deck has remained at the bottom of tier 1 or top of tier 2.
---
the difficulty with those bundles is that they're really only useful if you skipped grinding an expansion. 
---
I always ask myself "Would I enjoy 20 dollars worth of packs or some video game more?" and the video game ends up winning out.
---
I was exaggerating a bit. The least that usually happens is three 4/4s and a 5/4 somewhere in there by turn five.
---
dont worry nothing if you complain as everyone complains about dr boom.
---
Cool story bro.
---
Yeah, that I agree with..
---
happens fairly often to me, not too bad though, unless you are against that chick who sets your turn timer to 25 seconds
---
If everything was about being objective then you'd need to delete a lot of your posts I would think. ;)
---
Idk who jizzed in your wheaties but it wasn't me. Idk what you are even doing outside the PokemonTCG subs
---
That's true....
---
It's just terrible how Blizzard is handling this and most Priest players can tell you that
---
Well played
---
U Mad Bro?
---
it's more naming than anything else. The gameplay is still dungeons, but blizzard took features of adventures to make a paid solo content.
---
Exactly. Blizz has since come out stating "class identity" when several decks/classes are running rampant doing things the team probably never thought would happen. Which isnt always a problem dont get me wrong.
---
My argument with warrior is their ability to generate cards in the late game like no other. I mean ffs the 1 mana generate 3 mechs at turn 10+ is nonsense like you said. Paired with Dr. Boom and it's just out of control. And again, just like you said, you cant out generate them out of the late game because it is way too late at that point. So you naturally play aggro right? Kill them before they can set up armor/a bas to control...
---
No... it wont work. They have warpath, brawl, deal 5 split mech, rush, Supercollider and then AFTER THAT... Dr.Boom with rush mechs and insane hero powers every game.
---
I feel like the Blizz team thinks it's okay because DK heroes have rotated and they removed the Odd/Even problem earlier than expected because it was stale and automatic. But all that's left now is one of the Hero cards that just destroys any aspect of your deck you've tried to play. It's almost literally the same issue but with one class now.
---
But they don’t nerf hunter base set, the most OP one.  How does scavenger have +health on that effect still?  How do their base cards (hounds) have charge still?  It’s a stupidly simple faceroll set that comes back to tier 1 over and over again combined with a few OP expansion cards they keep printing as “midrange hunter”
---
But nerf priest, okay
---
Fuck them. It's shitty design and they were not transparent at all.  Very little "transparency" in my opinion.
---
Lmao. Everything isn't. They should nerf/ban cards based on objective facts. ;-P
---
Luck jacket, title said first reaction bruh month ago
---
Im so fuckin mad i cant contain my fucking rage for another fucking second i swear to god my wrath shall never end your kin will be suffering on the endless flaming lake of my incessant anger for all of eternity grrre im so mad
---
What? Force-Tank is decent in Arena, and by a good margin not crap.
---
And I think you mistyped Eccentric Scribe when you wrote Burly Shovel Fist.
---
The 5g idea would be awesome encourages nice behavior etc. But i dont think this will get implemented.
---
The Curator is just a Mech. (Powered by magic)
---
They literally have - most recently raiding party
---
&gt;Rogue games that play out a little too similarly than we think is fun  
---
Nothing objective about that.
---
It would be super annoying at 3 mana because of all the odd paladin shit in wild.  I would also be super annoying ar 4 mana because of even paladin.  It's fair at 5.
---
Triggered. :)
---
moron
---
The maul does not discount Shirvallah. 
---
1/5
---
Somebody in the other thread was talking about binding heal...
---
Circle-cleric-pyro was never really a thing except when divine hymn was added to give it consistency and mechathun was added to make such reckless drawing possible. Divine Hymn also saw play in standard revive priest, the bursty one, iirc. And yeah, that was partly because it couldn't run too many minions, and partly because of radiant elemental, and partly because of spellstone. But it's a pretty great card.
---
(also, doesn't it see play in dragon priest lists?)
---
They nerfed it because of consistency, not "its boring bro". Blizzard always dumbs down their message and clearly its not enough.
---
Still there was never really a push for a "divine shield" deck, just those few cards had synergies with it.
---
I often play cards I top deck, even if I have another in hand, just to try and tilt people with "top decks".
---
Help i need my safe space im so owned by FACTS and LOGIC
---
All hero cards to HoF wouldn't be a bad thing and don't print any again.  
---
Zuljin wasn't so bad but the played effect is almost an "i win" card and I personally hate 'I win" cards.  Hagatha just another infinite generator.
---
agreed, but at least then you could semi-sort of justify the hero only, and if you had Velen it would be a 10 heal on turn 7, not great, not awful(3.6)
---
Or [[Iron Hide]]
---
