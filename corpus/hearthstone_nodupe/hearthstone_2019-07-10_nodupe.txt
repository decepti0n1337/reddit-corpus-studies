Statistically speaking, Barnes is kept in the mulligan 100% of the time and has a very high winrate when played on curve. I don’t think this creates a very interactive experience, hearthstone should be about decision making and having a card with such absurd stats exists is ridiculous. People “love playing Barnes” because often not they know they’re going to win, it’s not rewarding and it’s certainly not engaging. The deck is still playable without Barnes and I don’t see people shying away from the deck through a nerf. The deck will still do powerful stuff, yet it would lack such a problematic highroll as is Barnes.
---
---
---
I'm comparing win conditions, not cards.
---
Welcome to the game/community! There are 3 expansions per year and at the end of each year there is a “set rotation” that gets rid of the cards from 2 years ago if that makes sense? So there’s set 1 2 3 in year A then set 4 5 6 in year B and at the end of year B all the sets from year A are rotated to wild. Then set 7 8 9 in year C and at the end of that all the sets from year B are rotated. I hope that makes sense..
---
It's a battery hog on my iPhone 6s but that's about the worst I can throw at it. OP might have it bad and be super unlucky, but OP also needs to get a grip with that "gamers rise up" stuff yeesh.

maybe increase the number of playable cards or build around cards?
---
Witchwood, Boomsday And Rastakhan’s rumble will be the next 3 sets to rotate in April of next year. Rise of shadows, uldum, and the following set will rotate April of 2021. 
---
You came in at a good time. Rise of shadows is the first set of the year of the dragon, meaning it will stay in rotation longer than any other set during the year of the dragon. 
---
Unlike Rastakhan’s rumble which was the last set of the year of the raven and will only be in standard for about a year. 
---
Rotation rules are kind of weird to understand because of the wording. But you’ll get the hang of it soon. All you need to know for now is that you won’t see any of your cards rotate for such a long time that you’ll have a strong grasp of rotations by the time it happens.
---
only time i agree with you but+1 good written comment you got my frustrations very well worded out
---
Reno.
---
Murloc shaman (and murloc decks in general) usually depend on sticking some early minions that then get buffed by other murlocs so that they consistently have the board early and win through early pressure. They have some reload with cards like angler but are heavily dependent on getting the board early.
---
Token druid's main strength is it's repeated ability to flood the board, and then once they have a wide board capitalize with buffs. They can get early board tempo with stuff like acorn bearer and dreamway guardians but can still win without sticking early by flooding with cards like whispering woods.
---
Spell hunter has a lot more single target removal / early board control than it has aoe board clears that are more relevant against token druids.
---
Is this a sneak peek into the third expansion of 2019?
---
Gay and Trans characters existing isn't forcing it down people's throats. As a transgender/pansexual girl, I'm a human that exists that deserves to be represented in media as much as straight and cis people do.
---
When they did offer a 20$ preorder, it was only 17 packs (and of course no legendary or anything).  Barely better value than a normal pack deal, which are designed to be overpriced so that their sales look cheaper.
---
Doesn’t really sound like you love discourse tbh
---
ALso, considering the Niche Murloc mage has been rising in popularity over the past, like, 4 expansions at this point, will it maybe get a card or two of support? It's a fun way to play an aggressive burn mage deck without the OP 1 mana wyrm, and considering one of the Heroes is a murloc this time around, it seems like you could slip a mage-loc in without much trouble, flavor wise.
---
But that gave us Mecha'thun priest.
---
you put my impressions into words better than i ever could
---
Jump ship to MTG?
---
That's not how it works. You'd have to beat them with the trash deck in order to force them to play it.
---
I feel like murlocs are pretty fun
---
I think this would be brilliant! Probably a little weird at first, but could definitely keep the game lively during the off season. Would also allow the team to visit smaller locations and themes (like some of the adventures), exploring things like Mechagon or Uldir.
---
When the fuck did you have to think during Classic?  Value druid, handlock, and murloc warlock didn't have to think for shit lol
---
Nice try, Blizzard employee. You're not getting my sheckels so easily this time!
---
Trust me as a wild player I’m tired of big priest too.
---
The rotation to Wild only happens with the first set of the Hearthstone year: the set that releases in April.
---
Rise of Shadows was that card set, so the rotation this year has already happened.
---
The next set rotation will be in 2020 with the release of that year's first card set, which will probably be in April again. When that happens, all cards released in 2018 (the cards from Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan's Rumble) will rotate to Wild.
---
There is no compensation for cards from Standard card sets rotating out to Wild; you still own the cards and you can still play them in Wild. 
---
If however they choose to rotate cards from the Classic Set, which are supposed to be permanent, then they give you full dust refunds on the cards, and you don't even have to disenchant them (i.e. they give you a refund *and* let you keep the card).
---
Note: dust refunds only work for as many copies you have of the card that are allowed in a deck. If you have 10 of the same Common card, you will only be refunded for 2 of them because you can only put 2 in a deck. You will only be refunded for 1 copy of a Legendary. If you have both Golden and non-Golden copies, they will prioritise refunding you the more valuable Golden copies.
---
Does this answer all of your questions?
---
[removed]
---
Did you message the mods?  I wish your post hadn't gotten taken down, it sounds like it was much higher quality than most gripe posts (and there are tons of gripe posts, so idk why yours got taken down?).
---
I think complaining about not having fun when you could just not play, or play arena/solo content is more pitiful than people having fun on the ladder, personally. 
---
Take a break, metas get stale before a new expansion. If the constant whine posts towards the end of each expansion has taught me anything, its that complaining on reddit about not enjoying a game is much less productive than doing something else you enjoy.
---
Imagine someone from ten years ago reading the title and trying to figure out what it meant.
---
Isn’t that the same kind of thing as twinspell? Technically if your playing a twinspell card, it should add a copy of itself to your hand, which would make it another twinspell card. It’s basically the same concept here, so I doubt the team was bothered by it since they’d already done it once before.
---
&gt; One of the clearest identities of Priest in the base set is Divine Spirit, but the mechanics of Divine Spirit can be so frustrating that it’s not something we go out of our way to design towards... We like leaning into high minion health so Priest can take advantage of their healing potential, but might have to address Divine Spirit in order to realize that goal. 
---
And there it is. Incoming Divine Spirit HoF!
---
Thanks, I'll destroy you last
---
These arent even about Blizzard or the sub, how do these even stay up
---
Tbh, budget Silence Priest is actually really good rn
---
&gt; Teamfight Tactics, Riot Games’ take on the “Auto-Chess” genre, was publicly released on June 26th. On that day, on the very second it came out, we could see a very sharp decline in Hearthstone games recorded that made a lasting impact throughout the week. This event is quite unprecedented. Indeed, it’s not a rival card game that has proven to be the biggest competition for Hearthstone, but the rising Auto-Chess genre, which is certainly pulling away the attention of some of Hearthstone’s player base and content creators.
---
[Source](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-135/)
---
Please look into buffing the Loa/Totem synergy cards from RR. I loved finally seeing Mech decks from Boomsday Project finally get a chance to shine and I think it'd be awesome that some of the criminally underplayed RR cards got a similar chance.
---
No free hero at rotation, Solo content was changed to paid. Seems like we didn't get as many RoS packs for free this time. The only thing that was F2P friendly was snip-snap.
---
Hearthstones whole thing is taking these parts of the game and giving them an entirely different background story and artwork.
---
How about you wait for the full set reveal before you.... hmm.... BUY SOMETHING WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT IS
---
I dont understand the point of desiding to preorder before you see the set, even more so when you never preordered before, if you want to bye it becouseyou like the new direction then maybe wait until you actualy know you like the new direction
---
I dont see why anyone whould preorder before the full reveal, thier is literaly no upside to it.
---
I was about to silence Tony when I drew the other Earth Shock right on time.
---
And yes, I’ll charge my phone.
---
I only ever preordered Witchwood because it gave you 70 packs for 50€ which I thought was a good deal. I probably will never preorder again because I kinda lost interest in the game overall. Glad I peeked on the sub today or I would probably miss the event. Might just do the necessity and see how fun new expansion is.

john#22108 eu  looking to trade 80g quest
---
I am f2p and have about 2k in gold. I generally aim for over 4k by the time a new expansion comes out and felt I was leaving my run a little late. This will hopefully help a lot.
---
I dink I wouwd have quit wif heawdstone fow a mond in his position uwu  
---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
I knew what you meant
---
I believe it‘s the wrong way looking at it. For me, it really boils down to $ per hour of fun had, and here Hearthstone blows so many other recreational/time-killing activities to smithereens.
---
And I still believe charging a sum that is not affordable to everyone but still to many so others can get f2p content is a better solution for the playerbase as a whole than having e.g. a lower sum (that would still be not affordable for everyone).
---
What really makes me uncomfortable is how the people who get stuff for free keep bitching at Blizzard as well as the people who chose to pay for the game and thus, for the f2p content. But oh well...
---
You don't even need to draw through your deck for the described combo, just gotta get all the cards and make sure there's no other mechs in your deck.
---
I think a lot of people’s hope is that without Barnes at least it’s worse against aggro and that might be enough to somewhat lessen its popularity.  Just seeing it less would be a relief to most.
---
My read is that Divine Spirit does not serve a valuable card position if Inner Fire (or certain swap mechanics) exists... so if Inner Fire goes away, Divine Spirit becomes a very weak card. Removing Divine Spirit only removes the spell combo with IF, but IF still exists and limits design space for their Priest class identity of high hp minions.
---
I'd wager IF is on the chopping block, but if that goes away DS needs to go as well or be substantially altered.
---
&gt; but when you consider art and audio are the two biggest offenders when it comes to client size we try to be very cautious when it comes to adding to either of these
---
Missed the bit where they said there’s one Lackey being added to the pool in SoU.
---

My Ram Wrangler PTSD makes me hate that card.
---
Yeah, thanks for that. Not like I can read or anything. 
---
It doesn't change anything I said.
---
I really miss Brode :(
---
Tbf though the new solo adventures are basically branches of the game. Compare them to Arena or slay the spire. It makes sense that they should be paid to create it.
---
I need to do this more often, too bad I don't see to many weird decks in standard. Plenty in wild though.
---
Ok?
---
Nice try
---
I pack a big punch!
---
New features? Come on now.
---
Have you gotten as much enjoyment out of that telescope as you would going to see 200 movies? Owning a fancy VR system? Having new tiles for a floor? Fancy new couch?
---
There is always a best way to budget your entertainment/hobbies, even if that budget is arbitrarily large. HS packs are "not a good deal" because their return is worse than comparable alternatives. 
---
Spend your money however you want but don't just box things into "hobbies are for wasting money" and "investments can't be fun."
---
These are the kind of ‘sound the bells’ clips I like
---
What the hell is up with referring to her chest as '' silly '' tho?

How do you think that it makes well-endowed women feel? It's my main issue with all of this sorta stuff, it just feels like people are constantly shitting on women who are well-endowed and making fun of them...

I'm always looking for more people to trade or share these quests with. Add me if you want!

KnOSaintTraft#1235
---
Oh sorry, I really did forget the /s
---
I was entirely joking. Mostly just referring to how Boom Scheme was armor gain. So Boom plague will be armor gain and everything dies (to make up for boom scheme being hot garbage)
---
Don't forget it's also where Muradin Bronzebeard was found as an amnesiac after his supposed death at the hands of Arthas.  Also, Ulduar has immense lore significance beyond being an elder god prison; it's where the titan keepers reside (except Odyn, until now I guess).  It is, all things considered, a pretty significant location.  I may be biased as one who spent countless hours camping for the aforementioned TLPD.  The music and the scenery are just so serene; it's one of my favorite zones in WoW.

1 mana 1/3, when you play a minion with Reborn gain +1/+1.

Sorry first time here. Are you looking for someone to do the quest with? I have it too atm
---
With number 2 and number 4 a lot. That's the same way EA sees their business model. I doubt it's good for f2p that they get old card packs or that their Basic cards get nerfed instead of set cards. Remember how they nerfed Wild Growth instead of UI or BtPathways? They do the same now.
---
I actually like this brawl.
---
It is very much control the whole way through, with constant back and forward. I have had quite a few memorable matches where it was literally back and forward. Anyone's game. Came down to "who built their deck better"
---
Why is this brawl still open?
---
Don't forget the most useless requested feature everyone. You can re-roll a legendary quest to get a bog standard one...
---
And in the past, some "Legendaries" were strictly worse than common cards.
---
What if it something like this...
---
Whenever you heal, deal that much damage randomly to an enemy target (or exclude face).
---
Might be OP though... Would like to see some kind of Shadow Priest support.
---
Valeera and Anduin are kind of like HS representatives as they have quotes/animation routines related to HS. Particularly Valeera who wasn't much to write home about in WoW. But I think it would be great to see HS original characters in HOTS like Reno/Hagatha/Inn Keeper.

BattleTag: Chris#112503
---
&gt; stop printing stupidly powerful cards that just continually drop the skill level in the game (e.g. Zuljin, conjurere calling, dr. boom)
---
Hell yeah!
---
But what about the opposite?
---
Some people abused a weird taunt glitch in Karazhan that got through a heroic boss really easily.  
---
I believe the same was true for the Lich King.
---
In terms of loyalty recognition, I don't think the Pandaria cardback (first ever non-class cardback) should ever come back, but thematic ones are more than welcome.  Like a summer event to give people the lemonade cardback, etc.
---
Sent you a request ill'show you first
---
You're welcome.
---
Agree with this wholeheartedly. 
---
I don't mind priest being able to turn a defense into an attack. My problem comes from them being able to make a single minion into lethal. 
---
If you have 12 health and leave up a 12 health minion, sure. You get killed, but that I think is fine. But if you are at 30 health and they summon one 12 health minion and you just die, that is stupid.
---
That's why, I honestly think Divine Spirit should be HoFed. leave Inner Fire as is.
---
finished sorry
---
Hope it's not like the other FYRE festival.
---
Its more the showcase of how long ive been playing thats annoying to miss. I dont mind other people having sccess to the cardback, but wish it was distinguished more.
---
I can relate to that, still 😜
---
How random are the decks for the burndown? Is literally every possible combination of 30 cards + hero class that doesn’t violate deck building rules a candidate in this brawl? Or is there some kind of shorter premade  list or algorithm that narrows down the possibilities (and if so about how many decks are there?)
---
I’m mostly thinking about how it seems the # of decks theoretically possible if all legal combinations are allowed would be astronomically high compared to the # of players who participate
---
I didn't realize silence erased freeze. It's about as illogical as it erasing summoning sickness.
---
I mean... would you typically have you computer and internet off? I didn't know people did that.
---
I 100% agree. I did not learn anything new from reading this.
---
Mass hex!! 🐸🐸🐸
---
&gt; Not having a board clear in the core set helps Priest’s board clear feel different with each expansion. At some points in time they have Psychic Scream, other times they have Mass Hysteria, other times it’s Plague of Death. It makes Priest feel different from set to set 
---
So they pretty much accepted that Priest sux by design
---
Why is it Immune to my own spells/hero powers I dont get it.
---
&gt;Statistically speaking, Big Priest is pretty average.
---
A lot of the deck is like a coinflip. Barnes on 4? Probably win. Bad Shadow Essence on 6? Good chance to lose.
---
Of course on average this might look "fair", but it is not in the individual games and it's very unfun to play against as player decisions are invalidated by swingy RNG.
---
Ppl overrates resurrection mechanics a lot, while underrating Rogue's early tempo advantage. Really funny how rez Priest is never relevant in any meta (incluiding wild, T3 according to vs synd ranks 4-1) and tempo based Rogues are almost always dominant (T2-T1 decks).
---
Just craft an annoy-o-tron or something
---
0 if you want to save money
---
It's not the fact it's immune.. it's because it has the faerie dragon "can't be targeted by spells or Hero powers"  
---
The Super Simian Sphere also summons him with the can't be targeted, on top of the immunity. Why, I have no clue, as he can't normally be targeted anyways.
---
Maybe for this exact reason.
---
Lodellica#2901 EU 80g, you go first

Jaleynd#1878
---
NA trading. I'll show you go first
---
I'd be fine with that, but it's a bad card. At that point, just give Priest a new classic card.
---
Well, yes. After you go in a certain way, you would only buy pack-by-pack until you get a legendary, right?
---
thats what i hope 9.0 does, we deal with n'zoht in 8.3 and the next expansion is world being made relevant and rebuild from cataclsym(the cata zones are older now then when they got updated first time)
---
Ok, so you spent freaking $3000 dollar on auto chess games then come here to complain that HS doesn't support F2P people  (like you) ??? Come on it is ok  if you don't like the game and don't want to spent  on it but don't bullshit here ok ?
---
Your opponent got lucky, boohoo bitchboi, boohoo
---
&gt; calls someone a trans person to insult them
---
&gt; “everyone in the hearthstone community is a pathetic scum bag”
---
Speak for yourself, asshole, you’re the one who got mad at someone else emoting. Squelch them then.
---
Since when it’s bb to say « well played » ? I mean, he was sure about his rolls, you didn’t expected them, and he told you he played very well (which he did).
---
^That
---
Also, it is similar to other deck building games like dominion, mystic vale and ascension which I very much like.
---
You basically killed Aviana-Kun combo, that was vastly played wasn't it? I for one thought it was one of the most fun decks in Wild. And yet when it comes to Big Priest you don't want to make changes.
---
Thanks!
---
Cool, another troll who "doesnt know" how to take a screenshot
---
I felt like mage was really good, however the easiest class was definitely rogue.
---
I don't want to play tier 1 aggro decks in casual.That's not what I play casual for
---
Warlock wasn't that bad, grabbed a few really good cards including grim rally.
---
Also, hunter gave me a few trouble at the start before I realized chickens are beasts and I could go all the way that way.
---
You lose one regular quest, because it gets replaced by the legendary.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
Res Priest has a 61 % win rate on Hearthreplay. I'd say that makes it preeeetty meta
---
If you would check his acc you would notice something. It isnt an insult.
---
They'll have to get rid of Topsy Turvy  too, it serves the same purpose.
---
Feel ya, it happens to me so often than you can imagine
---
Agreed. didn't really see it in any of my 10+ priest games or so though.
---
Well at least they were honest. They pretty much confirmed broken cards for Priest this expansion to patch up the post-rotation shit-show, at least we don't have to wait until the last expansion this time ????. I don't know if I could had endured another Purify-like releases this time.
---
1/657.720
---
OP didn't divide by two either
---
For real? I thought you could only pick a "favourite" hero.  
---
Thanks for the info
---
world
---
Meh rate 6/7
---
Click on the deck you wanna assign a different portrait to and then next to the column where you'd pick a specific cardback for the deck you got one to assign a specific hero portrait.
---
I'm not seeing much big priest in ranks 10-5 either. I don't understand where all this hate comes from. Blizzard also did changes to match making, so you don't get matched against same class or same person as often, so you should see even less (big) priest even if it's common.
---
Of course he did, his number is half the size of yours.
---
0 is technically the most optimal.
---
If you accept that fact, they I would say that either preorder will get you enough cards+dust for what you will need.
---
Technically, the sweetspot is about 70, but the extra dust from the big preorder helps you craft some stuff.
---
no it was nerfed like 2 years more or less before kingsbane was printed, they said for future design space and better weapons/buffs and kingsbane was only issue 2years later with unerfed furry and even then with kingsbane it was still overnefed blade furry just had to remove face dmg and wouldve been fine.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and if is 1card responsible for nerf it would be oil(which is now nerfed due prep nerf same as evry rogue spell)
---
When you are missing good classic legendaries these are not bad to get.  They aren't as good as the new expansion packs but it's nice to add +1 to classic pack pity timer.  Heck there are even classic epics that I need and don't want to be dust on.
---
How does one okay auto chess though? That game seems so boring and un-interactive
---
That could be a very interesting design for Priest's quest. Something along the lines of "2 mana: Heal an ally or deal damage to an enemy".
---
“Per minion”
---
Watch kripp's new players guide it explains how to get most value out of the packs and gold among other things. I didn't know it when started and missed out on several legendaries i could get.
---
Other than that just play games and enjoy. you'll learn most of the stuff along the way.
---
You can look into crafting some cheap meta decks when you're at rank 20
---
BBOOOOOOO bot. Shoo!
---
Ohhh I see it now. I looked for it twice and didn’t see it lol
---
*and got savage roared on turn 6*
---
What was the original card ? All I remember was that it was an even bigger man
---
worse ancestral spirit
---
Big Priest, Resurrect (non Otk version), Wall Priest. Basically any Priest deck that didn't kill you with Mind Blast or Anduin DK.
---
Razakus dragon priest in ungoro is what made me love priest. I hadn't found a deck I liked as much until i recently got ressurect priest to work in standard this expac. Then they nerfed the rogues i could beat, brought out pogo and didn't touch warrior. So I gave up on those dreams.
---
Assassinate, polymorph, hex, etc.
---
Kind
---
Kinda
---
I'm really sad to hear his response. I'm sick of lackeys right now, with only 3 months. I hoped for something like 3 o 4 really bad lackeys that made  them unplayeable. But then I saw the Shaman card they released and it seems that they are expanding that crap to even more classes. If any I think the game needs less lackey generation instead of more..
---
I want buff zoo as the Priest aggro option. I've been loving the Bwonsamdi deck even though it's not amazing and gasses out a fair bit. The 2/2 that gives a minion +1/+1 from KotFT was one of my favourites.
---

This, just add everyone you play for a while.  If they friend you just give them a gg or tell them you have a spectate quest.  After you have 10 or 15 people on your list you will generally always have a couple people online for this sort of thing.
---
Who are the 3 challengers?
---
Well, there's the steal cards like Mind Control and Shadow Madness, those are also work on the 'messing with minds' theme.
---
But yes, there's so much more they could do. Imagine using your psychic powers to directly harm your opponent's mind, resulting in actual damage. Some kind of Mental Blast (better name pending)) sounds like it could be an excellent fit, both as flavor and as a neat little trick to add to the Priests arsenal. Opens some fun alternative deck strategies too.
---
It's non-existent.
---
It actually hasn’t done that bad against token druid, at least compared to its usual win rate. You just need to get your removal cards early or steal a swipe or starfall or something. Using gonk and the cutlass to clear the board is especially fun
---
Don't forget how the absurdly oppressive cards then get added to the ever growing list of dominating options Priest have in wild.
---
As a priest main, I just want to have a base line of "can do things in standard" that doesn't result in hypertension for everyone else.
---
Cool post thanks for sharing!
---
Deathknights are practically nonexistent in wild at the moment, except for Guldan and a little bit of Malfurion. Maybe at lower ranks it's different. If you don't want to see DrBoom, come to wild.
---
I say throw the whole identity out the window, just give me Tempo Priest instead. I just want overstatted minions and blatantly strong tempo swing cards that also sometimes do Priest-flavorful things, like healing things or generating cards. Let Priest be the Spiteful Summoner, Dragons on Curve, Timmy class again.
---
Yeah, like some sort of card to combo with Velen's doubling damage. Considering how everyone else has burn, I wouldn't *mind* getting some. It would be a *blast*!
---
Control Warrior gets wrecked by big priest. It doesn't have enough removal to compete with the new tools priest received.
---
Dumb
---
Well if memory serves Kalecgos and Khadgar are about the same on heroic they just have increased starting mana. As for card draw see warlock hero power. 
---
I have no doubt I could beat the heroic version you make it sound like you only have 30 health.
---
Let me clarify if you couldn’t best Khadgar with this deck, like at all then it’s probably you.
---
Reporting back, this deck is amazing haha. 
---
It definitely took a few tries to get the hang of it, but I figured out what the better cards to mulligan for are and now I’ve been getting a couple winning streaks. 
---
You basically do your best to keep tempo and hope you get some value to get a finisher in, otherwise resorting to Tess against control decks
---
Who said I did? I'm still buffing and bluffing.  
---
\*desperately dragging\*
---
It stinks to know they aren't sure what to do with priest coming up next expansion. I suppose we will have to wait and see what happens, but things do not look great. 
---
In terms of things that would be cool to have, it seems like no matter what archetypes prosper, it'll be super annoying to play against if they get too many tools. At least that's what I assume.
---
 Currently in standard I believe we have:
---
Silence
---
Ressurect
---
Mech
---
Zerek/ Recurring Villain
---
(Maybe) Burn Priest
---
Deathrattle
---
Nomi
---
It's important to to note quite a few of these have at least in part a win condition of Divine spirit inner fire combo. 
---
Potentially silence could be awful to play against if they got too many silence cards. Maybe we have nothing to worry about, but if you had to play against a deck where every turn you could have your deathrattle or buffed minions silenced, that would be no fun.
---
Ressurect priest is weak right now, but if it gets out of hand we are just going to be dealing with an annoying wall priest with inner fire again. 
---
Mech Priest I am curious if it will still be around come expansion. It does rely on Inner fire, which is annoying. Perhaps it's tempo aspect will keep it alive through the use of Extra Arms, new cards, and inner fire combo.
---
Zerek is rad right now actually and it's so niche that I doubt it'll be a problem. However it is in a way like ressurect so I wonder if it would be frustrating as well if given too many ressurect type options?
---
RIP Burn priest without Mind Blast
---
Deathrattle priest seems nonexistent right now. I saw kibler play some, but other than that, nothing. This archetype could be intertwined with resurrect if they add a few more solid deathrattles perhaps?
---
Nomi was okay, but bomb warrior hold this class back. Not to mention this priest deck is very niche anyways and I can't imagine it adding many cards for this to be better. 
---
The logical archetypes to expand upon seem to be Ressurect, Silence, and some kind of tempo priest. Personally, I think more deathrattles would be cool to have.
---
TL; DR / Conclusion
---
Overall, none of these Archetypes are super good right now so they should aim for improving upon some of these that exist right now and hopefully not another new one. I just fear that when these archetypes in priest get too good, they become toxic and not good for the game. To answer the question, improving the deathrattle archetype would be awesome.
---
I am a simple man, I see a cat, I upvote
---
Sure, but it's just a game I play on my phone so it's not really affecting my life.
---
As stated in the title: This brawl is mostly waiting and that suits my daily routine very well. I just played my turn and had a minute or two to do something else. I could even prepare lunch while I waited for my next turn.
---
It’s a cosmetic item. If you wanted it that badly you should have just used a VPN when she was around.
---
Each individual boss fight win also counts for the win 5 games in any mode quest, which can be handy as the first encounters on a fresh run are very quick.

I don't know about "people" but this brawl is mostly waiting and that suits my daily routine very well. I just played my turn and had a minute or two to do something else. I could even prepare lunch while I waited for my next turn. It didn't feel terrible. It was fun. And I didn't lose that many games.
---
That sounds too OP, maybe give it overload (2) ?
---
Forehead
---
Now my 4.5 year old card back isn’t so special
---
Thrall
---
Plague of death is meant to be compared to twisting nether, and it's 1 extra cost reflects that it's an upgrade to it.
---
Mass Hysteria (A card printed in Rastakhan) is typically a better brawl and sees play in a lot of priest.
---
Archage Vargoth sees a TON of play in wild. They did not print that card with wild in mind.
---
In my opinion Priest's core should be big health minions with lowish mana cost so they can actually get some use out of their hero power on something other than their face.
---
I don't see that happening until they address the problem of Inner Fire, it really restricts what they can do with big health minions for Priest. Topsy Turvy isn't helping that situation, either.
---
Damn got 200 gold, guess it's better to reroll any of the card packs quests

Priest felt like among the strongest classes, I haven't played this one as much as the previous ones, but from what i could tell, there was a big shift in power. The 4 classes which are generally strong (Rogue due to combo, sap, cheap effective spells and hero power; mage cause of spell synergy; hunter cause of beasts and warlock due to discard) all feel weaker, specially mage which feels like one of the weaker classes.
---
It’s like playing the Rumble Run with the Shaman shrine that gives “your spells cost 2 less” and 0-cost [[Unstable Evolution]]: so many full boards of 10 mana minions of turns 2/3. Basically a free win. 
---
On the last boss (i.e., the only somewhat-difficult one), I was only able to get two minions to stick to the board, so I rolled the dice and got a Deathwing and an Emeriss. Still steamrolled that boss rather quickly.

1/-/- | Transform a friendly minion into one that costs (1) more. Repeatable this turn.  
---
They can get treasures from certain events or anomalies - mana bind was mentioned, there’s an anomaly that gives players treasures when they play 8-drops; they could get thoughtsteal from a spellslinger; etc.
---
Shaman is the new Priest.
---
It looks like you didn't read what I said. Inner fire is fine and flavorful for priest, but with Divine shield it just becomes remove everything or you lose, which isn't fun or interactive.  
---
If you get rid of divine spirit you can push priest in a direction of big minions which you can heal up to take control of the board, push in an extra 8 or 10 damage with inner fire not 40.  
---
  
---
What you don't understand is that changing or removing cards which could be seen as "Priest's only way to win" is a good thing. As cards like mind blast and divine spirit keep Priest reliant on them and make printing certain cards impossible.
---
I was wondering why I hadn't gotten Doomsayers in a while from this. Thanks!
---
7 health because the first part will deal 6 damage...
---
That's true, thankfully, Mage is getting Reno this set, not Warlock.  We'll see.  Destroy a minion for 4 mana is still super strong.
---
I missed it by 1 minute my first run, forgot that it was being timed. Definitely could have got under 40 if I hadn't thought about random decisions so much.
---
Wait they get a plague too? Oh damn, if it’s removal that’ll be pretty strong for control shaman.
---
I try to save about 4,000 gold through ever expansion. I buy a pack for every integer of a hundred (save for 200g, buy a pack, save for 300g, buy a pack, 400g, buy, etc). Once I hit about 2,000g my meta decks are getting topped off, so I save for every even integer of a hundred. I think I got 5 Shadow legendaries the last time I did this. Someone else called this overly complicated but the thing is: I need to enjoy opening packs throughout the exp and I also need to save for the next one, and this method works well.
---
Ooh I hate Instagram (Facebook) from disallowing people with accounts to see stories...they didn’t even come up with the idea...
---
I believe this is going to be one of the sleeper cards of this set based on first impressions. [[Blastcrystal potion]] was on the verge of seeing play and it had a very harsh drawback. This card's drawback, although bad, isn't the end of the world for the class with the best hero power in the game. This card also helps a bit with some of Warlocks weaker matchups atm, specifically being able to deal with giants the turn they are played and also buying some time vs bombs. Although I don't think this card alone will bring the class back into the meta, it's definitely a start.
---
Token Druids begone
---
Nice time. I won with Dr. Boom with a bomb deck and robes of gaudiness.
---
Sub 20 seems hard.

Typically yes, but this will rotate eventually. It’s allowed to be better than Flamestrike

4/-/- | Destroy a minion and one of your Mana Crystals.  
---
I'm calling this card as much better than you think.
---
Obviously. They probably didn't notice yet.
---
Random legendaries are garbage
---
26 minute win with Hagatha by Duplatransmogrifying all the minions in the adventure deck into Loyal Henchmen (+1/+1 in your hand every turn). You draw them all at the start of the game and just beat down the bosses real quick. Only drawback is the animation time for all the henchmen to do their handbuff takes a while.
---
It’s about sending a message

OPERATION BOUNCE:

M I S S I O N S T A R T
---
Flamestrike doesn't kill your board though so you can't really compare the two. It's more comparable to something like [[Felfire Potion]]. Still better, but not by that much.
---
Shaman is getting the Priest treatment of "One giant board clear per expansion"  
---
I, for one, welcome our new Shaman overlords.
---
&gt; And there might be some transform cases (Elise Trailblazer) where you turn cards into resources (random legendary cards)
---
You can already turn the extra imps into random Legends with Rafaam!
---
Do you know where I can find an unofficial list of these timers?
---
Blood Manos power creep in some way.
---
Ha, grats, I've been playing since beta and I just got my priest golden. Only really started laddering again since GvG 2 months ago so there's that.
---
yea the robes seem really strong since none of the bosses have a higher starting mana pool. Ragnaros is the only boss that has a slight advantage over robes but only for like three turns.

6/-/- | Deal 5 damage to all characters.  
---
Oops. Am dumb.
---
I save for 40 packs, open them, and Whizbang for a week or two until the meta catches up. I wonder if EVIL decks will be better when this releases.
---
&gt;Blastcrystal Potion has a smaller downside for decks that draw 20+ cards in a game, and it barely saw any play. 
---
Idk what game you were playing, but blastcrystal was an autoinclude in renolock.
---
When it all comes crashing down I need you, Hagatha
---
The difference between being indefinitely laid off and fired being what exactly?
---
In reality the difference only matters to the unemployment office.
---
21 minutes and 22 seconds with Dr. Boom. Pretty fun run.
---
that would have to be a beefcake buffed acolyte to survive the 5 initial damage.
---
22 min 27 seconds as Dr. Boom, double deathrattle mixed with bombs and starting each fight with 3 boom bots just stomped the final boss
---
The downside is that it is harder to combo with spell power to kill giants and it may come out too late against decks like murloc shaman. If it costs 5 mana with 2 overload, you can cast this turn 5 and still has mana for storm next turn. or play thunderhead+0 cost overload spells.
---
3,5 Stars
---
What should we name it then
---
yeah my first thought, there may be even MORE shaman aoe in this xpac. Although now that I'm thinking about it, that would be overkill so maybe their plague isn't so much an aoe but something more interesting like summoning tokens on both sides or evolving all minions lol
---
CAUSE YOU MAKE MY HEARFQUAKE
---
The drawback of Blastcrystal Potion was immediate, and, sure, it didn't matter after turn ten, but you're shuffling three cards into at least a twenty card deck (Roughly one in six odds of drawing the first 1/1 for a bit). With Life Tap, when one is drawn, the next draw is unlikely to be another 1/1. If you need to kill a minion now, having to pay two mana and life to draw a card a few turns later is more than a worthwhile payment.
---
Siphon Soul has repeatedly seen play within Warlock, and that's six mana to kill a minion. The three health wasn't insignificant much of the time, but getting to kill it for two fewer mana is more than worth it, especially if there aren't any better options for slower Warlock decks to kill Mountain Giants played the turn before.
---
But are fun.
---
I’ve done all of them a few times now. I think the easiest overall for all modes is hunter with the 1 mana.  It works great with the quest so you can still draft higher cost cards.
---
Nah, Shaman is pretty average in Arena. They don't have as many great cards in the rotation as classes like Mage or Rogue, don't have that many good proactive early cards(with the big exception of Totem Golem) in what is a very fast meta, and they're microadjusted down(meaning they get offered fewer good cards than e.g. the aforementioned classes). Your best hope is trying to draft control shamans, but that doesn't always work out, especially since they lost Volcano. But in general, yeah, I feel like overload cards tend to be better in arena because of the tempo a lot of them give you.
---
I don't know why you'd mention Windfury though, if you mean the keyword, then Shaman's only cards that matter are Whirling Zap-o-matic, which is pretty good and Walking Fountain, which is fantastic, but the games end fairly often before turn 8. If you mean the card, it's just bad.
---
Walking Fountain is a ridiculous card in arena that singlehandedly allows Shaman to play a control game in a heavily aggressive meta.
---
Having busted 2s like zapomatic and totem golem in a meta that starts on 2 helps  as well.
---
Been out for almost 2 hours now.
---
I ran boom with 3 hand of rafaam's treasure and beat it in 15 minutes
---
Do you have to get sub-40 minutes at first try to get goldens or does the timer reset every run?
---
Nope it's not
---
Can be good against soul of murlocs, sn1p sn4p, replicating menace too.
---
I was thinking it has a home in control warlock as a fatigue measure. Either way, I love this card design pros/cons.
---
It comes down to availability/opportunity.
---
When they brought the Mira Han voice actress into the studio to record her SC2 Coop Commander voice lines, they spent an extra hour or two recording HotS announcer voice lines too.  Heck, why not, right?

I think he was talking about Rand al'Thor
---
Also a way to refill after you thanos!
---
I mean, in most cases they're still better than 1 mana 1/1s
---
I still have to wait for like 15 minutes
---
Depending on how good "Reborn" is this can either by somewhat playable or very strong
---
Lol i did the same but got 24min first try, 15 seems like good rng draws with bombs
---
Is there a list of pity timers out there that you used for this?
---
Mostly spam clicking to make the curse animation quicker and bomb spamming.
---
Given this has the name of warcraft 3's far seer ultimate (Thrall was a Far Seer and could cast earthquake), it's strange it took so long to become a card. (also, the warcraft 3 ultimate just slowed movement of creatures and damaged buildings)
---
Also the other warcraft 3 Far Seer spells have hearthstone derivatives in the classic set.
---
Chain Lightning \[\[Forked Lightning\]\]
---
\[\[Far Sight\]\]
---
\[\[Feral Spirit\]\]

Dailies can be done in this brawl, except some class specific ones. 
---
Tested with Win 2 games with any class.
---
Warlocks be like "I'm the one that plays Mountain Giants".
---
Every run
---
Also, being able to discover or draft the Legendary Spell can create boards where your opponent autoloses.

&gt; Kingbane at least had weapon removal as a viable counterplay.    
---
Weapon Removal was not a real counterplay to control Kingsbane Rogue that kills you late game with a massive ~ 20atk weapon. It did slow them down and was a strong counter if youre playing a fast deck. The only **control** deck that I was able to consistently win with was Mage, and that was due to Water Elementals locking down their Hero. Teching in 2x oozes wasn't enough, and while I didn't like the Leaching nerf, it did make the matchup feel better.
---
I forgot to click the animations until the 6th boss rip
---
130
---
Just did the same thing. The Curses and Bombs alone did something like 32 damage against Ragnaros.
---
&gt; (I'm assuming this behaves like defile where deathrattles will trigger between damage intervals).
---
The card would be hilariously pointless if that were not the case.
---
That is one sexy chicken though.
---
Hard removal is hard removal, this card is great.
---
I have a creeping feeling that shaman plague card will overload both players. The devs have been getting more bold with their card design
---
He's not really a mister, he's just kinda mistery.
---
Well it's not Godfrey, but good enough.
---
Well flamestrike is crying at your post sipping a glass of whiskey
---
maybe, it definitely deals with soul of the murlocs quite nicely.
---
Good job! I'm currently working on my second, Valeera, and I'm kicking myself for not taking advantage of pre-nerf Wagglepick decks early in the exp. I'm certain I could've gotten her by now. Too bad the current meta is much slower.
---
Just encountered a bug where Evil Miscreant’s battlecry activated once (instead of twice) with a Brann on board. Replicated the bug it three times. Other cards’ battlecries were doubling properly.
---
Just a heads up if any devs are lurking.
---
Overload 1 for each of your own minions killed.
---
But that only ever matters if you reach fatigue. After playing Rafaam.
---
How often does that even happen?
---
I freakin hate warrior, but this is hilarious lmao
---
I think this card is a pretty solid addition.
---
4 mana removal knocks out giants on curve and it can handle big taunts. If you’re playing Rafaam, the downside isn’t that bad. If you’re playing in a zoo deck, the the 1/1s synergies with Magic Carpet and tokens in general. Yeah it murkies your draws a bit but only for 3. 
---
In control, it’s a little heavier of a cost but a 1/1 token can find its uses. 
---
Right now, with Conjure Mage being a high contender, a 4 mana hard removal is going to see some play because the meta dictates it.
---
I like this card. It's more intriguing design than the Priest Plague or Defile, which are comparable in being anti-sticky board clears. 
---
7 Mana deal 5 to all minions does a good deal of damage to most boards, the added 2 damage is helpful against Divine Shield or Deathrattle boards, which don't see much play in Standard. It's pretty good against Soul of the Forest boards in Token Druid and you can kill giants with this, if you have spell damage, which seem decently important. It's also a 7 mana spell to fetch with the Spirit of the Frog in a control deck, if you run the Stormbringer or Rain of Toads. It's added redundancy for Stormchaser fetching Hagatha's Scheme as well. Seems potentially interesting in Control Shaman.

Really like the card but it would be nice flavor-wise if it was 2 damage first than 5 damage since in real Earthquakes the second tremble is almost always the strongest.

/u/cgmcnama has written the definitive guide here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bisn5q/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_dragon/
---
i like this, improving the imp deck, i guess there is some mechanic too destroy imp from your deck or drawing a lot of them.
---
maybe a Demonic Consumption and demonic tyrant.
---
Or it's because your deck is 15 removal and AOE cards, some draw, and an uninteractable auto-win combo.
---
For comparison the minimal wage is less than 350 USD (after tax). So yeah, its hard.
---
I guess the golden cards you recieve from this brawl are "uncraftable".  Had two golden Villains already and can't dust the third I have.
---
What a terrible reward, why not just give a pack
---
Perfect release timing
---
Good bot!
---
Too bad u/adiopositas doesn't think so.
---
Well its shaman so they can already wipe your board with many spells
---
So don’t overextend :)
---
I would only agree with this if Blizz made a different black rock mountain cardback specifically for this event.
---
23mn for me with bombo warrior, i guess it's just a matter of luck anyway
---
I like Control priest with OTK win condition, still playing Razakus in Wild  btw
---
Finishing in 29 got me the back, the common and the rare. Nothing else.
---
For arena, flamestrike is 100% the better card. its difficult to take advantage of a symetrical board wipe in arena. in most cases, this is going to be a 7m twisting nether. okay but not great.

And reborn!

9/8/8 Dragon | Battlecry: Set a hero's remaining Health to 15.  
---
It's the brawl this week. It's a new dungeon run basically
---
Last year they did a brawl-only cardback. If you didn't get it first week you could get it on the second. Players that had it, got a classic pack like with every brawl.
---
only if they get the tools to take on control/bomb warrior lategame. another AOE is not going to be more value than boom.
---
Blizzard: players who don't have the card back will get it!
---
You: I have it and get nothing, I'm mad.
---
They said literally nothing about players who already have it, so yes, you are literally asking for more
---
The same Worthless Imp as Sense Demon, so 1 mana 1/1? 
---
It's hard removal with an interesting new downside. Polluting your own deck with dead draws is something you would want to avoid normally, but it might be interesting to prolong Fatigue, to avoid drawing Bombs or as Rafaam fodder. The Imp would also work with Flying Carpet, but that might be a lesser concern.
---
To continue this the Shadow Hunter from also has all his abilities in the game. It’s cool how they do this 
---
[[Healing Wave]]
---
[[Hex]]
---
[[Sentry Ward]]
---
[[Big Bad Voodoo]] - too bad this card has nothing to do with the ability...
---
No it wouldn't resolve deathrattle, it would resolve damage effects like dragon egg, so the whelp summoned would be frozen
---
I mostly play thief priest, but that's because I'm a poor F2P player who can't afford my own win condition so I have to steal my opponent's win condition. (Also it's great BM to smash the opponent's face with their own minion.) So I definitely want to see that kept alive, although maybe there are some new twists they could put on it. Other ways of using your opponent's stuff against them, like mass hysteria, could also feed into this archetype thematically without having to literally steal cards or minions.
---
Besides that, I think some sort of healing-centric zoo/tempo archetype would be good. The priest hero power is strong in strict numerical terms, and theoretically should be used to help make good trades in the early game and take board control that way. The problem is, priest doesn't really have good early-game board control minions, so they just end up doing combo decks or big/resurrect decks all the time instead, and it feels like the priest hero power is being wasted. Giving priest something like a 2-mana 2/4 with 'can't attack heroes' could help.
---
Minion buffs are good too, and go really well with the priest hero power. They seem hard to build an archetype around, though.
---
Some archetypes I think *shouldn't* be helped along are dragon priest (seriously, what exactly the fuck is the connection between priests and dragons supposed to be?), healing-as-damage (it's just way too hard to balance due to healing normally being less valuable than damage) and deathrattles (the point of healing is to keep your minions alive, and a deathrattle focus is antithetical to that). I'm also skeptical that silence priest is a good idea; I like the *concept* of it, but it seems intrinsically very highrolly and difficult to balance.

missed opportunity not calling it earfquake

The Sludge Belcher counter, 2 years too late!
---
Sure, it's usually harder to answer windfury minions in arena(just like it's harder to answer anything big - which is why big piles of stats are good in arena and unplayable in constructed), but they're usually bad enough that you see them very rarely(in the past 2-3 years we've gotten like two arena-viable windfury cards - Fountain and Stormwatcher). 
---
The only time I remember windfury being very relevant is the Un'Goro meta and Fledgling on 3/coined on 2, into windfury, into stealth/can't be targeted winning you games on the spot.
---
Should cost three
---
Spell Damage Shaman?
---
Not hard removal, deathrattles, reborn, and other effects are still triggered
---
Emerald goggles reduces the leftmost card in your hand by 2 mana, making it free.
---
That would be a very different card.
---
 You think you want a 4th quest but you don't.
---
Nice! So far, yours is the fastest I've seen. I managed to get 17 minutes myself
---
 in short yes.
---
Where Starcraft II at?🤔
---
They are all inherent in the data already since they came from a bulk opening that already factors in pity timers
---
I got 22 minutes with boom with a bomb build (which should be among the slowest decks) and not really doing speedrun strats, seems to me that just being fast on your turns and between bosses is enough to get the rewards. You can go for consistency without needing to focus on aggressive play.
---
Yeah I've been checking cuz I was blown away by my time.
---
I wouldn't say that. Cheers.
---
I beat it in under 30 with bombs and boom bots and mechs.
---
Did you get something for finishing in under 30 compared to 40?
---
Hey I'm all for it.  I was just explaining where the Mira announcer came from.
---
That's  almost 70x2
---
You can probably beat mine to be honest. Had some misplays along the way.
---
It also gets around divine shield, deathrattle and reborn so it's better than 7 mana deal 7 to all
---

I got 31 minutes with Rogue. Pretty fun

18:20 as Togwaggle. Just pick agro buckets and go face.
---
Wait a minute, it seems the HearthPwn is online after all. Weird.
---
Dr. Boom 38 minutes and 14 seconds. Cut it kinda close but I went way defensive cause it was a wipe fest on Garr on other villains. Other than him 1 shot every boss. Bomb as much as you can.
---
It's a little more than that. The Gadgetzan we see in WoW is essentially frozen in time. It hasn't changed since the Cataclysm. In the Hearthstone lore Tanaris's flooding meant that Gadgetzan could expand from a desert outpost to a bustling port city.
---
So the Gadgetzan we see in WoW is smaller because it's in WoW *and* because it's not a city yet.
---
I play Barnes...
---
Immortal Prelate -&gt; Annoying Prelate
---
Yeah got this second try with 2x Curse of Rafaam. GG EZ Blackcock Mountain.
---
It showed 2 each for me till I relogged. Then it showed 1 each (which I then dusted).
---
Ugh. More playable draw RNG.
---
This one often does the same thing as Hagatha’s unconditionally for only 2 more mana which is nice.
---
Nah. They don't necessarily need to bring her back. After this long, all I want to see is how Team 5 manages to fail, **to fail spectacularly in front of their player.**
---
I'm a hard warlock making  and this card is hot garbage. Warlock already had loads of answers to early between turn 4 giant/ voodoo doll + mortal coil and turn 5 bgh and then siphon soul on 6 and twisting nether on turn 8.
---
Anyone who disagrees can play my legend control warlock decklist
---
Maybe four mana, overload (2).
---
No, cause immunity prevents the opponent from targeting the minion with spells, last time I checked.
---
Hasn't been that way recently, but historically, priest has had several board-centric decks. Dragon priest, Rez priest, silence priest come to mind, but even in classic, they relied on a minion pressure.
---
Yeah, hagatha is a nooo gooo
---
Also fuck mech hunter and sort of fuck you mech war. I dig it!!
---
How on earth did you get 5 of those?
---
Drawing the card doesn’t necessarily mean you need to play it the next turn, and often you can’t due to Rain of Toad’s overload cost. I was purely noting on the fact that RoT can actually draw a card off of your spirit now, whereas before it couldn’t.
---
Should be reversed for divine shield
---
You laugh now,until I can that way play my JUMBO IMPS!!! a turn earlier but too late for them to matter.
---
&gt;Same.  Poor Rag didn't even get to break his weapon.  The boss that draws 2 cards every turn is hilariously bad against this setup
---
That bitchy dragon ruined my cool Hagatha control deck. It HAS to pay!
---
Used Dr Boom and lost with Ragnaros at 1 health...
---
Sigh...
---
I just picked rogue got robes of Gaudiness and picked all the Leeroy buckets
---
They do give a pack, less than 1 hour gives a pack for next expansion
---
Paid 5 mana
---
Is 40:16 too long in a bathroom stall? My leg fell asleep so my body says 'yes'

My favorite Priest deck *by far* was the Dragon Mind Blast deck from before last rotation. It was interesting because it skirted the boundaries between control, midrange, and a combo: You could play a pure control game against aggro and midrange decks or go more aggressive and try to burst down slower combo and control decks. The deck was flexible with no overwhelming matchups; while it could dish out an incredible amount of burn damage, to get lethal without Alexstraza's help you always had to be controlling the board and attacking with your dragons. And while it could control the board extremely well, it had none of the infinite value generation or insane late game value of other control decks at the time.
---
The Dragon Mind Blast deck made for some of the most close and exciting games I've ever had. One of my favorite memories was Mind Blasting a Hunter with a trap down to lethal while at 1 life and then attacking *hoping* it wouldn't be a flame trap. Another was playing a mirror match into fatigue and it coming down to the wire with my opponent healing as I tried to burn them before succumbing. 
---
But Mind Blast is now gone. That takes away the aggressive win condition that allowed such an interesting and versatile deck to flourish. I don't think Blizzard understands that what makes Priest fun for people like me is having *options*. I don't want to play a deck like Big Priest that just plays the same stale game every time, I want to play a deck that adapts and plays differently depending on the matchup and my decisions.
---
I'll do 3, I play on all regions.
---
Mine was only 32 minutes... but it was a 19 Oondasta with Togwaggles dice clown fiesta. Transduplimogrify is pretty sweet.
---
Turn 1: coin angler
---
Turn 2: rockpool
---
Turn 3: 3 1 drops, 2 tinyfins, everyfin for 0 mana
---
At this point, I don't think we'll ever see something as big as a new class.
---
I agree that players that have the card back already deserve something to acknowledge that they earned it the first time around.  I don't see the problem with a couple of card packs at least. Maybe even a golden pack.
---
I alwayd thought the Priests stealing was a reference to religion 'converting people' to their side.
---
But plot twist is a warlock card
---
Rush and bomb card rewards with one curse of rafaam was enough to finish in 33 mins for me. The wand that draws 3 cards and reduced their cost to 0 won me a few games too.
---
I had 6 booom boys start of turn. Got the job done.
---
I'd like the priest hero power to be permenantly changed to 'heal 2 and restore 1 hearth on your next turn'.
---
Transforming an imp into a legendary minion is no more valuable than transforming, say, a defile or a twisting nether. The problem remains that *before* playing Reno you’ll have to survive with useless minions in your hand.
---
Actually brings up an interesting point.  If Reborn isn't a Deathrattle, are we to assume it gets resolved at the same point?
---
That's an interesting design space. It's basically a great way to deal with sticky minions that leave behind a lot of weenies. (I'm looking at you, Token Druid!)
---
Seems fair to me. Assuming we're just comparing shaman clears, this is 2 mana more than scheme/volcano and it can't clear enemies &gt; 8 HP unlike those. It has some things going for it, like the double-hit, no overload, and being a good topdeck, but the mana cost and damage ceiling balance it out nicely, I think.
---
"You make my Earfquake"
---
You beat me by 24 seconds. I got it my first time doing bomb warrior. I had a disconnect that forced me to restart too. I was so salty thinking I was going to get screwed out of it. Really easy run.
---
Why are they giving away a season 12 card back?It was the one and only that I use
---
thats why you don't play into board clears
---
I wish we had two wild modes. One like we have now, except nerf some problematic cards like Barnes or UI, and another that has everything unnerfed. I want patron warrior with warsong commander back
---
Yeah, togwaggle seems op, got three of the curse treasure and was able to kill rag before turn 3
---
Did you get a reward for sub 20 minutes
---
Yeah it was successfull but kinda needed you to highroll the discards. I didnt like that theme of Zoo. I liked Warlock Zoo more as a honest board control deck.
---
even just making it 2mana would help 8mana total for 5dmg instead of 10 atleast then if you both in turn you can get max dmg and do something else even if its just normal hero power.
---
And for thematic a shadowform + surrender to maddness and spirit of dead+ bwonsamdi and mindblast as finisher for past taunts deck fits shadowpriest really well. you survive and then overwhelm with extreme dmg in lategame from mindblasts/hero power or huge minions and you reload with bwonsamdi.
---
Also what deck did u use
---
It's the "Curses" treasure
---
Where were Impbalming and Earthquake revealed? On the Hearthstone website? Or...
---
Nope, only 1 hour and 40 minutes.
---
People have done it under 20 minutes, there's a post going around with a guy beating it in 15 minutes.
---
i wish that was a rogue card tbh
---
This card seems to also be for tech against the new reborn mechanic. Plus it kills 8/8s with bloodmage thalnos
---
Impressive!
---
Three copies of Hand of Rafaam it looks like 12x3=36 so he just has to do 4 damage to get leathal turn three assuming Rag doesn’t play any of the spells
---
i dont like anduin basicly forever made shadowform useless as why do 3dmg if you got a board clear some health and a 2dmg one but its repeatable and is 1card vs 2.
---
&gt;Deathrattle only triggers after a spell/battlecey has finished.
---
Uh, you sure about that? Because Godfrey says otherwise.
---
Why not give it 7 health
---
I got 25 minutes. Deck was brutal. Had two of those your cards cost half, but you can only play two of them each turn and lot of big minions
---
he really is tho. just spam that hero power and they keel over
---
No, it matters if you ever draw the imps.
---
So shaman has basically become big mage. RIP mage.
---
Hero power? 
---
On a serious note I had a similar run with a deck full of galvadons, and while it was a little slow to begin with eventually the amount of huge monsters you pump out just overwhelms them
---
Rofl
---
Why does it bother you? It doesnt even alert you it just puts a 1 on your pack counter. Is that really such a big deal?
---
[There is not an special interaction for Ragnaros vs Ragnaros if anyone wondered...(very disappointed).)](https://imgur.com/a/crTeKJO)
---
It was said you would destroy the oger, not be killed by them!
---
It’s nice but it’s not totally needed in my experience I play builds with and without it.
---
Wait is there a list of rewards for certain achievements? That would change everything.
---
It's like that with every new content HS team releases. Mods are too lazy to make seperate  threads every time something like this happens
---
i did under 28min (27min and 59sec) with bombs and alot of them
---
[They were revealed on the playhearthstone instagram account's story.](https://www.instagram.com/stories/playhearthstone/)
---
Rafaam can turn most of those into legendaries
---
You can restart the run at any time.
---
Not just the first try.
---
the 7th boss got so lucky. Had a deck full of bombs and curses and he just kills me from 40 to 0 with two clockworks and some bs spells while he was on THREE hp...
---
Deathrattle and board clears!
---
Card generation value.
---
I mean, Anduin didn't make Shadowform useless. You don't see any decks playing Shadowform now that Anduin rotated out.
---
A sensible choice for Shaman would be to cast Hex on every minion.
---
One is a loveable,fun but not that good villian,that makes playing as and against such deck being fun.The other is a loveable,fun,hero that you need to make your deck around,and playing as and against the deck is boring
---
Not everyone. A vocal minority.
---
Thank you for posting it here then!
---
At least as importantly, the downside for blastcrystal only applies if you use it before turn 10.  Reno lock was a long game deck and single target removal is still good after turn 10.
---
Shuffling 3 trash cards into your deck stays bad until you're about to fatigue.
---
im on the grind team, i play 1h then i have nothing to do, and winning 30 game take too much time. doing adventures feels bad bc there is no reward after 1st completion.
---
I'm pretty sure this card will trigger deathrattles inbetween the two effects, simply because otherwise it would barely make any sense to release it this way.
---
And while it's true that effects which resolves deaths inbetween are usually either recursive (defile, godfrey) or chain multiple effects together (tess/yogg/shudder), [[poison seeds]] is a spells which does neither and still resolves deaths inbetween. I'm fairly certain we will have our second exception with this card.
---
Soooo you won a highly favorable matchup? Congratulations I guess? For those of you new to wild, no, he’s not some off meta crusader murloc shaman, he’s actually playing one of if not the most broken aggro decks in wild at the moment. 
---
And yes, I hate big priest as well, but this post is so pointless.

4/-/- | Destroy all minions and summon 2/2 Treants to replace them.  
---
In case you didnt peep it a few posts up, a Blizz response confirmed the interaction. Deathrattles will trigger between the casts.
---
Yes, but that means you have to not attack the boss’s face for the first 5 turns and will start off down at least 10 health on turn 5 even if you have a perfect curve
---
The classic set is pretty big 245 cards. Getting the card you want isn't likely.
---
I mean he did take lethal away from you..so he won.
---
Whats the curse passive?
---
Defile isn't the only spell with a forced death phase, and not all "cast this again" cards have one. The mechanic is used in various places when needed. Cards like Conjurer's Calling, which both destroy and summon minions, use one to clear the dead minion from the board and make space for new ones. 
---
Defile has one out of necessity for the spell to function, but Spreading Plague [has no death phase between iterations](https://i.imgur.com/re9WZsm.png).
---
It's one weekly card back from like 5 years ago. They didn't just open up all the card backs for people to buy. Kinda seems like people are trying to find something to be mad about.
---
Wow! I just finished within 22 minutes and thought that was already pretty good
---
Or maybe he get 40 min and 1 sec in the first run :)
---
&gt; 2 shimmerfly
---
&gt; 2 springpaw
---
&gt; 2 headhunters hatchet
---
&gt; 2 hench-clan hogsteed
---
&gt; 1 Scavenging hyena
---
To answer the original question, I find these most important in midrange hunter.
---
[deleted]
---
I won in 25 min with Hagatha adding 10 Grimmer Patrons to my deck on the second boss with the included Duplatransmorgifier
---
And *deathrattle - summon small minion(s)*
---
Have you tried Kibler's plot twist deck? There's a ton of healing in there. I've gone from 4 hp to nearly full in a single plot twist.
---
Does it work after you finish the update (bottom right) and restart?
---
Thank u for this tip
---
Finish... update?
---
This is a thing? Damn I always leave my games open while I do other stuff
---
Gotta show off that you played Tavern Brawl that one time.
---
I got it working again
---
Delays it by **up to** three draws.
---
Your game is being updated on the bottom right. At 91%
---
i remember that ds/inner fire used to be a noob trap combo that didnt really see much play and i kinda want to go back to that
---
Except the anti fatigue would be valuable against other control decks while the removal aspect wouldn’t. Seems bad in other matchups where a top deck answer could be important.
---
Idk hard to evaluate
---
I know. It’s been there like months
---
I've had it for almost a week now, it's not messing up my game or anything tho

if they want us to do it we need this counter.
