The problem is that unlocking all stuff with all 9 classes TWICE is a big quality of life oversight from Blizz, and that is somewhat unexpected, and hopefully patched up. It is somewhat of a turnoff for me from heroic.

---
---
I only had access to Mage.
---
And the first is ... Zilliax!

---
By double ... that's actually fucking insane.
---
The more talented PVE players are performing better. While not ideal, the format certainly has mechanics that reward skill, game knowledge, and enough RNG to keep the skill gap from being too huge.
---
Okay, yeah, that definitely seems like a bug.
---
Copies don't act well with the +2/+2 buff. On my first run I gave a Cave Hydra +2/+2 for the rest of the run, and in a later encounter with the Bartender I shuffled 3 copies of that same Hydra into my deck. Those didn't have the buff.
---
The Wisdomball was great fun. "It seems like your opponent started with a mana advantage. Why don't you start with one too?". "That seemed like a good card \[that just got destroyed by my opponent. How about we reshuffle it into the deck?"
---
After you complete all the wings.
---
I got a Quest Hunter deck with the 1 mana discount on minions and the *replace all the minions in your adventure deck with target minions* treasure. Used the treasure to fill the deck with discounted Hunting Mastiffs to easily complete the quest, then replaced the dogs with 0 mana raptors from Queen Carnassa. Full board of 3/2s turn 1 every encounter after I got the synergy running.
---
So do you have a tier 1 resurrect priest list that beats everything? Pls do share. 
---
All the best performing resurrect priest lists on hsreplay run divine spirit innerfire(currently rated tier 3 by hsreplay). The velen lists have even more bad matchups.

Just played a Y’Shaarj but I had Ysera, The Lich King, Madame Lazul, Deathwing and Temporus.

Turn 6 army of the dead into 2 Ysera’s 2 Lich King’s and a Deathwing
---
Dalaran Heist First Chapter Completed and opening packs received Heistbaron Togwaggle.
---
Or Mogor
---
There are a bunch of way more interesting cards than this imo
---
Its alot easier compared to the other runs. I've played 3 normal runs and 2 herioc runs and i still haven't lost. 
---
Some of the cards are super op and it ruins the fun unless you purposely dont take them
---
or they did more of a GoT camera thing. as soon as something remotely interesting happens, switch the scene
---
You also get packs in frozen throne
---
Why? Because sex hahaha?
---
Nah, cant be T1 when you lose nearly all your matchs vs warrior. High T3, maybe T2.

If you buy chapter 2 I think it is you get shaman and hunter
---
I always thought it’s due to the rain. 
---
But now I know it was indeed raining...
---
I disliked Heist, but I was a fan of the Boomsday puzzles. I'm just tired of Dungeon Runs, even though this one is better than all the rest. I hope Heist serves as a final iteration of the concept and the August expansion has something fresh and new.
---
Been stuck in this game for about 15 minutes now, waiting for the other person to concede :c 
---
Not sure if either of us can though, and I don't want to be the one to find out.
---
There’s some pve content you can stop mid fight and resume later. I’ve done it before. But I’m not sure if the new one is like that. I’m on the last fight currently and I’m somewhat busy. I have time to do half a match ish before I’d have to stop and resume later but I’d rather not lose simply from closing the game.
---
Better written dialog and with a more compelling character arc than a single motherfucker in Season 8 of Game of Thrones. 
---
Bartender Bob for the Iron Throne. Long live King Bob, first of his name!
---
its all the same thing as dungeon run, just with different skins.
---
Control shaman will never exist aslong as dr. boom goes unnerfed.
---
Play better in the final challenge and they win. It's not like Regis and toast were that far behind to begin with. 
---
Really wish these ball gargling fan boys would just get off trump and kripps dicks already. You look like fucking losers with threads like these.
---
This is true.  Thats why a lot of people are asking for conjurers calling to be nerfed as well.
---
Fuck D&amp;D.  
---
Ahhhh shit sorry reflex. Wrong D&amp;D!
---
Wait per chapter? That would be $100 for all the wings? Holy shit
---
Kinda frustrating yeah... I think I may ditch the standard mode after I beat it once and go straight to heroic because I don’t wanna unlock it all twice.
---
I regret not chosing that card. What does it do?. Occasionally helpful advices are really helpful?
---
This! They could have made it the friendly bar from the animated videos but instead we get generic wood copy pasta.
---
I’ll have to take your word for it but I honestly think if you lock your phone or leave the app for to long you’ll return to a loss on pve content.
---
What? It's 19.99 euro for all chapters.
---
I have the same thinking about tomatoes... why would someone spend money on that!
---
On the other hand, I'm loving Heist and I've been saving the gold to buy all wings at once (too bad I have to wait)
---
Wait. Is is possible to plug an USB on the first try?
---
And Archmage Ant.
---
Who needs meta cards when you've mastered the art of the SMOrc
---
Lots of effects, summon random legend, draw extra card, death minion back to the deck, copy spells, the text is the best wheb it activates
---
Beat heroic on my first run with the following:   
---
Orb of destruction (or something like that): deal 20 damage split amongst random enemies.   
---
0 mana bonus card: return the last card you played to your hand.  
---
Passive: +3 spell damage.  
---
Look at 4 spells in your deck and choose one to cost 3 less.  
---
Ended up with 2 mana deal 46 damage to enemies.
---
#JustBrazilThings
---
Open the Waygate FTW. I had a similar deck I went 100% with too. Except I took that advice dude powerup who kept giving me extra turns.
---
Personally offended at Pandaria being so low
---
The best part is they did not fix it
---
I pick the head in a ball every time.
---
Is that *really* a nerf though?
---
Aye, that guy just literally saved my messed deck.
---
I’m struggling to think of anyone.
---
O_o but how
---
Poor casters
---
Why does it cost 0?
---
It really doesn't surprise me Team 5 doesn't interact with a community as hostile as this one can be or Blizzard with any of their games generally.
---
Even then, card changes will most likely come out after the excitement has died down around the Great Dalaran Heist.
---
Slay the spire has spawned a myriad of clones, just go to steam - slay the spire and look at similar games. Some of them are actually quite decent, but dalaran heist already has more content than many of them.
---
Part of randomize means you see things on both ends of the rng. Really good rng and really bad rng.
---
Anybody know wtf this is?
---
We just gonna ignore the triple golds in one pack?
---
Are you sure it just doesn't look lazy and incomplete next to other content?
---
I hope you told him about Zayle lmfao
---
Sorry for hijacking but this means you can only get golden zayle using real money?
---
Or he just fucking dies.... Or the fucker switches sides.
---
But a lot of the time I drop him and my opponent concedes. It's usually nearing or at fatigue... or a hard board clear.
---
Not really they bring you to chapter one but you can just click on the right arrow and go straight to chapter two... and hence the purchase option
---
The animation ends at the edges of the oval on the card, anything beyond is not animated.
---
You can find the animations on hearthpwn and the wiki.
---
Triple Baron Geddon.
---
I sort of like the idea of a conversation between player and game regarding that:
---
"COME ON, HEARTHSTONE, I KNOW YOU KNOW WHICH FUCKING MINION I WANT, I'VE BEEN FUCKING BONKED IN THE FACE FOR LETHAL BY HIM FROM ROGUES LIKE SIX FUCKING TIMES TODAY! ***GIVE ME THE MINION I'M LOOKING FOR!***"
---
"... E-Er... Al... Al'akir?"
---
"... ***CLOSE ENOUGH.***"
---
Well you had a better Y’Shaarj than I did
---
Like I said it seems to be completely random, i've had games where he did literally nothing, or like 5 different things, I'm guessing theres something that triggers when he goes off but whether its controllable at all seems unlikely, it is very much a clownfiesta card
---
Here is a video with all the stats of amount of played card per pack. https://youtu.be/_LRmFN7Ih90
---
Long story short buy 10 of each pack for the guaranteed legendary. Rise of shadow is then the best value per pack.
---
Yes, downvote = "dont like".  You are correct.
---
You can gift packs to your friends through the web store, but unfortunately there is no gift option at the moment for the heist. I'm trying to find out if that is intentional.
---
/u/blindspot189
---
I think he's saying you're so lucky.
---
I actually like tracking progress separately in heroic mode. It's a different mode with "different" bosses, so it makes sense that you would track it differently.
---
I am asking if this minion showing up in a ranked match is an error. Seems like something was coded wrong back at Hearthstone headquarters.
---
Champion, i've been looking everywhere for you. The head in the crystal ball? I'm trying something new.
---
This is memorised into my brain
---
cool lol, can't wait to play heroic for more of a challenge
---
thanks! do you know if you can craft the golden version?
---
You can't dust vargoth
---
&gt;In a way, I was lucky that they waited a month to release this, because it allowed me to accumulate the gold required to buy the wings without having to pay real money for it
---
I've been doing nothing but hoard gold since Rastakhan came out, and I've managed to buy over 20 RoS packs, too. Though, it was nice having time to grind up gold before the Heist came out.
---
Explanation: Bob set one of my Baristas to 0 mana. I was able to Barista my Barista with a 2nd copy, and I got infinite 0-mana Barista Lynchens in my hand that gave me more 0-mana Baristas.
---
According to yesterday's vS data reaper report (issue 130), Rogue is no longer the strongest class. Token Druid has resurfaced recently, as people stopped teching against the matchup.
---
The thing with the deck is, it's only really good at doing one thing, so if it becomes remotely oppressive, people will start teching against it again, and its playrate will drop once again.
---
It is a very simple deck though, very good for new players, so good job picking that up.
---
??
---
Bwonsamdi, the Dead is a collectible card in Rastakhan's Rumble. I have him in my collection.

---
This dude looks like Baldreich from Overwatch who kind of looks like me with a beard...Blizzard do you need a IRL model?
---
Honestly, my biggest complaint is that it only lasts 8 bosses.  Why not have an endless mode, where you keep going through harder and harder bosses until you finally lose?  If I get a deck that I like going, it's sad to have to stop playing it after the 8th boss.
---
i'm pretty sure sherazin would still be a creature.
---
It's really broken english. It should read "Recast all spells you've cast this run, on this minion".
---
That's not how the meme works
---
I mean, between the bugs and the spelling/punctuation errors I really have to wonder if they just shoveled this out the door.
---
Hey remember you made this post and then now warrior is obviously tier 1? I really hope you learned your lesson.
---
The head carried me to my first victory. It like did 2 bad outcomes the entire run (changed a 2 to 5 drop and double casted an irrelevant spell)
---
Didn't met him yet :(
---
Anyway, these bartenders are great idea. That's the thing i needed in dungeons we've seen before.
---
Fun Fact: Night of the Full Moon was made by Peter Whalen.
---
But I don't feel an urge to play it again...
---
You're right though, I will try again. But again, I think for me the issue is not so much replayability, but how much it feels like strategy/thinking is winning vs just RNG fiesta. Which is funny to say because absolutely Dungeon Run had this as well! But I think it was done more flavourfully. So far to me, Dalaran feels really all over the place
---
I wish all the trailers were released in the style of their animation shorts. They’re so good.
---
From what I've noticed, it just improves their hero power pretty significantly. Personally, the normal mode was way too easy, so I prefer the extra challenge.
---
That's a totally different effect then what's on the card.
---
I like the difficulty here in heroic. Decent failure rate so far on the second level. I feel like heroic in previous adventures was always 2-3x harder than normal and you often had to seriously cheese the boss in some way.
---
I don't get this guy's art style. He looks like nothing in Hearthstone, even more so than Barista Lynchen.
---
reddit is for discussin. this post should be kept
---
Found another bug where the game was stuck. I was fighting the guy who could only take 3 damage at a time, had an effigy in play I got off shifting scroll. He killed my Lich King popping effigy, however the shifting scroll image remained floating on the screen and nothing happened. Had to close the app and open it again, it reconnected to the game and I was able to finish him off.
---
Yeah, I just don't get that much satisfaction from "proving myself".  I'll play through Heroic at some point, but I'm not really looking forward to it if there's no new strategic twist that's not in Normal.
---
Dammit Khadgar
---
Ok I hope you're right stonekeep and ikkewo, because that's what I plan to do. 
---
I've been saving up gold to unlock all the wings so hopefully it doesn't screw us over and not let us get it in a few weeks once we can purchase all the wings with gold. Thanks.
---
And I unpacked both these beauts. Yay. I can disenchantment them both for half of a legendary and the high chance to unpack then again.
---
I frickin lost my run on the carousel boss on heroic. He was the 2nd encounter
---
Me when I don't trust others to do group project
---
This would imply that for example if you put sound the bells on other minions then every sound the bells would be cast on it. When the effect it has now is just lynessa between encounters
---
I lost because I had the “your cards cost half but you can only play 2 cards per turn” because my hand got filled up with his coins and I couldn’t dump them.
---
You're stuck playing the first run over and over if you don't pay.  I think that's enough incentive.
---
Makes me think of Ultima
---
The OMEGA LUL treasure. So much fun.
---
Happened to me on a buffed scalehide. My scalehide was buffed to a 3/5 and after using Dupla on it poof no minions
---
Did you never play the old solo adventures? They were literally all staggered weekly releases too!! Why are people bitching about this now? Staggering them keeps player engagement for longer and makes perfect sense.
---
Where do you buy those chapters? I can't see it anywhere in game.
---
Did you read the cards he gives you? lol
---
I guess im just confused, what is unplayable?
---
He's exactly what they said he was gonna be, so im happy
---
i assumed he'd drop 2, but nothing...
---
maybe because he used the spell and thought "cool now all my minions cost less. i'm gonna coin out this vargoth and play that other 1 mana minion
---
I have also got:  
---
double draw.  
---
Ensure go first.  
---
Healing face.  (I guess, didn't see what happen. He said losing health will die)
---
3rd time lucky!
---
Looks like the menu screen of Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus.
---
Bob gave me the opportunity and I wanted to see if Whizbang did anything... he didn’t :(.
---
Yeah I’m glad I didn’t bother to even watch this.
---
Some of the possibilities are just crazy. I had the 1 mana hero power to reduce a random card by 2 mana in your hand. 
---
Upgraded to 0 mana cast hero power twice each turn.
---
Combined with minions which on inspire add a random spell to hand and refresh hero power.
---
I’d have a full board by round 4 and a dead boss. Insane.
---
If you only pay with gold, at least you're not losing any money.
---
It doesn't feel new, but I enjoy playing it nonetheless. The difficulty on normal is quite low, but since there is a heroic mode that isn't an issue.
---
My only real complaint is the late and staggered release. Just let me play the damn thing.
---
Just leaving a short comment to add a very positive opinion. I really enjoyed playing this game mode as soon as it released and for the next 2 hours. I haven't tried heroic yet but I shall give it a shot this evening. This solo mode is really, really cool. Best points in my opinion:
---
* Heroes are exactly what I am waiting from a crazy and wonderful universe like Hearthstone's;
---
* The flexibility in hero powers, starter decks, encounters with Bob and bonus power cards makes the runs very smooth and entertaining;
---
* Replayability is excellent and will probably make me want to come back for a long while;
---
* Bob cuts the tension between matches by giving you some time out, which feels nice;
---
* The idea of the random imprisoned minions in the second wing is great, it feels really cool being able to prepare for them freeing themselves;
---
* Toggwaggle.
---
Thanks to the dev team for really fun this solo mode, can't wait to sow chaos through the other street of Dalaran &gt;:) .
---
I think they come in "sets" and those "sets" are randomized.  But I'm not sure.  Probably an extensive post somewhere. (For instance, with KnC, there were "Jade Lotus"sets for Jade synergy cards)
---
Alas bartender bob, you were too good for another shitty overtuned single player 'content'
---
Definetly.
---
But this content to a small degree restored my faith in blizzard.
---
And there is to my mind a possibility that they patch it.
---
Blame Bolsonaro
---
I had the same thought. Literally the only thing I could come up with is that the Trolls have a Jamaican accent :/
---
I'm going to look through the cards now and will report back
---
I've only completed the first run so far with mage, and it was the biggest disappointment of every dungeon type of runs theyhave brought out. Not a single boss made it to turn 10, not a single game was even remotly close. All I had to do was play random cards and win on turn 5-7... Easy to say I'm not buying the rest.
---
Its unlocked already if u bought it
---
[removed]
---
Rogue only has the best set nowadays because it's only set that hasn't been majorly nerfed (apart from Priest, but we all know how good that one is).  Like Zalae mentioned, Edwin only feels oppressive nowadays because literally every single one of his counters has been nerfed.  He really wasn't that big of a deal when every class had a good answer to him.  
---
Unfortunately, the way the balance adjustments are going, we'll most likely just see more Classic nerfs until every core set is as miserable as Priest's.
---
Now that it's actually out, we can finally know the answer:  They cut back on the free PvE compared to previous offerings.  So if you don't pay, you get less than before.
---
I love tavern!
---
I wonder if there are ways to have more than two coins to spend!
---
Bob is great, but, he isn't the only one who can show up as a friendly encounter, I had a different bar tender, bartendotron (probably spelled that wrong), all the minions I could recruits were mechs, it was, odd, but nice to see that you can get a different bar tender
---
THANK YOU! I wanted to make a post about it too, but saw yours so I guess I'll comment on it.
---
As a person who LOVES the PVE content in HS, this is the single greatest adventure they have done and always wanted. 
---
&gt; In short, Dalaran Heist seems to:
---
    Address the drafting issues in Dungeon Run
---
    Offer FAR, FAR more replayability than Monster Hunt
---
    Allow you to choose your loadout easily, unlike Rumble Run
---
    Afford a huge degree of customization when deck building that NONE of DR, MH or RR offered
---
    Have a whole new suite of fun bosses with great art, voice lines and hero powers / decks
---
    Bring back a heroic mode, just like the oldschool adventures, for the masochists of HS! &lt;
---
Those are the points I wholeheartly agree on and wanted for so long. To customise, play different Hero Powers in different mode settings with different treasures to try out and trying to build some wonky ass decks and try to overpower the opponent, is all I wanted in PVE adventure.
---
The playability is so huge, I am not sure if I ever gonna do all the stuff on the other Battle net account/and Regions I play, probably do all the classes and deck combinations on my main account and do just Heroic and Normal on the other accounts.
---
But yes, so far I just love it, I am gonna buy it with money, cause it is worth it imo, from the standpoint of someone who really likes the adventures in HS.
---
I also agree on the problem, that Heroic and Normal have seperate versions and you have to unlock everything again, that will be tough, especially in Heroic where bosses have the most nuts decks (looking at you Big Priest &gt;_&gt; )
---
So all in all I am happy!
---
Nice finding!
---
It would have a much higher winrate this way, allowing the Dread Corsairs to be played for free. Then we will probably have to nerf some other rogue stuff too to stop Rogue's universal good matchups bar warrior.
---
Happen to me as well. After few times it worked. Didn't even cause me the game!
---
While with GoT we all lose.
---
Rush flavor. It is like raspberry...only faster...
---
A hero we dont deserve
---
It's just the rain, obviously
---
Sorry!
---
Before my time but I think they did back in the very early days but I can't recall what it was (I read it on here a while ago but forgot)
---
Manduin*
---
The meta is warped around rogue. It is going to stagnate. You can wait until then if you like, giving you some more time to play Waggle Pick Roulette for hours on end, or you can open up the meta to allow a variety of viable decks.
---
he straight up prevented lethal for me, gallywix copied one of my fireballs but i let it play out and he makes me immune LOL. i forgot the voiceline but it was something about bringing ice block back.
---
Won my first Heroic run with this, the Bartender modify that allowed me to have 3 additional copies and the Deathrattles activates twice passive.
---
Destroy 5 treasures in the treasure room, beat every 8th round boss in dungeon run, form quel'qadar or whatever it called...
---
good bot.
---
It look like the original DrBoom scheme to me but got discarded because of imbalance
---
I think he meant that it is the same book in both cards
---
Prolly mech hunter since u rly  dont need a legendary
---
Classic Yogg
---
The name of their show is based on the wow in-game toy from legion, I'm pretty sure
---
Reinstall?
---
Wooooosh
---
Both, spected and depressing..
---
Thanks, so if I buy all the wings with gold I will unlock it aswell?
---
Yes, but you can’t buy them with gold until the rest of them come out.
---
It would have been playable without any upgrades
---
Indeed i'm an idiot. Thank you for taking your time explaining what was obvious
---
nope
---
The meta is the same with slight difference in representation due to the rock/paper/scissors nature of the meta. It have been stale for weeks an is already stinking.
---
Also with Prep the tempo loss is minimal compared to the hand refill
---
Well thats what this mode wants from you.
---
Stacking Synergy.
---
that is what im hoping for, rogue, conjurer's and maybe something in hunter (not sure what?) nerfed. even touching dr boom rush would be good
---
It summoned the darkness and casted a flamintorch on my face
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; Anomaly mode
---
what is this? How can i select this mode. I purchased the adventure with money
---
I'm not that guy but Nether Portal is absolutely nuts. Particularly if you have the passive that gives you 2 armor for each friendly minion that dies.
---
or wipes me, it depends on his mood i guess.
---
I got the same thing on my first run. Was fucking hell, but I beat him by topdecking the card that stole his whole board (was completely full), getting a nether portal and randomly generating an ice block (which he popped the turn before I won)
---
It's good, but can screw you over a here and there too. The half cost cards but only able to play 2 per turn is my vote for most OP as long as its the first treasure you get. It was even fun half way through the run with how easy it was.
---
Damage definitely didn’t work one time though. He had 8 health, went over to his turn and then he played the cursed card, still 8 health during the whole thing.
---
Well-spotted. It was a speedy censor though, so pardon me for not obscuring all the details.
---
I don't see the golden candle
---
&gt; you have to replay 10 times .
---
100 times. Its all luck dependent like always.
---
I got a passive card that randomizes the cost of all my cards at the end of the turn, and a 9 drop that let's you discover a legendary and summons 5 copies. At the end of my 2nd turn it made it cost 2, so I was able to play it right away.
---
The more money you throw, the more likely you are to get a response from RNGesus
---
If that's the case, It's just a 25% chance the Vargoths don't cast the spell again. Not terrible odds, but better to save the other Vargoth for when you pull the spell again. It's all the singular verbiage that threw me off.
---
"Draw your entire deck then fatigue till you die."
---
Try Heroic, its brutal.
---
Not true, my Shaman deck was far from "perfect everything" both times and still won easily.. Unlike normal mode heroic isn't auto win, but it's still much easier than dungeon run for a decent player (especially if you've played Slay the spire which helps with the bartender... Friendly tip: almost always fire everyone)
---
That’s a lotta damage!
---
I recently created a new account and my experience was quite pleasant. All other players are beginners as well so these type of situations are extremely rare.  OP just had a luck with opening Zilliax and Conjurer's Calling. If he had net deck then he must have put quite a lot of $ - which would be great. It's great  that there are new players who wants  to pay for the game allowing others to be free to play.
---
I thought I was the only one. First time completing any adventure, probably due to the fact I had 20 C'Thun’s in my deck at 5 mana a pop. 
---
Congrats man.
---
Yeah, it would have been a surprisingly well-balanced card without upgrades imo. It’s a [[Shield Block]] where you trade 4 armour for “deal 1, summon a boom bot”, which seems comparatively bad in a world where [[Shield Slam]] exists, however I can see it being viable as part of a draw engine with [[Acolyte of Pain]] in mecha’thun/other combo warrior. One boom bot is also much more valuable when it has rush, i.e. after [[Dr. Boom, Mad Genius]].
---

I did 1 run at normal and 4 at heroic, it's way too easy. In the last 2 runs I was making misplays here and there and definitely playing suboptimally to meme. Chose some treasures just to experiment even while I didn't think they were optimal. Still didn't manage to drop a game.
---
though tbh the last 2 runs I got the girl as a boss and she was extremely easy, Galywix is tougher and if you misplay you'll drop games.

I dont disagree with you the solo content should be challenging but, just look at how well received this and previous solo content is despite the ai being dog shit. People looking for challenging content clearly aren't the target audience.

Thats basicly the gist of it. I think youll get the idea. I dont have the second  Loose  Specimen and I dont really want to craft it either.

How does that ring cost 0?
---
Honestly as I look at it, I do wonder if the AI is messed up with cards like this. Most discovers add to the hand and there can be a few cards worse adding to hand, so I wonder if the AI chose the best card to play, not the best summon.
---
Play 8 cards in 1 turn, end turn with full hand. Freeze all enemy minions every single turn.
---
Ahhh that's a good shout actually
---
Yeah that would make sense
---
But also make no sense

Spaghetti code strikes again

Am I the only one who thought academic espionage was the goblin throwing a book?

I'm disappointed in the low difficulty of normal mode, personally. Maybe the later wings will be harder, but I want a chance of losing in normal mode, and so far I haven't come close. I don't feel like I should have to play in heroic mode to lose, but I guess they're hoping to attract more casuals this way.

Original Dr. Booms scheme was HAGATHAS scheme.

Yeah they wanted to give Warrior more board clears.

if it works like Whizbang, yes.

3 in 260 because 3 minions on the board.(+Darkness)

What do you mean?? You get two alternate hero powers per hero, 4 starting decks per hero, anomaly mode, and generally just a good time from playing the adventures.

There shouldn’t have to be monetary (real or in game) reward for finishing. Just enjoy the game.

If redownload didn’t help, maybe contact blizz support. I didn’t find any solutions.

Having this issue as well. Hoping for a fix soon. I would like to buy the adventure but I can’t even do that right now.

"I'll cast that for you again - on a *random* target!"
---
This caused me to draw 12 cards and end up in fatigue.
---
It's because of the bodd whose passive hero power is "spells cost 0 the turn they are drawn", making the ring cost 0 instead of 9. I just happened to draw it turn 1.

He's not speaking for you, he's speaking for "Paul Marketing" who works for Blizzard/Activision

You could at least offer some apology after being such a blatant dick about trying to prove me wrong, to then only be wrong yourself.
---
Anomaly - reduce cost ofall cards in hand by 1
---
Elixer - when you play a minion, shuffle 2 copies into your deck (they cost 1)
---
Stargazing - your hero power costs 1 less, can be used 2x per turn
---
Hero power - rude the cost of a random card in hand by 2
---
Not the craziest thing he's ever done

Forgive my ignorance,  what is netdecking?

....Tell Paul I said hi.

Will the update take another few days?

Yeah, I suspect they are starting us out easy and ramping it up.

you get a special voiceline for having millhpuse on your board(not dead) when you beat mallificent.

And for those who haven't encountered her yet, she shuffles a millhouse into your deck.

Alsp has a voiceline if you have 2 millhouses on board

or Naturalize, Polymorph, Shadow Word: Death, etc.

I've lost yogg on the first cast several times, still salty.

Wtf. How lucky do you guys get? I'm 30 bosses defeated with mage and 0 completions.
---
Remove one from your deck is fantastic. You're almost always guaranteed to have one card from either your starter deck or a bucket you didn't really want to grab. Remove all also gives you a really interesting choice. As long as the card(s) you're tossing are worse than half of the other cards in your deck, it's worth throwing them away. 
---
If you're not using dismiss to thin your deck, you're doing it wrong.
---
I like Slay the Spire quite a bit and perhaps the fact that this is a LONG way from being that is what leaves me unimpressed with it. I'd rather just play Hearthstone Multiplayer and Slay the Spire when I want solo content.
---
It also doesn't work with The Mistcaller, in that if you happen to, say, get 10+ Miscaller battlecries off, it remains at it's "base" buffed stats.
---
F2P for one year here and already opened two, AMA.
---
I'll break it down into 3 parts:
---
1. Belnaara, the boss, has a hero power that makes him immune for 2 turns after taking 15 damage.  However, Kripp probably thought it meant "once reaching 15 health remaining" and didn't think it would trigger again after already triggering once earlier in the game (note the fireballs bring him down to 14, then 8 before becoming immune.
---
2. Kripp attacks his remaining minions into [[Gahz'rilla]], massively boosting its attack and failing to kill it.
---
3. Before Kripp dies, the Wonderous Wonderball passive triggers one of its possible abilities; automatic Ice Block before you die.
---
Hope this helps!

7/6/9 Beast | Whenever this minion takes damage, double its Attack.  
---
Oh I agree with you that it's a strong event to have in your run but just because it's strong, it doesn't mean that it's not repetitive and lacking in content.
---
yup, any "special offer" - can't resist
---
To each their own. The simple fact that it is fun is why I will play it a lot.
---
Are you suggesting the only imperfect aspect of the AI’s play its picking of discover cards? Because that’s obviously false.
---
The original comment was a joke on this treasure, you stupid idiot.
---
Your opinion my dude. Be grouchy but the gold was for the fun per wing, not the gold. If you try to view it that way of course you’ll get upset.
---
Behold, the tools of creation!
---
Pyros' Deathrattle triggers first which returns it to your hand (it's not generating a new copy). When that zone transition happens, the second Deathrattle is wiped. 
---
Exceptions to this though would be cards like Anub'arak or The Skeleton King.
---

---
And a lot of Galvadons fucking
---
The real question is "Why would you remove it?" it's a cool post about two artworks that tie in. Just because there is a pack in the background doesn't make it a post about that. This is not the government site it's a post about a digital card game stop being so strict on your rules and let people post whatever they want.
---
It just wouldn’t let you play it if you had two health. It’s impossible to kill yourself with health costing cards.
---
Yep, Zombeasts are another example of a modified card.  Basically, if the base text or stats of the card could be literally anything, its modified.
---
Just wish it was a little challenging. I've only lost 2 runs in normal and haven't yet lost in heroic. I don't need it as hard as some of the past ones where you need outstanding RNG in the buckets, but it seems the opposite here where only the worst RNG will allow you to lose. 
---
Hopefully the next chapters up the difficulty a bit.
---
With difficulty concern aside it has still been fun. I'm allowed to pick some fun options for deck building and treasure and be able to see the whole run through.
---
Having stealth or inmune doesnt allow the opponent to target your minion, so taunt becomes useless. You can also see how if you stealth a taunt minion, the taunt-broke effect sounds and the shield thingy becomes transparent. The same soound it does when you silence a taunt minion a break his taunt.
---
I'm just replying to say thank you to you and every mod on the team who works thanklessly and regularly at this. I've been enjoying this sub for five years. HS subs are more or less all I read on reddit and like 30% of what I read on the internet.
---
 EU Hawk#2287 - Trading 80g, i'll show first but please go first. Thanks
---
IMO these heroes are not representative enought to be a Hero. Or you would swap mighty Uther for a paladin who gets lost in the jungle, fails to save his friend and now serves the league of E.V.I.L ?
---
The best villains have flaws. I'm glad Hagatha finally has one.
---
Look, maybe the other minions had 7+ power, and you gotta play around those BGH blowouts man.
---
What decks do you get from zayles? Is it the same as wiz bang?
---
If you are talking about One Night in Karazhan, well, I am of the opinion that the replay-ability of it was very low. Compared to the other adventures, it ranks lower for me. (League of Explorers and Naxx were more fun,  not sure which of this and Blackrock I enjoyed more.) I played it through once for the cards and then again on heroic. If you like deckbuilding against known opponents and don't mind a bit of RNG in your challenge for heroic, it can be fun.   
---
You get a bunch of wild cards, but most aren't relevant in Wild. Notable exceptions are Barnes, Maelstorm Portal, and Medivh's Valet, which I've seen played in Wild fairly recently. There may be other cards that are interesting but it's all wild only.  
---
If you wanted to try out the old adventures, I think League of Explorers was the best of the bunch. Reno, Brann, and Finely are all fun cards in wild too. And the content was pretty good. I haven't played them in forever so I can't say how they hold up to recent standards. I think the Frozen Throne content is fairly similar to the old adventures, and is free but I feel it was significantly more difficult than the old adventures.
---
So far I've opened 7 legendary wild cards and 4 have been Hunter
---
&gt;Or you would swap mighty Uther for a paladin who gets lost in the jungle,
---
Yes, let me swap Gul'dan, one of the most well-known Warlocks in history who helped orchestrate multiple plans on behalf of the Burning Legion throughout Warcraft and World of Warcraft, for some random gnome riding on a bog creeper. Yeah that's definitely fitting.
---
Oh or you know what? I'll swap Uther for a fucking Annoy-O-Tron that got knighted. Because yeah that dude DEFINITELY serves the light. Uh-huh.
---
Finally, while I actually use this one, let's swap MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS THRALL who led his people from bondage and defeated Deathwing, for a murloc shaman. Yeah no that's totally acceptable. /s And yes I'm aware he's supposed to be a really great shaman but I fail to see what makes him or the others indicative of ***hero***, that someone like George lacks.
---
There are three situations where you should buy this with money (assuming you want to buy the PvE at all):
---
1) You want to spend an extra $20 to get more packs.  This is the best value for $20 currently.
---
2) You want to "downgrade" from a preorder, and buy this instead because it's cheaper and similar value per dollar.
---
3) You always buy everything.
---
If none of those applies to you, you should buy it with gold.  If you don't want the single-player, you shouldn't buy it at all.
---
Big load of bullshit, the answer is money
---
Yeah those are fair considerations. However I do think cosmetics could be sold much better than the first three heros. 10 bucks is a dumb price for badocally one new picture, however, 10 bucks for a few cosmetic packs with random chances at various alternate art, backgrounds, cardfaces, board doodafs, etc are totally in line with their gambling microtransaction model.
---
Anyway, it's a moot point, everything is so locked in and deeply integrated I'm sure any one of these cosmetic opportunities would give some coder a migraine to even think about doing.
---
Yeah, and if there weren't packs locked behind it then I would probably strictly play on Heroic.  But since I have to win to get packs, I'll play through the first round on Normal, and then Heroic is just the same thing but harder.
---
Deathrattles don't remember whose side of the board they were initally summoned on.
---
Which is still absurd. They're willing to experiment with what they offer for preorders, but NOT what skins they sell or what prices they sell them at??? What sense does that make? Like I'd understand if they just went "well this was a failure so we don't want to do it again" but they're literally messing around with preorder offerings every single bloody expansion so really there's no excuse, in that regard.
---
Are you sure?  What if everyone is just puppets, given lines to sound smart, and you're the only smart person alive?
---
\#YOU DARE PLAY WITH FIRE CHILD?#

The Gimmick about akazamzarak is the fact that he is a real world magician in the world of warcraft. In Dalaran. The city of mages. 
---
So what makes him special in the city where you will find elementals around every corner, Books randomly fly about and people levitate stuff they can‘t reach? He claims to not use magic. In a world where magic is ridiculously common, sleight of hand becomes interesting and exciting. People are interested in his performances not because he uses magic, but because he is not. 
---
Now Goblins really like to cheat, he still uses magic. Like his hat has a portal to a pocket dimension filled with bunnies. Or the likely explanation that he used convoluted magic to get the finger trick going.
---
I don't see it as a Hamster wheel. It's the difference between playing Hard Mode and New Game+. If you start with everything unlocked, you never have to beat the content with the more limited decks and options. Given that the difficulty of content is so heavily reliant on what cards you end up getting, it would be pointless to go into Heroic with all of the most broken options already available with nothing to earn.
---
No
---
Yea I didn't and got Baku and the other guy non golden instead to use them in standard.
---
Plus crafting it is not the same as getting one from a pack.
---
What does that card even do?
---
I assume 'battery' is supposed to mean 'battlecry?'
---
Arthas.
---
This in-universe explanation of my joke  just highlights why I love Goblins in Warcraft.
---
Delusional guy who doesn't understand that making games is a fulltime job spotted
---
Didn't they give us a free golden legendary around nax? The tauren guy that gave a power cord to both players?
---
Can confirm. When I got banned for 3 weeks in League of Legends for verbal abuse, I was in a really rough patch in my life. I was taking my anger out on random people who were just trying to play the game. 
---
If this guy is sending friend requests to talk shit, he is literally going out of his way to be a dick. There is a .1% chance he is actually just the man and he wants people to know it. The other 99.9% chance is that he is having troubles in life.

This will reveal the whole rogue’s hand to her opponent therefore nerfing this card to oblivion

So basically it comes down to paying for the rewards and it isn't worth it. I rather they take the rewards out and give us the dungeon run for free. Even if they priced it fairly it's still not worth it.

Lol, sincerely... thank you for this post
---
Sry for the misunderstanding I really understand your problem it is annoying to play against net decks in casual if you are just trolling around, but on the other hand I am not that confident to just go into ranked i even play 1-3 games with bots to start learning the deck and get a feeling what cards to keep or just how to play it correctly. And in those situations i am happy that not everyone is trolling around in casual because it is nice to play net deck against net deck to learn the matchup and how to play it. As i already mentioned i really understand your problem and i am sorry for probably reacting wrong hope you'll have a good day. :)
---
It's not about catering to a demographic.
---
It's about acessability. Loads of games die because they make it more and more difficult to enter the game by adding complexity. 
---
The people can become die hard fans. But that only happens when the first hours are enjoyable. 
---
If you like it or not, that is one of the factors that play a role.
---
This will confuse new players.
---
I get your disappointment,  i remember the amount of time it took me to get my second legendary only to be a copy of the only other legendary I had....
---
I get the 0 mana +2/+2, but how does it always start in hand?

I've been known to mix up Maiev and Alleria on occasion.

It's actually not bad if you dont die turn 4

Last time they posted on a hearthstone subreddit was a month ago, asking if [[Feindish Circle]] is playable in zoolock.  (Plenty of other reddit posts since then, including gaming posts, just not about hearthstone).
---
I mean, asking if fiendish circle is playable is not even a terrible question; plenty of people run microtech controller in Zoolock (just a lot of synergy with Knife Juggler and Mountain Giant).  Fiendish Circle is run in about 5% of Warlock decks in standard right now, and more in wild (though not because of zoo).  It’s not an unreasonable question.
---
But the kind of person who needs to ask about whether Fiendish Circle goes in Zoo is probably not the person to tell us what needs nerfing.

You also had to get old adventures to remain competitive. This is completely optional, generally better than old solo content in gameplay, and does come with rewards that can be seen to make up for at least half of the cost of entry.
---
Believe it or not, it’s a compatibility issue. Delete ur cache, open the app, and rotate the screen so it’s facing the other way and it should work.
---
The pity timer wasnt implemented until KFT or Mean Streets i think. Even then its "guesstimated" to be around 200-400 packs.
---
Seems about average
---
just don't buy it if you think it's too expensive. it's not an expansion so you don't even need to buy it.
---
Yep, happened to me once already in the fight against the eye dude.
---
Whats the color of vengeance?
---
Taking the Warsong approach, I see.
---
Maybe they can put the rush thing on a separate hero power thus making the 7 armor rarer or even replacing the microbots.

Zul'jin costs 10 mana and relies on you having drawn and played your good spells already.

---
On your phone I'm assuming. I ran into the same issue. Close the program and reopen it. It took me 3 tries to get through.
---
What I think is going on is that the game is trying to reconnect you to the state that you were in when you were playing a dungeon run (maybe you were in the middle of a game), but its timing out. After a few attempts, it just restarts your match (not the entire run)
---
after several minions attacked my hero, he froze all enemy minions and asked if I feel a chill

Play a game where more development is put into the customer experience as opposed to just churning out more money generators.

If you want to know who won:
---
Turns out, an infinite amount of 11-damage fireballs that only cost 4 health each are, indeed, very good at killing the opponent.
---
how do you unlock chapter II?  
---
I don't even see an option to buy all chapters!

Agreed, but near the end of the last expansion DK Rexxar was a real pain in the ass. Single-handedly carried hunter's late game.

---
You dont have enough yet
---
I don't like single player content. It's a waste of time and money.

My favourite card also. Having a blast limiting all those decks that need to play more than 2 cards on a turn and if they don't they fall behind.  
---
Ensure to partner it with Deadly Shot to keep them mages at bay.

Seeing some hybrid mech/secret hunters lately so wondering they perform better than the current standard secret hunter package.

Combo works better because its a rogue card. Fits better with a keyword thats very specific to the class.

I have started to auto concede to Warriors. Way too many removal cards, and then Boom for late game. Simply not fun.

What rank are you because im pretty sure everyone knows this card
---
Isnt Biteweed also a combo and is literally the same effect in bad? I am not sure if i remember the card correctly :/
---
I had a deck similar to this that comboed Luna into 6 1 mana Lich Kings every turn. One game, the AI pulled all my big drops, so I won with random Jaina + Aluneth + infinite water elementals.
