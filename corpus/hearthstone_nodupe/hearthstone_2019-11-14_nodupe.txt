kinda... yeah!
---
A brann and only murlocs/amalgams would be the sickest board of this murloc would be in the game. Sure, they cannot resummon anything, but give them so many health buffs and poisonous and they don't need to resummon anything.
---
---
---
I bought it for me, then gifted twice, if u like hs pve, slay the spyre is that on crack. 
---

---
Super good game!!
---
who taught that "The Beast" would be a good card???
---
I absolutely love this combo - honestly I feel like the best ban would be arcane missile.
---
I agree with this in principle.  The problem isn't even with murlocs, it is with amalgams.  Getting poison on an early divine shielded, 15/15 amalgam at Tier 4 is gamebreaking.  Moving Amalgam to 3 would help a little bit.  
---
I would be much happier with Toxfin moving to 5 if there were another feasible Murloc added to the pool at 4.  I don't know what Murlocs in the current pool would work there though, but I have a few ideas:
---
*Hydrologist could make some sense.  There is precedent for secrets in the game from the Akamzarak.  
---
*Finja could work if it somehow summoned random Murlocs upon killing something.  
---
Scargill would work if it changed the cost of Murlocs in the Tavern to 1.
---
In the main game, this isn’t a problem. Cards that can do something are highlighted for you.
---
So for instance, in battlegrounds, if a card can give you a triple, it should glow, like it does in the main game. That would be a start.
---
In the main game, if you played Loki, you’re shown all 4 cards to choose from. Having 6 cards to choose from only happens at tier 6 in battlegrounds, but could be done very easily.
---
The mode is in beta for a reason. It’s no longer a ‘tavern brawl’ as it was originally meant to be. It’s going to become a real game.
---
Does hiding the effect of a card help new users or not? Seriously?
---
I don’t get the objections to this?
---
Those aren’t totally different games. Battlegrounds is.
---
Its pretty easy to get this comp everygame
---
Personally I think the most successful playstyle is rat pack/ scavenging hyena decks. early game beasts are solid, including the previously mentioned, and can be really easy to build up. Lots of different effects and more end game minions like mama bear, ghastcoiler, and Goldrinn. And of course, amalgam.
---
I've lost a few first places due to this. Came in second despite knowing what first place was playing as it's just us two left, but didn't have enough time to rearrange my board and upgrade/swap stuff at the same time. It usually happens if I'm playing big mechs and magnetising a lot of stuff
---
It isn't even the optimal strategy.  Getting a golden junkbot is certainly not a win either.   An early lightfang enforcer is far more significant.
---
Don't attribute to big brained ideas what can more easily be attributed to laziness
---
Hearthstone battlegrounds = 0 iq
---
would be nice to see the board of the opponent he last used against you. Like a screenshot you could literally do and put on your second screen. 
---
But that would be too much to ask for.
---
Toxfin should be 6 star
---
What the actual fuck are you on about lmao, I have zero of the issues you are having, and I play movile only
---
Shamanstone
---
That's just being silly. There's as much difference between Arena and Standard as there is between Standard and BG.
---
Shamanstone Evolved
---
You’re really gonna say that when this post is about an entirely new game mode?
---
Anyone gets crazy laggy on their phones after like 7 rounds? It gets so slow to the point that I don't even get to do the recruiting phase. I'm literally just A.F Kaying after that man
---
Ye, nice theory you have there
---
He was surprisingly decent. I don't know how good he really is, but upgraded, he has like over 10 health I think and gains +4 attack per popped bubble
---
TBH, I don’t think that goes far enough to make Evolve viable.
---
Make it Charge instead.
---
Game has been out for a day. At this point it's more about how much you've played than how good you are. One because time to grind, Two  because most people are new so it's testing your ability to quickly hit the skill floor than hit the skill ceiling.

1 health on Patchwerk. Golden Brann. Two natural Battlemasters, one Shifted Zerus. All 3 Battlemasters gain 59\*3=177 bonus health. Golden Battlemaster gets 2+177\*3+59\*6=887 health before buffs.
---
Ikr. Funny how people still find a reason to complain about blizzard actually trying to add more content and features to the game.
---
I mean, in fairness these cards were given to all players so you didn't have to still own them
---
Looks like he just got a buncha toxfins because the adapt your murlocks dude is six stars iirc
---
That's like 5 more minutes you devoted to me. Fucking idiot

In all honesty the Monster Hunt characters feel kind of generic to me and this is based off their personalities and stuff, she just isn’t that interesting.

Was looking forward to playing Brawliseum for the whole week. Something to pass the time until the expansion. Looks like that ain’t happening anymore. Shame.
---
this design is pur garbage like the whole game, it's so rng and blizzard is keeping it like that. well i guess gg and hs is a dead game until the end of the year.
---
Your MMR gain or loss is based on your comparative MMR with your opponents, it's not absolute. 
---
If you play with, say, 5 opponents ranked lower than you and only 2 ranked higher, your MMR indicates you "should" finish third. If the disparity between your rank and your lower ranked opponents is high enough, that can easily result in you losing enough points to those lower ranked players that you lose rank overall.
---
I had access since day 1 but hearthstone wouldnt launch on my laptop for like a week and I ddint wanna play mobile because it's always been trash, and so I've only been on BG for the past 2 or 3 days. I havent played a ton
---
Muhammad Abdul?!
---
What planet are you on? Nobody’s getting anything back.
---
Do you not get last place and lose points just by immediately conceding in the first round?
---
Yeah, I was already planning to farm it like crazy, since this one was a bit more accessible to me than they usually are, and the high win rewards are amazing for a mostly f2p player like me. I hope they at least give me the rewards for the run I had going
---
I think it's just a bunch of red tape that they have to go through to change anything, so waiting out an event or card rotation works easier for them as developers.
---
And that's why demons are low tier because the cards that is a "must have" for them comes out to late and beside the invulnerable his actual buff is kinda meh. And then your whole strategy is about the one or two big dudes you have from playing a small demon every turn and selling it. Not that great in my eyes.
---
I do, I lose -7 for 8th place but if someone concedes before me I can get 7th place giving me +0 or even +1 sometimes ;-;
---

Wait, maybe I missed some news, but the wild cards are cycling out come DoD, right? On the site it says:
---
**"IMPORTANT NOTE:** While these cards were re-introduced  during the Doom in the Tomb event, they will remain in Standard past the  event's conclusion, until the launch of our next major update. More  details will be shared, including exact end dates and times, in the  coming weeks."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I assumed next major update meant DoD?
---
Why would you do this? to smurf?
---
Probably for matchup making.  I'm guessing it's just another rank.
---
It's free to play now though....
---
for fun? i already got bored of the actual game once i hit 5600 i had more fun conceding to -5002 than playing the game lmao
---
Oh ok well today I learned lol. whoops
---
Ah yes, it is working for me, so it works for everyone else!

Honey Badger DGAF. He need to be immune to all abilities tho. You got taunt...fu, you got a divine shield...that's nice fu, poison....tickles fu.

For real, I was trying to type something to my friend on discord after I finished my stuff and was waiting for the rope to burn out and the auto combat to initiate and i couldnt hear myself think with the constant voicelines.  Please let us squelch the bastard that let all those villains into dalaran.
---
Kripp started a account on EU with just 2 heroes, and is kicking ass anyway
---
I did - and I only played one a turn to ensure the Battle cry triggered twice.
---
Got Sir Finley of the Sands from a quest pack today. I was deciding whether or not to craft it as the last missing card from my Highlander Paladin for weeks. Figured it might not be worth crafting given that Dragons looks like it'll be strong and the meta is fucked until that comes out with Evolve Shaman. Now I don't have to worry about it! Love that upgraded hero power
---
This is such a silly brawl to begin with to make arena. With 3 card decks you're going to have such polarizing matchups, there will be a few that snag early 12 win victories, but eventually either the winrate will be 50-50 because everyone will run the same deck or there will be counter-metas which will have very clear victors. Basically as rock-paper-scissors as you can get. Being stuck using the same deck for 3 losses just makes it that much more polarizing.
---
This brawl sucked ass
---
It's an advantage. But that's just the way they chose to monetize it. Essentially free for hearthstone players but outsiders gotta pay.
---
This is so bull. Sigh.
---
This is unplayable on mobile.

Its the goddamn 25th year anniversary of Warcraft, honestly was expecting a cooler reward. Next major anniversary is 50th one and I doubt Warcraft will still be a thing then. I certainly won't be playing a childrens card game 25 yrs later.

---
Yeah guys, give em some slack, they're a small indie studio
---
Watched Tips with Kripp and his Top 10 Heroes and it did actually help, thank you. I guess that means I should re-watch them and likely the rest of his, and then some other people, lol. 
---
I've played probably a dozen more games since then and though I lost my way down to almost 3000 MMR I'm slowly climbing back up as I learn (~3300 now). I've gotten 5 top 4's since this comment thread started, and 2 of them were top 2 -- still no 1st place since the tutorial, but I don't want to climb fast anyways so that seems like a good thing.
---
I'm still having problems with animations making gameplay slower, limiting my tavern time, but I'm learning to try to avoid large amounts of Deathrattle and "Whenever..." effects, and especially cards that double them. Obviously opponents do not though, especially the Murloc hero and people going for Beasts or Mechs, so it's still often 20 seconds of hell trying to do anything at Bob's =))
---
I've had golden replicating in the late game when just saving good things to throw on Amalgam if the opportunity presents itself.

You can give foe reaper divine shield

80g trade AndreBR12#1630
---
Obviously not related to the balance of the game's content so much as the game, but I think some animation changes would help make the playability of BG more balanced all around. By that I mean they could remove/stack/optimize-for-speed the animations, where reasonable.
---
Minions attacking the hero could easily be a single animation of the stars all *coming from them* at once to buff the heroes attack rather than the stars going to them and then returning one at a time for the attack buff. The fact they come from the hero to the minions and then return to the hero doesn't make much sense anyways, and is a waste of precious time.
---
Many Deathrattle and "Whenever" effects would be far more reasonable if they have the full effect animated at once rather than one at a time, especially when using the dude that doubles a players Deathrattle effects ([[Baron Rivendale]]?).
---
When most animations start whatever they're for should resolve even if the timer is up immediately after, with an obvious exception being effects that need a target chosen, other than Discover which will pick automatically. No good reason we should be able to put a minion in play or use our HP and have it say "Too late!" when it already animated and has to then animate returning the gold cost or the card to our hand/the tavern. It's also arguable that Discover shouldn't auto-pick, as it's used for the triple rewards, but because it is a "real mode" gameplay mechanic that would likely require some pretty good reasoning.

I believe it's a visual bug only
---
I normally go for mass dispel against N'zoth boards. Also afaik he only offers Stall when you dont have enough mana for a board clear. He offers twisting nether quite frequently in my experience.
---
I don't think it's necessarily *intentional* but I think, like the WoW team, the Hearthstone team has realized that they make the vast majority of their profits right after a new expansion releases and then both profits and user engagement drop off a cliff. WoW has basically been "farming" the expansion release hype since MoP. They even straight up said they wanted to release 1 expansion each year starting with WoD, but they were simply incapable of doing it. 
---
I think HS is in that cycle now where all that matters is that a new expansion came out and people pre-ordered their super mega ultra FOMO bundles with exclusive hero portraits. Doesn't matter if they just quit the game 2 weeks later because the meta is shit, Blizzard got their huge bump in revenue and will simply bide their time until the next one.
---
Oh wait a second. The pool of minions in the shop is shared? Or what do you mean starving each other out?
---
You really need to see what happens during the fight though if you play this wanting to improve your rank.
---
It’s less variety since you have less options
---
The mobile issues aside, I find this game mode super compelling, but I won't be buying packs to upgrade as I almost never play the "main" modes anymore. I suspect I'm not alone in this camp, as your post indicates. I wish there was an alternative option to spend gold/money to upgrade.
---
*Where are you hiding?*
---
Yeha it’s dumb that you can’t experience the full game if you didn’t get the preorder.
---
i though its gonna be over before the next major tournament
---
A minion, but what stats? my soul sensing abilities tell me it should be a 2/3
---
Nothing special about 6666 sorry mate
---
Idk but liberate Hong Kong
---
This is really unintuitive and I've definitely lost a game because of this.  It needs to be stated in the tutorial when triples at taught.
---
&gt; Brann 
---
ahh ok ok thanks
---
Workforce vacancy. The lack of urge to hire more game designers. They did NOT think it was a good idea, they thought it is AN idea. No peer test probably.
---
Yes please. His slow rolling of cards in solo mode was annoying already, I want to slap his face every time he opens his mouth. Imo he does not fit at all in the fantasy world of HS, more like a character from Happy Farm Simulator.
---
If only they told us this somehow.
---
With 1 person
---
You could be right. But I still feel very rushed sometimes in the late game when there are triples to adjust to. Having to refresh a few times, find a triple, buy the triple, place the triple, get the free card, play the free card, discover a card, decide where to play the card...
---
I'm sure I will get better, but this game should be accessible to those that do not have lightning fast APM.
---
Meanwhile can we also get an option to mute the "crowd" and reduce the crazy screenshake?
---
Blitzchung was an inside job!
---
Political speech doesnt melt steelbeams!
---
I have, it's definitely the worst thing about the game mode. I've asked my friends to play it too, but it just seems lame to do it individually when we could all play TFt or Underlords together.
---
every other auto battler game lets you set up private parties to play
---
I've played on both. The animations still steal your time on PC. Especially when you've got minion generation, poison, shields, etc. Seems unfair that other people get to start in the Tavern and get more time there while you're watching your guys generate forever to win a battle that is clearly over.
---
Yeah, just 1 person. In other games you could queue up with 7 other friends.
---
You gotta mix a couple beeps and boops in there to make it legit /s
---
and his father's eyes
---
Do you really think the game director is going to come out and say, in all seriousness, 'the new expansion includes a broken combo, I asked them the developers to change it but they refused.'
---
Battlegrounds is shit, why not have some fun by dropping your MMR as low as possible
---
Exactly. Same with Khadgar.
---
At low mmr maybe, instantly killed with poisonous  otherwise.
---
That it what i meant lol
---
(From their interviews) it's quite clear that for the short to medium term, Battlegrounds is a loss leader and purely an engagement driver. What they currently have in place works, it'll probably be something along those lines (cosmetics, small perks etc).
---
&gt; Does anyone know what happens when i sell a golden copy of a card? Are three regular copies added back into the pool?
---
Yes.
---
This is why in TFT you can’t queue with more than 2 other people in ranked.
---
Well it already costs some money to play the full game. Since you can't get a third hero option without buying the preorder.
---
That's part of the game. Gotta learn how to make quick decisions.
---
Lightning fast APM is what I'd consider Starcraft II to be.
---
You're talking about something like, maybe, 60 APM in Battlegrounds, and that's if you're in rush mode. That is *not* terribly difficult. Especially when in later stages of the game you do have a minute or more a lot of the time, and you do *not* need to do 60 things at once. Even if you rerolled twice and got 3 triples, that is... what?
---
2 Rerolls
---
1 Sell
---
3 Purchases
---
3 Golden Copy plays
---
3 Tier+ Discovers
---
3 Tier+ Plays (assuming you use all three)
---
Moving minions on the board
---
15+ actions? That only becomes problematic at that stage of the game if you took your sweet time. That's ~4 seconds an action, which is by no means lightning fast.
---
The game is accessible to those without lightning fast APM, but in the end it should not cater to just that group. Speed in decision making and execution should be rewarded. Dilly-dallying about for 30 seconds deciding whether to roll or buy should be part of your consideration, and it should teach you, just like in Starcraft, that making a good decision fast is often better than making the perfect decision late. And the best players will become increasingly better at making the perfect decision on time.
---
You don't want to taunt it, you'd rather it sit back until all the posion are used and the tokens are fighting it out.
---
the subtext should be Honey Badger
---
YOu do get more for reaching legend tho...one golden common :&gt;
---
Hero power, 2 gold, cast silence on 1 random enemy minion?
---
You can't do an entry fee system. In Arena matchmaking is based on wins/losses, so you get rewarded for playing well. However, an MMR system ensures that players will approach average results in the long run. You do well, and you get rewarded in the short term, but gaining MMR would be actively punishing. Not to mention there's simply no valid reason to have it. In Arena it serves to stop people from rerolling decks. 
---
While some sort of monetisation isn't unthinkable, it would be bad PR to start with no barrier to entry and then add one. I think the current system of unlocking small benefits for buying packs will remain the model. Maybe some customisation, although I don't think HS is really the game for that.
---
Seems short sighted, as if they are assuming all players play all game modes. I hardly ever touch the "main" modes and I don't think I'm unique I that. I love hearthstone outside of ladder/deck building because they've made some really fun gameplay. If I could get unlocks by buying arena passes or a pve expansion, I'd buy them with the unlocks as justification. I haven't bought a pack since the first year of hearthstone because I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to keep up without significant money investment. I play casually and battlegrounds are great for that - you can figure out the meta within a few games and you aren't fucked for not having certain cards. I would absolutely spend money to improve my brawl play if there was an option aside from current expansion packs.
---
The bonus perks will be locked again every time a new set releases. So if you're f2p that means you'll have to wait ~1 month (maybe?) before having access to the perks again without pre-order since you can't buy packs for gold before the set is released.
---
Climbing is easy, super slow but easy, yes. Only got up to like 5k1 myself before I got tired of the mode. 
---
But really some games: luck makes everything. Spending 50 golds in rerolls and never getting your 3rd minion, going for a tribe then after like tier 4 you just don't get anything for it, being offered good or bad heroes right from the start (now it looks like they're fixing this one), sniping buff minions early, hitting that big guy with your only poisonous ez win because you hit the 1 in 7.
---
I mean, all this is the point of the mode. But not for me thank you. Might still play once in a while, casually, no hate but I expected a better adaptation of the genre.
---
Zephrys has always done this.
---
fUn aNd iNtErAcTiVe - make sure to preorder 100 packs also, ye$.
---
I'm personally fine with it being a small advantage. 
---
It's unsustainable to expect this game to have constant updates while simultaneously not supporting its development. And in this case, it's a pretty big update in that it's an entirely new game mode thanks to their investment of more developers to the game. However, any major investment comes with an expectation of additional revenue down the line, so trying to encourage players to buy packs is a fair compromise.
---
I read that with ingame Gold bought Packs also counts, as long its the newest Expansion Boosters :D
---
&gt;Create market-based system so players have the option to buy a standard deck directly instead of having to open packs 
---
That already exists with the Dust system, and adding a secondary market wouldn't make the game's economy any better.
---
Idk bro I personally just got bored with the game and gave myself a goal of getting one of the lowest elos in the game if not the lowest elo. So I did a grind I thought no one else would do. I conceded over 1000 games now it was over 100 just a little over 100 to go from -3k to -4k. I enjoy the grind personally. Way more than the grind was when I was around 5600 going for 6000 got so boring.
---
Yeah honestly the game feels very one dimensional atm. Draft a snowballing card like hyena or junkbot, make it gold for good measure and easy game. Once they do some more balancing and add more minions i think it will be more fun.
---
Is that picture from Wasteland 2?
---
20 packs, not 30.
---
I can't believe this post is getting upvotes... i had many heated arguments on how busted evolved is as a card 2-3 years ago.

"Triggers twice"
---
Not 
---
"Triggers two times as much"
---
So, if you say something triggers twice, and it triggers twice, it just triggers twice.
---
It'd have to be 3 gold at a minimum, probably 4 though. Think of it like George's Divine Shield power but an offensive tool instead of defensive. I'd personally be willing to see where a hero like that would fall on the tier list.
---
Sounds like a typical late game unit to me
---
The Pokémon conspiracy?
---
Shudderwock doubles Battlecries. You stay Tavern 2 / 3 all game and cash in on those pogos.
---
It's generally a great design philosophy. If you make things that people want or ask for, generally you're making products that are mediocre or safe at best. If you're making things that people never knew they wanted, that's when you get into innovative and brilliant or just crazy fun games. Battlegrounds is a good example of that. I don't really think there were many fans asking for a HS take on autobattlers and yet here we are. People seem to love it and it's bringing streamers back, and other streamers who never played the game before. The thing is that sometimes that design philosophy backfires and it's in those cases that companies need to realize they made a mistake, fix it and not repeat it again.
---
That one hero skin a year cash grab for easy money.
---
Some things to consider:
---
* Standard is how this game makes money. This mode doesn't get made unless it feeds into the part of HS that makes money. 
---
* You need a barrier to prevent people from making dozens of smurf accounts in order to game the MMR or clown on noobs (both things are really bad for the health of the game).
---
* The actual barrier to remove this small inconvenience is very minimal. Roughly 1500 gold and 5 free packs (and only need to do it every 4 months). If you have experience in HS, you realize how easy this is to achieve, with very little time commitment.
---
9/300
---
Doom in the Tomb was an interesting idea but I hope it's an idea they don't plan on revisiting for a really long time. I'm not a fan.
---
What a turd, def won't see play.

Good idea. Battleground is more estranged from the base game than arena or solo content. By a large margin.
---
Keeping Battleground posts in this subreddit will not only bother those who are only interested in "real" Hearthstone but also confuse newcomers.
---
he probably sold them and rerolled for them
---
Dragons will be added in Descent of Dragons I imagine.
---
Yeah, that's fair and I imagine lifesteal would have to either get reworked or disabled. Armor gain should be safe to include past tier 3-4
---
Because Arena and Solo Hearthstone still follow the core ruleset of the game. They are formats, not an entirely new game.
---
Well you do get the feeling he left because he didn't like the direction the game was going... Shudderwock was bad design for sure though.
---
Well, it's also stupid that you can make a minion that has 100+ health and then put a taunt on it. So, you can't have one and not have the other.
---
They could make minions in the future that are resistant to poison or trigger AOE effects if killed by poison. It would create more counter play and minimize the effectiveness of the buff.
---
It's not irrelevant:
---
1. Rat Pack.
---
2. Zapp Slywick.

There's no reason to change something that isn't broke, even if these two cards did not exist. This is especially the case since they could always add cards that interact with attack damage like Zapp Slywick, or even something that reduces the Attack Damage of certain minions - and if you reduce a Poisonous minion's damage enough that it becomes 0, it no longer deals damage, meaning Poisonous no longer takes effect.
---
Yes I know, that's why am asking when is it coming back
---
I think Rogue with N'zoth + Shadowstep + Togwaggle's Scheme is a bigger problem
---
You can’t. Like I said, you can easily get it for free the week the new expansion comes out. Meanwhile, it adds an incentive to preorders that avoids making the game P2W, just like including hero portraits does.
---
I'm pretty sure they will let you use the old expansion pack count until you can buy packs for the next one with ingame gold. Everything else would be stupid and significantly different from how they use to handle stuff like this.
---
Clear
---
I just can’t imagine that if it had started at 4/3 you wouldn’t still be complaining.
---
The email from blizzard states "upon release of the next expansion" so it's unclear. I would guess that they remove the features as soon as pre-orders are available to have another reason for people to pre-order. Not too bad imo
---
It is checked by cleave and ds. Plus removing poison would make high health minions very strong. 
---
But I agree that poison can be so high rolling and unfair feeling.
---
I can understand why Team 5 has had the Doom of the Tomb last as long as it did, but it did lose its novelty rather quickly.
---
Your comment contracts itself. It’s easy to get buffed to 50/50, which implies almost everyone should be able to pull it off meaning you’ll have a 50/50 which should be able to match theirs yet then you say the only way to deal with it is poison.
---
Finally something that wasn't posted billion times. And for the answer: no
---
He means Shudder/Brann -&gt; Gentle Megasaur, gives you two chances to roll Poisonous. Doubling Toxfin’s battlecry does nothing unfortunately
---
He used megasaur to adapt all his murlocs most likely
---
Just pulled a Japeto Joybuzz
---
You can double battlecry megasaur to get 2x adapt all murlocs, giving a high chance of hitting poison
---
I usually do my research on hsreplay.com
---
Blizzard refuses to patch this evolve combo because they don't have enough manpower to create a new expansion, launch a new gamemode and do balance patches at the same time.
---
Don't blame this on malice by the devs, blame this on the higher ups not supporting these devs.
---
I was thinking the same thing card pool feels a bit small, love the hero variety tho
---
Can someone give me a quick description of the new mode?
---
But you see this is why it’s a bait card. It’s inefficient until upgraded and holding cards in reserve is a 4 coin deficit, plus all the coins rerolling to hunt for the card. With that gold and board space you could be actually improving the board by buffing other minions. It’s also inefficient to buff because the only main buff for it is the clunker that only buffs 2/2. In comparison, zoobot gets you 3/3 and magician gets you 6/6.
---
This is step one of Blizzard's new subliminal programming.
---
PFfff Desert Hare is exactly the same shit as Doppleganster.... Level of denial on these scrubs is very strong.
---
[[mogu]]
---
MaRo said the same thing a bunch of times when they released broken cards
---
Its an objective competitive advantage to choose from 3 heroes versus 2.
---
I mean if I start gaining elo from 8th place i wont reach negative overflow lol
---
Pick it. Opponents can’t take it anymore, and it’s stronger because it would let you discover another card, and make room for another card
---
Murlocs lost the Oracle and Murk Eye
---
F
---
But you wouldn't have found out about his *spicy pretzel mustard*
---
You are ignoring the fact that only small numbers of minions in the mode are stackable like this. This excludes all the rest, and everyone ends up playing the same broken shit becasue they have to. It makes it more boring than it should be, for sake of letting players stack those minions so high. Either get stacking or get losing - it could be much better than this.
---
I like Bob. He needs more voicelines though. And he should talk a tiny bit less. He makes me laugh with his rare lines.
---
"Don't tell the others, but I'm rooting for you!" (says to everyone)
---
There is a LOT of potential.  It is very fun and I can't wait for more units / rotation.  They seem to be committed to quicker updates for it also which is great.
---
Might I suggest for attack sound, the same sound  that King Krush has, but pitched higher?
---
how do you get a divine shield on a murloc thats not an amalgam? Selfless hero is not cutting it I assume.
---
That doesn’t wildly change the meta. That card would just push the meta further in the same direction it is already currently going.
---
No, you're not the only one. Exact same situation with me.
---
It lacks some rewards, sense of progression and general QoL features HS usually lacks (achievements, player profiles, leaderboards).
---
On the plus side, it got me to try out other autobattlers and I got hooked on TFT. I don't know if that was Blizzard's intention tho lol. Watching the minions actually fight is a lot more fun, and there's a lot less RNG, just enough for variance, but not so much you can get tilted.
---
Anka the Buried from the free Uldum pack. Happy newbie.

Nah, it's fine.

3/3/3 | Battlecry: If you control a minion with 5 or more Attack, gain +2/+2.  
---
They could do 7 star minions only obtainable by getting 3 6-star minions. This could be one but yeah it’s probably still be broken
---
*ques into team of 1/2 Murlocs with Poisonous and Divine Shield*
---
Rotation might be necessary if the amount of content eventually become seriously a lot. But currently its just dumb and solves nothing. Figuring out the optimal strategy with the pathetic amount of cards is trivial, like OP says in a day or two. Just because you rotate that you have 4 tribes X instead of tribes Y doesnt change the fact that every game you'll be stacking the same shit as the last 20 games.
---
And the "problem" with too many cards is beyond stupid too. There's a million ways that can be solved, including increasing the amount of minions offered, biasing offering towards your board/heroe, etc. Its not exactly a new "problem" either, hs team have been solving it with arena for years.
---
Just give him "Stealth. Cannot attack."
---
I'm jealous
---
No, he just doesn't care.
---
I would like an ASCII mode
---
The cost of Tavern upgrades becomes (1) cheaper each turn. When you upgrade it becomes more expensive but still drops every turn
---
Dude, you are unique and interesting.
---
Please start a stream/blog/instagram account showing you conceding games!
---
I shared this opinion in firebat’s stream and almost everybody disagreed with me. Dragons just don’t make sense in battlegrounds. They would have to change the design of some dragons to be tribe buffers or add like 8 dragon tribal cards.
---
Imagine this with multiple khartut defenders and baron rivendare though. If you had the board space, one defender would be 18 healing. If you had 3, you could full heal every turn, the game would never end unless someone won with at least 5 tier 6 minions surviving.
---
Okay, maybe you have a point. Truth is, we don't know how the system works for BG. Still don't think an up to ~10 percentage point difference warrants an entry fee system.
---
what is this, concede meta?
---
Or easy way to get another insanely buffed amalgam with poison divine shield. Faceless manipulator for anything less than 6 would be broken as hell
---
Bad placement.
---
The minion gaining echo would mean that you can buy it from the shop multiple times. (buy 2 copies for 6 gold)  
---
IT DOES NOT HAVE ECHO IN YOUR HAND.
---
And a crusader!
---
You only build to specifically counter in the top 2-4, which is the late game, when the rover should already be long gone. Before the top 4 you just build to be as powerful as possible against any board type. Also in my post I actually said he has potential, but because there aren’t enough effective single minion mech buffs a much better alternative is just a buffed up amalgam with a Replicating Menace because it’ll spawn just as many or more token distractions and it’s easier to buff. Also the few single minion mech buffs that are available are much better to go on junkbots or cobalts.
---
Fine by me. Battlegrounds is the superior game (while it's still fresh, at least).
---
Cant tell if youre being serious, but they are probably the most popular band of this past decade lol
---
Oh baby a triple
---
That’s a good point, but drop rates can be severely lowered and offered to players who are behind because of RNG. It’s a small idea.
---
Thanks
---
I've seen all the visual bugs like widened screen and distorted. But how did they manage to do this?
---
Cannot upvote harder.
---
I was just thinking this an hour ago.
---
There’s like no minion variety at all. I’ve played with like half of the possible builds already (i’ll admit I’ve done nothing but play battlegrounds) the other half are generally acceptable to not be viable.
---
they didn't test it thoroughly again!  So many bugs lately
---
That's absolute absurd nonsense. Rotation only works when the amount of content (as well as depth) is reasonable to begin with. Not for a mode that's solved in a weekend. And there's an endless amount of ways to manage how you get the cards you need, with discover effects, weighted offerings etc. 
---
All you people fearmongering about "too much" content will do is kill the mode. Nobody's gonna play it long term with it having a fraction of the content of hs classic set.
---
Nah it's still in standard
---
Yep.
---
I agree with this, his hero power being used every turn late game to remove shields should make him better than B
---
I just won with queen wagtoggle
---
I agree 100% the whole game is pretty much: get almagam, give it poisonous, taunt and divine shield and then get some beasts or mechs and then you're done, that's the end game of all heroes and it is a bit shallow.
---
Mmm...looking at HSReplay, evolve shaman loses hard to control warrior, like 33% winrate against control warrior, n’zoth warrior, and mech’a’thun warrior.
---
Quest Shaman (which also runs desert hare and evolve) beats those decks, but loses to other decks (like quest hunter—39% winrate) and perhaps more important in this meta, loses to evolve shaman.
---
So I mean, if you want to beat every shaman deck running evolve, yeah that’s hard, but if you can settle for one of them it’s doable.
---
And for the record this does fit into the aggro/midrange/control setup.  Evolve shaman is aggro, loses to control decks like control warrior, control shaman, highlander big spell mage.  Quest Shaman is a slower value deck, loses to decks with bursts of face damage like malygos druid, holy wrath paladin, quest hunter....
---
That isnt how math nessisarily works in these things. They normally set it to a fixed percentage at certain levels. It's not based on number remaining.
---
They probably could do that, but then it would become a game of who knows the algorithm the best instead of random cards and decision making scenarios. That is just my personal opinion though, i wouldn't want to see a biased tavern because it would take away from potential new stratergies ariving as a meta shifts. Like i said just a personal opinion
---
Typically, games are better when they do things other games aren't, carving a niche for themselves in the process.
---
Sure, some sort of team composition buffs could be nice, but that would also instantly incentive picking certain heroes over others, the ones with specific tribal buffs, while also making the Curator's 1/1 Amalgam and Nightmare Amalgam generally much, much stronger.
---
Plus, Battlegrounds is still in a Beta state, and more stuff generally is going to be added.
---
One shots anything it does damage to
---
Really hoped they would’ve posted a Hearthside chat for DoD today. They haven’t shown any new cards since blizzcon
---
Funny this list doesn't actually agree with the winrates
---
At 10 gold you get a golden card every turn, a bit too OP
---
Yes, you will need to pay ~1000 gold every 4 months in order to not play at a disadvantage. You can literally make that much in like 3 weeks by playing twice a week to clear your daily quests. Is that really that much of an issue for you?
---
Hadronox is easy 6 star, good stats with *crazy* deathrattle potential, although IIRC it would only rez creatures with native taunts since it looks at base features.
---
This is not something I expected to read today.
---
^ 
---
this guy here spittin' the truth
---
What are you trying to argue, really?  
---
Audience /= "Esports",  and fully staffed dev crew /= "dead game".
---
 What is a fully staff dev crew to you? The game has already been officially released. You don't need a dev team comparable to developing a completely new game for one that only requires enough for balancing, bug testing and character creations.
---
All Blizzard did was kill the esports aspect of the game, as it wasn't profitable for them. Had the game been unsustainable, they would've pulled the plug on continued support. 
---
The game has never missed a beat when it comes to consistent content and balancing support, and the install base has yet to reach the red. This is not Diablo 3. If you consider these things as signs of a "dead game", then you have a really broad definition of the term.
---
[[Cenarius]] at 5/6, maybe a handbuff card like [[don han'cho]] at 4, [[hogger, doom of elwynn]], [[sparring partner]] or [[sunfury protector]] at 2 or 3 as an earlier taunt enabler that doesnt buff stats, maybe even a [[void terror]] for an additional demon in the roster.
---
I agree. If you can't buff your minions then you will lose, basically a singular win condition. How would an economy system work though?
---
I used the Hearthstone to destroy the Hearthstone
---
Well the skill comes from properly drafting and being flexible. Yes it's very rng heavy, but you also have to know when to draft, when to upgrade, and when to reroll/freeze. You have to pay attention to the cards other players have drafted because that means there's that much less chance of you drafting the cards that are already in play. Do you keep an upgraded card? Do you draft something that duplicates so you have extra tokens next turn to do more things? Do you keep gambling on a combo or has someone already scooped up what you need? You have to be willing to drop a plan for something more feasible when others have beat you to it. Lots of decisions go into the game.
---
&gt;Their schedule is focused and fixed on one top priority , years round. Delivery and release of 300+ new cards for pack sales.
---
No shit dude. But you can't forget that part of that is thanks to all the people who condone it. When I gave a friend that graphic with all the discussed features that haven't made it into the game in the past 5 years, his response was "Well yeah, why fix what isn't broke? I don't need other features, as long as they keep pushing out cards". I'm not joking. It might be paraphrased slightly because it's been a couple months but that was pretty much his sentiment.
---
Team 5 is just listening to that part of players. Imo nothing will change as long as they stay the same.
---
Iirc amalgam is a two star minion.   But yea that seems like a nice change.
---
As a murloc shaman player I can say the amount of times I get to rebuild with an angler after getting my board destroyed is farrrrr less than the amount of times my board gets wrecked, I get ground down and concede
---
But we already know that stuff is coming.  We even know the next 4 heroes.  Since they already have minions that say dragon on them, and a dragon set incoming, I bet the first set of new minions will add dragon tribal too.
---
Don't overdo that, Gwent players might still know Unga as a fictional tribe, because all of them played exactly the same at one point.
---
All I’m saying is, I’m looking forward to having the wild cards return to wild.
---
That's first place finishes, jaraxxus is the only one on that list that isn't on the top 4 appearance list. 
---
I can see how, the good jaraxxus decks are really good and his hero power is effectively +7/+7 in stats every turn. But on average demons sorta suck and can only really support one drafter
---
Oh right I see what you're saying now. I can't comment on that as I'm a noob and this is the first expansion I've saved for
---
There is a clip of mike donais saying it at blizzcon to..m kibler? Maybe firebat. It is in the latest omni compilation video.
---
That's how it works
---
Sybil6sigma 6666? Devil?
---
With 6300 just go to HSReplay and filter by winrate
---
Yeah, if You don't rush to upgrade your tavern, there's a chance that someone has already taken multiple copies of the best units, and You're basically screwed. IDK exactly what but there should be something that hurts that playstyle, so people aren't forced to do it.
---
Surprising. I'm only at 4600 myself but never have I seen a top 4 with boards like this.
---
And fyi you never really need to hit tier 6. You rarely hit t6 minions anyway and have a higher chance getting the one you need tripling up.
---
Do people really not like Wagtoggle? I won a game with her recently without losing a single unit of health. With a lot of amalgams and the right set up she’s incredible.
---
On some other games you can just restart with new acc its just HS requires you to invest a fortune on new cards and packs and so on.
---
I like the "the last goodbye" song reference, made me go listen to it and cry.
---
Farewell friend
---
VERY minor one.  It's been proven it makes almost no difference by people like Kripp doing just as well with a 2 hero selection as 3.  
---
I only have 2 and haven't made under top 3 my last 10 games.  I doubt the hero would make that much difference from my observations as it's more skill and luck with the minions.
---
Wanted to say thanks; dusted old gold cards that I didn’t need now and bought the budget n’zoth rogue deck with 1060 dust. Have had success, and fun with this deck! Thank you!
---
I play sniplock, why does it matter?
---
The problem in the long term is that they can't really add cards without making combos and synergy harder to assemble.
---
Eh...I don't know. It's just different skill sets. 
---
In Standard you specifically know what you're doing from the begining of the game. But you still have think on your feet depending on what your opponent does, know when to sink in certain resources, etc. You also know less about what you're opponent is doing before the match, while in Battlegrounds you see what they're doing.
---
how do you get 12345g? you can only earn gold in multiples of 10
---
Theres a 6 star adapt all your murlocs. If shudder gets that watch the fuck out
---
just describing how fast the game ended
---
Beta doesn't really have a meaning anymore, though. Most games just stay there for like half of their lifetime and are just "released" one day, without any change at all.
---
I tried a shudder pogo game. I didn't find a lot of pogos and got like 7th
---
Possibly but they'll find a way to monetize it if they find BG leading to less purchasing of an expansion than usual.  
---
This cycle won't count as I imagine the bonus alone would have been enough for people to pay up to get early access.  
---
Next cycle though if people way up buying cards for a mode they rarely play vs getting some extra early bonus or what not (unless it's an actual p2w advantage) you'd have to think they'd wait rather than wasting money.
---
pestenera#21590 EU, trading 80g quest. I can show it to you but you will be going first
---
200 packs for expansion for 3 expansions makes 600 packs a year, 60.000 gold and 164 gold a day... I don't know how much he plays but it's entirely possible.
---
Say in the early game I picked up two alley cats which are both on my board but now I want to start transitioning to something else. Currently I have to decide whether I want to keep weak minions on my board to try for a triple or sell them so I can transition right away.  Or sometimes you have two doubles on the board and need to pick which one you’re going to go with. If I could pick one of them up and just let it sit in my hand it takes all of that strategy away.
---
You could re-role 3 times
---
I could also ice, then un ice until the timer goes out
---
Happy cake day
---
Hopefully they add more cards into the pool for the full release. It'd be nice to see at the very least elementals as an archetype. Honestly they could even add weapons (maybe as a rare extra buy option) to allow essentially trading health for an extra hit on the board.
---
I've never been able to see *any* pogo the moment I have more than 5 on board. I sell them to put them back in the pool and still nothing. Glad to know I'm just that unlucky.
---
Razor Mae would let you get cleave + divine shield + poisonous. Too busted.

Hey avlijabavlija, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

99% of the time these posts are just people upset that they were rightfully banned. Scratch that, 100%
---
I don't know why game developers insist on using MMR systems like this, people just aren't smart or mentally mature enough to not get jacked off with points for winning a game.
---
I mean... Yeah. The minion pool is tiny as heck and the progression system is so bare-bones it's basically nonexistent (and on top of that it's broken in a dumb way). If you've exhausted the amount of fun you can get out of the mode, wait for new cards.
---
It amazes me that people need rewards for everything. If it's fun, play it, if it isn't, don't. Why does everything need substantial reward?
---
Yeah. For a while we were dishonestly calling it "early access" but they've successfully redefined "beta" as "we're releasing it 80% done, and may or may not finish it if we feel like it." It's just plausible deniability for when it breaks, and the ability to effectively have two release windows to drum up more publicity.

You have UI on your phone?!

Nothing per sea, but if they detect you logging in from all over the globe because of your VPN they will think you're account sharing or using a boosting service.  If you log in from France then an hour later log in from Texas it's looks fishy.
---
True, but as I said, this Battlemaster can be added to any composition and be a valuable asset. It is a lone minion that can be buffed in a few ways, and any that buffs its Attack (including Lightfang Enforcer and Defender of Argus) is especially valuable.
---
It doesn't need a Mal'Ganis and it certainly doesn't need a Soul Juggler to be good. It benefits mostly from Brann.
---
Not too unlike a Maexxna or Ghastcoiler finding its way into some non-Beast compositions because they're so strong.
---
&gt; 3 lanes, towers, inhibs, nexus, jungle, 5v5 topdown with 4 skills,"yeah nono this is not a moba clone, we are blizzard, we are fresh and innovative"... BS.... it's Dota for babies because itemshop and last hitting is just too confusing i guess... It's literally the same fuckin map Icefrog created and that's not a moba or what? Plz...
---
Are you agreeing with me, or...? I'm confused. For the record, yes, I think HotS is a MoBA if you're ever wondering about that.
---
&gt; "Nono, this is not an esports, we just made a whole league like the LCS with many big organisations like Dignitas because we are bored. Nono, we don't give first place a freaking prize money of 1,2 million dollar ,1200000dollar!!, because we hate money and we want to get rid of it"
---
They really must've hated money because they made nothing promoting the e-sports scene, hence the cut.
---
&gt; Activision cutted corners when it came to the funding of OWL teams, they fired 800 people. No offense, i think you just have zero clue what Activision is actually doing right now. Give them 1,2 million dollars for winning, that will show them how unserious we are about it, iirc that was before Actilizard took over and started to re-evaluate aka "profit&gt;all" everything.
---
So, you agree with me or not? Because this section sounds like whiplash while reading. Activision was not happy at all with the situation surrounding HoTS' esport scene. There was a certain group of people (mostly one person in particular. Can't recall his name) within Blizzard who wanted so badly to cultivate a scene, but it simply didn't pan out. The scene would've continued if Activision didn't step in and stop Blizzard from bleeding themselves dry.
---
I don't like Activision as much as the other guy, but closing off the esports scene was probably a good call. If they downscaled a bit it would've been a better call for both parties, but what's happened, happened.
---
So did their side. Even less I'd say
---
Delete this post and act like nothing ever happened

It's whichever happens first
---
I got madame lazul and priest's quest.

"sort of going to ride" lol OK. Whatever you say chief

Honestly wait until new expansion. Current meta in both wild and standard are not fun. Shaman usually winning by turn 5. Not fun
---
No sadly only 3 but that would've been the dream to get a golden brann
---
Yea
---
A shit PC is good enough. For phones, they are optimicing it, its still in open beta.
---
I haven't played much BG yet -- is Rag bad because of the high cost of the hero power?
---
You can just say for example banned for aim assistance. That's not giving much info when you were using aimbot and or whole "100-in-1" cheat package.

Bruh there was a confirmed bug with the turn timer. People were banned even though they were not cheating

I play 3 hours after work and just was able to grind out to 6k, but that's just on one account.  Tides has what? Three accounts and all of them are 6k+?  That's a true grind there.
---
That’s because only like, 5 of the cards ended up really mattering. The only new deck I can really think of that was created is the control rogue that plays a billion N’zoth’s.
---
Even the new shaman deck is basically just a variant of aggro shaman with evolve in it, and then the Battlecry shaman is just the same deck as before but with evolve + a couple extra cards in it.
---
I can't have a shittier pc and bob's tavern turns are near impossible to go as you planned. Ranked, arena and solos work fine but battlegrounds is so slow
---
Even shaman still is way more consistent
---
99% is not good enough because with 1k banned players you have 10 innocent people. And if you ban so many like for example CS GO have to ban you easily can get thousands of wrongful bans in a year.
---
There is a cool GDC talk about their machine learning cheat detection system called VACnet. AFAIK they didn't release it until they got 99.95% correct flags and even then all it is doing is putting a "cheater" in a queue of cases that is later checked by humans anyway.
---
It's pretty close, I'd go the 2/3 over the Cats, but maybe not over Tidehunter.
---
You're most likely still going to sell on R3, you end up with more stats on the board with a Tidehunter, the tradeoff that you won't be keeping them.
---
It depends, but they would need fairly strong, thematic build-arounds along the lines of Brann to open up other paths.  But I don't know if there are a ton of cards in HearthStone's pool that are as compelling in this mode.
---
And, of course, Brann himself is basically just another form of tribals without the explicit tribal tag.
---
I was stuck at 5.5k in NA since I played their in closed beta.  When I started playing on EU for the quest when open beta started I got to 5.5k in about 30 games, so now my EU and NA account are close to the same rating, yet I've played (and won) about 4x as many games in NA as I have in EU.  Pretty sad honestly.  I still haven't done my battlegrounds quest on Asia yet, but I'm thinking of just tanking asia.  I'd hate to be higher MMR on a server I'm not even playing on than the main server I'm grinding out.
---
So anything your shitty computer can’t handle is pay to win? That is honestly the funniest thing I’ve read all day
---
It's factually correct that people were wrongly banned. Not sure what you're on.
---
How about Battlecry: "Give friendly ancient ability "This minion always attacks the enemy minion with the lowest Attack"? This will make Boogeymonster and other ancients very strong. I think its worthy own keyword.
---
Shaman only costs ca 2500 now if you like
