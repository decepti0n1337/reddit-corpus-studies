Zoo is aggro-control and more of a board control deck than a face deck. Zoo was tier 3 and got shit on by control warriors. Zoo is one of the more fair decks in the game as well, it's super interactive and trades with you constantly. I've gotten legend with Handlock and Freeze Mage before in the past, are those skill intensive enough for you?  
---

---
Also, I agree you don't necessarily need to be good to get to legend, I'm just countering this guy's claim that I've only gotten to maybe rank 7.
---
---
---
Hitting legend 6k isnt good, im legend 200 and don't consider myself good comapared to zalae or someone like that
---
Wise words
---
little bit of backstory, I was playing bomb warrior because I had warrior quest, and he was playing conjurer mage. I greeted him at the beginning, then did nothing for my first turn. next turn I coined augmented elekk, and played clockwork goblin on turn 3. he played the 2/7 taunt that costs 1 less per each enemy minion, and I killed it next turn with militia commander and clockwork goblin. He proceeded to play mountain giant next turn, which I left alive because I was 4 off lethal, and wanted to go face. next turn he plays khadgar+conjurer's calling on the giant, summoned 4 mountain giants and conceded.
---
I like to think he says "What fu**ing is this" lol

---

---
Yeah elixir sucks, you literally burn half your deck
---
I'm not saying that the current way is the intuitive way for the players, but the cost resetting upon draw isnt a bug. 
---
If Blizzard thinks this shouldnt work the way it currently does, they will have to hard code this interaction to work in a different way.
---
This has happened before aswell, and the interaction wasnt changed:
---
During the Taverns of Time arena, if you discovered an unidentified card from Timeway Wanderer (Battlecry: Discover a spell. Reduce it's cost by 5...) it would be reset to the original cost when drawn.
---
It remind me of the dome (forgot its name) in Slay the Spire,still good but you need to optimize your deck because in normal circumstances  it clog your hand easily (and mill yourself )

---
Actually guys it's not that simple (but at the same time it's not that hard). Don't forget they have to translate it to all languages they support as well. And the most important thing to keep in mind is whether it take 1 minute, 5 days or  a month to fix this they can't simply push the update directly to the game as a stand alone for this minor fix, they will probably push this in an aggregated patch alongside other additions/deletions (like card backs for the next season, fix to other known issues etc.). In gaming companies patches help to keep your game organized, ignoring that and push updates for random things will eventually snowball...
---
Yeah, you're right. While both are technically valid grammar-wise, most folks who say "could care less" mean "couldn't care less."
---
Bugged me when I saw the line myself ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It's funny you don't understand why Blizzard would do this. Or is it sad? Not sure.
---
metapod, use harden
---
Alanna, 9 mana, needs good set up, mage specific.
---
Nomi, 7 mana, neutral, rogue can pull this bs with myra's unstable in turn 6. Also replay the card a few times, being resistant to board clears. Mage never had that.
---
Other point, is the meta itself that allows nomi to be played, while before the average game would be finished way before mage had cast enough spells to make Alanna big.  
---
Other point, less relevant, Alanna could be cleared with warpath. Nomi can't (unless you tech some spell damage minion to help).
---
I've been wanting it for years lmao
---
Oof, that first one. The first time I heard that I line I actually _got_ Baku in the fight and played her. Result?

No voiceline whatsoever. Maximum disappointment.

Did you enjoy your 40 minutes match for a card game? LOL

Far as I can tell: "ME! I'm nexties! Gimmes of the guns!"
---
I used Vim in an Aggro Kingsbane rogue with the standard hero power and deck literally like 3 hours ago. Beat heroic Gallywix on my first try on rogue. 
---
Giving him Cursed Blade off Stolen Steel then Banana Splitting my 7 mana 10/6 Leeroy was so god-damn epic. I'm still hyped.
---
I'd say it's really good, it has a really good synergy with a lot of other treasures too. I had it with the one where you shuffle two 1 cost copies of any minion you play and it was absolutely broken.
---
That said it's a good pick even without a combo. Sure, it can lose you runs, but I'd say it makes you win way more than lose.

Question about Even Warlock. How come \[\[Wilfred Fizzlebang\]\] isn't used in the deck? In theory, being able to draw 0-cost cards that are normally expensive seems very powerful, if Avianna had taught us. Take this scenario for example: turn 7, play Wilferd, HP and draw Bloodreaver.

Great, now I can't look at it thinking it's gonna drop some sick beat.
---
It's fine in rogue if you get any of t he buckets that add cards back to your deck. I took Vim and had academic espionage, kingsbane and the 3/2 that adds 3 copies of a card to your deck. I'd just mulligan for kingsbane every game, beat the normal run on my first try with it. 
---
I think this would also work with big priest/big mage if you get the other passive that halves the cost of your cards. The huge early advantage makes up for burning most of your cards
---
How's there no mirror?

So are you going to ban the sale of yugioh cards, Pokémon cards, baseball cards, etc? Same thing but in physical form

Depends on your class and deck.  Sometimes just having a hand full of stuff to do is enough.  Theres a reason Myras is a card.
---
It’s like you didn’t even read the comment you replied to
---
Unless the inconsistency is only in English...
---
&gt;Also, they nerf'd fwa at the height of pirate warrior, which remained playable after the nerf (if pretty significantly reduced in power). It wasn't until the mammoth that the "icebreaker and firey war axe" meme started. 
---
Just a small nitpick: the height of PW was in MSoG, remember that in Un' Goro Quest Rogue was dominating left and right. FWA was nerfed in KFT and PW saw minimal to no play as Druids and Priests (and Tempo Rogue started to rise) were the meta.
---
Everything else you're right though: Year of the Mammoth was shit to Warrior. And in the Year of the Raven Warrior became a thing again in Boomsday (although Quest Warrior, Odd Warrior and Odd Quest Warrior were experimented in WW).
---
So, like lottery tickets too?

I managed a quest/mechathun hunter pretty well with it. Draw through the entire deck of 1 drops. Play them all as fast as you can and milling doesnt matter cause they are only 1 drops. Complete quest for total instant board refill twice and then if you still havent won drop mechathun and run it into AI's minions with an empty deck/hand.
---
Personally I like the warrior, rogue and shaman decks. Warlock is impossible to win with, you basically take free damage until turn 4-5 where you might get a taunt down.
---
What's the issue with rogue? Other than missing Leeroy it's pretty good and I've had a decent WR with it and warrior at rank 5
---
Works with galvanizer too for 1 mana.

No it doesn’t lol

The question is: can you consider "fair" something that gives you an insta win, even though it happens only in 1% of the games?
---
If you added one turn and lower 8 by one it would be better. Note how turns is synonymous with mana. This could be a four mana 7/7. I suggest you edit this post and repost it to r/hearthstonecirclejerk for free karma.
---
Digital card games have a way to get a card without needing to open packs until you find it. In hearthstone you get dust, in MTG arena there are wild cards you can redeem for a card.
---
This removes the gambling portion because eventually anyone can get any card without spending money. No luck required.
---
This is different an important difference to loot boxes. Also I believe some games with loot boxes let you trade with other players. This will mean some players are swindled and taken advantage of by making unfavorable trades.

Elixir works really well with quest hunter.

Vim is tremendously powerful. With how many card cost reductions methods there are, its powerful to be able to access options from your deck so consistently. you wont need every card you burn. Vim isnt ALWAYS helpful, it can burden, but its absurdly consistent in leveraging vs. broken enemy turns. 
---
it truly shines with the text "immune to fatgiue". such a delicious bonus.
---
Magnetic allows it to work as a buff spell, and is neutral (so mage and priest can use it)'
---
The point is, free echo minions will only fill your board, and a board full of snip snaps isnt strong. A buff/manetic can be staked to infinity, and now a board of 300/200 in stats or more is perfectly possible. It was possible with glinda and mechwarper, but required minimum 9 mana and 2 different cards (appart from the magnetic minion). Snip snap could combo with reckless on turn 5 with only 1 other card (and was possible in standard), and this hubter one also requires 2 cards but its on turn 7. Now suddenly snip snap is a card that will restrict any cost reduction effect in the future due to its keyword combination.
---
If I'm turning on my console to play a game I'm sure as hell not playing Hearthstone.  
---
I'm surprised people play it on their PC but I guess it runs on shit PCs.
---
Yeah boss variety is there but the RNG numbers are off. They need to buff the "rare" spawn rates and nerf the "common" spawn rates of the bosses.
---
The elixir only works with a hyper aggro low cost deck, or you burn half your deck.
---
At the same time, Princess Huhuran was printed a full year before Terrorscale Stalker, and the usefulness of a card that activates Deathrattles on summon wasn't known when Whispers of the Old Gods was released. 
---
Part of power creep in a card game is the design team learning what can and cannot work within their game. At first, instant deathrattle activation seemed very dangerous to have, but over the next year Team 5 R&amp;D learned that the effect has roughly the same value of a one mana spell.
---
Thanks for the incest
---
&gt; you should never have echo on a low cost spell in mage or priest. 
---
Why it's ok to have broken stuff in Rogue and Hunter but for some reason when is done in Priest everybody call the cops?.
---
That is because its only 0-cost in your hand. After you played it, it became 3-mana.
---
Magic Arena does a pretty good job combining Hearthstone and paper Magic, they just translated HS to Magic from looks of it (played a fair amount of MtG:A).
---
Magic Arena, as weird as it sounds for other HS players maybe, is more expensive than HS. The breaking point being that you currently have no way to disenchant/sell old cards that rotated out...
---
What do you mean with oppressive? There is no deck like Mono Red where the opponent can be dead in 3 turns. I remember in last MtG:A tournament I saw it was mostly Esper Control vs Esper Control and in HS, the last tournament was mostly Control Warrior vs Control Warrior. **But** it was like that before the nerfs that happened last week and it never was like that on ladder. Before the nerfs Tempo Rogue had a bad matchup, Control Warrior had bad matchups, other decks had bad matchups (very often it was Tempo Rogue). Now it is more even and other decks (Hunter, Mage) are more present.
---
If one deck is oppressive and the meta can't adjust to it, nerfs come fairly quick, but some nerfs come either way roughly 1 month into a new expansion. Buffs for older cards are coming next week (for the first time). The devs are doing a good job to even out the meta so no decks are oppressive or frustrating/irritating to play against.

I had vim and the thing that let's you use your hero power twice in combination with the mage hero power that reduced cards in your hand. I drew through a deck of mostly small spells, then the archmage and several cards that gave me several more cards. I pretty. Much just always had 10 cards even after my deck ran out. I don't remeber what the other one or two win condition cards I had in my deck other Than archmage though

Careful with the „s“ there. So far, only one has been confirmed, however numerous times.
---
Yeah I agree, it's just limiting and doesn't feel like it adds any dynamic to the game. 
---
The extra coins and having a minion dormant on the board that appears after X turns adds some additional strategy to the game.
---
There's really no excuse for Knight's text to not read "Costs (1) less whenever you summon a Beast while this is in your hand."
---
Cheap-shot for rogue is a perfect example why you’re correct. If Rogue manages to reduce the cost of it to 0 (and all of the echoes), it clears the board.

Because lottery tickets are targeted at children.

I used to play a few seasons ago and I'm coming back. I played mage then, but looking at the mage decks now I don't have near the dust to make one. I have about 4800 dust and a limited collection. Deck tracker shows I can probably make either Midrange or mech Hunter or like a Token Druid Deck. Should I invest in any of these? I don't think I'm going to get lucky enough to get enough dust to make any kind of mage deck.
---
I'm in the opposite boat.  I've now beaten more bosses on heroic with rogue than the other 4 heros, and still haven't cleared a single one.  
---
Conversely I have exactly 24 heroic bosses killed as mage, having cleared all 3 chapters with that class first go. Also beat with priest first try as well.  
---
Half of my rogue runs I'm dead by the third boss.  Tried many different combos of hero power/starter deck.  Anomalies on and off.  Different treasures.  I just cant seem to get into work.  I made it galywix twice now, and was dead turn 5 both times.

dust it
---
That being said, this is a 7-mana combo. You gotta make it to 7 mana against the aggro decks, and the control decks will make sure you never have a mech remaining on board.
---
I also don't see how this beats Big Priest.

You are paying 6 mana for a 4/4

as other players already answered only stats above the base stats will be removed and lower stats will remain (e.g. a 9/1 giant buffed with 1 banana will not die, it will just lose one attack)
---
Thanks and yeah, my bad
---
If you are going for just Warrior counter, Bomb Hunter and Mechrattle Hunter are both much more reliable than Beasts.
---
Thanks!
---
Pogo Hop is not going to work. The current meta is perfect for countering the deck. Conjurer's answers big hoppers well, deadly shot is being played, bomb + fireworks, venomizer + missiles, Rogue and Shaman melt your face before pogos come online, even Bomb Warrior probably blows your face up since Rogue doesn't have healing in Standard. It's just not unfair enough and it doesn't come online fast enough. The only truly filthy combos I can imagine with pogos is doing some sort of myra's + hop + big tog shuffle shenanigans, but is that even better than putting Nomi into a Tempo Rogue? 
---
It doesn't get there yet. Zola would be pretty good for the deck but Zola isn't in Standard. Cheat Death would be good but it isn't in Standard. DK Valeera would be good but it isn't in Standard. Most of the good cards that GENERATE more Pogos without shuffling them back into your deck aren't in Standard.

work towards this. I recommend crafting highmanes asap. I also feel like you can dust vereesa. (Generally dont dust legendaries but she isnt great or budget friendly so it may be worth the dust to get you off the ground. For anything youre missing just replace it with something similar (ideally of the same cost)
---
Are you talking overall win rate or from rank 5 to legend? Because I remember a certain deck in patron warrior where it's win rate was lower overall but between 5 to legend it was stupidly high.
---
Cool idea but a bit too strong the one you propose
---
The only time I won with the priest deck, it's because I got a single Pyromancer to stick and buffed it until I could Topsy Turvy for 20+, clearing boards along the way. Awful deck.
---
I just like that zillax can be much stronger for 1 mana extra
---
Damn this is a good idea I am gonna try that,probably not in the extend that your friend does it but like 2-3 accounts so I experiment and have fun with new decks thanks for the effort for typing all of that!
---
Seems that the doom bots missed lethal tho

Maybe set up some counter spells when you know they’ll use brawl

`ZZ` works.

Some say, this game is going to this day.

Although Pogo doesnt use it's heroic power if it has no cards in deck.
---
I need to know why you have this
---
Hearthstone hero? Warcraft villain... same thing
---
I also have questions as to why we get another "cancer" mech instead if a card adressing the current metagame. Back in the days they at least tried with loatheb.
---
Thank you lol I didn’t even notice
---
I managed to play twenty to make the twenty-first have 9 million attack. Only for the attack to be blocked by ice block and then a second ice block the next turn so the enemy died to fatigue.
---
Go cry me a river. The fact remains that "you and people like you" don't get to define how a room is "supposed" to be used. The room has *never* been set aside as a homebrew room.
---
More to the point, there is nothing unreasonable about using it to learn a deck in order to avoid risking stars on ladder, nor is there anything unreasonable about using it to do quests without risking stars. 
---
*You* do not get to dictate how the rest of us play the game and *we* are not obligated to respect or abide by your arbitrary conditions, so don't expect me to be moved by your whining. 
---
As for what Blizzard could do, they could do a number of things. They could set up a pauper room. They could allow players to create custom rooms with card restrictions. They could allow players to form clans so that people like you who are hell bent on playing homebrews could play each other. 
---
The list goes on. So, once again, instead of whining that people are being so gosh-darned mean by using a room exactly as it was designed I would, once last time, highly recommend that you petition Blizzard for an actual solution to your problem.

Then add cards that interract with Draws - then make it a very not-confusing keyword
---
As I said, for the basic guides you can just play the game, so much comes from experience and knowing different matchups. I feel you can slowly start with more advanced guides.
---
[vS reports](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-130/) for the meta and matchups, [heartstonetopdecks](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/) for the best and cheap decks, [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/decks/) for both in real time.
---
The problem at rank 25-20, many didn't play in months or bought hundreds of packs or are really bad with a good deck and they play against players who have no cards yet. There is no way around it other than learning how to play and upgrading your deck.
---
* Learning how to play: watch some streams or videos, I don't think basic guides help anymore, think about every play you do, play slower and think more, try to find the best outcome possible for you in this moment. Just with this experience you can take a cheap deck from hearthstonetopdecks or Old\_Guardian and make it to rank 5.
---
Example against Nomi Priest: you want to remove all the draw engines he has on board + pyromancer, that way he draws much slower and you have more time to win, because yes, if he has no cards in the deck you often just lose. Priority number 2 is hitting face, Nomi Priest can't do much before Nomi and giant taunts so you just pressure them as much as you can. If you can't then you often just lose.
---
If you know that you play against Mech Hunter and you know you need Hex or Poly, then mulligan for it, don't waste it and hold it until he wasted many cards and ressources on one minion that you remove with one card after that.
---
* Upgrading your deck: choose one cheap deck and look at the best equivalent decks on the 3 sources above, you can even look what cards have the best winrate in a deck on HSReplay. Start to buy packs where you can get the cards you need or craft them. Classic cards &gt; everything else, because they stay forever in your collection, neutral cards &gt; class cards, because some cards you can use with several classes.
---
As a starting point you can also try the autocomplete feature ingame, the deckbuilder always makes the best possible deck with the currently available cards.
---
You do not keep any of your Arena cards, so no, the only goal in Arena is to win as much as possible for a bigger reward.
---
I don not understand why crafting would be bad though. Crafting is how you build decks. It is very unlikely that you can open everything you need from packs.
---
Yeah I beat the first 2 Heroic wings easily but 3rd one is giving me a headache. Either I get dogshit rewards or get steamrolled by some "interactive" mechanic (Hannigan with like a 14/14 on his turn 3 is harsh when you never got offered any removal)
---
On the other hand if you get the golden Candle at the right time you steamroll the bosses on the other side. It's weird how there seems no middleground of close matches. Either steamroll or get steamrolled
---
why so
---
Wow, I thought this was only an issue in single player mode. Hope they get it fixed.
---
I feel like people on this sub have no sense of the actual power level in Wild if they think that this combo has a chance of being oppressive at all.
---
Any game that you're able to pull this off and win is a game that would have already been won if you were playing Odd Paladin, Kingsbane Rogue, Mech Hunter, or any of the other insane aggro decks in Wild.
---
On legend you can lose points if you get a tie depending on the difference between your and your opponents rank
---
Be careful, you will not see the screen "pack reward" just after she left the inn (with the "Done" button)... Normally you see the pack reward screen right after you quit the "watch" (in the left menu) during the next game (no need to wait more)... But 100% it was working like this.
---
Reminds me of fel reaver. Who cares if you burn some cards; you get such insane value out of it.
---
The only time it is actually bad is if you plan to basically skip the first few turns (which is usually a losing strategy anyways).
---
M8 I’m rank 5 in wild I know how oppressive decks are I’m just pointing out the combo. :/

Well good luck playing 2 games per hour. Roping every warrior. Seems like a fun time.

Second Priest Nerf of 2019.

tnx, the best hs site!
---
I've been playing Heroic mode religiously since it came out, and..
---
The AI is flat out terrible, often.  Missed lethal, attacking minions when they could go face and kill me in two rounds, etc.. Have seen them Fireball my 2/2 Questing Adventurer when I had a 9 attack minion on the board and they had less than 9 health.
---
I was being conservative I guess. I was trying to finish it another turn with knife jugglers but he split it early. My fault entirely.
---
He's also not at all happy with his performance so far in general.

---
What counters this besides a 'destroy this minion'? Seems like a very fast combo.
---
Also the best searcher in the game, tracking
---
2/5. The statline is fine, but having solely taunt as a keyword seems underwhelming. I would say it fills the need for early game protection decently enough, but I have to assume there are better options to play.

For standard meta decks there were better alternatives but Hearthpwn was great to find off-meta decks you wanted to experiment with. It was also a great resource for adventure bosses or for wild decks.
---
It’s Big Priest, but his Hero Power is ‘Passive: Your opponent’s minions have -2 Attack.’  
---
No rushing him down because he’s at a late stage with tons of Health.   
---
Outvalueing him is hard because he gets favourable trades every time.
---
C’Thoverload
---
I was simply keeping an open mind.
---
Are we sure it's a bug, considering its an RNG thing?
---
This is a charge/rush situation. Rush should have been the default classic mechanic included on many cards. Charge should be a limited mechanic only printed on special cards or with conditions. 
---
Likewise cost reduction cards should be default have a floor of 1 Mana, with rare exceptions printed that can go further.
---
Was only hearthstone affected or are their other sites like mmochampion also affected
---
I asked myself the very same question a few times, the answer for me remains invariably the same.
---
Console implementation is probably not worth it, especially for hearthstone. 
---
Consoles usually don't have touch screen and if you have to implement a game where interaction with touch screen is basically mandatory it defeats the purpose of implementing the game on the console itself.
---
Imo touch screen is a complementary control and the levers and buttons are the principal means of interacting with the games and the console itself.
---
A solution for the console implementation is to bind mostly unintuitive controls for various action, but this becomes extremely burdensome and an simple action as playing a card can become frustrating quickly.
---
Imagine pressing a combination of two to three buttons to just play a spell or having to press the card and quickly shuffle with the analog the intended target and to have to do so multiple times in a limited timeframe. A nightmare for players who wants to play combo decks or perform complex interactions with the board/cards.
---
I am not able to think an elegant solution without the sole use of touch,but I doubt there are any. Please let me know if you have one.
---
This is a relief to hear.  Hearthpwn is (was) one of the best HS websites out there, I'm glad it will continue on in another form.
---
That was surprisingly considerate. Good use of "thank you" to acknowledge it.

4/3/2 | After your hero attacks, shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck.  
---
4 mana 7/7 overload (2) nex turn you can spent 2 mana less
---
1/5. This seems really, really bad. It effectively ramps your opponent in exchange for the upside of being slightly over-statted? I don't see why you would ever run it.
---
I think it's fine to massacre Mana cheating considering how often and how consistently it fucks up the game and has to be changed. Plus more design space without the looking Spectre of those OP cards
---
Nomi is a kinda self fulfilling proficy the condition is draw all your cards so guarantees you have nomi. You build a deck to both get you the Nomi and meet the condition whereas Alanna you have to both play big spells and draw Alanna and as you only have one copy that can take a while so you've kinda got 2 conditions to meet where Nomi has one.
---
No reason to keep something up and running if it isn't profitable, especially if you don't care about it.

---
What, Arcane Golem was played in Hunter and Zoo all the time
---
Honestly the few times I’ve picked it, it has been garbage. This one just happened to align perfectly on the last boss.
---
I asked him a few questions about why he BMs and that it is considered rude, to which he said he wasn't rude to me personally during the chat so it was okay. I asked if he said something racist whether that would be okay because it wasn't aimed at me, which he responded with what "acceptable racism" is.
---
Yeah especially Hannigan and Jepetto, I think I will pass on attempting a full clear on chapter 3 until they do something about them. 
---
I just lost to Jepetto with hunter and robes of gaudiness. I bombed a 7/7tuant on turn 2 and "the... candles?" in hand. Every turn I'm following up with multiple highmanes, katherinas, all big premium hunter cards... I did 5 damage to him before I died, I didn't get a chance to go face until about turn 8 because even with a nut start his deck can be complete bs. 
---
Apart from stealth or the candle I dunno how you're supposed to beat him except with extreme luck
---
This is a tough card to rate. I like the statline, seems quite good for making trades. However, I don't think the effect is as good as it seems. If you need to fully heal, you are already losing. This doesn't help you stabilize from whatever dropped you so low in the first place. Just prolongs the inevitable. For having to run no duplicates, I think you'd rather have an effect that impacts the board. If there are enough independent win-cons, I think the deck would do decently. Burn decks auto-concede against this card. 2.8/5, depends on how good his deck is.
---
Meta decks might change.  We just had a balance patch and in another week a series of cards from Boomsday will get buffed and get 1 new card. 
---
I'd start with the basics like neutral Legendary cards like Zilliax and Leeroy.  I'd still recommend Vicious Syndicate or HSReplay for meta decks.   [Neon313 also does weekly posts of top decks](https://www.reddit.com/user/neon313/submitted/).

Midrange hunter has a really good matchup against them.. the dire frenzy secret variant not the mech version. Although I think the mech version is also slightly favored.

What comes to my mind is that it's not immediately recognisable as a url. "You can read all about it at [outof.cards](https://outof.cards)!" "Uh yeah sure... What's the url tho?"

"Wait, there's C'Thun stuff in priest's pool? LOL I'm just gonna pick all the C'Thun pools and see what happens."

Weirdly, every C'Thun pool comes with a C'Thun. And you get a fuckton of healing in priest. And in Chapter 3, he can't flood the board at all.

Needless to say, I beat him with like 4 C'Thuns.
---
Vim + golden candle is a surprisingly nutty combo. Vim with an aggro deck guarantees that you establish board control, and if you drop the candle when you have board control, you can't lose the game because you'll delete all the opponent's comeback mechanisms (unless they roll deathwing I suppose)

from rank 50 to 20 THERE ARE some meta decks but in most of the cases new players who do not know how to pilot them... But there is only climb so even some losses don't hurt so much.

pretty much nobody uses direct URLs though, everyone uses search. Lots of modern brands don't even put URLs any more, they just say "search for \[keywords here\]".

I always think people put too much weight behind URLs in 2019. Even with super simple URLs like YouTube and Reddit, how many people are typing out the full URL as opposed to typing Reddit, YouTube into their browser and letting autofill, search and other shorthand methods do the work for them? I'd guess 95%+ of people are not typing full URLs.

I would love it if the Hero Powers determine what kind of Treasures you can get/the chances of certain treasures, and the starter decks determines the appearance of the buckets. For example picking Beast Within as Hunter could increase the rate of Beast related cards by 33% while decreasing other tribes by 25%, and picking Pet Training Hero Power could have a treasure that directly affects it (I.E. gives 2 Chameleons, or gives a 2 mana 2/2 Chameleon that transforms into random 2 drops).

Hey RuneRobin, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
I think so!  I have been playing with menancing nimbus, bogslosher, and double mountain giant to help go tall against warriors.  I play ancestral spirit and zentimo as well.  My deck used to struggle against rogue but now is more favored.  It's a little less consistent against aggro but more versatile in dealing with other control strategies. 
---
What I am playing is a control / hand shaman and not big shaman though, no muckmorphers here.
---
I use shudderwock if I ever run out of gas for bouncing minions back and generating extra elementals and lackeys.  The only time this happens is if I get Hagatha late and am not generating a lot of extra value or able to bounce many minions back.  The bad thing about recasting elysiana though shudder is you are stuck with whatever cards they give you.  Consistently refilling your hands with synergistic minions is a better strategy IMO.

[[Galvanizer]]
---
He is head is no brain :).
---
Poker, depending on the format, has extreme amounts of variance. The amount of variance in a 1-on-1 match in any game is completely correlated to the achievable winrate for a skilled player. 
---
In the format of poker that is most analogous to Hearthstone (heads up SNG) you can achieve a pretty similar match winrate (a bit lower in poker, depending on the blind structure).
---
In the format of poker that is most popular (multi table tournaments) the amount of variance is so extreme that it is common for great players to go on breakeven stretches lasting thousands of tournaments. This is despite the fact that the players playing are mostly not qualifying based on merit and the skill gap thus way larger than in most Hearthstone tournaments.

I hope nothing bad happens

Interesting.  Perma stealth has only cost me a win once, and let to a LOT of wins on my end due to being able to control stuff.
---
Rafaam is much more suitable for a Zoolock deck than Zilliax. You’re correct that Zilliax is more “versatile”, and can fit into practically anything. But Rafaam is simply an indispensable late game tool for Zoolock. If your primary goal is to make your Zoolock deck better, craft Rafaam. If your primary goal is to craft a legendary which you can continue to use in multiple decks later on down the line, then craft Zilliax.
---
Big PATREON link on their homepage. Not much on there yet, but could grow.
---
Props to u for getting so butt hurt that u had to create a reddit thread.
---
If your goal is just to “have fun”, then honestly just craft whatever the hell you want. I should mention after five years of experience in this game though, that there is not a single legendary card that doesn’t lose its novelty after about the first fifteen times you use it. Eventually you just want them to be *useful* for the decks you’re trying to use.

Thank you! I'm not yet sure which boss has what hero power, but I'm sure I'll remember this one now.

I am one of the players that mostly returns when a new expansion gets released it love the dungeon runs (loved the old adventures too), that said I would prefer it if I could buy the wings at a discounted price without the packs. I neither need them for the decks I play nor do I want them.

While I am having fun with the game mode and do the quests to unlock it I feel like compared to games I can get for 20€ it's not worth it for me and I would be umhappy if I bought it.

I don't think it was that so much as the fact that they were neutral and so widely used. Kind of like ziliax is now, but ziliax will rotate.

I don't see how this had anything to do with Hearthstone.
---
Yep. Run wide with small minions? The hero power destroys you. Run tall with big minions? Mass [[Obsidian Statue]] destroys you.
---
Only boss I’ve never beaten. I assume I need disruption for resurrection to beat him, but I’ve never had Shaman with Hex or Mage with Polymorph when I run into him.
---
So RNG games that give the illusion of skill?
---
There are enough Hearthstone resources around .. Never did like sites like Hearthpwn, Icy-Veins, etc .. Just promote net decking (which now Blizzard has incorporated) .. 
---
They will probably be just remaking/ re branding the site (like everyone is nowadays movies, HS and even our "AAA" titles) ..
---
Blizz has confirmed that such special rules do exist and that the buckets are not pure RNG.  Please do share a screenshot of a C'Thun bucket without C'Thun (and no C'Thun in your deck yet).

9/4/8 | Taunt, Lifesteal Deathrattle: Destroy a random enemy minion.

Being general, but I’m sure we have all been in a game with someone who ropes every turn lol.
---
Even though this same thing has been posted a bunch, and seems pretty common (pulled it off last week) I appreciate the smooth high quality/fps gif :)

jw did you run other 2 drops? I don't see why you wouldn't if you didnt have keleseth.

Where will I go to trade the 80g quest now?
