Oh no... I got rid of my jade decks like a month after means streets went in to wild and only have medivh left on heroic. I have been trying for nearly 3 years to beat the thing and never even thought of jade decks...........
---
---
---
Yup, can't go wrong with Zilliax.
---
Doubtful. Reno was the only one for a while. Then we got 3 right before Reno rotated. We just got 5 in one set. I think they‚Äôll either do it right before these rotate or not until after they do. 
---

---
Also, just printing more cards helps Singleton indirectly since they need to use more cards by default.
---
Battlecry quest shaman for sure, I got to legend last season with it. First time since ungoro.
---
I doubt it's a wild thing but rather that it doesn't recognize any player buffs/debuffs currently active.  I assume in standard specifically it wouldn't notice if you have Kalecgos' effect active either.

Just do it yourself. It always disappoints me when players think they don‚Äôt have the means to create decks. I sincerely think all it takes is 6+ months of experience with the game in order to have the acuity required to create competitive decks (note that top tier ‚â† competitive). It just might take a week of tinkering with whatever concept you‚Äôre working with. 
---
Note all of the Priest decks listed above. They are **all** Combo, with one exception. Does this mean you *have* to use Combo? Of damn course not. You can make a Legend viable deck with *practically* (maybe not literally) any initial idea you want to build a deck around. During Rise of Shadows I mostly used a Shadowform oriented deck to reach Legend. This month I used a Highlander Priest list to reach Legend. The month before that I used a Deathrattle Zoo style Priest deck with cards like Zerek included to reach Legend
---
_____________________
---
Also note that I‚Äôm using ‚Äúable to reach Legend‚Äù as the general metric for what I consider makes a hypothetical deck able to be considered ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù. This is opposed to actual top tier decks, which are the ones that (generally speaking) you‚Äôll have/want to use if you want to climb further *up in Legend* once you‚Äôre already there. But for 99% of players, I think they‚Äôre just sorely misguided when it comes to this vague notion I always see that all you can use in this game is exclusively five or six top tier tournament decks, or whatever. Of course you don‚Äôt have to use those. Not if the extent of your competitive goal is simply to reach Legend. It‚Äôs **definitely** not the case if all you want to do is reach rank 5. Any competent player can likely reach rank 5 using nothing but random ass decks they‚Äôve had the deck-builder tool build for them.
---
Are you going for a midrange/aggro priest deck? That's what this looks like to me. I don't know how this does at rank 15 but I'm pretty sure it won't be so fun higher up, quest res priest is normally played in a very controlling way, a bit like control warrior except you do actually play some minions to pressure the opponent! This is almost like an aggro built because you have so many weak resurrections, so I feel like you're going for the constant board pressure aggro tactic. I'd highly recommend penance, it's amazing with the quest. Zephrys should go, too many duplicates.
---
When playing agro I hate armor spam jade Druid. When playing Reno I love armor spam jade Druid because I can play giest :). Just about perspective honestly.
---
too violent for my tastes, Blizz needs to nerf asap
---
Well, you're still alive, so not really best
---
I actually think both have interesting and fun metagames right now. Secret mage is a bit strong in wild,  but it definitely has its weaknesses.
---
My favorite is when I give quest rogue Scargill, which is every time I use Fishflinger.
---
Nomi, Zephrys definitely in that order. Amalgam is a nice strong card and will help with win rate but not critical.
---
I wouldn't really bother wasting dust on Finley because often he's drawn to hand when you can't use him until very late game or comes out on tip the scales.  I'd only run finley if he dropped from  a pack (and I'd probably still dust him if I needed to).
---
The flavor texts were extra effort, but made my enjoyment of looking over the set even higher. Well done.
---
Sounds like a good idea üëç
---
Meta will settle soon so less risk
---
My deck has no pathetic cards OP!!
---
Glerek#2629 EU, 80g quest, you go first :)
---
Is there any future to playing mage? None of the current decks seem to be worth a shit?
---
Honestly, picking Shadowflame and Ice Nova could've actually won him the game, assuming Paladin finds no direct damage or that he finds healing first (Lackey, or a bounced Zephrys).
---
I wish it would consider Prep, since that is a classic/basic card.
---
I wouldn't kind new heroes or boards but a whole expansion based on a game I dont care about(overwatch) would be a turn off. I play because it warcraft based not blizzard based. I like Diablo and Starcraft and even an expansion out of them would be too much.
---
Isn't that in wild?
---
Click on the link, the decklists are all Standard.
---
This just looks like the classic card back with a filter and a couple fire particles.
---
I dont see it. Every matchup from at least 6-down has been heavy aggro which just destroys it.
---
you dont craft cards, you craft decks.
---
You need multiple secrets or just 2 Mana remaining in my experience. 
---
Sometimes 2 isn't enough. But with 3 or more it always seems to realize how valuable that is. 
---
Considering I don't think he even knows what class you're against, he probably ranks secrets as very low level threats (as on average, when including Paladin and Rogue, they are)
---
There's no claim or expectation he'll offer 3 perfect cards. Hellfire wasn't the perfect card, but it doesn't have to be.
---
I mean half the heroes are like, war criminals but I don't think anyone in the warcraft universe itself is exactly sane anyway
---
Lol ‚ÄúPERFECT CARD‚Äù
---
For that situation obviously is shadowflame bt some people really dont know how to use Zeph properly ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
you fucked up
---
I had geddon on board and needed mass dispel to push him face for 10 and then +2 end of turn. Hope this clears up what I meant
---
Exactly
---
No it wasn‚Äôt, it was in the meta, but it was like tier 2 at best
---
#Put your faith in the light!
---
One class has to be the lowest. Deal with it. Every class has lists with positive winrates regardless of overall class winrate.
---
Solitaire priest
---
yeah that's what i meant
---
Proud of u!
---
 Also swapping Myra Rotspring for Sn1p-Sn4p is really stong, I would do that instead.
---
AAECAaIHBrICrwTtBaCAA4SmA5+3Awy0Ac0DvQSbBZcGiAekB4YJtPYCo/cCj5cD9acDAA==
---
The point of nomi is to give you an extra win condition if your tip the scales (or natural aggro) doesn't pan out.  It's supposed to be a situational card.   
---
That played win rate though is laughable ... I'm guessing people are not at the end of their deck and just playing it anyway or something because it should generally be an "i win" card when used in all but the rarest of matchups if you've played correctly.   
---
If you are in a meta that fails to clear 2+ boards of murlocs then sure, Zephrys would be the better option.  However as the meta adjusts for the murloc paladin (as it should be) then nomi is your out when they run out of resources.  
---
Zephrys too is rather situational in this deck in that it's really no good until you've run your deck down to around 5 or less cards (RNG dependent here).  
---
Personally I've run them both together  for best results all round.

Dil why people downvoted you, I thought it was amusing
---
I dont have a clue why people downvote. It had +5 upvotes, now +1. I don't understand either.
---
Hey thanks! Been having a lot of fun these past couple expansions.Loved Brode and was nervous after he left but they have done a great job.
---
The secret isn't to wish for infinite wishes, you have to wish to infinite genies! I learned that from my friend Pat Springleaf.
---
I only know who that is bc I see him mentioned a lot. I started in witchwood and only got serious around end of boomsday. My first meta deck was control warrior (tho I made a lot of adjustments bc I only crafted boom) then reno mage lol. I usually make my own stuff just for fun. OG reno mage is the best deck of all time honestly
---
Huh? Even if you misplayed nomi without the effect it's a 6/6 late game vs a what ... 1 mana 1/2 or worse?  
---
Even drawing nomi early you should have plenty of other cards to play on curve and keep tempo.  I even have preferred to draw nomi early at times as it means lens can't change costs with her.  
---
I really question if people truly know how to play this deck properly.  It's a testament to the power of the deck though that even less skilled players can do well with it hence the large win rate.
---
I would hope not.
---
Warrior and Warlock are able to build highlander decks without a class specific legendary card for it, and giving the classes currently without a specific highlander reward card could very easily usher Hearthstone into a sort of Highlander Winter similar to just how much of an impact Genn and Baku had on last year.
---
But keysmith is the better choice
---
I think the Nomi winrates are a bit skewed because most decks that could already get passed the first 29 cards in that deck can probably beat Nomi.
---
It's usual thing :) to get countered, this game is rock paper and scissors. 
---
If something can beat eveyrthing it will be get nerfed (cards or series of cards hall of famed or changed the stats)   :)
---
Just enjoy playing the game, and try to understand in which time slot your performance is best and you not hardly countered :)
---
Seeking additional info, streamers and websites, is good advice, as is dusting bad cards. Another option is learning the game through arena.
---
Yes but what are the best draws?
---
When I was a new player I didn‚Äôt really have much of an issue down near the bottom of the rankings. There‚Äôs a meme about ‚Äúrank 20 plays‚Äù that even if they‚Äôre playing meta decks they‚Äôre probably gonna misplay. 
---
I‚Äôd try to open packs from all the different standard expansions since you‚Äôre guaranteed a legend within the first 10 packs. 
---
Once you finally get enough resources for meta decks the game is a blast. Hope you hang in there!
---
Play arena or dust everything and craft the top meta deck once the meta stabalises.
---
It would be nice. At the very least it isn't a hopeless card. Maybe if they actually push Dragon Paladin a bit more in the next expansion it will have a shot.
---
Yep one game I was playing as tempo rogue and rolled a colossus on my Pharaoh cat. Next turn they played bloodstinger and pulled the colossus
---
I hope to see Tri-class come back in the next expansion.
---
It was time to test your mettle.
---
How did you get?
---
sulf#21170 EU 80g, I show, you go first.
---
Frozen clone into mech warper then a lot of magnetized sn1p-sn4ps
---
You get a legend in the first ten packs of each set, so buy packs from each set one at a time until you get your legend. It‚Äôs random when you get them after that until you get to your 40th pack in a set without opening one, then it‚Äôs guaranteed. But you should get one on average every 20 or so. So buy from just one set until you get your legend, unless you don‚Äôt care about legends from that set anymore.
---
You can‚Äôt open duplicate legends unless you have all of them from that set. So if you plan on continuing to open a set then don‚Äôt disenchant any legends, otherwise you might just get another one. I opened 3 [[Blackhowl Gunspire]] before I learned this when I could‚Äôve gotten usable cards.
---
Actually, don‚Äôt dust anything unless you REALLY know you don‚Äôt need it and even then wait until whatever you are crafting makes a playable deck. You‚Äôd be surprised how many subpar cards become parts of big decks after new expansions and nerfs. If you want to dust golden cards that you already have or golden legends to make a regular legend of your choice that‚Äôs up to you. I dust my goldens I don‚Äôt use first, when I need to, and don‚Äôt dust any golden legend that‚Äôs playable because you‚Äôll probably be needing it again at some point, but that‚Äôs your choice. My biggest regret when starting is how much I dusted stuff I thought I wouldn‚Äôt need and regret it.
---
There is a 5$ new player bundle. Ten packs of classic and a dragon legend. If you have 5$, it‚Äôs a good buy.
---
Look up dekcklists and watch other players. There is more strategy then it seems, even with Zoo, and knowing your matchups lets you know when you have to kill certain minions or when you should go for face damage.
---
Try only buying packs from this year. When the set after the next comes out Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rumble will leave standard. You‚Äôll get more bang for your buck that way.
---
Stick with one deck as you rank up. Feel free to alter it to the meta, but jumping from deck to deck isn‚Äôt going to get you better at playing any one deck.Spellbreaker is a great Zoo card against anything with taunt, reborn, and lots of other minions and finds it way into the deck a lot, and there are other cards you can include to give you a better chance against specific decks. I‚Äôm playing wild at the moment, but from what I understand aggro decks like zoo aren‚Äôt the best right now. There are a bunch of different sites that monitor the meta and put up winning decklists to emulate and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find your favorites. I used hsreplay at first but have switched to using tempostorm lately for wild and the write ups about each deck.
---
Try to do the 60g quests and remember every 3 wins nets you 10g, up to 100g a day. So you can buy a pack a day if you can play enough.
---
Try new decks and complete quests with friends. You can use your friends decks when playing against them and most quests can be done against friends. So try out new decks your contemplating from other people and complete quests with them if you don‚Äôt have the right class for the quest.
---
Safest legend to craft right now is probably [[zilliax]] as its neutral, powerful, and can turn even [[mecharoo]] into a powerhouse attacker. But if it doesn‚Äôt fit into your deck, don‚Äôt bother.
---
Message me if you‚Äôre on the North American server. I don‚Äôt have up to date standard stuff but you can try some wild decks whose power level is much higher, or just practice.

Basically there is a combo, like other said:

 Bees + Linecracker + Earthen Scales = too much armor

Linecracker will overkill using bees on it, creating an huge VERY HUGE attack.

Then, you use Earthen Scales and you got that much attack.

Kibler is great to watch but I feel that dekkster is making to many mistakes to take him seriously.

I knew nobody was playing it but I wasn‚Äôt sure how bad Highlander Mage actually was now. Has the win rate totally ranked?

Amusingly, while Highlander Druid and Paladin aren‚Äôt things, Quest Druid and Murloc Paladin have both been known to use Zephrys and Elise/Finley. I got the Druid quest for my free one, so I‚Äôve been playing a lot of that. Been debating crafting Zephrys and Elise for it.

big edwin maybe, two combo activators at worst case.

---
? Rogue had plenty of combo decks in the past. Warrior had only control warrior for several expansions.
---
He thinks 0 attack minions are not a threat for you(Doomsayer is an exception) so he doesn't feel the need to kill them. Which is incredibly stupid in my opinion. Why would anyone play a 0 attack minion if it wasn't a threat? Zephrys needs to be taught to fear abilities more than attack if you are not in immidiate danger to die.
---
Brutal
---
legend ranks is based on your deck's winrate in the last 20-50 games or so, can't remember exact number. So if you are on a losing streak and went into dumpster legend ranks, you will lose rank despite winning a game sometime, it happens to me as well. I have been at top 50 legend and dumpster 2000-3000 range before.
---
gold and dust are progression though to be fair
---
Snowfury giant doesn't exist in standard.
---
Then what happens if evolve on a 10 drop? Does it stays a 10 drop or go puff?

I might try to build some budget quest decks in the near future. Not sure if it's possible. Rogue Quest, for example, can be activated with cheap cards, so you can complete it on budget. That's a starting point. However, it promotes a slightly slower playstyle, so you'd typically want some big payoff cards in a deck like that, such as Tess. All of those payoff cards are expensive. So whether there's a way to find enough value on a budget is uncertain.
---
Both Tempo Rogue and Token Druid are performing fine according to statistics. Rogue has more random effects and can be more varies between games, so perhaps that is a reason to prefer it. Druid has a slightly higher winrate, but still within margin of error so it is not possible to confidently say which one is better.
---
Now with some global statistics available, it could be possible to look for improvements to the decks too. Hench-Clan Hogsteed seems to be underperforming in Druid, the deck might be better if some suitable replacement could be found. Not sure what that would be on a budget. SN1P-SN4P would be ideal for a full-cost version.
---

League is definitely has bugs, but they are usually fixed (if they're big or unless you're Morde). Balance is definitely questionable, but with their decisions it's pretty safe to say the patches aren't meant to balance the game, it's meant to change up the meta picks so the game stays fresh.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I'm thinking of adding a second healbot, but not sure what to switch out. Fencing coach is there to either complete the quest or make shudderwock or C'thun go crazy. Coldlight helps with card draw and irritates control/combo decks.
---
Oh that is nothing. Try [[Avenging Wrath]] when your opponent has Eternium Rover

---
I would suggest trying to save up as much gold as you can and playing back through the old solo adventures. They award tons of useful cards for your collection and some cards that are still meta in wild if you are interested in that. Otherwise, they are great sources for dust
---
Notably, Blizzard seems to have even started using slow animations as a game balancing factor in some recent cases, notably echo Snip-Snap, where the power of the OTK deck is overtly limited by the speed of the animations and the speed of your device. They even included dramatic game show-style ticking clock music to add to the feeling the pressure is on.
---
I don't know. One of my worst mistakes that I regretted was dusting cards when I first started that I thought I was never going to use only to then realise a new deck I wanted to try needed them and costing me more in the long run.
---
If you keep doing this, you‚Äôre pretty much guaranteed to get 12 wins
---
Was in good mood, so i played it and started to watch TV on the side. Normally i concede those too tho.
---
If boom is so broken then why isn‚Äôt he a problem in wild? The answer is there are so many other good cards to deal with him which means instead of disfiguring good cards you should print out new or buff some old to achieve balance.
---
Plot twist takes forever sometimes for no reason. At least you can understand starfall is two animations.
---
I mean... you can be whatever you want.
---
my god, you mad man, Do you use that 6 mana 6-6 that gives back discards cards?
---
What are your thoughts on running Mana Wyrm or Mana Addict?
---
oh I mean nomi priest, sorry for not clarifying. I'm aware of nomi in the other decks.
---
Check your engine, it might have crabs (hungry ones).
---
I play cheap 160 armor druid with Mecha'thun finisher in wild. Secret mages and skulking geist players kick my ass but I don't really care. The Mecha'thun otk is so cool.
---
I was there not too long ago. Here's my advice: play the long game. Don't expect to climb the ladder quickly. It takes time. Here's a few more tips:
---
1) Do your daily bounties. Make sure you recycle any that aren't your style (ie. 3 wins with a druid if you aren't a druid player). Keep an eye out for the "Watch a friend" and "Challenge a friend" quests. Watching gets you a free classic pack and challenge gets both of you 80 gold each.
---
2) Play casual and send friend requests to everyone you play (at least for a while). This will add a ton of people to watch and challenge. And they can do the same to you.
---
3) Stockpile gold and dust for new expansion day. This can be daunting, but you've got to be disciplined if you're going to remain free to play. Daily bounties throughout the season get me enough to buy a few dozen packs (48-60). Don't craft anything till a full month into a new expansion.
---
4) If you're going to buy a preorder bundle (which is the cheapest way to buy packs) make sure you buy the first expansion of the year. Currently, that would've been Rise of Shadows. We're currently in the second set (Saviors of Uldum) and we'll have one more this year. April should be the next major expansion to buy the preorder for. Why? Because those cards will have a full 2 years of play before rotating out of standard.
---
5) Check websites like hsreplay.net. They have meta data on what decks are doing the best at the moment. You can also copy decklists and import them right into your collection. You might not have all the cards, but you can get good ideas for what is strong at the time.
---
6) The first 10 packs of any set will include 1 legendary. After that, they average 1 in 20, but you'll be guaranteed 1 in 40. After your first legendary in the classic set, don't buy any more. Tavern brawls will award you a free pack every week and you'll have a solid collection in no time.
---
7) Learn from content creators. There's a ton out there, but I watch Dekkster, Regis Killbin, Kripparrian, and Brian Kibbler to name a few. They'll have card analysis, best cards to craft, meta decks, experimental decks, and a ton more. Also, I recommend The Angry Chicken podcast. 
---
Most of all, have fun. This is one of the rare mobile games with longevity. If you stick with it, you can play this game for years. Good luck!
---
*Job's done!*
---
check the angry chicken podcast; they interviewed the developers
---
Nah. The card is fair and balancee but the linecracker overkill is the problem.
---
But that's more because of the deck archetype and not this individual card. If the archetype was strong then this card unchanged would be seen as strong too. It's better to target the cards that would be weak in the archetype.
---
Same we can't just play on the chinese client. They got cool stuff like tournament mode.
---
Yeah but I kind of like the play style of combo decks. Fighting to survive and right when you‚Äôre about to die BOOM combo saves you or kills opponent. Or you just die if you can‚Äôt assemble it in time.
---
Just playing powerfully statted minions on curve gets old too, no?
---
The big difference between Hearthstone and Clash Royale is that in CR you will never be able to compete with players who spend money.  Their team will always be higher level than yours and you can't overcome that advantage through 'good play'.  It would be like playing Hearthstone but your opponents minions all have better stats than yours for the same cost.  So they can afford to be 'generous' with rewards because no matter what crumbs they give you, you will still have an incentive to spend.
---
Hearthstone is different.  It is already possible to reach the highest ranks as F2P.  Any good arena player can get a functionally full (i.e. all meta cards) collection, but even without arena, through decent collection and quest management you can easily build decks to get you to legend and beyond in time if you're good enough.  Give away much more free stuff and there will be little incentive to spend any money at all because unlike CR there is a hard cap on your strength (your fireball always costs 4 and deals 6 the same as your opponents').
---
I got in the bundle and was pretty ticked, is it competitive at all?
---
I seriously wish I could gain some consensus in the issue. The arena is much more fun without MCT. They should ban this card right away from the Standard Format as well.
---
I could see getting bored with Druid or Paladin, but Shaman and Priest look like they have a lot of flexibility. I wouldn't write off Warrior, though. That one could get strong with a bit more support.
---
He is broken in standard for being a very powerful hero card simply offering powerful armor, all mechs rush, and consistent Omega Devastators. 
---
He is weak in wild easily because DK Guldan, Rexxar and Jaina tools are way stronger. Standard cards vs Dr Boom don't offer much power compared to his level. Warrior have an extreme amount of field clearing, Rush, AOE spams, Mech rushing. Even Hunter struggles to stay on the board with it's consistent clearing, it becomes RNG at this point with Zul'Jin jumping in that you win, or not.
---
they could add a battle pass ;)
---
You don't need to upvote it.
---
Oh honey, there are way more.  But only two (this one and "attack helicopter"?) have been memeified to such extent that people do not feel complicit in transphobia when they regurgitate them.
---
oh okay.
---
Well I think Nomi Priest is quite interesting, at least I saw only two players, both CN.
---
The overall winrate of both decks on HsReplay (all ranks) is with 41% and 44% very low.
---
I have played some games with the one by Matsuri\_HS and I think the profits a lot from people thinking you are Combo Priest. Players don't use this to "bluff", which is sad.
---
The Deck is hard to play, do I really want to play Seance on my Wild Pyromancer vs aggro or on the enemy minion?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's 100% not a top deck and the big winner of the deck (in my experience) is Grave Horror, not Chef Nomi. I think a "normal" player can't rank with this deck, the matchups and how to play is so different, but if you like the challenge the deck is super fun!
---
I see Mech Paladin, I upvote..
---
But seriously, the Paladin spread is so diverse...
---
Like, last meta it was only OTK Pally and Mech Pally, now there's so much more..
---
Also the Wild Mech Handbuff Pally is the exact same as last time I think...
---
you dummy, it was stealthed so ofc Zephyryryryrs couldnt see it
---
Cleaning commences
---
Outjerked
---
Messy messy
---
lol
---
That's weird, so what was the board state then. You had a one attack minion, what was it? What did your opponent have exactly? If he had more than one minion, Zeph may have thought backstab wasn't good enough.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea but tbh the card that wrecks this deck most is [[Skulking Geist]]
---
Can‚Äôt do combo if it‚Äôs played early and even if I already pulled combo off makes me lose the infinite value jades and start taking fatigue damage in addition to no board.

There are HS bots on the ladder that do this on purpose so people concede. Real people don't have that patience :)

that's a very valid suggestion, you should also post it on their official forum

Feel free to steal if you want to, I never go there.

You can add **Lifesteal** to the minion to give it an *even longer* animation time, skipped some streamer turn iirc
---
I hate that the startup animation plays for battlecrys that don't actually trigger. Like If u okay wasp without a lackey it starts the animation then fizzles. Maybe some people like that idk.
---
People theorize the third set of the year is directly dragon themed because of the 3 set promo hint images.
---
Zacusca#21211 Asia, i show you go first
---
Much passive agressivity around here.
---
this is way funnier than the comment that got silver lmao
---
The most amazing thing about this is that Flamestrike wasn't involved.
---
If he completes his turn after 30 seconds and then uses the remaining 60 seconds to plan his next turn like in Grandmasters sometimes it'd be annoying but somewhat fine i guess.
---
But this here is intentionally roping with the goal to make ppl concede. You can notice this in the early turns when there is not much planning/concidering needed. He plays a minon within 5 seconds and then just goes afk for the remaining 85 seconds. And his name tells you his intention aswell.
---
Back to your statement that it isn't wrong. I don't know if its against the games rules but "ethically" it's wrong.
---
You'd have to actually review reported players though because the system is easily abused. Probably too much effort
---
Noone gives a fuck
---
I just recently started auto-squelching my opponents on ladder. I'm missing some funny and friendly interactions but overall i'm feeling better now not having to face emote BM-ing anymore.

5/3/7 | On each player's turn, the first card played costs (0).  
---
It takes time because HS is a casual mobile game and it's purposely made for that crowd. Animations are slow and clear so you know what's going on. It's not a game made for the hardcore competitive people. 
---
At this point I'm pretty sure that it can't even be fixed, like it would take an insane amount of work to calculate if the actions that are going to happen are going to have any impact, and if it isn't the case get in with it. Like a frothing berserker hit by beeeees. It's just going to die, you don't need to raise it's attack every time.
---

---
you have both zephrys and reno... dang
---
So much creativity, this is really good. You must have worked for a long time for this.
---
Sorry, but that would require Blizzard devs to: put effort into the game and worst of all, actually work. Can't have that. Enjoy your 3 expansios per year, buy it up goyim.
---
This is not an adventure like Naxx or LoE, it‚Äôs literally taking money for nothing. In LoE we got 90 cards, here you get a random legendary for preordering lol, this should be called: give us your money, not Adventure. Couldn‚Äôt care less about this bs.

If you can't beat 'em join 'em. I used to really hate aggro as i only played midrange. But after i made a budget zoolock i understand the enjoyment. Wether it's degenerated or not i don't want to judge.

Try firing off Reno at a board with a Frothing Berzerker on it. Legit think it took a minute for all 10 hits to land. But on the plus side he made pretty little colored orbs appear before each shot.

What took the most time was the solo and the druid skin, between the emotes, the bosses and decklists.. Took weeks alone, but I was greatly helped by u/Reptile27

Nat Pagle and Lorewalker Cho threaten the opponent psychologically, do not underestimate them.
---
Lifesteal itself is a completely fine mechanic (tho if we're going by lore and flavor really suits warlocks the best) but just gets slapped on so many cards without much rhyme or reason like how are cards like Zilliax or Shirvallah vampiric in nature?

---
I ain't nothing but a Vulnerable Road Dog.
---
I think it wouldn't be super long before people manage to craft the good decks again. They may just dust cards from different classes so they can have a few top tier decks. Would take a bit of time, but I imagine this is what would happen initially. Eventually people would have larger collections again.
---
I'm assuming you want this because you find it frustrating to play against expensive meta decks/ whales. Your idea wouldn't change things too much.
---
Separate idea: A seasonal mode where you all start fresh. You have some kind of gold multiplier so you can get way more packs. Idk. That seems like a fun idea too maybe?
---
Do also save some of that niceness for u/Reptile27 he did just as much work as I did!
---
Right. And once they shake the meta up, if you don‚Äôt have the new cards they used, which is likely since your $80 got you 4 legendaries, your old deck is obsolete. At least you can DE cards, but now you can‚Äôt play your favorite old cards in wild if you do that.
---
MtG can become real competitor, under condition they don't fuck up their own game, which right now are honestly trying to.
---
You are right, that‚Äôs why I put it in the ok category and not higher, against aggro it can turn the board back (or kill you) and it can also offer surprise lethal in other situations... 
---

Even though I dusted Legendaries as a new player, I recommend to others not to do it because it's so not worth it. Better have slightly more patience for 400 dust rather than find out that a Legendary becomes playable in the future and you threw it away.
---
Doomtown uses people like Wyatt Earp and Abraham Lincoln as real characters in their alternate universe version of the west. 
---
But a lot of characters in hearthstone are still alive in the warcraft universe (Sylvanas, khadgar, Reno jackson), and I don't know of many card games that use living public figures.

5/5/5 | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, duplicate your hand.  
---
Also, plot twist pauses for a full second of so when cast and you think the game has cast. In general quest completion animations need to be sped up. They take up half the rope and that is just unacceptable. 
---
Reborn animations need to be sped up too. If you are trying to double trade into a reborn minion near the rope you can easily miss the attack on the second spawning of the reborn minion because it's reborn animation takes too long
---
Yea, I just saw that. Certainly a better player than I am.

I feel you.  I am running a few highlander quest pally variants and dealing with these refined nuisances as well.  Playing a highlander deck has the added frustration of being even less consistent and harder to refine.  I'd like to see the shaman quest get bumped up a notch.  Not only doesn't it have a clear weakness but the deck list is pretty flexible so you can tech in a few things if you are dealing with different pocket metas.
---
That‚Äôs not true as the rope animation only shows at the beginning of the turn if no action at all took place in the previous turn.
---
I hate such players
---
Playing against Malchezaar is so fucking fun. I literally replayed the encounter for like 2 hours a few weeks ago seeing what busted combos I could pull off with Medivh's deck.
---
Whats the difference though?
---
There‚Äôs literally no difference between cards that someone grinded for and cards that someone paid for. The problem here seems to be that you‚Äôre jealous of the people who spend money, and if that‚Äôs the case, you might as well go ahead and spend money.
---
Also, way more people than you think have spent no money on their decks. They‚Äôve spent no money, and will not spend any money if there is no option to spend money. They would, however, still have more cards than you do, causing you to complain again.
