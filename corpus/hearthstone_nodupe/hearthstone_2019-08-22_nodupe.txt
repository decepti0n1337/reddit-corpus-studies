nah.

it isn't even close to the broken combos out there
---
Like, 1 in 6, and the other options would be big minions too. I really don't get what the point of this post is
---
me too
---
Yeah but the longer the game the more chance you have of highrolling in return and possibly making a comeback (at least with some decks)
---
Yeah, Dalaran Heist was great. I can only hope that the next adventure will be as good if not better, that would save the expansion for me. There's no doubt in my mind that some of the people working on Hearthstone are incredibly talented and know what fun actually is, it's just that... they don't apply that to every part of the team, so to speak. 
---
But enough negativity. Thank you to the mission game designers and thank you to the people who make tavern brawls. Thank you voice actors and thank you guys who make boards and card arts and stuff for breathing so much life into this card game and separating it from all the rest. You guys genuinely deserve a medal, cause I don't think Hearthstone would have been much more different than the original wow ccg had it not been for you! &lt;3

This. The more I think the game is starting to feel super stale, the more I realize it's not because of Classic/Basic, it's because of Team5's inability to design interesting sets and cool new designs. I play Magic quite a bit as well, and Magic has cards that have literally been in every Standard format. Hell, Giant Growth was printed in ALPHA (the first set ever, 26 years ago) and still gets reprinted at least once a year, and Magic doesn't feel stale, even though I've been playing it quite a bit longer than Hearthstone. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
To me, the biggest issue with Hearthstone, as a game, is that they've limited the space they can work with so much by: not having Graveyard interaction, real Deck interaction, meaningful interaction with the opponent outside of minion combat, like targeted Discard, instant-speed spells/counterspells. I'm not saying Hearthstone should do all of this, but having none of it limits what they can do with designs so much, since everything has to be focused on improving yourself or controlling the board.
---
Amara reads "set your health to 40". Nothing about heal or restore.
---
You can‚Äôt be serious lol
---
For anyone else who does want to know the odds: 1/minions left in deck.
---
I disagree, random legend = 1 you dont have meaning 1 you didnt craft. I craft the legendaries I need. What I don‚Äôt craft are other cards like epics and rares. 1 legend you dont use is worth less to me than possibly rares ad epics that havent been crafted yet
---
This weeks brawl, and those like it are kind of frustrating for me.  Not only do I not have most of the cards outside of standard, but I don't know those cards either.  It's really hard to play even semi intelligently when you don't know what is even able to be played.  
---
Also, shaman is stupid good in this brawl because they have great elemental, totem, and murloc synergies that you can mash together.
---
JUST WISH DONT SUFFER IN SILENCE
---
 ......
---
I'm a fucking idiot, aren't I?
---
1 pack is equivalent to 40 dust on average on legend is = to 400 dust
---
Wild is definitely not more f2p friendly than standard, especially not for a new player. You have to craft almost every single card in your deck, which is far far beyond a new players means. Play standard, at the very least until your first rotation, wild is for old players and rich players.
---
It's the only other minion in my deck you fool!
---
actually if you play amara while a \[\[Auchenai Soulpriest\]\] is on the board , you die , it doesn't  say it heals you but it seems to do that , many peole have told be me about it

There is an issue because I, in my infinite idiocity, made the 'summon giant' a deathrattle minion instead of a battlecry one, meaning people can evolve into the 1/0 minion that would instantly die and give them a 8/8.
---
You could make the argument that as Death Knight is a class in WoW, cards that are from the Death Knight "class" count as being from a different class while Ysera doesn't fulfill that same criteria.
---
But weapon destruction clears half the board, with the addition of preventing next turn damage from the weapon, and possibly bouncing a good minion for my opponent. Yes, you can say that he is not aware some of these things (for example the weapon deathrattle specifics), but you can't say the choices he gave "makes complete sense".
---
You're playing control warrior. I feel no sympathy for you
---
How about no?
---
Dexterity and responsiveness really shouldn't determine the outcome in any card game as MtG has shown through the banning of cards like Chaos Orb in all formats.
---
In Hearthstone especially where mobile connections can be a temperamental as they are, QTE really cannot be implemented. That goes double when you consider players playing with a physical keyboard would have a distinct advantage over those playing with a touchscreen.
---
Plus, if a card is balanced assuming the player successfully completes these QTE every time, what would even be the point?
---
ALL MINIONS
---
Golakka crawler is better if it gets silenced.
---
Priest would actually benefit greatly from a spell that increases the HP of minions in your deck
---
Reposts get downvotes
---
If they are nerfed don‚Äôt we get a refund?
---
That‚Äôs what I thought as well.  My first game I just did an auto deck complete with hunter and it had no synergy but still almost won. Then I did Murdoch buff magnetics with hungry crabs and prelate.

It's time for Dool Paladin.

Turn 1 Northshire Cleric into Turn 2 double +2 health. Turn 3 second northshire cleric and Injured Tol‚Äôvir.

Completely agree. The removal of player agency in card selection lead to Monster Hunt and most especially the unbelievably awful Rumble Run being so much less enjoyable.

Really not a fan of some of the "twists" like crowded streets as well.

Toggwagle‚Äôs scheme (shuffle a card into your deck; upgrades each turn)
---
they actually are a huge part of the deck as they act like mini provide a bit of burst damage while also keeping your health up and if you bog slosh them they provide an even greater amount of health regen. between the anklebiters, weaponized wasps, 2 damage lackeys, lifedrinkers and hopefully 2 more similar insta damage minions with the discover a battlecry minion spells, on top of double battlecries, you can shred the opponent pretty quickly in most games.

You had a good point before the attack started.

Togwaggle's Scheme..

1 mana Shuffle 1 copy of a minion into your deck (Upgrades each turn!)

So basically you survive and draw your combo pieces and with gadgetzan you can draw quickly until your deck is empty.
---
the combo is...augmented Elekk, mogu, shadow of death..this shuffles 6 copies of the mogu into your deck that is summoned to the field next turn. You then play the last mogu from hand ( 7 on board), then play alextraza to get oponent to 15, end turn....=win.

QTE should be easier on mobile than on PC, to the point that it's fair. Lots of testing needed to determine the right amount, but I think they could get it pretty balanced between PC and mobile.

Also why u such a hater? How about no? Really? This is a discussion post, I ask you nicely to share your opinion, I didn't just say "QTE WOULD BE COOL AMIRIGHT?"?
---
The first round of Dungeon Runs. 
---
OG DR had us play 9 normal classes, with shared treasures, and a whole bunch of RNG-related encounters. 
---
WW Had 4 special classes, each with their own unique treasures, and a set final boss (along with a climactic finale). 
---
RR had no special classes, but special starting things per class, and unique treasures per class as well. 
---
So far, Heist seems to be a major revamp of OG DR, with the focus on 9 different classes and a lot more shared unique treasures. 
---
If the SoU single player goes the way I'm thinking, we could have 5 heroes to pick from this time, being the League of Explorers, which would probably be their own unique class instead similar to WW.
---

---
sometimes u win on tempo as well. lol.

Team 5 is made up of flawed humans, and those flawed humans will make mistakes.
---
Granted, Hearthstone has always worn its randomness on its sleeve, and a card like Conjurer's Calling is exactly the sort of card Hearthstone is known for.
---
it sounds like it's just something that was outside the skillset of anyone on staff so instead of outsourcing the job to someone who knew what they were doing they wasted far more time/money fumbling around with it for a year until they finally gave up.

Shaman battlecry cards are 4x more likely to be discovered than neutral battlecry minions, not to mention that the batlecry pool is immense.

that would explain how rarely i do nab one. but fire elementals, weaponized wasps, spring rockets, any of the do damage battlecries doubled up are very effective
---
Agreed. Whats your take on Barista? I think she's a bit of a win more card because she's only playable in the late game and only leaves you with 3 mana to play minions
---
Oh okay, just thought it looked like the Whizbang big warrior deck
---
&gt; not using high apm to play mountain giant for 0 mana while burning cards
---
Its from a time when all of the totems (barring Draenei once they were added to WoW) were the same. Every Horde Shaman used that totem model for many years.

Wizards of the Coast for one by banning cards like Chaos Orb from all formats including Vintage, the one format where pretty much everything can be played. Card games generally test your know-how and ability to think on your feet, not how well you can manipulate keys on a keyboard.

Pretty sure he meant double as in both types.
---
Broad strokes:  
---
Garrosh is wearing the Tusks of Mannoroth. Mannoroth was a big nasty powerful \[\[Pit Lord\]\]. When the demons came to Draenor, Gul'dan convinced the orcs to drink the blood of Mannoroth. The first one to drink was \[\[Grommash Hellscream\]\], Garrosh's father. The blood gave the orcs increased strength, endurance, aggression, and bloodlust, but it also bound them to the demons of the Legion. It also turned their skin green.  
---
Way later, after shenanigans, the orcs had been without demon blood for years because the demons had abandoned them. When the Legion invaded Azeroth once again, Mannoroth was around and decided to take advantage of his failed army. Grommash had been fighting with the night elves and \[\[Cenarius\]\] had finally come to fight. Being a demigod, Grommash and the orcs weren't powerful enough to hurt Cenarius. When scouts found a fountain full of demon blood that Mannoroth had corrupted, Grommash decided him and his crew should drink up. They managed to beat Cenarius, but they were once again forced into being the Legion's servants.
---
Thrall and Jaina manage to beat Grommash's forces and free them from Mannoroth. Thrall and Grommash go after Mannoroth and though Grommash gets the killing blow, it turns out pit lords explode when they die and Grommash gets caught in the blast. With Mannoroth dead, the orcs are forever freed from his blood curse.
---
So basically, years later, Garrosh becomes warchief and decides to turn his dad's greatest achievement into clothes.
---
&gt; Easily the worst card art in the game.
---
That's a little harsh. I mean, the art itself is pretty good and it's relevant to "taunt" mechanic, just the crop &amp; small size really suck in this case.

You realize the 7 armor hero power is the worst of the bunch? If you calculate how much armor Dr boom generates on average per turn you will get a pretty low number. If it was for the armor, it's better not to use Dr boom and stay with the original hero power.

I didn't think it was a live snake, i thought it was a *totem* of a snake.

And I think you overestimate the amount of people who played WoW and play hearthstone. And i actually did play it, but that was a long time ago
---
*when I didn't get Zephrys in 30 packs but I have enough dust to craft a golden one*
---
Fine , I'll do it myself
---
Hearthstone is more expensive to play competitively now. Prepare yourself for some credit card usage.
---
I just love trying everything in standard then seeing what i can do with it in Wild.
---
i've had play 50 murlocs stuck on my quest list forever.
---
You can even play infinite crabs just eat your own minions
---
this is standard lol
---
this was in standard
---
Which then summon the üÖ±ancient One
---
lmao
---
Just go to add a friend and top right of the box will be the last person you played against.
---
Yeah with Halazzi the quest was very easy to complete. I wanted to run it in this deck too, but then again I'm too poor to craft it :(
---
You wild players are pretty agressive and oppressive. Anyway, I can still tell that wombo combos granting 2k5 armor or summoning a full board on turn 3/4 is actually bullshit to me. Everyone their own fashion.

Hsreplay, metastats, vicioussyndicate, the new hearthpwn (RIP). There are many out there. I use metastats to figure out which decks to play at lower ranks and then find the decks on hsreplay to figure out matchups and mulligans.

M'Cthun Priest anyone??

Duh? How else does he fly when he uses his hero power? :‚Äô)

They're 1 mana minions, but when you play them, they costed 0, so they don't advance the quest.

Holy shit, no one has ever used that response before!

Oh, i'm surprised people find this infuriating. I like to think that my opponent just want to take their time, or maybe they're just busy.
---
It's a pretty odd list, with kalecgos and sylvanas, those two are a bit slow for the wild metagame right now.
---
Never played priest, hm?
---
It would be fun if Sir Finley of the sands was a 3/6 to call back to his original stats as a 1/3 (with adjusted mana cost ofc)
---
Well, your irrational hate just caused your collection serious economic damage. You better hope that you don't find yourself drooling over a tempo warrior in the future.
---
Maybe in a year or two. This is a crazy expensive meta right now.
---
Honestly maybe it's better you return next year before the rotation in april. That's when Blizzard usually tries to convince people to return to the game by giving out a lot of packs.
---
Not sure if I've beaten them with Hunter either, but when I do beat them with other classes it's because I was super aggressive. You need to beat them before they can play their eggs and whelps after completing the quest. I think it is important to note that they're all about board control so if you can keep them off, you'll win the game. Obviously harder says than done.
---
I ended up cutting toxfin for being too slow
---
Yeah, they're murlocs looking at the snake totem. Obviously.
---
Why not just nerf him into "still pretty good" and let him be "still pretty good" *somewhere*?
---
 EU - Aniparktos#2804  for quest 80g trade. i show , you go first

It was posted by flux himself yesterday.
---
Oh forgot that brawl was standard
---
Beautiful art! You nailed the style! Also, I love the colour palette.
---
Sounds like someone just lost to Zephrys.
---
Literally no one complains about Zephrys lmao...
---
nah, I think it‚Äôs preety balanced, you have to have only 1 copies of cards and you have to play into it. In my opnion zephrys is a card with the best design in entire hearthstone history.
---
Reactive decks have been a thing since Hearthstone first became a thing and in most other card games. If some people prefer that style then all the power to them
---
The most fun deck i played is the 4 minion combo deck with fhising scargail snip snap alakir and mechwarper. The deck aint bad.
---
Thx sherlock
---
NO...
---
Dismissive lol. Last bastion of the moron. It's amazing that you can say so little in so many comments.
---
I agree with you - this is absolutely stupid.
---
Reposting something that's literally on the hot page when you open this sub?
---
There you go guys, ask for more deckslots...
---
It is based off wins. The guy you played was probably 0-0 too or something similar.

Ive faced onfly merloc paly's so far so that might come up at some point wich i gues 1/4 times are able to rush me down. but mages i feel like might be the easyest yet for me. just hold back on armor a bit then heal back up with ziliax and start armoring up heavily mid game.
---
This isnt standart my man.
---
Why would they do something now when you're the only one complaining? You realize team 5 doesn't work for you, right?
---
Gave me 3  for 3 wins - Thanks!
---
I've been playing since pre-naxx and that is so untrue lmfao nice bait
---
I don't think there will be twitch packs given away this weekend. At least they haven't said anything about it, afaik.
---
Play ever 1 mana removal and mull hard for storm volcano and the 3 mana overload 5 one.
---
Pretty nice pull, Jones is an og favourite for me
---
Incoming the same paid post but with CC instead of Naga (although the actual problem in the combo are the Giants).
---
But needs a change, some fresh air
---
Ghostlyboo#2432 NA want to trade 80g quest, ill show but you will have to go first
---
King Phaoris is still decent.
---
Someone make the scargil, into galv, into bran, into two 7 health minion into two star aligners.
---
The AU one would def do it physically though. Remember Swol'Dan at the end of the Nighthold?
---
Hey there, sharpsh007er's Zephrys, you can't put Sacrificial Pact into your deck.
---
Same! Idk if I just got lucky or what but 5 legendaries including a golden malacrass
---
I really believe so, enough that I texted my buddies who play saying ‚ÄúCelebrate boys, today‚Äôs the end of the Doctors reign‚Äù and I hope I don‚Äôt have to eat my words in 3 hours
---
*Hearthstone can be whatever I want.*
---
Wow nice!
---
Yeah it took me a while to beat the whole thing, Dungeon Run takes longer though I think. Dalaran Heist Chapter 5 on heroic is the most bullshit by far, takes ridiculous RNG to beat once, let alone with every class.
---
I've been looking at this wrong the whole time....
---
Deserved for playing big spell mage tbh
---
Rip
---
&gt;Will they increase the no of packs per chapter?
---
Doubtful because previous adventure sold well and was a huge success
---
&gt;Will the final reward be something like another Whizbang type Legendary?
---
Zayle was a miss so I hope they will give something different this time
---
Many cards to be honest so instead of directly answering your question, I'm going to say it would have been fun and interesting to see Moorabi in Mage.
---
yeah i know i said that , to the wrong person yes but the reply is there , also we where not talking about amara killing you with auchenai soulpriest on the board , we were talkinhg about reno
---
I'd like to see how possible it is for the card to just double the base health of a minion. Like if you power word shield a Northshire (so to 1/5) it still gains +3 from its base health after you play Divine Spirit. Might mean the card doesn't have early game value but will perhaps see play on higher cost minions with more base health.
---
I get you but two specific cards that you can run two copies of makes it more likely than it sounds.
---
there was a nerf leak saying it will be nerfed back to 3 mana
---
Barnabus is really well done!
---
Seinfeld.
---
Huh. Sounds good to me.
---
I think the dumb part of divine spirit is that it 'doubles' health. In a game so meticulous with its numbers. A game where everything is balanced around 30 health and slowly climbing up to 10 mana, it's weird that a card would simply read 'yolo let's make this minion jacked.'
---
(Plays scumbag deck that takes forever to win with.....complains that the opponent doesn‚Äôt just concede to make him happy)
---
Are you serious haha?
---
Well he said his dust, what did he mean then?
---
agreed, enjoyed the heist but I'll think twice before buying the new adventure, that card is useless to me and I'd rather have the dust
---
Wait for nerfs before anything. They should be announced in the next week or so.
---
After that, look at what you have and decide which decks you want to build. You should preferably build around the valuable cards you already own. From there, try to identify the impractical cards you own; cards that might be powerful but which require a significant number of other valuable cards you don't already have to be good in a deck. Unless you think you have a reasonable chance of building the decks cards like that go into before they leave the meta or rotate out of Standard, those are the kinds of cards you should prioritize for disenchanting when you're in need of dust as they often end up never seeing any use in your collection otherwise.
---
The shaman wins because he has 420 armour.
---
I'm going to guess that if you like singleton decks, then you like varied game play. Baku decks tend to play out very similarly every game. So I suspect that you want Zephrys.
---
Even better when you put Toki in it.
---
To be fair, Sea Witch also had to draw 4 Giants to play 4 Giants... Not sure how many you could run in a given deck, but it definitely wasn't 12, so drawing 4 is actually big.
---
you have to keep doing it until you get Zephrys.  
---
And then you pretend that all the other wishes didn't happen.
---
my 7 iq brain doesnt get it. can someone please explain
---
I'd assume they mean that they see a golden legendary in their collection doing nothing, they want to get dust from it.
---
My fear is that any nerf that leaves boom an auto-include in control warrior wouldn't be enough to fix the problem. 9 mana doesn't fix it, changing any one of the hero powers doesn't fix it, and neither does reducing the armor.
---
I personally dislike the art for Siphon Soul....its a cool piece, but something about the colors used, the sort of peach and seafoam green, reminds me of what something looks like when it used to have richer colors but was left sitting in the sun for extended periods of time - like an actual TCG card, or a VHS cover. Something about the purple of the Warlock cards and the deep saturation of basically every other color in the game seems to exacerbate the effect and makes it look really out of place to me. I've never seen anyone else mention it though.
---
Not the same thing at all. That old naga sea witch deck would just run 6 kinds of giants or so and you'd be able to just fish for a specific card out of 30 (2 chances) within 11 draws (13 if you're going second) to do this, as you were almost guaranteed to have a few giants in hand by then. To summon 4 giants turn 5 as the new mage is a hiiiiiiiiigh roll to say the least.
---
I posted this same pic but the colors were actually in order and the mods removed it saying we cant post pack threads here.
---
The tri-class cards never used to show up in deck building outside of those three classes. Now they do and it lets you complete a deck, but you can‚Äôt play with it. It will say the deck is not valid.
---
Those last few chords before the main riff of Roundabout.
---
Gold is very equivalent to real money, those players could have bought real packs with their gold instead of adventure wings to get this awful card.
---
True
---
Mike already spoiled that CC is being moved to 4 on his stream.
---
If you really want a lot of packs you need to study up on, practice, and then play a lot of Arena. It is much better than buying packs but only if you get good at it.
---
I've used it in Reno Mage as another stall mechanic.  Its really only good when you can build a board of giants behind it, in that case it's essentially a board freeze.  Also pairs well with a Doomsayer turn.
---
Is it already time for another post trying to make mountain giant + conjuror‚Äôs calling out to be just as bad as naga sea witch + every giant in the game?
---
I like that solution because it also addresses potential issues that aren't a big problem *now* but could be in the future. Like, say, cheating out minions to then evolve.  
---
Mountain Giant has been a *strong* card in previous decks like Handlock but has never been this much of a problem because the drawbacks (not playing anything for four turns and getting smacked in the mouth) justified the reward (getting *ONE* 8/8 minon).  
---
The drawbacks are still the same, but the reward is getting two to four 8/8s!
---
This just shows how hard it is to be an indie company such a blizzard.
---
Staying on top of your quests, not taking long breaks away from the game, and managing your resources properly is the best way to get good decks without spending money.
---
Don't disenchant anything unless you need that dust immediately, but don't be afraid to disenchant a valuable card here and there if it isn't serving you any purpose over a card you could craft that would help you complete a good deck. Have a purpose for your gold by either saving it all between expansions and spending it on packs the day new expansions come out *or* spending it to grind Arena while focusing on getting good at it. And don't experiment by crafting cards for unproven decks during the unsolved meta that immediately follows each expansion and balance change. Instead, wait for the meta to take shape a bit and preferably build around the powerful cards you open in packs, prioritizing decks that require you to craft proven staples over niche cards.
---
You'll need some patience in the beginning though you can technically build one of the more budget-friendly top tier decks pretty quickly depending how fast you get through the beginner ranks.
---
It will probably be the exact same thing as before, but the meme non-disenchantable Golden Legendary will be slightly different.
---
Wow I didn't know that. Thank you for the serious heads up. I would imagine he would offer Harrison Jones though.
---
*sad Quest Rogue sound*
---
Probably yeah.
---
Ye i fucking hate handlock
---
Personally, I've had a bunch of fun playing these wings, but I do agree the gold price hurt a lot (especially as a F2P player).
---
Blizzard never offers dust for cards that are gifted, there's a precedence here (C'Thun is an example).  Blizzard isn't just going to give you a legendary's worth of dust, you're dreaming.
---
They have a set of apartment buildings right by their offices. I imagine he lives in a house though so there is probably a housing complex near by too.
---
10 giants. Sea, Clockwork, Mountain, Molten, and Arcane.
---
If it hasn't already I think it's safe now. They're kinda giving it the Lich King treatment.   
---
It's so useful that it makes its way into way too many decks, but it's not so swingy that its mulliganed-for/drawn win rate is staggering.
---
The one preview level of ONiK was free, the rest of the adventure was paid content. Dungeon run, Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan were free (and I don't think had any rewards besides cardbacks and promo quests).  Now they have changed from that model of free content without rewards to paid content with packs bundled in and token legendaries, which if Zayle is any indicator, are very bad.
---
My favorite was rogue smoke bomb. A lot of people considered it useless, but 20% dmg reduction and prevents spells from targeting in for a whole group. Whatup cheating raid mechanics.

Just remember that when your friend concedes against you too early it isnt counted!
---
I would love to see an unnerfed wild mode, but it's too broken in current modes
---
Wrapped Golem is so nuts in Arena. I tried him in Big Shaman but didnt really like it.
---
No.
---
Reno Priest in Wild would then be able to play a near perfect control game with an upwards of sixty damage combo for the control mirror. It would not be healthy for the format.
---
Dude, I don‚Äôt wanna be rude but this is like the 100th time someone posts a picture about this combo. Probably even more.
---
We have all seen it and know it :P
---
&gt; I trully dont see the point of sticking around in a game were you mathmatecly cant win
---
The point is in keeping your cancer deck out of the queue as long as possible so sane players aren't plagued by its existence
---
Combining it with molten giant, clockwork giant etc. And you made your opponent concede by turn 5
---
I believe a Turn 2 hogaak happens 60% of the time when the deck is played
---
"Too slow!"
---
That‚Äôs what you get for trying to ruin people‚Äôs day with pocket galaxy on 5 :P
---
Nah jokes aside, these things happen. Same with subject 9 into drawing 4 secrets back to back
---
*crab rave*
---
Not sure where you get that 40% figure from (Quest Druid is at 44%, which is still terrible, although 4% win rate difference is pretty big), but it's not exactly fair to call it the best Druid deck. Token Druid has a higher win rate, it just didn't have big enough sample size. It's still not a great deck (I would guess it's in the 47-49% range), but it doesn't suck that hard.
---
Not at all, 0 cost power was one of the most broken cards in the game
---
Ummmmm, every card with discover requires the same "constant updating" that Rexxar requires. 
---
The issue with Rexxar was not just that it required them to update it with new beasts, but it *also* required them to write the card text for every possible combination of beasts, and then *also* required them to translate that new card text into every language HS is in.
---
Updating Zayle to use a different deck list is comparatively much, much, much, much, much easier, since you're just  changing the lists of 30 cards it loads from, not printing 230+ new combinations of cards and translating them into 14+ languages.
---
Meanwhile this sub: "Nerf Quest Druid, it's so easy to complete!"
---
Fun fact: there once was a deck called "Machine Gun Warlock" that utilized a sick combo with Knife Juggler, Grim Patron, [[Deathspeaker]] and others.
---
[There are records from back then where you can see Defile going off more than 14 times. (2:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OedsKikPfTE) There must have been a time, where infinite-ish Defiles were possible. Actually, the possible infinite interaction with [[Dreadsteed]] back then was the main argument for nerfing Dreadsteed in the first place. So maybe for some time Defile had no limit or other limits.
---
However, I was not able to find any patch notes addressing that (but this is nothing special for Hearthstone ...).
---
Legend has it that DisguisedToast  found the Machine Gun Warlock. It became popular and problematic and then supposedly the limit was introduced. But, meh ... I dunno ...

I liked Echo Mage tho
---
It will be updated with next years rotation.
---
Gotta love turn 5 lol
---
I shudder remembering the days of Pirate Warrior back in Mean Streets of Gadgetzan. No meta can be worse than that
---
There are other meta snapshots for wild.
---
It's even better to think that making a giant cthulu like creature jump off a boat kills it.
---
Yeah, as I said to Batsheep, I was being sarcastic. It is frustrating to me that people who care about winning pretty much dictate not just the meta but also what cards get changed, which hurts every other player who plays the game.
---
While what people consider fun is subjective, a meme deck will (in all likelihood) never get a card nerfed.
---
Are there any data on handbuff 1 health paladin? I have been seeing a pretty large amount of them, but not even HSreplay seems to recognize it as an archetype.
---
I should have included a /s
---
jeez thanks, really answers my question
---
Bro we can see his opponent blew up
---
After you played the first wing, which was basically a scripted match, you got a deathknight legend. Mine was warlock, which worked really well because I was playing zoolock as my first deck and it fir in nicely. If you haven‚Äôt played it, I‚Äôd suggest just doing the first ‚Äúwing‚Äù, which is one nearly scripted match, and getting your free legend. All the deathknights were pretty strong and a big chunk and still really viable or even necessary in Wild competitive.
---
The ability to dust it wasn't. Nor was the thought that it would be updated every new expansion. But even the card to me was just a free bonus. I very much doubt one single person wasn't going to get the adventure until they found out about Zayle and then changed their mind.
---
So.... yes???
---
It's a me, Vulpera Scoundrel!
---
However with handlock, playing one or two big dudes was all they were doing really. They NEEDED that early board presence to do anything at all. If handlock didnt have any of their 4 big dudes out early they would just lose. If the opponent manages to clear one of the big dudes warlock would lose.  Not so with mage
---
Why spend time analyzing when all of that analysis is rendered pointless once nerfs hit.
---
Elaborate?
---
I cant believe a living breathing human typed this shit out, hurt my brain to read it and hurt my heart to acknowledge how lame you are
---
I find it takes almost none, just a lot of battery on my phone
---
I did actually I thought it would be another Whizbang type card so having him Golden was cool.  Why would you not believe that?  Crafting Whiz as a golden is a pretty strong sentiment around here.
---
The adventures I only play to unlock the shit then I never touch them except if there is a quest.
---
&gt;Make Wild more enticing and easy to get into for new players.
---
They don't want that though.
---
actually the game ended up crashing and i was forced to concede
---
Historically speaking, yes.
---
Think of a class that can summon multiple big minions early at the game. Which classes lore fits with that description? Well mage of course. At least that's what Blizzard has decided.
---
That same class can deal massive amount of damage to face and to all your minions WHILE also freezing your whole board and filling hand with spells for 0 mana.
---
Yes. Nerf him!
---
they should just make whizbang a basic card which you get for 20-50 games so new player can try out decks and learn the game
---
creating new "whizbang" cards like zayle is a bad idea in my opinion so they need to update multiple cards in the future or they become almost useless
---
I mean, do you sit through Antonidas fireball chains? Or do you just concede after the first is cast? Why sit through an extra minute of animations when the game is over.
---
That‚Äôs a weird reason to be banned.
---
Depends on the deck your playing. I would say anything more than 2 cards maindeck would be pushing it.
---
he gained that 420 armor in one turn
---
&gt;wanting something is greed
---
No it isn't greed is
---
&gt;intense and selfish desire for something
---
and wanting any more "rewards" for forking out money you earned isn't greed especially when its a large portion of the player base that's says there should have been more
---
it's because of it's mains. We try every fucking shit there is to make a Deck viable without Divine Spirit Combo. So, if we have a chance, we find it, since we mostly don't we are fucked.
---
I thought you get refunded while keeping the card. Just like with the hall of fame retirement
---
I agree that it is better than keeping things the same, but I wish they found a middle ground. I would prefer them trying extra arms costing 3 then 2 and luna costing 6.
---
I assume so, but the OP wasn't very clear. The way the game mechanically works however means that when you summon minions for your opponent, it counts as them summoning the minion. Which is a failure to communicate on Blizzard's side.
---
Seriously, needing Boom to 9 completely kills the flavor of the card. Flavor is way more important than balance in Hearthstone and I would much rather see Boom nerfed even harder in some other way to preserve the flavor of him being 7-cost. Extremely disappointed in this change, super uncreative all around.
---
I think a better comparison would be Eternal Servitude and [[Molten Reflection]]. Both 4 mana, copy a minion. One requires the minion to be dead, the other it has to be alive.
---
It's all Kibler's fault
---
Dr Boom had his PhD removed. Is now known as Mr Boom
---
Nope, I actually love the game and play it mostly daily since years, this is not a shitpost but my ¬´¬†humble opinion¬†¬ª. I‚Äôm criticizing the job they are doing right now with those nerfs. They could do a lot better and they don‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs it. Now if you actually believe they are doing their best, please, I‚Äôm listening.
---
Then Big Priest is balanced! Wait vargoth...
---
Didn't you address that with the 'one less card in your hand' bit?
---
It's hard to add in a shitty 12 Mana 1/1 battle cry: do stuff though, because you can't play a 12 Mana card from your hand. Inheritly it needs a Mana reduction mechanic and in that case, the big body is the reward for the Mana reduction.
---
Yeah basically, for example mountain giant would cost 5. The discount would kick in after so with 5 cards in hand would be reduced to 0. You could play naga and 6 different giants in a single turn.
---
and she is way betetr then boom. alot
---
Quick question. If I‚Äôm a Mac user, can I use the deck tracker/contribute to your data?
---
Ugh - classic Blizz nerfs - just jack up all the mana costs.
---
There were SO many good ideas on this forum about how to change these cards in more creative ways instead of "just jack up the cost again". Lame.

4/-/- | Choose a friendly minion. Summon a copy of it.  
---
Sure, but with the new taunt cards, they have access to even more stall.
---
Hell, they could even run giggling inventors if aggro/tempo decks start winning more. I use that card in my shaman decks and it's still great.
---
They nerfed it hard because it was both too strong, and many players HATED losing too it.
---
It was overnerfed because ultimately a card like this has to be a meme card to not feel terrible playing against it.
---
You can see its arm! [Take a look at the full art](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/File:Stoneclaw_Totem_full.png)!
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear? It‚Äôs cause seven ate nine.. oh wait
---
Yeah I'm really hoping aggro stands a chance now, but I doubt it tbh. They have so many things to stop aggro already. Boom was just the nail in the coffin.
---
Yes, but her power level was much higher than booms.  Not even in the same league really.

Dr. Boom going to 9 mana is huge. You can never play him and hero power in the same turn. Spending your entire *turn 9* doing nothing but gaining 7 armor without impacting the board means you will die against any reasonable deck. Dr. Boom + Shield Slam is now a 10 mana combo, absolute garbage. This is a big nerf.
---
Just want to add additional support of being willing to buff cards knowing a nerf could be a risk. 
---
Also, I am unsure of best long term answer for treating priest generally being weak class on rotation bc of their classic and basic card pool but a general archetype beyond inner fire is preferable to point where I would be fine with hall of faming inner fire and divine spirit and putting strong enablers of different archetype in as replacements
---
Everyone says the same every nerf round
---
Im just curious to hear their thoughts on why they aren‚Äôt HoFing ONE of the two cards (Divine Spirit OR Inner Fire). Both of them fit the fantasy of Priest on their own to me in a more balanced manner. I‚Äôll touch on both and what I feel the design space could be if the OTHER card is removed from the equation.
---
Divine Spirit: more cards similar to Nightscale Matriarch/Northshire Cleric that care about healing. You can have higher health total minions and more chances to take advantage of these effects without Inner Fire always being the better option. Blizzard would be able to print more of these cards safely.
---
Inner Fire: Imbuing your ally is a cornerstone of priest. I like that. This would give priests some burst potential without it always being a OTK tool and it would feel fair for a 1 mana card. Basically the max damage this can deal now is 14-16 from the Divine spirit ogre man.
---
so I guess fuck mage is their design philosophy?
---
Assign a flair my guy
---
It has been destroying legend since the set release, though. It had close to a 60% win rate at the huge tournament in Seoul. That's why it's nerfed. It is powerful, even if people don't realize it.
---
This destroys the current Control Mage archetype, and barely touches Control Warrior.
---
Mage didn't even have a consistent Tier 1 placement yet.  Hunter and Warrior will now return to their usual dominant positions.
---
Yeah, but you had three extra turn to kill him.
---
If you didn't succeed, you're done anyway.
---
Personally I would have loved to see brawl deleted from this game.
---
True. Very sad about it going back to 7. Could have been decent at 6. Oh well.
---
They should've nerfed the armor to 4 and the discover to random. Then they would've been on the same power level as the other two generally fair powers.
---
Tink is much worse than silence. It also targets *any big minion* and reduces it to a 5/5 or even a 1/1.
---
I bring up Galvadon because it is a bad deck that is made even worse by un-nerfed Tink. There are many fringe Tier 3 decks that players love, and shutting down such a broad swath of gameplay with a single auto-include card feels like a bad decision.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
edit: Prenerf Tink also makes for a strong aggro tool: he serves as a dual-purpose card to either remove an enemy taunt or highroll a token into a 5/5 threat.
---
The card is just not fun when it's powerful. So yes it'd be worse at 6, but they don't want to risk it still being good, because the card is inherently unfun to play against.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Do we get dust for nerfed cards? Sorry, new player, not sure how that works
---
I think the changes are uninspired and lazy but they kind of do the trick for the most part at this moment in time.
---
Conjuring should have been addressed like in the Kripp video and have the conjuring based on the mana cost when played.  This just makes sense.
---
Boom should have been rotated as is because in wild with the other heroes he is balanced.
---
Pocket Galaxy going back to 7 kills the card completely so that's never good.
---
The Barnes change does nothing
---
Extra arms is ok I guess.
---
Overall kinda lame tbh.
---
This comment always boggles my mind. There have been many many strong priest decks that didn't use DS/IF
---
Yeah, I mean - changing it to 6 was such an easy call to make. You can always change it again later to 7 if it's still too powerful. Sure - we would have made fun of it a little, but I'd rather see them try to make the card usable. We already know  no one will play it at 7
---
Than cards that summon for your opponent should state "your opponent summons" and it would resolve the overly long description issue. Blizzard has options, they are just terrible at wording cards properly.
---
or it's only going to matter in all the games boom was played on turn seven, and also all the games he wasn't played on turn 7 because he comes attached with a 2 mana hero power
---
rank 25 reddit scientists baffle me
---
except nerf does nothing, other decks are way more harmed by barnes nerf then bigpriest.
---
Bigpriest never even needed him, he could highroll you but aslo lsot you alot of games of getting him from shadow essence. not will 100% be cut. ANd bigpriest will be just as good and even more concistent now without him.
---
I mean, they will. They nerfed literally everything opposing hunters and murlocs
---
What are you asking them to do? Nerf every card that could possibly be put into a particular archetype of deck?
---
Yeah I edited, was doing it on my phone and had fucked up formatting.
---
I'm just saying you're trying to back track on what you're saying and it's just plain retarded lol.  You confirmed that you solely bought the adventure for the golden Zayle.  Now you're saying you got it for the packs as well.
---
TOB works.
---
Big priest is actually a terrible deck cause it loses so hard to secret mage. Yes a lot of people still play it, but if you just play secret mage it's a free win.
---
Team 5: "I will make it legal."
---
Sweet sweet dust.
---
Wow, how exciting
---
Because it's a shit fucking idea you moron. That's why. You're dogshit at game design.
---
https://ibb.co/KDD0B2F
---
Just gonna leave this here
---
Yeah, Blizz doesn't wants that so they are nerfing those 26th of August tough.
---
Yes you will be refunded.  So you effectively rent the cards with a 1600 dust deposit
---
C'thun and Marin are both still tagged as uncraftable, so probably not
---
Voidcaller + Sac Pack is very reliable.
---
And the issue isn't so much cheating a minion early; that is inherent to the game. The issue is the earlier you cheat him out, the earlier you can rez him in quantity.
---
Jaina at least gave you the instant impact of a water elemental on board and if you had elementals already, some lifesteal. Boom does not do that. It's 9 mana gain 7 armor
---
Eternal Servitude walks away unscathed again
---
Barnes was not played in some of the most sucessful lists
---
This does not change much as far as Wild goes.
---
I crafted it while drunk on the whims of the HS Discord.
---
So I'm just going to craft Zapyhr and call it a day. Would have crafted Hagitha, but Quest Shaman looks to be the hot new deck and I got it from one of my recent packs, so...
---
I get that yeah. As a priest main it still hurts tho...
---
That is indeed how it works, and Blizzard should reword their cards to reflect that. Simply making every card change from "summon X for your opponent" to "Your opponent summons X" would resolve so many issues.
---
Fuck off.
---
Calling it now, CW will be as strong as before with the only difference that Boom comes out 2 turns later. Yay? No, fuck no. The permanent rush to ALL mechs and the hero powers are the problem.
---
They could have at least made it 6, so it would compete with [[Shadow Essence]] for the turn.  Rez priest doesn't have a 5 mana card that I can think of.  This just delays them a turn.
---
Control Warrior remains the same...
---
Shield slam, Omega Devastator, Omega Assembly, Din'o'matic, Rush to mechs and hero power with 7 armor and DISCOVER a mech remains the same...
---
Now with mage balance will more than ever be WarriorStone

6/-/- | Summon a 5/5 copy of a random minion in your deck.  
---
Boom was OP for like 1 season. While that‚Äôs still longer than Priest let‚Äôs not over exaggerate. 
---
To be fair, Boom was competing with the true DK cards and those are absurd.
---
People already tried cutting Barnes before. This is 100% reason to cut it now.
---
The changes needed to be made because big priest comes and goes depending on the meta. If it's an aggro heavy meta then big priest drops down in the tier list but as soon as control comes back then big priest starts rising up the tier list again.
---
I liked the rewards, they felt rewarding, especially the golden pack was awesome.  I'm not a greedy piece of shit though, so I guess that's why I liked them.
---
But we already know that at 7 it's useless. Might as well delete it lol
---
&gt; this is not a shitpost but my ¬´ humble opinion ¬ª
---
It may not intended to be one, but it can certainly become one.
---
You have to dust it but you get full refund. And yeah t2 depending on the meta
---
Is not a bad craft, probably is the best card priest will have for the next 1 and half years, I assume it is a safe craft if you play any priest deck, at all
---
"Fuck Mage" - is the design philosophy they have been following for awhile now. Mage rarely ends up with a  true T1 deck and gets to keep it. 
---
Warrior got to keep 90% of it's toy and just got two turns slower and I doubt that will stop a deck that gets to run a better version of Reno at 10 mana...
---
Yea, this is way off base. A lot of the buffed cards have been seeing play.
---
I'm absolutely happy to see them more comfortable with buffing cards and nerfing them when necessary. Luna's was a nearly instant game win at 5 Mana and Priest used Extra Arms to run through the entire tournament in Seoul and is huge at high legend.
---
I really don't know what you guys actually want the dev team to do about Big Priest. It kinda seems like you would prefer that Barnes and any card with the word "resurrect" on it be deleted from the game.
---
I would like a response for this question as well. 
---
I strongly believe it would have been enough at 6 mana. Because other than a Doomsayer/Nova on 5, Mage really doesn't have anything to slow down the opponent. 
---
I've played about 50 games with Mage and gotta say when you can't cast turn 5 Pocket Galaxy, you almost never have another window to cast it.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs the curve more specifically. [[Velen‚Äôs Chosen]] is still a great, balanced card.
---
Id say odd rogue, even shaman, quest mage. Secret mage is decent too and odd paladin will probably be the safest deck to make in all of wild
---
I thought it was 50
---
Stitchers supplier. Battlecry and deathrattle: put 3 cards in the graveyard from your deck.
---
It costs 1.
---
It's actually modern, not standard, though the 1 drop is from standard. Just the rest of the deck isn't.
---
Extra arms? Why? Sorry I play wild only where this card sees absolutely no play so what's wrong with it?

---
3/-/- | Give a minion +2/+4 and Spell Damage +1.  
---
If you think about it, that can potentially make it even better.
---
You can keep early game cards and since it's 9 mana, you have plenty of time to thin your deck and draw him.
---
CW won't change that much, it'll be as strong as before. Meanwhile we fuck other decks that did somewhat good against them.
---
Do the token spell more arms costs 3 too or 2. It would be cool if it would costs 1 mana to have a total manacosts for 4 mana like thr pre nerf :)
---
Thing is, against midrange do you want to spend your whole turn 9 gaining 7 armor? With boom at 7 you could turn 8 Boom + shieldslam for example.
---
&gt;entertainment value
---
I fuckin chuckled at this, the game is getting stale to a point there's almost no entertainment value
---
&gt;plus card backs
---
They could literally take those out today and it wouldn't affect much, also you don't pay shit for cardbacks ao why are you trying to use them in your comparison?
---
Do they? Ok...

---
I was thinking about [[Extra Arms]] the other day and wondered if making the [[More Arms!]] token be a 1 mana +1/+1 instead of the 2/2 would have been a nerf or not. Thoughts anyone?
---
Boom does not hold a candle to what the Death Knights were capable of.
---
Yes , you can read
---
I hope so too :(
---
&gt;Remember everyone thought the new reno was bad, or that quest paladin was the worst?
---
When the buffs were announced people weren't even looking at Luna's or Extra Arms. It was "Why would they buff Crystology, at 1 is so incredibly busted" "It instantly becomes the best card in the game"
---
By doing so, they essentially acknowledged this card is a mistake and nerfed it back to oblivion.
---
Or was just trying to get the free pack without putting the work into making a deck
---
Yeah it felt like outta left field to me. Sure the spell is strong but compared to all the good stuffs warrior has it is laughable.
---
Nah I think the strongest part of boom was the fact that he can charge his mechs to clear your board. 9 mana boom is a good hit.
---
If this guy actually eats his shoe then I‚Äôm going to buttchug powdered glass and drip liquid feces and hot sauce into my gaping pp.
---
Definitely :)
---
I didn't say that it was going to make Control Warrior bad or anything, but it does make them spend a turn in the mid-late game doing nothing. Yes if they draw the perfect curve then it won't matter, but you can say that about everything.

&gt; We know it sucks at 7 and is broken at 5.
---
So try 6.......?
---
&gt;this is how blizzard handles balance
---
Its how they started handling balance for hs, before whispers of the old gods there was no rotation
---
They just nerfed barnes tho, a wild card
---
Yeah all i see this change is that warrior decks play more safe for 1-2 extra turns which isnt saying much because they still have an unfair amount of removal/value it isnt even funny.
---
I hate the boom -he should have been Hofed-now wild warrior is even more dogshit. Boom could barely compete with Rexxar, Jaina, Guldan etc and now they are making him so much worse.
---
Someone is going to use this post as a straw man to explain that tracking is bad because you lose cards, but it's still an excellent card, and even in Highlander Hunter there is hardly a reason to not run it unless you are often having matchups that go to fatigue.
---
True. Maybe a cool card seeing some play as overpowered is better than a cool card seeing no play at all
---
Makes sense. It must be hard trying to print cards with really cool abilities only to be oppressive in the meta
---
You're getting downvoted because you're pointing out the truth that there are so many counterplays to this. And not to mention the fact that doing nothing to the board turns prior means you generally get run over by aggro. This is bullshit. Aggro is going to stomp this deck even harder and now control warrior has even more viability against it. They just nerfed it because people were bitching about how "bad" it feels to lose against when they're just whiny motherfuckers
---
Thank you!
---
Did not play much since uldum but will try out few decks now espacially with the nerves coming in
---
And the problem with big priest wasn't really barnes. It was the fact that (1) if you resurrect a 1/1 it should come back as a 1/1 OR (2) resurrect and eternal servitude need to change. Shows that these devs are really out of touch and/or are just big priest mains
---
As a new player who's spent 12k dust crafting a mage deck around lunas. 
---
Can I expect any refund on the dust to create lunas, or am I just F'd?
---
something for you to consider: baku and genn get very boring very fast. yes they are powerful, but the decks do the same thing every game and the decklists are unchanging. if your only concern is laddering, then baku is the better craft, however if you are also looking to have fun then zephrys all the way. also, if you don‚Äôt have the other reno cards then zephrys becomes less good. idk what your collection is like, but i would craft kazakus before zephrys for example.
---
I ran this and every cards that got aggressive stat buffs from having totems or mechs or elementals. I got my pack on the first try and never got to refine the list. Hungry crab is an OP one drop for a 3/4 that kills anything as is that minion that becomes a 3/2 if you have a mech. The Murlocs that give stat buffs are awesome. Shaman is so aggressive in this brawl it‚Äôs nuts.. [[Dranei Totemcarver]] and Thing from Below just come down so strong the game shouldn‚Äôt go past 6 turns if you draw right.

Way to make a claim and not support it with any evidence or logic

Another thing: Other card games let you buy entire prebuilt decks for either in game currency or real money. Why blizzard hasn‚Äôt implemented this baffles me to this day. The rotating decks that blizzard makes every set release should be purchasable. Even if they‚Äôre bad you can always substitute cards to make prebuilt decks better.
---
lmao, you don't nerf something because it is top teir. You nerf it because it should never have been printed, people have hated it since standard, and there in no play around in HS since there is no exile mechanic. It's just a dumb high roll deck that relies on cheating out mana (big minions) repeatedly before you even get to the turn where you could have ever played it. It was and is terrible design

---
I could ask that question in the newbie thread as well, but given the opportunity, I'll ask here, please bear with me and remind me again: Does one get the full dust refunds for those nerfed cards only by dusting them, or does one get the dust anyway while keeping the cards?
---
How come this isn't mentioned at all in your blog post that the OP linked to, for players who aren't familiar with this? I feel like this should warrant some emphasis.
---
it's not about winrates, it's about single plays that result in highly different games for either player IE how the games against warrior/mage/priest operate before and after they play Boom/Luna's/Barnes. Those cards being played on curve become a huge shift in that player's favor, even if that player would be losing against something else anyway
---
Unity
---
Pocket Galaxy never deserved to see play in the first place. Just an unfun card that you can't play around.
---
As both a midrange and a warrior player, this is extremely true.  Turn 9 is going to be a mug.  Best case scenario is Boom, then shield slam a target.
---
No he wont. Guldan is by far the strongest DK in wild and even he isnt seeing play right now. Neither is Jaina or Rexxar.
---
The Extra Arms revert is so unwarranted, I'm so incredibly disappointed by these nerfs. This was roughly the third time in Hearthstone history that Priest has had an actual tier 1 deck and they decide to destroy one of the tools that actually made it viable. Combo Priest was so easily defeated by non-singleton Hunter and Mage, Freezing Trap, Pressure Plate, Deadly Shot, Polymorph, Hex. All these things easily countered combo Priest, but they decided Singleton decks were more important.
---

---
shut the fuck up and play your damn cards.
---
I know people are disappointed because the nerds are basic.  But it will actually significantly change the meta. Aggro now has more of a chance and thus people will play different decks to counter it and so on and so forth.

Yeah, this \[Totemic Surge\] card plus \[Splitting Axe\] are the cards that really shined for me from Rank 10 to about Rank 3. Then I started running into so many flak mages that I tech'd  \[Eater of Secrets\] x2 and started devouring all the mages I was running into.
---
If you have the card. You have 2 weeks to dust it for the same value as you crafted it. After the nerfs have gone live ofc
---
Do me Do me!
---
Only one I dislike is the Boom change. He needed to be needed but they ruined the flavour and he still is the control king in the late game so they should of just changed him to the mechs in your hand and deck have rush.
---
I mean, if you don't want to win, just play the Generous Mummy
---
It shouldn't be a twinspell at the very least
---
It can't lowroll since a long time before vargoth, where people started experimenting by cutting Barnes and the winrate barely changed. In any case, the Wingate against slower decks was increased without reading Barnes lategame. He was used mainly as a hail Mary to win against aggro matchups (and of course for that 1 every 10 games when you just win turn 4 whatever you are facing)
---
Now at least it won't have that instawin every 10 games due to Barnes into ysarg into ysarg, that was the problem. Ressing stuff is not a problem, many other decks do so and many other decks can interact with it. The bullshit argument that big priest pushes control decks away from the meta (except jade) is now over since renolock and renomage are also pretty decent lately in wild, so fortunately people will stop repeating that too. And jade can be pushed out easily by slotting a skulking gheist in your deck, and you will win 100% in that matchup.
---
Big priest wasn't the problem many people claimed it to be. I agreed with the feel bad moment of the turn 3/4 highroll and now it's deleted, so hey, that's good. Big priest was like tier 3 before the nerfs anyway, so this will probably not do much appart from helping people stop hating the wild format and trying it, but I think that's a lot. Less big priest in ladder is good news for the majority.
---
It‚Äôs the üÖ±Ô∏èancient one you fool!
---
No. You get the full cost back if you dust them.
---
Maybe they're not speaking about it because there is a special subreddit for Wild?
---
Hey thanks man. Good luck on the ladder
---
Spell Hunter and Renounce Darkness decks use him to cheat out Y'Shaarj. Big Rogue uses him. I've seen him in versions of Malygos Shaman. I might try him in Violet Teacher Token Druid, now that he won't interfere with Oaken Summons anymore.   
---
There are also a ton of pointless cards in Hearthstone.
---
The basic set is supossed to be simple to understand.
---
This isn't.
---
Can I encourage you to further experiment by releasing good two drops again?
---
i think everyone thought crystology would be the top candidate for a buff revert, not these two.
---
Stop crying about Warrior for fucks sake! Even now it's only a T2 deck at legend.
---
I saw someone comment that it may be less likely that Boom will be kept in the mulligan since having him on curve at 7 is far more important than having him on curve at 9.
---
yeah these nerfs are kind of disappointing. this is no relevant warrior nerf. sure, he has to wait 2 turns longer to play boom and cant boom+hero power in the same turn, but thats only a small part of the problem. mage will do, what it did before luna got popular. the giant+CC combo will still be oppressive. barnes doesnt really matter (because wild doesnt matter in blizzards eyes).
---
and why the hell did they nerf priest? it just became strong and they instantly nerf it, while they usually dont nerf the dominating decks at all or only after more than a year of dominance. 
---
worst balance changes in a long long time lol
---
Why not ask the guy what he meant or why he thinks that way? Demanding facts and logic for someone‚Äôs opinion is such an annoying way to communicate.
---
No, you had to buy all 5 wings of Heist to get it.
---
Eh, Reddit is fickle. Definitely feels like gatekeeping to me. "You associate this generic phrase with a *newer* game than the game I play? Blasphemy!"
---
I appreciate the significance of CS:GO in the esports community. As a Siege fan, I actually have a great amount of respect for the work that community did in pioneering the field of esports and making it more publicly accessible. It's amazing that it still has such a strong competitive scene years later; they laid the groundwork for a successful competitive model.
---
But hey, you know, I didn't mention the right game at the right time. It happens.
---
That's like saying "Just don't play with the new expansion for the first month, maybe two months". Sure, it's theoretically the best way to maximize your dust efficiency, but you're also missing out on a month of fun.
---
200
---
&gt;h yes it is, go look it up. Quest Mage and Secret Mage are by far the most played variants of Mage in Wild.
---
....do you speak english? That could be true, that has nothing to do with the fact that what you said is wrong. Those decks play nothing like old freeze mage.   
---
Nah, you decided to throw off into a tangent because you're salty, and starved for social contact. I'm just going to block you.
---
There‚Äôs no guarantee it wouldn‚Äôt still be oppressive at 6
---
That‚Äôs not how math works...
---
Except for it's not?  Remember the buff went through before Uldum came out and where was Priest during that period?  In the dumpster as usual.  
---
What makes the new deck strong is that they added a lot of high value neutrals which complement Priest.  Injured Tol'var, aka 2 mana Injured Blademaster that also protects your northshire / lightwarden, and  Neferset Ritualist, aka extra copy of Circle of Healing that leaves a 2/3 on board are what pushed Priest from the garbage heap to tier 1.
---
What else do you suggest he does? Not play the game for the first month of every expansion?
---
It's hilarious, you literally can't play big minions in this brawl because they'll just become crab food. 1 mana, destroy a minion, get a 3/4 is preeeettttty good.
---
This change is proof that the current team only has the resource or motivation to do the absolute bare minimum. This nerf is so out of touch and only weakens barnes in non priest decks. 
---
The last expansions solo content and now these nerfs that were implemented last minute are truly telling of what we can expect in the future. I wonder what's going on behind the scenes to cause this.
---
Then what's with the praise of having free DK behind the first wing if it's effectively the same (or technically worse) as getting a free legendary quest/other card directly being added to collection upon login?
---
Question, are there gonna be post-release changes to cards to better fit class identities (like the Rogue plague was changed shortly before release), or are any identity breaks that are out there (like EVIL totem being a complete break of Shamans weakness of card generation) just gonna stick around?
---
Yeah, I rather have the safe than sorry approach.

Going to go out on a limb here and say that his response is basically a confirmation on this event. When asked about another round of buffs in the recent livestream, he did he said that they want to try different things each time. Mike also generally has a very unique and nuanced way of how he teases upcoming stuff.
---
For such a big brain he can't spell for shit.
---
In a highlander deck, how is it possibly to quantify whether card A is better than card B? I feel as if there are so many variables that even with data of drawn win rates and whatnot, it mostly boils down to chance.
---
Unless it‚Äôs Reno mage who almost always run Geist
---
Not in a single meta deck, no they dont. Secret mage and quest mage both cap their curve at 6 mana (ignoring Giants). Hunter doesnt have a single tier 1 or 2 deck, and Snip Snap Warlock doesnt run enough demons to make Guldan worth running.
---
Are you saying that they shouldn't have moved Molten Giant to the HoF?
---
Surely he knew the disenchant rate beforehand. You can't say the system punished him when his mistake should have been abundantly clear before he made the investment. He punished himself by being so reckless.
---
What realistic change could Blizzard possibly make to the disenchant rates that would prevent this? A player's poor judgement isn't a good justification for a dust overhaul.
---
I thought 8/8 was a date, and it confused me, is the tweet a joke about making his stats 8/8?  If so, how's that news?
---
Your must-craft deck will be murlocs. I know you are f2p, but a singular strong murloc deck can beat 6+ out of the 9 classes, i found.
---
Simply reverting the Luna and Extra Arms buff is pretty bad and lazy in my opinion. Both cards are now being drawn back into unplayable state instead being sensibly tuned. Even HOFing them would have been a better solution.
---
The other nerfs are alright but still as a Lunas fan i am really unsatisfied with this balance patch.
---
that's not what happens. People rope AFTER they played all the cards and are just toxic kids.
---
So I come back to HS after a few months of not playing, see mage is in a good spot, dust a couple of decks I don‚Äôt wanna play (bomb/control warrior) and one that is trash (rogue) to craft mage cards to play control and highlander, get to play for a week and it‚Äôs nerfed into the ground and warrior barely gets touched?! Surely rotating Boom out would be the best thing for standard. Highlander mage is strong yes,  but did pocket need killing?! Control warrior is still stronger then it! Just don‚Äôt understand why warrior was left so unnerfed.
---
Yes
---
One more mana on a twinspell massive. That‚Äôs essentially 4 more mana a game they use of it, and that one turn later can be the difference
---
Dude. Youre on to something
---
The better big priest builds haven't hs l ran barnes in a while anyways right? This nerf is purely to appease the circle jerk.
---
Probably gets off to that or some freaky shit. Better to just ignore them and move on.
---
The Reno decks run guldan and jaina
---
I have a gold Dr. Boom from a pre-order. Will I get the full 3200 dust from this nerf?
---
People just like complaining. The complaints of the day are apparently the cards deserved to be nerfed but "not that way."
---
Yeah, it will lower the winrate of dr boom a little bit, but it won't fix whats frustrating about playing against it.
---
Decks played Luna's when it was 7.  Antonidas Exodia Mages etc.  They just weren't good decks.  Which is fine, not all cards should be good, especially one that's as polarizing as Luna's.
---
Oops I think he misspelled "Lel what a scrub, my only validation and self worth comes from picking on people I beat in a simulated game because my childhood sucked"
---
Yeah and also there‚Äôs sacrificial pact
---
I wish
---
Please, Blizzard. This is not a twinspell, so you can nerf Extra Arms to 3 mana while keeping More Arms at 2 mana
---
Yes, reno mage is still viable, no, you can probably dust Luna's without looking back once the nerfs hit. At 7 mana, it's simply too awful; there's no early highrolls, it's a massive tempo loss and the reward is mediocre. You'll always draw more big minions before playing it, since you can't afford to keep it in your opening hand and even if you get it on curve it's still later. Then, even if you get it off on 7, the reward you get for the huge investment of 7 mana to do nothing and filling your deck with big minions diminishes significantly, since at that point you could start playing those big minions regularly anyway.
---
Tl;dr It was trash before at 7 mana, and the reason why hasn't changed.
---
I thought it was mostly harmless ribbing, not actual negative feelings
---
It does have tons of counterplay though, all you really need is some AoE though it could become a little harder if they use Coldlight Seer or something to give them a little more health but overall if you aren‚Äôt prepared for it you will get steam rolled
---
Wow, you use regular warlock instead of mecha-jaraxxus? P2W scum.
---
Ew, 400 dust really? I'm better off dusting a golden one to make the space and maximize
---
I am really sorry but thats not what happens to me at all. Sure i occasionally get someone who is half afk and forgets to end turn but who the f cares its like 1 in 40 games
---
bruh
---
That‚Äôs not what OP is saying tho, OP is saying that people shouldn‚Äôt rope cause these decks don‚Äôt require that much thinking
---
## bruh üò§üî•üî•üíØüíØ
---
Which is why killing him on 4 is almost always incorrect.  He‚Äôs a serious problem on turn 6 when they shadow essence.   If you kill him on 5 now he has to choose to either shadow essence or Rez Vargoth off curve.
---
they said no drawback i was explaining the drawback
---
The list from WiReR? I really like that list.
---
A lot of people have a hard time seeing that control warrior is going to be removed from their control throne. I would love to see control shaman come up. I'm not sure how it would look like.
---
Ugh I was hoping LPG would dodge a nerf. I've had it since Boomsday launched and was hoping to use it after it got buffed but didnt have the dust until now. Also, yeah now boom is slightly weaker to aggro but that doesn't really solve too much about it.
---
Yeah I got into cs with source and remember excitedly getting csgo when it first dropped. Now I basically only play siege. Love em all but siege feels like a good progression of the bomb defusal gameplay.
---
Hey Porginus, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
9 to 7 does almost nothing. Warrior games routinely go 30 + turns, whether or not they play a card on 9 or 7 matters not. Drawing it makes a difference , but that is nothing new.
---
It might lead to like a 1-2% win rate decrease.
---
Warrior-killer decks will still kill them, no better no worse. Things that get rolled by Warrior still will get rolled, no more no less.
---
But, more important than any of that...
---
Even if we factor in some very small percentage points lost to CW win rates, it‚Äôs immediately negated by the Mage nerfs, which are undeniably more impactful.
---
Priest and Mage nerfs are indirectly going to actually boost Warrior win rates.
---
All said and done, today vs tomorrow, Warriors are likely to see winrates go up, if anything.
---
I just wish Zayle decks came with maybe one special ‚ÄúZayle Token‚Äù or some novelty aspect, paired with the normal super average decks to add even a bit of novelty. Particularly with Whizbang existing it just feels pointless, and will be considerably more pointless if not updated and rotated.
---
The üÖ±Ô∏èANCIENT ONE
---
Exactly
---
you're right I'm an idiot
---
You realize that if you can coin boom on eight now, then you could have coined boom on 6 before? Either way it's two turns later. Also, half the games the warrior won't have coin, so yes it will be turn 9 before boom can be played in many scenarios.
---
Statistically, there were times where boom was coined out on 6 and times where boom was played on 7. There were also times that boom was played on 9 or 10 and gained value from the hero power immediately. Those are no longer realistic options for warrior and it will have a detrimental effect on warrior.
---
Vargoth is generally pretty bad against aggro. Barnes nerf gives a whole turn for aggressive decks to beat it. That is monumentally huge.
---
Yes, he's not really good but extremely fun to play with. Only dust him if you are desperate for dust
---
Yeah they got massive data indicating that Priest needed a nerf after one week with a good deck. First time in 2 years Priest has a good deck and it's removed in a week.
---
Meanwhile all other classes have each had more oppresskve decks for longer in the last 3 years. Every single class.
---
And neither Renolock or Reno Mage is top tier. Shit they're not even the best decks for those classes. Both classes have 2 decks that are much stronger than their Reno variant.
---
They'll still draw it by turn 9. There's only a very specific few scenarios where a boom on 7 actually mattered; against aggro, while the game is close, the warrior is at a manageable (not high, not low) life total, and the warrior has enough mechs in hand.
---
One thing I feel positive about is the control warrior mirros are more fair now because both players have 2 extra turns to draw Boom rather than one playing him on turn 7 while his opponent still prays for topdecking him.
---
&gt;control shaman
---
I think Shaman is the best contender to have a good control deck.
---
Maybe it's a bit easier to experiment with a card game than rts?
---
Yea. It's funny, because Magez had a poor win rate in Seoul - but when they drew Luna's, of course, they did well. Priest was a lot more consistent.
---
But yea - the power level of both a class and a strategy can't hinge entirely on one card, because it makes the games swingy as hell depending on when that card is drawn. That's the problem with Hero cards, as well as the absolutely game-defining legendaries.
---
Take a card like Luna's, which wins you the game when drawn, to something like Tess Greymane. Both are single copies, but Thief Rogue's strategy isn't ENTIRELY reliant on Greymane - she's just a really, really good payoff. Having multiple weaker payoff cards is a lot less tilting than a single massive payoff.
---
Regular heroes are basic. Just search for "basic" while browsing the heroes pages in your card collections. Works the same with "epic" for (almost) all the other heroes. However, if you'd manage [to glitch out a golden basic hero card this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ap9rvr/seems_like_druid_will_still_have_hero_cards_after/), the card would look golden with a dragon border treatment just like a legendary, but it still is basic, also missing the gem.
---
Yeah, Tracking basically won the game here. Imagine the cards are on top of the deck from left to right. Tracking burned two cards on top of Brann so that OP can play it on turn 7 as opposed to turn 9. Considering he's ahead on the board, that should pretty much end the game right there. Getting value from Subject 9 or ZJ in a hunter vs hunter match up is not nearly as important as keeping ahead on tempo.
---
Gimme dat sweet dust! Time to make some meme decks!
---
Absolutely! I didn't think you were correcting me, your statement was helpful and better clarified and refined the point I was trying to make. Thank you!
---
You got downvoted a bit, but this was basically firebat's stance on the card.
---
To paraphrase, his opinion was that a card like pocket galaxy goes against most design philosophies blizzard have ever said, and having a 5 mana "do nothing" card be the highest mull winrate in a deck is also saying something. Once the card gets played, the opposing player feels like that are helpless with the huge swing turns in the following turns.
---
Mom's spaghetti
---
even though im fairly indifferent about nerfing barnes 1 mana, barnes never was the problem. its almost a meme saying that barnes is the problem with big priest.. who will carry on as normal.
---
ah that‚Äôs fair. Though since their still very much viable decks, you need the dks for those control decks
---
hEy LoOk I hAvE sO mAnY fRiEnDs

Okus is my new religion
---
It's like, Blizzard is always behind the curve with their _changes that should have happened_ of two fucking years or more. On every product.
---
- They should have added Trasmog in TBC? They Added it in Cata.
---
- They should have added races Reskin along side the new races when they did Cata or Pandaria? Nope, they added them in Warlords of Draenor.
---
- Wanna make some good fucking Troll Content in Cataclysm? Nah, let's just reskin the old dungeons. Let's make the REAL Troll content, only in Battle for Azeroth, when at that point barely anyone remains to play the game
---
- It took them like 4 years for them to add Deck codes implementations
---
- It took them 2 years to Nerf Barnes
---
- It took them 1 full year to nerf Patches
---
- It took them the fucking Witchwood expansion for them to make the Concede Button Red
---
Now, that Hearthstone views are at an all time low? NOW, they're nerfing Barnes.
---
Like, for fuck's sake. Blizzard is so late, that even Peter Parker getting to dates on time in the trilogy, would pale in comparison.
---
Huh. TIL

Feelsbadman I crafted all of those cards by dusting half my collection

She's nervous, but on the surface she looks calm and ready
---
Not if you want to play Barnes, bring him back, play him again and summon the üÖ±Ô∏èANCIENT ONE. That's 2 more mana.
---
Yeah, they'll never revert Dr.Boom to 7 mana when he's roated to wild so that warrior can remain a tier 3 class in wild...

Pure bandaid fixes that do nothing to address the underlying problems associated with combo priest, control warrior and mana cost manipulation. 
---
Please do something to this game other then add cards and nerf mana costs.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you the number of games I have forced a warrior to wait 3+ turns for boom because he had to address board or die
---
Does it feel better to lose against YOUR WISH IS MY SUGGESTION or SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST ? Not rly. I think these mechanics are really fair, because they have serious counterplay. Magnetic and the wraps are hard fcked by silence.
---
There are a lot more bs things in the game
---
while it would be the perfect card it would be a bit broken, no?
---
It's definitely a strong card and has been since before CC. Not a problem card, but definitely a staple of handlock and decks like it for years. I don't think it's a problem in the sense that it needs a nerf. But I definitely think it's about time it's HOFed, and imo after Giant is HOFed, 3 mana CC wouldn't have been a problem. That's mainly what I was getting at. The best solution to the CC and giant issue was not to nerf CC, just HOF giant early and CC is a fine card again....or better yet change how mana cheated minions interact with the board (i.e. they are considered to be the mana cost they were played for--so a turn 4 giant is considered a 4 mana minion for CC plays). But considering the amount of work the latter solution requires, I figured the former was good enough for now.
---
C.
---
No, one of main counter of Spellstone Hunter (+ Rexxar) IS Odd Warrior.
---
Rexxar was indeed Hunter's late game plan, but Odd Warrior could still score a win by dumping their hand. It's not like DK Rexxar auto wins from Dr.Boom
---
Source:
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-116/ 
---
Odd Warrior's counter was Deathrattle Hunter, Taunt Warrior and of course Mecha'thun decks.
---
There was an assassinate on a body. It was 5 mana 3/4 that needed to combo and was still considered really good. This is cheaper, bigger, and has more synergies.
---
I dont think it's enough to make warrior not good. But let's see what happens. Boom at 9 stops the warrior from doing much about anything in a timely matter. Midrange can definitely pressure them away from it now that they have a minimum of two extra turns.  
---
    
---
Aggro will still have a tough time but that's how Control vs Aggro works.
---
What the hell are those middle minions
---
I can't think of any other class with infinite value.
---
Shaman has Hagatha, but that runs out when you run out of minions. It has the quest + battlecries combo which COULD be infinite with the right cards, but that deck has seemed underwhelming early at best.
---
Paladin has the tools for a control deck, but not the value.
---
Priest may have the tools for a control deck, but it seems too slow and not rewarding over playing Warrior.
---
Hunter doesn't have any way of being a control deck currently.
---
Rogue doesn't have any way of being a control deck. It has insane value, but the lack of AoE and good healing makes it impossible. If Vanish was still in standard Quest Rogue could potentially be a much better deck.
---
Warlock doesn't have the tools to support a control deck currently and doesn't have infinite value I can think of.
---
Mage has Big Spell Mage and Highlander I suppose, but it doesn't have infinite value either.
---
Druid lacks solid AoE and doesn't have good enough infinite value without a highlander deck.
---
Aggro Warrior you say? Sounds like a blast
---
No
---
im happy about that. he's really not that problematic. even a 2 mana nerf is unnecessary i think. it's the 1 mana get 3 mechs card, that usually gives you the 4 mana deal 10 damage card,  that i see as problematic. anyhow who cares.
---
And faceless.
---
you are forgetting that warrior has an absurd amount of removal, he can wipe your board on 8 and just tank the dmg of whatever card you played on 9 when he plays boom. I do agree that this nerf will help hard agro decks but for everyone else it barely changes anything, once boom is played you lose.
---
Already down to 50k games in the second meta report of the expansion?  That is really low.
---
&gt;Quest Druid... The potential of quest decks is there if Mage, Warrior, and Priest get hit with nerfs.
---
Well, we'll see!  Druid has been so boring since the nerfs to the ramp cards.
---
Maybe they'll announce it afterwards in order to "save the best for last".
---
Thank Christ.
---
Here you go. Different lists exists. This is mine:
---
AAECAbSKAwpf/gG0A5ME2QSu0gLk+wL1/AL4oQP0ogMKQFbTA8QGv/ICqaIDr6IDyKID76ID2akDAA==
---
I don't feel like the Dr Boom change is enough. This mana cost change is just a brute force way to reduce its win rate, it doesn't touch the inherent design flaw of the whole warrior mech package just being so insane because of this single card connecting the rest. Even though people keep saying "he is ok in wild" as an argument to why they should just rotate him, I feel like there is a lot of things that should be changed about this card to fundamentaly fix it.
---
I believe in that case returning it to meme card status that never sees competitive play again was the goal. And rightly so. A card like that which lets  you have ridiculous blowouts with zero counter play is fine when it's bad and only played for meme value, much like Morgu Cultist or mimirom's head. But it has no place in competitive play, because it creates situations like happened in the finals of the Master's Tour where games were decided purely on the basis of who had LPG on 5

---
Big priest is overpowered lol
---
^(This is called)
---
####GOOD FUCKING RIDDANCE
---
And yet it still pushes out most control decks. It's a T2 deck because a lot of its counters are popular.
---
First time I played this it cleared the board, casted swarm of locusts and then storm bringer. I think I wasted all my luck because everything else has been worse off for me.
---
What the hell is even that?!?!
---
No, I don't think dragon priest was ever t1 until Duskbreaker came out. I think it was a fairly strong t2 deck IIRC, thanks to Dr. Op. Still, KnC spiteful priest was nuts in its prime.
---
How was it playing a dog fucker
---
So I see what you are saying. And I personally love the priest aggro deck. But just because last meta they were bad, doesn't justify leaving a potential problem escalate to be even greater.  This slow mentality that Blizzard has for addressing problems is partially why they took so long to change conjurers and Dr.7 in the first place, despite several months of objective data showcasing the problem.    Im not saying to nerf things to absolute unplayability which is another terrible habit Blizzard has, but if they decide to address something more quickly in the future instead of waiting for several months, I believe this could help the game in the long run. 
---
Again, I personally love the aggro priest. And the data for aggro priest comparatively to mage and warrior is much smaller, so one could argue this is potentially too hasty.  However, the data we do presently have suggests once these nerfs go live and if priest was untouched, Priest would ironically enough be even more oppressive than it currently is, and it currently is incredibly dominant according to stats.  No, I dont want priest or any class to be unplayable. But I also dont want a class to be overly oppressive either. There will always be a best deck, but they gotta be careful by how much of a margin.  Putting my subjective disappointment aside ( I hit legend with aggro priest and love it) objectively speaking it makes sense, and I hope Blizzard is a little quicker to address potential issues instead of waiting as long as they did with Dr.7 and mage. Just offering perspective
---
Anybody know if they give a refund for Barnes if you got him from the adventure, and didn‚Äôt craft him?
---
The text is grammatically inconsistent. ‚Äúboth‚Äù refers to two, but Loti combines four options. You‚Äôd never say ‚Äúyou four had better both come with me‚Äù...
---
Just cast plot twist from puzzlebox duh
---
No u
---
It MIGHT have made it back to tier 2 this expansion.  It's absolutely not overpowered.
---
how did it took 24 days to reply? edit nevermind i noticed at your profile that you probably were on some break.
---
Darn, people actually trying to win!
---
I know this is a shitpost but I do wonder, would Extra Arms be as broken if More Arms costed 2? So it's 5 mana for 4/4 in stats rather than 6 mana?
---
It should become a 4/4
---
r/inclusiveor
---
SlimyRemiHS2#2158 \[EU\] Quest trade, you go first. Can show mine if wished for :) \[Done\]
---
Big Priest is already a tier 3 deck. That nerf would turn it from a subpar deck into an unplayable one. So thats a stupid idea.
---
Lol they're both fine.
---
But mage was really good? Cyclone and giant were both amazing decks even before the lunas buff
---
Calmest rage of all time
---
But that's exactly what I've said... I feel like a whole bunch of people misunderstood my comment completely.
---
&gt;Barnes on 4 into resurrect spell high-rolls are so annoying to play against.
---
Which is the main reason for the nerf. My point was that it's not about win rate, because the deck is not even Tier 1. And Barnes nerf won't affect its win rate THAT much, it will mostly affect how "fun" it is to play against, because even if you will get high-rolled, it will be a turn later.
---
At the same time, I hope that you do realize that the entire Wild format will eventually become a "clown fiesta dice rolls that are impossible to play around", that's the nature of eternal formats. The power level will increase every expansion, what we see right now is still mild compared to what we'll see 2, 3 or 5 years from now.
---
If Big Priest is the line you don't want to cross, then I'm not sure if you'll enjoy the format in general. It has a lot of unfair/impossible to play around strategies. Let's take current Secret Mage as an example - the deck can be way more devastating in the early game than Big Priest ever could. It can flood the board with minions and lock you out of the game with Secrets at the same time. There are lots of games when you simply can't play around it and you just die on Turn 5. Or the Quest Mage before expansion - I had games in which I've dropped 2x 0 mana 8/8 and taken an extra turn on T5. Was it fair? Could opponent play a round it? Of course not. But that's just Wild format.
---
They're good cards, but not in the current meta. Aggro is too strong that you cant wven get to the turn in which you want to play the hero card.
---
If you actually take a look at the core Priest class identity you'd see that damage is actually really important to it. It's just half a class now.
---
&gt;Loosing 1 Health or Divine Shield on every minion you play is a huge deal.
---
When you're using minions are removal spells, it really doesn't matter.
---
&gt;It allows you to avoid Rogue removal ([Backstab](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/backstab.png), [Walk the Plank](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/walk-the-plank-card-art.png), and a couple of wild cards)
---
It wouldn't matter any way. The Control Warrior is throwing their minions at yours by the time Dr. Boom is dropped.
---
&gt;[Plague of Wrath](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Plague-of-Wrath.png): ALWAYS kills ALL your minions
---
Plague of Wrath is usually played after a Warpath anyway as far as I can tell.
---
&gt;Promotes an Self Damaging Agro Architype for Warrior
---
Enrage Warrior wouldn't want to play a card like Dr. Boom, Mad Genius in the first place. Seven mana for a card that does't win the game on its own is too slow for that deck. Overlord's Whip isn't even seeing play in that deck. Instead, the deck prefers Livewire Lance despite it having two fewer durability since Lackeys are just good.
---
Warrior itself already has an easy enough time hurting their own stuff since the deck is doing better than expected.
---
&gt;Changing the Mana cost will change the Hero's initial 777 design (Mana cost, armor gain, armor heropower = 7). That is fitting for his rng based heropower that cycles just like a slot machine (777 is the jackpot). Hopefully you realized this in the hero's initial design. 
---
Sometimes flavor needs to take a back seat to function.
---
Your proposed nerf were do absolutely nothing to affect just how often the card is seeing play. Plus, if you're assertion that it would start being used in the Aggressive Warrior deck turned out to be turn, the card would have just received a buff.
---
r/hearthstone: *makes joke*
---
le epic memers: "lE oUtJeRkEd AgAiN!!!"
---
Yes yes yes. Do it.
---
Ya that's what I got
---
I never thought of it that way. That's pretty clever.
---
Should have made More Arms cost 2. Make people pay 1 mana for the flexibility, not 2. They know this card is barely playable at 3.
---
I was just on a rant, only read your title. Sorry bud .
---
If they nerf IF/DS then Priest is dead class for the forseeable future. How about they give Priest new viable win conditions that survive rotation before they destroy the only one left? I do think it is pretty unfair that Mage and Warrior get to run wild for months while Priest's new good deck gets immediately nerfed. Doesn't surprise me though since blizzard always does that to Priest.
---
Odd Warrior hard-counters any Hunter except Cube Hunter according to VS. That's my experience too as Odd Warrior player. Sure DK Rexxar was annoying, but he wasn't auto-winning against Boom. Odd Warrior could overrun Deathstalker Rexxar and remove his big minions (1 mana shieldslam/dragon package). Because Hunters don't have Boardclears they lose.
---
Odd Mage is considered Tier 3, while Odd Warrior Tier 1 in Rastakhan Rumble's VS report. According to the data nobody stomps Odd Mage harder than Odd Warrior.
---
The reason why Odd Warrior favors over Odd Mage is because Mage can only generate Elements if there is 1 health minion. Without it, Mage does nothing more than 1 damage a turn, Warrior doesn't need to play minion, it only needs to stack armor and watch Mage loses in Fatigue damage.
---
So, full dust refund, right?
---
Also you can put it in an odd deck, but that only matters for wild ofc
---
Maybe theyll listen for once.
---
We don‚Äôt see the data the blizzard does. It‚Äôs my understanding that if left unnerfed priest would have have been the highest win rate deck in the meta, so much so that it would have been oppressive.
---
mountain giant was never a problem before CC.  Mountain giants were played in even lock and there was no problem with that deck. It was strong, but not nerf worthy.  In other words no one saw a problem with giants for even lock at that time.
---
Whizbang at least occupies a sensible niche as that limited demo for each new expansion, especially while people are still playing around to figure out what‚Äôs good. 
---
Zayle is shockingly pointless by comparison even to Whizbang. If they don‚Äôt intend to furnish Zayle-style cards that get released midway through an expansion with reasonably good decks, they should at least make them ‚Äúrefundable.‚Äù The devs seemed to want to use Zayle as promotional hype for the Dalaran Heist, so it‚Äôs unclear why they‚Äôd want people to feel bitten by it.
---
Well I don't want to ruffle too many feathers but a murloc deck shouldn't stand a chance against a control warrior. Boom or no boom.
---
I don't think luna's pocket galaxy would be that good if Conjurer's calling didn't exist. It might be able to exist at 5 mana if that card wasn't also in standard.
---
I saw the comment on that post. Hilarious to see it as it‚Äôs own post now.
---
I think removing the mech tag on omega would have been enough.  Its still an incredibly strong card that way and not discoverable.  Currently its a 4 mana deal 10 damage battlecry with a deal 4 damage to another minion as well.  Its just busted.
---
What I‚Äôve found is Warrior can be rushed down as long as they don‚Äôt get massive value from their control cards in particular Brawl.  If they can kill 5-8 minions with 1 or 2 Brawls it lets them stabilize so their ultimate value kicks in.
---
These look awesome, super pleased
---
I'm proud of the new blizzard team for letting us try playing  with the buffs,  then reversing them because of the community response. They're definitely only trying to make the game more enjoyable for everyone. A response could have been to buff other classes to match the power level and result in a huge power creep, but they did a much more humble thing in admitting their mistakes.
---
Let's hall of fame all 5+ cost minions cause of galaxy as well.
---
All good mate. I myself dislike the idea of a cosmetic coating 80 bucks. Why not just give the option to buy them in the shop for 10 or less. + I just really like rafaam as a character and all, would just really like to see him as a possible hero you could choose
---
Why stop at 20 when you can go for 30? /s
---
Not joking, I have a decent winrate with that meme of a deck
---
I'd prefer to let the format play out first before becoming complete doom and gloom.
---
If anything, the card probably won't be a mulligan keep any more when priced at nine mana.
---
I do not dislike you as a person but Gods do I wish you queue into nothing but Reno Decks that slam Geist on turn 6 every game or just Mecha'thun Warlock.
---
A bit disingenuous to call it ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù when it doesn‚Äôt do the effect until you‚Äôre at 10 mana. Vilespine was ran in tempo/aggro decks whereas Omega Devastator would never be ran in a tempo/aggro deck. They‚Äôre very different cards, honestly
---
Is there a link to these top decks? I‚Äôve been playing with a homebrew priest deck that has been tons of fun but I would love to see about optimizing it.
---
2 mana nerf means 2 turns for faster decks to defeat warrior, and it also means that they will have to play a 9 mana gain 7 armor in order to get the effects. It is a big nerf to CW against faster decks imo. Just because in one game CW have the luck to draw all his removal against you does not mean that it happens all the time.
---
Hey haven't played the game in almost 2 years just wondering if someone would look at my deck and which cards i should dust.
---
They definitely dont encourage it, but aggro could definitely see a rise as usual
---
it'll be easier for you if you just don't stay stupid shit on the internet
---
Do you really care if your first half of CC is 5 mana when your giant is now 0?
---
