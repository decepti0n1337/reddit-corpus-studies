Playing a card designed for 8 mana and thus later game play, for possibly 1 mana isn't broken?

Heh ok.

I really want that brawl where you draft 2 cards comes back.
---
Deck of Wonders and black cat was fucking hilarious.
---
does he mean in his deck , or the  amount he can summon ?
---
He could be referring to the fact that Sir Finley is a murloc
---
how much was the commission? I mean if the title was "look at my Fanart" it would be ok, but since you are promoting yourself with a free commercial and a link to your twitter, about drawing for commissions then my question looks fair...
---
how da hell have you guys not hit the turn limit yet
---
The only tech card the game really needs at this point is anti-armour tech. Its strictly better health with no way of punishing it, and often leads to the most degenerate playstyle possible, fatigue. A way to deal with would be very welcome (or just make Alexstraza reduce armour as well, thatd work).
---
Skull, cube, guldan win. 5 mana dearhrattle summon voidlord. 4 mana heal for 7. 1 mana destroy minion heal a shit ton.
---
May have been the anomaly that lets you get loot from any class
---
hmmm i usually win because he played plague of murlocs , tho to be fair i did have the titanic ring when he did that , its funny also because he cast it twice when i get way to good of a roll.
---
At least you stand a chance if they draw both tip the scales. Allot of broken decks have given me nightmares
---
I can't believe this happened, who won?
---
How was it that you put Thekal down and the boss bounced it to HIS hand? 
---
Anyway, it could have been worse. You could play Thekal and have Yogg play recklace fury 😂
---
Yogg &gt; Astral Communion &gt; Tree of Life

Fun stuff
---
Tomorrow pretty much whenever your tavern brawl comes out
---
42, it’s the answer to everything.
---
No
---
Well considering Kasa is under the influence of the Plague of Madness I wouldn’t say that supports the theory...it’s literally about making you see allies as the enemy
---
Unbelievable. #unplayable
---
And Tak is just grinning. :D
---
With this boss the right most minions attacks at the end of turn so it basically has charge
---
Can't wait for the second one
---
I still think we need armor tech of some kind. Boom would have been far easier to manage if we had a way of dealing with armor in a big way. "Destroy all your enemy's armor" would be too much but something like "Deal double damage to armor while this minion is in play" would be awesome.

lmao that spelling is fucked

He probably would have won if he didnt play anything right ?
---
Can this quest please have its discover mechanic back
---
No.
---
You can repeat a plague lord to unlock the 3 plague lords quest.  You cannot unlock the senior assistants yet.
---
the reward is not the issue. the condition is. its actually really hard to make a deck that cats 10 spells fast enough especially when you are starting with 1 less card.
---
&gt;a Secret that counters Battlecries 
---
As a shaman player who has at least three shudderwock decks at any given time, I've found myself often thinking during games, "boy I'm glad he can't play a card to nullify my next battlecry"
---
You can repeat plague lords but my understanding is the SR. Are a reward for completing all the plage lords with the same hero. Example (having the crown on finly in all the "wings")

I choose to cast Power of Creation.
---
I literally think the only point is if you're playing a super long match and you're running out of fuel.
---
I can't say that it's ever really decided a match for me, unlike Druid and Shaman quest. It just feels underwhelming lol
---
Are you stalling out your matches?
---
They're all nuts. One of them has a bunch of Legendaries, including quest reward type cards (Amara, Highkeeper Ra, Azari, etc) and some insanely broken spells. 
---
Basically, if you ever get VIP and you see that, better take it.
---
I read on some forum that if the plague lord plays thekal and goes to 1 hp if you lose to him and play again he doesn’t keep the armor and is just left at one health
---
Brilliant! I'll have another!
---
GRIFTAH!
---
It just the payoff of the quest is shit,especially if you get book of spectre or the secret tutor thing.
---
In case you’re curious, Zayle doesn’t work either - got him in a random deck
---
Go to the tavern. It gives you an extra visit to Bob, so you get to beef your deck up more than usual. Could be super helpful at the end.
---
&gt; It’s not just Hearthstone either, there are other apps
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I think its fun to play against its very different matchup then usual. Only deck i dont like playing against is basicly any type of priest
---
Did it start out at 300 hp before the fight? If not that's a little bit of a bug, otherwise that's expected!
---
Jokes aside, isn't highlander mage 8 tiers above quest warlock?
---
Wonder if Hearthstone people regret that sac pact decision yet.
---
Yes.  And that's why you win, they can't kill you but you can kill them.

RAVEN#21301 EU trading 80g quest, you go 1st
---
How many golden legendaries did you get?
---
Well, talking about the ones that do.
---
This boss randomly bursting you for a gazillion is a pretty dumb aspect of the encounter.
---
Yes, sure! Look earlier in comments - i left link to my twitter post, where i posted wallpapers out of my different artworks :) this one there too
---
Situation: Too many direct damage spells for mage, making generate/discover random spells cards too powerful.
---
Solution: ~~Stop making cards that generate/discover random spells and nerf primordial glyph~~ Fuck the cardpool up by designing 500 completely useless shit cards, ruining mage forever.
---
*Your wish is my suggestion!*
---
Coin into totem bro.
---
OP's account has only commented in /r/dominion and mtg related subreddits. The first and only post he made on /r/hearthstone is about how expensive HS is.
---
OP didn't provide any proof. He said for someone who has none of the standard cards, it would take 1k but as someone who took a break, he should have at least some classic cards. There are 5 expansions in standard. On average, for each expansion, he spent 1000/5
---
=$200. You get 60 packs for $69.99 so that is ~171 packs per expansion. The recent expansions had 23+ legendary cards each. [Assuming](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics) you get one legendary for every 20 packs, you are still pretty far away from getting all legendaries without dusting(which he didn't mention) duplicate cards. There are a lot of missing information. For the amount of money he randomly spent, the amount of effort he put in making this post to provide useful info for the community is suspiciously small. Seriously who the fk does that? You take a break from the game, then come back and suddenly you spend 1k to get all the cards? It doesn't even sound like he enjoys the game or he is trying to start a serious discussion on the prizing model of the game. He is just telling people not to spend money on the game.
---
Pass and emote
---
🤔
---
Any proof? Or you just made this easy karma grab post?
---
Yeah, I call bullshit as well
---
Woah dude, these are crazy, just downoaded all of em, i'll make use of these for wallpapers, thanks! And dont be afraid to post stuff where it "shouldn't be". Some people dont know, ehat they want, untill you present it to 'em. Keep up the great work, this is cool.
---
P.S. (Do a Sylvannas ;) )
---
Okay, nice and all..but when is Ossirian Tear nerf coming?
---
Yea but thats expensive you NEED 2 legendarys and rpics and you prob want godfrey and voidlord and hemmet
---
Shoulda stayed banned.
---
Isn't Barnes the only wild-only card that has been nerfed so far?
---
&gt; probably isn't worth it
---
You don't say.
---
Yamyamyamyamyamyam
---
None
---
Rogue mill? Really? Prep nerfs killed my list.
---
You can do the same thing with mirage + the hearthstone, which might just be more consistent seeing as it's nearly impossible to pull off jr tombdiver.
---
He is also in OTK paladin and that deck gets played in GM. So the notion that he wasn’t in a meta deck in a while is pretty inaccurate.
---
I cast maelstrom portal hoping to get [[tabby cat]]
---
&gt;It got nerfed one and a half times already, also it's tier 2, stop crying.
---
You'd be the type to cry about "DoNt TeLl mE WhAt To PlAy"

Hahaha using a few downvotes to validate your opinion, damn that is sad af.  
---
You really should scroll it one more time just so you realize the entire time I did not complain. I simply stated what I expected from the expansion for 15 EUR. It's called sharing thoughts and debates, things you do on SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.   
---
"
---
 It's you that is making zero sense.  
---
" expansions are normally free, this one cost 15 EUR, so yes the community expects more content "  
---
And they got more content. You yourself said you were happy with the content and the 15 EUR you spent. So you're just typing to be typing at this point.   
---
In your OWN words again you fuckin daft idiot you showed how you are literally just throwing attitude for throwing attitude. If I am not complaining in my own words and I am satisfied with the expansion, THAN HOW AM I COMPLAIN?  Reading one sentence and assuming is ur own problem
---
...which is hella tedious. Why on earth would anyone want to restore health after chipping his already annoying large HP? I think you're the one missing the point here, mate.
---
Mecha'Thun incoming
---
For good reason. It can be ridicously overpowered
---
Actually really glad to know this. I was sitting on a 0 mana hella stat-boosted copy of that dragon that full heals and kept going "I know it's a new phase, but I've never seen his health white at below 300, so maybe it'll still heal to that". In the future I will as they say 'git gud'
---
Wait really? Thanks for the notice man!
---
[removed]
---
Oh good. I'm glad they patched it. Saw like 15 posts about that issue.
---
Yeah, I got his mage deck early on a heroic run and it was so busted it killed most heroic bosses by turns 3 or 4. The final boss was tougher, he got me down to 4 HP, but then I played a card that restored me to full health and drew 5 cards. I won a few turns later.
---
Face
---
I did have multiple draws in pve though (and some of my friends too), its not hard to force it, and its normally a way to reset the fight and have a second try. Its harder in pvp since you and your opponent need to be playing a fatige deck or stuff like control warrior or linecraker druid or reno benedictus priest.
---
In any case, a dev has commented here and they actually confirm they did know a draw could happen, but that the outcome should have been different taking into account how they designed it to behave in this situation.
---
Nobody is having a smug attitude here. I understand that since this is written and not personal interaction is harder for you to see my expresions, but in no way Im saying this as a "haha u dumb" way. If you see this as a "smug" comment, Im sorry but thats completely on you.
---
Leeroy worth it. Always a consideration for aggro and twice as good as rocketeer.
---
I remember just running armor cards in Druid.
---
Yeah it's super hard to get 6 secrets. I was able to pull it off with mystical mirage so I could play a bunch of my secrets twice as well as a couple of lucky magic tricks for a few extra. I think I had 5 or 6 secrets in my deck. You can also use the treasure that casts all of your spells from your deck
---
I had this but I was able to get right hand man on the tomb diver :D
---
Note: The game forced me to concede after some amount of turns. I feel heartbroken.
---
Damn she’s fine as hell 😳
---
&gt;Shush. You aren't trolling me.
---
of course i'm not! I'm trying to endorse you! You shouldn't limit yourself! There's nothing you can't do! Any parquet... can be yours... even the laminate.
---
Something in the snip snap deck will get nerfed pretty soon, but it might be mechwarper, a common, or just a mechanic change which wouldn’t give dust at all. Beyond that, nothing seems overall powerful at the moment. Secret mage probably doesn’t need a nerf, and no other decks seem to be problematic.
---
What does “lvl 21” stand for? Nobody uses levels in hearthstone, I guess you messed up the sub with r/artifact
---
Tired to watch. After the 400th time seeing the ad with Gordon McDouche chomping cereal in his mic I quit.
---
Plus a lot of these are just the spells or tokens, not actual battlecries
---
Underbelly is a good card when you're ahead. It's a mediocre card if you're behind. Taking several sub-optimal turns just to play underbelly and generate a few random murlocs would not save you from being behind in tempo. Against zoo you have to play aggressively for tempo, but you also can't overplay your hand.
---
Do you play wild? I’m sure eventually you’ll be able to make a semi passable deck with this in wild. You can make almost anything work there up to a point.
---
Play a tempo mage list, replace one fireball with a quest, and play the same playstyle as tempo (except a bit more control oriented). The quest then works as a 2nd breathe and gives good closing options
---
There is but i have only seen it once and it offered me two mage secrets and one rouge secret. Seems to be really rare though
---
I remember in the prerelease discussion where people kept claiming this card was good, and I thought I was living in crazy town.
---
small indie-company
---
Oh wow, I had not known how Gnomebliterator works before I read you comment and googled it. 
---
Is the stacking effect mentioned anywhere? I have never picked it up in my runs because 10 Dmg (+10 Dmg once) did sound really bad.
---
It doesnt change as much. Stuff like jade druid has actually just gotten cheaper every year since it doesnt run fandral anymore. And good decks in the format will probably remain good decks since they can only get better, and nerfs for wild arent that common.
---
I was thinking more like a 3/3/3 that gains +1/+1 and Rush if they control a Taunt, or an aggressively statted Legendary that can hit face thru Taunts.
---
Warlock, Rogue, Hunter, Warrior, and Mage I’d say have almost consistently been good in some capacity.
---
Rogue and Hunter are almost always good tempo/aggro decks and even if they aren’t the top deck they have been consistently decent (a lot of f2p legend runs are/were hunter due to impressive burst and hyena, and Rogue has been nerfed a bunch since classic and has only recently stopped having miracles).
---
Warlock, Warrior, and Mage all have either decent classic/basic cards or good hero powers that help them. Handlock, Control Warrior, and for a while Freeze Mage were all meta for a very long time and it was mostly stuff like Jades or true otk that pushed some of them out (at which point zoolock showed up and mage chucked fireballs at faces, warrior has had good aggro decks but rarely a good classic/basic aggro deck).
---
Yes and no. 
---
The meta for wild changes just as frequently, however there are decks that will always be tier 1/tier 2 no matter what. For example - secret mage, odd rogue, odd paladin, Reno etc. These decks have and will always stand the test of time.
---
we have a lot of beginners playing this time that wont bring 4 full meta decks either, feel free to join just for fun
---
In my defence, MSoG is the worst designed set they’ve ever released, filled with power creep so you couldn’t ignore it, and I barely played hearthstone until it rotated out.
---
So I honestly just blanked out on that whole era.
---
Personally I'm 0 and 4 for getting the VIP Membership and seeing the upgraded tavern. It might be tuned to be balanced but it feels like \_shit\_.
---
The casters themselves need breaks too. It's not like at tournaments where they swap casters after every match or two. In GM, the same two casters cast an entire region's matches for the day, which usually amounts to 6-8 consecutive matches. Making them do all that with no breaks wouldn't be good for them or the broadcast.
---
Why would you ask for help if you can't handle the answer? Octosari can be devastating if you decide to go for an aggresive playstyle which as hunter is a pretty effective plan to follow, card draw is way too important in arena and hunter has almost no ways to draw.
---
Well he did climb five to legend with it, so its at least a decent deck if you're skilled.
---
Just spitballing on the actual scene at hand, you could have the kitty cat in profile looking to the right, stalking to the right, with Tyrande in the background between the trees.
---
The little white guys could just be incidental to the scene at hand.  Between their existence and the movement of both Tyrande and the kitty cat it suggests a rich world, and the the white guys would act as a proxy for the viewer - incidentally an observer of an ongoing pursuit.
---
I think my overall issue with it is that this is exactly what it says on the tin.  It's Tyrande, looking at some little sprite, and we are looking at Tyrande looking at it.  There's an implication of the past, but no implication of the future so it's hard to put yourself into the scene.
---
The question wasn't asking for Meta Defining, it was asking for  "Good/Strong."
---
Warrior definitely had some stronger decks, but it was also really bad for quite a while (FWA nerf to Boomsday, when Odd Warrior got good).  Mage/Rogue has never been not at least "good" or "fine."
---
Well mid-2014 to early 2015 was practically defined by Undertaker Hunter. When Undertaker Hunter was nerfed, Face Hunter was Tier 1 for some time, as well as Midrange Hunter which was at times a Tier 1 deck throughout 2015 and still playable on ladder throughout 2016 til the release of MSG.
---
It also depends on how urgently you need the dust. There's no point holding onto a bad card if you're missing the deck you need right now.
---
But you should also be thinking of whether you need the deck to win, or are just building some meme deck. Dusting for a meme deck is never a good idea.
---
Totally up to you, I find I'm still opening classic packs with the weekly tavern brawl.
---
I just tried it, and I love it!
---
The last time they "nuked Priest from orbit" Combo Priest remained tier 1.
---
It's an easy copy + paste that will get karma in basically any hearthstone post (double if it's about a problem)
---
Leeroy is in a powerlevel that they will never print again. Charge is a failed mechanic which while haste works in mtg it fails in hearthstone because you cant block. That's why rush is go to mechanic now. I don't think I'm Leeroy will ever be 'bad'. And is always worth crafting and slamming in any aggro deck out of rank 5.
---
I think people forget how terrible some old metas really were. People want the game to be a specific way but forget that certain classes were just incredibly oppressive back then. People only ever reference the obvious ones like Midrange Shaman, Secret Paladin, Jade Druid (KFT), Razakus, Undertaker Hunter, etc. People don’t remember fatigue mirrors between Justicar Warrior and Priest where you spent 40+ minutes waiting to fatigue the other person.
---
Everybody ran the same neutral cards in every deck up until the first wild rotation, azure, Sylvanas, Rag, Boom.. I feel like people block out of their mind how terribly boring the game was and how many decks relied on having the answer each turn to really win consistently. Had to have a BGH before 7 or 8 for the big boys, had to also have the big boys yourself to curve out well. 
---
People seem to also forget how rampant aggro used to be with Zoolock, Face Hunter, Druid during Ungoro, Oil Rogue, etc etc. The game had far worse balancing and much longer wait times back then too between changes.
---
If left is wrong, right is left. But if left is right, right is wrong. Hence, the correct pick is the middle one.
---
I'm guessing the breaks are there because Blizzard planned/hoped to sell ads into them.
---
yay
---
Well, they are on a 30 minute delay.
---
Tirion moves in and out of the meta from expansion to expansion, there are some expansions where he sees virtually no play. But as a powerful legendary from the classic set it's probably not a card you'll ever regret crafting. He's good to have in your collection.
---
Two points here:
---
1) There are not breaks after every game. In Grandmasters, there is always a break after game one of a match. That's it. There is no break after game two, and no break before going to the next match. Source: I cast GM and that was both the explained and executed break cadence for the show. The only exception is that there is also a break between the initial intro segment and the first match. 
---
2) Break frequency is the result of contractual obligations between Blizzard esports and Twitch for ad impressions. Some number of them are certainly important for the casters and production crew to use the restroom, but the primary reason that their number increased since early HCT days (when we'd pretty much only break between B05 matches to swap casters) is the need to fulfill these obligations.
---
yes, that's the reason i think
---
Nice
---
Yup, this often has me switching channels, or just closing the site. I watch on ps4, mainly, so can't block the ads. 12 is a ridiculous amount, worse than most sports games, and they suck too, same repeat ads. The breaks are just too long.

This plague lord is a fucking nightmare , couldnt even take 20hp from him since he also summons the 8/8 deathrattle heal 8, oh and his entombed minions where sylvanas after sylvanas, fuck this guy
---
Let me get this straight: you want to play a deck, but you don't know if its aggro or control, and if it is aggro you dont want to play it anymore?
---
Either youve never seen the deck or any cards in it, in which case, why do you want to play it? Or, youve seen it, want to play it, but don't want to be branded an "aggro player" so you want to make sure strangers on the internet wont judge you for it? Im sorry, i just dont follow the logic.
---
Hey, since we're doing this now, I got VIP 3 times and never Bob's deck. Misery at its finest. And yet I can't wait for wing 3
---
Got him down to 105hp on my first attempt, but that second hero power is very painful.
---
Yeah. same. things where looking good then he domed me for 14. And reno doesn't even offer taunts so not much i could do
---
just thought id share my first battle against the new tomb boss with the new hero, the dumbest match ive played yet. 
---
im was running a swarm deck since i had the passive that gave me +2 armor on minion death and a i had some choice cards to go with it such as bees, living mana and spreading plagues, got a hadronox and nzoth, and also an anduin.  i ended on which a bunch more card generating minions, as well as a discounted mana passive, so i knew i could withstand any opponent. 
---
my first problem began immediately, i had an anomaly on, double deathrattles. thus i had to endure countless waves of giant minions and it worked surprising well. i even decked him out (with 6 turns of fatigue) thanks to his insistence of using that 3/7 kobold that does 3 damage to everything and him shadowing it every time. i also had a great boon of my tombs producing rin, so i was set for the next phase to deck him out immediately. 
---
by the time i got him under 200 health, i was sitting myself at about 150 with armor but i was down to only 7 cards left. after a plague of death on my living mana set me back enough time for me to start fatiguing in phase 2 i slapped down anzari and was a bout to take my victory lap to phase 3...except he had one card left, hakkar. i had no choice to kill it and died shortly after phase 3 facing down 30 corrupted bloods and like 8 fatigue damage :(
---
This is actually a viable thing to do, i remember RatsmahHS the arena player doing a video about it.
---
Respect the drip.
---
Reborn guy and discover +1/+1 are too hard. Without insane RNG you’re not getting to the final boss which this adventure is all about.
---
I feel like I’ve been cheated out of my money. Then again it’s Blizzard what was I thinking.
---
Actually it's a Common
---
but I'm not normal, am I?
---
Nice. I honestly feel like this adventure has been pretty easy so far tbh. Took me two attempts with Reno at the first one, first attempt I brought him down to like 24. 
---
Then I one shot the second one with Finley.
---
&gt;In a best of 5 I spend more time watching ads....
---
That’s... the point.
---
Yes but I excluded that from the discussion because for your argument, OP would be saying "get more casters" so they get breaks by replacing casters.
---
I concentrated on the thing that you can't fix. The break that the players need.
---
1 mana 2/4 is not bad at all.
---
No one cares.
---
Who would have guessed people would reply without reading what they are replying to.
---
Not going to lie I totally threw my laptop (against the mattress) 😂

If that is the case, it is just bad design, which was my point.

Heal synergy is a big one - not needing to expend resources to respawn your 4/8 taunt guys is nice.
---
Genn and Baku in standard? Guess odd Paladin is back in the menue. No seriously. Its good that those two got HoFed. Their impact on the game altered many things to this day.
---
Paladin doesn't have a stake in this fight. Their big problem is that as a control deck they'll always have to expend two cards to clear the board, and they've never really got an infinite value engine. For midrange, they've had their moments, but are often outclassed. Then Aggro paladin (of various kinds usally centerd around 1-2 drops, or the hero power) is becoming more and more prevalent but dude Paladin was a meme for a while. As for combo it was considerd Tier 3-4 until very recently.

I think he just got tired of streaming and is off living his life HS free.

For the same reason, it makes sandstorm elemental into a one sided board clear.

Perfect timing, just breached 700 gold this morning.

If it's not "blessings to you," you're doing it wrong.
---
Same here. It feels easy and I see how there’s replay-ability with the hero powers and fancy card you get to pick in the beginning but I’m finding myself bored with it after just beating a run twice

If you want to put some effort into it, you could look at VSyndicate, TempoStorm, and decks brought for pro play then create some sort of "Influence rating" and graph them over the course of Hearthstone's Lifespan.

She's unlocked with today's chapter.

# Twist 
---
**Plague of Death** \- Both players start with an 'Eternal Tomb'.
---
**Eternal Tomb -** A powerful deathrattle minion sits in a permanent token on the board, similar to Dalaran Heist's Violet Prison.
---
The difference here is that a counter starts equal to the mana cost of the minion, and each time a friendly minion dies, the counter goes down by 1. Once it hits zero, the minion in the tomb is summoned, *and a new minion appears in the tomb.* This means both you and the AI will keep getting minion after minion.

# Xatma, Plague Lord of Death
---
Xatma's deck is full of powerful deathrattle minions, further augmented by the twist of this wing. We're talking Sylvanas, Hakkar, Sneeds, Tirion, Obsidian Statue, Stalagg &amp; Feugen, etc.
---
**Hero Power 1:** Forboding Fate - 0-Mana "Trigger a friendly minion's deathrattle". As you can imagine, quite problematic when he's got big deathrattles not only in his deck, but popping out of the tomb every couple of turns.
---
**Hero Power 2:** Death's Embrace - Passive "The first minion for each player that dies in a turn gets **Reborn"**. Basically, he has a board full of big deathrattles, and each turn, the first one to die comes back with 1 health. And because this is from the hero power, **Silence** doesn't work. You get your first minion back too, but it's far more likely to be favouring the Plague Lord.
---
**Hero Power 3:** Death's Gaze - 1-Mana "Deal 1 damage to all minions. If any die, add an *Untimely Demise* to your hand."
---
Untimely Demise - 3-Mana Spell: "Deal 3 damage to all enemies." Same as Lich King's "Death and Decay" spell.
---
Where’s the preparation
---
I'd say not knowing how to take a screenshot but that's not actually unusual on this sub.
---
You haven't conceded?
