dang, people keep reposting this

Surely any reasonable person can freely admit than when the “counter” to a deck is to burn your own draw (especially when only one class can reliably do that), then *maaaybe* there’s a problem that needs to be addressed?
---
You didn't address my points you just called them stupid with no basis. Try to make a more compelling argument next time.

To someone else. I'm disabling inbox replies. I think after reading this thread more I'm really gonna have to stop going to gaming subreddits. They're just a nonstop whining fest with the same garbage again and again where people aren't actually interested in a discussion they just wanna cry about something. I went in more detail in another reply, and I think I'm just gonna give up. It ain't worth it.
---
Have a nice day.
---
let’s do some math. 
---
20 + 7 + 7 - 7 = 27. 
---
You have 20 cards in your deck. You shuffle in 7 cards. Elk shuffles in 7 cards (1 for each card shuffled). You draw 7 cards. You end up with 27 cards in deck.
---
Lol. Well, trust me, hunter has been better than it was last expansion. On more than one occasion I believe. But ***particular*** on the occasion of Undertaker Hunter.
---
No idea why you're being downvoted. Not everyone can or should like every single brawl. So if this happens to be the one you don't like then at least you can get out with your free pack very quickly. 
---
Yes this one isn't fun or wacky and is basically just ladder, but some of us actually like that because of the reward structure.
---
I respect you for this. However, to me, it’s weird you call it “fatal” everyone I’ve ever watched, played with, against, etc. calls it lethal
---
Oh shit that was me! One of my favorite cards to get off dragon roar for sure, that was a hell of a moment.
---
You are a morally disgusting person

I swear to god I’ve never actually seen someone use the word “fewer” on Reddit. I’m pretty sure 99% of the people on here don’t know how or when to use it at all.
---
weapon removal, heals, deck manipulation
---
I don’t think I’ll ever get used to a voice that isnt Dan Green
---
People are acting like it is but it really isn't yet. There's plenty of other decks performing great in general as well and also some that counter is particularly well.
---
There’s a reason a hearthstone limits boards to 7 minions.
---
Why are you gay?

Ugh, I hate playing against Rogues. I haven't had a fun game against one yet and I really hope they don't become the go-to deck.

Ayy another dragon shaman!

I had an incredible game against bomb warrior last night as battlecry shaman. I stole their bomb thrower with MCT. Proceeded to bounce it back to my hand and play it at least 5 times, and pulled out a win when I was near the point of conceding halfway through the game. 
---
If you can't beat them... join them? I had more bombs in their deck by the end than they had in mine!

27 packs, (2/3) legendaries.
---
Oblivitron, and Arch Villian Rafaam, also I got Prince Liam from the quest that gave a Witchwood pack.
---
Pretty happy with my legendaries but I am a little disappointed in how many traveling healers I got (over 6).
---
That doesn’t mean that’s the meta. Those are just the top decks from the first day...
---
I got lunara for quite some time, but don't get how to use her, can anyone help?
---
I made this deck. :)
---
That’s really unfair to Gwent.
---
What are you spending your gold on? I'm f2p and bought 90 packs yesterday. I'll probably buy 75 for 2nd expansion this year and another 75 on the 3rd. The returns really start to diminish after that.
---
Just because weapon tech can be run in a deck doesn't mean it always will be. Plus, most of the popular Bomb Warrior lists currently do not (Control Warrior is but that is a different enough deck), and that deck is probably better off teching for aggression rather than pretty much only one of two popular decks right now that actually are playing weapons.
---
What's funny is that before koft, mind blast was unplayable trash.
---
&gt; reasonable
---
I don't see how, Blizzard would literally be throwing their money away. Card games are designed to be RNG based to get you to gamble on packs, it'd kind of just how it is, because it works. No I don't like it but you can't expect them to give you a full set for one lump sum, because then you won't keep buying more packs.
---
Not always, but every deck has access to weapon removal. If you're also not playing specifically against Control Warrior, you're probably going to be fairly safe.
---
As a player who is trying to use a slower version of secret pally, I appreciate this post
---
A lot of decks ran him without the corpsetaker package just because of how good he was. It's just a solid card.
---
I think what this comes down to is the more that someone has to craft, the more likely they are to have buyer's remorse, thinking that they should've spent their valuable dust on something better and blame themselves for not spending it more carefully.
---
Because this game's reward structure only rewards winning (a dilemma in the truest sense of the word), players are told by the game that winning is the only thing that will advance you whether that's in arena, ranked, or standard. It's thus difficult to justify doing something sub-optimal in the name of fun, because you're delaying your progress to that next pack, that new opportunity to make your collection more versatile, in the name of playing a deck that by definition will lose more games.
---
Then you either played the deck wrong or made a bad deck or got super unlucky I don't know what you want me to say. Midrange hunter is a known hard counter to control warrior.
---
The only useful criteria for word definitions is common use. If a misuse becomes common enough it's no longer a misuse. Every word you know was once "wrong".
---
Go to your collection where you normally see the cards you own. Now look at the very TOP RIGHT. There are two tabs, one for card backs and one for heroes, go to the heroes and set Lunara as your favorite Druid
---
Holy shit. Great idea, thank you.
---
Yeah you’re right. But I think they unbanned it because the pool isn’t as broken
---
But think of all the ressurect possibilities ... Wait
---
Tempo druid is crazy good. Rank 20-12 with 2 losses so far(and I'm playing poorly). Pretty cheap overall too (~5k dust)
---
There's a satisfaction from making your opponent rage quit after you rez your 10th lich king that you can't get from anywhere else.
---
Druid legendary
---
Game is dead. Move on.
---
*losing xD and no i am the one you hate losing against muahahaha
---
It has some bad matchups and I think more powerful decks are gonna pop up, like what we saw with Jepeto Hunter. I would wait a bit to make any major crafts. Bomb warrior is good though, the games are just gonna be long sometimes.
---
Ah okay, thank you.
---
I'm not talking new content for an existing game, in what I said i specificaly said new games, I doubt there's many games devs left at valve, at least from the half life days, based on the #1 reason for devs that have lefts IP's like wow being wanting to work on something new. As a software dev my self, I find working on legacy products a bore, as your very constrained, now in a game they have some more freedom but there's still only so long you can work on a 2,4,10+ year old product befor you simply just get bored. I've worked at 3 software company's in my career and the #1 reason most people leave a place is boredom, #2 is career advancement and #3 is bad management.
---
You’ll actually find it interesting to know that Big Priest actually doesn’t need Barnes. It’s a high-rolly card that enables shenanigans, but in some cases it actually lowers your winrate. (Shadow Essence into Barnes Can lose you the game on the spot)
---
OMEGALUL
---
 fair enough, I’m usually assuming people are always trying to climb when they make complaint posts, usually because I feel if you’re not trying to grind higher then what’s it matter if you just concede and play someone else? but from my perspective it’s easier to counter build 2 decks that just getting lucky with the right counter in wild.
---
Gods Unchained
---
God forbid a new card support literally one card in the past.
---
When the new expac comes out I spend all my gold. Then nothing at all til the next one. I don't play arena so it just piles up. I mostly just log on and do my daily quest and the brawl every week. This time I opened 86 packs doing that.  That gives me enough dust to pick one class and fill in holes to get one deck I reaaaaaaallly wanted. I usually have enough cards and dust to have some decent regular decks too but I always go out of my way to make one that feels fancy to me.
---
Here comes the BOOM!
---
BEST shit on youtube
---
Bomb explodes, then draw and copy the next card. I think the bombs should do that for all things that draw and affect some card. Resolve the bomb, then do the thing on the next card.
---
They won’t because he is already a card and that would be confusing.
---
I'm running weapon removal in most of my decks now. Wrenchcalibur, Spectral Cutlass, and the new hunter legendary that gives them a legendary weapon are prominent, and worth running ooze for.
---
Maybe we'll recieve a free hero via solo adventure like KoFT?
---
Counter point. Those moments are the fun as fuck ones. Chaining stonehill when your barely surviving, chaining glyphs has no actual game impact without a mana wyrm on board and chaining angler is one of the only way that deck survives.
---
So no
---
Also shudderwock nerf had nothing to do with RNG infinite. It got nerfed because it was consistently infinite. Fucking massive difference between those two.
---
golden gruul op
---
And you're right. But countering decks doesn't make them go away. Also, can we talk about how OP thinks thief rogue is a broken deck dominating the meta?
---
Khadgar was already a hero and they made him a card jn the latedt expansion. Medihv is a hero and he's also a card. Varian isn't even in standard, he's one of the oldest cards there is.
---
tbh with rogue spectral cutlass and warrior bomb weapon every deck right now should have at least one ooze, im personally running two
---
Any smart player will wait until they play the hero to play Blastmaster they can proc bombs right away
---
It does but the bug is on the Horror battlecry
---
Simple maths, they used to do 80 packs for 50 bucks preorder and now they don't and stopped giving out release goodies so this is the first time in like 3-4 years I haven't preordered at all.  It's not worth it anymore.  The math came out to something like 10 bucks a month to play if you preorder every expansion which is similar to MMO subscriptions or any other sub game that you spend a few hours in a week.  Now?  Not even close, you need more packs to get more cards and it's more expensive...not worth anymore.
---
If you disenchant it you can always craft the regular version, if you care not about golden then there is nothing to lose.
---
And you may open regular stallandris meaning yay free legend.
---
Hearthstone Deck Tracker and Hearth Arena are good.
---
Indeed, and they wonder why Blizzard stock is plummeting
---
Yeah no idea what that’s about lol. I mean sure it’s annoying when they get highrolls but no matter what deck you’re playing if they highroll you’re gonna lose. But like salon removal/tempo/aggro ruins that deck
---
I'm not sure how they could possibly test that without actually doing it
---
And we didnt even get the 3 free packs like almost every expansion
---
It's really annoying because it's not like it's frustrating to run into, or breaking the game, it's just that it's seeing too much play.
---
you tech in who is able to draw dr.boom first?
---
My wild cutlass deck runs all the tri class cards for that reason.
---
We are two days in. Chill
---
Is this arena?
---
I played against paladin and lost 6 games in a row. Do paladin players have hacks enabled?
---
Me too. I climbed very consistent with Nomi Rogue, it's a super strong, fast and aggressive deck.
---
Nah. This is a hard control mirror, so the combo deck has a much higher chance to win here. This deck gets dunked on by decks like tempo rogue and murloc shaman.
---
No way
---
Nah, I just put in a bit of weapon removal and moved Bomb Warrior to a positive matchup.
---
I would love to see that!
---
Please tell me you're not using stats from this week only...
---
Yes the bomb warrior is ruining the fun. I don't have a problem against otk hunter. Only way is to craft bomb warrior but I am missing most of the cards there. It ll cost me over 8k dust and I won't do it.
---
Last expansion I Whizbanged and got the bottom tier decks with the lowest winrates at hsreplay and finished 0-3.
---
I Whizbanged again this expansion, and finished a very good 9-3. Feeling very good about that deck choice.
---
have fun elsewhere:')
---
Go for it.
---
Probably will be only playing for quests till next expansion or may be arena sometimes.
---
Golden cards are entirely vanity. If it matters to you, craft em. Otherwise, don’t. I dust every gold card that I have a nongold playset of
---
Dane made so many great combos. That alone justifies the card's existence.
---
I'm saying there shouldn't be a wild at all. Just standard. Wild to me is just a gimic bandaid. Wild should always be in tournaments. Always in arena. This idea of a standard card set is needless. It just acts as a way for blizzard to promote unnecessary profit at the expense of players who have played for so long and invested in so much.
---
Wild to meshould be what standard is instead of being the lower tiered way to play.
---
Thats a new card. Suicidal blademaster. Battlecry: kill himself.
---
But calling it out has 0 impact on Blizzard, not spending money/not playing is the only thing that matters.
---
I assume his sexual life goes quickly too.
---
Got 7 with Whizbang! Not so good like you but i was very happy about it :D
---
I am also feeling frustrated, I have 3 different decks: vereesa hunter, theif rogue, &amp; plot twist warlock, but I keep dying before turn 8 or 9 to literally any deck, even mirror matches. I spent a lot of money this release so that I could finally get back into the game going strong with a huge shift in the meta, &amp; I have finally gotten past rank 15 (currently stuck at 11), but these new decks are u fun, uninteractive, &amp; there's hardly any consistent removal or defense to speak of right now. I'm just going to keep holding out for the next few weeks &amp; hope the meta settles in a place that is a bit friendlier in the competitive play of hearthstone.

Zilliax is good in pretty much any deck. He’s not always the best choice, but he’s usually at least good. Very safe craft
---
I got Rhyssa, the secret paladin legendary. Literally the ONLY legendary I don’t want, I would have taken then rest. Yes, even chef Nomi. Well, maybe not the mech that summons one minion in your deck and gives it rush, he literally sucks unless you spam him into your deck with the rogue Plan card and rogue can’t even get him, sooooo
---
Because why would a company that is already facing troubles, a game that isnt making nearly as much money as it used to and is on the decline (statistically there have been half as many people buying the preorder packs each set) allow people to have a card that gives them 18 decks for practically nothing? The decks arent all that terrible either and each expansion that is released gives more and more value to a one time expenditure. I am completely fine with them basically reprinting whizbang every time it rotates out as a different card completely. What i would like them to do is make the card actually good stat wise or something, because every so often you can manage to get him on the field. Like make him an almost over stat'd big minion so that getting him on field would be more then a novelty (although i think its always a treat to see him pop up on the field as is)
---
I opened 144 packs and got 10 packs. I think changing the grace period to 20 packs rather than 40 would drastically increase pre order numbers. It felt good opening a legendary every 14.4 packs. Maybe even adding a dust bonus for preorders like 1600-3200 dust.
---
lol what? It is having 1 C tier deck for each class for the 2 most recent expansions that cannot be upgraded/changed and the parts cannot be used elsewhere.
---
It is literally a demo designed to get people excited to try a new deck they might have ignored otherwise but encourages them to build their own version with better cards.
---
It is not even close to the majority of the expansion and it is not forever at all. If it was forever tell me how I can play a KnC premade using Whizbang. The decks are useable for 2 expansions and then they rotate out for newer ones.
---
And each time you use him you have a 1 in 18 chance of getting the deck you like.
---
And again, the decks are Tier 2 at absolute best but most are more like Tier 3 or lower and use terrible cards.
---
1 C tier deck for each class per expansion that is only useable for 10 months and you have 0 control over which one you get. Wow, truly replaces the need to ever spend money on the game. Blizz would go under if they did this. Printing functional reprints every couple expansions is a much better option.
---
yeah my first faceless lackey gave me a millhouse  
---
5 star lackey right there, 1 mana 5/5
---
I mean. People have been saying Malygos should be rotated for quite a while now. It was really surprising that he managed to make it through this Hall of Fame Rotation. I havent really lost too much to the Warrior deck yet, but honestly, Quest Rogue, Odd Pally, Aggro Shaman (turn 1 tunnel trogg, turn 2 totem golem), Razakus Priest, Jade Druid, and more all felt like the most annoying decks to play against. At least there are some counters to these decks that you mentioned
---
I just wished there was another way for me to get gold without playing arena. I am pretty decent at arena but I really hate it.
---
well although i dont think that they will make it classic, they should at the least make a similar card when whizbang rotates and keep that trend going. It will make people spend dust to make the new card and keep people investing to get 18 free decks each expansion.
---
Warrior decks usually have a good match up against mage. That being said maged doesn't look like it will bw any good.
---
No.. excluding Whizbang.  An extra 1600 dust to make every deck 100% golden, hell yes!
---
Great resource.  Not only does it have the deck list, but gives a write up about how to play the deck and how to tech it for different match-ups.  I've never used this site for deck ideas, but I'm going to start.
---
I think he's referring to the Kharazan-Heroic-Dungeon, where Medivh appears at the end.

100% worse than cata. Imo worse than wod. I think most people are at that opinion right now. Wod had some good dungeons and raids it was just lacking in content. Bfa issue is all the content is lame and boring

---
Oh so because you don't like the game mode means everyone else doesn't like it?
---
Yeah I used like 6-7k dust to experiment.
---
It will be worse against aggro, but the overall powerlevel should be the same, the thing is..this deck is also built to destroy bomb warrior, a lot of armor again, 3 weapon destruction, replace your deck in case of too many bombs, outvaluing with better generating cards

Weird flex but okay 🙂

Are you even aware of the sort of issues that would bring to the game?
---
Always gruul 
---
Gruul is cuul
---
Yup. Totally autocorrect. Not me. Nope. No sir. I knew what that big word meant.
---
Soft board clear for only 4 mana, too OP /s
---
Yeah, I swapped mana tide and Barista for a second ooze and a second mind control tech.  I also removed the doomsayer for a second 3/3 bounce guy.  Been working much better so far.  Thanks for the feedback.
---
I do think that control shaman will be a top deck when the dust clears.
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.

My bff has been playing it and as ge crafted dr boom he called him dr win so at least hes self aware lol

Let's go with that.

I approve of this dad joke
---
The thing is though, these decks are basically newer versions of what’s been nerfed in the past. Few minor differences, many decks had core elements removed due to their use but now other decks are getting newer elements to break the game again. Personally, I’ve loved hearthstone for many years but this is the first rotation switch/introduction that has made me just not want to play the game for a while.
---
Real reason is that it would be way too fucking strong.
---
I'm a huge scrub who's never made it past rank 13 so when I entered the brawliseum, I expected to go 2-3. Instead, I went 12-2. What a nice surprise!

This is a pretty standard [Tempo Rogue](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/169/tempo-rogue) deck with a few small substitutions. Most notably, I don't have [[Edwin VanCleef]] and I didn't want to craft him just for the sake of this brawliseum. I included two [[Acidic Swamp Ooze]] (whereas many Tempo Rogue decks run one, or even none) due to the expected popularity of [[Waggle Pick]] and [[Wrenchcalibur]] and it seemed to work out fairly well.
---
We didn’t get a Year of The Raven cars back either
---
Replacing your deck or stacking it isn't a viable strategy across all classes (Golden kobold only replaces hand, rafaam does hand and deck) because Rafaam and Togwaggle's scheme/Espionage is limited to warlock and rogue respectively.
---
Archivist is too reliant on RNG (kind of like seeing a snake by your foot and shooting a gun at it, hoping to hit the snake and not your foot) and frankly, would you get rid of the rest of your deck on turn 8 just to get rid of the bombs?

---
Warriors are Hearthstone’s token p2w class. You can expect this going forward.
---
Ome can only hope so. Old school value fatigue matches are way more exciting than race to  OTK meta IMO
---
Yes, I meant dusting. And you're probably right. I get this way every expansion because I just want all the cards and decks.
---
Quest accepted!
---
I'm contemplating replacements for [[Tess Greymane]] which seems to be one of the only flex cards in the deck. I tried [[Harrison Jones]] for a bit and I'm pondering [[Edwin VanCleef]]. Any thoughts?
---
Tess just underperforms in the mirror and a lot of times if you get bad class cards can be very underwhelming for the price. She certainly closes out games but in my experience most of the time she was just clogging my hand.
---
Harrison is decent hate tech for the mirror and to help in the (difficult) matchup against bomb rogue (especially when they upgrade the [[Wrenchcalibur]]) but I'm really bad at drawing my tech cards when I need them -_-
---
VanCleef seems like a good choice to take advantage of the early tempo you gain from your spells...
---
List please?
---
Bomb warrior's pretty expensive, you need both Boom legendaries to complete it.
---
Yes
---
You've seen bomb warrior in the past?
---
Silence priest has been nerfed?

Just tested it out and I got the same bug as you. It crafted a random horror but didn't trigger the last ones battlecry. It does however list the battlecry in the sidebar, so it's definitely unintentional.
---
A U T O  I N C L U D E. Okay, you have to be trolling at this point. The combos you mention aren’t enough to justify putting this into your deck, let alone it being your “go to card” for any warrior.
---
Is Heistbaron worth crafting?
---
Can I get your thoughts on[ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bbahv6/rise_of_shadows_streamer_and_community_decks/eklvdx4/)?
---
It's one of the main themes from the Troll city in Battle for Azeroth. I think it's the Port theme in Zuldazar? Don't quote me on it though, just sounds super familiar.
---
These decks are basically newer versions of what's been nerfed in the past?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When did Murloc shaman get nerfed or was even viable ever? Sure tempo/aggro shaman was a thing, but it didn't play any murloc.
---
Mech warrior was only a thing last expansion and it wasn't too opressive ,I think that OMEGA cards are a bit too strong but nothing you can't deal with.
---
Copy/Buff priest was on and off since forever , it's the core of that class due to Divine Spirit / Inner Fire being in the classic set , and it's considerably weaker now due to the removal of Shadow Visions.
---
No, but they are essentially the same as past decks, that’s what I said. Same exploits, new decks.
---
Still no Tauren Hero. It’s such a shame.
---
This is pretty much a common card in any card game
---
The weapon boosting is definitely enough to win most games. Look for Raiding party off the mulligan, and then Prep, Vedetta, Backstab, and Pilfer. If you can't find those any of the 3 drops do fine.
---
Tess has been... underwhelming to me. Im thinking about cutting her, see my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bbahv6/rise_of_shadows_streamer_and_community_decks/eklvdx4/)

\*not my list\*
---
It works pretty well, i went 4-1 with it tonight. Strongly recommend if you have the dust. You can pull off a lot of cool combos with it
---
Nice
---
I have a similar list without hagatha or flametongue. But I've got all the cards. Nice! Thanks!
---
I agree about the omega cards, but the mech I’m referring to is mech/bomb warrior. Murloc shaman wasn’t viable due to each class having at least some type of board removal, now since majority of control rotated out and the addition of the new murlocs it’s completely made murlocs broken. Copy/buff is a give and take but is still just as bad. The hall of famed multiple classes core cards due to over use and in my opinion should have done the same with divine spirit/inner fire
---
Sure you can not use your brain to play but you're gonna have way lower winrate than if you do use it to keep track of the cards, measure the odds of your opponents having a boardclear or drawing one and other small decision making that requires at least a small amount of brain usage.
---
It's better that allot of the other legendaries
---
I'm only rank 6 currently with my Dragon Handmage, but so far as long as you can get board control, they have a lot of trouble coming back. You need to play more tempo and less value with them.
---
The Hagatha versions might last longer, but it also gives you the board when they play her.
---
What is Wallet Control Shaman and is there a Wild version around?
---
I think that one of the things you have to understand is that Hearthstone is not, and does not want to be, a completionist friendly game. The reason is simple: not having all the cards really doesn't effect the experience of an average player much outside of maybe the first week of an expansion where, as you've said, the meta is shifting and you have to experiment. Meanwhile, there are quite a few people who are "whales" and have no problem dropping several hundred dollars each expansion to get all the cards. Those are the people who Blizzard really wants to profit off of.
---
IMO, according to simple economics/common sense, if there are people willing to spend 1k+ on a game, they're the only ones who are going to get the full experience, because it needs to be worth it for them somehow. Which means that if you pay less than that, you won't get the full experience. And that is actually fair IMO, because it speaks to the quality of a game if people are willing to drop thousands of dollars on it. Which they do.
---
It's valid but then there is wild and the simple action of hovering over cards that explains keywords. But you sure hit the nail in the coffin that the Hearthstone team is inconsistent.
---
I got both rogue legendaries. Togwaggle is gold too :| he jiggles lol.
---
Can I see the decklist? I run madame lazul in mine
---
the pool is small atm, same for dragons for dragon roar
---
BY MY BEARD!
---
C'thun War was played competitively at some point.
---
Both are bad
---
To be faaaaaaair
---
what about rush
---
Oh ok I didn’t know that, I thought it was just what is in “standard”.
---
Well first of I got Keeper Stalladris as the legendary you get for logging in. Then i had 62 packs i opened, where i got Golden Joybozz, Lazul and Rhyssa
---
Khadgar as khadgar, medivh as medivh, dr. Boom as dr. Boom, Madame lazul as Madame lazul,
---
Blown away Murloc Shaman is even meta now that they sacked 'Unite the Murlocs'
---
What rank is this? Because my matches at rank 5+ has seriously been 50% bomb warrior. You can't get in range without investing in a board, but then you play right into board clear. 
---
Even 1 mana they mulligan to have eternium rover, and you can't kill that without overloading and usually giving them 4 armor. There's no 3 attack murlocs that are playable even with coin. And if you can't pull ahead on board on turn 1 as aggro/midrange then your chances of winning have dropped significantly.
---
I'm genuinely curious about how your games go that murloc shaman is favored against bomb warrior. Because I'm watching all my replays and it seems like the only way bomb warrior can tech harder against murlocs is to include Hungry Crabs, and I've actually played against a warrior that did.
---
Got golden Onyxia some time ago) never played tho
---
Hey guys! This guy^ plays bomb warrior! Get him!
---
With taunt. After they die, you can ress them as big lucents again
---
Explain what it is about your deck that beats the bombs.
---
58 packs, 4 legendaries
---
Jepetto, lazul, hagatha, and fel lord betrug
---
Pretty standard pull I guess
---
Last expansions, I didn't wait any time to craft my cards because 75% of the decks were OTK and I only like the remaining decks (rogue thief, baku warrior or Shudder Shaman), at least this year and expansion didn't come with 1231201391203 decks with otk, since they are either Mcthun or Malygos. I think i am going to wait until a good deck rises,  that is as strong as funny to play.
---
Yesterday i found a mage deck using Jan'alai, khadgar, mountain giant and conjurer's calling, and I really like it. It's like [this one](https://hsreplay.net/decks/sJVvCaQY877u0rzu3Ocfjd/) but changing kalecgos with Alexstrasza
---
It was pretty good against warrior before, since it was a slow deck.
---
Now?  You’d have to tank all the bombs before he’d be active.  That’s a lot of damage to heal through and then still find a way to kill your mechathun.  
---
Bomb warrior puts you on much more of a clock than odd warrior did.
---
Stop defending this game / team. Just admit the game is bad.
---
Like the moment you stop allowing them to continue making bad game because you're addicted. Is the moment we can actually get a good team hired.
---
I added you, my name is IliasX#2566
---
Three warriors, three losses. What a fucking blast!
---
That’s what I’m doing. Climbed from rank 10 0 stars to 1 win away from 5 in 1 day. And I went 9 wins in the brawl with the same deck.
---
What rank are you?
---
Did it get cast by Saboteurs Battlecry?
---
Aggro secret mage still kicks pretty hard, got beat by a few of those earlier.  I tend to stick with Casino Mage myself, usually a Quest-Reno version. Vargoth really helps turn the quest into a win condition when you get it off with Vargoth. Even a dinky board can swing into lethal that way.
---
I’m playing trump’s value shaman which is similar to your list. Elysiana is a life saver for dealing with bomb warrior. Games against pure control warrior can list up to 40 minutes since both run Elysiana. The shaman usually loses to all that sudo removal but Hagatha can cheese wins occasionally
---
I opened Catrina, so I guess I'm gonna be a rez priest trash now. Thanks for the recommendation.
---
New expansion just hit meta is constantly changing we get new decks every hour. Class Win rates on hsreplay  change in blink of an eye , so its to early to tell yes right now mage seems weak but who knows maybe someone crafts good magedeck with 60% winrate we need to wate at least 1-2 weaks before speaking about meta.
---
I did haha I got back about 5k? But 19 nett seems abit extreme
---
The xpac just came out yesterday an I'm already so tired of all the bomb warriors.
---
No thank you. While I get why that appeals to you, it would just be sucky for the opponent. It also just makes more sense the way it works now, the upgraded version isn't a new card, it's the same card that's fulfilled it's conditions.
---
Rogue have always less winrate because is hard to play and a lot of people who is not using it well decrease the winrate
---
Don't have a replay, was on mobile.  100% on standard.  He was the only one I got out of 5 (others were classic or last year).  I even couldn't activate him immediately because I had another 3 cost in my deck, which turned out to be the Paladin legendary that activates secrets twice.  Been playing regularly since beta, so I know what I saw -- I Just wasn't sure if wild cards were allowed or if it was just one card that's bugged.
---
A new feauture in Hurtstone???
---
*Laughs in Ben Brode*
---
I was literally just playing against a Murloc Shaman, got Rain of Toads+Lightning Storm. I don't think I've clicked on a discover option faster in my Hearthstone career.
---
Sadly reminds me of the days of the Golden Monkey where it mostly came down to who rolled better legendaries from it.
---
A practice mode would be nice. Craft multiple decks with all available cards. Set one deck as the AI deck, and one as yours. Then play and test before you purchase or craft cards to play against real people in play mode. Give a deck dust calculator that let's you bulk-craft your chosen deck to fill in the cards you are missing if you have the dust. Include tools that let you rewind (undo) and fast forward matches, choose starting player, make both hands visible, stack opening hands, track stats, etc. They could even use a wireframe style table like they do in fighting game practice modes.
---
Isn't that pretty good? That is about one per 15 packs
---
True but as long as burgle rogue is around, no one would want to bring Jaraxxas out of hiding because losing that game because of that interaction would just create a bad feeling. 
---
Again, i agree that that be an even rarer instance, that you happened to go against a rogue, who happened to be the burgle archtype, who happened to get sac pac. 
---
But that just puts me on tilt more, knowing it was rare but happened anyway. 
---
Its not a bad interaction per say, but does stop Jaraxxas coming back (especially now that guldan has rotated. )
---
10
---
Yep, your right but i don't remember what the card was called
---
My friend is 4 and he has been experiencing the same thing
---
Are you sure it wasn't from a Toki you got from Rafaam?
---
Ok weird because I climbed from 10 to 5 in a day and I saw maybe 5 or 6 warriors.
---
Yes! Ive played primarily bomb warrior. I played a little bit of silence priest here and there, but mostly bomb warrior. Ive found that warriors are really fun match ups as it depends on who makes the right moves towards later and Ive had hard matches with druids. Ive lost to token druids more than ive won against them.
---
Oh, you're right.  Sorry!
---
I used to think rank 5 was so high until I got there myself. Really opens your eyes though to how much skill is a factor in HS and luck is more on the sidelines. Luck still matters but so many games I lose I can look back and see that if I played that better or didn't make that mistake or planned better for him having X card which I thought he had but I gambled against him having it etc.
---
I don't quite understand how you can only open so few packs with preordering the 50 bundle. You should be able to save up at least about 7000 gold from daily quests per expansion. Add the free packs you receive from other events.
---
Also, if you want to farm gold, do arena. With some skill and practice, that gives you more than enough gold. And then you can still dust your dupes, which you will definitely have after opening more than 120 packs.
---
I'm not saying their business model is good, or even OK, but your post seems to exaggerate quite a bit. Also, 3x50 != 200.
---
Anyway some decks like murloc shaman or hunter midrange doest use hero cards
---
Thats the problem. Its not people don't WANT to experiment. You just have a limited number of experiments before the wallet is needed.
---
Thanks for clearing things up on Toki.  Was mostly asleep and even now I forgot I played him until you specifically mentioned it lol.
---
wait a few weeks.
---
There isn't one of these strong neutral late game legendary drops anymore for new players to work towards crafting, is there?  It use to be Rag or Sylvannas, then after they were both eventually HoF we had an expansion without before the Lich King was released and filled the role.
---
Yeah bomb vs bomb are the best matches. It’s really skill testing and fun. 
---
If you leave the bombs in for too long you might screw your self. But if your remove them too early you’re also fucked. Gotta find the perfect time to do it.
---
True, although you would have had to play Millhouse already, so either their spells are already free, or they just used all their spells on you last turn. Or if it's the very last card in your hand and deck, and your opponent has absolutely nothing left, and they're just barely beating you in fatigue, it could win you the game. Floop Blademaster cannot.
---
5g.. 🙂
---
Is it me or are the new Whizbang decks just not a lot of fun to play?
---
I think another problem is the dr boom hero card. When all the DKs were around Dr boom was OK but not great.
---
Now that it's just him, zuljin and hagatha, and the power level of cards has dropped significantly with the rotation, Dr Boom is crazy strong in comparison to what's left in standard.
---
That's a lot of dust but I genuinely hope that you don't regret getting rid of all those cards.
---
At least a month I would say unless you find a deck's idea fun and just want to play it.
---

Someone out there is willing to drop thousands on literally anything. A farmville where you grow boogers inside a giant nose? There's going to be a whale willing to buy thousands of gems to fill their noise with golden boogers. It really doesn't say much, if anything, about the quality of the game, but mostly about the psychology of addiction and unhealthy relationships with games intentionally designed as Skinner boxes to compel you to part with your money (also, most whales are not rich people spending their cash however they see fit because they can afford it -- much more often, it's people who by any reasonable measure should not be spending this much money in a game, but they can't help themselves)

I love Allie. I want her to do the next reveal stream.

You could literally take a starter deck from 50 to 15 but congrats regardless!
---
Goldmine is fine, you still have to dig and work through mud for the gold.
---
But that's the refund, not the profit. You get your investment back, and then you get 1600 per golden legendary

You forgot Loatheb.
---
No prob! I'd wait until the meta has settled, 3.2k dust isn't easy to get
---
Unfortunately I am just getting back into MtG after having collected a couple thousand cards in the early 2000s (had no one to play with). But magic does reprint cards so that might be a factor? I don't know HS ecpansion realeses usually slow the meta in my experience since everyone experiments and a lot of whacky combos and drawn out gameplans like bomb warrior are tested.
---
.. which is why welfare systems exist and make sense. They don't make the poor wealthy, but they help them have at least a chance at investing sth.
---
The real question is why anyone should care about that?
---
They also changed arena mode to wild for the first part of the expansion, so you had a lower chance of playing with the new cards unless you bought packs.
---
You’ve got a deathwish if you wanna play subpar standard decks in wild
---
I "watched" a kripp one once. It helps me fall asleep. Just got to be careful you fall asleep before the end. If you are just nodding off as the music starts everything is ruined.
---
Then very least would be being able to make practice decks which can contain any card, but can only be used against the innkeeper or a friend.
---
At least that would give you an idea if the basic concept is sound or not.
---
Awesome.
---
Do u have any idea what to do with the rush warlock leg? I got it instead of rafaam feels bad lol. I like warlock but never had the critical cards for anything but zoo last uh season/cycle/year)? Lol

Good point, thinking about it my Imp Rally deck can essentially be played with 0 legendaries and 2 epics.
---
It's like leaving the radio on for a pet.
---
Oh YES!
---
Well i was looking forward to playing chef nomi rogue but i guess i gotta play more rafaam warlock
---
LOL :)
---
That's ok if they don't want to use it again. But this is literally the same effect, it's nothing now or fresh. It makes sense to use the keyword if you want to use the effect
---
I just play whizzbang. Have had some good luck so far with the new decks. Especially murloc shaman from whizzbang.
---
This is soo cute!!
---
Yea you can, played against a warlock earlier, and i thought i had him, then he pulls Talanji after i used my brawl. Had to concede :(

Yes indeed, that's the dust back. But i only specifically crafted golden genn/baku and the doomguards so the dust from the golden epics 'was' all profit in my eyes at least. I already had the gloomstags/glitter moths etc in golden from opening them via packs and epic rewards. In terms of 'making profit' it was probably about 7k of dust.
---
Thats one reason not to dust anything until rotations, you don't know whats going to HOFed, and it gives you a big dust bank for crafting.
---
That's the reason i went to craft my first golden legendary ever, Whizbang. I don't care about gold cards too much but this is good value, 9 golden decks to start the next few expansions with for the cost of 3200 dust.
---
A guy just doing his job?
---
Went 0-3 with two times healing druid and one time treant druid :/
---
Hover over the card and you get the text for the keyword
---
True, it's not that I hate aggro or anything, it's healthy but these aggro decks become just so predictably stale to play against.
---
At least that *super interactive* secret mage deck isn't around anymore.
---
As a Bomb Warrior player, I can neither confirm nor deny this statement.
---
Upvote. Lol.
---
I'm doing all my quests in ranked too. It's not the end of the world if you lose a few stars while doing it, especially on a close to ceiling ranks. But if you win  somehow - it counts towards your golden portrait progress. That's my reasoning tho. However, the guy already have a golden hero so he probably just don't really care. 
---
People are too serious about losing in hearthstone for some reason. It's all about having fun after all :)
---
I've noticed it a lot since the expansion hit. I'd say I lost 4-5 games yesterday because of it.
---
Lmao no. I dare u to do that. Rank 18 and 17 were a lot harder than rank 15. I mean a lot. Fighting decks like resurrect priest, murloc shamans, deathrattle hunters, thief rogues and the like with starter decks is impossible.
---
oh I didn't realize they came back as 4/8s
---
Got two more in the previous games. Both games pick pocket disappointed me.
---
Just play all those weapons and go for dk then tess will give you cutlass back and might even buff it
---
Does Tirion have a unique voice line if you play it when The Lich King is on the board?
---
Whizbang probably hurt Blizzard's sales tbh.
---
From about Boomsday sales figures dropped heavily. 
---
TBH this expansion hasnt excited me at all, all the cards looked boring and uninspired and there is SOOOO much filler and basically reprints its scary.
---
Also balance seems completely off. 
---
Warrior and Rogue get crazy strong tools and Druid gets nothing but a worse fandral after losing its powerful tools post heavy nerfs to its core set.

Imagining a game show now where literally don't have to do anything to win. It just has a charismatic host that talks about stuff and every now and then a random audience member wins something. The prizes would be based on card packs rarity so most prizes are small "common" prizes like a gift card maybe with a sliding scale going to golden legendary winning a Bentley or something. Haha. I'd watch this.
---
Don't you have a shit ton of dust then? Just spend some dust to be able to play some decks.
---
Ahh, thanks for the deck intro! I'm still on that path of owning all Classic legendaries like Alexstrasza. But no matter! I have a hunch the cards Khadgar and Conjurer's Calling will fit into the deck's theory crafting for expansions to come, I have neither so the yearning is there D:
---
I'm only being more active this time round because it was rotation year and would bound to be *waayyyy* more interesting than past expansions from Witchwood to Rastakhan. But I will say OTK decks are fun when you're able to pull it off over and over like when Mecha'thun hit but it after that, the norm of Odd and Even decks unknowingly took the fun out of HS I will admit.
---
I got so bored I crafted Genn because I had **too** much odd plays with all the classes! But yeah I'm pretty much like you, stuck around for the fun and not too much over the competitive side of the game.
---
Just saw firebat's [Shuffle Warlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsYy3fEJlXk) today and got me real pumped again, enjoy!
---
I got [[Mechanical Whelp]] from [[Power of Creation]]. Next turn played Conjurer's Calling twice. That was pretty effective.
---
It's not justified though. We all know the probability of opening legendary cards. If you want more spend money.
---
Would it be worth playing without swamp queen? Not ready ti part with my dust yet
---
But that means queing into big priest and praying they dont have barnes on turn 4

From what I've experienced playing Boom Reaver since RNG saw fit to give me a golden one, probably Boom Reaver. It feels really bad to play and requires some seriously bad deck building restrictions to get enough value off it to justify running it.
---
Lol I forgot about Zul’jin. Not so good without Spellstone/ TMS
---
Used [[Togwaggle’s Scheme]] with [[Tak Nozwhisker]] to shuffle 8 [[Pogo-Hopper]]s into my hand. Loving Pogo Rogue this expansion so far. It’s mostly still terrible, but so fun.
---
I disagree. I can take my meta decks into casual anytime I want and dominate yet I never do. Why? Beucause the lure of ranked and doing well and earning prizes gets me there.  
---
I imagine, bots aside, ranked is far more popular than casual.  
---
All this would be is a free play mode with no ability to earn anything so you could truly play for free if you like but if you want to take part in the competitive aspect, you spend money ideally.    
---
In the end it's just an idea, they won't do anything as long as people support this current business model as they just dont need to.  
---
No new game modes, get used to it because pre-orders sell.

Works on blood, but I've seen it happen, 10 card hand drew bomb and boom, it could be a bug but atm it doesn't work.
---
That's wild! (On lunara voice)
---
If it turns out to be the deck to beat, it will just increase the amount of players playing direct counters. Token Druid farms Bomb Warrior. The top 20 Legend players that I have seen were almost exclusively playing Rogue. Bomb Warrior is good, but overrated, it's not the unbeatable monster that people make it out to be.
---
epic
---
True
---
i've never lost against them even if they get extreme highrolls, but thats because i run a stupid off-meta deck

What has Blizzard done over the years to the HS client? We still can't hover over affixes and see what they do. Have to go to a website for that information. Even Shadowverse (mobile client btw) has every single bit of information about tokens and affixes about cards/effects.
---
No. Iron Juggernaut shuffles mines, not bombs.
---
Free legendaruies started with weapon/DKs expansions because people complained they couldn't play Quest cards when they were released, as f2p players. 
---
So since there's no such key class specific feature this time, they decided not to do it.
---
Those were both my first instinct that would weaken it without destroying it. Having access to the death knight is also such a powerhouse
---
Or at least post in his thread - he will be delighted. Keep us posted!
---
Why are you so triggered man lol
---
High five!  I spent some in Witchwood and KNC, mostly because Dungeon Run was so awesome and did I mention FREE.  When I get a generous amount of free stuff, I feel bad if I don't spend.
---
Then Boomsday came, the cards didn't interest me much and the meta didn't change at all so I didn't spend then.  Towards the end of Boomsday they announced that "in the works" they had basically nothing going on.
---
Then RKR came, the preorder got worse, we got rehashed Dungeon Run for the third time instead of anything new or interesting, still no new game modes.
---
Then we come to this expansion.  The PvE isn't free anymore.  Whizbang is locked behind a paywall.  The bonus packs are skeezy (why give packs from last year? makes no sense except from a finance perspective).  No new Hero portrait.
---
So yeah, I don't see why I should give them money when their concern for my play experience clearly stops at my wallet.
---
Yea. I agree its likly bugged. I'll see if I can make a custom game with a mate and replicate it with video.
---
The funny kicker was the card that gets drawn after the trigger got dusted as overdraw as well, salt in the wound.
---
Haha that's epic!
---
Fuck on
---
Bomb Warrior is very popular right now and Token Druid farms it. Pretty cheap deck, very easy to play, relatively quick matches. People will play it a lot to climb ladder.
---
As someone who unpacked Scourgelord at the start of KOFT, we deserve a good hero card
---
You played brawl for 9 hours straight today?
---
!!! Where is it? I grew up in Northumberland
---
Pasha from csgo is one
---
I felt extra risky on launch day and crafted both Hagathas and [[Archivist Elysiana]] golden. no regret
---
F2P opened only 13 packs. :/ where's my gold :/

8/7/7 | Battlecry: Discover 5 cards. Replace your deck with 2 copies of each.  
---
The druids I came up against didn’t even stress me although the rogue match ups were harder, kibler has a  control shaman list he believes can challenge it but I haven’t tested against it yet
---
Discover a spell, if you have no spells in hand, keep all three of it.
---
I've been playing a variation of it, cause I also got blast master 
---
I have found the paladin healing deck can cause some issues, but yeah it is strong.
---
In saying that, last expansion, shuddrrwock was quite strong and then counters were found
---
One of the problems with the "high winrate for the best players" evidence is that Artifact's matchmaking is notoriously terrible. People picking up the game for the first time often reported that their first games were against level 70+ players running top tier decks. The pro who was especially proud of that statistic had about the same sort of winrate that HS pros do when he was pitted against other top players in tournaments instead of just anyone from the HS equivalent of rank 50 to legend. I mean, my winrate was incredibly good in HS when I came back and started at rank 25.
---
I think Paladin is obvious too, Dragon paladin obviously is a joke and secret Paladin just doesn't have enough support.
---
Mage I feel like has a very good deck, but it's like 12000 dust or so and most people won't have the cards to play it, so you the stats will probably reflect tempo mage which indeed is crap.
---
8-2 so far in rank 8-6.
---
Correction: Only your opponent gets Talanji.
---
I should have said yesterday, played one before class and two after last night. Wrote most of this before bed
---
Lol there was a pic ov the druids view earler.
---
Doubt that we would see any more variation. People (me included) netdeck because it is easy, quick and gives you a much more usable deck than the average player can throw together themselves. Getting the whole set quicker would merely mean you can put together the top player deck recipes earlier.
---
Experimenting is fun, but if you want to win and climb the ranked ladder, you will want a functioning deck with a good winrate. And those decks emerge after experimentation of top level players.
---
At least you have another way to kill yourself
---
I would not nerf it at all. It's not as strong as it seems right now. The meta will adjust to it and it just loses to every control deck with healing. The bombs are unreliable, the dmg comes in small incrementals and you can't use the deck to force your opponent to draw a fuckton of them, like druid did with Hakkar.
---
The strong part of it is the control aspect of the old cards, not the bomb thing.
---
I've been playing mono-removal Hunter with Zuljin.  As long as I don't draw spectacularly poorly, pure aggro gets stuffed.
---
Zilliax is the most powerful neutral in the game probably. There hasn’t been a single meta where he wasn’t played since Boomsday.
---
3 minutes really. The first 2 minutes she's not even doing it and then the next 4 she does mess around a bit with talking to her stream so subtract a minute there.
---
/r/tworedditorsonecup (SFW)
---
Waggle Pick. Jesus Christ that pick hurts.
---
eh it gets wrecked by certain decks, i have been crushing it with a control shaman deck. I believe I am 10-1 against it. Let the fishy's have their day in the sun.
---
It is really good. sadly the Mage is still shit. So hard to survive anything.
---
Imo, currently scraphound is more of a tech card while hoarder is more all-around simply because of the lack of solid draw in warrior.
---
Scraphound does wonders against agro and zoo, especially if you magnetize it or hit it with sweeping strikes and can swing with it. One of my favorite things so far is scrap into zilliax into sweeping strikes against an agro board. Heal for 15, gain 15 armor, kill 3 minions and have a 5/4 taunt left.
---
Even on turn 2, dropping a scraphound isnt horrible since your opponent will want it gone pretty quick as it can get out of control. They either spend a removal card (either damage or hard removal) or you can hit at least one dude and get the 2 armor.
---
Can i trust your SFW mark? :\
---
I assume they mean ice barrier
---
What is this? A crossover episode?
---
My friend has a deck that's really good vs wild ress priest. He was telling me about it last Sunday. It's a Quest-Reno deck. Like the greediest thing you can think of. He LOVES to use the cards that generate value. Turns out unbelievably greedy priest is good vs ress.
---
Small spell mage is fun and winable. Just awfull becaus it's draw depended and RNG depended.
---
Also, the 4 mana 1/6 gain +1 for each spell in your hand has big potential. It's not 4 mana 7/7. But 6/6 aint bad eather.
---
Same.
---
Bringing friends into the Game is almost impossible. I got one friend who plays it with me because for 9 month we each day played against each other (so he can Finish his quest instead of playing netdeck Simulator ... sry casual for hours with his bad cards). Then He was able to play at an 'ok' level.
---
The Brawl this week also feels Like: Show what you got from the pre-order vs. You really wanna stay f2p?
---
And yes the things we get for free or at least at a discounted price. The hero Portraits, golden legendaries, class legendaries, free packs of the most recent sets. The 'bundles' are not interessting. Sir Annoy-o was bad. The mammoth bundle was only 'ok' for wild players.
---
Thanks for the response. Right now I only have 1 mage deck and 3k dust. So Ill wait till the meta settles and see what can I do
---
Such a slap in the face that we get a centaur champion before any these great picks
---
Thanks for the reply. I have been getting exploded by every bomb warrior!
---
thank you!!!
---
*kills a one health minion*
---
I disagree the contents fine. The leveling is the most bored I've ever been leveling characters, island expeditions are literally the most boring thing I've ever done in the game, most of the dungeons are meh, and the raids so far have been meh. There's been a few cool fights here and there but that's really it. 
---
Also to your point, classes are garbage right now which could've contributed to leveling being awful. Every single class is a build up to a big button. They did that because it's easy af to grasp the concept and  easier to balance but god damn is it boring. Why does my monk and my warlock player the same...
---
If it's ok, I want you guys to help me sharing this on twitter  [https://twitter.com/Hudinart/status/1116158887781126144](https://twitter.com/Hudinart/status/1116158887781126144)
---
There are two variants of Control Shaman right now. One is the Big Shaman that you linked and the other one is an Overload control Shaman. I believe the Overload control is the one that’s performing better
---
The current top zoo list heats bomb warrior consistantly because of rafaam turning bombs into legendaries.
---
Got it! Thanks!
---
Friend of mine got 3 from ~100. Ridiculous how you can spend 80$ plus gold and still end up with basically nothing.
---
I don't see what's wrong with this. He just played Mukla and molten reflection twice.
---
Docnoq#1306 trading 80g quest on NA
---
Can you give list
---
Except that for the K.O. And reward system brawliseum is nothing like arena. Nor is it mentioned anywhere.
---
So you're kind of right. You can't just mix up completely different things and make it an argument.
---
Stop asking questions
---
Yep that is the harsh reality of HS, don't put money in it.
---
I play since launch, spent money on adventure, and the pre-order of witchwood all.
---
Until I get that I will never enjoy the full game as it's too expensive for me, so just play this game as it should be, don't try hard don't even care about the meta spend your dust as it will give you fun and no otherwise. I don't even try to go above rank 15 most of the time. 
---
Since few month this game became a money grab more than ever, i will keep playing casually until I've spent my dust then I will just keep coming back for arena and sometimes wild
---
I reckon because Rafaam's effect isn't guaranteed nor free.
---
Also Mage lost it's most important card for tempo Mage: **Mana Wyrm**
---
Without it it's almost as if Mage lost the whole archetype.
---
I guess warlock has just too mana trap decks because Zoo is still mighty fine.
---
Can you add both to a deck and play it?
---
Don't forget, magnetize Missile Launcher to him.  All those missiles will also gain you 1 armor.  One of the sleeper combo of the set and does decent board control too!
---
I’m just gonna wait for the wild meta to settle and craft the most busted OP wild deck I can.
---
Right now Blizzard has troubles with keeping 9 class in relative balance. Adding 10th is going to totally mix things up. However, I'd love to see more sub-classes, like Tracker, Cannoneer, Time-Tinker and Houndmaster.
---
The rotation happened. We're done with shitposting here.
---
But great news, there's r/hearthstonecirclejerk and they will love this!
---
I mean I dont have any decks that use him due to the only one I've seen that isnt a meme version is priest and I dont have velen.
---
Add a mech crab, reduce bomb damage to 4, hall of fame all hero cards.
---
It's insane how now some classes are literally superior just because they get infinite value from their hero cards.
---
You can't open Zayle in packs (this expansion's Whizbang), idk if you can craft it yet, and the only way to get a golden one is by buying all of the PvE content.
---
Here's a bunch of other decks with 60%+ winrate, are you suggesting we nerf these too?
---

Zoo Warlock: https://hsreplay.net/decks/zBIJy80UbyGGAPvK2OAhsd/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD
---
Someone do the math. BE OUR HERO!!
---
Yeah but I want to make a deck only to be able to actually play and compete  a bit I dont need it to get to legend and stuff it's just that because of the rotation I dont have any playable decks and my friend that I'm competing with(friendly rivalry ) and he already made his deck a silence priest
---
Only having one legendary per class really didn't make the game any cheaper since Team 5 has thankfully made both legendary designs a class receives best played in different decks. For example, Aluneth would never see play in a deck alongside Dragon Caller Alanna, and Blastmaser Boom is not seeing play alongside The Boom Reaver. Plus, more class legendary cards results in more potentially playable legendary cards, so fewer people are spurned when the day one legendary pulls are Gonzo the Shark, Madam Goya, and two or three of the other forgettable designs from MSoG.
---
However, I can agree that it has gotten a bit more dust intensive to build decks, but that is due to the improved quality of Epic cards over time. Good decks can still be built with none or just one legendary card.
---
Adventures also really sucked for players jumping into the game. If a new player just wanted to play Tempo Mage during Blackrock Mountain format, the only card from that set the deck needed was Flamewaker, but they still had to purchase at least three wings of that adventure just to get that the one card. The old style of solo content was at best a trade-off and really only good for enfranchised players.
---
When Whispers of the Old Gods was released, they only handed out fifteen packs. This time around, it is only twelve over the course of five days, but that still is pretty comparable.
---
Token just wins against unoptimised decks. Just like all aggro. This explains the entire list and the winrates, except warrior which is, for me, easily the strongest class overall at the moment.
---
*insert frustraded meme*
---
Lol this is me last season. Play with netdeck to rank 5 then play that sweet fun TessRogue or pohohopper. Sometimes i even conceded when I have lethal or my opponent already fell way behind me if they got lower rank than me.
---
What a perfect quote and clip title.
---
Now that I think about it, no reason a villain can’t have more than one kind of Lackey.
---
Play as bomb warrior.  Then it becomes a long game of flipping a coin.
---
This is the reason i am mainly playing Control Shaman, it destroys murlocs as well.
---
"You're a big **priest**"
---
Reddit: Genn and Baku are bad!
---
Also Reddit: It's bad that there're no Genn and Baku!
---
I mean, it also gave you a 4/6 body which is nothing to scoff at. Conjurer's calling makes up for it by being cheaper (more combo-able), twinspell (two activations in one), and activating itself as opposed to play dead/dark pact
---
Uh yeah you should've crafted it a long time ago
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
That's freaking cool I have those 3 I'll try to create a deck just like that.
---
*should have
---
^I'm ^sorry
---
You every just casually summon 4 hoggers
---
Handlock feels pretty good against the control bomb warriors out there (Rafaam ftw) but I still have a tough time against the aggro variants. I'm sure something will come around eventually. For now I'm just going to play bomb warrior myself because honestly it's so fun lol.
---
That pack has only rare cards
---
Ahh, gotcha. Yea that's whack. I basically play 90% Whizbang ranked, and about 10% wild Renounce Darkness so that's crummy that Zayle is locked. I'll have to see him and determine if it's worth it or not.
---
I spend maybe 30 bucks a year. I just save gold and usually have 50-60 packs on launch. Only gets 2-3 legendaries which sucks
---
but as a class, warrior is too strong now
---
lol you're just flat out wrong. Waggle Pick is one of the strongest cards in one of the best decks in the game
---
https://hsreplay.net/decks/KVgWE2lEbRDLZXWcIpnXz/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD
---
That deck has a 62.3% winrate, which is insane. Sort of drawn winrate and you'll see Waggle Pick is one of the most impactful cards in the decklist. It is extremely powerful, and the stats back that assertion up.
---
So the team planted the idea in our heads?
---
Is that hsreplay premium?
---
And Malygos not being Malygos.
---
Team 5 is not doing anything unusual when it comes to handling Hearthstone's eternal format. You may not like how broken it seems everything is in Wild, but when every card is legal, busted combinations are going to be discovered. 
---
The ultimate saving grace of it all though is that everything considered competitive there is pretty much just as broken as everything else. Even then, anything reasonable goes up until rank ten.
---
It's not a solution for your ills because you won't let it be.
---
No, anyone can look this data up without paying or signing up for anything
---
Doing a quest.
---
They are probably the strongest class at the moment but that doesn't mean they need nerfed. You can't just nerf a class because they're the strongest, because there will always be a strongest class in an asymmetrical game.
---
Just keep a full hand, you will mill ALL the bombs.
---
You could use the deck sharing feature
---
Yeah it's doing pretty well, probably 10-3 or something like that. I tried putting Hakkar in it too because I have him, but it ends up messing with Reno and killing yourself. But here's the deck, you can take him out: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/renowock-2/
---
Yeh I know, it's just good to filter by ranks 4-legend, as lower rank data usually skews the stats.
---
wait for the decksperiments to end,and see what goes and what doesnt
---
I know, but the image fit the theme somehow.
---
About any CCG/TCG has a "Wild" variant. I mean, what do you expect them to do with rotated cards? Refund the dust cost of the all cards? That'd probably be on the fast-track of killing HS. Despite Big Priest in Wild, I find it enjoyable. And Wild is only "dead" if you believe it is.
---
Only played 4 games as priest against it so very small sample size but I'm 2/2 with a divine spirit innerfire deck I made and it doesn't seem like a completely losing match-up for me. What priest deck are you playing?
---
Dam, the Kabal aren't looking good.
---
I dont think you can compare an unranked mode with the same limited card selection as what's available to you if you play Ranked, to an unranked mode where literally every card is available.
---
Again, I'm not saying there aren't people who would invest in cards because they enjoy the competitive game. But I think you're seriously underestimating how much of the playerbase is extremely casual and the only reason they play Ranked is because there isn't another mode worth playing. Theres not really an incentive to play casual over ranked, it doesn't really change much in terms of gameplay experience, other than the fact that people aren't try-harding as much. But it becomes a completely different story when casual let's you play with all the cards without ever spending a penny.
---
I spent a lot of money in the first couple of years after it came out, just because I wanted to be able to play with most of the cards. I have never cared about ladder...I've only ever gotten above rank 10 twice and it was always in one or two days because I just happened to get a good win streak with a good deck right at the end of the month. Otherwise, I've spent loads of time around rank 20 because some months I only played enough just to get the card back. I can assure you that were the mode you suggested an option, I probably would have never spent much if anything at all on the game. Multiply that by millions of extremely casual players just like myself, and those are pretty big losses for Blizzard....and for what? Theres no way enough people value Ranked hearthstone so much that getting to play with cards for free would drive the sales necessary to offset the losses. It's a total pipe dream.
---
Fair enough, and I agree. I was just making a point to the guy who posted this
---
It's a solid deck.  Haven't found it really frustrating though tbh.  It's a slow deck so you can go greedy against it with all these decks that just pour value out everywhere.  
---
I like it myself.  It's a deck that can beat aggro but plays a slower game so I'm able to actually play the cards in my deck which is something you can't do against aggro metas.  So meh.  I'll take it over aggro anyday.
---
The bomb deck is got and all but the real E.V.I.L. in that deck is the hero card. Its just soo strong and synergises so well with the deck. The infinite value is yet again a problem.
---
Bomb Warrior is weak to aggressive decks, especially the ones that flood the board with sticky minions. Unfortunately, priest does not have such a deck as far as I know.
---
For example, Mech deathrattle Hunter does very well against them, because they cannot use dyn-o-matic to their advantage and when they use Brawl, there will still be minions after that due to the deathrattles.
---
But that's a rogue card? they can't be played together. Unless the rogue deck ran cauldron and got lucky to draw witch's brew
---
I just saw a video where it worked fine. With one targeted spell and the 7 mana make every minion a random legendary.
---
Is anybody else surprised by Hunter? Both of their legendaries looked like memes, but they're putting up great winrates.
---
That’s a smart plan. Good luck!
---
Have an upvote, polite people in this sub are a minority.
---
I never said it was ranked
---
I used it to play around with OTK Hunter because why not. I usually try to play the shit out of Tavern Brawl every week to try and maximize my goal.
---
[Let's just be real here, too much of their player base is shit at the game to really succeed in this tavern brawl. Let alone make a profit.](https://i.imgur.com/AYuRnA9.jpg)
---
Now you REALLY see how they messed up the arts
---
Just cast Eye for Eye, ezpz
---
Shudderwock was creating 10minute cast sequence... noone on earth wants to sit through that... first match I saw it start I conceded. Thereafter i conceded just to get away from stupid long cast time.

Title : Worst meta in the life of HS?
---
Post: I have no money.
---
Jaraxxus.
---
- Drew deck + doomsayer for a clear board.
---
- Played Nomi + togwaggle scheme for 15.
---
- prep Myra’s into hand full of nomi.
---
- Refill board as needed
---
- academic espionage for fatigue
---
Very valid on your second point. I'm still hesitant about arena but I do alright in Brawliseums and the occasional arena but I also know I'm in the top percent of players. It astounds me that I used to be stuck at rank 20 and people still are.
---
nah, got warpathed, brawled and dynomatic'd playing token druid
---
its an even matchup. just pray they dont have warpath
---
&gt;Or perhaps this game has finally fatigued its community by acting too slowly and overcharging them to partake?
---
People have been saying that for 5 years. The sad part is that even tho Hearthstone isn't super consumer-friendly this is how they maximize profits. They know what they're doing better than us they run a lot of market research.
---
This is a type of YouTube content. I've watched something like it before. poorly filmed, but not that weird.
---
I’m sure they’ve had this planned for a while. I mean, five villains from each of Hearthstone five years on HS’s fifth anniversary. Definitely not a coincidence by any means.
---
No, it’s not.
---
It sucks cause it destroys thief rogue and everyone is running two of these in rank 5 and above I’m just stuck.
---
I tried bomb warrior a little, mech hunter absolutely destroyed me.  Not being able to dynomatic an aggressive deck hurts so bad.
---
What about Jaraxxus? Plus warrior really isn’t superior
---
I don't think it was dragons, it's with Khadgar, Kalecgos, the other mage legendary and Jalalai. I saw Kiblar play it earlier on stream. It was pretty spell heavy with Mountain Giants on top. Looked pretty solid and beat most Bomb Warriors.
---
I keep getting Warlock legendaries. God. What am I supposed to do with Jeklik, Betrug and Rafaam? They don’t look bad but I can’t make them work, and any decks that might work with them I’m missing cards for and don’t really want to spend dust on.
---
Every time I buff my Spectral Cutlass vs Bomb Warrior. 
---
*please don't topdeck Weapons Project, please don't topdeck Weapons Project...*
---
&gt; And then finally, Shudderwock potentially gives you 11 additionally healing with the life drinkers and armor from Hagatha.
---
Err.  I haven't played this version of the deck, but last I played a deck with Wock and Hagatha, you did NOT get Hagatha's armour.  (It's not considered part of her battlecry, just the deal 3 damage is considered the battlecry).
---
Meme decks keeping it down. Myracle's the best deck by far.
---
I'm okay, but lately I'm just shit. I don't play a lot and when I do it's usually Tavern Brawl. So stuff like this week cuts my legs out from under me when it comes to building a collection.
---
&gt;dope meme.
---
dead meme
---
Silence priest is quite decent too
---
The deck isn’t invincible. Play a half decent deck and you’ll actually have a chance
---
Oh that's why I got down voted so bad.
---
*Insert pikachu face*
---
I’m on mobile idk how to do the full decklist easily. Used this though: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/hakkar-warlock-rise-of-shadows-firebat/

What is yours? I just can’t get the hang of the deck it feels like. I’ve played control lock forever but this one, this one scares me.

Play a token Druid. Tons of small descisions which can add up to big differences. Lots of other decks that have this kind of play style too.
---
What? That's not at all what I'm doing. Token druid is an onbiously good aggro deck and aggro decks dominate early on. Secret paladin is a bad aggro deck because it has no reach and no card draw. The classes that still have hero cards have an obvious advantage, at least while people are playing poorly refined meme and value decks, which haven't been able to beat the DKs for almost two years. And then everyone predicted rogue to be the best class. This is an obvious outcome.
---
That's what happens if a class keeps all their cards in rotation and can just jam in five new minions in their deck and call it a day. It will normalise as other decks get found. Although Control Warrior (probably without bombs) should stay powerful.
---
yes, instead people will always hate on psychic scream but forget how insane this card is thanks to its flexibility

How did you survive?
---
I would describe this as "completely rare".
---
I'm impressed you're so confident that I'm buying the next expansion. I'll be spending gold but not any cash. I got burned with legend distribution in Witchwood and now I'm done with Blizzard's lootbox monetization scheme. These 104 packs were the proverbial nails in the coffin. The thing that I have going for me is that I do have a significant Wild collection which will allow me to play competitive when I feel like it, but my days of dropping $60 - $80 are definitively done.
---
I never do quest or play in casual because my deck building choices are anything but casual. Last thing I want to do is stomp a new player who is using 70% basic cards in their deck. That’s my thought process at least.
---
What’s your list? I’ve been trying to make a token Druid without much luck.
---
this is actually a metric on how much time Jens (Trump's video editor) saves us.
---
Sounds like this isn't the game for you then.
---
No need for the changes. Overload works as an additional effect with the card like lifesteal on a spell. If the spell is cast, the overload is given to the control.
---
i kNOw WhO yoU ARe
---
First of all, that's just a disconnect.
---
Secondly, you forgot to add your proof.

I was playing a game yesterday (like rank 18 at the time to be fair, season climb just started) and had a guy do this. He blademaster on 2, played another on three, then flooped one on four and watched it implode. It was hilarious.
---
Probably the strongest neutral legendary in the game now. It fits in virtually any deck that needs to survive a certain number of turns. Would only hesitate if you only like aggro decks.
---
nah secret pally couldnt be carried by 3 cards that synergizes with 1 cost secrets with the loss of tarim, CotA, righteous protector, stonehill, etc

100% this.

---
I lost to Kalecgos into Calling in the arena yesterday. Wasn't even mad, that was a suck combo.
---
If you are this easily tilted and thin-skinned, you shouldn't be playing decks that have huge amount of RNG involved.
---
Dr. 7 is strong enough it was seeing play in non-optimized decklists on Wild some time ago. Blizzard buffed it to summon 3 times as many Boom Bots and threw it on Standard where the power level is drastically lower. No Reno or Healbot to outheal the bombs, no Scream or Devolve and it's even lacking some basic AoEs.
---
Bomb Warrior is going to be all you see for 2 years, good luck.
---
&gt; put 1 bomb in your opponents deck upgrades each turn.
---
Obviously that'd never happen. Doesn't mean the current version isn't still laughable garbage.
---
I just play wild at this point. Just chill with some classic decklists (mainly Patron Warrior with rush package + Rotface) you play loads of actually interesting decks.
---
I'm sure it never was about shuffling bombs into the opponents deck. That would definitely have been OP. My guess is that it summoned boombots.
---
I mean ticking abom was pretty bad, but I don't get why people lose thier shit so much. Like there's bound to be a few bad cards. I think what really bothered people is that the flavor and art don't match, so it was pretty obviously nerfed
---
Vargoth into Mass Resurrection with Catrina is going to make Res Priest a solid Tier 2 deck in this meta I think.
---
Wagglepick was a lot stronger than most anticipated. Most people planned on using necrium blade for myracle decks.
---
YOU! YOU'RE GOOD!
---
I played a guy running heal Druid.  His taunt guy that you bring back by healing for 5 was dead, and he played Ancient of Lore each of the next 2 turns...he elected to draw each time rather than heal.
---
Yep
---
Looks just like questing.
---
Greenskin works really well in tempo to give you extra hits with Waggle Pick which has won me many games so far, I think it's gonna be a staple of the deck
---
irrelevant for standard and not in 2 expansions but in a year or 2, dunno anymore how long they stay but i guess it was 1 year.
---
King of 8 drops? Ragnaros begs to differ
---
I know about others, I’m talking about hearthstone specifically. ^^
---
If your only basis for such a statement is twitch viewership numbers, there are a myriad of reasons why it has generally been on the downward trend beyond the game being bad.
---
Plus, last year's weak sets were made that way on purpose to help future proof the game in the same exact was as the MtG blocks Mercadian Masques and Kamigawa did following the Urza's and Mirrodin.
---
It sucks in the moment, but much like how letting a field recover for a year before planting in it again makes the land more fruitful, it will recover.
---
Someone finally said it. I really don't think this game runs nearly as bad as some people think. I play on an shitty 3 year old laptop and it runs fine. The people who say "I've got a 2080ti and 32 gigs of ram and this game still runs like shit" are almost definitely being dishonest or just have incredibly high standards that could never be met". Its a card game anyway. You really don't need it to run at an insanely high framerate or anything to begin with.
---
Either way, it seems like it's good it got  nerfed. Imo boom and clockwork goblin are too powerful and will probably get nerfed if bomb warrior stays dominant
---
It actually does revert to eventually drawing you a card, so in some weird edge case you could do it intentionally for card draw.
---
Yea God forbid these horrible people give you a free win. HOW DARE HE! DOESN'T THIS SHITLORD KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT YOU TAKE LADDER SERIOUSLY?!? Are we able to report him to the police? Because he deserves LIFE IN PRISON
---
Too bad he fell into the trap of just disenchanting everything and seems to be stuck with it.
---
You can make a zoolock deck and just throw rafaam in there, it just lets you some big stuff after turn 7, which is pretty nice (i dont really have a list for it but just threw together zoo stuff and it seemed nice.
---
No.

---
Yep, I wish Lucentbark had a "Starts in your hand" clause. The deck can't do anything without it anyway.
---
It's a value meme just like Goblet tbh. Crown and Wand immediately do a ton. If you're picking Kobold the reason could also be that you're desperate for a taunt, therefore already in a losing position. Makes sense imo

I'm pretty sure bomb warrior won't be dominant once we have a settled meta. Looks like a tier1 candidate, but not dominating. Hardcounters already existed and even got printed with this set. It's still reliable on rng as well. But tbh it's one of my 2 favorite decks so far. It's great fun.
---
I hate Zul'jin in the deck, it feels like it barely has any spells.
---
Yes, just confusing how it was displayed

If you put kragwa, combo it with witch brew and you can outheal the damage Bomb Warrior can make

I think Nomi is the choice here solely because a 6/6 for 7 isn't catastrophically bad value.
---
Full House.
---
Also that sounds like it would be super op too. That would give bomb warrior 3 cards that pretty easily fill thier board with boom bits to clear opponents board or nuke thier face in addition to bombs that come from cards that are already solid themselves
---
Yeah \[\[unseen saboteur\]\] One of my favorite new cards in control decks

He played it as Warrior too so it's not unrealistic, it is hard to believe he only faced one bomb warrior though, he was incredibly lucky in that aspect.
---
1 Whizbang
---
We essentially got a card added to the basic set for two years. That should happen way more frequently, if anything. New players are truly fucked in this game.
---
I need to just buck up and craft it. I'm only like 30 wins away from gold warrior too
---
You can't really compare HS to other video games though. It's a CCG. Compare it to MtG, Pokemon, Yugioh, Artifact (lol). 
---
All that said, you can't "trade" cards. You can dust them which is kind of like trading in cards to a store but usually stores gives you at least 50% value.
---
You mean that there are aggro decks in Hearthstone ??? What the fuck man, that's really strange...
---
Fact: Dr. Boom hero would still be played without the persistent rush effect on mechs. This effect only exists because Boom needed to compete with the absolutely broken death knight cards.
---
Anyone with half a brain could have predicted the bomb mechanic would be insanely strong. Control warrior, as it exists now with the card selection in standard + a guaranteed win condition is just ridiculous. Throwing 45+ face damage into my deck with cards that are attached to some pretty beefy bodies to boot means I need to dedicate a ton of my deck to healing effects and deck swapping tools just to have a chance at victory.
---
I don't think it's fair that a warrior can focus entirely on clearing the board and just win the game off the back of bombs. It's jade druid all over again: too much value packed into flexible cards.
---
I think hero cards were a mistake. Some people didn't realize it in KFT because *every* class had access to one, and they were all at least decent.
---
I've been playing Rafaam in control lock and it really doesn't do nearly enough in the matchup, unfortunately.
---
Then you should! There are quite a couple of versions out there atm. The one im performing best with is a rush/mech/bomb warrior.
---
Eternal is good for friends though not ranked mode.
---
If people are willing to take a bigger risk
---
Plants vs Zombies Heros, Duelyst (PC only) and Star Crusade CCG are in development limbo but still running meaning at least there's a chance of finishing a collection before they shut down
---
I hate Brawliseum so much. It's the only Tavern brawl that I straight up skip. A classic pack isn't worth slogging through that garbage.

You're bitching that you can use the free legendary in every class instead of just one class? Entitlement on this subreddit really is at an all time high.

---
Our daddy taught us not to be ashamed of our dicks. Especially since they’re such good size and all.
---
Thanks for all of your help. I did it! Murlocs won the day!!! :)
---
"Things we get for free or at least at a discounted price are getting less and less"
---
Show me the hard proof that this is true. We now get a free legendary for logging in after an xpac releases. We get free arena tickets, free golden cards, free events (usually between xpacs), 12 free packs for doing basically nothing but playing, the discounted shadow bundle, the option to preorder two bundles as opposed to one.... this game will always cost you either: time or money. You just need to figure out which you value more. I would argue that we continue to get more and more free stuff, but people love to *believe* that we don't because it feels good to complain when you don't have everything you want on Day 1 of an expansion... Just my take.
---
No clue about their lore, but the card art for Malygos is actually artwork of Kaecgos
---
You are not alone.  I am waiting to open a few more packs but I don't have a ton of stuff from the new collection so I am just playing my own version of tempo rogue with no new cards (basically my own version of the old myracle rogue without faldori and a slight tweak to old\_guardian's "expansion proof" hooktusk rogue).  I am going to wind up crafting the new tempo rogue once the meta settles since I have almost everything for it.
---
But yeah unless you are a pro player or rich, at best you can play maybe 1 new deck (if the legendaries are safe to craft).  We ALL get hyped to try out a bunch of new decks and for the vast majority of us, it simply does not come to fruition.
---
The other thing is despite people saying "lol the meta isn't settled yet," if you look at old early meta lists from VS and HSR, the meta actually settles really, really early.  Yes people will try to counter weapons and there may be more control decks, but for the most part, we already know what the next 3 months are going to look like.  
---
The solution would be for those that like to pay give them way more value for their money (like 160 instead of 80 packs) or, my preference, really dump a crap ton of free packs on us for each new expansion.  12 packs is okay but they really would need to throw a lot more at us.  We still will invest in the game it's just then our investments will open up decks.
---
Also TB was a slap in the face.  Seriously why not just make a whizbang brawl or give us random stuff to play with?  I feel that was just designed for people who want to spam net decks and that is NOT the fun part of a new expac (and if it is that's what ladder is for)!!
---
I know right? Weird. But OP makes it sound that they were related to Genn and Baku and somehow they are still around? Confusing.
---
There are dozens of you!
---
Perhaps. Only time will tell. However, my personal support of the game is over until they rethink things.
---
Still around, still a hero as he has always been. Keeping you safe from an infinite nightmare and fighting with his wife Tyrande to defeat Sylvanas and her twisted version of the horde. #IStandWithSaurfang
---
&gt; Sure ; point is, you still have something of value with the games you mention, even if that value is near zero
---
So you're saying that you would rather spend $50 on something you can sell for $25 later than spend $20? That makes zero sense at all.
---
I agree. It's a big part of why I wish Whizbang goes to classic. I only started playing sometime last year so when the cards rotated out, I was seriously left with no cards to create any other decent decks outside of Murloc Shaman. I was a big fan of quest decks and its a shame they took out the quests. Currently I have to rely on Whizbang to play anything outside of Murloc Shaman.
---
You don't! You cant play this game f2p only endless grind and 1 deck in 5-6 month, so either donate or don't play this game.
---
My point is that I am trying to find the reason for it and what other people think about it.
---
How can you be sure that it is a bad reason if you don't know it?
---
That is the same like judging a person or a game by the looks of it.
---
&gt; The legendary 7 drop is a 3/8 that cannot attack but deals 3 damage to random enemy when attacked, for those wondering (so I deem it worthless)
---
Gunspire Tower might actually be pretty good against Warrior right now. Good counter to his Warpath, which will protect your other minions, and will give him something to think about before dropping Dyn-O-Matic.
---
The 5 Mana 4/4 that Deals 4 damage If you are Holding a spell that costs 5 or more

One of the reasons I really like Elder Scrolls is their world is like 'oh yeah, this part of the world had more sun so obvs the dudes and dudettes are darker'.

And then your opponent plays Twisting Nether. :)
---
I know how much I got for moxes and dual lands when I quit playing MTG, it's really not comparable to hearthstone.
---
It's one of the best crafts you can do.
---
huh? i’m not one to think any questions are stupid, but damn.
---
I actually tried this and it seems way better without the dead mans hand shell. They just dont mesh unfortunately. Dead mans hand wants a lot of card draw meaning you want coldlight and acolyte. And recruit warrior wants really big minions and much more heavy control tools rather than smaller card draw oriented ones (slam mostly). I wouldnt craft it unless you are gonna play the fatigue version which works decent still and probably better with the new mad summoner tech card
---
There's also a little error in the formulas in the "Which Pack" sheet - specifically, the cells in the EV contribution tables for Boomsday Project and Rastakhan's rumble seem to be referencing cells from Rise of Shadows. For instance, the formula in cell C86 reads

---
 =$B$3\*(($B$16-B86)/$B$16\*$B$4+B86/$B$16\*$B$5) 
---
It looks like the sheet's been doing this for a while, as in the old Rastakhan's sheet, this cell also references the latest expansion's data, but it has never mattered before!
---
Honestly I'm not even sure if Blizzard cares about hearthstone anymore. They keep going through the motions but they lost a big chunk of their revenue last year and haven't done anything about it which sort of tells me they're just waiting for it to die because invest in it might not really be the right business decision at this point.
---
They are probably happy with how things are going, they invest minimal effort and it still drives substantial profits. Why make things better? The card game fad is over, all the other card games have failed, hearthstone has lost most of it's viewership and rent and it's not like it was displaced by another card game competitor (had this been the case I assure you they would have done a lot more for the game). 
---
So yeah, it's sad to see. But hearthstone is dead, it pretty much died when Ben Brode and the rest of the team left to form their own company. 
---
I miss it all. Luckily I had enough wild cards that I could make any deck if I dust them but what is the point? I went from rank 20 to rank 7 in a day with murloc shaman, now I can craft rogue and probably reach legend, but I have already done it once (with ungoro priest). All I do by playing is being a glorified AI for high paying customers. The game doesn't reward anyone enough, it's just an illusion.
---
Because maybe just disenchanting everything without a thought is a bad idea generally while also cutting you off from potentially getting into the format easily in the future if you were to ever change your mind.
---
Whoa, what deck is that? Sounds like something for m..... y friend, who sucks at playing.
---
You really think the power level is lower. I know it’s early and the meta is usual fast to start but I can see token and Murloc and even rogue dominating the Meta.
---
TIL you can craft adventyre cards
---
Yeah, never dust on the first expansion of the year.
---
It’s a joke about it still saying year of the raven on the loading tip.
---
You should try to keep your rank above 5.
---
If you're tough with dust you can skip it. It's currently being cut from the tempo list, so it doesn't seem like it' will be a staple in that deck.
---
You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
---
I met one of you fellas today while playing Odd Mage. I need to put more removal in my deck...
---
The whizbang hunter mech deck is actually really good
---
Technically the opponent never got a turn, therefore turn 1
---
Interesting mech hunter list. In my experience playing it I don't find unleash the best to be that exemplary of a card, but instead this guy opted to build more into it by including Sunreaver Warmage. Will try this out.
---
Just keep playing, no reason to throw games, the higher your rank, the better your rewards, which will help you get more cards to beat the meta decks
---
Look into yesterday's thread, there was a Midrange Hunter without any legendaries I think.
---
🤢🤮
---
Every morning when im doing my routine and hook up the stream to my cars audio on the way to work. Sometimes hes still going when i go on lunch. Hes such a positive(95 percent of the time) and creative streamer. Less than tree-eeee!
---
Whenever I play dragon paladin I lose to anything control and sometimes beat aggro
---
Totems don’t ever roll duplicates, so this doesn’t even make sense if the restriction didn’t exist.
---
You beat it with a deck that literally does the thing that hard-counters it? gg
---
Sorry I’m not a hoarder. I use what I have to live my life to the fullest now. I don’t worry about petty shit like that.
---
It's numbers are probably brought down by jank like thief rouge in lower ranks.
---
Ya keep your mmr low
---
Tbh, even if I had the possibility to make a lot of decks (and I do, specially if I start disenchanting my Wild cards), I don't have the time to test everything I want. Whizbang is almost always better and 1 or 2 days in there are still so many decks put out there by streamers to try.
---
I just saved myself last game picking the Kobold. Had a Waggle Pick setup to do the Heistbaron twice and picked the Goblet first. 
---
It did flood my whole hand with Preparations. The Golden Kobold turned the game into a win by replacing those with legendaries.
---
Electra Stormsurge?
---
Class not deck. Tempo rogue is probably in the top 3 decks but rogue's numbers are being brought down by other stuff.
---
This was in arena though. So not standard.
---
Yeah, he was some minion mage and pulled it from the handsize summon, so I left it and he drew two bombs that would have killed him w/ spellpower
---
0-3 with whizbang :p
---
No they're rank 50.
---
Sadly, yes. :( I bought the big pack (for bnet balance from wow-gold) and had some gold saved up. Got one more today though!
---
What you need to do is build a crazy deck that's designed to work really well against at least one popular meta deck.  Maybe your crazy deck also includes lots of anti-aggro tech, for example.
---
Play cards that light up green
---
Went 10-0 on ladder, and something like 8-3 on brawliseum. Bomb warriors with lot of armor are kinda annoying (my 4 losses in a row in brawl) but against taunt/deathrattle priest, handlock, it’s fine. If you can have a good opener, you can maintain against aggro-ish deck. Didn’t faced much Tokken drood but might be hard against them too.
---
You know what to do, lose slowly over the span of 35 turns.
---
"I see the essence of your soul"
---
Oh, I thought you were trying to compare similar hobbies. I'm considering spending my money on a desk lamp or a Ferrari. I can compare those too.
---
Thanks 🅱️eter that JoJo reference is of particular hilarity
---
Damn, probably would’ve lost that game either way then since I really needed to play Tess when I did. I really hate that mech warrior lol
---
Does Zoo run Zilliax? Boom was reasonably common to see as the top end along with Loatheb/Doomguard.
---
Look up the way u can but u need a computer to edit your hearthstone files
---
Is it sth that was there forever it it’s a new thing? One would hope it’s sth that can be fixed with an app update.
---
If you didn't get them before they rotated the old adventures still hold up and you can buy them from the online store still
---
Any date for the single player?
---
Omega assembly is the real problem. Just throw 2 of them in your deck and you don't even need any other lategame, and you don't lose tempo playing them.
---
Some of us are over 25, thank you.
---
I play it "co op" with my friend quite a bit. Its really fun talking about deck picks, and since theres no turn timer in PvE you can relax and chat while playing.
---
No good Token Druid or Murloc Shaman list should be running Zilliax.
---
I finish work in a couple hours. Can add you and run through a few games with you if ya like.
---
I don't really care about rank and I don't get anything from casual.
---
That's at least my reasoning.
---
Most people who budget would have an "entertainment budget".
---
They wouldn't say that they have a "CCG budget" and a separate "videogame budget".  They'd just pool those together along with other things (like movies) and then spend it however they like on the things that they enjoy.
---
YMMV
---
You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.
---
I believe it just doesn't show up for new players from now on, but they can be purchased for free on the Blizzard website.
---
Isn't that just an issue in your approach? 
---
You value winning over trying out something 'fun' or 'new'.
---
Counterpoint: you can run it In rafaam’s scheme + darkest hour big warlock for the incredible meme value
---
Nomi is hype
---
When you play the card you are not holding it
---
I feel scraphound got unfairly written off as worse version of Eternium rover but it’s actually really useful mid to late game when you magnetise something onto it, especially if it has rush (either naturally or from boom). Considering dropping one or both rovers for it in my control warrior deck
---
I strongly doubt that it shuffled bombs. This stuff gets playtested before art is added and that would quite obviously be batshit insane, even without any other bomb cards in the set.
---
for other games that still aslo very likly and quite often have dlc's  , but hs is a cardgame and for a cardgame is pretty cheap.
---
Yeah the complaints irk me too, the money isn't necessary, but it definitely negates the need for grind. Paying what amounts to a AAA game every three months isn't that heinous to me either, since I have limited time, and it's useless to buy every game that fits your niche because you don't have the time to play it all. So I choose a few games and commit.
---
Where? Playing MTG?
---
But but, g n o m i
---
It’s great. The new Crystalsong portal is crazy reload in the mid-game and Blessing of the Ancients is fantastic.
---
I just went 12-1 in Brawliseum with this exact deck. I faced like 5 bomb warriors in a row at the end. 
---
I will say that over half of my wins were from Leeroy, and many of those shadowsteping. I particularly liked the game I discovered windfury and hit him three times with Leeroy in a turn.
---
&gt;It is a CCG but the point is its competition is not other card games. I dont think to myself do I want to play HS or Magic, I think to myself HS or Lol of Apex.
---
That's interesting because that is the exact comparison I make. I choose between MTGA and HS. 
---
I could see someone comparing it to other mobile games, especially other mobile card games but comparing it to LOL, Apex or Fortnite is where the false comparisons I feel come from. 
---
LOL is not competing with Hearthstone for my time. Hearthstone is competing with MTGA, paper magic and keyforge for my time.
---
what do you recommend for warlock, priest and hunter? i need those 3 for the card back
---
Your maths checks out with my luck XD
---
Token is great, I'd put it as another non-jank deck that's sure to stick around
---
Ohhh thanks for explaining!! I thought tess had shudderwocks effect for some reason lol
---
I had the one that summons two 2/3 taunts and then the legendary minions.
---
New hagatha is really cool
---
I have a decent enough collection now that I can play a few different decent wild decks. It'll be a few months before I can play standard again, so I'm happy to rough it in wild for the time being. I have a bit of dust, so I may make the switch permanent. Easier to do in wild since the decks don't drastically change, but I could never keep up with standard.
---
Big bad archmage is pretty good in muckmorpher shaman, could try that one
---
if it's equal chances why do i only get the darkness?
---
Man, what? Shudderwock was so strong it was nerfed twice, once directly and once with the change to Saronite Chain Gang. I’ll bet money we’ll see the same with warrior, it’s extremely broken.
---
Opened golden Rafaam and playing 6 mana 5/5 every turn with nothing else to do for most games sucks hard. On the other hand the highrolls are fabulous. Best legendary to open golden IMO.
---
I completed dungneon run with all classes but I think TW always killee me when I got him.
---
Hi, friend.
---
ye first wing free, next 4 are 700 gold each or 2800 gold/20 bucks in total
---
yeah but you still drew 3 cards getting you closer to your win condition.  2 legendarys could be nice depending on the opponent and board state but generally I want to get through my deck ASAP and vomit out as much tempo as possible.
---
Don’t forget Pet Shop (Horus) and Centerfold (Hanged Man).
---
No problem friend
---
I use a 6s as well and I rarely ever have problems. Does take a little bit to load up but it’s not a huge deal.
---
Deck list?
---
It’s not bad vs aggro but it’s too high roll and classes that don’t have to do anything early game can just sit and wait until they wanna trigger your secrets
---
Or i've never bothered to play ranked to begin with. I don't care for legend, I play casually. You literally took everything out of context. Typical reddit.
---
Of? Both my decks?
---
I think pally may always get the darkness, so if you only play pally that’s why. I’d google it though
---
My bad, I was thinking of 80 packs, not 50.
---
50 packs get you 1 legendary within 10 packs, and then 1 every 20 (on average). So 3 legendaries is *exactly* average, not "significantly above average" as you claim.
---
&gt;It just depends I guess on how many viable epics and legends you get.  I once opened 40 packs and got 2 golden legendaries and a regular legendary.  I also did 10 RoS packs to get my first legend (10 mana heal paladin dragon) and no epics.  I have more gold saved up but haven't spent yet.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;And plenty of people can open 50 or even 80 packs and wind up with no VIABLE legends and only 1-2 decent epics.  There just is a lot of variance.
---
I agree with this, due to packs being randomized there is some luck involved. 
---
&gt;On average though most players really cannot make that many good meta decks out of just 80 packs or at least that seems to be the consensus here and while some of that is whining, some of it is a legit complaint.  But yeah others do blow it way out of proportion.
---
I think the problem I have is that people think they should be able to play absolutely whatever they want. That defeats the entire purpose of the collectible card game. It's just a card game at that point no different than a game that uses a traditional deck of playing cards. That's not what hearthstone is..
---
Or different people with different opinions? I agree with the first guy it is so fantastic so far
---
Yup, I see it. Excellent catch. It's a product of how error prone the process for adding new sets to that particular tab is.
---
They've been fixed for now, but I think this has convinced me to rework the the formulas in there. Right now the cells are referenced directly ($B$16, B86, etc), but I should make the effort to parse the strings in the title cells (e.g. "Rise of Shadows - Desired Cards") and then use lookups to find the desired value in the Inputs box. It's something I already did with the regex parsing functions in the the cells to the left of them, like B86, as well as in the tables of the Totals tab to avoid the same kind of problems. No reason not to do it for these formulas too.
---
aslo dust means all cards are same for same rarity, else youd have milhouse be worth like 10 dust and when was in standard still tarim easly like 3k+ and baku and genn even more with goldens costing even more. 4 trash legendary is still a good one you want where  wouldnt in other games.
---
Any good aggro decks on the go? Not played for 2 years and every fucking game is 45 minutes long now. Just want it over.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Upvote people need to see this and relize rng is rigged and so is draw rate since the tavern brawl where u drew the perfect curve everytime
---
Here you go: https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1226093-free-medivh-pve-heroic
---
Pretty funny OTK, but the chance of seeing two Velen from this combo isn't too bad.  There is only 45 minions that cost 7 mana (might be 44, since I don't think you can resummon the same minion), and he rolled twice. That's 4.4% odd.
---
Alternately, getting an al-akir would have wrecked him as well (16+12+5 damages), leaving him with 3 health. Mix that with a Stormwind Champion or Darkmire Moonkin, and you hit lethal.
---
No, it really can't be, it's not media. It's an entirely different form of entertainment. TV over antenna, sure, but that's fairly restrictive in your choices and you still 'pay' in time by watching advertisements.
---
All of that aside, how does listing things that are cheaper than games show me that the TCGs which are even more expensive are reasonably priced? Where's the argument here?
---
That belongs in a museum!
---
Eveytime I see pogo hopper, the rogue dies with 20 pogo in their deck and 1 card in hand.
---
And the worst thing is they're expensive. You're often stuck playing a bad statted high cost minion with relatively useless effect, some even detrimental.
---
After every expansion release, I re-learn how much better boring meta decks are than homebrew fun decks. Priests are playing a 5/6 on turn 3 and duplicating it on turn 4. Guess i'll just lose, then.

Me too crash every few mins cant even craft without crafting
---
I don’t think it’s too strong I just think too many people are playing it. The card that replaces your deck with 10 cards is a pretty effective way to ruin there win condition if you pull it off
---
Mysterious Warrior: 3 mana | 4/2 | Gain +1/+1 for each Secret you control.
---
Priest was the last one and definitely the hardest to win with for me as well. Was worth it though
---
Hmmm.... I unpacked Nomi and Elysiana.  I guess I'm required to try this deck.  Elysiana I love, but I haven't found any use for Nomi.
---
Yeah I only started buying the expansions at witchwood, it definitely wasnt a full collection.
---
Cloth items obviously need a buff
---
I got my last 100 wins for gold warlock with a disco deck and the thought have having cards i super want to discard has me salivating.

---
The problem I see is that it has no way of dealing with a mid-large size board other than Hagatha's Scheme. I don't think it gets upgraded enough to be playable unless you have it in your opener, and that doesn't happen a lot.
---
If we see a lot of decks running small minions like Zoo or Tempo Rogue or Murloc Shaman, Control Shaman may be pretty decent, but right now with decks like Handlock, Mech Hunter, Ressurect Priest, Big Warrior and even Midrange Hunter floating around I'm afraid there is a lot to be desired.
---
I think a deck like Control Warrior will always be better due to great control tools like Brawl, Supercollider, and Dynomatic.
---
I'm not trying to hate on Control Shaman ( I love the deck and would probably main it if it was good) but I don't think it's powerful enough right now.
---
If you and your opponent start the game, he goes first and takes his turn and then you take your turn, what turn is it?
---
If you said turn 3, your logic makes sense. 2 turns have ended so it's turn 3.  
---
If you said turn 2, your logic doesn't make sense. Both players have taken their first turn so it's turn 2.
---
I’ve made a mech hunter and its doing really well against warriors
---
it even feels shitty to but packs with gold cause if you dont get anything with it either, it feels like wasted time instead of wasted money
---
I use the mech legendary.  Its pretty good actually
---
So if I craft gold for ones that I cashed in already for neutral, what happens?
---
checks and balances
---
To continue to afford to play *Standard*. You should be more clear on that.
---
You insist on playing Standard.
---

Im not sure if you are joking or not but Ill explain it. OP played a doomsayer and his opponent just dropped a bunch of minions on the board without killing the doomsayer.
---
That's actually an incredible rate of legendaries. I think you should be pretty happy given the average is 1 legendary in 20 packs. I wouldn't disenchanted Nomi yet, but you can always dust him later for a free legendary of your choice.
---
Just played a Dragon warrior who got 3 (3!!!!!!!!!!!!) Emeeris from Dragon Roar (One extra from a Vargoth combo). Had to battle through a 18/26 harvest golem, 32/96 Ysera and 56/56 Elysiana among multiple other large minions before he got Voone from Elysiana and copied his 32/96 Nzori two times.... :-(((
---
You can stay at 10 cards in your hand to avoid bomb damage
---
The problem is that there's no simple way to say "if you have 10 mana crystals and none of those came from a card..." and I get that. I feel like that just furthers the argument that it SHOULD with with the coin, though. 
---
This game needs way fewer interactions and rules that require experience to understand.
---
Aw man, hey, at least it's playable! I was thinking of crafting it just because the deck has done well so far, and most importantly, it's pretty fun!
---
Yeah, right
---
"How dare you add counter to the brainless deck that i'm playing?"
---
Translation
---
Good to know im not just crazy
---
If this combo ends up being good I'm gonna have to craft Vereesa. Although I havenever drawn Jepetto by turn 8 and not Malygos with what I've tried so far.
---
Nothing hits harder than life
---
You'd end up with people making throwaway accounts to get random legendaries and just trading to their main accounts.
---
I know right family guy isn't even relevant anymore anyway
---
That’s why I craft most cards that I do.
---
STUPID MONKEY
---
Genn was never problematic in my opinion. Baku was the op card but people always keep saying gen/baku because of the mechanism.
---
You're absolutely right. I didn't consider that. Tbh even if it was just epics/rares it might help.
---
Don't take my ramblings too seriously. I think if you showed me this image half a year ago it wouldn't have the same effect. It's just that I recently saw a good video going into what makes cosmic horror, combined with watching stuff about black holes, combined with me being slightly drunk and thus feeling philosophical.
---
That lion is amazing
---
nice, I'll give it a try!
---
What I've learned as some one who has only purchased one pack and that was back in beta, you have to pick three or four classes that you absolutely will never play no matter what. Disenchant every card possible for those classes in order to finnance expirmenting with your mains. I decided a long time ago i was never going to touch priest or shaman and I've been able to experiment pretty well with warlock (my favorite class) and druid (the class that I've never crafted a legendary for but some how have everysingle one of them)
---
I wonder who sold them overpriced cards back then because Blizz wasnt around Kappa
---
I guess it depends on the deck type. If you are playing a low cost deck it isn’t worth quite as much
---
it would be your first turn? i dont know what you are going on about but you are way out in left field. each players have their own turns in order. 
---
t1 you/t1 opponent t2 you/t2 opponent t3 you/t3 opponent and so on. 
---
taking an extra turn essentially looks like this:
---
1 you/ 1 opponent t2 you(takes extra turn)/ t3 you/t2 opponent and so on.
---
Actually i only play wild so my thought was to craft a card that might be rotated out in the future. Simply a card currently in standard.
---
You know I never played WOW so I don't know much of the lore but it sounds cool. I never even watched the movie before.
---
So dragons can just become humans whenever they want?
---
inb4 burgled brawl winning the one in 8
---
Then you're really uncreative.
---
I actually think both hunter legendaries have their place in the meta, Vereesa is a cool flavorful card in a lategame Hunter that goes face with spells, and Oblivitron looks like it'll be a staple in mech hunter for some time.
---
nice
---
Looks professional studio grade quality 👌
---
How far though? 1 deck? 2? 3? The line has to be drawn somewhere right, otherwise it's no longer a collectible card game. Personally I think around 75 packs and having 3-4 viable decks is the right number.
---
Priest, Mage, Shaman, Druid, and Hunter can all make some good plays with Vargoth. Get creative, stop whining.
---
yup, really strong, just "steal" opponent's late game cards
---
lol that's a huge lie, people get shadowbanned on some subs just for posting in other subs
---
Finally a proper thread for the deck. 
---
Gonna save for future reference. 
---
I really enjoy the deck as well, but my list is far from refined. So much to experiment right now!!
---
Beast Hunter with zuljin is a strong deck with multiple win conditions as far as I can tell
---
[[Nine Lives]] 
---
[[Kirin Tor Tricaster]]
---
[[Dragon Speaker]]
---
Personally I think people are sleeping on heal/mech pally. Kangor's Endless is an insane card if you build a deck around it, only really need 4 different mechs and with all the leftover space you build a heal archetype deck.

5/3/5 | Battlecry: Give all Dragons in your hand +3/+3.  
---
Yeah! Every mech hunter list I've seen so far has used it. Seems really powerful when activated with fireworks tech or nine lives.
---
Yes? So if I were to argue that I just saved 5000 gold to open the packs, would you *als* argue that I should not consider the 10-pack legendary because hey, maybe I preordered and opened *those* packs first?
---
How does this work, exactly?
---
Shhh
---
So a 25% chance to stay alive, a 1 in a 100 chance the next random legendary drawn is Tess, a 50%  chance the minion that spawns copies of spawn minions is spawned before the minion with charge and windfury.  Seems fair.
---
Blows my mind Wondrous Wand isn't running away with pick %. When I first saw Heistbaron, I thought it would just be "ass a Wondrous Wand" to your hand. Turns out I was right on the winrate, but the mob ain't too smart I guess. Not surprising in hindsight that Zarog's Crown is the highest pick. It could be anything! Even a Heistbaron! At least it is by far the second-best card to choose from.
---
I have also opened about 90 packs, got the gold just from doing dailies, not much effort put into it. I've been playing since beta so I have most of the classic set and I have opened around 90 packs previous expansions. I can play most of the decks freely - unless I have to craft 2+ legendaries. F2P player, it can be done but it isn't very beginner friendly. It requires playing for over a year to be able to have fun in the first two weeks before the meta settles down and not worrying so much, if the legendary you crafted will be in tier one decks or not.
---
3 mana 4/4 the value
---
I’ve been playing the wiz decks, since I’m not ready to drop money on the expansion yet. I’ve enjoyed it at rank 20-15, and I haven’t played in almost a year. I spent way too much before so I was pretty bitter about how bad it’s been, but I may purchase a bit again if it continues to be enjoyable.
---
I think he is unfair at 7 mana with 7 armor. The value comes from the warrior class.
---
Bonobo the real heal Druid runs Maly and Jepetto. 3 Lucentbarks and 2 Malys is the real way to win.
---
I’m normally stuck around Rank 4/5 but I plowed into 3 today with Zoo Warlock in like 15/20 games
---
I think it's more he regrets doing it since the opponent got a free five 2/2s and had enough mana to cast buffs on them aswell.
---
If control shaman becomes the most popular deck, then otk Hunter will spike in popularity because it destroys control shaman

I was wondering where the dust come from. I got a golden genn on the WW pack but already got the dust for him and dusted right away. I guess I was lucky enough this time!
---
It's really iffy, even in the same card. For example, I got the lackey that gives +1 attack and rush. I put that on Prelate, traded it, and drew it again later. It still had the +1 attack, but not rush.
---
This game will die soon and they deserve it.
---
New expansion sucks.
---
I stopped buy bundles and pre exp, now as F2P i got 1 legendary in more then 35 packs.
---
New meta isn't fun at all and cannot be better next week.
---
See you Blizzy it was nice for a bit
---
I don't see how you got that conclusion. At most it's one 7/1Baron.
---
[[Hench-Clan shadequill]] is so above the goddamn curve he’s floating in orbit. 
---
Like it doesn’t matter how cool Priest’s other toys are, a 4/7 for 4 mana with a drawback that minuscule is nuts.
---
I'm not talking about cost at all. Just the unfortunate extent to which "ha wouldn't it be cool if I could ____" doesn't compete with "this is a lot of stats that I can cheat out reliably ahead of curve."
---
Hush, you're making Malfurion smile.  And I think by tomorrow Token will be the #1 deck in the game.

4/4/7 | Deathrattle: Restore 5 Health to the enemy hero.

It's way too early to say. At present this is a key card in a tier 2 deck, but as the meta is far from solved murloc shaman could rise to tier 1 or drop off the list completely.  I expect it will remain tier 2
---
OOOOO that makes sense.
---
LOL, yea OP made a huge mistake.
---
What a beautiful Netherstorm

So in the album I posted you can see, but basically they are stuck about to attack me and the rope never burns out so all I can do is concede
---
Doesn’t show as green - he must’ve attacked already.

Im pretty sure that if we downvote you to infinity and you end up having negative karma points, theres a possibility that every comment and post you make is automatically deleted. Not sure if it applies to this subreddit, but it wouldn't hurt to try it out.

Did somebody order a bomb?
---
Nice work. 4,200 more to go for those golden portraits!
---
He should've seen it coming
---
I'm curious. Do you buy other top releases? Fallout, CoD, FarCry, Spiderman, Smash Bros... etc?
---
Hi curious, I'm dad!
---
Any mirror match I have always comes down to elysiana. If they aren't running her, I win and if they are, things get a lot spookier

Control Warrior would like a word with you

Free Dust!

Ha, i took almost 50 minutes, because i opened one by one :P

We Care! Nice one man!
