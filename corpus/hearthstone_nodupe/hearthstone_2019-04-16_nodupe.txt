I‚Äôm in awe how Zarog‚Äôs Crown has gone mainstream.

---
Control can have a combo finisher. E.g. Anduin + Mindblast or Alexstrasza + Grommash. It wasn't the main goal of the deck.
---
Don't get me started on epics.

---
That's an outrageous claim, sir.
---
Imagine being this confident and this wrong at once
---
Thats the price you pay. You dont /have/ to sit on cards. Force the bomb out, less value for the warrior when boom comes down, less you have to worry about later if you draw the bombs out.
---
These are only my observations. I was hesitant to draw bombs, but either you take them now, or take them later, when the warrior can get 6 boom bots and do even more damage.
---
The optimised version was indubitably a combo deck. But the deck took some time to get there.
---
Plus it's perfectly possible to have a hybrid combo-control deck.
---
Ggs :)
---
Yep. only time weapon removal hurt me in my legend climb was when i actually needed the pick damage to go face, the minion back to hand usually was beneficial. i hit top 500 today with your list by the way, so thank you lots
---
Greenskin was my first ever legendary. 
---
I dusted him to have enough to craft Leeroy. 
---
I just recrafted the captain few days back...

Infinite Togwaggle is a value combo without a doubt. It plays exactly like Mech'thun, except when you draw your whole deck your win condition isn't kill Mech'thun and auto win, it's shuffle crazy amounts of Togwaggle into your deck thereby securing a value victory by inevitability. That is undoubtedly an entire deck built around a single combo--deck full of card draw and cycle, built around a two card combo that requires you play your big minion and then another card to do something to it that secures you victory either automatically or inevitably.
---
Combo decks do not have to be OTK, or TTK, my friend. Just because you're used to decks building around lethal combos does not mean value combos don't exist because they do. Any deck that builds nearly completely around a very specific set of cards is a combo deck.
---
&gt;A 6 mana 10/10 would be played in ANY deck, from aggro to control
---
I'm not sure it would be played in *any* deck but it would certainly see play
---
Oh wow, that sucks. They need to find a new design for this.
---
This card single-handedly made me stop playing Warrior of any kind.
---
There's no way of knowing whether your opponent has Elysiana or not until you've played 20 minutes in the mirror. And when you end up teching her yourself because you have to, *then* you suddenly play against super greedy decks that also include Baleful Banker. It's so silly.
---
You are being downvoted, but I actually agree with you.
---
I think while a creative card, it doesn't have a place in a game like hearthstone that was always supposed to be about fun and fast paced games. She just gives too much value for what a game of only having 30 cards is about.
---
I think rather than deleting her, Blizzard should rework her. But, let's be real. They allowed Shudder to go on freezing games for so long. One can only imagine how many years, decades even, until they take action
---
Hasn't been played for a while though.
---
That buff is bugged, not the Prelate.
---
I.e. copying a minion with that buff with Faceless Manipulator also does not give the copy Rush.
---
Glad you're having good success friend! Congratulations on your legend push.

Closest you can get right now is mage with [[research project]]. A few streamers did some fill the opponents hand with cards [[Griftah]] and [[drakkari trickster]]decks last expo, but i havent seen anything like that in RoS.

2 months... or whoever long an arena season will be.
---
Right now an arena season was decided to be 2 months. But next season lengths might vary.
---
I‚Äôve been adamant on this mechanic being possible since reveal
---
Ok, I made a half freeze mage that runs biology project and that free legendary to make people draw 6 in one but that‚Äôs the best I can get.
---
Okay, I can agree with that, only noting that "too much polarization" is very much one of those subjective evaluations that is going to differ from player to player.
---
I'm not satisfied by it. Hard tech for overpowered bullshit is not satisfying balance, to me.
---
Card text can overrule keywords. Just like Competitive Spirit is a secret that triggers on your turn, even though secrets aren't supposed to be doing that.
---
I played back then too
---
Not sure if this is supposed to be a dig at me or the ones who blindly say it's good but either way this is a very real and very common thing. It even has a name. [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
---
I think this is a fair point for people to disagree on. Everyone has different preferences and different stuff they react to more or less strongly. If anything, I think I'm kind of bummed out the music is such a barrier for me, 'cause I love watching great HS content, and Dog seems like a really good creator and dude in general.
---
Why is no OTK positive? What are you smoking dude? HS at its core is a rock paper scissors game. Aggro/tempo, combo, value, midrange. The meta before this was IMO the best since it had representation of all. With no OTK decks currently, both the tempo decks and value decks don't have to worry about so they only need to gear their decks to win against each other.
---
So, I thought it worked that way too. But yesterday a guy used this spell on his 3-mana minion and summoned two different 3-mana in my game. Apparently, it does not always summon two copies of the same minion
---
6-in-one? Not sure what that one is, but you could use Vargoth, the new free legendary to get an extra cast off of the Research Project. You could also put cho in there, forcing a copy of research project into their hand, the only way they could dump it would be to cast it. You could also run [[Curio Collector]] and [[Astral Mage]] and[[Mountain Giant]] since your hand will likely be full.
---
Nah, I just hate any player that is too brain dead to make their own deck and instead just copy-pastes deck codes from whatever is tier 1 ATM.
---
This inconsistency has been in the game since [[Free From Amber]].

---
It's really not. It's a very strong card but not game breaking at all like Wild Growth or The Caverns Below.
---
Two biology projects is four, plus the proc off the free legendary adds another 2, but putting cho in the deck could be fun. If I get enough dust I think I‚Äôll do it.
---
All the shitty mechs rotated out, too, and now they get Devastators and ‚ÄúDid someone order a bomb?‚Äù in every discover and Assembly.
---
Every Rogue now hates you for ruining their 8 attack kingsbane.
---
I would be surprised if it was nerfed. It would be huge middle finger to Murloc Shaman, a deck which is pretty good but not the best. Tempo Rogue, Bomb Warrior, and Token Druid are still much better.
---
No it‚Äôs turn 7...
---
So...180 dust.
---
You‚Äôre right like in terms of getting rid of the win buttons this is the best expansion ever made. But there‚Äôs a lot of cards that are based on stale strategies. Like we did not need another treant card, which is absolutely broken, mind you, and paladin did not need another secret, which is easily the best card in that deck. Then again, though, treant Druid was kind of meh before ros because of the win buttons and now it‚Äôs meta. Is this good or bad? Depends on how you look at it
---
Personally, I‚Äôm a fan of larger and larger green men
---
Midrange Hunter is still very good.

Probably realising it was the only chance for murloc shaman to actually see serious play, because it otherwise runs out of cards way too quickly.

Just started playing this game a few days ago and am already into it. I was wondering if the classes had any counters to each other such as Hunter countering Warrior and so on, and the strategies (holding cards, playing cards, understanding your opponents deck and how to counter it) to help you win games. Thanks for the help in advance!

If they invented entirely new things like instead of treants druid got, I dunno, let's call em "bark golems" people would be pissed because there wouldn't be enough cards for it to really be a thing and they'd say blizzard was half-assing it. You have to build on existing concepts unless you're going to delete every existing card and introduce 200+ new ones.

HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ‚õè‚õè
---
Well, I feel that the best card will always be Deathstalker Rexxar. I only truly enjoyed games where I survived long enough to make the transition into this hero. It gave me hope that regardless of the maddening deck attacking me, I could divine a scenario in which I was victorious.  
---
  
---
Most of the time that didn't work, but in those few rare gems where I was offered the prime solution to a board-state, it was entirely redeeming. People might always complain about the RNG of some cards, but RNG is at the heart of this game.   
---
It gives you a shield to block the shame of defeat, and bolsters your courage of the skill you know you possess when the cards align in your favor. All of this happens in the variable darkness of its statistical likelihood, so no finite resources are consumed. As long as two players continue to engage, that heart will spin like a pinwheel.

I feel like it‚Äôs worse. You can play four in a deck due to twin spell. You don‚Äôt have to risk your minions getting silenced. It‚Äôs less mana.
---
I DESPISE these types of arguments, which too often grossly simplify people's complaints just to dismiss them.
---
People dislike losing, yes.  But what people HATE is feeling like they have no control.  Like all of their decisions are pointless.  The decks that trigger the highest number of complaints aren't necessarily the decks with the highest winrates, they're the decks that make people feel helpless (see Big Priest in Wild).

---
To be fair cards that let you cheat out minions ahead of curve (see Barnes + Res Effects and Darkest Hour in wild, for instance) is historically a problem area for hearthstone and they should be more cogniscient of the consequences of printing those cards
---
say that again when you climb past rank 15
---
&gt; Token Druid for example wasn't even a thing lately with cards like Defile and Spreading Plague in the format.
---
You kidding right ? Token Druid literally used Spreading Plague itself before the rotation. And that was truly obscene, because it meant they had a way to solidly get back into a game, even after falling way behind. Play some Token Druid right now, and you will quickly see that this kind of thing is no longer possible. The moment Token lose the board against a tempo deck like Rogue, it's utterly done for.

Among cheaper tempo cards you should go for Farseer, travelling healer, or life drinker.

I don't mind losing actually. When both the opponent and i have put some thought into our moves. Against some players though (cough*token druid) you are doing all the thinking while they just flood the board and go face
---
It‚Äôs a pretty strong deck vs control, and yes, [[Conjurer‚Äôs Calling]] is a really strong card (about the only thing Mage have going for it this expansion) 
---
But it‚Äôs absolutely terrible vs Aggro or any tempo deck.
---
Too early to be calling for nerfs, let shit settle first.

Oldschool Farseer? Lol
---
Cutglass use to be good until every deck now have 2 weapon removal. Control warrior even have 3. Lol
---
And do you honestely believe that when you lose in hearthstone it isn't because your opponent likely played better? How do explain top tier players easily reaching high legend even while trying out decks with suboptimal lists then?
---
Proceeds to hit face with the weapon,discover lightning bolt and have it hit face
---
Can you share the k-mart version?
---
Interested to try out a few games with it since I opened it in a pack.
---
true what it is still one turn and not an infinite value turn. Also requires a bit of set up to get a big board if they go long. The thing is I don't think zul jin is consistent enough.
---
I played harrison agaisnt a Jaraxxus weapon with 7 charges left, completely refueled my hand and outvalued the handlock guy.
---
This was last week.
---
That‚Äôs not secret paladin though, that‚Äôs mech paladin, totally different deck and game plan, and yes, it‚Äôs much much stronger.
---
I never understand this mentality, surely getting a class specific legendary is WORSE than getting a neutral one. With the neutral one you can put it in any class deck without restriction, so everyone is able to use it. But imagine you only have cards for one or two classes, then the class specific legendary you get is for a class you barely have any cards for, you may as well just have been given 400 mana at that rate, which is even more disappointing for a lot of players.
---
Deck sucks. If you shut down their early plays, they run out of steam pretty quick and then they are relegated to top decking. Thank god for Divine‚Äôs Favor HoF.
---
Oh pull up a chair and a cup of tea as I pour my feelings. They do change though, like this meta will, so maybe a pinch of salt would go well with that tea, or would that be too salty for you?
---
Yes it should Work Like myra where you get the deathrattleminion into your Hand - which Always felt kinda Strange...
---
They were alwayss greedy.
---
What varies is when us the consumer realizes it.
---
I've been playing this game since Beta, never once have I tried to go below 10. Know why? Because in every single meta, from launch, to the split, to any rotation so far, universally ranks 10 and below are the most griped about and miserable place in the game to be. 
---
Why some people race to those ranks, I'll never understand. Like, ooh yay, a lower rank number, and all you have to do is play this game in the most miserable fashion, reducing the fun of the game into a tedious grind of rock-paper-scissors where you're lucky to even have three options to play.
---
If you're at risk of going to a lower rank tier, switch it up, play something chancier, insta concede if you have to -- or take a break from constructed. 
---
Unless you're trying to enter the tournament scene, there's no reason to try and descend the ranks.

---
Zuljin is sadly a must. Once you have the weapon he can really close the game. Nine Lives works surprisingly well with just spiderbots, but a mechanical whelp cant hurt. The rest is pretty cheap though. I lucked into a King Crush which is nice, but i dont live or die by him.
---
And if the warlock had been luckier, he wouldn't have even been able to play a lightbomb because of nerubian unraveler(s). That warlock deck is so busted.
---
Wow.. that GM seems like a prick..
---
True. I was just trying to climb this weekend and kept getting bouched up and down.
---
Well, technically they do have paid cosmetics. Some of the heroes are store exclusive, one with the pre-purchase of the most recent expansion no less (Which wasn't cheap). But yeah I agree that the way it should be is be more generous with the packs/decks themselves, and simply have most of the cosmetic stuff be microtransactions. That way you're not locking people out from playing the game, and frankly most people would be more than happy to splash some cash for the cosmetics.
---
More often it was in midrange/zoo decks, rather than full aggro.
---
I have the same problem!
---
Have you ever had a game shorter then 15 minutes with warrior?
---
so maybe have the otk with mechathun?
---
Oh boy more dust
---
I think people complain within the first week is a little to impatient.
---
But that does mean HS is all good and all complain should be just discarded.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For example, odd decks in the last meta is no doubt a problem.
---
And we all have experience that while losing but had a good time playing a game.
---
So, losing but still have fun is definitely possible.
---
IMHO, polarize match up and oppressive decks / cards which has no way to play around are real problems.
---
They have been regularly rebalancing offering rates for like a year now. I thinkthey are preparing a fix, yes.

I enjoy Arena but I don't like the gambling aspect. Hate spending 150 gold and going 0-3 because the other decks had insane synergy and stuff.

What's a good average to aim for? Am I right in thinking about 4 to 5 wins allows you to keep earning 150 gold with quest gold included?

Bomb warrior to me feels worse than the broken shudderwock a while back. At least the shaman had to plan the battlecries and survive until shudderwock could be cancered out. With bomb warrior is AIDSy fucking RNG. You wait like an asshole playing a scantron lottery during a midterm exam.... Is this the turn I draw 3 bombs and instalose? Fuck that deck.
---
It's why I play Wild, I simply don't want to deal with rotation. I identify a deck I want, slowly build towards it, and then keep it forever and move to the next.
---

Rapid fire is a hunter card!! Geez blizzard you make me so confused sometimes :p

I expected some people to know him considering how much of Hearthstone's gameplay is alt-tabbing to watch youtube videos, but I didn't want to presume.

Blizzards attempt to make us play Paladin? :thinking:

I just don't get it.

Impossible!  No one has ever been able to summon the 6 attack Shaman!

no but for real. thats pretty cool
---
Whether it would see play would be heavily meta dependent. If the meta was heavily control priest-warrior then it might be cut for other options like highmane because it would be removed too consistently. If the meta was heavily into midrange or aggro then it would probably see play. It would work well against control that was teched against wide and not tall and against other midrange that didn‚Äôt draw into removal. That said, it would probably be on the OP side since if unanswered it could do 20 damage over two turns and might be a bit problematic combined with tundra rhino. Also very all or nothing since if it is removed efficiently it hurts your tempo really bad. For example, it would match up very poorly against Murloc shaman running the gives poisonous murloc. It would probably need to lose the beast tag and maybe drop to an 8/8 or 9/9 so it isn‚Äôt doing a full 1/3 or your health with each attack, but considering cards like pre-nerf corridor Creeper have been printed it could probably see print. Honestly compares pretty reasonably to pre-nerf bone mare as well. 1 less mana for no partial charge on stats and greater weakness to single target removal.

What do you consider the avg player or how many games a day. Each game taking about 6-7 mins you can probably play 4-5 games per hour. If you win 3 games per hour that's 30g (10g a win) and it would take you 3 hours for 1 pack. I dont think thats too far of a reach. Maybe 2 hours plus daily quest. It would probably just take 1.5 hours with the daily quest to get 1 pack. 
---
Listen I talk all the time about paying for entertainment and comparing what ppl get out a game time wise. Most pay pennies on the hour for their game time. Maybe not all games but overall and a lot of games just charge for cosmetics. Give creators and developers their due but keeping the customer coming back is their main goal. That means you gotta give a little. 
---
Half the dust back from a card is not that crazy because you still gotta buy packs to get a decent amount of dust or play hours on end to get packs. If people got more back sire they might buy less but i think they would buy more because they feel they are getting more back. 
---
All just an opinion.

I just hate when she discovers herself ;_;

oh man, I hate that Thekal is a legendary. If it was an epic, Heal Paladin would be so much more consistent.
---
Missplay, should Ragnarocked harder.
---
Yes, I agree but how do you survive until turn 7?
---
Token druid is with them too i forgot to mention that, but it gets annihilated by tempo rogue
---
Depends, on the cards that you have. I would say that the meta is a bit more forgiving for budget decks at the higher ranks as there are less infinite value cards aside from control. There are some crazy combos out there. If you are budget, you can go silence priest or even zoo(even though the current zoo has quite a bit of epics). If you're on the NA, I would be happy to add you and give you a few practice rounds. You can test the decks against me if you like. I really enjoy the theory crafting of  decks and generally trying to help out the community.  Except control warrior... I know some people enjoy that deck, but boy do I not enjoy playing a deck can be summed up as being a stop sign.
---
Rhogarj#21590 EU 80G quest, I'll show you my quest then you go first.
---
It's Zentimo, actually. Reads 'Spells YOU cast.' You are not Swampqueen's horror.
---
Still worse than 4 mana 7/7 LUL
---
So I have been trying to figure out a fun deck which makes juicy psychemelon and doomsayer Dorian useful along with certain draw cards. It‚Äôs impossible to get out but the idea is to use Dorian to summon spell damage (if he is still alive to use melon) when you cast melon. Then smash face with low cost spells.
---
No luck so far but been pretty fun trying to conceive the idea
---
Why doesn‚Äôt ‚ÄùDestroy‚Äù spell destroy it? Like wipe him off completely instead of put him dormant?
---
Might wanna try it
---
Also opened Kingsbane and Valanyr so no complains there :)
---
Not sure if that was a good idea if you wanted to buy everything. It will cost 700g per wing, so with 4 wings (technically 5, but 1 will be free) it will be 2800g. It might be pretty hard to get that much in ~3 weeks.
---
By anti-social I mean that there is no upside to interacting with your opponent in any way. Theres no teamplay so the game inherently becomes this. 
---
Whenever I play HS I feel im playing againsta bot, except when they emote like crazy which for me, is also a bad experience.
---
I sen to this game from playing Dota, CS, WoW etc. highly social games.
---
Haha, true. I was more comparing it's effect, but yeah Guldan is way better.
---
If the average goes from 20 to 10, as you suggested, then players would receive twice as many legendaries.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for CSGO as I don‚Äôt play it, but Dota might be the worst example for antisocial games. It‚Äôs a game where unless you cooperate, you almost always lose, and the game has 3 different built in communication tools.
---
Actually true

I think I'm too young of a player. I joined when boomsday was the current set, so I don't know the context.

 Zakazeu #1662 NA 80g quest trade. I show, you go first.

Yeah, I mean, it's the kind of card I wish was playable, but it's hard to find pleasure in a shitty 8-mana weapon, I guess.
---
ctrl+v big priest
---
Just good old fashioned virtue signalling. "Hey everyone, look at me, I'm grateful - not like all the entitled kids these days".
---
I came to this game from playing Dota, CS, WoW etc. highly social games.
---
who knows
---
According to hsreplay as well, it's about 50/50. 50.6% winrate on the druid's side. but that is on all ranks.

I feel like you're missing the irony here.

Random tidbit no one cares about : a few years ago I used to play in a cybercaf√©. You could always tell the CS (not GO back then) players by the noise level and the fact that more often than not they left with fewer friends than they had coming in.

I think Lazul's motivation is also a little bit unclear, she predicted the Old Gods resurfacing and seems to have some dark connections but we don't really know what she wants. She might already have an idea of where this is all going and is just playing along.

---
Sure but if you consider you need 200+$ for a full expansion 3 times a year (600+$ a year), you realize the pricing is fucking ridiculous and 10 packs and a legendary can't change that. (it's not even close lol). 
---
-
---
I mean imagine you have to play the price of 3-5 games for one expansion EVERY 3 MONTHS if you want everything.
---
And the irony here is that I spent more on Gwent in a couple of months than I spent on Hearthstone in a couple of years. When the game economy is so good it kind of feels right to support the game. And I'm a mid level spender, I spend maybe 500-600$ per year on games, but the ONLY time I preordered Hearthstone is when they put 80 packs for 50$, and then I got the 5$ starter pack and that's pretty much it. 
---
Their actual idea of an amazing deal is 50$ for 50 packs...
---
And I'm sorry but you being glad about 20 packs is kind of pathetic (no offense). Maybe you don't know better. 
---
It's really a shame, the game is actually good. But it's really only accessible for the bigger spenders. I don't know what's better for business though, being generous or being greedy. If you're generous you attract more people like me and you get more smaller spenders. If you stay like this you attract only the bigger ones. But one thing is certain, the bigger spenders would also benefit from generosity so maybe we should be united on this point.

they sort of auto win control match ups.
---
Facts bro.
---
He is insane if he survives a turn. The problem is there is too much aggro, that's why you don't get to play him. In contrast, in a control meta he probably won't survive the turn against removal. So yeah, it's hard to evaluate, but the potential if he stays on board is too big to call the card weak.
---
Even worse, the mobile app still is a dumpster fire. I have yet to remain connected through an entire game. I know it's not my device or network because I play other connection-dependent games with no issues. I constantly lose games without knowing that I disconnected because it happens on my opponent's turn. By the time I realize, force quit, wait for the game to reopen, and reconnect I've missed an entire turn at least and the game is done.
---
The game is in maintenance mode. They'll churn out new expansions as long as people keep spending $80 every couple months but it will never have any in-depth development or enhancements. Everything about Hearthstone now scream minimum viable product.

Yea, I was going to make a post the other day calling it the strongest card of the set. I don't think many people predicted that.
---
yea, all I'm seeing are token druids and other warriors, with the occasional hunter mixed in.
---
And to add to that, it's the hardcore, upper rank people doing this.  A rank 12 person doesn't give a shit about losing rank, so you have slightly tweaked meta decks with high rank people playing them. 
---
Fun.

2/3/2 | Battlecry: Shuffle 3 copies of a friendly minion into your deck.  
---
Their standard cards put golden legendaries of HS to shame. It is not even fair to compare the premium legendaries which really has sleek animation
---
Blizzard isn't interested in getting people addicted to being friendly.
---
that's a fine plan too!  But in reality, there's nothing wrong with playing T1 and T2 competitive decks in casual
---
I play control decks in high MMR casual just to piss of aggro net deckers.
---
That phone battery tho
---
Malygos
---
But we already do a "Well Played" after an epic match, that should count correct?
---
Fuck me, right... Would have been too easy. Back to the drawing board for now...
---
Just my guess since I don't play other card games, but losing in Hearthstone to me feels terrible because there is literally nothing to gain from it. I don't know how other card games deal with that. 
---
Assuming you have all classes at level 60 and no quests, there is no experience to gain for anything, no gold or dust gained, just nothing. Doesn't matter how long the match was that you lost, either. You see the defeat pop-up and that's it, plus have a star lost if in ranked. 
---
Hearthstone really should implement some kind of system that rewards you for playing matches, whether or not you lose. It might require reworking the whole reward system structure, but if it helps alleviate the awful feeling from losing since you would at least get *something* from it, it should be looked into. As far as botters goes, since that would be an obvious issue, Blizzard would need to get off their lazy behinds and crack down on them.

3/1/5 | Combo: Add two random Lackeys to your hand.  
---
I've come across that deck a couple times, while its a cool idea it looks like its impossible to survive against Aggro. Druid has lost most of his important defensive tool and that already shows. It's still almost an auto-win vs control decks but due to the polarity of this deck's match-ups I think this deck will never be good on ladder
---
Arguable. Aggro decks are usually decided in the Mulligan and just happen to have a high coin flip win percentage. 
---
It's not really a complicated question to ask yourself if you should play the warpath or not, it's just a matter of whether or not you have it.
---
Listen my friends list is full of randos I met on HS and some of them are top legend players I didnt know that when I added them. One of them even coached me on how to play his deck not everyone is bad.
---
I want mid match chat with my opponent, either to lol with them or to threaten them
---
Lol you completely took that the wrong way. What's with the chip on a lot of people's shoulders here about Blizzard thinking they're stupid? It's bizarre. 
---
It's not because players are stupid and can't mentally keep up with those changes, it's that players without the time or money to keep up with their decks getting wiped out every month wouldn't bother logging in at all. This happened to me after I took a break from Shadowverse for a year or so. The game got absurdly expensive like Hearthstone has and they do balance changes every month. I came back, put time and money into crafting the cheapest meta deck there was, and it got nerfed a week later. Know what I did next? I uninstalled for the second and final time. 
---
I know it isn't easy to see this as a problem as an enfranchised player with a large collection, but Blizzard will see a massive dip in new/returning player numbers if the game were constantly shifting like that.
---
I believe this is the OP's point. If your opponent exhibited good sportsmanship, you can let them know by offering the 5 dust. If you do not want to encourage your opponent's behavior, you can deny yourself the opportunity for 5 dust by not sending the GG which sends the message you were displeased by something your opponent did or didn't do.
---
You can add people after an actual good game, usually their are a good sport about it, if not you can always exclude them, i made a good friend there actually
---
I'm glad you've had better interactions than me, but my experience has been pretty poor unfortunately
---
I play casual when I‚Äôm still trying to understand a new deck. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for... experimenting in a rank free setting.
---
I think I played you! I thought you were playing secret pally, then got surprised with duel. I thought the deck was really cool and original. You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs really easy to lose to you as a bomb warrior, but I think I clutched a win. Did you ever lose to a bomb warrior?
---
if you like playing decks that can compete with all other decks, I think Control Shaman is the archetype you want. Games are long though.
---
You wouldve gotten this message if you clicked on the greyed out decks.
---
I like to hit a rank floor then just meme it up
---
Thats not true .. i got 2 legendaries from these free packs (golden emires and bomzooka hunter spell)
---
On the draw:
---
Hand is prep, mimiic podx2, pilfer and coin.
---
Prep pod for 2 preps.
---
Prep pod for 2 counterfeit coins
---
Prep coin concede.
---
I give up. I'm sure there's a way.
---
Aye, I had this glitch happen too, was hoping the fixed it with the expansion lol
---
Yes I played a few games with it (had to craft preps and edwin) but it feels fun.
---
If it were 9 mana, people wouldn't run banker, would they?
---
I think a more fitting game theory for this example would be The Ultimatum Game, where an individual can cost themself the chance at 5 dust to let their opponent know they would rather not get 5 dust than reward their opponent's decision making.

**Ultimatum game**
---
The ultimatum game is a game that has become a popular instrument of economic experiments. It was first described by Werner G√ºth, Rolf Schmittberger, and Bernd Schwarze: One player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money. The proposer is tasked with splitting it with another player, the responder. Once the proposer communicates their decision, the responder may accept it or reject it.

Carpet is indeed what I was referring to. I think you can lower the health by 1 and still make it viable. It's super powerful right now.
---
What an asshole.
---
You seem intelligent.
---
&gt;one of the things I really love about the game has nothing to do with the gameplay at all
---
Just to push your thinking a bit, I want to convince you this absolutely is a part of game play. From the moment you open the app, you're experiencing features, graphics, and processes that the developers and designers have put into place. Just like deckbuilder is a part of Hearthstone, the social aspects are, too. And having a "good game" message with a little dust tip definitely would affect other aspects of using Hearthstone. It would also affect the game play. Maybe people spam fewer emotes on the hope of that tip. Maybe they still spam, but the cooler players can recognize and tip each other when they find each other.
---
I don't think it's unfair to keep calling actually finding an opponent and playing a round "playing a game," but I think it's important to recognize how the non-competitive features influence and matter to overall game play.
---
Toki?
---
Thanks!
---
I had that ONE GAME. It also pulled an unraveler which made the priests mass hysteria useless on turn 5 so he was 4 turns away from any board clear. It felt so horrible but so right.
---
Casual isn‚Äôt my playground since they introduced wild, I‚Äôll go to wild if I want to experiment but even there you get the ladder fearing players playing a tier1 standard deck and revelling in their advantage/lack of imagination, they don‚Äôt even bother putting in anything wild? Could there be anything less wild?  
---
If you can‚Äôt escape the same few oppressive decks every single game in any mode (even iterations of it through clumsy blizzard drafting in arena) then blizzard needs to change something fundamentally.
---
Only the best of the best can draw the right card for the right situation.
---
No don't worry, it obviously has its flaws but it's way better than the videos that normally get posted here, some of them are just straight up unwatchable, this is pretty good, I put it on while playing and it's nice because your voices are nice, it sucks when podcasts have people with unpleasant voices, especially when you have to concentrate. 
---
Everything very calm an analytic like it should be. Very, hope to see you get better in the future!
---
I would remember and call you a coward for not accepting immediately.
---
0.913%

Assuming the same scenerio of 3 spells in the deck and 25 cards left 
---
I apologise to anyone if this is wrong couldn't write anything down , doing this on my phone
---
People only ran Gluttonous Ooze because they couldn't run ASO in a Keleseth deck.
---
&gt; The two effects activate in order of play, but the outcome is the same regardless because when Doomsayer kills all minions, they are not removed from play instantaneously.
---
There's the edge case of [[Meanstreet Marshal]] caring whether it gets buffed before death or not. With him on board, you'd want the secret to activate before the Doomsayer.
---
Did this before except I waited a week to accept. Guy still flamed me but didn't seem like he remembered the exact game.

---

Prolly secret paladin, seems to have a high winrate right now
---
It‚Äôs a good card in the murloc shaman matchup because their murlocs already cost 1, so a 0 mana murloc means next to nothing to them.
---
If you can't converse like an adult and don't comment at all, please.
---
That's only because you're playing with friends. You can get that experience in HS if you do the same. If you really crave socialization, go to fireside gatherings. They're extremely social and usually friendly.   
---
But in an online game where you're being matched up against strangers and where you're playing a zero sum game, expecting sociality is not really a reasonable expectation. Adding social features (putting aside this Gwent idea, which I do like) is usually just going to be a conduit to toxicity, and who wants that?

Outside of Boom, which would require them to drop more bombs, bomb warrior doesn't have much value, they could probably just fatigue you though.

Something about being a virgin if you play a certain card in week 1.

It's completely different this year.  You get a random deck (like the usual Crossroads brawl) but it also contains a bunch of these:

* Room Bot: Magnetic, Taunt, Deathrattle: Summon 3 1/1 Boom Bots.

* Doom Bot: Battlecry and Deathrattle: Death 5 damage to ALL minions.

Mate playing aggro isn't as easy as you think. In Hearthstone as opposed to other card games, it is a bit more beneficial as there's no blocking mechanic. But I implore you try zoo decks yourself. A lot more decision making goes into them than you might think. Of course brainless archetypes like Odd Paladin exist, but give it a try, you might learn something from the enemy...

BTW, "Death 5 damage" is their typo, not mine.  So don't go issuing me any minor_corrections.

No. Fucking. Way. And here's why.   
---
You're an asshole. I will keep calling you an asshole from this point forward even though you didn't do anything to deserve it, and I won't stop. You can block me, but I've already put some sourness in your head. I can do that because I don't know you and I don't care how I'm making you feel because I'm already angry at you. Asshole.   
---
Now lets multiple that over N games and replace "asshole" with some truly vile assertions.
---
Has anyone really used thanks at the end of a game in a sincere way tho
---
I've gone from 24 to 15 now, and in 19 matches I've seen 8 bomb warriors. They're so fucking obnoxious to play against, the Boom hero card is stupid OP.
---
Not at all. The mirror comes down to who made the greedier list. What resources are you even saving? Warriors decks don‚Äôt have many threats
---
Gwent‚Äôs emotes are way more passive aggressive than hearthstone‚Äôs though.
---
Cthun and double battlecry works real well.  Hang in there, it took me over 100 bosses to get priest, it took a lot longer than the others.

Ever heard of Japan?

The official reason is because the event is Dr Boom themed.  The new brawl involves 3 types of Egg Boom Bots.
---
Wait for the meta to stabilize a bit more
---
Their business model on this case was to call it a beta for a few weeks to justify more egregious prices
---
GG you got 10k not crafting any cards all expansion and spent every day grinding out daily quest for a year. Now you get to finally play with 2-4 meta decks out of the over 18+ meta decks. This is after playing through 3 different expansions.

Weaponshaman OP!
---
No seriously, shaman has a lot of weapons...
---
Only to a certain point. Whales need something to eat, after all, and other whales are bad eating. 
---
You need some minnows (I.E. those disgusting Free To Play plebs who attempt to play a free game for ***free***, the nerve (/s)) for them to show off their stuff to and actually play with, or they'll get bored of long wait queues and drift off to a better sea (game) which has more minnows.
---
So you want at least a decent player base, even if it's mostly free to plays, because it keeps the whales around. Basically the whales are the customers, but the free to play fishes are the product.
---
^(God I know too much about being a business bastard, don't I.)
---
^^Also ^^why ^^are ^^they ^^minnows ^^and ^^not ^^krill ^^stupid ^^business ^^bastards
---
Yes, otherwise I imagine people will complain that they sent 5 dust to some jerk who didn‚Äôt send any back.
---
If you believe hard enough!
---
I have played Gwent and the system there worked exactly how the OP describes it in his post. People would constantly not send you the GG back out of spite because they didn't like the deck you were playing or because they lost.
---
Why is it a sad regression when most of the time it's just going to be there so that salty players an hurl slurs at me? If you want people to chat with, make friends on discord, friend them in game, and then you can chat all of them up to your hearts content. But opening chat to strangers who are, nine out of ten times, just going to be toxic assholes does not strike me as any kind of regression.
---
Yeah because youre actually sitting face to face with your opponent. No amount of changes in HS would replicate this even slightly.
---
It also gets people to buy all the RoS packs they need now.
---
Then when the expansion launches you indirectly buy another 15 RoS packs that you otherwise weren't gonna buy.
---
I guess what I'm saying is imagine if the single player content launched with RoS.  You'd get those 15 packs immediately and probably cut 15 from your total purchase.
---
I love the RNG in the game. It‚Äôs why I play it more than Magic honestly. It can be annoying, but it makes each game seem more fresh. I can totally get why people don‚Äôt enjoy it though. It‚Äôs just a much different experience than I‚Äôve been able to experience with physical card games.

No. Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan rotate out sometime next year 2020 (Around April Im guessing).
---
As someone who plays bomb warrior, the guy above you is just a jerk.
---
I'm with you on points 2 and 3, so just addressing point 1, even if they removed all RNG cards from the game, RNG is still going to be a huge factor in your games - in which cards you draw and the order you draw them in, and likewise for your opponent. 
---
Losing to a 1 in 20/30/etc outcome can be annoying, but at least there is a funny side to it. The really frustrating games are when you've equipped your deck to be really good in a certain match up but then just die a slow frustrating death because you don't draw the cards you need. E.g. sticking 6 aoes in your deck to deal with flood decks and drawing none of them by turn 6-8 despite hard mulliganing for them. Those are the games that make me hit Alt + F4, when your bad RNG stretches over a whole 5-10 minute game getting worse and worse, not the instantaneous bad RNG.
---
The RNG cards are sometimes too powerful, but remove them from the game and it would be much less fun. Firstly the draw RNG will be more pronounced and (as well as in my opinion being worse) it has the same issue - what can you learn from losing simply because you drew poorly or they drew amazingly? Secondly, it will make rock-paper-scissors meta more inevitable and more pronounced without cards like Rafaam.

Can you blame people though? I've accepted about 20 friend requests after a match. Only one has been pleasant, and I knew it was going to be because we had a 45 minute match that was very fun. Now I don't accept friend requests
---
Plenty of Warriors have her, because you basically automatically win the mirror if the opponent Warrior doesn't have it.
---
There are no special deck recipes for wild, so yes, it is the same in both formats.
---
Hum, that would definitely change the interpretation of getting a good game. It would go from 'shaking hands with the opposing players after the game' to 'you, Sir or Madam, are one of the greatest players I have ever seen, using a fantastically creative and interesting deck that shows you are a master deck builder. Regardless of whether I have won or lost this past game, I am sure that it is one of the best games I shall ever have.'
---
Of course, this will make it even easier for mean players to chalk up their lack of good game rewards to something other than 'I'm a huge jerk'; if even the nice, creative players can go a dozen games without getting a 'good game', surely their 10,547 game streak without a reward is a sign that all their *opponents* just never have the available rewards, and not that emoting several dozen times to mock said opponents leads to the opponent's ruling them out as good game recipients. (Although, how many things are actually going to change how the worst players act, anyway?)
---
The time I tried this (waited about 2 weeks, IIRC) he started describing in some detail a game I no longer remembered. The only difference it made to the rant, as far as I could tell, was that the first message was "finally", then he just went off on me as if it'd been 2 minutes since the game instead of 2 weeks...
---
How many lackeys are there? I‚Äôve only played a handful of RoS games so far but I‚Äôve only seen 2 and most of the time its the deal 2 damage one.
---
Yeah I wasn't sure if that was played before. It was available in Ungoro but was really bad. I don't know if it was viable prior to that so I omitted it.
---
I'm not a Hearthstone pro or a long-time TCG player. I have always kind of liked card games but I don't have the brain space needed for the chess-like strategy to be good enough to play any of these games long term. In fact, the only card game I've ever played this long is Hearthstone.
---
The simplicity of the cards is what drew me to it initially. It just made sense - you have a minion to play or a spell to play. You drop a minion and then you hit things with that minion. I didn't have to build special kinds of "mana" to play certain cards. I didn't have to turn any cards sideways or put things in a "graveyard" or anything. I just played the cards and hit "End Turn." I could never figure out any kind of way to play games like Magic, but this game didn't need much thinking to at least play it out. To be good, yes, you need to be smart, but to just play, you don't need much.
---
I stopped playing for a couple of expansions and then my cousin got into it around Whispers and I jumped back in because I had someone to play with. All of the RNG that was added at that time (and in the time since I had started in the beta) really made the game exciting! Even when I was getting dunked on by pure luck, I never thought it was bullshit (at least, not after I had a few minutes of venting). It doesn't matter how much RNG there is, there will always be a chance of getting exactly what someone needs - I mean, top-decking is the first RNG in any card game and there is always saltiness when you lose to a top-deck.
---
When I see posts like these I sometimes am sympathetic (especially after a series of really bad beats to RNG, etc.) and I think read along saying, "Yeah!" But, then I see people's counter-arguments and I read those and think, "Yeah!" It's really got me thinking that maybe all of these complaints are missing the point? Maybe you're just complaining about a kind of game you don't like to play? I mean, I like to play Monopoly but I understand why people hate it because it seems like there's only so much strategy you can use until the dice decides the game for you. But, then my friends who complain about it just don't play it. They find other board games that rely less on dice and more on strategy.
---
So I guess I'm just asking, "why not just play a game that is more suited to the style of card game you like to play?"
---
PS. I am absolutely not saying that Hearthstone (or any game) should not be critiqued and I do think your comments are valid and fair. But, there comes a point when the complaints you have about HS are never addressed by the designers and maybe that means they don't see them as problems? Maybe they designed the game this way on purpose?
---
Based off of stats aggregated by HSreplay? I don't know what is the point of your post XD.
---
Yeah /r/ArenaHS/ is going nuts because of how badly blizzard has decided to handle micro-adjustments and bucketing and the arena philosophy in general.
---
I had the thought recently that when the game is ending the "hello" emote could turn into a "good game" emote. I always want to say that at the end of games, and when I win saying "well played" sounds a little BM.
---
What's the value breakdown of the new adventure coming out?
---
4. Deal 2 damage, Give a minion +1 attack and rush, Summon a random 2 cost minion, Transform a minion into one that costs 1 more.
---
&gt;I'm not talking about it being 1.02
---
You're not? Because just a moment ago you said:
---
&gt;And if you don't want it, it's worth the bare minimum, which is still more than 1 gold = 1 dust
---
His comment implies dusting cards based on versatility/usefulness, and the Archmage is a good epic used in multiple decks right now.  Maybe in the future it falls out of favor, but at present, it's a useful card.

Other control decks can compete, but there's little to no reason to unfortunately. Pretty much any class can 'last' that long and churn out that many resources (via Seance/Shudderwork/Baleful/Youthful &amp; Archivist, or Plot Twist Elekk, or Togg's Scheme/Elekk &amp; Espionage), but there is no reason to try and beat the slow match-up since it will always hit the turn limit.

I had a Rogue opponent shuffle 13 Zilliax into their deck, and after those they shuffled 15 more. Didn't matter, hit the turn limit. There's basically no reason to commit any further into the late game than Archivist and a way to bounce her once.
---
You're right! Editted!
---
They said that Whizbang won‚Äôt become classic. But that instead they plan to rotate cards similar to him through sets. There is going to be one released in RoS in the solo adventure.
---
Uhh. I swear one of the two I‚Äôve seen is discover a spell.
---
Yeah, but that relies on drawing and playing him before you draw a bunch of bombs.  Because a bomb warrior can easily generate 3-6 bombs in your deck by turn 7, it's very possible you've already taken 10-15 damage just for bombs, let alone any chip face damage from their tempo play.
---
And if you get the wrong legendaries from Rafaam, it's very possible they can finish you off from there.
---
How does one even hijack a comment section? You're replying to MY comment.....
---
In my very first comment I said it's on mobile, then you denied it, and I reiterated that yes it does exist. You missing the part where I initially said MOBILE is not my problem, and denying that it's a feature is factually incorrect when it IS a feature on mobile, the version I clearly indicated that I was talking about. 
---
I have a strong feeling you're an idiot.
---
I think the whole not adding someone because you know they‚Äôre mad thing is weird.
---
I came from Gears of War and Halo where everyone was yelling at each other. It‚Äôs not that scary to have some guy be mad at you in a game. Especially one like this where sometimes you really do win off of some no skill bs. 
---
Hearthstone needs to embrace the salt more as a community and be cool with it because it encourages players to get salty with all of the RNG. 
---
But we end up relating salt to toxicity. 
---
I think we should be able to chat in game via Mic or Text and if the other person is just being annoying we could mute them like in CoD.
---
I have no time for eggs!
---
It discounts the bomb. The bomb blows itself up, and poof goes the discount. That one makes sense. This does not.
---
All but three can be done with just simple murloc decks. Warrior is big minion and alarmo bot. For Druid you need jade idol, it‚Äôs cheap.
---
It really is a shame that more people don`t know about ArenaHS but its a lovely little community. And yup, exactly, those two and the GrinningGoat are where I spend any time I have free for twitch :)
---
Hmm, you could just swap Oondasta with Ysera. Or, if you have 2x damaged stegodons and zilliax you could replace the 2x bears and oondasta (since the bears are kinda paired with her). For a non-legendary option, try Burly Shovelfist or Big Bad Archmage.
---
People always bitch about Aviana, but against midrange matchups, it REALLY ISNT THAT BAD. It's terrible against control and a tad too slow vs aggro, but against Zoo or Murlocs or whatever, Aviana is passable. Hard removal is hard to come by in midrange decks, and if they hard trade into it, you tend to come out ahead. If they DON'T trade into it, they plop 2 minions on the field and you can go fucking nutso on your turn. It can be ridiculous.
---
You drop down 4 ranks every new season, so if you finished at 15 you‚Äôd move back to 19 etc etc. But you won‚Äôt drop below 15/10/5 during the current season once you reach those ranks.
---
I'm pretty sure Glinda or Tundra Rhino can break something. Both the mechanics they allow just feel like they force you to be very careful in designing cards.
---
I'm not sure what -- maybe Tundra Rhino gives potential for a inner fire combo without 1 turn set up?. Both plus shirvallah can (eventually, with coin?) be a ton of charge damage from hand
---
If not just counting spells and including wild, weapons like Twig (and \[\[Aluneth\]\], but less so) would be very powerful if they could be broken at will by playing a new weapon. Consistent 10 mana by turn 5, especially factoring in weapon tutoring
---
Someone recently posted an interaction between \[\[Krag'wa\]\] and \[\[Shadowstep\]\] that also seems too easy to abuse, even if its expensive
---
Twisting a criticism inti a compliment is a bit if a red flag 2bh.
---
Once you get on rank 15, you cant fall on 16 ever again in same season. Same goes for rank 20, 10, 5 and legend rank. However, monthly reset still send you 4 ranks below your peak, so if rank 15 is best rank you got, you'll end up on rank 19 after reset.
---
Yeah fully agree... I tried making a post yesterday about emotes and BM and I got shit on lol.
---
Most everyone agrees and knows that emoting "hi" after you've in a winning position is just trolling.  Or when they just emote on my turn 3 times..  yet people defend it by saying they like to try to tilt their opponent or basically have this place to be a dick...
---
It's like a friend of mine was telling me about 4chan.  I've never once gone to that website, but he said there's channels there where people just go off on each other for fun.
---
There  is no counter to big priests aside from agro...so sorry that your narrative doesn't apply.

---

---
Yeah, but by that logic Geist wasn't a counter to Jade Idol because the can draw and play a bunch of idols before you draw Geist. Card draw RNG can ruin any hard counter, but when played right, Rafaam is a hard counter to bombs.
---
Today I realised something while playing. I used to play control warrior and actually enjoyed the game since the  new expansion released. I teched it super greedy to beat other Elyysiana decks. I was winning and losing and reached rank 2 today.  I then thought of experimenting with some murloc shaman and token druid due to a recent post on Reddit and HSReplay listing it as Tier 1 deck. Also I had hunter cards quest so started with that.
---
And now for the first time in past week I for frustrated and quit HS for today. And that was mainly due to 3 matches:
---
1. Me as Much Hunter vs Rogue where the rogue got 6-3 weapon and cold blood on minions which connected twice. The game was over so fast. He had sap and that was the end of it. 
---
2 and 3rd matches I was playing as Murloc Shaman. In one game I was facing 12-6 something hyena on turn 4 and I another game my opponent made a decent Edwin on turn 2 and I didn't have toxfin. 
---
So at least for me I think I have bias for playing control decks. I don't want to play aggro v aggro mirrors, or even against control since everything depends on your Mulligan RNG apart from Juggler RNG. It felt like the game was decided at the start and I felt so triggered and helpless. Whereas playing 30-40 min ling games with warrior never tilted me. 
---
Even though people now will say "You don't know how to play aggro.. " "Get better at the game, aggro vs aggro is very skill intensive" , I say I can't endure playing such fast decks which gets decided in 3-4 turns. It doesn't even feel like I played anything. This is the only thing that tilts me. When I play faster decks while trying to climb ladder. Otherwise I am actually in love with the game since 2 years.
---
What are you playing?
---
It may be wrong but I actually enjoy a good level of RNG in this game. The randomness kinda keeps it interesting for me.
---
You know, Gwent does this. Except what they give you is the equivalent of 5 gold. It‚Äôs amazing.
---
I struggled hard trying to fight the urge to put Holy Wrath in here. It's definitely fun, but if you want to climb you'll see it whiffing a lot or waiting around in your hand a lot :/
---
There is some merit to trying to find a version that draws more cards faster, and tosses in Baleful Banker for a big slam finale. I couldn't figure it out but maybe you can.
---
Even if they‚Äôre right, not every competitive advantage is worthy of having been gained.
---
If I have to be a dick to win 1% more games, I shall gladly lose 1% more games.
---
I play a lot of rocket league.  People are toxic, but at least you can talk or respond better.  If my teammate is toxic, I can sabotage his ability to win.  If people are toxic, I can call them out, rally the other players to call him out.  And best of all, everyone can report the player.
---
I've definitely won at least one game against a Bomb Warrior because of Rafaam in my zoo deck.  Although that may just have been because I was pressuring them enough earlier and was able to drop a \[\[Cult Master\]\] and trade off a bunch of minions to fill up my hand enough to increase my chances of high-rolling my random legendaries.
---
Anyways, I've run into almost twice as many Token Druids and Tempo/Thief Rogues, and Rafaam as definitely helped against the latter.
---
Good riddance
---
The RNG is a huge part of this game, more than others.  That's an intentional design.  
---
That's like saying "people are frustrated by the roulette wheel because they feel like when they don't guess correctly there's nothing they're learning from it"... well that's the design of the roulette wheel.

4/4/2 | After a friendly minion dies, draw a card.  
---
And for my next turn I summon and even bigger green man!
---
IT'S OS OR THEM, CRUSADAH. OS, OR THEM!
---
This makes me feel the opposite of amazing
---
And I think any mechanic that is pretty much draw dependant and ends the game turn 5 or earlier is game ruining. To each their own.
---
Yes. I opened it and scargil shaman is bloody awesome!
---
UBERTHRUSTER! For the last time, blow up the wizards, NOT ME!
---
If you were playing Loatheb on curve 90% of the time, you were doing it wrong.  
---
Very wrong.
---
Sorry dude my post is based upon the last 5 years of constant complants on this sub.
---
I'm quite happy with my performance thank you
---
Did he get em?
---
No. I like having both options available. It's good to have variety.
---
üíØ if I'm winning a match because my opponent tilted over my actions... That's not an outcome I desire.  I'll lose every game before I willingly try to piss off the other player to get a win in a game that means nothing.
---
This would be amazing! It would make the social experience of the game better if you can send a ‚ÄúGood Game‚Äù emote to people and not have the think you‚Äôre BMing them.
---
Instantly.  Shadow word death.  Game over.
---
In response to point number 3:
---
It‚Äôs easy dude just play around Shudderwock. /s
---
I think this is the reason hearthstone revenue plummeted over the last year.
---
I mean, it's a fucking card game. That's like the one type of game I would seriously expect to have a large social aspect to it.
---
Combine that with the fact that there hasn't been any new modes or anything since Tavern Brawl... honestly crazy.
---
I play games to play with players. There isn't any difference between playing against a very advanced AI as it stands right now.
---
Why?
---
Thanos is also a literal Thanos
---
He killed my little (big) squirrel instantly.  For that, I‚Äôll never forgive BigBoobs.
---
Things will always shift some throughout the set but from what I've seen midrange hunter is pretty solid and will probably always be fairly solid. Just look around at some different decks and find one you think would be fun.
---
What takes longer? Raising a child? A 40 hour work week? Or playing control warrior?
---
Just you or is that something from a site like hsreplay ?
---
And on how many games ?
---
Look it up on hsreplay
---
Yea, I did. Problem is I made bomb warrior and Rez priest. As well as some warrior legends I wanted to try. So it‚Äôll take a little bit, but I‚Äôll get there
---
its a tough matchup in terms of thinking but its not impossible. Statistically, its 51% favor of Token Druid.
---
Also remember that there's only two war paths. And the rest of the AoEs are useless against Soul of the Forest.
---
[[Vivid Nightmare]] ?
---
I love big paladin in wild, with call to adventure, prismatic lense and duel!. But one of the best cards in the deck is \[\[rebuke\]\], since i can coin it out with barnes turn 5 and with it along some secrets from previous turns, i can make an unbreakable board that will 99% stay there at your next turn, and protecting stuff like an ysarg or lich king can get out of hand quick. I know darkes hour warlock can do better/faster and more unbreakable boards, but I dont see anyone playign this deck and its pretty consistent in getting a barnes highroll turn, in fact most of the time i get barnes, its rare when I start slow and have to resort to hardcasting my minions.
---
She had counters yes, and guldan was amazing, but between things like voodoo doll and polymorph, along with fire eater and making favorable trades she could refill a board pretty fast while removing yours.

---
It‚Äôs such a fun deck to play, but so terrible against some of the more popular Aggro decks right now.
---
I even teched 2 MCT‚Äôs and one more defender to have a better chance, but it‚Äôs dicey. Mage lost the really good board clears and it hurts.
---
Swipe is also good sometimes to remove a taunt or just to burn
---
In addition, consider that those board clears are also prevalent in Bomb Warrior which is more favored towards Token Druid. This suggests that board clears are not the only reason why the matchup is close.
---
Darkest Hour Warlock
---
Hunting Party Hunter
---
Then you play another Swipe. Duh.

You know what most card games have that's different from hearthstone? Phsyciallity. If I beat you in a card game in the real world and and call me a faggot nigger cuck, I break your nose. You do that over an online game, you auto mute and block me, then go beat off in self satisfaction. Imo, there is no point in online interaction in an online card game beyond third party forums. This is the community interaction right here with all the highs and lows you'd expect. No point in wasting resources to add it to hearthstone or magic arena or whatever.
---
Congrats man! I‚Äôm at 397/500 myself! Getting there
---
Put all the key cards in the deck, then have the deck maker finish the deck for you. (Assuming you have all the cards) the deck builder will give you the statistically best build.
---
I think it's inherently unfair for someone to come into a game, demand changes that suits them, and then tell others "maybe it's not your kind of game". Hearthstone from the start was a simple card game that had a lot of upward potential and a few random effects that were like a spice to the game. Over time, the percentage of RNG cards increased, especially with the introduction of card generation mechanics. 
---
The game you see today was wrested away from people like OP and me. I wanted MTG, but with Warcraft, even if it was a simpler game. Instead, I'm given a game in which RNG is such a huge factor in general gameplay that I think I would have more fun just approaching random people and flipping a coin. At least then I wouldn't be spending time engaging in gameplay that ultimately won't matter.
---
This is a long winded way of saying that your initial question is somewhat insulting considering how the game was built from the start. Your perspective is one of an invader who came in, changed how things worked, and then is confused when people who liked how things worked before are upset over changes that were made to something they once loved.
---
Malygos Hunter is not a GREAT deck, but it's not terrible, and it's hilarious
---
ok cool
---
This literally sounds like a Quest Rogue but that rotated
---
It‚Äôs funny how often this can happen, very depressing as well.
---
But burning both CC‚Äôs is just the worst!
---
Idk how to show my collection but I have like 2000 dust from quests or whatever. I will spend it all if it's a good idea to make one of these decks you mentioned. If not, then I think it'd be better to save it, no?
---
Precisely. It's a very bad return on investment. I did it when I first started out before I actually started buying into the game. This rotation I had almost complete collections from each set, I'd be a fool to do it this time.
---
That said, I know some people who do dust their collections each year. I dont get it, but its what they do and they seem happy.
---
That‚Äôs false. Big Priests counter is aggro. Just look at every VS Wild meta report over the last 365 days: Tier 1 has been predominantly populated by aggro decks (Kingsbane Rogue, Odd Rogue prenerf, Odd Paladin, Aggro Paladin) and midrange decks (Even Shaman, Evenlock).
---
In fact, Odd Paladin and Even Shaman have spent far more time at the top of Tier 1 than Big Priest has even spent time at Tier 1.
---
Vivid Nightmare is more expensive and a 2/2 body is an actual threat, as opposed to a 0/1 body that you have kill off.  Test Subject + double Regenerate + double Shadowy Figure costs 5 mana and generates two 2/2s, the same thing with Vivid costs 7 mana and generates two 0/1s.  
---
As an aside, I suppose one cool thing you can do with Vivid that you can't with Shadowy Figure is on 7-mana, you can go: 
---
Test Subject, double Regenerate, double Vivid, then triple Forbidden Words, and guarantee you get a bunch of extra Regenerates, but I think you also might risk overdrawing.
---
Spaghetti code in action again
---
You need to develop a board to win. 4 mana is expensive.
---
Really tho did it let you or was it purely cosmetic. I already know the answer but still give an answer
---
"Cunt" great deck name lol
---
I don't see the aggressive Bomb Warriors running Warpath.
---
People do this in HS because there is a high barrier to talking to anyone.  You have to be reeeally motivated to send the friend request, wait for them to accept it, then start talking to them.  Tilt is that kind of motivator.  A mildly pleasant experience might not be, especially if you're afraid that sending the friend request will "sour" the experience or leave a bad taste in your mouth.
---
If I could chat in-game I'd compliment my opponents sometimes.  That's impossible to do with emotes and it's hard to do with friend requests.
---
The result of HS' social setup is that most experiences with other players are negative.
---
Mid range hunter. It basically requires 2 masters call and 1 zuljin (2400 dust) to fully upgrade it to a meta deck that can definitely take you to legend.
---
Yeah, that's what I noticed also, in ladder you can easily determine what deck the enemy is using sometimes the whole decklist.
---
About winning and losing is kinda different because most of the time games tend to be really long (20-30min) and losing becomes really frustrating, but I get the point, I can generally see my own mistakes when the rng isn't complete garbage that is, overall this was a rant as it was the first real anger moment on this game.
---
In general, a lot of people will say don't dust legendaries. The reasoning for this is because there's a chance that even the most meme legendary can be playable. Example would be Togwaggle, which required an extra set for it to see play. There's also the Paladin Death Knight which was considered one of the worst until OTK paladin came into action. 
---
The second reason is that it prevents you from pulling a second copy. If you have Griftah, you can't get another one in packs (unless you own all the legendaries of that set).
---
That said, Griftah is terrible and will probably not see play in future sets. The effect is random and has a niche use in making your opponent overdraw. Its a safe disenchant in the sense that you won't miss it. My personal opinion is that if you need that extra 400 dust to finish some deck that you've been dying to play, then go for it. Otherwise keep it.
---
Craft if you want to play it. Hold out if you want to craft wins
---
I just hope at some point they go back to dragon priest, I hate silence and big priest.
---
We have Nerubian Unraveler, not sure why OP didn't mention it.
---
I dunno... it kinda seems like a "here's 5 dust, go dust yourself off" after demolishing them.  If I could wreck someone and then drop 5 dust on them, I'd feel like I were adding insult to injury.  "Take this 5 dust and make some decent cards!"
---
EU 80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first. deki#2854

I applaud your efforts to make Hearthstone more social.  How would your plan encourage people to interact with their social group?  I'm guessing something like, must post once a month in the group, or have some Hearthstone related goal that they have to report/do -- like try a deck and post about it's performance?  Maybe I answered my own question, lol.  Personally I think the co-op brawls are one of the most social events of the game and I wish Blizzard would create a new mode based on it.
---
if you consider that warrior struggles vs token, while having 2 brawls and 2 warpath's, i think its pretty good.
---
you can stall until turn 6 easily, clear the board and still leave a body capable of taking out tokens.
---
"Loatheb was the best designed card ever" lmao nah Loatheb was OP as fuck. Any board based deck could just drop him on 5 and know their opponent couldn't clear.
---
Honestly I think OP is just a case in point of what the post he's referencing describes
---
I'm pretty sure token druid is getting worse by the second. Tempo rogue and zoo both beat it pretty handily, and its meta position keeps dropping at legend.
---
Just gotta learn to play against it.
---
Maybe this an oddity, but since I started playing a few months ago, I've got 9 friends, 8 of which I've talked to and are nice people. The ninth I just haven't talked to.
---
I made this same post in the competitive sub, hoping to get their thoughtzs. But then I went to their front page only to realize someone else had the same idea and was there way before me. I'll probably check out their version more later tonight.
---
Oh I was picturing the void having cards that got double Hall of famed
---
Isn't the new Combo Warlock with Plot Twist disgustingly OP and beats just about anything but Kingsbane Rogue?
---
Priest has great value, and no Hero card, which means they fall behind. Shaman and Warrior are the only hard control options to be honest. Shadowform is good, but Hero cards deal, heal and value at the same time. You can't beat that, unless you're Jaraxxus I guess, and living on a prayer.
---
Yeah it was so fun when Odd Pally got Sunkeeper Tarim. Fun times!
---
Mimic Pod isn‚Äôt in standard anymore.
---
I want this just to see how busted Huntertaker would be with the alpha/beta cards and every deathrattle past GVG.
---
Itd be the most degenerate deck known to man.
---
It's the exact same interaction with your opponent that Loatheb provides
---
Freeze Mage, Pirate Warrior per se. Murloc is close.
---
This looked so fun I dusted a bunch of crap and just built the original deck.
---
It‚Äôs fun! I can feel my opponent going WTF? starting at turn 5 or so and it‚Äôs awesome.
---

You're right. The odds were terrible for getting innervate Fledgling turn 1 as Druid in Un'goro... but when you did, you just won the game then and there :) Too much fun for everyone involved.

Pulling Elysiana from their deck or milling it and tasting that salt are moments that I live for.

You forgot the purple coloured theme as well

How long can this go on?

Oof. Yeah I actually really dig arena right now although I keep forgetting what I should be playing around and playing around stuff I shouldn't worry about. Which when I finally adjust to will be different again I suppose.
---

Ik it‚Äôs cause turn 5 is earliest you can play it but wouldn‚Äôt turn 6 be better because of ‚Äúfully‚Äù charged scheme?
---
Trick question. You Elysiana Baleful Banker and Elysiana.
---
I once build a Malygos deck without the Malygos. We've all been there.
---
Some people disenchant all of their wild cards but the format can be pretty fun, at low ranks it's just a nice place to use your collection. If you think you would enjoy having more dust to craft a Standard deck then go ahead but I'm glad I haven't disenchanted mine personally.
---
They did this in Duelyst with Gold and honored the highest tippers in a monthly email. It was a great system!
---
Control is not the best archetype (well, not always). Aggro, midrange, control and combo are the main archetypes and the best one will always depend on the meta. Sometimes combo decks are better, sometimes aggro decks are better, but normally you can find tier 1 decks on 3 of the 4 archetypes (right now, control warrior, tempo rogue, aggro murloc shaman, combo priest, midrange hunter...)
---
Now, some people do preffer certain archetypes in favour of others. I mainly like aggro, although I do like other control, combo and midrange decks. But normally, when in doubt, an aggro deck will probably work for me. Its okey if you feel like control adapts more to your playstyle. Aggro feels very risky and "all in", while control takes a step back, reacts to the opponent and can have better chances against other decks with good deckbuilding and plays. Im glad you found an archetype you enjoy, but understand that it never feels good to play against the archetype that its really hard to tech *for your deck* and that has a good matchup against you. I hate playing against the "armor up infinitely" decks when playing an aggro deck, it feels like even if I connect all my dmg I wont even kill him since he heals/armors at a faster rate. So I understand your pain against priest when playing bomb warrior.
---
In ladder, since wins matter, people will probably play the considered best decks of the moment (those same 4-5 decks you mention), while in casual you can see more personal, special decks. So if you feel like the matchup against the priests are not that fun to you, thats why i recomended to stay in casual. If you see a priest, just concede and lets go for the next match. It doesnt matter that you lost, since you dont have any punishment (lose starts or anything) so there is no pressure. I just explain this better since maybe in my last comment it looked a bit condescending, and it wasnt my intention.
---
Similarly, Book of Specters into a Bomb that then draws a spell won't discard the spell.

hearthstone isn't a skill based game... it used to be a fun game if that helps?

Not trying to change your opinion but a while ago he did say in a video that he‚Äôs not actually cocky, just really sarcastic which comes off as cocky as he says cocky things in his monotone voice. It‚Äôs a type of personality you either like or don‚Äôt but no one is actually as conceited as toast pretends he is.
---
Essentially, cards you set aside as a part of your deck but not in it, and when you begin a game - before drawing - you can swap some of those cards with the ones in your active deck
---

It still is fun, your opinion can be different and that‚Äôs fine. But don‚Äôt waste your time on the HEARTHSTONE Sub if you‚Äôre just gonna bash it
---
Gwent arena pre-Gwent 2.0 was the best experience I've ever had in a card game. Unfortunately new Gwent just lacks the depth of gameplay that old Gwent did, and the minimalist visual style got too cluttered for my taste.
---
This or they will reduce the impact of omega cards maybe. If anything Omega Devastator might be increased in cost so you can only play one a turn, which I agree with. It should be a 6-7 mana card. It's so swingy otherwise. Especially when you give it rush.
---
*Astounding!*
---
That's what it seems, I'm wondering if they just say "x legandary" and really arent. I'm not ranked in this xpac yet, but I  know there is no way the decks posted are breaking the top 10k.
---
I mean it‚Äôs certainly part of his persona in HS. He basically has a 0 strike policy. Bans people randomly. And tbh chat is wrong 99.99% of the time when they try to correct him. But i admit I‚Äôve seen him misplay like single digit times the entire time I‚Äôve been watching him (when he had the mask on still). 
---
I‚Äôm not here to convince you to like toast lol, just my POV.
---
I get a feeling that guys like Toast really don't enjoy Hearthstone at all anymore but simply can't walk away because, well, look at the numbers he gets on these videos which no more effort than just streaming Hearthstone. They're making serious money but you can only fake your interest level in something so much. I even get that vibe from Mr Positive Energy Kibler a little bit, of all people. I think they're all burned out.
---
why? most of the design team go on this sub, how are they going to know they're assholes if i don't mention it?
---
no, you should craft a budget deck with a proven positive winrate  
---

But on a side note, why do people call them Death Knights...
---
How are they assholes? For not fixing a format that they said they wouldn‚Äôt fix?
---
The fact one of his arms is broken is kind of weird
---
I made a post about this (it went unnoticed). Goblin Lackey rush buff doesn't stay on copy effects. Same thing happens if you faceless manipulator a minion buffed by Goblin Lackey.
---
Exactly, this isnt "spagetti code" or an inconsistency. It may be unintuitive or not how you think it should work but trying to argue that this is laziness or incompetence on Blizzard's part is not accurate or helpful criticism in the slightest.
---
The math checks out.
---
Well, I mean you can't say a man who got famous for wearing a bread mask while playing card games doesn't know how to do clickbait.
---
I loved seeing him play meme decks at tournaments and win! Stuff like Aviana Kun in tournaments where it was just unheard of! Now he's just kind of raging every other game. He fits in a few memes but it has a less unique feel to it all, even before the rotation.

See, it's like the [specialist format](https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6426-hearthstone-specialist-the-new-competitive-format) but instead of having three decks, you have the main deck and a side board.
---
After the first game of the match, you can add cards from sideboard, or replace cards with cards from sideboard.
---
Well OP deck doesn't seem better..
---
Use \\\\\\\\\\ to show how much you've been working out your arms.

Fair, then ofc there are no 100% winrate decks. Although having a 60 sample size is problematic in its own, as a high winrate brings you better opponents, significantly better. Like a 80% winrate deck can get you from 25 to 5+ in 60 games. Does the initial wins count then? What about rank 20k legend vs rank 20?
---
Yeah but they have done cast when drawn a decent amount before. And they could have simply done it so that the bomb goes off, draws another card like normal, and then switches ysera and new cards cost. Not saying your point is wrong but it‚Äôs not like the mechanic is new and this specific interaction makes no sense either way since drawing an extra card on cast when drawn is the norm, so both cards should be able to work together without making the bomb or the draw card useless.
---
Toast himself has mentioned before that he no longer likes playing hearthstone all that much anymore iirc.
---
By playing a minimum of 320 games without getting your opponents so salty that they refuse to GG out of spite.
---
I never trusted him after he had a deck go 5-2 or something and then say ‚Äúthose were against aggro decks so those are basically wins‚Äù and then proceeded to use 100% win rate in the title, thumbnail, and highlights. But he left the deck tracker‚Äôs score on screen and everyone could see he lost 2 games.
---
But cast when drawn cards normally draw another card so couldn‚Äôt it just switch ysera and the drawn card‚Äôs costs?
---
I really doubt they released this one card to destroy all of wild as you are suggesting.
---
There are future expansions that will have major synergy potential with cards such as this that aren‚Äôt seeing much play. 
---
Just gotta wait.
---
no, for designing a card to disrupt a format. Darkest Hour is played in no current standard decks, it was designed solely to disrupt wild.
---
the card will never see play without bloodbloom support. they could have easily reworded it "summon a random minion of the same cost" and it would see the same amount of play in standard.
---
Oooh that would be so cool. I main Hunter and Stitched Tracker gave us the possibility to put some tech card (like Harrison Jones / Zihi) without suffering too much, i miss that card.
---
oh synergy? with a card that has synergy with every non battlecry minion in the game? great.
---
you have to use 3 actually. :)
