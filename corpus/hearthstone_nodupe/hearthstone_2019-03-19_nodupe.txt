Just don't pick Scheme.

What are everyone's thoughts on leaving candleshot in death rattle hunter? Without hunters mark it's value has certainly decreased and wouldn't you be better off replacing them with some tech or tar creepers or something if you're facing lots of aggro? 
---
Thanks! 
---
exactly right? i feel arena got completely ruined when they introduced the "buckets" change. before (atleast in my humble opinion) it was two players piloting extra shit decks and seeing who can make the best out of it. then after that change it turned into semi constructed where u can get rolled game 2 without having a chance.

Bring back multiclass please.

---
I have concluded with this in a reply to a reply to this reply about that. Also, you don't usually have to hold it(a combo piece) for 4 turns.
---
With preps this can be done in standard with up to 3 1 mana spells and a spell that can cost 3 if I remember correctly so you could go Evis+ss+ss+petal which does the job with 1 maly if your opponent is below or at 30 (technically 31). 
---
I resent that. I sit on casual ~20 with whale decks and frequently knock into others with elite/meta decks.
---
The only reason I would want to advance rank is if it made the game more competitive and the decklists broader. 20 casual feels like the sweet spot to me. Also, hail Satan. 
---
Holy crap! It is $109.99 in Canada.
---
I said "You're fucking crazy Blizzard" when they wanted me to spend $80. I could get a new AAA game for that price.
---
$109.99 is a new release AAA game + a 1/4 Ounce of premium weed here in Canada!!!
---
blizzard prefers keeping the hearthstone team small. so there are almost no extra content like cosmetics and stuff that they can get money from. so only income is packs. and their price is high since they are the only way of making money.
---
First, Blizzard needs to address the bug that gives player an extra quest. NOW THIS IS PRIORITY, THEY ARE LOSING MONEY!!
---
Why did they never make another Inspire card? There were only a few that were any good and maybe that's why the were not very popular but I would have thought they'd pick up the mechanic again. 
---
There were more Hero Power related cards in Rastakhan - which is interresting since both sets were tournaments. Maybe one of the reason why they were reluctant recently was the presence of the KFT hero cards and Gen/Baku. 
---
Cant wait to get this off of academic espionage, and have a permanent vanish
---
"Kibler was great" chain starts here.
---
Not as bad as Valeera the Hollow's "add a Shadow Reflection to your hand" though. Here you can at least figure out that it creates a minion that casts 2 spells.
---
Indeed is hehe

SECRET AGENT COMING THROUGH
---
New Hagatha exemplifies what I loved about Hearthstone when I first got into it: the idea that some cards only suggested at what they did and didn't really have any way of determining their effect until I played them. It would be annoying if this was every card, but I think Blizzard hit the right balance.
---
My go to example is Animal Companion. All it says is "summon an animal companion". As a new player, I have no idea what that is, but I wanna know, so I play it. Over the course of my next few games, I'll eventually see Huffer, Misha, and Leokk, and I might wonder how many animal companions this card can actually summon? I have to go out and get involved with the community to learn the boundaries of the card.
---
The key, I think, is that when a Hearthstone card merely suggests at what it does, the result is almost always good for you. Animal Companion would be a garbage card if it sometimes summoned a 1/1 with no abilities. But it doesn't; every Companion is useful in different scenarios. The only real whiff is getting the wrong one at the wrong time (looking at you, Empty Board Leokk). Who's the gnome who summons an invention? Mekkatorque? I forget, but all of his stuff is solid too. There's a sense of trust that if I put this card in my deck, it's gonna do something cool, just maybe not the exact cool thing I need at this exact second.
---
Hagatha is kind of like that but in a different way, where they say something very casual that means nothing in the language of Hearthstone, but like, I get it. I'm teaching this elemental some spells so when I summon it, it casts those spells. That's excellent. Very evocative. Gives me a strong "conjurer in DnD" feel with customizing my summoned creature. It's too cool. I love shit like that.
---
There may be a couple of bad shaman spells in the pool but since you get to discover what you want you will be almost guaranteed two decent ones at least. This card is kind of like a Kazakus v2 without any conditions slapped on it. Sure Kazakus was better when it was active but it was also a deck-defining card. I'm sure if Shaman has any control playstyle deck while this card is in rotation it will see play. But let's see how that pans out since Shaman has been struggling the most out of any class now.
---
&gt; You can buy a box of Magic Cards for that price, open it, and sell most of the cards for a profit or at least break even.
---
No, you can't. If breaking even were guaranteed, they wouldn't sell them to you for that cost. People constantly overestimate how easy it is to turn a profit selling Magic cards when trying to argue that being able to sell justifies the significantly higher price to play the game.
---
I think that move doesn't necessarily show they care for people, it was necessary to HoF those cards, one could also think they did it to sell more packs, because with Genn and Baku another year, the same decks would be played over and over, but I'm looking forward to the new year and really hope they do it right this time, because I loved this game in the past and would like to enjoy it again
---
I had a game earlier with 5 cards in the warlock’s hand and 4 health on the howlfiend...everything but portal got discarded...
---
looks like a warrior to me
---
So you cast this, get a 7 mana 5/5 do nothing, and you can either end up with a situational spell that relies on having a board, a wipespell, or randomly targeting spells. Also any card with overload will still lock your mana crystals. This card is pretty balanced.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
([For a more complete explanation, see the full guide here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/))
---
Basic rules for each card in question:
---
1. If **max playable copies are golden**, do nothing.
---
2. If you are **missing a playable copy**, craft golden of the [highest rarity](https://imgur.com/a/LfX3PCl) you can.
---
3. If you **only have a non-golden playable copy**, decide...
---
	* If you want to upgrade to a golden copy, craft golden.
---
	* If you want the most dust, do nothing, except for COMMON cards, always craft golden.

SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 7 MANA 4/4
---
Can you pm the info? I‘m from Munich, sounds like good fun.
---
Honestly, I'm fine with most of them except Warrior's hero power. It just feels like an auto-loss queuing a hyper aggressive deck against odd Warrior, knowing you'll never keep up with it's +4 armor gain before your deck runs out of fuel.
---
you can? that OP
---
If your Horror learns Hagatha's Scheme will it be upgraded turn by turn as normal, or is it capped at the base damage of the spell? 
---
Why don’t you just play casual until the new expansion comes out
---
Yes, you can. I spent an entire decade doing it and turning a profit most times. I worked at a friend's local game shop and watched him run a successful business from doing it.
---
If you think you can't then you're either willfully ignorant or selling them foolishly.
---
Even discounting Vintage which is absurdly expensive, you can basically make every single prominent meta deck in Hearthstone for less money than crafting *one* standard MTG deck.
---
Hang on, you know that you only get a refund for 2 of the odd/even cards? It is not a nerf, it is a Hall of Fame, which is different. If you already have 2 of the rares, not worth getting packs on the slight chance of the epics. May as well just craft the epics so you get your dust refund back on them for the HoF.
---
It's either bots with basic decks or meta decks - it's really not that much better.  
---
Some of these candy crush levels though ... damn they can get tricky.  
---
There are only three windows where the game is (generally) fun, and shines in the way it’s mostly meant to shine. The first is rank 20. The second is zero stars at rank 5. The third is *low* legend. 
---
If you’re at any other rank, it’s just an supremely dull exercise of encountering one unimaginative midrange hunter deck after another (or something similar). Ranks are completely arbitrary, and don’t signify anything. You’ve accomplished absolutely nothing by reaching rank 15 compared with reaching rank 5, for example. It’s just a matter of how many hours you’re willing to play in a single month. The only meaningful rank to reach is legend, and anyone who goes out of their way to intentionally reach legend more than once for the cardback simply has way too much time on their hands. Or they’re a masochistic psychopath. 
---
Yeah, I love cards that are different and unique, also cards  have some sort of skill to be successful with like curious glimmeroot, togwaggle etc. 
---
Or the 2 Mana 1/5 Mech
---
Except the paladin cars discovers secrets from your class if you are a mage, hunter, or rogue.... it will almost definitely discover other class spells when played in another class.
---
I only log in to do the quests and immediately log out, not a chance I play for hours like in the past, and I get so unhappy and unsatisfied during those 2-3 matches to complete the quest that I can't believe it. 
---
Found this thread with search. This issue is not getting enough attention. I've had the same experience since the patch, and experienced another two brief disconnects during streaming today. Several people in chat mentioned that they have experienced more disconnects too.
---
MTG is a very, very different game from Hearthstone. Master’s Acquisition isn’t all that bad. 
---
Give candy crush a go if you're mobile like me.  It can get frustrating but it at least tests your brain a bit more than HS currently. There is an element of RNG involved of course but I don't think it's quite as bad as HS in that regard.
---
I don’t think many of the current players appreciate the obvious cash grab when there are so many things  wrong with hearthstone that aren’t being fixed. Anything from the gold economy to how unfriendly the game is to new players should have a very high priority in figuring out. But instead they are constantly ignored or worsened. Existing players don’t appreciate it and new players don’t bother getting invested enough in the game because they feel it won’t make a difference. For the past few weeks I’ve been trying to get my wife into the game and she likes it but her main grief is the discrepancy in cards between her and other players. That coupled with the fact that she can hardly make any progress makes her not want to play. 
---
Well going by that logic everything they change could be seen as “just a reason to sell packs”. 
---
Hearthstone absolutely can do mechanics like Discover that wouldn’t work in a physical card game. And that’s cool. On the other hand, Magic has some seriously silly shit in it as well. 
---
Thunder, THUNDER, *THUNDER CATS*! HOOOOO!
---
Respect.
---
No, he wasn't great.  I mean, he was great. he is great. But he also wasn't great, especially when he was simply a wasn't. 
---
I dunno, this card is kinda similar to pre nerf ancient of lore, which was busted. I think it's gonna be very strong 
---
Volcano is lethal.

What “play 1000 [insert tribal card] quests are you talking about?

stupid question from someone who never hosted/participated in these fireside gatherings, Can I host a private gathering but somehow share the coordinates with an online friend who isn't from the same country ?

---
Totem pole is absolute trash... 
---
Mosh'ogg enforcer is a 2-14 divine shield taunt for 8 mana, and it's a horrible card (almost no one plays it, unless they're combo'ing it).
---
This card is 1 more mana. How much better than a 2-14 taunt divine shield can you get? 
---
If we value divine shield at 2 health, then it's a 2-16. 
---
To get equivalent attack, you need 2 searing totems, making it a 2-3. So you need another 14 health to make it about as good, so 9 totems total.
---
But you don't want it to be "as good", you need it to be MUCH better, given that
---
1) It cost 1 more mana
---
2) It cost 1 more mana over a card no one plays for its raw stats
---
3) It forces you to totem up just about every turn in the game.
---
To make this "ok", you probably over 12 totems; This would make it a 3-22. Hell I'm not even sure people would play a 3-22 for 9 mana, WITHOUT the requirement (again, compare it to Mosh'ogg, a card that isn't played for stats). 
---
So you're probably looking at 14-16 totems or something. 
---
But at this point, it adds yet another requirement, i.e. the game has to last around 15 turns. 
---
This card is WAY overcosted. It wouldn't see play at 8 mana. The requirement is way too high just to be slightly better than a trash card.
---
he was drunk... relax
---
You're not supposed to put anything on free space, that's like, the point, of the free space...
---
Shaman spells though 
---
We have to see what they'll put into the pool but feel like this card wont see much use till later 
---
i mean being drunk isnt a good excuse to turn into a shitty person
---
Yeah, I think the person who said they meant beat the computer in practice mode is right.  Done all solo player content (including heroic) and toki in this run is harder than almost anything else in my opinion.  Also beating solo content has no impact on your ability in ranked (besides maybe boom labs as that stuff gets you thinking more efficiently - feels less rewarding to complete though imo) ; if you want to do well in ranked just look up some cheap but good netdecks  and read guides on them.  It will be a thousand times more useful than wasting your time on solo content if you're not enjoying.  
---
The person he's facing is someone who's known for doing that to him in the past, he even recognized them himself.

And yes, kripp is pretty darn good. I watch him a lot, really chill streams with (usually) good plays.

#How to Get Better at Hearthstone
---
#1. Find the best Deck to play
---
&gt;The most important thing for your first climb is to pick the most "overpowered" or "Tier-1" deck.  This will mask a lot of your early mistakes as you learn to play at a higher level and reduce the time to climb.
---
If there is a recent [Vicious Syndicate Meta Report](https://data-reaper-report.vicioussyndicate.com) I would use that as a primary reference.  [Hearthstone Top Decks](http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/?st=-HCT&amp;class_id=&amp;style_id=&amp;t_id=&amp;f_id=&amp;pt_id=1&amp;sort=new) keeps a pretty good curated list that is great between meta reports.  And [Neon31HS has a good Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/neon31hs?lang=en) that lists as many Legend decks as they can. *(Overwhelming but very thorough.)*
---
* I wouldn't use sites like [Hearthpwn](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-is-forge=2&amp;filter-unreleased-cards=f&amp;filter-show-standard=1&amp;filter-show-constructed-only=y&amp;filter-deck-tag=1) because they use clickbait stats and are often more fun/memes then competitive.
---
* I would [only use HSReplay if I had the premium service](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i) or wanted to find my opponents deck.  This is because they only show the winrate across all ranks.  So while a deck may show a 65% winrate across all ranks, it might have a 45% at 4-Legend.  You just don't truly know the best decklists (Also, doesn't capture breaking decklists because it requires 10 different submitters with at least 400 games.
---
* I would consider using decklists off /r/competitiveHS because they do a good job curating there and stay away from clickbait titles.  The plus side is sometimes you can find a guide along with the list to help your mulligans and reduce the learning curve.
---
* [Finally, you can see the strongest deck archetypes over the past 24 hours by using VS Live](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/data-reaper-live-beta/).  It tells you the 5 best decks for Legend, Rank 1-4, and 5-14. (*and its free*!)
---
#2. Identify Your Mistakes
---
&gt;You can get better playing hundreds of games and teaching yourself or you can speed this up by watching your replays, hiring a coach, studying other player/streamers, or using a premium service ([HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i))
---
######"Actively" study Replays
---
If you don't want to study your own replays, you can find high [Legend replays for your deck archetype at MetaLegend](https://metalegend.com/).  Before the player makes their move, make your decisions on mulligans or lines of play, say it aloud to commit yourself, and if the player does something different, ask yourself why.  Be harsh on yourself if your line of play deviates in the slightest.
---
######Find little known streamers to ask questions. 
---
There are lots of streamers who are Legend and never hit the front page on [Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hearthstone). Scroll down and find high ranked players with few viewers. (Look for Orange Diamond signifying Legend rank) They are a lot more interactive then the "top streams" where you have to make a donation to get seen and are probably playing purely competitive decks. (Instead of "fun" decks).  Alternatively, you can donate money or subscribe to a popular stream in hopes of having them answer your question. *(You can give a free sub with Amazon Prime)*
---
######Discord isn't a bad option either
---
You can join the /r/competitiveHS discord channel from their subreddit sidebard and there is a channel called ["Team-Up"](https://discordapp.com/channels/172846449854382081/458609710346534912) where you can voice chat with other players as they climb.  Even if you can't get free coaching, maybe just hanging out with a better play would help you learn.  If you don't want to voice chat, ask if you can add them as a friend and just spectate them.
---
#3. Learn the Mulligans
---
######Use a Premium Service like HSReplay for Mulligans
---
&gt;Paying for services or a coach can reduce the learning curve/time.  But is entirely optional and unnecessary to reach Legend.  
---
I don't think this is needed but the extra step besides studying players/replays is to pay $5/month for access to [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i).  Here you can look at the best performing decks at Legend and see their mulligan winrate percentages versus specific classes or decks.  
---
Knowing the right mulligans will increase your winrate by at least a few percentage points.  On this data alone, I think the Premium service justifies its cost for at least a month or two to fully learn and identify the correct mulligans for each matchup.   It's also useful to identify the underperforming or weakest cards in the deck as those are viable options to cut for tech cards.
---
######Find a Coach
---
Instead of [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i) you might find someone on the Hearthstone Discord (as mentioned above) who is willing to spectate/teach you how to play their deck.  Or you might offer to pay someone to teach you the ins, outs, and mulligans of a specific deck on a site like /r/HScoaching. It is up to you.
---
Why swap decks when you can shuffle 30 Pogohoppers into your own?
---
Druid inspire please, I miss this mechanic the most. Also seems to suit the direction druid has gone with gonk and other supporting cards with hero attacking
---
Has anyone asked Swamp King Dred how he feels about this?  I mean its gotta' be somewhere between kind of creepy and is that even possible?
---
Be very afraid of the first Swamp Prince, Battlecry: After your opponent plays a minion, add a 5/5 Horror to your hand.
---
Kft also added lifesteal! You missed that
---
Also "Swamp King" vs. "Swampqueen" ... #unplayable
---
You mean that deck wasn’t made to do that? Lol
---
Hehe
---
Yeah me too, I disenchanted and crafted useless legendary so I never came back. I wasn’t having fun. I was getting upset at loosing. 
---
I'm using an iPhone 6 , and yes been having trouble since the update
---
I imagine this expansion the villains will "win" since they're on focus. Furthermore, in the Solo adventure we play as the "Henchmen" meaning that by the end we'll see the league's goal accomplished. With that in mind, I do believe the second expansion might either be the heroes' retaliation, or it will be fairly neutral in the conflict ala cliffhanger style, while the final expansion is the big clash.
---
Yes. Rafaam (Golden Monkey) is the warlock LoE callback.
---
what you deck do? i dont get it
---
Kibler makes me want to be a better person
---
Still *three years* for a game-deciding big

WE ATTACK HIS HEARTH NORMAN , HIS HEARTH 
---
It's an adapted version of this deck featured here: [https://youtu.be/bczaPGHNmIU?t=57](https://youtu.be/bczaPGHNmIU?t=57) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But instead of using Defile to trigger it, I use Lord Godfrey as the ghouls still have 2 health.
---
With 3 demonbolts it is looking good. I’m a little worried about that Loose Specimen though
---
I think the final will be a team up, vs the dragons. 
---
Bro quest shaman is actually better than most people think.
---
Dr boom is representing the year of his first appearance, so a TGT callback seems more likely tbh
---
So Dr. Boom will probably give us an Omega call back or something
---
Could be given your smaller collection size that you cant make any optimal decks. So it picks the highest winrate card you own to start with, and that could be a draw. Then they act like different seeds. 
---
OTK happens at 9:30 btw
---
It specifies shaman spells though
---
What's surprising?
---
&gt; The stories of previous sets inform the characters that come from them.  So Madame Lazul was influenced by Whispers of the Old Gods, same for Dr. Boom and Boomsday (and you can see that in the art/a bit in the mechanics in their classes), but it's critical to this story.
---
It says in the tweet explicitly that Dr. Boom is tied to Boomsday.  He had nothing to do with TGT.  *Maybe* there is a "Defender of Dalaran" that will be tied to TGT. (4 hero classes)
---
Maybe even ten, if when Zul'jin cast the Twinspell version of the spell, it gives you more copies. Not sure if it works like that, but it would be worth testing out.
---
Hello guys,
---
Is it known whether the dust for new HoF'd cards like Baku, Genn and other will be compensated as before? 
---
On April 9th a new Standard rotation starts so all the best cards/decks will be gone/changed.  
---
* Leeroy Jenkins is a staple Classic Standard/Wild card for Aggro decks.
---
* Zilliax is the same for Midrange/Control decks but as part of Boomsday, will rotate in another year from now.
---
* Bloodmage Thalnos fits in a ton of different decks but it's not as impactful when played as Leeroy or Zilliax.
---
I wouldn't go crafting decks right now.  I would save your dust for HOF rotation where you can turn that dust into 12.5-50% more.
---

---
How did you even get to that screen where it says monsters defeated? Or do you lose that screen once you beat her?
---
Shes definietly a bit tricky, I think it took me like 10 tries or something. I guess the best advice is make sure you put a lot of thought into what cards you add to your deck. Me and my buddy always "co-op" the PvE game, and we'll talk and think for like 10-20 minutes each choice. Its usually a more complicated decision than you think.
---
We would write down on paper her deck as we discovered it (I'm assuming you are mostly struggling with the final boss) because its critical you don't get fucked by an untimely Loatheb, 10 drop spell, or big clockwork man.
---
We aren't phenomenal players or anything (though we are legend) so if you are struggling this much then its probably just a case of high rolling. 
---
I hope you beat her soon, once you beat everyone you unlock the final challenge which is a lot of fun too- but thankfully not as difficult. 
---
Y'know, I'm something of a dragon myself
---
Yes, same as previous years.

only cause priests way to cheap ressurects, else you gimp your deck for 1 10/10 on turn 3/4 which evry class has some way to answer it.
---
Oh great I get to play a 7 mana 5/5 and then look at the shiny new card I made as my opponent kills me next turn
---
Too many boxes are too vague / subjective
---
I just went back and beat it first try. Definitely grab the spell damage and double spell passives. Try to draft big spell cards.
---
I still use it in an Odd Warrior list I have. The constant AoE is really strong.
---
and barnes yshaarij is no issue, evry class has some way to asnwer it. the problem has Always been the super cheap ressurects.
---
Since Omega wont have rotated for this expansion I would think(read Hope) they wont call it back. Also Dr Boom is originally from Goblins Vs Gnomes, my guess it one of those death rattle Summon random X minion like Piloted Shredder. 
---
Idk man Hagathas whole body is smaller than Dreads smallest pinky. Hagathas gonna explode from giving birth

I'm glad. Don't see how reusing old ideas is considered a new idea.. even though the theme is "old characters are in a group now". 
---
Hi glad, I'm dad!
---
sounds pretty cool ngl
---
I'd so farm dungeon runs when they added gold. I already do dungeon runs/monster hunt sometimes when I feel bored and got annoyed with ladder.
---
It's 7 mana do something reactive or get cheated out and still do something reactive. Compared to Charged Devilsaur which is 7 mana Rush or cheated out 7/7 charge.
---
Been playing wild since before wild was a thing. While i agree that barnes is a problem in wild due to its auto win low skill cap nature, its not the problem with wild. Wild is supposed to be where we go to play old strategies and do broken stuff with minimal changes. A bug problem we have is classic cards being nerfed when they should be hall of famed and cards being nerfed in wild only. When blizzard introduced while they told us it was going to be wild and we could play our old decks. We can't play most of the decks from before wild was a thing because so many nerfs have been made that the top decks don't even resemble top decks from any time. The meta constantly revolves around weather you can be fast or controlling enough to beat big priest or a molten giant based strategy. Wild used to be filled with aggro because those decks had some of the str9ngest cards in hearthstone but the hearthstone devs have continually shown bias against aggressive strategies being top tier. Before they nerfed patches wild had alot of aggro but priest and warlock decks where still top tier
---
And druidstone was still a thing. Untouched all the current wild decks and previous wild decks would exist. The difference being would be that aggro would be stronger than control decks that already get game winning board wipes or autowin cards for turn 4 or 5 anyway. Barnes needs a nerf because aggro isnt fast enough to counter him by outracing but if they didnt nerf patches or cold blood or fiery war axe etc. This would be a no  issue. If they unnerfed everything the format would change significantly but it would be what blizzard promised us and not this 1/3 chance of loosing to barnes bs we have now.

Yea i pinged him in that turn i believe lmao I was just casually on the bus on my way to school and encountered this so it was a mixture of being shocked and sleep deprived I guess xD well it was a funny encounter now that I think about it so I'm glad it happened ^^`
---
Someone debunked the removing Barnes thing but I cam't dig out the discussion. Bottom line was: you are more consistent but worse off overall. Removing 1 of 3 cheater cards (2 being essence) is obviously hurting the deck. The only added benefit are those games where you essence out Barnes but apparently thats not a sufficient trade-off. Personally I tried 20-ish games without Barnes and i say "keep him"
---
I think they said Rafaam was the Warlock Callback card, with it having the same text as golden monkey.
---
Well golden cards are cards that have an animation and are golden (duh) also they give more dust when disenchanted.
---
Card backs are the design of the cards on the back, they can be collected and changed for others to see, you can win some of them in adventures and some other every season by wining 5 games in ranked.
---
Card Rotation happens every year, where all the sets released before the last year are moved into Wild; on the 2018 rotation the cards from 2016 were rotated, on April 2019 all the cards from 2017 will be rotated, The format that plays on this basis is called "Standard", while "Wild" is a format where all the sets can be played.
---
As for a basic warlock deck; Zoo Warlock is a type of deck that is known for running low cost minions, this mixed with the hero power makes a deck that every turn can play 2-3 minions, making it a very aggressive deck; I suggest you though to wait until the April's rotation, because more cards will be available at that point, and a better and/or cheaper deck could be born in the new set
---
[Charge]
---
There is no effective counter to mechathun, playing a card that MIGHT counter it isnt the same as having a real counter.
---
I don't understand, how are these cards related at all?
---
I played a lot more big priest without Barnes than with him, pretty much just cause I got tilted after never seemingly drawing him and shadow essense-ing him like 4 games in a row. I felt that the deck was just as consistent without him if not more so, and it definitely didn’t feel quite as much like high rolly garbage to play as.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b2la2d/i_ship_it
---
So with Genn and Baku nerfs, we are getting full dust refund and keeping the card. Which we can also dust.
---
But what if I have golden and normal Baku? Will I get a full dust refund for both? And will I be able to keep both? Not sure how that works.
---
underrated
---
what
---
This is not entirely true. The matchmaking is random within comparable MMRs barring having to pull from neighboring MMRs if there are none available in your range. 
---
It depends, in the first 10 packs you open in a set you are assured to get at least one legendary, if there is a set in Wich you didn't get a legendary on those first &gt;10, I would think about opening some, there is a post here that says everything you can do before the rotation, follow that for better advice (and your own judgement)
---
Ahh ok sorry, got the wrong end of the stick with your comment, I'm kind on the opposite end, pay for the new expansion since it comes out, buying the previous up until release, can't break the cycle!
---
[[Syndragossa]] and [Sheer Luck]. 
---
Obviously it’s a bug due to the latest update 
---
The minion itself might actually get hit, the evolve procs before the swamp King attacks. 
---
Faceless gets hit right? And he also transforms. 
---
And I just reconstructed a Shudderwock deck &lt;3
---
[removed]
---
Sucked all year? Wasn't Shudderwock one of the stronger decks when it first came out?
---
As if a rank matters for the question "what would you change if at all?" Yes, I only play up to rank 5 since I really cannot be bothered to invest time in the legend grind that doesnt mean that it makes resurrect effect any less stupid.
---
Yes, this is how I got Nemsy.
---
I believe there is one in Mainz as well! I don’t think I know the Innkeeper, but it is listed on the firesidegatherings.com site
---
Since he hasn't explained it himself yet:
---
The opponent somehow got a copy of Unstable Evolution, and then used Seance on OP's Krag'wa
---
Now the Priest can use Krag'wa -&gt; Seance -&gt; 2x unstable evolution every turn, resulting in a random 8 drop every turn.
---
In long term your statement is true.
---
What I proposed is not a solution but a way to check if people like it.    
---
Imagine if it's not a legendary, you could run two of them
---
Water type can learn ice moves but i guess drags can also learn lightning type moves
---
None of them. Straight is to the face, they'd ignore each other.
---
Remember that joust wasn't a keyword. Having a single card with inspire would unironically be confusing for new players. 
---
I compare this to Rafaam and I can only believe that each villain was given to a different design team or something.
---
He is with that hoodie he sometimes wears!
---
Raven familiar tho ...
---
Not rush. The difference is small but very important. It definitely wouldn't have seen as much play, if at all, if it had rush. 
---

---
I've played quite allot of this type of rouge, is that even any good? I normally drop espionage till I've attempted to get a bord and drawn my big card draw, drawing bad 1 cost cards is sad. Fun start but not really any good tbh
---
To be fair, if you're playing Jaraxxus against a 1-Health Death's Bite, you're asking for trouble
---
There will be no Hero cards in Rise of Shadows.
---
Would be nice if rogue got a not shit spellstone. I mean even in DR rogue you don’t wanna run onyx, it’s so bad.
---
Mechanical Whelp is capable of making a Mechanical Dragon. I think that qualifies.
---
There's zero reason to play espionage if you have no draw to follow it up.  This opener is awful and not the aforementioned "royal flush"
---
I’m something of a dragon myself
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rft-8jKZ3gA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rft-8jKZ3gA)
---
Ice is also neutral against fire/dragon 
---
Maybe they wanted to use the quest to proc the secret?
---
Nah, you can use other pirates for consistency as well. Just add two southsea deckhands, and be careful to not play either until you have a shadowstep in hand. This way, you are not screwed if patches is the last card in the deck.
---
I will only accept an undead Priest hero if self healing deals damage instead.
---
also, very much determined by rngsus
---
It will happen in this 3 expansion story period
---
The person you’re replying to is Peter Whalen, a lead hearthstone designer lol
---
The r/iamverysmart of hearthstone. Goodstuff. Also, it's just a card game. 
---
Why is there no release schedule time picture thingy 
---
30k holy moly 
---
You will regret it and the returns you get are abysmal. What are you gonna do when you get sick of standard?
---
If you compare the powerlevel of wild to standard, then yeah there is a ton of "OP decks". But you have to think that wild is vastly different from standard. Although they share cards, the insane amount of cards wild has that standard doesnt makes decks be able to be more optimiced than they could ever be in a standard format. So of course, decks can be more powerfull, but this will always happen because of the amount of cards, not because of "carelessness" or "no nerfing stuff". So, if you play a homebrew deck, or a unoptimiced deck, the chances of losing in ladder against a tier 1-2 deck are way higher than in standard, since in comparison, its like if you are playing a deck full of river cocrolisks and chillwind yetis.
---
Now, you are going to dust your entire wild colection, that can give you hours and hours of entertainment by brewing stuff and playing with friends or playing casual (at least I do that) appart from probably also dissenchanting your good wild meta decks, just to have more cards in a standard format we dont even know if its going to be good? After every rotation people praise the change and say its a great rotation. With GvG, no more dr boom, with ungoro, no more reno or midrange shaman, with WW, no more jades... Every expansion is loved when it comes, and hated when its about to leave, or at least part of it. You are risking too much just for a 4rth of the dust value of your cards. For every 4 great wild legendaries you craft only 1 standard one, that when it rotates to wild may even be useless there (like keleseth is good in standard, but trash in wild for example).
---
I would say no, just stop playing for a while if you are burned out, but dont do something you cannot undo and that you will probably regret just to try to squeeze some fun, when you can get that fun in other places.
---
I say Van Cleef because when the opponent slams a huge Van Cleed on the board supee early I have to scramble to find away go get rid of him before he kills me. Cards like Mechathun and Antonidis kill me the turn they're dropped so I more just get annoyed when those get played.

Don't put it in a token deck.

You Guys understand that this company is Not about 'the long haul' and more about as much profit as fast as possible. Example: Lootboxes in each Game. Or that they only 'listen to the community' (we all know: they don't) when an expansion is coming.
---
The second HS won't make enough Money they will Cut it.
---
As said the Idea is great but after seeing the development of the company in the last year I highly doubt it. 
---
You can have a fireside gathering in France playing on the NA server. However, everyone in the fireside will also need to be on the same server.
---
A minion with “at the end of your turn, draw two and burn one” or something like that.

Why give something for free when you can charge $80?

Battlecry: Cast 2 Shaman Spells

Calm down satan
---
Or, like here, you can use the quest to proc a counterspell, which is probably the best use of quest in this matchup (because it is effectively a 1 mana spell: do nothing).
---
If you manage to complete the quest in this matchup you probably have won anyway.
---
Alternatively, they mulliganed the quest and drew it later.

Of all the things holding him back I really don't think that's it lol

do your stats track build-a-beasts?
---
Hiw did sylvanas do that? Genuinely curious.
---
There are character repeats every single set. I don't know why people are so confused.
---
Hemet, Elise, Dr boom, almost every card in WotoG, Aviana... There's tons
---
That’s for rastakhans rumble mate, they haven’t released the reveal schedule for this one yet. Will probably do sometime this week and reveals will start Monday (again, probably).
---
Not as long as there are burst combo decks. Without Voidlord and Spellstone it'll be a lot harder for you to survive for a long time with just 15 health.
---
The same downfall of Druid's Quest 
---
So that's what I've been doing wrong!  All this time I was trying
---
The whole thing?
---
So you only get only one pack at a time. So looking at the big picture, were the mean is a better metric because you have a larger sample, is not as good as the median, which more accurately can tell you what's in a pack.
---
Sorry I’m really bad at finding things... just ask my mom. I still don’t see it above (maybe because I’m on mobile?)

---
I don't think any of the schemes will involve summoning minions because so far the schemes can go up to an infinite number. Summoning minions limits you to 7 as the maximum.
---
The latest patch did the same for my iPad. I did one Arena match and it crashed 5 times (!) during my single game. I went to bed and the same thing happened the next day with a regular (standard) game: repeated crashing. I tried yet again and decided it's basically unplayable. I lose every game due to lost turns/actions.
---
I can only assume Blizzard introduced a new bug that only affects certain iOS devices. The game plays just fine on my iPhone 8. It just crashes my older iPad mini 2 all the time.
---
Roaster wins in constructed. Kranken is better in Arena
---
Really putting yourself at 15 as Warlock is a bad idea in general due to all of the self damaging cards as warlock's classic set. It's especially worse to give your hero a 15 health CAP. I don't know what could make Jeraxxus playable, possibly some more neutral armor gaining cards?
---
It takes two to make a thing go right
---
Sounds like you'd like the magic set called Unstable.
---
Oh, suddenly a creature from someone elses game popped into our game for a sidequest? Nice. Oh, suddenly some random bloke is your teammate. Nice. Building a Half kitten-half kitten? Done.
---
I’m gonna guess that you are playing way too slow if you haven’t won on by pure luck yet. Lesser players usually fall into the trap of trying got get too much value and don’t have enough tempo to win.  Next time you play focus on trying  curve out your deck and play faster lower cost cards for more tempo each turn. 
---
Just wait until he meets:
---
Murloc Heckler: 5 mana 4/3: If you're holding a murloc deal four damage to target minion.
---
Finally pickrates align with winrates
---
Definitley dont dust it, it might not see play in a ton of decks at the top level right now but its one of the best neutral classic legendaries, its seen plenty of competitive play in the past and if you are just starting out it can be a great option in your first control style decks. 
---
You gotta Dire Frenzy those zombeasts
---
I actually prefer Magic and it’s rulesets and think MTG is an excellent showcase for how rules and function don’t limit creativity and unique design, but this new Hagatha is definitely something that couldn’t really exist in MTG, at least not in a smooth way
---
So five callback cards total? Or nine?
---
I’m surprised hugger isn’t here
---
I complete most and re-roll when possible, but I still miss some here and there and complete 50 gold quests somewhat often. Between the average quest payout, gold from wins (I pretty much never hit the cap), events, and the occasional 80 gold quest from friends, 7000+ isn't really that unusual, even if like me you don't play Arena.
---
I wish people would wait a bit to naturalize/cataclysm so we could hear his badass entry quote. Really fits the bill of a man made armageddon bringer
---
What do you mean? Like hold out on using some cards until later instead of dropping them as soon as I have the mana?
---
But then where would all the shit posts go? 
---
&gt; why not show them now to build hype? 
---
uh..to build hype
---
it's easier, not harder, to find space for a tempo loss as the game goes on.
---
control often plays hero power + pass at turn 10 onwards, in order to maximize value.
---
losing tempo on 4 hurts much more than losing tempo on 7.
---
this has the same stats as ancient of lore, which was nerfed for being too good, and the single card here is comparable to the 2 from the tree.
---
That's how it plays for me. Dropping a 6/5 Razormaw for 2 and buffing another minion with Windfury or +3 Attack gives them a lot more to worry about. Err'body and their grandma kills Hyenas ASAP unless you can drop multi Lynx to rush same turn.
---
Unlikely they’ll use a keyword for only a single card in a set.  I’m thinking Omega, Spellstone, Worgen (switch in hand) for the remaining three.
---
There are cards revealed on the Facebook page, but I recall it usually only being 10-20.
---
Just play it? 
---
I LOVE taking cards that kind of suck and just running with them for the sake of it (I crafted golden Moroes. Yeah, that’s right, I just liked him so much I did it. The only time it’s ever come in handy was quest rogue, but i took him for plenty of spins in other decks.) 
---
Don’t play ranked if you don’t wanna drop, and just do it. The amount of stupid decks I made just to try them out and see if I could have fun...
---
Here’s a couple: Edris and Fjola in spirit of the tiger Paladin, Kalimos to play a better elemental shaman (he did become pretty good for even shaman though), Antonidas for quest mage, both Bolvar legendaries, Luna’s Pocket Galaxy in a really out there dragon mage, the list goes on. 
---
I get it, playing meta and all that, but sometimes you just gotta play what you wanna play. Have fun. 
---
Your hand is almost empty? The play Milhouse + cho and get some spells (If you survive the turn)
---
Would of loved the return of cthun 
---
Warlock gets Reno cause LoE, priests get cthun cause old gods :)
---
Yea I always felt 40 dust was a more true value of a pack because 4 commons and a rare was what I was likely to open and already have duplicates of.
---
Funny enough, if I am ever really close to having enough dust to build the deck I want, epics are the first thing to go for me. (Feels like the most dust + least likely to get a duplicate of without being legendary)
---
You are insane. It is wild mode in standard mode. Current meta SUCKS.
---
Zaknafein21#2514 looking for friends on all servers :)
---
It’s suppose to be more accessible since you only need 40 cards instead of upto 160 for conquest /lhs.  
---
I think it will be much more boring to watch since it will be even less variety of games than current tournaments

just has to get earth elemental from second forager, EZ

Got it!
---
I was already confirmed that Warlock (Rafaam) was the Golden Monkey from LoE.  And Priest was the Forbidden card.  Ah well, I can dream.
---
Bro Baku was so busted that they had to rotate him out early. And that’s with the odd deck drawback. Upgraded hero power at low mana for free at the start of game? 
---
I think you mean \[\[Dark Wispers\]\], not Wisps of the Old Gods. Servant cant use spells over 5 cost
---
That can't *possibly* happen so often that a change to the game is necessary.

6/-/- | Choose One - Summon 5 Wisps; or Give a minion +5/+5 and Taunt.

Instead of setting health to 15 he should just give you the 5 armor or whatever and maybe summon a 6/6 as part of the battlecry.

How comes?

She was my first ever legendary. Bring her back to standard!! 
---
So after I got over my initial anger when I posted this I looked it up and it does indeed work that way. I still think that’s dumb and not how it should work but I was wrong and I accept that.

---
It is upsetting to me that they have so many undesirable epics and legendaries in classic.
---
It is obvious that they want to tweak the classic set because they use any excuse they can to do it. Would be nice if they just made a classic 2.0 at some point
---
You have to have 3 different minions to draw 3 minions
---
Well, its not *quite* true. If it is like the rastakhan rope timer, the point where it stops slowly approaches the end as you get closer to the expansion release date.
---
yes but it is still subject to the same huge meta swings and all these new mechanics, which were fun at first, but just make the game feel fundamentally different 
---
I run him just because I like to meta or not. Taylor Henry is all time favorite voice actor
---
I was wrong actually, it works slightly differently (see response to my other comment)
---
It's a "Discover" so you have the choice between 3 different cards. 
---
Since you have only this Wolf x3 in your deck, the "Discorver" show you only one card then draw it. 
---
You joke, but I would love on April 1st for the mods of the subreddits to switch. Only shitposts allowed in /r/competitivehs (for competitive shitposting), and /r/hearthstonecirclejerk has a strict policy of topics containing only the work "hearthstone" "circle" and "jerk".
---
Bam! Your deck got nerf hammer.
---
Definitely not. It 100%  summoned 6 minions. Maybe it was a modified version of Servant, because there were other instances of spells over 5 cost. Maybe a special version for Fireside gatherings? 
---
Sylvanas was one of the best cards ever printed from a design standpoint. She gives lots of opportunities for good play, and importantly, good counterplay. She has RNG but it is RNG *you can manipulate*, to increase the advantage for yourself, or, as the opponent, decrease your disadvantage. She's a value based card *but only if you play her well*: if you play her badly she is lower value than Boulderfist. 
---
Why is Blizzard so bad at printing cards like this these days? It's either pure RNG fiesta that is completely outside of your control (lich king), pure value that you can't possibly miss (hero cards), or pure combo cards that are unplayable outside of their combo usage.

They spend a lot of time in the horde campaign of BfA talking about how when someone becomes undead they aren't the same person.  Sometimes they are unstable or overly angry or greedy or murderous, or they never speak again or they kill themselves or their family.  It's a convienient plot device, but it also makes sense to me.  We know that brain damage can change people, and that being legally dead for too long can cause brain damage, so in this fantasy world I can accept that being turned into a zombie can change you.
---
And I guess being an evil spirit is technically 'undead' in that she isn't alive, but she isn't like her people, she's a spirit.
---
Some sensitive Big Priests out there today. Twas but a joke. Not bad, though. Only found two in this topic...
---
They have a 8 mana legendary with a battle cry and death rattle that recruits beast from your deck
---
Sadly I don't we'll ever see a Sylvanus reprint, because she has no time for games.
---
Was about to comment that they won’t be in standard at the same time so any interaction wouldn’t really matter but then I noticed the names 💁🏻‍♂️
---
They will never do it, it will be buffing the card effectively and it's a blizzard policy not to buff cards

6 mana 5/5

Battlecry: Destroy a card with Tree in Art
---
Hi really skeptical, I'm .... nevermind
---
&gt; just instantly turn to her side when revived, all "for the dark lady" and "for the horde".
---
But isn't that how it always worked? When Sylvanas was turned undead by Arthas she was on his side despite not wanting to.
---
Thanks for posting this.  
---
  
---
Interesting that on average opening 140 packs only gets you half the epics.  
---
I'm wondering about the legendary average, you get 1 guaranteed in first 10 packs, then I thought it's on average every 20 and with pity timer set at 40 packs. Seems though your data implies as you buy more packs your chance at a legendary increases. Any speculation why that happens, is it a small chance at getting golden legendary?
---
In your first ten packs in any given set you are guaranteed a legendary. Whether that legendary is good or not it is worth dust to craft other cards. In April, three sets will be rotating (Journey to Un'Goro, Knights of the Frozen Throne, Kobolds and Catacombs), so avoid those sets because you won't be able to use those cards in standard anymore in a couple weeks.
---
So, first buy 10 "Witchwood" packs, then buy 10 "The Boomsday Project" packs, then buy 10 "Rastakhan's Rumble" packs, then buy 10 "Classic" packs. If you open a legendary before 10 packs, stop opening them.
---
The reason we do Classic packs last is because each week there is a "tavern brawl" which gives a classic pack, so you will slowly fill you your classic collection without purchasing packs.
---
You can get a free legendary by doing the solo adventure content for "Knights of the Frozen Throne." You may need to purchase one pack to unlock that.
---
I love double Fire-Eater + double Automaton for the whopping 24 damage. It's so much fun.
---
I think they're great. I mean, I love seeing the data but the actual format is also very nice and clear and easy to understand. 
---
Ah yeah. I figured it would be hard
---
Your true average is roughly 100. It doesn't matter whether you turn those cards into dust or not.  To say that your true average is 40 would mean that you assign zero value to the cards that you don't disenchant.  Whether or not you disenchant that Earth Elemental, it is still worth 100 dust.  Think about it this way:  if I give you a box that has 5 cans of coca-cola in it, each of which you can immediately sell for $1 or choose to keep, the value of that box is $5.  If you decide to keep 4 of the cans of coke and sell one, the box isn't suddenly worth only $1.

"TONIGHT, A TALE OF DISCOUNTED LICH KINGS"

You should think of this as ripping the bandaid off. Everyone has to get them at one point or another and getting them both in 1 shot gets it out of the way quickly.
---
Imagine if you got 1 and then waited for the timer to run down 25 packs or so later and getting the other one. It would hurt much more.

**Daily Reminder** that Illidan's Card is perhaps the greatest mistake of this entire game, and, if you don't feel personally insulted by how poorly he was/is treated in the Digital Card Game *Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft*, then you must readjust your life priorities.
---
they're definitely far better than 98% of content that gets posted here, please keep making them
---
But it lets more people try out the format.  I don’t think they are concerned with how skillful the format for the top pros.  The main issue they have is no casual people will have the time to dedicate 10+hrs for these tournaments with lots of waiting around.  
---
The warrior must have attacked the asari, not the drakeslayer. If the minion wouldn't survive the attack due to too low health it counters the effect of super collider.
---
I bought a displate of it to hang up in my place - such a broken card,  I love it. 
---
Idk why you got downvoted but you are correct 
---
I always had it labeled as doctor hunter in my game 
---
and if u DE him, u get him twice..
---
oh the pain.. oh the strife
---
Not always, his original card tech was really cool and interesting mechanic, obviously too strong, but also, IMO, one of the most interesting card techs in the game.
---
&gt; I love pressing the button and hearing INFERNAAAAAL!
---
Oh man, for me it's the laugh he does when you attack with the weapon. I love it!
---
My first ever ranked deck was Control Jaraxxus. I miss him.
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
What do you mean by 'some shiny hero account'?
---
If you are being prompted to start again from the tutorial, you have probably logged in to the wrong region. Log in on the server you play on (NA, EU, etc). That might fix it.
---
But nobody runs that in the same deck as Dire Frenzy
---
Well obviously it's a punishment. If you don't play around it it's your fault. You have 10+ spells and minions that mess up board control if you can't use one of them to clear around the 5th round then it's all on you. Also using it on one minion is really poor play value wise. You get a 4/4 stats on board for 5 mana. Soo poor value in one play. And what will happen next round? A big ass clear or a big ass taunt most probably.
---
Against control decks its only good to set up lethal, nothing else. Against aggro it's good only if your oppenent is unable to trade with you until this point(rare). Otherwise you probably gonna have some lit minions that he probably can deal with later in the game. Against tempo, it does complete jack shit most of the time. 
---
Good tempo play, good curve play if possible, completely balanced and usually not hard to be dealt with. The card is perfect IMHO. 
---
amazing for arena though.
---
Mechanical Whelp is the only notable one as of right now. Not enough to make this see play.
---
Oh please, Sargeras isn't important, he doesn't even have a Hearthstone card ;)
---
Can you say mecha’thun hunter
---
Code does things. You can read it to figure out what it's doing if you know how.
---
tl;dr  They retconned all the Forsaken to be evil.
---
Aaaand there's the shit Hunter legendary as usual. Take away the DK, put in more crap. 
---
Looking forward to the reveal of Mechanical Spider Egg, which is a neutral 3/0/3 Mech that summons a 5/5 Mech on Deathrattle
---
It doesn’t, but your help is still very appreciated man.
---
If only it was "Destroy it" instead of "trigger it's Deathrattle." We might have some Mechathun shenanigans back on the table.
---
If umbra is in play and it summons this, would the mech that is summoned have a double death rattle trigger? 
---
Warchief Sylvannas
---
Wish you the best of luck. If only the old gods arent gone I would bless you in the lame of yogg
---
People don't realize that this card had to die for the greater good.
---
- You can't have effect like this as a permanent. It would result a 0 mana remove a minion and occupy a slot.
---
- One option would have been to make it 3 mana and make it AOE effect. But it would have been too strong.
---
An hypothetical 3 mana enemy reduce attack stacking would have worked as a removal with Mossy and as a pseudo frost nova on it's own. But frost nova is more fair because Doomsayer Frost Nova is fair. Whereas This plus mossy wouldn't have been fair as an aoe.
---
So because you can't make it AOE and you can't either make it single target but permanent, this is the past choice. It is not ideal, but it is good that it isn't OP.
---
Don't assume they haven't tried this as an Aoe 3 mana because they did.
---
Looking forward to playing Tron in Hearthstone. 
---
When did Geblin get hall of famed?
---
Thanks!
---
I don’t think this will make inner fire priest any better though, unless a bunch of meta decks are running the kind of high health minions they want
---
Pulls Mecha'thun
---
I have been playing a mechathun hunter right now that burns through deck quite quickly. It’s better than this guys combo tho. It uses tracking+zuljin, subject 9, masked contender, and novice/loot hoarder to draw deck quickly. 
---
Well except priest can also kill minions with low attack for little mana too so this also works as 0 mana removal. The flexibility is what makes this potentially strong 
---
For a F2P:
---
So you want to buy the most optimal packs.  Essentially that will be the set that is most incomplete for you.  When a new set comes out, the set you have the fewest of is obvious.  So spend all your gold on that one.
---
But when to stop?  How much gold can you collect during one expansion?  That is how much you should spend per expansion.  If you've been saving since two months after the last expansion, do about the same thing again.  
---
Your goal really is just to spend about the same amount of gold each on each set if the goal is open the most number of unique cards.
---
ah good garbage hunter legendary
---
Yogg, why did you leave me :( 
---
lol
---
SPIRIT OF THE FLAME, TURN THEM TO ASH!
---
Yeah, I ship it too.
---
Playing two conditional cards to destroy one minion. Classic Priest.
---
Void Ripper would be way too slow since you have to reduce their attack to 0. SW Pain is much more consistent, works better with the class, and is obviously not rotating. 
---
That's so weird. Why not just let us target both? 
---
Gyarados can learn dragon moves
---
Wow you actually took that seriously. What are you like in real life?
---
How are you supposed to turn 2 ultimate infestation if you don't espionage on one though? 
---
Fireworks Tech is a thing
---
ok. honestly you've peaked my interest. I forgot about welp. 
---
Well, no, you have to play a 3/4 for 6 mana, then it needs to die to get the 10/10. So you either burn another card to trigger its deathrattle (and play dead is rotating out btw, so it's the 3 mana 3/3 atm), which cost more mana and requires an extra card (plus having the 10/10 in hand), or you wait for it to die (and not get transformed, reshuffled or silenced). And you have to have a 10/10 in you hand that would be pretty bad if you don't get this trigger, which could happen in most of your games as this is a legendary.
---
So yes, I want more.
---
f2p firelord?
---
mechanical welp is a rather slow 6 drop, and since all of hunter's deathrattle activators are rotating out, the card is even slower.
---
I've thought that 80-100 packs is where diminishing returns really kick in. That's where you complete ~all commons and most rares.
---
But, if you need to craft something the only way to generate dust is by opening more packs so it's always good to know which pack has the highest ev.
---
I don't get the appeal of it. Just reminds me of old Tower Defense maps.
---
Not sure why people are calling this useless. Can you think of any 3/4s that pulls a fuckton of stats, maybe in wild? Oh yeah it’s voidcaller but 2 more mana. But voidcaller is a backbone of one of the most broken decks in wild, in wilds broken card set.
---
Oh wow so they're keeping the hunter-mech thing around? Ngl, a bit disappointed, but this is only one card. I wonder what else is coming to support this. New deathrattle triggers and activators would help...
---
now that you wrote a comment with a much less pretentious attitude I gotta say yeah your arguments are fair and you're probably right on this one
---
Gyarados isn't a dragon type
---
this into shadow madness divine divine inner.
---
In current meta no chance and it seems unlikely in the coming meta too. A 6 mana 3/4 deathrattle: Summon a 10/10 wouldn't see play in this meta without reliable activators (both of which are rotating)
---
The secret has to be played from YOU. Secretkeeper is just very poorly worded, which really shouldn't be a blizzard game surprise.
---
Just came in to comment on the card art. Wtf is happening there???
---
Kraken can go face. End of discussion.
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if you had said this was actual art from the game. Awesome job!
---
Dang dude. That is really good. You trying to get a job in here. If you had told me this was a card from the upcoming expansion I would have believed you. 
---
Ah fuck I thought we were done with Pint Sized Cabal
---
it's Cabal shadow priest, not Kabal. This character has nothing to do with the Kabal.
---
Kraken cause crowd roaster comes out turn 7 kraken comes out turn 9 kraken wins.
---
The problem with kingsbane is its super cheap cost. It’s pretty stupid that they can raiding party, equip, buff, doomerang, and reequip all in the same turn.
---
I mean, if backs are your thing...
---
There are so many things you can imagine as potential rewards such as card backs, heroes, maybe some alternate card art or a hero frame. No reason why there couldn't be something like avatars where you can earn them like in Starcraft.
---
But knowing HS business model you'd have to pay dust/gold for all that, not wins.
---
Is it finally Piloted Reaper's time to shine? Probably not, but hey you never know. 
---
I thought this was really good at first because I misread this as “Battlecry”, but now I realize this is hot garbage.
---
&gt; Has obvious synergy with shadow word:pain and cabal shadowpriest, but it's a bad topdeck. Seems pretty balanced.
---
Being a bad topdeck isn't balanced in Hearthstone where the outcome of a game is decided by turn 6. I already hate this card because if a Priest draws this in opening hand and also draws Cabal by turn 6, they can steal any minion you have and there's absolutely nothing, except Counterspell, that you can do to play around this. So basically the formula for the next 4 months after the expansion drops is: Is it turn 6? Did Priest draw their Lazul Scheme/Cabal combo? If no, you win. If yes, you lose. This is awful design imo, it's simply to powerful at 0 mana. It should be 1 or 2 Mana and cost *something* to play.
---
Karmawhoring? Settle down dragonboy. Someone just liked an old piece of artwork and decided to share it. That's like half of reddit. 
---
Which card did blizzard reprint? I am out of the loop
---
Since you are using the BfA cinematic as an example, why not a banshee form AoE Battlecry or something?
---
But it still can learn dragon moves
---
**Vicious Scalehide**: 46.7% WR | 0.6% popularity
---
they only have to run one 8 health minion to insta lose to double divine.
---
I mean they all have an effect and summon a minion. Forbidden cards are included in the post under WotOG and all they do is spend all your mana and do something. So i think it's valid. 
---
This is even worse in standard considering play dead and terrorscale stalker are rotating, so there goes 2 of its 3 activators
---
I can see this getting you 0 attack minions fairly often, that stay that way through your opponents turn making them fairly easy to kill. Not sure this is really going to be that great of a combo with Cabal.
---
Wow.. - Owen Wilson
---
Remember spelling 'Cabal' correctly? 
---
But assassinate is conditional, it only removes tapped creatures
---
&gt;2 Mana more, but gets DR value.
---
That is not a fair trade at all.
---
Just look forward to what new OP taunt will take its place.
---
E.V.I.L. Jaina 
---
You can't play anything worth mana after forbidden words. With this you literally have all your mana left. Polar opposite
---
Hit it very hard!
---
I think that is the appeal, actually. Those games were *really* popular back in the day
---
Alextraza! You're rocking at 30 health then boom, 15 health and an 8/8 on the board, also knowing the decks that play it there's always that "oh shit, kill it and health this turn or I probably die" moment.
---
JUICYM4N#1483 NA 80g Quest trade I can go first if you have history
---
So Blizzard says Druid shouldn’t have any hard removal because of “identity” but then print multiple ways for Priest to deal with 4 attack minions? 
---
Can't be done. Committed literal genocide for what wasn't even a strategic goal, basically for the lulz
---
Because Razormaw being there means you got a Razormaw probably pretty early which usually is in games you win. Has less to do with Dire Frenzy and more with Razormaw
---
As much as I don't want them to kill off another old lore character, I think the best case scenario is if she Darth Vaders herself killing N'zoth.  Like hey, she was still evil but less evil than the bad guy and she saved us, the end.
---
As long as it
---
List of mechs to use with it:
---
* Mecha'thun - deathrattle us useless, but a 6 mana 3/4+10/10 isn't too bad  
---
* Mechanical Whelp - probably the best in standard    
---
* Spark Drill  
---
* Piloted Reaper  
---
* Replicating Menace  
---
* Weaponized Piñata  
---
* Harvest Golem  
---
* Kaboom Bot  
---
* Spider Bomb - good, but seems like a questionable pull at 6 mana  
---
* Goblin Bomb  
---
* Mecharoo  
---
* Sneed's Old Shredder  
---
* Piloted Sky Golem  
---
* Corrupted Healbot  
---
* Meat Wagon  
---
* Mechanical Yeti  
---
* Piloted Shredder  
---
* Explosive Sheep  
---
* Clockwork Gnome
---
I’m conceding against every priest this expansion it seems 
---
My thoughts exactly
---
6 mana summon a bulldozer when killed is pretty good tempo on turn 6...
---
Seriously, what made them think putting 'play' on this card was a good idea? It's inconsistent with cards like [[Mad Scientist]] which has literally the same effect, unintuitive and it's just *wrong* in the interaction with Secretkeeper.
---
Sylvanas, my opponent plays Sylvanas and my brain turns off and i call my mom and cry and i dont want to play because no matter what i do, she will pull ragnaros from my hand and take him on a date and marry him.

---

---
Hello thief priest how i have missed you
---
Meh
---
They should change the last line to "Put a Secret from your deck into the battlefield." similar to Bellringer Sentry.
---
That Whelp combo becomes much less reliable if you run spider bomb as well which could disrupt it, and relies on Shaw staying alive which is optimistic to say the least. All that for only decent value.
---
As you said, good for memes but won't see play otherwise.
---
6 mana 6/8
---
You need to have an **empty board** too, or Mecha'thun would not work.

Goblin bombs 4 dayzzzz 
---
King Togwaggle is the most triggering card + combo for me in the history of the game. If I see him it's already over.

Thats less of a 'tl;dr' and more 'refuse to read, be completely wrong, and deny reality'. 
---
...which is now gone.
---
MALYGOS
---
At first glance I thought this was a going to be a spoiler thread for a new card.
---
So the cost of the card increases each turn it's in your hand?
---
Just make a new warrior deck, stick in genn and Baku then see what autocomplete does for you
---
Control Priest isn't really known for having a powerful tempo. You aren't obliged to fill every mana slot for this deck to work
---
Now can you draw her nude
---
Galaxy brain
---
Wat.. no!
---
It's a fair card in a world where good deathrattle mechs are playable. Currently there are not enough mechs like that so if future sets don't bring synergy for this card it's probably not gonna make the cut.
---
Haven't played Standard in years, do Aggro Hunters play Dire Frenzy? Why?
---
The second copy has a deathrattle too.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
It was just overshadowed by Bonemare I believe. 
---
&gt; I don't know about the current Standard meta, but that's not true for Hearthstone in general
---
It's true for aggro and mid-range. You haven't played the game recently? For the majority of meta decks, the game is determined around turns 6 or 7. For combo and some control decks, it's closer to turns 8 or 9 (eg Wall Priest turn 9 Oakenheart). There are very few meta decks where the outcome of the game can be changed past turn 10. Odd Warrior/Control Mage are two, but they represent a minority of the meta.
---
And all of that is rotating. Hence Big J might be playable again. 
---
The biggest problem with Jaraxxus currently is going down to 15 hp typically puts you in burst range of many decks.
---
It's probably uninteractive to OP because all he does is hero power pass for 5 turns. 
---
Hey man, good chat, didn't expect to change anyone's mind, but it's kinda sad to see you plug your ears with nonsense alternating caps in the face of a dozen examples to the contrary.  Enjoy the spoiler season.
---
Only that Priest has a lot of 0 mana spells, wich is crucial for Gadgetsan Auctioneer to stall and cycle until they have their OTK pieces.
---
He's not a mech though...
---
If you spend 100 golds on an empty collection, open 4 commons and 1 rare, you're going to get 260 dusts worth of cards.  If someone else own every cards, they merely get 40 dusts in return, which is barely enough to craft a single common.  
---
When people talk about "diminishing return on pack value", this is essentially it. The more pack you opened, the more likely it is to you score a less valuable "duplicate".
---
What does it mean for you? As free to play, you will get approximately 100 packs per expansion (70 from quests, 20 from various promotions over the course of an expansion, and 10 more from your 3-wins).  This will grant you access to approximately 76% of the collections.  If you preorder an expansion, those 50 new packs will only give you access to 83% of the collection.  
---
Didn't see the title and I legit thought which set is this card from. Awesome work! 
---
LocoTurko#2260 EU 80G trade quest you go first

Technically Ben Brode said it and I think he’s been off the hearthstone team for a while now.
---
Still rocking my 'Death's Demise'
---
Well, no, HS is not a political ideology, it's a game, it's not like a vivid entity that can or cannot support rights, such as trans rights.
---
That's Ben Brode supporting Transgender Rights, not Hearthstone,
---
Just so people don't get it mixed, I support trans rights, I know people I love that are trans and I would never think less of them because of that. But mixing everything, even a god damn children card games with "transgender rights" gets annoying. Needless to say, I'm happy that Ben Brode does support them. 
---
Ehh... 2 card combo to deal with 1 creature doesn't seem good at all
---
Sorry let me finish my sentence real quick..
---
..your large minion is gone next turn and the enemy lost nothing while trading because your "large minion" is basically a 0/6 now. The enemy does not lose tempo with this
---
This is what I'm afraid of the most. It's bringing back the SC2 lore PTSD. :(
---
If there's no aggro in the meta then there's no point playing anything else than combo and then we're stuck playing solitaire. 
---
Are you seriously saying a 6 mana summon a  mana cheat/targeted card is shit? Weaker versions of it like possessed lackey and silver vanguard see play and they have worse bodies/value
---
It will be....till it leaves classic
---
Mechanical Whelp my dude, that's going to be nasty. I think everyone is going to underrate this card, and it's going to be meta-defining.

What, why would it? It reduces the enemy attack by one more each round. Cost stays the same.
---
Only if people allow the machine to do the thinking for them
---
Druid is dead. Treeants or token will work or they won’t. Druid had its time in the sun.
---
It’s time for Shaman, Rogue, and Warrior to rise.

NA Crankzone#1300 have quest will show you go first

If blizzard is making high win skins, they are NOT making other skins for standard year, bundles, etc. Development resources are finite. 
---
Its not even fun anymore
---
Love it. Thief priest is back!
---
Give her wings and forehead horns.
---
Whelp? Spider Bomb maybe? Hope for some more mechs later in the expansion
---
Either we're misunderstanding eachother or you're wrong.
---
Yeah that’s a better comparison. Maybe a step worse initially because the schemes they’ve shown so far would be pretty horrible to play the turn you drew them, while some of the spellstones are ok (not good, but ok) to play as lesser. 
---
Razormaw is the highest winrate when played, drawn and second in mulligan winrate. It's an insane card that noone seems to notice. At least in reddit. 
---
This should cost like 2 and be all enemy minions
---
dude your killing it keep them up I want one every week from now on
---
Nevaa, NEVAA take my sneeeds
---
Mecha'thun hunter is meta now bois

Goblins have [FOUR fingers](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Goblin#/media/File:Nikka_Blastbor_TCG.jpg), not five, and their hands are significantly chunkier than this guy's hands.
---
With all due respect it would not be particularly hard to make more skins. They have the ability to produce at least 9 every 4 months with the solo-content. What's the harm in making another one.

That wasn't what made him good.  It made him better.  Just playing him on an uncontested board would win you games.  The weapon is 15 damage alone and the 6/6 train would kill decks that couldn't keep up.  They flood the board?  Twisting Nether and summon a 6/6.
---
Particularly I remember how powerful it was against Reno Priest towards the end.  It was an autowin.
---
0 mana destroy a minion discard a card is playable.
---
Even if she is a little odd 😉

For 0 mana?... This is gonna be stupid.

This is why they need to release big game hunter hunter and get it over with
---
Stonehill defender :(
---
&gt; So what would be the optimal number of packs to open?
---
So many that you opened enough legendaries so that you can craft the remaining legendaries with the duplicate dust. From my experience (not calculations!) that's between 200 and 250 packs per set.
---
I watched some of his videos but his high legend run seemed more against pre nerf spell hunter. I'll see if I can find some more recent VODs.
---
$1/hour is objectively not cheap for a video game.
---
Read Dead Redemption II is like $60 with over 100 hours of gameplay. 
---
You could augmented elekk so stuff into your deck before Pocket galaxy. But with that much garbage in your deck your survivability would be so low
---
Okay, play for 2 hours a day and it's $0.50 an hour.
---
Oh wow 400 dust.
---
Oooh -- I need to fix my reno hunter up, decklist?
---
Just wait a month. The card will go back to doing nothing in Standard forever.
---
Looks like a fun card. Even if I would prefer hunter cards to focus on beasts.
---
I'd like to point out that if you have a pretty slim collection it's fucking awful.  
---
I tried it with mage for a quest and got an odd secret mage with only 1 secret yet it still thought to put subject 9 in there with kirin tor mage. I even had another secret in my deck (gain 8 armor) that it completely skipped.  
---
The rest of the deck was just random odd cards.  
---
Great tool if you've got a good collection, awful if you don't.  
---
Chuck in an auctioneer (or lyra in wild?) for that sweet cycle.
---
Problem solved! (Shamefully, I didn't know you could disable spectating!)
---
He's a Warrior in a specific mech.
---
Maybe he'll be something else in a different mech.
---
This card is so OBLIVIOUS.
---
I would like to know what my cards do before losing games to it ... It's stupid to not write what a card does on the fucking card. 
---
In magic is this joke about "read the fucking card". In hearthstone this doesn't help. You just have to play it sometimes and hope for the best.
---
Oh no, it's much worse, I was just trying to say that it's still an okay play in tandem with Cabal.
---
A super important distinction about the 71% number is this is probably only if you maximize your dust, aka get all the commons first, then rares, then epics, then legendaries, which is not how you actually want to collect the cards. 
---
Someone previously has done the math on how many packs to open, and yeah it's in the hundreds, but way before then you could craft all the cards you want, especially with legendaries like Nomi you can basically ignore. 
---
Assuming OP's numbers are reliable, you could take the integral of the equation from 0 to [total dust value of set], and whatever X value you get is the number of packs. Idr how to do the integral though since the limit at 0 is infinity.
---
And now you know! :)
---
I guess so, and like that's the fun play :) but bad still :/
---
It's one of the worst ideas I've ever seen. Developing content for like 0.01% of your players. Even at 5k wins it's absolutely horrendous haha

---
every three months? didn't know we had 4 expansion per year. 
---
The fuck? Didn’t some pros climb to legend with extremely basic decks? 
---
I’ve spent $15 and 100-150 hours in the game and I’m rank 9. 
---
Is it really a common thing to blame whales for your own misplays? 
---
I believe you're speaking from the perspective of a Mage/Warrior player. For every other class in the game, from rank 7 onwards, that's simply not the case. There are certain cards, or combination of couple of cards, that when played basically decide the outcome of the game (excepting a very few minority of decks). Examples being:
---
- Master Oakenheart and you can't clear 
---
- Zerek's Cloning gallery, Malygos and Velen on board (not in hand)
---
- T3 or T4 8/8 Edwin for a tempo Rogue
---
- Even Pally turn 4 into Call to Arms.
---
- Zoolock Flame Imp + coin + Witch Doctor + Happy Ghoul(s) -&gt; Keleseth
---
- Any Midrange Hunter with the nuts draw
---
- Cubelock that gets Skull of Manari T5 into multiple Voidlords and Doomguards from hand
---
- Evenlock with double Mountain Giant T3 and T4
---
The list goes on and on. I mean, you can put down taunt minions to slow the game ending, but playing taunts doesn't win, it just slows the outcome. Because playing minions from hand for a normal cost isn't unfair. Unfair is how decks win games, so whenever they have their winning unfair card or combination of winning unfair cards, the game is over.
---
thank you!

Just crafted sneed a week or so ago. Bring on the memes!
---
Tyrantus, especially on turn 2 against a tesspionage rogue
---
Nah, you're already get notifications about what they opened, that's enough.
---
This is funny but don't forget to flair it or it will be temporarily deleted.
---
Basically after a certain point (apparently 75ish packs) you are buying packs for the dust instead of new cards.
---
Or you could just not buy anything, be smart about your dust and gold, and be okay with probably not experiencing every single new deck.
---
Has that been confirmed? For all we know they don't want the same Standard deck to run both Booms.
---
They took your money? 
---
or did you actively give the money? It is stealing if you get something. Sure, it might not be what you were hoping for, but they clearly give you 50 packs. So I think you are being a little over dramatic.
---
You can just not buy it. So there you go. Problem solved.

From the Mage he was playing against.
---
Oh, cruel fate. They'll never be together in one deck.
---
they were good, until the lackey and pact nerf
---
How soon until Blizzard hires ramzykamen
---
Shudderwock Shaman isn't even a good deck in Wild. Malygos Shaman is a better deck, and there are far better and more "degenerate" combo decks in the format.
---
It's not worth worrying about.
---
I do. It wins me games.  Sometimes I draw all my dinosaurs, dire frenzy allows my later Katrena to not be an 8 mana 6/6.

I prefer the 78% of the time I haven't been facing hunter on ladder but if I had to choose 1 flavor of Rexxar this would do just fine
---
I legit thought this was art spoilers for a new card. I only opened up the thread to see what the card did. Nicely done human person. 
---
Do Schemes stack until 10 or do they have a limit?
---
Crowd Roaster’s got the pure epicness factor going for it, though...
---
Fairly consistent 0.5-0.6 legends per 18 packs (rounding would put the answer somewhere in the middle) so what do you mean by increasing chances? 
---
he's gonna use it with sneed's for sure
---
Fucking amazing in Wild, especially with Shadow Visions, Shrinkmeister etc. My Thief Priest grows stronger!
---
Cards like this are the reason I quit Hearthstone.
---
Hmm? 
---
...What exactly is her scheme?
---
Same with arena drafts, having to use discord to share screen with friends is a bit of a hassle
---
Well hunter always gets the worst legendaries (or at least in the bottom 3) so it’s not a surprise, hopefully there will be better late game then what we have now.
---
If you like random, you can make tesspionage rouge
---
The dust number I used is the dust for that tier, subtracted by the previous tier. So the dust that can be linked specifically to the last 10 packs. 
---
I hope it doesnt work like how it says. Let's say we have two mechs one of them has deathrattle, other does not. This can summon the one that doeant have deathrattle but i think it should prioritize the one with dr
---
How the guy u are replying to is +30 and u are +8?  It's literally his frickin job to shoot water.  Of COURSE he can.

I think you don't know what interactive means.
---
This card is super interactive. you can see when your opponent is setting up for it, you can play to have a board clear for when they want to do it, after or before.
---
If your opponent has 3 minions, one of my favourite things to do is freeze the middle minion and then, even if they use Fungal, they are only getting half of his power.
---
Either you are not good at this game, or like I said, you don't know the meaning of interactive.
---
Oops
---
What about Shifter Zerus and Chameleos then?
---
it's probably pretty strong if you just started playing and have around 2 cards for warrior that are rare or better.
---
Me too, fuck hunters
