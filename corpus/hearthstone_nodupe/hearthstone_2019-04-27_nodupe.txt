packs or not, i really hope the game continues to move forward and improve and learn from previous mistakes.

Don‚Äôt let Hearthstone become the next Heroes of the Storm.

Thank you!

Despite the sometimes toxic levels of saltiness, the subreddit is more often rather fun to lurk and participate in at times. There are days on which I spend more time here than the game itself. Cheers to more followers to come and for the nice community, including the devs, community managers and mods.
---
Yeah should've been more specific. When I say get by on pre-orders, Im including all the free content.
---
I'm in :)
---
No. Blizzard should not be trying to add more classes instead of trying to balance old classes.

[OBLIGATORY COMMENT THAT TRIES TOO HARD TO SOUND LIKE I'M NOT JUST HERE JUST FOR PACKS](https://i.imgur.com/BwEcW5I.jpg)
---
give me my packs
---
ok cool
---
Hey
---
i don't have anything witty to say, just hoping for free packs
---
I would say my experience is probably about 33% is rage and the rest just wanna ask about my deck. Most people are pretty cool and I've met a lot of cool ppl by accepting requests. I never engage anyone salty though I just remove them. Not worth my time or energy. I'm fine living in their head rent-free
---
*sigh*
---
comment.
---
This is so sweet!
---
Free packs? I want in
---
I get it, i mean I commented as well.
---
Amazing.
---
I think the first nerf of this expansion cycle will happen about a week after May 2nd.
---
Free packs!
---
Thanks you for another free pack draw, not going to expect myself to win it but hope the person who win will enjoy it.
---
If we enjoy it too much to stop playing, how could it possibly be a shitfest?
---
ez packs
---
Preorder specifically means spending real money to buy an bundle at promotional prices.
---
Are you using it differently to refer to saved up gold that you spend on expansion release?
---
&gt;You just need equivalency.
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ‚õè‚õè
---
Can I get in on some free packs?
---
Wait, they're gonna just *do* that?
---
I might as well throw my hat into this.
---
Maybe winning some RoS packs will convince me to play Hearthstone more regularly again.
---
Thanks for the opportunity, and congrats on 1 million.
---
WOOP WOOP!!
---
Obligatory comment cos I‚Äôm poor
---
Eh, alright. Let's roll.
---
i hope once it happens thye dont gut classic and basic instead of the expansion cards.
---
Thanks!
---
Good luck everyone!
---
Ah, I see, thank you!!
---
Free packs!!
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
1 million is a lot!
---
Me, me
---
Hello
---
Nah, they won‚Äôt, 9 is already hard enough to balance.
---
Woo, one whole million!
---
Oh, didn‚Äôt know balancing was an issue
---
thank you so much hearthstone means a lot to me
---
Awesome!
---
I too enjoy getting the chance to win prizes.
---
I‚Äôll take some free packs plz and thanks.
---
Dope
---
Awesome
---
Nice unique deck! I like it. You deserved that win
---
I can confirm, had 2x Hunter quest (2 &amp; 3 wins) yesterday and didn't feel like playing Standard, so I looked for a Wild deck. Got them done in like 10 minutes. Won two games on Turn 5, 4 and 3 (Concede from the opponent). When you curve out, it's crazy fast.
---
gimme packs. do it for... for NA's sake

I used to be a good arena player, but I barely play this game anymore. Isn't rogue the best class in arena, like it often was?
---
I'm in!

OMG I NEED THOSE PACKS PLEASEE, I've opened like 15 with no legendaries :'( hahahah. Good luck everyone!! ‚ô• Been playing since Pandaria Cardback .

almost got rid of my final few friends - I'm guessing Legend is awarded automatically? the instructions are a little unclear

Wow, thanks! Also yay 1mil subs

I just got back into it and I‚Äôm falling in love with card games all over again.

I mostly play arena so this might not apply, but generally if I lose to an insane deck below 5 wins they wont accept my friend request, because they probably assume I'm mad at them for losing, even though I just want to went with them about how sick their deck is and spectate a game or two. But any friend request I've send and received above 5 wins have been really friendly. I think the anger has something to do with how many games they've lost to the exact same deck you played before they played you, and less to do with RNG in the game.
---
Comment i guess

That's real rad.

DS265: give up, press your pathetic concede button already
---
OP, looks down, face hidden from view, thinks: "perhaps he is right, I can't see a way out, is there anything I can do"
---
somewhere in the background: "believe OP, believe in the heart of cards, believe in your deck, and believe in our friendship"
---
OP looks up: "that's right, I can't give up here, I need to believe"
---
DS265: "haha, what's belief going to do to save you from your despair, you have 2 HP, and when you pass, my hero power will finish you off. you obviously don't have any card in your hand that can save you, and you don't have enough HP to tap for another card, face it, you lost, OP"
---
OP: "there is never 'no chance', I believe in my deck, and I will show you what it can do"
---
OP taps and draws, DS265: "hahahahahahaha, you just committed suicide, hahahahaha..." 
---
DS265 stops mid-evil-laugh, "nani, how are you at 4 HP, your tap should have killed you"
---
OP, reveals aranasi drawn: "the heart of the cards always answers my call"
---
DS265: "impossible, no one has ever been able to survive a suicide life tap"
---
Thanks for doing this!

Holy moly.

For the first time one of my off meta decks has been successful,.I was stuck playing odd decks in rank 20, now I‚Äôm rank 4 playing a Murloc Shudderwock deck.

I like free things.

Looking at comments and definitely agree dire frenzy is the way to go. Not sure about which target is best though. I like putting it on Highmane if I can or the 5/5 rush minion, but recently tried it on Scalehide and that is nice too since it'll give you healing. Maybe that's better for aggro though. Anyways, dire frenzy all the way lol.

I'm curious, did you plan to give away free packs from the start or was it just because of this guy's comment?

Thanks this confused me as well, for some stupid reason.

Yeet

I would not want to expect this in the upcoming expansion. Rumble run being a free pve content is fine but if I am paying for it it would be expected that the glitches are ironed out
---
Thanks for all the effort! I know sometimes this subreddit is not the easiest to deal with, so we really appreciate the HS team sticking around.

Tl;DR: Sally is frequently too situational to be usable, especially in hunter, deathrattle synergy is pretty much useless in this case

---
Simply put, decks designed and refined by hundreds of people will tend to be better than those designed and refined by one person. No matter what you do too, players will naturally drift towards what tends to win most often.
---
If you are insistent in making a Jalani Value Mage deck work, you are going to need to play stuff like Shooting Star and Blast Wave. However, you will struggle with Token Druid pretty much no matter what you do unless what you do is take Khadgar Dragon Mage, remove how ever many cards from it necessary to make it off meta, and replace it with all of the stuff you need to spam Ragnaros.
---
Generally though, you'll find more success with homebrew decks at least up to rank ten in Wild due to the much, much larger card pool.
---
Also, Academic Espionage isn't that great of a card, and this format isn't that aggressive.

As far as i'm aware it mainly comes from older online competitive games, where the winner saying GG first is considered dis-respectful or BM, since it usually would be the case, so usually the loser would say GG first to let their opponent know that they concede the game, then the winner would in a sense of manners and respect.
---
Great! Any chance to win free packs is appreciated. Thank you.
---
Wall resurrect priest is good but not that good imo, aggro decks wrecks you, and long control match up doesn't seem to benefit you either. Uncanny!
---
As a broke student, I'd be able to use those packs for so much procrastination!
---
It's really great to see Blizzard be so involved in the Reddit community for Hearthstone. A lot more gets said and expressed here than in the actual game forums so it's nice it gets paid attention to!

Congratulations man, now go clear the witch hunt thing!

That's very generous, thanks for doing this!

Really crazy game. I was playing the Whizbang Espionage Rogue deck against a Warrior {{Mecha'thun}}. I drew hardly anything to throw down all game while the other side drew out their deck. Last-ditch {{Face Collectors}} gave me {{Azalina Soulthief}}, so I went hail mary and used Myra's Unstable Element to draw out my deck and steal his hand. 
---
Used (exactly) 3 armor remaining from his Weapons Project to remove her with Shield Slam, then threw down Mecha'thun (which he'd discounted with Galvanizers) and prayed. Fatigue hadn't left him with much armor, so he had no choice but to rush his own Mecha-'thun into mine, and the game ended in a draw.
---
It's a mistake, the deck in tier two is Mind Blast Priest. I've fixed it just now.

---
ooh i saw this on hsreplay earlier and played it thinking it was going to be a gimmick
---
i found that if you face aggro, you're probably going to get stomped unless you are lucky and can play mana cyclone to get spells back. but otherwise if you combo it alongside with flamewaker+sorcerers you'll probably chunk their health down by a lot and can finish it off with your newly generated spells

---
This is a response to your deleted comment, so some things may not fully align. My moral intuition aligns with yours. I am not in disagreement with your reasoning.
---
Where we disagree is how much blame there is to assign to Roger and his teammates. I am of the opinion that there could have been a misunderstanding on their part. I think that they probably knew that getting knowledge of what was burned by tracking is gaining an unfair advantage, but I don't think they knew that there was an explicit rule that could have gotten them disqualified for it. The team uploaded the incriminating video themselves. That's gotta speak to some fundamental misunderstanding of how the rules operate.
---
Further, what is morally wrong isn't necessarily cheating. For example, if I tech in a Nozdormu against a player who I know has a disability causing them to input commands slowly, then it's morally repugnant but not cheating. (Is it? I'm starting to confuse myself now.)
---
I think if they stopped to think about whether what they were doing was cheating they would have landed on the side that it was. But they didn't, likely because they were so tunnel visioned into attempting to win using all tools at their disposal. They might have known what they were doing was morally questionable, but I'm unconvinced they knowingly cheated. 
---
Also, Shaxy had already acted on the information he gained from the external source. What would you do you in that situation if you felt your teammate cheated? The honourable thing would be to turn your team in right then and there and concede the match. I don't see many people doing that. I'm not sure I would do the right thing there either.
---
Culture was more of a difference in gaming culture rather than geographical. My understanding that ghosting is very common, even if deemed unsporting, in certain games such as CS:GO. I'm not familiar enough with the Taiwanese streamers and competitors to know whether there's a difference in attitude regarding ghosting and stream sniping. I'm saying there is potential for cultural differences, not that there definitely is. Once again I circle back to the fact to that they uploaded the incriminating video themselves, which alerts me to a fundamental disconnect between my moral intuition and the team members.
---
Can confirm.

i mean you could get so many actual games for that much

160$ for 4 legendaries and a bunch of other virtual cards that you can't even trade seems like a huge waste

I played a few varients of tempo mage the week following rotation and found the cute dart frogs generally suck :( mana addict can be good but often felt like a win more card, obviously insanely good with quest tho. 
---
And i was of the understanding that the flamewaker was a staple/must have for tempo mage back when it was in standard. Maybe ive been misinformed but it definitely seems insanely good here.

Wait, he has the cannon strapped to his body? I always thought he was sitting on the cannon...

So you do suck at the game, too, right? Cause first you mention how ppl shoud just adjust to the rock-paper-scissor situation and then you still cry about Mad Genius...and funny enough, you cry about that card for the last 2 weeks. If it's so easy to adjust why don't you do it? Cause the card ain't broken. It has a huge RNG effect and the random generation of the card is not worse than any other random generation right now (just look at everything Rogue can create...or Mage...or Hagatha...)
---
I think you just got beaten by a Warrior again so it's time to QQ about the bad and evil Warrior Hero Card again that seems to ruin the life of so many aggro deck players right now that it's actually funny.
---
So tl;dr: Everybody but me sucks, but please nerf Mad Genius cause I can't win against it.
---
And no, the meta is not in a good state. There's the same balance issues that are ongoing forever. They just shift from class to class.
---
People dont like jokes here apparently.
---
Yes the game is very diverse right now. I don't think most people on here suck, but sometimes it seems the ones that suck have the loudest voice and the strongest opinions.
---
TIL you can get the legend card back in Wild
---
UAAAAAH, GOOOLDEN... common.
---
Give me packksss
---
I hope I dont have to write something creative to get them
---
What are your opinions about the battlecry of Dr.Boom? I think Rush part is what makes the cards so strong when you have Devastator or Dynomatic with rush on top.
---

Does your Twitch Link show up in your battle.net account? Login there and check under Connections.
---
They recently changed their site, might be that that kicked the connection somehow and even though it shows up in Twitch it doesn't get "recognized" by the b.net?
---
Also as others said, appearently the drops seem to be disabled now...god knows why.
---
Guess you can try reach out to them on Twitter but I doubt that someone will read it.

I used it to climb from rank 14 to 4, where I'm currently grinding with about a 55% - 60% win rate. From 14 to 5 it was almost one big win streak.

I have adjusted. I play Malygos rogue now. I just had an 11 game winning streak from rank 5 to 3 and haven't lost to a single warrior.
---
&gt; Yikes. Tried to build a pogo rogue deck and ended up with tempo rogue with 2 dead cards
---
I mean, no it's a lot further from the tempo rogue list than that.
---
(Runs 2 Togwaggle's Scheme, 1 lab recruiter, 2 witchwood piper, 2 vanish, and 2 pogos of course.  And a few others that are tech options in tempo rogue but not common like 2 Shadowstep, 2 Fan of Knives, 1 sprint).
---
I'd like to note that this deck is basically loaded up on card draw.  Myra's, 1 Sprint, 2 Raiding Party, 2 Fan of Knives.  I think that's the reason it's running the Raiding Party package: just to draw through the deck.

---
If you're refering to the Stag Druid then yes, Token Druid outplays it in the Meta.
---
Still a fun deck though.
---
Worth trying
---
Commmmmment
---
I don't think it's fine, or Hagatha.  They were fine when there were DK's available.  Right now You cannot play any control deck that is not Warrior or Shaman.  It is impossible to outvalue them, you really can't even come close without making a deck that loses to everything else.  It seems like a huge design flaw to have 2 decks that retain ridiculous hero's while everyone else is stuck using hero powers that are 5 years old.
---
Yes that's what mean. You basically have to play a ultra-aggressive zoo to beat them and hope you get Rafaam. You can't play any another warlock. Bomb warrior punishes the entire class. It's like if they printed the card "if your opponent has gained 10 armor with their hero power this game destroy their hero". Sure you could still win but it's completely bullshit.

Aggro is good. Last year OTK decks had the same amount of stalling tools as control decks and it was very bad for the game's health. We now have okay aggro decks and control decks with tools to combat combo so that we don't have to watch a game of solitaire every time we'd queue into a combo deck.

If anyone ever thinks that, then comic books are usually the wrong genre. I think Watchmen is one of the few exceptions where the good guys don't really win. Although, there are not many "good" guys to begin with.

He never actual got caught wintrading by blizzard people just inferred it happened from stream recording. I don‚Äôt believe blizzard has banned anyone for wintrading based a streams but only based on a pattern of behavior like naiman.

The stream sniping thing was a team thing and they didn‚Äôt feel like punishing all the individual members of the team.

get out of here with your logical arguments please... those are definitely pyjama pants

character deaths? nice spoiler, now i'm just going to be asking myself who dies for 3 straight hours.. thanks

YEET PLEASE BLESS MEEEEEEEE DADDY BLIZZARDDDD

It drew the bomb. The bomb blew up and drew another card. The fact that the second card could have also been drawn by storm chaser is just coincidence
---
Much thanks blizzard!

DodoBot#1232. Got a quest to trade with you.
---
Because people are too used to prices like 9.99, and do not compare between the monetary units often. $9.99=8.95‚Ç¨, which really isn't that big of a difference, so might as well keep it higher. 9.99‚Ç¨=$11.15, at which point the dollar cost goes above $10, which simply *looks* significantly larger than something below it to people's dumb brains. At least that's based on the prevalent reasoning behind why stores use X.99 prices a lot (especially  X9.99)
---
I mean you gotta try
---
Yes, but the real question is, if the bomb is treated as a spell. Obviously it shouldn't be, but this example proves otherwise.
---
If you have fun playing mid range hunter every season, every year then I'm fine by that. And no hunter before ungoro sucked so the "since day 1" statement isn't true. 
---
As a regular in these ranks I could argue that mid range hunter wasn't always as consistent as you think and there were completely dry metas for it between the ungoro launch. Still mid range hunter in this meta, while it works its not consistent and it gets beaten by many other decks thus you won't see many in high ranks. 
---
Also don't forget the point of the initial comment I replied. Having 3 classes max. If you only play hunter for example and next expansion hunter sux then you have no deck to play with which is the initial point. If a deck that you like more than midrange hunter appears in a class that you don't have cards then you can't make it. As simple as that.
---
Seems to be worse on this latest patch, just from my own experience
---
But it wouldn't keep enchantments, unless Thanos switched to using Kingsbane instead
---
Love you back HS team you are great people
---
I hate that spam. Just cheer for viper instead
---
Its pretty easy to get in, but it takes time to learn the different classes and how to utilize your cards or not to play cards at all during a turn. Trump (not the president), got some nice intro videos on youtube on the different classes/heroes. Playing warlock is very different from rogue f.ex
---
I need to track that as I have never really tracked winrate before. I do think out of my last 10 games with the deck I have won at least 6 times. I will have to install a stat tracker app to record my stats.
---
Yea, but do you have to enchant the infinity gauntlet to make it work?
---
I could say that you are a rare case. More like the exception and not the rule. Glad it works for you though.
---
Hey this has nothing to do with this post just wanted to say that if you are looking to build a decent collection, throwing money at the game won't help much. You build a collection by completing daily quests daily for a long period of time. Spending money just gives that a small boost.
---
Just saying this because a lot of people seem to think they just have to spend $100 or more and then they will have a good collection. This mindset often leads to disappointments unless you rly have a shitton of money to spend on this game.
---
Depend on how aggressive your deck is. If smorc go for kc. If control value go for second one.
---
Ok, it's cool.
---
What's with the BM?

Hi!

I thought its 4 hours of watchtime every day of tournament. Which is make sense. 4 days, 4 packs, ton of people watching till finals. No way I am the only one.

1 pack is just meh. Classic blizzard.
---
Nice, just few days into HS!
---
I'll take that chance ;)
---
Yeah but dropping soulpriest isn‚Äôt lethal because you have no way to kill the 2/2 undatakah. 9mana, drop soulpriest 5mana, attack with 8/5 brings him to 16hp, attack with 2/1 to 14hp, SW:Death 8/5 to 4hp 2mana then ping face 2hp 0mana. Can‚Äôt clone. If you clone then you can ping it.
---
That's awesome, what a wonderful subreddit we have!

Hey Boys

Congrats! Packs are awesome.

Wow, great stuff!

It shouldn't be a spell? It says *cast* when drawn...
---
game 1?
---
Although i do wish it said cats when drawn
---
That's nothing, War Golem is way stronger than Wisp and they're both in standard too. Clearly the only way to balance this is to give wisp 6 extra attack and health.

JFC 21 movies wasn't enough. They already told the stories without central characters from the comics. Now they own those characters again, but the stories are done and people are dead, so they can't tell the stories correctly. This entire thing is a clusterfuck. I get that they are probably decently fun movies, but there wouldn't be this kind of hype for the return of Christ.

1 through 5 you see stuff like this all the time.  People draft some crazy high roll combo (which is a terrible idea) and they don't make it far.  They usually lose early on so it's why 0-1, 0-2 can have some tilting losses.
---
Synergies are fine in arena, but what is great is stand alone value.  So many times I've seen posts like "look I drafted the whole Shudderwock combo in arena!" And then they go 0-3.  Combos work in standard because THE REST OF THE DECK is what wins you the game, not the combo.  The rest of your deck has to be able to carry dead cards in hand and put you in a position to win.
---
Stream sniping is definitely common in Hearthstone. I hadn't even heard of the term before Kripp got constantly sniped in 2014. I don't know if they've done something to mitigate it since those times, but it used to be super common.

I don't think so. Bomb is very different from Control. Bomb has now wrenchcalibur, seaforium, order a bomb, elek and boommaster and sometimes greenskin. So that is like 10 cards different. But ok.

Top 3 metas is subjective to what you like and whilst I disagree with that I agree with the rest of your post.

I usually just play what I find to be a stupidly fun meme deck but dont get upset when I lose because I know my deck is simply not good.

It works similarly with prismatic lense, you can pull a minion and a bomb, the bomb will explode and not exchange its cost with the minion. So basically your prismatic lense turns into 4 mana draw 2 cards and take 5 damage

I mean it wasn't words but a gif, in those images you can know where the plot is going from the beginning. Everybody was blind during the whole movie, except me I knew what was going to happen in the end so I knew what every character was doing when the viewer shouldn't know. The magic of those kind of movies is the plot, there are other things, sure, but knowing what and how is going to happen takes the magic away.

Yeah the good RNG doesnt really feel fun or rewarding while the bad RNG makes me really pissed and quit the game for a week.

nice
---
But Mecha'Thun isn't a card you can just throw in as a single card solution. You're either running the Malygos Boomship 2x Inner Rage 1x Whirlwind package, or the Undatakah Devastate Inner Rage/Whirlwind (and typically second copies of Devastate and Whirlwind so the first copy drawn isn't a dead combo piece) package. 
---
So the mere existence of Elysiana is then forcing Control Warrior to include either Elysiana + Banker, or a 6+ card Mecha'Thun package.
---
None of that sounds healthy to me.
---
A single card that basically no one finds fun has warped the necessary design of an entire archetype.

I'm gonna take your comment as a joke, but at least one person agrees with it unironically so:
---
Is it drama inducing? As much as this post? That reynad video someone linked is so spot on about this subreddit. 
---
Actually, I'm gonna get on my soapbox right now. I'm sure it's just an inevitability for anything with large amounts of people but Reddit loves it's hate-jerks and witch hunts. It's so tiring.
---
It's not as bad as Rock Paper Scissor, true, but RPS is fucking garbage and not fun at all, so that's setting the bar quite low. You'd need to be *significantly* above RPS for the game to feel skillful and fun, and not like you lost the game when the matchmaker found your opponent.
---
Last year there were matchups in the 20-80 range, and even some (before some nerfs) were 10-90... That's just 10-20% above Rock Paper Scissor. Meaning, if you were to play 10 games of hearthstone with these decks and weren't lucky on the matchmaker, you really well could win just *one or two* more games than you would if you played rock paper scissor and told your opponent what you were playing every turn (always paper) so he would play always scissor and you lose 10 out of 10.
---
This expansion is less polarizing, I grant you, but there are still matchups in the 30-70.
---
And I'm not talking about garbage tier 7 meme decks... I'm talking about meta decks, tier 1 and tier 2. Plenty of 30-70 and 35-65. Sure it's better than RPS, but they're still twice as likely to win just because the matchmaker gave them the deck that's good against you. And sure you can counter that deck... But you don't decide if he's your next opponent. If you play the deck to counter that one and they match you against the other deck that counter yours, then you're 30-70 again. 
---
And I'm not saying this as a "I always lose, blame blizzard!"... Sometimes I also have the upper hand and I'm the one with 70% because I was lucky on the matchmaker, so I win. I'd rather win because I was better than my opponent (or lose because he was better), over winning/losing because the matchmaker decided to give a 40% edge to one of the player.
---
Sure, if you're a good player you could turn the 30-70 into 35-65, and the 70-30 into 75-25... But the overall feel is the same, you'll lost most of your 35-65 because the pairing, and you'll win the 75-25 for the same reason, even if you'll win a bit more than the average players in the same situation.

He is the one that does something wrong here. Okay, you can and should blame Blizzard for not taking action. But at the origin lies his cheating and lack of honesty.

Which does not excuse the parking over the lines. And benefit of the doubt is fine, but the parking over the lines clearly indicates that they DO NOT give one flying fuck about doing things correctly. This evidence implies that they indeed MIGHT NOT have a handicaped placard.

They updated the autocomplete feature for the decks and you now get the best possible deck with your current collection and rank.
---
Use that

Lol, "a few 50 pack bundles" doesn't even get you close to crafting every deck.

Shameless ‚Äú100% win rate‚Äù clickbait videos. I‚Äôve seen him and his community take the ‚ÄúU mad?‚Äù stance and just chalk it up to people overreacting. I‚Äôd normally be on that side of the argument but how he acts now really just rubs me the wrong way.

He‚Äôs recently adapted this douchey ‚ÄúAll we do is win‚Äù type character with indoor sunglasses and a suit, but you can tell that he‚Äôs not even being entirely sarcastic.

His content when he was behind the Toast mask I though was some of the most refreshing and interesting hearthstone content, so to see him kind of just be an asshole is really disappointing. I genuinely think his success has gone to his head.

Actually that's not right. It's because there are no 11 cost minions in standard (the only one is [[Snowfury Giant]] afaik, which rotated out), so it doesn't transform.

There are no longer any 11 mana minions (since snowfury giant has rotated) and so it can‚Äôt transform the sea giant into a minion that costs one more and thus, it does nothing

‚ÄúOh yeah if I accuse people of lacking critical thinking for disagreeing with me that will show them!‚ÄùOr you know, maybe what Blizzard has works for them and it‚Äôs okay to personally disagree with it without turning it into a moral crusade where the only alternatives are greed, stupidity or incompetence.

High margins don‚Äôt make a scam, value to most consumers has nothing to do with margins. If customers are happy enough with the prices to keep buying packs then why should Blizzard make any changes?

I've spent some time experimenting with different cards in the Bloodmage Thalnos slot. Most of my climb was with a second Brawl, and I found that Omega Devastator works pretty well too.
---
I prefer Thalnos over Loot Hoarder because of the synergy with Warpath and Whirlwind. I'm really surprised that other deck lists I've seen don't run double Whirlwind. I wouldn't swap it for anything. Besides being good against tokens, it prevents you from having a dead card in hand that could cause you to overdraw. For example, Acolyte + Whirlwind + Warpath lets you effectively cycle three cards when your hand is almost full.
---
Here is my final boss legend game versus a Mech Hunter where the Thalnos/Whirlwind combo provided a key tempo swing in the early game:
---
https://hsreplay.net/replay/vsQAkLSckDFNWWhjaVBuZk#turn=4b
---
I'm pretty proud of this win since Mech Hunter is one of the most unfavored matchups for this deck. Same goes for Druid, which I also saw a lot of on my climb. I found that the best strategy for both matchups is to play for board control rather than just drawing to a combo. To that end, I almost always take advantage of Dr. Boom's Delivery Drone, and often plan on playing Boomship early.
---
Against Token Druids specifically, it was almost impossible to win if I couldn't clear a couple of their boards with just minions, weapon and hero power since there's not enough AoE to go around. Zoolocks and Murloc Shamans, on the other hand, would tend to run out of gas after a few good clears.
---
Rogues and Warriors (bomb or control) were the best matchups on my climb, and were fortunately the two most prevalent classes I encountered on the ladder.
---
The warrior matchups were pretty straightforward (remove Wrenches, kill Eleks, draw fast and win). To beat the Rogues I had to keep a careful eye on my health + armor total, making sure to smash that armor button every chance I got. That being said, I wouldn't recommend skipping Dr. Boom if there's a safe opportunity to play him.
---
Out of hundreds of games, I only had one match that I'm pretty sure was a mirror (I won so can't be 100% sure). That's surprising since Mecha'thun Warrior is so strong in the current meta. I'm sure we'll see much more of it in the near future.
---
Well, that's it. I'm thinking about writing a full guide for /r/CompetitiveHS but I think this wall of text is enough for now.

Yeah, it is rather expensive up front. Like others stated, the only way to get Wild Packs is through the Onlime Shop. Other than that, getting together a cheap competitive deck and getting to R5 every month (standard or wild) for that golden Epic can be steady, if slow dust in addition to the normal methods.
---
Fortunately, many of the epics/legendaries required are also staples for Wild Warlock in general, so it's not an investment limited to only one deck.

I have watched more than 4 hours each lat 2 days and i got no packs.
---
&gt;That sounds like something you should take up with the mods though. They're the ones that can control what posts get through. If the mods don't throw out posts that get the signal mixed up, then clearly they don't care about a focused communication channel between people like you and Team 5, right?
---
Mods just get accused of shilling or sucking Blizzard‚Äôs dick if they go around deleting people‚Äôs complaint posts. It‚Äôs lose-lose to them.
---
Because it's useless and it's just noise.  Blizzard isn't going to give you a pack for server downtime.  I'd rather complain about things that have a chance of changing.  There's no chance Blizzard is going to just start randomly giving out free packs, but maybe if the community complains loudly enough, they could change some of the things that make the game so expensive in the first place (like duplicate Epics, commons disenchanting for nothing, PvE behind a paywall, only 3.3 gold per win, etc).
---
Even that's a stretch, because we can see the game getting more expensive/greedy, not less.  But on the "waste-of-time-o-meter", asking for a free pack for essentially no reason scores a perfect 10.
