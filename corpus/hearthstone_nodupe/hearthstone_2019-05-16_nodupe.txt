&gt; A preset deck with completely unique cards and an unspecified hero power. 
---

---
Dude, you seem to think that it has to be 30 unique cards and a completely different Hero Power.
---
That was never what was being suggested. It could be a preset deck that uses mostly Priest cards, with 2 or 3 unique uncollectable ones. Or a Warlock deck with a different Hero Power.
---
&gt; People were comparing it to adventure bosses, how is this not a whole different class; besides new cards being released there's virtually 0 difference.
---
Even if it were 30 wholly unique cards and a completely different Hero Power, that's still nowhere near comparable to a new class. A new class is *hundreds* of new cards that can be used in, like I said, countless combinations. 
---
Every card that is made for a preset deck **was made specifically for that preset deck.** It means you don't even have to worry about interactions with powerful neutral cards like Zilliax or Leeroy Jenkins. The design space is extremely broad because you are contrasting those cards only in relation to the 29 others.
---
That is far, far, far, far, *far* easier than a whole new class. I don't think you understand how much having the deck being *preset* makes it far more controllable.
---
---
---
now there are two of them!
---
Switching the view off of Trump as he was about to Mind Control an entire board of giant minions should be a crime.
---
having less decks makes things more consistent
---
Only fair after the lengthy paws for a recount.
---
Whole year you mean next 3 years cause holy crap
---
I just spammed loatheb till they died
---
Design your card and post it to /r/customhearthstone . Most of the time they will find better wording and correct your flaws.
---
Sounds good to me, if everyone uses that logic i should win 75 percent of the time by just not conceding.
---
I have this problem too, reinstalling dindt help :(
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. We relayed that feedback but there‚Äôs not much to be done when the moment is passed. Next time!
---
are you on mobile? it might have just been taken from that, they did some stuff to lower download times recently.
---
iOS version fails for me as well. Thought it was my wifi but cellular data failed too.
---
Then I went to a completely different place and it fails on wifi here too. Definitely not my network connection, this is a blizzard issue
---
I believe it already pays itself as a draw
---
&gt; Would stop playing and criticising it help that?
---
If people left the game until the changes they wanted were added and they returned when those changes were made, sure. What you're assuming is that the people leave and don't come back. If Blizzard/Team 5 doesn't make the changes people demand and leave because of, then they're shitty developers/business people.
---
Is this a regional release where I‚Äôll play it before midnight because I‚Äôm on the west
---
badically it kills itself
---
None of those numbers are truly confirmed though. They have specifically said there is no timer for any card. Legendaries can be as late 50 packs or more for some although it is common for people to open them well before it. I was simply saying the general statistics for common consistencies for the person to find the actual average itself. I admit I used the term average very liberally in a non-technical way but to just say I‚Äôm wrong as say statistics that are even more closed minded is just the same.
---
Also you can‚Äôt run in the level, so no rushin
---
But it matched the hp..

HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON
---
So for an experiment I played 5 games today in ranked at rank 20 per usual.
---
0 - 5
---
Used a war deck that Kripp has on hearthpwn.  Exactly.
---
Final game was against another war.  I died of coarse.  He had 30 HP 24 armor at the end.  Every card I played he killed.
---
...this is how rank 20 goes.  I cant be the only one that has this happen to them at 20.  These people I play should not be my rank.  They should be playing much better players, not bottom feeding 5 wins for card backs.
---
Its ***wild****,* what do you expect?
---
And I'm over here with one rare 4 commons every pack
---
It's standard.
---
Compared to the adventures of old it is really poor value.  You knew what you were getting with each wing.  Sure you got less cards but they were generally good cards rather then duplicates of what you already had.
---
Don't like to see people complain? *No one is forcing you to come to the subreddit*
---
Someone saw how many points Kripp and Trump has yesterday? So stop bullshiting that toast get fcked, because if we will count all points once over again Kripp and Trump will easily win.
---
How else would you evaluate packs objectively? I'm talking about value in a guaranteed, quantifiable way. It doesn't matter how many packs you've opened, because if you go to the store tomorrow with $20, you have 3 choices to make if you want cards: you can spend it on 15 packs of 1 expansion, spend it on some combination of packs from different expansions (which will be less than 15 packs because packs are cheaper in bulk), or you can buy the solo content. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My point is that the solo content is basically equivalent to 15 packs of 1 expansion in terms of dust. Obviously, if you already have the entire rise of shadows collection, and you don't care about the solo content, then your $20 is better spent on 15 packs of expansions. Let me know if I missed your point, because besides saying my evaluation of pack value is wrong, I'm not really sure what your point was.
---
What a joke of a tournament organization, get your shit together or quit.
---
Lol congrats on your first golden hero by the way, I'm at just about 200 wins on Priest so I've a ways to go yet. I can't wait to get that golden hero power for an extra snazzy turn 2 heal opponent's face into Greetings

nice complaining thread you created
---
Not OP but when i try and launch the game on ios the "Hearthstone" board shows up and the game immediately shuts down, this happened after the update and i have redownloaded the game about 6 times and signed in and out of the app store. I'm assuming the game is just broken on iso honestly
---
Now put this as the card art for the version that is translated 18 times.

Will try. Thanks!

I'm poking around from our side, so far nothing seems out of the ordinary. We're seeing population level on iOS is in keeping with the normal trend. Are you connecting over WiFi or cellular?

Sorry about that, this is my first post. Let me know if I need to make any other adjustments

rule of thumb is 100 dust / pack, pretty sure someone posted data from 300ish packs last expansion and averaged at 96 per pack
---
Thanks! It's annoying having to deal with ignorant trolls like this dude but you get over it lol.

I've also seen plenty of posts complaining exactly like yours. You're apart of the problem too lol.

They are mad because its more like dungeon run than an actual adventure
---
They lost because points don't matter when the last round gives more points than feasibly should, and Kripp got unlucky in the last round... He deserved the money.
---
Combos arent exactly meta, and your win condition against combos is not disrupting them anyway.
---
As an aggro deck, if your opponent survived long enough to play a combo, chances are you have been in topdeck mode for a while.
---
What part of his post was offensive lol

I did too but for sets I wont be buying much of.

√ÄvrorA#22395 Eu Region trading 80 gold quest. I will show it to you at the start you go first plz.
---
Dunno, probably because it costs muny or gold :/
---
When Naxx came out it cost muny too, but then blizz gave some solo adventures for free and now everything should be free.
---
Probably thats the main reason why People cry.
---
People feel like it's basically a slightly upgraded version of what we've been getting for free and now it has to be paid for. The fact that it took so long after the set release is another point of contention because the value of the pack rewards is diminished for anyone who already crafted all the cards from RoS they need.
---
From the perspective of someone who primarily plays for the single player content (and/or arena) you're paying an extra $20 for something that used to be free because packs aren't useful to you and if you only care for constructed then you're paying $20 for $15 worth of packs and probably won't play the mode enough to justufy the extra $5 which isn't a good deal either.

---
Your argument is a tad heavy-handed, but A) I agree despite that and B) so was his.
---
There's definitely something to be said for greed when it comes to packs - only the bundles ever actually give decent value, and those are both infrequent and usually cost a tidy sum, while regular pack prices are practically a ripoff, plain and simple, even when disregarding the gambling nature of them.
---
But adventure/run content? Actual, solid substance with proper design and unique interactions, challenges and replayability? That's worth actual money. It's not a lottery, it's not a loot box, it's _gameplay_. You can look at it, see what it is, and decide if it's worth it to you &amp;mdash; and that's not greedy.
---
Yeah, he was really overconfident
---
I usually defeat big shaman with mech hunter.
---
Mech hunter is only deck i ever could defeat a big shaman. (The game usually lasts long but cybertech chip helps much)
---
Mech hunter worst matchup in my opinion is tempo rogue. Most of the time rogue is very aggressive for mech hunter.
---
5 actually.
---
Yeah cause they care about stuff like this. They don't even fix gamebreaking interactions like entomb on Anubarak, so don't expect them to fix this.
---
r/woooosh
---
Specialist should just have their own card ban list. That way they can brute force/ fine tune diversity without having to wait months for team 5 to catch up with balancing.
---
Had the same thing.  Uninstall and reinstall fixed it.
---
How many turns would it take to be able to win with Mechathun?
---
&gt;&gt; win rate drops to %40
---
If one decks win rate gets below %50, other‚Äôs should get above %50.
---
Try mech hunter, it is the deck which allowed me to get past rank 8. Also it is very fun and has a good potential to control the game as well as aggro
---
You're right, I was comparing minimum value of gold packs to average value of a regular pack. But for the sake of argument, I minimized the value of the gold pack to show that rewards for buying the solo content are more than fair.
---
So ya, if you want, I can change my original argument to say that buying the solo content is *better* than buying 15 packs of RoS in terms of dust
---
It has a RoS theme for me. Not sure why it doesn't for you.
---
Pretty soon its just going to be vr.
---
Uninstall, reinstall.
---
Well, it's really sad. I started drift away from game since witchwood, which odd rogue meta was so terrible that I wanted to puke.
---
And I've seen rise and fall of Pirate Warriot and Jade druids.
---
Personally I don't feel that RoS is bad designed or something like that. It's a good expansion, but...
---
WW destroyed my hearthstone love. I still play, but more due to habit, to fill little time gaps. Maybe it's time to move on.
---
Dude your battery got snapped by thanos
---
Does the truck just not want to pop the secret or what? I don't get it.
---
It revards a golden legendary (the one which lets you play evil decks) also some gold packs. Worth for that golden legendary.
---
Barista and Zola work the same way and they are both neutral
---
107 dust is average though most people say 100 to make it easier
---
keep in mind that would be the average of getting 100 packs and disenchanting everything including epics and legendaries
---
a totally "average" pack is usually 4 commons and 1 rare so much less dust, the 107 number comes from the epics and legendaries
---
lots of people have checked this and that number is consistent
---
Oh shit, I thought yesterday was the 16th didnt realize I played when the clock struck after 12
---
Personally I hope they let us choose what background we want.
---
It's a reference to the Singleplayer Stream Blizzard did the last two days. The camera regularly switched away from intense moments to show another player doing less interesting stuff.
---
Returned to the game after a break of around a year and after climbing up to rank 5 I decided to create a new account and see what the updated new player experience was like.  First game was full on, copied from hsreplay conjurer mage.  Fortunately I had a perfect curve at the start and finished the game with steady shot, but this would be brutal for a brand new player.
---
Wild is far from being a shitshow. Its a different powerlevel, nothing more. Decks are more powerfull simple because they have more cards, not because blizzard prints "op shit". If you go there with a standard deck you will get rekt the same way if you go with a deck full if vanilla creatures to standard you will get rekt. Its basically a different game that just operates with the same game rules, nothing more.
---
In any case, the wild metagame is more balanced right now than the standard metagame right now.

Can you break down the points for each team? Because the math still doesn't add upp.  
---
  
---
According to the new standing list, RegisKillbin and DisguisedToast got 5 quests, 4 bonuses and total of 230 points.  
---
5 quests and 4 bonuses gives a total of 70 points (50+20), leaving 160 points for the final heroic round. However 160 can't be divided by 15 (points per boss).
---
oh thats good to know, here is wishing that the new solo missions from rise of shadows are as good as LoE
---
What happened to the points from Day 1?  Trump had a 30 point lead over Toast from Day 1.
---
Pasting one of my comments:
---
&gt; I've been making this point all day, but if you're buying with cash, it's a pretty much a no-brainer to buy the solo content, assuming you still need RoS packs.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If we're comparing dust value, $20 buys you 15 packs in the store, and $20 for the solo content buys you 12 packs + a golden classic pack (worth a minimum of 300 dust or ~3 packs worth of dust). So for the solo content you're getting equivalent dust to just spending the money on packs along with the pve content and a smaller, golden Whizbang.
---
&gt; If you're buying with gold, it's a much harder sell since that's 28 packs vs 15 packs worth of dust. So if you're f2p, you should probably just spend the gold on packs if you're trying to maximize your collection.

Down voting implies a popularity contest, not the ability to understand the game or contribute to a conversation.  
---
Reddit has become the facebook of a forum community because of people such as yourself who do not understand the concept of upvote and downvote.  Originally it was meant to be for "how well does a response contribute to the discussion at hand" to remove troll reponses etc. from view.  Now it's "I don't like what this person says" or the opposite.  
---
There of course can't be policing of this so it is what it is.  If you choose to engage the popularity concept of whether an argument is valid or not you've already lost said argument imo. 
---
Now if you want to go down this path of "voting must mean I'm right" which is about as stupid as it comes, negative would imply less than zero which is clearly not the case.  25% is 1 in 4. You could start a strawpoll if you like as a topic and ask exactly why those who chose to downvote said topic did so.  Remember ... kids games so some of your options would need to be somewhat insulting such as "I'm a sheep and just followed what everyone else seemed to be doing".
---
As for "popularity" perhaps people don't like the concept of nerfs coming to their favourite cards or classes being mentioned ... who knows.  
---
All I know is there is likely more cowards not replying to a discussion and choosing to downvote than there are those who choose to reply so I at least thank you for you ability to respond and further an argument no matter how off track or incorrect in your assumptions I feel you may have gotten. :)

Do you keep all your cards?
---
Economy hasn't changed much, just slightly more gold for quests and you can only open legends you don't own. Arena is still the way to go for gold income. Other than that, it's just daily's, yes. Current meta is RNG heavy, but it's mostly just card generation. Otherwise it's fairly controlled. Ladder is significantly easier. Best deck is Tempo Rogue, which gets countered by Control Warrior, which in turn gets f-ed by Mech Hunter and Mage.
---
They are definitely not thinking from move 1 (the opening) like that. I could understand if there were many cards on the table, but this is not about strategy (except for time wasting).
---
From their first move they let burning rope to show up, and then they quickly confirm their move. Just then.
---
Probably not.
---
The infinite value tho.

Isn't only chapter 1 free, but chapter 2 is available to buy &amp; play as well?
---
Yes, I also hated getting full expansion set for fixed predetermined price that was lower compared to regular expansions
---
Should be in about 4 and a half hours
---
$20 for, shall we call it 15 packs if you want to count the golden classic pack as 3 (which is questionable since it's classic and doesn't use the pity timer), is a very bad deal for packs that are not a newly-released set. They'd be a bad deal even if it was a newly-released set, since we buy bundles at a pack-per-dollar plus an added bonus. Witchwood was $50 for 70 packs. But the fact that the set is 6 weeks old diminishes their value by a lot. We already have the stuff we wanted most - anything we open now is lower tier on our lists. Blizzard tends to sell old-set pack bundles at 15 for $10. So this is not a "no-brainer."
---
Today at 10 am PST, probably.
---
Unless something changed, only chapter 1 will be free. Chapter 2-5 will be purchasable either individually or as a whole, but for free, only Ch1 is gonna be available.
---
Obviously its a bad example, 
---
But that doesn't discredit my point in any way. 
---
If you wouldn't hold a bad faith position you would see that nearly all tv game shows/quizzes are structured like that. 
---
And if you are telling me they are all idiots then have fun with that position and try publishing your way supperior game show that is so entertaining that it will sweep the market. 
---
(Obviously there is a balance. And you can argue about the specifics. But the fundamental concept of growong price relevance to keep it exiting is absolutely established.)
---
you don't have to play rankeds with your noob friends tho.  Ranked is meant to match people with approximate same skill, let the noobs play with noobs and pros play with pros

I didn't play CS:GO but I really doubt there is anything blocking you from playing with your noob friends on quickplay or whatever the non ranked mode is called there. This way you can play on your account and the enemy team is estimated to average the difference between you and them and even it out on the other side, but when you play smurf you get all noobs running around like a demigod, having fun while completely ruining experience for everyone of the opposite team.
---
Lowering the amount of luck based elements and making each game more similar to each other as a result isn't going to make the game generally any better.
---
Oh yes you‚Äôre right. Only chapter 1 is free
---
Maybe i'm interested in the wrong genre of game, but im not as interested in just winning and climbing a ladder as i am in playing 'fun' decks, not a meme btw. I want to play cool combo decks and be able to switch it up to a control deck without having to dust 80% of my collection to be able to do it, if at all.   
---
I know its possible to reach legend with a basic deck, i've seen it done but that isnt really what im interested in.
---
I've been using it in my Silence priest deck, and it works okay.
---
That's within the next 6 hours, I'm just copy pasting my reply because if they're too lazy to use the search function, I'm too lazy to retype it out and change the time.

So about... 3.5 hours from now?

RARE
---
For me if it was just the pack rewards for $20 it would be a pass. Preorder packs go for $1/pack (plus a variable bonus) and old packs go on sale for less than $1. 
---
But I'm valuing the solo content enough that it becomes a purchase. If I end up not really getting much out of the solo content, I might pass next release but I'm willing to check it out this time.
---
My hand *is* too Cho'd, thanks for noticing.
---
No, it's like playing on a new account.
---
The thing is that dr boom is already quite consistent like he is right now, maybe my suggestion isn't the best way to deal with it but i think it's quite stupid how many games this card just win by itself.
---
Ah k just wanted to let the guy who posted this know an exact time :)
---
I switched servers and still my account remains the same D:
---
Actually in Hogwarts it matters a lot more.
---
As the points you get in Quidditch just get add to your housepoints. Ever point matters.
---
There is one year(dont remember what) where Harrys Team has to win by 120 Points or sth. BEFORE he catches the snitch, to win the house cup.
---
Wait where are you from where your high school football teams were playing no contact? That seems absurd.
---
Zayle is not really a "golden legendary." It's not actually a card in the sense of other Hearthstone cards. It's a picture of a card that means "you have access to 5 unalterable prebuilt decks."
---
In the NFL there‚Äôs the regular season of 16 games where the four teams with the best records in their division plus two wild cards makes it to the playoffs. Then it becomes a BO1. So you can have teams with a 16-0 record can play a 10-6 record and the 10-6 team could win. Even in sports the last part of the season matters way more than the first part.
---
There are a ton of cards that also win games pretty much on their own in any card game. Dr. Boom is not unique in that regard.
---
dr boom doesnt need a nerf imho
---
Yeah but Quidditch is an organized sport with teams and regulations. More akin to high school football teams playing each other than kids running around during gym class. This is also barely the tip of the iceburg when it comes to what children are allowed to do at a wizarding school that they wouldn't be allowed to do at a regular school. Seems silly to get on the case of Quidditch and not the unforgivable curses or love potions being taught in a classroom.
---
I thought blizzard made a clarification that this isn‚Äôt true. The timer statement was saying that there is NO pity mechanic on Golden packs :/
---
It used to be more copies of the same legend as well. 4 patches isn't bad. 7 was
---
I don't think I'll ever really understand the concept of rank 50. I get that in theory it allows newer players to get used to the game before facing good decks, but all this really does is make the ladder grind even longer
---
Trump.and kripp didn't lose
---
wait a minute,i read somewhere that you can only use basic deck if youre climbing from rank 50 to 25,which make sense,so thats not the case?
---
For my first ever rank 50 play on my new acc, I played against a Shaman with all basic cards with Al Akir and Oondasta (I assume they got insanely lucky with the free packs and opened them). And at Rank 46, I queued against Odd Rogue twice in a row. Imagine netdecking when you're new to the game.
---
Nah, day 1 they showed double the scores. It was a mistake. Still it was unfsir as fuck... That last part invalidated all the previous tasks. Amazing.
---
I'm going to do the same I am doing in GoT and lie to myself, saying Krump Team won.
---
Based on the video they showed, it seems that they have mitigated some of these swings with new mechanics such as the multiple hero powers, multiple starting decks, and the tavern mechanics. I‚Äôm hopeful!
---
its only for new player,once you cross rank 20 you cant go back to 26 and so on to separate someone whos legit new to the game from someone who's havent played the game in months so they sank into the lower rank
---
Sent you a friend request.
---
Not in brawl but I had Emeris and \[Jaraxxus\] in hand after playing \[Arch-villian Rafaam\] and I though I would get a 6/30 Jaraxxus but stayed 3/15 and cost me the game but I had to do it for the memes.
---
an even better zola,           rip warrior with 2 bad legendaries
---

---
Good job op, took me about 2 years to hit rank 5
---
I'm f2p but I buy all the adventures because they're fun (with money). I just bought Naxx this week, last one I'm missing.
---
I mean who really cares. You all know what you got yourself into with triads of $80 preorders this really isn't that bad.
---
I dont understand, how does switching server help to practise arena?
---
Whizzbang is competitive and you get a random deck from a group.
---
Well yeah, because it was relevant for the plot.
---
But it also doesn't skip dig day.
---
Nah, I was actually against my friend, he just called me a motherf*cker and conceded instantly :'D
---
Then dust cards you don't need??
---
Depending on your collection and interests this can either be a huge amazing benefit or a letdown.
---
That's a question you can only answer yourself. Play them for the fun, for the experience, not for the cardback or other rewards.
---
Okay, but bear in mind that these are all subjective.
---
First of all, I really hate the mana system. I played Magic for ages (started from Rev 3) and I always despised mana flood and mana screw. One of the biggest things that got me to play HS in the first place is because of that.
---
I'm not a fan of the declaring blockers method of doing things. I find that it makes for many games where you basically pass turns back and forth until someone has an alpha strike. I prefer the declaring attackers method more interesting because it results in my dynamic games.
---
Finally, and I know that this is where I'm going to depart ways with a lot of people, but I like the RNG elements of HS. I find that MtG games often feel very much the same from game to game. RNG prevents games from feeling the same over and over again and it adds a lot of fun to the game. I also strongly dispute the notion that RNG makes the game less skilled. I think that having to think probabalistically actually requires more skill because you have to think in terms of statistical outcomes. 
---
Magic is tied to the physical game meaning that there are things that you simply can't do in Magic that you can do in HS. One of my favorite parts of HS is that discovery and generation effects mean that you get to often get to play with cards that you don't own. I never liked having to watch other people play expensive cards that I couldn't afford knowing that my chance of getting to every mess around with them was low.
---
Finally, the cost. The real world price of trading cards was such that good decks were often prohibitive. I remember dropping $15 on single copies of Wrath of God just to have decent removal. In the history of my playing HS, I've never once had to put more money into an expansion past my initial pack investment. I've always been able to make every deck I want to play from dust. 
---
On a higher level, when people ask me the difference between MtG and HS, I always say that playing MtG feels like going to a classical concert while playing HS feels like going to a house party. There are a lot of ways that the concert is "better" and it's certainly enjoyable, but I think that I have more fun at the house party. To each their own, of course.

Had a guy with a few in his opening hand. Luckily I had patches and zerus. Didn't enjoy his 1/1's and quit turn 4 ü§∑

Conjure mage has like a 30% wr against murloc shaman. Nice
---
I got 2 out on turn 1, fully expecting this.  Instead I was treated to 2 Muklas.
---
Doesn't matter, as that's not the argument in the first place. This was about how Trump and Kripp were screwed over by bad scoring, but you made it out to be yet another post complaining about RNG in the game. If anyone missed the point, it's you.

Play perfectly, lose to bad RNG that the game doesn't even hint is a possibility.
---
My favorite is turn 2 Loatheb. Then turn 3. Then turn 4....
---
That's the reason I don't watch gameshows at all. It always ends with some big fuck-off finale where the person with the lead has twice the points as number two. Yet somehow the guy in deadlast goy one answer, spinned the wheel of shenanigans and swapped points or some shit.
---
Bomb warrior is pretty fun to play against for starters, there's no rng involved there either, i think they learned their lesson /s
---
Well it's a more level playing field. You might lose because you made bad plays but your decks will be about the same power level on average. You won't get blown out for not having a 6000 dust deck
---
I feel like Dr. Boom, Mad Genius could use a nerf however I see mixed feelings about that around. I have a feeling that as long as they add mechs to the next expansion at least it will "nerf" the pool of cards that warrior can get from Delivery Drone and Omega Assembly. How do other people feel about the card as well as warrior right now as a whole? At this point I feel like queuing up is just a game of rock paper scissors.
---
Rly?
---
Have same issue, but re-install actually help me.
---
Its only a shitty deal, if you assume that Blizzard should be spending dev time to give you free PVE content. Think of it more as a DLC/Expansion.
---
It was 15 at the time of the screenshot btw. And I won that game.
---
Sorry for the title gore, the goal was not to make YOU guess the life, but rather to highlight the fact that Hagatha did add a new unexpected challenge to my game...
---
Oh shit, I think that's me.
---
IMO Golden Deathwing is the only golden legendary you need to have. Maybe that and Jaraxxus.
---
It can be, it was half a meme and half serious. If you get the right combo at the start(usually underbelly shaman where you draw a murloc per summon and getting the one that sets the cost to 1) you can just shit out an army with a bunch of bonuses at turn 3/4 and destroy your opponent before they can set anything up
---
At rank 25 you unlock the ranked/casual split in play mode so if you choose casual you go into the normal "sun rank" casual, if you go ranked its as it was before.
---
If pro MTG players come against those 8 year olds they are going to climb VERY quickly. Especially with win streaks and each rank only being 1 Star. If I could get 10 packs for winning 30 games I‚Äôd be all for it.
---
Is this a bug?
---
I just played a game where I was Rogue against Hunter, had a \[\[Waggle Pick\]\] with 1 durability and ready to attack, and \[\[Leeroy Jenkins\]\] in hand for the ol' double-Leeroy combo. Opponent had a \[\[Misdirection\]\] secret in play.
---
I play Leeroy, queue his charge to hit my opponent's face, it triggers Misdirection, Leeroy hits me in the face instead, and then Leeroy died. My weapon did not lose durability. Whaaaaaaat?
---
I once got patches and skycapp'n'cragg! Easy win.

Remember, the real reason that was in the story was not to be realistic but just that the author wanted Fred and George to place a ridiculous bet (Krum catches the snitch and still loses) and win on it.
---
The fact that they win this insane bet and then the guy can't pay them ends up being relevant to the main plot much later.
---
Why is anyone surprised? This is a game that has nothing but Warriors/Rogues running around killing everyone. It's a fucking joke of a game.
---
"Knowledge is power... and I know a lot."
---
Golden Wizzbang FTW
---
Of course you would, which is the problem. They should just give the same number of packs to all players and let the baby queue be for babies. If you are enticing smurfs and highly enfranchised beginners to the baby queue with free packs, what's the point of having it?
---
We didn't do our sabotage because time ran out right before we were set to do the first math problem. You only do sabotages at the *start* of an envelope (for whatever reason), and that sabotage dictated that we had to solve a problem between games. So we had just finished the previous envelope and queued into the first game on the new envelope with like 3 minutes remaining. Toast was racing to finish his first game so that he could do a problem (he wanted the camera time I think, hahaha). 
---
Like many, I didn't totally understand the reasoning for all the rules or agree with their structure, but everybody there was in agreement that, by the rules, we were the correct winners. As soon as the cameras cut, everybody on stage (including Kripp &amp; Trump) were shocked at the results and started mathing it out. It was chaotic for a bit, but we got the production team to double-check and confirm that they had messed it up.
---
I own all the cards that he can put in my deck.  So its useless
---
I just realized it‚Äôs magma backwards.... I‚Äôm an idiot
---
The previous time we‚Äôd gotten this brawl, I had four Edwins on turn one. There was no turn two.
---
For me the worst part is what happened after.. Toast went to his stream with the premise "how do I burn the 5000usd I just won" like.. wtf man.. dont be like that.. :/
---
Rogue is... well, it's too strong right now. Not the most OP deck we've ever seen, but definitely strong. It's also my 2nd favorite class (Paladin being first), so I can't fault you for playing what you enjoy.
---
The real fun of Hearthstone is when you hit that monthly goal and can mess around with other decks without worrying about winning so much. I've been playing Mech Paladin and Big Shaman the last week / 10 days, and while I've made it to R4 twice, I've fallen all the way back to R5 0-stars a couple of times. But I'm having more fun than I would playing the top meta decks, so that's OK.
---
The real question is whether you are planning to try for Legend? Before the ladder changes it was known that in the climb from 20-Legend, Rank 5 was the halfway point. Ladder changes have made a big difference there, but it's still a slog.
---
Personally, even though I've been playing since closed beta (5 1/2 years ago now), I didn't get Legend until late last year. The only other time I tried I burned out around Rank 3 - and started the next month all the way back at Rank 15 (or w/e).

$20 = 2800g, for 12 packs + 1 classic golden pack + 1 legendary is a terrible deal. 
---
People are paying for the single player experience and that's fine.
---
If you unlocked specific cards like old adventures it would be worth it. Those adventure cards were so strong that they still see regular play in wild even with powercreep.
---
your not an og player buddy you downvoted and moved on. read the wall of text i posted below
---
Like how you have people finding no comeback way boring, some feel that having a ridiculous high last round is unfair to leading teams because you need to be really far ahead to win in worst case scenarios from losing teams.
---
But I think it's also partially because they just miscounted during the stream. If they counted right and announced toast and regis initially as the winners while explaining how, there would be less drama about it I think.
---
It's like steve harvey all over again where if he just announced the right winner, there would've been less drama. People will still make comments and threads on how "unfair" the last round is but people would've made lesser issue about it.
---
i agree though as they all knew the rules clear ahead of time and Toast/regis did win by those rules and should be announced as winners.
---
at least try to see where im coming from
---
I think they are free.

You where a zilliax away from getting the three most played boom legendaries. also, 5 legendaries isn't amazing (i assume you had bundle so one free) but it's basically the average amount.

When we say Ooze, we basically mean weapon destruction in general. Warrior has Weapons' Project and that card is largely why it counters Rogue. Many decks run Harrison and Ooze is still the 2nd most popular card in the game.

exactly but lich king is to good. Arfus is not, infact it ws bad at  one point and still is in the average deck. Big priest was not a deck back in my time. Basically I dont want to play big priest i want to play arfus and make him competitve. the 10 the mana scorpion guy who cast a lot of spells randomly looked funny at first but was really broken. blizzard must listen to their ogs. their dropping like flies. How many people do you knoiw that play hearthstone and they are nax players? almost none of them and unfortnately im gone as well. THe remaing ogs play wild. I dont because the power level is way to high got me and to many cards to choose from and i dont have enough cards or money

---
I was obviously joking, but if we're gonna be real about it, that's the whole point of a meta that's not done settling yet. It's obviously a very good deck, but it's not as good as everyone makes it out to be. There are problems with it, it's a bit over tuned for sure, you have to let the meta settle before firing off nerfs.
---
The main problem with the nerfs people are suggesting is that they wants to nerf the class instead of the deck. Some of the ideas are just plain stupid. Much like you don't craft cards, but rather decks, you should nerf decks and not classes. I don't want to see Rogue get the Druid treatment and be completely useless cause it had a good, or even a broken deck for about 5 weeks.
---
The meta always settles around what's played and what's good. It's always reactive to the good decks. This time around it's Rogue, when they nerf Rogue I suspect it'll be Hunter. The meta always chases he best deck, that's how it works.

&gt; Except that's not the case. Jeopardy is the biggest example by far that comeback mechanisms keep people engaged. Wheel of Fortune also adds bigger spaces on the wheel in later rounds. This is proof that comeback mechanisms keep people watching.
---
I'm not saying nobody likes to watch jeopardy games. I'm just saying that there are people out there that do not like it. Of course there are people that like it, just like you said it keeps (a larger part) of the audience watching.
---
Whether or not the tournament is just banter or serious, there is a 20K prize pool and people that watch will have other expectations that are set upon them. It's not crazy that people take this seriously even if blizzard didn't want this to be taken seriously.
---
And I still think it's bad because blizzard can't even count right in something important as announcing the winners. Like I said in antoher comment, there would've been far less ruckus if they just announced Toast/regis as winners in the first place.
---
people are going to whine anyways whatever format/winner, that's what it is to have fans and watcher in these kind of things.

###Vicious Syndicates Nerf Suggestions
---
* **Increase Waggle Pick‚Äôs mana cost by (1), to (5) mana**:  Slowing down Rogue‚Äôs current game plan by a full turn is huge. It can no longer cheat out Dread Corsairs early or drop a Captain Greenskin on curve to enable 14 damage from a single weapon. This change alone would dissuade Rogue players from running the current Raiding Party package, but keep their lackey generating core, which is arguably a more fun and interesting element in the deck. This might push the archetype to a more value-centric direction rather than the burst damage it is capable of doing now, giving more time for the opponent to interact with Rogue‚Äôs game plan. It would remove the ‚ÄúWaggle Pick vs. Ooze‚Äù element that‚Äôs taken over the meta and is required for its currently ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù state. A big swing tech card being extremely popular is usually not fun for either player.
---
* **Nerf Scavenging Hyena to (3) mana**: There‚Äôs another reason we don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary for drastic balance changes to occur, and that‚Äôs Hunter. Gut Valeera‚Äôs tools and we might enter a heavy Hunter meta that could arguably be worse than the current meta we see today. Midrange Hunter‚Äôs matchup spread is particularly scary and the deck could lack reliable counters should Rogue become weaker. At least today, Lackey Rogue does have a reliable counter. Therefore, we would take a serious look at Scavenging Hyena. Nerfing it to 3 mana would reduce Hunter‚Äôs capability of snowballing the early game out of control. You could argue that this is a change that should have already happened during Rastakhan‚Äôs Rumble.
---
* **Nerfy Archivist Elysian's cost to (10) mana**: Finally, we suggest to increase Archivist Elysiana‚Äôs mana cost to 10 mana. This is a quality of life change that‚Äôs also relevant to the current late game meta. The fatigue win condition available to Warrior is too strong in combination with Dr. Boom and chokes out other late game strategies from being viable. Control Warrior mirrors are a miserable affair at the moment and a massive turnoff due to the Elysiana/Brew/Banker degeneracy. Dissuade Warrior players from running Elysiana and they might utilize proactive, more interesting finishers instead. We think that based on Warrior‚Äôs current performance, it‚Äôs unlikely that Team 5 will decide to nerf the Mad Genius, but if they do, the target should be the ‚ÄúHoundmaster Shaw‚Äù effect, giving Rush to mechs.
---
\*Because the score system in quidditch makes more sense than the score system used by Blizzard\*, and when anything from the Harry Potter makes more sense than yours does, you \*KNOW\* you've screwed up.
---
If the meta is still changing this rapidly I don't think we'll need nerfs anytime soon, surprisingly. I think the only thing that needs to be hit is Elysiana to 10 mana so it isn't as unfun with bounce effects.
---
unfortnately the comment you were supposed to see has been downvoted to the bottom so now other people dont get to see it. cheers.

Thank you for replying rather than downvoting me like others have just because I haven't watched a popular tv series.

Do you get a golden Zayle if you purchase each wing with coins or do you have to purchase the full adventure with cash?

nvm

In term of stats, I think Zola has the advantage since she comes down much earlier. Zola vs Barista is basically Aggro vs Midrange.
---
FYI a guy called Tripp is actually a high legend player
---
I meant I have 1 of each (1 harbinger, 1 black knight, 1 scargill)
---
But then you‚Äôd have lost.
---
That was my impression of all the cuts: someone wanting to avoid the spoilers and making ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù camera orders.
---
Holy crud there actually is one
---
JK Rowling has outright said that it‚Äôs not supposed to be a well-designed game so much as a metaphor.
---
Getting goals is supposed to represent consistent hard work.  Catching the snitch is supposed to be chasing a lucky break.  Overall it‚Äôs supposed to represent the human condition; getting ahead in life is mostly catchinng a lucky break, but sometimes hard work and persistence can overcome that.

You're upset because a legendary card from a recent expansion beat basic cards you had. Blizzard is a company and card games have to release new more powerful cards to keep bringing people to the game and to sell packs. You're also upset that a heavy control card beat your aggro deck but that's how card games go. You will always have bad matchups and you have to learn to accept that some games are almost unwinnable if they draw well
---
Wow that actually makes some sense, we barely got to see what it was about
---
By thinking about what EVERYONE enjoys, rather than what just you enjoy. Or be original. Only a few posts I make get a lot of upvotes. I delete a lot of unsuccessful ones. But also, bottom line, put making yourself happy before making others happy. It‚Äôs confusing, but rewarding when you start to figure it out.
---
ok so i just watched the video i spam linked and it looks like a big priest dekc existed. im sorry i just never knew and now im sad i didnt play during that time. upvote so others see
---
It already sucks. As soon as I clicked it I realized this is just literally fucking dungeon run but we have to pay for it. All my hopes of this actually being an adventure with unique strategies and story went out the window the moment I saw the interface.
---
I got glinda and zill. That was fun
---
lol
---
im confused as of why they didnt have 5 seperate stream with 4 team pov and 1 caster pov
---
i have a point but im also a little slow in the head
---
Does it work if you dirty rat a minion out?
---
thanks thats how  i should treat reddit but i dont so im going to stop using it
---
Especially since OP isn't a new player and is stomping lots of actual new players even if he doesn't craft better cards
---
We stalled for like 5 turns , I let him regain 7hp, minions so strong ,they killed anything he played
---
Or at least just lurk and observe interactions for a bit. Reddit is still an amazing tool for information.
---
If the shite rule only made one game historic it's a shite rule
---
There could be a spell that forces your opponent to play a high value minion, which you then remove... or something like that, maybe?

&gt;Well he was 17 in 94 so now he's 42
---
holy shit I'm old.
---
Meh, getting ahead in life is usually purely based on who you know and your connections. Would be more metaphoric if the rich kid with the popular dad always one
---
NICE!
---
I dare say that the new player experience is pretty good
---
Gotta build a strong deck around it. If you have cards like Firefly, you can easily fill your deck up with crap that does you no good.
---
I guess some variants of Token Druid, or Janky Rogues looking for combo enablers.
---
Or something in wild. I know nothing in Wild.
---
Dito, also more than half through my second run and not breaking a sweat, either I got considerably better since KnK or the difficulty is slightly lower on most bosses
---
If you stumble on a fix would you mind reporting back in please and I'll do the same?
---
Servers crashing
---
woosh
---
&gt;!3 Packs.!&lt;
---
Does anyone know if the golden Zayle is a reward for *purchasing*? or a reward from owning all of the wings? because some websites say the latter, and I almost have enough gold to buy them all separately, but I don't know
---
I'm perfectly fine with consistency being broken for the sake of improving one of the animations.
---
That's all I needed to know. The original info worded it as if when you don't have the entire 5 chapters by next week, you won't get the golden copy for free . Now I know I can just wait it out and chill, thanks
---
I see why it took so long to come out, still super buggy. I completed Violet Hold and didn't get credit or reward, although I still got the new deck for beating five bosses. Also had a doppelgangster with permanent +2/+2 that didn't apply to the copies.
---
Ok, lets starf off by saying I play Hearhstone in polish since its my native leanguage so I wont be calling cards by their english name
---
So, I was fighting Gallywix, his hero power is: add a copy of the first card your opponent plays in a turn and give him a coin
---
No the coin doesnt trigger it
---
I had an artifact that each turn turned into a random treasure. As for the treasure I got a 3 mana 4/4: Battlecry deal 4 damage to all enemy minions, deathrattle: shuffle this back into your deck 
---
After a couple of turns i played it and gave Gallywix a copy of it
---
You can see what happened next on the video. Ive been doing this since he was like 32 hp
---
unfortunately the game ended in a draw when he was 6 hp
---
It's missing the 500+ ranked win border on the mage
---
it is much deeper than dungeon run.  and it is custom tailored, since you get to pick your hero power and starting decks.  as someone who wanted a better version of dungeon run, this is exactly that.
---
it sounds like you just bought in too hard for the  hype.
---
Catgirl#21119 80 gold quest
---
How do I get free zale?
---
It really makes you wonder what was going on behind the scenes. Someone would be late in their game about to have a big swing turn and then they'd switch to someone passing their turn 2. The casters would be pleading with them to switch to someone else's screen and they just wouldn't/couldn't. Trump/Kripp were having to call out which treasures they were offered.
---
And it's not like they were sacrificing on presentation to make sure the points were tallied correctly.
---
That‚Äôs still chapter 1
---
the game crashes when you kill a  "bribed" minion with a full hand.  rip my first run.

---
Buy the whole thing with gold or cash, i believe
---
Is that with out without the challenge that says you get 3 packs for beating 5 bosses? I beat 5/8 and got 3 packs. Can I get 3 packs if I get 8/8?
---
I thought that was just golden version
---
Have you tried just buying it through the normal website?
---
Has anyone picked the advice treasure? Wtf does it do? Btw, loving the adventure so far
---
If you think that this is a good value, you‚Äôre allowed to think that. More power to you. I‚Äôm not going to tell you how much you think your own money and time are worth.
---
However, if you really don‚Äôt think that Hearthstone is full of toxic business practices, and that the way they‚Äôre handling the single-player content side of things, this included, is included in that, I have a loot-box coated bridge to sell you. You have to pay for added classes for the single player mode. That‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
You get 3 packs for the first free wing but yeah, no quest.
---
It's because Rogue needs a nerf. Warrior is the obvious choice if you fear facing Rogue, as it's the sole hard-counter.
---
I saw Dog had it and it did 4. Visually, it only did 2 but still did 4.
---
Personally? EA and Activision are what I'd classify as Anti-consumer.
---
&gt;Changed the mana of a card as I drew it
---
Oh that explains why my Messenger Raven costed 7 mana to play. Hmm, on the 7th boss, I draw a card ‚Äúdeal 20 damage randomly split among all enemies‚Äù which I definitely did not draft. Perhaps that was the result of the Wsidomball as well?
---
Easy, just Silence it.
---
Oh. Well, then.
---
I've been playing the game since day one... No fucking Deathwing ! Feelsbabman
---
What did it do?
---
Blizzard AI best AI
---
Gallywix feels awfully self-defeating, to begin with. Reaver + Coins = Mill his entire deck in just a few short turns.
---
Along with getting the new solo adventure, I got myself the starter pack, and after getting Malygos as my free legendary, i got this, all in one pack: [[bloodmage Thalnos]], Golden [[Brawl]], Golden [[mana wraith]] and [[icicle]]
---
The scroll also will not disappear from that spot :/ if you're on the side playing it , it's an easy win as the opponent will not be able to do ANYTHING. The first 2 times I played it I wasnt sure what happend because the person I played with  was still there but just wasnt playing,I didnt realize it till I was on the receiving end.
---
When 9/10 of your friends want to play Junkrat, never switch, never group up and are sitting in low gold then it really doesn't matter what you do. Haven't played overwatch in well over half a year now, but back then Mercy was the healer meta. You can't carry a bunch of golds as mercy, and you can't play tank without healers. So mostly it boiled down to if I could out dps enough of their team. Sometimes you can, sometimes they actually play proper overwatch, just with worse individual skill, and win.

Yup
---
Yeah I walked through the first wing with the ‚Äúcards cost half‚Äù artifact and drafted like 3 copies of Antonidas. It‚Äôs a free wing though, so it might be easier to get people into it.

EricEmperor#1410 [NA] - 80g quest trade
---
How did u get that many government spies in ur deck?
---
I would dust the hogger and keep the Alex, and use the dust from hogger on some classic legendary that you need
---
Definitely not in azeroth.
---
9 out of 10 NA Grand-masters recommend you play warrior in your Hearthstone games.
---
Did you pay for it or can you play stage 2 for free?
---
Your hero will also be golden which is pretty neat
---
You got lucky now shut up nobody cares u cleared it first one theres alreasy 9000 topics
---
This is so horrifying the devs forgot to capitalize Armor in the card's text!
---
just logged into hearthstone about an hour ago and bought the expansion and went through my first run with the mage class and received two golden copies of zayle. 
---
got the first one after i finished my first match in the run, i think? it was a popup message with the card and it said something about it being a reward for participating in the heist. 
---
got the second one at the end of my run in popups along with my cards, i clicked through it pretty fast so i didn't read it but assumed that maybe it was just a reminder of the one i got before, not a second one. 
---
but i checked my collection and now i have two.
---
?????? what
---
My prediction - this will keep happening, as it has been happening.
---
Whether people can predict the decks others will bring or not, people will pick either A - the best deck in the game, or B - the deck that counters the best deck in the game.
---
Why would you bring anything else? You either bring the winning deck, or the counter.
---
I doubt anyone would bring the counter to the counter, because you still lose to the winning deck if someone decides to bring it.
---
Here's what happened:
---
1. Get Megafin
---
2. The Box: "Transforms into a random treasure every turn"
---
3. "Replace every minion in your adventure deck with a chosen minion"
---
4. Murlocs Successfully United.
---
Lot of hate in this thread, but it‚Äôs important to recognize that this is just the first week‚Äôs submissions. Warrior seems to be one of the easiest classes to counter, so I would imagine the next round of submissions will include a lot of mindgaming. Some may expect Hunter or Mage to be popular next week as a response to this. If that‚Äôs the case, what counters those decks?
---
PNC obviously stands to do well this week with his selection of Hunter, but the metagame will constantly be shifting and people will be trying to think one step ahead of the field.
---
And all of that metagaming is not far off from how Conquest played out. You built your lineups based on what you expected the field to bring. Sometimes you got lucky and predicted correctly, sometimes not.
---
Two weeks ago everyone was sure that the Specialist format was going to be dominated through and through by Rogue. Taking this list of deck submissions and acting like 9 Warriors 1 Hunter was a foregone conclusion is pure revisionist history.
---
Combo that I lucked into:
---
- Spells cost health instead of mana
---
- Get a random DK hero power (this one clones your last played card)
---
- upgraded the 8/8 giant to 0 mana randomly at a tavern stop
---
- played Banana Split twice (+2/+2 and summon two copies) via DK hero power
---
There's a treasure that replaces all minions in your deck with a copy of a minion

&gt; JK Rowling has outright said that it‚Äôs not supposed to be a well-designed game
---
well I wish someone would tell that to the dopes galloping around on broomsticks around various college quads
---
Not sure if she's actually said as much, but it seems to me like she began with the premise of "think up a team game where short, awkward, glasses-wearing Harry Potter could be Tom Brady" and worked backward from there. 
---
Hence, start with "hockey on broomstick", then give Potter the best broomstick money can buy
---
... thennnnn also add in "ooooooooh there's a side quest for small agile types like Potter, so he doesn't have to get knocked around by bigger kids"
---
and finally, "zomg, the side quest ends the game and counts as much as 15 goals, LOLOL"
---
I saw on the stream that he could also clear the board for you
---
There is zero chance they paid whatever it cost for one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood to come voice Bartender Bob
---
I had it start me at 3 mana on turn 1 as the boss also started at 3 mana.
---
Light save me because I want to penetrate this HShole
---
This is quite a cool idea, and would certainly make Grandmasters more interesting. I wonder what the Grandmasters themselves would prefer?
---
I bought it once I beat stage 1.
---
Appreciate it.
---
How many posts did you make today? 12? I think there was a new low effort post from you every 20 min or so...
---
picked it too on my hunter run and it gave me a full hand of scavaging hyenas that cost 1 each lol
---
Nomi mage. Fun, somewhat competitive, but most importantly (to me at least) the games are pretty quick.
---
 I usually play general good stuff/strong tribes in dungeon run modes, but getting the Quest bucket early feels really strong! A lot of the passives and treasures synergize well with it, but the draw three and become immune to fatigue passive makes for easy Turn 3-4 Queen Carnassa. It's stupid fun, lol.
---
I did disenchant it
---
&gt;You have to pay for added classes for the new single player mode. 
---
Is the bar so low now that 'having to buy content' is now anti-consumer?
---
Then why are players actually bringing other classes? Did you look at the whole field? Not just the small sample size op has chosen to comment on...
---
WeaselShudder... Like not reallly a competitive deck but if you get your shudder going and start shuffling weasels into your opponents decks it's the best thing in the world... Use normal shudder bounce combo Nzoth and obviously weasels... Maybe mix some beetles in their and you are able to ruin your opponents deck and gain alot of armor
---
I've saved up the gold for the last past month and can afford all the chapters and so far they've been great. I think it's the best solo experience Hearthstone has, entertaining, challenging, fun. 
---
Highly reccomending buying it.

[HSreplay](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/266/resurrect-priest#tab=matchups) says all warrior archetypes are good matchups for resurrect priest. Vicioys syndicate [data reaper live](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/data-reaper-live-beta/) says wall priest has 61.4% winrate against control warrior and 51.3% against bomb warrior.
---
The passive that shuffles 2 copies of each minion you play into your deck counters that. Play your garbage 1 drops and 2 drops, that negates the upside of her Hero Power. One word though: never play Elder Taggawag (sp?) against her or you'll quickly regret it.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Not so much if the warrior knows it's facing a mage. Putting super-colliders back in levels the field a ton
---
Kinda goes hand in hand. If you know hearthstone's balance team is suuuuper inactive/slow, why introduce a format that really needs them to be on the ball?
---
If specialist is to be a slamdunk, hearthstone needs to be balanced regurlarly, a la LoL. But... that becomes confusing to new and old players and yada yada yada. We all know the reasons why.
---
That seems an awful lot of work just to copy a minion that 80% of the time would be an understated minion with a Battlecry that you won't benefit.
---
Just went 8-0 with it. Got the bonus that lets you draw 3 cards each turn and you are immune to fatigue. Loaded my deck with 1 drops and it was insane.
---
Or just encounter the core hound guy on boss number 7... Got destroyed wasn't that funny... Wasn't able to do anything killed me with an 28 attack frothing beserker turn 5
---
most likely a bug, i was able to complete the 8 bosses of first chapter on my first run. Thanks to the rafaam treasure that puts cursed cards in opponent hands.
---
i had that enemy who had the passive that makes him to receive only 3 damage at max, higher hits turns into 3 and... he kept attacking my 6/8 minion with his weapon while the minion then at end of my turn receives 2 hp heal and me too. This kept going until he attacked, with 2 hp, to my 6/8 minion... why ai is suicidal?
---
I figured you did, since with the no duplicate legendaries rule the only way you could open it from a pack is if you disenchanted it once already or had every other legendary (much less likely)
---
you have 3 decks only 5 cards different bo3
---
How do you unlock this passive? Does it only appear in Chapter 2? Never seen it offered yet.
---
Dude wtf that‚Äôs a good pack opening...
---
There are 20 America's players...
---
Post is very misleading.
---
I don't understand...
---
I think there will be a total of 5 different classes, the majority though are Warrior. Rogue and Mage are next, followed by a few hunters and I believe a single priest.
---
Everyone thinks tomorrow will be bad, Monday (here in Japan anyways it will be Monday) will be even worse, where 10 of 12 brought warrior, with 4 warrior mirror matches XD
---
Wider spread hs influencer promotion of the content, and I believe the winners of the event enjoyed some easy made money. 10k to 1k? Is quite a bit.
---
Thought it was easy right up until Gallywix at the end. Got steamrolled. Didn‚Äôt realize at first that coins didn‚Äôt count as the first card I played each turn...
---
The problem is that unlocking all stuff with all 9 classes TWICE is a big quality of life oversight from Blizz, and that is somewhat unexpected, and hopefully patched up. It is somewhat of a turnoff for me from heroic.
---
I only had access to Mage.
---
And the first is ... Zilliax!
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/#sortBy=includedPopularity  
---
By double ... that's actually fucking insane.
---
The more talented PVE players are performing better. While not ideal, the format certainly has mechanics that reward skill, game knowledge, and enough RNG to keep the skill gap from being too huge.
---
Okay, yeah, that definitely seems like a bug.
---
Copies don't act well with the +2/+2 buff. On my first run I gave a Cave Hydra +2/+2 for the rest of the run, and in a later encounter with the Bartender I shuffled 3 copies of that same Hydra into my deck. Those didn't have the buff.

The Wisdomball was great fun. "It seems like your opponent started with a mana advantage. Why don't you start with one too?". "That seemed like a good card \[that just got destroyed by my opponent. How about we reshuffle it into the deck?"

After you complete all the wings.

I got a Quest Hunter deck with the 1 mana discount on minions and the *replace all the minions in your adventure deck with target minions* treasure. Used the treasure to fill the deck with discounted Hunting Mastiffs to easily complete the quest, then replaced the dogs with 0 mana raptors from Queen Carnassa. Full board of 3/2s turn 1 every encounter after I got the synergy running.

So do you have a tier 1 resurrect priest list that beats everything? Pls do share. 
---
All the best performing resurrect priest lists on hsreplay run divine spirit innerfire(currently rated tier 3 by hsreplay). The velen lists have even more bad matchups.

There are a bunch of way more interesting cards than this imo
---
Its alot easier compared to the other runs. I've played 3 normal runs and 2 herioc runs and i still haven't lost. 
---
Some of the cards are super op and it ruins the fun unless you purposely dont take them
---
or they did more of a GoT camera thing. as soon as something remotely interesting happens, switch the scene
---
You also get packs in frozen throne
---
Why? Because sex hahaha?

Nah, cant be T1 when you lose nearly all your matchs vs warrior. High T3, maybe T2.

I always thought it‚Äôs due to the rain.

But now I know it was indeed raining...

I disliked Heist, but I was a fan of the Boomsday puzzles. I'm just tired of Dungeon Runs, even though this one is better than all the rest. I hope Heist serves as a final iteration of the concept and the August expansion has something fresh and new.
