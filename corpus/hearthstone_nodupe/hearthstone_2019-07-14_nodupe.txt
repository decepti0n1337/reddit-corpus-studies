I like the looks of this card a lot for standard. If it summons a Safeguard you have a really annoying wall to bust through, Convincing Infiltrator is sort of a luke-warm board clear, Mosh'ogg Enforcer would be a real pain in the ass also. Pretty bad turn 4 drop, but if you load a deck with annoying taunts I can see this card single-handedly winning a good number of games when paired with divine spirit/inner fire
---
---
---
what a scam :/
---
Holy shit this was painful to read  
---
  
---
You're delusional
---
They clearly nerfed Elise from Epic to Rare
---
But would you reaally put this in instead of something that has some actual sinergy with your deck? This card is just too random and would probably never be impactful in the meta. And that "perfect card situation" you described is basically why anyone would even run this card, and, if you actually run this, looking at the chances for this to actually happen, you kinda deserve to spam wow at your opponent.
---
wew lad, got an example of the kinda treasure or deck choices you make?
---
A lot of the treasures (and buckets) can be deceptive, either looking far stronger than they play out or vice versa.  If you're struggling with the, I'd suggest taking a look at the guides over at icy-veins to get a second opinion of your picks.
---
People have definitely gotten lower. There's some in the 11-12 range.
---
People just hate priest win conditions
---

---
Razakus priest was the best
---
Lol all those those don't deal with 8/8s without some other help and it sounds like you are telling me you can only have a chance if you pull the hero card.
---
Hearthstone adventures uses a different mind set than constructed  or arena. Maybe watching others complete the heist or letting someone coach you will help make better decisions
---
It is extremely close. I watced the Grandmasters for the packs and in every game, turn 5 and 6 mage had and an empty board, and during that turn he filled it with 8-8 minions or 7-8 minions ( with taunt) and froze the enemy board. It's on the same level of BS as the Naga decks if not more. Also, I thought mage's weakness were taunt minions/healing. Well conjurer's calling is all they need you can never get past 4 minions with taunt that have 7-8 in stats.While they removed mind blast and vanish to be consistent with the same class identity that doesn't apply to mage. They should honestly raise the cost of the taunt giant by 1 and it would all be good imho
---
No, and that's the problem.  The only reason to run the card is to pull out some random BS.  It's on average not great at even 0 mana, but the high roll potential just isn't fun at all, and the high rolls are made worse by the potential for it being available the turn of sometimes.  ie pyroblast.
---
That and the flavour is just... not there.

Yes but with the recent patches most classes clearly got the vulnerabilities described in the class identities while mage doesn't.

I think cars draw is often the most or second most important factor in deciding the outcome of close matchup games.  If the decks are relatively equal, generally whoever draws better will win, assuming equal player skill.  Now the skill gap is obviously capable of being pretty wide which is why it’s the other top attribute but I’d actually say great draw order, which is luck, is the best thing to have.
---
Chinese censorship you mean.
---
I'm not buthurt. I just think you should spend your time differently on reddit and on this sub, as you seem to be a toxic element.

Her means medium. As in, one size smaller than big priest.
---

---
It was the first card game I ever got in to and so far none others have kept me as motivated to play as hearthstone. The price I pay to play is reasonable to me and at this point I could never sink another dollar in to hearthstone to get what I want from it. 
---
I mostly play arena these days because the standard meta gets boring after awhile. Although, the last expansion gave me hope and the next expansion is looking even better. Personally I think that odd/even decks and DK’s nearly killed hearthstone. I have hope for it’s future. 
---
Something I never see mentioned but is an important aspect to me is how juicy hearthstone is. It feels good to play. Dropping 2 mountain giants on the board, slamming a burly shovelfist into another minion. They just feel better than other card games I’ve played. I think that’s the real thing that’s kept me hooked.

It can either go on for 20 mins or 10 hours, depending on whether you leave the game running at work.

Can't attack with the Mechwarper. He would've waited one more turn only for it to be removed, or even worse, losing the game. Though, no matter what happened, hunter had lethal anyway.

No no you guys have got it all wrong. Changing her from purple to blue is foreshadowing the first step in defeating the evil at  the end of the third expansion this year. Only Elise and her newfound rainbow magic powers (gained from the power of friendship) will be able to put a stop to Death wing and the League of Evil. Mark my words.
---
Idk if you saw some of my other comments but i'll say it again. In the last 24hours alone i downvoted, reported and blocked MORE THAN A HUNDRED of those shitposts, they keep coming. I keep blocking them as soon as i see one but if i can make this posts(that a lot of ppl are agreeing with btw) so those ppl will block me right away and it'll spare me some job, i'll do it! :) now gtfo if you're not happy with it.
---
This set look so refreshing honestly. I cant wait for hunter to suck again
---
4 mana maximum. The halving rounds down, so 10 becomes 5 which becomes 2.
---
Turns out this doesn't matter because being able to play 10 mana cards on turn 2 is huge.
---
Maybe you should just step away from reddit for a while then. Or at least this sub.
---
No they were both the kangaroo mechs. Traded in both spawned the deathrattles and then only one of the bombs went off.

The journalist obviously never played Hearthstone. Quests were obviously introduced in Blackrock Mountain, where you had to get Sulfuras to unlock Rag's hero power.

Looks crazy for big priest but unlikely to fit in big priest. Its battlecry is insane, but you dont want to ever be pulling this off barnes or shadow essence.
---
The card is insane if you have got deathrattle on curve, or crazy highroll good if you play late game. Either way, i forsee this pushing deathrattle priest up a little.
---
Certain anomalies are great, because you can build your deck around them, but the AI doesn’t.
---
My favorite is all minions get +1/+1 at the end of turn and you just make a token Druid deck. Draft cheap minions and hopefully get some good mana cheats like the left most card costs 2 less.
---
Not good enough I would recommend removing a few more cards and add in some more pogos just in case.
---
Nooooooooooooo. I really dislike the concept of an herocard. Please no more of them
---
False. Overkill only states that it has to be on your turn, not that the overkill minion must be the attacker. Take [[mass hysteria]] for example. If you cast in on own minions, all minions that attacks into your overkill minion will trigger the overkill effect

Rogue card. Plan Z.
---
Save your gold. I typically start saving right after an expansion. The hardest part will be having enough dust to craft those few legendaries you’ll need so just take your time and only craft what’s absolutely important. 
---
You will most likely struggle until after a rotation when you can dust a crap ton of cards and have the gold and materials available to have several competitive decks.
---
I can't wait to find a post where a guy has a Cairne with Reborn
---
Everything you just said has nothing at all to do with why resurrection is a bullshit mechanic.  
---
You just went off on a tangent on what archetype beats what ... not that it's a great state of game play to have "you must play X to beat Y but you'll always lose to Z".
---
Each individual color is extremely well-defined, and combining those colors, especially in Standard, results in fairly predictable kinds of decks and cards.
---
If a deck features black, it'll be in there to most likely enable discard effects, creature kills, or the occasional drain life effect, any deck with Red in it will almost certainly be aggressive leaning or at least just use that color's direct damage effects, green will be there for either big creatures or mana ramp, and so on and so forth.
---
When we extend to Eternal formats, that's where we really start seeing a fair bit of weirdness for both MtG and Hearthstone.
---
That isn't to say the Class system doesn't have its own issues, but if it is meant to actually mean anything, proper definitions as to what players can expect each class can and cannot do is needed.
---
"Played it ages" could be a problem. Are you planning to use the same account?
---
They made changes a few months ago that mean that a genuine new player (i.e. never played on this account) gets a LOT of bonus packs and a guarantee of being matched only against other new players for a while. So unless there's a really strong reason not to, use a new account.

---
At this point I’ve beaten the AI on both levels and have begun climbing ranked while trying to level my classes up to 10
---
Yes, you are bad. My method for beating the whole thing (in heroic as well) was actually with warlock (who many believe to be he worst class for he heist). I play big demons with cost reduction passives. My favorite is robes but if you can’t pull it try to get the anomaly that reduces the cost of all cards in your hand by 1 every turn. Then, you wanna pick the highest cost, biggest demons/other minions you can. Obviously taking some other support along the way. This strategy is surprisingly effective and completely carried me throughout the entire adventure.
---
&gt;That card at 3 goes against all of their past logic about not wanting absurdly costed minions cheated out too early.
---
I find it so weird you blame Conjurer's at 3 for this and not the actual "absurdly costed minion cheated out too early".
---
Thief Rogue has had far more support than Thief Priest. Thief Priest just gets cards that make cards. Rogue has that, and cards that lower the cost of those cards, and Tess replays those cards, and there's a lifesteal weapon that gains durability when you play those cards... Priest has never received any of that.
---
He managed to play it when I got Duskallen Aviana off of the Shaman evolution power. Then he played the card that corrupts all minions on the board next turn so I still won. Thanks blizz AI.
---
There's really not much similarity at all between the Karazhan events and Underlords.  
---
Rather, there's zero similarity between Underlords and chess. Why is it called autochess? They're just units  fighting one another (in real-time) on a board. The board is measured in tiles but that's completely meaningless. Bears more resemblance to a boxing match if anything
---
You also need board space to summon all four bees. It doesn't always happen but occasionally a board does fill up.

I’m pretty sure you can buy blackrock mountain from the battlenet app. For the others you are missing there’s no adventure only card packs which then again can be bought from the battlenet app store (only for money, now way to get those from in game gold)
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
Yeah it’s not a card text, but a tribe so it remains even if you silence it. Like if you are against dk jaina, you silence the elementals and it still will have the lifesteal

---
It‘s nice to have a treasure that‘s on par with a Yeti, but why does it have the downside of clogging your hand with 3 worthless cards? /s
---
*laughs in acolyte*
---
For me the worst part of the game is that is little rewarding for casual players. You have to win 30 games to get a pack, seems way to much for people who can only play one or two hours daily.
---
Each new expansion I open 100 packs and never pass any daily quest. Even so I can't play a lot of decks because their way to expensive. For example I never play shaman because I don't have any legendary. 
---
It feels like a lot of times you play the game for nothing.
---
Ooh, more cards to add to my resurrect prie-
---
Ooh, a hole in my stomach.
---
That's exactly my point. All that matters is that the card deals excess damage (on your turn).

The truth hurts.

While I strongly doubt it's going to die out any time soon, I wouldn't be surprised with MtG Arena took a big bite out of the player base. It occupies a very similar niche, and the physical version already is one of the biggest physical ccgs. 
---
Plus part of how HS got it's original momentum was from being a sort of portable free MtG alternative.
---
Well warrior needed to give these aggro deck in check. These aggro deck can keep the mages in check. So warrior and mage as it is now is a must for a balance meta

Warrior have too much hate. Fatigue shaman is even harder to crack for most deck. That deck can handle deathrattle decks and mech hunter very fine.

It’s okay for temporary cards to be stronger than cards that will be around maybe forever in standard.
---
It still makes sense in the grand scheme of things. Old Gods + Lich King = Excitement. 
---
Random Shaman in a random forest in Gilneas + An entire expansion built around Dr Boom = ZzZzZzzZz
---
The problem is less about innovation, but more about cost of entry.
---
New players getting onto Hearthstone need to spend a lot of time and/or money to get competitive in the game. Also players who take a break rarely return to the game because of a gimped collection.
---
Auto chess games don't have this problem, you are instantly able to compete the moment you start playing and that's a great thing. You will not miss heroes because you don't need to spend money/time to buy them.
---
How can you switch to casual, what mode are you playing?
---
Hero cards were a mistake
---
By jove, you've solved the perplexing conundrum known as hearthstone casual mode!  Well done Holmes!
---
I didn't realize you were in fatigue as well
---
Yes and its combination of everything, natural player base decline for older games, no meaningful changes, a mess of an esports competitive scene, people loosing trust in blizzard, stronger competition. Blizzard has such an massive amount of players and fans that these declines never really but then in serious trouble, they didnt have those numbers at Hots so the game died, same could happen to other games if the decline keeps on going. From public information and leaked ones blizzard as a company is in chaos
---
Just as a heads up, those are revenues, not profits. The two aren’t necessarily correlated.
---
 How about playing something else eh? Preferably single player, so you won't annoy others you toxic turd
---
Odd but true: you could make this a spell and just throw away the body and you’d buff it.
---
You gonna feel even dumber than you do now when I tell you that i'm mostly playing Paladin. I do Warrior when I wanna piss ppl off and it works but OTK and Mech Pala are my thing. 
---
I'm also not "bitching" like you degenerate ants, i'm putting up facts. Problem is that you're all too fucking dumb to understand it. You can watch all the statistics in the world and Mage is more played, has a higher winrate and is picked by pros a lot more often. Cause it's broken af. 
---
But the matches don't take 30 minutes. So it doesn't bother morons like you.
---
Maybe in the next rotation, but abandoning Catrina and Mass Resurrection now will leave Priest with yet another unsupported foray that cannot build a deck.
---
I also find it strange that we keep going back to the same characters. I'm kind of bored of toggwaggle and boom etc

Resurrection would be so much healthier for the game if resurrected minions were deleted from the list of dead minions, and simultaneous multi-resurrection effects never worked more than once on any one item on the list. Using resurrection to make clones is just cheating and violates the fantasy that the mechanic is trying to simulate. If the only minions that are played from a deck are [[Catarina Muerte]] and [[Archmage Vargoth]] and no spells are played that copy cards in hand, deck, or on the board, then there should not be multiple Catarina’s and Vargoths on that side of the board. Being able to bring back dead minions OR make copies of minions is powerful enough. Being able to do both repeatedly is broken.

4/2/6 | At the end of your turn, cast a spell you've cast this turn (targets are random).  
---
Yeah probably. Maybe it's decent in wild with naturalize and the auctioneer synergy. Seems to me like whatever you draw you could use as draw engine or survival tool and the finish the game off with the combo involving the other card.
---
might as well ask to hall of fame the entire class.

Bit hard to draw your deck if you can't use most of your cards.

---
You couldn't have Divine Shield as a passive because whenever one of your minions took damage it would just gain another Divine Shield.
---
Honestly, being able to answer 2/3s on turn two seems pretty good. I don't expect it to snowball much but it doesn't need to have a huge impact to be worth the mana. Just needs to be worth the deck slot
---
Not worth unless you're fetching a game-winning combo piece. Vanilla 3/1 on turn 3 is not where you want to be, even if it's advancing your quest.
---
I hate this card and the archetype that it's meant for.
---
Legit then what do you consider a "mech class" if not a class that got mechs recently and has a good mech deck? Warrior? A class that basically only exists because of Mad Genius? Just hunter then?
---
Except then their hero power would get replaced...
---
Gamers rise up
---
I could see some sort of aggro deck with Salhet's Pride, Sandwasp Queen, Bronze Herald, Crystology, use these guys for early pressure, fill your hand with a ton of small and cheap minions, then throw a Glowstone Technician, and you can go to town.
---
I think it needs more "buff all the creatures in your hand" cards like Glowstone tech to work, so let's see if anything like that appears in the upcoming set. Give me some hand buffs for all the creatures you'll end up holding, and boom - you'll have a game plan.
---
Well, it's at least good to know that the next deck everyone hates will be if Big Priest gets nerfed. Sounds like Quest Mage will step in if Big Priest stops suppressing Control decks.
---
&gt; Legit then what do you consider a "mech class" if not a class that got mechs recently and has a good mech deck? 
---
warrior and hunter
---
It’s a battlecry
---
I dunno, 3/1 2 mana is bad compared to 1/2 1 mana. Those 1/2's are sticky to their mana, whereas 1 health at 2 mana is hard find. It'll find use if theres more synergy for 1 health units
---
Agreed, my first thought was Wrath Pally, as I compared this to Crystology.
---
However, the aggressive deck potential, although looking low with the card pool we have access to, may be empowered by the Legendary and/or the Quest.
---
We just have to wait and see..
---
!remindme in 4 weeks
---
If we're going class by class:
---
Mage, druid and rogue will deal with it easily.
---
Paladin will at worse trade a 1-1 into it, unless you play a 2 mana taunt on the next turn (unlikely).
---
Shaman, hunter and warlock are minion flooders. You'll likely trade it for a 1 drop.
---
Priest's northshire trade against it. Leaving the northshire alive to go face is a horrible idea for many reasons.
---
Warrior's eternium rover will trade against it. If you leave it alive to go face, they'll do the trade themselves after having taken 3-4 damage, but they don't care about this at all.
---
Snowball cards can be OP when they have high health, not high attack.
---
High attack/low health is easy to remove. That's why 2 mana 4-1 and 3 mana 5-1 and the likes have never seen play.
---
And sure you might argue "but they spend a 2 mana hero power to deal with a 1 mana minion!". Sure, but control classes are perfectly fine with that.
---
And when they don't have an answer, again, due to the low health, it never grows into a problem. A 2-1 that becomes a 4-1 on 2 then a 6-1 on 3 isn't a problem. You just remove it. If you never have removal from 1 to 5 and no minion to trade into it then maybe you're playing a bad deck.
---
I don't see this be any problem at all. It's not mana wyrm, it's not secret keeper. The snowball is just "deal some damage to opponent's face", nothing more.
---
Oh ok thank you.
---
I’d put money in you being right.
---
ТНЕ 🅱️АИСIАNТ ОNЕ

&gt;At ranks 14-10 for example, Big Priest is more popular than every other class, and well over two times more popular than every other deck. It just seems to be extremely popular amongst the casual Hearthstone audience. If you ever decide to climb the Wild legend ladder, you will inevitably meet a tale of glorious redemption, a tale of wonder &amp; magic, or a tale of terrible tragedy, at least a few times.
---
I guess we know where all the haters are on the ladder. :)
---
I just wish it had 4 more healt, and maybe overload 2 to compensate.
---
1 health minion that doesn't buff its health? This will never be strong imho.
---
Since many of the last bosses in chapter have hero power synergy with their decks, try to get the Golden Candle too. The candle will replace their and your decks with random legendaries, causing them to loose that synergy. If you maintain board control and efficient trading, you'll steamroll them.
---
It probably is to some degree, but not to the extent that some people think it is. The game has been out for 6 years, its bound to lose players, just like any game would. However, I don't think Team 5 has done a very good job at retaining their playerbase and could absolutely done more over the years to make the game better overall in the long term.
---

Is there ever beast paladin? Given there is several beast in paladin now

I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Karl didn’t make it...

I'm upset that I know exactly why this was linked.
---
I can count the pixels
---
That only works in wild and is hard countered by skulking geist, so don’t worry about it.
---
I didn't get one today, thought maybe I've done them all but it's supposed to be one every day for the entire event right? Didn't reroll it either.
---
According also to TeamRankstar.
---
This guy + bellringer + crystology + call to adventure + prismatic lense + Ashmore + piper = 23 tutored cards (?)
---
Please use this information carefully.
---
Quest reward might be about increase the minions health? Otherwise it's just trash 1 health minions, won't do much.
---
Either +1 health to all minions, or even like "minion's attack become their health"... Still not sure if it'd be that great. Worse than a keleseth effect, and you have to complete the quest first, so you only start playing bigger minions when your opponent has removals and stuff.
---
It is because the whole meta revolves around Big priest and quest mage.
---
I meant you get DS when you summon the minion.
---
Passive: Salhet's When you summon a minion, give it **Divine Shield**
---
dota2 is dying according to playernumbers. yet the prizepool raised for ti9 is above and beyond what we had the years before. for me personally the quality has stagnated too much to warrant the spot at the top. big streamers grow frustrated aswell and look for opportunities to move on without killing their viewerbase. in the end hearthstone slowly showed its true colours, the developers always had mobile and casual players in mind and over time that became clear to people spending the most time on it.
---
I use Hearthstone Top Decks. I don't use it often but it's my favorite.
---
Yeah that would work (and synergize nicely with Reborn)
---
Rogue and Druid have to face tank it tho. If you summon 2 minions turn 2 that one single 2/1 just did 8 damage to your face, which is probably relevant in that kind of deck
---
Looks like she has a beard
---
I've been trying to make Dragon Paladin work since Dragon Consort was released, and this card doesn't do anything for it. The problem with Dragon Paladin is that it's a fair midrange deck. It has a solid curve, decent effect minions, and a couple of potential big endgame bombs to curve up to. And that's not good enough for constructed. It doesn't do anything broken and doesn't have any explosive turns like all of the good decks do. It isn't going to drop 20/20 worth of stats on turn 5 or generate infinite value and never run out of threats or deal more than maximum health in a single turn. It's too fair to win in the current metagame.
---
If the current cards for Dragon Paladin existed back in vanilla Hearthstone it would be the premier midrange deck. But that's not good enough for the game anymore, and a 3/3/1 that draws a couple cards doesn't change that.
---
It does matter because it means, if you draw most of it early, you have to hold 7+ cards in your hand that you cannot throw away and which can provide no defense/stall. It also makes it more likely that you can't draw; imagine a hand with 7 of these pieces and also two other cards, one of which is nourish. Going to be hard to use nourish to draw 3 when you have 7 as-yet-unplayable cards in your hand.
---
I did the same mistake. Thought it'd start from when and increase as the deathrattles eventually resolved one after the other. Nope. Dead.
---
Anyone else read sandwich queen on first time, or its just me?
---
eh its exactly what happened with last expansion, i quit the game after old gods ( or the next expansion after old gods , dont remember the name) then returned just last expansion, disenchanted hall of fame cards to have some dust , build most of cards, had 1 week fun and quit again
---
the game isnt as much fun as it used to be, and this expansion isnt promising. think ill just quit
---
It's not a dick comment to tell OP he should have included the original art his gf copied as a reference,but maybe he girlfriend pretended it was her idea
---
I'm still waiting for Control vs Control format only.
---
Control is the most fun to play as and against.
---
I hate Aggro and most people who play Aggro, hate control, so let them play in a Aggro vs Aggro format.
---
Galvanizers are supposed to come any time before you actually drop mechathun, this diagram just doesn't make that clear.
---
I think u could make it otk combo somehow

Was spectating my friend at high legend. Shoutout to J_Alexander for great HS content!
---
UNIQLO has a lot of good clothes in general. A lot of my stuff is from there. I have a few shirts from this years and last years Blizz collabs too, along with a few other collaborations. Nothings wrong with the shirt in the OP at all, not sure what OPs point is?
---
And i even thought: Turn 3, i could use my "Silence and Destroy all" spell to pretty much win this encounter on the spot... but nope, i was greedy and wanted to wait for turn 5.... 49 damage later i knew i messed up...
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad imo

5/2/6 Beast | Taunt. Battlecry: Gain +1 Attack for each other Beast you have.  
---
I really dislike snowball-y 1 drops. Even at 1 health, this still makes too many games determined by early game draw (especially with hero powers that don't deal damage).
---
my children are hungry :(
---
What snapchat filter is that?
---
Their faces are way to flat compared to that of a real lion.
---
I love the synergies you can pull off in wild with cards that were never really meant to be played together. The fact that you can bring cards together from all expansions, including ones that were never standard at the same time, means you can get away with wacky stuff that just doesn't happen anywhere else.
---
If they nerfed cards because of the strength and synergies you can get in wild it'd ruin so much.
---
You could craft a legendary of your choice right now, and then when you open him non golden keep him then
---
There's other ways to do it than API's. 'No other way' is absolutely incorrect. 
---
It seems you're surmising; as far as I can tell there's no explanation on the website of how he's getting the data.
---
Regardless, it's a non-factor. The data doesn't go back far enough for it to be useful in this case.
---
And there's a bigger chance for Pyroblast being randomly generated than Spiteful Smith being drafted twice.
---
It was funny because I've been watching Kibler post his youtube videos on it and obviously he posts his best battles where he wins and it goes great, so I started thinking this deck is actually good. Then I watched Firebat try it out and he just did terrible with it.
---
+6 attack maybe
---
&gt; Everything is contrived on an internet message board, 
---
This just looks like you don't know what contrived means. We can just move on; it's not important.
---
&gt; This is quite the backpeddle, your original criticism was that the class was bad. 
---
No, I said "all the previous class identities for Paladin have been bad." That doesn't necessarily mean "the class is bad," as in it performs badly on adder. They were bad identities, because they couldn't (or at least didn't) lead to solid deck archetypes. In the same sense, I would say that both Freeze Shaman and Patron Warrior were bad archetypes, because one was too shit and the other was too oppressive, and that's why Blizzard is no longer pushing Freeze Shaman or Patron Warrior in their releases. They're dead archetypes, like everything Paladin has tried to be.
---
&gt; Class that has the most diversity expansion-expansion have short lived archetypes? Who would have thunk? 
---
Right, and I didn't say Paladin hasn't had a diverse set of attempted archetypes. I said previous Paladin identities haven't been good. If anything, the fact there have been so many attempts at creating a Paladin identity supports this, and is the reason I suggested Blizzard might just be throwing random shit at the wall to see what sticks.
---
&gt; Almost all strong tier 1 decks are problematic in some regard 
---
Therefore 'problematic' means nothing? There have been plenty of solid decks that were top tier at some point and yet which went unnerfed for years and which Blizzard continually supported as their cards rotated out. Any time Paladin has been strong it's been considered a problem and the archetype was nerfed or abandoned (and then painfully endured until its cards rotated out, like when Standard came to save us from Mysterious Challenger). Recently they stepped in to move Baku the Mooneater out of Standard a year early, most of all because of its Paladin variant.
---
&gt; It's not that hard to admit you were wrong about a children's card game. 
---
How about you give us a demonstration?
---
&gt;  overpowered OTK 
---
If by that you mean a heavily telegraphed, 3 card combo that needs at least 2 turns to set up and is easily disrupted then ok.

The game mode where all cards are playable in a constructed ladder.
---
The flexibility of choose one cards is what made me love Druid way early on (I started playing around when KnC came out) These days, I like Token Druid, but the choose one cards don't really make much of an impact, aside from Wrath. (Power of the Wild is almost always a +1/+1 buff unless you're really desperate for a body). Based on the new Druid quest it seems like there may be more of an emphasis on this stuff in the next expansion.
---
Shallow and pedantic.
---
I almost exclusively play Priest, and I'd be ok with this.
---
Thing is, 1 health minions usually suck :(
---
Finaly my Dragon Paladin deck will prevail!
---
We've seen 19 TYVM!

I was here
---
Oh no! Your card game art doesn’t have tits and blood anymore!
---
Not with stalladris and the new quest (if it’s viable). There aren’t good targets to make bees worth it over wrath. It’s 3 mana deal 3 and summon a 1/1 at best in the meta and often a shadowbolt.
---
Skarvald #1507, NA. Let's trade!
---
Oh, yes. Nothing helps prove a point like apparently false, sweeping generalizations of everyone else. If you’re interested in having an actual discussion, maybe don’t do that.
---
Ahhh yes it fixed it thank u
---
For real tho pretty disgusting
---
Good point, it would be “played 1 health minions” so as not to infinite loop
---
More like "whenever you play a minion, give it **reborn**"
---
hey, i know the hard work it takes to create this kind of stuff and how random people on the net will freely judge it and i,by no means, didnt mean to offend or anything. It  just kinda seemed to me that it didnt feel like it fit the theme of the Uldum flavor and it kinda seems that it strayed from the Warcrafty fantasy style of environment and characters that existed in the previous years of Hearthstone.
---
OddPaladin
---
True.
---
Also if you didn't know, this also applies to effects that occur when drawn, such as bombs.
---
That would be, almost 2 years from now, Until may, 2021
---
What movie is it
---
I could end it in about that time or less but I play while watching Joe Rogan podcast, so it ends up being 2hr+ game.
---
They have board clear, minions removal of all sizes and silence effects.  
---
They've got more than enough control tools and more so than most classes to easily hold a board with little thought or effort.  
---
What they lack is the win condition and that's on blizzard.  They instead went this resurrection route which is a bad mechanic as I've said.  
---
You seem to want to defend priest when it's resurrection I'm attacking.  
---
I agree priest should have better conditions as it did in the past, that doesn't excuse resurrection now though.
---
Dynomatic has synergy with your mechs
---
Zilliax and Sn1p-Sn4p are Magnetic cards
---
Assembly discovering Magnetic minions is not uncommon and mechs in general just work with the synergy of the deck.
---
First few games i was at 3hr+ because I didn’t close my game on the iPad
---
pl0x
---
You get a cardback if you beat it, a golden common (Bronze Herald) if you beat it in under an hour, and a golden rare (Recurring Villain) if you beat it in under 40 minutes
---
Yes sweeping generalizations like:  
---
&gt;that is very likely to change once the next expansion comes out, as it always does.  
---
Fucking hypocrite.
---
:( that's where the skill comes in.
---
You can do anything if you're skilled enough.
---
Yeah I usually feel bad when I spectate, like I’m intruding on their match so I try to make my presence matter as little as possible to them.
---
I guess your right, but my main point was that other classes didn't reach that step quite yet and some of them are far from it
---
(Hmmmmm intensifies)
---
I only play Wild, so I had no idea. :-D
---
You can be F2P if you don't mind trashing your whole collection to make 1 or 2 decks.
---
If you wanna enjoy playing the game, it's like any other forms of entertainment, you gotta spend a bit to experience the real content.
---
Oh yeah you're right I actually meant to put it in
---
There's a way around it if you convert a deck to wild, then back to standard it should end up as the last standard deck
---
Nice
---
Gurubashi chicken is pretty underrated. It deserved it tho to be fair.
---
On mobile from a reasonable distance away I keep thinking it's a card with Kripp's face pasted on it
---
World record I think was deadly stare on turn one
---
But of course
---
1 hp minions without some deathrattle mechanics are just a bit underwhelming, specially if they have a mechanic that forces them to survive a turn. Rogue, Mage and Druid can kill it just with hero power.
---
*Sounds of crushing walls in the background*
---
I get the whole omega = 10 theme but yeah dealing 10 damage on a 4 cost vanilla statted minion is absurd in a deck that has endless ways to make it to 10 mana
---
Thoughtsteal
---
Druid didn’t have enough ways to trigger the eggs and it does what they’re good at already but do easier, which is flood the board.
---
Hunter did already ? I expected him to be one of the last to reach that. (And crushing walls isn't really a board clear it's more like targeted removal)
---
But it's a testament to how long you've been playing the game.
---
I can't help you if you aren't paying attention or your mind is made up after 15 of 135 cards. Feel bad for you, man.
---
Play Barnes, summon blood of the ancient one
---
Hell yeah, I just opened that baby and I can't stop playing it since. Mostly wild tho cause the priest version is a bit slow in standard, but fun in wild with Druid.
---
Was considering crafting Hemet to play it with priest too in wild, as it seems to be a better option maybe faster.
---
There are just too many decks possible using mecha'thun as a win condition, for every classes, both standard and wild, some obviously stronger than other but never short of a good laugh.
---
Woah. Stop.
---
They just don't know better. My win rate improved a lot after cutting it and there was a time when even vS wrote the deck was better without it.
---
So that's how you climb up the ladder...
---
I'm glad I finally get to afford a decent deck.
---
Dusting Mecha'thun ? 
---
What kind of monster does that ?
---
muster wasn't in standard when this card was
---
Maths also confirms it adds up
---
Woah what site is that??
---
My that claws bite!
---
Looks interesting,  looking forward to giving bgg it a go!
