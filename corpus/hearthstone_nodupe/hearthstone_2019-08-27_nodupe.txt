I used tempo mage and hunter decks on my alt. Lots of good classic/basic staples in those classes, plus I packed Jan’Alai which is a pretty lights out finisher in those ranks.

Big priest isn't actually a super powerful deck, the issue is that when you high roll with it, it is *extremely* powerful. You can potentially get 14/15 stats on the board with coin turn 3, by doing Barnes &gt; Y'shaarj &gt; Y'shaarj. And even without the super high roll, Barnes is an incredibly strong turn 3 or 4 play in that deck.

I'm curious, why does the 2 more mana cost make it "unplayable"? Especially if you haven't drawn the big minions it's used for by then?

Hi curious, why does the 2 more mana cost make it "unplayable"? especially if you haven't drawn the big minions it's used for by then?, I'm dad.
---
Dat Twinspell value!
---
100% difference. in wild delaying a power play by 1 turn has huge implications. for example if against aggro you could just die, and against a similar deck they get their power play off before you and have initiative. i'm almost certain barnes will be cut from most lists.
---
MOM SAID IT WAS MY TURN
---
No? Golden rares cost 800 to make
---
I don't think there is an easy solution though. You can make it so typing one of the words like extra or cost both searches for cards with the word as well as using it as a keyword, the problem is that specially for extra, it would suck searching for extra cards to DE and unintentionally dusting extra arms.
---
In a perfect world you have a better ui similar to what we always had for mana and classes but better and more expansive. I think a good compromise is having commands that will never be confused with card text, like having them in between slashes like so "//extra//" and have somewhere within the collection where it tells you about the commands. It's not as easy or as intuitive, but it works more consistently.
---
That being said you may want to hold onto Dr Boom

The murloc is a bipedal, amphibious, semi-intelligent, aggressive race residing along coastlines, lakeshores, and riverbeds. Murlocs possess bulbous bodies, large mouths lined with rows of sharp fangs, and slime-coated skin. Individuals range in coloration from turquoise to darkish grey, while their heights vary from 3-1/2 feet to 6 feet. Depending on the variety, murlocs may lean towards a closer resemblance to frogs or to fish; the iconic green murloc, for example, has coloration similar to the red-eyed tree frog.
---
Though murlocs are relatively new to the Eastern Kingdoms, it is increasingly believed that they are actually a very ancient race of Azeroth. These creatures have been moving in-land steadily from their oceanic dwelling places and inhabiting more areas of Lordaeron. This move in-land has resulted in them adapting to fresh-water lakes and rivers. Their supposed intelligence has been debated. Some argue that, since their guttural language is impossibly difficult to decipher, they have limited intelligence. However, their use of weaponry and uncanny fighting abilities imply a rather sinister racial intellect.[4] Additionally, D.E.H.T.A. representative King Mrgl-Mrgl discovered, after he had learned their language, that the Winterfin tribe of murlocs in the Borean Tundra of Northrend are as intelligent as any of Azeroth's more "civilized" races.
---
Murlocs tend to dwell in amply-populated coastal settlements, and it is unusual to find individuals wandering too far from their compatriots. Players looking to engage murlocs should be wary of their surroundings; the creatures often lurk out of sight beneath the surface of the water. This tendency, coupled with their large social aggro radius, can often lead to larger pulls.
---
Murlocs organize into small tribes and larger clans. The clans can muster their tribes into a fighting force when needed for invasion. Rarely, clans may join each other to form larger forces.[3]
---
Hunting (i.e. grinding) murlocs can be profitable, given that murloc fins are an essential ingredient in a common broth. Slimy Murloc Scales are often in demand with expert leatherworkers for use in crafting fine armor. Murlocs carry clams consistent with their level, as do most aquatic creatures, which can contain various grades of clam meat and pearls. It is possible that all murlocs use clams as currency, as the Winterfin murlocs do. In addition, certain murlocs command hefty bounties because of their tendencies to terrorize coastal commerce and fishing locations.
---
Packs come with it? Cool. Do you know which kind?
---
Agreed on that score
---
Ben Brode and Shiro one song
---
Holy fuck
---
this is true, people downvoting are such a mystery to me: DO YOU GUYS JUST SIT ON YOUR DUST FOREVER AND NOT MAKE NEW CARDS
---
Fireball is likely the answer given the parameters you just listed. The situation where Shadow Madness is  the perfect card is still a fair bit more complex.
---
Reroll quests that require wins. Getting each class to 10 doesn't take long even when losing.
---
Patches can have a big impact over the meta, DE and waiting at least a week for the meta to resettle a bit would be smarter if you want to have the best deck for the least amount of dust. Maybe the impact of the nerf isn't as much as we thought due to other meta changes and you can recraft it for the same amount of dust. The only reason not to dust it is if you know you want to play the card regardless of winrate.
---
1/1 Zephrys op
---
That’s my plan. I normally only play mage, but since they fucked the only tier one mage deck since Goblins and Gnomes, I’m going to make the shittiest no skill face deck (hunter) and just be cancer like everyone else now.
---
Evidence exists. You're defending a serial creep.

I remember hearing that first time in the game I laughed so hard

it is disgusting really. i've stopped playing this game years but i tend to keep up with changes to see if blizzard finally wakes up or not. i guess they never will because every change they make is more or equally as retarded as the last one. i dont understand how these people get paid top buck to do such a garbage job, it really blows my mind.
---
The more I look at this, the more bothered I get by it.  There's a world of difference between a woman saying "no" to a date and "stop asking me".  If you asking a woman out for a drink and she says "no" and that's it, fine.  Give her a better reason to say "yes" next time.  If she says "no, and stop asking me" stop asking her.
---
And in this case, if the claims made in the article are true, the women he was asking told him to stop asking and he did not.  Which crosses the line.
---
I disenchanted my golden one and recrafted it normal. Also had 2 golden conjurers callings..so pretty awesome.
---
Secret Mage is already the best deck in Wild, and Zilliax or Convincing Infiltrator won't stop them from throwing tons of burn in their face. The rest of the aggro decks will just start running silence.
---
Giving aggro decks one more turn is huge. Big Priest will adapt, but the new meta has already hurt the deck a ton and this nerf weakens it even more.
---
that boom costing 7 was also a mix-up
---
Hsreplay disagrees
---
https://hsreplay.net/meta/
---
It may have a good winrate right now, but it's basically a coin flip deck. A board clear basically ends it. The play rate is low. If it goes up it will be easy to tech against. It's just one of those decks that  can't sustain a high win rate and a high play rate at the same time
---
Every 62IQ warrior player dusting Dr Boom because they have to wait 2 turns now like he's unplayable makes me lol
---
Really inconsistent. Pretty much a highroll of draw lens by 4 or lose to control
---
It doesn't have a high play rate. If it picks up it will be easy to counter and the win rate will plummet.
---
I wouldn’t make 2, because drawing both of them kinda sucks when one pulls the other one out.
---
I wouldn’t craft any, but you can try it with just 1, and see how you like it.
---
Let it cost 2 Mana and add the effect to summon 7x 20/20 minions otherwise it seems pretty weak tho.
---
if i think about it make it 4x 20/20
---
Huh... that makes sense I didn’t think of that. Also explains why I don’t see that deck.
---
&gt; can sometimes win against
---
That's the problem.
---
What do you mean
---
I just wish I'm never seeing big priest again, don't care for other OP decks, just never liked the concept and highroll of that deck
---
well hell
---
Wow, that's insane. I was joking to a friend who still plays last patch bout how Blizzard tries something then says "Well we tried x, but time to dumpster it" but this is another level....
---
yes, but then silence would probably be fine. Unless you explicitly need the extra 3 damage from shadow madness.
---
I think his point is that statistically speaking, it includes you.
---
By turn 7, you’ve drawn too many cards.  Some of the big minions are guaranteed in your hand. It’s just too late to be useful.
---
What did I do wrong? Seriously asking. I made a post just like this and it got downvoted...
---
Anyways. It is fun getting so much dust ;) I had a golden copy as well as 7 to disenchant.
---
Yes finally the bug where it tells me that the last nerfs exist every time I log into the game is gone

Does the mana crystal become golden at least?

NO ONE WILL PLAY CONTROL WARRIOR ANYMORE AND CONTROL WARRIOR WILL NOT CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE LADDER FOR MANY MONTHS TO COME. AHAHAH WELL MEME'D MY FRIEND! HAVE SOME REDDIT GOLD. WELL, TIME TO GO BACK TO MY RANK 20 GAMES GUYS. BYE
---
But Zephrys should know that more expensive cards are usually better, so it should offer Poly most of the time if you have 4 mana, unless it gives a special advantage to the opponent.
---
They did
---
Sorry I'm late, I charged through as fast as I could but some idiot in a dumb shirt stopped me and I was strangely compelled to fight him.
---
&gt;gg dude, but you missed lethal about 4 times,
---
Why the hell would he ice lance his own giant ?
---
I kept getting stuck at rank 1 trying mage and then control warrior and going up to four stars then down to zero. Then the patch hit so I decided to run trusty old bomb hunter from last expansion and went 6-0 from zero stars to legend. And the final boss conceded turn 2 after a Mecharoo -&gt; Upgraded Framebot lol. Never had an early conceded on final boss and I’ve been playing since Hearthstone came out.
---
That's... not what irony is.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
He’s always been a key piece of tempo rogue and being a classic card you’ll be able to use him forever. Given the nerfs today it’s possible we’re about to shift into a more aggressive meta so tempo rogue will probably be a good deck. 
---
Bottom line if you enjoy tempo rogue and want to improve the deck he’s worth crafting

You are why I opened my packs tonight! I have a new dark pharaoh! Thank you!

I got the best card in the game... the man, the myth, the legend! lore walker Cho.
---
I did that for the meme, and I won too. :)
---
What?
---
Aggressive decks tend to do better against something like that
---
It's not a good deck. It has something like a 40% win rate
---
Dust them, see them in decks to remove them etc.
---
[WOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!](https://media.giphy.com/media/12QBgS1xGmP0rK/giphy.gif)
---
That surely makes more sense. I don't know why I didn't think about that.
---
I’m pretty sure I wrote most of that and don’t really remember what it says to be honest. We tried to be really strict about capturing the essence of what each class did in the MMO within the TCG - it was a real challenge but it was also a lot of fun. I think the gameplay would have been smoother if we had taken more liberties in some cases - Hearthstone does weapons way better, for instance, and we considered a similar durability system but felt losing your weapon after using it a few times was jarring from the perspective of an MMO player, and being true to that was a major directive of ours.
---
öhhm „a lot“ ? no way dude 
---
So, im priest only player since beta. I played every single priest deck. ExtraArms wasn’t played before the  buff and no one will play it after the nerf.
---
Instead of coin turn 4 and turn 5, its now coin turn 5 and turn 6
---
What about the phaoris paladin deck? It can generate if it highrolls (drawing lenses and not phaoris) a board full of 5+ cost minions while then you can play rebuke or time out.
---
Not really an interactive deck
---
Recruiter is very much playable. He was seen is some raza priest decks since you could HP and summon a squire 5 times per turn.
---
Yeah, Mountain Giant has to be on the shortlist. That and Leeroy and MCT.
---
If you HoF Northshire Cleric, Priest basically doesn’t have any identity outside of spirit/inner fire. Get rid of divine spirit and start pushing heal synergies more
---
Ye, it was a Finley
---
Hearthpwn says that 38% of the priest decks made in the 30 days (or whatever number it is) had extra arms.
---
Sorry, I'm keeping Wild in mind too. I play it more often.
---
You are playing wild
---
Yogg says “cast”, while Tess says “replay”. I guess they work differently is all
---
Good idea but ill just stick to my european account for now,  its been active since 2015 so i gotz all the good stuff for both wild and standard
---
Is there a different class that can do mecha'thun better? If it's more viable in wild that's fine too. 
---
Basically I want to play whatever the best mecha'thun deck is... Hah
---
That's why it's shenanigans.
---
I mostly watch HS, but did Priest realy needed a nerf? Extra Arms was good, but Priest dont have that much good stuff and they just lost Mind Blast.
---
That is how blizzard gets you to spend more money, muhahahaha
---
That would be fun. No fun allowed!
---
Not mindless, the goal was to make that mage deck unplayable and they succeeded (and we cheer). I'd rather play 50 games vs warriors that turn 7 dr boom vs 5 games where the mage turn 5 luna'd. I have decks that can beat those warriors but mage highroll was unbeatable.
---
Take a break from the game until the meta settles
---
It will happen one in every 20 games. Move on for the next one instead of complaining. You don't even lose stars for losing, what's the big deal?
---
WTF numbers are you looking at?
---
it's not broken but it's mindnumbingly boring to play against and watch in competitive. Two things arguably worse than being broken
---
There was another voidlord in hand tho
---
You don't need undatakah in quest paladin. Undatakah is totally unneeded in the deck, as you already destroy control decks. Just craft Kangor's and play the deck if it seems fine to you. It is a decent deck and it will climb. Combo priest was just nerfed, so it might not be a good deck anymore. Personally I find the deck fun, as it has many hard decisions. If it is any good anymore I do not know.
---
Apparently Dr Boom was untouched.

Sure. You just need 2 AoEs for 2 waves of murlocs, dodge whatever Zephrys has to offer and an AoE for Nomi.
---
This is clearly easily done.
---
Sarcasm apart, while some classes will be able to do that on a regular basis (a few will not), Tides the scale is just terrible game design and comparable to 5 mana Luna's Pocket Galaxy. These cards can only be terrible or broken.
---
This meme is worse than his awful music
---
Karma for playing that brainless deck.
---
What ranks are considered as experienced ranks?
---
0 mama raza hero power died but 0 mana spells triggering flamewanker is fine hmmmm
---
To add onto this, they probably don't want to maintain wild either. As the game goes on, it's just going to get more and more difficult to maintain as more cards get added to the pool.
---
You also run into the problem that you want to preserve the cards as they once were, but doing so will cause obvious power imbalances.
---
Ideally, there should be 3 game modes, standard, wild but is balanced similarly to standard, and a legacy mode which keeps the cards untouched as they were in standard. Instead, we have a legacy mode which very occasionally gets balance changes.
---
If Blizzard somehow removed all T1 decks, then the T2 decks would become T1 decks because that's how the mafia works.
---
Makes no sense. The "featured cards" feature is hidden in the collection, whilst all nerfs are displayed FIRST THING when you log in. How does that make sense in the slightest?
---
Besides, I wouldn't want shitty, nerfed cards to be called "featured".
---
r/blessedimages
---
I was also playing quest hunter, went from ~ rank 150 legend to 700 lol. It was a lot of fun tho, so I didn't really regret it.
---
 
---
The decklist is basically the default one with a few tweakings. Hope everything goes well during your climbing! :D
---
The solution is to make the dust economy less punishing, so that if a nerf kills a deck, you can readily make another deck.  None of the nerfed decks look like they dropped by much on hsreplay so far (T1, T2, and T2), but imagine if Highlander Mage were unplayable now.  Lmao, that's multiple expansions' worth of spare dust effectively gone.
---
But doesn't this just bring a TEAR to your eye though? 
---
I'll let myself out...
---
Would be a miracle. Haven’t lost against this deck  so far. Dunno what’s the win conditions are with that
---
no i didn't end turns with any unspent mana
---
Wow, TIL. That's actually useful.
---
A man of tempo I see
---
Still an unfun combo that is not interactive. But at least it isn't a very popular deck
---
The rank where you actually make money from playing the game.
---
Ah ok
---
I think it will be a meme deck I have only seen here in wild ungoro quest Paladins that being said still could be fun not really good. 
---
You could still craft a deck and stay below rank 15 in wild Most people are playing meme decks or not meta decks at 15 and below from my experience. You won't face a lot of meta decks there.
---
It's wild... anything still possible.
---
Congrats! want some help with that quest? Add me cottees#11212

Too late, Blizzard's already printing this.

It’s currently random, but will be fixed in the next major patch (likely the one in October) -

---
Why I can't get out of rank 18. I'm playing Highlander priest (Thjis') deck. I get rekt by aggro decks.
---
The next major patch is in October (there’s a minor patch in a couple of weeks, but it’s possible it’s fixed there).
---
Today’s update wasn’t a patch.
---
Ah yes good ol exodia mage. I wish blizzard would print some standard support for it though,I had antonidas as my first ever legendary and I kept him ever since hoping to one day be able to play exodia mage.
---
I agree it is Prismatic Lens that makes Tip the Scales playable and mana cheating cards are an issue ... but I maintain the design of Tip the Scales is problematic, due to its "bad or broken" nature.
---
The stealth nerf that didn’t reward dust
---
Always played hunter cus i tought he looked cool
---
too confusing for new players, should reduce to 1 deckslot instead
---
Ah the RNG wins.
---
I concede as well when I'm in dumpster legend and face a rank one player. Most of the player are very very happy, because it's stressful as hell, when you never reached legend and you just need one or two games to do it finally.
---
Some of the opponents are disappointed though, because they don't want to get a free win. They want to earn it. But that's the minority tbh.
---
I'm always happy, if my opponent concedes, even though I hit legend already a few times.
---
Do not! I like beating warriors, and there are so few right now...
---
ya, since blizzard does the "lazy" (but kinda understandable) mana only nerfs, oh well.
---
&gt;has taught us all
---
lmao speak for yourself.
---
Here we go... let the cry for druid nerfs begin! Lol
---
The design of the card is awesome IMO so huge kudos to the dev team is definitely in order. 2 Mana is a bit too cheap for what it does tho.

I didn't think Odd Pally is still a thing after Level Up got nerfed, I got in rank 5 for the first time with that deck, glad you told me &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I think that, should the next expansion introduce some supporting cards, this will indeed be very good. I've had some good times with it to date - getting four golems on the board a turn puts on some serious pressure. There's just some missing piece that's holding it back from being the next great thing for Warrior once Boom rotates out (b/c even at 9 mana, he's still supremely relevant).

It loses the druid massive amounts of tempo every time they float mana. Early game decks can easily dominate and flood thw board because druid juat doesnt have access to board clears. Thats the weakness of the druid class. They have swipe and single target spells. Doesnt much help if you burn them down and the ots still hard for druid to recover from the early tempo loss to come back into the game most of the time.
---
I really don’t care if it’s nerfed or not. I just do not understand why on earth such a powerful ability is free. If you have an actual explaination I’d love to hear it
---
Pay attention to the duplicates the opponent plays and how quickly they draw through their deck. If there's a chance Zephrys is in their deck, play around it.
---
But... Shaman, too has an easy quest? And unlike druid's it wont force you to play inefficiently?
---
Because it takes 4 turns of doing nothing. Unlike the shaman quest which let's u play tempo and advance the quest. Play the deck and you'll understand its strengths and weaknesses.

&gt;and yet at rank 3-4 68% of my games are murloc paladin.

I mean they have other cards too, but yes Boom. But boom is still going to be great for late game.
---
I don't make any money from it :) simply spreading awareness since you can only join from a beta link.
---
Control warrior won't work without dr boom. You won't have a win condition. You might be able to beat aggro by outvaluing them but almost any other deck that has value will crush you since your deck is just removal. Boom is one of your few proactive cards.
---
Oh I definitely suck. Pogo hopper is still a troll card though.
---
Yeah me having to minimize it and miss an entire turn is what made me post this lol
---
This is exactly the inspiration for this game mode! I think it's a fascinating idea.
---
[removed]
---
I highly doubt that since it's a repost of every other Ad for this. If you were just spreading awareness you would of made your own post telling us about the game, even though it would still be highly inappropriate to post it on the HS reddit. Although it was funny to see you come here after posting it on r/beermoney
---
Dust all copies of all of them. There is no downside here. 
---
I think the question is better framed: are any of the nerfed cards worth (re)crafting or is there something more valuable I should craft? 
---
I would not craft anything just yet, as the meta isn’t settled. I’d make sure I have ziliax. If you must spend dust now, unless your classic collection is near full, there are often good classic crafts like leeroy and thalnos.
---
It's your fault for being greedy and that's just fine
---
If you want the best winrate, Id say something like odd buff paladin is the way to go, that hero power is so strong alone youll win matches with it, and the top end of sunsorrow isnt so bad, I dont think the deck would possibly get past 10 though
---
Blizzard is a centralised company, they only release information that they want you to know. A new decentralised TCG released around a month ago called Gods Unchained. It's the complete opposite of Hearthstone as in you can trade all your cards for $ or other cards, all cards and rarities are displayed and you can see the owner of the most/least cards at any time also the value they're trading for. Early 2020 also a $500,000 usd tournament starting. If you would like to join I'll put an invite link you need to sign up and play, theres also a very active discord :) [https://godsunchained.com?beta-key=rrLJspGpuW](https://godsunchained.com?beta-key=rrLJspGpuW)
---
Uuugh pshh nah dude.
---
Maexxna is a safe DE. There is a common in the new set that is basically the same card.
---
I'm surprised at Surrender to Madness. Going down to 8 mana crystals next turn isn't the worst thing, is it?
---
You dont lose any dust is what he is saying, you dust for 1600, you spend 1600, then recraft him later, thats still a loss of 1600, but if you disenchant for only 400, then recraft, thats a loss of 2800 dust.
---
Mate, if I was going to earn money for a referral link I wouldn't be referring a game in beta. It shits on Hearthstone in every way, shape and form. I'm still unable to find a player on the discord who thinks hearthstone has better integrity or future potential as Gods Unchained. :)
---
I only buy the bundles, dont pre order
---
Done and thx!
---
Just plain wrong. Control warlock was a very popular deck until recently, and it was commonly running cards like Sac pact and Demonic project.

Holy shit

don’t keep the quest all the time, i only keep it vs shaman, sometimes hunter, warrior. most of the time i mulligan the quest - it heavily depends on the other boths (or three with coin) cards 
---
cause it’s not your wincon or rly necessary, you can easily complete the quest on turn 8 when drawn, it doesn’t matter. 
---
and i ALWAYS mulligan it when i don’t have the coin
---
Holy nova over flamestrike?
---
Dust it and have some self control for a few days till you make up your mind. Just don’t use the dust and treat it as 0.
---
anti tempoing yourself that hard is really bad, also these stats don't include Tortollan Pilgrim casts
---
He was good before, but most people/streamers didn't experiment with him until after the nerfs. It's a rare case of a card "discovered" to be good by the community way after release.
---
I kept lightwell because I just really like the golden animation.
---
Elekk can be very good as others stated. Another suggestion would be [[Arch-Villain Rafaam]]. Helps getting more value from your hero power after quest completion.
---
I don't have an exact list for you (it's still early) but I would keep an eye on APXvoid. He will be constantly testing mage decks and usually will end up with one of the best lists.

I largely agree, but I do understand why SOME of these decks are particularly frustrating to play against. Control Warrior was seen as especially oppressive because of its incredible removal toolset paired with Dr. Boom, which is essentially a swiss army knife of removal and value. Murloc Paladin's ability to create an unanswerable board by turn 4/ 5 against most classes is what frustrates people since it is so draw dependant and can completely remove the opposing player's sense of agency. My point is that no matter how "unfair" these decks may seem it is never right to go after someone for playing them. Hell, something like Pogo Rogue can have some insane starts, but because the deck overall has a low winrate (and hence a low representation on ladder) people don't seem to have an issue with it or the people that play it because "unfairness" is perceived as acceptable when it is encountered sparingly.
---
that's what you get for playing warrior luv 😍
---
Shaman Quest turned out to be a lot worse than most of us thought. Not dumpster tier, but just not very good either.
---
I know it's hard to believe but...
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/pogo-rogue-is-stupid/8964
---
According to at least the raw data, Quest Shaman isn't good against Hunter either. In fact, adding a Archivist probably makes that match-up even worse.
---
The counter to roaring torch is killing them before they have time to play the sub-par forgotten torch and then wait to draw the roaring torch. Or control the board enough so the 6 damage doesn't kill you. I don't think it's an amazing card. Wrapped golem is fantastic as are Reno and zephrys in a Highlander deck.
---
RNG can get you sometimes of course as it can in any game but you have to be incredibly unlucky to meet someone with a great deck if you've already lost the first game or two.
---
As for paying 150 - it's not about the payout this game but on average. If you're good at arena it's a goldmine even if occasionally you go 0-3 through pure RNG.
---
It's a keep in your opening hand card in a slow quest rez priest deck. It looks like a lot of fun, but I wouldn't count on winning a whole lot with it.
---
my pp hard now
---
thanks op
---
And you're pathetic. Have a nice day, paladin.
---
Y me too against the inkeeper.
---
which list were you using?
---
This was a no-win scenario for the dev team.  They've gotten so much shit by nuking cards from orbit in the past, so if they can keep a card playable (dr boom), while evening out the meta, I see that as a win.
---
Huh?  Wild seems very diverse and fun right now.  Literally the best expansion for it was just released...
---
OP! Why hasn't Blizzard nerfed this yet?!
---
Than be happy, 7 mana dr.boom and 5 mana LPG for you
---
 Mcc#1153 on NA looking for trade. I show you go.
---
What is it like to have such a big brain
---
Errr not to be rude but if you think hitting 5,500+ legend is an amazing competitive feat - you’re gravely mistaken.
---
Nothing like pissbaby moaning and using terms like 'toxic' and 'cancerous' to give your inane claims legitimacy. Is that what's happening? Did you win the internet yet?
---
Can confirm, Puzzle Box into Myra’s Unstable Element has lost me exactly two games, and is part of why I stopped trying to “git gud” with such an RNG-based win con/emergency button
---
Generally, having a stat spread like this means two things. The first is, as you said, Aggro decks want the games to end quicker, and games where more cards are drawn are games that go on longer, and are therefore more likely to be losses. The game where, say, your Aggro Warrior deck hit the perfect mulligan and smashed that Quest Druid before his Turn 6, only about a third of your deck got drawn; the game where a Control Warrior got you to Fatigue because you didn't want to concede, every card in your deck got drawn. So out of those 40 draws across two games, 10 happened in a game where you won, and 30 happened in a game that you lost. Statistically, that means drawing cards = bad 75% of the time, so of course every card in your deck is going to have a bad drawn winrate: in order to draw them, you had to draw them. 
---
The other possible factor is that your deck's power is not coming from individual strong cards, but from the power of hitting certain card combos or hitting specific cards in your mulligan. This seems to be the more likely case for Token Druid, as your victories don't usually come from overwhelming people early, they come from getting that one good board to stick and buffing it like crazy.
---
Ive missed the last 3 expansions (including the most recent one) how many rares/epics are must haves out of the sets? Trying to decide what packs i should buy in addition to the latest xpac to get my collection caught back up to be able to compete (highest rank i ever achieved was 3)
---
Whats your decklist that you have an acolyte hows that working for you?
---
All they needed to do was not (1) not make their resources endless, or (2) take away their ability to armor up so that playing Dr. Boom has an actual weakness, like any other Hero card.
---
People have proposed removing the mech tag from Omega Devastator, lowering the rush impact to non-generated cards.  
---
These are all actual tweaks to the gameplay that doesn't murder the card but makes it actually fair.  
---
Simply nerfing the card by 2 Mana doesn't change the fact that they still have endless removal, received FIVE incredible cards in the 2/2 taunt, restless mummy, oblivitron, plague of wrath, and tomb warden, all of which make the deck even more ridiculous.
---
Do not dust Extra, or hit the "Disenchant All" button. It's a trap that will cost you a ton of dusts on a long run.
---
There is usually ~8 cards that are nerfed every 4 months, and getting full dusts whenever it happens is a significant gain. You will often find yourself with 10+ commons, and 5+ rares of one type. 
---
Once that expansion rotates to wild, it's generally safe to disenchant all your extra, since those cards are rarely nerfed.  However, if you do need dusts, just try to aim for the worst cards of the set first (the one that probably won't ever get hit by a nerf).
---
The chances of opening a legendary card are one in twenty, which is comparable to what you can expect from opening Mythic rares in MtG and Secret rares in the Yugioh TCG on a per dollar basis.
---
Granted, unless you opened two different kinds of packs, you should have opened at least two legendary cards given the pity timer.
---
You'd rather play a game where you lose that takes more time rather than get on with it and go to another game?
---
&gt; But if we assume that cards are distributed normally 
---
That's probably not a fair assumption. HS replay says there's 329 spells in standard, but under 140 are in more than 1% of decks. That means huge swathes of cards are below standards power level. One tail is longer than the other. Note puzzle box has a higher winrate when played before turn 10 showing the need to cheat it out with sand witch or pilgrim.
---
Damn what were you playing?
---
Yeah, but the name is top tier
---
What about the other 40 packs? If you got just 1 more then it’s in line with Blizzard’s published legendary drop rate. 
---
You might regret buying them, but that doesn’t mean you received any less than you should have.
---
You don’t want to avoid 2 drops for life tap except maybe against control. But you want to have 2 drops that put you on the board against aggro. Thalnos lets you draw for clears and complete quests so I don’t know it would take some trial and error.
---
"Good old rock, nothing beats that." -Bart Simpson
---
No argument from me on that count.
---
What's the correlation between "in 1% of decks" and "will be pulled out equally as often by random effects"?
---
Yeah then it's still in the game I guess. Bummer.
---
They should categorize all deathrattles into sticky and nonsticky
---
Haha yeah I know that’s why this deck is absurd. You start by playing one class and at the end of the game you are playing another.
---
It feels like playing a Renounce Darkness deck!
---
Would show up in the bar on the side.
---
Wild Mecha’thun Warlock is a viable deck that can be played to Legend.
---
I was wondering what to do with all my extra dust from the nerfs, and this is right up my alley. Only had time to play two games with it, but it's been a blast so far! Thanks for the recommendation!

Dekkster made a video on a deck that uses it with Velen and Malygos just the other day on YouTube. https://youtu.be/hXjWoxhxyVI 
---
It's expensive though.
---
It was core to perhaps the best deck in the format at one point but currently sees no play.  Impossible to project how it’ll do in future expansions.
---
I think that happened because it's marginally better to wound enemy minions with the puzzle box, so that further spells from the puzzle box have a chance to hit enemy minions.  If you blow up the enemy board, then any further kill spells are going to target your own minions.
---
Odd rogue.
---
Thanks
---
It's not good, but as a new player you should be opening different Packs anyway.
---
I hope he hasn't ODd on that high quality coke
---
Leeroy and zephyrs are a must have for everyone, and most of those epics are from the classic set, meaning that a lot of people already have it.
---
Or I just assume OP is thick as a concrete margarita and move on. If you assume people are stupid you’re rarely disappointed.
---
Did you even look at the image?
---
That's incorrect. If you have premium you can filter on post-patch data. OP is correct.
---
Been playing pre naxx and only have warlock as golden. Unlocked mage like a month ago and probably shaman this week
---
so true. and also why hide the user alias? the chat was fact. even if it was fake (news) who would ever care.
---
Screenshot, not cropped please.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
You don't say. People kept saying that 7 mana Galaxy will still see play, cause it wasn't played at all due to no one knowing it's true power and just not bothered to try out and not because of significant cost, compared to 5 mana version.
---
Fine, I’ll humor you. Why is OP conflating wild and the Knights of the Frozen Throne adventure? Because the set rotated? Hilarious.
---
It's a little bit of each of those, plus the fact that counterspell, specifically, is better late game (since it is more likely to hit a big spell), plus the fact that it is never bad, and almost never useless, with no targeting problems.
---
Yep, times were good back then, cold light oracle actually did it’s OG job, which was drawing more murlocks. Now that I think about it, this makes fishflinger (you and opponent get a random murlock) Oracle’s spiritual successor.
---
&gt;I have high hopes for it going forward and I hope they keep patching it.
---
I very highly doubt it, Blizzard needed ridiculous community pressure to even update Rexxar.
---
Ideally, card changes only tap the power of a deck down, not outright kill it. The article itself does say Control Warrior was "knocked down a peg," and it isn't as strong as it was last week.
---
As such, the nerfs likely did their job perfectly.
---
No I'm pretty sure there's nothing fishy about that image, looks just how I remember the Lich King final boss
---
May I ask what your list is? I looked at one earlier and it had me scratching my head..
---
Not sure.. It just seemed like I should hide it. Wasn't trying to publicly shame this specific person.
---
I'd say for long term results, craft one of the classic legendaries. Bloodmage, Harrison Jones, Edwin
---
Right, playing Mage was a grievous error on my part. I should have spent my dust on Omega Devastators, Blizz clearly wants everyone to play control warrior and nothing else.
---
Bump
---
*When seven fucking bears just isn’t enough.*
---
I think maybe if the art and name were an excellent representation of what you're supposed to do with the card, that'd help a lot.
---
I mean they've already done 2 substantial patches to it, including the common community request about silencing frozen minions. The last patch had A TON of zephyrs changes.
---
He became a youtube scammer apparently.
---
Good job. Now you can GO CHARGE YOUR GODDAM IPAD. Thank you.
---
How is that perfect? Warrior was (and is) a bigger problem than Mage for a longer stretch of time, but Warrior gets a slap on  the wrist which won’t change how they play much at all while every single viable Mage deck is scrapped.

---
Make it a minion with an in play effect: "your hero has taunt on your turn"
---
Because OP is comparing secret mage, i.e. the image/deck super imposed over lich king, with lich king to exaggerate the difficulty of beating that deck. Pay more attention to the image and you'll figure it out yourself. Stop being so cynical.
---
A one mana bump to Conjurer's Calling is not going to kill the card.
---
“Fair” and “Not fair” aren’t derogatory terms and have nothing to do with the strength of a deck. A fair deck is a deck that operates on the usual axes of interaction for a hearthstone deck and doesn’t significantly cheat on mana. Midrange is the quintessential example of a “fair” deck, but most aggro and control decks qualify as well, even if they are oppressively overpowered. Similarly a 1/100 meme combo deck would still be considered “unfair” because it operates on an axis most decks can’t interact with beyond simply killing you first. 
---
Murloch paladin would be considered an “unfair” deck because its gameplan is to cast an 8 mana spell on turns 4 or 5 and hope the opponent doesn’t have a meaningful way of interacting with it.
---
That’s so funny I forgot to laugh.
---
Nice, it definitely felt like mono-green was a little lacking in the "play an 8/8 on turn 2" department so this card feels perfect. I mean, I didn't like this trend of having to play your hilariously over-statted creatures from the graveyard anyways. I'm curious, though, if this would be more fair if we gave it Trample? Certainly getting an 8/8 on turn 2 simply isn't enough in Modern anymore, and I fear that without Trample this card will be too weak. Also, maybe it should summon 2 2/2 bear tokens as well to balance it out a little bit more. I think that only getting an 8/8 on turn 2 without any extra creatures is too little for the current meta, and perhaps adding another 4 power worth of 2/2 tokens will bring it more in line with the other decks in the format.
---
Are you illiterate? Spending thousands of dust on the most expensive deck in the meta a couple weeks into a new expansion when it featured two extremely controversial cards while there were several other competitive decks, some that were *much* cheaper...*that* was your mistake.
---
Your excuses are pathetic.
---
All Mage decks are dead, spoiler alert.
---
I don't have premium. I just looked at the most popular warrior deck in Hsreplay.
---
Or you know, he is making a comparison to a final boss of an adventure, as a way of joking about the power level of secret mage. And which boss would you pick, of course Lich King.
---
Priest quest. While i love the card, and think it does have potential someday, it's a far cry from the "omg OP" complaints it saw on reveal
---
Nice try farming karma.
---
I don't think Warrior is dead in the water just yet though.
---
Baine is the beef.
---
So why even print the cards at all if crafting them will only ever be a mistake?
---
Why king phaoris is so good with this deck?
---
That’s nothing. I got death threats before.
---
Sure, here it is :

AAEBAaIHBq8E+g6RvAKe+AKggAOftwMMqAXUBfMRmxWStgKBwgLrwgL70wLR4QKm7wKPlwO1nwMA
---
I don't think I tweaked it during the climb, but I strongly suggest to change some things if you face a more control meta.
---
So you saw 29 days of Boom at 7 mana, 1 day at 9.  So no shit there wasn't a change.

F2p btw

Ye but you cry about how Warrior nerfs did nothing...well you don't have to. There's a few decks on the rise that destroy Warrior. Just pick em up...
---
Ppl like you try to change the rules of Rock - Paper - Scissor. Rock beats Scissor, not Paper. You need to adapt, not the game.
---
Writing good object-oriented code is basically an art form that leans very heavy on formal datamodelling.

HL warrior - 54.6%, murloc pala - 53.88%, murloc sham - 53.71%, aggro warr - 53.22%, then control warr - 52.76% (only beating HL lock by .01%)

Warx#2560 EU, 80g quest trade (I'll show, you first).
---
You should Ice Walker and Glacial Shard

This card still gives me \[\[Anyfin Can Happen\]\] flashbacks. I absolutely do not like murloc decks as they all feel like the same easy stuff we had for years with just a few new cards. I even less like murloc decks that rely on one card to flood the board. \[\[Prismatic Lens\]\] also brings mana cheating to the murloc pile.  
---
It is the most unfun deck to play against as its potential high rolls are just annoying and some classes simply have no proper tools to deal with 7 murlocs on turn 5... Lens into Scales always leads to the "Of course. What else?!" thought.
---
Against Murlocs? Most of which have 1 health? Yeah, these are pretty good options if you ask me.

4/-/- | Draw a minion and a spell from your deck. Swap their Costs.  
---
Again, I’m discussing the two classes which saw nerfs and highlighting the disparity between how drastic those nerfs were. Shaman and Paladin weren’t nerfed.
---
Madam Lazul may be the least important card and can easily be replced. I’d suggest second Penance or Zephrys. Zephrys is good and I ran it for some time as a finisher against Control decks. This deck draws very fast and you’ll have him activated when you need him lategame. However now I’m facing mostly aggro so I subbed him for Penance.
---
You round up, duh. 80 sounds better and it's cleaner than 71.
---
I don't play to win. I play to... Play and have fun with someone else. And I hope he want the same as me. Have fun TOGETHER. 
---
That's strange for me if you just play to win. Maybe you find what the difference is between each group and why they don't sometimes understand each others.
---
Sure, I’ll just craft cards for those decks with dust I can’t afford.
---
Thanks for fast response im now missing only Amet and 2 epics
---
What tournament you competeing in , bruh?
---
I don’t think you can actually back that claim up. HSReplay, which has every Priest deck with 400 games and 10 different players hasn’t got Quests Priests lists that look like this at all. The Quest Priest lists there are Wall and Resurrect versions. Go see for yourself.
---
Mage is far from bad what makes you think otherwise? Mage is still doing great it has a lot of good cards.
---
Try it and see
---
I'm not saying they balanced Paladin. I'm giving some meta analysis.
---
Because frost nova lets you play echo of medihv and get another Zeph! :D
---
Race to legend
---
And I’m analyzing the nerfs to two strong classes. One was basically untouched and one is borderline unplayable.
---
**”THE MEME FORMAT CALLS...”**
---
Control Warrior got hid hard, too. Its winrate was ~60% before the nerfs, and now, as you said, it's 53%.
---
Lackey and minion both have a sense of being evil cannon fodder
---
Most of the cards are not from the most recent expansion, meaning less resource investment for most players
---
Statistics. No mage deck has higher than a 47 or 48% WR post-nerf
---
Amet is just a win condition on his own and sadly he can’t be replaced. Psychopomps are also very good although they do better in Ressurect lists as there are some mediocre targets from him in this deck. 
---
Hood luck!
---
Definitely not essential, and in this list I just switched one of the acolytes for Leeroy and hit legend earlier today.
