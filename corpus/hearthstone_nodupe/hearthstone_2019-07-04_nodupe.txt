There was a reason she was called thighmane. I'm disappointed.
---
She does actually wear a kind of dress in some of the later issues of the WoW comic. #16 and #21, if memory serves.
---
I totally forgot this card existed...but I won't ever forget the in card description...not that it changes anything for me though (don't interpret that wrong, or do)

Is it a gun made of magic wands (that fires magic)? Or a gun that fires magic wands as projectiles?

First game with Paladin. Discovered Prince Liam on curve. All chickens and spare parts, be gone!

&gt; Cards that you want to avoid:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ANYTHING THAT ADDS CARDS TO YOUR HAND
---
Except Antonidas. Antonidas carried me.
---
Except the whole premise of wild makes it implicit that there will be broken mechanics and that it will be unbalanced.
---
I started in BC, and I have played Classic WoW in the past. You could tell there was love in making of that game compared to what it is today. MoP had that love, too. I haven't played since WoD, but WoD didn't seem to have it. I can't say for certain for Legion. Granted, it could just be me.
---
Baited arrow will be the next nerf
---
Heist first, then arena. Heist is at least a couple weeks of fun in total, and way more if you go for 100% completion (completed each wing with each hero, each hero power, each deck, and both difficulties)
---
Fire festival should start in 1-2 weeks I think 7 packs and 400 gold expected
---
Because it‚Äôs not something likely to happen. I thought it was well established that sexual and ideological content in media is censored in China. As such, companies like Blizzard don‚Äôt have very much reason to risk their access to the Chinese market over some art/card design choices. While they‚Äôre obviously not purging all vaguely sexual content in the game, at the very least, I doubt that they‚Äôd decide to reintroduce a ‚ÄúSuccubus‚Äù for little gain. 
---
But hey, I might be wrong, and either way it‚Äôs not a huge deal. The deadly shot art change bothers me more just because it‚Äôs a card easy to recognise by its art which is now different, though that‚Äôs not hard to get used to either.
---
dO yOu EvEn HaVe CoMpUtErS????
---
Nah I make my presence known through emotes
---
Given the deck's nature as a control-combo deck, it's goal is to slow the game down until it can win through its combo.
---
It is quite interesting to play with, but yeah, it isn't the best experience to play against.
---
Oh. It was Mike then, not Dave.
---
Such a weird time to reveal a card but after the 2 day drought I‚Äôll take it
---
Thanks! I can def see that. Working on a night elf rogue type character next :)
---
"Gimme free dust. I need a new legendary card."
---
Yeah to be honest I only looked at the stats and effect, I didnt see the cost lol.
---
The Chairman should be a 10 12/12 at least
---
Actually, yeah, a link would be cool.  I wasn‚Äôt aware of any recent changes.
---
With any set of packs, the odds are about 1/20 per pack to get a legendary card. BUT after 39 packs with no legend, you‚Äôre guaranteed a legendary on the next one.
---
Value is not the same as card generation buuuut yes in the current state it just gives them more card generating power. Again the whole thing the class identity is the future route not the current
---
Nice FLstudio mastering üòÑ
---
Lackeys
---
It's a months old change...
---
It says 6 battlecries cards on the post. Important for Hagatha.
---
Thank you Chris_Attalus, I managed to get it working for now.
---
Is the main down side that you'll have 8 mana a turn, can't summon totems, and mess up your mulligan?
---
Oh boy, "Battlecry: The Class" gets ANOTHER Battlecry legendary
---
Dont take Reddit too serious. We are all just emotionless robots programed to interact as if the site is still crowded with people. Beep boop

My bad, corrected.

Hey Rafaam, do you want this artifact?
---
Do you want it?
---
*crush*
---
:)
---
...
---
Pretty sure it's claws
---
You are the one who gave him the high ground, and it was in the middle of the discussion. Just saying...
---
I'm wondering how you came to realize this.
---
Honestly I really like the direction these Quests are going, very much seem like strong boosters to ur archetype  instead of entire deck design around it.
---
Chinless*
---
Seems insane with jade in wild.
---
Looks like a boss from adventures. Pretty dope!
---
Congrats, bro!
---
For the betterment of their motherhand*.
---
There's already a few Shaman decks where this makes the cut pretty easily. Mutate Shaman in standard and Jade Shaman and Combo Shaman in wild come to mind straight away as neither of those run Hagatha. I also want to point out the synergy this has with that new river croc that draws a card.
---
I'm glad that so far these quests aren't being designed as win conditions. I was pretty worried when quests were being reintroduced, but this is definitely the best way to go about bringing them back.
---
That's why Big Priest is their favourite deck
---
This seems to be the easiest quest to date, battlecries are like 50% of your deck nowadays. 
---
Taunts deathrattles new spells discarding and floating mana are all worse to do then just playing good minions on curve.
---
My bad, haven't played arena in about a year. Do you happen to know which patch this came with? Great change either way.
---
Can you not?
---
It's pretty meh unless you can hide it behind taunts, and still prone to dying after a single turn.
---
I can't remember which exactly, but it was this year.
---
Have you guys looked into how slow the animation is for plot twist? The animations in general feel a lot slower and it's seriously interfering with the fun of the game.
---
priest is in a pretty bad spot rn so i wouldnt recommend going all in. If youre still bent on playing priest, here is a decklist from vs. wall priest has been decent in the past with a lot of practice but nothing strong at the moment

The Curious Case of Benjafin Button
---
I didn‚Äôt think this seemed too good until I thought about the Lackeys. They‚Äôre already playable by themselves, but they help you complete your Quest and the new Hero Power gives them a lot more strength in the late game. I‚Äôm curious what the new Lackeys will be like. If they‚Äôre the same power level as the first 5 I think this has a ton of potential, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they‚Äôre a bit weaker this time. I‚Äôm sure Shaman will be getting some more good Battlecries as well. 
---
My concern is that this doesn‚Äôt really fit with any of the current Shaman archetypes and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs good enough to make a new archetype. I think you could put this in one of the current Shaman archetypes with more Lackey support, but idk if that would actually make any of the decks better. We‚Äôll have to wait and see though.
---
Wrong sub
---
 I'm sorry. Maybe in a couple years. I wish tho
---
Difference is this was on turn 4.
---
He doesn't use it to supplement poor vision, it is to enhance his inspection of things and this can be used on either eye

I think it was pretty good for Patron Warrior during BM era and until Grim Patron rotated.

*laughs in shudderwock
---
Thank you! I'm probably going to binge a bunch of big tymers tonight
---
Um yes.
---
Shaman has a lot of card generation right now so I‚Äôm not sure how essential that one draw is. I still think this probably isn‚Äôt strong enough to justify playing, but idk if the card draw is what‚Äôs going to keep this back.
---
But how would it differ from the current structure of completing quests daily. I don't play the stupid shooter genre so unsure of the specifics to which you talk. Battle pass is an incredibly broad term in its execution and changes depending on who you ask.
---
he doesn‚Äôt actually need the monocle he just keeps it for that +1 fancy explorer status
---
Cat nails can scratch glass?
---
It doesn't necessarily have to fit with "current" Shaman archetypes. Shaman already has a nice bounty of Battlecries and Battlecry synergy cards to go along with this quest, to the point where I wouldn't be surprised if a Shaman Quest deck would be pretty viable already - without seeing any other cards for Shaman in this set.
---
I mean, just think about the 2 Mana 2/3 that draws you a card *as a Battlecry.* It's premium stats with card draw that furthers your Quest progression for not one, but *two* quests.
---
Not to mention... you can just play this instead of Hagatha the Witch in Murloc Shaman. Between Toxfin, Coldlight Seer, Murlocs from Underbelly Angler, Swampqueen Hagatha, Sludge Slurper, and no doubt the EVIL Cable Rats you'll be throwing into this deck, that's a lot of Battlecry.
---
The question *then* becomes... is it worth replacing Hagatha the Witch? And honestly, if you have enough Battlecries... yeah, it very well might be. It seems like it could be a lot more high octane than Hagatha, which would fit the Lackey and Murloc playstyle.
---
The only problem with such a card being that it takes your Turn 1 play, which isn't exactly good for your Tidecallers or your Slurpers.
---
Out of topic, but I think you should get a custom flair or something here in this subreddit
---
 Yeah I don‚Äôt mind, send me the link when you finish it. Would be cool to see.
---
You mean the card that multiple decks already run? Rogue runs it, token druid runs it... Yeah sounds like shit dude, awful card
---
Never for Warcraft. ;D
---
What's YOUR problem? You're talking out your ass about a theory, I pointed out that's not part of it. Why are you so defensive about a theory you didnt create?
---
left looks like he‚Äôs gone through some shit
---
Bro,
---
You don't "claim ownership" over a theory. And you don't dictate what is and isn't part of it.
---
You are being a Grade A idiot.
---
IOS user , still not working even after the new path update , I can't get pass the opening hearthstone logo
---
Can I have two quests active? 
---
Can I put two in my deck?
---
The previous quests definitely fall under that rule. New quests are yet to be confirmed tho. 
---
If we could get it from hagatha, its a huge nerf to hagatha.
---
you rerolled 8/8 legendaries for 3/3s??
---
Bouncing a few ideas and discussing deck building and all you do is quote yourself as if you've "already addressed everything."
---
Yeah, that comes off as treating it like an argument and you're only here to "win" one.
---
Which is pretty pathetic.
---
Anyone have a list of conjuring mage(minion vers. not the cyclone one) or deathrattle hunter that does well on ladder?
---
It is one of the worst cards in the deck, Zentimo is a better fit for the deck and even he doesn't make the cut.
---
They should release a card call The Needy
---
bolderfist oger
---
Because it's dumb as fuck. They should've left it alone. Succubus were one of the coolest demons in Warcraft and Blizzard is just continuing their spiral down the drain with these actions. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Looks like he might be skipping ~~dig~~ leg day though
---
Muh roads!!
---
Seems extremely good. Very easy to fulfill and a very powerful effect in just about any type of deck.
---
You cant just throw random shit into a theory and hope shit sticks to the wall. Not how it works. You're the one who is resorting to name calling over a theory in a card game lore. You sure you should be calling anyone an idiot?
---
I guess girls just are not allowed to have boobs anymore... Shame.
---
What's the "grammatical joke", you mean the pun? "anyfin"? 
---
I feel like this isn't so much them "not getting the joke", as someone shit posting and then some more shit posting happened.

Seems like Brann's back on the menu, boys

Every tavern brawl gives you a classic pack. Occasionally a current pack and/or a card back.
---
Hey thanks for the update. With the most recent update and even after uninstalling and reinstalling on my Kindle, the app continues to crash on startup. I'm not even able to get to the title screen most of the time before the game crashes. Just FYI.
---
The game just doesnt log in and crashes on the "tavern door" image. Reinstalling several times did not fix the issue, either.
---
I've been playing this deck at rank floors and I love it! Throw in a storm bringer, shudderwock, and krag'wa and you've got some meme magic
---
Or just fencing coach
---
12 mana Doomsayer when?
---
I remember haven't to watch some kids movie for a French class. The main actress had a topless bathtub scene. Was pleasantly surprised.
---
&gt; You cant just throw random shit into a theory and hope shit sticks to the wall.
---
Dude, it's "Is Reno a Bronze Dragon".
---
Shit is already random, rofl.
---
&gt; Not how it works. 
---
Again, *you* don't dictate that.
---
Pull your head out of your ass. Bloody Hell.
---
&gt; You're the one who is resorting to name calling over a theory in a card game lore.
---
Pointing out that you're being a Grade A idiot is not namecalling. That's identifying your behaviour accurately.
---
If you don't want your behaviour of Grade A idiocy being called out, then change it.
---
&gt; You sure you should be calling anyone an idiot?
---
Yes. Because you're saying "This isn't how any of this works" when *it really is.*
---
You're acting like there's this unilateral theory that everyone has to abide by. Weirder yet, you're acting like you an authority on what that theory is.
---
So, again: pull your head out of your ass.
---
If you are complaining about enrage warrior, you're in for a treat when you see enough dr.boom mad genius' played on turn 7 ( or ever) and just slowly be whittled down by its insane value
---
You're comparing hot coffee which was a sex act in an m rated game to cleavage or thighs. I'm thinking you might be part of the problem my friend.
---
&gt; definitely 
---
You guys really like to throw that word around.
---
It's an anti Vaxx copy pasta I believe. Or damn close.
---
Wait a second, this isn‚Äôt freeze shaman.
---
China, or blizzard breathing down their neck over the copyright of the title "skeleton king", which is legitimately a Diablo 1 boss? 
---
If it's China censorship, then how does Clinkz, the bone Fletcher (literally an Archer made of bone)
---
https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Clinkz 
---
and pugna, the Oblivion (literally a mage made of bone) https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Pugna
---
But if you start the game, this doesn't fit into mana curve with slurper.
---
If you have the coin, then this lines up perfectly: coin, quest, slurper + next turn lackey.
---
If I play only the 6 Battlecries for the quest and then the heropoer+Shudderwock - will he cast 12 Battlecries or 24?
---
Nice!! Curious do golden packs follow the same pity timer as regular classic packs? If you knew you were about to hit the pity timer, could you open a golden to guarantee a golden legendary?
---
I mean, this has been pretty common knowledge since 2007, but ok.
---
It has everything to do with China btw
---
In any franchise that starts with "War-", the social status of a person is shown through the size of their pauldrons.
---
I exhaled one time slightly faster than usual from watching this.
---
Card art didn‚Äôt affect any player, but it was changed and we didn‚Äôt get any gold and/or dust for the change. 
---
I am fine with all future card art draw with stricter guidelines, but the ones that were released should not have been changed without compensating the players.
---
I read "Heroin blood donor"...
---
I can still see some blood !
---
How dare you stand where he stood!
---
For your next turn only
---
Lifedrinker
---
With rat and slurper it does look like you can complete this quest *really* fast. If that‚Äôs the case then the 2/3 draw a card probably won‚Äôt be in the deck. Might be better to run novice engineer
---
Yes, but Rafaam clearly has the Staff again during the Heist. You can see it when he does last chapter's narration.
---
Also, it is worth mentioning that the Caverns of Time are near. They have the dragons and are a convenient to run away to if you are evil, defeated and want to do something drastic to "show them all".
---
the secret is she got cellulite after turning 27
---
Tiananmen Square protests: 8 mana warlock spell, no minions were ever born
---
Lol the coin isn‚Äôt going to help you buddy
---
I dont believe that we do, but the style seems to be set. A 1/1/1 minion with a powerful battlecry (for a 1 mana minion). It would surprise me if the upcoming ones dont fit into that formula.
---
I actually considered mentioning that but I felt like it would have added additional confusion as I would have had to explain the Thunder King and the Mogu empire which would not actually be relevant to the actual expansion. Same with Algalon the Observer and Reply Code Omega. I was trying to be concise and not make a barrage of terms and places.
---
False
---
yeah 9 cards revealed and this one will DEFINITELY be viable
---
Jesus. Can we all please stay classy?
---
*their
---
Blizzard should start ‚Äòbuffing‚Äô cards. Huehuehue
---
They really don't care about it and I have no reason to believe they will. 
---
Example: Tyrande Whisperwind was tied to a very specific promo that required you to have an twitch prime/amazon prime account I think? Important piece of information was - not everyone could due to the country availability of the promo. In fact, many people at that time simply couldn't *legally* obtain her.
---
It was a blunder and it was at this point they said "they are looking into alternative ways of obtaining heroes".
---
This promo was active September 30 - November 5, **2016**........
---
Oh but they had a reason to think that..
---
Maybe they were also looking pre-nerf, didn't the deck gain more traction post nerf??
---
A mod for this sub [posted on r/games/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/c8pvpo/blizzard_is_now_hiring_for_the_same_positions_it/esp00kl/) that this is to replace someone who resigned and not related to the layoffs, but keep the outrage jerk going by all means.
---
&gt; Discover spell?
---
I'd wager on this since Mage's rep is *Reno*
---
But, you basically can't play him again in standard
---
Come on. Every card changed was either a woman or a violent act. If you think this explanation is the truth you're a fanboy of the worst kind.

---
The flavor of the set dictates that the set will probably be likely themed around the League of Explorers, and I find it unlikely for characters like Ra, the creator of the Tol‚Äôvir to show up. I do think it‚Äôs entirely possible for one or two of the titan constructs from the Hall of Orgination dungeon to show up as legendaries with all of them likely showing up in the adventure.

Mods please ban this guy.

feeling like playing a children card game
---
I feel all your points are being underrated by everyone.  Add also,  I don‚Äôt think it is easy to complete.  You need to play battlecries turn 2-7,  less if you play multiple per turn (all minions: no thunderhead).  To do multiples you need a low curve deck.  Then what,  you double a bunch of weak battlecries?  
---
I feel the other strategies will outshine this one; maybe when Hagatha rotates it will take her place.
---

Arena Question:  RoS wont be in the first rotation of SoU, so will you be able to generate "old" lackey cards, with the new lackey-generation cards or just the new ones?
---
It looks good! My only criticism is that the shoulders looks kinda bulky and stiff to me.
---
In my experience, as CS you usually lose before you need to play Shudderwock. CW on the late game just has more removal and big mechs while you run out of steam and your hand is just bad/situational cards from Hagatha
---
it's garbage
---
Arena Question: - Not a SoU related question but a very important one for the arena community: Can you ban conjurers calling from arena pls? I know its not in the next rotation but i and noone else wants to ever see that card in its current form in arena again, it adds the terrible "mct-feeling" towards the game and ruins fun.
---
Yes. In Warcraft, that's the symbol of the league of explorers, not the hat watermark we had in Hearthstone.
---
Played it a lot - Control Warrior wasn‚Äôt regularly killing me outside of fatigue.  They don‚Äôt have nearly enough pressure to put damage the absurd amount of healing that Shaman has available to them.

Should be "Give 6 love"

Adding 3 lategame cards doen't magically transform your aggro deck into a Midrange but w.e. It's like adding Savannah Highmane to a face Hunter deck and calling it midrange. Your deck has a really high ealry game curve with some finishers. 
---
&gt; I think you‚Äôre getting your terms a little mixed up here.
---
I think the problem is that the game have turn out so aggresive lately that hyper-aggro is the new aggro, classic aggro is the new "Midrange" and tempoish Midrange is now considered Control.
---
Oh god, this one's so good
---
Letting a minion stick on 10, with those terrible stats(for 10) would never work
---
That's Midrange for you?
---
Looks like an aggressive tempo deck imo.
---
I didn't remember the issues off the top of my head, since it's been a while since I've read it. I do remember elements of the plot so I was able to deduce the issues by looking it up on Wowpedia.
---
That's sad
---
Censorship hitting hard damn.
---
Lmao wtf dude she literally finished constructed at legend rank when she played it seriously and has hit legend every season she even bothered to play constructed.
---
If you're going to be angry when you hear the answer, why even ask the question?
---
It's nothing to do with boobs, I'm mostly dissapointed with the changes for Deadly Shot, Headcrack and Eviscerate.
---
That's a very uncomplicated opinion to have about such a loaded word.
---
Reinstall
---
Literally yes. You have offered no evidence other than your say so on the topic, and regardless of the fact that they have different art assets in different regions, they *still made these changes*. You cannot convince me that their obvious dissembling about "standards" or them wanting artists to "feel good" make any sense at all. You think it's not about the Chinese? Fine. Think what you like. Don't know why you're trying to convince me, but you cannot do so, so you might as well give up buddy.
---
Nice read! Have you done something similar for the other expansion? I really love wow lore, and is also the reason i started playing it, but sadly i don't know that much. I would love to read other ones, if you have made them :D
---
I got the hunter quest as my welcome to un'goro bonus, then a duplicate as my 2nd legendary from packs (after Helmet Nesingwary). Thank goodness for the Mercy Rule.
---
I tried so hard to make the quest work, basing it around completing the quest, hemet-ing your deck, playing a tundra rhino followed by Queen carnassa then SMORCing your opponent into submission. 5% of the time it worked every time :(
---
Not always true, for example shadowreaper anduin clears the board bypassing loatheb
---
.....wut?
---
Shhh blizzard might censor it
---
It synergizes really well with the new 2/3 cantrip for quests.
---
10 mana spell [[ Plague of Red ]]
---
Return all minions to their owner's hand. 
---
Combo: this cost ( 6 )
---
You should be able to claim The Frozen Throne and Dungeon Run for free in the blizzard store if you don't got them before they became wild sets.
---
Would confuse new Chinese investors
---
Plus the card that does 5 damage if you have a spell in hand over 5 mana
---
But in the late game it's useless against other Control and hurts your topdecks.
---
And if you get the Quest quickly, you'll never run this, it's a bad draw that does nothing if not played on curve/help the quest, which the first you don't need if you're running enough board clears/control cards and the second isn't needed if you're completing it quickly
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be released in China, like skeleton knight
---
Blizz gets rid of all the succubi for being too hot, then gives Flamewreathed a massive schlong.
---
Probably.
---
Yeah but it's like, more work.
---
Me too, I tried on my cellphone, but stoped at the loading screen
---
Option b was to wait the 6 months they waited.
---
+ Bloodlust next Turn
---
They have pretty much all the assets...
---
Pretty sure the eng version had our spellcraft girl nerfed like jaina years ago, its probably something with magic thats makes em get like that.
---
Soularium is niche ? 
---
If you ever plan on playing warlock ever, it's not going to be a waste.
---
In which case, yeah, why not?
---
2 mana 2/3 with a great upside that you can curve into really well is great. It helps smooth out your curve by drawing better cards that you can play more effectively, helping you use your mana efficiently and get good stats on board(4/7/7). The only thing is you're sacrificing turn 1, and a card in hand, which means you need cards like this, to develop your board and hand
---
They probably too young and their parents blocked all the dirty sites :c
---
All of the Mage damage spells should be modified to family-friendly food.  Instead of the card "Blizzard" (too cold and customers can freeze to death), how about "It's Raining Tacos" ?
---
You assume a whole lot of bullshit aout me. I don't care about only playing tier-1 decks or anything like that, but when almost nobody plays those classes on ladder and even easy to build decks like zoo struggle then there's obviously a problem with the classes in the current meta.
---
I also still play priest despite it being not great, so what is your bold sentence supposed to tell me? As far as I know Zetalot is not very happy with the current state of priest in standard either.
---
Luck.
---
I mean you wait. Aluneth is a great counter to elyasianna
---
Works nice with Hagatha too
---
It‚Äôs all about those angles and filters
---
The precious little boy
---
10 mana spell: spell rogue correctly. 5 stars
---
This means more old gods stuff. üòç
---
I was about to say..
---
But yeah, Isaac Butterfield would get behind this.
---
Yeah I remember playing vs shaman and just shacking at the thought of them playing a 3 mana hex, like what was Blizzard even thinking!? A 3 mana hex!? Come on!
---
^^^^^troggs ^^^^^rule! huh? what was that? ^^^^troggs ^^^^rule! did you hear something? TROGGS RULE! *totem noises* need a light? *0 mana 5/5 noises* 
---
Ok thats enough, I just find it hilarious that when you think of shaman broken cards you think of a 3 mana hex and not the other bullshit
---
But China already has their own version of Hearthstone with their own card art and stuff. They also have better stat tracking capabilities that we have been wanting for years.
---
Realized this the hard way. Oops.
---
[Mike Donais confirmed Reno will be a mage card.](https://i.redd.it/04sh9o0umy731.pngesnmd4b) The way he words it makes it sound like, whether he is a dragon or not, he will not be in dragon form.
---
How*
---
We're gonna be r- Wait... we are rich?
---
Damn. Barebones? Maybe if you don't like a game you should just... I don't know. Go play another one?
---
There are affordable competitive decks literally every expansion. Often some of the best decks are very affordable. It's super easy to be F2P and competitive in Hearthstone.
---
My favorite is nightbane Templar, which was also my first golden so it kinda gets brownie points.
---
Please, you guys care so take a few minutes to sign. Please
---
Even so, a card shouldn't be released 3 times. Also, Spirit of the Spark.
---
Have been very successful with Leeroy in my shaman deck. Can pair him up with the minion that gives windfury or with bloodlust for that little bit of finishing damage.
---
Thanks,I hate it
---
Roses are red,violets are blue, "i concede to your power,my thanks to you."
---
just play warlock in wild, plenty of great decks
---
I am not so sure about the power level. You still have to pay 2 for the hero power. It will work well for control decks and pretty much only that. You can't combo it with shudderwock though which is a slight letdown :(.
---
So much better too. Its terrible, but its great.
---
They used to with hunters mark. I miss it
---
Please, you care, please sign it only takes a few minutes
---
You can try to play a control shaman, if you can invest some dust into shudderwock and the rares you need. Here is a "budget" list I came up very quick, so you have a place to start. I don't know if it's very good, but the journey is part of the fun. Optimized you can find online, just don't buy into legendarys like jepetto / swampqueen / storm bringer , since they are not needed to win, but will boost your deck.

3 times in 5 years and hundreds of cards...

All of a sudden the main point of your post seems a little irrelevant, no?
---
You craft control staples over time and build around what you open whenever possible. Same general principles behind building any deck as a F2P player.
---
Yeah but the meta is completely different, because of the format. But asides from that your argument is still valid.
---
Not in his new art! It was too scary for children to see someone healthy and fit
---
&gt;  Just because you are running nine drops, doesn't make it a Midrange deck.
---
This.
---
You're right.
---
I forgot Barnes is no more with us.

Ok, I'm playing big priest.

I have personally marched for LGBT, equal pay for women, and climate change here in the UK and have always voted left. I think that makes me hard left my friend. I can not think of a better time to use the phrase 'virtue signalling' than when some are trying make others feel bad for enjoying slightly more gorey and sexualised artwork (which was extremely mild in any case) in a card game aimed primarily at a young male demographic, that was really doing no harm to anyone whatsoever.

Hey Reddit, WE GET IT. You like complaining about Hearthstone. How about you make some more creative posts?
---
Is Hearthstone your first card game?
---
It's most likely the opposite. Outrage over non-issues like this diminishes legitimate criticism by making communities look like whiners who will complain about anything. Why take other complaints seriously when similar amounts of anger were stirred up by something that doesn't really matter?
---
The 2/3 prevents you from drawing into fatigue when you play Shudderwok.
---
I like the game which is why I play it. Since when did I say contrary? Tournament mode was supposed to release sometime this year (or was it last year?) and probably never will.
---
Trade?
---
Cool, just downloaded it. I‚Äôll start playing tomorrow.
---
The only play is to attack Murloc Tinyfin to assert dominance.
---
Yes warlock
---
Hopefully...highlander priest was and will forever be my favorite #surrenderyourwilltothecabal
---
Yeah. Im looking forward to quest elekk plot twist contol warlock
---
They give full dust if they change the way a card functions. An art change doesn't change how it functions.
---
Just like Apex Legends or Classic WoW the hype will be gone in 3 months so you gotta jump on it as long as someone cares about it.
---
This... Does put a smile on my face.
---
He sent himself to the Shadow Realm.
---
It was a reference to this card: https://youtu.be/n2tzxc7nHms
---
At the start of your turn send all minions to the shadow realm.

Get ready to rope then. I'll probably have to drop rank a bunch before we have a chance to bump into each other, but when I do...

---

---
Control warrior might not be dominant in the meta, but will strangle any attempt from any other class at a control deck until omega assembly and Dr Boom rotate.
---
Way to powerful and easy to achieve surely, a permanent brann? Balance?
---
Yeah, but there‚Äôs at least 1 turn of blood product processing where they split it into cells, platelets, and plasma. Then, your blood can go to any random person later.
---
Will we get the fire festival double gold ?
---
Oh man i will be so happy
---
This brawl is super fucky. There isn‚Äôt really any actual draw mechanics you just get copies of cards in your deck every turn.
---
Possible. But in contrast to Apex/ WoW it is super easy, cheap and fast to produce more content for the game plus the genre has tons of untaped design space.
---
Yeah I've noticed the distinction as I've played the mode more. And the removal of unwanted cards is powerful in its own way. Definitely gonna play around with it more.
---
Actually it doesn't do the same thing. Big priest cheats out big minions early while standard res priest just brings back what they played for normal costin the late game. That's the reason it's trash. By the time you start doing anything meaningful, you're dead
---
The only fire festival worth getting excited about
---
~~+1 spell damage~~ +1spice

Stop playing warrior. Please.

If the previous ones provided much value they would've obviously rehired them (or never laid them off in the first place).

Me too. Playing Underlords since I got a closed beta code from battle pass and it is so fun to play and all games feel different.

Annnnnnnndd that last prediction has already fallen flat. Apparently Reno the Casino Mage will be a thing. IMO doesn't really fit Reno, but maybe it has a similar condition similar to the original Reno.
---
To me its not new, it reminds me heavily of those mods games like dota that were played in WC3 built from the very editor. I am not personally interested in jumping into it but I can see why.  Honestly I would like it to be present a real challenge to hearthstone simply cause the game hasn't had one so it hasn't had to adapt or be competitive (on pricing, modes etc).
---
Was the buffed Prelate the only one that had died up to that point? Because if I understand the brawl mechanics correctly, if you played 2 Immortal Prelates and they both died, you should have 4 in your deck.
---
Send all minions to the corn field
---
So what does Injured Blademaster do again? This is very confusing for me.
---
Your reward was having it all this time while others didnt.  Having an old cardback doesnt make anybody more special.
---
There's a almost game breaking but currently on IOS
---
Whenever a notification appears or one of the IOS menus is pulled up / pulled down, it will instantly disconnect you from the game and kick you to the main menu. You can reconnect by attempting to start a new match but it's such an easy thing to do and it's so disruptive
---
With all the artwork changes to make Hearthstone more children friendly, Blizzard will probably hire a priest to be CM.
---
I‚Äôve been playing a plot twist beast warlock with the guy that gives 2/2 when you draw a beast. Actually does decent but with this quest and hopefully some more powerful beasts it could go all the way to not complete garbage lolol but it‚Äôs a fun deck bc no one knows what the hell youre doing
---
Those 5 months are quite critical:  Do you think it's possible that in that time, one of the surviving CMs may have quit and needed to be replaced?
---
An old cardback becomes not exclusive (which is the whole point of cardbacks), and there's no new cardback for long-time players? Great?
---
Easier and cheaper for Blizzard this way, I guess.
---
Generally I pass turn 1 with my current list. The only 1 mana card I play is \[\[Sludge Slurper\]\].

Nope, the little fucker completely gimps you on anytime he's included in a mass summon. He sees everyone hit the board the same time and just smacks.
---
I get annoyed with them until I see a really good one. Then I have to upvote. I‚Äôm part of the problem, I realize that.
---
What do I get for doing it? I already have the card back. If they just give nothing out for people who already have it that‚Äôs kind of disappointing. I‚Äôm not against them giving the card back out, I just hope they don‚Äôt shaft veterans by not having anything in place of it for us. A card pack or two would be totally fine.
---
I got when It originally was out. It's my Second card back and i use It till this day :)
---
Hey bub, keep your cock sucking mouth shut about American politics. You're not American, and you've proven yourself to be extremely ignorant about it. **KEEP YOUR IGNORANT COMMENTS TO YOURSELF!** Got it, mother fucker?
---
Potentially, but the optics of Blizzard having record sales figures, then layoffs, followed by rehires is suspicious at best. My theory is that if Jim Sterling's: by rehiring people, you can pay them starting salary instead of veteran salary, or worse, contract work, which cuts your benefits in many ways.
---
He just stopped working out
---
It kind of is another type of card game genre.  Just like Slay the Spire was incorporated into Hearthstone Adventures in RoS, I wouldn't be surprised if this gets incorporated to a future Adventure.  (or WoW/HotS  does one)
---
As soon as they have a ranked ladder function in TT...watch out.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. But it‚Äôs what I think is going to happen. It also feels like Mage has the most varied spells/minions in the game that would make building a Highlander deck easier to accomplish. 
---
For example, Book of Specters, Research Project and Arcane Intellect, three different spells low cost card draw effects. 
---
Reno is Highlander. I don‚Äôt see him not being attached to that mechanic. And I don‚Äôt think the Highlander effect will heal mage to full, instead, it will grant Mage a Hero in the form of Reno Jackson.
---
So?
---
Yes; Supreme Archeology only works because Plot Twist exists.
---
And franky; completion of that quest hinges entirely on drawing one of your 2 copies of Plot Twist, barring any further Mulligan Warlock support.
---
So I would not say Supreme Archeology is more difficult to complete than quests like Taunt Warrior's quest, or Marsh Queen in a low cost hunter deck.
---
Quest Rogue not only had so much value, but was so, so *quick.* When your little bodies are 4/4s, and especially when those 4/4s have Charge, *that's a massive deal.*
---
I don't think this compares *so well* to Quest Rogue for that reason. But hey, Battlecries are instant-impact, right? Lifedrinker, Lackeys, and especially Barista Lynchen. All of these can be very threatening once you begin doubling up.
---
&gt; Also, pretty much all the battlecries are about aggression or value. How does this deck survive? 
---
That's why I mentioned Lifedrinker and Mind Control Tech. But there's also particular spells like Zap, Lightning Storm, or even Dragonmaw Scorcher depending on the meta.
---
&gt; but when your opponent has a full board of minions, what are you gonna do? Lightning Storm?
---
Hagatha's Scheme is still a thing as well, though we know how draw dependent that is, so I'm not convinced that'll suffice.
---
It's a fair question. And I think a bottom line we can both agree on is, especially without seeing more Shaman cards, we cannot reliably accurately speculate on how formidable a Quest deck will be.
---
I'll be interested to see what Shaman cards get printed that will synergise with the Quest. And I'll also be interested to see what *other* classes get as well, and how that may compare. If they're too fast, that's a danger. If they have even better value generation effects, that may also be a danger.
---
For now, I can only guess that the Quest Shaman's "strength" will be just after completing the Quest. It will have a period of great tempo and value generation that beats anything else for the next couple of turns. Then it burns out a bit, while other decks will be about to hit their peak. So against Aggro, you're looking to survive until you can unleash a Battlecry onslaught, and against Control, you're looking to build up to your climax and let loose before they're given a chance to reciprocate.
---
But like I just said, we can't even accurately speculate yet, I think.
---
I wouldn't want all of them altered.  Sometimes your opponent's class is a pretty good class to gen cards from, like Paladin.
---
Still, I let out a gasp when I saw the card change.   This makes Thief Rogue much stronger against other Rogue decks.
---
Yeah, no. If blizzard censors a game that is based off a non family-friendly game in the first place that‚Äôs stupid.
---
I think the archetype is here to stay.  I don't know who will "win" but the game model is very addicting and very fun.  Just look at all the companies who had a take on Battle Royale.  It isn't the necessarily the first adaptor that wins (PUBG) but the archetype stays (Fortnite)
---
They fired 800, they're hiring 1 6 months later.  Not sure how you come up with a theory that this was a fire/rehire scheme.
---
had to google that, not gonna lie.
---
To chill with Rafaam
---
I didn't say it was.  But that's pretty much my whole experience so far, so I'd say now feels pretty damn great.
---
Id rather use a cardback because I like the card back and it fits my decks theme than use it just because its old. And I would rather see some of my opponents actual personality amd tastes than "I happened to play a match this month and now Im gonna use it to flex on people who dont give a shit"
---
If cardbacks took any skill to get it would be one thing. But they are literally participation ribbons. Opening them up is a good thing for everyone except for people who can only get hard from having something other people dont.

For someone trying to figure how to pronounce a word by looking at it's pronunciation, how the hell does anyone figure out what this is suppose to mean?
---
Did they ever come out saying why they did this, besides the china market ive heard  going around?
---
The manufactured outrage continues....

Warrior without Elysiana?

Finally a ball I can eat.

Not projecting.

Simple rule of the world : want something ? Put an effort or let the train slips by.
---
Worthless legendaries?
---
Rafaam is good and  Fel Lord Betrug is good enough to spawn a deck on it's own.
---
That legendary would at least be playable in the same deck as Betrug.
---
The alteranivte is to work off speculations, assumptions and mind-reading. 
---
You can have doubts and there are almost always multiple contributing factors to decisions, but you can never 100% know intent unless it is also explicitly stated.
---
This is scarily similar to my situation! Only real difference being that I did happen to cave after RoS released and buy the $10 bundle, but didn't succumb to the inevitable disappointment of a bigger pre-order. This is compared to previously typically buying every version of a preorder available. I don't intend to get them this time either. Being essentially F2P is really not all that different from dropping over $100 per expansion on packs, especially with how little I've been playing lately.
---
Yeah, but that doesnt change the fact that people craft cards because they are cool.
---
At least refund the gold ones, since the only reason to craft gold cards is for the animations.
---
Which they changed.
---
That sounds suspiciously rapey...
---
Well if we're talking about cards that are already in the game, it'd be the following: 
---
  
---
First, we gotta divide soft-restrictive cards from hard-restrictive cards. For example, a soft restrictive card is book of specters, because it works even if you have spells, it just has a drawback. 
---
Hard-restrictive cards are like Baku and Genn, where, if you don't fulfill the requirement, they straight up don't work. 
---
When I talk about deck-restriction cards I talk about the latter. Anywho.   
---
The options would be: Even, Odd cards, such as Baku and Genn. 
---
The "if you don't have any card that costs x do that" cards such as the prince Kaleseth. 
---
Highlander cards of course. 
---
"If your deck has no minions do x" or "if your deck has no spells do x". 
---
Playing with tribes is also fun, so for example: If your deck only contains Beasts, Murlocs, Pirates etc, do x.   
---
And so on and so forward.
---
Except this is a game and digital things can be easily replicated and events can be reintroduced.
---
totally agree with you, theres a tonne of people in this thread saying no one gave a shit about what card back you were using so get over it but I disagree. I love using my naxx cardback just because it's a reminder of how long I've been playing. It really cheapens it now!
---
My joy is the exclusivity of having it.
---
I dont have the tespa or some other cardbacks, but the joy players who use them have is knowing not everyone can have it.
---
Some old cardbacks are really simple by today's standards, yet are still used exactly because people can no longer get them.
---
Why is the eye piece on the other eye now?
---
Take all the minions to your grandfather‚Äôs farm.
---
The history makes it look like you already attacked with the wisps.
---
Too much cleavage , blizzard plead nerf for the children
---
What! Where?
---
&gt; *It feels like I‚Äôm in* [*r/hearthstonecirclejerk*](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstonecirclejerk/) *and is why I hid the subreddit from my feed. It‚Äôs the same unfunny joke over and over.* 
---
Whether funny or not, it's an intentionally ridiculous response to an equally ridiculous initiative by Blizzard that is absolutely deserving of the ridicule and grief they're getting.
---
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre right. 
---
Let‚Äôs see all of their analytics show this and the game is declining in revenue and popularity. Let‚Äôs say the executives and share holders want to identify new demographics they can extend to, and then try to identify what barriers or obstacles may exist.   See children and tweens is relatively untapped, but the game may have some images that would not pass for PG rating.
---
This demo would not have their own credit cards, but don‚Äôt forget that you can buy Blizzard gift cards. Look how many products have been marketed towards kids over the decades and remember that they still receive gifts and allowances.
---
Yes, except blizzard will have to deal with the consequences if they do.
---
Its fine to replicate 1 or 2 old events and have those card backs again, its a lot less acceptable if they put back every single one.
---
Much like in WoW, some titles can not be achieved after a certain time , so either be there on time, or dont hope for it later.
---
Zartos#1150 NA 80g quest trade. You go first
---
Nice.
---
Quite the match.  Interesting to see development balanced cards vs beta and final release.
---
Chickens are beasts
---
Because he is resting the other eye.
---
I am not up to date on blizzard news can anyone explain these posts I see.
---
I unironically am jumping on the gold comment train too
---
Oh yeah you're right.
---
Depending on how hard you beat a horse it doesn't last a month though
---
I unironically want Platinum for no actual reason
---
Then you were lucky enough to play against CW which were either very unlucky themselves or not experienced enough. They have so many board clears that nothing should survive on your side. Plus you always need to highroll to actually have a chance against a good CW player.
---
During my climb I faced a similar deck to yours like three times and didn't lose once. But I run Owls and BGH as well, which always helped in the long run.
---
I'm still not convinced that this is Midrange at all, only because it runs some fancy minions and doesn't have Bloodlust. Which makes the deck even weaker imo. But ofc I'm happy that you have great success with it. Asmo seems to like it very much as well.
---
I must of missed it, thanks

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

Make the problem worse, why don't you?

good thing grumble is gone

Sir Finley actually had a quest line in Legion in Stormheim before this as well.
---
No. That's about our only way to protest against ridiculous decisions, along with not preordering.
---
The message that we are edgy as fuck and that our "childrens cardgame" needs boobs and blood to be good?

Cool cool cool.

---
The upstate farm is real dude, my dog and sister live there, that‚Äôs what my mom says.
---
Not at all what I am saying. I am saying, funny you call me a tool.
---
I am saying, art can obviously change. This isn't the first time they've updated it. It is a shame you don't appreciate the new art, clearly immature people who feel the need to insult every time they write a reply are thirsty for boobs and ass.
---
My point. Don't be hung up on art. It is nice, and crafting golden to see it in motion is fun, but there are other reasons to have golden (you really like the card's function, it generates other cards, etc.).
---
If you are going to get hung up on art, like I said, you can just look at it online.
---
I am done too. Tired of arguing with children who are just ganging up on me without actually thinking about things calmly.
---
Please blizzard, nerf Haro Setting-Sun Again, I'm not good at this game, I can't win with the deck I want to play because and I dont want to build a deck around the enemy bosses.
---
I love these posts, keep them coming
---
Let them shitpost, dont be a buzzkill
---
Hi, thanks, I have assigned a flair.
---
Three comments in and people are complaining about the "exclusivity" of a fucking virtual cardback.
---
It's a cardback of one of the most iconic cards in the game, specifically being given out during the *Ragnaros* event.
---
That makes far more sense than getting it from playing the game 4 years ago and getting to Rank 20.
---
This is a question for the AMA!  Given that Zayle will only update on rotation, and not every expansion, I hope Whizbang keeps getting updated each expansion, even if he is only playable in wild.
---
This is of course because china.
---
Okay okay, but if you mean "blood an boobs catering to teenage boys stemming from an isolated gaming culture of the past" with "flavor" then i guess you are just more cultured than i am.
---
People will spout "business is business, welcome to the world" because it never happened to them. The lack of empathy is why this corporate culture won't be changing for a long time.
---
Are you retarded? üòÇ
---
Well since Mind Blast is removed, what *do* you want to see possibly happen, with what we have already and possibly will get with upcoming expansions, to preserve the Shadow Priest aspect in Hearthstone?
---
Came here to say this same thing. I rarely complain about shitposts in a sub, but this has got to stop.
---
Well, depending if the reason for beating the hard was that removing "sexual, blood and skeleton" art was due to china, but blizzard says its not because of china, which everyone just doubts it considering nothing else other than china would remove boobies and bloodies from art on cards.
---
If I would take ice cream from child cus he was suddenly behaving stupid and got punishment (taking the ice cream) = normal, kid shouldnt think stupid things
---
But if I would take gun and kill someone and my reason would be "dunno, felt like it" like blizzard¬¥s response was, then hell everyone would call me devil.
---
They changed how he works with transform effects, so cards like [[evolve]] or [[devolve]] wouldn't randomly kill a player
---
Can this be upvoted more?

Blizzard is not really blizzard anymore though. Activision is out for simply greed not making good games, so they will make it lighter and easier to market to a lower common denominator.
---
Blizzard recently announced they are changing the art for a bunch of cards. Pretty much they just removed blood from cards like [[bite]] and [[eviscerate]]. They also completely changed the art and name of the succubus card, cause it was "inappropriate." So we did what we do best and made it into memes.

Theres also a new card back every month. Theres plenty of good desigbs to come if you're only concerned about aesthetics
---
Also too large for adults. 100% unsafe.
---
Without the whining? Discussion? Nah, that sub's even worse.
---
OK. NOBODY LIKED THE CHANGES. WE GOT IT, PLEASE STOP.
---
nobody notices you have certain cardback aside maybe Legend.
---
I liked his older look better since he looked like a fine gentleman which is pretty funny since he's a murloc. His lines like "Hello, old friend! Let's meet for tea after the match, shall we?" (when facing Morgl) don't really fit the new version anymore.
---
But CS being laid off is not what caused people to unsubscribe. Conflating the 2 is just wrong.
---
Good
---
Hahaha Activision sound like cancer to work for
---
*i will bind you...*
---
Say what you want about his power level, but Raza has one of my favorite voices in the game.
---
Honestly soo true
---
At least he fits into his pants properly now. Buff Finley's pants waist was way too big.
---
Rage?  No, just weariness.  This is reminding me of shit I've seen like this a thousand times in different forms of media.  Comic characters getting less skimpy outfits, Kratos not getting a sex minigame in the latest game.   MtG moved away from sexualized art, and some of the loudest voices complaining about it were the same folks who harassed the games top cosplayer out of the game.   Not accusing anyone here of that level of crap, and while you may not see the people seriously criticizing these changes, but I've seen people quitting, calling for boycotts, ranting over liberal agendas and muslims.  Some people take even the most minor of changes away from their preferences as a personal attack.  Most of the posts here are the same joke over and over, yes.  But when a thousand voices say the same words it sounds like a shout.

How *isn't* it purple?

It's fun and has proven to be effective in the past with other games/devs.
---
i'm so offended by any and all forms of sex-positive content
---
I don't think they've actually said anything about it.
---
As someone from the beginning, just give me a pack and I'm fine, I have a plethora of card backs I don't use.
---
The free mod didn't do it, the F2P versions of the mod from big companies are doing it.
---
How many more arts fall into the category that would apply to these types of changes?  And too what end?  What is at the bottom of this slippery slope everyone is afraid of?
---
It seems that the whoooosher has been /r/whoooosh\\ed
---
That's the point, the hero portrait is there to make you buy the most expensive bundle. If people knew they could just wait to buy the portrait later and for cheaper, they wouldn't be able to prey on the FOMO in consumers.
---
It's obviously making them enough money because they've done this model a couple times now (Elise, Lazul, Jaraxxus) unlike the $50 with King Rastakhan which has only been done once.
---
And it looks like they're done with $10 direct purchases of Hero Portraits in favor of the $20-$30 bundles that come with some packs.
---
The sentence "A Reborn minion will" is also cut off. It's almost like the original article gave an actual explanation of the keyword right after ü§î.
---
It was just a weird complaint 3 days ago and now it's getting super old.
---
It still has Shadowboxer too, right?
---
"as long as a company or authoritative entity does it and i dont mind - it's obviously okay!"
---
TLDR. OP asks to censor the posts complaining about censorship.
---
Cause they fired someone and are trying to replace them? Seems kinda ridiculous to be outraged over that no?
---
I've gotten a bug where you fired 800 employees including most CMs but are now hiring a CM. Can you help me with this one?
---
I don‚Äôt like them changing artwork on old cards/heroes (rip my Jaina), but I will say I do like this version better.

Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty strong in pretty much any battlecry Shaman.  Even just playing it on lifedrinkers on 4 is decent a lot of the time, but it‚Äôs especially good on Japetto, Hagatha, Hotshots, and Shudderwock sometimes.
