Reno doesn't heal the player and also shows how much he healed for in the card history. As someone who hasn't played the adventure I don't know what the max hp is so the big numbers make it more impressive to me

I actually got a whizbang from the tavern recently, didn’t change my deck though :(
---
Wait what? In certain matchups or as a whole deck? Is there a mech hunter list with a 70% win rate on ladder? What was the sample size? 
---
Also, even if any of that made any sense, that isn't how matchups work. If Control warrior has a 60% winrate on ladder and mech hunter has a 70% winrate, that doesn't mean mech hunter is 50% favored over control warrior. 
---
Also also, if you look at mech hunter's actual matchup spread on hsreplay, you do see a handful of 70-80% winrates against certain decks with a large enough sample for HS replay to recognize them - real top tier meta threats like heal druid and big paladin. If you narrow it down to meta decks, then the numbers are more respectable, like in the 45-55% range, with a handful of matchups that admittedly near on 60% favored - but those are the decks that mech hunter is built to be favored in, like cyclone mage, where mech hunter is literally built to punish them for wasting the first few turns of the game to try and play their board in a box card.
---
Also, to again address some comments you made in a different post, none of this is indicative of mech hunter "warping" the meta. Its a good aggro deck that plenty of other decks can be built to have a good chance again. Unsurprisingly, the theme is that these decks are best able to utilize the weakness of mech hunter deck: weak plays from behind. Its an aggressive deck thats particularly strong against late game strategies due to its ability to generate pressure, but particularly weak to early game strategies due to its weaknesses in playing from behind. Lategame strategies do have a chance, however, if they go the big shaman route and pack in a lot of healing, as well as a way to generate your own sticky board. Its still a hunter deck that can't run master's call - it runs out of gas eventually.
---
All in all, while "perfectly balanced" is definitely not applicable, its not broken or meta warping. Its a good deck in the meta. That is literally it.
---
Dude didn't say turn 1 (unless edited). This happens in turn 3

I tried that right away. Unfortunately, no dice. I always turn it off and back on again :)

They each represent the five wings. Each box corresponds to the hero in the same position on the left.

---
If you play brann versus the lady that can do two battle cries she talks about having a screaming contest with him
---
There's a habit of custom designers both here and over in the MTG version to make cards that are built around one "cute" interaction but with no thought of how such things would usually play out.
---
Like the joke being "You give bad spells/creatures/etc. to your opponent" gets old fairly quick, since typically such cards have very specific cards they are paired with.

Tempo Storm is by far the best

Yeah some classes aren't so much fun because they have too many bad buckets. For example rogue always seem to get kingsbane bucket which is pretty unplayable.. also warrior and paladin seem to have some particularly junky buckets like pirates lol

Make mech or midrange hunter. Both are cheap and tier 1

Shouldn't almost every solo-boss be exploitable with Sn1p-Sn4p now?

But they are not played, they are summoned?

yes

You should use coldlight oracle as inspiration.

If kangors isnt that good, what could I choose to replace it’s place in my deck?

Yes ofc, but the amount and kind of OP thing changes the player experience, if everything is OP its getting borning. It should be a good feeling wje you get one of the op strats to work.

What rank?

Also,20 wins and 8 losses is Not 60%

---
Rogue doesn't really have any healing except for ziliax. Try to read the value of trading or going face. Ask yourself if the rogue has a certain minion on board, is it bad if s/he can do shenanigans with it. 
---
So if you pressure the rogue, they have no time to play the pogo crap, and will need to use the cards reactively (like shadow step on ziliax, which I am fine with cause that is less pogo crap.)
---
Im down, adding u now
---
Omg its a priest!
---
1 pack? For 16.99?
---
So basically not worth buying at all unless you like solo content on a pvp game? Okay.
---
Yeah sorta but i bought it cause i love pve and hate pvp so meh. And its a golden pack which gives all gold. Not really to open but to show off lmao
---
Unless it contains 5 golden leggos, I ain't paying that haha.
---
And there comes the Doom...
---
no
---
I know right
---
Oi dansker bri
---
You also get 3 rise of shadows packs per chapter, and if you complete both the normal and heroic you get 2 card backs
---
Alright. Still not worth it then.
---
Wow, that's a big wall to read just to conclude that you need more friends... I agree, we should always the choice but frankly is this really an issue ? I play since the close beta and I never felt that quests are pain to do with other people... But it's just my point of view, I can understand that not everyone are enjoying playing against other real people.
---
16 packs for 16.99 is more worth it, but i mainly got it for the content
---
Yeah fair enough I guess.

I had this one yesterday as priest. I got a seance off of Lyra and I had goggles.
---
So I would play it, it buffs itself a ton, and I get another 1 cost copy in my hand. It also had divine shield and would return to my hand on death.
---
You're fine since it's spells YOU casted and if you did cast that on her well
---
Don’t worry I lost pretty quick against him
---
The math:
---
9 classes x 4 decks x 3 hero powers x 5 wings = 550 full runs.
---
looks like he molten reflection them. He probably had three on board at that point
---
You get guaranteed legendary cards from single player content. In random packs you don't.

Why no shudderwock? So many good battlecries

As for the site; the most downvoted comment says it all.

Except they just started charging for the funsies content. Yet when you play that content there is no way to earn what you need to pay for the next version of that content by playing it.

that was the hero power and treasure i beat heroic ch5 with
---
Not heroic but that game was super hard. I played with \[Robe of Gaudieness\] , from start my strong cards was in deck and after few turns he played candle that replace all cards into legendaries. I have only 2 places on the board like boss but he rolled healing Ragna and it was hard to kill them. Sherazin anways've been asleep becouse of robe effect.

i mean, he needs to like it in the end right

No, they did not. The game did not even attempt the sweeping strikes animation when I attacked both times.
---
Still looking?

TGT's cards are bad design though. The inspire mechanic is snowbally and unfun. The whole set is just bland and should be forgotten

Burning Wit and Stargazing is already OP. That's the only Heroic run I've completed.
---
5th
---
He meant after lich king kills him and transforms into a death knight...i've seen some people complain about this ...may be a bug
---
I believe you just need to beat 5 bosses in chapter 5 for it. You need to actually defeat the 12th boss in a run to get the card back.
---
I’ve got a goggles and bells run right now that I’m pretty sure will be trivial lol.
---
Thanks. I forgot about the card back
---
That's true! Most Murloc Shaman decks don't run Neptulon. Still, when a card is a viable tech inclusion in a Tier 1 deck and has a fantastic winrate, a buff is the last thing that's necessary. Prince Liam is a great option in Odd Paladin, but it too has a low sample size.
---
Neptulon has a home, a deck that can perfectly accommodate him and still be very strong. I'd rather buff all the legendaries that cannot say the same (things like Flame Leviathan or Bolvar Fordragon, for examples from GvG) than a card that has already found success.
---
The uwu killed it for me
---
Do want murloc shaman to be good?
---
Make it 4 mana and decrease the overload to 2
---
Which is why he's a last-ditch refill card, similar to Unite the Murlocs but without the devastating drawback in a lighting-fast aggro deck of taking up a spot in your opening hand.
---
Neptulon is fine. There are dozens of legendaries that deserve a buff before him.
---
same
---
4 murloc tinyfins = best value
---
I just saw someone’s post where they got 2 legendaries in their pack. I’m going to go pop mine now. 
---
“I CAN WAIT NO LONGER”
---
2 rares ? i got.1
---
Mostly because very few people can handle the boredom of facing fatigue Warrior, I instantly concede as well if I reach turn 4 with any deck without a significant advantage, there's no way I'm spending half an hour wasting time with a Warrior.
---

Did they go to negative health or just 0?
---
Please update!
---
pity timer is seperate for.golden packs , so u gotta open 40 golden packs first :-------)
---
Do you have a screenshot? 
---
The overkill condition isn't just killing a minion, it's dealing more damage than the minion has health. For example, for Blast Wave to add random mage cards to your hand, it would need to deal 2 damage to minions with 1 health.
---
Can you give more context
---
If you look through my post history the same exact thing happened to me
---
T’weren’t a very good pack at all.
---
Looks like a draw due to hitting the turn limit
---
&gt; big shaman
---
Also, why would they run this when rag, yshaarj and lich king are a thing in wild
---
I really liked how they mixed minion and passive treasures in this run, as well as returning the heroic mode.  Its actually tough as all get out and I like feeling that I can just lose to boss 3-6.  In dungeon runs it always felt that it was super easy until the last couple bosses

Oh, just me not remembering what that dollmaster does

&gt;There hasn’t been a lot of movement with Shaman. [11point5ft](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-category/player/11point5ft/) proved that they were still a viable class by taking the #1 Legendary spot with a deck built on the back of [Crackle](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/cards/crackle/), [Enhance-o Mechano](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/cards/enhance-o-mechano/), and [**Neptulon**](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/cards/neptulon/). The new weapon for Shaman, [Powermace](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/cards/powermace/), has met with mixed results and could still find its way into the Shaman’s arsenal down the road.

\-GOBLINS VS. GNOMES SEASON 9 – CURRENT TOP META DECKS
---
4 commons 1 rare club checking in!
---
Yes true but very rng dependent and not guaranteed lethal...
---
Played as in "people sometimes put it in their deck," not as in "an optimized list played this." It was not even close to being playable by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Neptulon came out in GvG where there was a bit of competition at 7 mana, to put it lightly.
---
At the time random murlocs were \*really\* bad. Getting a Puddlestomper (2 mana 3/2) off of this would be considered a high roll. Typically you got some 1-mana 1/1s and 3-mana 2/2s in situations where you couldn't gain any benefits from their abilities.
---
Meanwhile, the 7/7 you paid 10 mana for gets taken out by a 3-mana BGH, a Rag shot, or a Sylvanas.
---
What do you mean “put them in manually”
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/55481/elistra-the-immortal?hl=en
---
The magic number for the combo was always 14 and that was if they didn't have a board. Oh I wasn't able to remove Dr. Boom so you played innervate FoN Savage Roar for 29 damage? Nice play.
---
7 more golden pack events and we will know.
---
Though its about immortal aghh my bad
---
I didnt even know this card existed
---
You're right! Haven't played in forever and forgot it gave your hero 2 attack too. Actually doubted myself about 14 when I first typed the comment and just added up treants.
---
With overload 1 it  could be ok. Elemental, murloc and overload synergy.
---
Yeah, Neptulon was one of my favorite cards way back in the day. It was a large body that provided a much needed injection of value when you needed to close out the game.
---
It's still like a 1% chance, better than 0%.
---
Try telling that to Sylvanas
---
Untill Haro shows up, copies it and reks you on his turn two... :(

HenryDaWound#1316 NA. I show you go 1st thanks

There is an encounter that happens if you draft all mechs but im sure its not too rare

Exactly, I'd rather them just print a new card at that point.
---
Or 4 from your deck,
---
really? that sucks
---
Yes please!
---
This is, to be frank, and absurd suggestion.  Neptulon was fine when he came out, he didn't play a huge role in the meta, and neither did shaman at the time, but that doesn't mean neptulon was just a bad card.  
---
Let us not forget, at the time the meta was being dominated by a 7 mana 5/5 that drew 2.  Neptulon probably could have had overload 2 instead of 3, but it would have been way too strong with no overload at all.  There is no way it makes sense to go back and buff 5 year old cards that don't quite match up to today's meta, if you want to see a better representation of Neptulon tell blizzard that you'd like to see them make a new version of him.
---
The “The Grand Tournament” [set]
---
Seems fine to me boys
---
Now use Tarim!
---
Damn, who hurt you? Giants in Hearthstone are the low-hanging fruit of "good" cards and they are *always* around.
---
I've got a standard mage deck right now with 4 copies of giants in it. I'd still happily say goodbye to all of the giants in Standard, they consistently make the format less interesting than it should be.
---
She doesn't replace your hero like ragnaros or jaraxxus, she just gives 5 armor as a part of her battlecry.
---
But does blackrock have stickytoe? The best card for your thieving needs
---
It really helps that the tone is slightly sarcastic.
---
Except that the better players don't need a t1 deck or countless hours.
---
Its a slog I admit.
---
But I suppose decks that play the long game have a place in HS too. At least it cant be "till turntime is over" long. 
---
Yea. Dr Boom Herocard is pretty crazy. The only way to nerf him is to change his battlecry. His 7 armor and 7 mana are untouchable. He is Dr. 7 after all.
---
I think at this stage people need to realize the game has devolved into more of a casual friendly, childrens game than any sort of strategy game.    
---
They need lots of these easy to piece together winning plays/combos to keep that sort of audience interested as that's the audience that will bring them the most revenue.  
---
Unpopular opinion of course because everyone wants to think they are some sort of super genius because they play Hearthstone and get a modicum of success within the game.  It can't possibly be dumb luck for the most part, it must be all skill. ;)
---
Even the one area of skill which was deck building has become cheapened as they start to release stronger recipes now that people just refine.  
---
There is of course always Arena but having that as a pay only mode (gold is currency) is pretty stupid really.   
---
It's such a great draw card to breakup the mundane ladder play that there really should be a free mode.
---
Too damn straight, too damn deep
---
Agreed. Consider that Hunting Mastiff is a 2/1 and only spawns 5 at 10 mana, this card is crazy.
---
**Discovering** 4 murlocs and dropping a 7/7 for 7 mana is too good, if you get underbelly angler and 3 1 mana murlocs, you can easily get a full board on the next turn, if you're on turn 10, if your opponent doesn't clear the board, you can win on the next turn using bloodlust.
---
Hsreplay.net and their Deck Tracker application will do this
---
Deporting for Booty.
---
8 hour work days brother!
---
I think they should follow the Zuljin concept for hero upgrades.  Massive play on the turn it's played but if you can weather that then the on going effect is minimal.  
---
Personally I'd prefer no hero cards at all, they are far too swingy.  
---
Remove rush would be nice from Boom
---
Security rover generating rush minions is crazy and then there is the discover a mech power that pushes that even further.  
---
All in all not a fun experience and fun should be key.
---
There's no magic trick. Just realise that, no, you aren't playing perfectly. This sub seems to have some trouble with that notion.
---
I've cleared the Dungeon with all classes, and I think I've seen it just once.
---
I love the theme but man the card stinks
---
at least you have a good minion on the board.
---
I think it’s more the fact that this was a turn 2 Letha but boss had pretty much the one counter
