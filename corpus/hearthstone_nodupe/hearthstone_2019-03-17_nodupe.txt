THANK GOD! Searching for cards was so unbelievably painful that trying to make a fun deck wasn't even worth it.

---
We exist!
---
What? No, I'm completely fine with losing... in control mirrors that last at least 20 minutes.
---
Now other decks deserve getting removed form the game. Or better, make them match with themselves. Aggro would play against aggro, combo would play against combo and control would play against control. A perfect paradise! No way this isn't a way to fix all problems of this stupid game.
---
Nice you are back! Can‚Äòt wait for the next posts!
---
I might wanna look into that. I got a golden of that Spell when Boomsday came out and never really got to use it

I'm an aspiring digital artist, and this post was so so inspiring to see. I've read through your other answers, and your transparency has actually been so helpful and just motivating to see.  You obviously have a huge knowledge and skill set with digital painting, as well as your natural talent and fantastic ideas for pose, form and colour. If you're up for answering a few extra questions, could you tell me how you learned to paint art like this, and what application did you use? I've been teaching myself how to use illustrator and photoshop, but I am very far away from making art like yours.

&gt; Complete My Deck ‚Äì Hearthstone‚Äôs better at helping you build decks than ever before.
---
&gt; Helps you build established, proven decks using your collection.

If you‚Äôre short of an established deck, the helper will help you choose the strongest stand-alone cards from what you have available.
---
&gt; NOTE: This feature is currently disabled in the Wild format. Please stay tuned for more info on when you can use the smart deck builder to help construct Wild decks.

1-drop as in a 1 mana minion you can play to start off with tempo. Quest is 1 mana do nothing except lose a card from your opening hand.
---
Zul‚Äôjin/Yogg/etc. cast base versions of spells, so they‚Äôll all cast the Scheme at 1 damage (or whatever that one‚Äôs mechanic is).  The Schemes are single cards with dynamic text, not a series of three stepped cards like the Spellstones, so it‚Äôs all pretty much as you, /u/Watermelon86, and /u/coderanger described below.

Took me a sec to realise which sub I was on for a second there, never thought I‚Äôd see and hs/DOOM crossover
---
The only part of this I can answer with any certainty is the flavor side of it, which is that it‚Äôs a keyword exclusive to the classes representing the defenders of Dalaran, and Dalaran is pretty into their spells.
---
After you, who's last? It's Boom, he's the worst known.
---
As the proud owner of an EDH Sliver deck myself, I wholeheartedly agree. :)
---
How exactly did you get 35% from 3/10
---
No, if they want to apply it to a minion they'll just call that 'Twinion.'
---
This free legendary and the random legendary you get from preordering are two separate things. The preorder one will almost definitely be disenchantable. 
---
Not to mention if your opponent plays their own 1 drop it makes snowballing a lot tougher.
---
I have had this too. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an older iPad? Because I think it is a memory issue on iPads/iPhones with only 1Gb of memory.   
---
Like my one....
---
Amazing inspiration lol I was wondering where the image was from 
---
Imagine thinking Pirate Warrior players deserved their legend card backs when they still couldn't figure out if their opponent had lethal.  Imagine being THAT wrong.
---
I'd go with the 4 mana Jaina
---
I think you have it backwards. My code gave the result of 35%, and I rounded down in my written explanation to 3 in 10.
---
True. In an aggro deck you have to make a few tough decisions. In a control deck you have to make many more tough decisions. 
---
You would be much better off simply not putting the X out of 10 at all. 
---
Some people don't equate a percentage as easily as what that means across a series of games. Appreciate the feedback though.
---
R/wooosh me then
---
Nah its Scrooge Mcducks hat
---
Jaina and Baron geddon counts in my book
---
That would require two cards that even with renounce cost more than 10 combined.
---
The crop for \[\[Sudden Betrayal\]\] shows both characters pretty clearly, imo.

Its actually incredibly easy, it just takes time and knowledge of your pocket meta. To many aggro decks? Play odd warrior. To many control decks? Play some even shaman. To many combo decks? Play anti control/combo decks like no fun warlock. To many midrange decks? Play some Reno lock. To many greedy combo decks like big priest? Play even or cube warlock. 
---
I could've added more information or a guide, but I don't consider myself an arena expert so it would probably cause more harm than good if people followed it.

The celebration post itself did have value as a few people congratulated and I was able to share this achievement as I don't have any irl friends that play the game. Granted it doesn't have objective value, but a bit of emotional value for me :)
---
Did you play the 6 mana spell that. Mightve summoned a gold maly?
---
No i just drop it on 9
---
Then you simply don't know how to play zoo properly

Neither one is overpowered, they just make games constantly play out the same. It is a bigger issue with Baku, but it is true of Genn as well

Basically the entire existence of the human race or any other perceptible thing in the universe

I was having this before the update on my android. Now it's been fine.

---
I play odd pal and I never find other odd pals and the rare zoolock, its a lot of mages, priests and hunters with the occasional even pal. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if Hearthstone automatically fixes your matches to your deck, how is it possible I never find other odd pals.

He can't do that ! Shoot him... or something
---
"More creative" : Twin spell and scheme ... 
---
The problem is that you can‚Äôt reveal the cards by rarity anymore (start with common, rare, epic, legendary). I just have to do it that way
---
Its objectively less decision making and less interactive.
---
You can like watching a game instead of playing it all you want, but its clear that the vast majority won't like that, and that taking the "game" out of "gameplay" is a bad idea.

Sound like your local meta down there is just that way.  At rank 5 and 4 where ive been hovering, there is a multitude of decks.  Lots of variety, and i think i hit baku decks only 1-2 out of ten, and genn decks like 1 in 20 or 30 matches.
---
Normally feels more aggro ngl. Also debatable on most popular
---
You forget about the ANYFIN CAN HAPPEN otk combo deck, which was a murloc deck
---
&gt;the only drawback with the card is the combo at 3 mana, the lackys will be less effective by then unless you coin it out
---
That plus the fact that you aren't even guaranteed to get it combine to make it a pretty big drawback...
---
**COUNTERMEASURES ENABLED!**
---
Lame. What kind of show off capitalist pig would attempt such a thing?

Did i misread the last question? i put 80g thinking its per pack.
---
Great job again op! I really appreciate your hard work and saved all your did you know posts! :D
---
Just a small suggestion: as a semi-new player, I'm not familiar with all the cards you posted. So could you please add the name of that card below each art? That would be much help for us to really understand and appreciate the card and its art. 
---
Anyways thanks sooooo much! :D
---
Flametongue nerf had nothing to do with Genn though. Do you really think Even Shaman was oppressive enough to be nerfed lol?

Dreadlord is the best Odd Pally counter in the game. Brutal to drop it turn 4 with coin.

Meta polarity is an another issue for another time, but yeah, meat was near perfect then and people just chose Druid to be the hated class, and when the entire class got slaughtered, meta immediately went out of balance and now Druid just got replaced with Priest
---
Magnetic is activated from hand, like battlecry, overload and combo. The bronzekeeper is still silenced and his text is still crossed out. His tribal tag is still there, so he can be magnetized.
---
im upset they nerfed ram(innervate aswell to nerf was fine  it still couldve been made just refresh 2 Crystals)over ui and plague, and same for psymelon but avianna nerf. 
---
Sindragosa in KOTFT mission?
---
Zayle is the new Whizbang
---
Game crashes when I look at cardbacks and after every game. It‚Äôs the worst it‚Äôs been.
---
Imo UI was actually more or less fine. Strong, sure, but strong doesn't mean it needs to be nerfed. Did more than its mana cost too, but *every* playable 10 mana card does more than 10 mana's worth of stuff with the sole exception of Pyroblast.
---
It was just being UI'd on turn 6 that got me...
---
That doesn't mean Zayle will replace Whizbang completely. They'll both exist in Standard at the same time.
---
Whizbang always uses the two non-Classic deck recipes that exist for a certain class. When RoS comes out, the deck recipes will be updated, and with them ‚Äî Whizbang as well. 
---
Not so smart... On a F2P incomplete collection, he was able to :
---
Screw keleseth decks with other 2 drops.
---
Screw even or odd decks by mixing the costs.
---
Putting magma rager to fill the curve.
---
Putting bellig√©rant gnomes everywhere.
---
Not being able to build a single wild deck even if all the cards are available...
---
Yeah, it works in standard IF you have mostly all the cards... Kind of disappointed.

I believe this is connected to the amounts of money he makes from streaming HS, 30-50k$ per month would make me a happy streamer to. I often watch thijs and he mentions bad cards and mechanics like Rexxar. It‚Äôs not like he is silent. 
---
Ah. Just like WoW and StarCraft didn't go anywhere without Twitch?
---
And it's not "Twitch" culture. It's prepubescent degenerate trying to make fun of someone culture. The guy was ridiculing someone for his legitimate accomplishment. I returned the favor. I'm not a huge fan of publicly berating people for no reason.
---
Hum...maybe im stupid for asking this, but do scheme cards (upgrade every turn) upgrade even if they aren't in your hand? Because they seem like they would be garbage if they didnt... Am i missing something?
---
I watch Thijs almost every play and he is one of the most entertaining streamers now, others are boring or just playing only because of the money. But you need some kind of mild disorder for it, like autism, what Thijs has I think. Mostly the HS as his life, if he travels its just HS, no other social interactions, no edgy behaviour, no GF, only the game and this is all. Also, haHAA.

Murlocs are actually way better in Wild. For some reason Tinyfin and Everyfin is Awesome improve murlocs a lot and the echo murloc is a great recovery tool after a board wipe. It isn't absolutely top tier but definitely above 50% and the games are fast

Is there Ben Brode‚Äôs autograph?

I remember he mentioned in another stream he has also invested a lot of money in property and HS only makes a fraction of his income now (compared to the majority a few years ago) so there is more to Thijs than hearthstone.

Also, I am surprised about the GF part as I always assumed he was gay lol. Probably more wishful thinking my end :D

[Lol no](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/1/1e/Majordomo_Executus%2814456%29.png)
---
&gt; I don't understand why it even exists.
---
I think the intention was to be a free board clear in a control deck (that also gives you a body to play later), so you'd be able to clear the board by drawing this and then develop afterwards, which could be a strong swing turn. The problem, of course, is that 2 damage AoE on some random turn often isn't very useful, and you can hit your own board.
---
Back when Hearthstone was still called Heroes of Warcraft...
---
Haha, rekt
---
These are nice but it would be nicer if you included the card names.
---
Same. Started playing in march 2015. I remember the hype in july/august 2015 when they started revealing TGT cards.
---
I thought he owned a farrari? might just be a joke though.
---
Definitely, many Scandinavian accents are very jarring to me.
---
Why is reynad always right? 
---
It just feels to me like very poor design
---
I like how your graph still goes from lose to win.
---
He has his frustrations but I don‚Äôt believe that its just the money that makes him enthusiastic about the game. He legits enjoys the game even at its worst. I think that‚Äôs what sets him apart. 
---
Alot of popular streamers who earns as much just stopped playing coz they just got bored or was burned out of grinding for ladder over and over again.

Some other even chose to tank their subscribers to stream another game
---
What is the optimum amount of packs to open per expansion 
---
I love these posts, but it really just makes me want a fully redesigned Hearthstone with full card art instead of the tiny bubbles.  Something similar to the Elder Scrolls card game where it‚Äôs a big rectangle that‚Äôs like 90% art. 
---
That's a joke haha, he bought a scale model of a Ferrari.
---
Hey you drop that card like it's AIDS on it
---
Depends on your goal mostly. 
---
I'd rather just look at win rates. Aggro is always the top tier deck.
---
Thanks for that it‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not the only one

I like that you basically stops after 500 wins with just 58 extra wins in total. I have multiple classes at 1k, but others at 200 because I don't like them too much. 
---
To please his large and mostly non-native english speaker audience that couldnt care less about it? 
---
Nah.
---
Netherlands isn't in Scandinavia, if that's what you were implying
---
Yep. It's a Hot Wheels Ferrari!
---
I understand how it works. Not a good card
---
&gt; Its always the accent from your home country that is the most cringy to you.
---
would be nice if you could edit this into the top of the post, i was quite irritated before going into comments :p
---
4. Very wholesome streamer
---
Ok.
---
Yeah, when he mentioned that he had not upgraded his PC since he started streaming it blew my mind. He seems like a very frugal person. 
---
Well, I‚Äôve been playing since just after launch, about 5 years ago... my son played Beta, and I asked him to teach me... it was a very slow process, as I didn‚Äôt even know what a ‚Äòmeta deck‚Äô was until last year.  That helped the last three go by very quickly.
---
It helps that he's becoming well regarded as an Auto Chess educator, people who want to improve will watch him. 
---
And on the este ocassion of being wrong, he admits it. 
---
Yeah, I admire the lad.
---
Consistency, lack of competition in his time zone, also he‚Äôs insane.
---
This is terrifying.
---
&gt; Surely the deck plays enough minions to dump all removal spells no?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Now I actually wonder whether it could be a valid approach to not play anything at all in an open decklist tournament against mechathun druid.
---
It probably can be.
---
Six minions (auctoneer, acolyte of pain, pyromancer), six removal spells that target only minions (nauralize, spellstone, wrath), plus two buff spells (barkskin, earthen scales)
---
If they have one removal spell left at the end, or one minion they can't kill, they lose.
---
Definitely possible to line everything up, though
---
fuck stevie wonder
---
Impossible, no.  Harder, yes.  You need the time, experience, and patience to test a deck and not everyone does. (so they netdeck).   Ladder is using the best decks to win and not always the funnest.  
---
You need to derive enough joy in building, and winning, with your own deck to offset the likely disadvantage you will have versus most meta decks that have been refined.

---
Wow dude. Your honesty is brutal. I see a lot of my own traits in what you describe. I‚Äôve been addicted to games before, way back around 2008 I was just like you except with Diablo 2 LoD. I ran a boss killing bot every day before work (never got banned though, god that would hurt so much). The satisfaction at first was so great but then, just like you, the wealth accumulation just became a tedious boring second job. 
---
Right now I don‚Äôt play Hearthstone a lot because ranked mode makes me anxious. I play my 5 wins each month then fiddle in casual. Part of the reason is that I started playing last fall right before the rank 50 ladder. I don‚Äôt have very many cards from Mammoth sets. All the OP stuff is mammoth. 
---
I‚Äôm telling myself that once mammoth rotates I will be on a more level playing field. And maybe I won‚Äôt be so anxious about ranked. 
---
Sorry to see you go man but you have to keep your sanity. 
---
The problem with leviathan is that any of those archetypes suffer the same issue. If you draw leviathan, it's very often that you're just going to die to the draw effect through iceblock. Dying is worse than having a dead draw.
---
That's how it's going to be for the most part sadly. A lot of control decks don't really stand a chance against Malygos Rogue either. Combo is a necessary archetype to prevent control dominant meta I think. Of course it could be less polarizing, but this sub really hates on anything that kills control.
---
Now, I don't think 90-10 split is a good thing, and might need some addressing, but then again cataclysm is rotating anyway.
---
I have close games, meaningful decisions, and enjoy playing the game against combo. Combo actually has more decisions per term than your typical tempo deck. Trying to bate out board clears and whatnot can be a fun strategy. Getting faced by aggro isn't ever fun for me, but that's just my opinion.
---
Yeah, I think that's correct, and I'm perpetually at rank floors as well given win/loss streaks. It's a strange dynamic - I appreciate that losing doesn't sting as bad and it's nice to see your rank skyrocket when you're on a tear, but it does seem like it shoots you up into unrecognizable metas if you're doing well, and when you lose, you end up at a rank floor where the funky-ass decks are played. Very odd. So to speak. 
---
The difference I guess is that at your rank, variety seems viable. I'm not sure why but at 15 and below, gimmick decks carry hard. 
---
My post with the most downvotes has 2... that's you and what... OP?
---
I dislike the experience, win or lose, against aggro. Actually no that's not true I like beating aggro.
---
Cool story?
---
Ok first of all attitude.
---
Secondly you can either choose when it comes to card games like this:
---
A. You will have winning and losing matchups. Including matchups that you are very unlikely to win/lose like the 10 percent each shown here with Tempo Mage and Odd Warrior.
---
B. Give up on Deck Identity. This means that every different deck archetype feels different to play. If you give up on Deck Identity you will have less occurence and severity in winning/losing matchups. But the closer you get to completely giving it up every deck will feel like the same gray blob.
---
If you want card games that don't have deck identity then go play Texas Hold'em. Deckbuilding card games like HS, Yugioh or Magic literally make no sense without it and it has always been part of these games.
---
I don't think the combo half is the biggest problem here. But of course you can fix it. You can have combo/anti-control without having infinite damage combo.
---
Dat beastie bloke is a right special case ‚Äòe is.  I havnae seen a right strong fella like ‚Äòem dats bof mighty powerful and deservin‚Äô o‚Äô da title before.

Ok, I'll make it easy for you, the point was: the F2P models are not healthy for me. I don't like feeling pressured to play or pay. From now on I'll only play games that allow me to take a break without missing on stuff.
---
And come on, take a chill pill, eat a Snickers.
---
&gt;Its objectively less decision making
---
I'm sorry but this is simply ignorant. C o has tons of decision making. You are trying to maximize your resources at all times, trying to maximize the effectiveness of your board clears taunts and heals to survive into your combo. 
---
Tempo decks are what really lack decision making because they always do the same thing -- dire mole on one, dagger on two, henchclan on three .... Every. Single. Game.

DAE le gem?
---
Honestly I find myself feeling the same way, I just log in daily on my 2 accounts to complete daily quests to get gold for the next expansion or open a copule of packs. It feels less like having fun and more like obligatory daily login.
---
Having said that I still pre-order packs and buy holiday bundles. I am also excited for new expansions and every little announcement blizzard makes for HS. 
---
My opinion is that i‚Äôve alredy spent a good amount of money on the game so it‚Äôs har to just walk away and let it go to waste. If i spend a little more i keep the game relevant and the loop goes on.
---
Yup. An accumulative +2 in this topic. Far worse than the millennial shaming people sitting at -16 that I ridiculed. Good input. 
---
If that brings you financial stability and lets you do other things i am sure you will enjoy it, same way i do. My job is very monotonous yet allows me to pay my college and go to the gym, should i be unhappy?
---
i'm still sitting on an arena deck with MCT in it.

PS... if this looks like a tantrum to you, I think you might be a little sensitive. Just an observation. 
---
If you're confident about your model, I would try tuning the hyperparameters a little bit.
---
You should expect that as you continue to train your model, as long as it has enough modeling capacity (neurons / depth / etc ...), your training accuracy should reach 100%. What this graph is telling me is either (a) you're not training your model long enough, or (b) it's under-fitting the data because it doesn't have enough parameters / capacity.
---
TensorFlow is nice because of the Keras integration, but IMO I find PyTorch much easier to use! Best of luck though :)
---
In cases like odd warrior or mechathun decks this is a choice you make. Those type of decks are per definition super polarized.
---
Supercollider is infuriating to play against
---
Seems legit, thanks.

**WE CANT ALL PLAY BINGO WITH THE SAME CARD**
---
in general i agree that consistency is an important trait in successful people in general but there are inconsistent streamers who are successful. 
---
i.e. Dog , who is my other favorite HS streamer (besides Thijs) rarely has a set schedule and kinda plays when and as much as he feels like. He'll go 12+ if hes really into something like autochess. At the same time , he'll say, I may or may not stream tomorrow.  Whereas Thjis starts/ ends his streams the same time everyday. 
---
did they say anything in regards to unlocking Arthas?
---
alcolitoz#1785  , trading 80g on NA, ill show u go first.

Well, i think there\`s a little difference between being happy with your job and being happy about the stuff that earns your job? Just because i earn tons of money at work, which enables me to buy everything i want to make me happy, doesn\`t mean i have to be happy with my job. 
---
So, if you\`re looking at Thjis in this context, it really looks like he\`s enjoying his job independent of his earnings. 
---
Quest rogue or mthun Warlock are definitely not as polarizing as pure odd Warrior decks that basically insta Win vs aggro and insta-lose vs combo
---
It get's more obvious how bad of a deal it is once you consider the % per rarity: You get 3.8 legendaries is ~17% of all legendaries for the preorder. 
---
People hated MC Tech because it can randomly decide the match depending on what it stole, and Fledgling because if it got lucky with what adaptations you got when it hit face for the first couple of times, it could become impossible for the opponent to remove it.
---
Sounds like a good strat, think I‚Äôll try this out. *gets the darkness as final boss*
---
Even if you have two 1-drops. It is still better to play a 1 drop on turn 1. The reason being, you get to attack next turn, which is so important to getting tempo in the game since you can control how the minions will trade. The only reason to save it is if your opponent is going first and already has a 1-drop to kill yours. You really shouldn't worry about mage ping on turn 1. If you go first and play a 1 mana murloc and they coin hero power to kill it, that's actually good for you. They still haven't developed their board at all, and you can still make proactive plays since you still have the tempo.
---
You are also using your mana more efficiently, and you have a chance to draw another early drop at the start of your next turn. 
---
The time to hold murlocs is in the later game where you can play more together and buff them up. But that is not the case for turn 1, which is what I was talking about.
---
Also, "combo decks" refer to decks that use a specific series of cards to kill the opponent (Think Mecha'thun decks, Mind Blast Priest, Quest Mage, Freeze Mage, Togwaggle Druid). The difference is if a combo deck draws their combo, then they can kill their opponent immediately  Murloc decks are board control decks with tribal synergy, but even if you draw all your murlocs and play them together, only 2 murlocs have charge (one of which is wild), so you really have to rely on them surviving a turn, something that real combo decks do not need to do.
---

I've been meaning to make a post like this for awhile after taking [this](https://imgur.com/a/2B3KhB4) picture awhile ago. I've been a player since the beginning and I've never crafted a card during these expansions. The only cards I've ever disenchanted were cards rewarding full refund due to nerfs or changes.

Care to guess what the bolded lines are?
---
Bolded lines are sets where I spent money to boost my collection.
---
I have 87.8% completion of the sets I preordered versus 81.23% of the sets I just used gold.  
---
I get about 212 cards per preorder. I get about 200 cards when I don't preorder. Is 50$ worth 12 cards?  
---
Thinking figuratively about it: 50$ gives you [about] 50 packs. This should give you 2.5 legendaries and 10 epics on average - so it makes sense that the difference is literally 12 cards...(math checks out)

Ah, this really puts things into perspective. 
---
Okay, so what's the petition for? What are you petitioning him to do?
---
The other guys answered perfectly. The only card the hunter had in game was 5/5, empty hand. A 3/4 taunt on the way. The best card he could have, let‚Äôs say, masters call into razormaw and tundra and something irrelevant in this case and wind fury, still the taunt on the way getting one of the attacks and recovering a little bit of life. So no way 14 damage possible that turn.
---
No reason to believe that won't still be possible. After all, you can still buy naxx and get the heroic cardback

Gosh, I really do love Day9.
---
Hey buddy. I get that you're angry that I beat you in an argument 2 days ago, but that's not a reason to stalk me like this. 
---
Please stop, or do you want me to get the mods involved again? 
---
God that dwarf woman is so gorgeous! &lt;3
---
Right, but they lose a lot of elemental cards like kalimos, grumble, firefly, and other important cards like healing rain, volcano, unstable evolution. If shaman isnt good enough now, it's going to take a while before shaman gets of the ground after rotation, probably not next expansion.
---
Yes. You either play them in the same turn, in which case you can order, or you get the effect. It's minor, but almost strictly positive.
---
You‚Äôre easy in my top 5 streamers (across all games). No one else matches your positivity or your love of tea! 
---
If you don't expect a deck when you can view deck play rates, that's no one's fault but yours
---
I hate Mean Streets of Gadgetzan too
---
You are always so kind and nice in the games. You never get salty and you are fun to watch too. Definetely the best hs streamer. Keep up the good work man!
---
Where‚Äôs in the world did you hear that 
---
isn't UI rotating?
---
People are thinking Mecha‚ÄôThun might still be around, but with the loss of Bloodbloom/Cataclysm combo and Ticking Abomination, then the only viable strategies (currently) are the for Warrior and Rogue.
---
Why would they "have to" refund half the dust? The cards are already made. The cards aren't getting changed. They are still as good as the day you crafted them. The only difference would be that you could craft other cards for cheaper. It's a win for all players and I don't see how anyone could feel cheated. Whenever you buy something and it goes on sail the next month you don't go back to the store and tell them they have to give you the difference, so why would anyone expect that out of blizzard.
---
It allowed for easy swings of games relying on luck rather than skill, forcing the opponent to play around it with no detriment to yourself
---
Shaman discover a battlecry card spell
---
What are you talking about and why are you being a dick about it? He never said anything about them being a problem he‚Äôs just pointing out the massive discrepancy between the best and worst matchups. 
---
The aggro pirate rogue? I suggest odd secret mage for easy wins.
---
&gt; My last point is that it's just not a problem.
---
Complete bullshit. It's a problem. Big priest is ridiculous and it needs to be nerfed. Only people who disagree with this are either playing big priest themselves and don't want to lose an advantage or they don't play in wild so they don't understand what's up.
---
Big priest is ridiculous. Way too op. Resurrect and resurrect and resurrect and resurrect and then they have a spellstone! Come on! You probably don't play in wild if you say that big priest is not a problem.
---
It's a huge problem.
---
Any other deck I can play against. But big priest just cheats out way too many stats on the board. Almost impossible to deal with that.
---
TBF, I‚Äôve always felt that freeze shaman was kinda shoehorned in anyway

*Wow look how much better this new card is compared to this joke card.*

Kabal chemist is a tri class card from gadgetzan much like others. You will only get potions from warlock, priest and mage classes. If the creature has treant in the name its a treant. Treant isnt a thing like elemental and murloc.
---
Why?
---

It absolutely needs to be nerfed.

Only people who don't think big priest is a problem are either playing it themselves or they don't play in wild so they have no idea how bad it is to play against it.

Most casual i played is whizbang for quests
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, can‚Äôt wait to get on a more even playing field.

That‚Äôs a good idea actually, are you running like a control priest with a quest variant or something? That seems like a lot of cards just to counter a pretty niche deck, how does it do against other decks?

Class cards are supposed to be stronger than neutral ones, since yknow, only one class can use them.
---
Indeed! Crazy synergy with coin aswell! 
---
i wish there would be more cards with freeze keyword in neutral/shaman, Literally all shaman freeze cards that shaman had access to were the ones released in knights of the frozen throne and 
---
the one basic spell that they gain as they level up and they didn't gain anything more. I don't count the one in gnomes &amp; goblins since that one was behind rng wall.

The cool game you can really enjoy without the bad feelings and microtransactions is Neko Atsume on Android. Try it, IMO you will not be dissapointed :D
---
This is strangely better than the original 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen the list of cards that are being hall of famed, is it just the odd and even cards?
---
I mean you cannot lose to Mecha‚Äôthun if you don‚Äôt play cards... in this situation. Druid Mecha‚Äôthun does run other minions which he should‚Äôve just been a bit more careful about managing so that he couldn‚Äôt have ended up in that position. If he‚Äôs kept any of his small drops and just naturalised that then he would‚Äôve won without trouble the next turn 
---
I think you missunderstand me. 
---
I was talking abiut a szenario wjere the deck or tech is player very little, where it doesn't matter much because the deck/tech doesn't appear often, but it still feels bad when it happens. 
---
. Also i am on your side of the argument
---
The problem is the 71% of the time you do get your combo off, what percent of those games are you a) already dead or b) the opponent has an answer such as psychic scream?
---
Anyway fun analysis and good call on the hemet combo.  It makes for at least a sweet meme deck if nothing else.  Definitely no one will see it coming.
---
Not power creep, can't compare neutral to class cards. 
---
You want to actually close the game before Turn 9. It‚Äôs just a really late game card, by the time you get to that turn, you‚Äôre more often than not out of resources (cats used, Luna too most likely, and even subject 9 and your secrets) and won‚Äôt be able to win a fatigue/control game that late, which is where they shine the most.
---
The regions are separate, unfortunately. If you spectate on EU you'll get the quest reward on EU.
---
You‚Äôd think so but on this particular video the only options were auto generated English and none. I will see if I can find it. It was a tourney iirc.
---
You're a togwawgot!
---
I just want actual treant synergy, not just more cards that make treants. 
---
No a class card can creep over a previous class card, but typically a class card is about 1 mana cheaper than a neutral with the same stats/effect.   
---
  
---
But also power creep doesnt really come in to play if the card being creeped upon was not powerful enough to be played in the first place. In that case its a buff we have to pay for, which is a whole other topic. 
---
Oh god...

I think this is problem all the time but never speak to anyone Who gonna believe me But I see your post So... Sharing ?
---
The Subject 9 list I found to be the beat for Aggro Odd Mage, far less polarizing than the standard list. But it‚Äôs still a match Yo-Yo. 
---
When what you have in hand should get you lethal or you're going to be losing the board soon either way.  Odd Secret is an aggro deck, more accurately an aggro-control decks.  Your hero power/HP modifier cards give you great tools to suppress the opposing board.  Control the board, using your HP to give you an advantage there, and do chip damage (or damage that has no real purpose) to face. But getting the board early and controlling it through the mid-game is what lets your limited burn finish the game.
---
Found a different one with a similar phenomenon. At about 1:40 the auto subtitles nail ‚ÄúWindrunner‚Äù and ‚Äúpolymorph‚Äù but Babbling Book = ‚ÄúBible in book‚Äù and Amnesiac = ‚ÄúMP Jack‚Äù. No one wrote those.
---
I mean, what would be if getting the run paid for with the rewards, a pack, and roughly a pack's worth of dust isn't?
---
Would it be if the common was something like Firefly or Funglemancer instead?

---
You go first
---
Nowadays there are so many different definitions for power creep and what does and doesn't count. Some people require power creep to mean one card is a strict upgrade of another by all metrics. Some people have a definition where even a strict downgrade could be the cause of some power creep. It has reached the point where it's almost not worth arguing because everyone is arguing with a different definition in mind.
---
nope if you played during the time period when koft was standard, you can still play the lich king mode. New players can "buy" the gamemode for $0 in the blizzard store
---
What stops the warlock from killing the Saronite Taskmaster before their Mechathun turn?
---
I must've misread, I thought they meant there's a subreddit that posts things about cards that make you wonder why they exist.
---
what interaction?
---
Rank anxiety is normal, but you are approach it in a way that doesn‚Äôt allow you to improve at the game. At low ranks it is absolutely possible to win with budget decks, and your priority should be to learn as much as possible. 
---
Try building some strong budget decks, and test it out on ladder with the slowest play you can do. Think about everything and learn to ask the right questions when playing and you‚Äôll see results almost immediately. Promise. You‚Äôll rank every couple of days. You‚Äôll get walls and plateaus, but once you overcome the fear once it just gets better and better.

That's... oddly specific for a subreddit but I like it
---
thats what buys you the extra turn to find lethal or topdeck an answer such as counterspell. The idea of it is to buy that extra turn. two of them while the warlock is in fatigue can give you two turns and make them take 6 fatigue damage. Also with most of the deck being gone they will have between 1 and 7 none combo cards to use to remove the minion. two copies can prevent them from removing it completely allowing you to win
---
That's why I was amazed!

My first legendary... and my first 400 dust lul

A combination between hsreplay and vicious syndicate. 
---
Well, google is a humongous company, they probably have a good system for that set up. And the subs are very well done nonetheless
---
Kelecgos gets my vote for high cost spell that everybody complains about
---
same except ive done a 2 class approach. It led me to having about 4 competitive decks for both classes

I used ‚Äúembrace darkness‚Äù on his prophet Velen and after he played ‚Äúvivid nightmare on his Velen.At the start of my turn I got both Velens which let me otk him.sorry if it wasn‚Äôt clear in the video, I was trying to kill him ASAP.

I posted the pure white treants from landscaping and got downvoted

What's up with reddit?

i agree, although i think the turn limit should be increased to something like 120 turns. currently, it‚Äôs possible to draw an otherwise winnable game in long drawn out control games. the 90 turn limit was made with only classic in mind, and not modern cards that can extend a game for a long or near infinite amount of time.

Lifecoach left for Gwent and is kinda their figurehead proplayer now. Amaz plays Autochess, Hauf and Trump still play. Reynad RL stuff (and busy with Tempostorm management I guess), Forsen variety stream.
---
Free tip.  The decks/players are comparatively worse then their Standard counterparts.  Probably easier to hit Rank 10 in Wild with that list then Standard (imo).
---
Plus, you can just play for fun in Wild.  What do you have to lose?  Not your Standard Ranks.

Overwatch.

Also starts rubbing his nipples 
---
He just seems like a really toxic person 
---
Yea making the game seem less pay to play doesn't make any sense.

It was an arena game. At first the rogue got t9 Jaina from Hallucination. Then they got Hir'eek from one Weaponized Pinata. I couldn't clear all the copies so he used Splintergraft from another Pinata on one of the 1/1 Hir'eeks. Then the attached pic happened.
---
oh i see, well thats not actually a new interaction or anything, if a minion has a debuff and you copy it its still gonna have that debuff.
---
2048 dust, 1.7 legendaries and 4.6 epics are easily worth more than the $30(?) difference between the 50 and 80 pack pre-order. You are effectively getting 6.6k worth of dust for $30, which is pretty unbeatable (and this is at the tail end of marginal returns - the first $50 ARE better value, but $30 gets you a pretty good deal).

Really? Thanks, might try it tomorrow.
---
My only issue is that they should make a change on how people are getting cards though. Took me a year to make a semi functioning deck with the limited cards that I had and 2 months to actually enjoy the game. 
---
I've heard rumors that they are adding in a suprise patch for next week that we undo the jaina nerfs.
---
What do you mean about asking the right questions. Thanks for the kindness btw
