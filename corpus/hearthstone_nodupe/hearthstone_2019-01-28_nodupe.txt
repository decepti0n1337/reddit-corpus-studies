&gt;for 4 years this game has been balanced with each of the 9 classes having an independent identity
---

---
Tell that to Druid.  Its identity was the "do everything" class, now it's the "do nothing" class.
---
---
---
Jaxx is almost always in at least a middle tier bucket when I see him. Mill house is bottom tier. 
---
In addition:
---
*Hearthstone is also a mobile game, so it is accessible to a larger audience, and playable anywhere you have a connection. 
---
*WoW is a subscription service to experience the content (after the initial free play period). Hearthstone's new content is freely available and built around an F2P model, pay when/if if you want, and have that content playable as long as hearthstone is in service.
---
I realise you gotta click the link
---
You can see the 2 screams on the history bar. 
---
And yes one of random spells killed one of his wolves.
---
Maybe I am an evil priest player (wizbang btw.), but I am not telling lies
---
Keyloh#1103 NA Trading 80g. You go first
---
Its wizbang sry
---
hmm man ur boring asf no entertaiment at all
---
Rogue* 
---
Not a great take. A Fire Fly is great at turn 1, not so much turn 8.
---
It'd be cool in arena though you gotta admit it 
---
you were pretty lucky with the order. otherwise you would have faced 7 wolves
---
I agree with you OP, I think tri-class is one of the best mechanics for Hearthstone.
---
We effectively already have tri-class cards anyway.  Subject 9?  Pretty useless outside of Hunter, Pally, and Mage.  Hench-Clan Thug?  Pretty useless outside of weapon classes.  Calling those tri-class wouldn't change them, it would merely be a formality.
---
Tri-class allows team5 to develop more interesting "Neutral" cards, while disallowing them to be used by any class where they might be too abusive.
---
I'd also love to see tri-class spells.  Spells being limited to one class is a bit lame imo, as it heavily limits their play possibilities.
---
16 golden legendary duplicate °°O
---
So you don't play it past turn 7 against priest unless you either can afford it, or desperately need it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Subject 9 hunter and spell hunter have been around quite awhile and no one was complaining about them before Raka to the degree you see people complaining now. And I'm sure their winrates were worse because of druids.
---
Also, you can pick a few classes other than hunter and rewrite the sentence as "\_\_ deck are running \_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_"
---
It's mostly true that reddit and Twitch complains about the most dominant class every meta and proclaim it to be the WOAT meta.
---
I have been playing hunter a lot in the past year, before it became fotm, I don't think hunter's power level spiked heavily with raka. Rather that nerfs took away a counter to hunter.
---
I don't see any reason for a come back player not to be competitive in comparison to a new f2p player. It took me like a year as the 2nd type to comfortably sit at rank 5 every month as i was able to craft 2-3 meta decks by playing gazillions arena games. your dust collection is good for saving until the rotation and probably you can bank up a few thousand gold. I think by then it would be ok for some meta deck already. That is my assumption that you want at least rank 5. legend is a whole different level though. The key is to hold back yourself not to craft anything except Baku Gen Zilliax and essential classic legends like Leeroy, which probably you already have.
---
You would be surprised how often coining this out on 6 is still too slow. Psychic Scream is just Priest Vanish, when you get down to it. It removes the things on the board but it doesn't actually kill anything. What that means is that it's pure Tempo rather than Value like most AOE spells, and only running an actual win condition in your deck makes it a good card. Which Priest has right now, so Scream is a powerful card.
---
I think that, for much of Priest's history, Scream wouldn't have been played. An AOE that actually kills things is just better, even if it's less reliable. It doesn't "fuck your opponent's draws" reliably, only against specific decks that rely on a lot of tokens or on Voidlords.
---
So after looking into what you were saying, I realized that the first turn happened a turn ago from the original photo. What he did was Snapshot the Previous Psychic Scream from the History Bar, and then snapshot the most recent Psychic Scream on the history bar on the same turn.
---
Also the Spellstone Wolf took damage, and the other set of them didn't, so they aren't the same photo.
---
You don't always have the option to trade something off especially at typical gallery priests, and the times you do, it can be a massive tempo loss. "Running the wrong minions" isn't correct because the minions you want change so much throughout the game, you might've lost card draw cards, etc. 
---
Sorry to disappoint you mate, trying my best to improve, I'm still new you know 😅 but thanks for advising me where should I improve 
---
I doubt it. Pre-nerf Mana Wyrm and the Druid spells are just as stupid, better even, in Wild as they were in Standard. Molten Giant, on the other hand, is just a meme card these days.
---
I have, but I'm also a salty aggro player. 
---
I've beat all classes over 10 times each. Let me know if u need tips. 
---
i didnt see the activision reply part of the comment in the notification, i was like WOW  theres players that dont want more content!!!!
---
Legion:
---
Dh: Hunter, Rogue, Druid
---
Army of Light: Warrior, Paladin, Priest
---
Legion: Mage, Shaman, Warlock (duh)
---
This is mind blowing
---
Some people are so damn talented wtf
---
Wait, that’s illegal!
---
Naw bro.
---
This card just wins you the fatigue game after you've already become Guldan and drawn all your cards. It removes the downside of your hero power in the control match up.
---
Warlock has so much removal there is no way they card can't be broken.
---
In Wild my favorite Priest deck uses literally one minion lol
---
Maybe as another class this would be fine, but right now the main way   control warlock loses against other control decks is because they fatigue waaaaaaay faster. 
---
This card would be INSANE in the control vs control match up. 
---
&gt; Again, it's only garbage if your opponent is running garbage.
---
Biggest misconception, I'm not sure how anyone can think like that.
---
Can you name me 3 decks that aren't hurt by psychic scream? Even late game control decks run 2-3 mana shit. 
---
And even if it's not shit minions, it still hurt a lot... The mana you paid for the minions is all going to waste, and you have to pay it again later (or it's a useless draw).
---
how is your cursor so large?
---
so the best big priest deck
---
I can actually imagine 29removal card deck+yogg as a win condition being fun
---
Tenon#11207, i need the spectate a friend quest, I'll help you with the challenge a friend.
---
How can he get upvotes that way though?
---
Yes, and shuffling LKs, Amaras, Jan'alais, Kathrenas, random huge ass zombeasts etc is a million times worse than killing them.
---
Well he hasn't been played in like 2 years.
---
casklord#1787 you show first, im happy to go first
---
So it's a tech card to win one specific type of match up but massively hinders you in all other match ups. And even then it's not a guaranteed win, you need to have also run the enemy out of cards and effectively caused a stalemate.
---
Having a card that keeps you from losing in a specific way isn't terrible, especially considering how niche it is. That specific way only comes up if you're playing a specific match up *and* you've otherwise fought them to a stalemate. I'm not saying it'd be a garbage card to run, I'm just saying that it'd be a tech choice. Including it when you're facing decks other than fatigue/heavy control decks makes it basically a 100% dead card that actively fights against the usefulness of your other cards.
---
"You face Jaraxxus!"
---
"Sure, buddy."
---
(clears throat) "YOU FACE JARAXXUS...!"
---
You have too many 4s not enough 3s.  GL hi-rolling anyways
---
You face DOUBLE JARAXXUS
---
Boomsday meta was far, far worse.  In fact, I wouldn't even complain that much about this meta except that I've been sensitized to it because of how horrible Boomsday was.
---
The entire Boomsday meta was, sit around and wait for Druid to kill you.  That and Odd Pally, which was, kill their minions until they draw Level Up and kill you.  
---
Now we have a meta of Hunter ie "answer their spellstone" (tough, but doable) or Priest ie "rush through their board clears and race their inevitable 20 face damage", with some varied Paladin strategies or other classes mixed in.  Slightly better than before, because at least your board matters somewhat and Priest needs to actually draw boardclears instead of just gaining armor and stalling.  Still not very exciting.
---
I'm just too tired of bad metas to play, even if Rastakhan is better than Boomsday.  It's still bad, and I'm done with it.
---
Art made out of tree. Upvoted.
---
Are people in this thread really assuming the Hunter would have played the second spellstone if Priest didn't clear them?  Why tf would the Hunter do that, they already had lethal on board after one turn of hitting face.
---
My thoughts as a terrible and inconsistent player; I disenchanted Hunter completely to craft Velen and Zereks for this deck (don't have lich king or lyra) and it is the most fun I've ever had playing hearthstone. Definitely not a deck for everyone but I enjoy figuring out on every turn which win condition im going for and how to get there. When you win with this deck it feels so good. That being said, absolutely this deck will die in rotation so weigh that against crafting it. For me, as a terrible rank 12 player, I would say it was worth it. 
---
All cards from Ungoro, Frozen Throne, and Kobolds and Catacombs will become Wild-only, not playable in Standard anymore.
---
So don't buy any packs from Ungoro, Frozen Throne, or Kobolds.
---
I honestly miss what you're doing right now.  When the grand tournament came out I tried ranking up with a homebrew mech-warlock deck that in retrospect was terrible, but I had so much fun.  Every game I would learn something new or something fun would happen.  I remember getting to rank 14 with it and just staring at my screen feeling so accomplished.
---
I miss those days
---
He's worse than several legendaries actually in his bucket (Cho, Darkness, Subject 9).
---
We are only facing 3 different types of opponent, hunter, hunter or warrior
---
We know what our mulligans should be, we know what cards we need to have in hand before turns 4-7. AND we know what you're gonna play.
---
Youll often see a fast player slowdown when their opponent played the unexpected or didnt land their luck curve
---
The prophecy is true. Valve did create the Hearthstone killer!
---
He got Hadronox from Unstable Evolution and proceeded to kill me with my own poison.
---
auto chess feels like the next big thing. and not because it's new. there are lots of new games which pay streamers, made good views one day and die off in the following few days. this is not like it. it spread like crazy with 0 advertisement even tho it's not even a game. it's really great. people always labeled new card games as "hs killer", turns out the killers come from unexpected places. only downside is the games are long and it's not on mobile so, "i got 30 min, lets play a few games" kind of people will not be interested in this at all which i assume a big portion of hs playerbase. a game lasts about 50 minutes if you survive until the end. shorter if you finish midplace tho.
---
MEDDLESOME INSECTS
---
That feeling when other classes are better at Taunt Druid than Druid is.
---
I also have very fond memories of Kel'Thuzad. My first time getting Legend was when early board-centric decks like Zoo and midrange Shaman made up Ranks 5-1.
---
I made a Druid taunt deck that tried to fight for board in the early game using things like Sen'jin and Druid of the Claws. The win condition was essentially sticking one or two beefy taunts with Kel'Thuzad constantly reviving them.
---
Fairly simple strategy, but I was really happy that I was able to build a deck myself to finally get me over the legend hump
---
&gt;  I remember a post BGHing a Undertaker.
---
Well the meme was always that you could BGH an Undertake on curve
---
I feel the same way about prep. Really hope that it'll be HOFed.
---
Thousands without a doubt. That's just duplicates. Not to mention, look at the dust he already has
---
Damn... harsh but true.
---
Permission to use this in the future?
---
Hunter, they seem like a "DAE HATE BRAIN DEAD AGGRO PLAYERS" kinda person. 
---
No one expects the Spanish Inquisition 
---
It's a fan mod as far as I know, but I am no expert on that matter.
---
And? Is it working? This deck looks hella interesting. Are you using Lab recruit to bounce extra Tess into your deck?!
---
5 mana 10/14 not bad
---
The barrier to entry in Hearthstone is far lower for Hearthstone than for WoW seeing as the former does not have a subscription cost.
---
*Valve at the possibility of passing of yet another mod as their original game*: Heavy Breathing
---
Name checks out
---
He's asking for help so that he can enjoy it FFS. 
---
After taking a glance at your post history, I really cannot tell if you're just a bored, lonely shitposter or if you're actually just hot garbage at this game
---
Wait for a mobile version of autochess and then Hearthstone will really take a big hit.
---
Wow. Just... wow. 
---
Not everyone has the mentality of a 5 year old
---
FlyRice#11845 I'll show and you go first.
---
I like sending Excavated Evil into Even Shaman's deck, and have their Murkspark Eel not trigger because they have an odd cost card in their deck.
---
Sent!
---
People will also complain, as people will always experience frustrating things, in no small part due to losing being annoying and all cards not being created equally in terms of power. 
---
It's also *incredibly* hard to make sure all those fun levers and knobs are set appropriately in all the different domains they touch for hundreds of cards across nine classes. It's hard to allow for control and combo and aggro and midrange and jank decks to exist in an environment of reasonable balance, interaction, and matches that aren't too heavily polarized. Too many moving parts. 
---
This is just an underlying framework for understanding those frustrations. 
---
Whizbang is the best deck don’t even @me
---
Haha yes
---
That's exactly why I switched to wild &amp; will remain there until rotation. I'm actually having a semi decent time there. Way more variety than standard at the moment. Standard right now is just Rexxar &amp; OTK decks. I couldn't do it anymore. 
---
I wouldn't say he's quite as good as jarraxus, but millhouse really isn't that bad in arena, and jarraxus is extremely overrated. I could easily see them in the same bucket.
---
Millhouse is going to be playable in the vast majority of games once players are out of resources as pretty much a vanilla 2 mana 4-4. Not great, but not awful. Meanwhile its not unlikely that jarraxus will be completely unplayable the entire run because 9 mana go to 15 hp is a very, very slow turn.
---
I've been playing a lot of wild lately and it hasn't been speaking to me. This is likely because it seems to close to standard. I see Priest decks looking to board clear and resurrect minions, even Shaman, Odd Rogue/Paladin, and Warlocks looking to cheat large demons into play. There's more variety than that, but it just doesn't feel distinctly different enough to make me interested. 
---
That said, I do love having Loatheb there. 
---
Well, what if you discover him in aggro dragon mage... /s
---
Extremely well thought out. As a constant renolock player though, I have to argue that in the wild meta, nothing is quite as satisfying as denying Aggro on that sweet turn 6. I can obviously see how that's frustrating on the other side, as I've been that same aggro player.

---
Especially in a class that is supposed to not really do much for healing, card draw, or AoE all in a 6-mana package. 
---
It's largely the fault of new beasts getting added, and Scalehide is a hell of one. It fucked up the power of Rexxar and Quest Rogue in a big way
---
If they lurks on this sub and sees this... they are going to be very very mad.
---
Also... how did they not see Bloodbloom got discarded XD
---
And in a lot of paladin deck running Thekal
---
Make Zuljin next
---
I agree with a lot of your in depth analysis but I would disagree that amara is like Reno in terms of bad gameplay.    
---
1. She starts in your opening hand, there is no “does my opponent have Reno, if no I win if yes I lose” situation because the quest is always sitting their and is easily trackable.    
---
2. Amara takes work to get, not only do you have to build your deck in a specific way, but play in a specific way. You have to play bad tempo minion after bad tempo minion that largely just generate value for the long term. Because amara suddenly flips you back to full health it finally feels like you can utilize the value given to you by piñatas, loot hoarders, and oracles because your not sitting at a precarious 6 health.    
---
3. Reno could go in any deck. Obviously Reno has the Singleton restriction but him being neutral allowed any class to utilize him, making Reno basically ubiquitous in control especially after gadgetzan and making every control v Afro matchup feel like a coin flip, since amara is a priest card any coin flip degeneracy is lessened since our seeing her every 15-20 games, not every 2.
---
If DK Rexxar gets nerfed does the customer get a refund?
---
I don't even think it's particularly fun the watch at this point, not standard at least. The meta as a whole is essentially OTK, Baku, &amp; Rexxar. Rotation can't come soon enough. 
---
It’s true though. Turning your brain off until the button turns yellow again is a bad idea. 
---
I see Rexxar as the devs thinking "face hunter isn't healthy for the game so let's make control hunter viable. Unfortunately hunter is inherently ill-suited for control, so let's give hunter the most insane control card ever to compensate."
---
Watching it pretty funny but I must confess I would be the world’s largest salt mine if it happened to me
---
well your first problem is grouping player that have different taste and hate in deck as one
---
but originally it was nominative so why would you change it to accusative? wouldn't you keep it nomative, making it "You face Jaraxxi"?
---
At first, I thought the joke was the red roof trim looks like the “ohhh gotttyouuu” hand sign
---
Malygos Rogue is the OTK deck that beats all other OTKs. It’s built like glass though so you basically autolose to any aggro. 
---
How much did you spend? My dream is a golden Renolock or spell hunter deck 
---
I just play toasts hunter hunter, sit at ranked floor and concede to any nonhunter and try to wreck any hunters I find. What’s not to like
---
I totally understand where you are coming from. I hope you are not intrepreting me as someone who is being aggressive here. In all my replies, I have actually just been trying to get insight into how people think about this subject (like when is it ok to complain about the meta). Regardless, about the "roll" with it. I would argue this is blizzards fault. They do very little to foster the community on this reddit, nor do they offer much insight into the game and decisions. Instead they constantly disapoint us. And the meta has been stale for a long time now, just look at how many famous streamers have tapped out. 
---
I think there is a time for criticism, and when it is justified. Given Blizz' track record in the last year (they made a lot of positive changes sure) they have essentially done a lot to wedge a gap between the players and the "mission" of the game. Just look at how many times when they did come on this reddit, it was met with vitriol because they basically had a stance of "we can do no wrong, you are all wrong", or cancelled features, lack of features, etc. 
---
I for one kinda see why this reddit is the way it is. Because it really feels like Blizz has stopped caring. And if you look at all their other IPs, it really gives that impression further.
---
But this is a tad off point. Yes, it is true, people need to stop with "ugh this deck blah blah", but I think when they actually have a point (like the above with "when do OTK stop"), I think it mirrors what many feel. There really is too much OTK, and so they are trying to spark a discussion, just not in the best way. 
---
TLDR - Blizz has done a lot of wrong in the past year, and I think many are just burnt out tired. I can't justify one complaint over another, and there is a lot, but maybe it is just a reflection of feeling like there isn't enough balance happening/staleness of the game.
---
MisterTaters#1782 NA 80g quest trade. You go first please!
---
We have duplicate legendaries. If you own all of them in a certain set you'll get copies
---
But this I think was not a result of balancing Paladin around Call to Arms. This was a card that really was just too OP. It gave you at least 6 mana worth of stats for 5. And as we know, Blizz loves printing really OP 1 and 2 drops. So essentially, you were playing 1 broken card to get 3 broken cards. I think that is more so the problem with Call to Arms. It cheated too much, and just had too much value. Plus it would thin your deck, essentially giving you no bad draws. I think comparing prep to CtA is not a great comparison. One does blatantly too much, while the other only gives a reasonable discount to reasonable spells. So far, aside from fringe cases, there really hasn't been situations where prep could be abused, unlike CtA.
---
Mecha'thun druid does not lose many tools.
---
I don't necessarily think cards which make cards are bad. Nobody complained about Ysera or the Lich King. But the key difference between them and Rexxar is that they are minions who are played on the board, and therefore are interactable. Ysera can give infinite cards, but only if you fail to deal with it. Whereas Rexxar can't be touched at all. The problem isn't getting additional resources from the hero power either, as inspire was praised as a mechanic in TGT. The problem, quite simply, is that the card isn't 'fun and interactive'.
---
Imagine if Rexxar's ability, instead of changing the button itself, summoned a minion with the ability 'inspire: create a custom zombeast'. Even though it'd have additional stats in board presence and every use would grant 2 damage, it might even be a nerf simply because a hunter would have a limited set of turns to utilise the zombeast ability.
---
ThAt BeLoNgS iN A MusEuM!

villain#2630 EU looking for someone to trade 80 gold quest. I can show you mine, but you go first.
---
Surprisingly often they won't have beasts left in their deck since they probably cast play dead on it already. But when you scream they also get the beasts back in the deck.
---
This brawl is also known as: I get my pack and never come back.   
---
It was also weird that you started with only 1 mana instead of 3. That would make the brawl atleast a little beter. 
---
I assume VS is for Vicious Syndicate?  Even just going on their data it's not an all time high, it's been dropping some from the peak it was at a few weeks ago.
---
Not to mention that other classes have hit close to the current hunter numbers over the past while, and, in some cases, exceeded them.  For example, warrior hit 26+% play at one point, which is near the current amount of hunters.  Shaman hit over 30% usage (rivalling and slightly exceeding the peak RR hunter numbers), and druid managed to hit a whopping 40% usage back in KFT, far outstripping hunter's current popularity.
---
Sure, there are a lot of hunters, no one is denying that.  But if you're going to go and say hunter is currently showing an all time high in representation, at least make sure you're right.  And this isn't even the highest amount of hunters we've seen, back in the undertaker hunter days it was 35% or so.
---
Are they all really that bad? People don't use 20 cards out of 200 across all decks across all classes?
---
Many years ago when I was playing Yugioh, I had a similar realization when they banned a card called Gateway of the Six Samurai.
---
The general idea of the deck was to spam monsters from your hand and keep generating these large boards. Normally, your combos would be limited to the 5-6 cards in your hand...  but gateway changed that. It’s effect allowed you to tutor another Six Samurai after you played some, which allowed you to combo even further.
---
After playing the deck and against it, I realized that any card that allowed you to bypass the initial resource was a broken mechanic. It might not be the best (due to how you receive the pay-off), but it has the ability to be busted.
---
Hearthstone is a very different game, but Blizzard makes this mistake almost EVERY expansion. 
---
Naxrammas: Undertaker; it constantly grew bigger for playing cards that you wanted to play anyways.
---
The Grand Tournament: Mysterious Challenger; 11 mana worth of cards on turn 6 with a 6/6? After following a perfect curve of minions that were overstated already, this was massively broken
---
Old Gods: N’Zoth; easily 20-25 mana worth of stats every time you play him
---
Jades, Quests, Desth Knights (Especially Rexxar, Jains, and Guldan), Skull of the Manari, Haydronx, and more. 
---
It makes me question the future health of this game if we can only make massive bombs set after set. 
---
I don't really agree with anything you just said so we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
He attacc
---
He protecc
---
But he also buys pacccccccs so we don't have to.
---
Bad decks 'cause I win those.
---
I never concede against mecha decks in case they messed up and I haven’t paid total attention to what they have and haven’t played.
---
This is Hearthstone. None of that matters. The only thing that matters is whomever rolls the better outcomes from high variance RNG the fastest.
---
What do you care? If they have the money, let them spend it on things they want (even if it is Hearthstone)
---
Having 2x Jaraxxus wouldn't actually be bad if you had strong early game in arena. 
---
Mechathun priest. It's the only Mechathun deck that you can counter if you play right.
---
Yep, one stat is a lot, but BGH is not a vanilla minion.
---
The point is, in the matchups BGH has no target it's serviceable, can be used if you are floating mana / you have no other play.
---
In the ones you get a target is grossly overbudgeted.
---
Although I tend to agree with the overall feeling you have translated into words, I'd also like to have your insight for good examples of decks/cards/interactions.   
---
  
---
What would be considered healthy, according to the points you presented? I ask because it seems the game would become a vanilla fest of classic midrange. Everygame would feel the same, regardless of class. Zoo vs Zoo until the eternity.  
---
Obviously there are terribly unfun things that happened before (Patches, Year of the Shaman, Corridor Creeper, Naga Sea Witch) and currently Barnes in Wild and Rexxar, for example, but overall the game has to evolve and we *need* to feel that we are facing several different strategies. In this regard, the current meta feels - actually - good. You have OTK, you have Control, you have Aggro, Tempo, and even though Midrange fell a little out of the top last year, Mid Hunter, Evenlock and Even Paladin can be very strong.
---
lmfao ok ok you got me there lol 
---
I somewhat disagree. I find the Hearthstone meta quite balanced right now. And imho the Deathknights, Priest Quest or Reno - which OP somewhat criticizes - are a couple of the most inetresting cards in Hearthstone and a large part of why I am still interested in the game. I would lose all intertest if Constructed played like Arena - the cards with power spikes like Deathstalker Rexxar are what makes Hearthstone interesting. And while Deathstalker Rexxar has it's share of stupid RNG it are cards like Ragnaros/Jan'alai or Yogg-Saron that decide games on a coinflip that make the gameplay meaningless, non-interactive and polarizing.
---
Any genius can tell you to buy an iPhone to make screenshots of an iPad!
---
&gt; Deathstalker Rexxar made entirely in salt ~~wood~~.
---
Lol you don't have to play any particular class to hate this card. 
---
It fucks over absolutely every deck with a board centric wincon removing buffs, nullifying deathrattles, and likely bricking your future draws depending on what gets shuffled in. 
---
Scream was bullshit long before the hunter meta emerged and will continue to be bullshit in wild for years to come. 
---
My golden whiz is the reason why I want to own golden spell hunter but thx for the tip anyways 
---
Awsome art
---
i hit a nerve of some people xD
---
you should do a making-of video!

You could always try Midrange Hunter. I can usually hit ranks 10-6 with little effort, the deck is cheap, it requires minimal skill to play, and its quite effective if you're smart. The only part of your argument i didn't get is, how do people throw under rank 20? You literally can't lose rank at that point. 
---
Because when you use your hero powers for the effect you don't have to spend a card. Drawing one is the closest approximation to consider card advantage in the scenario.
---
It's not technically the same because it does not thin your deck but omitting it would not accurately assess the value of the card
---
Both are shit play huntard
---
Did the font always look like that?
---
I feel like the text looks different
---
Yes Paladin.
---
@IksarHS
---
Even pali has been really working for me or odd pali they both are great and pretty cheap
---
Make a hunter deck
---
I miss that time
---
&gt;especially in a class thats not supposed to do much healing or card draw
---
Can you teach me your ways? I guess I'm exaggerating a bit about throwing but it seems that I constantly get matched against player who I shouldn't be matched against. Players who have card backs from year 1, player who have spent a lot of money on the current meta. It's hard when you get one pack per ten wins.

At what rank would you consider a player good
---
Meiqur #1252 NA 80g quest
---
&gt; beefy Beast every turn is to exhaust Control's removal; that's the midrange plan.
---
It depends. The original control Warriors plan were literally "I'm going reach end-game and then play a big monster every turn until something sticks"...
---
Yeah, that would really suck haha, I'll try to hold it for now I guess... 
---
I kind of bounce between Gwent and Hearthstone these days. I like Gwent more but it moves a bit slow due to CDPR being... so-so at updates, but Hearthstone is nice, easy fun. 
---
The problem with the gaming CCG market is they're all super super monetized; by definition they limit the number of people who can get 'good' at them, since card power level will normally trump skill unless the difference in said skill is absolutely massive. I don't have the money spare to build tier 1 Hearthstone decks. Not even remotely. I run into them occasionally while running my silly little Rogue weapon deck and lose guaranteed by turn 5. Not a thing I can do. 
---
But that monetisation ALSO means it's hard to get a healthy marketplace of games, because each one is sucking the money out of its potential players. One must stand, the rest must fall.
---
A little math here. 
---
* Average legendary card received per pack: 1/20
---
* Average epic card received per pack: 1/5
---
* Guaranteed at least one rare card per pack, but this card could be an epic or legendary instead.
---
We see a total of 536 legendaries, meaning an average of 10,720 packs were opened by looking at legendary rarity statistics.  
---
We see a total of 2,302 epics, meaning an average of 11,510 packs were opened by looking at epic rarity statistics.  
---
We see a total of 12,410 rares, meaning an average of 12,410 packs were opened by looking at rare rarity statistics. 
---
By taking the average of these 3 statistics, we can extrapolate an average of 11,547 packs were opened by OP. 
---
# If OP decided to buy packs in bulk by 60 packs for $69,99, we can deduce that OP paid a total amount of $13,469 to obtain this much dust.
---
I didn't take the time to calculate how much packs it takes to get a full set without duplicates, as that's an additional amount of packs that OP has to buy in order to get duplicates in the first place. Hearthstone Wikia says 100 packs equals 75% of all cards obtained...
---
# ... so we could roughly state that OP paid about $14,000 in total for his entire collection.
---
Did the math just because I was curious. Didn't intend anything malicious with it.
---
This game lost all semlance of a competitive skill based game after naxxramus. Warrior and Handlock matches we're the ultimate battle of resource. You needed to save specific cards for certain board states to achieve a win. As a long time warrior lover this game was ruined with all the otk mechanics. Now there are so many combo decks that can also beat aggro that there is no real play for control anymore. The game has become draw as many cards as you can and pray for a win. Not the nuanced play with specific combos that you had to play around. Like druid Savage roar etc.
---
I need only Toki but even the starter deck is so bad, I lost to first boss twice already. The whole concept is rng fiesta, no matter the rewind. 
---
Arena is a nice change of pace but not without its own frustrations. Too many games where I feel like decisions are out of my hands (whether because my draft was poor and my opponent has lots of late game options that were never offered to me, or I play into some unexpected counter that I can’t recover from). I imagine I just need to get better at arena, but that’s an expensive proposition.
---
What legendaries out of curiosity
---
It's actually got around 70 going all the way back to gvg but someones already claimed it
---
Mine's Academic Espionage. 
---
Gain freaking 10 cards that only cost 1 for a measly 4 mana (in a class with prep). As a 'meme card' it's power level is way over the top compared to other meme cards like Deck of Wonders (5 spells only, that player can't even pick when to cast it), Explore Ungoro (extra cost to discover, full price, gheist) and renouce darkness (change whole identity, for 1 mana discount).

Lol that's because I have a golden Stolen Steel, so any card that it discovers will create the golden version of those discovered cards.
---
Agreed. If you're lucky and have 2 or more of them it will pressure them but :
---
A) that's very unlikely
---
B) your deck had lost its identity since its full of Tech cards.
---
C) you will obviously from then on only run into Hunters \^\_\^
---
My ign was cocknchode for a while becauae of my sheer dedication to spell hunter back then. Now im disappointed in the way its turned out

Wow! Cool! Opening packs! 
---
Please just put them down and film that way. No I've likes the glare on the cards with these creepy site turns you do
---
You just pulled a generalist control/combo counter and want to throw it away for the deck it consistently beats? No, man, no. Keep farming and open boomsday packs for a shot a m'thun
---
We've been saying that for quite some time.. let's hope this time it's true.
---
The problem is what happened with KoFT, it was a game changing exp (because of the Hero Cards) but then it was so powerful that was hard to compete with that.
---
I have hopes that the new year brings interesting and fun things.
---
&gt;Anduin was pretty clearly made to synergize with Raza, who had never seen play above Tier 3 
---
What? Raza priest was a pretty powerful deck for a while. There were tons of Raza priests in tournaments when it was good. 
---
At the very least, it was good enough to get Raza nerfed.
---
Because the theme of stitching together two animals was more important than balance or class identity.  
---
The deck was pretty shit for a while until it got more support so I wouldn't say it "survived". More like it got resurrected.
---
oh they threw everything at me.   
---
Frozen trap was easy to play around. i drop Mountain Giant , Drake and then either a Sunfury Protector or humunculus. i always use my smaller minions to trigger secrets.   
---
i played another few games about 12 hours later and kept winning against hunter.
---
Yeah they did, they traded with the plated beetle (which is why it's missing 1 health)
---
Its called "Mojomaster".. Mojo is WoW has that appereance.. 
---
I guess you dont played WoW.. but yeah.. thats a flasky thingy..
---
there was also two games where the Hunter had candleshot equipped, so i played Drake first, and he went Hunter's Mark, and candleshot to clear.   
---
Then next round, i dropped Giant. no answer to it .   
---
went face twice in two rounds and the game was mine
---
Damn, I knew I missed something.
---
Wasn't specifically referring to this situation, just MCT in general
---
In real life it's pretty awesome, in hearthstone it's a bit of a struggle since I can't get a pirate deck to work, r/niceshamans could be a fun subreddit where they talk about how shamans could be a fun class if they nerfed hunter or whatever class they're complaining about this week
---
I used to be a large wild player. Played small tournaments a lot. My whole thing was I was the Reno hunter guy. I would often advance in events specifically because of that deck.
---
Rexxar invalidates the entire concept. Because now you just draw Rexxar and build beasts and everything else is kinda useless.... So why not have 2 copies of things and why not just draw Rexxar faster?
---
So it's Rexxar.deck. And while I loved dk Rexxar... It's done for me. My Reno hunter days are over. 
---
How long can this go on?
---
Man the only card game that isn’t dead for me is Shadowverse, it’s actually pretty diverse and not that stale, also has a lot more moving parts 
---
Hi, I recommend this article about rotating cards : 
---
https://thegamehaus.com/card-rotation-analysis-mage/2019/01/23/
---
There is a similar one for all classes I think. It points out core cards that will rotate, so naturally you'll want to avoid decks built around those.
---
I don't play mage so I don't have more specific advice.
---
Hearthstone has been on a downward slope of crazy powercreeping for a long time now. Knights and The Witchwood did some crazy shit. Cards like The Lich King, Deathstalker Rexxar, Shudderwock, etc just completely shook the entire game. I think after Shudderwock royally pissed everyone off they realized they needed to calm down, but the problem is that the meta isn't changing without stupid broken cards lile that. Most heavily played cards right now are from Un'Goro, Knights, and Witchwood, the last three expansions only have a few relevant cards. Witchwood isn't leaving though so we're gonna have to hear "I will silence their screams" at the beginning of every game until 2020.

It's important to get familiar with how it all works so you can buy the best packs and build your collection right
---
will do
---
For the record it says Amethyst spellstone so you know it's the 5 damage version
---
It's the fact that Rogue is designed around cheating mana. Therefore their spells usually are over costed and minions understated. They still lack healing, as they always have, but sacrifice much more for what they gain in a lot of matchups. 
---
Warlock isnt designed around cheating mana, and they have far better supporting cards than Rogue does when you look at the healing, removal, and minions. Warlock should never have been able to cheat 9 mana minions out or 15 damage on turn 6 while also having healing, early game removal and a massive late game finisher. KnC broke the game because all the sudden, the only class with the ability to run "Big" decks were Druid. Then we had Big Warrior, Big Mage, Recruit Hunter, and Cubelock. 
---
That's what PC does now, take 1 sentence out of context and present it as hate speech, but I agree it's easier for sponsors to just remove a player then risk a drama. 
---
I'm just buying all classic packs now and waiting for the new rotation
---
Excellent craftsmanship! I know I'm just an internet rando, but I'm crazy-impressed with your woodworking and finishing skills. You seem like the kind of guy I'd want to sit down and "talk tools" with. I'm more of a metal fab guy, and wood is a foreign language to me. TOO COOL!

---
Odd rogue is techable against and big priest is just a highroll deck that is fairly possible to win against even with barnes on curve. Even shaman is just stupid because there’s little tech against them and they make up 15-20% of the meta.
---
or maybe you'll get a realy good 2 drop on turn 1 and a hand full of 7 mana cards
---
Nah, I just think people genuinely hated this brawl... I sure did, since we've had it about a metric gajillion of times before, and it's basically the same as any other random brawl.
---
Good point, I'm not too familiar with how Scharmützel is actually used, maybe that has something to do with why I perceive it as less serious since by itself it's a pretty funny sounding word. 
---
You can make a large number of decks based on malygos, ysera is good in odd warrior but that require too many other legendaries, malygos rogue for example only need the malygos legendary to work, to look at some malygos decks go to hsreplay website and you can search for the top malygos decks.
---
It's a normal card for OTK priest and other OTK decks. 
---

---
Congrats! I'm not even going to leave the snarky \*Equality/Consecrate\* response, though with a Pally hand that full, I have to ask, how'd the match turn out?
---
Back in those days they were in a weird undefined state that was functionally both Standard *and* Wild.
---
Did the game mode only include Basic, Classic, and the most recent two calendar years of content? Yes, so it was functionally Standard.  
---
Did the game mode include *all* currently released content? Yes, so it was functionally Wild.
---
Yes, the terms "Standard" and "Wild" weren't used yet but that's because at the time there was no reason to distinguish between the two. Nowadays it's perfectly fine to say that Mad Scientist left Standard. "Standard" was defined specifically so that cards like Mad Scientist could leave it.
---
Whatever you do do not dust that Maly. High chance the card will be Hall of Famed in 2 months and you'll get 3200 dust for it.
---
[U know it \^\^](https://imgur.com/a/jvH0hWJ)
---
Currently, the newest sets 13th most played card is "time out" and is in 4.5% of decks.  122 of those cards see less play.  
---
Of course it depends on how narrowly you define things, but the vast majority of cards in any set never see any competitive play.  
---
Zihi is awesome against Hunter if you can build a board
---
Almost basically an insta win against any Mechathun deck, OTK Paladin, and OTK Priest, which are usually pretty rough matchups because Midrange decks take relatively too long to set up threats.
---
Very good vs Gallery Priest because you lock out Gallery/Spellstone combos and limit Servitude burst; good in general vs Priest to avoid Scream/Anduin.
---
Locks out major DK swing turns: Guldan, Zuljin, Jaina are good examples.
---
Either way a symmetric effect like Zihi is beneficial for you because you get to choose when you want the disruption to transpire, and you play it when you think the loss of mana crystals devastates your opponent more than it does for you.
---
That's why I think usually Zihi is played post-Gul'dan or LK or what have you.
---
Right now for me the meta is very Priest/Paladin/Hunter heavy so it's good for the first 2 while for Hunter has its use in locking out Zuljin. Aggro is uncommon, so it's usually not a dead card, but if you face too much Midrange then you can switch it out. But given how common combo decks are right now Zihi is a pretty good card in Evenlock. 
---
For example, here is a deck of an Evenlock with Zihi; you can see that its drawn/played WR are pretty good. It's not a useless card for sure. https://hsreplay.net/decks/GJqhC3IWtXzHRTVYP79zmb/
---
I keep every card until I have duplicates. You never know when that meta is gonna shift. 
---
I even keep wilds. You never know when wild is gonna be mainstream. Lol.

This for right now.  I'm mostly going off of what I've needed to craft from each set to have the best netdeck for each class.  Most sets introduce very few cards that see play.
---
No, you should discuss topics that are relevant to the *thread*, regardless of who posted in it.

Yes. It’s a classic class legendary, chances it will ever leave standard are slim.

Always keep em

Keep it. The classic class legendaries always seem to find a meta eventually. 
---
Just started playing a week or so ago, so I dont know very much about this game yet. But what is wild?
---
good job.
---
&gt; Funny thing is the deck's one dimensional playstyle was also its main weakness.
---
I honestly forget, how did players capitalize on that weakness?
---
I'd keep, unless you're really hurting for dust. It may seem niche, but until you get a few more that you definitely want from the classic set, dusting can turn to getting it again. Case in point, I dusted my Millhouse, only to pull him again 3 packs later...so, yeah, now I have Millhouse until I finish the set, I'm not risking that again.
---
Which is true, and easily verifiable by anyone in a 5 minutes internet search.
---
The truth being unacceptable to speak of is a recent thing.
---
I've seen people call Jaina and Valeera guys too. I guess male is just the default gender?
---
i don't know when was the last time you played but i am glad that nowadays a 1 mana 1/3 with no card text is the standard turn 1 aggro drop compared to all the crazy shit in the past.

Do you often end up running out of cards quickly?
---
Zihi gives Evenlock more time to beat combo decks. It is actually the most capable deck of using Zihi, because it has a number of powerful low-mana plays in Mountain Giant, Twilight Drake, and Hooked Reaver.
---
This game has many many flaws in it it used to be fun when it was standardized but now has become a pile of garbage. Here are a few flaws in the game. SAP card specifically says " Return an enemy minion back to its owner's hand". Well, why is it I only get 1 minion back from a buff and the other disappears? The cards of "RANDOM" destruction. ie: Destroy 2 random enemy minions, Hunter card, If I only have 2 minions on the board they can no longer be "RANDOM" there must be at least 3 to select from to destroy 2 "RANDOM". the mage has a card to destroy a "RANDOM" enemy minion, If I have 1 minion on the board that can not be targeted by spells and hero powers it can't be random because it is the only one on the board,  There needs to be at least 2 minions for it to destroy 1 at random and many such moronities in this game. Why play a game where the cards do not do what they say?  Not to mention how ridiculous the cards have gotten ie: Cards that say destroy everything on the board give your hero 100 health and permanent immunity, fill the board with undefeatable minions and such nonsensical garbage. The game simply sucks!
---
It's pretty good to delay Zul'jin, a board clear like Psychic Scream, and it is an auto-win against some combo decks like Hakkar-Togwaggle Druid.
---
Control Hunter is really fun (Dire Frenzy on Vicious Scalehide being the win-con), but Rexxar is usually not a control card.
---
That and the "I/They were drunk" defense is also mind-boggling. I have been all levels of drunk, and never once did it even cross my mind that I should go and molest someone.
---
However, I do think there is a line between ignorance and hatred/bigotry, and some people who are ignorant don't deserve some of the punishments social justice brings down upon them. 
---

1. Facts are not hate speech. If you look at any scientific data, at the very end of the curve there are much more intelligent men than women. Don't let facts get in the way of your feelings.
---
2. How do you know it wasn't in "good faith"? You're drawing conclusions because **you** don't like the topic being discussed. He insulted both men and women in his conversation. "There are many more stupid men than women" was the first thing he said, and "There are many more male geniuses than women" was the second thing he said. The latter is a scientifically proven fact. If we're going to ban people for unpleasant facts, just because **you** find the dialogue uncomfortable - then you're becoming the thought police. If we're going to start censoring content and preventing someone from playing in a tournament just because you don't like the factual dialogue being discussed, then you're engaging in fear-mongering tactics to everyone else paying attention to what's happening.

How can you make a card that costs 7 or 8 golden with valeera?

But you're still the aggro deck in every case, except against aggro where midrange typically takes on the control role anyway.  Against Priest, against Warrior, against Druid, even against Mage, it's still on you to be proactive and win the game before their strategy fully unfolds.
---
Evenlock plays aoe, healing, and card draw, but it is still very much a midrange deck, not control.
---
One more dmg on face :o
---
The strength of Rexxar has almost nothing to do with how early it gets played.  The vast majority of the time, you don't want to be playing it on T6.
---
Nerfing the mana cost would weaken Hunters already horrible matchup against Paladin, and maybe weaken it against Odd Warrior slightly.  But otherwise, it doesn't really change the issues with Rexxar at all.
---
It was naxxramas before that, and blackrock mountain had it's cancerous cards... It's always been a game of power creep, which is why rotations are so good for the game.

Hello :), i saw your other comment below my post comments and wanted to add a few things.   
---
&gt; he was saying 'men tend to be both smarter and more stupid than women' which isn't sexist. 
---
This thesis is unfortunately already "ideologically" charged and still abused in such a way (even though it seems logically forced, a lot of sexists use this "data" as "proof" that males are superior, which doesn't make sense to you or me, but humans can rationalise such data in many ways.  
---
Here a wiki quote:
---
"The variability hypothesis originated in the early nineteenth century with [Johann Meckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Meckel),  who argued that males have a greater range of ability than females,  especially in intelligence. In other words, he believed that most  geniuses and most mentally impaired people are men. Because he  considered males to be the "superior animal," Meckel concluded that  females' lack of variation was **a sign of inferiority "**   
---
( extreme example: if youe quote a page from hitlers "mein kampf" to support your political position you need to have a really good reason to do that and i would advise you to contextualise your statement." or at least you can't be suprised if people understand it the wrong way) 
---
To be clear, i don't say "because this thesis **is** ideologically charged we cannot talk about it in a reasonable manner, or everyone who talks about it in this way is sexist. But it changes the context and makes it somewhat reasonable to demand that people distance themselves from the politically charged aspect of this statement. (Streams are an interesting example for "public place" which obviously impacts the perception of "responsibility" in this circumstance and i don't want to judge about that here i am just describing different reasonable approaches to this situation.)    
---
and there are actually multiple different questions we need to answer here: 
---
1. Can we know that this statement was meant in a sexist way, or that he is actively sexist himself, or that he is aware of the potential sexist implications of his intuitive interpretation and delivery of this premise. 
---
2. And secondly, is it reasonable to ban him. And i think these are completely independent questions. Proving intentions is extremely hard to do and we developed a court system with many checks and balances around this problem.  But how can the public discourse functionally deal with such situations.   
---
while i am strongly for "innocent until proven guilty" this is not a practical stance to take in everyday life. You can often not prove someones guilt beyond "any reasonable doubt", especially in cases of speech and intention, but you can still make a reasonable contextual estimation about this persons intentions.

3. based on this estimate you should not be able to jail someone, but i think it is very reasonable to be allowed not to invite someone to your birthday party even though he said "it was just a prank bro" when he did something shitty. Or said "it was just a joke" when he said something horrible to you that was clearly intentional (to you and the people around you) . This is a huge topic, but Proving guilt and making moral judgement in an imprefect state of information are completely different things with completely different rules. Even though i personally go far in order to assume the best about a persons intentions and don't want to assument their guilt until i really know. I still need to make functional decisions, and someone who causes harm unintentionally will still impact my behavior towards him even if i don't hate him now.

4. Capitalism. when a company makes an event in order to earn money and advertise their product it is another ballpark to say "you are morally obliged to treat everyone fair and to a high moral standard" when inviting a certain person could damage their brand and counter act their intention for the event. To make money. but this is also another discussion.

&gt; I don't think that a woman would have gotten banned for believing men are less intelligent on average than women,

I Know where you are coming from with this statement, and i think you are correct, but historical and cultural implications are a real thing, and they make a difference, this action doesn't just reflect "double standards" it is not quite  the same situation.

One extreme example: if an afroamerican would call a caucasian person that works for him "slave" for some reason. it would not be the same as the other way around.) does it come across what i meant?   
---
Analysing such situations in a rational and good faith interpretation can pervert the actual content of a situation. On the other hand indiscriminantly projection historical bagage onto the intentions of an individual and judging and insulting this person because of that is also absurd.

There is a blance and its a really complex issue,

When they printed shirvallah they knew holy wrath was a card.

Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
---
Thanks for your reasoned and thought out explanation. Though I still disagree with the ban unless the intent behind the statement was malicious, I do now comprehend the necessity of a format dismissing someone on their roster who holds such contentious and ideologically charged views. 
---
Such high quality posts is the reason why I am still subbed here and it's so sad that it does not get the attention it deserves.
---
Keep up the good stuff, always like your posts! Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

How do you know what prevents designers from creating certain cards ? Only they have designed the upcoming expansions ahead and it's not known to the public.
---
Averaging 4 wins you should more than break even compared to just buying packs. Do your one quest per day and get 3-4 arena wins and you should be able to do a run every day. 7 wins is just to guarantee 150g but you get a pack on top of that so its really a guaranteed 250g in value

heh tyler looks like a triad in his mugshot

I'm thinking about adding leeroy and some more early game to land the fungals on because I've been having some trouble landing good fungals.

I mean, it would make a far less significant difference than one would expect given that nerfing a staple 6-mana card to 8 or 9 mana is a massive nerf.  So, yes, you are technically correct but I think in general it's not targeting the aspect of Rexxar that makes it powerful.

I can relate, whe i was younger i was convinced that pure rationality and truth can help me solve and understand every problem in the world. 
---
As far as i understand it today this is unfortunately impossible. Emotions, base assumptions, **human imprefection** and their narratives/culture. Are fundamental factors to take into account in oder to comprehend and solve problems in this world. 
---
If you are interested in this kind of thing, I would suggest some scientific literature:
---
"Predictably irrational" by dan ariely (and most other books he wrote afterwards.(upsides of irrationality/honest truth about dishonesty) From a behavioral economic/psychological perspectivre
---
"Who is in charge" by michael gazzaniga from a neuropsychological perspective. 
---
"Mistakes were made but not by me" about self deception ; Social psychology
---
If "intuition"in contrast to rationality is interesting to you a classic "gut feelings" by Gerd Gigerenzer. 
---
;Behavioral Cognition.

Also delay’s cloning gallery and Mecha’thun!
