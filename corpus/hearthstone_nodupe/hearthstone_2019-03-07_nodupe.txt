This is by far the worst and poorest thought out brawliseum I've ever encountered.  
---

---
I cannot fathom how the person who came up with this idea didn't join the other 800 people who lost their job.  
---
Brawliseum should be a great opportunity to run wild style brawls - not this nonsense that heavily favors certain decks and classes over others.  
---
Not to mention those that don't have a full collection and aren't lucky enough to be running maly rogue.    
---
I'd prefer any traditional brawl over this anyday - what is worst is it gave me a Rastakhan rumble pack over the usual classic pack.    
---
That should be his tagline.

Deck please!
---
This is not a deckbuilders dream. Try playing it in a day or two after the meta is set and see how good you. 
---
You'll end up trying to counter the meta or just losing to it. That's why people are disliking this brawl. No one thinks it's "too complicated" except for you, apparently. 
---
I don't understand, why would anyone reroll a legendary quest? They got the better rewards.
---
I have a questions : what means AMA ? :o  thanks
---
Any plans to create a new format? Maybe a bridge between standard and wild where certain expansions are rotated in and out like the planned change to arena?
---
(And you play till 12 wins or 3 losses like arena. 150 gold per run for prizes.)
---
LIKE SWATTING LIKE SWATTING INSECTS
---
With the New specialist format being announced, Will we be able to get an in game tournament mode? 
---
The reason is because from what i see is that you want to make tournaments more accessable for players whilst retaining the competitive spirit for hearthstone so it only makes sense If there was an in game tournament mode for players to try the format out for themselves.
---
they're not wrong..

Found it. In the "My Games" section of HDT, there's an Option icon on the upper right. My list of checkboxes is: Ranked, Arena, Brawl, Casual, Friendly, and some others. I had Brawl unchecked, go figure. Thx for pointing me in the right direction.

Recently there's been a lot of progress with the use of Neural Network learning agents (Most recently, Google looked at an agent to play Starcraft 2) in games.
---
What are the team's thoughts on this in the hearthstone digital card space? If Google or another company approached you like they approached Starcraft, would you be as open to it? Do you think such an agent could be used internally for testing cards in the future? Do you think devs - or the community as a whole - could learn from such an exercise?
---
They provided a consistent infusion of easy to earn cards into your card set that helped parasites avoid paying for the game they play while enjoying more of the cards.
---
I'm not sure this was completely worth it with alot of cards rotating out soon, was better to save ur gold dust/till next expansion.
---
anyway good luck!
---
Will we be seeing more interaction from team five during the year of the dragon? For example, Iksar’s tweet and devs in stream chat discussing Baku and Genn with Kibler. I feel like we haven’t had a lot of this openness with the dev team historically.
---
Same. Went 3/3 with rez/combo priest tho, could have been worse. 
---
This: If you don't have baku or genn, dust this bad boy and craft one of them, is basically getting them for free
---
Not another one, we dont need more of them!
---
Are you referring to wurm coin rally or alex?
---
With the recent announcement towards changes in Arena with having rotating card pool as well as introducing the "Old &amp; New" Tavern Brawl from a couple months back, would you consider bringing something similar to Constructed to help encourage variety &amp; ever-changing strategies?
---
I think it'd be cool to have a new Constructed mode where every month utilizes different sets so you have the restrictive-in-nature yet ever-evolving playstyle of Standard, but you can also sometimes pull off crazy combinations thanks to some of Wild's long-forgotten cards (depending on what would be utilized in this hypothetical mode).
---
you did, as did I. Nice karma farming O.P, use your own content.

No it's clearly a kobold
---
Can we expect Hero cards to continue being released with at least one per expansion? I feel like they have been much favoured by the community (my favourite card type surely).
---
I thought the paid expansion was for the first set? Will they be staggering the release of it throughout the year?
---
There is a lot of design potential in asymetric effects like tarcreeper in order to tackle some of hearthstones fundamental "ruleset challenges". Will you explore this design/it's role further in the coming year?  
---
(Bonus: Do you love tarcreeper as much as we do?) 
---
Exactly, I was playin mech'chatun warlock and it was just all abut draw. if i could draw combo i would win at turn 3 and without it, it was a loss
---
Hunting mastiff + anything is such a good build-a-beast.
---
Do you have plans to allow the disenchantment of cards that previously couldn't be e.g. C'thun and Marin?
---
I was wondering the reasoning behind changing up the competitive format. The conquest format just seems like the best format for giving players to build a diverse lineup and rewards players for studying the meta and anticipating what people will bring and making a lineup accordingly. The specialist format seems good for rewarding players who know how to tech their decks correctly, but I have a feeling this will overall lead to less deck diversity in the tournament scene as you can only bring one archetype (meaning you'll have the smaller pool of tier 1 decks players will choose from).
---
So I guess why the change and why now? Is this just a test run or do you plan for now for this to be the format of the future going forward?
---
Why are you running bear shark in a goblin bomb deck? Wouldn't more utility battlecry cards like fungalmancer, bonemare or a brewmaster be way, WAY better?
---
Do you guys own Kripperino accounts?

Cards
---
Any thoughts on a reward that allows players to upgrade a copy of one of their cards to a golden version, whether through consumable or like a yearly anniversary gift to upgrade their most played legendary?
---
I managed to go 8 wins twice and then 4 wins, I stopped while I was ahead. I think I was partially lucky to face some people who either didn't understand the game's mechanics or just brought a regular constructed deck. (Although after a few wins it was definitely obvious people knew what they were doing)
---
I actually made a few mistakes in my decks. In my first deck I included 2 war gears, thinking that like bonemare, you could buff a minion to 5/5, since I didn't realize that the minions become 1/1's the moment they enter your hand. I also think including stormwind champions in my first 2 decks was a mistake. Although the effect of stormwind champion is great, I found that they were often too vulnerable to be played and I tried to make all of my minions high-impact rather than going for complete combos. I often would rather have a youthful brewmaster than a stormwind champions.
---
Any plans to perhaps experiment with a rotating classic set? That could maybe help the game stay fresh between expansions. 
---
Do you think that the new sets of the year of the Dragon are more prominent and dominant than what year of the Raven has been? 
---
I understood that reference.  Close enough anyways - https://clips.twitch.tv/FilthyRamshackleCakeLeeroyJenkins

My opponent played gruul turn 1 into bonemare on gruul + [[Despicable Dreadlord]] on turn 2 (I coined out 2 lost in the jungles)

You just said that pinging 4 doesn’t work? So I figured to just ping 3 so it’d work, right? Or am I just mistaken? If that’s he case  I’ll delete my last comment.

It drives me crazy that they like to talk about not adding other rewards because then people will feel like they have to grind them all, yet the in-game daily earnings are balanced around the fact that people can grind 100 gold a day on wins. Never mind that playing 4+ hours a day isn’t even possible for most people.
---
I think HS did a great job at creating new iconic characters (rafaam, dr.boom, reno to name a few) but Illidan really sells the wow fantasy lore on a lich king level and it always saddens me to see such a character dead in the collection, a life for the purpose of earnig the players 400 dust.. 
---
Q: What is the chance to change iconic cards like Illidan for the better? 
---
Yeah, I do remember fireblood seeing some play.
---
It really annoys me the solo stuff is coming out a month after, because the meta's gonna be solved the first week and everything's going to be the same and boring.
---
Given you specifically said you like OTK decks, i could not suggest this format more to you. Emperor thaurassan should be your first craft, and then you can just go to town with mage, priest, rogue, or even druid and play your own fun otk deck.
---
The biggest difference between standard and wild is that wild does standard better and more powerfully. You like genn warlock? Reno warlock is the same but better in wild. You like cloning gallery priest? Big priest got you covered. You like Baku or genn? The deck ports easily and is strictly better. You like exodia mage? Welcome to your overlords of ice block and emperor making your combo that much better.
---
Unlike standard, it’s also much easier to brew decks here because there are significantly more cards and more broken cards for different archetypes. Things like n’zoth and brann allow you to break things that are normally pretty fair in standard, as well as cards like Kun that are insanely swingy and strong.
---
I’ve been going back and forth between standard and wild for a while, and these things are what, at least for me, make wild a much more fun format, and much more open to innovation and fun. Will there be games were you are high rolled to death? Of course. But there will also be long, fun, interactive games that are much harder to have then in standard. 
---
TL DR: Wild is insanely fun and popular if you don’t mind explosive plays, and especially if you like OTK and insane value decks.
---
Why are Tavern Brawls only 4 days long when they could be week long?
---
decklist please?
---
When Hearthstone was first released, and the quests were introduced, it was relatively easy to obtain the full set of one expansion because only the classic set existed. However, with the addition of multiple expansions in the game, it can feel frustrating for the average f2p player that they can hardly obtain a quarter of every expansion before having to save up for the next one. Are you thinking of adding a better system of earning gold that would reward players more for playing games past their daily quest?
---
Also, many players that do not have the full set of standard cards are unhappy to find out that the weekly tavern brawl requires you to make your own deck with your collection, meaning some meta decks in each tavern brawl would not be available to them. Would you think about allowing all players to access the full standard collection for each brawl, or possibly giving each player a set “mini collection” of a sample of cards from standard or standard + wild that they would have to make their brawl deck out of, a similar change to the one you guys did to arena?
---
I don't understand people saying this would obligate them to play. You don't have to get every possible bit of gold to play the game
---
Its knockoff Akroma, Angel of Wrath.
---
Blizz gives 300 gold for attaining all of the classic set. You can't afford not too.
---
Besides with how op that card is it will get HoFed fa sho!

---
Hey! Been playing the game since GVG and I absolutely adore it. My question is: 
---
**Do you have any specific plans to adjust the way card refunds happen after balance patches** (context following)? 
---
I know the Dean mentioned in the Value Town podcast that there were things like the in-game events and bonus gold quests, but many times that is not enough to keep up with the rising cost of the game. The flame-tongue totem nerf left a very sour taste in many people's mouth because it almost completely invalidated the (very expensive) even shaman deck, which sometimes had 5-6 legendaries and multiple epics, without offering any form of compensation,
---
Given the evolution of Hearthstone since beta and launch, and how we've seen other online TCG and CCGs handle daily quests and rewards, will we ever see a change to how things are currently handled to better reflect the new economy? 
---
Such as more than 10g per every three wins which is a method that does not feel good comparatively and just further promotes over-grinding for less-than-fair rewards. The game is no longer just basic and classic plus one new set, and having to keep up with six sets each rotation while trying to stay competitive is no longer feasible with struggling to earn just a single pack a day. 
---
Likewise, how dust is currently managed. The dramatic drop off on dust returns for disenchanting cards feels terrible and is one of the most common feel-bad experiences in Hearthstone. Updating it to a 2:1 ration instead of 4/5:1 still keeps things balanced, still keeps players needing to buy packs, but clears up a lot of anguish and frustration for your playerbase. 
---
Maybe there could even be a counter for golden cards. There might need to be a dedicated panel for all this in the expansion tab.
---
SleepyShaman#2434 EU 80g trade you go first
---

---

---

---
I thought the Minstrel+Piper draw engine was genius by the way. I considered it when i made my first draft of the deck but also put in more draw minions like Novice Engineer. Novice is definitely too slow and the tutor works wonders. Mossy + Fan is probably the way to go vs Buff Rogue
---
Yes please! It would really help me figure out which pack to buy at the end of the year before packs rotate out.
---
There were 2 Hoggers playable at the same time though, why not two Ashmores?
---
Love it
---
When hearthstone was released cards like Lord jaraxxus,nozdormu and millhouse manastorm where awesome because they translated the characters from warcraft so well into a cardgame setting.Hearthstone did such a good of this everyone started "hearthstone-ifying"characters from other tv shows,movies and games.
---
I feel like hearthstone has done less of this as the game has moved forward as the idea of what a hearthstone card is has been formulated.
---
Can we expect more thematically interesting cards in the future?Like jaraxxus,nozdormu and are golden craftable friend millhouse?
---
There is no live stream scheduled for March 7 to answer these questions. It is also a waste of time for them to answer questions that someone on the team has *already* answered publicly.
---
Well maybe they want to reiterate it incase someone might of missed the original announcement. 
---

---
New expansion season is always exciting, new cards, decks/meta. What is a "successful" expansion for you guys? And how do you feel when just a couple cards from 100+ new cards "make it" to the meta? 
---
It’s ya boi- arrow come right to you with the news 
---
this is the whole point of the brawl :)
---
Getting 7 1/1 (worst possible outcome in this deck) while gaining 5 armour and upgrading your hero power to one of the most OP in the game is still pretty decent I think.
---
Tyrande skin when? You said something would happen in year of the mammoth? Will there be any plans to at least have both sexes for each class?
---
Yes, I understand that the Genn/Baku problem will still exist in Wild, so reverting Genn/Baku related nerfs would be tricky.
---
Because it is in alphabetic order.
---
If you go 60% WR on 6 minute games it takes 5 hours to get 30 wins. Just putting that in perspective. If you are going 55% WR on 10 min games it takes 9 hours to get 30 wins.
---
hmm our game is dying because of metas of nothing but combo decks for a year. let's release a brawl that is only combo decks.
---
I didn’t know I wanted this until I saw this post. Now I’m going to be sad every time someone reposts this idea until ~2023 when the technology is here and new players won’t get confused by it :(
---
Will we ever see a return of mechanics from older sets, like Inspire.
---
Duplicate is specifically for 2 of an identical thing, triplicate for 3... I have no idea what's after that.
---
Hydra is literally the worst possible choice for a zombeast in this brawl... what was he thinking? Its suicide for no advantage.
---
What?
---
I hope if they do it, they do it like what Netease does, release a separate companion app. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/82waft/hearthstone_china_releases_fullfeatured_replay/
---
  It's very neat.
---
Yup, Mecha Jaraxxus is cool and all but a new AAA video game and ~$15 to spend on something else is cooler
---
Beats me. Dragons don't cry.

---
You can record your games with Apples build in recorder. Just open the control center and press the little circle button, then it should start recording.
---
Yep, castle4life. The rest don't even compare. Man I havent seen these cards in eons.
---
Fun fact is that James Rayman created Baku in an act of spite according to u/hadidjahb in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8a0vhe/i_love_the_flavor_of_witchwood_so_far_but_i_would/dx3vfdv/?context=3):
---
&gt;Baku's character didn't actually come from a lore-first angle, but she's got fun stories too. We needed a some art of a giant snake for... some piece, it wasn't Baku because Baku didn't exist yet, and the artist sent back a big ol' python coiled around a tree. And the outsource manager was like "We need a bigger snake than that." **So the artist, feeling saucy, sent back a screw-you bigger-than-a-fucking-village snake.** And we were like "Well, we needed some badass art for Genn's Odd-nemesis," so she got promoted from rando card to legendary.
---
\[Emphasis added.\]
---
It really is a tragedy... Well said, u/Anal-Squirter!
---
Do you think it might be reasonable to revert some of the nerfs to classic and basic cards and HoF them instead? (Thinking of cards like Mana Wyrm and Fiery War axe) 
---
Will there be an implementation of Daily Rewards that includes (gold, dust, standard card packs, wild card packs, arena ticket, alternate hero portraits and old adventures) so that it will serve as an incentive to attract more players to log in to the game everyday?
---
Any current plans of an achievement system?
---
Auto-Squelch when?
---
It would have also been nice if the reward for collecting every classic card was a bit better than just 100g.....
---
That is one big Grunty Boi. Probably the most buffs that guy has ever gotten, so good job!
---
Which is why this game desperately needs more game modes.
---
I would love to see this.
---
Is there any chance that wild cards or sets will ever return to standard for rotation 
---
thanks a lot for the decklist went 12-2 but exchanged faceless for a spirit of the shark. i know combo and all that but getting one or more shark plus minstrel is an easy way to get the other pieces more consistently imho. anyway faced like 90% zoo rogue and i could imagine this will be the same for others the issue and the reason for many close calls is his: zoo rogue uses spirit of the shark + fungalmancer. that shark stays and there is nothing you can do about that, next turn it is then a 27/27 spirit of the shark if you are unlucky. or just giggling and fungal mancer trickerys for a bbunch of 5/5 annoytrons. simply put there is only so much vilespine can do but im unsure what could be changed. however i somehow won against all but one of those by having the combo one turn ahead of death or by topdecking it not sure what a faceless variant would do in terms of consistency. My advice: if you see an enemy rogue (which you will) and they play a minion, any minion, kill it even the chests. unless they are this malfurion rogue they will base their combos off of those next turn. 
---
[Fun and interactive](https://i.imgur.com/RXgqiAv.jpg)
---
This isnt hearthstone circlejerk
---
All quests are in rotating set
---
I'm leaning more in the opposite direction.  I think it'll be difficult to discourage the whales and the regular buyers from doing their normal thing just by seeing these basic numbers.  On the other hand, I think this would do quite a bit to add some drive to players who otherwise hesitate to drop money on packs.  Once they see their progress, they'll be more driven to try to get closer to completing the set. At least that's my guess of how it would work out. 
---
What are your take on different formats? Do you think wild and standard (which gets solved super fast) is enough to keep diversity and varied gameplay?
---
Are we going to get new classic legendaries to replace Ragnaros and Sylvanas soon?
---
Oh I didnt see that, thanks for telling me that
---
what is otk? I think it's fun to play but I'm not sure what cards to pick 
---
wait realy? i swear I was silencing some of my opponents monsters and they were going back to 1/1
---
God, this is actually a really good point.
---
What are you willing to tell us about your plans regarding earning or purchasing older card backs?
---
Maybe some event each month where the reward is 1 random card back from an older season?

Man, I haven't seen the "What is real" guy in forever, almost taught he rotated. 
---
We yet to see. The reveal to villian expansion.
---
Considering that after the year rotation there will be only 3 hero cards, is it safe to assume there are going to be more of them to cover the 6 classes that will be left out without hero cards?
---
Not only that, it also gives you an indication on which pack to buy to get most dustable cards from.

I'm only 1-1 right now, but my win went to fatigue.

---
Hi,
---
The picture you posted over HS blog that summarize all incoming content (like deck builder and 75 bosses) - Is that all coming in first expansion or is it more of a summarize what we can expect over the whole year? 
---
Nothing compared to [the toasters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/After_Dark_Flying_Toasters.png).
---
Wtf I lost all 3 games on either turn 1 or 2. I guess everyone figured out the meta already.
---
This is actually a great marketing hack that Blizzard needs to implement. Would expect a 5-10% pack sales increase just by this, mostly for past expansion sales.. Its a hook - every time people see a sale on wild sets, they will go back and refer to this.
---
A bigger marketing hack would be to increase the rewards ofc like 5 packs per completed set but then its Blizzard...
---
It does not go back to 4/12
---
Have you thought about making a story-driven campaign with heavy rpg elements, global map, more than 10 hours long, dialogue choices, etc. , similar to what the folks at cd project did with throne breaket? 
---
These are the comments I love to see. Just welcoming new people into the game. 
---
What hunter deck are you talking about? I’m assuming cube hunter since it’s by far the most expensive one and in that case, it was a god awful terrible idea since the core cards of that deck are rotating out in a month. 
---
Hi, given that you haved moved Baku and Genn to the wild format, do these cards (or any wild cards for that matter) still come up in design discussiin for new cards?
---
Hi Dean, Mike, Giovanni and Ben. Thank you for doing this AMA here with us, really appreciate this kind of a community interaction. I was wondering if we will we see any of the following changes for Hearthstone this year?
---
- An overhaul of the Dust economy, either via overall reductions in crafting costs, or via increasing disenchantment rewards (primarily for non Golden versions of cards)
---
- A built-in Replay Tracker so that people could load up and observe... Let's say their last 10 or so matches.  Obviously the community has HSReplay, but I think players shouldn't rely on a 3rd party website that could literally disappear tomorrow. Bonus points if we are able to store the replays locally 
---
- An improved Search function in Collection. You guys have already added a lot of filtering options, and the game generally does a good job of finding specific cards, but the problem is... None of the said filters are documented in the game itself. You can only find them if you read the blogpost from like 2 years ago, or visit an unofficial wikia. Something so simple should just be in the game instead of being cryptic.
---
- More graphics quality options in the client. Ever since the dawn of time, Hearthstone only had some very vague presets that don't tell you exactly what they change. I would like if we could actually customize it in detail - framerate, shadows, textures, all that stuff. Either that or make it clearer what each preset actually does instead of just listing "Low / Medium / High / Maximum"
---
- In the blogpost about Year of the Dragon, you guys mentioned rotating card sets for Arena. Do you have any plans of bringing that to Constructed as well? I think the community would really appreciate a refresher of that kind in  addition  to new expansions every few months

- Speaking of Arena, will it see an addition  of a Casual mode where players can study and practice without worrying about an entry fee? I saw some players expressing a concern that people would just spend more time there instead of the main arena before finding a super broken combo, so maybe there should be a limit or how many times a player can start a Casual run per day, or include a cooldown, or just lock them into the drafted deck until they go 0-3. Obviously this mode would not have any rewards at the end of the run
---
- Any planned improvements for the Spectator mode? Forgive me for being blunt, but it's just silly that official Hearthstone tournaments and competitions require essentially two clients to spectate both players in the same match, whether it's a local match or an online one. The game could benefit from something like an Observer mode from StarCraft, since it shows both players and their respective resources at all times 
---
- Will we see Brawls like the Lich King raid from one of the recent Blizzcon events? I  understand there need to be incentives for people to actually visit and use Fireside Gatherings, but other players who just might not have the desire or time or simply no community around are essentially missing out on these unique Brawls. Basically I'm asking for Raids in Hearthstone, and since you guys already have a huge collection of Bosses from past expansions and adventures - it only makes sense to make that a regular thing in the game. Hell it could even be a separate mode altogether to avoid locking people out of traditional Brawls for an entire week.
---
- Will we see more "stuff" for players to do in the game outside of the matches and doing quests? I'm talking more achievements (and being able to track them in game), unlockable alt skins for the Heroes, more exclusive cardbacks for various goals, and so on
---
- And lastly, will the End of Season rewards also see any changes? Don't get me wrong, obviously the point of playing Ladder is to actually climb said ladder, but I personally always felt that the rewards for rank finishes are just... Underwhelming. It's precisely the reason I never even thought of climbing into Legend or close to it, it simply doesn't feel good to play and maintain your rank for an entire MK th only to receive a couple of cards and minor gold and/or dust rewards in addition to the monthly cardbacks 
---
Thanks in advance.

but as it stands they are losing cube, play dead, terrorscale or whatever his name is, kathrena. So the current version is dead for sure
---
God, Togwaggle looks like something out of a Nintendo DS game. Blizzard cutscenes aren't the rocking stuff they used to be.
---
Would require an engine rework
---
Board flood cards and cards which take advantage of that. Scarrab eggs, violet worm, hireek, onyxia, bonemare, fungal, frostwolf warlord.
---
Or OTK decks. One turn kill. Basically stuff with auctioneer and cheap spells for cycle and end with Mechathun or malygos.
---
Really easy to do in this weeks tavern brawl. Really nothing special. Good job on finally winning a game though 
---
The 65% win rate hunter deck, a lot of secrets and has the lich kind card in it.
---
I think they restructured it as follows:
---
- Chris Sigaty - executive producer: Main guy responsible for the game
---
- Mike Donais - Principal Game Designer: Decides where the game should be headed gameplay wise (I think)
---
- (Lead) Game designers such as Peter Whalen, Giovanni Scarpati etc. responsible for expansions and cards
---
- Dean Ayala (Iksar) - Lead balance designer: balance
---
"Oi! That's my cake!"
---
Yeah I will just have to use this deck til I can make my loss back. I’m not a hardcore competitor but I play everyday 5-6 games a day maybe more
---
Are there any plans to make wild packs purchasable with gold?
---
My winged children fill the sky
---
I would pay them happily 
---
you know for the longest time i thought it was 'crush the enemy' but rush makes sense i guess
---
I'm excited that the design team has made a bigger effort towards communicating to the fanbase.  What's your level of awareness when it comes to the Hearthstone community?  Do you follow streamers , related Hearthstone websites, or check Reddit daily to get an idea of the wants/needs/ideas of these outlets to fuel your own discussions about improving the game?
---
That is the question!
---
Hemet just works in this brawl. Keep in mind that hemet only destroys cards of 3 or less. Hemet doesnt destroy Mechathun because its a 10 cost card. It changes to 1 when you draw it. 
---
Having a feature you need to actively look for is quite different to simply showing certain stats. Even if you type "missing" you still don't know exactly how many you have/are missing unless you take time time to count every single card (which you can do anyway without that feature).
---
Not sure if troll or serious... 
---
spirit of the shark in to fungal and bonemare. Consider a ton of draw to get to those cards. 
---
When are you gonna introduce new multiplayer modes eg. tournament mode, 2vs2 mode?
---
When will we see a new class introduced to hearthstone eg. Death Knight, Monk, Demon Hunter?
---
Will we get new Hero Cards, Legendary Weapons, Legendary Spells or Quests Cards in the new year?
---
"Extra" is my favoritt to find golden cards to dust
---
In your "year of the dragon" video you vowed to improve your communication.
---
Can we have a **regular** (monthly, not just before expansions) outlet for this?
---
Things like AMAs, designer insight articles/ videos or even some twitch hangouts or speedpaintings.
---
You're all missing the real reason why reno jackson would be in it. It's the year of the dragon; reno jackson is a dragon. WAKE UP SHEEPLE.
---
Updated with a link to it just now, sorry for not doing it before I was feeling lazy. There was a recent post on here that did a good job explaining it that I’ll link to in a sec, but it’s based on the curator pulling a murloc, beast, and dragon with all those being there except what appears to be a dragon, but could be a dragon in human form
---
When are you going to rework the UI, to accommodate changes, eg. New Game Modes, New Classes, Features etc, better?
---
Spell hunter with Dk Raxxar. I think
---
sex? is that a new card?
---
Looooooooooooooooooooooooool
---
Which new keywords (if any) can we look forward to? Teasers are also welcome answers.
---
Job titles in the Hearthstone team: 
---
What does an Executive Producer do as opposed to Game Director?
---
Are there still plans to have a have a Game Director or will the tasks be done by the respective Directors of each field (Creatice/Technical/Business Director) oven by the Executive Director? Because the Blizzard Job Opening page doesn't list that you are searching for a new Game Director any more.
---
Bonus: The late BB was Game Director but in a January 2018 video he was just credited as "Hearthstone Team" and in February and March 2018 he was not introduced or given a title at all - was that a foreshadowing of his departure?
---
Also since there's several people answering questions, it's technically an **AUA** (Ask Us Anything)
---
(In German that's the sound you make when you get hurt like *Ouch* in English.)
---
Are there concrete plans to ad completion tracking to Rumble Run? Such as making each totem golden once you have won a run with that?
---
If you use HDT or another tracker program, report their tags to hacks@blizzard.com.  You might also still have their battletags in your log files if it was all one session.
---
Hello fellow developers. As a semi-long player, i've come to enjoy hs quite a bit, but as someone who has played mtg for even longer (approaching a decade now), I was wondering if you will be considering of adding more card types, or add mechanics that really allow players to be flexible and have more options during a turn. With the fact that mtg:Arena has been getting alot of attention as of late, it could be some hs players make enjoy some of that complexity within hs as well. Thanks.
---
True, but that just seems so devious, especially when all the other games seem perfectly happy to just tell me how many cards I have. Incompetence is also a reasonable explanation for the state of Hearthstone.
---
We were informed that we will get a special (pack) bundle for upcoming expansion and also a purchasable single-player content.  
---
Can you possibly offer it as just one big bundle?  
---
Hi, about single player, would be cool to see golden cards here, any plans for this? Maybe after completing runs on hard mode or full complete for 1 char., you can choose golden cards from your collection or just simple all cards will be golden.
---
Yes but MTGA model is much better anyway. It would be better that they give gold for first 5 wins and then no gold after that. They could give common cards or dust after.
---
Based on the interaction between Rexxar's Build-A-Beasts with rush, the answer to this one should be "yes". Love the idea behind this!
---
Yogg-Saron is a shit card that was widely hated by the community and I don't ever want to see it unnerfed.
---
you're facing horrible opponents then haha
---
Do that by tracking your pitty timers... 
---
So trying to wrap my head round this if your only after dust craft golden commons and that's it ?
---
Rumpel1408#1121 EU looking for quest trade
---
What kind of socks do you like to wear during the release of a new expansion?
---
Should we expect more "big secrets" in future boards like the volcano and Rastakhan fireworks or is that something you would rather not waste too much time?
---
I mean it's a fun, made up card. I don't think it has to be either of those.
---
Would you consider buffing cards that don't see play? Illidan seems a popular candidate for this.
---
Are you working on any additional play modes?
---
Why would you presume the fortune teller would play a greater role than she did in Old Gods, where she "only" introduced the trailer?
---
And the argument that characters unique to Hearthstone have to be featured more prominently is more than thin
---
It's not even tier 1 anymore.
---
Commons are the only card you craft regardless if you have non-golden copies or not.  It's a special rule.  The rest depends on what you own and if you want more dust or more golden cards.
---
That would be fabulous, but lets face it: Blizz doesn have the balls to do this. 
---
The deck wont work without the AoE removals. 
---
What is your offer for people who buy packs for real money, craft one expensive deck and after few weeks this deck is no longer playable due to card changes Implemented by the developer?
---
Because not it works more less like dust it and make a cheap aggro deck from it or again spend a lot of money for another deck with interesting mechanics. 
---
And this is a developer who is responsible for the quality and balance long before expansions are available.
---
Alright thanks so for maximum dust craft 2x golden copies of everything you can and disenchant the normal ones as you only get dust for max playable cards ?
---

We're literally having an AMA in a few hours and they did state in the Year of the Dragon announcement video that a goal is to be much more active among the community. Let's hope that's really the case.
---
My deck goes to fatigue on t3
---
Have you ever considered adding in a monthly temporary rotation of a few cards from wild to add variety to the meta? It could help solve boredom with the meta and also allow some balance changes on the fly.
---
What happened to Eric Dodds who was Game Director before passing the scepter to BB?
---
What about buying Wild Packs with gold?
---
Link to yesterday's leak?
---
Nice catch
---
Way too slow. I did two runs with Malygos Rogue and three games I won on turn 3.
---
Any plans on buying Wild Packs *in-game*? Without the need to access the store every time?
---
I felt so smart putting in my Fal'Dorei Striders... the spiders they make are 1/1s, I thought it'd be different because it was from a spell...
---
How did you buff it to 5/5
---
Are there any plans to give new cards to big names from wow lore : illadins card is dissapointingly bad for such a spectacular character as an example. I get the heros of warcraft title was dropped but id really love to see the big names around in some way or another.
---
You gotta assert dominance somehow.
---
I did my free run with Maly Rogue too, 9-3. Lost all games because I didnt draw my combo in time before I got overrun by buff decks.
---
Its a hemet discover deck.  Its wicked consistent, but other decks can highroll.
---
Will there be hero cards replacing DKs for all classes?
---
Why are wild packs not available to be bought in-game, be with real money or gold?
---
Why don't you release "The emerald dream" as a expansion? PolyHS is hoping for that before the 2018 rotation...
---
Bow down to the God of Take Candle!
---
You imply that "Tempo" is something that only matters if you play a card on the turn you have exactly enough mana for it. Also you say yourself how it's officialy placed in tier 4. It's widely known that it's just a bad arena card in every way, yet you turn it around and make it "objectively good" based on your experience. That's some confirmation Bias-denial shit. Your personal experience doesn't make it any better than it actually is, which is horrible in arena. 
---
The right question would be: what will happen to whizbang after it rotates to wild?
---
I think this is statistically the best play. I don't know the flow of this game, but I don't think that any other line of play has better than 33% chance of you winning.
---
What are the reasons why seemingly small additions take so long to go in production? 
---
Also does unity start to show signs of weakness because of hearthstones long-time development?
---
Why play casual wild tho?
---
Will we ever see better rewarding quests? 10 gold for 3 wins is just an old concept that doenst even works like a reward anymore, not to mention the 100 gold for completing the classic pack collection...
---
Having my fun with janky Anyfin can happen
---
Not a question: THANK YOU for this week's Brawl, it's the best we've had so far!
---
I think most players *probably* agree with the idea that adding cards that promote unique and different forms of deck building are generally a positive, Genn and Baku just ended up being overkill.
---
Will we still be seeing more cards to encourage different styles of deckbuilding in the future?
---
Personally speaking, I'd honestly love to see something like C'Thun return.
---
List?

Does moving Genn and Baku to Wild early mean that cards are less likely to be outright nerfed in the future? Would it be fair to say that, in moving them in this way, there's a conceit that future sets are likely to see cards that are targeted to address the Wild meta?

Y/M/D is the international standard (though underused, unfortunately)
---
D/M/Y is the most used one, and almost universally understood.
---
D/M or M/D are both reasonably ambiguous, but since they are mostly used in casual circumstances, that's not a problem. (In fact, you can even confuse them with M/Y or Y/M format if you have absolutely not context)
---
M/D/Y is just stupid and should not exist, at least in any official or administrative mater. Just take Y/M/D instead, that's far better and you preserve the M/D convention so peoples don't get too confused.
---
(But unfortunately, stupid conventions tend to stick around longer than what they should, you can just look at the spelling of almost any language to see how much peoples want to keep some conventions that are bad and absurd)
---
So are the other four classes the heroes? Are This villains all hero cards? Who isn't getting one if so
---
pretty sure the percentages would be lower than that with a preorder lol so yeah
---
Would have been worth it yesterday, but now there are too much good decks to garanty good wins imo
---
Why does team 5 only cater to casual players?
---
it saves you from fatigue tho.
---
Right? Lich King would be the next Ragnaros
---
genn and baku can burn in hell.. or wild.. which is basically the same thing if not worse
---
With the recent Hall of Fame announcement and balance changes, the subject of class identity has been mentioned. What is the identity of each class?
---
Will you update the old hero cards and hero power art?
---
Will we ever see the card pools of last year's single player modes updated? 
---
While previously it seemed as though the way they were "updated" was by just getting a new mode, if we'll be moving to Adventures again, it would be nice to be able to play an updated version of the old modes. Even the old Adventures can be played with new decks - it leaves these specific modes in an odd spot among them all.
---
I kind of feel like the community would have been plenty happy if Dungeon Run had just gotten updated with new cards, rewards, and bosses each expansion.
---
Please, let us choose between phone and tablet ui on phones. I have to modify apk file everytime new version release since hs incorrectly identifies my phone as tablet.

Freeze?
---
Accomplished in gambling. This is how they make whales. Nothing wrong with that, just pointing it out. 
---
So the only time this would matter is when you have drawn piper, piper, hemet, bloodbloom and you have less than 5 mana.
---
On turn 4 going second you have 11 mana available to you throughout the game (with coin). 3 mana is required to mechathun and bloodbloom-&gt;cataclysm. 2 mana for pipers (piper draws piper and then mechathun), 1 mana for hemet = 6 mana. We can tap twice with 5 mana.
---
The most cards you can possibly draw going second is 10, the order does matter but I'll ignore it (for example things are a lot sketchier if you draw hemet as the 10th card).
---
So you need to draw 3 cards in 10. Using a hypogeometric calculator, there's a 56% chance of getting at least 1 bloodbloom or piper and a 33% chance to get hemet. All 3 is roughly 10%. If you want to keep any of these on mulligan it roughly adds 7% (working on really long term memory here, could be wrong) to each individual draw which means about 16% of games you get all 3 if you hard mully for them.
---
It happens about once a [good] run, which is probably the difference between a great player and a good player honestly.
---
I don't think secrets affect Mechatun.
---
I also want more free things 
---
Well, imo the year of raven brings a lot of past materials back.
---
We see c'thun makes a comeback as mecha'thun
---
we see dr boom comes back as a warrior hero card, heck mechs came back in boomsday
---
we got upgraded hero power in the form of Baku
---
and a 'tournament' feel with Rasta Rumble (this one is a bit of a stretch, i know)
---
the only one cardbacks not related to these returns is jade lotus. so maybe we'll see more of this? or mechanics from MsoG, like handbuffs (to support the Hireek) or maybee..... maybe even tri-class! blizz mentions about limiting value generating card, so maybe not jade (hopefully not)
---
Will do, thank you
---
I used to think he said "WINCE FOR ME MY COMRADES!"
---
It's tier 4, out of 10, in the Legendary buckets where the buckets above it have cards like Lich King and Deathwing. Dunno what else to tell you, you're just wrong broski
---
We got a new Tavern Brawl with the old and new dragon decks ? 
---
Can you guys create a new cast like monk or demon hunter ?
---
1.	Will there be more hero cards for all 9 classes coming up anytime soon or will it just be one class gets a hero per set for now?
---
2.	Are there any plans for re-introducing Wild adventures in the shop for gold (if someone plays 1 game in Wild mode, for example) 
---
3.	Will you consider moving Whizbang to the classic set or is the alleged new ‘Whizbang-like’ legendary going to replace him after rotations? 
---
If you enjoy a class's playstyle (I like shaman and rogue) then you can focus on their core cards / good legends and make multiple decks for that class.  I don't play RPG games personally.  Shaman has not been bad for so long.  For a long time people called HS "shamanstone" when midrange shaman was their best deck a while ago.  There are plenty of people who main a certain class including top legend players.  Anyway thanks for your reply.  To me it's more about I have a couple classes I like their play style and make most their core cards / decks / legends.  I agree it would be pretty weird to "identify emotionally with a class" as you put it.  But it also is frustrating if you make 3 decks for a class (midrange/evolve shaman, even shaman, combo shaman) and literally all 3 get nerfed, and for your favorite class, there are no competitive decks left.
---
Rough day, huh?
---
I feel that one thing that is missing in the hearthstone client are communities (in the form of chat channels, guilds or whatever)
---
When you don’t have many friends, it can feel lonely playing the game. 
---
Being able to browse/advertise guilds in a specific section of the client  and find something like “pauper only guild looking for members” and then joining them directly from the client in game (thus having the simple hearthstone experience to chat with members and start matches) would be awesome, at least for me
---
So in short, are in game guilds or chat channels or something of the sort being discussed?
---
Togwaggle, Rafaam, Dr. Boom, Jaraxxus, and Lich King. 
---
lol yeah I can relate with odd pally BUT the deck is so good for ranking and getting end of season goals, sometimes you just gotta join the dark side.  Mech hunter in wild is a very cheap deck that is a good way to see if you like the wild meta.  It doesn't really play in a "cheap" style like the standard versions as it doesn't run rexxar or deathrattle synergies.  But yeah I have not thus far been a huge hunter fan myself either.
---
Oh and you should ask if cards from the HoF set becomes playable in the new arenamode they're introducing
---
Good point I did miss that, thats on me
---
THE MANCIENT ONE
---
ohh, I am pretty sure they're are gonna lie and tell some vague bullshit while completely ignoring the real reason that is "money" 
---
Finally my opponents can tell me they had sex with my mom during the match and not after.
---
You get a quest every day.  The quests are often 50 gold for a win.  Do you even play Hearthstone?
---
The technology is finally here!
---
wOW aRen'T YoU oRIgiNal
---
Yes... you could get 100 gold off wins in one day 
---
It just needs better rewards, period.
---
MTGA has sick rewards for one win, several wins that day, several wins that week, etc.  
---
This game has a single daily quest, and then 10g for three wins with a 100g max.  For reference, that means that if I win 30 games, I make enough to buy one pack.  That's an absolutely absurd ratio of play to pack.
---
Maybe during the first year or two when this game was stupidly successful that made sense, but with this game hemmoragghing users and money, it needs to incentivize play.  My GF, who is F2P, constantly complains about lack of cards and how long it takes to build a collection.  She would almost certainly play more if she could get more cards for free.
---
The thing of that is, the more she plays, the more cards she will want.  So even though right now she is F2P, I'm sure it stands to reason that if they could get her playing every day, she would want more and more packs, and ultimately steal my credit card to buy them.
---
It is.  The post even says "Go Wild this weekend".  It's just a promotion for the Wild game mode, not a new expansion teaser.
---
My VOid Contract deck is beast. 
---
Rafaam is also original to Hearthstone, apparently
---
My quetion is a little bit interesting: At the Wispers video, the Fortune Teller shows something about the future expansions. But there is 2 Stormwind Knights, and Stormwind don't participed in any of them. And now there is an eye on the past card. It wants to tell that we have to have a look at the past? (Like the past's expansions will came back?) Than on the present card there is some unbalanced candles and a crown without it's owner... The next expansion is about Kobolds and Stormwind?  Actually it's 2 question XD
---
For instance when I look up the February 2019 season I saw there was an article posted early in February about the card back reward specifically. Also, when do the seasons end? Do they end on the last day of the month? Or is there some rollover period?
---
nice ty :) I will use this in hopes that the opponent does too, just for those odd games where I really want to say gg, well played my dude :)
---
Now that Frozen Throne is rotating out, only a few heroes will have Hero cards in Standard? Will all of the heroes get new Hero cards? If not, it's quite unfair.
---
You can pay with paysafecard if you have android and linked mypaysafecard to your google plau account you can pay via Google Play. 
---
Are there any plans to make a kind of playground mode where players can set their own rules, eg commons only, various tavern brawl modes, certain sets only? Do you feel like matchmaking for a mode like this would be too difficult to implement if it was beyond friends list only?
---
Im having success with elemental shaman. Usually the deck kills at turn 4-5. The deck is not the most consistent but it has lots of different ways to OTK. Most combinations of grumble kalimos blazecaller zola and shudderwock in xour opening hand kkll your opponent. You also have access to earth shock the stongest hardremoval in the brawl.
---
Also always play faceless manipulator. Copying a buffed spirit of the shark can win games on its own
---
ill accept your friend request :) (so few do tho, it is sad)
---
But it's in-app purchases only :/
---
I think the main problem here is that the game takes so long to boot up and load/traverse between each menu. Adding another button that says quickmatch won't change that.
---
I ended up teching in Godfrey. I doesn't really interfare with the combo
---
those abs...ngl godwaggle can get it.
---
I think they rotated doomguard so they can do cool handbuff stuff not so much cheating demons from ha d stuff. We just had like 2 years of that lol
---
They are adding the random cardback so...
---
I think at some point we will receive autosquelch
---
What hunter deck did you get 12-2 with?? And tempo rogue is more busted imo, bonemares, fungals, Alex, are the problem
---
Man, i´m not saying the worst posible scenarios. I mean that you would be able to select on your computer PaysafeCard option. There isn´t many people who likes to do anything hard if it comes to the payment method.
---
Is it possible to get more deck slots soon? I play wild and am constantly deleting decks. It is not possible to have fun decks and competitive decks in both wild and standard with the current system. 
---
My favourite 6/3 minion is Hemet Nesingwary.
---
Why? Becuase I like to make my opponents hate themselves when I kill their big thing with it.
---
The team: Togwaggle, Kazakus, Kel'thuzad, Rafaam and the Fortune Teller is where my money's at.
---
My guesses are
---
* Fortune Teller
---
* King Togwaggle
---
* The Lich King
---
* Prince Malchezar
---
* Some bad guy from TGT or GvG, but not Dr Boom, maybe Nexus-Champion Saraad or Mekgineer Thermaplugg
---
These aren't your Standard decksluts, they are wild and more mature decksluts, all they want is your hard earned dust and it's disgusting
---
Just add on "everything costs one" less for the CLIPS
---
Druid lost its identity during KoFT with all the defensive cards printed, which resulted in nerfing the core of Druid even further. I only played this game for Druid, and played Druid almost exclusively for 2 years in standard and wild. What is the direction for Druid? 
---
In World of Warcraft there’s several tributes and pop culture references, some of which have popped up in hearthstone. As someone who grew up listening to The Prodigy, it was heartbreaking to hear of Keith’s Flint’s passing. Might we see a tribute of sorts in the future in the form of an Elemental 🔥  “Flint Firestarter” 🔥  
---

How will you address the mid season lag in excitement/engagement? It feels like most formats are solved within a month of the release of an expansion and that this more than anything leads to the perception that the game is in decline. On the other hand, many players feel like they are already paying too much for the content that’s released. Are there ways of adjusting old content or (preferably) releasing new content that a) keep the game fresh and b) don’t feel like a cash grab? 
---
Are you planning on keeping the power-level of expansions fairly similar now and not have some sets significantly stronger than others like we saw with the year of the mammoth compared to the year of the raven, or should more powercreep be expected?
---
yep, also thought about it, but Godfrey does increase the amount of cards you need to draw after Hemet - maybe I'll try Hemet in the next run
---
Dragonmaw Scorcher is pretty great.
---
When a minion triggers \[\[Wandering monster\]\] , first the monster is attacked and then it's transformed into a 1/1, so if wandering summons a 2/1, the 1/1 will deal 1 damage to it, and then it will transform to a 1/1
---
Which is bullshit
---
I want someone working at Bliz confitming that this is not bannable. 
---
You're right, that sounds like way too many games a day. Inb4 blizzard decreases the max to 50g daily.

Lich King doesn't seem like the sort of a "small time" villain who would bother with a suicide squad sort of a deal, and we just had an expansion with Dr. Boom so recently that I feel its unlikely that he's in it either. Jaraxxus also doesn't seem like he'd give a shit about such things.  
---
There's also the issue of breaking important lore stuff if Lich King and/or Jaraxxus would be part of the group, but if only Hearthstone-only characters are used then there isn't such an issue.

Would love KT

the fact that people think they’d make a trailer for the arena changes they already announced is preposterous to me

Zero chance. Blizz wouldn't want to risk annoying fundies of various types.

I wonder if anyone would be opposed to having an option to view your last opponent’s deck list with the ability to copy the deck code. Artifact has this on the Victory/Defeat screen.

[[Sunwalker]] would like a word with you

So, we know that there are 5 plotters including The Fortune Teller and King Togwaggle. The 3rd one may be Hagatha.
---
However, what is the purpose of this team? Is it going to include only cards which will be rotated in april/ are alreafy rotated? Are each of these going to get a new card in the next set? Or they are just some PvE heroes / antagonists? What is the meaning of all these teasers?
---
If the 3rd plotter is Hagatha and each plotter is getting a new card, are there going to be 2 Hagathas in standart then?
---
Very exciting and mysterious.

So did C'Thun. It'll be really unlikely if they release a 3rd version imo
---
Nah. We all know communism is bad. But propaganda has convinced some people that socialist policies are the same thing as communism, and also somehow fascism is making a comeback.
---
What you cant see in this screenshot is the fact that she then died while the priest shrine was on the board, adding it to the deck.
---
This would be a semi-big change to the way rewards are doled out in Hearthstone in that it would require you to play every single day to get all of your rewards. 
---
Right now nothing "forces" you to play or win every day. If you miss a day or two your quests will build up so you don't miss a daily quest when you get back to the game. 
---
They did, yeah, but even then those were clearly meant for tauren and just reused for orc shamans. It'd be super weird to associate that with Hagatha.
---
Not enough alliteration for a hearthstone set, it's gotta be Villians of Violet Hold.
---
I think there's no instant gratification in the game. Whenever I earn some gold I have to save it for the next expansion. Can you change the system in a way that we are constantly rewarded with something apart from gold?
---
Zul'jin wasn't marketed at all though.
---
Shes already a card from the last set though
---
to wish cancer to all your family you mean???
---
I'm personally a fan of "Villains of Violet Hold" just for the internal alliteration. 
---
Is saying that Communism is bad really that controversial of an opinion now? I feel like I'm eating the onion by asking this.
---
Do you not play with hsdecktracker?
---
Agree, 10 wins for one pack (not gold, but a pack immediately) would be great.
---
Except you have to have gold to start to even TRY Arena and its so based on luck.
---
thats really shitty of those people :(
---
idk how anyone can feel good about playing maly priest in this mode, it makes me feel bad to steamroll homebrew decks, but when its pay2play id rather go infinite than go 5-3 with a homebrew deck
---
But maybe new in terms of being the new king?
---
Taking the throne from her father 
---
A lot of people are joking about this, but personally I’m glad we now have the option to chat with others through this app. Great job! 
---
Frankly, lack of chat or social features in the game has been one of the more glaring oversights in Hearthstone. Card games are inherently social and personal, but by creating an atmosphere where the ladder is the end-all-be-all of engagement, Blizzard has engendered toxic expectations from its player base. 
---
InB4 people only troll. That’s not endemic to a game, it’s just what happens when a company fails to punish people for harassment. Setting up a no-nonsense policy towards shit talk or harassment would make chat rooms function as positive spaces. Blizzard instead (...and as always) took the easy way out by just preventing chat period. 
---
I just want to posit that 'someone new' doesn't have to mean someone completely new - it can just mean that the cards are now calling another person, having previously called The Fortuneteller herself and King Togwaggle.
---
So yes, it could mean someone we haven't seen before. It could also just mean 'the next person'. I still think Hagatha is the most likely bet.
---
What are your guys’ thoughts on creating a joke set for Hearthstone similar to MTG’s Unglued/Unhinged/Unstable? If so, would it be it’s own event in Tavern Brawls/Arena, similar to the Toki Arena/Rastakhan Tavern Brawl events? Or something bigger than that?
---
I usually like these posts, but cant we have one brawl where deckbuilding is part of the challenge and NOT have netdecks stapled to the front page?
---
You never suspect yourself - the ultimate plot twist.
---
If next villain is Hagatha then i'm confident the last two will be Kazakus and Dr.Boom
---
Sovietism is bad, communism is rad, capitalism is mad
---
I will only elaborate with the numbers 4, 7 and 7
---
Greetings from the Custom Hearthstone side of the web.
---
I must ask why you prefer to make mechanics that work for only one expansion when you could stretch the idea out to work all year in three? I liked how Treant Druid was spread out and wouldn't have minded that for Freeze Shaman as an attempt.
---
I NEEEEEEED IT *spongebob voice*
---
Do you have plans to make more balance changes in between expansions? I think having a meta that lasts for months at a time before a balance change makes the game boring quickly. If we had balance changes every 3-4 weeks, wouldn’t that make it more exciting, and keep players more engaged?
---
When we will get a legendary with totem tribe??
---
Prison of the violet hold??
---
If that's all you are going to say to your opponent then consider not communicating with them at all. Everyone has had games lost to draws and chance, that's literally the point of card games.
---
Has anyone tried Ancient Mage / Malygos otk for this brawl? Spirit + Ancient Mage is +4 spell damage, though it can't be copied with Faceless Manipulator, but it might add consistency to this. 
---
Nice.
---
Wild is wild baby
---
true
---
Ah wow, makes it even better. Got your hopes up, and then stomped on them.
---
Although I must say, he did play to his outs. 
---
Anyone know where the art is from? Definitely didn't appear in the video.
---
With the Year of the Dragon, you now have to collect gold for both adventure wings and card packs.
---
Are there any plans to improve the free to play experience to accomodate for the changes or do you not think it's nescessary?
---
Most people are guessing Magatha or Hagatha, and neither would really surprise me, but I'm gonna guess someone different: Charlga Razorflank! She's the leader of the Razorfen Quilboars, who live in a cave filled with thorns (look at the picture and you see some in the bottom). Maybe we will find out more about the mysterious "Hench-Clan", or the Hogriders...
---
So neutral legendaries will be 5 villains and we will most likely have a mage hero card. I hope there will be class specific cards again. Witchwood didn't have them and it was boring. It is always fun to predict a class specific legendary weapon, spell or loa.
---
There is a lot of lack of nuance since people think anticapitalism, communism, stalinism and marxism are all the same.
---
Strong arena stuff though
---
Will Heroic Brawls ever return? (The one where the main prize was 50 packs and 3 golden legendaries.) If not, will there be something similar with massive potential rewards?
---
Poor Tog looks so sad :(
---
Magatha Grimtotem here we go

---
By my count, Year of the Raven introduced the most new keyword mechanics since the vanilla set. Was this more of a coincidental or purposeful design decision?
---
i agree, no more Stalin
---
C-C-Clippy?! He's alive!  
---
My guess is Magatha, matriarch of the grimtotem tauren.
---
\#WaggleJustice
---
Zilliax is great,  Black Knight always makes a short comeback at the start of each expansion,  Togwaggle was the core of the best deck before the Druid nerfs (and still isn't bad), and Hemet was great in Shudderwock prenerf (and is really good in this week's tavern brawl with Mechathun Warlock). 
---
So not all bad.
---
what if it s he dragon from mean streets of gadgetzan that never made it to a card, part of the mage/priest/warlock group. If you look at the trailer it shows a giant dragon guy with them.
---
Not sure if that's a joke or not, I had an 11 win run last night where I played 10 rogues and am on a 10 win run today that has played 9. That's like 19 of 25 games. 
---
Those decks are so degenerate. That's why I go to Wild to enjoy playing with good ol' honest Big Priest.
---
/r/togwaggledidnothingwrong
---
It will work. Unfortunately Face Collecter will be way too slow for this meta. You've got to have a "win by turn 6 mentality"  and that's assuming your deck is running a bit slow. The best decks out there usually have a possible turn 3 or 4 win scenario with 6 meaning there deck is running slow or they had bad draw.  
---
Just a warning for you before you spend any gold. There's not much room for playing experimental and fun decks at this point. You likely won't have many matchups that would allow you to use Face Collector successfully.
---
No, fuck the US!
---
The first two paragraphs are about how the most prevalent classes are hunter by far, followed by paladin.

those are some bold claims.

**Can we get [old Jaina art](http://media.blizzard.com/wow/media/wallpapers/characters/jaina-proudmoore/jaina-proudmoore-large.jpg) back?** I know that some people might prefer the [new version](https://i.imgur.com/gyacLTY.png), so I think it would be good to give us option to switch art versions in game.

He was merely responding to a joke that was already political.

Not a neutral minion 
---
Quest priest with mind blasts and  Archbishop Benedictus have done the job for me.
---
Looking at OW, HotS, Diablo 3, and even SC2 co-op - other games have a prestige-type system where leveling / XP is always worthwhile. Personally, I've been max level with all heroes for years now, and feel like making changes there would help address the constant request for Achievements and rewards.
---
Can you talk a little about the decision not to hall of fame Mind Control Tech?
---
I know it’s not the strongest classic card, but after Ice Block rotated was an easy first place for card I hated the most this year.  And I’m not just saying that due to playing against it, I got to legend for the first time this year with a deck running 2x MCT.  Still hate the card and find it unfun, whether played by me or against me.
---
lol kadghar 
---
I think this is closer:
---
4/20
---
Taunt, Spell Damage +1
---
Adjacent minions get +2 attack
---
At the end of each turn, restore 1 health to all friendly minions, restore 4 health to your hero, summon a 1/1 murloc, and draw a card.
---
I guess you could remove Nightmare Amalgam to make it 1/16. Either way the combined mana cost would be insane. 
---
The win condition is that you will get rid of all your opponents hp by turn 4 which counters Mechacthun most of the time.
---
Good job.
---
Togwaggle isn’t a Warcraft character though, he was created specifically for Hearthstone.
---
Does that mean there's not many players, or that players are playing a lot?

For those who can't tell, there's an AABBA rhyme scheme. I believe these videos are all in limerick form.

I thought he was the first Blizzcon exclusive, or was that Mekkatorque?
---
Happy birthday to me!
---
What do you do about those who have significant presence in multiple regions? Any solution to this has to take that into account.
---
&gt; It's the least they can do, the cards have no value.
---
They have no tangible or objective value outside of Hearthstone.
---
Many are quite valuable with respect to playing Hearthstone.
---
Last time I met Togg he stole my deck and filled the empty place it used to be with toxic blood grenades. 
---
I see the fun times are not likely to end soon.
---
Thank god they fixed Tuskarr Totemic.
---
lmao so playing the Quest is actually intended to make your deck WORSE? and all this time I thought you wanted 1 mana 3/2 beasts that cycle!
---
fuck I'm bad at Hearthstone
---
Do you have any plans to make card positioning matter more in the year of the dragon? I really liked the chess battle in karazhan/tavern brawls and would love to see more cards reward/punish players for putting them in the right spot on the board.
---
I crafted 2 arena treasure chests.......yeah might regret that later.
---
Though I did go 12-2 with maly rogue so worked out in the end
---
That would definitely tie back into Journey to Ungoro since they slightly touched on the Titans. 
---
Would you consider unnerfing some of the cards that are rotating because the wild format has a higher power level? like bonemare back to 7 mana 
---
Is there anything being done about Bots that seem to be plaguing the lower ranks and casual?
---
So hot

Would team 5 ever implement an achievement function where you were rewarded points or dust for different various achievements and those points could be used to unlock cosmetics, emotes, new backgrounds, or older card backs? Would be radio you did! Also thanks for doing this!

UNGORO BELONGS TO THE TITANS
---
I doubt it's gonna a be a random background character that hasn't been relevant in 10 years.
---
Hagatha makes the most sense. since she does have a grudge with us after we turned back the witchwood.
---
You n-no take candle!
---
The developers think that 9 classes is already too many for all of them to have a separate identity. 
---
Volcanosaur is a rare
---
I wish I were joking, but this is team 5, so no, sadly I am not joking. We are far far more likely to see this as a third-party deck tracker plug-in way before it gets added to the game, which it never will. The motto has been "BARE FUCKING MINIMUM" outside of pumping out expansions. You would have thought Atlas moved the world to get those extra 9 deck slots. 
---
&gt; Bolf Ramshield
---
[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNgDw4K-HVg)
---
She loves those totems.
---
Updooted 
---
So my knowledge of WoW lore is nil but my first thought when I saw the card was that it would be Talanji and Bwom'samdi from Rastakahn's Rumble.
---
* The totem invokes shamans, but also trolls in general. It could be a stand-in for Talanji's "shrine".
---
* The skulls and bones have an obvious connection to Bwom'samdi.
---
* Talanji's characterization in the adventure mode is of a remorseful opponent, she's notably a lot more grim and serious than the others. It's possible that since the Rumble she's done a full heel turn.
---
* Likewise, if you play as Priest during the adventure, Rikkar has some creepy and evil-sounding lines and a spooky skull-themed outfit.
---
Other people have pointed out the flaws in Hagatha and Magatha, but other than Talanji being quite recent and not evil I think she's a solid fit.
---
Removing my head was merely a setback!
---
They could do young Rhonin, that would be pretty cool! Especially since he sort of married Alleria’s younger sister, imagine that interaction. 
---
Rhonin: “So uh... this is awkward.”
---
Alleria: “I will show you the might of the Elves!”
---
Rhonin: “Trust me, I’ve seen plenty of Elven Might already.” *wink*
---
What a good write up. I suggest you share it as a new post, it really catches the misconception of hearthstone in general and wild especially

---
From edgy boy to party boy to stand up comedian?
---
Murloc Pally is still pretty good, mostly if you have Murk-eye
---
Lots of possibilities!
---
* A card that creates a status effect on your side of the board and physically changes it (or a debuff effect on your opponent's side). For example, it could give you the ability to rearrange your minions after they've been placed, or it could make it so your opponent has two fewer minion slots.
---
* A card that is summoned on the board like a minion but is more like an "artifact." For example, the portal you get from the Warlock quest.
---
* A card that gives you a second hero power in place of your weapon. Sure, this could just be a spell, but for such a crazy new effect I think a new card type would be more fitting. Blizzard could actually retrofit the few previous spells that change your hero into a different power to be this card also if they wanted to.
---
* Cards that represent armor for your hero. These could give you spell damage, actual armor, the "you only take 1 damage at a time" effect, etc.
---
* Trinkets! Trinkets are popular in WoW because at endgame they often have interesting on-use effects instead of just being stat sticks. A trinket could be "equipped" by your hero and give you an on-use ability with a cooldown of two or three turns.
---
* Fortifications. These would be summoned on top of minions. Opposing creatures have to smash through them to attack the creature inside of that slot. They would be an alternative to taunt minions that have a twist. Some would also give the minion untargetable or some would give the minion more health. As a drawback, the minion can't attack.
---
Of course you would have to design cards that interact with all of these new card types or retrofit old ones. Acidic Swamp Ooze, for example, could now destroy a weapon, trinket, or fortification.
---
These are the best announcement of the announcement ever!
---
I just want to know when they will announce the expansion.
---
BFA Jaina would be cool to have, just saying

Just pay attention to the screen, if it seems like that you have disconnected because nothing is happening, then really quickly force quit the game and then go back into the app, it will reconnect you to the game. 
---
time to give back all our gold
---
Sadly I thought this was a normal brawlsem because I didn't read anything. 
---
So yeah my deck was worthless.
---
as a multiple legend player, i have no reason to return to your game. i want to WANT to play hearthstone, but there is no incentive other than a chest filled with mediocre rewards for the amount of time put in. give us badges, or packs, or anything that can differentiate from players that can’t hit 5-legend and give us something to work towards. i have no interest in the legend grind when i get nothing out of it. 
---
are all the cards in the deck even-costed?
---
Feugan and Stalagg are coming back?
---
Or are [warlocks getting their version of Acidmaw and Dreadscale?](https://wow.gamepedia.com/g00/Eredar_Twins?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D&amp;i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.dv=23)
---
Hmm...
---
I love murlocs and I am hoping to add a splash of murlocs in the next few expansions. Sludge Slurper has an amazing coming into play sound, check it out!
---
I can feel the rage from the other guy. How long did his next turn take?
---
The current Standard year (Year of the Raven) which is almost over was pretty stale for the most part due to a lot of the new cards being overshadowed by the high power level of the Year of the Mammoth.
---
Thankfully, rotation is almost here and they're rotating two problematic cards from the Year of the Raven (Genn and Baku) early, so the upcoming meta is bound to be extremely different. It'll be like four sets coming out all at once.
---
I vaguely remember odd paladin. I feel like the last thing I remember was druid was OP for a long time, then paladin started making a wave, but I could be wrong.
---
I've written a little program for myself that shows me exactly that. Unfortunately I have to keep updating my program everytime I open a new card but I've made it very easy to do so. It shows me how many cards of each rarity i have and how much dust it would cost me to complete any expansion. I would love if there was a way to see this within the game.
---
&gt; Our focus right now is making sure existing game modes feel like they’re fresh and exciting
---
So what does this mean for wild? It’s been the same decks for the last few years and the metas been stale for months. With decks like Big priest, renolock and Cubelock running the meta for the last few years. Can we expect any major changes to the format like nerfing oppressive/highrolling cards like Barnes and Voidcaller or is the meta never going to change? 
---
I think as others said, we play in one region because we are locked to one region.  
---
* You can't share a "Play-A-Friend" quest on Reddit without asking which server they are on.
---
* Launch day we have threads for people to share their decks/collections with budget players and again, locked by region.
---
* You could even have a real global ladder, and regional rankings, if this was implemented.  That was one thing I liked about another game, Gwent.
---
* It seems archaic now compared to other games.
---

the problem is all players on this subreddit are legend rank, so i will not face against them in my rank 15 games.
---
So, its going to be "Double" and act like "Summon a copy of this minion" without the Battlecry tag, as to not make Shudderwock OP?
---
/tinfoil hat
---
You copy it and the game detects it is in your clipboard in the deck builder
---
Question: Would the Hearthstone team ever consider adding a ranked match stle mode similar to other card games? Where you play best 2 out of 3 with a small side board? That would make tech cards more useful amd make it so u dont have to nerf your own deck to tech in a card that counters a meta deck.
---
Any chance you will rework or revalue the gold/dust economy?
---
I guess I don't see the downside of adding auto-squelch as an option, because some people (like me) squelch at the beginning of each game anyway. It's not like the status quo is forcing people who want that option to interact with their fellow humans. It's just irritating to have to remember to do it each game, especially when auto-squelch exists in pretty much every multi-player game with chat.
---
Personally, emotes tend to trigger me way too easily, so removing that aspect of the game actually makes it more fun for me. I don't mind losing a fair game to a better player, but I DO mind losing to someone whose emotes make me think they're a jerk. 
---
I feel like emotes are a pretty big hit in Clash Royale. Perhaps some different voice lines that you could buy with gold or money for each hero? Not sure what your contract look like for your voice actors and if this is easily feasible or not. I think it would create more dynamic "conversations" in game.
---
That or alternate art cards would be cool (full art cards etc). Not sure how that implementation would look either. Might clunk things up a bit or go against your visual design philosophies. 
---
can you still get it by playing against someone who has it equipped or is it no longer available?
---
Maybe the storyteller from the teasers is an alternate mage hero?
---
Draw is key for consistently winning in this brawl.  Rogue#1 also doesn't really want its board to be filled with tokens because it needs board space to buff.
---
I just wanted to *double down* on the fact that we can't give any new keywords away.
---
Odd Paladin started after the Witchwood came out since it required a card from that set, Baku. Even Paladin was stronger at first but got nerfed pretty quickly before coming back later. Paladin was still strong leading up to that, however, in the form of Dude Paladin. That might be the deck you remember if you quit during K&amp;C.
---
I appreciate your raising this concern and it is certainly something that I want to take back to the team. I wish I had a direct answer for you right now on this, but I want to give the topic the consideration and thought that it obviously deserves. Thank you for making us aware of it
---
RAAFAAAAAAAAAAM THE SUPREME ARCHAEOLOGIST 
---
This is something you guys have been "looking at" for years. Ben Brode said it, you've said it. I've been playing this game for a long time and have heard this many times. This is one of the things the community I think is very frustrated with in regards to communication. You're always looking at things, always checking things out, always looking for ideas, and for years nothing has been really implemented or changed.
---
That's implying that the end result wasn't them wanting to give every player this card back though, which it *absolutely* was
---
&gt;We talk pretty in-depth about common suggestions like 2v2; we've even spent some time in design and engineering prototyping what that mode might translate to in Hearthstone.
---
Do you think 2v2 will potentially be doable based on what you've seen? That would be extremely awesome
---
Ya that happens every once in a while
---
When start? 
---
I love this idea so much it’s small but only the dedicated cool cats would have it. Also can we play get the original Rogue and Malfurion Hero Portraits back (I know it’s a stretch)
---
I play on the first day for a reason.  Yesterday my lowest was 8+ wins over 5 runs, today, I ran one and got 4.  The stats are somewhere but I'm pretty sure it is 7 wins to go infinite.
---
Thanks for the ping and /u/Ben_Thompson_HS thanks for the reply. Super glad to hear 
---
I really like the slight variations on hero powers when you slam that button. I'd like to see new heroes and old have great animations and sounds when they do these things. Also opening up to a customization emote system would be nice. I rarely feel the need to threaten others via emote so alot of them don't see use when I could be using others.  Wow and hello get a lot of use. Could we get more?
---
I love cubing him and then using one of the many deathrattle triggers to fill the board with rushing Houndmasters, along with the cube itself.
---
Interesting! Any examples we can look to that you've contributed? 
---
I know the previous version of tournaments was ‘sideboarded’ but are there any plans to eventually implement the new approach to tournaments I.e. a way for us to play specialist format in game without third-party websites?
---
There's a nearly 1000 reply thread on the NA blizzard forums about users wanting another chance to obtain Tyrande - and Team 5/Blizzard refuse to offer any information on the issue and it really feels like they simply don't care.
---
More personalisation in games is such an incentive to play - it's why so many gaves have skins, minions, outfits, etc. It's just sad there's been completely silence on this issue outside of some vague promises years ago or by staff that have left/been forced out of the team.
---
The lack of communication frinthe HS team is really grating when devs and community managers in other games are so open to communicating with their playerbase.
---
PLEASE
---
A good version of this answer would realize that most people "play only in one region" because their collection doesn't transfer over. 
---
Its not because they want to.
---
I know it's good in the brawl because I used it lol, I might start using it in standard decks now though since I have both Alex and Malygos. 
---
ouchie, it's probably going to be expensive for me to catch up seeing as that the latest my collection has gone to has been Ungoro and FT
---
How do you guys plan to attract more players to the game? It feels the player base is shrinking gradually. The Ranked star system change helped, but what else could you realistically do?
---
Haha, this will be a real discussion point for Toast and Regis, but they have to hurry up cuz new expansion will be announced at the next tuesday as always or maybe thursday. Also saying anything means agreement.
---
Your definition of "very short" differs from mine.
---
Also, this thread is the place to lift ideas, not shoot them down. (let designers worry about that)
---
He means Puddlestomper.....I think. Misremembering the name of some murloc. Or he is trolling us.
---
Maybe, with a slight chance we just got a murloc name spoiler for one of the upcoming cards.
---
Any hints at least??? 
---
Either two keywords, or one that doubles things....
---
Is it found on any cards that cost more than 5?
---
Yeah I think it was dude paladin, it was so fucking annoying
---
Could you speak to the difficulties in implementing new game modes and perhaps help us understand why it may not be as easy as the community sometimes thinks?
---
Lol I played one free run last night went 8-3 and I faced 7 rogues so yea they are out there 
---
So no achievements ?
---
If you've been away from the game for a while, [Kripparian did a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZL5lBkOLWI&amp;) to catch you up on the game changes to Hearthstone.
---
* **More Legendarys per Set**: Fewer Neutral Legendary cards and more Class Legendary cards.  Means classes have more distinct identities.  Offset by change below...
---
* **Pity Timers Have Changed**: No more duplicate legendary cards and new pity timer for first 10 packs of a set (guarentees you a Legendary).  Otherwise, still guaranteed a Legendary in 40 packs and average every 20.  New sets typically grant a free Legendary as well.
---
* **The Witchwood (May 2018) - Important**: Two powerhouse cards, [Genn Greymane and Baku the Mooneater](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--D3X8i4ad--/c_fit,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/gcpqdtnu7x84x5jffs9s.png).  They are getting Hall of Famed in April 2018.
---
* **Boomsday Project (August 2018) - Unimportant**: Don't feel bad skipping this set.  As of Rastakhan launch, didn't really have a major impact.  While not overly powerful, [Zilliax](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/thumb/8/8a/Zilliax%2889803%29.png/200px-Zilliax%2889803%29.png?version=d273cd82bcb6aca52803a0d1c99f4468) is one of the most commonly used cards.  Very flexible.
---
* **Rastakahn's Rumble (December 2018)** - **Unimportant** - The overall power level of this set was weak.  After April rotation, the meta may be weak enough for some more  to see play.
---
* **[Whizbang the Wonderful](https://i.redd.it/laoinz1asxa11.jpg)** - Fun card that lets you randomly get the most current [deck recipes](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Deck_Recipe) that update with each new set.  Not the most powerful decks but enough to try out new cards and do decently.
---
* **New Solo Content Each Set**:  Every set now has new solo content and they are pretty fun.  Completing it will let you unlock a special cardback but no additional rewards.  All free content though and a good way to check out the game.
---
* **Arena**: No longer have equal chance to draft cards.  Now have "buckets" that Blizzard separates card strength into and limits frequency based on class strength.  Now drafts, and more importantly class winrates, are far closer.  Best Arena probably has been.
---
No new format then ?
---
Yes an upgrade hero portrait and card back for 1000 wins would be awesome!!
---
Hey, just wanted to ask if you guys were considering or had a plan for supporting custom decks to fight the AI with? i.e. make/choose a deck, give it to the AI and fight them with a different one.
---
I play singleplayer like crazy and would absolutely love this option. It would also add a lot of value to practice mode as you'd be able to test your decks both as and against so many options.
---
Thanks for doing the AMA by the way! Upcoming solo content looks absolutely fantastic.
---
Much more likely that it's a Keyword that emphasises having two/doubles of something, imo.
---
They just want our gold before the new expansion
---
diamond after gold hero would be sick
---
I would love some monthly or weekly quests.
---
Or else just some bars to fill or to see some numbers go up. 
---
Like do 1000 damage this week or summon 100 minions
---
Any price, if someone gets the keyword from those? Is is Duality?
---
Sure, Keleseth definitely works in this brawl.  Dump the engineers, put in Keleseth and a Defender of Argus or a Gnomish Inventor.
---
kind of upsets me that this is posted already.  i'm not usually one to complain about netdecking but at least make people try to use their own creative juices for a run or 2 before jumping online for the best decks.   I know Standard will devolve into this when the new expansion hits within the first few hours.  
---
Fwiw, took Paladin + Thekal to 9 wins as a soft counter to Alex+Maly.  All rogues from 3 wins on up. 
---
any plans to make wild better and more played? it's very underpopulated right now.
---
AYA
---
FORTUNE TELLER  
---
DR. BOOM (or mechgineer thermaplugg)
---
NEXUS CHAMPION SARAAD
---
nah just kidding this is kind of outdated and there are more than four henchmen
---
will you guys send baku/genn to HoF a week early too
---
Tournament prize pools.
---
To be fair, it's a pretty nice and unique card back, and that's saying something considering how many we've gotten over the years. I don't see how it's any different than a majority of people using the previous season's back when we get it at the beginning of the month.
---
And I get that you're saying you haven't seen ANYONE not using it, but you have to keep in mind too that there is incentive to keep it active to spread it to anyone else who may not have gotten it. Even if 99% of people have it by now, that's still an incentive no other card back has ever had. I don't really think it's fair to sum it up as "apparently no one cares about card backs".
---
What a tease 
---
Saves so much time! 
---
I have and paid for both limited event skins and I don’t give a damn even if they gave them to everyone else for free.
---
Did the naughty man hurt your feeelingssssss
---
Die 
---
The Prisoner, The Lady of Shadows and The Tower.
---
considering that we don't know any of the new cards, it would be hard to know the new recipe decks
---
I'm hoping for Guac Boy
---
Ah I didn't know that!
---
I already did this analysis when the 5 Wing Adventure was released but I assumed Golden Zayle could be dusted.  You basically need to open a lot of new expansion cards from your packs or highly value the PvE content.
---
This is [everything you get that has real gameplay value](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/20NJS1QNU2JU1551306604231.jpg) outside of PvE.  The dust to gold ratio is roughly 1 to 1.64. (*see below*) (*e.g.* 1 gold is equal to 1.64 dust)
---
* 15 new *Year of the Dragon* packs (1,500 gold)
---
* 1 Golden Classic Pack (Average of 469.8 dust with minimum of 300 dust.  So 293.6 gold)
---
* ~~[Golden Legendary Zayle](https://www.pcgamer.com/genn-baku-and-doomguard-sent-to-the-hall-of-fame-as-hearthstone-heads-into-the-year-of-the-dragon/) (1,600 dust or 977.4 gold)~~
---
* PvE Content has zero equivalent value.
---
* Also, if you don't purchase all 5 Wings, you don't get a Golden Legendary Zayle or Golden Classic pack and lose 1,294 gold outright.  So only buying 5 wings makes sense.
---
#####So for 3,500 gold (or 2,800 gold if you got the first Wing free) you get an minimum equivalent gold value of 1,793.6 gold. ~~(This also assumes you can disenchant Zayle)~~ 
---
&gt;**Note**: In Hearthstone, a pack is worth about 163.7 dust if you keep your Legendary.  And 102.8 if you don't.  Because you always get a new missing Legendary (since Un'Goro), it is almost always 163.7 dust per 100g spent on a pack.  (*See* [B137 on Best Pack tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYuukT1O3qdvbSfpUAbJMJLYkusXclc-Rivd-uMy6g0/edit#gid=269921972))  Numbers are based on over 33.3k packs collected where packs opened were over 40. (*see* [B153 for data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcH6U79Uk8xSQhqMqu93sSZoNwMq1E4dw-CHFSTMenk/edit#gid=579362856)).  I also assume the golden pack rarity rate is the non-golden+golden drop rates.
---
Yup. I'd never let anyone with a golden priest portrait near children.  
---
But if I ever need executioners or torturers, I'll just play some HS and find an opponent with a golden priest portrait to recruit. The real difficulty is getting them to accept a friend request after the match.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
&gt;Yeah, looking at the percentage of dust value you're missing from each set would be the most useful, but obviously unlikely to be implemented
---
because it would be the most direct indication of how little dust buying packs gets you unless you're lucky
---
... that wouldn't be a tutorial then. 
---
RIP 6 mana cards
---
Yep, literally posted there 7 days ago.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstonecirclejerk/comments/avsgoi/classic_jaina_confirmed/
---
So people concede? So people play purposefully poorly? This is destructive to how the game should actually be played. Terrible idea. 
---
Which will probably cost you more than you gain if you aren't running otk or get it done on your first free run. 
---
Between such a significant rotation, the expanded single player content, the changes to Arena, and what they've been saying in the AMA about more events and giving players other stuff to do in between expansions, I'm okay with there not being an entirely new game mode this year.
---
Oh thanks I will look into that. 
---
I never bother with mine but will probably set it to random when they add that so I never have to think about it again.
---
I think (s)he mean that if you care about "spending money right".
---
JUST BUY PACKS.
---
don't buy adventure you will just waste your time.
---
Blizzard let’s make people gay but take away their titties
---
Something with spells specifically based on the last reply.
---
It may just be something like: If you control another copy of this minion, do X
---
Fair enough, I just hope all that is enough to make a difference because I'm quite bored of "meta" play in general.  
---
Perhaps it's just the current meta that is the cause of this - guess I won't know until after rotation settles down.   
---
I was a pretty new player after the last rotation so I'd have to ask others who had been around 1-2 years+ when the last rotation hit if it really freshened the game up for them?  
---
I thought the spellstones were very unique.  They helped to expand and/or define class identity and created more deck building possibilities.  Similar to the function of the quest, it *generally* forces you to build your deck a certain way i.e. play secrets, elementals, murlocs, etc.  
---
I would like a card function like this but with a broader "quest" that would allow for less linear gameplay.  The results of the spells would likely need to be less powerful but one example might be a mage minion that is a 0/2 with spell damage of 1 and cost 3 mana.  Gains +1 spell damage to a maximum of 3 for each turn in your hand.
---
i honestly like it.
---
 will there ever be a archievement point system?
---
Less hurt more surprised. I've had people spam emotes before, but never to add me to spam swear words in the chat.
---
Holy fucking shitballs how did you do that
---
Good summary.  Thank you.
---
I'm nowhere near as down about the game as you are and I already primarily play other games at the moment so why on earth are you still playing?  
---
Ehh... Tarot cards are literally designed to cover everything. Anything and everything is represented by one tarot card or another.  
---
I think it just goes with the narrator being a fortune teller.
---
Honest answer:   
---
&gt;will we ever see a change to how things are currently handled     
---
No, because then Blizzard would make less money from players buying packs and pre-orders.  
---
Actual answer:   &lt;silence&gt;       
---
Blizzard is not going to give us more free gold, free packs, or dust.  They value profits over player happiness in this case.
---
Thank you for this. Upvoted 
---
It's almost like this game mode is unbalanced as fuck and showing the meta in a nutshell. Brawliseum shouldn't be part of a tavern brawl to begin with. It's so common
---
&gt; If you're complaining that this Brawl is terrible and shouldn't be here, ask yourself if you ever play the Tavern Brawl more than just to get your pack.  
---
The problem isn't so much that it's a tavern brawl but it's brawliseum. Something quite rare that many people look forward to and with this incredibly bias brawliseum it's ruined that opportunity for many.  
---
Yes I know. But it’s even more so in this tavern brawl because there are certain decks that are way superior because of the nature of the mode, so if you didn’t craft a deck that fits perfectly into the mode, you won’t win 
---
Lol, I should have thought my meaning was quite obvious.
---
If you don't want the adventure.....do not buy it.  Spend your money on something else, either some other game or some other way to buy packs.
---
It also seems to be related to spells, so I guess it will be some kind of spell that casts twice. Maybe the second time is one turn later, similar to MtG's Rebound Mechanic.
---
I.e. should have just been a regular tavern brawl as it had been in the past.  
---
I prefer the monthly leaderboard over one per season, since i want to have a goal in arena every month and this would lead to playing less imo.
---
I love this brawl so much I actually bought one with money.... to get lots of wins and get free packs.... 
---
