Exactly, the time between brawls is still one week. You're completely right

---
Nah man, it's always Myra's into Cataclysm.
---
Yah OP messed this one up
---
Just pare this with the image of the Corridor Creeper(?) being destroyed behind him in the fireball and you'll have a great meme for pointing out that cards are being nerfed. Thanks, Blizzard!
---
It's a voluntary choice made by the people developing it. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
You mean before he was nerfed. Now for some reason they give Yogg an unnerfed Yogg.
---
overlay with the old art or something like that plz
---
I play wild, so Id rather have the same priest board clear. Priest receiving new board clear after no board clear is not great when none of them ever go away.
---
Rafaam goes by the title "Supreme Archaeologist" in his adventure. If you think this is over the top, you might be pleased to hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK8rNtiJYWs).
---
glad to see they're keeping the theme throughout the classic set of the flavor texts being mostly fucking terrible
---
Sometimes they don't have a shieldslam. And you must try something before the turn 10 is coming. After turn 10 the game is almost lost if you don't deal damage. And don't forget that you can just straight up lose the board to control warrior and the game is over.

---
No it wasn't hard to understand but it always felt weird to me.
---
Pretty trash. There’s been lots of other ways to have 0 mana Warlock hero powers in the past with Odd/Even Warlock and Wilfred Fizzlebang and it never works
---
That makes smurfing even less attractive, that's a lot of fucking work to kill newbies in Arena to compensate
---
I mean, it was said long ago that lackey support was going to be a thing this whole year.  If this is the extent of "card generation" in shaman this set, I think we'll all be ok.  Weakness doesnt have to mean non existent.  
---

---
And, I'd hardly call this card playable.  Its strictly worse than slurper, and I'd argue worse than cable rat too.  Lackeys aren't that important in most shaman decks as is, I hardly see this being the center point of any kind of deck.
---
this, so much this
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
edit: Thanks for the silver
---
That seriously makes 0 sense
---
True. If we get some control-focused lackeys, this card could find a home. But currently all lackeys have favored aggro playstyles (save, arguably, Ethereal Lackey which is useful in both aggro and control match ups) and this card is way too slow for an aggro deck.
---
Sure thing.
---
I think what they mean is no serious meta deck plays Twisting Nether, aka Zoolock doesn't run it.
---
I'm really trying to imagine why making a childrens card game more kid-friendly makes you sad. Were you also mad when they didn't print any new cards with blood on them... idk maybe ever?
---
 80g NA Choco#1508. I'll show, you go first.
---
it takes out the rather violent nature of the art, and updates it to NOT show someone being impaled, devoured, bloodlet, or with a broken head. makes the game more stylish and fits the aesthetic they go for in the animated stuff, players aren’t literally murdering eachother, just having a fun game of punch-fireball-swords
---
I craft golden cards because I like the art they way other people craft meta decks. Not sure how this makes me the bad guy or Mr. Moneybags. It’s a collectible card game. The art is the most important part of the card for some of us.
---
Finally they hired more staff to clean the mess after the brawl faster.
---
Did Activ shareholders came down to their senses and become more human ? Faith in humanity restored !!
---
Yes please
---
&gt; I will not name the region that this is clearly meant to cater to, because mods are already deleting those posts. Draw your own conclusions there.
---
Game already has China-specific alternative art, had it for years, mostly about skeletons. Why would Blizzard change that now and start using the same for everyone?
---
Regardless of the power or viability of this card, I just want to talk about its NAME. This was probably a pain in the rear for Blizzard’s localization/translation team to get right, considering Rafaam’s “Supreme Archaeologist” line might not have been so well known in other languages.
---
So it's also self-censoring that they never printed cards with blood since the classic set, are you also mad about that? Self-censoring also applies to things that are done pre-emptively after all.
---
Do you think there are zero limits on what should be in a product designed for kids?
---
Sexy woman = bad. To appease Chinese censorship, and also the type of people who want to ban cheerleaders and models and such.
---
Wild heal paladin gonna be sick with nozari, these two and reno. And before some of you complain that u can't heal w/ reno if you got duplicates; yeah. I know. Still got 3 max heals so shut up
---
Brand isnt a druid, he is a mage. If you want a druid you are better looking at Udyr or Nidalee, but Udyr is more shamanistic
---
It's crazy that [[spike ridged steed]] hasn't been mentioned yet. Its exactly what we're talking about? Or did I miss the joke?
---
After having more than 9 deckslots for so long, it's finally catching up to us. They're collecting our debt
---
RENO IS BACK BOYSSS EAT SHIT AGGROFUCKS
---
Yes but how is "play a murloc deck" more of a condition than "play a quest deck"?

The first 10 packs of a new expansion guarantee 1 legendary. After that a timer starts and the longest you can go without a legendary after that is 39 packs. The 40th pack will then have a legendary guaranteed and then it resets again.

Also, sexualization.

---
Dave Kosak's voice sounded a bit strange in this video.
---
Yes.
---
Oh ok thank you for the info
---
You think 4 mana to draw 2 cards, gain 12 armor, and give your minions +2 attack isn't enough?
---
You just mulligan the quest against aggro, and against control you'll always float mana anyways and it gives you a huge amount of value.
---
😍
---
Not really, those two cards are only comparable in “played stats”. One re-summons a 3/1 the other not, one can go face and the other not and one heals you for 3 and the other one doesn’t. The damage potential of the new one is also double, due to Rush on the 1st and 2nd minion
---
It doesn't, I'm just giving you the context for OP's nonsense
---
I meant HC, I'm not 100% sober :P
---
&gt; It becomes censorship when it had already existed and then changed like so. Please search "censorship".
---
Literally not true. You completely made that definition up lol. Self censorship often happens at the creative level long before any product is made.
---
If you buy the 80 pack bundle, you're guaranteed 2 legendaries **at minimum**. The average rate of legendary drops from packs is still 1 in 20-ish. So you're still likely to get around 4. Hitting the pity timer is not a common occurrence.
---
You're guaranteed a Legendary within the first 10 pack openings of a new set. New set, in this case, meaning a set that you've never opened any packs for. Afterwards, the maximum distance between any two legendaries cannot exceed 40. So, the worst case scenario is that you get a legendary on your 10th pack and 49th pack.
---
Mass hysteria is rare though
---
This issue is actually resolved in this patch. Sorry it wasn't included in the patch notes!
---
Note that we were only able to get a partial fix in for this release, so you might see a little visual weirdness when this happens (but no more invisible cards). Expect that weirdness to be cleaned up with the Saviors of Uldum patch.

In the Dalaran Heist there's a boss with this hero power, and for all cards like that it summons the minions then buffs them.
---
&gt; Your attempts to explain how self-censorship isn't actually censorship are sad, pathetic, and embarrassing.
---
Except they're not even saying that, so your attempt to criticize them for it is what's embarrassing. They're saying everyone self-censors, which is literally true. There is no blood in any of the art for certainly any recent expansions, maybe any expansions at all, that is all "self censorship" as well.

Lorewise All blood Elves are High Elves,
---
There was always a Velen + Mind Blast +  Holy Smite combo deck floating around. I say combo loosely because it was more of a surprise reach in a standard control priest deck that no one ever suspected to have reach.
---
I love that these are a combination of quests and death knights without the most polarizing aspects of each.
---
This has literally been the tone of the entire game from the beginning. The only reason these cards weren't part of that is because their art was lifted from the old wow tcg.
---
This was unironically a B.A.N.G.E.R. Fucking catchy as fuck
---
"Wow this hero portrait is awesome! I normally don't buy these things but maybe this time is will!"

Do we get full dust refunds for some of these nerfs? RIP Secretkeeper.
---
Oh, fair enough
---
Ironically, these companies only cares about money (it's the reason of their existence, ofc) and are adult players the ones that will spend more money on a microtransactions based game like HS
---
The focus on this expansion seems to be more on fighting for Uldum rather than an outright battle of good vs. evil. Rafaam probably wants something in the depths of Uldum and the League of Explorers need to get it while fighting the forces of EVIL and Uldum's guardians. The Explorers will acquire the object and this ends up setting the scene for a more direct battle of good vs. evil in the last expansion of the year.
---
Mana Tide and Flametongue were also very good Simmons that change the state of the game from that card. Leaving a Mana Tide up against Agro Shaman at the time was devastating since one of its main weaknesses was running out of cards to play.
---
It honestly should though. Or else change the card text to make it consistent.
---
Uh Yeah you might wanna add the most questionable Board Clears. Plague of Death... Coming in Saviors of Uldum
---
It's basically a remake/parody of this, in case you didn't know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWcASV2sey0
---
Nice
---
You're amazing.
---
This actually looks like a sort of half-way between quests and Hero cards, and I really like it.
---
It avoids the whole "you just get your hero card and win". Now, it is "you do this and you can have your super hero power". I am actually really excited for this expansion. Well played blizz.
---
And that new theme. God damn. So good.
---
Is hadronox druid still a thing? Might be decent in there, considering they don't run malfurion because of the beasts summoned.
---
Critical mass, warrior already has enough removal. Give them more next rotation.
---
Yeah ... I'm the troll lol.  
---
Sorry but where did you post go? ;)
---
That won't be enough. What would the most OP Choose One card even be? A 12/12 with taunt for 8 mana? Is that worth running a weird Druid deck that tries to survive without Spreading Plague, Malfurion, effective ramp and Branching Paths? Probably not.

Is that the euphemism being used for the misogynistic puritanism shaming the female form of cards like Secretkeeper?

---
Depends on how they word it. It could be the case that Reborn only triggers at full health and it stays the same card. Probably not, but I hope it works like that
---
Look at the four that were changed for "blood" as gore would be a more appropriate reason. We have an impaled tuaren, a mauled humanoid, a disemboweled human, and the final one is a beast being bludgeoned.
---
Now looks at how they've changed. The bolt leaving the ballista instead of hitting, perspective change for head crack and it looks less menacing, no blood on evis to keep the illusion of a living target, and maul is now just a cute kitty. The "cartoon" blood didn't exist on these old cards and it was closer to realism than the rest the cards.

Wow, you packed a lot of ignorant, arrogant shaming into one post. Please don't devolve the argument into a false equivalence that someone being passionate about these changes needs to grow up. It's disingenuous and condescending. It's censorship and a sign of things to come. It's eroding artistic integrity. It's giving into a communist regime and settling for the almighty dollar from a company that once put fans first. If you have missed all that, then you haven't been a Blizzard fan for all that long.

The best way to counter priest is to become a ~~cunt~~ priest yourself

Just blank out the card art for any cards they dont liike. Then their playerbase can see that its govt censorship

It's not strictly worse, it does different things than scream. Shuffling is better for aggro than killing, even though it comes out two mana earlier.

and we're probably going to see at least one aggressive card with this mechanic on it. My bet's on paladin
---
This idea isn't exactly original.

I don't think it's terrible, it's just obviously not a good win condition, which Priest needs much more than a powerful board clear.

Is it worth it to use Amazon Coins for buying one the new expansion bundles even if they don’t have a cash back deal? It seems like no matter what it’s always better to use coins because the costs are cheaper than just using cash, but wondering what others recommend.

I'm seriously considering quitting hearthstone now. Blizzard thinks they need to make everything "Family Friendly" and "For the children," so they go back on the fact that they said they would **Never change art, for it is the most recognizable thing of the card** not only by changing art but also changing **THE NAME AND CREATURE TYPE OF A CARD** to make everything more child friendly in this game that follows the lore of an MMO about endless, violent, conscious-ruining world war between races while they leave game-breaking bugs, overpowered interactions/decks, and straight-up stupid Business decisions completely ignored.  
---
Blizzard. STOP.
---
just checked hsreplay matchups
---
bomb warrior has a 38% win rate vs mech hunter
---
control warrior has a 55% win rate against mech hunter
---
the only cards that control warrior uses that bomb warrior doesn't are:
---
Weapons Project x2
---
Ironbeak Owl x1
---
Big Game Hunter x1
---
Harrison Jones x1
---
Supercollider x1
---
Elysiana x1
---
Elysiana, BGH and Ironbeak Owl are essentially dead draws vs Hunter, which means the logical conclusion is that the matchup swingers here are **Ironbeak Owl**, **Supercollider** and **Weapons Project**
---
would you agree with that?

I think that the new druid quest that changes your hero power is a step away from Hero Cards. This way the alternative hero power must be earned through deck-building and gameplay rather than being granted by a single card.

Neat. So their police force can bash protester skulls in on the streets but eviscerate can't have a little splash of blood on it.
---
Real life violence comes second to pretend ass card game violence.
---
Guess I need to respect all aspects of a culture, even the dumb shit that makes no sense :/ this is a sensitivity issue :/
---
At least they didn't nerf elven archer
---
Yeah this picture is my life in a nutshell.
---
I am so happy for this and I know it will be fun not having to wait for the tavern
---
Nobody is running it. It seems pretty bad. If you came up with a deck that could actually run it, that would be amazing.
---
Oh my god. I can't believe they've had such a gory depiction in this game! I mean, you only have to be 13 years old in most places to play this game!
---
I'm sure if people looked at the cards there would have been outrage. Imagine the 13 year olds that have seen that! It's probably the first blood they've ever seen!

Well.. goodbye Heartstone. I just uninstalled it.. Played since beta, didn't bought packs for over 4 expansions and just played casually and wild. I feel Bliz is treating the old customers like trash and the greed is spiraling out of control man.. and now this?!

---
Also hand over your cards, I needta shuffle them into your deck.
---
You just admitted to being wrong on the internet. 
---
You have my bow.
---
why can't they just have a seperate art client for china?
---
&gt; remove all the blood and put the women in burqas?
---
Valeera art nerfed confirmed.
---
Any deck but pure aggro” is almost every deck that has ever existed in Druid.
---
But what about Yogg-Saron into Puzzle Box into Zul’jin into Shudderwock?
---
Now **that’s** a highlight reel I’d like to see!
---
This makes virtually no difference to me.
---
I dislike he new versions of deadly shot and headcrack especially but I am happy for the new felguard as it fits flavour better
---
It really doesn't. It's a really strong card. A totem that gives you a lackey and is a soft taunt is pretty strong for two mana.
---
I don't know if it'll see play since it doesn't fit into an aggro or control mage.
---
Hey thanks for the advice. I think I will give it a crack. I do really enjoy this game.
---
There must be as much adult themes as there is information about tianmen square in china
---
Give them an inch of censorship and they will eventually take a mile.
---
What else would it be?
---
Yeah, he was doing the Jean-Claude Van Damme splits on those camels, a la the recent Volvo commercial, albeit with more explosions:
---
https://youtu.be/M7FIvfx5J10
---
Yogg at least had a build around (lots and lots of spells). What build around does this have? Its just freaking weird.
---
Call me crazy but I like the old one much better. I’m not an artist so I can’t comment on the anatomy, and I could care less about sexy cartoons, but the old one just has more personality and style, it feels more unique and kind of pops out, while the new just looks like super basic fantasy wizard chick and is very forgettable.
---
What’s wrong with the old deadly shot?
---
Lol 80 bucks? Glad I've gotten out of this game for a while. If they were a little more player friendly I'd maybe jump in. 80 bucks should get you most or all the cards to an expansion.
---
We’re going to be rich boys!!
---
Hogger, nat pagle, Hemet, deathwing. Im forgetting more but old gods added a bunch.
---
I think it's better than evil cable rat but worse than that 2/1 murloc shaman got that gives a lackey.
---
This is a 0/2 soft taunt that generates a lackey. The difficulty is that this doesn't fit into an aggro deck nor would you want to play it in a control deck.
---
thats an animation an aspiring art student would make as a homework assignment
---
for a company known for their stellar animations that was awful. why even release it if its just going to look like that?
---
That's a good point, thanks for the insight!
---
Hearthstone has had top notch card art quality for years,so it is kinda sad to see it replaced by those mediocre cartoony images.
---
The real reason is for color balance/contrast.
---
Woooow I didn't expect to see this in r/hearthstone
---
... 
---
I'm glad I hatched
---
&gt; it's not like they liberally decorate cards with men's butts and thighs
---
Wow, it’s almost as if Blizzard knows that the majority of their fan base is men.
---
Imagine getting king crush, that absolute unit, from this
---
Ah yes, the tried and true domino effect
---
Ah.. A midriff man, I thought they only existed in the old legends and dusty scrolls.
---
In all seriousness, midriff and Thighs are not the same thing.
---
I have all these cards as golden, some I obtained years ago.  I know it will never happen but I hope they actually do treat these as "nerfs" and you can get a full dust refund on these and future card art changes.  It's the only silver lining.
---
I see only a gummy bear left in the sun for too long.
---
We'll have to see what new Choose One options are available, but the question to ask yourself when you're building the deck is what is the deck's main objective. This quest reward replaces the hero power that has board impact for one that only effects certain cards in the deck.  
---
So it's worth asking whether 'the juice is worth the squeeze'. Jade Idol was a particularly powerful Choose One ability which was able to carry the whole deck.  Will the new Choose One be of a similar power level? Maybe, and if so then it might be good enough.
---
TBF with them nixing adventures and just doing "expansions" people kinda got confused. But in general those always been the months with a few exceptions early on. 
---
It probably also feels early because of how delayed the current dungeon run / dalaran heist was.
---
Look at those biceps go

---
You could do it turn one omg.
---
What I want to know is, has Blizzard tried to justify this at all? Have they given a reason? Because we all know the reason is to keep the game legal in China.
---
But do they at least have the balls to own up to it?
---
I re-made the post for some reddit's issues, the version should be the latest : https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bcjuzo/hearthstone_how_to_get_tablet_ui_on_android/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Is this normal? To get a ton of one card and not some of others?

---
i mean, games, especilly WOW have a history of self censoring to compete in china, and on top of this, there could be other factors in the situation that are unrelated.  
---
windfury harpy and secret keeper both had really shitty anatomy, and maybe they wanted to fix that,  and snuck them through with a few other changes.  
---
the themes around suucubus is too much of a sexual reference, same with mistress of pain,  and hide some anatomy fixes in that?
---
This is the least interactive board clear ever. You can't even use sticky minions to bypass it. Terrible design.
---
They ban accounts all the time. That takes away their collection and more. If I get banned from the MTG Pro Tour I still get to keep my cards. 
---
Blizzard works hard to maintain their customer relationships. Feel free to ask them for a dust refund for making a cosmetic change to a card. But accept the fact that Blizzard is well within their rights to decline.
---
It would be so hilarious to just summon 3 30/45s on turn 2 in Arena and pass. How big did you get them before rope?
---
I thought the same, the art and cardname are completely mismatched.
---
Probably not as clever as you, coming up with things I didn't say since you can't actually address what I did.
---
Spot on dude.
---
I wonder why blizzard hates femininity so much?
---
Shaman could be give all minions Reborn, since resurrection is kind of a Shaman theme.
---
Rogue I could definitely see being shuffle all minions into owner's deck. Or cast Betrayal on all minions.
---
Warrior I predict is plague of boom and it gives all minions the boombot deathrattle.
---
Warlock I have no clue... turn minions into imps?
---
Whats different about eviscate? It looks the same too me
---
As 1/6 weapon, when you attack cast a random spell
---
Beat me to it
---
I actually played headcrack...
---
The rng element is fine for the most part. You still have a chance to win. Line up against a bomb warrior and it's a zero sum game. Better to concede and save 20 minutes of my life. 
---
Other than bomb warrior, the only other decks I face are some flavour of aggro. 
---
Playing against these decks mentioned above forces me to play counter decks I don't actually enjoy playing. 
---
Then I question why I'm bothering playing in the first place.
---
No, not at all for legendaries. The video I posted is a very unlikely event that can no longer even occur. (You cannot open duplicate legendary cards anymore.) However, it is very common to get multiples of the same common card. Since you open 4 commons in a pack, there will be many repeats.
---
Gonna be kind of sad when you draw bombs before you can get your quest done
---
It's in wild so it's safe :) no one cares about wild.
---
“Mistress” is considered profanity in [chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese_profanity#Mistress)

My dissapointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Prolly the whip mistress is holding was the last straw for blizzard.
---
I am not triggered, I am dissapointed :)
---
&gt; although icehowl also couldn't attack face the turn after
---
Which makes it different than rush....

Actual lol at this. Thanks.

I too would like to know this
---
Those are actually airbags built into the armor.
---
These changes make the game’s overall design better. Although deleting Succubus entirely isn’t the best solution, as well as some of the removal of blood/violence (in Eviscerate, especially), let’s remember the new xpac trailer we just watched. Imagine that, but including a barely clothed harpy/succubus/dominatrix, big booty secretkeeper, and a person’s skull getting cracked and bleeding out. They just don’t fit in with the fun, comedic silliness of the expansion(s).
---
And besides, it’s not like the non-Succubus women are completely censored. They’re still drawn quite attractively, and if anything, better, with details like Secretkeeper and Pain’s magic auras in their hands making them look more dynamic and powerful.
---
Felguard didn't change.
---
Are you saying a crossbow shooting an arrow is "less generic"?
---
&gt; If you honestly, HONESTLY don't know why people are getting so mad, then you're really behind the curve in terms of basic things like freedom of expression and censorship.
---
The people making this absolutely have freedom of expression, they *chose* to change it themselves. That's not a freedom of expression issue, sorry.
---
&gt; But it's the principle of the matter that rankles me, as well as many any other people. Today it's blood/gore and tits/ass being censored. Tomorrow it's smoking and drinking and drug use. The day after that it's against violence and weapons. After that comes harmful and dissenting opinions, at which point there's nothing left to fight the literal thought control being attempted. 
---
In a childrens card game. You don't fucking see tits and blood on barney the dinosaur either. There is absolutely a time and place and blizzard has decided that they don't think the time place is here for these things. Trying to suggest this is the leap to some kind of fucking thought control bullshit is absolute fucking insanity. Listen to yourself.
---
They want to change something to achieve tonal consistency in their game, and you're literally here talking about thought control.
---
&gt; Orwell was completely right that removing the word/concept of something from people's minds also removed the possibility of people acting upon that concept. It always starts nice and agreeable, making you think of the welfare for the children, but once that power of control is gained it's never relinquished willingly.
---
This card is actually really cool.
---
no, they're both about equal in every way to me, including their mediocrity
---
Fair enough
---
The most important thing is for it to randomly select voice lines from the box each time it gets played
---
This is my favorite trailer they've ever done
---
Oh dear, i'm sure you are devastated? I can't imagine what you are going through at this very moment. Your life must be LITERALLY hell. A card that you played at one time :'( The world...has been to cruel to you, if you wanna go, I won't hold you back.
---
YuGiOh: Duel Links just cuts off Japan's art for non-Japanese users. Even though that's stupid too, I actually have to give props to **KONAMI** for handling censorship better.
---
Maybe you should play a card game for adults. Hearthstone is for children now. Gotta clean this place up.
---
Don't test them.
---
Maximum yikes right here...  If you dont have plot twist that is.
---
They're updating/performing maintenance until tonight - they put a message in game a few days ago. Something about getting randomly disconnected but should still be able to log back in though
---
I bet Priest quest  gonna be something like play "x" deathrattles and then 2 mana hero power - ressurect one minion that died this game.  
---
It's also on point with the vibes of the expansion: death, reborn, mummies and such
---
I can’t actually imagine that they want to literally *destroy* the world. But I could imagine that they want to release the old gods. And I totally expect them to win this one.
---
&gt; There is usually a 20% coins back promotion when an expansion releases
---
I don't think this has happened for a long time. Sometimes there are coin-backs, but they are sparse, erratic and usually for a very short time (as in, I check a few hours later and it's gone).
---
Can you remember when the last time you had a coin-back for a Hearthstone purchase was?
---
I got the same popup then it halts update. Any solution?
---
The requirements didn't change: eu.battle.net/support/en/article/28991 they just started enforcing them on the play store level. I'm in similar situation to you, playing on old device below minimal requirements  After snip-snap update the game started to permanently freeze in certain situations - i guess its related and now they just made it more transparent.
---
Can anyone point me to a gallery that compares the old and new art?
---
Yeah, my bad. Forgot vargoth leaves the hand(somehow I forgot), but I  remembered plot twist leaves the hand
---
During rise of shadows, we got a 25% coin-back. I am hoping this happens again.
---
What am i looking at here?
---
Who cares the metaphor still stands.
---
Same, I got into WoW through unlocking Liadrin in HS and deciding to keep playing.
---
Jaina's boobs was the start of the end PepeWhy
---
&gt;How so? It grew contrived as we repeatedly banded together to save the world only to split again the next expac.
---
But WoW STARTED with this. The end of WC3 was everyone on Kalimdor banding together to push back the Burning Legion.
---
Also why would the Night Elves be allied with the Alliance of the Eastern Kingdoms which they have had no contact with whatsoever.
---
I wanna say same thing for the Undead and the rest of the Horde, but there's this niggling feeling in the back of my mind that says they explained this.
---
On a lesser note, why was Jaina considered a member of the Alliance and hostile to the Horde when last we saw he she murdered her father in order to protect the Orcs? She has like zero ties to the Eastern Kingdoms and is a major ally of everyone on Kalimdor.
---
What even brought down the initial alliance of Kalimdor in the first place? So apparently the Orcs are chopping down the trees in Ashenvale and the NEs aren't about that, cool, so what exactly was the resolution here? 
---
Am I just to believe that these people who were just brothers in blood who stood against a world ending threat didn't come to any kind of resolution? Jaina's humans seem to have zero issue living in a darn swamp while Thrall decided the smart thing to do was to park his faction city in the most lifeless, resourceless region of Kalimdor for no other reason than it was Thematic. Why not pick the Barrens, or Un'goro, or Azshara, or shack up with the Tauren in Mulgore?
---
Better maybe and although subjective a term I would say this is a more fun hero power to play with
---
That's no mere skull.  
---
That's Sir Daniel Fortesque.
---
For Harvest Golem (the card being joked about by OP) it has a death rattle that summons a 2/1, which is similar to the reborn mechanic since both have 2 attack. For Harvest Golem, since the death rattle summons a different minion, you can’t heal it.
---

Downvoting so the Chinese government doesn't see. Sorry buddy.

Was it this one? https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b18nnc/hearthstone_has_25_coin_back_again_im_not_sure/
---
I tried about 2.5 hours after the thread was posted and did not get coins back, so the promotion seemed to last a very short time.
---
Let me know if you see anything in the coming days!
---
Felguard is the same, they changed succubus
---
False,  its just 3 turns since 1st turn woul count
---
Closest I can think of is [[Duskboar]] in wild
---
so I came here all confused as to why this was even happening, but I guess it's mostly because of the China audience? So they're just doing a PG wipe across the board? I got some questions answered. But now I'm wondering: why is everyone talking about angry chicken? I've literally never heard that card talked about until and all of sudden everyone always knew about it needing to b changed? Can someone fill me in?
---
So, let me get this right.  
---
They changed cards solely to make them less adult, but 2 of those cards actually became more adult.

2/4/1 Beast  
---
That's complete nonsense, have you even played the game beyond the last year or so? Historically its been the exact opposite - nobody touched Ancestral Knowledge and ran mana tide in anything but aggro. Its not and was never meant to be about combo either - card draw in general for most decks is not about aggro. Its a card that replaces itself instantly, usually doesnt cost tempo because the opponent has to spend resources to remove it and if left alone for a few turns has by far the biggest low investment/high return ratio in the game.
---
I’m pretty sure this would be a sick combo deck with simulacrum or kadgar reflection 
---
You play one warper khadgar and reflection then infinitely snip snap
---
never realized how badass the worgen infiltrator art was
---
Shhhh! China can hear you!
---
Oh thank god, I wouldn't want a child to play this game and remember that blood and butts exist.
---
Hm, it's weird that this expansion is all old stuff so far. Old theme (LoE); Reborn is just a limited version of Deathrattle; and Quests were one of Journey to Un'Goro's unique mechanics. Has the Hearthstone team run out of ideas?
---
Kul tiran humans can be druids though, but I guess Reno isn’t fat enough
---
Seems kind of fair ma way, they paid for something and that something is now different.
---
Because it’s easier for tournaments? Lol what do you want, a conspiracy theory? The world doesn’t work that way, people just do the thing that gives the most reward for the least effort.
---
It’s also not explicitly better because it’s 9 fucking mana.
---
That's incredible!
---
As a player that has ACTUALLY purchase adventures and cards at one point. This is PC regressive leftist BS pisses me off.  So you attempt to grow a player base by pissing off the people who have been loyal customers?  Not a smart move.  Smells of desperation from a crappy company attempting to keep a dying game alive.
---
We already did see, see the link I posted.
---
I do :)
---
Sure. But we all know thats not the reason for the changes...
---
A quick analysis of how this card helps Un'Goro Quest cards:
---
* **Druid:** Quest Druid wants to draw cards – but it wants to draw them *after* it has completed the quest. On average, the deck tends to play around 1 card per turn before the quest is completed, which significantly decreases the need for card draw while the quest is active. I can't see Questing Explorer fitting any Quest Druid builds.
---
* **Hunter:** It is not a 1-drop minion, but it helps Quest Hunter stabilize the board on T2, *and* it replaces itself. It is hard to evaluate its potential, especially given that Quest Hunter has never been a thing, but I think it is safe to say this card will at least be worth experimenting with.
---
* **Mage:** Mage already runs a bunch of 2-drops that replace themselves in its Exodia deck. Mage is also the class that has the best unconditional draw (excluding Warlock's Hero Power), and doesn't really benefit from a 2/3 on Turn 2 as much as any of the other classes do. It will be an acceptable budget option, but other than that, I think there are much better cards in Wild for Mage to be dropping on turn 2.
---
* **Paladin:** Quest Paladin will never be a thing, but this still helps the deck quite a lot – it is a 2/3 body, on Turn 2, that can be buffed. The fact it replaces itself (and digs for a buff spell) is also quite important in Paladin, which has the inherent risk of running dry hands. 
---
* **Priest:** I play a lot of Quest Priest in Wild, and I'd say there are several different builds of this quest. Some of those builds – notably more tempo-oriented builds, have better options (Loot Hoarder, Deadringer). However, some builds rely on going big on Deathrattle minions, excluding the aforementioned 2-drops so that they don't get resurrected by N'Zoth and other Deathrattle recursion cards. For those builds, I'd say Questing Explorer is a worthy inclusion.
---
* **Rogue:** A 2/3 for 2 that can be bounced back, draws a card, and then triggers the quest? Questing Explorer will give quite the power boost to Quest Rogue in Wild, replacing the already played Novice Engineer for a much more significant body than a mere 1/1.
---
* **Shaman:** Ideally, Quest Shaman is a tempo deck that seeks to complete the quest as early as Turn 5 in some cases (I've even seen it completed on Turn 4). Every minion drop that is not a Murloc is a wasted minion drop, even if it replaces itself. On top of that, Shaman's quest reward provides tons of gas, so card generation/draw is not really an issue for the deck. It's a hard pass.
---
* **Warlock:** Lakkari Sacrifice has never, ever been a thing, and Questing Explorer won't change this fact. The card does replace itself, but that's hardly a benefit for such a badly designed quest.
---
* **Warrior:** The best Quest Warrior decks are Odd Warrior decks. Outside of that, Quest Warrior (much like Shaman) wants to complete the quest ASAP, and a minion drop without Taunt is a wasted minion drop. Still, there's one significant difference – while Shaman's quest fills your hand with cards, Quest Warrior does struggle with card draw, and slower (non-Odd) builds could potentially benefit from a 2/3 for 2 that replaces itself. My main issue is that those builds won't really be any good.
---
-------------------
---
Questing Explorer fits every new quest revealed so far, but fits only a handful of the old quests from Journey to Un'Goro. While the card provides tons of value, it either goes against a decks game plan (Druid), has much better alternatives (Mage), or won't help the deck in any significant way (Shaman). 
---
However, it is potentially deck-enabling for Quest Hunter and Quest Paladin, and definitely a huge boost to Quest Rogue in Wild, either replacing Novice Engineer, or seeing play alongside it. Based on current wild meta, I expect Quest Rogue to once again become a T2 deck after the release of this card, although it is far too early to predict anything, given we are 120 cards short of having a full picture.
---
The deadly shot change is such a waste. That poor bastard getting skewered is such an awesome piece of art.
---
Wtf lmao?
---
Wait, have you ever been to China? 😂 This doesn’t sound like a customer complaint, it’s probably a govt thing.
---
&gt; It's not really about appealling to a younger democratic
---
Everything else they've done is about appealing to that demographic. 
---
*Bursts in to song and dance*
---
...wait, you're telling me my song and dance has nothing to do with the cards or the lore?
---
I think that Tauren likes the change tho D:
---
Some of them look just better than the old ones
---
" Go woke go broke" is a term by dumb conservatives who are triggered by media Diversity. You know conservatives, the reason Succubus was removed from the game ( China is far more conservative, and Blizzard needs to market the game there) But sure we can always screech at imaginary enemies
---
&gt; As a priest you can stall easily until you play this and win
---
It’s a turn 9 board wipe. Psychic Scream wasn’t an auto-win against fast decks and Psychic Scream was turn 7 and far better than this.
---
This is especially confusing given *they already do do this*.  A couple of naxx cards have different art in china, hiding bones and such; I'm pretty sure The Skeleton Knight is one of them?
---
China basically is a younger demographic. Anything that wouldn't pass the censors for kids shows in the west won't pass the censors for anyone in China.
---
When I play DMH warrior especially I need time to think because it is a hard deck to play 
---
Rank doesn’t matter
---
The cat just made my day! 🤣
---
I don't know why you were downvoted, you are absolutely right. This card goes 100% against what Quest Druid's gameplan.
---
The more cards you have in your deck, the better Quest Druid's reward is; and before the quest's completion, Druid isn't really struggling for card draw (they play 1 card per turn, on average). After the quest's completion, it becomes a 0-mana 2/3, which sound great until you remember you are in the late game, and your deck is (presumably) full of 0-mana 8/8s, 9/9s, 4/12s, and so on.
---
I like a few of the art updates (especially Windfury Harpy) but I’m annoyed with the Succubus change. The whole tone of the card is lost.
---
It's playable. The card is that stupid.
---
Same here on Android. I can't log in since last night when the update came.
---
Implying that only men draw the artwork for the Hearthstone? Uncool and anti-feminist.
---
Wondering about the same thing
---
What? Its China. Cant they just make a Hearthstone imitation game and do what they want there? Leave our bootiful artwork alone
---
Haven't been able to play the new patch yet but we got dust for Vanish and Mind blast?

Boner culture is sad today, you can't jerk off to Hearstone cards anymore I'm sorry

Silence + shadow word pain deals with it for 2
---
thought: what if quest cards drew a card when played (instead of making this minion)? that would mean you still spend a turn and mana casting the quest, but arent down in card advantage
---
Damn. What kind?
---
I don’t think your wild priest deck needs a 9 mana board clear though.
---
Actually, you reminded me of that 2/3 enrage minion. His quote is "Iz time for little **blood**, hehe". Will they change the poor fella *again*?

His face looks a little goofy
---
If you queue up another game after it kicks you back to the main menu it’ll actually reconnect you to your previous game
---
0/5 for design and balance since it doesn't fit the theme of an effect on all minions, and is horribly underpowered, and would never see play, even for 5 mana.
---
I smell
---
It’s not a massive change to the core of the game, but it allows Hearthstone to remain viable in one of the largest economies in the world... so yeah, that will grow the player base.
---
I’m sad about Headcrack artwork changes, but it’s sure as Hell not leftist. A leftist approach would be making Edwin topless and giving Reno special voice lines about being turned on whenever a banana gets played 🤣
---
But seriously, it’s such a minor change. If you want more porn to compensate for your losses, I can direct you to some other sites.
---
Finally, a nerf to N’Zoth!
---
Everyone did
---
You can do what I do and make a new account every time a new expansion drops and use the free legendary cards to craft a new deck so you don’t have to dust anything on your main account
---
&gt; there are not only 9 classes, Ysera and Lk cards are counted as class  cards too. If there are more card like LK printed, burgle bonus effects  have to be revisited. 
---
Nope. To be clear, to this day, "Death Knight cards" (from Lich King or Arfus) DO trigger "from another class" synergies, whereas "Dream cards" (from Ysera) DON'T.
---
This is yet another inconsistency in how Team5 handled this whole thing.
---
On top of this, "Death Knight cards" have nothing to do with "Death Knights" (the Hero cards). And "Dream cards" are visually identical to HUNTER class cards, *for some reason*, despite being considered neutral. They just like to make it as confusing and inconsistent as possible, it would seem.
---
I'd much rather have all of these cards count as neutral (and Ysera's cards should actually *look* like neutral), and have Jade Lotus cards count as from another class. it makes much more sense than a neutral spell generated by a neutral card somehow counting as "from another class".
---
Holy anicent meme batman
---
I think the heroes and villians will just be the art on the Quests tbh. I don't think they'd print a third Elise this quick
---
I found the answer : https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/c7w3v5/new_card_art_for_old_cards/

If Pokemon shouldn’t it be “Victory or Faint!” and “I choose Faint!” (tho I doubt anyone has ever **chosen** to faint irl. Death? Yes, but faint, hmmm)
---
Yes, I am just stuck on loading screen on android. Planning on re-installing later today, but the update is clearly botched.
---
 If you died or something happened to you, I would delete your browser history for you :)
---
I hate this non interactive quest shit. My personal opinion, not saying it is bad design.
---
You draw cards, complete quest, high roll with new hero power. Nothing can stop you except killing you fast enough.
---
I would like a word with the entire South.
---
I get what you are saying but that’s not the case in this situation. They aren’t just changing sexualized characters, they are also changing violence and any depictions of blood. And it’s not for western audiences, it’s for China.
---
I think Fal'dorei Strider's cards used to draw a card, but now since it was changed to "casts when drawn" it doesn't draw a card anymore.
---
Or if he have an almost full hand and you let him discard 4/3 cards.

BattleTag: Chris#112503, you can add me in-game (will be online for a while) or message me on Reddit!
---
Except the inexplicable eviscerate change I like these almost across the board.  All the new art is a lot more crisp than the old version.
---
The biggest change is maybe the Succubus becoming a Felhound, but thematically we have other felhounds that relate to discard already.  I hope to see a new succubus with some kind of CC effect maybe.
---
There is no accidental sexism

&gt;doesnt nerf card featuring blood, boobs, AND a skeleton in the background
---
🤔
---
Can't forget gallywix
---
True, true, but I think a 5/5 here or 4/4 for 6 mana would still be okay and not overpowered.
---
Don't see any potential for it..
---
Younger demographic*
---
hey i mean the first 4 cards are kind of a nutty 10 mana combo
---
Are you ok?
---
I mean, if we're going by flavour/stuff that makes sense on the level of story/characterisation, the only hero power that suits her bookish/inquisitive/fearless but non-aggressive persona is Warlock's IMO.
---
Druids are not the evil class tho
---
0 points on design

0 point on balance, too weak

Endvora#2690 - EU, trading 80g quest. I show, you go first.

Pretty sure they just receive a vague description of the image needed which in this case could've been "loads of creatures dying in a desert". I don't think they receive the card name/info.
---
Thank you, you are to kind!
---
Yeah, I'm on mobile, dunno why it did that.
---
who the fuck would think that daily quests would changes the cards
---
jaina's outfit is still quite good though. And sylvannas only issue i have is that the brown midrif doesnt fit rest of her outfit at all colourswise but yeah youre right.

It's most likely the quest reward!

Did anyone see how much dust they got for them?
---
What if you play yogg, he casts this, then kills himself and subsequently resurrects himself as part of the 10 spells. Does he keep going with his battlecry?
---
I'm OOTL on this. What happened?
---
Probably some dept of the chinese media authority noticed the blood and stuff on the tiny cards. Thats a big no no in china 
---
Dota had a similar incident a while back where they changed the icons of the chinese server to be less bloody, and not to depict skulls, to be more friendly.
---
The fact that they only changed a few cards probably means theyre doing this little bit to appease that small group making noise, and probably followed a list of some cards they highlighted.
---
i dont know if you've ever seen eve in game but she is definitely the most revealing champ in game, she's literally naked in stealth form
---
Can we have something for Brawl now, please? It is much more relevant because DMH warrior exists
---
needs more 6/6 trample dino
---
It could cast Deck of Wonders and then draw though.
---
It’s probably safer to wait but Luna’s pocket galaxy isn’t a bad card if you need it. There might be a mage card/cards that change how mage is played though and Luna’s might not see much play.
---
I got to Legend this month using Token Druid without breaking a sweat this hard (I can recall much harder climbs), what exactly is wrong with druid?
---
Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, wiped all the data, still no luck.
---
In Bulgarian it ends in "t" also: Стандарт. There is even a newspaper called "Standart": www.standartnews.com
---
You're not, it would make minions unplayable since it fills the board, and being 1/5, they are not easy to kill by smashing them against each other. It's a great stalling card, definitely has potential.
---
Both as I always do. I usually do it day 1 but I don't have much money now so will be doing it next month.
---
Oh you know it! I’m so hyped for the new expansion!!
---
I won't do it this time but 50 packs bundle is good for the golden legendary value. I have a pretty satisfying collection and I never enjoyed playing quests so I pass on that expansion's pre-order but it sure feels better than the bundles in RoS and RR.
---
Leave her alone, she is already dead :/
---
Wait, she could not have given herself stealth.

You're right. Kids shouldn't learn things because we want them to be taken by surprise later in life. Because God and morals.

Yep just was about to perform lethal and this happened to me, very frustrating!!
---
Yeah I really feel like mega bundle buyers will be happy with this pre-order, Elise looks pretty cool.
---
User posted about a way to modify the ingame art, which is against the game’s ToS.
---
And if the assumption that it was for China is just mindless xenophobia and this was actually for ESRB ratings...?
---
Blizzard did this for commercial reasons. Nobody censored them, it's good old capitalism at work. Just like CDPR removed nudity and sex scenes from Witcher games to get a better ESRB rating in the USA.
---
Taunt. Taunt. Taunt. Taunt. Taunt.
---
Which bundle?

&gt;but it sure feels better than the bundles in RoS and RR.

It really does

I love your card and I say that as somebody that has played MtG since beta!!!!! Combining wrath of god and damnation in the title was a nice touch!!!!!

They didn't really hate the humans, they didn't do what the orcs did to the Night Elves. Jaina settled far to the south in a swamp the NEs didn't really care about so she didn't disturb the Night Elves much, like the orcs did. 
---
The humans also hated the orcs, so it's only logical for the Night Elves to ally with them to fight off the encroaching orcs and their allies.

I'll buy just the 50€ one because I'm a teen who's only source of money is working in summer, so 80€ is too much for me unfortunately. Hopefully we both get lucky with our packs:)
---
My mobile doesnt work lmAo
---
Huh, it's almost like they could censor future cards and just make it so offending territories have censored version of existing art. Like every other game ever... 
---
Of course this is Blizzard.
---
How to trigger it:
---
1. Make sure you're on mobile.
---
2. Make sure you have a notification that you can click on.
---
3. Launch Hearthstone app.
---
4. Wait until you see the gates and click on the notification.
---
5. Press the home button to minimize whatever you just open.
---
6. Launch Hearthstone again.
---
7. After a few seconds you should hear the "open" sound before it finishes loading
---
8. Done.
---
To fix the bug either relaunch the game or just click on play.

Thanks to both. Didnt recognize the treasure, I thought I had played enough to see them all.

Card text should always be consistent no matter what. Flavor is good and all but only if you can do it within PSCT limitations

I’m surprised you can even log in. Been unable to for 8+ hours now.

Good luck! &lt;3
---
Blizzard is consistently inconsistent.
---
Repeat after me. Fuck China. Fuck the Chinese.
---
Hmm, moldy
---
Rastakhan's Ramble works too
---
Wow.. that's a pretty serious card
---
They're not. They're floating there.
---
So this is what "sorting by controversial" looks like
---
I got a good idea.
---
Quest: Play 4 Pogo Hoppers
---
Passive Hero Power: Add a 'pre-pre-nerf-Crystal Core' to your hand
---
Now, I think it would be broken in Druid, Warlock, Mage, Hunter, Priest, Paladin, Shaman and Warrior, so we should put it in Rogue, based on my superior opinion.
---
There's a perfect card, in my opinion, and that's really all that matters
---
Clear and obviously understandable rules is pretty much what blizzard doesn't do. So many niche situations you have to learn on your own how it works.
---
"We didn't realise that the fuck-demon might be too sexy for our card game for children"
---
Yeah, that's why I thought it was was just meant as something fun, because usually their video editing is good
---
Runespear or something I think.
---
Most probably double-gold from your quests. It was like this in both 2017 and 2018. On average this nets you around ~800-900 extra gold.
---
I crafted every legendary Golden for this reason. Fuck blizzard
---
What an absolute unit
---
Yeah, right. World is not that perfect, unfortunately.
---
Because that’s literally why people here are upset, because there’s slightly less animated cleavage. They think for some reason they think the only people that should be catered to is their incel ass who wants to see big titty dragon women all over.
---
That's actually an amazing idea....
---
Kinda like Rafaam was in Zoo, giving a more aggressive deck a chance in the late game..
---
Love it
---
And that would be such a fun deck to play....
---
I would Craft It Golden, with no Penniless Player references intended.
---
Nope, and custom hearthstone cards don't have a way to have the artist credit up on the card in a natural way like custom mtg cards (which require it for submitting to reddit). The artist is Erikas Perl, the name of the piece is 'koksmosas' I believe.
---
How can I have this artwork alone ?
---
Me and my son make custom cards for mtg for fun. Good times.
---
You are right -- it's just like the SN1P SN4P and Reckless Experimenter interaction -- Blizzard must have overlooked it.  I just theorycrafted an OP Togwaggle Druid deck with Auctioneer and Plague.  I'll bet Blizzard changes the card description before it goes live.
---
Well, can't really say yet because only few cards have been revealed. If the Set seems good and balanced, I might buy The 50 pack bundle.
---
I bet it's the quest reward for whatever class  reno is in. Since elise is holding the artifact, which is shown in the druid quest.
---
People just need to stop circlejerking about this. Blizzard gave us more info than we ask for for once and people are just getting whiny. This is why companies will often just never give any news or updates or insights on their design.
---
People are still failing to understand that just because these classes traditionally have these weaknesses and strengths doesn’t prohibit them from getting some change ups every expansion to you know, keep the game fresh...
---
Thanks! Been wanting to try out a Priest deck for a while now, and this looks like just what I needed : )
---
Also like REAL BIG creatures?
---
:,(
---
That's what it amounts to. If you don't agree, reconsider your beliefs.
---
Mass dispel is just miles better against mech paladin than this will ever be.
---
What is the complete list of cards/heroes changed?
---
also my child keeps complaining about bad purple, so I repainted their walls to a different shade of purple, Im down a LOT of money blizzard, wtf
---
And people will only run Apothecaries and Howlfiends, as minions in their decks, in Wild
---
Oh my god the Sax is playing in my head again.
---
Hell, add Weasels and Gruul to give them a chance.
---
Or maybe having 6 copies of blood of the BANCIENT ONE in your deck, and 1 Drakkari Enchanter(if that works, which I think it should) and then playing Togwaggle+this.
---
good job China
---
good job Activision .
---
So I guess it will be called ultimate infestation?
---
They also need something for the early game like spirit lash or shadow word horror, and something to do on turn 2 besides heal. They could use a new hero card more than any other class, or they need a strong win condition card like conjurer's calling. Or both.
---
'Your next Hero Power this turn costs 1'
---
How absolutely ridiculous. What an absolute waste of time
---
Same
---
Yea I think so too, I want to see the card in play
---
I feel like the removal of self-damage is the biggest draw for the new hero power - in a close match, Warlocks often get denied card draw due to their steadily lowering health. This way, they can keep fishing for a game-ending play while only having to worry about fatigue.
---
Nah, I was saying that the art is incredibly bland and non evocative, but fits in nicely with current trends.
---
WT
---
So what? How are people not understanding the concept that just because a class is TRADITIONALLY having certain strengths and weaknesses doesn’t mean it can’t temporarily have cards that change these through expansions. It actually makes the game more fresh and enjoyable.
---
Oh, no problems, let's just give a struggling class a board clear that's in the worst rarity to craft it, EVERY SINGLE TIME.
---
To top it off, make it 9 mana instead of eight
---
Idk it's fair..
---
as long as you state your drop rates :D 
---
\- china
---
Its really not complex at all.
---
You have cards, you read them and decide what to play.
---
And as a matter of opinion the others guys anology was much better than yours.
---
Your anology litterally just explained and a phrase with two meaning, how in the world does that help people better understand the new card?
---
Huh? How'd you get that?
---
*WAVING!?!* think of the disabled people with no arms!
---
Too much skin is showing.  Her eyes need to be covered.
---
I guess is toki
---
Keep making these 🙏
---
what's that classical song at the start?
---
Because of the way business in China works, Hearthstone is licensed and run by a completely different company. They have an entirely separate launcher, official deck tracker, region specific accounts, etc.
---
The differences in China aren't Blizzard favoring China, they're Blizzard operating differently than the company that runs HS in China
---
And i am not even trying to argue that they should bring back the nudity, tbh i couldn’t care less, it’s just a game, but from a social standpoint this tells so much. 
---
perhaps call me prude but digital art often focuses on very specific body images in both sexes imo. don’t give me that ‘for our younger audience‘ argument if you lack consistency in a new standard...
---
Every class gets a quest that rewards a new hero power.
---
&gt; I would refund only those who actually crafted the card
---
imo that's completely fair.
---
&gt; pleonasm
---
Eschew obfuscation, compadre. Eschew it.

2/3/2 | After you cast a spell, deal 1 damage to ALL minions.  
---
I don't think 4 8/8's by turn 5 should be a thing.
---
What I find more problematic, however, is how polarized removal options become against this scenario.
---
A successful Khadgar's calling on turn 5 wins the game against the majority of opponents. Warrior's with brawl in hand barely break a sweat.
---
The real issue becomes apparent when you generate an equally sized board on e.g. turn 10-15. Instead of simply clearing it, the warrior is now able to clear it AND develop. A board clear which is that indifferent to the minion's toughness should not allow for additional development on the same turn.
---
Only the hero card is annoying. But I'll still take a control meta with that card in it over another boring tempo/aggro/combo meta where every game is just matchup/card draw based.
---
It happened for like an hour then stopped for me
---
Because China passed new censorship laws (specifically no blood and no suggestive themes) and Blizzard cares more about that market at this point.
---
I'm dead...I love when blizz does something that makes this sub turn into a meme fiesta
---
Hellfire, and even defile, are great examples of balanced boardwipes. They can be used early to clear an aggressive board yet become significantly worse in the late game.
---
Having removal which can be used to both clear aggro boards early yet have the same effect against high health late game minions are simply poorly designed.
---
Why do you even care? The new art looks cool, and most of them are terrible cards anyway.
---
I still don’t know what’s going on in Poison Seeds
---
Amen.
---
I like charge, there should never be many charge cards available but the mechanic is useful and iconic to Hunter class with cards such as Huffer, Unleash, and everyone's favourite dino - King Krush!
---
The text should be "Tiananmen" instead of "Taunt".
---
I mean, this looks good
---
But it's too expensive to combo with power of the wild at 6 mana. 
---
2 stars
---
Summon ogers
---
It also has magnetic though. His card says the boomsday set, but because he was introduced not part of an actual set, but in the middle of one, blizzard decided to make him belong to all set that were standard when he was first introduced. Thats why he has a keyword from to different expansions. They still needed something to put on the card, and they also made it the set he would rotate out with, I'm guessing they went with boomsday instead of witchwood because hes also a mech
---
Why exactly does this make the community toxic??
---
I wonder how they're going to sell that to the Chinese. Silence and Destroy all minions, they might feel targeted.
---
How many people own a golden headcrack? I don't think I do, but I think that those who crafted it should be reimbursed.
---
If Blizzard keeps track on how you gained the card (opened it vs crafted it) then I'm fine that only those who crafted it will get their money back. If Blizzard did not keep track it's on them, and they should reimburse everyone with the golden version of the card.
---
I used to like golden Evis because it shows the blood spattering...
---
Bah. I don't have the connection speed to re-download all 600 gbs of this game right now.

---
There's a theory going around that it's Reno's hands in the art for the Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron—plus, it just may turn out that his true identity is actually Renogos, Blue Dragon.
---
If that's the case maybe make it a minion
---
More like king krush

---
This guy:  ( ͡° ͜◯ ͡°) ﻿*CLOWN FIESTA* ( ͡° ͜◯ ͡°)
---
Spending 2 to get a 2/3 and draw a card is 100% better than spending 2 to get a card and taking 2 damage, for sure. But the choice isn't "run this card or run nothing", we have to compare it to every other possible resource that Warlock could be running instead. And I think there's likely going to be far better choices for control than a premium-statted 2 drop.
---
Yeah, I don't know why China is catching all the flack here, this is Blizzard's doing, they don't have to kow-tow to Chinese pressure and even if they did you can do it locally, as they have altered art for them in the past.
---
Truly pathetic fromn Blizzard, I honestly find this more annoying than Jade Druid.
---
Moorabi it is.
---
Blizzard bent the knee to China’s demands because they’re push overs.
---
You got me there.
---
Old secret keeper was beautiful, and actually looked like she is hiding something. New secret keeper is Generic MOBA Hero Card Art #538520.
---
That's understandable, but a lot of people do a lot more than pointing out and it really rubs off as letting Blizzard off the hook when I can easily see this being the result of Blizzard's internal politics instead of Chinese pressure. It'd be in line with how they moderate other things like their Twitch chat and esport sections.
---
It would be too similar to the [lifesteal board icon](
---
https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/2/25/Lifesteal_ss.jpg?version=ab5cc0932f24722109fc33e59532ca66) no?

Sacrebleu!
---
All your favorite cards to play with still function in the same way.
---
Probably Luna.
---
I just played a hunter and they used a golden Deadly shot and the picture was white, it didnt have any graphics on the card at all.. just blank.
---
Agreed: this whole thing is less about China and more about a push from within Blizzard to make their Hearthstone stuff more consistently kid-friendly.

Damn, came over her face

I saved 17 packs and got a regular and a golden legendary, so my luck was definitely above average there.

I bet it was from HUD.
---
Is it great to be able to look down on the masses? These people aren't High IQ deckbuilders like you and I. These filthy netdeckers need to copy and paste instructions on how to tie their shoes.
---
What he said makes perfect sense. There are cards that generate "infinite" value such as Rexxar or this guy - they are not limited by resources such as cards in your deck. Mana Tide Totem is not such a card.
---
So there's no need to think about the span of your life, just consider the game as that's obviously what's being discussed.
---
This quest could work in Jade druid, you don't have to rush the quest. And let it complete "naturally" it would still be powerful late game.
---
I like new secretkeeper better because of dat midriff

At this point just close shop and join us.

Blizzard saw your deck, and, terrified of what you had wroguht, hurried to nerf it. Be proud friend!

So only one I think I like is Eviscerate and think it's because it still looks similar to the old art... Hearthstone, why D:

I see what they are trying to do but still makes me sad that the old arts are going.
---
Oh wow thanks....must have been a recent announcement didn't even see it....and now it's like right up at the top....just bad timing I guess lol thanks for the response.
---
This point of view makes no sense - because if your goal is to make a more gender neutral product you shouldn't be viewing it from the male point of view at all.
---
Is there any evidence in thw wrold of video games so far that following your line of thought increases sales to women? From a business point of view if you are gonig to stop pandering to your obvious  15-35 male target deomgraphic you have to make up the numbers elsewhere.
---
Both cater to the Male fantasy 
---
Which is why I fucking hate video games.
---
True
---
They are about equally strong. For Warlock two words, "Plot Twist", for druid just offset your curve for the first four or five turns. Warlock is stronger, but costs mana. The reason they are quest rewards is now you can work and get them as permanent buffs, not only that but tome of origination is BETTER than the legendary as it doesn't cost health.
---
trogg very nice&lt;3
---
Yes on android.. it looks like many players are expiriencing the same thing..
---
Thats a gun, to inflict a violent act. Any implication of violent acts is to be avoided in the games card art. Those crystals look sharp - change them to multi-coloured bunnies and you can have it.
---
No, but Divine Spirit + Inner Fire dunks on unrefined decks which is probably your case.
---
Then how come artwork has changed for my English client in EU?
---
I'd rather not leave an excessive amount of room open for someone to make mistakes if I can help it. As such, if that button were to be added, it would need to be buried in the collection menus and gated behind several confirmation warnings.
---
Money talks and businesses aren't usually squeemish about dealing with evil governments. That said, card art changes are down at the lowest priority when it comes to things to be pissed off at China's government. If someone wasn't worked up by the manifest and numerous human rights violations, I don't want to hear how bent out of shape they are that some boobies got extra coverage in card art.
---
The problem is the raw size of the arrow.
---
it depends if they have beards or not for me
---
Sn1p-Sn4p doesn't have charge, not an exodia
---
Can someone clarify quickly for me something about the new quests? Does the reward have to be played with some mana cost as previous rewards did, or does simply completing the quest automatically update your hero power?
---
wow. that was really bad
---
Wouldn't actually be the same card. Disciple is an overall better card as you can trigger it's deathrattle with various cards.
---
In some niche cases this a Reborn Rager would be better (can't be silenced by [[Defias Cleaner]])
---
Maybe the cards will be weaker, but I just think they're going to be better cards. Quests were pretty much trash because they were either really weak or just game-winning if you got the reward. And you had to build your deck around it. The way they seem to be doing it now gives space to just be good cards.
---
I think it's because the art did get swapped for some reason I can't remember.
---
Gnomish inventor represents an angry chicken while angry chicken represents a polymorphed chicken from gnomish inventor

You should check out new player questions thread every Tuesday. There are some real gems.

In two years Multishot is going to see the light again

If I'm mentally disabled because I'd like cards to do what they say then that's the case
---
Weakness doesn't mean none at all.
---
Shaking my head my head
---
Well boys we did it, the T rating is no more
---
&gt; If the quest is in my hand I control it, I’m in control of whether I play it or not.
---
lol
---
Any priest hero power they can use for more than "heal 2 hp" would be nice (hell, "give minion +2 health" would be better, because you don't need to wait for minion to get dama... oh, the enemy killed it before it could be healed)
---
Rafaam is still my favourite Hearthstone villain. For a reason.
---
Did I miss something ?? Is hearthstone PG-13 now  or what
---
No. If you see the changes they include the mistress of pain and succubus. Those are not really a problem with China because as of now there's already a different set of art assets on the Chinese client. It seems to be a push to lower ESRB ratings. American censos if you will.
---
They don't draw anymore when you cast them. The new "cast when drawn" keyword makes the draw part of the auto-cast effect. The older stuff did draw a card when played from hand, but that was because that draw effect was in the card itself.
---
That would need to be on some absolutely bonkers requirement. Endless spell generation would be absolutely broken.
---
may i introduce you to shadowform
---
I have only one question, and its the same one I asked about the Tavern Brawl changes.  Why now?  What makes now so important?  The game has been out for years now, and all of a sudden it is an issue?
---
Same with the tarern brawls.  Going from 2 days downtime to 1 hour downtime really just makes you ask: why now?  Why couldn't it have been implemented a couple years ago?
---
Completing the quest automatically updates the hero power.
---
Also cast while drawn cards count, so the portal keepers might help that out plus the support they give it in this expansion.
---
While I Ancient Jump
---
My guess is that they've automated a lot of the steps that used to be manual.
---
Man, my friends and I referenced this SO much when it first came out. Especially "This is CAKE TOWN!"
---
&gt;as unhinderd as possible i
---
Having to bow to censorship demands is an hindrance in their creative options
---
half these changes are great half these are a travesty
---
Also could throw in [redemption] somewhere in there
---
Deck and hand rush... then all new generations won't. This will also make warriors play Boom later so they can get the omega assembly off first for the rush. I think that's an okay compromise but I don't think they need a nerf in general especially since the meta is not favoring them anymore with conjure mage, mech hunter etc. everywhere.
---
Yeah it's terrible art any way you look at it.
---
I wouldn’t 100% count this out as a possibility, but I’d doubt it. Cards like Godfrey have different art in China to appeal to censors there. Most likely it’s for a more child friendly rating.
---
You should learn the current expansions that active in arena if you want to get the most out of arena. Currently the meta is fast and drafting for curve minion is crucial to an arena run success.
---
You forgot to mention your region
---
Control warrior mirrors are actually my favorite match to play, IF I only get like 1 every 2 weeks, since it takes like 30-45 minutes.
---
I think the solution here with things like this (Barnes, Muckmorpher, Shadowdancer) is that the the stat overwrite persists in death (and resurrection).
---
In the most recent single player campaign, Blizz showed they had the code base to re-write stats in a way they persisted. The Barnes effect is alot less scary when you resurrect 1/1 Ragnaros.
---
Came here to see if I was the only one
---
I am at work right now and I can't view sites because of our work firewall privacy block. I missed the update yesterday, so whats the deal with this "Reborn" Mechanic in the new expansion? Is it litterally just replacing the "Deathrattle" text or is it diffrent than Deathrattle?
---
Also could throw in [[redemption]] somewhere in there
---
I thought that's her sternocleidomastoid muscle
---
It’s not at all unlikely if they wanted to maintain consistency across regions. This isn’t a minor modification like adding a sleeve to a skeleton. 
---
And the title says people are wrong. Not that it’s unlikely.
---
I'm admittedly a hearthstone only (and nloot a WoW) lore dover, but for this beast, I'd recommend "Jade Sun", said in one of the races of Azeroth's mother tongue.
---
The art on the bottom is absolute trash though
---
as long as they don't touch my precious armorsmith...
---
Then its just worse than the priest one that was already revealed.
---
they always underestimate our resolve
---
"Hey little boy. Want some candy?"
---
That kinda reminds me when I was a kid and was playing with toy nunchucks and always end up hitting myself in the face.
---
Yeah if there were the same proportions of women in bikinis as men in speedos, it wouldn’t be an issue.
---
Shhhh don’t give them any ideas

China 🤝 SJWs

Have you ever done dev? Over time, complex processes can be simplified as you add automation to take care of manual tasks.
---
🤔🤔🤔Its like different games have different audiences and art styles 🤔🤔🤔
---
Yeah a lot of people can't play hearthstone in mobile
---
Are you fucking kidding me? Mistress of pain and succubus, one of the most beautiful drawn cards, being removed for CENSORSHIP? Mistress looks covered up for the most part. And don’t turn succubus into a fucking beast.

EU Server Trading 80g. I'll show the quest but you go first.
---
Lol, of course. And did you know that blizzard has sold no packs, made zero dollars on hearthstone with a decent classic set? Of course, given that no one would ever spend money on hearthstone in its current state, they have to take drastic measures!
---
I can see how you thought that but it is to high and deep to be.
---
Ya I occasionally use it (if I play Priest in the first place), though rarely get to draw it
---
I like the fact that hearthstone is free to play, with no subscriptions. I like hearthstone interface. I like hearthstone card template. Well, hearthstone, yes. Blizzard, not so much. I like druid, but wild growth nerf is just fundamentally changed druid.
---
Upvote.
---
A few cards had their card art change.
---
And while no explanation was given, this sub, in its infinite wisdom, is convinced that it was done to cater to Chinese communists and 4-year-olds
---
Fatigue as a Wincon is fine aka Control Warrior. Control Priest usually win vs Control Warrior in the mirror. Becasue Priest can do gay stuff like steal half of the warrior guy deck, while CW depends on removals but Control Priest have no threat
---
Because it’s not about China and people need to scream their jingoism somewhere
---
Wait is T actually for 7 and up? Why do they call it Teen then?
---
I mean the whole plot of the last two expansions is "Let's rehash our Hearthstone characters", it shouldn't be surprising the mechanics are rehashed too.
---

A second Cursed Disciple would do wonders for my Jungle Giants deck. I am praying for a card like this!
---
Not sure about that one. I think all online games that have direct messaging system are T-rated, but Hearthstone doesn't have direct messaging (it has chat with friends, but I'm not sure if that applies).
---
All led by Colonel Mustard... with the candlestick in the Library
---
BAL_BUTTON
---
Kobolds and Catacombs
---
Plus a minimum of 8 you drew at the start of the previous turns... I think we've probably finished the quest before we get this perfect combo, but it's fun to speculate.
---
But guys being topless is basically the equivalent of a thong? I dont get what you mean, also most card art only ever shows the top part of a character. I dont get why you're getting mad when its just a card game
---
Guys can we stop already I don't like it too but it's not that big of a deal some of new cards look nice and some are ridiculous.
---
&gt;I don't know how they will support Murlock decks without card generation
---
Or ANY tribal deck, unless they're going to just print a bunch of card draw (boring, but effective) or board refill (generally reserved for Druid with a little Warlock and Hunter). Shaman has always struggled with weaving between card draw/generation and board presence because of Overload and having an almost entirely medium to low damage-based removal arsenal (Shaman has always struggled against minions with more than 3 health). I don't think their definition of Shaman as a class really fits within the actual game right now, certainly not with Shaman's current Classic card set.

I've just opened 15, best I got was golden head crack (rip) and a normal Gladiator's longbow.
---
Sorry haven't taken time to screenshot :/
---
Rofl! Bigotry IN the art? You are so precious. Need a safe space?
---
This is easily one of my favorite cards printed lol. It was so annoying for aggro to deal with if you could get it out and I loved it.
---
Talked about it in one of the comments, i dont think cutlass is strong enough, and it will require a lot of card changes to support it. 
---
Have fun with the deck!
---
Spheres are notoriously poorly optimized, hence the insult.
---
I'm thinking Vargoth and plot twist is what kills it. You don't need a full hand but you will need 6 cards + Vargoth and plot twist to pull this off by turn 6 which is pretty damn close.
---
Don't forget glorious Chinese money
---
Succubus, Deadly Shot, Bite, Secretkeeper, Windfury Harpy, Mistress of Pain, Eviscerate, Headcrack, Valeera Sanquinar.
---
Yes. Secret keeper wasn t good. She was the best.
---
Her artwork was a meme itself and that is what made her cool.
---
Also live munition. It is rightfully called a massacre, because estimated deaths are somewhere around 2000 people.
---
Blizz. 5 year olds aren’t the ones preordering lots of $$ for bundles. Make people happy and add a toggle on the art in Europe and North America servers. If people are so offended by the art, that way they can toggle it, and people who like O.G. hearthstone can stick to it
---
They changed the text?
---
Someone is trying to push an agenda.
---
Thank you! I could craft the "Mech Hunter" only need Zillax and Sn1p Sn4p and 2 rares
---
Wdym you don’t understand Morgl?

I'm currently having the same issue on Android.
---
Which is dumb
---
Also you can still see the bone in Eviscerate lmao
---
Hey thanks.\^\^  
---
Okay but thats a long time.. u think I should craft the mech hunter? Zillax and Sn1p Sn4p.. idk if its worth
---
Ketchuplust
---
Your best bet is to start saving your gold for the new expansion. Even if you buy the welcome pack, having 20-30 more packs will get you going right away when it launches.
---
It's really great to be able to join in the fun of those first few days while everyone figures it out.
---
Ok.  Here's a few new prevalent mechanics that have happened since then:
---
Rush:  Can attack minions on the turn they are summoned.
---
Magnetic:  Mechs that can be played as minions, or as buffs to other Mechs.
---
Lackey:  1 mana token minions with powerful battlecries, mostly in Priest / Rogue / Shaman / Warrior / Warlock.  We will be seeing more Lackey tokens released over the course of the year.
---
As for cards, while this one will only be in Standard for the next 9 months, [[Zilliax]] appears in the most decks as quick removal / taunt / lifegain, plus extra boosts in Mech oriented decks.
---
Post them on Imgur and send the link
---
Golden versions of affecetd should be refuned imo. Goldens are there only for cosmetic and since they changed the card its fiar imo to refund.

5/3/2 Mech | Magnetic Divine Shield, Taunt, Lifesteal, Rush  
---
best music for any hearthstone expansion period.
---
What if you're a serial killer though.
---
I agree with the video. The reasons for sending mind blast to the HoF were inconsistent, arbitrary and makes the worst class in standard even worse, not only by replacing it with a terrible spell that will see virtually no play barring exceptional circumstances but by leaving other cards without purpose.
---
I für I brought that on myself &gt;.&lt;
---
Then talk about the their expansion man. A few cards won't make tons of posts but art censorship is more meme friendly and sparks more discussion.
---
Yeah it's like a generic mage from a CHINESE game
---
&gt; Skeleton king was because of blizzard posturing to sue on copyright infringements.
---
I never understood how people thought it was China. He was literally called "Leoric, the Skeleton King" and the models where really similar.
---
So happy to hear youre having fun with it! 
---
The mulligan is basically - againts aggro- hardddd mulligan for miscreants, keep zilliax, and keep underbelly if you got an activator for her. 
---
Againts control- look for foxes and hench clan, also againts warrior keep your scheme since its the win play
---
Honestly Ketchupworm made me laugh the most cause I just imagine the card art was just given to a 5 year old and was told to name it.
---
Should be good now
---
They remove your giant. Then what?
---
 Most of the time you aren't going to be able to conjuring and giant on the same turn, unless you hit a giant with Galaxy. Only thing I'd worry about as warrior would be if you got a ton of fireballs off of a cheap Antonidas or a cheap Malygos with a bunch of burn.
---
People on internet spending their life trying to find a reason to be upset. Nothing new here.
---
for normal versions yeah, but goldens no since theyre purely cosmetic the goldens and since they where changed they should be refunded.
---
Good Joke
---
Hearthstone has been available in China for years already.
---
A small indie company like this just can't afford that kind of manpower!
---
Better change it into Angry Felhound to be safe

This is why we only have 18 deckslots.

He was there for its beginnings, and rightly predicted the inevitable outcome of such an ideology. Yes, decades before it played out in real life.
---
People don't like it when they can't have things.  Especially when they did have things and don't have them anymore.  Even if its something utterly unimportant.
---

---
/r/sino is the pro-Chinese government party subreddit
---
Well there is evidence that chinese HS already has different card arts, which speaks against your claim
---
Wow, thanks!  
---
So i guess zillax is worth to craft, maby i'll craft the mechhunter.
---
It's like the Kent State shooting on a massively larger scale.
---
I’ve put enough money into it. (About 500 bucks since UnGoro. Im saving gold right now, and will probably end up with 4000 gold at launch. So I almost have the pre-order ammount.
---
In before 8.3 patch notes "Blackrock Depths: Replaced Nagmara with Felhunter".
---
I mean, if you don't people will sjtu call you winnie the pooh, and if you ban him they will do the same. It's almost like you can't win while being a dictatorial asshole.
---
I play mech Hunter without legendaries but Zilliax is a good card in almost every deck so you should craft Zilliax
---
Hahahaha cRiMiNaL, i can understand that people loved the old art but it's very very funny how childish everyone is
---
Oh, I haven't seen this post when making mine

Not the text.  Before the card couldn't be used when there weren't enough targets, but that rule has changed.  Also applies to Cleave, Forked Lightning, and Dark Bargain.

The odds are in your favor friend. Elise is druid, therefore of the remaining,who would be a mage? We know the classes are Mage, Druid, Paladin, and Hunter. Brann, Reno, and Finley remain.

Oh wow, nice edit. But Blizzard, please don't actually change whirlwind
---
Yes, sorry, I was alluding to Vanish being HoF'ed. Thx for your informative reply though!
---
It's not that. Chinese people are not aloud to speak about politics freely online without consequence. Chinese people were for a time getting around this by referring to their president as Pooh but of course the government figured this out eventually and banned all images and references to the character. A bunch of other random shit is banned in China for similar reasons, including the letter "N" at one point.
---
0/10

Doesn't fit class identity.

I wonder what do all these art criers do, when their favorite band changes a member.
---
You can bounce the reborn copy and replay it to get its reborn ability back.
---
Ikr why do we even exist as a sub if this one won’t let us have fun
---
Do you have a source on this? Do you know if it will be paid as well?
---
Obviously
---
I think China just picks apart some of the cards that don't meet their criteria and Blizzard just changes them accordingly 
---
But I'm just talking out of my ass right now so I don't actually know how they decide things
---
I did say taunt, but it is a 4/6, not 5/4.
---
You need to get laid bro
---
Added to the pool of existing lackeys was my understanding of it
---
Maybe they don’t want to admit that they’re wrong? 
---
That’s how this situation seems to me, they just don’t want to admit they swapped the card arts at one point and are covering a mistake?
---
Like come on blizzard, just switch the card art, it really can’t be that hard.
---
Was he? Thought it was different in the early days.
---
"Assuming direct control."
---
Thoughts on the reborn keyword? At first glance, I'm not sure I'm a fan. It feels a bit bland and if you aren't able to activate it on your turn, 1 health isn't too hard to deal with.
---
lol this is rank 18 the plays aren’t that deep
---
since the hero power has a cost and isnt a passive i assumed that only cards drawn with the hero power get the cost reduction. am i wrong ?
---
That’s the thing though - it’s sooooo unlikely. The only reason I made this post is because in 10 matches or so of playing Zuljin since the patch yesterday, the spells have never hit me adversely. Even when the opponent doesn’t have minions (and I do) spells will hit them in the face. Maybe I am crazy lucky, but the sample size isn’t exactly small...
---
Hag is offensive, change it up. You know there are chilren playing
---
6e rules made it so that Abeyance prevented you from tapping lands for mana, as tapping them was an activated ability. Before that, you could still tap lands (they were a "mana source" and not an activated ability) and cast non-instants/sorceries.
---
It would be unbelievably stupid to publish card art changes solely consisting of changes as a result of Chinese censorship requests. 
---
In other words: Not all art changes are a result of the Chinese government, because it would be too obvious.
---
It's okay your virgin eyes are being protected while they work on the other card art that still has blood, boobs, and/or skeletons in them.
---
Really? Are you sure the second copy simply wont have the keyword?
---
So things Ben said aren't applicable.
---
I'm not the only one unhappy about it.
---
If it doesn't fit your definition of censorship, I disagree but I don't see discussing it will lead anywhere
---
Go see some real boobs, it would do good for you
---
And we can't really speak to Reborn synergy quite yet
---
That would be obviously broken, like combining echo and magnetic with cost reductions. Any idiot would spot them at the first glance.
---
Censorship of cards is not because of China. China has got their own server, with tournament mode btw. 
---
This is Blizzard's own initiative. Due to the game being 6+ and SJW hysteria, they want to be far from any scandals. They also ban Pepe and OK sign, out of fear to be called out by idiots. It's even sensible since Sarkisan tries to blackmail CDPR in a daylight for their game.
---
Why not just have different art for different regions?
---
I don't think HOTS isn't quite dead yet, they're just producing less content than before.
---

Lackeys are going to be more op then they already are
---
iOS same issue but it finally updated today.  Funny that this morning there was a banner for the preorder sales that patched but the card changes still weren't patched... hmmmmm
---
The same issue happened with the last patch they did.

You meant 4 right?

Your victory proves nothing
---
Turn 1 counter spell might be a more fun way to get your opponent to auto concede
---
You stole my line. :D
---
Just gonna make a couple bold predictions before anything else is revealed.
---
Quests will be a whole lot more viable this time around, because of the change to not needing to play a card for the reward. One or two might even have to be nerfed, who knows.
---
The new Reno, Elise, etc, if they are cards, will probably be neutral legendaries.

You can always build wild deck to play, but most people play in standard mode - because it's much better balanced. I have 1 wild deck that will never expire, and few standard decks.

Yes, that's a really interesting point. I'd guess the bulk of their demographics is way into their 20s, yet they somehow seem to be addressing 12 yos. Obviously the regrowth have to come from somewhere but... hmm.
---
Silence Priest has been working pretty well for me. Arcane Watcher and Ancient Watcher, Unsleeping Soul, Faceless Rager.  Auchenai Soulpriest and Circle of Healing x2 for Board Clearing. Upgradeable frame because people seem to ignore it, until you bust out that inner fire.
---
What career?
---
Blizz is changing a lot of card art and even card names to be child friendly. Removing "sexy depictions" and "gore"
---
I was really hoping that Warrior and Shaman wouldn't get quests because they have Hero Cards.
---
(Yes, I know about Hunter, but that's more about the battlecry than the others).
---
When a monster loses all of their ketchup, they leave combat to find some more
---
Anything changed yet?
---
Assuming Standard only, is the other one Forked Lightning, then?
---
Any incoming damage heals you instead. Both opponents win because teddy bears and China stuff
---
Op is like that kid that asks the teacher for homework
---
I loved this card art so much. Blizz has done stupid shit in the past but this really pisses me off. 
---
I heard Magic is really good. Hopefully they’re not under China’s authoritarian rule.
---
Vargoth + Sac Pact can kill the last boss
---
In retrospect (and at-the-time-spect), how did that card EVER see the light of day. Just reading it written out really does sound like a joke. Man there was some serious power creep in Year of the Raven.
---
just what we need...more toddlers spewing cuss words in chat.

Was it a disconnect due to losing focus of the app on mobile?

---
I really hate to break this to you, but the US prison system is also forced labour camps full of petty criminals.
---
They also changed the some speech lines too.
---
This could be it. Then again Blizzard doesn't manage their games in China (it's all done by Netease IIRC) and they've always been okay with those guys doing their own thing. Letting them build their own unique features for example. It's pretty different from the other 3 regions where Blizzard does oversee everything.
---
I don't claim to know everything about the topic, but I feel there has to be other reasons why they are doing this.
---
Exactly this. If more people are legally allowed to play the game on their own free will instead of getting parents permission like they should, then that means more money for blizzard and they will go for that 100 times over
---
Thanks for the reply! I thought so but the string of luck was getting to the point where I thought something else was up. Especially with the hidden buffs to cards like multi-shot. Good to know! Thanks again!
---
Maybe you can smack them in the face and “silence” them?
---
Dies to bgh too weak
---
Dang, that's a big number. Clearly you're including things like deaths from lack of food and medicine. Can we do that to Capitalist systems as well?
---
Deal 1 damage to all minions 3 times
---
My blades be thirsty!
---
Of course he's amazing, he's Kel'thu-freakin-zad!
---
I am, but hear me out. I am all for the progression and evolution of things. I get, people change, society changes, etc. But, for a game that seems to drag it's ass when it comes to putting out anything the community asks for, they sure were quick to roll out something no one asked for. The community asked for updates to old cards, like Illidan, to make them playable. We did not ask for Jaina's titties to be covered, we did not ask for secret keepers ass to be kept from the world. Am I over it? Sure. Do I think it is stupid and a waste of time and resources that Team5 apparently never seems to have? Yes.
---
Change Kel'Thuzad artwork already. 
---
It's scaring my chinese friends
---
I do I do I do oooo
---
Time to rub one out.
---
Knowing blizz, we will and they’ll be more OP than most.
---
And summon a 7/7
---
I think people forget that it is a collectable card game. Balance changes are understandable for the health/state of the game, but art changes are tricky to justify since it is cosmetic and shouldnt affect the state of the game. 
---
I think users are also worried since blizzard has decided to change both card art and name without any warning or official reason. As a user, I'd hate to log in one day and find out they replaced personal favorite card art or maybe even heroes.
---
Since when has China cared about whether muricans see bones and blood?
---
They've already for their own version of the game with different art.
---
You're showering on public transportation?
---
The Snowflipper Penguin Shaman meta begins NOW!!
---
First of all, these aren't real women. So any comparison to real women is already kinda stupid. Comparing it to deepfakes is just disengenous. No woman was harmed from drawing these arts.  
---
And having good looking women or women in sexy outfits doesn't mean that every women has to be like it. I have no idea where this viewpoint comes from. Why can we have blonde women? Wouldn't that mean that all women should be blonde?  
---
And why is always, only women? They didn't remove "manly" art? Not that I am for that, but if you are so backwards, at least be consistent.
---
Seems a bit slow? Maybe make it give 7 armor so you don’t have to worry about dying while playing it
---
I just want to say that these are by far my favorite posts on this sub. Thank you for putting in the time and work to make these.
---
Jar Dealer is not a collectible card, but a lackey.
---
I'm french and I find it really funny ^^
---
[Yeah...no](https://i.imgur.com/gTaMbte.png)
---
In this weather, being drenched in sweat feels the same as taking a shower :P
---
I hope mage has yoggsaron effect :)
---
I doubt all of the Plague cards are going to be board sweeping effects. That would be rather boring.
---
Shaman's would probably be a mass Hex, but other three classes could end up being rather different. Warlock's, for example, could be a mass attack debuff.
---
Source?
---
I'd argue they were never funny.
---
wtf(frick) man!! Put a NSFW/NSFC warning on this!
---
Whoa whoa whoa, what about that sword in the bottom left? We can't go having that, now can we?
---
Take out your 6-cost cards and whirly glider, replace them with mech-warper Jeeves, and metaltooth leaper. Play the deck in Wild.
---
&gt;[[Stonehill Defender]] is still strictly better, though.      
---
         
---
Worse against Mind Control + Baleful.
---
Blizzard redid the art on several cards, removing blood and some of the more "enticing" poses.  Presumably done to meet censorship rules in China.  Since then, people have been suggesting other card changes.
---
Oooh that could be nice. I miss dark iron skulker
---
You forgot French Klan Sneak
---
How does this post show Mana Cyclone is broken?
---
Given how much the deck gives up to properly facilitate it, defense outside of getting lucky with calling on Mountain Giant, and the input that needs to be had prior to getting it off well, it's fine.
---
Les étrangers seraient bien peinés de découvrir que pas mal de clichés sont datés mais ont la peau dure ;)
---
De même, nous avons des clichés en tête sur les autres pays donc ça revient au même.... Tous les américains ne sont pas militaires, tous les Mexicains ne portent pas de sombreros, tous les Italiens ne sont pas des Casanova... Et pourtant on s'imagine des choses sur eux :)
---
Blizzard really has to catch up on these bloody cards..
---
Well the truth is that they give us way more than they did before Ben Brode. I'm not saying that everything they profit from these changes goes to us. But that's how businesses work. They are made to earn money. These changes are so slight that I don't see the necessity to bash them over it, like usually people do when something changes. Blizzard gave us more, and that's the truth. We have expansions and adventures in one, we have arena rotations. Better card animations, free legendaries. And there will always be those who ramble because: 'BLIZZARD BAD, BLIZZARD MAKES CHANGES, I DON'T LIKE CHANGES'. Someone will complain about cards being overpowered, or completely nerfed to the ground. It's what happens in card games. Just like in life, you cannot always be perfect. And whining is not the way.

&gt; Never figured out how to link a youtube video at a certain time 
---
Don't copy and paste the link. Instead, look for the share button at the bottom right under the video (directly next to the upvote and downvote buttons). It'll pop up a screen and at the bottom of that screen you'll see an option to share the exact time you are at. Click it, then click the copy button. And that's it!
---
Alternatively, it's always the same formula: just take the url and add "?t=" at the end of the url, and then add the number of seconds into the video that you want the link to go directly to.

Everybody else wants lore details.  I 'm just sitting here wanting to know what percentage of characters shop at Azmodan's nipple ring store.

Uh, please mark this NSFW.... /s
---
Toujours prêts !
---
Blizzard will nerf those boobs mark my words
---
too high
---
good point
---
This makes sense to me.  There’s been no changes to international censorship laws that I know of, and hearthstone already has a pretty popular player base abroad.
---
Nothing.
---
That's all that needs changing for Druid.
---
I'm calling Lady in White and it is the hardest quest to activate because otherwise Priest might be viable in standard.
---
You know what is bad? 30 years of civil wars. The Tianianmen incident prevented that.
---
But you Westerners are just shitting on the Communist Party.
---
Hum, what game please ?
---
I wonder what would be fair. 2 Mana?
---
never
---
Lol like Hot Shots when Charlie Sheen throws the spent cartridges at the enemy.
---
&gt; Can I just say this is incredibly contrived considering that when Antonidas was in charge, they weren't capable of anything nearly this powerful? The auras Antonidas himself was able to invoke was just a degeneration effect.
---
They also fucking teleported their city and made it float. I think we can throw all logic out the window regarding the limits of magical power. Magic is as strong or as weak as needed for the story, Blizzard is wildly inconsistent.
---
&gt;I see. That explains the Western Kingdoms part, but I'm not convinced why Jaina accepted(Or the Night Elves for that matter) it if it meant turning against Thrall, who she was extremely close to at this time. Theramore should have been a neutral territory.
---
Well the Night Elves would never ally with the orcs after they killed Cenarius. If the Horde was just the trolls and tauren, maybe. Theramore was mostly neutral, as Alliance and Horde relations were probably at their strongest from BC through Cata. They had small skirmishes here and there, but nothing like the bombing of Theramore. Allying with Stormwind wasn't spurning the orcs, Varian was on his way to a meeting with Thrall and Jaina before his capture. Many of the conflicts between the two factions during his disappearance can be blamed on the fact that Varian and Thrall were unable to meet and come to an understanding or partial alliance.
---
A shoulder to cry on...
---
Have you tried r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Some of the highest quality content around, much more than this inferior sub
---
Celeste
---
Blizzard can't show any blood if they want that Chinese money.
---
Instead it will be a passive Lady in White power and the quest requires healing your face 6 times or similar nonsense.
---
*Alextraza, plays Despacito

I’d like it at 2 but I could see them making that effect cost 3

Oh my gosh, your right
---
This is how I beat the heist on heroic haha
---
This isn't support forum.
---
now this is wholesome family friendly entertainment!
---
IKR FAndral was hot garbage that never saw any play, r/hearthstone stonks xdxd
---
If this plays out the way you're suggesting, let's review the possibilities.
---
[[Vol'jin]]: Swapping health doesn't really work as a hero power very well because it requires the ability to select two targets. You might justifiably change this to "2: Target minion's health becomes 2," as that's what Vol'jin did most of the time, but that seems pretty narrow.
---
[[Confessor Paletress]]: Now we're talkin'! I could easily see the priest quest awarding a hero power to summon a random legendary. It also fits pretty well with Lazul's fortune-telling theme. 
---
[[Herald Volazj]]: Summon a 1/1 copy of a friendly minion, maybe? Seems like this could benefit either deathrattle or silence priest builds, so this is more viable than you might think, particularly since Whispers was Lazul's original set.
---
[[Raza the Chained]]: This would be awkward. Spending the effort to complete a quest just to discount your hero power is pretty embarrassing when the hero power in question is the default priest power, particularly since the quest version of Wilfred Fizzlebang has a cost discount on top of the Fizzlebang effect.
---
[[Lyra the Sunshard]]: This is strong and appealing. The only reason I feel like it's probably unlikely is that the warlock quest suggests "villain" classes should have some tie to their EVIL representative, and while "random class spells" kind of makes sense for Lazul, that was much more Hagatha's thing in the Witchwood.
---
[[Archbishop Benedictus]]: The only way I could see this working is if it's just shuffling one or more random cards from your opponent's deck into yours with each activation, and it really feels like most games that amounts to "2 mana: do nothing." Feels like Elysiana is just better than this. 
---
[[Temporus]]: Hahahaaaa, nope. 
---
[[Chameleos]]: This could work like the rogue DK did by putting an extra card in your hand that comes back and keeps transforming, maybe, but now we're into the range of expansions that are still in Standard, so I think I can probably stop here. It's probably one of the legendaries above this one.
---
The fact that they changed it themselves doesn't mean that they didn't do so to get ahead of the changes in the censorship standards.
---
Chinese
---
My high school prom proposal
---
Hearthstone's a silly community, and honestly the censorship takes away a bit of charm from the Warcraft world. We're gonna make stupid jokes and try to laugh it off, it doesn't matter if they're funny or not. Have a bit of chill mate. :P
---
Fucking liars !!!

It’s broken on iOS for me.

I crafted golden Hooktusk because the chest bounces.
---
Funnily enough I unsubbed a couple months a go since all the posts were just random screenshot of lucky plays/combos, subbed again yesterday just to see a spam of stupid posts about card's art getting changed,guess I can live without them
---
Same thing was happening to me so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Now I can't even log in.
---
I would suggest that you look up a deck that looks fun and viable that you can afford, and until you make up your mind just consider golden Jarraxus an additional 1600 dust towards your goal
---
I was thinking the exact same thing, keywords double as workarounds for the other card interactions.
---
&gt; "Oh Chin up. I took over this city for evil! A demon like you should be smiling... what's wrong?"
---
for an Arch-Villain, Rafaam sounds like pretty Top Bloke to me
---
I am playing mech hunter right now haha.
---
What about "Give all minions Poisonous"?
---
Getting hit with a lollipop in the head would hurt. Too dangerous, 1 star
---
Now you know how (almost) every other class feels in standard without an infinite value hero card.
---
Reborn will presumably have some of its own synergy too.
---
You are now a moderator of r/Pyongyang

---
I think that's a fair criticism and like I said, I agree with certain pieces like Deadly Shot. But I've seen a lot of comments like, "fucking SJW Blizzard" which seems like such a stupid take.
