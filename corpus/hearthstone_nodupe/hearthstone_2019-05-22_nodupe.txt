I think it is to replace Whizbang as Boomsday's 5th neutral Legendary while Whizbang is added to the Classic set.
---
---
---
Good job blizzard for actually buffing cards and not just barfing cards
---
Considering quest mage could only cast around 20 fireballs in its exodia turn, plus magnetic &amp; echo animations are supposedly quicker than fireball + antonidas, I suppose you could do around 60 damage with this? \*\*surprised pikachu face\*\*
---
Cheaper longterm than standard.
---
Buffing cards? What is this insane clown world we are in?
---
Whizbang is from Boomsday? I don't even remember lol. Yeah that makes sense, thanks
---
*POGO rogue is back on the Maine boys*
---
I like his balance analysis sometimes but his design ratings are a lot of levels of retarded for stuff like this
---
I think they realise that its about time to take some risks and shake things up a lot more often before they lose a lot more of the playerbase. Their original reasoning to not buff cards was that they wanted returning players to not be confused or something like that, but not a lot of players are returning anymore anyways. Considering how many of the big hs community streamers have quit or are constantly taking breaks probably made them realise that its time to update a lot more often. I really hope they continue with it and do stuff every other or even every season, it would make playing so much more interesting.
---
is this real? :O crazyyyy.. They really need to go back and buff a bunch of Rogue cards tho. a ton were made with Prep in mind and that has made a lot of them really bad now
---
We need more redditors like yourself, honest yet opinionated.

---
Make it a 3 mana minion and make the effect a battlecry. That way if you can get it on the board without playing it its not trash and at 3 mana it would fit in silence decks.
---
Thanks man!
---
Ok.
---
Morgl*
---
Thunderhead is a well designed card that is really hard to make oppressive. Its original design intent was as fuel for Storm Bringer but that never played out because both cards were mediocre.
---

---
Crystology probably got buffed because paladin is uber garbage tier right now.
---
I love that they took bigger risks as well, like taking Pocket Galaxy and Morrigan down 2 mana rather than just one is a great leap for shaking things up. I would not mind if some of them ended up creating an op deck, im just happy that stuff is changing
---
Nobody is going to attack into a secret because Freezing Trap, an actual good Secret, is actually playable. People will play around Freezing and accidentally make this card worthless.
---
If you use HS Deck Tracker, you'll see that you actually have several seconds after the rope ends, about 3-5. I guess it was discovered if the turn ended immediately as the rope reached its wick's end, it felt too bad.
---
This way, you get to feel, "I made it at the last moment!"
---
Fair enough, I’ve always just liked Rag a lot and thought it would be cool to see him back for maybe a year
---
Sadly now unless Tyrande or Madame Lazul is hiding something...
---
Yes
---
This is a legit comment. Why downvote it?
---
Illidonger has one of the worse cards for who he is imo
---
Note: I’m pretty sure to get the Golden Zayle you have to spend real money not just gold
---
im excited to play lucentbark druid after this, now pshychmelon can get lucentbark and gloop sprayer
---
So this is how Hearthstone dies… with thunderous applause.
---
HoTS ain't doing so hot either
---
Very happy to finally see them buff cards to enable a more diverse meta game, like treant druid for example.
---
Funnily enough some of the buffed cards were weak on their own but now even better when obtained from a random source (e. g. security rover from assembly or dr boom).
---
Yep... feels bad man
---
The discovered version of pocket galaxy played on turn 3 is going to be something
---
I really hope they dont change auras with echo, my renolock deck runs the Glinda, Warper, Zilliax combo, and its honestly glorious
---
Genzo was actually another ice thought about. I get the Rag and thaurissan ones, but I feel it’d be interesting just for a year nonetheless. Thaurissan I really only wanted for his voice like
---
I have an iPhone and I tried to screen cap, but I pressed the home button first and it turned my screen off
---
Lol, I wish they were good for a year. I guess some Overwatch players only want Counter-Strike where they can dress up their characters.
---
Combine it with reckless Experimenter for infinite damage!
---
Free you say?
---
There are only so many 30 card decks one could make.
---
&gt;I’m having lots of fun with this
---
Well I think that’s your answer. If you enjoy it then there’s no doubt you should get the rest of it. The extra packs are a nice bonus, but you’re paying for entertainment value; not for the most optimal way to spend gold
---
To pieces you say?
---
No, I played a lot during the time that baron rivendare was a card in standard and it was not played in any competitive decks. Nothing stops you from putting it in your deck, but your deck would be better off without it.
---
I thought it was the other way around?
---
I thought Unleash the Hounds started at 2 Mana, went up to 4, then they took it to the middle ground at 3?

16/16 at one card per turn, seems in line with the infinite tentacle for arms questing adventurer charge combo.
---
But she has the most terrifying spider tune when played.
---
Nice one
---
Alone it isnt, but its a possible one. Its not guranteed that theyll have silence available especially without shadow visions. 
---
Ultimately im pretty sure there are a bunch of other ways of dealing with a stealthed 4/4 whether its in wild or not. Whether or not these are perfect solutions they are solutions.
---
I mean..that's what a business is for.
---
i would also combine it with a lot of draw and silence(for taunts).  in the mirror its gonna be up to who draws it first.
---
Just curious as to how this was pulled off.
---
What is snipsnap?
---
I too listen to The Angry Chicken
---
The 9 Mana summon 5 legendaries card and spells costing health not mana
---
It was not.
---
There is a slight chance one Ragnaros hits the cache of coins and isn’t quite lethal but nice work either way !
---
That would have been a turn one lethal :)
---
Man, I just dusted most of these cards
---
Downvotes says it all...  just feel lucky it never happened to you.
---
Holy shit wow
---
&gt;But I still don't really see any evidence that it saw no play or was bad.
---
The burden of proof is on you.
---
Honestly I was super hyped, but I really was hoping they would cut sprints cost by 1 mana to make up for the prep nerf on a non-tempo card
---
Touché
---
just think of it as being board order instead
---
It should say repeatable each turn.
---
I'm assuming they made the same observation?
---
Isn't it the most played expansion of last season now that genn and baku are gone?
---
I've had an extra turn as well. It can also alter the cost of a topdeck.
---
It’s honestly fine as long as they keep at it. It only sucks if they do massive nerfs and they leave everything else alone for 6+ months at a time.
---
wait, so now echo is an acceptable keyword again? poor witches brew.
---
Um.. ok guy
---
Evenlock concerns
---
I have a decent Pogo deck now; so excited it's more viable
---
Nah, went from 4, to 2, to 3. 
---
Patch 1.0.0.5314 (2014-05-08): Now costs 3 (up from 2)
---
Patch 1.0.0.4458 (2014-1-16): Now costs 2 (down from 4)
---
Patch 1.0.0.4217 (2013-12-10): Has been reworked and now reads: “(4) For each enemy minion, summon a 1/1 Hound with Charge”.
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Unleash_the_Hounds
---
that would make snip snap a bad card. they will just make it so that only the first snip snap costs 0, the remaining copies all will cost 3

---
I'm traveling this week, not sure I will have time to look at it, try HSReplay for now.  Often times the Hearthpwn Error is their problem and self resolves.
---
You wouldn’t run Japetto IMO. Priest has onenty if ways to draw and Coppertail needs that 4 health to stick against AOE.
---
I had a similar experience with it, except it abandoned me on the last boss doing nothing but drawing a single extra card and commenting "You know, losing health is how you lose", but I suppose its my own fault for putting my trust into a shitty wizard.
---
More like Mech the second  coming.
---
FYI, I'm pretty sure cost reductions such as Emperor Thaurissan ticks **DO NOT** apply to echoed copies of the card, as it doesn't work for Twinspells either. 
---
The issue is aura mana cost reductions like this that apply to everything in your hand.

This is clearly thematic though. I assume we'll get buffs in the future that line up more with balance, but for now this was for the event and probably to sell boomsday better
---
Is he based off the bartender in sword art online

Or 2 cost into 10 cost.

Man that was helpful.

Not.

&gt;There is plenty of evidence out there. I just didn't want to accept one dude's memory over my own.

Yikes dude. Yeah there's just a plethora of evidence out there, I'm sure it won't be hard right? I'm sure you've produced evidence to support your claim and haven't been speaking out of your ass right?
---
That's if you are already aware of it and googling it.
---
Giving it gold keeps it on the front page automatically via the algorithm for anyone to see.
---
Because that \*is\* an OTK. Board state and health don't matter, the opponent is dead next turn. The combo in this thread loses to twisting nether, so it is literally not an OTK.
---
&gt;I find it rather strange someone would go to this trouble to make a thread like this knowing full well Blizzard had clsoed the door if they KNEW they had been boosting.
---
People do it all the time.
---
He made the thread thinking public pressure and negative publicity from scumbags like you would force Blizzard to reverse their justified position.
---
If "More Arms" costs 2.
---
Most individual card changes have been to cards played primarily in aggressive or midrange decks. 
---
Cold Blood, Flametounge Totem, Hunter's Mark twice, Emerald Spellstone, Level Up!, Mana Wyrm, Call to Arms, Spiteful Summoner, Bonemare, Corridor Creeper, Patches the Pirate, Murloc Warleader, Small Time Buccaneer, Spirit Claws, Rockbiter Weapon, Tuskar Totemic, Call of the Wild, Abusive Sergeant, Force of Nature, Blade Flurry, Knife Juggler, Leper Gnome, Arcane Golem, Undertaker, Soulfire, Leeroy Jenkins, Staving Buzzard, Unleash the Hounds and perhaps Naga Sea Witch are all of them since the game's proper release.
---
Most of the rest were played often between control, midrange, and aggressive decks such as Wild Growth, Fiery War Ax, Giggling Inventor, Hex, and Equality.
---
Only Saronite Chain Gang, Leeching Poison, Aviana, Crystal Core, Dark Pact, Possessed Lackey, Raza the Chained, Execute, Charge, Molten Giant, Warsong Commander, and maybe Gadgetzan Auctioneer depending on how you define Miracle Rogue were cards changed that played a part only in either control or combo decks, most often for making the deck they exist in too aggressive.
---
Indeed. I hope this is a trend of Blizzard going back to more consumer-friendly pricing.
---
I had kept up with the meta until Un'Goro but realized even with the hundreds I spent to have fun I was beginning to struggle to keep apace. I just quit at that point, and learned a valuable lesson about predatory pricing. Still love checking out the subreddit and tournaments though.

I played \[\[toki\]\] that I got from a \[\[messenger raven\]\] which got me \[\[archbishop benedictus\]\]. I then evolved toki with the evolve Lackey and got \[\[tak nozwhisker\]\].

Notice how he didn’t come back...
---
This is why there hasn't been a 3(or less) cost neutral magnetic echo minion with a deathrattle until now!
---
Isn't post rank 10 where all the snowflakes start melting away, and 5 is basically where only the best players can successfully pilot them well enough to hang (or people who just brute force it). 
---
I've been playing since beta and the most consistent thing about this game in those years is that people who go below or constantly stay below 10 always have the worst time in terms of deck variety and freedom to play bad cards. 
---
It reminds me of playing launch version WoW. Everyone bitched about how boring it was to get 60 and how it was a tedious grind to even get there post-55. So Id level characters to about 55 and then play another one. If that part of the game sucked, I'd just avoid it(endgame for WoW drastically improved and is usually the main and best part these days). 
---
So I've never gone below 10. If I get too close, playing too much constructed or playing too good of a deck I switch it up. Play a less consistent deck, play a weird deck idea, auto-concede, try to do some odd combo or just play one of the other modes. 
---
If always playing the best decks and competitive ranking is important and fun to you, go below 10, try to get Legend, scrap it out with the tier 1 meta deckers. 
---
If winning is equally important to you as having fun and avoiding frustrations... Just stay above rank 10. Exponentially better chances of getting matched up with snowflake decks, decks cobbled together from humble collecrions, meta decks missing key pieces, replaced with bizarre cards you didn't account for, decks that are just weapons and warrior spells because quests... You just see more variety.
---
The only time I can remember being fucking sick and frustrated with a deck at my ranks was pirate warrior's reign of terror. It was cheap, mindless, fast, and effective so it was everywhere.
---
He’s even worse in heroic, where he casts 3 times

---
Well there was the one time when the wrong toast was banned :D
---
I think one of the biggest boons of the deck is that dead ringer adds a lot of consistently in finding your legendary combo piece, so you wouldn’t want to play any other deathrattles
---
I think you meant to add a link there because I don't see your list anywhere.
---
TREMBLE BEFORE ME!
---
Wasn't not listening to player feedback the death of so many blizzard games? How are they not learning from this? How much power do they really have over the investors who want higher revenue at all costs?
---
And when he doesn't die, you're suddenly in a Trolden video and can't hear it over the sound of saxophones building up
---
Barnes was never a problem at all. I mean, 4 mana 4/5 deal 8 to my face or add a Lich King card to opponent hand isn't that oppressive because I can just invest 1 damage into it and bam it's gone. The problem here is that Big Priest can ress these 8/8 over and over again if you killed their 1/1, but if you don't, have fun taking 8 damage to the face each turn.
---
Get fucked you boosted animal. Lying cheating piece of shit.

This is a *huge* point. People completely overlooked this when reviewing the buffs. Carpet will be really good with bouncing the pogos too, multiple rush hits.
---
It’s interesting this is posted every 10 mins
---
It's so good in mech paladin and it was even better in quest paladin with lynessa.
---
The card was good and now is bonkers.
---
The utter defeat in his reaction is priceless
---
Ez 60x3 damage
---
I feel like this deck has a chance to rule the meta lol. I think only counters would be token druid and zoolock.
---
Wow that’s absolutely garbage, I have to wait like a month now
---
Ah, I shoulda checked. My bad.
---
Ah fuck you're right. I didn't notice that. A weapon's deathrattle will go off twice. Too bad Hunter has no deathrattle weapons.
---
Curious Coins are themselves a reference to Strange Coins from Destiny 1, the currency Xur required.
---
I can assure you as someone who first hit legend just before Naxx and played quite a lot through Naxx, Riverdare only saw niche play.
---
Correct. It’s very garbage.
---
Coppertail on turn 4 so you can attack with the magnetic effect on 5
---
Well thank you for clearing that up for me, as discomforting as the answer is
---
But the content is getting a lot better too. I haven't played HS for a year but returned for this adventure. At best I'm going to play brawls, I'm not a PvP guy, but this adventure is too awesome to miss.
---
Agreed! The only way they used to shake up the meta before that point is to kill decks that were too strong... 
---
These buffs have a clear goal in mind: Create some new decks. Lots of these buffs are designed specifically with an archetype in mind. 
---
Can't wait to see where it leads!
---
Some of these are pretty crazy. Like Sul’thraze, and Bloodclaw. Good thing you accounted for that already, and preemptively nerfed their art.
---
Prelate, kangor
---
Alright everyone, say it with me:
---
“Omega Devastator appears overpowered because the Mech pool is extremely small currently.”
---
Seriously, this card isn’t a problem at all in Wild. We just have such a limited Mech pool in Standard at this point and as a result Devastator has a much higher rate of appearance. These nerf ideas are just petty at this point.
---
Good point.
---
Honestly I've moved to other hobbies. Basically got sick of greedy publishers/developers trying to get blood from a stone by putting in and focusing on slot machine lootboxes and microtransactions instead of making good games.

This is mine, Oondasta is really good with Specimen and Shirvallah + Specimen also synergises well with Egg and Acolyte and is also just good on an empty board as 5 6/6 haha
---
No, it really hasn't been. Check the latest data reaper.
---
Shaman should actually beat Control Warrior now as it still has access to double Elysiana.
---
I mean, this is a pretty reliable combo compared to some of the meme ones that this subreddit suggests. This is a combo that 
---
A: forces you to play minions that contest the board early (which is a good thing for surviving, which is something combo decks struggle with). 
---
B: Is semi-reliable with tutors and 
---
C: Doesn't really force you to run shitty cards. Reckless experimenter is pretty bad on curve, but the legendary is a good all-around card for mech decks.
---
I don't know if mech priest is a possible archetype, but if it's even at least T4 I think slotting in literally three cards for threatening lethal if you ever have board presence against a lack of taunt/freezing trap/noble sac will push it into complete ladder cancer (everyone will have to slot in answers so they can pray they don't get mech curved into a sticky minion surviving into OTK).
---
I am in the same situation and I think I will dust her and get the normal version of her plus a legendary of my choice. Though it was nice having all discovered cards in gold.
---
Should be 3 mana discount, but not less than one. You can still do it with an additional Mechwarper, but so can Warlock with Summoning Stone.
---
&gt;extremely popular
---
Lol no they aren't. The vast majority of rogue-likes are niche indie titles and the biggest one is probably binding of Isaac.
---
It's Echo because in the same year block of Witchwood, it rotates out with it and it's not going to be the only Echo card around the next standard year.
---
Tell me *everything* that you did that might have caused that bug. To help you, of course.

&gt;between echo and discover however is that discover was never discontinued and replaced with a clunky wordy version of the original, only then to print another card with the original text. Discover may have been an ungoro exclusive mechanic, but it was then quickly revised to become a main staple mechanic going forth from kotft with cards like eternal 
---
Discover was introduced in LoE
---
Because as we all know the only factor in judging how good a card is, is how much play it sees
---
They got the wrong picture for Mecharoo...
---
This all buffs my Tess rogue in a beautiful way.
---
You can the play the card as much as you want as long you have the mana. At the end of the turn the card disappears from your hand. 
---
For example it's turn 10. You play this card. You get it back again to your hand and have 7 mana. You can play it 2 more times and have only 1 mana now and 3 SN1P-SN4P (you can also magnetize three times if you want) on the board.
---
If you end the turn now the card disappears from your hand and you can't use ut again next turn.
---
I hope that made the keyword clear.
---
So the old gods corrupted Rag and made him a good guy? That's pretty neat
---
I mean it wasn't the 2 mana that was a problem it was the fact you can't draw the pogos fast enough and the oponent rushes you , against control decks you are a murderer but any midrange and hiper agro wins I don't think the manacost will change anything.
---
What idiot thought buffing thunderhead was a good idea
---
It is limited by the turn timer. And Magnetic animation is pretty long.
---
I feel like Trumpsc should create another "Flavour" rating. Because sometimes he docks Design rating for Flavour issues, and sometimes a card that is incredibly flavourful gets a 1 star for Design.
---
It's okay to bitch. RNG gets everyone. There is a ton of RNG in constructed that is decided even *before you start to a game*. Draw RNG and matchup RNG probably determine 70% of games between any two players who aren't terrible.
---
Arena has low rolls in the draft but all the other stuff that makes constructed frustrating and RNG based is either nonexistent or far less impactful. So sure, maybe one in every five drafts is really awful and has almost no chance of going past like 5 wins. 
---
Arena is also far less routine. There's a joy in constructed of learning the ins and outs of a new deck, but after that, once you learn taht deck, a lot of games follow the same patterns. It gets boring... at least to me.
---
As far as the cost goes, I have zero interest in packs. I like to play, and while I'm not quite infinite, I would guess I spend maybe an average of 25 cents/run. A run is usually about 8 games or maybe 90 minutes of play. That's a good value to me!
---
Unfortunately, all adventures feature wild cards atm...
---
You have no idea of the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person!
---
Blizzard: Echo is a dead mechanic, let's print a clunky sentence instead because some day ppl will not know what this keyword means...
---
Also Blizzard:
---
Holy I want this in arena
---
I don't see what you are getting at? It should either be nerfed or buffed? Why?
---
Good point
---
Preparation &gt; Violet Haze still costs 0 mana, and you guys were panicking about Prep getting nerfed
---
its not great in mech pally as the micro bots could mess up the mech res spell
---
Any mech + new legendary +  \[\[Reckless Experimenter\]\] = Fun and interactive, lots of counterplay.
---
Shit I wish I could be paid to boost people on hearthstone lmao
---
I did this i cursed me all
---
ON AN EMPTY BOARD, NED!
---
r/titlegore
---
You have a full board? Let me clear that for you!
---
This is gonna be a ruff battle
---
Finally! Really hope they try to buff interesting cards more often. Excited for pogo rogue; it won't probably be enough for ranked viability, especially since prep will be nerfed in the same time, but damn that deck is fun.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I am a bit worried about  \[\[Thunderhead\]\] who was already good; the buff of warrior mechs is also a bit surprising, it will make omega assembly even better and it was already close to OP. Unexpected results also see some play already.
---
U only need to draw 3 of those cards though. Coin is sort of outside the combo really. Just speeds it up a turn. Out of those 3 cards, 2 are a 1/15th chance of drawing, its just the legendary thats trickier at 1/30th. If there's something that lets u draw the legendary reliable, it should be a solid deck. Turn 6 OTK if u have one mech on board since last turn, and the 3 card combo in hand. Exodia did it with more cards and longer build up (more mana needed) i believe.
---
Out jerking hscj yet again

4/3/5 Elemental | After you play a card with Overload, summon two 1/1 Sparks with Rush.  
---
It isn't a zero sum but very few people have the time to play two card games. They take so much fucking time investment to get a decent care collection that it often doesn't feel worth it to play more than one at a time
---
Just started playing a couple days ago. What are some common acronyms used in guides?
---
[removed]
---
Bartender Bob skin for Bob please blizzard.
---
The only thing extra arms should have gotten too was the twinspell keyword
---
I can believe that, everytime i check Hsreplay pogo rogue is everyones best matchup.
---
After watching the final episode of Game of Thrones I no longer care about consistency.
---
Everything that needs to be said has been said
---
2 Mechwarpers, Simulacrum and Z1pp-Z4pp or whatever he's called is 4 cards. The thing is also that animation speed is too low, so you can't even OTK the opponent. You can do a lot of damage of course and build a huge board, but a OTK is apparently not possible.
---
UNITY PRECISION PERFECTION IS IN HALF OF ALL DECKS BTW.
---
I just read his post history, he’s either just a troll or someone who has a sad outlook on life.
---
Watch them reduce the stats to 1/2, or who am I kidding, they’ll just raise the mana cost
---
They forgot that Odd Pally is tier 1 in wild...
---
What kind of bribes are they giving him? Is the magic of Dalaran not enough to sustain him?
---
I think Elysiana will work really well later on but when on my deck i don't usually reach fatigue so it's not useful yet. Do you have a better shout instead of Zilliax?
---
You can't silence a Vaporize, I'll get that legend by farming the priests
---
\- not enough rooter to pull of the combo with consistency (no, dead ringer is not enough)
---
\- get destroy by aggro/mid (just like Nomi Priest)
---
\- pretty hard to stick a mech (replicant menace make the deck less consistent --&gt; dead ringer)  + the combo + get through taunt/freezing/....
---
\-  2 \* SN1P - SN4P + seance for 8 mana can be a good way to stick a mech on board (but 8 is l8)
---
\--&gt; may be a good anti-control deck ?
---
This deck has the possibility to win by Turn 5 if you high-roll, and you can tutor for the Coppertail Imposter using Dead Ringers, so there's a degree of speed available in the deck.
---
Personally, I think it's going to be a meh deck overall, but it will *feel* bad to play against. Because it has a huge degree of variability.
---
Massive advantages to Mecha'Thun Priest were things like, well, *Psychic Scream.* The strongest board clear to ever exist in Hearthstone, really.
---
Mass Hysteria still exists, but that alone is probably not enough. And if you find yourself relying on a Holy Nova with no synergies, then I'm inclined to think that, yeah, you're struggling to survive for your combo.
---
Well, it's a "Mechano"-Egg.
---
Duh.
---
The true symbol of power
---
I’ll just have 4 silence minions in each deck shall I? Just so they can all come back on turn 7 as strong as ever
---
How hard it was to pull off wasn't what made APM priest bad. It's that they just didn't have enough ways to draw all the combo cards and survive fast enough. You basically had to cycle through your entire deck with just deathrattle draws and then psychic scream and spirit lash to survive. Wasn't enough.
---
And galvanicers and glowtrons for the mech pally.
---
And in other kind of decks different from mech, stuff like inmortal prelates, kangor (and lynnesa in wild, or both bolvars).
---
Hell, this could even be used to tutor murlocs like tidecaller, toxfin and grimscale oracle if they get a little but more murloc synergy like in the past.
---
Talking wild; Lynessa, maybe even Bolvar Fireblood
---
Echo is meant to be witchwood exclusive but i think they just gave up.
---
Biologically that just doesn’t make sense
---
Don't you guys have phones ?
---
I literally just did 5 warpath (3 of which drawing a card from acolyte) and I only started when I was already on the rope.
---
On my phone.
---
Umm...."Mechano"-Chicken?
---
If you see this happen turn 3 even once in a real game PM me. 
---
There will probably be a Quest Mage variant, perhaps based on spare parts, that runs this combo. It's still going to die to most of the existing aggro decks (Raiding Party is getting nerfed but Odd Rogue is right around the corner and it doesn't run any of the nerfed cards except for Miscreant), but Quest Mage is very popular in Wild despite it not really being a good deck, so it might still see play.
---
Actually you could do this in standard as well with the little guy who reduces the cost of your mechs and getting a third one with floop or baleful banker or sth. Slower but doable I think.
---
I've literally just watched Shaun of the Dead wtf.
---
Yeah, this seems pretty op to me.
---
Maybe he is talking about that 1/5 poisonous Blaster
---
Love Dalaran Heist. Can't wait for the next few parts to drop. Thanks Blizzard!
---
Maybe they realised they lowered the power level a little too much last year.
---
Genuinely exciting news though. I hope they do balance changes and buffs every expac.
---
With the Heist and new arena and now the buffs and new legendary they have minimised the risk of burnout during the mid expansion cycle.
---
It's meant to be a year of the Raven exclusive, and it still is.
---
Or just brewmaster
---
That's my opinion as well. It looks good on paper, but you actually need to survive.
---
Wall Priest could be a real pain in the ass though, with less Rogues on ladder. I'm more convinced by this kind of strategy and you even could run the new mech too, because Wall Priest already runs three mechs.
---
Baader–Meinhof effect.
---
It should be doable, I did multiple tests and I think you should be able to play 15 echoed cards if you're fast enough. The Glinda combo was much slower.
---
There are multiple reasons this won't break the meta, animations likely won't be one.
---
Specifically drawing 1 attack minions is not a good thing. Tutoring isn't always better. It is why Psychmelon isn't as good as 4 mana draw 4.
---
You can make 2-3 big minions too and seance it, without much cost, you get the original mech, have charge
---
And there’s a 4/4 for 4 with mech and stealth
---
I agree that Warrior really didn't need any more help with a new good mech legendary plus two buffs to already decent cards. But I am curious to see how the meta shifts with buffs to other class cards and what new solutions shake out of it.
---
Bob could have "Battlecry: win the game" and I still wouldn't be mad.
---
BWONSAMDI! We had a deal! Grant me your dustah!
---
Purisima#2134 EU 80g Quest trade
---
hahaha.  If you’re fast enough you can have 7 XXXX/XXXX mechs though.
---
nobody? i've already seen posts about it
---
Not in my experience., I went from Rank 17 to Rank 5 in an afternoon with a 84% win rate earlier this season. Reapeatable turn 3-4 kills with metaltooth leaper. Hsreplay shows an average winrate of ~60%. People just don't know how to mulligan properly.
---
If they were to Nerf the deck, I would prefer for either mechwarper or galvaniser to have a (lowest cost=1 clause) or for the draw three of end of turn to be reduced in the case of (forgot the name) the 1/4 mech. (Jean, Butler, Claude, jerico?) 
---
But yeah, the combo with Zola is too slow and will not be played.
---
The consisten wording
---
And it starts with 3 imps, but they're beasts, so Hemet tech works against them.
---
Only when the new Roomba mech releases
---
My preference is YOU WIN, BUT YOUR WORLD IS STILL DOOMED!
---
WANTED! should get a buff. 
---
Vanish certainly shouldn't. It is fine where it is at, sees competitive play from time to time and I fear for what a stronger vanish could potentially do to the game. It is the strongest aoe removal in the game (no deathrattles, "kills" everything).
---
A cheaper Vanish (only real way to buff it imo) could potentially find its home in a very oppressive tempo rogue.
---
Give sprint a buff instead.
---
and at the end of the turn it dies...
---
Deadly shot, freezing trap, vaporize, silence...just off the top of my head...
---
Nerfing is better than buffing, but buffing is easier than nerfing. Sounds weird, but let me explain.
---
When you nerf a card, you reduce (or sometimes completely eliminate) its presence in the meta. You're confident about that much. But what happens *after* that? Take the Rogue nerfs; you know Rogue is going to be weaker, and people would naturally assume that Warrior, the #2 deck, is going to take its place as #1. Except Warrior has some bad match-ups, and Rogue was one of its best match-ups. So what *exactly* happens with the meta with the Rogue nerfs is, actually, quite hard to tell.
---
But take these buffs, for example. Crystology and Glowstone Technician. These buffs make *no difference* to the meta unless these cards see play, right? That is the first and most obvious impact any buff will have -- the buffed card *sees play.* It's far more predictable.
---
If Crystology sees play, you know 1 Attack minions see play with it. Seeing as Kibler has already been experimenting with Crystology and Glowstone Technician in his Mech Buffadin (Buff Mechadin?) decks, you can tell that even without any further refinement those decks will do *a lot* better now with these two buffs.
---
When it comes to *controlling* the meta and making sure cards or decks don't get out of hand, I'd say nerfing is better.
---
But what Team 5 is trying to achieve with these buffs is spicing up the metagame, and buffing -- especially when they've buffed *so many* cards and done it for *every* class, is a good way to go.
---
On another note:
---
&gt; if Blizzard took an expansion from a previous year and stepped up it's power level to meet this years'.
---
Eh, it's more to do with the individual cards more than anything. Most of these cards have been very subpar in any competitive sense. If we took Zilliax as representative of Boomsday, we'd call it the most broken set to ever exist (seeing as Zilliax sees play in, what? 57% of all decks right now?). 
---
They're buffing the weakliners of Boomsday. But it turns out that once Hero Cards and Quests rotated out, Boomsday was one of the strongest sets with Mechs and Magnetic being extremely useful.
---
The bottom line being that a card set from one year is not going to simply be weaker than a card set the next year. Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan's are great examples of card sets being overshadowed by the card sets of the previous year (again, thanks to Hero Cards and Quests).
---
That's what the Standard Rotation is for: avoiding the need to perpetually power creep cards as time progresses. The yearly "reset" means that you don't need to make utterly broken designs to make sure cards see play.
---
While Piloted Shredder was in standard, it was in just about every tempo deck. The card has been pushed out of many wild decks since due to stronger synergies. but in a deck like even shaman with limited options, it's still quite powerful.
---
twins would be better?
---
&gt; but when a paladin has a 5/11 divine shield taunt... with rush 
---
How many cards did they have to invest into that to make it happen? At least three.
---
Now, how many cards do you need to counter such a thing? Really only one: Ironbeak Owl or Spell Breaker.
---
Magnetic is a powerful keyword. There is no denying that. However, much like Aura enchantments in Magic: The Gathering, Magnetizing minions onto each other leaves you open to getting blown out in easy trades. 
---
Kangor's Endless Army deck help mitigate the losses, but Mech Paladin (and to a lesser extent Mech Hunter) is only as close to being viable as it currently is because Silence effects are not being actively run in favor for weapon destruction.
---
&gt;The ‘your hero is immune til next turn’ BS is just trigger inducing. That’s 10x worse than ice block and that was supposedly bad enough to get kicked from classic 
---
Time Out! is not in any way better than Ice Block. It has some upsides over Ice Block, but between it being an expansion card (meaning it will rotate) and it can't be set early on or pulled out of the deck and forgotten about, it really isn't game breaking.
---
Damn, didn't ever think of that. Do priests play unppwered steambot so they can just OTK people?
---
Oh ok. Thanks! Yeah, i kinda liked alex and i suppose tirion was good as well, so i was wondering if i should, but my friends encouraged me. Glad i asked for you guys tho. Thanks a lot!!
---
review your games and analyse for each turn if there are there better plays you could have done
---
I think Bob sounds like Dwayne Johnson.
---
Better late than ever i guess but we suffered a lot since the release of this game so we gonna need changes like these more often..if this is a one time thing not gonna matter a lot in the long run...
---
Sylvanis shadow word death approves
---
How broken would a card like forbidden words be for drawing?  As in, spend all your mana, draw that many cards.  And what class would get it?
---
Bit of a one trick pony. Also the OTK deck I was referring to. Honestly, Control and OTK Paladin did not take the nerf to Equality particularly well. Shrink Ray, Consecration, Time Out! all still exist and are still par for the course as far as control tools are concerned, but I'm not sure we'll see any Control Paladin re-emerge until they get something to replace Pyro-Equality/Equality-Consecration.
---
This is a very cute post.
---
Even if a mech doesn't stick you can make 6 giant minions, only limited by the turn timer.
---
Gratz on Dad Legend!
---
Except there almost isn't such thing. If you watch competitive hearthstone you will realize that very rarely players will lose even just a best of three due to bad draw. It does happen right now with the Warrior mirrors and the importance of playing Dr. Boom, Mad Genius early, but as a rule of thumb if it happens to you then it's not bad luck but
---
* suboptimal deckbuilding (lack of draw/tutoring, including cards that are too ambitions, lack of early/mid/late game options),
---
* a suboptimal mulligan strategy (in particular keeping cards that look OK instead of digging for something you will need),
---
* and/or playing resources at bad times (e.g. dropping a five health board against the threat of Dyn-o-matic), which later makes you dependent on a good draw in the first place.
---
This applies more strongly the more uneven a matchup is. In the Rank 4 to Dumpster Legend territory that I feel at home at, and where players generally have an idea of what their own and what the enemy deck is supposed to be doing, I came to the conclusion that only *very* good and *very* bad draws can change the outcome of a heavily favored matchup. The Deathrattle Hunter I'm queueing right now, for instance, went 16:1 against Warrior and 2:8 against Token Druid this month. Now gaining two wins against Token confused me to an extend that I looked it up, and indeed one of them was an enemy disconnect. The statistical winrates are 66-78% and 29%, repsectively, and I'm overshooting both significantly as players in these ranks do on average know how to leverage their advantage, leaving little room for luck.
---
TL;DR: If your winrate in a favored matchup in high ranks isn't higher than the statistical advantage over the entire playerbase (including a lot of people who have subpar understanding of the matchup), then you are playing a bad version of the deck, or are making bad decisions.
---
If Hearthstone won't let me cheat out card draw and mana like a madman with Prep and Gadgetzan Auctioneer then I'm just going to have to get my fix with RDW, Light Up the Stage and Runaway Steamkin.
---
Depends...
---
This one is better without a mech ofc but as a combo, I agree.
---
While I think it's strong, downsides are - you need 3 very specific draws.
---
Then you also need your opponent not to have the board by turn 4 so he can kill anything. 
---
Any taunt ruins the combo, or requires at least one silence each
---
Anything that kills copper tail also ruins the combo (destroy a random enemy minion, or destroy stealth) 
---
Some other counters include, 
---
mass dispel, mass hysteria
---
demonic project, twisting nether, shadow flame. 
---
defender of Argus in token decks, mana wraith, freezing trap (hunter has like 6 ways of shutting this down).
---
 Time out, equality pyro
---
Vaporise, any aoe, any aoe freeze
---
And many many more. 
---
There are definitly tech options to kill the 4/4, at least.
---
Reddit has been wrong so many times, (but also right - 10mana 555555)
---
Hes the real MVP.
---
Tirion used to be titled "the best legendary in the game". He has fallen a bit in powerlevel, but still definitely strong.
---
Alex finds herself in nearly every dragon package, every damage based otk and sometimes is just a overall good card.
---
Nah, he'll just give it 1 star design 3 star balance and add "What is Blizzard thinking?"
---
That's the last wing of the expansion, you've spoiled it early!
---
missing a start of game effect smh
---
maybe I'm missing something but it looks like a not verry apt comparison, kind of a reach.
---
I would rather save my gold for the next expansion. But then again I miss 6 legendaries from RoS anyway.
---
Every single cost reduction card ever has some ability to limit design space and that ability is hindered greatly by simply giving it the Summoning Portal text. They should just do that as the norm.
---
I don't get it snipsnap still dies at the end of the turn even with stealth no?
---
Edwin was really not the issue here
---
It was the refill that Raiding Party provided, which removed the risk of Edwin and set up a powerful tempo play on the following turn..
---
Plus all the lackey generation
---
Edwin isn't OP by himself, or you'd see more Wisps in Rogue decks
---
-- 3 free Classic card packs when you achieve each of these milestone ladder ranks: 45, 40, 35, and 30.  
---
-- Upon "graduating" to Rank 25, earn 2 Classic card packs, and 2 packs each of the most recent four Hearthstone expansions  
---
i don't know if you get the graduating packs if you skip to rank 25.
---
And here I thought it was conjurers calling
---
It's simple
---
I think nerfing Rogue as a class is the entire idea. Preparation makes it really hard to print spells that are not OP with it, but still good without it. 
---
Just look at the cards you mentioned. Do you want all Rogue spells for all eternity to be unplayable without unnerfed Preparation, like you say Sprint and Vanish are?
---
How did I miss that. Thanks \^\^
---
Necromechanic at 4 mana is absolutely playable. Both paladin buffs are going to have impact as well
---
As long as you can stick a mech from turn 4.  Oh hey, look - a 4 cost mech that has stealth for a turn! [[Coppertail Imposter]]
---
Not in regular mech decks? You have the Mecharoo who is rather sticky minion. The 3/2 mech that summons 2 bombs, he squirrel with stealth. All of these cards are also decently good standalone, without the combo.
---
This combo before with glibda is far from being the same and far from being viable.
---
This combo can be played as early as turn 5 and just win on spot
---

4/4/4 Mech | Battlecry: Gain Stealth until your next turn.  
---
Blizzard needs to change the keyword Magnetize to not allow more than one Echo proc. For instance you could play Snips Snap three times on an empty board. You could even magnetize it one time to three different mechs. But you cannot magnetize it to the same Mech more than once.
---
When I saw this hand, I tought to myself, “WTF, how is this even lethal?” Then I was like ohh
---
Just like old inner fire/divine spirit then. Nothing gamebreaking for now. Lets wait at least untill the card is released before asking for nerfs, please.
---
Stop acting like prep isn’t good with a 2 mana reduction. It’s still a ZERO COST SPELL. It’s still good just not broken
---
Hold on, being positive? We don’t do that around here. All we like to do is complain and whine
---
Yeah sure. I didn't jump on the nerf bandwaggon yet
---
Are these real?
---
3 of them are getting buffed real soon
---
While Pocket Galaxy will obviously be better it still has the same problems as before.´It's incosistent. It's a one-of which you have to draw before you draw your combo pieces :)
---
You realize they used a 4 mana draw 2 card in the last expansion right? Tutoring 3 cards will still see play in appropriate decks.
---
Just keep playing. I play since closed beta (although with several breaks in between, left after blackrock and came back after knights of frozen throne) and i just hit legend 2 days ago for the first time. Use decktracker and learn the matchups. To help with this watch several top legend streamers since it helps a lot if u pay attention how they play. Also pay attention to the decks you are facing and tech accordingly. For example, i hit legend with tempo rogue and i was consistently changing cards due to the matchups i was facing (nomi for warrior, fan of knives for druid, saps for hunter etc). Good luck!
---
If you realize that, in fact, it's ok to be wrong, why is it so hard for you to admit it?
---
Do buffed cards offer full dust value for a time, or still just partial? Boomsday packs are looking really nice if it's the former.
---
It’s called backstab
---
I don't think he is very important for that deck.
---
He's just a very good midrange finisher in general.
---
You could use more card draw (ashmore) or maybe some dmg (leeroy)
---
Wait, when will the update drop?
---
 [https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22990355?linkId=100000006342997](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22990355?linkId=100000006342997) 
---
New Golden Legendary they're giving out alongside the Boomsday card buffs.
---
This spell also froze one of my dungeon runs (fixed by alt f4 and starting game again)
---
That's clearly the soul of mechwarper.
---
Giving minions vanilla stats is pretty safe now because every class has enough removal to immediately deal with vanilla stats if they need to.
---
You ever play Shaw on 4? He dies 100% of the time.
---
Necromechanic will always be a dead 4 drop but now you can combo out a double Mech Dragon more easily with the extra mana.
---
A 4/3/6 is a good stat line but as a Mechrattle Hunter, I would take Necromehanic as a 2/2/2 like Khadgar any day of the week.
---
In general: don't dust classic legendaries and legendaries of sets you still open packs of.
---
You'll just reopen them
---
It being a legendary changes that you can only play one, so these cards are usually more powerful for that reason.
---
The only class capable of doing this in Standard is Priest, whose only best method of actual card draw is Northshire Cleric-Wild Pyromancer-Circle of Healing combos and Auctioneer. 
---
Most likely, the SN4P Priest OTK deck will very much resemble Nomi Priests be it with the Coppertail Imposters, Reckless Experimentors, and SN1P-SN4P added in or replacing Chef Nomi  an a couple of the less good spells the deck has to offer, which would make Auctioneer worse. Nomi Priest is really a deck that can only be played well in the hands of someone who very much knows what they're doing.
---
A potential mech Priest deck would also likely end up not being very good either.
---
The change you've made to the card turns it into a better and neutral Blessing of Kings. Mech Hunter and Token Druid would love to turn a lone Goblin Bomb created the turn before into a 4/8 with an additional 4/4 worth of stats on the side and another 4/4 ready on deck on turn six. Even just Magnetized onto itself in this form, it's a six mana 4/6 that summons two 1/1s when played and other four on death or a nine mana 6/9 summoning a total of ten 1/1s. 
---
I can see reasons why many decks wouldn't want to play SN1P-SN4P in its current form, but your proposal would make it see play everywhere.
---
Wohooo thanks!!!! I have been trying with secret hunter and I’m trying to figure out what’s lacking.
---

---
You need to play it 13/14 times.
---
And with the magnetic and echo effects being really slow. I dont think you can pull the OTK combo off in time ever
---
It's a cheaper ~~sprint~~ AI that tutors. I mean, it already was, but it still is.

---
It's a comedy where the prisoners escaped and locked the warden in a cell on the way out.
---
I’ve noticed the ‘repeatable this turn’ cards don’t trigger cards with abilities that are proc’ed by echo cards. Should be fairly obvious but I was bummed out when it dawned on me
---
You have another day/quest to complete since it doesn't release till tomorrow and you could just win 3 games to get 10 gold.
---
Its hard to see any cards that werent already decent become like a core card in any type of deck, but we will see i guess
---
freeze shaman sounds unfun as shit lol

Seriously, how good is MTGA compared to HS?

So I assume we're gonna be sticking Snip-Snap in all of these except silence priest, just like Zilliax, right?

 No you’re naive if you think blizzard can think of and balance every interaction before it’s released. This is one of those times. It’s a broken interaction and I’m predicting reckless experimentor will be changed before June 3

---
You go first, thank you(I can show you first tho)
---
People say this, but good luck pulling off crazy combos in wild when decks like odd paladin are so powerful.
---
because you are wrong. magnetism is an effect that takes place after the “playing” of the card “summons” it.
---
so. 
---
step 1: play
---
step 2: mana consumed
---
step 3: card “summoned”
---
step 4: magetism checks parameters
---
step 5: if mech is to the right, fusion occurs.
---
you are right that magnetised minions do not count for resurrection mechanics. let me explain why. lets call it step 6
---
step 6: magnetic minion transforms into a “spell” which buffs the minion it is fusing with by adding its stats and effects. when the new fused minion dies, the graveyward only recognizes the named card that dies, as the magnetic minion was “transformed” and did not “die”
---
i hope this clears things up for you.
---
When can I see you again~
---
&gt;Or do you mean for every 2 mana spent, you draw 1?
---
That one.

Time to play mecharoo in every deck

You know what I likes about you /u/JVIesmerized?  You being willings to gives out a puppers...
---
Are [[Mechwarper]] s wild?
---
That’d be fair I think, I’m sure people would play it
---
I think that the pogo hopper being 1 mana helps with getting it from piper more consistantly when you run control 2 drops such as thalnos and doomsayer, that buff has the hidden effect of freeing up the 2 cost slot for more deck building flexibility

Are you NA?  I have challenge friend quest

Hopefully, this helps.
---
Tirion is good, but it's not like it synergize with anything; It's just a big, tough value minion. If you have another similar minion, it could do just as well. If not, as someone said Sunwalker is ok'ish.
---
My question about the whole card is if it is magnetized does the echo effect still trigger
---
But it's a neat idea.
---
Always dust all nerfed cards unless you're 100% sure you'll keep using them. 
---
You can't go wrong with dusting them. Worst case scenario: You craft them back, and lost literally nothing.
---
Do we know if that already works?  Like using the warlock legendary that gives echo to minions to test?
---
You sure that's what you like about him?
---
Oh it's absolutely going to be OP : )
---
Extra Arms has been a very overlooked card at it's current cost. I've been using it to great success and I'm surprised that it's gone relatively unnoticed. It's been so powerful at 3mana that I can't even imagine what it's about to be like at 2 mana. If you have a turn 1 minion and start arming it on turn 2 for a class like Priest lol... shit is about it get crazy.
---
I really don't think so. I remember how people were talking about Magnetize breaking Wild with Glinda + Mechwarper when Boomsday came out. And guess what? It didn't. 
---
People are always overhyping many "broken" combos before the expansion, and most of them turns out to be too slow, too clunky, too inconsistent etc. 
---
So maybe let's wait until the card is out first and THEN talk about how strong the Turn 5 Priest OTK is...
---
&gt;Also, does Darkness work with Glinda yet?
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
Tier 3 is a bit of an exaggeration. VS slotted Odd Rogue as a Tier 1 deck as its both aggro and has better matchups against Even Shaman and Odd Paladin than Kingsbane Rogue did. Team Rankstar was less glowing but still put Odd Rogue as a high Tier 2 deck.
---
We well get the first "buff" patch ever in just a few days. They usually nerf cards, but never buff them. The team seems to have a new approach now, so maybe buffs will be more common.
---
Wild cards never come back to standard. Hasn't happened since release, anyway.
---
Countered by tinkmaster
---
You know what's better than overload synergy? A 2-mana 4/4.
---
The real question is how fast you can actually combo magnetic things. I know from mech hunter exp you can't just keep snapping them to the left and they will keep adding. You have to wait for the add to complete before you can snap another one on.
---
That being said though I wonder if you can have multiple magnetic animations going on at the same time. So just snap it to the leftmost mech and work right through the rest might allow you to Lego them faster
---
Priest has \[\[Mass Dispel\]\], Warlock has \[\[Shadowflame\]\], for example. There are ways to exploit this further.
---
Makes sense, it's basically a mecha'thun deck without having to empty your hand and deck too
---
I’m genuinely curious if it would see play even at a 4 mana 5/5 stat line
---
Let’s take 5 to 10% off that u/

Will not happen because classic card... Sad but true.
---
There is no silver bullet card and there should not be.
---
Also, the situation you describe fits more with some mid-range deck than OTK.
---
Regarding the obligation to clear the board every turn, it is not new.
---
In my experience, if I do not do that against hunters or druids, and also paladins, I will  have lost by turn 6, no wombo combo required.
---
Not just the AI, it happened to me last night against a Mage
---
Who is this guy,  i never see him
---
Why stop there? Hit him with a Galvanizer then coin on Turn 4! EZ Clap
---
How is it hard to imagine? Its just sticky mechs and card draw
---
A little bit yeah, I hear that.
---
You gotta have good control over the board before turn 4 plain and simple. I’d mulligan hard for early game and if you have the  passive your cards over 5 cost 5, you can carry it theougg
---
Mechs and Magnetizing is pretty vulnerable to silence and transformations. Might open up a niche for shaman to come in with Earth Shock and Hex to keep Paladin in check.
---
Security Rover buff? Fuck Dr Boom.
---
In other parts, I think all of these are good changes with Crystology and Glowstone Technician being my highlights because that could really help some of my Paladin homebrews.
---
several good 1 attack mechs, or at least ok... but come on, 1 mana draw 2 is great on paper, lets try it out :)
---
Shoulda drawn brawl smh
---
Yeah, they just got through nerfing Rogue again, then hand it a combo card that's already seen attempts. Welcome to Pogo-Rogue Winter.
---
&gt; You can play multiple copies of The Darkness with Glinda on the board

Did you test this?
---
&gt; I think you always could?

It was definitely bugged from release (April 2018) to this January.
---
You always *should* have been able to.

Turn 1 northshire cleric is now one of the scariest plays I can think of.
---
I’m about to end this dude’s whole career
---
It lets you take the top 2 cards from your current deck and add them into your hand, accounting for hand size limits, and it costs you nothing but the actual pot of greed card itself! 
---
come back next episode where we reword what pot of greed does again!
---
Fool! It lets me draw TWO cards from my deck!
---
I do not think this kind of combo deck will be good, but I will still try to pull this off for the memes.
---
 Buffing health on spirits is out of flavor because all spirits are supposed to be 0/3s
---
Bomb and control will still be pretty much the only warrior decks. However, with the new balance changes Conjurer Mage will become even stronger, as rogue (it's worst matchup) will be less of a threat. Conjurer Mage tends to destroy Warrior, so if I were to craft anything, it would be a Conjurer Mage, Aggro mech Hunter or a Nomi priest. (Nomi priest will see more play because less warriors and tempo rogues).
---
I gotchu for the challenge. I'll pm u my username
---
cant attack tho?? or am I misreading your diagram
---
Because there's nothing to be nerfed.
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/290/bomb-warrior#tab=matchups
---
There's so many bad matchups for the deck that you got multiple choices to counter it. If you want to play whatever deck is weak to Bomb Warrior it's your own fault doe.
---
They can increase the magnetic animation to 20 seconds. EZ fix
---
You still lost tho
---
will not happen because 2 mana 3/2 weapon is broken af
---
Wonderous Wisdomball as excellent?! 
---
That really surprises me... Can you talk a bit more about why that is? I tried it once and it was absolutely awful.
---
Tbh I hate meme decks-it just feels like memestone.  
---
I prefer playing Big decks.

The animation when they all “magnetize” together is so cool ! Congrats never been able to do this myself.
---
[https://youtu.be/OB3ZzyZw7as](https://youtu.be/OB3ZzyZw7as)
---
Just got warlock legendary from RoS. What combo can i do with him?
---
Warriror generally wasn't hit directly because they indirectly hit through the hit to Rogue in a couple ways.
---
1. Tempo Rogue was one of Warriors best relevant match-ups
---
2. Warrior was, for most purposes, really the only class that could hard counter Rogue
---
3. Decks Tempo Rogue was holding down (Summoner Mage, Hunter as a class, etc.) happen to have good to great match-ups against Warrior.
---
I've said the same thing in another thread, but be wary of the constant meta shift if they do not make any changes to the economy.
---
Recently, they increased the cost of the game with paid adventures on top of actual expansions, and now, they are having one of the largest balance patch since the beta, which will render many decks useless, and create brand new archetypes.  From a gameplay perspective, this is an amazing change, but it's going to strain your gold and dusts reserve more than anything else before.
---
Don't get me wrong. I think most of those changes are for the better, and I'm glad they are taking those risks, but the end goal here is to sell you the "Boomdays pack bundle" (that is going to hit the store with those change), and starves players for dusts.
---
Ok, sure. But what happens when you play it?
---
Y'all sleeping on Warsong Commander. I smell a "Your Rush minions have Charge" monstrosity incoming
---
What? The only example I can think of is portal. Or are you talking about cards like wing blast?
---
&gt;Pally 2/2. Not great. But if you control the board and keep your opponent from establishing himself you can just deal 80+ damage with the instant-kill effect. Bad against aggressive opponents, but if you have the right draws in your deck it's fine.
---
I got this for a win on turn 5 or something (I had robes of gaudiness with it so was playing big beefy dudes to protect my horsemen).
---
BEHOLD!
---
No
---
Can't think of any marrow shards or snuff out combos
---
Nope. Classic cards won’t be touched. Only expansions that are due to rotate next year. Read the blog.
---
I know it's anecdotal, but I got a 67% winrate with my Quest Warlock deck between Rastakhan and now in Wild. It's far from bad since it can deal with Aggro decks by keeping up with them or Combo decks by simply dropping more and more cards and infinite 3/2s after board clears. Not so good against Controls teched against aggro, but still
---
Are you sure that the golden deck was not Whizbang or Zayle golden?
---
Nobody is talking about "grinding". This is all just happening on day 1 as you complete the tutorial and unlock the cards for the classes/play up toward rank 25.
---
He didn't specify what deck he wanted, naturally some are more than others.
---
I'm fine with him spending money however he wants, he's the one asking the question :-).
---
Here's the most important part of this. It doesn't matter when you drop the imposter, next turn you have enough mana to exoerimenter+mass dispel. That means that as long as the opponent cannot remove a stealthed 4/4(and let's be real here, this deck will run power word shields, so it might very well be the case that imposter will frequently be 4/6 or 4/8), the priest can kill you through taunts next turn. That makes this incredibly sturdy. Add to that the fact that the priest can just drop an unmagnetized sn1p and seanse it, and that's a super lethal combo that the deck can actually repeat. That leaves behind gigantic bodies that flood the board with magnetizable 1/1s when they die.
---
The kicker? It's a mech. So if you don't have the mass dispel, you can magnetize Zilliax to the gigantic imposter and heal to full. And give it taunt.
---
This deck looks like it could be a problem.
---
If that's their solution, then it kind of defeats the point of printing a card with both echo and magnetize, and also disrupts the ability to easily understand how the card works, which is something the HS team always stresses. All they need to do is tweak the mana cost of snip snap or how reckless experimenter works.
---
Somebody doesnt believe in pogo hoppers
---
I faced Trade Prince Gallywix with Robes of Gaudiness and it was pretty tricky. I kept getting coins from his minions and was at 10 cards each turn. I could only play one coin and one real card per turn. I spent a few turns just getting rid of coins to avoid milling. I ended up Killing him with the 4 horsemen hero power.
---
How do you know that? Why would this not work?
---
Well I'm gonna be wasting polymorph on a 2/2 mech if I cant remove it otherwise from now on
---
"Even if the buffs end up being perfect, and none of the cards warp the meta, I still think that buffs are a mistake. With that being said, I hope they did the buffs perfectly, and the game ends up more fun as a result."
---
So if they're done perfectly they are a mistake, but you want them to be done perfectly and make the game more fun. Gotta pick one.
---
It's mana cheat in general that's super strong. I've also had a ton of success with Goggles (leftmost card is 2 cheaper), and with Elixir of Vile (spells cost health instead of mana).
---
Pretty sure, I didn’t see any animations in the beginning of the game. 
---
It seemed to be some sort of rush centered control deck. 
---
If that’s what whizbang or zayle is then I apologize haha, I don’t know all of the decks. Just the main Meta ones ATM
---
That was the whole design of the card, so that's unlikely the route they'll go.
---
Right, okay, I see what you’re saying
---
Glowtron

Golden Prep
---
You just can’t win with this community lol. It’s good because it keeps the game interesting and new. Period
---
Seemed ludicrously powerful until I ran into a final boss who filled my hand with coins.
---
Ah you're right you can alter the order. Still the cost is the same.
---
Yup, everyone on here talks about how stupidly easy the mode is and whatnot, but after finally beating the Heroic I was really happy. I've now fully cleared the Normal version of the first 2 chapters with all 3 classes, and I'm 3 HP + 3 decks into Mage Heroic Chapter 1 (only Burn! left, I believe).
---
Outside of the Robes of Gaudiness, and arguably Stargazing, I really don't feel like there are any actually broken treasures, passives, or buckets. Some are better than others, especially given certain conditions, but it's all decently balanced.
---
However, I would really love if Robes of Gaudiness got nerfed... And maybe Stargazing should reduce the cost to (1) instead of reducing it by 1.
---
The thing is though, aren't most people in the ranks 20 to 5 than anything else? I care far more about how decks do in those ranks than the meta tier range. I guess it's about impossible evaluate for a meta of people playing a to of different decks for kicks though, gotta have some know quantities to make a judgement. Plus if anything is too good it might sort itself down to the meta ranks.
---
damage is (5\*20), +4, 2, 2, 2, from vargoths attack, +1 from hero power= 111. Total health of all apposing minions and hero is 1+3+2+1+55=62. You have lethal with just orb.
---
Nope, my thoughts are more along the lines of: "they're already doing them, and I can't do anything to change that, so I hope it ends up well."
---
r/fuckhunter
---
This worked for me too.  Interesting deckbuilding challenge because by turn 8, you have to have all other minions out of your deck.  That means that if you use any minions other than Jepetto, Alex, and Maly, they have to be the ONLY card at that mana slot.  I used 1 each of Spellbreaker, Zilliax, and Giggling Inventor (didn't have the legendary for spell damage on 7) and then loaded up on survival spells at 2, 3, and 6 mana.

The Priest version, which uses [[Reckless Experimenter]] as opposed to the first 4 cards listed, is probably a lot more consistent.

5/4/6 | Deathrattle minions you play cost (3) less, but die at the end of the turn.  
---
I remember when Genn and Baku came out everyone was extremely excited about them and loved the design; I even commented right after they were announced that I thought they were bad. Change is not always good if it's implemented poorly.
---
I know you were being facetious but I'd love if sorc Apprentice got that nerf.

People can't read apparently. Sigh.

---
Still below/on par with Cairne which doesn’t see much play.
---
Read the title. And the content of the post. Then reflect on the fact that getting through 12-15 magnetic/echo animations in a single turn isn't possible, and that you absolutely need to find a way to reduce the number of times you need to magnetize, which I address.
---
I got two Golden Moorabis in back to back packs. An amazing combination of bad and good luck.
---
I believe buffs in general are a mistake because it's much harder to predict whether a card will be broken or not, whereas nerfs are much less likely to break the game. Even though it is possible to implement buffs without breaking anything, I don't trust Blizzard, or anyone really, to get it right, and something will eventually slip through the cracks.
---
Same for me. Got 2 more runs in Heroic left. Never lost a single game.
---
Yup, that's an unpopular opinion.
---
I could imagine then just removing the Deathrattle from the card and giving it +1 attack.
---
People pulled off the Boar OTK with millions of points of damage, going through taunts. I'm sure they can do this.
---
Tell me about it.
---
Lol four triggers 😅 cool interaction, but didn’t last very long
---
It has everything to do with this situation. If tons of released cards can't compete with current meta but after this change they can its practically like re-releasing the expansion and people can get creative again trying to make new arch types work. Yes a few cards/decks will become less powerful but (hopefully) even more cards will be playable now instead of this polarising meta game. 
---
Elyssiana isn't deck defining for bomb warrior, its played in there but the nerf is targeting the degenerate infinite fatigue combo and rightly so. Elyssiana will still be played in decks, I can guarantee it, it will just not be in 1/4-5 decks on ladder but more like 1/10.
---
Of course changing the meta will impact the game, and the more changes the more effects it will have. That's the whole point. I don't think the meta game has been this polarised in a long time, something drastic was required and I think this is exactly what was necessary.
---
Hopefully a whole range of cards and decks are going to be viable now and people will actually play more than just rogue/warrior/mage. 
---
If you dusted all of your expansion cards, I feel bad for you but I don't see that as Blizzards fault for trying to make the game more fun than it is now.

You can't use the same exact deck and expect the same results...
---
Yes now I got the 1600 dust back so i'm happy but for a few weeks now I had that card after crafting it and I could never properly use it. My Warrior was somehow too "fast" for it so I never end up getting a chance to use it which means I had wasted 1600 dust for a card I thought was neccessary for mirror matches.
---
Yep now it's balanced, It sucks
---
For a single week yes.

It's consistent with all the buffs being from boomsday

---
Since the minion sticks, the player is incentivized to rapidly attach as many copies as they can before the turn timer expires.
---
I know that "APM Priest" was already a thing but at least that deck had an end goal - stack enough buffs to get lethal.
---
With this, there is no end goal.  You attach as many copies as you can and never stop.

Unless you have a mech on board from the previous turn, and you just stack until you have enough for lethal.

No, I finally ate with you about how blizzard seems to hate combo even though it is fun and challenging to play (although aoe freeze is a little on the uninteractive side)
---
You can still play with cards you opened and/or arena (id guess theyre talking about crafting only)
---
I dunno. Mechathun requires too many support cards, and is too easy to disrupt. There are several one-ofs that do it. 
---
It's easier to put in elyssiana + 1 anti mechathun tech card than the play the mechathun otk package.
---
I never said it didn't. But without paying customers the game wouldn't exist.
---
Oh look, buried but not even an attempt at a rebuttal. Of course.
---
Ah good job you’ve made 105 extra dust! Still not bad
---
What? Why not just play without crafting anything, just using what you got. Seems odd to hold off on playing until round 1 nerfs to play/craft. Not to mention, post nerfs metas sometimes change. Add in that we are soon getting buffs...
---
Myra's won't always be in Standard.  When it's not, 6 mana to draw 4 might be necessary.  Most aggro decks run some kind of card draw, they just can't afford to run too much because of the tempo loss.  But if you're an aggro deck with no card draw, you wind up like Secret Pally, you just gas out and can't finish the job.
---
HEARTH$TONE  ^(👉😎👉)
---
Wait what?! What do I do with my pitchfork now?
---
Ah. So Ancient is vanilla? Interesting. I thought I remembered him having text. 6 mana, once again, would mean 1 mana for unconditional draw and the flexibility of choose one. Where would the cards that compete with this be?
---
Tomorrow
---
It's used for a lot of other things besides that.  Every single Rogue spell that costs more than 0 is a consideration for use with Prep.  The Prep tax is a real thing, and if they don't remove the tax now that they're nerfing Prep, then spells that are already not played much will become completely unplayed.
---
Ok Hank yo I
---
The chapter 3 is live on PC ?
---
2x Shallow Gravedigger into double Sneed's Old Shredder, one drops Ysera and the other Face Collector, Ysera gives you Dream, bring Face Collector back to your hand, play it, get Barnes. It's simple:
---
Let this be a lesson to you not to spend money on this garbage game.
---
The fact that it still wouldn't be anything special, speaks volume about how "off" they were with 6 mana.
---
From my point of view, the *Jedi* are evil!
---
Flavor text: Take all the time you need
---
The playing card that originates from Yu-Gi-Oh, Pot of Greed, allows you to acquire the top two cards from your deck, and add them to your hand!
---
Hyldnir Frostrider exists. It's quite strong with Moorabi in the 1 mana weenie tavern brawl.
---
I had a golden miscreant and a golden raiding party, better believe I cashed in.
---
Certainly you could, but they suggested that their strategy was going to be "not playing".
---
ah \*ha!\*
---
I mean...buffs to mech warrior.  Feels pretty bad.
---
Class specific cards effecting hero powers usually only effect the ones they were created in mind with.
---
Similar thing with the 2 mana 2/3 "you can target minions with your hero power" hunter minion.
---
This is by far the best idea i have seen for this game. Thank you so much for bringing this up, cause its a major problem for the people who wants to have fun. Greetings from Argentina
---
No idea either.
---
Just curious what you mean by that? Sorry I’m just ignorant :)
---
Are you saying instead of using the reddit youtube player, we should copy the link to the youtube app? Dose that provide added benefit?
---
I actually disenchanted 12 of them! So 480 dust total, 420 extra EZ
---
Congrats
---
My dude, nobody is gonna watch your videos if you spam them
---
Whether these Deathrattles move the original card or secretly create a copy can't be determined by whether other zone-changing Deathrattles fire. That's one of the measures that go into faking it. Elixir of Hope can be seen creating a copy in the logs, for instance, but if more than one is applied to a minion, only one will trigger.
---
One in-game indicator that does work last I heard is Leyline Manipulator. If the Deathrattle quietly created a copy, it'll be cost reduced. If it really is the original card, it won't be.
---
The tools of crea-- no wait...
---
Well, I gained 0 dust because I always disenchant as soon as I have duplicates.
---
Haven't seen a shaman in the 5-3 ranks for weeks, so i guess it's okay
---
Point.  This was just one night's take.
---
Abdz#6619 NA 80g, u first
---
In my defense, she does look like a Jewish Grandmother and man my new Priest deck is weak against 4-attack minions.
---
It's weird I know, but let's be a little fair here: Wilfred is from TGT, a very early Expansion. Hearthstone back then was reeaaally wacky, it's no wonder they coded stuff like that, inexperience and all. I mean, nobody could really imagine the sometimes crazy stuff they created since then, right?
---
If you could tell me that 5 years ago, that'd be nice.

---
Because Blizzard doesn’t nerf cards. They bring balance to the Hearthstone Universe.
---
Sure, maybe one variant might be OK, but that's a far cry from "every class" as the OP indicates
---
Disagree. Magnetic is essentially a buff spell card. The original minion is all that matters.
---
Yeah, but it's a start right?
---
Rogue gone? I doubt it xd
---
Let’s reiterate that op is playing Murlocs.
---
Im starting to feel like these nerfs are just a ploy to get me to log on again .-.
---
I need my dusttttt for... something...
---
The real question is consistency.  Are you able to stay at legend and have a better win rate than the decks without it?
---
Its not a bug, hp disabling or stealing cards are turned off in single player due to bosses being heavy reliant on their op ones
---
There are better alternatives.
---
&gt;people can get creative again trying to make new arch types work 
---
The problem is that you only get to participate in this if you have all of the cards. If you spent all of your dust crafting, say, tempo rogue, you're sol.
---
I know you get dust back for nerfed cards, but you're not getting the dust you spent on Myra, Edwin, Leeroy, or Greenskin. Now you're in a position where all of these cards are useless (at least in the current meta) and you don't have dust to craft the upcoming tier 1 Luna's Pocket Galaxy mage (clearly a hypothetical scenario).
---
&gt;If you dusted all of your expansion cards, I feel bad for you but I  don't see that as Blizzards fault for trying to make the game more fun  than it is now. 
---
The problem isn't that you dusted all of your expansion cards, the problem is you spent your dust to make a specific deck and never opened (or crafted) crap like Luna's Pocket Galaxy.
---
I had just pulled a Golden Elysianna yesterday :D Gave her up to make a bomb warrior lol
---
Either way this will also mean getting a full board of dangerous things
---
A Spike amongst the Timmies?  It'd be a bloodbath.
---
I tend to agree, but its worth noting that A. That 4 mana draw 2 didn't specify pirates which probably makes it a more rounded card, worse in raiding parties optimal scenario but better in the average scenario, if you don't have a waggle pick left the 4 mana 3/3s get a lot worse, and B. that it was attached to a 3/2 body, which is slightly relevant. Though in raiding parties favor, the 4 mana vanilla 3/2 is a lot worse than a 4 mana draw 2 pirates.
---
I think you're still right, the card is strong, but a full mana nerf isn't a 'slight' nerf, especially when combined witht he prep nerf. Yes they didn't warsong commander it, but the deck will be noticeably more clunky postnerf.
---
Why?  I am spending my money my way.  I am a grown man with extra cash each month in my entertainment budget.  I still have several hundred magic cards and I don't even play that game anymore.  What is the difference?
---
If you prevent it from going face for 1 round you still need to deal with a 30/30 and 6 crabs with deathrattles the following turn though, so you basically need Brawl, nova + doomsayer, or turn 6 counter-lethal.
---
Sample size is an absolute metric, not a comparative one.  For any given question and given precision, past a certain point, larger sample size is not useful.  Matchup winrates are very simple questions, so you don't need more than a few hundred games to be very confident on them.
---
VS does not exclude games from their report, they do their statistics based on all games submitted to them.  Most deck tracker users, especially on mobile, don't/can't submit data to VS.
---
He sucks in his gut in the first couple images and then just say fuck it after that.
---
Well it does if you spend the dust and don't have it later :)
---
&gt;A Spike amongst the Timmies? 
---
?? what
---
Best candle! I mean best card back!
---
Serious question, why was rogue nerfed? The most broken decks I come across is the miracle priest and bomb warrior.
---
Thats how TCG's work I'm afraid, can't have it all...
---
Well, I just want to play and not worry so much. I need to disenchant something in order to play anyway.
---
Because it's not "while still being aggressive". 1 attack for 3 mana isn't what you're looking for in pretty much any matchup other than maybe zoolock or token druid if you manage to magnetize it.
---
That might just be a tech card that fits your play style.  I play mech hunter a little and often find myself in odd spots where I wish I just had that 1 extra health so it might be a good idea for me too. 
---
The highest winning deck is just a statistic and might not be the best for you since everyone has different proclivities for trading and mulligan etc.
---
How many similar posts can you find on this reddit? Not one that has been repeated to death?
---
Oh... yay...
---
Are you sure? The following decks will be invalidated:
---
Pretty much all your fucking decks
---
because you are bad at managing your dust doesn't mean he's wrong
---
Defend the gates!
---
Light the fuses!
---
Thank you!  I couldn't recall her name at the time, but yes, once you get going with 5-6 shielded life steals, you basically win.  I've only lost once to a Warlock who happened to have 3-4 clears because of some odd deck they built.
---
What do you mean ? I'm just expressing my views on why I believe this is not necesserly a pack oppening post.
---
clever reference to that 3 player analysis
---
Well, even amongst the timies youre going to have agro or anti agro players.
---
This is just a one case example but I love to experiment with a stall thief rogue variant (still perfecting it)  that does extremely well vs most agro decks specifically to not get shit on
---
Besides goldfarmers dont have to be Spikes, you'd find those on ladder most likely
---
"people have been playing conjurer mage and control warrior" would suffice. As it happens, those decks share a card in zilliax.
---
Freezing trap doesn't even seem that good against this in general though.  It stops the OTK but you still have to deal with a giant board of huge crabs with deathrattles the following turn
---
I understand what you said I was wondering if you had a source of blizzard employees talking about it. I believe you either way I’m just curious
---
That's a pretty pathetic creeper.  Him talking about a possible tool for new decks instead of posting the same shit that's been posted hundreds of times.  But if you like links, here's one for you.
---
http://www.google.com/search?q=Mindbreaker+Solo+Adventure
---
It is less than ideal, yes, but the problem is the card is a crazy combo enabler, and probably shouldn't be printed at the current stats.
---
*snap*
---
Only opened 5 Miscreants (the minimum number of commons from RoS for me -.-), but also a golden Elysiana, so I guess I can't really complain.
---
I complete it on turn 4-5 usually. Helps to have +1/+1, Tiny Dudes buckets and Rush on your minions. Easiest Heroic clear for Hunter in my opinion.
---
I am grateful that you didn’t make a post each time it happened!
---
Countered by vaporize. FIXED.

Under notes.
---
What a sad day.
---
I had it happen on XR. I just deleted the app and reinstalled it. It worked for me, maybe try it?
---
I could play 4 more pogos and and have a full board
---
Surrender to madness would be fun tho
---
I got the same thing happening to me on day 1. Restarting the game, reinstalling, and playing on a different device do nothing. Just gotta wait for blizz to release a patch for it.
---
What about if we don’t play on pc?
---
I just deleted the app. Clearly isn't a high priority to blizzard so I'm not going to waste time posting on their forums and everywhere else (especially not here since people just downvote it) so I give up. There's other games out there
---
I packed a golden elysiana do you think its worth it for me to DE to get that juicy 3200 dust?
---
Tf. I’m on a train I can’t reinstall!  Wtf blizzard
---
That is your opinion and you are entitled to it. But that is the game design reason given.
---
Personally I think it is valid.
---
Playing since BRM, 0 Pyroblast smh
---
180, not 540. They don't treat each pairing of hero power and deck as a unique combination. So if you finish with Recipe A and Hero Power #1, Recipe A will be checked off no matter what Hero Power you select when going back to that chapter as that character.
---
So, you'd have to play 4 runs at minimum to get all Hero Power and Recipe checkmarks for a specific character and chapter. Multiply by 9 to make it all characters for a set chapter, then by 5 for the number of chapters.
---
4*5*9 = 180
---
Coming back after... a... a while. Any advice for someone who's sort of new again? I think I last played around the time either Kobolds and Catacombs or Mean Streets of Gadgetzan came out(whichever is more recent).
---
I do have Zayle's Shadow Cloak, so that dos give me a few recent decks to fiddle with, but I'm having some trouble remembering how to build my own(playing a lot of MtG in the time between has also muddled up my skill at it).
---
Do aggro decks still exist? I keep having 15-20 minute matches with priest and shaman and going until someone dies due to fatigue, which makes me think either I'm having weird matches or using a wonky deck.
---
It is a big app, so maybe reinstall when you get off the train and somewhere with a good connection
---
Fair, but force tank is still probably better there because of the Divine shield. I think oblivitron will summon any mech from hand, not just deathrattle ones.
---
Getting paid to donate plasma?
---
It isn't, you're just drawing your 1 drops on turn 2
---
It is still very much playable. Remember when rogues ran two coins? Well prep is much better than coins.
---
It's a terrible reason. The UI literally explains all keywords. It's a bad reason.
---
Kurama007#1219 80g quest trade NA
---
Do you have a decklist for thief rogue?
---
Underrated card in my opinion. You can’t undervalue “magnetize” in this meta. Works superbly against Token Druids. Magnetizing deathrattle mechs can change the tempo drastically. I liked Animal Companion, but running all-Mech deck(with exceptions of Defender of Argus, Harrison Jones and Leeroy Jenkins) it works much better for me.
---
I know. It’s just stupid that App Store doesn’t have an update and that I have to totally reinstall to get it to work.
---
It literally took me one minute to figure out what the difference is between these images. I should get some rest.
---
It’s a shame they don’t have better player/developer relations and relay time and time again a same message like a bot.
---
“HE KNOWS NOTH-INK”!!!
---
A hand full of 4 mana 12 12 lich kings qorks rather decently
---
Quick, someone tell me the cost/stats/abilities of both bolvars without looking it up. I think its impossible.
---
Would at least make your draws slightly better for the rest of the game
---
I wouldn't say so. Nearly every tech card produced is almost never used. There were times that not even Swamp Ooze was used and that's straight baseline stats. The way HS ranking works, teching just isn't beneficial to the overall climb.
---
I just got my reward today of 100 gold for collecting all classic cards.
---
Actually did get 2 of those from Archivist as Shaman in the control matchup. Poor warrior didn’t see it coming, especially with Shudderwok clearing the board again.
---
Upvoted for invisibility
---
That’s why I stopped playing lol, but maybe the next patch will spice things up a bit I’ll probably come back for a couple weeks before I get bored again and the new top dog deck is everywhere
---
Tempo is basically every turn you want to drop a thing and kill uour oppnent’s thing, actively fighting for board each turn. Common examples are backstab si, killing a thing/things and putting a 3/3, wagglepick corsair, whacking something and getting a 3/3, and pretty much sap + any minion or prep + spells + minions. 
---
Miracle decks are characterized by having explosive turns which they completely flip the board or play a ton if cards in one turn, which generally requires cards like auctioneer, luna, apprentices, lyra etc. These turns generally require some sort of resource buildup, like drawing cards beforehand with ai or maybe getting coins with gilded gargoyle or tomb pillager. 
---
These are pretty general archetypes, and decks can have a good deal of overlap, think of how cards like apprentice, prep, and sap fit into both ideas.
---
