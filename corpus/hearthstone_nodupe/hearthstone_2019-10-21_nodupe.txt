&gt;I'm arguing that the portraits should not be "ranked rewards" because winning in Ranked is just as easy as winning in Casual
---
&gt;The mode is a preference. Do you want to play for fun or do you want to play meta netdecks against meta netdecks.
---
&gt;
---
You contradicted yourself. If you haven't understood that winning in each isn't the same difficulty. The general mentality of the players is different.

Agreed.  If you're playing around Twisting Nether, you may not play certain cards until your opponent plays both of them.  Once you see them both played, you can go "ah ha!  Now I can play this card without fear!"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you see your opponent play both Ruby Elementals, you're not suddenly going to go "ah ha!  NOW I can finally float 6 mana!"
---
Buddy. It's a joke, not a dick so don't take it so hard
---
Years of virtue signaling, a pr team that consists of headless chickens, layoffs after most lucrative year, microtransaction abuse, devaluing freedom, suppressing free speech, and worst of all they dont make good games anymore. 
---
But nah, the soulless husk of a company is aight.
---
You know that druid spell card where u give minion +1/+1 and you gain armor equal to the minion´s attack?
---
Well, that minion on picture, the minion doubles your spell if you target the minion on picture and puts it on your hand.
---
Combining with minion that lowers all spell cost by 1 while on board and you have infinity combo.
---
What OP said is that he went as far with putting same spell on minion that is passed the integral flow and because of that, it made HP and attack of minion into negative value.
---
Damn poor of you, it seems this happened to you a lot of times.
---
Ok. I read so much negativity on these subreddits it's hard to notice anymore. I just wish people that don't enjoy certain games would leave the community or have constructive criticism to improve the games. My bad. No hostility here
---
-uses  political bandwagon to reinforce personal popularity

---
No, I'm suggesting that paying and winning are not related. By definition.
---
Yeah, it seems like you could slap Rush on them instead and they'd be extremely balanced. Making them attack something random makes them next to unplayable by comparison. Attacking something random on summon is an interesting effect, but in place of Rush, it should be more of a penalty for getting a better-statted minion, or be on something cheap with some kind of crazy effect, like Poisonous.
---
If you want to have a good Secret Highlander Hunter deck, you need Subject 9 because it's your best card draw. Subject 9 makes your following draws/top deck much better. It's a card you can keep in your mulligan (depending what you're facing) even though it's 5 mana.  
---
If you only have Snip-Snap you might want to drop Ursatron.  
---
Edit: Otherwise, you could also play the non-secret variant: https://hsreplay.net/decks/zR0ZITkt6tbRzdsTzc3cvg/
---
Balancing a game is not easy, especially one with as many moving parts as Hearthstone, Overwatch, or WoW.
---
In Hearthstone, for example, a complete carpet bombing of Shaman, a largely aggressive class at the moment, would lead to decks like Quest Druid and Highlander Hunter having one fewer strong counter, which could easily be enough for Standard to shift into Hunterstone or Druidstone, an equally bad situation.
---
Standard formats in any game too, in it of themselves, are a flawed concept in that their small card pools make it much easier for one or two cards that spiked way about the power curve to completely dominate. Magic players can tell you as much if discussing the Tarkir block between Siege Rhino, the second Siege Rhino, and fetch lands.
---
Dude.......... or dudette....... a W is a W is a W is a W. As well as Ls. This isn't MtG with Ponders and Brainstorms. If you want to effect your deck then switch games.
---
Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about! Of course it would be very high level production, I don't think an artisan could make them
---
This is correct. That’s why you emote after you win. You don’t emote well played before because you could be bluffing and because you can also fuck up.
---
I’m a guy and sorry but for me a W is when you used your skill and didn’t top deck...that’s not skill. Wins that are cheap do nothing for either person playing, they actually ruin the experience.
---
The general pool of top players is far more than 16. You absolutely do see the same people competing every year. 
---
Anyways, I'm out, gl hf. Whether you're trolling or just clueless I wish you the best.
---
It's built in detachable pieces, still hilarious though.
---
Raven and Sottle were fired after this and the player was banned for a year and had his prize money taken away.
---
They just need to spend more time balancing and less time trying to make more more money from expansions. Overwatch keep adding heroes and trying to balance...stop adding hero’s and balance the game. Hearthstone keep trying to balance but add mechanic like ‘mutate’ how the fuck could you ever balance such a mechanic?
---
Stop adding things and actually concentrate on the main gameplay and actually see who can bluff, trade and really play with skill. I don’t want to see the best hearthstone players on the planet lose because the other one got lucky, it makes no sense.
---
&gt;Is competitive Hearthstone nothing but who gets a better draw? 
---
When you only view games one at a time, all games can be summed up as that to at least some extent.
---
Where players' skill really shows in over the course of many games. There's a reason why Grandmasters is a series of weekly tournaments and not just one single elimination tournament.
---
&gt;I rarely see any tough match-deciding decisions pro players have to make that other pro players would choose differently. 
---
Individual games too are rarely won on the back of a single choice made at a pivotal moment. A game of Hearthstone is a series of many choices, some big others small.
---
&gt;Is competitive Hearthstone nothing but a glorified coin flip? 
---
It is only if you're looking at competitive Hearthstone as the result of games one at a time, each of those game being decided not by a progressive back and forth or resource management, but by what was draw a couple turns before it ended.
---
Do you still get 80gold after conceding?
---
Not if you pick right all the time. His hand size will be so low you essentially autowin. Demonic presence? Nope. Tracking device? Nope. That 6 mana 9/9 that he'll always play? Nope.
---
For getting two of the same spell or two of the same specific spells?
---
I just mean specs take turn being "The best" so people complaining about "X class is STILL overpowered" is dumb, because at every point in time, one of them is OP
---
Combination of several things:
---
1. Blizzard rarely adding new features or improving Hearthstone gameplay.  It took them years just to add deck slots
---
2. Other games like TFT, MTGA, and recently Runeterra coming out and showing how shallow Hearthstone gameplay it.  The Hearthstone gameplay engine has fundamental limitations: a card can't have multiple targets, you can't take any action on your opponents turn, minions can't have activated abilities like planeswalkers, etc.  This makes Hearthstone's gameplay very shallow and uninteractive.
---
3. Hearthstone devs have focused solely on churning out card expansions with lots of RNG.  Their dev posts show they have little understanding of their own game or clear design direction (e.g. claiming that Shamans have a weakness in card generation then printing more support for Shaman when it's already one of the strongest card generation classes).
---
4. Blizzards actions recently (for example in regards to Blitzchung) have shown they don't care about what's right or the good of the players, they only care about money.
---
Fundamentally hearthstone's gameplay is very shallow, and now that there are lots of competitors that are more successful than Hearthstone like TFT, it's natural that streamers will switch to those.
---
edit: All of the things I say above are true.  Plenty of people in denial.
---
It started going downhill when they switched to 3 expansions a year, no real Adventure mode, and 2 legendaries per class. It became super obvious that Blizzard were basically milking everyone who spent money on the game for all they were worth. Anyone with a gram of sense stopped spending money on this game after the greed train fired up in Ungoro.
---
Streamers really didn't have much choice but to spend money on the game to entertain their viewers, so of course they mostly found alternatives.
---
do u know what Astral Communion does?
---
Oh sorry I’ll change it now
---
Just something I remember. Back when Defile and Lord Godfrey was played, I really respect those who can somehow manage to make the perfect board clear calculations given a short window time. Then there were also those who play around it and make their boards "undefilable" by making awkward trades.
---
It discards your hand and gives you 10 mana crystals. He still has a card and tempo advantage and I assume the enemy doesn’t just not run control cards so he has to top deck good cards on top of having to face 5 and 6 mana minions/spells
---
I mean obviously if you can pick it right all the time, lmao that goes without say. But say he plays the icewall. You cant out it. He draws a 2. You get presented a 2 and the tracking device. What now? Eventually he just presents multiple broken options. You pick whatever you cant deal with.
---
Yes. There is definitely a skill gap in Hearthstone. But it's in the competitive scene that I feel that that gap is no longer present and the wins seems to always go to whoever had a favoured draw.
---
This deck is so strong right now it’s out of control
---
Or they just changed the art because they wanted to
---
People don't bitch when Magic sets get different art
---
Also in WoW, they have a separate client for China, I don't see why they wouldn't just do it with this game, because it's literally just an image file change if it was really solely on the Chinese conspiracy side of things
---
They've really reigned in the "Disney aesthetic" with their recent marketing, why wouldn't they make the game more childish or less "offensive"
---
&gt; I'd argue that their eSports infrastructure is nowhere as committed as other games.
---
For HotS and HS maybe, but Overwatch it's VERY developed.  OWL is the big thing for them.
---
Love that you're being downvoted for stating a fact.
---
AncientJustice's accusations are utterly disgusting—so much so, that if there are any children or sensitive people reading this letter, I suggest that they stop now and not read what I am about to describe. It is first necessary, however, to make clear which facts are not in dispute. There is little dispute that there are deeper issues afoot here. There is also hardly any dispute that AncientJustice is extremely disorderly. In fact, my Disorderly-O-Meter confirms that AncientJustice's surrogates have an inadequate grasp of acceptable scientific method and data interpretation. For that reason, I'm not in the habit of giving advice to his psychotic pickthanks. However, there's always a first time: You psychotic pickthanks should stop retarding the free and natural economic development of various countries' indigenous population. I admit I don't have much confidence that they'll follow that advice, but it's important to make it known that if my memory serves me correctly, AncientJustice believes that he is perched atop the moral high ground. If so, then maybe he should climb down to scavenge for some facts before claiming that his bunco games are our final line of defense against tyrrany. But this is something to be filed away for future letters. At present, I wish to focus on only one thing: the fact that teenagers who want to shock their parents sometimes maintain—with a straight face—that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty. Fortunately, most parents don't fall for this fraud because they know that I will stop at nothing to act honorably. My resolve cannot fully be articulated, but it is unyielding. As evidence, consider that AncientJustice has once again been pushing false and unsubstantiated charges and outright lies in order to crush people to the earth and then claim the right to trample on them forever because they are prostrate. Although for him, this behavior is as common as that of adulterous politicians seeking forgiveness from God and spouse, he doesn't use words for communication or for exchanging information. He uses them to disarm, to hypnotize, to mislead, and to deceive.
---
Didn't AncientJustice tell his rank-and-file followers that he wants to consign our traditional values to the rubbish heap of privatism? Did he first give any thought to what would happen if he did? Of course, that question is ridiculous—as ridiculous as his vilipensive-to-the-core cop-outs. He's a pusillanimous saltimbanco. I'm being super-extra nice when I say that. If I weren't so polite I instead would have stated that as much as I dream about beating AncientJustice at his own game, that's not going to happen immediately. Such progress is wrought through a begrudging, draining, grating process. The first step is for all of us to acknowledge that it's astounding that AncientJustice has somehow found a way to work the words “disadvantageousness” and “labyrinthibranchiate” into his rants. However, you may find it even more astounding that the experts agree with me that his comment that science is merely a tool invented by the current elite to maintain power is clear and simple dupery. I respectfully refrain from further comment on that topic as doing so could be misinterpreted as asserting that AncientJustice's disingenuous psychobabble is based upon a firm and vivid grasp of the concrete truths of life itself. Instead, I'll simply remark that if he isn't spiteful, I don't know who is.
---
AncientJustice consistently displays an absence of politesse. Sounds pretty impertinent, doesn't it? But is it any more so than AncientJustice's caustic plaints? Serving in his imperium is nothing short of nirvana for the worst sorts of baleful dead-enders there are—no disagreements, no arguments, no reasoning, no thinking, no responsibility. AncientJustice tells them what to do, and they do it. They never even consider that it is crystal-clear that AncientJustice would have me develop an eating disorder. And that's why I'm writing this letter. This is my manifesto, if you will, on how to confront and reject all manifestations of nonrepresentationalism. There's no way I can do that alone, and there's no way I can do it without first stating that he should not push all of us to the brink of insanity. Not now, not ever. And that's it. There are lessons to be learned from history.
---
0/8
---
No whataboutism, thanks. Don't you know anti-Trump Democrats are also pro-HK?
---
&gt; showing how shallow Hearthstone gameplay it
---
Funnily enough, the simplistic style of gameplay is a big part of the appeal.    Magic is VERY dense with a high initial learning curve that makes it difficult to get into.   Relatively simple gameplay can be a good thing, depending.  Things can easily go from complex to complicated.
---
And the lack of interaction on the opponent's turn is a plus for a pretty decent chunk of people as well I'd imagine.  Means that your plays don't get screwed over and makes the gameplay snappy.
---
I get why people like complex, deep strategies and lots of interaction, but the constant back and forth like that in an online format just completely turns me off from those games.
---
Combination of two things.
---
1) HS is very top heavy and elitist. Thijs and Kripp are pulling almost all the twitch viewers while 3-4 years ago there was a lot more variety of streamers. The same names also keep getting the invites to tournaments and GM has only made that worse. Noblord quit because of GM. 
---
Streaming HS is just not lucrative anymore when everyone flocks to the big two streamers and when the major tournament are super tough to get into. The GM roster turnover should happen more often instead of just one guy per division per season.
---
If you want to see a career in decline then watch crane333 and he made it to playoffs multiple times in the past. The system is rigged against him.
---
2) Boredom. Hafu quit because she said all hearthstone is doing is printing new cards and then go the next expansion. Rinse, repeat. Nothing happens.
---
Maaybe....
---
Thats probably the best deck I've ever seen
---
The dream is playing astral and then getting ultimate infestation on your next draw. Still looking for that dream

[Iksar on this subject back in February](https://youtu.be/a6N1iFiHZnY?t=884)
---
&gt;Shamans have been one of the most challenging classes in terms of class identity [...] The idea of the shaman is like "hey we're the jack-of-all-trades. We do a little bit of meele, we do a little bit of magic, we do a little bit of healing, we kinda do everything."
---
&gt; This is cool thematically but for a card game it's hard when a class's identity is it just does everyting [...] So we've been talking a lot about what is shaman not supposed to be good at? That's a challenging question [...] and one of the answer we've landed on for the short term is they shouldn't generate a ton of resources [...]
---
&gt; But even that is not thematically super strong so we're still kinda figuring out what shamans are supposed to be good at and what are they supposed to be bad at.
---
I wonder how much the high profile departures (Brode, Chu etc.) contributed to this...
---
The amount of stats for 1 mana. It's a free 1/1 usually on turn 1. This might not sound that crazy but let's put that in perspective: The way to calculate fair stats: mana+mana+1. What if you could play a perfect minion on curve + 1/1 every turn. Every turn you can play the max amount of stats that are fair. So, turn 1 a 1 mana 1/2. Turn 2 a 2/3. Fair stats are based on how much mana you have. Look at the basic set, add up the stats and you'll notice this pattern.  
---
Turn 4 Yeti has good stats: 4/5 &gt; Give it +1/+1 and it's a 5/6. It becomes overpowered. Such cards would have a downside usually (example: Pit Lord: 4 mana 5/6, deal 5 damage to your hero). Your opponent, if he has the same fair 4 mana stats can never trade favourably. Having the stats divided over 2 minions is arguably better than having one big minion. Point is, just an extra +1/+1 is good. So good that such cards need a downside.  
---
Now what if this happens turn 1: You get a free 1/1 with no downside. You have 1 mana to either remove 1 minion or play 1 minion. There is no coming back from that. If you don't have the same amount of stats divided over the same amount of minions the warrior can keep hitting your face every turn. If +1/+1 is overpowered on turn 4 then imagine how powerful that is on turn 1. Pirate warrior is playing 2 mana worth of stats for 1 mana. Before the nerf, Patches had charge. That made it even more insane.  
---
Pirate warrior would be play N'Zoth's Captain on turn one. 1/1 minion + 1/3 weapon + 1/1 with charge. That's a crazy amount of stats for 1 mana.
---
Wait wait wait wait what "zayle, shadow cloak", mr whizbang but bad, has fun decks??
---
Aw man I really miss Savjz, he was the best streamer
---
I have thousands of arena wins and I'm pretty sure this is the best deck I've ever seen. Other than maybe when you could luck into pre-nerf unleash the hounds/starving buzzard combo decks years ago.

Bazaar Burglary says "other classes" not "opponent's class." So, it does work if your opponent is a Rogue, but you have to use cards like Clever Disguise and Hench-Clan Burglar instead of Swashburglar and Shaku the Collector.
---
It really is classic , i played a deck like that to rank 3 "back in the day" 😁
---
So you run a 10-10 mech just to play around dirty rat?
---
&gt;Yeah this boss is a joke in normal mode. He's a normal boss except with the downside of not being able to play  anything. The heroic version has only treasures in his deck and I think is more versatile with the choices so he's slightly hard.

Hearthstone is incredibly expensive and with many expansions every year and either you need to play a lot or use money to keep up in order to play varied decks.

The matches are boring. Look at the last GM tournament it was the same 4 decks over and over and over again. How many matches of warrior vs priest vs shaman vs druid can you watch before you want to tear your eyes out? It's just so predictable.
---
As an explanation-I evolved 2 minions previous turn and forgot about zeph being on board and used Dupl, which ruined my poor 20/20 gonna be doggo
---
Shit game with greedy devs
---
wait, arena wins counts for a golden portrait?
---
Nice
---
Of course people get bored after playing the same game for 4+ years full time, especially when that game didn't receive a single major update during that time (and still hasn't). Even if it's a great game, people will get bored of doing the same thing eventually. Perfectly natural.
---
Yeah you're right about that one.
---
Holy shit that makes so much more sense now. I sincerely didn’t understand how Patches could be so good until this explanation. Thanks man cheers
---
So if they deal with a wide board of snipsnaps with a plague of murlocs, brawl or something, you have a back up win condition.  The non mechathun lists are all in.
---
2/1 is an unpopular statline right now.
---
No innovation, just rip-off card redesigns like "when x, shuffle x into someone's deck" for the last 2 years, overall lazy and saturated approach to the game from the designers' side, and of course as others have said, the rng just becomes unbearable with time.
---
Listen, my comment was only meant to warn you of a prominent mistake of new players coming into the game. Establishing a set of 2-3 viable decks is easily manageable without aggressively dusting your collection. Keeping interest in the game without the ability to brew new interesting decks and testing out mechanics is much much harder and you will cripple yourself in that regard if you maintain your current strategy.
---
So its up to you. Surely you can go on with your snarky replies to people who want to help and grind your way to legend in x days for bragging rights (though i can guarantee you nobody really gives a shit), but don't come here crying when you realize what youve done.
---
Have fun and good luck with your climb.
---
It is an alternate, or actually third, wincondition. A pretty cheap one too, because you only need to change one card to make it work, since you are already running Galvanisers and Plagues. Mecha'thun comes in handy if the opponent is able to deny you an OTK and can also answer the two full boards generated by Portal+Warper+SN1P and Glinda+Warperx5+Zilliax. 
---
Some of the more seasoned SN1P players insist Mecha'thun is like training wheels you really don't need once you have mastered the deck. But I guess running it is more a meta call, since one additional Target Dummy / Skaterbot / Annoy-o-Tron or whatever can make a bigger difference in most games than M'thun.
---
It's a known issue and hopefully will be fixed soon, but yeah it's really annoying. Just lost an arena game when I had lethal on board because the android app froze on their turn, by the time I realised and restarted it was too late and I got back in just to see them delivering the final blow :)
---
It's really bad at the moment
---
Murlocs still work. I won with like 5 or with just murlocs. Molten giants also work for most classes
---
Just state your line out loud and see if your claim still holds up.
---
No I don't. Care to enlighten me?
---
LoR stole most of the streamers are viewers, but this accounts just for the last couple of days. Generally is just boredome and frustration.
---
HS was always carried by personalities. When ppl like savjz, forsen, superjj, kolento, lifecoach, hafu... quit (streaming) it, it just ends up like it. Numbers fall and no one picks up games with falling numbers, and momentum is generally lost. 
---
Why do those ppl quit? Team 5s endless arrogance, incompetence, and unwillingness do to smth... bobby kotick pricing, now they had in the past year also quite some PR issues besides everyone already hating bobby kotick. (HotS eSports cancellation after opposite was communicated, 800ppl lay off, blitzchung, pathetic pr gigs attempting to make up for it...)
---
The only thing HS was protected so far, is that all other online CGs suck and are all based on MTG and HS itself, making the market even more satured having almost all CGs feel at best the same or simply: Just worse, as none of them truly feels "fresh".
---
Rafaam's Champion needs the art changing. China wouldn't be happy with that.
---
They have censored art specific to the Chinese version. If it was done for China, it'd be done similarly.
---
Blizzard just decided they no longer want the younger end of their target audience to deal with sex demons. Prude, perhaps, but not some grand plot. This joke needs to die.

Sherman's weakness is that they have so many cards which require you to have a board (bloodlust, flametongue, etc). So you end up with one of two situations: Shaman can't stay on the board and is terrible, or can reliably keep the board and is busted.

It's probably the same with other games / tournaments.

I think it's telling that in spite of charging us for the new Dungeon Run -like content, they are still earning less money than before, as evident with the fact that the Witchwood (with its free Monster Hunt) outperformed Rise of Shadows both in revenue and active users.
---
And I avoided the sub when the news broke out.

What do you mean with recent? Masterrules started changing with the 5D era, and right now the "link format" aka Masterrule 4 is due for a new one. We will probably get a new summoning mechanic or game element April 2020.

---
Sorry, I guess in the grand scheme of the life of the game, recent wasn’t the right word. But I played competitively for about 6 years and have never heard of any of this. So I guess what I meant was, it happened later in the life of the game, it wasn’t like that at all early on.
---
You haven’t done anything, you just prove that you fucking suck and give out insults and can’t back them up with actually playing.
---
Meh, the fact that this sub isn't spammed anymore doesn't mean that what Blizzard did wasn't shitty or that people have "forgotten".
---
Blizzard has back pedalled significantly so I guess most people are (begrudgingly) ok with that.
---
Not playing wild, but does having all combo pieces in opening hand is even good?
---
OP was the druid tho.
---
Will do!
---
It is very pay to win and Blizzard has turned into a company that only cares about money, so I definetly recommend another ccg
---
What do you expect? Obviously, eventually it would die down just like anything else. I don't think that means everyone was karma whoring. Just that humans have actual lives to get on with.
---
The first few posts were lgeminate and with the people leaving, but then there was karma whores after when blizzard was the #1 topic.
---
One of the best decks I have ever seen.
---
CCG's, or any focused MP game for that matter, aren't really suited for very short term playing. You want to learn how to play and build a collection. That being said, HS isn't P2W in the slightest. One can easily make a competitive deck with new player experience rewards. The incentive to pay is variety. 
---
P2W comments come from people who use it to rationalise their own incompetency, or are simply being misleading to new players for the sake of it.

What are you expecting? The Hearthstone subreddit to become the new HK Protest subreddit? I just stopped playing. I voice my opinions elsewhere. If you're still playing this game/supporting Activision Blizzard you're clearly a lost cause/ a huge asshole, so why waste time.
---
But 1) I can't combo fast enough to attack and 2) playing the mech that reduces the cost of mechs by 1 and then the Portal leaves Sn1p's cost at 1. Is that a bug?

I think those are good cards, except for Mad Bomber...

Not sure what happened to Gorehowl... was awesome card
---
I mean... this is Reddit. What do you expect?
---
Also: Csgo is always back from the dead somehow.
---
Went up by like 10k.  
---
A lot of the outrage was fueled by looky-lous upvoting the drama.
---
Kkkkkkkk better have brainless selfish people spamming well played and waiting the rope to end
---
You're right I so prefer having every single post be about something other than the video game that it was made to be for. Let's just keep posting the same information that was already posted before with no new information having been released on the matter.
---
For me just another indicator for Blizzard games not being political platforms...
---
They never did.
---
Did you not hear the news? We've all migrated to /r/LegendsOfRuneterra
---
No, it's called [[overflow]]
---
Let's get real - you're not spending 30 minutes watching your opponent play minions. You spend a turn watching them play a massive board, cry, then concede. There's a lot of bad things to say about that deck, but it taking forever really isn't one of them.

7/-/- | Restore 5 Health to all characters. Draw 5 cards.  
---
But you won?
---
I have some old cards. Are there rewards for new players that are worth starting over? I never had that good cards. I feel like hs could be the game I can come back to if lor fails or isn't fun, not sure about other ccgs.
---
Fuck Blizzard
---
My favorite phrase I hear is "HS isn't pay to win, it's pay to have fun. That really holds true. You certainly can make a few decks as a free-to-play player and climb high in the ranks, but won't be able to play every cool deck.
---
One of the best decks right now is Murloc Shaman and it's like 2000 dust for the whole deck. That's super achievable for anyone first getting into the game.
---
I made a comparison with a game I am familiar with. I played Hearthstone, and I still play Yugioh. You are comparing a physical cardgame that released 1999 to a 2014 digital CCG release. Never did I state anywhere that it is okay for Yugioh to take 9 years of time to develop new Ideas either. I even made the comparison of how the content is streamlined differently, how the new printed cards are actually a new way to play the game unlike hearthstone. It's simply has the superior game design period.
---
But you see: Let's say I were to make a new car, my own design and brand. Should I start making Cars like back in the early 1900's? Should I be given "the time" to adapt to the new current age first?
---
No. People have already made the first experiences with developing something (MTG and Yugioh in this case) and used that to develop their games further.
---
Car manufacturers do the same. A brand new car from a new company will be made in a modern setting with all the current standards and features.
---
This is no excuse for Blizzard to just keep a game the same since the Beta with 0 updates that change the fundamental aspect of the game to the better with all the given flaws right now.
---
If that outrage contributed to getting more attention to the media and government, that's better everyone being quiet about it?
---
True. Also I think it was a pretty low effort effect to raise awareness. When you are just literally copying and pasting  the same message everyday, people will start to get numb to the message.
---
The fundamental issue isn't with echo cards, it's with Merchwarper. They just need to change the card effect to be consistent with Summoning Portal and that priest Deathrattle discount card (forgot it's name). Heck, even Raza is a precedent to this.
---
This would limit one to 10 Sn1p-Snaps in a turn, assuming both portal and warper stay on board until the next turn.
---
A lot of people have left the scene, and a lot of people have stopped playing Hearthstone. This isn’t normal fan moaning over some small controversy, this has been a watershed for many long term fans regarding Blizzard after a few years of steep decline in both quality and ethics.
---
In a few years time Blizzard will be a totally different company with a totally different fan base and you Will look back in this as the big turning point towards that.
---
It's programmed to always attack if it can so it doesn't give you an impossible to win game by never attacking since it's perma stealthed as long as it has a weapon equipped.
---
If blizzard suffered actual financial consequences as a result of a boycott that was caused by their actions on the HK/China issue, especially if it lead to bankruptcy, that would actually do quite a lot. It would send a strong message to other firms that they should not bend to demands in the Chinese markets.
---
You are correct in the sense that there is ~0% of this actually happening, but it would have an impact. To make changes in the world you need to take actions, and boycotting the Orwellian regime that exists in China is one way to have an impact. To do this you would need to boycott Chinese goods, and companies that actively work with the Chinese government. 
---
But it's like with the NBA, most people aren't invested enough in taking a stand to give up following basketball. So while people will go to the games and wear tshirts to send a signal that they oppose the CCP there won't actually be any ramifications from it.
---
I think Hong Kong will end up with a repeat of Tiananmen, the protesters will not back down. They know this is effectively the last stand for their freedom and the majority of the island are on side. The CCP cannot allow this "insolence" to continue for too much longer, it is already embarrassing and is escalating daily. Live rounds have been fired once, it is only a matter of time before they are used again and there is a body count. The only reason this has not been done thus far is because the eyes of the world are on HK.
---
Blizzard may be inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. But if HK goes south fast it won't look good to have appeared to be on the pro-CCP side of it, and if it took this outrage to get more eyes on HK I'm very glad people went OTT in their reaction.
---
Xi Jingping and his communist party need to die in a fire.
---
To add insult to injury, you’re saying that about a game as mediocre as Hearthstone.
---
Being able to play cards in your hand for 0 mana is okay, being able to play the same card infinitely is not okay
---
I tried a ramp druid deck like this. Only got it to happen 1 out of 6.
---
Thanks!!
---
What's laughable is your spelling and grammar. You're clearly not educated enough to have any opinions worth hearing.
---
EU lust#2780 i show (check my history. i´ve done trades b4)
---
Lol, ahhhh!!!
---
That’s armchair activism for you!
---
So when is Blizz planning on banning those players/making them change their names?
---
Sad but true lol
---
i mean if only shudderwock did not replay grumble’s battlecry first 🤷‍♂️
---
Or this sneaky mage could have teched in Poly too. End his whole career.

It’s just not a very good game 🤷‍♂️
---
I have not played the game since I decided to leave. I am still subscribed because I want to see updates, at least until Blizzcon. 
---
There also could be lots of inactive accounts. The posts or comments per day is probably the best long term stat to monitor.

---
does corrupt the waters always start in your starting hand?
---
Nah bro. these are not the Warcraft/ Starcraft dudes, they were cool, these guy’s ain’t cool bro
---
Chess is a much deeper game than hearthstone.
---
The Diablo stuff isn't a big deal and will be forgotten when they announce Diablo 4 and Diablo 2 remaster this year.
---
What happened last year was unfortunate, but what was suppose to happen was Diablo 4 + Diablo Immortal, and Diablo 4 got dropped and they didn't change the schedule.
---
Not only a pro, a member of The Hall of Fame
---
The quest starts in your hand every game.
---
Saying "Hijacking top comment" then also saying "this wasn’t a karma farm"
---
During the RoS meta, while playing Control Warrior I would auto-concede any Warrior mirror match I ran into.  
---
Reason being I didn't run Elysiana because it ended up as a dead card in your hand against literally every other deck in the game.  But without it I had zero chance of winning a mirror match, and they would take 45 minutes to an hour to finish if my opponent was playing slowly.  So yeah, fuck that noise.  Concede before mulligan, wait 10 seconds for the counter queue, and hit the button again.
---
Lol no shit. They're reinstalling hearthstone as we speak.
---
For me its always time fallacy that gets me 5 years since i entered Inn.
---
&gt; Which rules sets are those?
---
Blitz, rapid, bullet, etc.  Traditional chess is a completely different game compared to what popular streamers are doing online, even if the rules for moving the pieces haven't changed much.
---
&gt;Chess clocks existed for decades.
---
...I know.  Decades are not centuries. 
---
&gt;This occurred several centuries ago.
---
Pawn promotion rules were changing and hotly debated up until about 140 years ago.  That's not "several centuries".  Much of the specifics of the game as we know it were codified from the 1830s to the 1880s.
---
so not revolution of our time.. but of the week?
---
Would like to add that it's great with consecration to clear a 3 drop minion together with other low health minions
---
I don’t give two shits about karma. Check my profile. I don’t post for karma. I just wanted to get the message out there that I know tons of real people that were Blizzard gamers until this HK controversy happened and they ALL uninstalled and haven’t gone back.
---
At what point do the mods just start to remove these posts? This is a game subreddit about Hearthstone. If you want to go complain about HK go do it on political forums, if you want to go complain about blizzard go do it on the blizzard sub.
---
The Hearthstone issue has been resolved, if you want to stop playing because you still hate Blizzard good for you, stop playing and stop posting on this sub about the fact that you’re not playing.
---
Chinese money
---
Free Puerto Rico!
---
Well yeah no shit. Magic is a good card game and Hearthstone is like going into a casino but you don't win any money.
---
If you edit your reply within 1 minute you won't get the * next to your post indicating it's been edited. So the trick is to put a card name in your post and then edit it quickly to a joke. The bot still replies and your joke makes everyone laugh and laugh.
---
Yea, that guy needs to stop ruining people's memes with logic...
---
uhh you have mc tech and shoot lackey in hand but didn't trade before the plague? Deserved punish then imo
---
Why would they ban a name that defends the Pride of China? It is a known fact, not a political statement that Hong Kong in Chinese.
---
It’s a shame Hearthstone isn’t a Dreamhack event anymore. Competitive Hearthstone was so much more vibrant before the GM league became a thing.
---
It's absolutely trash but I wonder at what mana cost it starts to be broken in the other direction. 8 is clearly too high, but I have a feeling it could be oppressive sooner than I'd like to give it credit for. I think the real problem is the types of secrets we have available in mage right now.
---
The obvious comparison is Mysterious Challenger. Mysterious Challenger was meta-defining (and is back in vogue). It's a 6 mana 6/6 that, at maximum, plays 5 paladin secrets at a total of 5 mana. Unless you have a tech card ready, MC really swings the game for the paladin.
---
Although mage secrets are better (hence the extra mana cost), a secret-centric paladin deck works better because if you draw a secret in the early game it's not a dead card. Playing Glacial Mysteries makes you want to actively *not* draw your secrets, which is a tall ask, since you'll probably be playing 10 (or more!) secrets in your deck.
---
More importantly though, in my opinion, paladin secrets lend themselves to a more aggressive playstyle, whereas mage secrets are more about control - and a card that burns 5 spells from your deck isn't conducive to a control deck.
---
With more aggressive secrets a la Explosive Runes, I could see Glacial Mysteries being at least playable, and with a modified mana cost, potentially broken.
---
How many times do you want people to post that they're "going to quit". What if those people actually quit? Most of us come here for hearthstone's game news, funny clips and memes
---
It's a tactic referred to as "outdating the outrage" wherein you do the barest minimum of effort to repent for an action and then sit back and watch as an army of people do your work for you, for free, by telling people they can't be upset anymore because something has been done. 
---
It doesn't matter if the changes made are effectively meaningless. Backpedaling ever so slightly on the reaction doesn't hit a magical CTRL + Z and undo what had been done, or the reasons why it was done. That still exists as a moment in history, and it remains very troubling that Blizzard is willing to do it at all just to gain favor with an oppressive government. There's an old saying about not being able to un-punch someone's face no matter what you say afterwards, and I think it applies here.
---
Sure (but in his case he wouldn't need it in his bookmarks because he doesn't visit it)
---
Crusdale#2493 EU 80g trade :) Ill show and you go first 
---
Done with Aegeus#21898
---
Nah it definitely loses more to secret mage the hardest talking meta decks alone, and obviously you can tech against it super hard, just goodluck beating anything else
---
He posted to this post within an hour. I think he still loves Hearthstone.
---
This card is garbage, but it was a pretty big deal due to it weakening Mages spell pool.
---
Similar to shatter and freeze potion.
---
I play it but I don't have any other good warlock cards and I'm not sure I can be bothered crafting 4 epics and 3 legendary cards to have a cancer deck I hope is nerfed.
---
baku was broken, genn was fine. its aboout power level, not being samey. I liked the consistently genn provided.
---
An average win rate of 8 in arena would make you one of the best arena players in the world *presses doubt button* It’s most likely that you’re just bad at the game and think you’re making correct plays when you’re not. You have to be playing horrifically bad to fall from 16-&gt;19
---
I haven't played since it happened.
---
I don't think I will unless Blizzard makes a significant apology and admits they were wrong. I doubt that will happen.
---
I missed HS the first few days, I was a daily player, but I find I'm missing it less and less.
---
I'm not as likely to post here now, but what happened forever changed my feelings about Blizzard.
---
coin, loot horder?
---
i wasn't subbed
---
So you're upset that people aren't brigading this sub just as hard as they did last week? You can only dust your cards once and there is a plethora of other subs dedicated to the situation. 
---
And in all honesty I'm more concerned about my own country and it's treasonous president at the moment.
---
Where is your... best friend?
---
To be fair I only started playing in the summer so perhaps that's why?
---
Edit: to answer my own question. I went on the blizzard site logged into my account and it was in the shop for free
---
Thanks for making me aware of this
---
Sure, we haven't forgotten, but that also doesn't mean we want the Hearthstone subreddit to double as the boycott Blizzard subreddit.
---
Seventy-Onerd!
---
Not that it matters anyway with that brainlet deck
---
It's also there to dilute epic pulls so that, on average, a player will open more packs before they get everything they need. It's also why objectively terrible legendaries like Duskfallen Aviana exist.
---
They were banning "SupportHK" because "Support" is banned to prevent people pretending to be Blizzard Support Staff.
---
Please continue not forgetting on the relevant subs. This ain't that
---
exaggeration in humor is quite common but ok we can agree to disagree
---
Yeah sorry to say but people like me just don't talk about it much or maybe even at all but we still feel very strongly.  I quit Hearthstone a couple years ago because I was fed up with their awful and predatory monetization practices and I skipped this WoW expo for the first time ever because of their inability to listen to their players.  But in light of this HK issue I've also quit all the other Blizz games entirely because I not only care and complain about issues like the HK one, I also do something about it, even if it's just adding my voice (and my spending power) to the cause.
---
I stopped playing. "Vote with your wallet" doesn't mean "make a post on Reddit." Blizz has made more money from me than I care to calculate over &gt;10 years. Now that consistent cash stream is gone.
---
Void contract is also up there
---
You seem like a smart guy, you should be able to figure the odds out by yourself
---

---
Oh no, exaggeration in humor is quite common. It's just never used to exaggerate factual statements. Context matters. Don't leave it out.
---
Second fastest way to get banned by Blizzard
---
Funniest bit: Borderlands 3 popping up for like a week or two and immediately dying.
---
I quit, and am not going back. I've found better places for my money to go and my time to be spent. As long as other people truly felt the same way and moved on, then that's all we can ask. 
---
People will continue to play the game whether I want them to or not.
---
50/50, it happens or it doesnt
---
Yeah, you burn a random card from your deck. But that could be anything.
---
I admit I'm not super up to date on Astral decks, but I didn't think they went to fatigue often enough for that to matter. If they run tutors like Juicy Psychmelon to hit key combo pieces, then a random burn could be meaningful even if the deck doesn't hit fatigue.
---
3 packs per wing and a golden pack for the last wing. Yes, that’s it.
---
As a French I didn't realize until I saw your comment, because here we don't have seventy one, instead we have a magnificent "sixty and eleven"
---
The thing is - if there was only 1 toe to play, would you play that one note over and over again and then claimed it's Für Elise and, when confronted, challenged people to find a sequence that gets closer? That would seem silly, wouldn't it?
---
I think we can all agree that there's not much to work with on those feet. But I don't think "approximating" melodies that can't be played on them is something you can title as actually playing those melodies and expect people to be OK with it. It's at best misleading.
---
I support your quest to play various things on them but I think you'd be better off either finding melodies that can be played properly or being more clear about those, that can't. It would save you the disappointment of people like me, who checked your post expecting to hear the actual theme but ended up just confused.
---
thats because they moved to the proper subreddits
---
Oh, wow - lots of places to improve. Is there a way to skip intro dialogues, or does it just rely on something like “spells cost HP” + “stone fox statue” and OTK turn 1 every time?
---
People don't seem to understand how Lackeys broke deck building restrictions.
---
Ethereal lackey made vanish too easy to get without ever running a vanish.
---
Without lackeys we wouldn't have gotten to this point.
---
Of course the outrage is as fake as 99%of the posters here. Gimme a break. I’m surprised it took a week I was guessing 3 days tops. Let’s hear it for “we really don’t give a fuck about Hong Kong” as long as we have our blizzard crack for our little brains to engage in.
---
What do you want me to do post every day that I quit hearthstone?  I'm not playing anymore that's how I'm continuing to protest it. Leave the people who want to play alone.
---
It should trigger the first one first, but nothing actually dies until it goes to the death phase.  They'll both go into the queue as dead, so they should both still die and come out a tie.
---
Zaphod #2651 EU Quest trade.
---
Ive seen this on Trolden, both die.
---
one of the deathrattles would trigger first, i'm pretty sure.
---
Not sure what the issue is but other people have reported it recently
---

---
If OP is at 30, then he can win by racing. The Mechathun deathrattles won't matter because of the Portals.
---
Ye step up  man. You might get yourself some selfsuck points. Reddit eouldbe so weird without karmasystem. All bitchbois would stop acting like white knights..
---
&gt;My fear is that bc of shamans quest giving them so much guranteed value, the strongest deck for the next year will be quest shaman. Wanna make a shaman deck you think will be fun to take on ladder? Go ahead but the question is always gonna be why aren’t you playing the quest instead?
---
That line of questioning seems really rather paranoid, especially with Aggro and Murloc Shamans having consistently better raw winrates.
---
&gt;And then the weaker quests could be buffed slightly to balance them out more. 
---
Out of everything that could be buffed, buffing quests would probably be the most dangerous thing possible.
---
The Caverns Below was slaughtered by changing one number, that one number was enough to make it completely unplayable until the release of Viscous Scalehide.
---
Changing Hack the System, Activate the Obelisk, Unseal the Vault, and Raid the Sky Temple by a similar amount could easily create a very similar situation we had with The Caverns Below or are potentially having with Untapped Potential or Corrupt the Waters. 
---
&gt;Idk about you but I don’t wanna be playing against quests decks and only that for the next year lol that’s all I’m doomsaying about rn
---
If what Quest Druid and Quest Shaman weren't built around the same mechanic, would you be okay with them?
---
Do you never want to see decks in Standard last their full possible lifespan?
---
It’s actually probably a fairly good system. If you have some ultra popular channel that can just start throwing out sponsored videos every day and stay on top of the algorithm it would be terrible for users.
---
I constantly quit h stone and am reeled back in by watching content.
---
I think it's a ass game that makes for a great show imo. They really took the 7/10 for everyone approach vs the amazing experience for a niche; which I believe TCG need to do to be great
---
how tho?
---
A friend and I were trying to identify the single worst minion in the game according to this exact criteria the other day. There are so many underwhelming cards which rarely amount to anything amazing, like Angry Chicken, but they don't really punish you, they are just weak. And then there are cards which work against you most of the time, like Millhouse and Duskfallen Aviana, but still have fringe cases where they can let you come out ahead. We settled on a single card where we felt that was essentially never true.
---
[[Arcane Golem]]. You only get 1 stat more than the standard for a well-statted minion at the same cost - at the cost of giving your opponent an extra mana every turn thereafter. Even in a situation where the Mana doesnt punish you, i.e. playing it after turn 10, there isnt anything you gain by playing Arcane Golem specifically that couldn't be gained (if not outdone) by playing a number of other cards in its place. You're not going to play it at 3 mana, and there are more impactful bodies you can play at 10 mana. At that point there's so many other cards you might as well be playing instead.
---
Millhouse is definitely really close and similar, but in a case where the opponent doesn't actually have any worthwhile spells in their hand, playing a 4/4 on turn 2 can actually be a huge tempo advantage and the beginnings of a victory. I've lost to it in Arena before. There are super fringe cases where playing a 4/4 on turn 3 could be the difference between winning and losing - but not when it gives the opponent extra Mana. And unlike Millhouse, there's never a way around it.
---
My friend mentioned that he has never seen it played since it's been nerfed, and he's right. There isnt a deader card...which is crazy considering it used to be a staple and a win condition. The one place it has shown up is in the co-op Brawls, where it's used to help the other player ramp their mana up. Because that's the one thing it's actually really effective at....lol

I've stopped playing the game or supporting Blizzard in any form, but I do love their games. I'm still using this subreddit to keep up to date in the hope that the company will reform. As far as I can tell, my participation in this subreddit doesn't impact Blizzard at all.
---
Just a story of caution to anybody frequenting this thread.
---
Soon after posting for my quest here, I was added by someone by the name of Keef ( I do not know if posting battletag is allowed in this context) who claimed he had the quest and wanted me to go first.
---
I agreed on the condition that he show his quest first, which he refused. He claimed he has posted some pic online on Hearthpwn as proof of having the quest but despite asking repeatedly, he didn't share any link.
---
There is a known scammer by the name of Keef in the list. When I mentioned this to him, he said his battletag was whitelisted. However, this wasn't mentioned anywhere in the list, which has certain whitelisted battletags with the same name as scammers. When I pressed him further, he unfriended me.
---
Later, this nice guy added me and we shared each other's quest. When I told him about the incident, he said someone by the name of Keef had tried to scam him a few days back by claiming he had shown the quest when he had not. When he refused to go first without proof, Keef got rude and hurried him to commence with the challenge.
---
I wish there was some provision to ban such poison to the community. In any case, take care folks and check the list of scammers before committing.
---
Because 1. it has nothing to do with wild 2. blizz did nothing wrong and 3. even if you disagree with 2. you're not helping anyone by boycotting blizz.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/ Do those things if you want to help hongkong and stop expecting that commitment from a videogame company.
---
I still enjoy Hearthstone content and being part of the community, but I can't bring myself to play it or any other Blizzard game that I used to love. It just makes me feel gross.
---
Yes but then the valanyr deathrattles hit and buff them up and it just keeps exponentially growing.
---
Agreed.  The mods have clearly had a "We're tired of hearing about this" approach to the censorship/HK issue and are just using the closest possible excuse.  Or just removing threads without explanation.  But there is also little that we can say about it beyond "We're still angered about your conduct, Blizzard", most of the threads are news and opinion from new sources.
---
I came in here ready to tell people off and say basically the same thing ("what do you want?") but I was pleasantly surprised to see the top responses are actually quite reasonable and sensible.
---
&gt;Pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't work, as a matter of fact it makes everything worse.
---
Well, when it comes to bad PR, it often does work. Blizzard is just going to stay quiet and reduce chances for people to keep the story going. Let a new news story come in and let the wave of outrage die down. These sort of things blow over all the time.

I think their biggest problem is their current library. People wouldn’t care as much if they were enjoying the product. It’s been a long year for Blizz with many missteps, they’re putting everything into this Blizzcon to turn things around. No more controversy talk for a couple weeks and a good convention with big announcements changes the conversation.
---
As far as other companies throwing them under the bus, it’s a temporary thing. They don’t want to be attached to the company while the name is controversial. They’ll keep doing business when things have blown over and they can make money together again.

Civils Rights Movment in the US was 1960s man, and you don't get much more Capitilst than 1960s america. You'll have heard of that one, but I could list countless small scale from the UK in my lifetime, such as the ban on fox hunting, or gay rights.

Activism works all the time, and governments the world over are fluid entities, even if sometimes it doesn't feel so history always proves otherwise.

But they don’t have better winrates than quest and didn’t have better winrates than quest even before the event (I would know bc I played Murloc shaman to 70 legend last month) 
---
I agree they’ve had better winrates in the past, but that’s the past. That was before shaman got this quest. 
---
And the questioning is paranoid you’re right, and for good reason. It wasn’t that long ago we had gen and baku that gave guranteed value and that limited variety so much they rotated them. I feel like unless blizzard just stops printing good battlecries for the next year, why not play quest shaman? Because in its current state (pre event) it’s gonna always be better than the other archetypes of shaman in standard until things are changed/ rotate. But that’s just my opinion lol
---
And the quests I propose buffing would be the weaker ones that are in wild, that would shake up wild (which it needs) and not affect standard with even more quest decks lol

For curious people:
---
`Total Damage = (3 * (3 + (8 * (Velen's Chosens + 15)))) * (60 - Velen's Chosens)`
---
This can be solved by hand. Multiply out:
---
3(3+8(x+15))\*(60-x) = (24x+369)(60-x) = -24x\^2 + 1440x - 369x + 22140 = -24x\^2 + 1071x + 22140
---
Take the derivative and set to 0 (Setting the derivative to 0 gives us either a total damage value that isn't changing with x, indicating that it is a maximum):
---
d(damage)/d(velen's) = d/dx(-24x\^2 + 1071x +22140) = -48x + 1071 = 0
---
Solve: 1071 = 48x =&gt; x = 1071/48 = 22.313

Swapping heroes acts like ice block.  OP has gone through two heroes in two turns.
