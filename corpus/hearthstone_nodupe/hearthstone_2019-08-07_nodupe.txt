He chooses one random deck recipe (out of 18).  
---
 
---
He gets 9 new decks every expansion (and some updates to the last 9 new decks introduced).  
---
  
---
I crafted a gold one day 1, no regrets.
---
could you share your decklist, dear Regis?
---
I got the rogue one, it's just feeling really mediocre so far. Just doesn't feel like enough of a win condition. (I also got the priest one from my packs, also feels pretty bad.)
---
So, one match is the standard at which you can judge how good a deck is?
---
To me, it sounds like you're playing something almost completely passive and the Mage drew extremely well.
---
Take Golden Candle. Destroyed all the final bosses‚Äô decks
---
In 10+ games I only got the new paladin deck twice.
---
What happens when it goes to wild will they stop updating his decks?
---
Not that I don't believe you but got proof?
---
It was the first Deathwing. I read it somewhere like gamepedia I think but I'm too lazy to check.
---
I feel ya.
---
Try 4 in 123 packs.
---
Never buying these bundles again, what a waste of money.
---
3 in 83 and then 1 in 40 from 40 packs purchased with gold.
---
Yeah :/
---
i got warrior quest and armagedillo, today was not a good day.
---
What? You just add it to tempo rogue and change a couple cards. An extra 3 damage per turn is always good in tempo
---
It only looks at the board and mana (and number of cards in hand and deck and stuff) not the other cards your opponent plays in their deck, so while a poly would be better since the opponent is rez priest, it doesn't know that, so in a vacuum arcanite reaper is better.
---
Something that doesnt require Divine Spirit/Inner Fire because it is awful and unfun to play or play against
---
What legendaries are performing well? I want to craft gold ones before i open packs and then use the no dupolicate thing so i dont get regular ones
---
Do you have somewhere where you post decklists? 
---
I love to play jank.
---
But completing the quest isn't that reliable in that situation. The one cards doing anything would be blink foxes, and if I add in more thief cards it messes up the tempo of the tempo rogue. I did basically do just what you said, but it just didn't feel consistent in completing the quest or in winning in tempo.

[[Saronite Taskmaster]] and [[Mad Summoner]] are neutral cards that can be used to disrupt res priest. They're kind of bad though.
---
I love this post so much! Haha, thanks for making it. I‚Äôm right there with you. I just took out a Paladin that had 30 health AND 30+ armor... and that was AFTER he had already fully healed too. And then there was the Druid match with all of those ridiculously annoying dormant lucent-barks that I must have killed 3 times each before finally pulling a plague in fatigue mode... which destroyed them all for the final time and I could finally go for the killing blow. 
---
Glad someone else is having just as much fun with it as I am (I‚Äôve only ever played Rogue since beta, and I literally dust every single other card that isn‚Äôt Rogue/neutral in order to craft golden Rogue sets!).

---
I didn't even consider that. Infinite Edwin.
---
Missed this card during spoilers, was fun to find out about it after it pulled my Octosari
---
He knew which hero power was chosen.
---
Quest sucks
---
Put your trust in the light.
---
I found proof it is him.
---
How about some twisting nether?
---
Yeah. I hate *these types* of inconsistencies...
---
Pretty good luck in my pulls! 18 packs with 3 legendaries; Zyphrys, Reno, and Corrupt the Waters. I also got Bazaar Burglary from the free cards for logging in. Overall pretty happy with lots of gold to spare for the PvE out in September.
---
I crafted this quest and I either have runs where I finish by turn 3 and juice my tess to the nuts or runs where I draw 0 burglar cards
---
What why? That's really good
---
This is correct.
---
Ohhh gotcha. I didnt see that card mentioned so I was a bit confused. I am excited to try out the rogue quest tonight!
---
They want to avoid crystal cove.
---
https://outof.cards/members/regiskillbin/decks
---
But I hate to break it to you, all of my decks are perfect and amazing and never lose.
---
It still takes till turn 9, plenty of time to reduce shaman down to 0 hp. And even with double shudderwock if they haven't gotten their good battlecry card out, it doesn't do much. Btw it can still be done by holding the coin and waiting till turn 10. I've done it 3 times today.
---
Now I need to try a Highlander Murlocadin.
---
Every mage I‚Äôve played so far who used the quest on turn one didn‚Äôt even need it to beat me. It‚Äôs the most ‚Äúeh win more maybe?‚Äù card.
---
Maybe he's surprised you managed to win as priest
---
Bottom of rank 5 against opponent at rank 6, I'd concede out of courtesy. But cool combo.
---
I got Corrupt The Waters for free, and assumed it was free for everyone...
---
Oh my... It was rhe only legendary i opened in 30 packs... Sink me
---
Praise Yogg
---
Got it as my golden legendary! So excited to play it!
---
There is 2 that give murlocs boosted stats. And sure no murlocs are big but they tend to have a good stat pool.
---
You're not going to get anyone who plays it to stop. There are people who do enjoy playing it.
---
You just gotta start over. Dust all your cards and then make a new account.
---
Just play the lackey version
---
20 Packs - Warlock quest, and golden Plague of Murlocs + Golden Wild Bloodstinger were the only things I‚Äôve gotten this time around.
---
Correct. I too frequently craft the gold legendaries I want before opening my packs. Can confirm they just check if you have the card. Gold or not.
---
Lmao FeelsBadMan
---
Sorry bro..I don't have them all either
---
I got that one and Making Mummies (golden legendary for pre-ordering)
---
I got SUPREME ARCHEOLOGY!!!!!
---
Here is your music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_P3UtZXAA
---
87 packs and got 4 Legendaries. I got the Shaman and Paladin Quests as well as that Deathrattle draw 8 and that card that generates the perfect card. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with the reveals so I have no idea what most of the news cards are so playing should be a surprise.
---
Oddly specific
---
I went to a water park for the day. Does that count?
---
1/4 of the way to octosari baby!!
---
Eh, for an amazing play on his part you can disrupt a significant amount of that pressure.  Timber Wolf into trade into UTH and you remove a few of his big threats.
---
Yes, but his other half is orc, so I found it fitting since Ogre‚Äôs aren‚Äôt playable races for simplicity
---
60 packs, shaman quest and Vessina for free, only two other legendaries but they were Zephrys and Siamet which were the two I was looking to craft. Pretty happy overall!
---
I got vessina on my preorder which was one i wanted. I think siamats safe. Not sure what else. I prioritise on cards which give me more gold cards if you get what i mean (jaina, etc)
---
I‚Äôve looked at those lists because I pulled both Elise and the Druid quest, but why are there so many duplicates in the highlander lists?
---
You got the only 3 completely unplayable quests in one pack :U
---
This game has gotten so stupid. How can they print insane combo after insane combo, absurd value engine after absurd value engine. The game is better when your control finisher is something like mind control or just plopping down ragnaros or ysera. Not playing seven 0 mana king crushes. There are so many things wrong with this
---
Man I dont see how this is intuitive at all. Kingsbane healed you from death, because the card is still going on. Puzzle Box doesnt even though the card is still going on
---
A card that I'm going to use for the next 3 months and wouldn't have had enough for otherwise
---
Reminds me of "TIL Choose One and Combo don't work with Brann" posts.
---
Total 10

8 from packs :) feels good

If you have a Golden legendary, you cannot get the regular one from packs unless you have all from that set. Source - I have many golden legendaries (semi whale).

Wow.. I just opened the 3 packs I'd got from dailies/brawl or wherever they came from and got Hack The System, and Zephrys! I never have luck like that with new expansions!
---
I still have 4100 gold to spend on packs, but I couldn't resist just throwing together a deck with these to experiment with, and so far I'm liking them both a lot

You can see it in the game, artist probably just accidentally put the arm back an extra layer, while the finger-nails were a separate layer from the arm
---
You‚Äôll probably get a legendary very very soon. That‚Äôs super unlucky.
---
65 packs: Sir Finley, King Phaoris, Druid/Hunter/Mage/Warrior quests + Paladin quest freebie

It's not all about collecting. What happens when you have everything you want? Do you stop playing? I find enjoyment in climbing the ladder effeciently with my current collection.  Albeit i have no idea what it's like to start now...there definitely is some catch-up. I do have a large collection but i still use the jankiest decks. I've come full circle. 
---
A single legendary is 1600 so a whole deck for 2000 is on the cheap side. Im probably embelishing a bit but it really is only commons and uncommons + leeroy and basic cards. Cheap aggro is the way to go. Druid is very good at it right now and warlock always is. Look into zoo warlock because it has always been around and always will be.
---
Made a mogu cultist deck today without mogu cultists.
---
Didn't realize for a couple games -_-

I guess I‚Äôd prefer them be epic than legendary

No

We need to have an intervention with warrior.  It‚Äôs getting out of hand.

I personally consider EDH and cEDH to be two separate formats (even though they technically aren‚Äôt). In the majority of commander play graveyard strats are fine and don‚Äôt warp the meta at all. Heck, I would also argue that cEDH doesn‚Äôt have any warping of the meta from graveyard stuff. cEDH has all sorts of combo wins all over the format that don‚Äôt involve the graveyard. There are tons of ways to go infinite.

Damn. Feels bad. I always find myself picking up duplicates in my arena runs. He must have gotten one of them offered early and rolled with it

So basically you want it to be an entirely different card?
---
People are going to hate me for this, opened 33 packs, and including the free legendary, got the following
---
- Finley
---
- Zephyr
---
- Siamat
---
4 quests
---
That's exactly what I'd wished for
---
Nope
---
i get 2 legendaries on 48 packs .\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
---
Yeah the guy was really cool about it too, he went down to 1 HP, emoted the whole time. Like, what do you even do?
---
This is legitimately fantastic. Amazing post!

Yeah.  Makes sense but also I love shadowstep so I‚Äôm sad.
---
This IS feedback
---
I feel this way about quest shaman.
---
50 packs got priest quest and warlock lackey legendary, got rogue quest for free. Reminded me to never buy packs again :D
---
Golden one is accurate. It's a snake.
---
I'm 14-2 so far. Most meme decks I've tried have not done that well. It's basically like old murloc paladin back when call to arms was a thing. Zephrys is an amazing finishing tool. I'm not sold on nomi yet, as I've won every game so far without actually milling.
---
Haha thanks for warning me

They specifically said that it doesn't look at private information like what is in you or your opponent's hand.
---
So it will not know if you have a Vargoth or a Windfury or an Electra Stormsurge in your hand, as examples.
---
Yep, though some decks can build some big minions, so getting a few big golems can be useful.
---
Not really hes prolly talking about wild
---
Yes
---
I don‚Äôt mind this as much as getting duplicates of an epic that is strong but doesn‚Äôt do anything unique. The nice thing about mogu and the obelisk is they do stuff no other cards do, which means there is a chance somewhere down the road a card will be printed that makes them broken or they take up a design space blizzard wants to explore either case results in the card being nerfed and lots of dust for you.
---
got warlock one :(
---
Wow a legendary every 8 packs is crazy lucky
---
My best is 20, so I would assume I‚Äôve worse than feces
---
Is he fitting you with weapons in the form of words
---
I‚Äôve got the whole game recorded, and it‚Äôs all thanks to spreading plague holding off until I pulled the combo.
---
Probably impractical, but Mortuary Machine answers Mecha'thun pretty well if they don't have removal left that doesn't belong to their combo, so they basically can't win. That is such a niche situation though that probably happens once in a blue moon. Maybe we'll see it on Trolden one day.
---
Well I opened 89 packs and I got 8 legendarys(including the free one). I got a great pull!
---
I mean, how could even be mad at that. That was absolutely insane. Right up there with the near infinite Shudderwock builds that kept popping up when it first released
---
I got warlock, hunter quest and also zephyrs. Don‚Äôt know how to feel
---
I'm talking about ON BOARD though.
---
When you get Paladin quest as your free card and Finley as the 10 pack legendary
---
My run sucked, I ended at 2 wins. But now I have a rogue deck sitting at 9-0
---
There is, but the window is wonky. I dipped down to -1 playing plot twist against bomb warrior the other day and then got both of those taunts that heal when drawn and won the game
---
Can someone explain how the combo hunter is played?
---
You're 14-2 so far because you're playing an aggro deck on day 1. It has nothing to do with the 'synergies' of lens + tip the scales + nomi and zephyr. The fact that you've won every game so far without milling supports this as you've essentially played with at least 1 dead card (nomi) and arguably tip the scales + lens (since a big part of why you play them is to fatigue fast for nomi).
---
Yeah, that's not gonna happen, haha.
---
Even if your opponent had an uncontested board full of 8/8s, it'd still take 36 turns of that + fatigue to kill you. 
---
Safe to say you're *probably* gonna win if you get this combo off.
---
He also doesn‚Äôt take into account Anduin pings for lethal damage calculations. Such as having 5 mana left when played with an opponent on 8. Fireball is guaranteed lethal.
---
My very last pack was zeph. Praise üôèüèæüôèüèæ
---
It‚Äôs logic! Can‚Äôt be on two quests at the same time
---
Chill dude.
---
Only viable one from those is probably priest unfortunately
---
For the record, I did not think this of your post.
---
I might try something similar, this seems like a cool deck. I'm also thinking maybe 2x hench clan hags instead of the totem crunchers and some amalgams instead of the searing totems. I haven't found much use for those cards yet and a totem deck seems perfect.
---
I just disenchanted my Golden Nat Pagle and now I have mixed feelings about it...
---
septarchy maybe
---
just make the interns do it
---
gotta cube or rez malganis some how in this matchup
---
Quest Druid is lit
---
Damn i miss freez mage ;_;
---
Yes, I really want to craft it but I'm waiting to see the meta
---
Aggessive decks probably don't want inconsistent draws in their deck. And singleton decks surely are inconsistent as hell.
---
I crafted the quest druid since druid is my class ever since and it's fun
---
Better known as: large wubz
---
Another calculated and skillful bomb warrior play.
---
Double Battlecry Lackeys is super nutty. Omega value and easily the strongest deck right now.
---
King crimson ereased the arm
---
Rip
---
Watch someone copy their two [[Earthern Scales]] with [[Elise the Enlightened]] and get up to 5,000 armor.

It'd be *overkill*‚Äîsure‚Äîbut that's what this combo is all about.

5/5/5 | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, duplicate your hand.  
---
No wishing for more wishes
---
It‚Äôs literally just a reverse Devine shield?
---
If you‚Äôre any good at arena, I recommend playing there. You can often regenerate your coins, and if you manage to get to 7 wins you can get 150 gold and a new expansion pack guaranteed, essentially granting you a ‚Äúfree‚Äù pack. Plus, you‚Äôll get to play with a lit of the new cards as well. 
---
Ofc, arena is not for everyone, but it can be quite fun especially when a new expansion releases
---
How did they end up killing your Mal'Ganis?
---
You obviously don‚Äôt rural America.  Clearly you give the guns to the kids and 2-5 minute playtime is them killing the board.
---
But how can we get our regular STD fix?
---
random question, what device are you playing this on?
---
Looks like your wish is Zephrys' *suggestion*!
---
I believe its king kry
---
Don‚Äôt take our deckslots, Blizzard.
---
This is awesome. I'm guessing you ended up winning?
---
Warrior can play any archetype it wants as long as Dr boom is a card.
---
&gt; All commons
---
this would be more impressive than a "5 golden legendary" pack since it's impossible.
---
&gt;After Crystal Core is played, the base copies of your minions will now have 4/4 stats. The stat numbers will appear as white, instead of the green text indicating a buff.
---
So the minions are like regular 4/4's, which means you would expect any effects to work on them like they would work on any other 4/4.  And this extends to other stat-specific summon effects.
---
I don't see what wording you are referring to in the post that pertains to this interaction.  I will quote the full text that pertains to stat-setting effects:
---
&gt;Some interactions will change under this new functionality. Cards that create a copy of a minion with specifically stated stats (Sonya Shadowdancer, Prince Taldaram, Barnes, etc) will now work as written on the card text. For example, the minion summoned by Barnes will be a 1/1, instead of a 4/4.
---
My assumption would be that the minion enters play like a regular 1/1, "as written on the card text".  Then, any on-play effects happen, like [[Addled Grizzly]] or Amet.
---

---
3/2/2 Beast | After you summon a minion, give it +1/+1.  
---
‚ÄúYour battlecries trigger twice‚Äù. Super easy to complete, too, with sludge belcher and cable rat.
---
I highly recommend running skulking geist in your mill deck.
---
The most important difference is that, as far as we know, the card isn't random. We've seen sets being treated as a subpool before, it wouldn't be out of the question for it to be put in a discover card and we've seen discover effects outside your class, but by definition, they are always random. I think if it weren't for that, i would have argued it would have been a smarter design to just say "discover a wish" or something like that to avoid confusion.
---
The lack of randomness makes the card fundamentally different to discover and i think it is for that reason that it's smart to have worded it this way despite it confusing some players for the similarities between the mechanics.
---
What in powernation?
---
or a fatigue/ control deck.
---
I'm a simple man, I see Dr Boom getting Krushed, I upvote!
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a few years and just got my first 12 win arena run with zephyrs being a big part of it. Great card!
---
200 IQ plays, come and get yours!
---
Or google it? It is 2019 lol...
---
Or maybe fun of discovery?
---
This highlander mage is no joke
---
All hail
---
How many clicks on average did it take you to get all 3 boots, per boot?
---
Playing only wild, it is slightly amusing to see that in standard Warriors have a top tier deck.
---
From the glance, I thought this was gonna be Area 51 joke
---
Those were some strongly worded facts, my friend.
---
The main thing about highlander decks is whether or not the class in question has a good enough card pool to leverage the natural consistency issues of playing a deck without duplicates.  That's why they're usually at their best at the end of the standard years when the card pool is huge.
---
If the class has a good pool, then Zephrys alone is worth it. I mean he's at least as powerful as LoE Reno/Kazakus and can straight out win games out of nowhere if played at the right time. I think the Explorer cards are especially designed to cover for specific weaknesess to their own decks. 
---
Reno offers a valuable board clear for Mage, Brann offers Hunter an insane late game finisher, and Finely cheats insane hero powers for a class that has lower card quality in general and it's likely to rely on that button a lot.
---
They may not be viable now, especially with Bomb Warriors lurking around. But keep in mind these cards will remain in standard for a long time and are likely to grow stronger as new cards are added.
---
Do legendaries you've picked up from the "quests" factor into this 1 legendary per 10 pack equation?  I picked up a few just from, for example, getting all my classes to rank 10 in solo.  Thanks!
---
Nice
---
How did he cast 4 bees without killing the line cracker? It can only survive 2. Unless he healed it.
---
Hearthstone is the poster child for inconsistency
---
Tfw you get free warlock Quest, the other warlock legendary and sir finely which all require hugh amounts of legendaries or just suck. 
---
Exactly why I don't buy any pacs with money.
---
Get good
---
I love the card too but noted few things. It doesn't care about fatigue and won't propose anti-fatigue stuff and if played on empty board at 10 mana without potential lethal it'll almost always propose tyrion.
---
How do the Singleton decks deal with bombs getting shuffled into their deck?
---
Shout out Krieg!
---
still need? are you willing to go first if i show you my quest?
---
Or third, he can't trigger the golden effect!

Good luck if you haven't crafted it already.
---
Definitely not a bug. I pulled three of the same legendary in ~80 packs (with no other legendaries) in the last expansion before they changed it so you never got legendary dupes. When I contacted Blizzard customer support, they said I was just unlucky. 
---
It‚Äôs not a coincidence that must-craft class cards to support powerful deck archetypes are frequently Epic in rarity, either.

I got warrior and mage :/

You know how they call them Royal Crush over 'ere in Paris? They call 'em Quarter Pounder Krush over in america!
---
There are new cards here and there in the "old" decks.

questing is a pretty shit draw after quest is done

3/-/- | Discover a minion in your deck. If all 3 are Beasts, draw them all.  
---
It's not really a single card win condition, it is very at closing games, but by itself will not win games in decks otherwise having trouble doing so.
---
Time to ride this dino to Legend
---
Thank you brother.
---
So just poly the taunt?
---
And reborn never gets another card printed.
---
Anyone else thought Black Panther is stepping out of one of these portals?
---
Na he definitely had played Zephrys and got Earth Shock
---
I agree with all of this. In standard some decks get to over 30% winrate be ause the card pool is small. In wild, 20% is huge. As well, crafting decks is hella expensive for some people. If aggro is rampant I shouldn't be forced to craft a 15k dust warrior deck that sucks to play with
---
Well yes, they are all lethal but they are less direct then a fire ball would be
---
Also true.
---
lets go back in time to when pyroblast cost 8
---
If you double-click or hold (not sure) on the "1 pack-100 gold", it pops up a menu where you enter how many you want to buy at once.

---
I do not agree, Rafaam could be interesting for Zoolock.
---
What's the downside?
---
It COULD,but without the quest and tekhan it's meh
---
Yeah it will be a budget deck tho.
---
His deck recipes are already available in the deckbuilder. They are literally taken from there.
---
Found the aggro player.
---
What I truly don't get is why mage has gotten significantly buffed.. the new turtle minion gives you another large spell and the 10 drop pool got buffed by steroids. On top of the fact that pocket Galaxy is actually a fucking card in a class that cheats out big minions and multiplied them at their original cost is ridiculous. Mage will dominate the meta again
---
Boo fucking hoo, facts are hurting you. Grow up
---
I'm sure they'll reprint it instead, to get another huge amount of gold.
---
Yeah I noticed that it was changed back as well. I am unsure if it is a bug fix or just an accident both times. Could go either way!
---
I did it - Hagatha‚Äôs swamp creature with double battlecry does it if you don‚Äôt think about the spells you‚Äôre picking.
---
Apparently you and I are in the minority :/ Reminds me why I stopped playing.
---
I didn't really get that enough new cards for the classes I actually play from the gold I had. So there's that.
---
I spent 50 on the pre purchase and only got two legendaries.  Out of 58 packs. My fianc√© ‚Äúwho I also purchased the bundle for‚Äù pulled 7. She‚Äôs also pulled 5 Golden legendaries since we started playing last year and I‚Äôve pulled precisely zero. She‚Äôs never spent any money on the game and I‚Äôve probably spent 800$
---
TBH people are sleeping on this quest. 2 mana permanent savage roar, with Blackwald pixie + another savage roar? Insane. That's 7 mana 30 damage if you have 6 1.1s on board. 10 mana if you play unleash the hounds the same turn.
---
Wait till people start frosting your gloop
---
He's very toxic, wow!
---
Golden cards in Hearthstone is very underwhelming anyway, wish Blizzard would stop slacking. Animated cards in Gwent are amazing and something you want to collect.
---
You do know a 1/3 was run in the last rotation? Even Rogues ran it even though Beast tag isn't used? Now imagine a 1/3 with an upside?
---
same, and my free quest was unseal the vault. feelsbadman.
---
It does, what do you expect from not compatible OS with half of all steam games? ShitOS ¬Æ
---
I also feel like in this expansion, many of the fun decks require a lot of legendaries. More than usual
---
I just got Elektra Stormsurge as an arena reward yesterday as well! Was at 11 wins!
---
Your chances of having a specific 2-of card in muligan are 50% if you hard muligan for it. Trump did the math, and he concluded adding two Hyena Alphas to his highlander hunter was the right move because they are too good not to run two of, and 75% of the time highlander cards will be active by turn 7, which is when he wants to play them anyway.
---
That said, even then it is just one 2-of, and it is only worth it if the card you are running two of is THAT busted.
---
Why have it if you can not have it???
---
Minions, servants, soldiers of the lukewarm dark, obey the call of Kel'Thuzad.
---
Wait, they didn't fix it before release? What the hell Blizzard?

If you play for 30 wins, sure.

It's actually playable in a rogue deck.
---
siamat and zephrys are  for multiple classes atleast. Siamat especially is a good craft. I suggest running a questless Reno Mage which works fine for me
---
Well you‚Äôll need it on turn 10
---
No it‚Äôs not. Wait until you start running into Murloc shaman again.
---
Mine was the hunter quest -_-
---
I got the reborn quest lol. I was really disappointed then I tried building a deck and I am now actually having fun. Idk about havk the system but give it a shot, see what happens
---
Eyy same lol
---
Too bad my other 2 leggies were warrior and hunter quest 
---
At least Elise seems playable
---
In your deck if you look closely its half gold half regualr
---
I agree.
---
it's doing pretty well according to competitiveHS. the Lance is amazing.

sure man.

Think Baku rogue. But better with the invulnerability now
---
You understand that not everyone spends 130$ on preorders... Crafting stuff is risky when you have little resources and aren't sure yet if the stuff you want to craft is really as strong as you think it is. So a lot of f2p players wait for the meta to settle and keep playing their last decks
---
I didn't know Donald Trump played Hearthstone
---
I haven't ever encountered it being close to this bad.
---
That's when they play Mechathun and go Well Played.
---
Mostly play shaman here. 3x as many wins as my other classes.
---
Whizbang is my main.
---
The reward is still worst than the hero power of doctor boom mad genious, I think... I hope I'm wrong but meh
---
How high are you?
---
CC is one of the worst cards introduced this year, it's ruining the meta with bomb warrior.
---
You could say...he got Krushed
---
I have literally never heard anyone be called a goob before...I like it :P
---
Is there any card that removes opponents armor? Maybe there should be
---
(And no I don't mean just dealing damage)
---
On the Hearthstone official website they show in the collection every token next to each card that generates them.
---
I got 5 legendaries from the $50 USD preorder. Definitely got my money‚Äôs worth!
---
Yeah I'll probably try it out later... I would have loved to get the reborn quest btw, you're lucky trust me, it has a lot of potential
---
I shit on them with rogue! Turns out 3 damage per turn is way harder to deal with than just 1 damage per turn.
---
 [https://hearthstone-decks.net/quest-rogue-28-legend-j\_alexander\_hs/](https://hearthstone-decks.net/quest-rogue-28-legend-j_alexander_hs/)   
---
try out this deck, its super fun and the quest can be completed as early as turn 3, I've changed the questing adventurers for the new 1 cost rogue cat.  The quest is like the hunter 1/3 immune bow from last year combined with the 3/2 secret bow and you can use it each turn. Both of the mentioned weapons have seen a lot of use so this here is nuts! its massive tempo when you play your shit and deny most of what  opponent plays
---
I didn't spend a dime. Opened 64 packs and got 4 legendaries, one of which was Zephyr. Free quest was Shaman.
---
Just git gud.
---
calm your tits it hasn't even been 24 hours
---
Idefix will be happy.
---
Every card is playable *tap forehead*
---
and for all minion&amp;token summoning/adding to hand cards.  
---
and for "gain random effect" "unidentified" cards.  
---
and for dr. boom hero card.  
---
basically 1/4th of cards in hs have to be played over and over to find out all effects, or you need to consult a wiki, and devs in the past have stated that "it's more fun" to discover what they do when you play them (...)
---
To be more pedantic:
---
It's a linear damage increase, however overall damage taken is quadratic. :P
---
r/healsluts
---
5 Mana 8/8s are just strong in general, for aggro that is. Just take a look at cards like Fel Reaver, they do have their good spot in some metas. Combining it with silence is nonsense though, but hey that's reddit for you :)

My deck looks like a wallet warrior deck of old. Just a list of legendaries for everything choosing more than 6 mana
---
Unless you, somehow, trigger his battlecry twice üòé

"Oh, my, I see you're Unkindled.
---
For a pilgrim such as I, all tucked in and awaiting death, to have this honour.
---
This presages a most glorious death indeed.
---
Praise thee, praise thee."
---
Mind posting a deck list? I also got the pally quest (and warrior one).
---
Should get another within 10 packs. First 10 give a confirmed legendary and then pity timer of 40.
---
So even if the perfect card is a shadowstep for your heistbaron he won‚Äôt offer it? Lame
---
Not everyone (a) buys the expansion and (b) wants to use untested decks the first day.  This is really the best time to climb with a proven deck.
---
dev opinion &gt; community feedback , they stated that it's more fun to have to play cards to find out what they do. as if wikias didnt exist.
---
Climbed from 10-6 with this deck, then 6 to 5 with a super greedy shaman.

Somehow I got 5 legendaries in 47 packs. Did Blizzard up the rate or did I get uncommonly lucky?

Lackey/Self-Dmg Lock is pretty stronk, weakness is heals and clears early on tho

Oh my bad. It's possible on 2 if you drop a coined Juggler on 1.

FeelsBadMan
---
You got infinte value and a cheaty minion for Big Shaman or Duel Paladin. Not bad actually :)
---
Yeah, I did it yesterday with \[\[Rain of Toads\]\] and \[\[Lightning Storm\]\]. And then I did it again when Shudderwock recast the battlecry twice
---
You could consider having the 5 Mana lurker that copies another minions.
---
I have been using the gold Griftah in quest shaman just to make myself feel better
---
So... what was it, OP? I'm guessing you won. In 20-ish turns the Priest should die to his own fatigue, unless he's got the ultimate tech card: Violet Illusionist.
---
what's the driving logic of this point? that because the new decks are expensive that playing the same older deck where you already had all the cards costed a similar amount to keep playing? we don't rent cards expansion to expansion...
---
Or maybe he can't afford new cards? I dunno

Same here with one slot open (EU).

I'm just curious. I already have Stalladris, so I might as well experiment with it. I think he could be beneficial just to play out on turn 3, and then afterwards he can still provide value.
---
but achievable in even rogue... hm...
---
i feel ya: I had saved up for 46 packs in gold and only pulled 1 legendary from it and it was the dumb reborn 10 drop

3/2/2 | After a friendly minion dies, add a 1/1 copy of it to your hand. It costs (1).  
---
I got a golden Hack the System, and I know it‚Äôs going to be good *eventually* so I can‚Äôt dust it, but all the decks seem so expensive!
---
Interesting, I‚Äôm not low on dust either so I don‚Äôt mind crafting both, I do suggest all of us wait for the meta to settle before committing though
---
So is Stalladris any good? Or can I save that sweet 1600 dust
---
you can't have competition if you no longer play BOOM still Mr. 100
---
It's fun but right now it still feels like my deck comes up short late game and if I can't get it quicker than an aggro deck I tend to lose. It's only been 24h so need more games myself.
---
But I'm playing Control Taunt Warrior with a decent amount of new cards :(
---
That quest is actually decently good. Try it out!
---
You don't need Doll Master, im not running it right now and am doing fine.  
---
And, tbh, you don't get Betrug off that much anyway. Morrigan, Darkest Hours + Rafams schemes, and Augmented Elekks are the cards I would say are most important. Other than that, just lots of healing, taunt, and big minions.
---
He had to have it amputated after something in a jar bit his hand? Don't go putting your hand in random ass jars without checking first kids
---
100 fatigue damage is around 5k
---
200 fatigue damage is around 20k
---
300 fatigue damage is around 45k
---
1000 fatigue damage is around 500k
---
I believe 1140 fatigue damage is about how much you need. you can cut 1 or 2 if you can deal and extra 2k+ damage with minions.
---
i have encountered a whopping 0 paladins at rank 6 to 4 so far lol
---
Eh, I'm good, but thanks! I do have tons of dust, and got 6 Legendaries in total from packs, so that's alright. I just happen to have exceptionally bad luck with Mage, already did the last expansion. Most other new decks I just need 1-2 Legendaries, so I definitely get to play what I want.
---
Except Mage.
---
It's so bad in wild. I've faced 3 decks in about 4/5 hours of playing that have new cards in. I know it is the more stable format but this is bad.
---
Perhaps. Sorry you wasted your dust man. I did say that it was pretty unrefined. Most of the decks I fought were quest priest and some new mage decks people were trying. And they did pretty much idle for 3 turns haha.
---
*Cyclone* mage.  Not conjuror mage, there's more versions of that than just cyclone.
---
Reposting this wont make people agree with you
---
oof, guess blizzard fucked us hard this expansion. Why couldn't they just stick with one theme instead of like 6?
---
Didn't you just post this and everyone called you an idiot?
---
and plus 1 attack and without limited card choices 
---
noice!
---
&gt; they said I was just unlucky.
---
aka "get fucked lol"
---
it took reading this comment to even realise what the misspelling was lol.
---
NA rewtyman14#1369, 80g quest trade.
---
Haha I'd love it but I have no epic that is in the deck and I'm f2p. 1200 dust is all I have
---
Out of the 23 from this set, I got 19. That includes the ones that I got for pre-order. It isn't like I got everything else either. There were some epics I didn't get too.
---
the cheapest new decks out of this set still require at least 1 new legendary and several epics 
---
i usually try a bunch of packs each expac, but the 6th midrange hunter I've faced in a row is telling me that some of the classes are completely inaccessible right now for f2p players who didnt' pull well.
---
saying that f2p players should just resign to playing zoo decks is like telling homeless people to resign to living under bridges
---
Wow armor destruction needs to be on a card

Feel incredibly lucky. 100 packs, 80 preorder, 4 free packs, 16 from gold. Unpacked 11 legendaries total, all coming in first 83 packs. I‚Äôve never gotten so lucky with expansion preorder, only 3 legendaries from RoS bundle.
---
I like that people play old decks. It's a good metric for whether your new deck is "good enough" and you also know what the opponent has so you can play the match, at least on your side, knowing what you need to play around.
---
As far as control warrior specifically, I only get salty when they roll tank up repeatedly.
---
They‚Äôre out now build your own don‚Äôt be a bet decker have fun
---
you "discover a pick a mystery choice" according to the text.
---
30 packs for a Druid Quest and a Shaman quest. 4 epics with that. Fucking yikes.
---
Oof, I feel you there. Happy deck building man!
---
I opened 11 legendaries in the pre order which was ridiculous... I then usually spend all my gold (9000) every expansion, however I bought 30 packs first and got 3 more legendaries.  14 total in \~165 packs or so.  Then I got the free quest and two pre order goldens = 17.   
---
I've never had this much luck opening, so I actually am going to save 6000 gold for the first time ever and use that for next expansion if my luck turns out to be worse. 
---
This definitely makes up for my shitty RoS opening where I hit the 40 pack timer TWICE.
---
I feel you. I understand netdecking in Ranked, but in Casual I was really hoping to run into other people who threw together a deck around their free quest. Thanks for trying to pull me into a 30-minute game with no new cards, Mr. Control Warrior, but that's not really what I'm going for on launch day.
---
Because files get corrupt and resigning in checks the server for what you are authorized for
---
Shaman Quest, and im the one who wanted warlock quest. Proceeded to open two other quests rogue and paladin :'( :'(
---
How's King Phaoris in that deck?
---
somehow? You can certainly run the game on SE, 6S and 6 right now. Probably 5S and 5 as well. You'll need to have gotten one with more than the base storage cause on 16gb one you'll need most for the iOS and 5ish for hearthstone, which means for sure you'll have hard time updating or having anything else on that phone.
---
Also Tunnel Trogg.
---
I happened to have a lot of the quest Druid cards already, loti usually boils down to 4 mana destroy a minion, and stellandris is nice, but not essential. The two new oasis cards, and Cenarius have been more important for me so far.
---
I‚Äôm an f2p player who came back after two months. I only had enough gold to buy 15 packs and had more luck opening packs than I had ever gotten in previous expansions.
---
I opened 3 legendaries 
---
1. Paladin quest on the very first pack
---
2. Golden Siamat on 14th pack
---
3. The lackey synergy prophet warlock legendary on the 15th pack
---
I also got a rogue quest as my guaranteed legendary.
---
Thank you Hearthstone for making my day :)
---
I posted it again because there was a typo.
---
&gt;Feels like a bug, contact blizz?
---
Feels more like something quite ethical and quite fun and enjoyable.
---
LOL ok. Still silly though.
---
It'll probably be really hard to make a Priest deck that's tier 1 considering all the broken things the really good decks tend to do but maybe a low tier 2, high tier 3 is possible.
---
Currently I'm running Quest Priest with a Psychopomp Mass Rez Wall package that's decent and fun. Between your usual early game of draw-heal-go, the absolute MVP vs Aggro Penance (it's basically Dark Bomb for Priest but has lifesteal instead of being able to go face), the big butts on your minions and things like Divine Hymn, you complete the Quest relatively consistently while just doing what you'd be doing anyways in a typical Wall Priest style deck. Psychopomp and Penance is what the deck needed vs Aggro and the Quest reward helps turn your taunts into Midrange threats vs other decks, though you're probably not consistently beating things like Control Warrior.
---
This is the list I'm using but it's far from optimized.

---
Yeah, I haven‚Äôt updated my phone in a while, and it only lasts about 30 minutes on battery while playing
---
Damn give your totems 2+/2+ for 0 mana!! as rouge?! Insane broken op you‚Äôre so lucky!
---
well i guess paladins will still be viable although it will be otk pally or mech pally with SoU cards
---
don't know if murloc pally works, might check it out later
---
I've been trying them out in some aggro mech decks. There's a fun Priest variant floating around. I think whether Mortuary Machine will be good enough will depend on the meta though. There may be too many decks that get too much value from it for it to be useful. And at 5-mana, it's definitely not an auto-include in aggro decks. But it's still interesting.
---
Same dude,  tried making it work but its just kinda boring to play,  Summoning a bunch of 4/3s is not that exciting.
---
Stellandris is better in the lucentbark variant, to give more healing options, otherwise it‚Äôs only okay in my experience
---
Yes exactly but even against agro decks I feel the deck kind of lacks in the early game. But the mid game is good.
---
^this; all the guys that summon treants act as included savage roars that have been buffing my boards to lethal
---
I received this as my free legendary and have been having fun in play mode with a bomb deck I threw together. 20 minions is a lot but when you finish it most of the time you have 10+ damage on the board.
---
From my usage so far, siamat is a powercard just like ziliax and gains flexibility for losing some efficiency on it.
---
EZ win
---
I've been playing wild highlander mage almost exclusively... so many janky things can happen with that deck.
---
got the shaman quest. Which is nice... buuuuut I don't have either hagathas or shudderwhock
---
Doooon't think that joke even works here, because regardless of Blizzard's resources, they can't just make data appear
---
A lot of big priest decks already drop barnes to avoid pulling him from shadow essence, this would change the deck slightly but it wouldn't hurt it in the long run
---
Because it wasnt paying of before hahajaha
---
yeah, they tend to do that at that age. Luckily, you can usually change the battery for fairly cheap(compared to getting a new phone that is :D). Alternatively, I just keep a cable and a power bank one me when I really don't want to invest in a new battery or device right now.
---
This is the list I'm using right now. It's a lot of fun, is really good against Aggro decks and Druid but you probably don't win against Control Warrior. I haven't seen one yet though. The list isn't optimized by any means but with your habit of doing draw-heal-go, high hp minions and cards like Penance and Sandhoof, the Quest gets completed at a reasonable pace while you're still doing the same sorts of things that you'd be doing as Wall Priest anyways.
---
On the bright side, your pity timer will pop in 4 packs so there's still a chance you'll get something you'll like. 
---
Best suggestion (as a fellow Colossus owner): big Shaman is fun, and supposedly Paladin can make it work as well
---
I can guarantee that zoo won‚Äôt contain any new epics, and the legendary would be optional. Unless the 3/3 summon a 5/5 is epic, then yeah - that is probably a 2 of. 
---
Midrange Hunter is still cheap as chips, no idea what you‚Äôre on about in there. Only legendary absolutely required would be Zilliax, which literally every F2P player is told to craft as the first thing. The 4 mana 3/3 summon 2 2/2‚Äôs is outstanding for the deck, pretty much integrates around the existing setup. That deck is a horrific example, as all the cards are so cheap. You might not get to play the flashy new legendary, but hunters epics were crap, and the legendary was for Reno decks anyway, not midrange. 
---
Well saying that f2players should have the same range of options as a pay for packs player is like saying to the homeless man that he can not contribute to society at all and still live with all the benefits of anyone who is doing so. Utterly ridiculous analogy.
---
Yes. I have seen at least 2 other posts about it...
---
[[Lab Recruiter]].
---
But if u play it every turn and the Druid is out of cards then u go face and take no fatigue damage and one day the Druid will die
---
Did someone said Naxx Out ?
---
Zephrys on an empty board on turn 2 will always give you Brightwing. Guess which Legendary he will give your opponent 50% of the time.
---
I guess Blizz wants you to try new things.
---
Yep, I‚Äôve got my phone plugged all day pretty much.
---
My very first one too I was so mad I HATE when it‚Äôs the first card you get no hype lmao
---
Save them in hearthstone deck tracker

2/3/2 | Battlecry: Shuffle 3 copies of a friendly minion into your deck.  
---
I like that your response so his life‚Äôs unfortunate situation was ‚Äújust play moar‚Äù
---
My free quest was Activate the Obelisk, so I opened hack the system in the first ten packs.
---
They just had to put in a 10-mana Taunt, which zero people will put in their deck but will make aggro decks obsolete before our Conjurer's Calling overlords. It's salt in the wound.

2/2/3 Murloc | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, Discover an upgraded Hero Power.  
---
I cut it entirely in favor of si: 7 agents for more reliable tempo early on. I'm on a 7 win streak albeit from like rank 18 because I didnt have much time to play last month
---
Subbed, if you lose, craft golden puzzle boxes.
---
Me too, although I haven't personally played with the Druid quest.
---
Looks like highlander with Zephyrs is pretty strong. Just have to see if it holds.
---
Dr Boom is OP because it makes mech totally overpowered. The overall mech package is too strong so any class with a decent class-specific mech can abuse of it. Zilliax being in half of all deck is a great exemple ....
---
Nerf Zilliax, Explomatic and Omega devastator. Also adding Tchic-tchac to the game was an incredible non-sens. We needed a mech nerf, not a buff ....
---
Eh... when OG Reno first dropped he was played solely for his effect well before MSOG came out
---
Yeah I know. Problem with poison seeds is, it destroys the minions so they go into the rez pool and the seed are just "one" specific minion. 
---
I just love Elise's flavour and want to play with her but... 
---
Thankfully Shudderwock Shaman crushes Big Priest with the new Plague of Murlocs :)
---
nothing to fix there mate, all about luck same with any card game or virtual case opening. Maybe the larger pre-order could of gotten an extra golden but unfortunately you just had bad luck. 
---
maybe be happy that you‚Äôre in the position to be able to buy the expansion packs unlike some.
---
i bought 50 and got 3 (+golden+free) but i wouldn‚Äôt of complained if i got any less.
---
&gt;Sure you have bounces but to get them really big you need multiple copies from stuff
---
By the way, communication is actually impossible without making assumptions about what others think. I read the sentence properly and offered a card that may or may not have been the one. Now, for some ungodly reason, you're berating me for trying to offer you some help. Nice one, man
---
Hey jobriq, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
Can u give me the list cause I also dont have any of the legendaries
---
This game is so ridiculously expensive and it's only gotten worse with increasing prices of preorders. I rarely preorder expansions anymore but I decided to this time because I liked the set, that + my gold I spent on I ended up with about 100 packs, roughly $100 worth or so. Even then that barely let me scrape by and craft two decks, it's ridiculous.
---
At the time of posting, it definitely was half. I have it on HDT. Got better since, though.
---
Are they? Tommorrow is Activisions earning call and we‚Äòll find out
---
I have like 7 or so different cards from the whizzbang quest and its been going pretty well won 8 out of 10 games only lost once to battle cry quest shaman that just kept healing and had the quest done at turn 4. And once to a warrior that just spammed his board full super quick when I had no answers
---
I had a good run, 96 packs from gold and ore order. 
---
6 legendaries + free one
---
22 epics
---
7 gold common
---
6 gold rare
---
2 gold epics
---
Seriously I‚Äôm having a much better winrste on my mogu cultist gimmick than my actual trying quest warrior.
---
Well that‚Äôs just lame isn‚Äôt it
---
Even so, they sometimes just entirely ignore the legendaries you put into your deck. Whenever I tried to autocomplete a hi'reek deck it gives me no handbuff zoo for example.
---
Interesting
---
oOoOh MY LE KARMA SLIBBED AWAY
---
Oh stop being so pretentious. Of course if someone plays well they should have pride. Taking this way too seriously.
---
You can't force everyone to play your way. Quit whining. Blame blizzard if anything for making the game so expensive that people can't afford to experiment with lots of cards.
---
This post is a jojo refence.
---
Didn‚Äôt say that at all, you‚Äôre just attacking a straw man because you don‚Äôt feel like having a conversation with another human being and having your opinions challenged.
---
Sketchy wild
---
You just need to craft Whizbang to unlock it.
---
For one, have a cool effect.
---
For two, give certain archetypes support while not being so overbearing as to become a must-craft for a large amount of archetypes.
---
If the effect's power is subtle, but noticeable, sure. If it's boring/bad, ignoring it is an option. If it's too powerful, powerful enough to become a must-craft, I ain't exactly stoked about it.
---
From rank 5 onwards it's 40 dust. You can get to r5 with anything halfway coherent.
---
But, my point being that the introduction of quests means that F2Ps are more limited in the classes they can play (or at the very least try out on ladder). Much like with DKs. I mean if you didn't get Rexxar, Jaina and Guldan no way were you playing Hunter, Mage or Warlock on ladder.    
---
With the last set, you could play a whole host of classes as F2P except maybe Warrior. Now that something as powerful as quests are back you're much more limited. Myself for example I ended up with 2 quests, Rogue and Mage. Am I going to make a deck with most of the druid cards I got without the quest? Nope, because they've been designed with quest in mind.   
---
That's the point I'm making. Not that it's impossible to play without getting quests, but you're much more limited in what you can experiment with knowing full well that you're going up against the better deck if someone has the quest and you don't.   
---
Most likely I'll wait, and probably craft one other legendary quest, as I want to spend some on Zephyr who looks a solid choice and resign myself to using maximum 3 classes.
---
At that point, damage to win the game. Every time I've had to use him, I've been able to get Fireball for lethal. It's a very agressive deck, which means this time of experimentation is the best time for it.
---
I see what your saying but is zephyrus really that much of an issue for deckbuilding? I understand it's preferable to have in Highlander but so are other cards for others. Genn &amp; Baku from my understanding literally broke the game. To a point everyone could only play those 2 decks. Zephrus merely gives Highlanders a chance to catch up from variance from inconsistent cards and almost 50% less chance to topdeck the card you need. While the effects of the "wished" card typically only affects that turn or the turn after. 
---
In my opinion, they needed to give Highlanders viable support to have ANY chance to thrive in the current meta and it appears they made strong efforts to create completely new deck archetypes and gave incentive to craft Highlanders and dilute the meta with different classes/game styles. (As well as make blizzard more money but that's always the case)
---
Highlanders still really don't stand a chance against two of the top decks conjurer's mage and taunt or control warrior. Those two are actually broken and it is seen by how prominent both of them are in this expansion with their newfound tools. I think other classes should have gotten more support for already existing archetypes rather than these 2. While it does look like they tried to build new mage/warrior archetypes. Players have found ways to strengthen the already meta defining decks and that's fucking annoying. I for the love of God cannot run my quest rogue, quest druid, quest shaman, or lackeylock deck without dear of running into those 2.
---
Welcome. :)
---
Backstab
---
Yeah, I had to craft Stalladris and nourish (never unpacked new ones after the nerf). I don‚Äôt have Loti or the Epic that gets reduced to 0 mana, but I‚Äôm on rank 4 right now.
---
Priest quest is meh, by the time you get it a +3+3 is sure good but *meh*. I didn't mention warlock because, well, everyone expected it to be bad.
---
No, if you look at it in game, you can just make out a couple of fingers moving up and down. The arm isn‚Äôt there.
---
I just can‚Äôt afford to spend anymore money on this game. The cost is astronomical.
---
The few free packs I got and from the arena run I did, I didn‚Äôt get anything good.
---
I got the reborn quest which is literally impossible to complete before you have a bunch of reborn cards. Essentially a dead legendary.
---
I think you just have to not turbo it, that way can stabilize early wity normal turns and then take over later when you complete it
---
I remember when Overwatch changed their loot boxes to no longer give as many duplicates, I really wish something similar would happen. I had 700 dust of all common duplicates after opening my packs, it‚Äôs really given me a bad taste.
---
True, but then you see someone else that opened 83 packs that got 11 legends.   Puts a sour taste in your mouth when you preorder the big bundle and dont get that much.
---
As I understand you, tl;dr of your argument is "Zephrys is way too strong in singleton decks, making it a must-craft if you want somewhat competitive singleton deck".   
---
If that's the case, your argument only makes sense if singleton decks are absolutely dominant T0 decks, in which case we have bigger design problems than ones highlighted by you.   
---
If they aren't T0, and are capable of competing with other T1-2 decks without Zephrys, it's not a must-craft, so your objection is null.   
---
If they aren't capable of competing with other T1-2 decks without Zephrys, but are with him, not printing him wouldn't help your problem, quite the contrary: you wouldn't be able to make competetive singleton deck at all.  
---
If they aren't capable of competing with other T1-2 decks at all, the whole discussion is obsolete.
---
He doesn't deserve that nickname
---
Stalladris can be used in token, heal Druid, and many custom archetypes. Probably a safe craft if you enjoy playing Druid like I do.
---
The Boom's Lab Puzzle, Full Northshire (the final lethal puzzle) requires you to kill Dr. Boom from 999 HP, starting with 1 Northshire and 1 Sylvanis for you, and 1 Northshire for Boom. 
---
There's a whole bunch of cards involved that don't exist in the normal game, that let you kill him by giving him Northshires and healing them 3 or 4 times.
---
OG Patron Warrior was pretty widely regarded as being a very skill intensive, math heavy deck.
---
Besides that though I think you're right.
---
Come on, buddy... I said awaken. Please don't do this to me now... :'c
---
I don't know how it happened, but I opened up 80 packs ( 7 legendaries!) then spent all my time playing Hooktusk Rogue with 2 new cards in it.
---
Sorry. :(
---
Played against someone who was trying to make that work yesterday. I was playing the Zayle Warlock deck (Plot twist deck basically, no quest though), so not an OP meta deck by any means.
---
It got a bit dicey towards the midgame, I was starting to stabilise but really had to keep his board clear to stop him from giving everything +2 attack and killing me. But it wasn't too hard and eventually he ran out of stuff.
---
I'm almost positive that if they removed all the stuff they put in for the quest and never changed their hero power I would have died to the resulting aggro/midrange hunter pretty quickly.  
---
In fact if he didn't get the new hero power and could have just hit me in the face for 2 a turn instead they might have won.
---
Big Priest, pre-nerf Quest Rogue &amp; Jade Druid were also weak to aggro. Still needed to be nerfed.
---
Nice deck, mind if I borrow it.
---
I got literally the same two cards first time I played it. Second time I got two copies of Demonbolt.
---
Bah, but I don‚Äôt like him, he is ugly
---
Waiting for someone to calculate the animation times and the probability of this happening lol.
---
So if thats the case then amet should work with vivid nightmare :(
---
Consistency in Hearthstone is hard...
---
When I saw that this was my quest, I was somewhat relieved because I already have a lot of Warrior cards due to me playing Bomb Warrior during RoS. Then, I realized Hack the System is really shit compared to a lot of other decks.
---
They can't be too strong though because of Wild. The new Reno is super underrated and already super broken in Wild thanks to how strong old Reno and Kazakus are.
---
Just play Mech Hunter
---
Just funny how butt hurt people get about a video game. No he doesn't.
---
I'm not trying to force anyone. I'm putting them in their place. They're playing easy mode, is all.
---
I bought the $50 bundle, opened 120 packs between the $50 and dust/brawl packs. I pulled 10 legendaries from 120. A lot of people I know got like, 13-14 in about the same amount of packs, but my best friend got 5 in 90 so it's totally a toss up
---
It was always played as a highroll card though, and wasn't oppressive in the meta. Also he was always bad if you didn't have control of the board... opponents would just laugh and go face again until you died.
---
What really made Reno shine (and why I loved playing him to the point that I never stopped rocking his flair even after he rotated) was how it utterly shit on facehunter.
---
I had the misfortune of getting it as my free quest and I had the same experience as you. I thought the combo of locusts+cybertech chip would be enough to make it work but no, it doesn't.
---
I wonder how many warriors downvoted you LOL
---
I completely agree. Add in the fact blizzard created a warrior mech that copies itself for two mechs that have rush.. litrafuckingly retarded.
---
This expansion is already boring. Haven't faced many Highlanders let alone new archetypes and only see jacked up steroid fed mages and warriors
---
Cards for money are really expensive, but you get a decent amount for playing. Just need to actually use the disenchant system properly.
---
But yeah, Pally quest sucks.
---
an element of jealousy of course, but nothing should/could be done. the packs are weighted fairly and a guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs is more than most games ensure.
---
Vanish was HoF'd because it was (along with Prep) one of the most cancerous cards ever printed
---
Why did they print this worthless card
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a matter of matchup. Just interesting to consider, a lot of control players hate shudderwock shaman just as much as you hate big priest because they autolose. People just hate losing try to put the blame on anything but themselves. You‚Äôre gonna have some bad matchups, but your mentality when queing up should be to play a deck that has more favorables than unfavorables. That way who even cares about the occasional priest when you win the other matchups? You can‚Äôt expect to win every matchup though.     
---
Even if shudderwock steamrolls priest, how good is it versus the other decks? Is its winrate across the board good enough? Just things to consider. Swapping to a counter deck when you get angry at a specific deck might feel good but make sure it‚Äôs actually good on paper too üëå
---
Fair. Ive had a couple of 10/10 and 8/8s stick for 1 turn minimum.
---
[deleted]
---
131 packs. 11 legendaries (including 2 preorder and free quest), got Druid, mage, Hunter, Warlock and Priest quests, Siamat, Vessina (golden), Reno Relicologist, Tekahn, Colossus of the Moon (golden) and Phaoris (golden).
---
What app / program are you using on your mobile device to track the deck / card history?
---
Same, it‚Äôs surprisingly satisfying
---
47 packs, 9 epics (6 of the same card) and 2 legendary cards, same for me xD
---
I wanted to try out the new cards in wild but everyone is just using the same old decks. And this combo is bs
---
The flavor text.
---
[[Glass Knight]]
---
I actually cut hero Hagatha for the quest in my Shaman deck, and I don‚Äôt have Swamp Queen yet, but Shudderwock is preeeetty core to it.
---
I‚Äôm doing a Mutate-based variant with Former Champ, Giggling Inventors, etc. Before the expansion I had Thunderhead to beat rogue and a bunch of low spells for Spirit of the Frog, but I cut the Thunderhead for this meta and I‚Äôm thinking of replacing Frog and some of the less impressive spells for more cards like Novice Engineer. I have Jepetto but he‚Äôs *very* hit or miss. Never manage to get him out against aggro and my hand tends to be too full to use him in control matchups. 
---
Shaman Quest works really well with a lot of legendaries (Barista Lynchen is amazing, Kragwa is sometimes great value) but in theory you could slam in a bunch of less expensive battlecries and try to go for more of a tempo deck with it?
---
I‚Äôm more of a Mech Hunter/Paly type of guy unfortunately. Only reason I‚Äôm testing out Quest is because 1) I got the quest for free 2) Druid seems to be receiving quite a bit of support
---
I definitely don‚Äôt mind crafting him though, but for the purposes of this deck I‚Äôm might stick with Loti. Might switch to Druid considering how viable it‚Äôs predicted to be tho
---
By the downvotes it seems a majority of people here d not agree with your overall statement. Sure Dr. Boom and Control Warrior are still cancer, but the expansion appears to not be overrated.
---
&gt; with each expansion it's a little harder to come back
---
Wild is the easier/cheaper format now.  You build a top-tier deck in wild and then it remains really strong, needing 0-2 new cards per expansion.
---
Was that comment meant for me? Because that doesn't relate at all.
---
it needs 7 combo cards. It will have like tier 5 win rate. People who want to nerf everything are retarded
---
You say this like that is enough packs to make these new "exciting" decks.  You people need to realize that this game is at a fraction of it's popularity these days and most people you are playing on ladder only do quests or play one or 2 games a week.  They just want play whatever deck is in their list on their phones.

Nah gold is for arena

I honestly can't believe that Blizzard still never nerved Carnivorous Cube. That thing should be at least 8 mana for what it does.
---
I can't afford a bunch of new cards, and I'm getting destroyed by insane value due to power creep
---
All i can see is it whould be a perfect defile.
---
I feel personally attacked by this post
---
Christ imagine actually trying to play around that. You play one spell and all mage minions get +2 HP, your minion gets destroyed and the spell gets countered/bender'd. y i k e s
---
8 Mana? That means you could cast frostbolt on the same turn.  With spell damage +1, you could do like 11+4=? damage... ü§îü§îü§î
---
Hellfire/frost blot
---
You spelt Preperation 4 different ways in that single post üëå
---
He basically was able to stick a board I couldn't clear and dropped Leeroy and hero powered for lethal.
---
My extra copies of conjures calling are burning a hole in my collection. Please don‚Äôt wait until the inevitable midway xpac balance change to nerf, Blizz
---
I've encountered some fun stuff lately, guess I am lucky then.
---
the value on these warriors is just insane, my old decks don't stand a chance and it's really lame to go against
---
Add a jade idol to the mix an if your opponent doesn't run Geist it's a one sided beating.
---
Source: Tested that deck but included the new quest and one jade idol.
---
Because the hive-mind of the internet is about a million times better at making decks than I am.
---
It uses Edwins base stats of 2/2
---
There‚Äôs a whole list somewhere of where and when buffs carry over. Off the top of my head anything that goes from Board ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&gt; Deck loses buffs unless otherwise stated (Immortal Prelate).
---
Are you one of the big brains that can go infinite arena :o
---
I made a few tweaks, but I like it. Dude got me down to 1 health and was BMing all over the place. Drew the last BEEEES and [did him dirty](https://imgur.com/gallery/iktS3MA). He took a few turns whacking at me, but then I think he realized how long it would have taken.
---
This is a fun game, but I give up.
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get it right this time!‚Äù
---
Brawl&gt;Warpath&gt;Warpath
---
Plague of Murlocs
---
Plague of Death OR Mass Dispel&gt;Mass Hysteria
---
Probably a couple others I haven't thought of, but a few classes have answers. Too bad some classes literally can't answer this at all.
---
Eh, he'll probably see play because he's still a versatile neutral legendary, but he's not even vaguely Zilliax.
---
Highlander Hunter is no joke, cruised from 8 -&gt; 5 with like three losses, many against old tryhard decks like Bomb Warrior and Conj Mage. It's insane.
---
Not a fan of this brawl due to how difficult it is for people that didn't spend $50+. That said, I actually have the dust to craft whatever i want. Not sure what though..
---
Same ... I would complain but I got super lucky with the rest of my pulls
---
When a copy is made directly onto the board, it keeps the enchantments/health. But when put directly into your hand or deck, then they are reset to their base stats (unless the cards say exact copy or give the copy x)
---
True that would suck ass.. I've played mech paladin and it got me high from 30 down to like 12. Just started ROS so don't think I'm a uber noob lol I'm on rank 7 still but can't get past the wall of warriors and mages. Mech paladin was my best shot at beating warrior last meta and I usually won. Just wondering if I should go the next step with that. Is craft the quest as well.
---
I think it will be more comparable to Lich King.  
---
That found its way into a *lot* of decks, but wasn't as ubiquitous as Zilliax.
---
Then there'd be no counterplay while also denying players a certain amount of risk taking.
---
I've been feeding on Quest druid with Highlander Hunter. I played mech hunter to finish a quest and just demolished them too. I think it'll fade over time. Any somewhat aggressive deck with staying power just rolls over them.
---
Yes i set up a savage roar/bloodlust most of the time with my highlanderhutner deck.
---
That's why wild mode is a huge trash can.
---
Try Mech Reborn Quest Paladin, good against Warrior.
---
Majority of people who are running old decks are the people who can't afford new cards.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. The +1/+1 stats over something like Loot Hoarder just can't be worth being an atrocious topdeck late in quest decks that are usually relatively slow.
---
Ahhhh I was fortunate enough not to see Leeroy in the game I played
---
Okok, this make sense. Thank you!
---
Copy effect keep buffs only on board, unless it specificly states on them that they keep all buffs in hand/deck such as paladins imortal prelate.
---
Well, Zephrys is a contender for one of the best cards ever (if you're playing Singleton), so that's a pretty damn safe bet.
---
Im absolutely loving Quest Druid, first deck I made and dumped most of my dust into. My favorite class is Druid and favorite deck was a midrange/control ramp druid so this fits that style very nicely.
---
Which will still be a deck? Murloc pally or control warrior
---
I'll wait a little longer, since I'm sure someone will eventually get it.
---
But yeah, I don't want people to get too frustrated if they can't find it.
---
I'll message you the solution if you'd like to verify.
---
Zephyr is a safe craft for wild
---
Druid quest looks scary strong to be honest
---
Yeah I actually just replaced the menacing nimbus with amalgam. Plays better having it.
---
Alextraza.
---
The problem is, zephyrs doesnt know you will have another extra turn.
---
There should'nt be any counterplay to cards that require special deck building
---
Control warrior. Murloc paladin wasn't really a deck before.
---
What‚Äôs your wild list if you don‚Äôt mind me asking
---
I could be forgetting or missing something, but typically, copy effects are retained when moving "forward" and removed when moving "backward."
---
Forward would be from deck, to hand, to hand while backward would from board to hand, hand to deck, or board to deck.
---
Control decks being negative means that they're either not packing enough clears or the strong decks in the meta are the ones that outvalue control. If aggro was the surging force in the meta, control would have a field day.
---
Yup, it can bee seen, fellow Komrade
---
Zephyrs is horrible in wild, and the worse craft you can do right now.
---
The fact that both cards still see play seems to suggest the nerfs were fine no?
---
Played against a few Quest Priests and it seemed like a bit of a shambles.   
---
All that healing doesn't really do anything except waste cards and let me build up my board.
---
It's also usually worth putting in more than one card to help the algorithm. Try adding some reborn minions yourself and it may do a better job of completing the deck. It's possible that a constructed mech deck that happens to include the quest is still just better than a quest deck that actually works.
---
Are you thinking about mind blast?
---
Naturalize would be my guess.  I think I‚Äôve seen this deck run it.
---
Can you wish for more genies?
---
Seems pretty strong to me, though you can get draw screwed and complete the quest way too late. If you can complete the quest and stabilize you will usually win in my experience, aggro decks will run out of steam and control decks can't win when you shuffle a bunch of Tess in your deck or they just crumble to the constant pressure. Only problems are the aforementioned draw screw, some aggro openers being too fast to deal with, and any time the enemy drops a huge board out of nowhere, because RIP Vanish.
---
His fault for not playing odd pally and getting turn 7 lethal /s
---
What part of "Of fucking course it is" indicates surprise, they've been pulling this shit after each expansion for a while now.
---
Murloc Shaman can be **severely** annoying. They fill the board with Scargill and an Underbelly Angler; my Bomb Warrior used Brawl to kill it.
---
They filled the board again (with an Angler created by Angler #1), so I used Warpath x4 to kill it off. They filled the board AGAIN (with another Angler), and I Warpathed it to death again.
---
**then they filled the board a 4th time.** and the fucka had a full 10 cards, so it milled away one of my Bombs, and maybe prevented me from getting lethal.
---
severely, **painfully** annoying
---
Yeah but Fel Reaver's penalty is nothing compared to Mortuary Machine's. A 5 mana 50/50 would be pretty nice too but not if it said "Battlecry: When you play this, lose the game."
---
For comparison, Fel Reaver was one of the highest rated Arena cards of all time. The Lightforge rates Mortuary Machine a 0. It might even be a negative score that's getting rounded up. You would be much better off passing your turn than playing Mortuary Machine.
---
Oh yea one Hundo percent. It will sit highly on it's pedastol until season ends or nerf hammer comes swinging justkxe down.
---
Murloc paladin will be tier 3. 2 at best. Just don't see how it conpetes with mage and warrior. I even beat one with burglar Rogue
---
Only fought a single warrior deck so far actually, and that was some aggro Enrage / While Damaged deck.
---
500-1000 games isn‚Äôt nearly enough to get a good idea of where these decks are at
---
Yep! Buffs are kept as long as they dont move backwards through deck-&gt;hand-&gt;board, except for the exceptions! (like immortal prelate, kingsbane,etc)
---
Everyone is playing shitty unrefined decks right now. Of course the already refined deck is gonna stomp them for now
---
Ding ding, we have a winner!
---
Yes, this is the take away from the situation - apparently Zephrys cannot recognize "Extra Turn" effects, even though it is publicly visible information to both players.
---
Sad to learn, but it's probably too niche to justify warping the code around.
---
Omg I love it!!! Lmaooo massive armor bee gone fool!
---
I've literally faced 3 decks with new cards in them :/
---
The only highlander card I pulled was Brann. Not sure if I‚Äôll craft Zephrys, depends how prominent the highlander decks get.
---
Use burn from hand to make sure he gives lethal, Zephrys doesn‚Äôt look at hand, only minions on board.
---
It's not that it "probably wont figure it out", it's that it isnt allowed to look at what the specific cards in either players hands are. It can only use public information - imagine if a third player walked up to the side of the board, any information that they can see, Zephrys can use.
---
That sucks I haven't played alot but faced some new reno versions, was funny wish u the same luck tho :)
---
for sure, I got a buncha dupes of the exact same cards
---
I agree about there being too few control tools. Mainly healing, which is so key against aggro. Make a mage deck and what healing options do you have? Probably ONLY Zilliax. And also most classes have no win condition right now as control. Warrior is pretty broken, but they are not the only reason that control decks are seeing no play.
---
I got one on NA around 9am this morning
---
I run the new quest and one jade idol. Imagining my opponents face when I summon bigger and bigger green men each turn is pure gold.
---
Also 0 fatigue.
---
Since Boomsday the biggest things would be the standard rotation (obviously) and every odd and even synergy card being hall of famed (i.e. Genn and Baku)
---

---
Quest rogue is actually nutz
---
Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
---
Haha man don't stress, anytime is cool!
---
The quest takes so long to activate!
---
Yeah, I'm just wishing to get this card for my collection but I can't since I don't have him to begin with.
---
Quest rogue only needs like 4 new cards, only one is a legendary.
---
is he classic now?
---
**SoU Plagues** - "Can I copy your homework?"
---
**Boomsday Projects** - "Yeah just change it up a bit so it doesn't look like you copied"
---
**Plagues** -
---
Only had one deck: Cyclone Mage 
---
Could only afford one legendary: Mage Quest
---
Good expansion so far I‚Äôd say
---
Well, if a battlecry triggers twice, it is still just one battlecry. Therefore Shudderwock only play it once
---
I had two packs today. First card on my second pack I was ecstatic as fuck!! Good luck pulling him man
---
Lmao fr
---
I will show you ~~fear~~ Siamat or Zephrys the Great
---
Yeah, and the deck doesn't contain enough value to beat out other value decks. So it's like the worst of both worlds.
---
dats perfectly Twisting Nether.
---
It depends on how much mana you have leftover. If it‚Äôs turn 10 and you play a 2 cost card, he‚Äôll give you a good 8 drop (Tirion). He wouldn‚Äôt do this on turn 2 for example though
---
You can call me daddy. I'll love you
---
Works with sea giant however
---
Nah, he's good for the rest of the "year".
---
Pillarity ensues.
---
Yeah lol I want to believe in zoolock with no duplicates
---
Playing Reno Mage in Wild. My opponent had procced my Ice Barrier, leaving me with 4 armor and a 4/4 in play that I needed to get rid of. 
---
With 4 mana to spare, I wished for Eviscerate. I got Shield Slam. I had the right idea!
---
Good news! Control warrior still works perfectly fine with no new cards. 
---
(minus when highlander mage decides to RNG you to death)
---
Prox#1726 NA. Trading 80g quest. I'll show, you go first.
---
Let's hope for better days my friend.
---
Guess I have to wish for more coins first, got a warrior quest for free and got armadillo for warrior as my guaranteed legendary.
---
Thinking back I actually have a lot of warrior legendaries, just got Dr boom hero card today. Too bad his decks are usually the most expensive...
---
Hehe! Pile on!
---
1/1 from barnes killed by hero power?
---
I get twilight drake a lot.
---
The only quest it‚Äôs possibly not **amazing** for is the Rogue quest, and that‚Äôs only because a turn 2 clever disguise is a good play *and* you can finish the quest really quickly.
---
I think I ended up finishing my quest on turn 3 in my last game and then played a Questing Adventurer on turn 4; I was confused for a bit when it didn‚Äôt draw a card,
---
miscreant nerf was fine, prep without making otehrs cheaper not at all.
---
Control warlock
---
a 4/6 body that destroys your own minion..
---
I think Questing Explorer is pretty safe. Essentially, if *any* quest works in a few weeks, that card sees play.
---
Why are you mad about this? The prizes are better than a regular tavern brawl.
---
People will start complaining about this in a few weeks. You can't realize card is broken when riding the hype train.
---
He had NO idea what you were capable of
---
yeah he had a duel in there too, pulled out the 9/9 rush minion vs my leg 2/3 choose one card copier
---

---
Got lucky with my 10 packs and I have a total of 3 quests so I‚Äôve been having fun using old expansions to make the quests work. Warrior quest seems ok with the old stuff.
---
I think MTG Arena does this too
---
Yes now delete this shitty post
---
Logged in on launch, played for the day. Today I cant be bothered anymore.
---
Doesn't reflect on the state of the meta or anything. Reflects on the state of "I spent wowgold on preorder decks and cant make a good enough deck to enjoy the game the way I want to.". Granted me wanting to do a control warlock deck is literally the worst idea in the sense of ranking when I'm not spending my rent money on packs.
---
I definitely lost to one of these the other day lol
---
I was hurt
---
I usually see Jaraxxus if I play Zephrys with spent mana on turn 8. He's pretty situational, though.
---
T u R n L i M i T
---
Reborn is a keyword.
---
Plague is a mechanic.
---
Do you understand card games at all?
---
Polymorph is better than silence, and more satisfying than destroy effects, I can see the appeal!
---
The key to this deck is token generation. I think you have to go one of two routes - beasts only to exploit Master's Call, or Mech-centric to exploit cards that have amazing synergy with the Quest such as Replicating Menace and Snip Snap.
---
Personally I've been going with Mechs, splashing Rat Trap and Snake Trap (great for quest), so that I can play Hyena Alpha. Haven't decided yet if the 7 Locust card is worth running because I've completed the quest pretty reasonably without playing it.
---
You want minions that leave behind tokens when they die. Replicating Menace, Savannah Highmane, Snip Snap.
---
Body Wrapper / Baleful Banker have a chance of turning the singleton condition off, otherwise Zephrys will trigger.
---
maybe they dont have the money you do
---
Updated my post with a link to the deck I use :)
---
RemindMe! 1 month
---
Opening day decks?
---
Check back in 2 weeks
---
It still doesn't really interest me, but thx for your input. I now understand a little better why everyone disagrees with me when I say this.
---
Someone's never heard the cautionary tales allot being satisfied with enough and not letting greed keep demanding more from the Genie.
---
Oh you will see,belive me
---
Someone has never seen a joke in their life.
---
I think it's still fun to play. Don't always have to play the best top tier deck. The xpac just dropped, have some fun and experiment.
---
Quest druid with lucentbark that I'm running is pretty fun
---
Damn that's the quest I pulled too.
---
Every time I see warrior as my opponent I immediately loathe the match. Its just 30 turns of everything I toss getting utterly obliterated and then I fatigue. 
---
Every game. Why bother
---
#F
---
These are the options he gives when you play him on turn 2 on an empty board, are you sure it happened on turn 5?
---
I just had a board full of 3 health minions and I didn't get given hellfire...instead I chose blessing of kings which cleared one minion...not happy.
---
List for token Druid?
---
Giggling inventor is great, also that bunny that makes copies of itself. Faceless lackeys are also good, so I put two of the totems that add them after your turn.
---
Cursed Blade is one of the highest winrate cards in pirate warrior. The downside isn't the big of a deal. You always swing immediately with it so your opponent has two turns to capitalize and often it doesn't mean much.
---
How the hell do I play dogs rogue death rattle deck?
---
Seems super fun but I'm getting rocked
---
and whta if mage doesnt draw giant/conj? and shaman has hex aswell, and hagatha to get more later on and haunting visions. and possibly lackey aswell
---
It's kind of funny because the original control warrior was very different and a much healthier control deck.  But when you can generate three threats from one card, including a singular big threat isn't nearly as important.
---
Even more reason to run Skulking Geist. I call that an absolute win!
---
was at rank 11 3 stars dropped to 15 by starting playing quest rogue lol. new expansion they say it will be fun they say
---
Like that‚Äôs a cool card man
---
Cursed blade is actually good in aggro. Tempo&gt;life
---
"Please, what's a 0/3 going to do?"
---
My favorite one was where I wanted to clear a Token Druid board with a Flamestrike and I got offered that, Blizzard and Baron Geddon. Geddon won me the game because he could not remove it.
---
Weird that I forgot about that because I was running Geddon instead of Elysiana in my Bomb Warrior list a few months ago for that specific matchup. Thanks Zephyrs.
---
I just wish they would be cool and play a new deck.
---
Bloodlust was lethal if you traded two of the 2/1 murlocs into the taunts he would've been at 13 and you would've had 15 on board
---
I play wild exclusively for this reason. I don‚Äôt care to be forced to play a deck because RNG packs decided that‚Äôs the class I get the cards for. Instead I play wild and slowly but surely I get enough of the newer cards to try most if not all of the new decks from each expansion. More fun except big priest, fuck them.
---
Nice Priest fix, bottom Tier 3 again. Brilliant.
---
Do you keep track of your Pity Timer? I would recommend you to buy Packs one for one until you hit your next legendary. From this point save up for the next expansion this year :) Thats what I am doing now.
---
I started saving after RoS but I missed out on a few dailies unfortunately and I managed to save up for 68 packs. Bit gutted to only get 3 out of those but these things happen.
---
The Tempo Warrior list I run and that is being run at high legend has a bunch of chargers that can combo for 12+ damage from hand starting turn 7 (6 with coin), so generally the board clear isnt too impactful which is why I said the Rager isn't as scary as I was expecting.

Maybe in 2 weeks taking away Twin Spell from Conjurer‚Äôs Calling would be nice. And Making Dr. boom cost 8 would be cool.
---
I followed you a while back anf you are quickly becoming my second faborite HS streamer. (Sorry no one wins over Vampire Daddy Kibler.)
---
Maybe I'm just unlucky but for me it's been about a 50-50. In one game against quest paladin my opponent had a boardfull of 2/2 Mechano Eggs and a Murmy, so I tried to set myself up for a Mass Dispel by leaving myself 4 Mana after playing Zephyrs. He offered me Edwin, Hungry Crab, and something else pretty useless that I forget. What could I have done better in that situation?
---
Just checked it, my bad, it was Savannah Highmane, Harrison Jones and Brightwing.
---
And what's the reward for playing your way? Showing that you can find and abuse the best decks as quickly as possible before balance changes hit?
---
Unless I am missing something it does look like you have lethal with the blood lust.
---
Well that makes it even weirder that I've never seen a boot....
---
Gave me gorehowl for lethal on Paladin. I'm sold.
---
Juntadral#2879 EU trading challenge a friend. I show you go first
---
&gt; I feel as people learn to play with this card
---
So far I've only seen it once, and the player used it on turn 2, to deal with my 1 minion.,, 
---
I won the game on turn 6.
---
People *really* need to learn to play with this card!
---
Except so much of mid-range hunter's deck power is backloaded onto Zuljin that in a pinch you can just slam every spell willy nilly because you know when you play Zuljin you'll get the swing turn to end all swing turns.
---
Both feel oppressive but saying Zuljin is nowhere near as problematic as Boom is super disingenuous. In fact I would say that Zuljin is a bigger problem because his swing turn is so much more ridiculous and he covers all of hunter's possible weaknesses.
---
True, wallet warrior used to actually be respectable. A phrase I wouldnt ever have imagined uttering back then.
---
My experience so far has been that this is a Paladin card that gives your opponent lethal.
---
Go into wild and use Brann, it‚Äôs hilariously broken.
---
I preffer the dorian + psymelon combo in druid for deathwing dragonlord shenanigans.
---
This one is REALLLY inconsistent and not even that strong (it would end up making a board of random 3/4 dragons, thats all)
---
I‚Äôm currently 10/0 with it around rank 15. I‚Äôm using Dog‚Äôs deck as a base with some personal tweaks.
---
I seen shudderwock really be stamped in every quest deck due to long battlecry and additional one with hero power.
---
Otherwise, other legendary cards are questionable choices as they will not offer best every time you use them.
---
Right now I‚Äôm at rank 2 but I started below 5 since I played mostly wild last month.  My list adds tirion and the legendary spell and cuts sn1p-sn4p and a couple other cards.  I my reborns are the 2 1/1s, the 2 cost mechs, the one that has +2 when damaged, the taunt with 3 health dr, the 2/5 taunt and a single copy of the 3 cost 3/2.  The rest are mainly the mechanized eggs and dragons, 2 copies of the ‚Äúhave a quest draw a card‚Äù and the 2/4 taunt, divine shield mech, 2 crystology and 2 of the new ‚Äúset health and attack to 1‚Äù  spell.   I think the only other card is Zilliax.  
---
I mulligan for a 1 or 2 drop reborn or crystology.  The deck thinning and ability to regularly set up the redemptions how you want it it go off through the single bellringwr definitely makes a huge difference and is what seems to have brought the deck up to the next level of power.  The only trouble I‚Äôve had was a Druid with and Murloc shaman if they have perfect draws and even then Druid isn‚Äôt too bad.  Murloc shaman is definitely a tough matchup if you don‚Äôt get one of the taunts early but it‚Äôs doable.  I‚Äôd highly recommend playing around with different builds as I think the quest is heavily underestimated right now.
---
I've been playing a decent amount of quest druid (not sure what lists people are playing, I'm not playing token version) and I'd say the "required" legionaries in it are Loti and Floop.  Loti for the single target rush/poison to kill tall minions and Floop for if you need another Loti or another Tending.  I'm also running Cenarius and I feel he's an easy cut.
---
Then my mech taunt warrior shall reign supreme!
---
Pretty sure a dev has already posted on a thread yesterday saying zephyr doesn‚Äôt seem to be interacting with 0 attack minions.
---
Quest druid is slightly broken
---
Funny how Twisting Nether didn't see much play for 8 mana (just a little in control warlock), but now everyone is super excited about playing it for 10 mana!
---
Yeah, but to be fair the autocomplete tries to make you the highest win rate deck. Just like the quest example, I would imagine, for instance, a zoo warlock with a random hireek would be better than handcuff zoo.
---
I gave a reason, it's annoying. 
---
You seem to be the toxic one here hating on me for not liking something you like. You literally said I was worse than AIDs for telling some one I find them annoying.
---
Your whining on reddit proves otherwise
---
Even the cheapest new deck requires a legendary and two epics and some people weren‚Äôt saving gold so instead keep playing what they have especially if it‚Äôs still a good deck
---
I ended up having almost everything I needed for Highlander Hunter. Opened Dinotamer Braun and Siamat, crafted Zephrys and just missing Houndmaster Shaw but I don't feel he's very important. That deck freaking requires six legendaries.
---
Well, they could fix the rewards/pricing
---
That's kinda morbid when you think about it
---
There is no class identity, just excuses for nerfs.
---
Worse than that, it‚Äôs damn near impossible for any other class to have a proper control deck because why would you bother.
---
Dude I got 45 packs just from doing my dailies since RoS launch, I even skipped few days just because I forgot or just didn‚Äôt feel like playing certain classes.
---
The latter
---
not such a clever disguise after all xd
---
Shaggy can't die in the cartoon. He always comes back alive so I respect the flavor Blizzard 10/10
---
Flavor fail hits again!
---
Why does this have to take up a tavern brawl slot though?
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/150/quest-druid#tab=similar  
---
no need to run lucentbark or any token generators that aren't choose one
---
I think I was watching Kibler play against a quest paladin and holy shit it was endless waves of 2/2 divine shield taunt eggs.
---
What deck list are you running? I‚Äôm excited for these cards as well!
---
You're complaining about a card giving you lethal. Amazing.
---
You get silence for your opponents minions, but not for your own, when you want to clear their frozen status
---
For the record, I open 100 packs every expansion.
---
Also for the record, you‚Äôd never be hired for PR: telling the primary group of your player base to suck it up is bad marketing; a majority of the player base are the casuals that dont put money in
---
Pillar man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land, that you understand.
---
After 136 packs, I didn't get any either
---
I want there to be a card with the equivalent of "endless rats" ability from MTG to get around the deck limits.
---
Dr boom could cost 10 gain 0 armor and would see play
---
Can you link their post outlining this original purpose?
---
Questing Explorer is basically Piper Perry  
---
Change my mind
---
Yeah, I've noticed it doesn't offer polymorphs or hex's unless there's only one or two big minions on the board.
---
only ran into 3 mirrors so it didn‚Äôt take too long
---
Yes, you start with a deck that doesn't make crafting or a deck that you know you'll like even if it's bad.  And then you can afford to make 1, maybe 2 other decks before you're out of dust.
---
My first deck this expansion cost me 200 dust because I was unlucky not to open Hyena Alphas.  My next deck after that cost me about 2.2k dust.  Now I have about 4k dust remaining, maybe one more deck, so I'm going to wait a while before I spend that.
---
i'm pretty sure he'll just offer the best board clear for your mana and other stuff...

I actually did not not about the adventure until like a week or so before it was about to launch. I found no discussion about it anywhere at the time and I go to this sub every few days or so. I visit no other HS content except youtube videos and Viscous Syndicate and HSreplay sometimes.
---
Definitely will be next on the chopping block. Wouldn't be surprised if it was raised to 5 mana instead of 4.
---
Apparently it's not working with 0 attack minions properly, since it can't attack (but it would be able to attack if it was buffed).
---
I bet 20 cards in his deck were spell removals, ramp, and draw.. 
---
so glad I don't play wild where the degenerates thrive. 
---
From what I see half the games are stalled out until round 50. What an actual pitiful way to win. Distasteful, boring, and tearing the fabric of how card games are actually played
---
Poor Shaggy, there's no Velma to be the brains to bail him out, or Daphne to do...what she does.
---
The only absolute must have legendary is the Hero card, so yeah, it's fairly cheap these days compared to a while back.
---
If you Alex first then coin Zeph it will
---
Just go for a relatively cheap S-A Tier deck and spam ranked. But there is no point going for high ranks anymore, whole ladder system is awful and meaningless. 
---
If you want to play competitive you can register for tournaments that qualify for masters tours on battlefy.But its super tedious and uses a terrible format.
---
*clicks spell damage remote
---
You got 3 legendaries in 32 packs? That‚Äôs really good! Besides that, the epic count is a little low but that is a successful pack opening if you ask me
---
You're talking nonsense, calm down.
---
Unpopular opinion
---
I put him in my Holy Wrath paladin. Won me multiple games. Turns out when you are trying to draw your whole deck it‚Äôs super easy to get him activated and he easily buys you that 1 more turn you need. (Or extra turn plus the 5 damage you need with Tirion)
---
Holy crap I'm imagining wild right now with stonehill and flunky just finding themselves and each other.
---
**Removing Big boards** Hunter has few AOE removal and it is all poor quality.
---
**Sustain** Hunter has no class healing nor armor gain. And hunter has very very few taunt minion.
---
**Direct Removal**  Hunter can kill minions but there is always a drawback. RNG or card disadvantage are common.
---
**Card Draw/Generation** Hunters are allowed to draw or generate card but like with removal there is always a drawback. Usually in what is generated or requiring a deckbuilding restriction
---
Just build it with tempo in mind my list is far from perfect. Frothings, mummy guy, town crier, the best tempo cards you can find. That‚Äôs my strategy so far and it‚Äôs handling the zoo and rushing down the control.
---
dumb
---
PERPARE TO FACE THE POWER OF MILLIS MANASTORM.
---
What are the better legendaries in this expansion?
---
*Laughs in Siamat*
---
I'm not an encyclopedia. It's common knowledge that it's for fun and a way for newer players to have fun. If you want a source then you can look it up.
---
I mean that‚Äôs all fine but it‚Äôs again only relative to the other cards in standard. I don‚Äôt think boom needs a nerf or hof, just wait and more cards will come to compete with it. You do realize that before rise of shadows boom wasn‚Äôt complained about right?   
---
And the personal attacks were unnecessary. I also saw the amount of warriors in the meta but I caught on very early on and targeted them with my decks. I played weapon removal, and decks like handlock and deathrattle hunter that just destroy warrior. Also cyclone mage but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. Why not play a deck that targets the metagame instead of blaming a specific deck? Warrior isn‚Äôt hard to beat unless you‚Äôre playing straight aggro. Even off meta decks like duel paladin and big shaman beat warrior. The problem is the lack of control tools in other classes to make those ‚Äúbig‚Äù archetypes viable vs aggro. Like if conj mage got better anti aggro tools believe me it would absolutely take over the metagame.
---
I've seen some lists run the taunt magnetize mechs and use that to turn their eggs into walls. I surely can't argue with your results, so you must be doing something right!
---
(Heavy southern accent) Ok son heas watcha wanna do, drive northwest for 10 miles, you gon go by an ol burnt oak tree, you wiff me? Then at the first junction go right 5 mins max yoll see Georges store ok? Go in and tell him you have a Druid problem he gon giddit taken care of and I heard the stuff he uses works on Rogues and all sorts of vermin as well! 
---
Disclaimer: Not my deck
---
# 1x (0) Topsy Turvy 
---
(Probably could/should be replaced)
---
# 2x (2) Penance 
---
(Ripple is a good substitute if you face a lot of token decks)
---
(Keep in mulligan he is your earliest playable minion plus if you can manage to quarantee him on Mass Ressurection with 2 other minions then it is usually game winning, it is also pretty consistent.)
---
# 2x (9) Plague of Death
---
Mass dispel against taunt warrior is pretty good apparently, especially when you have an attacking board and savage roar
---
Aggro isn‚Äôt fully up yet. Idk which does better against aggro, but I‚Äôd wait on that to happen before the druid quest is seen as better than anything
---
I wish Loti didn‚Äôt have stealth she‚Äôd be a lot better
---
Shouldn't have posted this here
---
It's a me, Vulpera!
---
Rather have divine shield then stealth any day
---
C'mon quit playing. You know that's what wild is made up of. Kids who can't afford to keep up with the game and work on the most degenerate OTK combinations or completely dead hands stall the game out until someone quits or runs out of cards.  It's sad and gross. And I know they be smiling their asses out cheeks grinning past their ears snickering at how pissed off their opponent is. 
---
Bro just look at your username LOL checks out
---
I crafted my Golden Whizbang.... 
---
It's the only gold legendary I have. Everything else has turned to dust.
---
And recruit
---
please tell me who won
---
Username checks out
---
i mean my standard highlander shaman is doing pretty good, but i couod probably yeet zephrys and put some duplicates but the deck doesn't seem to have problems this way. zephrys makes up for the condition most of the time, wether it be through booodlust in too lethal, tirion or twisting nether
---
I actually would love an astromancer. Between this, hero power, and cyclone my hand gets so full. I just can't seem to slot an astromancer in
---
CMON JADE YOUVE GOT THE CURVE ADVANTAGE
---
They look a bit oldschool
---
you deserve it
---
The majority of players don't enjoy bad decks lol, being why they are complaining.  If you build a deck and get your face caved in over and over, you're not going to want to play it.  Say what you will, the dust economy and the rate of duplicate epics is a problem and to not expect players to talk about it is just not realistic.
---
nice mimiron quest mage deck, looks fun.
---
Defile twice
---
No it is not. It was originally created to test out new features but people loved the format so much that kept it. 
---
IIRC they only added the pack reward later.
---
jade idol is such a busted card that they made skulking geist basically just for it.
---
That‚Äôs is some major bullshit hope they fix it soon!
---
the times where epic sax played on every trolden video. good times
---
Just gotta open another 419
---
This is my favorite stuff to do!
---
What rank are you at now? Where are you looking to be?
---
And what type of decks do you enjoy playing?
---
MrAwesome#1978 if you want to add me.
---
The shaman came from another dimension.
---
ah the sweet taste of not a tavern brawl in place of my favorite format.
---
Same. That was my guarenteed legendary. Still haven't used it or crafted a deck for it. Waiting to see if something got comes out or I'ma have to dust his ass for the likes of siamat
---
At the very least you can abuse their TERRIBLE early game and set up for your own quests but yeah it seems dumb "literally doing nothing" is a game plan now.
---
How is that possible? Zephrys only offers Basic and Classic cards, not Expansion cards like Blast Wave.
---
somebody hit that pasta
---
Well yeah I would put him in a deck that empties duplicates extremely fast

To be fair Hearthstone must inevitably trend in this direction if Blizzard wants to keep selling packs.
---
Remember how all of 2018 people were outraged at the low playrate of new cards? It was because the swing potential power level of 2017 cards (in particular, the Death Knights) were ludicrous and game breaking. But it wasn't just the DKs or they could have nerfed those - several quests, cube, Kathrena, the recruit mechanic in general, and more all horribly broke the mana curve and the amount of power one specific card could produce.
---
Wild is practically defined by having as many broken mechanics that cannot reasonably be responded to as possible in a deck.
---
Blizzard *must* continue making broken cards for profit. There are now dozens of cards even despite removing so many from classic through rotation or nerfs in not just wild but standard as well that represent upwards of multiple times more value than their mana cost justifies. I'm pretty sure they do not intend to go back and reevaluate the equivalent of an entire sets worth of cards that were made to either push archetypes, create "powerful" synergies, or just more generally get people to buy packs to get them.
---
Luckily pulled a lotta good legendaries this expansion but I crafted shrivallah to run in paladin with tip the scales and chef nomi. Fun deck but disappointing lol
---
I've had the most fun with warlock legendary (not quest) it's like a midrangey zoo deck and it's fucking fun to play
---
Quest midrange priest dominates warrior although it‚Äôs a hit or miss with everything else
---
why not give some people free wins so they get better rewards?
---
Control Warrior exists because of Conjurer‚Äôs Calling.
---
I was watching [this VoD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/463408048), where he was experimenting with it a little bit, so there were a lot of iterations. This is what I'm running with right now. I think second Sul'thraze is better than Arcanite Reaper, but I don't have one ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Note that I went from nearly 100% winrate from rank 9 to 6 to nearly 0% back down to low 7. Could just be bad luck, or could've just been good luck to start with...

I've had a lot of bloodlusts after a sticky N'zoth board when I was just looking for some removal tool or something. Feels good, man.
---
I like the card, I'd increase it's mana by 1 though so it doesn't come down too early.
---
But what if I am playing old Quest rogue and a bounce effect is actually the perfect card to complete the quest? I feel scammed...
---
Damn that's budget as can be.. so your telling me you are farming warriors with this? 
---
I have the quest but haven't been running shaman much
---
Or make it cost more

you go first please

I was playing Highlander Mage and had my Frost Lich Jaina already out. I'm on like 5hp and ready to take fatigue, and my opponent has a 5/3 on the board and there is no way I can take it out. I play Zephyrs having no idea what would be the perfect card and what do I get? Fire Elemental. Literally the perfect card in that situation. I deal with the 5/3, heal my hero for 3, and have a 6/5 with Lifesteal on the board. That's when I fell in love with Zephyrs.
---
I crafted hagatha the swamp queen and shudderwock for quest shaman, but then I realized I don‚Äôt like playing shaman.
---
Played a quest rogue into cw, game lasted 40 minutes, drained all my cards, died to fatigue.
---
The real question is if he gives you more than one of the options to win with style. Would be a hilarious misclick if he offers non-lethal options too
---
I think this is a strong case for why Dr boom is overpowered. Take him out of the list and all other winrates will drop like it's hot
---
I actually save a lot of gold. But I already have enough decks that I can play so I can get away with waiting. I'm not even complaining, just explaining why people might play with their old decks.
---
Oh, is that a leaked scene from Sword and Shield?
---
What's wrong with opening the Golden pack?
---
for a lot of us, rewards are irrelevant, I play tavern brawl because I love the wacky rules and whatnot, so for someone like me this isn't a tavern brawl, this is a week where I do not get to play my favorite format in a game that I love. I'm not saying brawliseum is a bad thing, I'm saying it is not a tavern brawl, why not just make it its own format entirely and give it a semi-regular schedule, people who love it get it on a schedule, people who want weird rules, get to have their weird rules, its a win-win.
---
Calling it now warrior is still going to be the best deck because doctor boom is stupid
---
To be fair all the new quests are hero power replacements which is largely what makes hero cards so powerful. The one off effects (ie, Zul'jin) can be monumental, but the game breaking mechanic is the constant value of a button that is often worth more than a card per turn by itself.
---
The shaman quest, for example, is proving way more valuable and influential than random spells off the Hagatha hero card. And then the only value in Hagatha is a 3 damage mutual board aoe. And the druid quest seems easily exceeds Dr. Booms in value generated over the course of an average game.
---
I will be truly surprised if they don't nerd control warrior soon. Every deck is made with thought: "how does it compete against control warrior?" That's not healthy.
---
I don't have Solia but I packed Kalecgos. Is that a good replacement?
---
Zephyr's apprentice?
---
I hate that literally any highlander deck can‚Äôt fight warrior at all because they might get a lucky bomb into your deck. Hey that deck needs some nerfs now man
---
But I'd you take a good look at the list. There are 4-5 cards that are knew as well. It's just there is less experimenting necessary when Dr boom gives you so much raw power
---
i open the brawl and see the banner. immediately close the tab
---
It honestly depends on if you have another coexisting highlander cards. 
---
Bran seems to be the best out of the 4 being a hunter jan‚Äôali along with hunter having enough cards to support a highlander style of deck.
---
Reno can be pretty strong clearing the board and then leaving you some stats but he is no where as swingy as the old Reno. Still he is a good card so a Reno mage could work but it‚Äôs not as strong as conjuror mage. 
---
Elise is mainly use for combo shenanigans. I tried it out in a quest druid and it seemed ok.
---
Finely... is the weakest of the 4. The ability to get any powered up hero power seems amazing but paladin really doesn‚Äôt have enough good cards to support this type of deck. 
---
Personally if you have bran go for it. If you have Reno and Elise and other supporting cards like the quests go for it. If you have finely maybe you should wait. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have any of them wait because you can always make them later and zep is a amazing card but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the highlander style of deck for just one card but I have seen some zoo decks play it because it always spots lethal.
---
I've reached 0 gold. Hello darkness my old friend, bye bye Brawliseum.
---
Tempo is an easy to understand but difficult to explain concept. Think of it as maximizing the efficient use of your resources and minimizing the efficient use of your opponent's. Rogue is the class most often associated with Tempo because it has some of the best examples of the concept. If you played Backstab into SI:7 Agent, you dealt four damage (possibly split between two targets) and put a 3/3 minion on the board for three mana. If you managed to kill one or two of your opponent's minions with that play, you've generated lots of tempo in that you managed to put remove resources from your opponent's board while generating resources of your own. You see the same thing in Mage occasionally. Tempo Mage used to spend three mana to play a 4/3 Kirin Tor Mage and cast a free Explosive Runes which would then destroy the next minion your opponent played and deal the excess damage to their face. That's a big tempo swing because your opponent spent life, mana, and a card and came away with nothing while you still have a 4/3 on the board.
---
Zoo is a deck archetype that focuses on playing small, efficient, and often resilient minions with the intent of using them to control the board through efficient trades with your opponent's minions. It's pretty much exclusive to Warlock since the class has the ability to draw a card every turn with its hero power, something essential if you want to be able to maintain board presence with such small minions.
---
It's different from a straight up aggro deck in that you want to trade more often than not with Zoo. The term itself comes from Magic: The Gathering where aggressive decks that ran similarly small, efficient minions that were often animals were called Zoo.
---
I had lethal in hand that doesnt count
