Actually, I'd kinda like to see a revival of "If you have a mech" as was first introduced in GvG. It's been a while, and would mesh well with a lot of the Mechs introduced in Boomsday.

&gt; Master Rule 4
---
You're not kidding, I looked it up and the 'link' mechanic really seems to have completely changed the game, as well as Pendulum Monsters.
---
Good to know!
---
I agree mostly, but imagine that on turn 8 you see the hunter has only three cards in hand, you play this card and see that there is no KC. Now, instead of making the choice to heal out of KC range you can elect to use that mana to build a more threatening board instead of playing around a threat that your opponent doesn't have - ie instead of playing sub-optimally given the potential information available.
---
Definitely not the most powerful thing ever, but knowing when an opponent does/doesn't have lethal (vs when they *might* have lethal) means that plays which would be bad in an uncertain environment become good.
---
Yugioh isn't a computer card game. People have to do all of the mechanics themselves.
---
Same. And I use "wow" a lot too. When the opponent makes a great play. When the opponent gets screwed by RNG. When I get screwed by RNG. 
---
I played some crazy Ice Lance mage it Tavern Brawl last night while I was sitting at the bar. She hit me with seven of them in a row and milled most of my deck while she was at it. I was laughing so hard that the lady next to me asked me what was wrong. Unfortunately for the cheeky mage, she couldn't find the last one, so I ended up winning. We both emoted "wow" while it was happening, and both said "well played" at the end. I ended up adding her to my friends list.
---
Yeah it'll be pretty good in Arena but I can't see this being played in Constructed. Perhaps it'll find a spot in decks since Priest's early game is so bad anyways.
---
Wasn't this in one of the puzzles?
---
You’re not missing much. I enjoyed it as a kid with friends, but nowadays if you can’t win on turn 1 your deck is garbage
---
But you spend 3 mana doing that, and also chameleos has already shown its not that great.
---
Further you describe a super specific scenario... cards that are good are good at ALL times.  Cards like Tarim, lich king, etc are cards that show that a card that is good from behind, equal, and winning games are EXTRA good.
---
Madam lazul is only good in certain very specific situations that are fairly unlikely...
---
I have max golden copies for the common cards and 2400dust currently. I have NO copies of any of the rares/epics/legendaries. What should I craft if I want maximum dust value? 
---
The “proper” etiquette is for the loser to give the Well Played first to let the other side know that there are no hard feelings. That said it’s not really a big deal. I often find myself breaking that rule when it was a close game and I topdeck lethal or something. A little BM never hurts. :)
---
Nice
---
This is ... AWESOME =O
---
"Aww, who's a 3/2 body? You are, yes you are!"
---
(I know you meant 'clever girl' but I like to imagine this instead)
---
I dunno, I don't see a deck where I wouldn't want to play this. It's not as slow as Chameleos, and Drakonid Operative has shown how powerful this effect can be. 
---
I'm running it just for the hell of it in a quest priest. Most of the times it's a shitty topdeck. Sometimes in the opening hand it's amazing. Just 2 days ago I had one of the funniest things happening with it.
---
Chameleos copied Elise the Trailblazer. Of course I play it. Elise dies, I resurrect her because it was the best body to pick and got [[Spirit Echoes]] from the pack, making the res return to my hand. Play another Elise and in that pack was ANOTHER Elise. It's not like that won me the game, but it was really fun. 
---
What about steamers like Toast who likes to give screwy ratings? He gave Lazul's Scheme 10/5
---
I do, I'll take an extra 30k dust in standard over a couple of cards in a format I hate anyway. 
---
What do you mean "not as slow as Chameleos". It requires you to play a 3 mana 3/2 to get the card rather than to just get the card.
---
... My email as no packs 
---
Free packs? Where my evil name tag &amp; uniform boys
---
Nah, villains get lackeys and heroes get twinspells, so it’s very possible that we’ll see more villains throughout the year.
---
Doesn't that mean it's a bad legendary? Most legendaries have a level of flash attached to them: even boring ones like Zilliax are keyword soup creatures.
---
Classic has a number of these "boring" legendaries (Thalnos, King Krush), but I'd expect expansions to have less vanilla cards in them.
---
This card is incredibly good, but it's awful as a legendary minion. This could have been made at rare/epic and nobody would think twice.
---
What is your deck?
---
Ah ok thats kind of dissapointing twinspells are cool but dont feel as good as lackies flavor wise imo
---

---
How did you manage to get 3 rags in standard
---
Maybe you should quit. Then you'll get free stuff eventually. You should quit Reddit too.
---
Agreed. It's not OP, but it's way too pushed.
---
It’s way better, most of the time chameleos just sits in your hand. This card gives you board presence 
---
Yes u are.... build whizbang or get memed on son
---
I disenchant bad epics and bad legendaddies. I honestly think dusting rares and commons is a huge waste of time as you would get around 400 dust from 3 or 4 pages of dusting
---
Try This with paladin or odd priest lul
---
PUT YOU FACE IN THE LIGHT
---
So.. Cheat.
---
It also looks like 8!
---
Objectively wrong, I didn't play in beta and I know many people who also didn't. Pretty sure there are a lot of games that have retained a high player base.
---
Not even remotely f2p btw.
---
Anyone who thinks this card is garbage must be smoking meth. It's literally curious glimmer root, chameleos and drakanoid operative in a card. You get hand info, get to pick which card you want and for that you still get a 3/2 body for 3 mana. If you have coin and another play on 3 you can always coin this on 2 as well.
---
While 3/2 isnt the best it makes up for what the card does. This like the previous cards mentioned will be played in a mid range type deck most assuredly. Whether midrange priest will be viable or not is still in the air but if so, expect this card to be a staple in most midrange priest decks.
---
And ofcourse I own all of these
---
This card is way better than Chameleos, I say this as someone who knew that Chameleos was not good from the start. It's not dead on the turn you draw it, you can play it to immediately got knowledge of three cards instead of having to wait probably like five turns, and it comes with some extra value in the form of a 3/2. On top of all that, you get to just pick the best card and wait for the best time to use it, instead of hoping it changes into the best card at the appropriate time.
---
One of the ways you can increase the likelyhood of finding lethal is asking yourself every turn "Do I have lethal?", "How much damage do I have?", "How much reach from hand do I have?". That helps avoid tunnel visioning on clearing the board when you can push for lethal.
---
What i hope is that they no longer make beasts that have Lifesteal and rush... yeah im looking at you scalehide. 
---
What happens if your opponent's hand is empty?
---
And if you do that, you get zero value from it.
---
You are blessed.
---
Echo probably

Yeah fucking bs, am I right. They’re none contributing cows, useless to the society. I say we lock them up and take away there families ration cards!

f2p means nothing. If you been playing since beta then the amount of daily gold, rewards etc is the same as if u spend 1000 dollar as a new player. There should be a term called nf2p. New free to play. old f2p are the same as huge whales.
---
The teasers that they put are didnt hype me at all
---
That would be wild for them to bring back like old Meta decks like Pirate Rogue with Patches and other legendaries like that.
---
Chances are, given Team 5 seems to be staying within their own cast of characters, it will be Aya Blackpaw, Don Ho Cho, and Kazakus with perhaps a brand new character for the hunter Villain.
---
Granted, that is assuming they all aren't brand new characters to begin with.
---
No, i’m very much a prodominate constructed player. It’s just that I play a lot of funky non meta decks so I lose most of the time.

Mulligans your hand and silences + destroys your 1 of your opponent's monsters; at the cost of discarding a card.

We live in a society

They seem to identify as villains more than actually being evil.  Like, when people acting heroic try and stop your not particularly morally upright schemes, you're gonna call yourself a villain to show your hatred for the supposed heroes.

By far my favourite character in Warcraft altogether.

There are three types of people in this world. Water poisoners (negative effect on others), lawn mowers (neutral effect on others... just keep to their business), and life improvers (positive effect on others). I know it’s just a game, but I hope you change your ways, because the world needs less of that.
---
Thanks
---
I think the idea is by the end every class will have a villain and hero legendary . So i think we'll get the other 4 villains in the next expansion.

Thanks

Might've been nice to give this to accounts who haven't logged onto other servers in the same time frame. It's already kinda nonsense your collection doesn't transfer and now HCT qualifying relies heavily on having a collection on the other servers. Coulda been a nice boost to our collections there while still following the same rules and not giving grinding players another boost to their collection while waiting for the technology to carry your collection somewhere else.

Just have 1 billion of each Lackey, then it's pretty much same odds

There is nothing wrong with hero cards. There is a lot wrong with Death Knight cards, I too am glad they are rotation out, I wanted to see more hero cards that are well balanced like zul’jin, Hagatha, non are game breaking.
---
What if your opponent has 1 card in their hand?
---
yeah, well. . . ahem. . . you see Doomsayer costs *twice as much* and only has three-and-a-half times as much health!

More damage is possible

Hero power for the guaranteed taunt totem (8 Mana left)
---
Hit face with Searing Totem (1 damage)

Play both spellzerkers (4 Mana left)

Beakered Lightning (4 Mana left)

Totemic smash face for 6 (Spellpower + 4, 3 Mana left)

Healing rain Overdraws for 2+3+4+5+6 = 20 damage

Start of turn overdraws for 7 damage

Thanks for the several hours of entertainment, and I hope you keep doing awesome things!

Before the xyz fusions the game was relatively simple. 
---
Now there’s so much extra stuff going on it’s not worth playing 
---
aggro murloc decks are good for almost all classes but you can search in this subreddit for more optimum strategies. note that some of them may require restarting a few times. you don't have to play the match if you get a bad hand.

---
 I came up with this deck while playing on my phone during my breaks at work. I started off with a discard deck but I lost fast to tribal decks like beast hunter or murlock shaman. It was clear that tribal decks are strong in this tavern brawl. I started off with a demon deck but it sucked, so I switched to mechs and it was really strong. Before Wargear (5/5 magnetic), I had Rusty Recycler (2/6 taunt lifesteal mech) at first, but I needed something more offensive so I switched to wargear and it's working well. 
---
Yes....I'm aware that I never finished the "it would be nice..." line of thought but I lost focus when my opponent emoted me "well played". He/she was such a champ for giving me enough time to show what the highroll on this deck is like. 
---
I'm surprised there aren't more cards with 100% correct guesses. I assume people put spaces in flamestrike and things like that, because a lot more than 8 cards should've been 100%.
---
12 people wrote arcane missles? Damn... Work on your edumacation, guys.
---
i love that how Y'Shaarj is in the hardest list. i am pretty sure almost everyone knows the card but no one knows how to actually spell it LUL i would just type yssrjsrjsjrj
---
Or just play midrange hunter, the cheapest deck on ladder with a 55+% win rate
---
Why would we simply with this demand when Hakkar back is clearly the best back?
---
The chances were 1 to 1000 btw. 
---
These things do reward active players, yes, but those rewards themselves require investment of their own, when rewards like these don't. It might not be a lot, but it does make one feel better to get than the other, and someone who does less getting something better than someone who does more is going to irritate some of the latter.
---
As for "what are they going to do", that's easy: not _stop_ being loyal.
---
After last year, Blizzard is on thin ice with a lot of people due to their rapid-fire string of terrible decisions (Diablo, layoffs, etc). Shows of good will that apply to all &amp;ndash; not just some &amp;ndash; of their playerbase would absolutely have an impact.
---
Yes in the sense that that is how each ability would be worded to function within the rule book, but a card would never be printed with this much text. Divine Shield having no equivalent keyword adds the bulk of the text,  but that’s how it should be worded to function in a similar manor to hearthstone. A real magic card would also have a line break in between each ability, but that made the text a size that was too difficult to read in the program I used.
---
which of the druid board clears would've been the most effective do you think?
---
Probably one ooze and the second swapped with the Twig
---
I tend not to visit this sub all that often, but everytime I do I get disappointed. There's a reason r/hearthstonecirclejerk exists.
---
Oh, right. Usually those numbers are "percentage of decks" and "deck winrate" iirc, so I didn't bother watching this time.
---
It's still less clear than a bigger "1-2-3-4-5" I think.
---
Once, while this card is face up on the field, this card cannot be destroyed by battle. Your opponent can  only attack this card. After this cars attack, regain LP equal to this card attack;
---
Wheb this card is normal summoned, you can equip it to a machine-type monster, if you do, apply all the above effects on that monster

If you’re looking to break your wallet, Yu-Gi-Oh’s just the pussy round.

To be competitive in Modern MTG you’re dropping $1000 on average. Legacy’s about $4-5k and those of us with the deepest wallets wanting to play vintage are looking at (if you’re lucky) $20,000 for just the staples.
---
Someone already posted this a few days ago.

&gt; If they think that is too much to give us 10 or 100 packs,at least make they need to make cardback with reddit logo.If they dont give us any recognition,i think that existenece of this subreddit is pointles.

---
I dunno, the idea seems cool, maybe even more with Zentimo and #My Jaws That Bite 
---
With the next set ungoro, frozen throne, and kobolds will be rotated out of standard and into wild only.
---
Yeah. I also added Ysera because it's the only legendary I have, but I don't get to use her at all with this deck. I've been playing the game for a while but never seriously until now
---
Well I think some magnetic cards would help,although this deck might not be able to keep up with what is on the meta these days
---
What they said has never been true but people have been spewing the same bullshit since 2010.
---
Aggro decks seem to do the best in lower ranks
---
Sam here 
---
Sadly this doesn't work very well for MtG, since there is no taunt equivalent no matter how wordy you get. 
---
I initially made it to be a 1800/2500 since that's roughly the ratio for HS&gt;YGO, but then found it to be too silly looking for such a high cost card, but i didn't want to give it 3k+ stats either since it doesnt have the "high end statlines" (8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 4/12). 
---
So I settled for 2400/2800 completely arbitrarily.
---
Frankly though, the stats aren't that great nowadays. 
---
Exaggerating. First Turn Kill decks are immediately banned if they become viable.
---
How would you make this into an aggro deck? what cards would you rid of and what would you add
---
Just use the auto complete feature
---
So what decks have you been facing?
---
Baka may maintenance po! ^_^
---
As far as yugioh texts goes this is pretty average.
---
r/emergencyifellfor
---
For your case
---
Now before the rotation I get aggravated when my opponent drops a DK (Rexxar) can’t wait for that rotation. However that’s not how I react to zul’jin.
---
Doing insane stuff is fun. 
---
I occasionally log in and play the solo adventures. Haven’t done ranked in months. No packs for me. And no quest completion either. Looks like I’m staying in solo adventures for this expac too
---
Those are still closer to HS mechanics than Vigilance is to Taunt. Those aren't even vaguely similar. 
---
Best aggro decks are in hunter,although if you're playing paladin you need early game pressure.Unfortunately,that will be lost in a few weeks time when Baku rotates
---
In Yugioh, you can only Normal Summon once per turn, so that strategy wouldn't work in this context, even if it didnt prevent spells.
---
Also, it does a pretty poor job of being a win condition due to its ability to flood the board being highly valued in Hearthstone, but relatively weak in Yugioh due to the sheer amount of removal.
---
this is the best thing ive seen from this sub in a while
---
Before the new year drop prince kel’sethzl. Only got 2 2 drops and one of the is holy light.
---
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** -tfs-! ^(hug)
---
That would only be reasonable if the effect changed the minions to 4/4. Blizz wouldn't print it otherwise. /s
---
Seems like a really nice card, mostly because of the discover. I don't see a spot for it in priest however. 
---
Next do shifter zerus.
---
RIP Neptune.
---
He annoys me, so I don't watch him, but playing bad decks and being bad are not the same thing. Even ignoring the fact that he said it would keep drawing, it also isn't an intuitive interaction or common knowledge if you didn't do the Boomsday labs. I flew through them and actually had to look that one up - it's literally never come up for me in thousands of games. 
---
Wow will gonna craft her Right now shes allready released and not revealed pogchamp. Hf testing her.
---
No, because bestow leaves the creature that was used as the aura on the battlefield once the creature it was enchanting dies.
---
Except the once per turn thing, its golden
---
then you get banned for cheating as you can't have more than 3 unique cards
---
MomSniper#2626 80g I'll show, you first, EU
---
Nice try but that's not the correct PSCT
---
Yeah, its almost as if Blizz designed the emotes to be rude/salty in order to build up competitiveness or something. I would love to say GG or compliment my opponents on good plays but with the emotes at hand I just cant.
---
It does exists, but the problem is, there's no rule for summoning extra deck cards from your hand. Things become even more complicated with the addition of the Extra Monster Zone. Do I need to tribute for Link/XYZ monster, since they don't have levels? Do I put them in the main monster zone or the extra monster zone? Either way, I don't think we will ever see extra monster cards going to the hand
---
Then I hope you will keep posting your art here, at least! :)

Basically.

Bestow make a creature that is 2 super types. creature and enchantment....hard to show in hs because hs has so few super type of cards. But basically you could cast it as a creature or a spell. So imagine spike ridge could be played for 4 mana just as a body....or 6 for the pump.. But if the body it pumps leaves play you get the body. This looks words by hs standards, but magic has to actually explain how things work mechanically, because you do not have a client to say THIS is how it works.

That's a way better name than what i came up with and i probably could've added shroom to that, thanks for the idea!
---
Pirate warrior
---
It's an adventure card, mate. 4 mana 7/7 that doomsays when it takes a hit and survives.
---
Not from rotating sets: Jade idol, Ice Block, Barnes.
---
From the rotating sets: Death knights, Spreading Plague, UI, start of game upgrade cards like Baku and Genn and motherfucking resurrection spells. 
---
If you want to give your opponents free wins, yeah you can do that. Just remember there are rank floors here and there.

This is the first time i see his face

No worries, glad I could clear that up for you.

Don’t you hate the skip skip reverse reverse uno combo? Too op please nerf.  
---
Really? I've done the whole dungeon with every class and have not once seen that card played. Does anyone in particular play that card?
---
there's an app for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6b6jqb/i_created_an_app_to_make_hearthstone_lethal/) 
---
Really cool translation! To prevent locks with the Taunt effect, you should add (or any cards with this effect) to show how any Taunt minion can be targeted for an attack while on the field.
---
"Must block if able" is a perfectly valid wording and mechanic in MTG, and wouldn't result in a creature having to block all declared attackers at all. It just needs to block a legal number of creatures (usually one) if possible. 
---

---
Here's a card that forces other creatures to block if able. Doesn't cause any problems due to phases at all. 
---
Right on, thanks for sharing that with me! I'm pretty good at controlled spending and I only use money I have set aside as hobby/game money.
---
I think because of the rotation and level field I am going to go with both pre-order and leave it at that for paying cash for Shadows packs. The value of $1/pack is too good to pass up and I'd likely spend the same amount over time, so may as well get max value and then use my gold to fill in WW/Boom/Rasta. That's my plan anyway, heh.

Literaly time out is the same as ice block. I just dont get it.

TBH banning jade idol shows that blizzard doesn't even understand their own brawl. That card wouldn't be top tier in this brawl. It was a viable deck in the 1 -card brawl even in top 2 it wasn't great so I have no idea why they thought it would be an issue here.   
---
And yes, I guess it's weird that they thought stuff like pathces and IB were too good but they left in the ability to make an otk mech board on turn 2/3, or mind blast. It wouldn't be fun if all the strong cards were banned so the first time they do a brawl they should let the players figure out what the best decks are and consider banning the second time around only, except in the case where a card clearly breaks the game. 
---
Now do the fake, poorly translated card version!

Yup.

Bad idea, loyal players would always complain about not getting rewards.

This is a great critique, I hope OP finds this useful.
---
It really is a fantastic piece.
---
Wow great work, if you told me this was a new card teaser i would have totally believed it.
---
Isn't Kangor + Forbidden Healing worth 20?
---
Spend a little money to quickly catch up. Then play what you want and have fun. That's the whole point of games.
---
Not sure they are crossed. Middle finger might just be at an angle 
---
Definitely unplayable outside of Standard. And even there it's a stretch.
---
The keywords are nice, but 5 mana 3/2 is just turbo-garbage.
---
It's time to D-d-d-duel!
---
Dont let these people talk you into stupidly submitting yoir portfolio prematurely. You have the right idea.
---
That card reminds me of Waboku. That one used to never mention anything about monsters as well iirc. Only said 0 battle damage or something. I was never sure of its exact effect until I played Yugioh NDS game. It's this thing mostly with older cards I guess.   
---
HS interactions look simpler in nature but they are so counter-intuitive it's ridiculous. That's the main problem I have with HS card texts. They are supposed to be simple but are complicated, and in a bad way. Just how the hell are we supposed to know what "teach" exactly means in the new Hagatha? Where in the card does it specify that you Discover, not randomly choose the spells to "teach"? It's not even a keyword that you can mouse over. Where is it mentioned that one card must be target spells and the other non-target? Same problem as Waboku and Hallowed Life Barrier only even worse. Details like these MUST be stated in card texts no matter what.  It wouldn't be that wordy either. It's simple laziness, no excuse.
---
I'm just saying the yugioh way of card texts is the right way even if it can be longer than we may like, as long as it leaves no confusion. Not saying they nailed it perfectly or anything. I completely get your point since I played Yugioh too, albeit almost a decade ago.
---
Kill the batman ?
---
Yes with coin. Shadows stepping the 1/1 and replaying for free.
---
Seems fun......
---
People take for granted how much text is removed when you have a game engine forcing you to obey the rules. MtG has to be as explicit as possible and still has gatherer for edge case rulings that you may need for clarification. If it’s not an evergreen keyword it has to be very specifically explained on the card itself.
---
***UR CANDALS FLICAR...***
---
I noticed two things that could be improved upon. First is that the contrast isn’t quite to the point of what I’m used to seeing on hearthstone cards (although it is very close). If you add some shadows/contrasting dark tones in the top half (to the feathers and the mask) it would really help shape up the figure and make it feel more like the art we’re used to seeing in hearthstone. The second thing is the composition. I had a little trouble telling where the arms where at first, especially under those tusks on the mask. The size/direction of those bits on the mask kinda cover up the gesture of the arms and make it feel a little more crowded/doesn’t give  quite enough depth imo. Just my unsolicited criticisms, the piece looks great over all! I wouldn’t have been surprised if you had told me this was art for a new card in the upcoming expansion. 
---
*Weird mental image of a Jaraxxus stand going* FACE! FACE FACE FACE FACE FACE FACE FACE....
---
[removed]
---
Taunt just simply doesn't work. MTGs combat works so different that it can't mimic HS.
---
If you let Zilliax untap, you enable shenanigans where you immediatly tap it again for some effect.
---
If you let Zilliax force an enemy creature to attack and it has to block, it still doesn't work, when Zilliax attacked. And Ziliax in HS doesn't forces attacks so this leads to:
---
Vigilance + Ziliax blocks if able would resemble HS the most. Maybe at a "This creature can not be tapped" for good measure.
---
Decks? 
---
Don't you have anything better to do kid? We are done here
---
oops
---
All the pros play Standard, and there is a new Standard rotation coming in around two weeks, so it can be a decent time to jump back in.
---
Lots of powerful cards are rotating out soon and there will also be many good cards going to Hall of Fame - for which you can get a full dust refund. You can build a number of good budget decks by crafting the Hall of Fame cards and play them for a couple of weeks. No one knows what the game will look like after the rotation yet.
---
Here's a guide to Hall of Fame cards: https://youtu.be/t4v93csepfk
---
Here are some budget decks, Even and Odd ones are easy to make based on Hall of Fame cards: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAjYYYC68Q-nPaAOi17fhyrbocc_O3zTD
---
Yea, mb
---
Actually if you overkill the enemy *hero* the totem still comes out, so it’s still possible to get extra spell damage here I believe.
---
If you believe in the heart of cards and are rank 20, you can summon Fraogsaron, Hope's End.
---
And that was still harder than what you just did.
---
Just autocomplete and it will be better
---
&gt; Barnes isn’t the problem, it’s the cheap resurrect spells that make Big Priest powerful.
---
I so wish more people understood this. Shadow Essence and Eternal Servitude shoud cost more mana and either Lifesteal or Deathrattle should be removed from Obsidian Statue.
---
Mystery card
---
They say 90% of the time, it works every time

How hard is it for you to scroll past a few more posts you don't care for, like everyday for me,  without the need to whine about it?

I so wish more people understood this! Shadow Essence and Eternal Servitude shoud cost more mana and either Lifesteal or Deathrattle should be removed from Obsidian Statue.

---
I like that little detail. She's a mage after all. They do those little finger things to serve different purposes.
---
For I'm sure if the fingers weren't crossed, the spell would either fail to cast outright or fizzle.
---
Thats the fun of it, they never realize before its too late. And a lot of times they just leave up high health minions to go face, which you immediatly make them regret.
---
Anyfin is great, but struggles against odd pally and even shaman, and that's all you see at higher ranks.  So I switched to evenlock to deal with all the aggro and it kept maybe a 60-65% winrate
---
From 23 to legend
---
I want to play Undertaker Hunter again!  That was such a fun meta... oh wait, that's a really bad idea.
---
We actually really do live in a society 
---
Havent played hs in a while and thought this was a real card at first. So you hit it pretty spot on!
---
The only thing that stands out to me is that the one feather on the left has a bit of a sloppy feel to it so might wanna touch that up if you agree.
---
Ellipses is cheating. A genuine Yugioh! card would fit the effect with 0.5 pt text even if its completely illegible. Also, they would also utilize their super thin sandwiched font. 
---
It's still a fair point that it's a spit in the face to loyal customers. It doesn't cost them anything to reward their players. It's digital goods. No overhead. 
---
Gaslighting someone to draw attention away from the point makes you no better. Focus less on the tone and more on the message. It's worth considering the fact that Blizzard isn't not supporting their players. If I knew Blizzard didn't give a fuck about me once I started playing then I would have ignored the free packs.
---
I don't understand what it says there. Are those game modes just the sets you can use or they have different things gameplay wise?
---
Playing that deck with a Death’s bite on turn 4 with a grim patron in your hand&gt;&gt;
---
With 2k upvotes I believe they're watching ;)
---
Not really, purchased by Gold, 700 per wing, or $19.99 for fast-trackers. There are pack rewards (3) per wing so you get some return on investment. You can get each wing for around 10-12 days of daily quest Gold. 
---
Ooh I *got* to play the game what a privledge. That shit for brains wording instantly makes you a Blizzard shill.
---
work smarter not harder
---
Oh, you mean Bill?
---
Just play MTG Forge. Sideload the APK and you can play MTG with anyone you want with all the cards.
---
I like what you did there!
---
Yes, that's funny and sad because it's true.. :/
---
Deck of DOOM
---
You get the full value back and you can uncraft for more dust later. If you don't have a card on that list, you should always craft golden if you can afford it.
---
Is that actually how the card is?
---
Wait, this isn't the sub? How can they outjerk us
---
If 
---
Someone on /r/customhearthstone pointed out all the crazy combos that the author didn't realize and suggested changing it to Spell Damage=0.
---
Just like the regular Patron Warrior counter part...
---
Not very rare
---
The odd thing:  It is balanced.  The power level is through the roof, but there's a huge number of meta decks there all balanced around that 'bullshit' power level.
---
not really all of those option because you forget what is called the flexibility. The echo allow for it to be play when desired, aka as a sligtly expensive sprint or as an apprentice like you say  and that is very valuable. Beside that , it's a rogue spell that cost few and add value aka synergie with combo mechanic and things like auctioneer. Yeah this would not be busted like UI but i said good card not auto include class shaping card.
---
Ahh. It's that joyous time of year when the expansion speculation turns into a shitpost-fest of people trying to farm easy karma. 
---
Watch the dubs in Season 1, might as well Little Kuriboh's reactions.
---
Season 2 also, but watch it subbed if you want to get pre-DIO voice actor for the second season's main antagonist. Also rewatch the subbed version if Jaden lost, there's important key detail motive of the story against the main antagonist's 'pawn' that didn't happen in the dub.
---
Never watch Season 3 as dubbed, darker parts are changed to fit Jaden's happy go lucky personality.
---
There's no season 4 dub so go with subs.
---
No, it would cause all enemy creatures to block Zilliax when it attacked. 
---
Impomancer is pretty busted with the new cards Rafaam's Scheme. 10 mana fill your board with random demons. 
---
Then it's not a hero card. 
---
So I actually don’t need to buy a KnC pack for the free Marin The Fox if I receive a free pack for logging in during the year of the mammoth event correct. Am I reading that correctly?
---
exactly the same, except it doesnt cost mana :P
---
What?
---
There should really be a subreddit for all of yugioh and magic versions of hearthstone cards
---
The only limitations are the cards you have. There’s no mans system. Decks that get the nuts for their draw can have a full board on the first turn they go.
---
You get a card back for all new solo content after ice crown the only reward. Ice Crown gives you a deathknight for the prologue, a pack for each wing and arthas as an alternate hero for beating the lich King with each class
---
The older solo content can be purchased in the web store and gives you full copies of around 30 cards for each. Do a search for HearthStone adventures if you want to know more
---
I think 2 mana draw a card echo would be a fine card, but it wouldn't need the drawback I posted here.
---
It's basically a toss up.  Genn might be seen slightly more because of how powerful Even Warlock is right now. (and Even Shaman).  Baku is just as strong with Odd Paladin and Odd Rogue thoug the latter took a huge hit with Cold Blood nerf.
---
It's [vacuously true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth).
---
**Vacuous truth**
---
In mathematics and logic, a vacuous truth is a statement that asserts that all members of the empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be true whenever there are no cell phones in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned on" would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on and turned off".
---
More formally, a relatively well-defined usage refers to a conditional statement with a false antecedent.

Why we dont mention baku warrior??? Kappa
---
If it's not from basic/classic it doesn't affect jaraxxus.
---
Lots of design space will open up if Leeroy is hall-of-famed. Unfortunately it's one of the quintissential aggro finisher cards so I doubt that's happening. 
---
That sounds incredibly annoying. Surprised ppl play that game

Jaraxxus is affected by "make minion's health 1" paladin secret.

It do be like that sometimes.

I did it with deathrattle pirate rogue.. you can find a link with more information in the other comment I posted here ;)

Bitch I won I hallucinated a fireball and then got a weird card that gave me half my opponents deck and won by timing him out
---
Lol harsh subreddit. 
---
As someone who started playing Yugioh again after many years, I’d say I’m having fun. Its kinda like playing two combo/control decks in Hearthstone but both players start at 10 mana. 
---
Games do end very quickly, but its like you skipped early game for most decks. The unstoppable boards can be prevented with proper deck building and if you can break those boards, your opponent usually commits alot of resources and you can clap back. 
---
I could ramble for a while on it, but in the end it is fun.

Yeah, I'd much rather know which dads hit legend or see some legendary openings. Some original content? Blegh.

Sure if you wanna conveniently ignore the 30-50 cards that never get revealed in any of those phases and are just dumped on the website/Facebook after the final reveal stream. That's a few weeks of reveals that they could have but dont, they should use those instead of having a mass dump at the end. 
---
when you play it not "once per turn"
---
What do you mean?  If you have higher attack and attack attack position...
---
5D's is my favorite but GX was pretty great. Season 3 and 4 were really good and there were many cool archetypes introduced. Obviously Elemental Hero, Destiny Hero Cyber Dragons, Crystal Beast, etc.
---
That's more of an internet thing.

*divination as a yugioh card
---
r/hearthstonemeta
---
No its not. Its annoying spam.
---
You don't take damage from this card, but from the cards you draw using this. 
---
Yeah, it’s just way too confusing right now. Am I supposed to draw from my deck I’m currently playing, my opponent’s deck, my deck that I’m not currently playing, or am I actually just supposed to physically draw two cards with pen and paper?
---
Less than a day and the front page is already infested. People need to calm down with the memes.
---
There are effects that have been printed recently that do "for this first time this game" without problem. Just mark it with any kind of token or something. Doesnt need to be insane.
---
Its just kids being kids.  
---
I don't see how the mods haven't done anything about the spam of these Yugioh Memes.
---
I was looking what was wrong and couldn’t find it until i read your comment.
---
nice dude, gonna have to give it a watch, thanks
---
No way Rafaam is level 70 at most, he was present at Uldum (as seen in the League of Explorers trailer)! That's a level 85 zone, he could have killed Deathwing!!!
---
How do you get it to be a mimic. I saw it with a tongue one time
---
Why would remain on the board for a game you find boring?  
---
I'll never understand that thought process. Just because you're bored doesn't mean the front page should be nuked with a spam of memes. 
---
That’s not true if you get rid of espionage then you can just play mill rogue with cold light shadowstep.
---
XDD
---
Actually, it's changing with the release of the next expansion (rotating sets for arena).
---
Yeah sure mate, im not home now so I don’t remember my user tag, i msg you when im back!
---
Uhhhhhh i gotta go
---
Speaking of cards like these. Only I think that 4 mana 3/2 combo draw 2 minions rogue cars is a classic card? Or healing rain. I couos swear that those are classic. 
---
Kinda like the trigger:cost;effect deal, but of all of the information they chose to hide, they hide the one that could be explained in if (x happens): you must (pay cost); then you (effect), it just saves you like 4 short words, instead of shortening something like "This card can't be normal summoned or set". 
---
There's 0 net gain but it cost you nothing to craft it as well because your dust is refunding it. So there's 0 downside to crafting it if you already have the dust and if you disenchant one or both you're up 1600 or 2000 dust.
---
Sounds like they are using "appear offline". It's just hard to believe that it's the case for as many as 20 people. Maybe it's on your side? Can you see any of your friends at all online? 
---
It's more expensive because it's the opposite of going face.
---
Well they should do fine cause kadgar is a shitty wizzard ;) 
---
But what does it do? 
---
I like the WSOE format in general. Bringing decks from all classes and doing a ban, pick, ban, pick, ban, pick gives the initiative to opponents so players cannot rely on getting their pet decks through easily.
---
Nice!!! I used control odd mage with pocket galaxy. It was a good month for climbing!
---
But does your toaster play skyrim? 
---
No.
---
Did you just bandwagon onto this thread for imaginary internet points?
---
Grats dude. Dad legend is nothing to sneeze at. There are so many people who never even sniff rank 5. Good job!
---
Why use many card when few do trick
---
This is a joke, right?
---
The only reason would be to play with a golden card until you need the dust, but you are also locking yourself out of 3200 dust for a month. I don't think a lot of people can afford that when you can get a net gain from crafting cards like [[Gloom Stag]], [[Glitter Moth]] and any other HoF cards you are missing in golden. It's 6400 dust just for the mentioned epics. 
---
Mechwarper, Galvanizer, Metaltooth Leaper, and Zilliax is by far the best hunter deck.

Nice. My deck is quite the budget deck only costing 1,540 dust. I try to play smart, but go face as much as possible so that my opponent has to A) Hope they have a card in hand to clear my board or big minion and B) Spend Mana trying to deal with it. 
---
One of my late friends once told me something about life that I'll never forget. He told me that in life you want to make a decision, not a reaction. It took me a long time to really  understand what he meant. I apply that to Hearthstone as well. I pressure my opponent into making a reaction and not a decision.
---
LOL xD :joy: :ok_hand: :sweat_drops:
---
You really should. The filler in the second half really weighs it down but the final arc (like GX S4 wasn’t dubbed) is amazing and the ending is near perfect. (Would’ve been perfect if Yusei and Aki actually got together, but nope can’t have that😒)
---
&gt; It’s not a screenshot
---
That’s his point 
---
&gt; Rush does not equal Haste.
---
Attacking in Hearthstone also does not equal attacking in MtG either way, so it's a pretty moot point to complain about that.
---
You get full dust value for them....

Yeah but I still can't post

Trump is merely an elected official! That faction has identified itself with the city! And following the lore that's being built, that symbol represents the city's defence against E.V.I.L!

Yup people are lazy

Hey! Stop bashing this small indie company! They don't have the funds to buy all the words!

The meta is 100% solved now, so despite fewer people competing, those you will face at the bottleneck to legend will know exactly what to expect from each and every matchup. 
---
Yes, and...? What's your point?

Awesome thx

Creatures with provoke can't attack immediately though, so you still have that problem unsolved.

This only ziliax is arguably a bit of a tech spot you can run blingtron, the 1/3 magnet tech or something else (though ziliax is fine too but if you miss the discount cant get stuck in the hand).  Most games are over by turn 3-5.

Wild is already pretty full of strong decks and while baku and genn decks are definitely up there rn, over time these decks will lose power instead of gaining it in wild. Because the restriction is so heavy as more card are printed more and more synergies are gonna show up between even/odd cards and more and more the hero power benefit wont be as tempting. Reno-like cards that have a singleton restriction I think will grow in power because they still keep these synergied its just less consistent and as more.cards are printed that consistency will go up because youll have two cards with very similar effects. 
---
In short, Baku and Genn make decks more consistent because they upgrade your hero power which is always there, therefore they will go down in powerlevel as consistency becomes more widespread through other synergies. While reno cards should go up in power because they grant value at the cost of consistency which will raise naturally as more cards are printed.
---
I think its safe to craft them since its free but I dont think they will last forever in wild. Maybe around tier2/3 as time passes. 
---
Yeah, volcano is the coolest interaction in the game with the game board! I wish we had more of them in the past and also in the future. :/
---
One for all and all for me.

Daily quest completion and 10 gold per 3 wins
---
What they aren't showing you are the 1 cost hero cards and legendaries they always seem to get off of espionage
---
A bit late: I have normal baku and genn. 2x Normal gloom stag. 2x golden black cat. 2x murkspark eel. 0 glitter moths. So the best I can do with 3800 dust is making 2 golden glitter moths? 
---
Just do magnetic using DFC tech ;)

People could just be screwing around a bit because of the rotation coming up? Toast was like rank 10 for awhile because he didn't care. Granted he was playing really bad decks probably, but still? Also people could be playing less and are just now coming back in preparation for the expansion maybe so you're catching good players now climbing the ranks? Just two random thoughts. Could be totally wrong. 
---
You realize we can see your log on the side, right?
---
You swung with a weapon, played Tools of the Trade which equipped the Stake Thrower and swung again.
---
If he really wanted to BM, he would do lethal damage with that last 2 attack minion.
---
Congrats! I love seeing posts like these. Reminds me of my first time reaching rank 5 :')
---
Maybe because of the format, certainly not the games. The level was very low and a few people didn't even know how to play some of their decks. Like at all.
---
Yea, but what's it do?
---
That's a lot of spells that don't provide a body. Very different. They are a 0 for 1 that so nothing but heal, effectively. They certainly don't kill 2 creatures on the way.
---
Also, Lifesteal works on Effect Damage as well.
---
draw your last pathetic card yugi
