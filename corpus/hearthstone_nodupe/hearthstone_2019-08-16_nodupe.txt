---
It says "a lot" to people who have done any basic coding that's for sure.
---
Secrets are bad in general, be it in wild or standard.
---
turns out swapping one strong card out of the highest winrate list for another strong card gives you a list with roughly the same winrate. who would have thunk it.
---
Uh, what? This is the single dumbest thing I've ever heard. How am I spending money in Overwatch to have an edge?
---
I’m not surprised your entire comment history is just straight up whining 24/7 about warrior
---
I don't see it as a loss based off queue, as much as Pally being built to exploit the weaknesses of control warrior. It's also just good against a lot of other decks, so it isn't like Pally is just warrior farming.
---
That’s because data collection takes time. Hsreplay is less reliable, but the data is updated in real time, and quest wall is listed as t2
---
That would be the best time, but there will still be 4 sets in play (3 from last year and the new one). Plus they’d have to match the theme of the last sets. It wouldn’t be easy unless they started planning the cards alongside 3 sets and released them all with the 4th.
---
High legend is mostly aggro right now but zomg warrior is still oppressive right reddit?
---
Sure sure but I still hate rock paper scissor metas which it feels a little bit like it’s going that way
---
you have obviously never played against big priest before if u think highlander decks are BS.
---
Thing is, the interaction is a gimmick. It’s inconsistent with the game mechanics. Contrary to popular belief Jaraxxus as your hero is not, in fact, a minion, try targeting him with Meteor or Wrath. He’s a hero, and you can’t target Morgl with Hungry Crab or Sir Annoy-O with EMP Operative.
---

---
The interaction is an easter egg from a different time and right now, this easter egg is making the card *significantly* worse. It’s negatively impacting the game that’s why I think it should be removed.
---
Looks like Black Friday sales are up.
---
Maybe that's what they have planned that they can't tell us.  Would explain why they haven't come out with anything else, cause it would take a lot of time and resources.
---
Errm, most of them complain because playing against CW is FUCKING BORING (removal, removal, more removal, discovered removal, no cards? no problem, 10 more turns for the CW without fatigue damage please!) and not because it's the best deck.
---
If they had spoiled Zephrys before the Explorers, my opinion on highlander would have been completely flipped.  Obviously, yes, once you build a Highlander deck then Reno will be one of the best cards in it.  But Zephrys is the reason why you would want to build the deck in the first place.  It's a card that is your best play on every single turn of the game, that is an absurdly strong card.
---
I still wish the Explorers were more interesting.  Kathrena Winterwisp was 8 mana summon a King Krush + a body, but that card really made me excited to play the decks it went in.  My favorite highlander card in SoU is really Vulpera Scoundrel.
---
You are one of the few that is actually averaging the mythical 100 dust per pack lol
---
Could be. Also I just realized they’d have to add more cards to the basic/classic sets. I don’t see it happening. It rolls be like adding a 6th mana color to Magic.
---
Tirion was a must include for every Paladin deck until Murloc Paladin became a thing and Shirvallah pretty much. It's still not even a bad card it's just theres so many cards you need in the typical decks they run now. If anyone plays control Paladin hes still a must have I'd guess
---
If you want card draw, why don't you play Tracking?
---
I have not heard that until now, and now this is the only name I will use for it
---
And here I thought one legendary in 25 packs was lucky...
---
I mean... Sure, you can indulge yourself in the intricacies of discursive argumentation here and there. But then again, on Reddit most often than not the most simplest, satisfactory resolution is to school a bitch. n_n

No, you are wrong.
---
Lol then you’re a bigger idiot than I thought.  At that point start growing.  It’s easy and far cheaper.  For someone who’s all about “value” you’re throwing away $2k a month on what I’m sure is absolute trash or WAY overpriced since $2k at anywhere near wholesale prices can get you a couple ounces of OIL, let alone weed.  Keep lying my friend.
---
I missed the old control style priest which is why I made a highlander quest priest that includes things like cabal. However I miss being able to run auchenai but it creates a big problem when trying to play any healing and is pretty dead if you complete the quest. Overall I have been happy with it specially since there are a lot of low hp big health minions (those poor paladins and their dino eggs)
---
Potentially , 38 was enough for this game
---
Okay but I like hearing the "UNITY. PRECISION. PERFECTION."
---
I main priest and I never played that combo. It's just stupid. I hate OTK decks in general and think those people should just go play solitaire if they want to just play games by themselves and not have any interaction in the game.
---
It's gonna be really hard to make a card prediction video without including any opinions in it.
---
You could still buy a PC.
---
Might just be that there aren't enough minions that run into it enough and it doesn't have enough synergy.
---
I watched the video, it really seemed like he was opting for nerfing warriors 1-drops. When warrior doesn't have good 1 drops, aggro has such a different game plan.
---
Town Cryer = 1/1
---
Eternium Rover = 1/2 
---
??
---
That's more an issue with Pocket Galaxy than with Quest Paladin
---
Just buy a pc as a college student to play hearthstone looool
---
Huh, I do have an older switch and an extra microSD card.
---
Would give Warlock a proper legendary card from the standard set.
---
It also has a few pro's:
---
* Removing the Demon tag would remove the instant-killing interaction.
---
* You gain 5 armour for some survivability.
---
* As your health will be set to 15, you can choose to heal up if you want to. Therefor you're not forced to stay at 15 health max for the entirety of the game.
---
It also has a few con's:
---
* It will be the only standard hero card in the entire game, and could be too strong for it.
---
* It cannot be summoned as a minion ever again.
---
* Removing the Demon tag might also remove some synergy.
---
I think Warlock deserves this, though. If it is too strong, it can ALWAYS be nerfed.
---
He seemed to be hinting at a Devastator nerf too, which I wouldn't mind.
---
I gave you an upvote, you are morally obligated to make this deck and steam it for YouTube content.
---
Not really. If you don't run Reno, there's not enough value in a singleton deck, to the point where if you want to be competitive you'll be better off making a new mage deck with duplicates.
---
Not gonna be nerfs because those would be visible in the update files to data miners, and they never risk giving players advance notice about those until they've announced them on the website.
---
Whilst not a bad idea what is the pay off for Blizzard?  You are reducing their revenue stream as I see it.  
---
That's the key to any idea around the dust system/economy.  You should also think what would make Blizzard even think twice about it being that they are clearly creaming it under the current system.  
---
Imo the only solution to changing the current system is if people stop spending so much money supporting the current system.
---
You can run this alongside the Shrivallah combo for an alternate, sometimes earlier win condition.
---
Makes sense
---
How would golden cards factor into this? It's worth mentioning that golden epics and legendaries already disenchant for 50% of their crafting cost. If golden cards could be discounted by the same 50% as regular cards then there's no reason to *not* craft them while they're discounted. Crafting then disenchanting wouldn't cost you anything.
---

---

---
Yup
---
You cant say that, don't you know net decking meta players want even less interaction in an already low interaction tcg?
---
Can someone explain how curse of rafaam is cgreat against mages? Can't they just play the card...? And it cost you 2 mana to play as well, I don't think I understand its value.
---
&gt;Overall, it’s performing a bit worse than Control Warrior, so why not just play that?
---
Because it beats Control Warrior and has other good matchups that Control doesn't?
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/SoftSpikyZucchiniWholeWheat](https://clips.twitch.tv/SoftSpikyZucchiniWholeWheat) 
---
It works
---
His advice is basically: play combo. Don't worry, though. Combo Priest is on the way.
---
That is not the point here. You said it was pretty solid against aggro, they asked why, you dodged the question.
---
It makes sense that it works that way, but it feels odd that Counterspell should be able to make Flare wiff like that.
---
I initially didn't like colossus of the moon but after crafting him and trying him out in my big warrior deck he seems pretty good. Super annoying to deal with.
---
Incorrect. With Dr.Boom, control warrior has basically infinite value. This makes it so there's really no point to play any other control deck competitively, since not even Hagatha can consistently match up to Dr.7's value engine.  Can't tell you how many times people saw cool control tools from other decks, and then most competent players realizing why bother, when Dr.7 exists?  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 This hurts diversity as well as cement Warrior as the class to run to beat most aggro decks and control decks, leaving them only weak to specified decks to counter them like Quest Paladin.   And while "fun" is subjective, I think its safe to say a large portion of the community just doesn't have fun playing against Dr.Boom, even if they are using a deck to counter them.     I could go into other aspects, but just offering on why there are more critical reasons why Warrior and specifically Dr.Boom are objective problems to the game.
---
how can Control Warrior have a 60% win rate if everyone is playing it
---
/r/itsreallywindy
---
Hsreplay.net already exists and basically does just that. On top of a bunch of other stats, they show certain card’s winrates, popularity and whatever else. I’m sure blizzard can make a similar system for their own stats to implement this feature.
---
unless i'm playing the deck, then everyone else is wrong
---
The problem with that is u could is that a 5/8(possibly more) weapon is really strong
---
I know man. I only play Rogue and Mage and i literally have 0 cards from the other classes, as i dust them all, and never touch these 2 classes cards even after a rotation. My first impression when i saw the new cards this expansion was, i immediately fell in love with Anka and that shadow spell whose name i forgot, as they had so much potential for insane plays, just like sonya, valeera, shadowdancer, shadowstep, recruiter and many others. These type of cards are why im playing the game, and im desperately waiting for some support to enable them, the same as you.
---
Bye Felicia!
---
meta was so cancerous at that time, tunnel trogg totem golem... iirc that was the last time I could play freeze mage in it's original form too
---
Truth is, I opened a golden Whizbang. Great fun and very shiny.
---
~~Consistent inconsistency~~ Vendetta’s alternative cost
---
Maybe hitting Kalecgos to 10hp first and spending all your mana would trigger pyro?   
---
0 mana = might offer pyro for next turn since oppo is in lethal range?
---
I mean, not really...? Looking at overall HSReplay stats, Control Warrior beats Bomb Warrior 53.1% of the time. 
---
Compared to Control, Bomb is unfavored against most Druid and Priest decks, Murloc Shaman, and Mech Hunter. They both lose to Mech/Quest Paladin and Highlander Hunter decks (although Bomb Warrior fares slightly better against the latter, for obvious reasons). 
---
The only match ups where Bomb Warrior fares significantly better than Control Warrior is against Highlander Mage, Quest Warlock, and Mecha'thun Warrior, and the latter two are hardly common.
---
Two sets of brackets.
---
More p2w and RNG mechanics. That's what I think today's game is lacking.
---
Justice for Warsong Commander!
---
In most cases, unless it's an emergency situation, people will hold Zephrys until it will win them the game. So "just wait until they play it" seems... optimistic, to put it mildly.

Blizzard: Here are some tips to improve your game and play the meta
---
Players: &lt;pikachu face&gt;
---
This seems like a lot of complication for something that ultimately wouldn't be all that useful. Virtually no one would trade legendaries or epics, and there's next to no point in trading commons and rares.
---
* Achievements: All kinds of them, each would award you some score and that score would be shown under your name ingame.
---
* Player profiles: We could click on other players' profiles (be it ingame or our friend list) and check out some of their stats such as number of cards owned (golden/nongolden are separate), wins by each class, class levels, achievements earned, etc.
---
* Leaderboards: So we could compare to our friends in categories such as total wins in play mode, total wins in arena, wins by class, etc. Global leaderboards would be cool too.
---
* Gold aquisition rate improved
---
* More deck slots
---
* Tournament mode
---
C- for effort
---
Why?
---
I'd say Divine spirit is fine but inner fire should be hall of fame when other toughness swapping cards also leave.
---
I feel like the identity of big walls and defensive cards in preist is ok but OTK isnt very fun and is stale at this point.

---
just dusted a bunch of gold cards, would be great if blizzard forecasted a major economy change like this.
---
Well said, I totally agree
---
It is the best deck in the game BUT I never feel like I am getting blasted, normally its just slowly getting outvalued into a loss and i think that its just too frustrating you are right.
---
just learn to play 4head
---
Those cards all existed in the LoE to MSoG era when Renolock was tier 1 and Jaraxxus was basically always in that deck. There are way more crazy things you can do now to deal damage over the top or generate burn that make Jaraxxus unplayable, it has nothing to do with the mere existence of burn.
---
Luckily morons like you aren't allowed to have an opinion
---
Control warrior is unarguably the best class in the game at the moment, only beaten by mage wich is also a busted class thanks to cc and Luna's. This game just became a clash between two classes, how is it fun and fair for the other 7 classes to play against them?
---
How would that even work? A permanent 2 attack, even on your opponent's turn? Would a [[Demonfire]], [[Bloodfury Potion]], and [[Demonheart]] Jaraxxus be OP as fuck?
---
North America includes South and Central America, because reasons
---
I just unpacked Zeph, so not sure how to feel about that since all the Reno decks are like 14k dust and up, and nothing feels even remotely safe as a craft. 
---
Got the Warrior and Priest quests. So been playing a lot of "No new card" aggro decks. =/

Most decks I run into either have too much burn to limit yourself to 15 health or are constantly dropping big threats.
---
No time to J rax anymore
---
If 15 is too low of max health, I think it could set max health to 18 or 20.
---
Losing the Demon tag means it can't be tutored from Sense Demons, which isn't a huge problem. It's actually a buff in some cases, because you can force draw, say, Aranasi Broodmothers guaranteed instead of a "dead" 9 cost.
---
how do you use it?
---
&gt;Every time people are having fun some guy comes along and starts quoting facts and ruins the party;-)
---
An OTK is dealing at least 30 damage out of your hand on one turn. An OTK deck should be able to do this consistently without board set-up. This means that you should be able to complete it at the start of the OTK turn without any minions on your side of the board.
---
Lost Tallstrider saw play in its bucket as a 5/4. It had the beast tag granted, but it was pretty much never relevant to it actually being picked. 5/4 is still better than a plain 4/4 statline, just the way it is.
---
It's how all *companies* work in China. It's pretty fucked up but the government has so much leverage because their market is so huge and exploding that basically all international companies just do what they're told. I mean smart of the government there, for sure.
---
The term confuses the crap out of me too tbh. Like some people don't consider Sn1p-sn4p wild combo an OTK because you technically spend one turn prior putting down a stealthed minion. By that logic, Spell Hunter with Jepetto is also not an OTK because you Jepetto one turn then use Maly + Alex next turn. Doesn't make much sense to be to use that logic since basically every OTK combo takes several turns to set up. I can be totally wrong though.
---
It's worth it to have a greater chance of outpacing your opponent's board clears. If you can get a turn when you get minions to stick on the board one time, you've probably already won. 
---
And not only are you getting 3 chances to discover the card you're looking for, you also get a good chance to discard low impact cards that don't work at mid-late game.
---
Totally is yes. I posted a quick video in a comment if you'd like to see.
---
Going from memory Bomb Warrior and Control Warrior have switched placed on the rankings a few time already.
---
Are you a Diablo mobile dev?
---
So 1 in 20 is an accurate average. Who woulda guessed
---
there are situations where they can either discover or randomly get mirror entity
---
It actually is though. The psychology is counter intuitive but it is real. Logically, having a reward is strictly better than not having a reward. This, however, leads to people fearing missing out. Ben Brode spoke about this in some detail regarding daily login rewards. It doesn't matter that logically having the reward is better than not having the reward, it is more important the way it feels. Even though you are no worse off than you are now if you miss a reward it feels bad to miss it. This is a real psychological phonomenon and it can (and will) drive players away.

It's very smooth but not perfect. Occasionally the screen will detect a single tap as a double tap, or have a delay. The issues occur because android OS is being read directly from the SD card not internal memory, and SD cards were never intended to be used as an OS. Higher performing cards would be better, mine was quite cheap.

In my experience of playing this deck, mountain giant wasn’t worth sacrificing early game so I took it out, and the spell pool for Tortollan didn’t seem to hold the deck back much.

better explosive trap

Ouch, even the country that mostly just copy pasta shit can't stand blizz's incompetency and make their own tournament mode.

the problem with control warrior is half the time it barely even feels like a control deck because they’re playing 1 mana 1/3s and 2/2 taunt discovers and then endless mechs with rush once they get boom. But then if they ever do fall far behind on board they just brawl/shield slam/warpath/omega devestator
---
These days Lord Jaraxxus more than anything feels like a card from beta or something that slipped through the cracks and somehow ended up in modern Hearthstone.
---
It is so absolutely inconsistent and unintuitive with everything else in the game.
---
NICE!
---
24 packs per legendary is better than I average, I believe.
---
It’s autopilot because they can’t make any creative plays. Yes, every deck is autopilot to a certain extent, but control warrior CANNOT make plays that could be considered unique or innovative, because their cards are nearly all removal. Aggro decks can outsmart a player by making creative plays, or by using cards for something other than their intended purpose. I can’t think of any unique plays someone could make with control warrior cards. That’s why it’s autopilot and one of the dullest decks to play, and play against.
---
I’ll be the first to admit me saying Tier 1 is confirmation bias mixed in with a lot of piloting. Realistically it hovers between 2 and 3 unnerffed. 
---
With that out of the way. Idk 20% of all games hit 8 at best? I know the meta is fast. My initial point is questioning the Raza nerf in the first place as I think the deck never becomes as oppressive as they claimed it would due to mostly Baku but Genn too.
---
I never play that format because I don't have any motivation for it. A new hero is more than enough motivation to move over from Wild for 10 games.

Top 2 decks are mage right now. If you go by their meta report it beats Murloc Paladin by a whole 0.1% win percentage.
---
Yes, very happy indeed. As a free to play player I don't have any fully competitive decks. I can play a complete mid-range hunter, but that's it. I get eaten alive by mages and warriors playing mid-range. I couldn't get into the top ten ranks in RoS (well once I did but that was luck), reason was a full contingent of warriors waiting on rank 11 for me. One time I met 11 warriors in 11 consecutive matches, all with the full control package - very frustrating.
---
With SoU coming out I had my hopes down. Got a priest quest which is unplayable since I lack all legendary priest cards and most neutrals.

the hardest part by far is being able to play zephrys on an empty board with exactly 2 mana
---
Step 5: Realize that not everybody plays Control Warrior and lose to every aggro deck.

There was nothing wrong with it. It’s more likely people didn’t realise that what he said wasn’t the actual spelling of zephyrus

Lol it was made so much more wholesome by the “hero I don’t merit” comment. Nice to see some compassion in the harsh world of “Well Played” and “Greetings”

Holy shit, is anyone else having massive bad luck like me? I've played countless matches so far and have only won a *single* one because my opponents just consistently get better RNG.  
---
I'm constantly left waiting for something useful, which never comes while my opponents keep filling the board with huge minions and combos. It's insane.
---
This is absolute gold
---
Imagine smashing your head on a brick while with thorns after your boss has fired you and your girlfriend left you.

You're welcome? As long as some people find enjoyment out of it, I don't think it's useless.
---
Yo, who put up that banner? That's so cool!
---
Then Dr Boom who summons bombs also should be a Mech. Enjoy the delivery drones my dudes =)
---
okay brilliant thanks a lot fella
---
Hes not in a mech suit in his original card, hes just Dr Boom
---
It's an alright deck. It was popular during the first few days of the meta, but people are obviously finding counters. Today, I wouldn't call it a particularly good metagame choice. 
---
The control warrior gameplan is what you'd expect: play cheap road bumps and removal to fend off aggro, keep gaining armor, and win with a neverending stream of rushy mechs. Some people are playing Elysianna for the mirror, just to gain an edge in the fatigue war.
---
I think people are hating on it because it doesn't have a very quick way to win, even if they've thoroughly gained board control + massive card advantage. They still need to go through the motions of finally drawing Dr Boom, generating overcosted mechs, and beat you to death with them. That can take many, many turns, especially if you're resisting.

Every card must be gold in your deck, golden whizbang is the cheapest/easiest way to do so.
---
I sent it

Yes, the reason being that my budget is exhausted right now and the next mass opening will take me from 1xxx to 2xxx much faster than I would go from 950 to 1xxx using just in-game earnings.
---
No, a pack is worth 100 dust. Value, "not extra dust you get".  Not being patient and disenchanting aggressively causes you to have less dust  and a smaller collection in the long run. This results in not being able to have options to make different decks. 
---
Another problem with your math is that a "decent deck requires 5k dust". This very much depends on your current collection. Do you have no cards that a deck is costing you 5k? Oh you probably don't because you disenchanted everything to build a deck in the first week of the expansion. Anyone can tell you that's a bad idea. The meta is not stable at the beginning of an expansion. It's wise to wait a while to craft, so you don't end up buildings hype deck that later ends up having an average win rate. That's on you mate.
---
Sorry my bad. Blastmaster Boom*
---
Touche :)
---
Nothing counters it
---
Without MC Tech, it'll take the rogue 11 turns to get through the armor (140 damage each turn, or 6 turns if attacking for 140 each turn). With MCT, the board is clear and the rogue is at 10, so the druid can win by hero-powering 10 turns in a row.
---
I just started playing the expansion yesterday and every time I go up against zepherryus it’s either Tirion or twisting nether. Nothing else
---
Mad cuz no collection hehe xd. 
---
I can tell you I enjoy very much having the 3 highlander decks with 10+ legendary in them ;D
---
I'm in the us if that changes anything

It's not that people don't like these decks, it's that people want to play another thing that isn't either super aggro or control warrior
---
Swapped to quest paladin to play on ladder. At rank 4 I face 3 warriors to every 1-2 non-warriors. I'd still be climbing if I conceded to every non-warrior it feels like. 
---
Its hilarious watching warriors try snd dig up enough removal to kill three mechano eggs and what comes out every other turn.
---
Aluneth is a deathwish if you don't have a very aggressive deck. You need to kill people before late game, most likely at around turn 10-11.
---
Omega devastator is a goblin inside a mech suit, which is exactly the description of the 2 new Dr Boom we got in Boomsday project. So I agree they should be mechs and EMP should kill them.
---
Emp operative?
---
There’s a lot of salt from F2P players crying because they don’t get to win every time.  Lol
---
I'm gonna need a rage thread, and soon

Knife juggler has been a staple in cheap zoo decks since the beginning of Hearthstone. Currently, afaik only *meta* deck that uses them is **zoo warlock**, but it also workes in cheap minion decks as some **tempo rogue**. Some people run juggler as a placeholders for missing core cards in  **murlock shaman**, **token druid** or even **murlock paladin** - might want to add it there if you have a slot or two.
---
I suggest you check the card (on HSReplay)[https://hsreplay.net/cards/1073/knife-juggler#tab=recommended-decks&amp;page=2] to see what decks it suits in and how well they perform.
---
Rogre That.

---
Tbh I don’t want omega devastator to be nerfed. I think the card is fine and dr boom is the only reason it’s so powerful and oppressive
---
Okay here me out: what about instead of losing the game directly you would just lose the dr. boom hero power and the mech rush thing when e.m.p. operative is played. So basically going back to your standard hero? This way you may get to use the hero power for some turns until your opponent has drawn the counter. Maybe je will keep the operative in his mulligan thus gimping his first plays? Jaraxxus and sac pac could be changed the same way?
---
Mad coz poor
---
It's just the way the Chinese want to do business.
---
And blizzard is going to happily follow along. The consumer market there is massive....they want that market and will do anything for it
---
Did you go into casual? The ranked ladder should start you at a rank where that cannot happen.
---
&gt; I said I played control decks, never said warrior lol. 
---
Sorry, my bad. Don't mind my projection.
---
Unless... it is a control warrior...
---
Anyhow, conspiracies aside, using up your whole turn timer is a legal part of the game. If this was an exploit, it'd be 100% on your side. However, if they choose to use their whole time, whether or not you perceive it to be in trollish sort of way or not, so be it.
---
With all due respect to you, in my opinion this is more of a "you" problem than a "them" problem and less about defending the practice. So long as it's a legal part of the game, it should be defended.
---
You face Jaraxxus, Unplayable card from the beta version.
---
its a double whammy. not only do you not have the powerful cards, but you are also too inexperienced to use what you do have optimally.
---
i feel for the new chum in the water.
---
His suit is. E.M.P. should destroy the hero power.
---
Rat.
---
Nice.
---
Lol most people on here are not poor, they just arent fucked retards that spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a shit game. 
---
So please befors you call people poor, ask yourself IF you are mentally sane
---
for real, even in the brawliseum it was easy to see which people were playing control warrior because it had a high winrate and which actually knew how to run the deck; teching a few cards to deal with matchups changes everything and simply not allowing the paladin to establish a board at least makes the game go from a 20/80 to a 40/60. it's amazing when playing the paladin deck how many warriors let the board get wide as if baiting for a bigger brawl matters
---
Okay, how about this for a compromise. EMP Op destroys the suit and replaced the enemy hero with just a goblin Dr. Boom. With a hero power, oh I don't know, deal 2 damage.
---
I really think Blizzard abandoned that kind of logic. I mean Omega devastador isnt suposed to be a mech (according to reddit, personally i dunno about this).
---
No, I mean it destroys the highlander cards. I run secrets with subject 9
---
The amount of mirror mage matches last night should be illegal
---
There's always some amount of setting up done, right? What's an example of one that happens all in one turn?
---
I am not basing my recommendation for a ladder deck on anecdotal experience, and you should not assume that I do. Winrate alone does not make for a good ladder choice, among other things there's game time to take into account too.
---
For example (using your hsreplay source), with a win rate of 61.4% and an average game duration of 14.6 minutes, a player can expect the climb from (say) 25 to 5 with Control Warrior to take about 34-35 hours. Were we to instead pick Murlock Paladin, a weaker deck at 58.2% but with a shorter average game duration of 6.3 minutes, the same climb takes about 19 hours.
---
Yeah the times I’ve won the matchup has been through having silences and also being prepared to pop all the eggs for the next turn even if it means taking an extra 8
---
Hmmm guess OP used an older account then.
---
Sounds like a good system, although i know that at R 19 i shouldnt be playing full meta decks either, but still i am.
---
So i'll be paraphrasing but basically  you really don't have many cheap spells to test for counter spell.  The only time you wouldn't hard play LPG into CS is if you have coin or ray of frost or run some other cheap spell.  Typically you'll have your cheapest spell as maybe a frost nova in your hand if you're running the more popular lists. It's not worth wasting a spell and a turn to play a galaxy a turn later as your'e putting yourself further behind spending 2 turns dong nothing instead of 1.  Just take the risk.
---
Yeah, I'm aware, but just wondering is all.
---
So that should mean people playing rogues had a pretty good run then?
---
i wanted to throw this package into tempo rogue so you wouldn't autolose against warrior but didn't pull anka (plus there were better legendaries to craft) but ah well

I always knew tirion was the perfect card.
---
I would prefer something else tho than a 5th tirion. Maybe ysera next time Zephyris bro?
---
“New”
---
But still, it’s CC, RNG-driven Mage. 
---
Low decision making, high dice rolls. It’s unfortunate for Mage enthusiasts that no amount of deck creativity matters since CC summon combos is all that any deck really comes down to.
---
It’s basically the Inner Fire/Divine of Mage.
---
Running Barista without Omega Agent in a Control-ish Warlock is a crime against humanity.
---
Control Chad vs. Beta Zoo
---
So the minion replaces your hero, and its still a minion, correct?
---
Any good? I don't want to craft Anka just yet as I'm near pity timer. But I'm so bored of agro rogue.
---
It seems like a otk deck should be good in current control meta.
---
Zilliax
---
With the amount of mechs seeing play right now, it would be autoinclude. Kill Zilliax and autowin vs Warrior? I see this as an absolute win.
---
No, it should kill Mecha Jaraxxus
---
Yes, you shouldn't, but it's simply no problem if you're forced to.
---
Jaraxxus is not a hero card and shouldn't be.
---
No, I don't.
---
Actually, forget the hearthstone
---
Highlander is one of the best decks rn.
---
What makes his suit a mech, but not the full body armour worn by Silverhand Knight?
---
If you want to go down this route, then we need a LOT of explanation for how their world functions.
---
It's cropped wrong
---
Zillax fits in a lot of decks and is a better tool against agro.
---
Yeah he can clear the board better than Reno, and he does other things too.
---
We lack elemental synergy on standard. Mechs on the other side...
---
The cheaper one.
---
How many games have been played with each of those decks? Probably not a large enough sample size to matter depending on which version of which deck you're looking at when it comes to HSreplay. Control warrior had a high winrate prior to this expansion and has just continued that trend.
---
Its not potentially infinite because there's a time limit. It's potentially infinite if your rounds last forever?
---
How about my potential infinite damage, play murloc tinyfin on round one. If i get another turn every time my turn ends it's potentially infinite damage too!
---
You need these specific cards in hand, empty deck and no extra cards (and no monions with summoning deathrattles or more than 10 hp):
---
Mechathun, reckless experimenter, coffin crasher,  ticking abomination x2
---
Play experimenter for 5
---
Play coffin crasher, reduced to 3 mana cost
---
Play both abominations reduced to 1 mana each.
---
End turn
---
Coffin crasher dies, (this deathrattle happens first cuz it was played first)
---
Its deathrattle summons mechathun from you hand, which is now empty.
---
Both abominations die, whose deathrattles kills all of your minions.
---
Mechathun's deathrattle sees empty board, hand and deck, killing the opponent.
---
It's very unlikely. Partly because it's unlikely to be good.
---

---
ZheSyphilis
---
Blizzard has done nothing except releasing reprinted cards every 4 months.
---
The main problem would be Priest's Plague AOE since it's a silencing twisting nether. I usually win control match ups as soon as it's turn 10 (weakness is probably aggro, with the wrong hand I can auto-lose)
---
that isn't another salty complaint post
---
No time at all? How many hours do you have in the game? and just because it takes x amount of time you think you should get no reward for getting to lvl 60?
---
Been playing MTG for less than a year and I've bought the Starter Bundle and feel like I have so many cards and can experiment with builds.
---
I feel more invested and may buy packs in the next expansion, Hearthstone which I've played much longer I have no feeling to buy packs due to my pack of cards.
---
When you have no cards there's no "ill open a pack hoping I get 1 card I need to make a build" because whenever I search up a build I need like all 30 cards.
---
My theory is that their goal is to kill Hearthstone esports the same way they killed HotS esports. However, they are first dropping the viewership down to zero by keeping CW as the best deck in the game, so then they can say some shit like "well, no one was watching it anyway, so we have decided to focus our esports efforts into other divisions."
---
That would totally be something that Blizzard does.
---
Raid the Sky Temple is pretty safe disenchant. It basically downgrades your hero power.
---
That's not in the classic or basic set
---
A common thing designers will point out is the general player population is good at finding a problem but not necessarily at finding a solution.
---
 
---
&gt;Jaraxxus... lowkey OP in any control meta? 
---
What year are you living in?
---
Zephyrhills
---
What's a Monk?
---
Sure it is, but not 7 mana with no other effect broken. Dr. Boom would be really, really bad without his Hero Powers. Even if we say that the permanent Rush and Hero Powers are roughly on the same power level (and I'd argue that Hero Power is stronger, especially since Rush part would be weaker without 3x 1/1's and discovering extra Mechs), removing Hero Powers would cut the card's power level in half. There's no way it would be broken after that. Cards are often dead after you remove 1 or 2 stat points from them, or add 1-2 to mana cost, and that's not cutting their power level in half.
---
Remember that Luna's Pocket Galaxy, which has turned every minion in your deck to 1 mana, didn't see play at 7 mana. And if I had to pick, I think that the effect is way more powerful.
---
You said it best... Its hard for new players to get into or possibly even harder to ask friends or tell them ita a great game to play. 
---
You felt like you got a great value? Lets be real for a minute. You paided what $50-80 to get maybe 1/3 to maybe 1/2 of all the new cards? If its $80 the that's basically ($20) more than a 4 month WoW subscription (not counting buying the game because that's once every 2 years) and you get access to the whole game. 
---
It would be much different if the grind was more realistic because 3 wins for 10g and the daily quest is maybe a pack a day if you play a decent amount. 
---
I know they've controlled the market for a long time and I feel they can just get more players if the price point was more accessible.
---
I'm down for that shit
---
Imagine being this salty at being defeated in a virtual card game
---
&gt;No one's serious about this on the end of instantly killing boom
---
OP is serious... just read his comments.
---
Druid quest sucks, don't know what you are smoking.
---
I love this
---
all quests are hot garbage
---
That's because control warrior is the only thing keeping those aggro decks that beat quest paladin and the like in check.
---
Damn, does losing in a virtual card game make you feel this insecure?
---
I was kinda going for a more naive KT than doesn't know about the Os and how... taxing they can be. But I like the "goodbye" one!
---
Ah, again I don't keep up and just know at least one is on mobile.  I think TFT is more Twitch competition than player competition, especially since (imo) Magic Arena is really difficult to follow just watching, even knowing how to play MTG.
---
To be completely honest, I forgot this card even got released.
---
Nope, it's pronounced "Bangladesh Cricketmatch"
---
No, your campaign corresponds to your overwhelming salt and anger.
---
On quest screen, yeah ranked wins. I would ask about total games but blizzard doesn't think stats are fun so they didn't put it in hs.
---
Thanks, usually people play a lot and then slowly fall out/get bored this is why your situation catched my attention. Yeah no end rewards for 60lvl sorry. At 500 wins with a class you will get golden hero portrait if you care about it.
---
Again, I'd Rez Priest and token Druid.
---
Druid - keep spamming the board with 1/1s until you can buff it. Not that much thought or creativity around it, just spam the board.
---
Priest - you can throw any minion on the board because it'll be rezzed and Inner Fire'd anyways, so not that much thought needs to go into what your putting out there.
---
I wouldn't go as far to say even a majority of Warrior cards are removal. Out of interest I just counted, out of the 74 Warrior cards in Standard, 24 are for removal. And that's being generous and counting Rush cards towards that. That's not even close to half the cards so you can't say they're nearly all removal when only 1/4 of them are.
---
What makes these decks more dull to play against more than Warrior to me is there isn't anything you can do about an OTK from a Priest, and unless you get the perfect draw there isn't much you can do to counter a Token Druid's filling the board every turn. You CAN counter a control warrior because they need to build up their board and if you're against a bomb warrior you can make an anti-fatique deck and then their bombs are so scattered it breaks the strategy. You can have an opinion that control warrior is dull to play against, I'm not saying you can't have an opinion. I'm just saying maybe don't act in the need to personally insult players who plays decks you don't happen to like.
---
And Hearthstone is said to be antisocial game
---
Shyvana, baleful banker
---
Such an odd choice, even like 1 Classic Pack could be an incentive for players to try new classes and to just feel like unlocked all the rewards rather than nothing.
---
and 9 packs isnt enough to stop someone buying packs right?
---
My quest rogue deck hasn’t lost to one yet. Feels like a pretty easy match up to me too.
---
That makes sense although you gotta admit defile is an extraordinary control tool and card in general.
---
Go back to Instagram kid 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Am I stupid? I still don’t get it lol

The first thing is to get one class to level 20 to unlock Tavern Brawl so that you can start getting weekly packs from it.

[[Conjurer’s Calling]]

some ppl n this sub feel that ppl who crtitcize hs don't love the game anymore and hence should move on to a different game I have got that reply many times myself. this message is to those ppl ..... we don't hate game infect we love it its just that we are not happy with the direction hs is taking its too costly a game ryt now(I have almost all the cards in my main account) but when I started an f2p account in a different server I understood how difficult its for f2p players to start the game that's gonna be a discouraging factor for newer players to incest in the game . Secondly there competitive scene is also a mess now which shouldn't be the case as a healthy competitive scene means more pros promote the game and more the promotion better the game goes. thirdly I feel this is sort of my personal opinion there no newness factor in hs for a long time for instance when angora came out ,or soft came out the came had so much fresh new ideas some may have backfired in the long run but still I feel it was better for the game now they are just adding old mechanics, old cards .I am a priest main and the best priest deck is a divine ,inner priest an archetype since beta(if I am not wrong). I feel hs can be so much more if the devs just a give a lit attention to these criticism.

then they could have that the current armor is gone, health cut to half and hero power changes into gain 3 armor, summon 1 1/1 tech and discover mech (that costs at max of 2 or 4 mana), deal 1 damage. changes per turn. and the picture changes into dr boom the card.
---
True, but it almost requires you to run either fiendish circle or rafaam’s scheme, which are really bad cards and dilute your deck considerably.
---
I edited the p.s.
---
But wait there is one where the average game time is 13.7 minutes. Must be some stupidly aggro control warrior
---
You could probably put it in quest rogue in place of tess + scheme as your win condition if you feel like it’s more reliable. Probably run myras as well. I don’t think you could fit it in as a secondary win condition though.
---
Ofc boom is broken it was made to fight cards like jaina and op beefed up rexxar
---
Ok I did not want to get involved in this but I am curious what your age is compared to his? (Although technically both of you could lie but I'm hoping that you both answer truthfully in the spirit of the argument)
---
When you look at Rogue or Paladin cards it really does not feel like they built those decks with the HoFs in mind.
---
Rogue's still paying the prep tax for example.
---
thanks man, I thought for a second I am crazy and illogical.
---
I thought it was funny. Nice job!
---
The card cost 6. 9/9 of stats is not that much to deal with at turn 6+. It reminds me of deathrattle hunter were the easiest way to beat them was to kill the egg and pop 5/5 so all their deathrattle activator card became useless.
---
genius
---
Not stupid, just under 35...
---
I think that if you’re not consistently making it to turn ten it’s not an auto include. And even if it is, every class has auto includes. Like when’s the last time you’ve seen a priest without cleric, or a rogue without backstab? Vilespine saw play in every rogue deck from the day it was printed. If boom wasn’t a card then  devastator would still be strong but it wouldn’t be obnoxious because people would be able to kill you before using the effect. And honestly I don’t think being able to play it as a yeti against Aggro makes it decent against Aggro, I think playing a yeti against Aggro is only decent when you have all the removal and stall in the world to back it up.
---
So zilliax then.
---
No problem.
---
All this talk, but still everyone forgets my boy Majordomo?
---
There are literally decks built around giving majordomo to your opponent lol.
---
Yeah but he's a real handful.
---
Have stopped playing hs few months ago just being bored playing against warrior, which usually meant losing. True.
---
Pretty much proves the post to be an empty threat.  Game is still trucking along.  “It earns plenty of money already, stop the greed.”  Lol, does the person who wrote this post have a job?  They sell digital card packs not medicine to kids with malaria.  If I told someone negotiating for a higher salary to “stop the greed” I’d be an idiot.  Big surprise that Blizz employees and shareholders want a return on their investment of time and money.
---
I too am curious in the spirit of the argument.
---
Arena is really all that I play. It has RNG imperfections but not nearly as much as Constructed.
---
The power level is generally right around where Hearthstone does well. 
---
The beauty of deck building is the home brew decks, finding new ways to build on card synergies and create decks that are fun and powerful. That’s not what Ladder is unfortunately, just heavily refined, near-automated decks, where websites play the game for you.
---
Arena is not perfect but generally speaking, the more skillful player will win in Arena. Not always, but more so than in Constructed.
---
With Netdecking, Mulligan guides, piloting guides, I am not sure if being the more skillful player even matters in Constructed.
---
I totally agree, outside of old Highlander priest it's been just variations of the same deck. Honestly that was my favorite deck I've ever played in hearthstone
---
Imagine how good a deathrattle rogue deck would be if cube was still in standard
---
I know that Elysiana doesn't synergize with Zephrys or Reno, but I think I can play them before I drop the Elysiana
---
I too watched that South Park episode.
---
I’d say hex lord malacrasa only ever really gives you a lot of value in rare occasions
---
Bauble#2990 EU 80g Quest, You Go First!
---
I believe the warrior ones are all offered more than the neutral ones but the same as each other, which says something about Zilliax being so high
---
I appreciate that you're playing a unique deck and having fun with it, but it's so obnoxious when people with zero statistics make a deck post and claim they are "favored" against 90% of the meta. Like come on man. That would suggest that this is a tier 1 deck. Do you believe this is a tier 1 deck? It sure doesn't look like one to me, but maybe you'll prove me wrong and this will start to take over the meta. Sure would be interesting to see
---
Ohohoho is a wild resurrect priest missing here?
---
They have a little power here. 😁 r/mademesmile
---
Best to assume that reruns don't count.
---
It's awful, everything's upside down and it's harder to tell what you're doing. That's why all those top-side players who add you after games are always so angry and frustrated.
---
Malacrass needs you to mulligan for legendaries, which really hurts your early game. Plus, finding the time to play a 8/5/5 is really hard.
---
He doesnt need the full value from his mummy if you get crap value from a card because it's Goldshire Footman.
---

---
I said that as the 2nd to last sentence of my post. I don't want to sound rude, but what? Why do you attack people on the internet? Keep your head up and smile, my friend. There are people who care about you.
---
The card itself isn't high value, its below average, but for a 1 drop its okay. Also it protects the important minions, like a brazen zealot. It mitigates their turn 4 play, and I think its good overall value for that
---
Nothing will change. I bet Blizzard will let the game die before making changes to the way its monetized. At some point the game becomes non-profitable anymore and that's it.
---
I'll find that decklist and see what he did with it. Seems pretty synergistic in a taunt warrior deck anyway
---
Still bad because it has no healing, taunts, board clear, or any real survivability.
---
I hate how they have doubled class legendaries as well as reducing the amount of legendary cards you get on expansion day to 1 instead of 2. (I believe a year ago the whole double class legendaries per expansion meant that they were "generous" enough to give us 2)
---
Honestly hs can go get fucked.
---

---
Players who don’t have HSpremium prefer going over to VS, yes. And just because the number of active contributors is lower doesn’t make it any less accurate. The numbers may be off by a small margin, but I’ve found VS to be very accurate at predicting deck performances throughout the expansions. 
---
I think if you’re looking just for raw stat numbers then HSpremium would be better, but if you’re looking for something more than that including interpretations of said stats VS takes the cake easily.
---
Speaking strictly as somebody who plays mostly warrior, CC is dogshit right now. Between my preexisting board clear, the plague card, and whatever that reborn rush minion is, I haven't lost to a CC mage since the expansion dropped. That said, LPG is basically a nonfactor because they can play as many 1-costs as they want, I can just remove them. 
---
Cyclone Mage on the other hand...still pretty goddamn strong. 
---
I guess the point of my comment though is that while Dr. Boom is admittedly a really strong card if you can play it on curve without sacrificing tempo, I kind of disagree with the idea that it's this insane-o instawin anti-fun powerhouse. You really only hear that from people who get rolled by it. 
---
I don't know where people are getting their statistics, but suffice it to say that I played Bomb Warrior up to rank 2 last season and I don't think my win rate against all classes was more than 55%. Against some classes, it was probably 15-20%. The nature of the game is that some decks are more powerful than others. I shitted on warlocks and druids; mages shitted on me. This season, I expect to be shitted on by combo priests. Plus ca change. If you're having that much trouble with Dr. Boom, consider your strategy and maybe reorient yourself towards late game value generation. I always had problems with Shamans and Paladins, and that doesn't seem like it's going to change this season. Something to consider. You don't need to quit, just experiment a little. We're all readjusting right now, and the expansion has been out for a week. It's going to take some time and experimentation before anything dominant emerges, and I'm sure that something will come out that shits all over Dr. Boom before too long.
---
I’m saying that when Jaraxxus came out there was no minion-hand interaction cards, when I thought there was only one. So my point is even more true, Jaraxxus was not designed with hand-interactions in mind.
---
Maybe stop shilling for blizzard by using the "what about" argument fallacy

---
I'd argue to keep  Malacrass, and drop baleful.  
---
A lot of people argue you need to fish for legendaries or whatnot in opening hand, and this honestly isn't true.  A lot of opening hands can be very helpful to duplicate later on.  
---
Just my opinion as a fellow Highlander mage.

Honestly, even if it pulls out crap, it's well worth its cost.  It doesn't even have to be a win con to ruin the other player too, I've pulled Omega Destroyers and Tortollan Pilgrims to just screw the opponent off enough to tilt them.  Which is great.

You're right, it has been. You have no idea how card sets are designed.

---
T H U N C C
---
I wouldn’t say draw dependent, as al you have to do is burn your deck and control warrior likely won’t be able to aggro you down before that happens. Once it’s the end of the deck it’s nearly impossible to survive the magic damage
---
Idk, I had flappy bird into triple master of disguise until I could finally get windfury. That was pretty disgusting.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
It only does that when you type it wrong.
---
Unnecessary. At least pick a couple.
---
Malacross seems bad. You want to keep Luna in a lot of situations and duplicating LPG is pointless.
---
It was in handlock very, very early on, but that was quite a while ago.
---
Yeah, there was a couple games where tirion won me control warrior matches since i was able to get 15 face damage in (currently playing a fun zephyr rogue deck)
---
How do you not havea . shot vs Control Warrior? The matchups seems favored
---
With the bucket system, all 3 cards should be roughly at the same level.  So picking the second best shouldn't really be tanking your deck.
---
Sounds like you should just play another game.
---
Didn't matter if it's in your deck. Baku and Genn read "Start of game [...]" Do this. That's before cards are drawn even though the effect happens after the mulligan
---
If play anything that can beat warrior, you will lose to the thirty aggro decks that litter the game. Warrior is not the problem.
---
Well, I mean, I only ever really play Warrior so my mirror matches are always going to be kind of boring. I actually did enjoy my bomb warrior mirror matches because I like the chess game of resource management, restraint, smart tempo plays etc. 
---
I think it's more important to ask whether I enjoy playing *as* a control warrior. It's my quality of life too. And the answer is that I don't. It's fucking boring and I hate it. But I do like winning. Control warrior is effective in the meta right now and I want to climb a little. 
---
If I had my way, I'd never have to play walls of fat taunt minions and jihad rush minions at the enemy's janky little zoo boards. I love playing thief rogue because I get to do fun combos and get spells and minions from other classes hat I would normally never get a chance to play. I just don't have the cards or dust for it, or the experience to pilot it effectively. I have all the Warrior cards, and also like 2500 warrior wins. Not playing control warrior would be nuts.
---
I do. Didn't you read my post? I want to play HS, but play other games instead because tehy offer a more reliable time frame.
---
Crafting quest druid that early was a mistake. The deck doesn't seem like it will end up being very good.
---
Jaraxxus was played as a last resort/quick way to end the game, boom is just played as a 7 drop
---
When the joke flies over you.
---
Turn 2 Zephrys into Brightwing into random legendary is pretty good tempo for arena, where card draw/generation is at a premium.
---
This so much, when RoS came out, worlds happened and People who brought more experimental decks got shredded.
---
For example, Ike’s heal token Druid
---
Does it kill Mecha jaraxxus?
---
If you've been around a while and experienced different metas, then it's pretty funny seeing that warrior is on top right now. I don't remember people complaining about him since that 1 mana 1/2 that gets +2 attack when you have a weapon equipped combined with unnerfed patches.
---
It's fun, but not really any better than finishing it on turn 4 with two mana to spare.
---
Leeroy does pretty well in the deck just for finishing power especially with the 3/2 weapon so you have 9 burst instead of just 6 usually
---
Hearthstone is not meant to have a reliable time frame. People should be able to think their turns through. If you're looking for that time frame, you need to be looking elsewhere.
---
No one cares. 
---
Even less when it's in Wild.

Ok it should destroy his suit and leave a shitty 7 health boom with no hero power left

Mindcontrol isnt an enchantment. Enchantments can be silenced, mindcontrol is a permanent change. TN being offered for two minions just be a case of other board clears would have saved you and you were too low on hp. There is alot of factors to the algorithm with out knowing, your hp number of cards left in your deck number of cards in your opponents hand, ect. Its hard to say what the algorithm is doing. https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Zephrys_the_Great the notes goes over all the factors of the algorithm. But it does see that tirion is on the opponents side of the board not yours mindcontrol permanently changes the minions side and cant be silenced.

If only Warrior wins were rare...
---
This is what peak hearthstone looks like.
---
That Zilliax is so good that even though he appears less than warrior class cards, its pickrate is on par eith the best of them..
---
This expansion is when it hit me.
---
I started a week before the first Tavern Brawl, before TGT. I opened Alexsztrasza in my first pack, the first golden shimmer. I spent some money then, and on subsequent expansions. I stopped doing that at the Standard/Wild split as I knew perfectly well what their actual goal was behind the corporate words.
---
But I kept playing, and dust accumulates. I could slowly work myself toward interesting decks, and play my versions of them. But I played less and less and would no longer have thousands of new dust when I hit "mass disenchant". In RoS I spent my dust on a cheap Bomb Warrior deck, without Zilliax and some epics.
---
Then comes SoU. My gold plus free packs gave me 26 packs to open. An awesome opening with 1 golden legendary, 1 legendary, 2 golden epics. But with the lack of dust and bad luck getting the cards I wanted I could not afford the Quest Priest deck I had looked forward to. I played some Burglar Rogue games. Wasn't that exciting. Then I played an old Wild deck. Then I logged out. New expansion release and I got bored after 5 games.
---
&gt; I think there are enough heal/restore cards available (Applebaum, Khartut) 
---
Which anyone else has access to, and more. That's the thing... You're trying to make a deck works with 2-3 tools, when the other decks of the same archetype have 10-15 tools, because they were designed to do it.
---
Can it work?
---
Well, can you use a screwdriver to hammer nails into concrete? Probably, if you're strong enough, the screwdriver is heavy enough, and you don't mind spending 10 times longer on the job, compared to using a hammer, the thing that was made to do exactly that.
---
That's pretty much what control rogue is. You might be able to make a few things work, and use neutral tools (that all other classes can use) to make up for the fact that rogue doesn't have these tools in its class cards (unlike the other more control-oriented classes), but in the end, you're using a screwdriver to do a job they designed the hammer for.
---
Even if it "works", it won't work as well as the hammer (warrior).
---
You know how you are old when you need to explain Highlander franchise to someone :(
---
Heresy.
---
The graphic says pickrate when it's offered. If it's not offered it's pickrate isn't affected.
---
Actually mindcontrol is an enchantment,
---
If you hover over a mine controlled minion it will list mindcontrol as an enchantment...
---
It might not behave like normal enchantments but never the less it is an enchantment,.
---
Oh, my bad. Missed that part of it.
---
heroe cards can't tribes os i think this will never be the case , before you say it , jaraxxus isn't a hero card , hes a hero minion
---
I think his conclusion was that there is no deck that can out-smorc Boom because their 1 drop and 4 drops are too good. So don't go with that plan.
---
That would also absolutely buttfuck everyone who takes a break from the game for an expansion or two, as they would have pretty much nothing to play, but still be stuck at the highest rank they ever hit.

The switch is great. Sure it’s not going to have the same touch screen as a 1k phone when it’s around $400 here.

Legend is the same no matter how you get it.   The reward is the same.
---
What's Highlander
---
only minions have tribe tags
---
For a warrior card it's 4/ 54  + 50/54 * (4/53 + 49/53 * 4 / 52).    
---
For a neutral just sub in the 1s. Om phone so cant do the math easily

---
Tbh, I first saw this and went oh, he drew himself to death lol. Then I realized you had actual lethal
---
So, i guess that the silent majority disagrees, since the game is still going...
---
I see this thread pop up. People lose to something shiny and believe its because they aren't spending money.
---
There are a couple of cheap decks which can climb ladder quite well. Despite highlander mage being the most expensive and most popular deck at high ranks, its outclassed by combo priest which uses 1 legendary and mostly classic cards.
---
That's just an example. There are plenty of other things can can get you to at least rank 5.
---
It's so they can emphasize different mechanics at different times by having certain rotations focused on the mechanics of different tribes it makes the meta different from rotation to rotation. If they had to emphasize all tribes equal all the time it would feel alot more samey,
---
I play to have fun, not to grind. I know when to stop myself to get out of burnout so SV is a good fit for me.
---
Also you don’t have to win all of the event parts, you still get something if you win 3/5 matches in the first half or whatever. The rewards are good enough and the largest increase in reward tiers happened between 0 and 1, meaning that you just need to try. But you can go crazy trying to get into the final *final* stage
---
I don’t really go hard on grinding in SV or HS. I tried other card games but none are as appealing to me and I really can’t figure out why. Gwent is generous too and the animated cards are so polished but I just don’t feel like going back to it like HS or SV.
---
About SV legendaries: I do agree that the high end decks are expensive - and I feel like it’s because most of the time you are running 3 of each legendary. Which is such a vial sink. It’s my biggest issue with the game but I’ve been able to get through it with the free card system (which has really helped me so far with experimenting without worry).
---
I understand how you feel and ultimately I think more games have a responsibility to protect the player from their own addictive personalities. The urge to be at the forefront of the meta and get every advantage possible can often ruin an otherwise perfect experience for most games these days.
---
Okay, I have to stop typing. I could talk about this forever. Thanks for entertaining this conversation without circlejerking! GL in whichever CCG ladder you’re climbing.
---
I feel like SoU has made the average Tier 1 deck a lot more expensive. 
---
The themes it tried to introduce aren't very good besides Highlander. None of the quests seem very high tier.
---
Meanwhile:
---
Midrange/Secret Hunter evolved into Highlander Hunter.
---
Conjurer Cyclone/Freeze Mage evolved into Highlander Mage
---
Warrior evolved into being able to run good taunts.
---
This is an expansion in the sense that it's Rise Of Shadows 2.0. The archaetypes it tried to introduce are currently quite weak.
---
Mech Hunter (previously the best deck at non-legend) got no upgrade and is still viable... unpopular since it got no upgrade.
---
In other words, I think SoU is great for people who have been playing the game for a while. Terrible for new players.
---
Mech hunter is a cheap deck and it’s one of the best around. Only legendary I see with them is zilliax, and he’s not even that important to the deck.
---
I do preorder expansions 3 times a year. Can I please have Complete My Deck for Wild now?
---
Make a new account, you will get plenty of packs to start off with
---
&gt;I've now found other amazing decks to play with
---
This is the real reason. By placing more or less focus on different mechanics of the game it forces variety into the meta. If they had to emphasize all mechanics equally it would lead to metas feeling very samey from rotation to rotation.
---
My notifications for sending emails is Knife Juggler

i dont necessarily worry about going against them just yet. ive reached 9 in wild with my hunter deck without a lot of effort or going up or down and im content with that so far.  I bought the ros and uldum expanisions and just make decks with whatever legends i get from those when i play standard. thanks for your advice.
---
Might consider using them in the future, thanks!
---
Agreeee
---
I don't get why they don't do like Elder Scrolls Legends does and release 10 "promo card" bundles where you get some unique cards to spruce up the meta a little bit.  I also really miss the adventures coming with new cards.
---
Then again, the number of times you are offered a warrior taunt but not zilliax is going to be much higher than the opposite, isn't it? Consider that those top cards are usually snap-picks when not competing with each other. Since getting zilliax by itself should be a lot rarer than getting one with a warrior taunt competitor, it gets a relative penalty to pick rate. Or perhaps it should be said that the warrior taunts get a relative bonus to their pick rates. You'd need to check what people picked when faced with a combination of these options in order to get a standardized picture. Zilliax staying at par with those other warrior taunts is actually pretty impressive.
