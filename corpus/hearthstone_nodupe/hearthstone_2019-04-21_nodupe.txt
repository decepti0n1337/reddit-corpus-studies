Token Druid is just the most relevant example. There's also Resurrect Priest, Mech Hunter, and Mech Paladin to name only three more.

Returning player from original set days. I'm trying to build up a deck that will let me compete. I have a few I was able to create but they dont feel effective. That, or I am just not a great player. Is it more beneficial to board clear in most cases or let them get some free damage in?
---
Sap+Prep nerf, Leeroy HoF pls.

Mad Bomber

Battle Cry: deal 3 damage randomly split between all other characters.

---
Flame Imp
---
Battle Cry: deal 3 damage to your hero.
---
The flame imp hurts your team. In contrast, the Mad Bomber can help take out enemies. Not the same card.
---
Its because bombers effect can hurt your enemy.

Do you have a replay?

If no, did you consider that the first Kalecgos may have itself been created by say Messenger Raven?

Thoughtful and Fatigue warrior, pick one. They're mutually exclusive.

Ohh. I see I hadn‚Äôt heard from her for a while nor seen a stream so I wasn‚Äôt quite sure - same with Ratsmah to tbh.
---
Probably because stuff he does for omnislash is through a contract or something, whereas this is just whatever stuff he feels like doing. Sometimes he has other stuff posted to his channel like "bat wisdom" or whatever as well, which wouldn't fall under omnislash but just whatever he wanted to do at the time.
---
And yet the win rate is mid tier......................
---
Again, playing a deck like fatigue and then complaining you can't just afk your way to a win 30m later because a card actually interacts with your stupid fuckin deck is adorable. Reap what you sow.
---
I think evolve on an onyxia
---
They will die at the end of next turn.
---
**But how about:**
---
Sticking a Betrug. 
---
Then next turn playing plot twist and [[dalaran librarian]]. Silencing 2 of the summoned big minions so they don't die. 
---
(Also possible in 1 turn with draw minions on board) (e.g acolite/loot hoarder)
---
Read through about 30 comments. Shocked how many heads this went right over haha.

---
None of the cards are gone you are just complaining about mana cost
---
Yes, just need to know how to play it
---
It sucks not being able to develop anything against rogue until it‚Äôs way too late. You can only watch all your stuff get killed/sapped as your opponent‚Äôs board gets bigger and you‚Äôre being hit constantly in the face. The class is just massively overpowered with too many options right now.
---
That's why they're gone
---
I mean to have all three of those cards in hand at 3 is an extremely small percentage. It would be better just to think of vancleef as an I win button if its a 6/6+ on turn 3.

You fuul you killed Gruul.

If that was the "plan" there's no reason to do it t1 rather than t2 and not take fatigue.
---
Then run an actual won condition that doesnt result in an hour long draw against one of the most popular decks. You have no one to blame but yourself
---
This is why I just don‚Äôt run tracking. Atthe very least I‚Äôll trade it out for flame trap. The damage to their board is more helpful and typically if you‚Äôre running midrange they don‚Äôt expect it and it will throw them for a turn on what deck you‚Äôre playing. Regardless it avoids this and I don‚Äôt see why burning two cards is so important in the deck anyways. Idk just me tho

everyone is having a blast against espionage rogues, because the deck sucks

Why did this post get so many upvotes? If anything, it deserves downvotes due to the inaccuracy of the question.

By watching a stream and not actually playing.

LE ZUBAT HAS ARRIVED
---
What do you mean by contingency? And is the combo 2x whirlwind, then 2x devastate? That isn't an otk. You mean whirlwind+devastate? That's only 5/10 damage to mecha'thun though. Please explain! Thank you
---
You‚Äôre getting the mulligan right but if you‚Äôre not facing aggro then Myra‚Äôs is also worth keeping.
---
You can play Deckhand on 1 if you think your opponent will have trouble dealing with it or if it looks like you‚Äôll need it on the board soon but your curve won‚Äôt allow you to play it the turn you‚Äôll need it.  These situations don‚Äôt happen that often in the current meta so you can also just hold onto it if you don‚Äôt want to think about it.
---
8 months ago when whizbang first came out i played 150 games with him on asia and couldn't get past rank 16. this month i've reached rank 15 after 65 games with a 38-27 record.  
---
none of the current decks feel as strong as the original control mage and control warlock but the only ones for me that feel bad to roll are secret paladin, imp warlock and pirate rogue because it's so easy for them to run out of steam.  
---
i'm surprised the shirvallah paladin deck has the second lowest winrate at 39%. i'm 4-1 with it and it feels like one of the stronger decks to me. i'm also 4-1 with the control mage deck and surprised that it's sitting at 48% winrate while the pirate rogue deck with no minions above 3hp and most of them overcosted somehow has 52%.  
---
imp warlock is the deck i've done the worst with (0-3) but i think that's partly due to poor mulligans. i've realised i should be mulliganing for only jumbo imp and sea giant.  
---
secret paladin i think i've also been approaching wrong after losing to a subject 9 secret paladin who played no cards until turn 3 where they combod secret + weapon and followed up with bellringer. pass turn 1, hero power turn 2 might be the correct way to play the deck.   
---
at least there's no deck as truly worthless as the original no win condition control shaman.
---
I will say they left a gaping hole in Paladin. I'm too sick of Mechs to play Mech Pally, and Secret Pally is very high roll and less interactive than aggro rogue. 
---
There's no control pally. The Duel version is more of a gimmick.
---
I think they should nerf elysiana to say "replace all cards in your deck except cards created by your opponent" so bombs, spiders and hakkar are viable counters.
---
Except it's not the same effect.....one can hit anything else, the other always hits your hero. Mislabeling shit. If an enemy plays a card that fills the board with 1/1s there is a good chance mad bomber will hit them. If you play the imp, there's a 100% chance he will hit your hero and not do shit to then.
---
lets not forget the memorable plot line and story, the bad guys, the twist, the rules of the game

God I'm sick of that shit.
---
You forget the Grandpa that ran the Exodia Necros deck. Nice try though
---
I'm not so sure about that. Thijs uses a whole lot of click ait and I don't think there's a single person who enjoys the game more than him
---
Fan of knives into backstab will never get old though
---
Warlock. I started the game with warlock. I reached first time rank 10 with warlock. Fast forward 2 years(1 whole year of absence) I reached legend with warlock. I feel like this class, especially the zoolock archetype is exactly what suits me.
---
Tbh though having a main class isn't that good. For example I paid so much attention and tryharded a lot to complete my warlock collection which resulted in not having good collections on some other classes like rogue, mage and a little bit on druid(however right now I have decent collections on all of them) so if warlock was bad or if I didn't like warlock's deck for w.e reason(I really didn't like control warlock of koft) then I had nothing to play, so I had to stop playing all together.
---
Can you just craft it
---
I dunno man
---
What did he say?
---
Sadly... I have been an avid player for many years and between netdeck meta web recipes that EVERYONE USES and scum web muscle replies such as the one you got, i haven‚Äôt been able to bring myself to do a daily in a few months.
---
I used to get excited and save coin, and buy expansions... that is gone now.
---
Sorry you came across an a-hole. Don‚Äôt let it stop from adding friends, there are some good people out there!
---
*READY FOR ACTION*
---
Don't care about trade, just need someone to fight against, add RAD#11320
---
IMO you bring this on yourself by opening like that. If it was me who just added you and you immediately send that to me I'm just going to think "well this guy is an arsehole" and any fun things I had to say would be forgotten and I'd probably just unfriend you.
---
Pulling things won't really affect them. Maybe if it's a pirate. The 3/8 eats a lot of stuff though so anything not leeroy or thug you put into play shouldn't be too bad
---
One problem is the lack of Combo decks. More Combo means less Control. Less Control means more Aggro. More Aggro means less Token Druid. Main reason you feel this though is due to Standard deck choice, not really strength of current "token" decks..
---
i'm watching a youtube vid of hers from literally the day before this was posted saying she was happy with the game and liked it : /
---
The point is that Khadgar isn't actually the problem here, Mountain Giant is. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this is the deck that is going to get Mountain Giant sent to the Hall of Fame.
---
Lackey or tempo rogue
---
Tracking is the best card in the deck. After you play Jepetto you can Tracking to get extra burn. It's basically like drawing the best card of the top 3 and throwing away the other two, which increases your chance of drawing good cards afterwards. And in that deck the other two cards aren't usually any good, since you only want burn after Joybuzz, and you have to have anti-aggro in the deck.
---
Also levels spellstone fully with just one card. Could you believe that some people didn't appreciate or understand the value of bomber? No wonder they won't give us new game-modes...
---
I just noticed the evil teddy
---
All those sweet sweet interweb points. I can see how you can sleep peacefully at night
---
Did u win?
---
...and who is Radiance *dropping* to replace them? 
---
The number of sponsored Hearthstone pros didn't change at all with this announcement.
---
I mean it just seems to be Hearthstone like it is a blackhole or maybe it is where all my bad luck goes I will stop playing for weeks at a time because of how incredibly unlucky I am. It has been going on for since the game started Hell when Naxx came out I paid for coaching coach determined I was unlucky pick a different game.I don't care if you don't believe me or think I have been recording it wrong not a day goes by when I play where I don't stop playing so I can make sure that card is actually in my deck because what are the odds Dr boom would be in my bottom 10 cards 14 games in a row.
---
Hell in multiple games my bottom 5 I mean he should be but I am dead so I am not sure anymore so I pull up m deck yep there is Dr boom right there
---
At this point I have just gotten zen about it I get my legendaries when the pity timer is up 97% of the time I will spend 12 hours bouncing between rank 11-14 or 6-9 it is going to happen and it is ok
---
I'm going to be sad if they nerf Prep.  They just had a chance to HoF it.  It's a really, REALLY fun card to play, so I'd much rather play it in Wild than not at all.
---
I‚Äôm expecting a circlejerk now. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm sick of all the jerking in this sub.
---
No I'm talking about getting physically erect when going for lethal.
---
Just having a reward system similar to gwents would be nice. Right now it blows ass.
---
Oh you won 3 games that took 90 minutes to play? Here is 10g...
---
Oh you hit rank 12 during the month, he is a gold common worth 40 dust and some pocket lint. 
---
Cmon, that is some dog shit. People need incentive. 
---
* 10g or 10 dust ( random ) each game PLAYED in ranked
---
* Daily reward cap ( 100g ) resets the same or now if you spend it, that amount is deducted from the daily cap
---
Say you play 15 games and 10 of those games gave gold. You are capped for the daily until the reset. If you use gold to buy an arena run or pack, daily reward counter goes back to 0. So you can earn for the rest of that day. Rinse repeat.

Murloc shaman is only not fun cause you don't have the murloc hero this is a must have and then just spam inconcivable all game
---
Do you even read what you write? Holy typos Batman!
---
Observe, the straw man in his natural habitat.
---
Take a look at his Twitter. He makes deliberately obtuse comments and tries to act a cocky asshole but then complains when people don't like him. 
---
His latest tweet about banning people randomly. He thinks he's on top of the world but he's just comes off as an insecure douche. His yes-men fanbase and his streamer friends only inflate his ego further. 
---
This is the just the tip of the iceberg for him, unfortunately.
---
I agree with the first comment and I agree with you too.

Mill Rogue in Wild or Golden Whizbang on my EU account.

It can be a hard to play since it can be slow some times since there is no early minions. getting the grizzly out there and reviving it several times with full health. Playing the card that draws a beast (the grizzly) with double health. When you have lucentbark you can copy it with faceless manipulator, summon a copy (or two) with gloop  sprayer, and playing a copy of it with Flobbinious Floop, when you hasve one (or better with several copies of it), you can use the many cards of healing to keep reviving it (them). And at the end, near fatigue, play Archivist to get an extra 10 cards! GLHF

One thing awesome about Toast is that he embraces the criticism instead of ignoring it or going mental.
---
The whole reason he abandoned his cardboard toast mask was because someone "unmasked" him once, and instead of going on with his schtick, he changed his public persona (to a degree).
---
Now, after being called out for clickbaiting, he embraced it with irony instead of shunning or ignoring - yet again.
---
Very nice touch.
---
glhf :)
---
CHEATING OUT SHIT
---
It's 20!
---
Just a factorial joke.
---
Actually it's turn 90, overall for both players.
---
Or 45 turns for each one of them.
---
the bad matchups are pretty much the same as a normal control warrior but the matchups against control decks are way better
---
i may be very wrong, but i think he has a dalaran shop where he makes toys and fun trinkets.
---
It would be a nice video niche.
---
 **effect**  is a bit  **different**
---
*pretends to be shocked*
---
Sac pac works on Jaraxxus, yes
---
Thanks :)
---
This is the kind of really slow control deck I like haha
---
Okay this is kind of an ignorant statement.  Bomber can also destroy your own board you developed not just your face. Far more versatile hence the mana cost.
---
Lol, calm down mate, it‚Äôs a card game üòÇ
---
What did he say
---
&gt; that Betrug summoned
---
This part of the title made it unreadable for me. The title already starts with "any minion summoned by betrug". It's unnecessary and confusing.
---
Discover doesnt ‚Äòdiscover‚Äô the same minion twice or three times. Masters call discovers 3 cards and then if they are all 3 beasts you get all of the discovered cards. But since only 1 Wyvern got discovered you only get that one.
---
What's safe guard doing there
---
Wish there was a way to see posts before they were edited
---
What does she do now then?
---
Its best MMO no matter how much they fucked it lately. WoW could be much better but devs are super disconnected with playerbase.
---
I can't tell if you're being satirical with that awful typing or what...
---
Which can make it frustrating for a european programmer to use something like the Windows calculator, which defaults to ,
---
Firebat is by far and away the best streamer when it comes down to talking about the game. He often explains his plays and talks aloud as to his options explaining why he concluded one option was better than the other.
---
Of course many do this, but he articulates it much better. He also doesn't get to jilted, often looking back on a game he lost be pin pointing where "he" misplayed and how he can do better next time to get a statistically better outcome
---
Play Tog, copy him as many times as possible with Togs scheme, pick the Wand treasure that lets you draw 3 cards, play more Togwaggles (now 0 mana), draw even more cards with Wand, and at some point, when you have enough Togwaggles in hand, pick the crown treasure and summon a lot of legendary minions. 
---
Won‚Äôt work very often but it‚Äòs a fun combo. Most of the time you just end up and picking the crown for legendary minions right away. (Still a strong play if you can prep the crown)
---
Odd because token barely saw any play
---
Chtun warrior was all over the place when wotog first hit. About a month later the deck was dead
---
Is this meant to be a joke or a suggestion?
---
You hope that having it in your collection gives you better RNG when using Dragon's Roar. As for putting it in a deck, I dunno, probably not a bad late game card to use in a homebrew deck with some chargers and taunts.
---
You might need to change it to "wild".
---
Because we can!
---
Oh, so u cant use it in this meta? Or with in this expansion?
---
Well murloc shamans powerspike is Underbelly Angler on turn 2 or 3 followed up with murloc spam the next turn. Zoolock has many 1 cost minions wich fill the curve so they can play on curve, for example Argent Squire turn 1, Knife Juggler turn 2 and then Doudling Imp or more 1 and 2 cost minions turn 3 (Voidwalker, Dire Wolf Alpha and/or Flame Imp for example).
---
Not in normal play. You can use it in wild decks which allows you to use any card of every expansion. The normal rotation only uses the most recent sets.
---
It's a correction to the actual state of the game. 9/10 faced Warlocks have this card in the opening hand.
---
Right, so it's a joke.
---
Um, a question:
---
Did you at any point feel like you could push to pressure instead of stalling, or were you just playing for a "tie"?
---
3dmg on your face, or 3 dmg at random.
---
Oh i see now lol, thanks!
---
would be really great if you looked up what test subject does
---
You forgot tb
---
The worst winrate is about 40%. That's not that bad.
---
Ah okay cool. I started playing during witchwood and didnt play v seriously until boomsday so i had no idea lol.
---
I accidentally queued into wild when i was new and got rekt by a cthun priest i was screaming lol. Now i know better xD
---
r/woooosh
---
Could you send me a code for the deck, pretty please?
---
Jade druid. You don't need Aya or Fandrel, just jade idol, auctioneer, ramp cards, and cycle cards. Aside from that, include lots of minions that will be removed from your deck, so by turn 2 you only have idols, ramp, and cycle.
---
Heal Druid is really scratching my itch as of late!
---
I don't know that the solution you propose is good, but I agree with the intent - the fact that the longest games are the ones that typically end in a tie kind of makes the whole thing a little pointless.
---
From my side I can say that muzzy's stream are really chill and can be used as a good reference of how you should play game but he doesn't stream often and sometimes only for like 2-3 hours.   
---
While being succesful player HS have really big time of "downtime" between big tournaments and so on. Even on those for each round there is like 1-2 matches streamed so it is impossible to promote your brand/team when you appear on stream for 1-2h once in a few months.
---
I mean he already is the ultimate predator... If anything this is a good thing, and i feel sorry for any poor soul he‚Äôs previously eaten alive.
---
&gt;Hearthstone esports has seen a steady decline since 2015 which has resulted in us devoting more resources to titles like M:tG recently.
---
How can I face you without seeing your face??
---
I mean, they‚Äôve had ‚Äúreal‚Äù competition for a long time. One of them just hit on the right formula to explosively grow a playerbase. Eternal was a way better pure digital game with less dumb rng and better single player, it just never took off and seemed to implode after they stopped being as generous with the free stuff. Artifact had so many things going for it, but the mechanics weren‚Äôt as robust and the way it catered to the whales was kinda nuts and it imploded. Either of those things could have been huge if they did things a bit differently. 
---
Arena is exploding because you can build a F2P burn deck, draft relatively cheaply, and otherwise just be a casual duffer and have fun with it. It appeals to lots of groups. It has the magic mechanics, which are relatively consistent as of the last decade. It has the magic characters which people seem to get hard on. It doesn‚Äôt hurt they chummed the water with a bunch of codes from physical products and lots of promotional money.
---
Rdu hasn't been too relevant in a while and only very very very recently has found success in streaming.
---
By a measure of at least making worlds AND streaming super consistently while doing it RECENTLY, only purple really passes the test. ShtanUdaci was also successful and competing a year ago, but has now moved onto Arena it seems.
---
I kinda like it - rotating sets every two months means that the meta's going to get refreshed faster.
---
Thanks so much, bomb war seem fun to play, just worry it will out meta in the future, kind of expensive control deck for me
---
The reason they do this is they want as little of the classic set to be viable as possible so players are forced to buy new cards rather than use cards they already have.
---
It's not even about incentive for me anymore. I'm just bored of the game. I think the game is in a good spot, and want to go back to wild but wild is an absolute shitshow. 
---
Wild used to be my favorite format before witchwood, and I played only wild for upwards of a year exclusively. I hit legend multiple times during that year because the format was incredibly fun and didnt feel broken. Now it seems you cant play a deck that doesnt kill your opponent on turn 4-6 and expect to win games. I'm more inclined for them to truly balance wild than create a new game mode that wont be anymore interesting than standard currently is. Maybe if they did what they are doing for arena in ranked, I'd enjoy it. Either way, standard is boring and wild is not enjoyable anymore.
---
Only Tyler has recently made worlds, and he did it while not streaming consistently.
---
Games ending in draw are stupid, period. None of the successful game  have their games ending in ties, look at LoL, fortnite,dota, apex legend
---
I‚Äôm consistently trying to make handlock work at rank 5. 50% win rate so far after around 50 matches, really good against token Druid, really bad against tempo rogue. Pretty good against zoolock, pretty bad against mech hunter. 50-50 against control warrior or bomb warrior.
---
tempo rogue
---
r/lostredditors
---
I'd be happy to, but I don't think I would be in the same timezone, so that may be an issue....
---
Ultimate control play. 
---
Not even the most non win condition deck can not lose against you if you chose to not win first. 
---
Brilliant.
---
I'll watch some videos soon
---
can someone explain to me why blizzard has this art in one of there games when they are trying to sue dota 2 for having a blue elf that has a bow...
---
Pfft, can you explain to me why other arts DON'T have Spongebob with a sword?
---
Blizzard: Firebat, please nerf
---
I would prefer if arena still would be truly wild. And had no bucket system whatsoever. If I would want to play ranked I would play ranked, I liked that anything could happen in arena.
---
Blizzard is just being racist, can‚Äôt tell the difference between a Goblin or Imp smh
---
Yeah but that's if you get lucky and pull the broken cards or combinations. What happens when you get an average deck? It feels exactly like  the arena in karazhan or gadgetzan where it wasn't really a matter of skill or anything. 
---
It was more like "how much of X do you have?"
---
 "If X greater than the amount of X owned by your opponent then win." That's why I'm complaining. In a standard arena you got more of a balanced outcome. Yes there are cards that are powerhouses but still balanced in the standard format. In wild these cards can be seen as significantly weaker or incredibly stronger just because of the wild combinations that exist.
---
tighten two 1/2 firewood pipes
---
If you say so.
---
So that is the untold secret that blizzard hides. Restore 5 health to wake up this server.
---
He seems to be playing in wild, he should switch to standard if he has almost no cards
---
If you're playing rogue I know why, EVIL miscreant coined out on turn 2 is win win every time in arena \^\^
---
Funny because for me flame imp is a 1 mana spell that pings my face for 3 to discard my opponents backstab. :)
---
Yup, that's in Trolden I believe. I saw some people even took a while to realize it, which is hilarious :&gt;
---
What esports even existed anymore? Every time I click the PlayHearthstone stream it's collegiate championships; I can't even remember the last time I saw pros in a tournament. What's the deal?
---
It‚Äôs not as bad as you‚Äôd think. You just need to either get lucky and bounce cards back into your hand or run scheme.
---
 &gt;it is the first free card(the previous ones were volcanosaur and marin the fox) released before expansion that sees this much play.
---
Hey! That Volcanosaur is pretty good with cannot be targeted adapt
---
But it makes him seem less credible and professional, a bad look for this type of video.
---
Vargoth is a really cool/fun card that's also competitive. Was definitely a great choice for the free legendary.
---
F
---
Maybe because it's the only (playable) legendary some people have? They probably got a meme legendary in their 10 packs lol
---
Wait what ? How? Teach me senpai
---
You do realize that the entire goal of every esport is to be an ad for that game, right? Like they literally want you to buy more packs because you had fun watching.
---
I think they are def interrelated but I think the reason they get such garbage in expac is because their classic tempo set is so good.
---
Dont forget about big priest.  The least fun deck to play against of all time
---
It wouldnt really make sense to give the good guys Lackeys. 
---
I actually think its pretty cool how they gave new mechanics to the baddies and the goodies
---
At least I can do very well in hard situations.
---
Seems you dont even know what OTK even is. Let me quote you "turn one OTKs" that would translate to: turn one one turn kill. See the problem? 
---
Aggro decks dont kill in one turn so they are not OTK decks. Otherwise you could argue control decks are OTK too because they are 20 turn OTK decks. Actually fuck this why am i replying to this stupid post.
---
2 mana without losing anything, and with warlock even an bonus card? What a bargain!
---
Well, you don‚Äôt know what they will discover from their hero power and omega assemblies.
---
Well, you don‚Äôt know what they will discover from their hero power and omega assemblies. It is not about what you know about your own deck.
---
Hunters, Mages, Druids and Paladins were the four classes designated as the Defenders of Dalaran. Twinspell was a mechanic for the Defenders. The five antagonists of the expansion were placed in the five other classes - the evil classes. They all have lackey generating cards which the first four classes lack.
---
It was a thematic decision to design the two separate groups of classes differently, to better reflect the story that they are trying to tell
---
What rank do you normally play at?
---
Got back down to legend with this deck blowing through bomb warriors dragon warriors token druids and tempo rogues. I finished out at 69%. I guess it just goes to show you that there's some skill and thought behind your moves to draw out your opponents removal.
---
NA: bridog#1893 for 80g trade
---
I can reach rank 10 with garbage deck.
---
I tried this in a few instances. [deathlord] drawing a minion from the deck and that minion being returned to hand has a correct discount. 
---
The free agent like in your case, wasn‚Äôt discounted. Confirming your findings. But, when I bounced him back a second time he kept his discount and replayed him, at the correct cost.
---
As a Token Druid player, this translation is pretty accurate
---
Tempo Rogue is stupid busted strong right now. Greenskin is a really strong card but the core tempo rogue package is so strong you can probably get by without any legendaries. If you have Leeroy then he can pull wins out of nowhere on an empty board with Waggle Pick.
---
It is one of the least aggressive high tier aggro decks we've seen in years
---
I made a fatigue deck recently that I also call OTK.
---
Ok maybe it's more like 30tk or 35tk, but it's the same thing really.
---
They keep the correct discount a second time.
---
Rubbed my eyes. 
---
Blinked thrice.

Pinched myself.

---
The problem is trying to put it as an e-sport in the first place.
---
Look at the most successful e-sports titles, they have one thing in common, they rose organically. The game developer didn't just decide to form an e-sports league with cash prizes on the line for being the best of the best.
---
It's really ironic that Blizzard, the company with one of the first successful e-sports in Starcraft 1, fails to realize this.
---
Viable?  Pretty much every tracking site puts it high tier 2 to low tier 1 so absolutely.  It's not the uncounterable monster that folks thought as there are quite a few decks that beat it handily, but that doesn't make it a bad deck.
---
it has to do with how the Deathrattle was coded with a side of spaghetti
---
nothing at all to do with uncollectable
---
It‚Äôs probably not unattainable  to hit rank 5, and there‚Äôs not much different between rank 5 and low legend in terms of skill, so I would say it‚Äôs quite possible.
---
It just takes hella grinding lol
---
You know that makes sense. I never even looked at it that way until now.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of a free attack point without even having to spend a card on druid. Like what's better than infinite value??
---
I don‚Äôt understand why priest is being considered bad right now. I have a resurrection priest net deck with above a 70% win-rate from rank 15 to rank 7 in standard. Maybe I‚Äôm just luckier than I thought, but the deck performs really well.
---
If you can't beat them, join them. Be one of the cancer decks
---
Tyrande was a twitch prime limited event.
---
Mill Rogue only thrives for like, rank 20-19.
---
Cubelock is actually absent from what i've seen. most warlocks so far have been of the other kind (demons, discard, zoo or hand)
---
in general terms Wild has a lot of popular yet broken decks going around so outside of a few discussed like Big Priest or Mech Warrior the rest of the decks you can find could be anything from Dragon Warrior to Jade Druid, from Thief Rogue to Discolock and so on.
---
A waste of the time isn't it. I'd rather lose fast than waste my time playing against warriie
---
I don't think any matchups are auto-lose. People in this thread *really* don't understand how hard this deck can high roll. Especially against paladin, I once espionaged t1, drew the minion that draws 1 cost minions and filled my hand and board with high costed discounted minions. Honestly the matchup I hate more than warrior and paly is burn mage. It feels like I never draw raiding party or cutlass in those matches though so it's probably just personal bias.
---
Not true. Kaiba has had multiple cards forbidden and limited. Also some of his most powerful cards have been nerfed irl too
---
THE ZANCIENT ONE
---
Im not talking about broken im just talking about fun. Playing comtrol and watching a rogue burn half ur deck is cancer
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was bad, but it‚Äôs not seen on ladder nearly as much as Druid, Warrior, or Rogue right now.
---
Heck, positive inhalers is misprinted!
---
That's not true though is it? Don't be so upset over someones opinion.
---
I guess I don't pay attention to the story stuff, but that makes sense now
---
Yeah, he didn‚Äôt have Elysiana and that made it easier. If you play her you might get enough steam to go on, maybe even some healing.
---
‚ÄúYou must believe in the heart of the cards yugi‚Äù

I presume the same happens with Rattling Rascal? And what happens if you get the tokens back to hand first with shadowstep/brew/etc and then play and return them back to hand with the pick?
---
Why are you adding that link to every single comment you make?
---
I thought the announcement of SPecialist format for tournaments was a tease of Specialist Bo3 Brawlesium becoming a game mode. I was very disappointed.
---
But that's a **battlecry** which trigger _after_ a card has been played.  Once the Drakonit Operative has been played then it's true, you're not holding a dragon in your hand.  Vendetta affects the cost to actually _play_ the card yet, it hasn't been _played_ until you've paid the cost.

I'm trying to assign a flair to the post, but not having much luck! I also can't find any instructions on the rule page. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules))
---
Any help?
---
I don't know if they're using it, but it's beyond the point. They have done Amsterdam, Bahamas, Shanghai, Las Vegas for the new Masters, and a number of other cities that they have to rent venues. The transport of equipment, sets and people, and having them work away from home is a huge cost. There is a reason why BlizzCon is always at the same venue.
---
I gave in.  I thought you know what... fuck it, I'm gonna actually play meta this expansion.  Dropped enough for the 40 pack and opened it. 2 useless legendarys. Bought another 40 pack.  2 more useless legendarys. ended up with about 3000 dust.  Still not enough to craft a meta deck.  So now after having paid enough for one and a half brand new, full games, I am left with a 3/4 complete bomb warrior deck.  First and last time I EVER spend money on this game. So don't cry little one, f2p is the only true way to win..
---
Right, but that‚Äôs a battlecry which checks your hand after it‚Äôs been played. Since you have no other dragons in hand, it won‚Äôt trigger.
---
I know. And I'm not even denying that in Theory you are absolutely right. But then you have to think about Spaghetti code and play the Baelish game. Imagine the worst outcome based on the wording. If something seems wonky, that's where it's coming from.
---
How about this?  [http://cometcomedytv.com/keywords-research/](http://cometcomedytv.com/keywords-research/)
---
Golden rafaam is the ultimate value
---
Understanding how to correctly mulligan is probably one of the most important skills. I'll try and do a quick rundown  
---
  
---
Always keep no matter what: Miscreant, Prep - they're the best cards in the deck.  
---
Every other card is relatively matchup dependent, and what your initial draws are. Always try to shape hand so you have a solid 1-2-3 curve, unless you're looking for a big edwin hand.  
---
Backstab is usually a keep off coin, and on coin if against aggro. If against control warr on coin, backstab gets mulliganned, as it does nothing for the matchup. Earliest minion control warr plays is rover, which we don't really care about killing.  
---
Deckhand is a keep if off coin, it's a turn 1 play that helps get early chip damage in or trading.  
---
We sometimes keep sap against rogue if they're on coin. We don't like dealing with big edwins.  
---
Edwin gets kept if on coin, always. Try looking for a prep or a backstab if that's the gameplan.  
---
Fan is kept vs token always. Vs zoo you can keep, or pitch if your hand is looking slow. SI7 + backstab is much better in that MU.  
---
Party isn't an always keep as people believe. I mulligan it away if off coin without prep/backstab in hand. Off coin it's usually a keep. Without an activator on 2/3 it's never a keep in faster matchups. Quick tip for party: never prep it turn 1. if you have prep, you do it on 3 to get a combo minion like si7/miscreant/edwin out.  
---
SI7 is a keep on coin against aggro, off coin against aggro if you have backstab in hand.  
---
Myras is a keep vs warr if the rest of your hand looks solid. Real good card in that matchup.  
---
Everything else not listed gets thrown back if it shows up in your hand. Good luck!
---
I‚Äôd wait till the first round of nerfs for this expansion before investing in anything.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Commonly Boomship for Mecha'thun and Malygos, then Whirlwind + Inner Rage + Inner Rage/Shield Slam. Rarely need the full combo though.
---
Idk why people keep play HS. This game absolutly undeserve to exist. This game do nothing but harass players in 99%  of your game expirience just for 1% which you can see in Trolden and e.t.c.
---
I think Drakonit is close, but not quite the same here.  I appreciate you bringing it up as I think finding similar mechanics helps set precedent for what Blizzard devs _intended_ and helps determine if this is just bad card text or is indeed a bug.
---
They never expect the third savage roar
---
Very true - I was thinking Marik as a Warlock probably, with his reckless use of life and resources. 
---
Yugi for Mage, fairly self-explanatory - I considered him for Warlock but his mystical flavour works well with Mage cards.
---
Joey works as a Paladin, I think - buffing weak stuff and some Dragon synergy. Not sure about the other classes...
---
Pay 160 mana for 8/8, seems good
---
What was the GIRL for? Both people look childish here.
---
Meme decks in Legend - is this a new form of masochism?
---
Thank you very much !!! I will try my best to improve
---
Sounds fine by me. Better than both players losing at least.
---
&gt; The problem then is that a draw is a nightmare to handle. Who gets the win? Do you replay the match? But that's as I said a different issue imho.
---
they introduced new rule few years ago when dmh cause draw, https://twitter.com/XixoHS/status/908454348409237504?s=09
---
the player with the highest combination of armor/health will win.
---
&gt; For Rogue, they got the burst potential. With Waggle Pick and Leeroy, if you just draw Raiding Party, that is 20 damage. If you draw Greenskin along with it, it is 26.  
---
damn. obviously i knew the deck and those cards were good, but seeing it counted out like that is pretty crazy. rogue has always been one of the most burst heavy classes, but idk the raiding -&gt; pick -&gt; leeroy sequence is not all that fun
---

EDIT - done with u/TheRisingBlade
---
Is that Wario retarded brother?
---
If armor couldn‚Äôt go above thirty, wouldn‚Äôt priests hero power be better in every situation?
---
I feel like everyone forgets the bat
---
Honestly doesn't surprise me, there's a lot of pro players that are getting a reality check as to what they're actually making. There's just so much more money to be made with streaming rather than competitive play that I wonder why people even bother.
---
How? You can overstack armor but can't with heal. I mean 30 armor on top of 30 health, like an absolute health cap of 60
---
What does this mean?
---
Wasnt it the Raza priest with the three reno legendaries shadowreaper and a whole pile of one ofs like velen thalnos etc?
---
Make it so that whoever dealt more damage to the face wins. This way you don't favor warriors and you get a more proactive mirror game
---
Bring him back
---
Frozen Mage normally beats Tempo rogue 60-70 percent of the time, for me it does anyway
---
Sweet Jesus Christ
---
"can you send me the pdf of Around the World in 80 Days?"

How does it really differ from Leeroy, Cold Blood, Cold Blood, Shadowstep, Leeroy that we had in the past?

And Piccolo with a man bun
---
It‚Äôs to let you know that it‚Äôs a bot account.
---
Zalae is pretty unwatchable though. A forty year old man with a teenager's personality is not fun to watch.
---
Ignore it all you want but it is definitive proof that the player base is already fully capable of managing the use of their time.  Playing a second ladder is no less realistic than earning the 100 gold a day. I agree with what you are saying about optimization here, I just think it clearly goes against your point. The argument is people won‚Äôt play 6, they will go for 30 because there is a reward. Just like it is suggested that people will force themselves to max both ladders. The whole point is that based on optimization of limited time the game actively discourages trying wild at all currently.
---
Uhhh...stuck in their 40 min fatigue matches
---
spongebob and green goblin confirmed?
---
Crystalsong Portal into Dendrologist
---
I‚Äôve been playing big priest in wild and I just had three different people in a row auto-concede. Brought back memories of grade school when no one wanted to play with me.
---
Elysiana is simply bad card design. I don‚Äôt see any state of the game that could benefit from this, beyond a r50 match where you can replace your bad cards by others.
---
There are different ways to incentivize wild. Splitting the ladders is not the solution.
---
Not an inconsistency. The Paladin secret triggers WHENEVER a spell is cast, so it triggers before the spell actually resolved. It is the same with Counterspell, as the Flare is countered

‚Äú80‚Äù is the universal language of Hearthstone
---
comments like this make me wonder if people think before they say something stupid. 
---
i dont know what you mean by this but the wording on vendetta is very misleading. if you get it while playing as priest, it a card from another class.
---
Respectfully disagree. Either you end up in this situation where you get a measly 3 stroke discount, or the word gets changed so much you can't identify the defining components it had. It's like replacing English alphabets with morse code, but 100 times worse.
---
Exdemolish#1677 [NA] 80G Trade. you go first, I go after. Cool with showing quest too.
---
I despise long games. I prefer midrange and control, but a single game that lasts more then 20 minutes is misery.
---
as it turns out when you play the dragon you no longer have one in your hands, when you play the spell it doesn't leave your hand until you cast it and at that point the mana change doesn't matter because you already paid what should be 0
---
Yep. For me he is the Barnes of the deck. If I get into any comfortable position and I drop him, it‚Äôs game over. I wanna experiment with him and a more greedy list with Undahtakah.
---
Fuck. Warrior. I play control decks from the start of this game and now its "play warrior or aggro". Hate how blizz is taking balance of control decks
---
Good ol' days
---
On the bright side, at least it's not Êõ¶...
---
He answer to the otherguy saying that its bulshit that armor can stack over the 30health max
---
Yes but at the same time, when you're taught how to write in Chinese, you're told that every character should fit in a perfect square.
---
Playing zoolock, turn 7 Rafaam into 2 emeriss‚Äô followed by a Princess Talanji. Yeah I‚Äôm a low rank player, but I can be happy with this sort of stuff.
---
Add another tracking and marked shot, and then maybe from there u could add a grievous bite for token druids, and yeah secrets are good
---
Hearthstone was realistically never touching *paper* Magic.
---
It should be good because you have to buy the wings.
---
your argument is based on a person who has a heavy accent, I feel like it's a waste of time to even to trying to talk you
---
Intresting name
---
I've been running a deck without Nomi so idk if its worth including him
---
I added blood list into my permanent list! Thanks
---
"Death Knights" are what a lot of people use to describe Hero Cards, since all of the first Hero Cards introducing the new card type were Death Knight versions.
---
It miffs me a bit that people conflate the two but it's not hard to know exactly what they mean, rofl.
---
My argument is based on most Chinese people being unable to speak English well before they put in a certain amount of work. Your argument is based off people not even trying to learn your language because it is less necessary in the world. It seems talking to you is idiotic because you are emotionally hurt about something lol
---
Erm... Clonemaster Zerek is a Priest cars last I checked
---
The problem is that you absolutely have to run Elysiana+baleful banker/brewmaster in control warrior or you always lose the mirror, but then every mirror reaches the turn limit.
---
Do you mean Rastakhan's Rumble?
---
Because most people really liked Rumble Run, last I checked.
---
at that point just fill the page with [REDACTED]s
---
&gt;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON
---
Thanks. I honestly did look for the source to give credit, but only found reposters
---
You made me waste time in reading Bomb Warrior doesnt run Elysiana. Seriously, you should at least consider your ladder experience and check if your statistics dont sound odd and checking them a bit. Regardless, yes, Blizzard can nerf a card for just one match up in a top meta deck.
---
