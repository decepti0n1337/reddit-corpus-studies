I think this mode would be good for Blizz too. Even cards not good enough for Standard might be needed. For Example, EMP Operative is very strong in this brawl.

---
they showed off the deck, explained their choices of cards and how to improve the deck with more dust and then played a game at decent legend level to demonstrate how to play it. they had almost a mirror match and kinda explained their plays. I suggest you should watch it when you get the time, I can't really explain it quite as well. They didn't show off the whole legend grind, it's a fairly concise video

Brode got Hearthstone rolling and he was a good PR face, but I never got the impression that he was very effective at managing the size of a game Hearthstone became. 
---

---
Who knows what challenges he faced within the company, but Hearthstone was not exactly blazing ahead with new innovations in 2016-2017, and the effects of the immense power level of their expansions during that time is still felt in Standard format today.
---
Game mechanics updates - which I interpret as fixing technical debt within the game - started in late 2017, quite late during Brode's management of the game, and have continued to this day.
---
From that perspective, it makes perfect sense for Brode to have moved to a new startup, where he can use his strengths in the front-end of innovation and not worry about managing an existing major product.

Wow congratulations i have never seen anyone on reddit as petty as you are. And that is an accomplishment. 
---
You couldn't even use my real comment because maybe someone could agree with that.

I am impressed.

Scroll of Wonder doesn't count toward the quest completion though.
---
The game has grown more generous with gold and dust since the switch from adventures, but I'd also propose that what you're suggesting (more playable legendaries) would only make the game more expensive. I think the current amount is in a nice sweet spot where you don't have to own significantly more legendaries to be competitive and where the meta doesn't revolve around big swing turns as much due to all the legendaries seeing play.
---
If that's the case, then outside the first week of any particular month, the player numbers would be even lower than Wild's. It would be a glorified Tavern Brawl.
---
I understand the post has been edited, but his one of his points was that it would be an alternative to Standard with a lower barrier to entry compared to Standard.
---
I believe this will definitely remain a strong deck.  Stormbringer and rain of toads as well as spellbreaker are already great additions to the deck.  While corpsetaker was definitely a power move, there are still plenty of good 4 drops to take their place.  The deck has always been playable without Kalimos but it should miss lich king quite a bit.  The big question will be - is blizz gonna give (or are there some neutral already) 8 drops to re-up the deck's late game, or will it be forced to turn into a more aggressive build with more 4 and 6 drops?  Finally, hagatha is going to be one of the few hero cards in the game, and obviously will remain very powerful.
---
Thanks for making this.
---
I've been playing Spell Hunter ever since KnC came out and now people tell me I'm some garbage meta hunter player lol
---
While Nintendo still has a very good reputation, they haven't adapted very well to the "always-online" world that we live in now.
---
&gt;But not as bad as uninteractive combo decks.  
---
Just as uninteractive minus the combo.    
---
&gt;But at least those are better than braindead aggro decks.  
---
Aggro decks are great matchups and at least offer some interaction.  
---
&gt;But at least thats not just mindles midrange arena curvestone  
---
Even better matchups offering even more interaction and trading.  
---
&gt;But as we all know the true archetype for real intelligent hearthstone lovers are control decks...  
---
Control decks are not fun nor interactive to play against, give me the variety of hunter decks to match against any day.

How does encountering Paladins and Hunters on ladder mean the game is for whales? Odd Paladin has been pretty cheap all year long and several Hunter archetypes are cheap as well.
---
I find it confusing when people refer to themselves in the third person, confusing still when they admit exactly what was wrong with them in that same sentence. But I do must agree, nothing so far that you’ve said has been anywhere close to ingenious. 
---
Keep trying, buddy.

Better luck next time.

I mean it makes sense since my opponents always get huffer. 100% huffer spawn rate against me. When I try to get huffer, 0.1%.

Wait, am I an idiot? I thought Mike Morhaime left ages ago; or was that just the WoW team? Or am I thinking of someone else?
---
Yeah, mage has been suffering for a long time now because are base cards are so good, they never give us much in expansions, but at the same time they make all of the new cards to survive through our removal xD
---
Ahhh, I fondly remember those people claiming to know what the fuck they were talking about when the Diablo Immortal announcement started tanking the stock. "No no no..." they said, "this is representative of blah blah blah..." Yeah, boys - get fuckin' rekt. Everyone saw the writing on the proverbial wall but you Michael Pachter no nothing know it alls.
---
All they're doing is reporting the data. If you think the numbers are lying I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
I've rarely player pure control decks simply due to it just seeming boring to me.  Thus I speak from being the opponent of them which often just comes across to me as "I play something, they remove it" and who wins comes down to more RNG on how much removal they drew at the right times.  
---
Maybe it's just a symptom of the current state of HS because I've been thinking I won't find control as bad come rotation when they are forced to hopefully actually play to board a bit more instead of setting up combos, otk or "i win" cards like Guldan, Jaina etc. when they do run out of resources.  
---
What I've never understood is why many OTK/Combo decks seem to hate on control decks and vice versa when, at least by the current state of affairs, they are often the same thing.  
---
For example it's call "control priest" but isn't it really an OTK priest since the idea is to setup the mind blast win?  I mean it's an entire deck based around removing minions until they can play that condition - how does that differ much at all from combo/otk decks that we see around lately?  
---
Seems the same shit to me - control control control - play your winning move.  
---
Little interaction for the most part = boring.  
---
I do agree on the same archetypes matching one another being more interactive though - I had thought a mode like this would be cool but people would complain since they wouldn't get their polarizing matchups anymore even though apparently we hate polarizing matchups (only when we're on the bad side - they are great when you're on the good side it seems).
---
Who said anything about money?
---
Hunter on the way down, so those numbers will go up for sure.
---
Yeah, but isn’t stepping down into advisory role is like going on a break in a relationship? Like, we all knew where this was going, right? 
---
No. Those cards aren’t the problem. Druid’s ability to ramp is. Wild Growth and Nourish left as they were would just cause this problem again every time they make a good, expensive card in Druid. Wild Growth and Nourish straight up restrict design space for other cards. 
---
I played him and sent him a friend request - never got added. RIP my dreams of sending him some weird thank you message and then forgetting he was on my friends list.

I extremely agree.

Middle one is prob safe bet and biggest effect on board on play

They used to include Shirvallah OTK Pally but it was just so shitty there was no reason to anymore, it's the same core as Exodia Paladin with a wildly inferior win condition.
---
I'm playing a Odd Mage (because I'm only 60 wins away of the 500) that's about 50 matches and 1/3 of them were against hunters. So, 33% of games are hunters...
---
I give this post a solid wholesome out of 10.

Before he announced his new company I just assumed it was some sexual harassment thing since that has been happe so much and a reason someone would leave a company all of a sudden.
---
Game would be awful boring if we were just playing vanilla minions from Basic and Classic or made similar to those still don't you think? Introducing new mechanics, effects, and game styles is the only way to keep a card game alive over time.
---
There was one question in the survey where they asked **what could be better about standard and wild mode**.
---
YEAH, finally I could tell them all the cool stuff and someone half-important with maybe some decision-influence could read it, so I wrote all ideas and then after pressing submit button... :
---
**"sorry dude, only 500 characters, your post is 3722 characters."**
---
Yep. No one important will read it, because I could not tell everything. 
---
Nintendo designs technology and consoles. Billboard designs online games, they are in a different market.
---
Yup. It sure is difficult. Maybe they need to look at what the community wants more. Wild, Rotation, etc.
---
It reminds me of something a wise man once said...
---
"The greatest sacrifices require the strongest wills"
---
If the game would benefit more from a rotation mode (for me personally, I believe this to be true), then maybe some things should take a hit. I don't know. Again, I think it should be the community who gives our outlook in like an official blizzard survey or whatever. That reminds me! I need to do that survey
---
No it was the tavern brawl :(
---
And if we were to believe that then we'd assume it's going to be a huge failure right?  
---
I guarantee it will be a raging success just as star wars galaxy of heroes was.  Diablo plus mobile = success.  
---
The uppity children can get mad it's not Diablo 4 (which will no doubt come at a later time) and mass protest for some stupid, unknown reason but that won't stop it being successful, fun and something for me to take a break from HS to play. :)
---
Whilst you're bothering to reply though can you reply in full if possible ...
---
&gt;What's wrong with Diablo Immortal?  
---
I honestly don't know. I'm not convinced the people that don't like it know.

---
HS rank is heavily weighted towards how much you play, not how good you are. Certainly there’s some correlation there, but some months I’m a rank 5 player and some I’m a 15, doesn’t really note a different skill level. 
---
This was planned already. Posting this just makes it look like something changed, which it didn't. This was the plan all along and is quite common in situations like this. Leader steps down, consults/advises for a period of time, then leaves. The original big news was when we found out before Blizzcon.
---
Everyone is putting up clickbait articles now to generate revenue, and then redditors are reposting constantly to get their karma.
---
Unless you didn't know Mike was leaving until now, this is not news.

I sure as hell think so. This guy I hadn't heard of yesterday is leaving Blizzard. I bet he's gonna go work with George Papadapolous. Trouble is a brewing!
---

&gt; not true at all, for me.

FTFY.  thanks for sharing
---
Ya I had that in mind too. I'm just going to use assassinate to make a hobo version of a budget deck
---
Sorry, that was me. I've played 3-4 times as many hunters as priests though.

Would you take it over assassinate?

I would refine this to the idea that if someone specifically chooses to put an Alarm-O-Bot in their deck, then it is for a damn good reason.

Randomly generated Alarm-O-Bots are far less threatening (off of Omega Assembly or Delivery Drone)

---
Actually the closest to Control deck i've made was Control Warrior, since he seems to have the most aoe and removals. It was pretty fun and i was satisfied. 
---
They dont have the same cores. Exodia paladin uses call to arm and lynessa for draw. Holy wrath paladin uses double crystology+novice engineer and double prismatic lens. Holy wrath paladin is worse against armor classes like warrior and druid but it is supposedly faster than exodia paladin(according to dog) so it is better against priest, which is more popular than druid and warrior at high rank. [Someone](https://twitter.com/HsCxyyy/status/1082861123668389888) in Asia got rank 1 legend with holy wrath paladin 2 days ago.

Game lacks everything that made diablo good and unique. Immortal looks like generic mobile game with simplify mechanics and it is heavily censored because they want to push it to chinase market. Simply put it's not diablo game if you played any of diablo games before you would understand.
---

---
You know, they were actually banning people for posting this for awhile as it was the most common post this sub has EVER had
---
OK, so it was good, then people stopped playing to it's strengths and then it became not so good, then Blizzard nerfed it so people could play control. Cool.
---
Fact remains decks are not played on a vacuum, they always have to be compared with other decks they are played against, and that's the only way to measure how good they are. Even in your flawed, flawed example you fail to show any "intrinsic" power level of the deck, you are just telling me how it fared against the different metas it was on.
---
This is hilarious! You realize they are pretty much the exact same deck, right? Spend the entire game burning through your deck, clearing enemy minions and collecting health, and when you finally have the right combination of cards, you instantly win.
---
I mean, you can not be happy about facing a deck that counters yours, but it's no more or less cheap, lame or stupid than mecha'Druid.
---
I hear a lot about that one but I don't feel like I've had that much trouble with it. Or at least I don't remember it. 
---
Awesome. Do you mind if others use it when it's done? :) I'm in a few discords and this has been an issue people bring up now and then.
---
The apostrophe is quite relevant.  '17 is a shorthand for 2017, so a year and half ago.
---
&gt;None of these decks are new, but thats to be expected at a time before rotation.
---
No, it's not. If anything the third expansion has always brought new decks and archetypes. And you're also ignoring the fact that a lot of these decks have been high tier FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR! That is worrying.
---
I think this is really overblown. The meta is pretty diverse right now. In running in to more warriors, warlocks and priests than hunters on average
---
I loved doing this back on the Reno Jackson days. Best part was that they would see the effect didn't even happen ;)

well, he is a 10 mana: gain 5 armor, destroy 2 random enemy minions, summon a board, play 4 secrets - at worst, card. Its not a bad deal for 10 mana. 
---
My dreaming ends, your nightmare begins...
---
Flee....screaming.
---
Accurate
---
It’s a cool idea, but it’s a balancing nightmare. A good example of it being hard to balance just one class’s Quest is [[The Caverns Below]]. After two nerfs, it came back into power with the rise of [[Giggling Inventor]] and only went away once Giggling itself got nerfed. Having neutral quests with unique rewards makes it harder to print cards going forward. 
---
If you have a class quest, you have to be careful printing neutrals. If you have a neutral quest, it makes it really hard to print both neutrals and class cards. My explanation is kind of unclear, so here’s a better way of putting it:
---
If a Warrior Card is released that would completely break a new Mage Quest, it usually doesn’t matter, because you have to jump through hoops to get that Warrior card in your hand to play with the Quest/Reward. But if that’s Warrior card conflicts with a Neutral Quest or Reward by making it completely broken from an interaction, it just “can’t” be printed for Warrior. It limits design space over time to make Neutral Quests, in my opinion. When quests are class based, there is less constraint on the cards of other classes.

---

---
I prefer posts that are actually important than shitty screenshots of slightly unusual RNG.
---
Could you please do one on odd warrior?
---
Boomsday cards are played, it's just that the 2017 expansions were so overpowered Blizzard had to tone down the power level this year, but after the rotation, this year's sets will shine. They do contain great cards which just get overshadowed by the 3 previous OP-as-fuck expansions.
---
If you take a closer look, you'll see that quite a bit of cards saw play :
---
Floop and Dreampetal Florist became staples in druid, Psychmelon birthed the most OP deck that ever was (even though it was in wild)
---
Secret Plan sees play in spell hunter, Spider Bomb sees play in deathrattle hunter, two pretty strong decks
---
Shooting Star, Cosmic Anomaly and Luna were core cards in tempo mage before the Wyrm nerf, and if tempo mage comes back those 3 cards will remain core cards of the archetype.
---
Glow-tron sometimes sees play in Odd Paladin and will probably make it into the deck full-time after rotation because odd pally loses most of its one drops. Kangor sees play in Exodia and Even paladin.
---
Zerek's Cloning Gallery has a deck named after it, Topsy and Mecha'thun priest exist thanks to Boomsday cards even though they're relatively fringe decks
---
Myra's Unstable Element sees play in Odd Rogue, the rogue Deathrattle package from Boomsday is really good and the deck needs just a little bit more support to actually be competitive
---
Menacing Nimbus sees play, Electra saw play in Shudderwock and will see play again because the card is strong
---
Soul Infusion, The Soularium and Doubling Imp are great Zoo cards even though the deck is not doing great right now
---
Non-quest Odd Warrior is actually defined by Boomsday : Rover, Assembly, Dyn-o-matic, Super Collider, Dr. Boom. That's almost 1/3 of the deck
---
Regarding the neutrals, Crystallizer sometimes sees play in Odd Rogue and will make the cut in agressive Odd decks after Dire Mole and Fire Fly are gone. Galvanizer enables Mecha'thun Warlock, Subject 9 defines Secret Hunter, Zilliax and Zilliax and even though Mecha'thun decks are far from top tier, the card still sees a reasonable amount of play.
---
Boomsday is a much better expansion than people give it credit for
---
Yes. I took that into account.
---
Unfortunately, none of these are used in any competitive wild decks.
---
To check viability you can:
---
- peek into /r/competitiveHS to see if any interesting reports / decklist are being posted
---
- check /r/wildhearthstone for either the newest wild data reaper report, tempostorm wild meta snapshot - both sources are good, but maybe a little irregular.
---
- be on the lookout (probably on wildHS sub) for posts from /u/neon313 whom posts a report with "standalone wild decks" on a weekly basis. Format looks as:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wildhearthstone/comments/adg8ym/report_top_rastakhans_rumble_decks_week_5/
---
Sorry about the dicks in this thread. The deck was made specifically to have a good matchup against spell hunter. You will probably have a tough time beating it, especially as the cards used to beat it are minions. Just try to play through and accept the loss once in a while. 
---
Thanks for the great response!
---
I'm in a similar position as you. Trying to rank up.
---
I made an anti hunter deck the other day and haven't played hunter since. It's like the match maker can read my deck names and is spiteful...
---
Except the fact that I only encounter Mech-Hunter using all the GvG broken cards.
---
I want to see a Brawl where they ban top 5 played cards every day or so.
---
They get their data on deck winrates and archetypes from the contributors opponents specifically to avoid the selection bias you're talking about.

Such a bait from Whizbang to waste dust on a really awful deck with relevant name. And the sad part is that some bad players will actually fell for it after accidentally winning their first game. Smart, Blizzard, smart.
---
You should grind out rank points and spend you gold on arena. I'm not sure how familiar you are with twitch but you should watch hearthstone streamers.
---
Here are some steamers that I find very educational

---

---
The feel for the game wasn't that different.
---
I started in the beta and games weren't all that better. People are annoyed with stuff like paladin rushing them down, but back then you were rushed down by a hunter and your best defensive minions were ancient watcher taunted up by a defender of argus, which was a turn 2+3/4 play, no tar creeper, no self healing for most classes. Just take the L if you didnt draw your 1-2 early game taunts and 0 healing.
---
Nowadays people complain that it sucks when the paladin draws his whole deck over the entire game and kills you, but in beta, rogues played auctioneer for 5 mana and coin concealed it, and on turn 6 he'd just draw half his deck, buff the auctioneer to 12/4, hit you in the face, and conceal it again. Even if you played 1 of the 2-3 classes that even HAD an answer to this (deadly shot, brawl, flame strike, other 7 mana+ cards that didnt see play because they were too slow) you'd still die to the 4 mana leeroy + 2 shadowsteps. 
---
You couldn't really put down taunts either, most taunts were flat out garbage and even if you played things like sunwalker or double giant+defender chances are the rogue would save sap for them, or 3 mana BGH, which every class had access to, so big minions weren't in the meta unless they were under 7 attack.
---
Hunter was basically a more cancerous version of druid's spreading plague, it had 2 versions: Unleash the hounds during beta would give all your beasts +1 attack and charge for 2 mana, I repeat. CHARGE to ALL minions and 1 attack. 2 mana.
---
It was changed into the current unleash, but back then there was 2 mana starving buzzard, which was a really nice sprint + lethal setup for 4 mana and 2 cards.
---
Warrior/Mage played a more control-ish deck which relied on Alextrazaing the opponent and for warrior, you equiped a gorehowl on turn 7 before, then grommash + enrage for 17 dmg, or for mage, you'd fireball frostballx2 ice lance x2 for 20.
---
Oh some point pyro cost 8 mana, and some guy missed lethal at blizzcon with it :\^)
---
Beta over, 1st expansion arrives.
---
The savior sludge belcher/zombie chow put a stop to some agro decks, but the anti christ undertaker gave birth to a new form of cancer in hunter. I remember I'd queue up with deathrattle hunter at rank 20 and be rank 5 in a few hours. I never managed to get to that rank that quickly ever after.
---
Loatheb didnt allow board clears so you could set up your board with him for lethal, and most classes didnt see much play because of this.
---
GvG arrives (I think? My memory is a bit foggy)
---
Value decks start to pop out, Dr Boom, piloted shredder, etc, it was kinda plain, mech mage was a fun deck, but people mostly just played hunter and added Dr Boom and shredder to the naxx deck and call it midrange.
---
Healbot arrived which was a nice change, allowing every class to respond to alex/agro decks.
---
I think thats enough trivia from me. Long ass post already.
---
false. You can have several decks rotating out and in. You would ALWAYS have cards. 
---
1 mana deal 12x6 dmg. Half of it to minions as well. I doubt any boss survives that matchup.
---
Np. I haven't dusted her yet I think i'll keep it untill they nerf it, I could use that 1600 dust later more than 400 now :p thanks for the tip.

---
I stopped reading when you claimed SSBM to be the best fighting game ever made. You lose credibility even calling it a fighting game. 
---
Disenchant your duplicates, after that i suggest looking at decks you have some key components on, and use your dust to craft those decks
---
Wow that indeed sucks. As a long time player with full collection, this is boring. As a new player with only Rastakhan cards, this is unplayable. Well played Blizzard
---
Got 2 legendaries and 1 golden rare in a boomsday pack! The next one got me a golden epic, normal epic and a golden common! I’ll keep 1 legendary and dust the rest but this helps give me 3300 dust enough for 2 legendaries. Debating whether to craft now or wait till new expansion. I’m a new player but trying to get to legend this month or the next. Might either beef up odd rogue with Myra and Edwin or shoot for Even Paladin but I’m 1-2 legendaries short.
---
This brawl would be awesome if all the cards were unlocked for it. Kinda sucks because I dusted all my wild cards to play standard, and I'm not about to use dust on a brawl.
---
PERFECTION.
---
I disenchanted all wild cards so I also have a very limited collection for this brawl. Won it with dr. Boom mech warrior and never played again. 
---
I didnt really like this brawl, but it seems ppl are enjoying it so I don't mind this format at all 
---
Werent people saying auto complete will fill in cards you dont own?
---
I understanding calculating your move, I do it as well. I figure what I want to do and act on it. But dragging out every turn until the very end of the rope only to have used your hero power and played a one mana drop card and have 7 mana leftover when you have no cards in hand (after you played the 1 mana drop) while your board was empty is excessive.
---
&gt;!I think quests should be scrapped. Instead they could try and use the monthly card back quest thing as a form of "quest", I was thinking like, Win 5 games of any mode(except Adventure) and get 300 gold or something like that, and they can reuse the chest animation for this too. Scrap the win 3 games for 10 gold too.!&lt; 
---
Actually there's been A LOT of positive feedback about this Brawl, people even asking Blizzard to create a new game mode when each season different sets are used, so this definitely is not boring for most full collection players. 
---
On the other hand, I understand that with limited collection, this might be find either hard or just unfun.

Say that about any female player then there would be huge backlash. Okay to say that about a male though...
---
You can support the strategy with 2 x Augmented Elekk (for carnassa) and Stitched Tracker for getting maybe another keleseth. On the other side Spirit of the Lynx, Beastmaster and Dire Frenzy can help to buff the creeps (you could also dire frenzy carnassa). 
---
Yeah it's common sense really. Neutral quests would be a nightmare. Although I like the idea of quests, I think just existing at all affect design space too much. Though they are fun, Hearthstone would be healthier without them. It'll be nice for them to rotate to wild, but it's the Deathknight cards I'm most looking forward to seeing the back of.
---
As a bisexual person, I find the "press emergency gay backstory button" everytime Overwatch happens to fall kinda offensive....
---
It's been a sad warrior life since the War Axe execution.
---
That was embarrassing to read. How would that single beast ever survive and kill two minions? I can tell you thought about that idea for a grand total of 7 seconds.
---
You can play 2 quests mage. Think toast did it with that legendary that replicates your starting hand. 
---
he always said he was going to be leaving. he probably hasnt had any influence for a year if not longer. business as usual really.
---
Excessive, certainly, but I have a really hard time believing this is a very frequent occurrence, post comes off more like it happened a couple times in a row and you blew a fuse.  
---
At least in my experience, it happens once or twice in a round every few rounds, which I think would be in a decent margin of honest negligence from the other player (ie: left the room, tabbed out, looking something up) rather than an intentional attack or mockery of their opponent. 
---
It's also important to remember that some people are just toxic/trolls though, but a aggressively-worded Reddit post isn't going to solve video game toxicity, that's a deeply rooted psychological problem on its own.

They added a huge amount extra ranks very recently, of course only for new players since it was added, if your doing that poorly and your collection isn't great just make a new account and play in the rank kiddie pool. It comes with like 18ish free packs as you level up I do belive.
---
In a world with so many legendaries that are unique to one or two decks, I’m grateful for cards like zilleax that allow me to work towards more than one deck at a time.
---
9 mana 1/1!
---
*Whispers* so shamans eat shit too
---
yeah xdddddddd
---
You don't even need coin (only 6 mana), but yeah he did miss it.
---
Perhaps, using Drake just for the synergy is a weaker turn 4 but is needed sometimes. But is it worth just for the Witchdoctor and Scaleworm? Those cards often don't even make the cut in Dragon decks, is it worth building around them just for their effects? It being an Even deck does make the prospect less iffy for sure though. That's definitely a consideration to take the deck.
---
This cannot be true. I did not get a GvG legendary from the bundle and I haven't opened a GvG pack since 2015
---
Done
---
IIRC, Team 5 said that they want to add Highlander and C'thun-like mechanics, it is already something
---
Very strong, if you just played this even as a bad player you could reach high ranks pretty easily, it's not too hard to pilot anyway.
---
Cairne is the safest pick but Oondasta is the fun pick, but you have to draft big beasts for it to work
---
One reason why it feels stale so easily is that we've been using so many of these cards since the beginning. Current meta decks in standard tend to run 10-20 cards from basic and classic. 
---
E.g. if you're playing against a current midrange hunter, he'll play the same Animal Companion, Hyena, Highmane, Kill Command, Explosive Trap and so on that they've always played. Of course that gets old quickly.
---
Thalnos isn't *dope* though, he's just a boy, ol reliable. &lt;3
---
It changes every day on what I feel like to play. The core that beats Big Priest is Sylvanas + Deathrattle triggers. The trick is getting multiple sylvanas via discovering her, cubing her, zola her.
---
Both of them together in a deck is problematic. The nerfs were too hard, I think nerfing Wild Growth alone could be enough to bring Druid's power level down, without butchering the class.
---
Lychee#2485 EU, 80g quest, you go first

Most decks haven't changed at all either, Odd Rogue for instance has been thoroughly figured out. They just got something against Shaman.

Well Nintendo's net income has grown over 40% compared to 2017. And for example, Blizzard's has fallen compared to last years.

And if so, you should end up with an extra copy of Undatakah in your deck right? Which is nice in case of silence/morph.

But activision signed with blizzard (vivnedi games at the time) in 2008 which was 6 years before hearthstone even came out. They might have killed other business units but they definitely helped fund/create/develop hearthstone

---
Thanks a bunch! 
---
Based on someone's analysis comparing Google searches to subs (which did a decent job matching up to each other during the points in time when we knew sub numbers), it's not really "hemorrhaging players" any more than it has since WotLK. It has been losing players per expansion since WotLK. It's not surprising. It's a nearly 15 year old game. No matter what expansion they put out, tyey're not going to suddenly start gaining masses of people again. That won't happen until they decide to put out WoW 2.
---
Even still, it has millions of active subs, and that's likely to get a decent bump when Classic becomes available.
---
In this specific instance I think he's just memeing and that is a spell hunter deck whilst he's playing a mage (so it's just an image on overlay).
---
Deck code? :) 
---
So you want a reliable, available at all times for all classes discard or stall mechanism? 
---
I think an in-built tracker would help those who are new and may not know about them. Level the playing field for everyone.
---
Personally I find the ability to keep way more than 18 decks on a tracker and also to track their win rates more useful than having the deck on screen during a game.
---
Having the tracker remove potential opponent secrets as you make plays though is a huge advantage compared to memorising them all. Especially after a new expansion or nerf. Also new mechanics are easier to grasp.
---
The archmage guy that gives you fire balls. The whole time you are pulling off the otk combo he is saying "ha ha". Or it sounds like it...
---
r/comedycemetary
---
You mean you are "matched" against opponents of similar skill. That's not the same as a game being balanced around skill. You are matched against people of similar rank, rank and skill have very limited correlation as anything up to rank 5 is subject to inflation. If I am a legend player but I stop playing for a few months I will be at rank 25 despite still being a top tier player.
---
So yes you are ranked against people of a similar rank, but that says basically nothing about their skill or their deck quality.
---
There's your problem then. Start at rank 50 (may need a restart) you get free packs as you rank up and will only play against people who have beginner decks too
---
The current expansion is fine. Not as good as Legion, but it's fine. There are some problems, of course, but Blizzard has been fixing them in patches pretty regularly. M+ and the raids are pretty good, they're removing the negative aspects of the azerite system in the next major patch, class changes have been happening, and the new content they put out is pretty good.
---
/r/wow is hyperbolic.
---
Ahaha I meant treasure room
---
I agree, I've always had this nagging feeling that quests were a missed opportunity.  With rumble's mechanics you could have had a quest 'overkill x minions' and now maybe you're thinking about making suboptimal trades to try and complete your quest.
---
I completed it once, and also saw the treasure room once. Both in the same run. I didn’t realize it was that crazy until this post.
---
***Pack Filler*** (i guess)
---
drink with me, friend.
---
Just beat a spell hunter with my janky bwonsambi fatigue priest. Feels good. 
---
At that point it’s almost easier just drawing Brann and Keleseth,
---
I saw something like this on /r/customhearthstone a while ago, branded 'Side quests'. OP said side quests wouldn't show up in the mulligan every time which I think makes sense (I don't think they'd be overplayed because they are by definition slow).
---
Oh, this is not the host subreddit 😂 
---
The quest leaves if you’re running that.
---
just continue to play. you don't need to spend money. i have been playing for 6 months, i've only spent $20 on this game, and I already have three 'odd' decks and 200 ranked wins.   
---
i started with a decklist i found online, an odd hunter leeroy jenkin deck, but for the first 3 months i didn't have enough dust to get the leeroy, so i replaced him with that creature card for 5 that deals 3 damage to an opponent.   
---
every day i get the gold from the quests. i use that gold to play arena. from arena i get packs and dust. i always get the free pack from tavern brawl. so far so good.

YOU FACE JARRAXUS EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGIONS
---
I think this is a hint at the future of Wild. There may eventually be a separate ranked mode for card "years" such as Mammoth, Raven, etc., or Wild will end up being a random selection of 6 all-time expansions.
---
Frankly I love Wild just the way it is. It's a vacation from Standard ranked netdecks. But we're going to reach a point eventually where Standard is only a small percentage of all potential cards in a collection, and the game is going to have to accommodate that differently, I think.
---
It’s so you can pull out Grom and go Inner Rage, Sudden Genesis, Sudden Genesis. 
---
Do i have to? from [Blood Imp]
---
Wrong. I’ve actually used this to get lethal with Tundra Rhino on board. Go fav with Rhino, then flanking strike on the think to get 3 more face damage with the wolf that is summoned.
---
They're both on rate for draw spells.
---
Three and five mana have both been the standard cost of drawing two and three cards respectively. As to why its rare instead of common, draw three cards tend not to be commons to begin with. Nourish is rare, Cabalist's Tome is Epic, Omega Assembly is rare, The Solararium is Legendary, and so on.
---
The original nerve wrecking situation is when he does this to you for 8 mana, not 10.
---
Stouk#21831 EU 80g trade. I show, you go first.
---
Turns? Buddy, you had that game locked in the moment you played that wax rager.
---
Its worth a shot. There is Some potential here.
---
I think an occasional thing like hero cards would be better for legendary weapons.
---
Definitely. They are especially fun in wild with a lot more support.
---
i just beat him with rogue - had wax rager on board turn 3, he played voidlord, i topdecked an assissinate, traded all my jades and had exact lethal with my remanining minons and one dagger punch. feelsgoodman

Thx for the help but because i'm on a mobile device i think i cant assign a flair-_-

I would say these are better than all cardbacks we get. 
---
I’m actually a huge fan of “A bargain forged in blood and shadow” followed by that ominous music. I love all the death knight quotes honestly.
---
I have a real penchant for trying to make shitty cards work.  Most quests are shitty cards.  I would encourage more of these.  Quests are some of my favorite cards in the game.  From the heart.

In order of favorite to least favorite:

* Paladin
---
* Druid
---
* Shaman
---
* Warlock
---
* Priest
---
* Mage

* Rogue

As we know, a deck full of 1-drops that you can't play on Turn 1 is *not great,* which is why Hunter takes the top spot here.

---
As time goes on I've come to the opinion that I hate quests, at least the way they were designed for Un'Goro. They encourage extremely linear deck building in a way I don't like.
---
That is probably the most hearthstone game I've ever seen.  Outplay your opponent turn after turn after turn, then in one turn you lose from mid-high health.
---
As long as both OTK and a minimally interactable opponent hand exist, hearthstone will continue to hearthstone.
---
I’ll admit that I was playing that deck at one point and had gotten Keleseth from Stitched Tracker. I felt so clever for doing it, until I realized the original Keleseth was still in my deck.

OUT OF MY JUNGLE
---
I would say that is a very fine deck but it certainly seems to struggle sone in the current meta. Just keep on grinding and you will start to get better with certain matchups.  
---
Not to mention soon the standard rotation will cone and shake up the meta, ciukd bring control mage back some!
---
Just increase the cost of it by 1 and they won’t be able to play Zola with it. That’ll fix it!
---
It’s pretty good, and a staple in the deck. Not Rexxar or Zul’jin important, but important enough. Refill, good damage (which I’ve used to finish off opponents more often than not) and most spells created by it are useful and can turn the tide around.
---
If you don’t have it, I wouldn’t craft it as it is rotating in April. If you have Subject 9, you can try the new Hybrid Hunter, it’s a mix between beasts and spell stones, and plays pretty similar to spell hunter (getting spellstones on curve, Rexxar snd Zul’jin as backup, but with an initial beast package to deal massive damage early turns)

Replace "hunter" with "druid" and "2019" with "2018" and i don't have a punchline.
---
Drop the elementals (except Artificer) and add one more blastwave, dragons fury and another Artificer. I also stripped faceless since I didn't really get value out of him like ever. Put in flamestrike for your dragons fury as well. I don't have Zola so I can't judge how good she is in the deck, but I'd say not too important. 
---
Odd mage is losing elemental package and frost bitch jaina, probably wont be a huge problem.
---
Loo didnt know, sorry
---
Cool. Thanks.

The murloc sounds are my favorite.

Yeah, I thought about BSM as I wrote that. It's too inconsistent against aggro to be a decent control deck. I love playing it, but it's just not there.

Never happened to me. Sometimes minions are "disjointed" from where they are placed.

could you please link me the deck you recommend. i thought i have 2 dragons furys already not sure what u mean

Omg i love them!!!! I think billzard doesnt make cardbacks like theese cuz they might be too good and hence require more processing power/data ?? Is that possible?
---
i have Aluneth and Blood Thanos or however u spell it. should i disenchant them to try and get Zilliax. The guy with taunt and lifesteal
---
Hah! That woulda made it infinitely more interesting 
---
Maybe they can include wizbang to everyone and make all new deck recipes for each class
---
#
---
Oh you do I just didn't see them. I'm running a self made deck so I don't have a link rn sorry. I'd still recommend you to drop the elementals. Especially as singleton cards they suck with the condition they have. One 0 mana 4/4 also won't help you too much in this deck. If you have it, pack in Zilliax. 
---
Yes, if you click it was soon as you drop it on the board that happens. You have to restart the client to reset it. I have already lost a few games because of that. 
---
He took 10 fatigue damage, which left him at one health.
---
https://imgur.com/JwKOlES
---
I'm so angry.
---
Don't ever disenchanted Thalnos! Thalnos sees play in literally every meta, it's even suspected by many to get hall of famed but I doubt it. It's a very, very good card that fits on countless decks. For Aluneth.... If you don't play Tempo mage I guess you can dust it. It will rotate soon as well anyways.
---
But if you somehow can get the dust for Zilliax I'd recommend crafting it. 
---
If you weren't worried before, you're not paying attention. 2 CFOs, Morhaime, Brode and the other big daddies of Hearthstone, bad press, HOTS getting fucked. Also this new survey with them asking players if they would still play if there was no more Hearthstone esports. Like c'mon. I don't even see Hearthstone surviving past the next 3 sets.

This is a really longstanding bug that happens when you try to interact with a minion too quickly after playing it. It's a client bug; the minion is in play.
---
It's not specific to rush or charge but that's the most common way to trigger it.
---
I wanna say is not common, but it is a known bug. Happens when you try to attack too fast after summoning the minion, just play slower...I hate when I see people miss lethal and the like because they are trying to play way too fast.
---
https://imgur.com/ZEzxEhe
---
Thanks, will try it. It's frustrating to lose an arena game because of TWO consecutive minions refusing to be controlled!
---
Okay I started the game to get you the link. This is my current odd mage deck. I tried to tweak it a lot, teching stuff in and out and found myself most conformable with this version. Of course it's not a meta breaker and won't really have significantly different WR from the metalists, I just like it as a main mage for years. Anyways, I hope you'll enjoy and that it will help you out!

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I can't give much insight into the deck myself but you should check out [this guide to odd mage](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/aepxfh/odd_elemental_mage_to_legend/) from /r/CompetitiveHS that was posted today by somoneone who hit legend with it
---
There's a lot of detailed info and discussion regarding how to play it
---
What’s the angry sperm represent?
---
Feelsbadman
---
no I would say if you cant beat em join em lol
---
So, the cards would still appear in your opening hand, they'd trigger automatically, and despite having to invest somewhere between six and twelve mana, the reward would only be worth at most four mana?
---
Additionally, while Consecration is a four mana effect, it really isn't worth that much. As a result, the only time it is usually played is in conjunction with Equality currently. "Deal two damage to all enemies" is valued closer to three mana if not less.
---
First player to go but I already had 2 mana; my mana emblem looks like a bad Photoshop; worst RNG luck with ultimate infestation killing my only taunt minion; c'thun battlecry killed his minions first then did face damage (leaving them with 1 health); no idea why second c'thun is 20/20 when first was 13/13 (copy from ixlid)
---
&gt; The original nerve wrecking situation is when he does this to you for 8 mana, not 10.
---
This was the original comment, he specifically says "does THIS to you" which implies mind controlling your deathwing. Which really doesn't change the aggravation levels if it was 8 mana or 10 mana
---
Flair is perfect
---
You shouldn't have chosen to skip to rank 25. The developers added the beginner mode recently (Rank 50 to 26). From rank 50 to 26, you'll face beginners as well but you also get a lot of free card packs. It's also an opportunity to learn cards and mechanics.

It's really only hated because it is the single most popular deck on ladder right now, and some people are just rather sick of it.

5/5/2  
---
It's not worth it to dust Thalnos for Zilliax since he never rotates. He sees a lot of play, so if you find ankther way to grt dust, do it.
---
Immune doesn’t protect against destroy effects, such as deadly shot
---
He has zap tho
---
What a journey
---
Better to restart. You'll get lots of free packs, face easier opponents and can learn cards and mechanics in a more forgiving environment.

Known bug, it doesn’t have to be whiz bang. It’s just when you complete the match as a shaman hero (hagatha or evolve hero). 
---
I’m gonna say it again, it’s a known bug, and blizzard ain’t gonna patch it
---
Most of the time, it's the player and not the deck. Your deck seems fine to get to r5 (any half decent deck can if piloted correctly) and possibly even to legend with a few tweaks according to the local meta. So before you starting investing all your dust thinking that will magically make you progress, I suggest you reflect on your piloting of the deck and improve from there.
---
Well atournament mode would help i guess ;).
---
But i think this sunbreddit could organise events with very lose and flexible rules. Where people can find people to play eachother with a specific ruleset and maybe screenshots for winratio and one needs a minimum number of games to qualify and only 3 times that one can play against the same opponents for points.
---
Or something

4/4/4 | Battlecry: Restore 4 Health.

A fancy yeti.
---
Yeahhhh... balance-wise you're probably right. This card would need work. I mainly used it as a vanilla example to illustrate the concept. Regarding the mana investment, though, you're still getting the primary benefits of that mana-expenditure. In a more control-oriented or mid-range shaman deck, it's pretty common to summon 4 to 6 totems over the course of a full game. That's my goal for these cards: You're still doing things that your deck is designed to do, but it adds the potential for cool swings if you plan it right. 
---
 Ah, a rare kind soul. Thanks!

Minus #1654 NA

80 gold quest. You go first 
---
With Druid too &lt;3 congrats!
---
I'd advise not crafting one until you have a specific need for a specific legendary. Until then, save the dust. It would suck to spend all that dust to craft a legendary you don't really end up using much or that doesn't have much impact on your deck, then finding yourself short on dust to craft a decent deck when the next expansion hits.
---
Play upside-down.  Problem solved!
---
Priest has always been the original, aggravating, nerve-wracking situation.
---
Switch hands! Problem solved! XD
---
“Don’t you guys have right hands?”
---
Maybe check out [the Wild Ladder Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASWu0kKeS74&amp;list=PLsSLgL3YHLzIDz8fKnWyKlihhmsFU706e) of the past weeks for some wild tournament coverage.
---
He's definitely played more than that...according to HSReplay he is the #1 most commonly played card in Standard, finding himself in 26.2% of decks. The next SIX most commonly played cards are all Hunter cards (Flanking Strike, Rexxar, Animal Companion, Kill Command, Candleshot, Hunter's Mark). Zilliax also has an excellent deck winrate (53.6%) and played winrate (52.4%). I'm not saying he's OP or should be nerfed or something but you're kind of underselling how good and how frequently played he is.
---
I'm amazed that Anduin's wow is still the Tier S emote in the BM meta even after year of hearing it.
---
&lt; Pointless comment
---
Don't count on it. 
---
Is left handed disabled now? Guess who gets to park in handicapped spots now
---
There are more mobile than PC players in Hearthstone
---
I wonder how the righties in this thread would react if the tooltips were flipped for everyone and they couldn't change it back.
---
personally, even though I did not find all the quest interesting, I found the conept of quests a good approach to give the game something unique. I would appreciate some new quests. Every mechanic that allows for a new win condition is worth a try. And quests in general have been OK - with a few exceptions. Hello, rogue quest - I'm looking at you.
---
😂
---
28% =/= 1/2
---
What exactly are these options and where do you find them? Also, does it work on android devices? I have a pretty decent acer tablet and it runs horribly. Thanks
---
That deck is one of the main reasons I'll never play wild. 
---
Best ideas from comments:
---
1. Play one deck that beats them
---
2. Wait 3 months for a chance of improvement
---
3. git gud lol
---
Can you do this on mobile?
---
It was overkill
---
That would be huge bm playing it right before lethal
---
That's like 6 months too late
---
Thanks, great tip. And if anyone else is having the issue where your friends list causes the game to freeze for a couple of seconds, try this: 
---
Head to C:\Users\"username"\AppData\Local\Blizzard\Hearthstone and delete the contents of the cache and logs folders.

Oops!!! - forgot that means it wasn’t made for PC! 😂 
---
Both 2 attack minions go into the STonehill, 3/5 hits the Voidwalker, everything else goes face and hero power....  
---
This is not really challenging. 
---
Playing for years now. Can't say I never bought packs but the last cards came from dust through playing. Feels nice :)
---
Welcome to the value town :O
---
Jesus Christ, I feel old. I read that in a Scottish accent, despite it having been like 18 years since that movie was released! &gt;\_&lt;
---
Really, I would love to see all of them being forced to do everything with their off-hand and see how annoying it is.
---
No, I was too busy saying that you're a longwinded dipshit that likes to hear the sound of his own voice and thinks his opinion is even vaguely relevant. I guarantee you, every complaint you're making here about microtransactions is analagous to one made about things the unnecessarily grindy nature of MMOs as compared to traditional RPGs (and even to text MUDs), or of the dumbing down of the strategy genre when RTS came along.
---
Your golden age was a dark age to someone else, and in both cases, games that conformed to your ideal of a perfect game were still out there, available to play, they just weren't as prominent as their adherents would have liked. That's the point. Now fuck off away and go do something productive with your life.
---
Beetle berries! My FAVOURITE! 
---
TRY ONE : )
---
To be fair Thunderhead is a strong card that'll be worth testing.
---
With druid in the current state of arena. Well done!
---
I'm not the one coding so I can't say. But probably harder than using your right hand
---
&gt;You would have to explicitly explain why new games are objectively shit, and old games the opposite, for your argument to float in the water.
---
I did, next time you should read my entire post before responding. My point is that games today are designed frequently with the intent of having predatory microtransactions, all the way in the design phase, and games 10+ years ago were not. Games 10+ years ago are also when they started to reach a level of quality that skyrocketed their growth and popularity, with games like CS:S, WoW, and Halo leading the way.
---
We wouldn't have our supermassive scene today if not for games like that, and my only point is if games like that today can be remastered and succeed it's a really really good thing for all of us.
---
You don't actually want games like hearthstone to become the norm, do you? Or do you think it's reasonable that games are dropping now with content gated behind $100s of dollars of microtransactions...? Genuine question.
---
Except warrior, they really only loose quest and reckless fury 
---
[removed]
---
Oh, definitely, it's already seen some play so i don't doubt it'll pop up after rotation.  Just was thinking it was too far off in name.
---
HS in your name without being a professional player EleGiggle

Mass Hysteria has been my favorite card this expac
---
Rank 25 attack into secret.

How do you rope in fortnite ?

Yeah can I have a small size of the spicy garlic traditional wings and regular order of potato wedges?

Oh cool, thank you for this.
---
Literally playable.
---
Could just be a box in options, maybe even in misc, noone would get confused with it
---
wait is that every card in the wild set? Dang
---
Cop: You can't park there.
---
You: Flips him off with left hand.
---
Cop: Sorry to bother you, sir.
---
this sub is about as put together as most other subgenera's circlejerks.
---
Another candidate is Thalnos.
---
Oh thanks :)
---
Why? Just attack with your worst minion or with a minion with good battlecry.
---
There is also anti-secret tech. There is a lot of interaction and it has never been a problem.
---
And I see that the highest winrate secret hunter deck doesn't even run freezing anymore. It runs snake and venom.
---
Clearly you're not using the...
---
...right hand.
---
I very nearly said Divine favor. It's a great card. Just when you think that murloc paladin was out of steam he draws an entire hand for 3 mana. 
---
Bonkers. 
---
And yeah I'll be really surprised to see Divine spirit last. It's a busted card and truthfully it's getting tiring having to play around it. The combo has been around too long.
---
how so?
---
Divine Favor doesn't limit design space, it's just a good draw tool, which paladin greatly needs. It's Baku that makes paladin good.
---
That is why you post the HA link...
---
A HA score is not reflective of the card quality by Blizzard's standards. Also HA score is just an arithmetic average of the individual raw HA scores.  From what I can tell, the deck has poor turn 3, 4, and 5 plays.
---
You know what, I'm going to give you five more minutes of my time, then I'm done. Pay attention, because this is you from 20 years in the future talking.
---
None of this shit matters. They're just games. They're diversions. They're things you do for fun, or should be. They're not worth arguing over. They're barely worth discussing except in a friendly manner with like-minded folks for chit-chat purposes, at least the types of games we're talking about. And they're certainly not worth getting worked up about. I know they might seem like that now, but the sooner you get that notion out of your head, the better off you'll be.
---
If you're willing to go into paragraphs-long dissertations about them, you are literally wasting your life on something that's never going to love you back. If you tell people to kill themselves over pop culture ephemera, you need to take a step back and look at your interpersonal relations in your own life and see how you are fucking those up right now, because I guarantee you are. Whether you're an argumentative shithead over a bunch of trivial shit, or you absolutely have to be right in discussions, or you're just kind of a misanthrope, or whatever, you are hurting yourself and others. 
---
And I get that you're not going to want to hear that from the guy that's repeatedly called you a shithead, but that's exactly who you should be listening to. Because it's a lot better to hear it from me, some dude that you don't care about at all, than from a girlfriend walking out the door, or a friend who just starts ghosting you because you suck or someone else in your life that matters to you, right until they leave it because they can't stand you anymore.
---
So I'm going to say this to you, then I'll probably just block you when you inevitably respond because you can't let it lie, because you must win: you aren't going to win this one. And this isn't winning. It's just losing in a flashy manner, and losing stuff that's way more important than an argument over silly games. Go be pissed off at me. Go stew. But also go change.
---
Good luck to you. I hope to never hear from you again.
---
I hate arena due to slow play so don't do it much, 515 total wins id estimate at ~55% win rate and been playing since 2015, but managed 4-5 12 win runs with at least half of those just disgustingly lucky draws vs amazing game play by me.  Can't imagine it would take that long to win 12 games, just dumb luck should have got you there way sooner.
---
Thanks man!
---
Good call. 
---
Saying “Wow” in the spirit of things is not BM. If he spammed it while roping then it would be.
---
You have been left handed for a while, adapt. I have never had a problem and I am left handed. 
---
Even more relavent when you remember that it used to only cost 8 mana.
---
Exactly, plus can come on reddit and complain about how every opponent is playing the same hunter deck.
---
I'd agree with that. It punishes mid-range decks the most. It's like well... I can't afford to lose any of these minions so I guess I'm capped at 3. 
---
It's too swingy.
---
Good thing I have a screen protector
---
Wild Growth: That cards sucks now, better to HoF it and revert the change.  
---
Mana Wyrm: Same as OP.  
---
Maybe Mountain Giant: Too easy to cheat it early in even warlock.  
---
What a garbage article
---
Right handed privilege
---
Buying or selling? Heh heh heh...
---
Miss most will be Radiant Elemental and Quests for Mage and Priest. I actually only have combo decks. Also, Minstrel and Kobold Illusionist will suck losing. 
---
I hate Hunter because of its fast nature so all the good hunter support cards leaving will be nice. 
---
You should know where to play a card by looking at the screen dumbass
---
Yeah, because even the minor cards like pact, taldaram, umbra, lackey, defile, they will all be history. I don't even know what he is supposed to copy with faceless
---
why is this downvoted when it’s true
---
What happened to the totem? Did you flood board so your totem had no space?
---
congrats!!  First 12 wins is super exciting, and nerve wracking
---
how many 11 wins did u get before this point?
---
coldlight wasn't in practically every deck. the reason they hof'd coldlight was because they didnt like neutral mill.
---
We're not saying they are disabled, just saying that the game could make the interface easier for them to use
---
Lots of lefties said it was easy, all they just had to do was doing this or that with their hands in positions that for me seem uncomfortable and I know I don't have to do these things because the interface favors me, just mirroring it is not that deal even for a small indie company
---
Is not like they can't play hearthstone or doing other things, but forcing them to adapt for things that are clearly not made thinking that they exist is really ridiculous
---
I'm most happy to see Spreading Plague go. There aren't many worse feelings in the game than your opponent's Spreading Plague completely turning a game around. 
---
The only answer
---
From what I remembered my opponent killed my whole board and then the snake triggered (which activated 3x) then the totem was gone. I still don’t know how I did it.
---
hunter spellstone. FUCK hunter
---
When you have a full board totem disappears 
---
Turn 7 Dr. Boom -&gt; BGH
---
Turn 8 Rag -&gt; Mind control
---
Turn 9 Sylvanas + shield slam -&gt; Mind control
---
Turn 10 Deathwing -&gt; Power Word Death
---
Turn 11 Esc+Concede -&gt; Well played
---
Are you a bot? You seem like a bot there's bots everywhere these days!!
---
And that’s actually really important since it acts as a check on extremely greedy decks that seek to maximize late game value or against combo decks that are dependent on stacking combo pieces in hand for several turns.
---
Wont miss Deathstalker Rexxar. My dear Malygos Rogue, though...
---
I'm not sure that makes for a very fun experience, tbh.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Eh, I don't get much of the card hate.  I get annoyed when I see the same card too often, but understand that's just an effect of repetition. If I had to say an individual card happy, it'd be Gul'Dan for the above reason. 
---
too confusing to new players 
---
Blizzard has literally said directly that Stonetusk Boar is possibly the single most design limiting card.
---
