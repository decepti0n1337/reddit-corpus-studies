Can confirm. Have played control warrior.

Same with mine.

Now I know not to open packs until I get golden Zayle. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Not many, but sun cleric wasn’t that bad back then. Priests had PWS. Pallies had buffs like they always do. While it wasn’t “omg I have to kill it before it is a 10/10!!!!” Patel could make some trades.

Not exactly.  You can dust your ordinary Zayle and get just 25% of the dust back which means you have lost 75% of a legendary.  You can dust your gold Zayle and keep the ordinary Zayle but you no longer get to play all golden Evil decks.  There is a reason people crafted golden Whizbangs.  They are more fun to play.
---
A fair result would be for Blizzard to offer full 1600 dust refunds on normal Zayle for the next month.

Either ladder requires a lot of games, or the rankings are volatile and nearly meaningless.  Legend ladder isn't just decided by the number of net wins you have like lower rank, 100 games at a 60% winrate will get you further than 1000 games at a 52% winrate (based on my experience at high legend).  A system that's willing to say 'oh, you won 10 games in a row, that's a 100% winrate so you're the best!' would be terrible.
---
Not entirely.  Discover cards are weighted at x4 for class cards.  That weight still applies to omega assembly.  So, yes they are random, but you are very likely to get at least one warrior mech, and those on average are good.  Specifically, dyno, devastator, and security rover are all good pulls.  I'd say the only "bad" class mech off that card is eternium rover.
---
Light the fuses!!!
---
If that’s good for f2p quality of life, then it would have been great for f2p quality of life 5 weeks ago.
---
if you used a deck tracker you'd instantly see all 30 cards as well.
---
works for whizbang at least.
---
&gt; Could be wrong, but I think it doesn't allow you to use the card yet. That's what I've been seeing in other posts about getting the card as well? I'm lead to believe that OP is lying for karma farming, but I could very well be wrong. Apologies in advance.
---
the other 2 post is talking about getting it from rng card that discover/grant random card.  
---
i think OP have a case similar to this person , where they open the pack and got lucky with it , this one got a screenshot 
---

---
He almost did it on turn 7
---
&gt; 
---
How did noone realize that? or is it really a mistake?
---
probably they forgot about it like how they forgot to disable whizbang in the custom brawl that have less than 30 card last time.
---
It works just like whizbang
---
Where'd they come from this early in the game? What does your decklist look like? I've been trying to tweak this archetype to make it go off more consistently because it's so much dumb fun when it goes off, but I haven't been having a lot of luck.
---
i'm curious though, whether this "resets" the pity timer for RoS packs.
---
Whuuuuat!?

I feel like it’s a bit of a mistake to not capitalize on the built in subscriber bases.  But I do get that they want to be able to moderate the chats as it’s happening.

Didn't work for you at Winterfell, did it

Most of them are actually kind of bad at Hearthstone.
---
Amazing!
---
Where could u originally get golden packs? Can I get them?
---
* Nope, the mobile and PC versions of the game are identical.
---
* The rewards depend on the mode:
---
** For the pre-2017 Adventures (Naxx, BRM, LoE and ONiK), you unlock exclusive cards (which can only be used in the Wild format and Wild TBs) like [[Reno Jackson]] or [[Emperor Thaurissan]] by completing each wing in Normal mode, and a special cardback for beating everything in Heroic mode. 
---
** For the free Knights of the Frozen Throne adventure, you get a free Death Knight card for beating the prologue, then a KotFT pack for beating each wing thereafter. Finally, once you beat each of the Lich King's class challenges, you receive an Arthas hero skin for the Paladin class.
---
** For each of the SP modes released from KnC until Rumble, you just get a cardback. Most require you to beat each final boss with each class or solve every puzzle, but Rumble Run only requires you to successfully complete a run with just one hero.
---
** For the upcoming Dalaran Heist, completing each chapter gives you three Rise packs (and unlocks new characters for the mode), while beating all five in Normal mode rewards you with a cardback, a Golden Classic pack (i.e. all cards in that pack are golden) and a golden copy of Zayle (the new Whizbang card). Beating all five chapters in Heroic mode will give you another cardback as well.
---
Hope this helps! :)

And give 1 pack to NA

I certainly can say the system doesn't work for my level of play.
---
* Rank 20-19
---
* Have lots of cards and have played since launch.
---
* Simply put i'm not very good at the game so I should be low rank.  I am not suggesting my rank should be higher.
---
For me to get 5 wins for the card back each season it takes around 15-25 games of play.  Always feels crummy when you play people who clearly are way better than you but simply only get their 5 wins each season and then stop playing.  Reset to 20.  Repeat.  For me most months I dont get the back because im at like 3-12 or something and just cant play anymore with losing to massively better players.
---
Controlling the conversation is naturally a priority.
---
Wait. How do i go about playing pre-2017 stuff? If you dont mind me asking. I see solo adventures but it ends at witchwood i believe.
---
So much to go through, which is great. Just have to learn the game nd get better. Ive had a hard time with the solo adventures i tries earlier haha.
---
In wild I've gone up against some mill rogues the past few weeks, and I thought I was crazy because it felt like their Nat triggered every time.
---
But winning is good, no? I mean, most of the time I read chat was "Return to Kripp/Trump"
---
Maybe I expected too much, but I thought Zayle might have some interesting twists in his deck. Like exclusive spells or minions. Pretty disappointed that they are just more of the same Recipe decks.
---
Can't they just stream eat from each perspective or something? It's so disjointed going back and forth and trying to remember like 8 different runs. It's a bit messy to follow.
---
If you go 9-0, that's a winstreak.
---
If it's turn 3 and you don't have a good play but you have two good 4 mana cards you can coin out one of them.
---
Yeah, same for me. Can't start a run after updating.
---
I remember watching apxvoid play basically that same 4 giant elemental miracle deck on day 2 or so.  It's not a new deck at all.
---
No spoiler tag?
---
It’s not a disconnect, it’s an animation bug. It’s been around forever. The only fix for it is to quickly reboot your client and rejoin the game.
---
I guess I didn't pay close enough attention, but if this gives you decks like whizbang, what's the point? It's it entirely different sets than whizbangs pool?
---
I saw something that said “Asset Download,” but when I touched it on the main screen, it didn’t appear to be loading. It was staying at 0%.

---
They *are* making it available after the event; as has been indicated on the sidebar for about a week, we can all play it in less than 40 hours.
---
The date indication is just a result of part thereof labelling.
---
No, I actually had Gobbles as a final hero. But maybe they fixed this later, so its in client only now? 
---
When I faced him, it was just the same deck with 70 hp. He easily milled himself to death
---
Or ya know they should just make the disenchanting returns so less punitive.
---
Lol Guinness is not the sole proprietor of world records.  They just publish a book.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Devs come out when a new expac is dropping and all of a sudden want to communicate.  They do a Q&amp;A but any legit question about balance changes, long term problems (not enough game modes, lack of epic duplication rule) they give a short and unsatisfying answer to, ignore or just say "cool! we'll look into it!". 
---
Then they dissapear and come back when another expac is coming to get people excited to spend money.
---
Really like this game but don't get your hopes up.  Would love to be proven wrong.
---
It's still Hearthstone, the casting is never that important.
---
I think its too early for the pitchforks. If this mode has the depth and replayability to stand alone as making hearthstone single player actually viable for a good couple months, I'll gladly pay the 20 bucks for that alone. The packs and cloak are just a bonus. 
---
I feel like approaching this as "what can i gain from this to go right back into playing standard" isn't really the intent, rather "here is a fun stand alone game mode that just so happens to give you something to do in contructed as well"
---
I won't be spending anything on this nor would I waste gold on it.  
---
Of course this is probably just minor stuff for Blizzard who are creaming it from packs and "expansions" where people are just buying more packs.
---
Well, the top 3 classes right now are rogue, warrior, and hunter. Most decks with those are doing pretty well- control warrior, tempo rogue, mech hunter.
---
They are actually. Unless Guinness observes it, it's not classified legally as a world record.
---
Why do I have to spend 2 mana on my sap??
---
I used to call a girl friend of mine gobbles. Not gonna say why.
---
Fucking hearthstone QA. It is atrocious their complete inability to keep consistent and intuitive rules.
---
Coming back to game after 2 years. Can anyone tell me top meta standard decks? or any decklist
---
Thank you very much
---
The shaman and warrior decks look quite good
---
But you actually can craft it. The 5 decks are tempo rogue, control priest, plot warlock, control shaman and bomb warrior
---
:)
---
Update this when the solo content gets released. We need to know if you can't dust golden zayle opened from packs
---
Not according to hsreplay. Control warrior literally has more 35-65 or worse unfavorable match ups than 65-35 or better ones lol.
---
Is anyone else me?
---
I also liked it. I guess they did not show individual streams to reduce the amount of spoilers while building the hype. Like this I just saw sneak peaks of bosses ect. But still have the chance to experience it first myself.

The way i understand it is, if you hit bottom of legend and keep losing and their isnt many people in legend below you, You will notice you dont lose many ranks if any at all, but you are still losing mmr. Though your legend rank doesnt change much, the system will still require you to win those losses back to a certain extent to start gaining normal points again.
---
Basically with regards to win conditions. Dragon Mage wins (usually) with Mountain-Khagar-Conjurers. Miracle can win with a Vex Crow, Antonidas, Questing, or Conjurers. Idk it just feels more fun to play to me as well.
---
Why yes, my hand *is* Cho, thanks for noticing

I have shirvallah's grace, the hunter overkill one, the warrior overkill one, and the priest tome one left. I found vengeance to be one of the better shrines, try to damage yourself as much as possible and end the game quickly. I really hope they notice this issue so I can have another go at it.
---
Small and indie company my friends, that's all you can say
---
I see no reason why Zayle's decks would be updated. Whizbang will always use the latest two deck recipes per class, even after it rotates out of standard.
---
It's intentional.   
---
After you beat the final boss with a hero you can get a random boss on subsequent runs with that hero AFAIK.
---
For the expansion beats classic? Yes.
---
You will slowly and steadily build up a collection of classic packs as you do quests and tavern brawls. Every year the classic set gets more and more out of date.
---
If you open classic packs, you have like a 1/20 chance of a good card. If you open expansion packs, you have like a 1/3 chance.
---
How familiar are you with the concept of the beat down?
---
It's just about being smart with what packs you buy with your gold and making sure you never skip your daily.

---
Yeah that is the hard part. I have just been using coin to get the latest packs but now I think I should open older ones too.
---
Warlock and priest look pretty bad. warrior seems okay, shaman and rogue probably one of the better ones
---
Still, With these dlcs they’ve managed to maintain it successfully and hearthstone is still popular with streamers (Amaz, Disguised toasts, Kriparrian and trump)
---
I like!
---
It was even more annoying when Kibler had to pick the treasures for kripp and trump and the screen did not switch to their screens so that kibler could see them, either the ones responsible for the streams were already asleep or it was just a program running in the background.

---
That's what I was hoping too. You said it perfectly "like you're playing the villain".  I thought each villain would get 2 decks and one of the decks would be a hard counter to one of the defenders.
---
Last I checked Corrupted Blood doesn't have rush.
---
That's cool love it when they nerf fun stuff that isn't that good /s
---
Yes this worked well. I was just wondering because it looks so small and it never said "checking version" before... As far as I can remember :-)
---
They suck
---
Again you are right, but I feel like you are missing my point. The problem is not about having access to Zayle in the long term, but timing of the release was screwed and that is something that has always been a sensitive area for the playerbase.
---
You call this a sabotage??
---
yeah with quests + weekly brawl you can average a deck a day or 2. 
---
very quickly you will get the 1 legendary in 10 packs...
---
I haven't dusted a lot. Just play suboptimal decks until I got something close to a decent deck and crafted the rest (mostly non classic or not in rise of shadow)
---
my aim is to focus on newer expansions so besides the minimum 1 legendary for 10 pack thing per set which I've done I am mostly doing classic and Rise packs.
---
I'm still waiting to get even common druid cards like mark of wild lol. Also hoping to get lucky to get Rogues preparation and legendary greenskin and Edwin
---
yes they are out
---
Was the event worth watching? I don't really have an interest in seeing them just spoil the content.
---
You can also play a deck with hemet 2x prep as only double and reno xd also you can use the tomb pillager to give you a coin. (it doesn't get hit by hemet xd)

Anyone else having a problem with rumble run not working?
---
Maybe you picked the wrong region. That is the only explanation that comes to my mind. As others said, packs were distributed like a week ago.
---
ROAD ROLLER DA!
---
On curve means you are able to play the card when you have exactly enough mana for it. You've already missed the opportunity to play this on curve. A two mana card is never "on curve" after turn 2. 
---
On curve stat's as you've defined it is not a useful term. We already have a term for what you are describing, it's Vanilla. This has Vanilla stats (with an upside in other situations).
---
WRYYYYYYYYY
---
I mean you also get 15 RoS packs and 1 golden classic pack?
---
Coincidence? I think not...
---
It's a no brainer in any case, they all but created bomb warrior for you.  
---
If you are serious about climbing beyond rank 5 though (cant say what its like for 10-5 anymore) you would not use a card like this that gives you a random deck as they will not all be great decks within the meta.  
---
We shall see if I'm right either way when nerfs eventually do come ... or they don't and the game suffers as a result. It's in a pretty bad state right now imo.
---
Yes
---
Or &lt;insert any player who values their time&gt; who doesn't want half hour games against a robot deck.
---
Yes they did, every other hero card got 2 years, why wouldn't those get it too?
---
I also don't agree, I don't care how easy or hard it is for them to create content.
---
HS is the most expensive game I know. I poured a truckload of cash in this game, I don't wanna hear any of this

---
Mfw
---
Fitting username.
---
The only reason I can think of is if you want to have a golden deck if your Whizbang isn't golden or to get a more consistent set of decks.
---
cant really compare 1 guaranted legendary +6 other card with 3 pack for 700 gold
---
Don't like outrage? Don't come to reddit. 
---
Seriously though, dude, this is Hearthstone. Our king is the Salt King. Our God is RNGesus. We are never lucky and we are one off lethal. And our packs are 40 fuckin dust. 
---
So please just let us bitch, them bricks are not gonna shit themselves.
---
How have people seen the entire adventure already? Have streamers already beaten the entire thing? Can you link me please.
---
Nnnnope, you don't have to choose between expensive control decks and cheap aggro decks.  There are lots of decks across every budget right now.  They're just not super obvious because the meta is still being figured out.
---
There's a big difference between Nomi Priest and Mech Paladin and Conjurer Mage and Freeze Mage and Miracle Mage and Dragon Warrior, and all of those except maybe the Mage decks can be made for under 5k dust, good enough to get to Legend with.
---
What big guys would you recommend?
---
They’ll just change out the cards that aren’t in Standard
---
Imagine this subs reaction to a blink fox!  It would be a meltdown.  In all seriousness though... incredible craftsmanship
---
He is just saying that it's not worth it for only the 400 dust... No need to be that defensive dude
---
What does that have to do with anything I said?
---
The E.V.I.L theme comes due to the cards from ROS and if I understood it correctly the next two expansion gonna have a similar thematic so they just could put in new and more fitting cards instead of the old ones.
---
Check out Brian Kibler's list, he recently made a video on it. You mainly want Mechanical Whelps and Spider Bombs, but Houndmaster Shaw works wonders in this deck as well.
---
I'm going to use an example stolen from another redditor. 
---
When you go to the doctor, he always asks you what's wrong, because you know it better than him. Afterwards, he tells you what to do about it, because he knows it better than you. 
---
Blizzard knows that adventure sales are down, but doesn't know why. In such a scenario, players should give feedback about it, and Blizzard figures out what to do about it.
---
You’re commenting on the quality of the adventure and I’m curious how/where/when you experienced on the entire thing
---
So if i get it with gold i get exactly the same that i would with real cash?
---
Not as pretty as those nails....
---
God I hate this argument so much. "If you don't like it, don't watch/buy/play it". 
---
This stuff is obviously important to many people. They've been playing for a long time and are invested in the game. They have every right to criticise it.
---
You don't like the criticism? *Don't read it.*
---
Yeah he said that to me. In reply to the comment you just replied to lol.
---
Happens every time for me on IOS
---
Lol damn.  Beat me to it!
---
I know buying packs makes sense, but I want to buy something I use almost every time rather than going through a slot machine for cards. I have gold for that.
---
You don’t need to experience the entire thing to have an opinion on it...
---
From what’s been added, what we’ve seen, and what we get with it, I made an opinion. 
---
Even if I didn’t see ANYTHING from the expansion, I’d have the same opinion. Feel free to refer to my comment again to go over it. You seem to have ignored almost all of it.
---
Every time I encountered him in dungeon run I left him with 1 HP so he just kills himself. I guess I am an evil man.
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be suprised if Pros could go 100% up to Rank 20. I’m a fairly meh player and I was able to go from 25 to ~18 on a new account before I lost
---
if you want to sample Hearthstone, I recommend you craft Whizbang. It will allow you to play 18 premade decks (randomly). You can get a taste of what kinds of archetypes there are and maybe craft your version of one of their decks.
---
The Kripp isn't a streamer. The Kripp is a life style.
---
How can you fuck this up? Just get a real randomizer, equal it to x and x%2 would do the trick, if its 1, draw, if 0, don't.

The content looks great, but it's literally the worst economic value in Hearthstone history. It is a shame that Blizzard decided to go for such a low value, and hopefully the sales will be low enough to change their future plans.
---
I think he meant that it works as Whizbang, but you're limited to Warlock, Warrior, Rogue, Warlock and Priest.

Wiedersehen#21161 trading 80g on EU
---
A personification allegory of my entire life.
---
Check the watermark, it's part of the set. It will rotate with ROS, it is part of the adventure that is promoting ROS.
---
You deserve it :)
---
Dude that's not a bug, have you seen the fucking thing? There's little that's more terrifying than seeing those black soulless eyes staring down your shitty Monster Hunt deck over and over
---
edit: also he sounds like a demon
---
Ohhh I love the rhino thing
---
I'm curious if it was something like 51% or 70% before.
---
An 8/8 followed by a 16/16 followed by a 16/64. Seems pretty good
---
There no region to pick, if u playing on more than 1 region you get packs on all of them
---
Either he didn't make a pick or did it on the wrong account.
---
&gt; as the phrase “vote with your wallet” exists for literally this reason.
---
That reason being that its repeated as meme by idiots who cant bother to think for even two seconds. Even your own argument being "its true because other people say so" pretty clearly shows this. 
---
The truth is that "voting with your wallet" is at best a bonus thing you can do and in general the most stupid option available. There's a million reasons why people might not buy something, beyond being able to afford it. Maybe the marketing wasnt sufficient, people simply didnt know about the product, maybe the price was wrong, maybe the content wasnt appealing, maybe the market shifted, maybe people are simply burnt out from frequent content or detached from content not being frequent enough. 
---
But somehow to people like you the only possibility seems to be "they'll look at a low sales number and will magically know *exactly* which highly specific thing is the problem"..
---
&gt; Blizzard didn't listen to his input so he felt betrayed.
---
His input was "Don't print Hunter Quest or it will ruin the game".
---
Blizzard was right not to listen to him.
---
I actually don't remember as I didn't play the deck myself, but it is a possibility there was no refill. But propably it was cleric circle
---
This looks great!!! Altho I wouldn’t make this spiral thing where the text is so deep, makes card kinda hard to read, maybe cut it out and and glue another cardboard directly underneath, maybe paint it darker
---
That doesn't really fit with his comment. Where is the sunk cost fallacy? Or are you just saying that being invested in a game is inherently a sunk cost fallacy?
---
You mean your going to have to pay to play the league of evil content in single player?
---
i think the single player content looks really good, i largely only play single player cus its way more fun
---
Dr. Boom, Mad Genius has some synergy, as it's a mech that spawns a mech.
---
No I'm not. That's how voting system should be used. But as you can tell from the vote count on my comment it is not.
---
If you buy the expansion you will also get zayle who is like whiz bang with 5 different decks plus it seems to be a very replayable expansion
---
Yes, thank you for that.
---
This culture of "lazy developers" has to stop. These guys are crunching their asses off.
---
For anyone reading, maybe watch Sean Murray's speaking about No Man's Sky at GDC this year:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3GaHQybtoU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3GaHQybtoU)
---
Dont like what other people are saying? Dont read it.
---
One strategy I do, I don't claim is the best, is buy packs from expansions from what I lack many commons and rares (since they are the most expensive to craft - considering the dust value of them).
---
I say like 100 gold saved for the next expansion, 100 for a pack from Boomsday (for example). If you open 40-50 packs from each expansion then you will have almost full collection of commons and most of the rares. It takes time...
---
Older players always save the gold for the next expansion, but since you are short of many cards maybe is not the best strategy now...
---
My problem is I like hearthstone and I love the single player content but hate the dungeon runs. Only one I could bare was witchwood because it wasn't a tedious long grind and had a somewhat story to it. 
---
I want to play the new one, I want the new card and the packs are extra but I don't see myself spending $20 for a game mode I'll never play and have never played fully.
---
Hopefully this dungeon run will be better, but I'll probably grab it slowly overtime with gold.
---
How is it not the same thing? Its exactly the same to a t. Both are complex systems that require a ton of trial and error to get right. 
---
"If it doesn’t sell well, it won’t be hard to see why" is a mindbogglingly impressive level of delusion given how many pieces of shit the gaming industry puts out and how much they repeat mistakes even in cases of major financial flops.
---
The same thing just happened to me all the bosses were still normal unfortunately. They just all appeared as gobbles on the preview screen for some reason.
---
False, it says "HEY EVERYONE, GET IN HERE!" in low Dwarvish
---
700 gold per wing, excluding the first.
---
Better value than the skins?
---
shame
---
I want thank the people that can buy packs and other stuffs. They keep alive this awesome game
---
That only applies to posts, and not every post is titled: I am going to rant about something
---
Nice of them to offer 3 free packs, i only got 2 for the tourney.
---
thx 4 trade
---
Oh, because they put the wrong watermark on a card that isn't part of the set, and included it in the set even though it's not part of the set, it's part of the set?
---
You could disenchant and open both C'Thun and Marin. C'Thun came out with WotOG.
---
Zayle comes out in a set that covers three different expansions, relates to three different expansions, can't be opened in RoS packs, and came out *after* RoS. It's a promo card.
---
The big problem here is that people complain about the silliest things here. "Golden cards should get a bonus" "Why is Warrior so good" "How can I make my deck better? (btw just started and have 100 dust)" This sub is so cyclical that a post like this was bound to be written and your response has probably been posted 1000x over. The original post is a bit whiny, but so is 90% of this sub so it's fitting.
---
Blizzard nerf card from strongest class please.
---
Did you both update to the newest patch? You can’t play someone on a different patch.
---
Agreed. You need to be vocal so Blizzard understands their flaws. However, you also need people like OP to keep the fans in their place too. If there is a ridiculous public opinion, like the one discussed in this thread, then the public needs a taste of their own medicine. I suppose it all creates balance lol.
---
They've decreased the amount of free packs and cards they offer from the new expansion compared to the past.
---
I play on Europe and NA and got packs on Europe only.
---
They do. Yesterday I filled a (very long) survey about Blizzcon Virtual Tickets, what would make me buy one, for how much, etc. that I got on an email.
---
The worst bit IMO is it is so game showy without any of the hype of a game show. Yesterday they made kripp and trump pop all that bubble wrap in essentially a quiet studio, it was just so boring to watch
---
Gobble gobble.
---
I done it like 6 times.. trust me, i know how it works.
---
Assuming you do the absolute minimum, you can get 50-70g per day. So you can get a 700g wing in about 10-14 days.

Have you been opening packs on a regular basis? I started playing right before MSoG and have gotten fair amount of golden legendaries from packs
---
They do take surveys. They send you emails on it(with your consent of course).
---
Surveys are one thing, but people can and will argue that the sample size is just way too small to be worth anything.
---
Exactly.  They can read sales figures, both via real money and in-game gold, which was entirely the original poster's point.   That has far greater meaning than any banter on message boards.

Glad to hear the game has lost another piece of shit.

&gt; Are you suggesting they install a live countdown in-game for the adventure? Do you feel like the extra UI elements is proportional to the value it provides?
---
Yes! and Yes! I shouldnt have to google something to figure out I've have been given the incorrect information.
---
Wow a huge update! The new content is live! The launcher has two Dalaran Heist tiles on it, I cant wait!
---
~watches download bar, cant wait to launch, launches game~

Oh, it's not live yet? Kill me. Available in one week, huh? Well, I kinda remember the release date being soon. I guess... I'll google this information to see if the UI is lieing to me.
---
Is that what you are saying is the right decision?
---
wow, really love this extra details.
---
I swear I read somewhere that you get it for free
---
Would be awesome if blizzard actually put it in the game

Fair enough. Yeah it would be better if they could broadcast individually, that would solve my issue with it!

Wait wtf you have to buy the adventure ?? Literally the only reason I was going to come back to hearthstone was to play the adventure mode. Money grabbing cucks. I don’t need packs or legendaries I need content.
---
[removed]
---
What kind of games do you play? I think that might be the crux of our disgreement. 5 hours is absolutely not normal. Really get the idea you've been buying games that are too far out of your interests that you've been so impressed by Dungeon Run and its clones.
---
Don't like complaints? *Don't read them.*
---
Wow. I would have been running him in every deck if I had known. Oh well.
---
They basically said, explicitly, that they won't be doing paid adventures and only paid expansions but SP content will now be free. This is them going back on their word, which honestly might make me mad enough to stop playing.
---
How is it the worst logic when it's literally how markets fucking operate? If you don't value something at it's price, then don't pay the price.
---
Exactly! It’s even better that it’s classic and neutral.
---
The real and true problem is one that hardly anyone here dares to talk about(besides myself who gets downvoted everytime for it).
---
People want this game to be more complicated, with more mechanics and more complexity. *Drumroll...*
---
They want this game to be **Magic: The Gathering**. 
---
There. I said it, and for the millionth time.
---
They want more keywords that force you to think hard on the board state. They want more things like being able to act on your opponent's turn, eg. countering your counter to his counter.
---
It has nothing to do with hating on Blizzard for its own sake(though plenty of people do that), saying things like oh the golden age of Blizzard of Warcraft 2, Rock N' Roll Racing are all gone so on and so forth.
---
HS is the ONLY game to date where people angrily come in here and justify their bile with "without negative feedback how will you ever get better". The evidence is laid bare right here on this subreddit. 
---
It's fun to be angry and complain, threaten to stop buying packs and suck them dry, say this and that.
---
Nobody wants to even dare entertain even the slightest thought of playing a different (and far superior) card game. People just want to hate.
---
Are people really casually making it rain $20s for virtual NON existing items?
---
Shassman and Warletass are two words I never knew I needed.
---
We'll definitely see Reno again.
---

---
That's just every brawl except for Pick ~~Two~~ Three.
---
If that's the case, I'm almost certain League of Explorers will have something to do with it since the 2nd expansion teaser strongly resembles Uldum and all that egyptian theme stuff and to me that's kinda the perfect place for explorers. We even had *very* similar place in the first wing of League of Explorers adventure if I'm not mistaken. That said, I have no idea if they will continue this "5 characters from each year of Hearthstone" trend, but I really can't think of any other Hearthstone character big and strong enough for such role, except pretty much everyone from League of Explorers.
---
THE SUPREME ORNITHOLOGIST!
---
I can't even start a rumble run anymore, client literally just freezes. That is not a small bug
---
How would a new Reno card be designed? Like a good callback to the original, but not just the same thing... hmmm...
---
How?

It was. And that is the point. The average reaction when something paid becomes free is usually good. But when that free stuff suddenly becomes paid again (and it wasn't a timed thing, like a giveaway), the reaction are, usually very negative. The average user doesn't care for business decision.

Well out of the 6 games it took to win, I knew I had lost by turn 3 in all of them. So if your the kind to concede thats not bad.
---
My point isn’t that “if you don’t like it too bad we like it like this”, the point is nobody is forcing himself to endure the fatigue when he can just as easily take a break until a healthier end of the game cycle
---
I would love to see some quote on that, because I don't feel like them explaining their business model for the foreseeable future is a promise.
---
You can do your own statistical test on it if you've got some time in your hands
---
Very easily. Typos and other mistakes happen when developing large systems and random effects are hard to test. I’m not saying there shouldn’t have been some unit test that caught this - there should have - but little bugs do show up here and there in big systems.

If Hearthstone had achievements, I thought a nice one would be having Hamm die to his own RNG.

Actually you made me look into this further, I assumed golden packs were handled in the same way Overwatch handles golden loot boxes. It doesn’t give a guaranteed legendary but it does give all golden cards.
---

Negative feedback doesn’t necessarily mean that is pointless rambling or a bad thing.
---
If people only responded with positive feedback then nothing will get innovated, fixed or improved upon because what Blizzard see that is everything is fine.

Yea yea, the typical stick "reddit its 90% of the player base therefor doesnt matter". Funny how despite that devs bother to do marketing, engage with the fans etc. in almost every game specific sub. To say nothing of constant bowing to community pressure and general acknowledgement of knowing the opinion of places like reddit by devs. Gee i wonder why, could it be that the % of playerbase doesnt mean shit?

Let's say i start saving gold the next day from the launch of RoS (starting from 0 gold). It is for sure 50-60 gold per day. Some wins here and there and it becomes 60g/day.
---
90 days between 9 april (RoS launch) and 9 july (next launch). 90×60=5400g. Some extra gold here and there you can easily amass 5500-6000g. I usually spend some in arena runs or random packs so i winded up with 4k gold for RoS.
---
If you buy the solo adv it is like how much 2100 gold? So you drop around 3.5-4k.
---
Blizzard fixing the game by literally making cards not function B)

Nearly lost an arena game during this period, put him down to get stats on the board and he just kept feeding my empty handed opponent. Luckily he actually lost to fatigue.
---
Yes, I love your dad
---
Same thing as now I'd assume the deck recipes which do get updated each expansion. He will just look more and more standard (within wild) unless they start making wild deck recipes
---
Because Blizzard is an Indie development team that cares about your player experience

---
Must feel really good to lose like that. I bet he was full of joy losing to a card that wasnt even in his opponents deck when the game started. The other guy OBVIOUSLY was just the better player.
---
it was there just last week, is there a setting i can adjust? It looks odd
---
Phew are you sure? After 600 posts since yesterday I'd like to hear more confirmation first.
---
Buy and open packs one by one. There is a guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs but you might get it in the 5th pack, or the 3rd pack.... Once you get it, move on to other expansion where you have no legendaries yet.
---
Does the back look like how I think it’s going to look like with the original cardback or is it blank? These videos of custom hearthstone cards, why do they never show the back?? It’s not that difficult.  Are they hiding something back there? Lol
---
 ugh I hate v.reddit it sucks
---
Well you can change euros in Russia so why not?
---
He had that insane winrate because he had played the game for almost a year against people playing it for less than a week. And artifact its a pretty complex game so of course he would have an insane winrate in that situation. Even then, he praised it firstly, then after some time he started complaining about the rng (heros going to random lanes, cheating death basically deciding games, bounty hunter...). The only thing that changed between "*artifact is clearly what i always wanted, not as random as hearthstone*" and "*well, those rng cards arent healthy at all for the game*" was his insane winrate not being as insane anymore once his opponents clearly started knowing what to do and how to build a deck. Either that, or he just changed his mind and decided that the game wasnt really that great after all the fiasco that was the launch of the game.
---
Older solo adventures also have wild cards to grab, but you need to purchase them from Blizzard Store with money .
---
&gt; "Golden cards should get a bonus"
---
why are you taking shitposts seriously
---
Actually you should probably value the golden pack at a lot more in my opinion. A normal pack usually contains 40 dust(4 commons one rare) and the golden one has a minimum of 300 dust. And that is the worst case scenario. 300/40=7,5. Now I probably wouldn’t value it at 750 gold but i would easily value it at 500-600.
---

I owe it all to my elite skillz

Oh yes, I will give it a chance as I stated earlier, but I still am not trembling with excitement over the release of the Dalaran's Heist. You've played dungeon runs 10 times more than any adventures? I think you're exaggerating. For example, take the time it took on average to clear Blackrock mountain (probably 2~3 hours) and multiply by 10. I doubt you've spent that much time playing each dungeon run, but I might be wrong. :\
---
Previous adventures were a chore too, all I'm saying is that if they presented us a new gameplay concept instead of the old one (like raid mode), it would feel less than a chore because it would be enjoyable for a while. I might have explained that poorly, but being good at explaining things has never been my strongest point. I hope you get the gist of the idea I am trying to deliver.

Stop talking out of your ass. My wife is a Physics teacher with a Masters in Education. I know what the hell I'm talking about. You don't. You have no clue what you're talking about when it comes to educating others. You're just too arrogant to admit it. All this makes sense to you, so you interpret that as that's what works for others. It doesn't. 
---
I cannot possibly express stronger that you need to stop. Stop acting like a big shot. Stop talking out of your ass. Stop trying to be some savior of the world by educating people that aren't asking for it. B/c I can tell you, for a fact, you don't know what you're doing and in the process of ignoring that advice, you're making the world a worse place for having you in it. That alone should be make any intelligent person sick to their stomach.

Intelligence is not measured by what or how much you know. It's measured by how much you're aware that you don't.

I love the irony. You're the first one to "QQ" by saying it was BS, and dare say QQ to someone replying to you saying it was how the tourney was setup from the begining.
---
People like you never cease to make me laugh.
---
Seriously?
---
Lol you sound like you work for blizzard
---
Now you're in real truble
---
da
---
Good thing that they fixed it, but I feel slightly cheated that the last 30 minutes earned way more than every other part combined. I understand the desire to keep it interesting, but I feel like they took it a bit far.
---
Barnes is the shit
---
As another F2P player, I was doing that too but was tempted by the packs. Holding at 1450 right now.
---
mods bi?
---
No legendaries for 2 expansions.
---
eyes are the most important
---
No, they just have the same crown which is a cosmetic in wow.
---
Wow. I come back to this subreddit once every couple weeks now. It used to be a daily thing. And nowadays, every time I come back, I am just more and more disappointed. Remember when Hearthstone was an awesome game? When adventures cost $20, were considered a standalone expansion, you would get every card in the set, and single player content? Seems like ages ago... This game died with Ben Brode.
---
Not sure how you're claiming so much more expertise over /u/sunyudai , but I think the point he's getting at is the seed value. Which might be more complicated than you'd first think, seeing as how Hearthstone has to run on tablets, phones, and computers. 
---
Which means you have to contend with each device's methods for sampling entropy, because a seed value has to come from *somewhere*. Just for example, [Android's Java random routine](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Random) shows how not-straightforward this can be.

You can add me as well, i play everyday

Top notch reference
---
The moment I read crumbling game about hearth stone I know the poster is just complaining to complain
---
Play arena. Best way to meet packs, then like it so much you don’t need packs
---
I don't understand how people are complaining they're not getting value out of the solo content with money. Spending $20 on packs in the store will get you 15 packs. Just looking at dust value, $20 for the solo content rewards 12 packs and a gold classic pack (min 300 dust). That's basically the same amount of dust as 15 packs.
---
So I guess people are complaining they're not getting pre-purchase bundles level of value out of their dollar.
---
My complaint is that it took them this long to release it and that it's coming out a week at a time.
---
And they broke ios gg small indie company
---
Update: Disguised Toast and Regiskillbin won!
---
When they announced the winners, I said out loud "ACTUALLY SCAMMED"
---
niiice. You can also do this in wild if you play Valeera the Hollow.
---
For F2P spending gold does nothing for their bottom line. My argument is that for people that are willing to spend money they are more likely to whether they pay for the solo content with gold or money. Only difference is they'll be giving Blizzard more money at expansion time if they choose to purchase the solo content with gold now.
---
I'm not going to hit the search button for you, man. Just search "gobbles". There have been at least a dozen in the past 24 hours.
---
Warlock with glinda is pretty good.  Echo on a 0 cost minion stays 0 so can fill board up.  Card draw is powerful here too.
---
please help
---
Updated one time only a year from now and not with each expansion. Whoopdie-freakin'-doo. It's still strictly worse than Whizbang.
---
I think they actually have. People talked about how certain quests have been removed since rotation which affects the average occurance (like old dungeon run quests and odd/even quests) in a previous thread like this. Anecdotal evidence for these things isn't usually enough to draw any conclusions from but if people have evidence for something not working as it should they shouldn't be dismissed out of hand necessarily because Blizzard has been known to mess things up in the past.

&gt; A preset deck with completely unique cards and an unspecified hero power. 
---
Dude, you seem to think that it has to be 30 unique cards and a completely different Hero Power.
---
That was never what was being suggested. It could be a preset deck that uses mostly Priest cards, with 2 or 3 unique uncollectable ones. Or a Warlock deck with a different Hero Power.
---
&gt; People were comparing it to adventure bosses, how is this not a whole different class; besides new cards being released there's virtually 0 difference.
---
Even if it were 30 wholly unique cards and a completely different Hero Power, that's still nowhere near comparable to a new class. A new class is *hundreds* of new cards that can be used in, like I said, countless combinations. 
---
Every card that is made for a preset deck **was made specifically for that preset deck.** It means you don't even have to worry about interactions with powerful neutral cards like Zilliax or Leeroy Jenkins. The design space is extremely broad because you are contrasting those cards only in relation to the 29 others.
---
That is far, far, far, far, *far* easier than a whole new class. I don't think you understand how much having the deck being *preset* makes it far more controllable.
---
now there are two of them!
---
Switching the view off of Trump as he was about to Mind Control an entire board of giant minions should be a crime.
---
having less decks makes things more consistent
---
Only fair after the lengthy paws for a recount.
---
Whole year you mean next 3 years cause holy crap
---
I just spammed loatheb till they died
---
Design your card and post it to /r/customhearthstone . Most of the time they will find better wording and correct your flaws.
---
Sounds good to me, if everyone uses that logic i should win 75 percent of the time by just not conceding.
---
I have this problem too, reinstalling dindt help :(
---
I don’t disagree. We relayed that feedback but there’s not much to be done when the moment is passed. Next time!
---
are you on mobile? it might have just been taken from that, they did some stuff to lower download times recently.
