Forest's aid is really strong. Hitting turn 8 with 2 in hand means your opponent needs to deal with four boards full of minions, and that's tough to do.

Soul can be an insane value if you get it off on 4 minions on more.

That's very good thinking actually. Thanks.

I‚Äôve opened about 75 Rise of Shadows packs and have yet to open either the common Druid buff or the common Mage freeze twinspell card. What are the odds of that?
---
That is because the rng factor of a card game, plus HS has the in game rng ( with discovers, random targets, etc...), it‚Äôs unfair to compare. In a basketball game, everything is on the players hand, or in a sc2 game. Changing a bit, if both of the number 1 and number 50 could choose the cards they are drawing each turn, the 90/10 proportion would happen easily.
---
The deck isn't a problem and is already dropping in play at high levels because of all the tech against it. Also, you can't ignore the cards you need to hold for Wispering Woods to "cheat" out tokens.
---

I played a Thaurissan, Brann, 2x Dirty Rat and 2x MCT deck once for maybe 50 games just to pull off the dirtiest combo of stealing 4 minions from your opponent. I'm sure the winrate was &lt;20% but it was totally worth it for that sweet pay off.
---
If you look to the top left of Kaza, you can see a priest sign. It swaps between the three classes.
---
As a guy who has been grinding away for the past week and hit legend today, here are my tips:
---
1) Pick one deck and stick with it. Learns the intricacies of the deck and beat other decks in the meta. Even your counters are beatable with the right knowledge.
---
2) Study matchups. See above.
---
3) Think out your plays before you play them. Don't autopilot. Try to think at least a few turns ahead.
---
4) Win more games. The difference between a win and a loss is a 2 star difference. A 5% increase in winrate is an extra 10 stars over 100 games. 
---
5) Regardless of what you play, know the rogue matchup well because they are the majority of the meta.
---
Good luck.
---
I like firebat analysis
---
They changed it, so the sets available are a select few that include some wild and some standard sets.
---
The newest set will always be in the pool, and the rest of the sets available will change once when a new expansion drops, and again halfway between the newest expansion and the upcoming one.
---
Hope that made sense!

&gt; With Rise of Shadows, the Arena will start a regular rotation of available cards from both new and older expansions. To kick things off, the available cards will have a decidedly‚Ä¶ E.V.I.L. theme. Here‚Äôs which sets you‚Äôll have access to when choosing cards in the Arena, starting April 9:
---
&gt; -Basic
---
&gt; -Classic

Regardless, language evolves. The English language we speak today is the English language we speak today. We don‚Äôt speak the English language of half a century ago.
---
You're using a rather weak deck. Mech Hunter has little chance against Rogue or Token Druid. You'll never reach legend if you can't beat those two.
---
I'd recommend the other Mech Hunter list, Bomb Hunter. It's legitimately good.
---
It's not a complete impediment. Blizzard can license the design from the copyright holders, provided they can come to an agreement.  
---
Copyright protection allows the holder to exclude others from using their material but doesn't force them to exclude others. So the rights holders can enter into agreements to license out their works. That's how you get crossovers, board games, figurines, and pajamas. 
---
Alternatively, Blizzard can just infringe the copyright and wait for the holder to initiate court action. They'll definitely be in the wrong, would likely have to remove the card back, pay for the use possibly at an exorbitant rate, lose their reputation amongst other development studios and be called hypocrites whenever they try to enforce their own IP, but this route is still open to them. It's just highly inadvisable.

And even against aggro is just a luck thing. If you get off your giant early enough and you get the taunt any aggro deck loses, so theres that.

*Cue the spot the lethal music*
---
I think ruthless competitiveness is the driving force behind both his line up and his running afoul of the HCT rules. 
---
With respect to HGG, there were some thorny issues involving culture differences and language barriers (i.e. the rules were in English.)
---
To reiterate what happened, the broadcast delay was insufficient to prevent access to in game information during the same game, allowing Roger's team to know that MC Tech had been tracked away. This information was gained through a method external to the game client. 
---
Now the operative question is kind of cultural: is the information available to every viewer through the Tournament stream fair game? Based on the rules, the answer is no because it's ghosting. But if English isn't a language you're proficient in, it's understandable how it may be confusing. So I can see that they might not have knowingly cheated. 
---
However, based on the pauses and ellipses in the video, there is obviously a moral intuition amongst the team members that what they were doing is gaining an unfair advantage through a method that is shady. So even given the mitigating factors, I think the HGG team was appropriately disqualified.
---
Roger also participated in win trading by attempting to queue into his friend Reall and deliberately losing to him in order to get Reall enough HCT points to qualify for a tournament. At that point, Roger had already qualified, so he didn't need additional points.
---
Once again, the rules are explicit that win trading is unacceptable, but given the language barriers, this may not have been obvious to Roger at the time. If I was unable to read and understand the rules, it would not be immediately obvious to me that win trading constitutes cheating.
---
For both incidents, I can give him some slack for trying to gain some competitive advantage and not knowing the rules. However, his threshold for just how far he will engage in gaining unfair advantage is somewhat more ruthless than what I'm generally comfortable with. 
---
As a result of being involved in both of these incidents, he's barred from next year's Grandmasters Tournament, which is equivalent to the HCT World Championship. That's his punishment, and I think that's fair.
---
I think his ruthless competitiveness is also the driving force behind his line up selection. It is all in on anti-warrior, based on his insight that most players will bring warrior and rogue. So that's excellent tournament preparation from someone clearly obsessed with winning.
---
Cause it is a basic spell
---
It‚Äôs above the waist, so it doesn‚Äôt count.
---
no
---
I thought about this alot. Alternatively, you could run mechathun, get it out early with Coffin Crasher. Then, after it dies, you can play Undatakah (8) and just 2 of the Zero cost spells to kill the Undatakah.
---
Gj!
---
Literally just saw in HCT that Sea Giant gained Rush from Carpet because it was 1 mana.
---
The art of Bite depicts a druid biting an abomination. Does that count?

Oh, an OK pose. thanks haha

To make those trades you would need to have board presence. The thing you said you didn't need.

Dies hard to two decks that are way more popular than it; Odd Pally and a Rogue build I don't know the name of, but is Kingsbane-centric with Pirates.
---
I've yet to win vs any Rogue, but do ok vs Paladins.  And, of course, it's a roughly 50/50 in the Mirror, depending on your tech.
---
Who won? I fell asleep lol
---
Or just use a reasonable enough spoof. You would be surprised what you can get away with
---
Nerf Rogue and all those Hunters, Paladins, Mages, Priests, and Druids can stand a chance. Warrior's popularity is caused by Rogue yet so many classes counter Warrior but gets shafted by Rogue.

Late comment on this post, but this is absolute bull!

It just happened to me in my final fight, and I would have won for sure if not for this. Note I haven't finished yet, and it sure sucks to have it stolen away by a bug...
---
I just started consistently laddering in ranks 1-5, and part of the reason I gave up on getting to Legend last month is these disconnects make an already time-consuming, frustrating process even more time-consuming and frustrating. I‚Äôm a parent, a teacher, and a grad student, so playing on my PC is rarely an option. If I‚Äôm getting to Legend ever, it‚Äôll primarily be through mobile, and I can‚Äôt/am not willing to do that if every 4th or 5th game will be a guaranteed loss by disconnect.
---
I‚Äôm also pretty certain people have figured out how to abuse the reconnect feature even when it works. I recently reported one very suspicious disconnect after I had a fairly commanding lead and the proceeded to disconnect 3 or 4 times in a row. I came back on my opponent‚Äôs turn at 1 life with no cards in deck, and the board state was such that it seemed pretty clear that he played around a bit, as if he knew he had time (he was all but guaranteed dead in 1-2 turns). It was waaaay too convenient to be a coincidence.
---
Both ends of this system need massive overhauls.

Well basically everything. Seeing as token druid basically has only one game plan, no matter the match up or state of the board or what their opponent does.
---
So if you think of interaction as they should adapt their gameplan to the state of the game then yeah there is no interaction. 
---
But if you view interaction as your opponent can actually do something and play the game. Token Druid allows that too, even if they themselves are incredibly linear.
---
Token Druid doesn't come even close to past decks like freeze mage, quest mage and arguably pirate warrior and old school face hunter where you basically didn't get to play the game because they either played nothing and didn't allow you to play anything either or played things that literally ignored whatever you did/could do and smack you in the face (unless you played a taunt)

I personally enjoy playing against bomb warrior. The whole delayed bomb effect I find is really fun, and it‚Äôs hilarious to watch an enemy hope for me to draw a bomb while I‚Äôm on 5 health and I have lethal on board. I don‚Äôt think the deck is ridiculously OP or too RNG based. Definitely my favourite deck of the expansion, both to play and play against.
---
&gt; On WowWiki, Medivh's character class states the following: Archmage, Diviner, Sorcerer, Mage, Sorcerer, Wizard and WARLOCK.
---
A couple of notes about this. First, don't use WoWWiki for lore: WoWPedia is a better option. 
---
Second, WoWPedia agrees with you and I'm not using that first point to dismiss what you just said.
---
Third, class identity is a very, *very* fluid thing, especially between some classes, and it's only in games like Hearthstone and World of Warcraft that the *player* character is restricted so.
---
&gt; So this could confirm that Medivh indeed wields Shadow/Fel magic. 
---
I have no doubt at all that as one of the most knowledgeable Guardians of Tirisfal and one who was possessed by the leader of the Burning Legion himself, Medivh was indeed *capable* of wielding at the very least Fel Magic.
---
But what you are capable of and what you use are two different things, as a hero in Warcraft.
---
Take Tyrande's hero portrait. She is a skilled marksman with millennia of experience, but she wields no bow. That isn't her representation in Hearthstone.
---
In the novella "A Good War," Malfurion Stormrage was annihilating officers *and even Varok Saurfang* in straight melee combat. Malfurion Stormrage is not a warrior in identity by any means, but that doesn't mean he doesn't possess many of their skills.
---
Anduin Llane Wrynn is a Priest of the Holy Light, but wears plate armour and wields his father's sword, Shalamayne, as of Battle for Azeroth. He is, to many people, "obviously a Paladin." But he has been *explicitly* stated to continue to be a Priest by the "[Word of God.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod)"
---
There are other instances if you'd like more examples, but hopefully I've made the point clearly enough here.
---
&gt; He calls himself the Guardian as well here, and calls the Kirin Tor fools. Perhaps mocking the Kirin Tor for not properly using magic, magic that he could use to stop the endless waves of attacks on Allianced cities.
---
Did you read my comment where I go into "some detail"? A relevant point from that was Aegwynn teaching Medivh the need for secrecy. She distrusted the Council of Tirisfal deeply. They had driven her to isolation for literally centuries, and they were a clandestine sect of the Kirin Tor.
---
It's not a difficult speculation to make that some of Medivh's heavy-handed power posturing in his trailer is him being resentful of the organisation.
---
However, a pure Medivh isn't foolish enough to dismiss the actually wise counsel of a greatly respected mage order "just because."
---
A pure Medivh also isn't ignorant enough to forget his Guardian powers and how much more capable he is of wielding magic than other people, even exceptionally skilled magi. Check out [Khadgar's Harbingers episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW5IYrgOgYU&amp;t=) for an example of how an Archmage with literally decades of experience, including apprenticeship under Medivh and studying at Karazhan, regards the powers of a Guardian with awe. Khadgar is literally described as one of the most accomplished mages in Azerothian history, and a mage of the highest calibre. 
---
Heck, the reason the Guardianship occurred in the first place over 2,000 years ago was because the Council of Tirisfal realised the need for a unified centre of their power. Aegwynn knew well enough herself that [some opponents would be unbeatable if you could not combine such might with such single-minded fury.](https://imgur.com/yyTEGJ8)
---
So yes, I would agree that the seriousness and brashness of Medivh in his Hearthstone trailer, coupled with his in-game description, indicates that he is still possessed. He still has that darkness. But he is consciously *himself,* like you suggested.
---
But it would likely only be through the negative internal influence of Sargeras that Medivh would be *willing* to wield shadow magic as depicted in Hearthstone.
---
Much the same way that Illidan chooses not to wield the arcane once he became a Demon Hunter, despite being a skilled sorcerer. 
---
Or the same way Drek'Thar would *never* go back to using the fel now that he has become a shaman again. There's no practical reason he couldn't.
---
Or the way Archbishop Benedictus refused to dabble in Shadow Magic prior to his, er... corruption.
---
I enjoy everything except for Wizzbang decks. I like playing against people's actual collections and seeing what quirky additions they have due to card limitations
---
I'm not even sure how much of the games audience would even get the reference. 
---
Not sure if it's worth.
---
Although I would say less is maybe gramatically incorrect there, it looks better with the usage of "less response" afterwards, because the repetition gives a nice emphasis to the text, so there's some justification to use it.
---
Not that it really matters anyway, the meaning is quite clear.
---
And that's a shame
---
Yes. Thanks for the clarification.
---
You get 1 ROS pack for watching/ afking on the channel for 4 hours, 1500 players get a classic pack which is randomly distributed ..
---
Are you sure it wasn't a Witchwood pack which is a login reward every gets due to celebrating the HCT World Championship?
---
Yeah that's what I've been using too. It's also the same one being used on the broadcast, or at least looks like it.
---
It really seems like it no longer has the 50% appearance penalty anymore, cannot remember a single warlock that didn't have it, many had 2
---
The rules don't apply anymore. Strange times.
---
me too mate LOL
---
It‚Äôs only just 1 RoS pack from 4 cumulative hours of viewing HCT. It‚Äôs not a daily thing.
---
The daily thing is the chance at classic packs they are dropping during the streams.
---
Wow. You sure know a ton about WoW lore. I now have a better understanding about Medivh and classes in general. Thanks for discussing it with me :)
---
Roger was just super unlucky with the Brawl. First it was 25% with Silver Hand staying and then 20% with complete disaster. That was just sad
---
It works off of damage dealt by the minion. Pretty simple.
---
Because he is?
---
And when is the 1500 thing being distributed? Just for watching once? Or also for watching for 4 hours? 
---
I heard its once per hour, i assume that is wrong then?
---
Whelp, I guess I was bugged somehow, hoping for better luck tomorrow.

The Acolyte draws cards an an intrinsic ability and thus contains every other card in your deck as part of the soul of the card.
---
Nice
---
Damage is still being done. Thematically, it is a bit confusing, but slight flavor failures aren't uncommon in any card game.
---
Mind sharing your list? I'm curious to see what a non control Warrior deck looks like in this meta.
---
I love playing against Tess rogue, if I‚Äôm at a floor and my opponent is playing it I‚Äôll let them pop off before going all in. I generally play agro so it results in me losing,  but I‚Äôm at a ranked floor so it doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
You need to complete 4 hours total for the day's broadcast to be eligible for the ROS pack, not sure about the classic one ..
---
add the last part to the link
---
More exactly he keeps stacking them everytime he is played, but never loses them.
---
Stop, you're making us over at r/hearthstonecirclejerk  seem completely useless.
---
Try crafting whizbang. Very good starting card
---
his teammate gave him information about his opponent's hand from a delayed stream of a tournament game he was playing in. afaik there is no evidence he asked for the information and idk whether it influenced his play but no one seems to care about the answer to that question they just want to get on their moral high horse because he didn't report his teammate for giving him the information which is ridiculous because it's something literally no one would do.
---
There is **one** pack for 4 hours total. And a **chance** for classic packs every hour.
---
Nothing else. If you got your RoS pack that's it. Unless you get lucky. The guaranteed pack is after 4 hours.
---
I've seen them recommend a second boom toss.
---
Yep it's once per hour ..

Are you sure that you have linked the correct account on Twitch? Maybe cause they have to distribute 50k+ packs it could be staggered ..
---
I don't know why but this got a legitimate lol out of me
---
&gt;And yes, you see it less now, but just because a problem appears in 5% of the games rather than 10%, doesn't mean it's fine. It just means you see the problem a bit less.
---
im sorry i thought "none" was a flair so i put it as that since none of the others describe the post accordingly my bad obv its not a flair
---
it existed way before that that as a silly game where if someone looks into it you get to punch them on the shoulder
---
It's daily .. I received one ROS yesterday (with twitch notification) and one today (no notification) ..
---
Twitchchat is losing it's mind about packs. Are you supposed to earn packs by watching?
---
I usually leave when my opponent BMs me during the game.

The packs are usually awarded one or two weeks after the event has ended.

Hum, It‚Äôs a tricky question actually, maybe you should tell us which deck(s) you plan to play with, look some tier list (they might change in the next weeks since it‚Äôs unsettled, but we have an idea at which one are efficient). Get a look at those decks, see which legendary/epic they need, and open packs in order to grab most of those card out of the packs :)

Dane and Sneed's.
---
That's a huuuuge challenge, I'd say impossible: tier 2 decks would be among the ranks of bomb warrior and zoolock right now. Pogo rogue as a concept is simply too flawed to be that good. It takes off way too slowly, in a class that has way too few control tools, in a meta where playing big boys in the lategame isn't even gamewinning. Pogo Hoppers simply can't be your gameplan if you want a tier 2 deck, but if you don't go all in on Pogo Hoppers, they get even worse, so it's not even possible to make a deck and then slot in Pogo either.
---
Bomb warrior is definitely favored not 95%, vS has Bomb warrior at 58% in 600 games.  His hunter/paladin felt like 95% favorites since they had massive value and inevitability with undertakah. 
---
The casters were talking about the matchup coming down to the health tiebreaker in case of a draw which would favor Roger, but it usually never gets to that point. Someone eventually pulls ahead from the mechs they discover or the cards from Elysiana. Bloody also has a Harrison and 2 weapon projects for weapon removal. Control warrior also has a surprising amount of play as the beatdown or "tempo face" deck once you get Doctor boom and Omega assemblies.  
---
I'm not saying Roger wasn't favored in that matchup, but it wasn't nearly the guarantee that the other matchups were.
---
Darkest Hour is arguably worse because it only clears your side
---
The first night I got a RoS pack after 4 hours but last night I got nothing, even after leaving the stream up all night too.
---
The random nature of the Big Red Button as a hero power allows each individual hero power to be a bit stronger in the same was as Hunter's Animal Companions. 
---
If Blast Shield was the only Hero power for Dr. Boom, Mad Genius, I would be inclined to agree that it is too strong, but since the hero power changes every turn and never the same thing twice, you will be gaining less armor per turn on average than Armor Up.
---
The same can be said about how Dr. Boom is "infinite" value. It's only one-fifth of a card per turn on average, something that will rarely break the back of decks outside of the control mirror, and cards like Hagatha the Witch and Archivist combos also offer similar if not great amounts of long term value.
---
Yes, it may allow mechs to pull double duty as removal, but most mechs are fairly weak on average and Dr. Boom himself is a MASSIVE tempo drain when played, and if that's the issue, making the strongest mechs, Dyn-o-matic and Omega Devastator, weaker and reducing the value gained off of Omega Assembly is far more productive.
---
Irrelevant in todays meta. 
---
Ragnaros' random fireballs were game changing and altering in Vanilla Hearthstone when Him, Alexstrasza, Baine, and Sylvanas were almost in every deck.  
---
There are far, far stronger players in Hearthstone than dropping Ragnaros. Without odd mage, he will basically never come out on Turn 7 and so is almost always dropped later in the game. Ragnaros does not have the same power level he once did, and the game is more random than it once was. 
---
Jan'Alai isn't even a top 5 legendary from a top 5 class. It's not unfair in any  way except that 8 damage is too much to ask in my opinion, it should be 6.
---
No. The alt-right is a term created by nazis to not sound so bad. Personally I like it, because it gives me more variety when I write. I don‚Äôt think the majority of conservatives are alt-right, I don‚Äôt think Trump is part of the alt-right either. I‚Äôm talking about literal nazis here.
---
Ooh, Goolden Booomb!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Elysiana got banned from future events. This is the exact same logic that MtG used when they banned Krark-Clan Ironworks from Modern.
---
Yes, that would be fair. Doctor Boom generates a huge amount of value from nothing.
---
This is what you get for not bowing down before the god of death/rng. Now thank Yogg for letting you keep your deck at least
---
It's a bit cheating when you've tanked your casual MMR so hard you're playing against a shaman who puts Thalnos and sea gaint in the same deck
---
Yeah but now it does have that context. Not nearly to the same extent as for example the N-word, though. We‚Äôre not actually ‚Äúfalling‚Äù for it, but we don‚Äôt care about keeping out culture so we‚Äôre just going along with it, because otherwise they‚Äôd actually be wasting our time, instead of just wasting theirs.
---
Trying to force an archetype in arena draft is not the way you want to do it. You want to draft the best cards in the beginning, then view each pick in relation to what you had already to determine if you want to play aggressive or responsive
---
 I miss casino mage FeelsBadMan
---
what is it?
---
Is batterhead useful in this deck? I really liked playing earlier versions with lighting storms for more anti aggro..
---
Yeah... Omega Assembly and Dyn-o-matic with charge is just absurd. It basically means warrior constantly has board advantage.
---
The problem with pogo rogue isn‚Äôt value, it‚Äôs surviving
---
How is one-fifth of a card per turn on average "a huge amount of value?"
---
*Most decks can be completed against another player*
---
You might be having that feeling because the game **is** telling you something!
---
Btw the Title is a reference tob
---
It never left T1 lol... The core parts that are keeping it functional won't rotate for at least another year and they're still printing new token generators that allow it to stay relevant. Savage Roar is part of why it remains so good.
---
You have to starve a troll by not feeding it.  All you have to do to win is not take the bait.  Do you really think an effective response to the New Zealand shooter making the OK hand sign is to say ‚Äúwhelp, we can‚Äôt do it anymore, it‚Äôs over, burn all the pictures, edit it out of all the movies, write lots of articles about it, warn our children for future generations...‚Äù or just ignore it?
---
It wasn't wintrading by definition, as there was no trading involved.
---
He conceded one game versus a friend on ladder, that was the extent of the "win trading"
---
no your options are to be a cheater or to disregard the information and make the play you would consider optimal if you didn't have it.   
---
in any situation where a delayed stream can give information that will improve your chances of winning your opponent is probably watching it and you're only putting yourself at a disadvantage by not doing so yourself. it's 100% on the organizers to make it impossible for anyone to gain that advantage if they want a fair tournament. it's cute that you're so proud of being a good boy who would never cheat that you need random strangers on the internet to know about it tho. have a gold star.
---
&lt;3
---
The title is a reference to trump's Hearthstone Channel
---
On his intros he says "(The)mad man!"
---
So yeah
---
I mean Rush and value trade
---
He was barely ahead on board. He could have taken it as a get back in the game card in case he does fall behind.

Fairly sure that's just the WizzBang deck.
---
While possible, that would cost the Shaman 10 mana, leaving an empty board.  The rogue would play a 2 mana 35/35, 2 mana 37/37, 2 mana 39/39, 2 mana 41/41, and a 2 mana 43/43 the next turn anyway.
---
While interesting, it's also pretty weirdly executed; you're doing worse than tempo rogue, but making use of its core to perform decently. Personally, I think the azerite elementals and Malygos simply don't fit an otherwise tempo oriented deck. Having kobold geomancers and myra's seems much better.
---
Yes, but this is just how thijs is. I guarantee you he did not do this on purpose.
---
Works okay with deathrattler decks. The meta is too fast right now though, so I'll agree. Much too slow. I just love the card lol...
---
The Rush aura the card has is definitely a big part of what it can do, which is why stuff like Omega Assembly, Dyn-o-matic, and Omega Devastator really ought to be changed seeing as they're each already very strong cards on their own each pushed over the edge by Dr. Boom, who is comparatively weak on his own.

\# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
this one is the spirit package I have been playing for 2 days, only to counter warrior and shaman. It auto loses against rogue and murloc shaman tho. Against other aggro decks its a bit draw dependant but if you pass turn 7,8, it should be easy.
---
replace spirit package with northshire and you ll have a more usual deck, but northshire kinda sucks in all matchups so far.
---
None of the shaman deck recipes use either Thalnos or Sea Giant
---
I'm trying to prove it, but they call me a crying baby
---
1. In HGG, his teammate, Shaxy, sniped the stream and see that their opponents' Mind control tech was discarded by Tracking. He and other teammates knew that but still used this information. Their team has got disqualified for it.
---
2. He "wintraded" with Reall. He gave Reall a free win on ladder. Both were banned from grandmasters for one year.
---
Although what he did is definitely wrong, I have to say that he isn't as despicable as everyone considers.
---
next level post
---
Oh my god, charge your phone, I can hear its screams.
---
Do you know the drill?
---
It should always transform into a 1 mana minion, since the 0/1 frog token costs 0 mana
---
I don't think anyone is saying some aspect of Omega Devistator or Dyn-o-matic killing multiple and often sizable minions for four or five isn't overtuned. Most are trying to get the idea of either there are worse things to worry about or that there are other, better cards to change than Dr. Boom.
---
They said it in the [official contest rules](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/pf/PFSFZ6VSCEDA1555511484565.pdf) that were linked on the news release:

---

---
Pick the non-golden for sure. Don't give him the benefit of seeing his bomb animation.
---
Using 3 spells just to kill mechathun means you are going to be dying alot anyway with that many cards that you cannot use for cycle. What is funny is I haven't seen much Poly lately (only hex).
---
Yes, that doesnt say that is only limited to 1 for the whole thing, only that its at 4 hrs.
---
I thought I was done with RoS packs but today I decided to open one more and bam! https://i.imgur.com/21avDBy.png
---
Players are limited to a single guaranteed pack. They are giving away 1500 classic packs per hour, so there's a chance to get more by watching. But the odds aren't good.
---
Thank you Raiding Party, for making this sort of thing no longer an all-inclusive play.
---
And get steamrolled by the Rogues
---
Forbidden Words or Mass Hysteria deals with the 4/4s.
---
Deathwing loses to Mass Hysteria or Deaths (which Miracle Priest doesn't run).
---
Zilliax loses to Forbidden Words and Pain (which they don't run).
---
So best option will probably still never be Millhouse. Not with the current most popular Priest list.

Turns out the dumpster is deeper than the Mariana Trench.

The warlock echo one.
---
Jepetto is actually pretty decent in arena. It's 8 mana summon a 6/6 and draw two 1/1s. If he has a few good deathrattles or battlecries in the deck, both of which are plentiful in warlock, then Jepetto can be insane.
---

Skulking Geist is the exception to the normal behavior. In general, effects care about the current value, not the base one.
---
Lol but isn't shadybunny notorious for mass-retiring arena drafts?
---
Keep in mind that you will need some dust for next year's Hall of Fame.
---
And that's what they want. Some of the most powerful decks were those with random card generation. Either minions or spells. Look at Lackeys. Get random spell, get random 2 drop...look at Crystalsong Portal in Token druid...Underbelly Angler in Shaman...Messenger Raven and Power of Creation in Khadgar Mage...Rafaam in Zoo...
---
For normal ladder matches skill is probably the least important thing at this point. It's luck and more luck. If the opponent doesnt know what you have he can't prepare for it. 
---
Not sure why they think that this direction is fun or anything...but they are pushing it hard for years and that won't stop ever.
---
Mirror matches in most games boil down to whoever does what the deck wants to do the best wins.
---
Aggressive mirrors always degenerate into "who can outrace the other?"
---
Tempo mirrors always degenerate into "who can get their board to stick better?
---
Midrange mirrors always degenerate into "who curves out better?
---
Control mirrors always degenerate into "who can get the most value out of their cards?"
---
Combo mirrors always degenerate into "who can get to their win condition faster?"
---
Zalae only plays top tier meta decks. His video didn't think about the game as a whole. Recurring Villain is quite good in arena, especially with pally. There are so  many buff that I've even had one come back 5 times in a game. There are so many buff cards that you may have drafted (sound the bells, defender or argus, stormwind champion, silver sword,dire wolf, or sword of justice) It's pretty good in arena even if it only comes back once. Zalae's ratings were only for meta standard decks
---
It says it is one per entrant. Your account was entered on Thursday. Your account can not get another one on Friday since you already got one.

I might be wrong. My understanding is that he was known for retiring a lot of runs, but had to change his behavior when arena leaderboards came out because retired runs counted as 0s.
---
Yeah this card needs a rework tbh, throwing it into the HoF pile is just going to make Wild that much more toxic. They nerfed all of druids mana ramp/generation so it's only fair they do the same to rogue.
---
No-no!

225 wins and you can do the same for your  amount of wins.

Given how he does nothing the turn he is played unlike every other Hero card in the game, especially if played on curve, it is better to turn to those three cards.
---
Plus, Dr. Boom as a character would have zero compunction in altering other people's creations.
---
Coin tap Mountain Giant in Evenlock was a play. Maybe not a very good one but possible to play around Naturalize.
---

Hmmm I‚Äôm not sure I understand it haha. So you can get golden versions of the hall of fame cards and the disenchant them? What‚Äôs the incentive for this besides dust? Won‚Äôt they still be available in wild?

---
Big decks are fun
---
Thanos and his gauntlet
---
That is understandable, but changing even just one of those three cards weakens the rest incidentally quite a bit, especially if its one of the minions.
---
This is my favorite deck that I've ever played. Pull off everything exactly right and you look like an absolute genius who won simply by cycling a deck full of garbage and wiping their boards with Pyromancers while drawing cards like a mad man. Make one single miscalculation though and you fall flat on your face like a derp and the opponent rubs it in by BM'ing you.

Every other CCG is a yugioh knockoff to my friends. Hearthstone? Online yugioh knockoff. MTG? What the hell is that?
---
He does nothing the turn he is played is already compensated for in the fact that every one of his new hero powers is better than any of the nine standard hero powers. The 2 armor extra isn't particularly consequential, but not irrelevant either.
---
There's no reason to Nerf three cards that are not Nerf Worthy on their own because there's one other card that pushes them over the edge. You nerf the one card and leave the ones that are fine alone.

Not really a 3-card combo. Just giant + calling on turn 6 is often enough to win the game. Unless you're playing heavy control you are fucked.

general question -- how does this play against mages that do some variant of giants + calling (+khadgar maybe)? do you try to just go faster than them, and hex early giants to avoid early swings? Is ysera still the best one to get out on board? I haven't really been playing RoS much but curious

You should always consider your situation first.  Even if you hoard it, you have the option to mass open before or after the new cards are announced.  Greenskin is great right now but you don't know what the replacements are.  *If you wait a few weeks, or months*, you can make an informed decision.

I finished all Classic legendary cards last years so each new one is just 400 dust for me.  And for Witchwood, there are a ton of Epics, and some Legendarys, being replaced so your average pack value should go up.

And otk is uninteractive and impossible to stop, and control is boring to play against and takes too long. Can't please everybody. Aggro is always going to be more popular because of the dust needed to create them.
---
Niceu!

Whuttt 1.000.000!!!!

Congrats reddit! And sorry but i will be the winner
---
Hope I win !

I'm well aware, as I've already stated in a post in this same thread, not quite sure why you're attempting to insult my intelligence. But (as I've already stated) how much of that is everyone jumping on the 'Lackey Rogue hype' (as well as it being relatively cheap to craft) and then in turn Warrior being its best counter, therefore equating to a large percentage of the ladder? TBH, I feel as if we're in a transitional period where decks are still being constantly refined and new ones emerging. We've already seen it occur with different variations of Mech Hunter as well as Big Shaman establishing itself as a very good deck, with very even match-up spreads. I think many people like yourself are jumping the gun.

!giveaway

I'll take a shot at that. Thanks!

Most likely not a chance to win but would be cool?
---
oh boy
---
Good luck all!
---
thanks blizz
---
Great job guys!
---
I want the free packs so I commented
---
$80 super duper bundle pack? Poggers
---
Oooh, goodie! Free stuff! Let's see if I can get this one.
---
Yeah insta-decline to make em more mad
---
Replying for packs
---
Pog
---
Maybe I'll be lucky
---
It might be a good idea to clarify under which thread people are supposed to be commenting in. Either the top level thread in response to the OP, or under your post announcing the contest,or both. I suspect in the interest of fairness it would have to be both after you remove the duplicates.
---
Pog never won anything
---
Congratulations t-ser--- r/hearthstone 
---
Seriously tho, I have been watching this number increase for a while now, getting slightly exited om the days where it goes up more than normal. Its sad but as a frequent visitor I love reading my 15 mins of reddit each day. So thanks guys, thanks for the great posts I get to read, such as treeant art for the 60000th time!
---
Thunderstandable
---
Nice!
---
Okayyy
---
Hooray! Free packs!
---
It's 99% BM you don't want them
---
Woah, this is awesome.
---
Thank you blizz, love you amazing folks!
---
avocado
---
Cool
---
I used to, but I stopped because of time, money and friends moving away.  
---
I'm so disappointed by the Artifact flop! IMO Artifact is the best ccg ever made but it made so many mistakes on release. Hopefully Valve will turn it around and it'll be awesome this time next year.
---
The point of the game is to find cards that work well with each other. Over time people naturally gravitate toward those same cards and most people want to be successful when they play. It‚Äôs really an impossible thing to escape. I think Blizz focuses more on multiple classes being viable as opposed to being concerned with similar packages amongst the same class.
---
Seriously?
---
&gt; a lot wild cards
---
Isn't Cairne the only wild card in there? Otherwise, same problem. I need around 9k dust to make this deck. I do have that dust, but I honestly don't want to use them.
---
Free packs bois
---
This is easy value.
---
Ayyy
---
üòç

I wasn't around then -- but it looks like Casual Play was created before Ranked and was called "Unranked" -- it and Arena existed before "Ranked".  Here is the Hearthstone blog patch note -- [Closed Beta Patch](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/11868609/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-hearthstone-1004217-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8C%D1%82%D0%B5-%C2%AB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B9%C2%BB-11-12-2013) . If you want to dive into more patch notes, they are easily found in the Hearthstone wiki on the Gamepedia  website.  Maybe the "origin story" will tell you more.
---
What the fuck is that title even
---
Hells yes
---
He give me pack cuz he always give bac
---
Yay! I want packs
---
Seriously, congratulations to everyone for this milestone.
---
Give me my damn packs or i‚Äôm going to find your daughter. End of story.
---
Free packs :o
---
Coolioüëåüèª
---
Hope I get the packs, ive joined this game in the last year and ive loved it. The packs would help alot
---
Congratulations, 1 million is a huge milestone! :)
---
I hope i win plz im poor lol
---
Any tips for the warrior matchup? I have a hard time killing them with their endless removal
---
It won't make a difference!
---
Holy shit, thanks for the free bundle !
---
For the randomness!
---
it‚Äôs witchwood? I thought it was RoS.
---
h
---
very nice!
---
typo, epic cards, not wild cards :D
---
EVERYONE GET IN HERE
---
As they say in texan ‚ÄúYee haw par‚Äôner‚Äù
---
the point of the game for who? blizzard?
---
when they created soul of the forest combo they knew people would use it in token druid. nobody "found" those cards. its not a decision.
---
.
---
yay
---
[Insert Random Text] and pray to RNGesus.
---
Congrats on the subs!
---
:) GL everyone
---
1 million subs is forever ago!  I remember playing in the beta, and it was a simpler game.
---
Thanks powerchicken!
---
I like how he thinks 4AM in the middle of the week is good watchtime for EU.
---
Yass
---
i think i needed 1.200 dust for it, so it was okay. But I would never spend 9k dust for a deck
---
Let's go üòÉ
---
They all run the same list because there is always an optimal list. 10 million choices and you'll still pick the optimal.
---
Good luck guys :)
---
I cut 1 Ancestral Healing for 1 Exotic Mountseller :D
---
Thank you and the other mods for managing this subreddit and make it grow this big.
---
Woah I wanna win!
---
Oh boy, better not get my uopes up
---
Yes please
---
You're the best ‚ò∫
---
Oooo
---
i love you
---
Where da packs at mon?
---
Twilight Drake and Earth Shock.
---
That's how you play hearthstone f2p
---
Here is this comment
---
packs or not, i really hope the game continues to move forward and improve and learn from previous mistakes.
---
Don‚Äôt let Hearthstone become the next Heroes of the Storm.
---
Despite the sometimes toxic levels of saltiness, the subreddit is more often rather fun to lurk and participate in at times. There are days on which I spend more time here than the game itself. Cheers to more followers to come and for the nice community, including the devs, community managers and mods.
---
Yeah should've been more specific. When I say get by on pre-orders, Im including all the free content.
---
I'm in :)
---
No. Blizzard should not be trying to add more classes instead of trying to balance old classes.
---
Wassup
---
Damn, I'm actually proud of this community
---
Literally everyone in this thread now haha.
---
Whoop whoop
---
weenie hut jr
---
I knew I stayed here for a reason
---
In case the comment has to be to this parent instead of the main post,
---
Comment.
---
Comments
---
yay por 1kk!!
---
mean why wouldnt they, whats not to love about free packs!
---
Commenting here,
---
Skidaddle skidooddle if i don't win i'm back to eating noodles
---
[OBLIGATORY COMMENT THAT TRIES TOO HARD TO SOUND LIKE I'M NOT JUST HERE JUST FOR PACKS](https://i.imgur.com/BwEcW5I.jpg)
---
give me my packs
---
ok cool
---
Hey
---
i don't have anything witty to say, just hoping for free packs
---
I would say my experience is probably about 33% is rage and the rest just wanna ask about my deck. Most people are pretty cool and I've met a lot of cool ppl by accepting requests. I never engage anyone salty though I just remove them. Not worth my time or energy. I'm fine living in their head rent-free
---
*sigh*
---
comment.
---
This is so sweet!
---
Free packs? I want in
---
I get it, i mean I commented as well.
---
Amazing.
---
I think the first nerf of this expansion cycle will happen about a week after May 2nd.
---
Free packs!
---
Thanks you for another free pack draw, not going to expect myself to win it but hope the person who win will enjoy it.
---
If we enjoy it too much to stop playing, how could it possibly be a shitfest?
---
ez packs
---
Preorder specifically means spending real money to buy an bundle at promotional prices.
---
Are you using it differently to refer to saved up gold that you spend on expansion release?
---
&gt;You just need equivalency.
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ‚õè‚õè
---
Can I get in on some free packs?
---
Wait, they're gonna just *do* that?
---
I might as well throw my hat into this.
---
Maybe winning some RoS packs will convince me to play Hearthstone more regularly again.
---
Thanks for the opportunity, and congrats on 1 million.
---
WOOP WOOP!!
---
Obligatory comment cos I‚Äôm poor
---
Eh, alright. Let's roll.
---
i hope once it happens thye dont gut classic and basic instead of the expansion cards.
---
Good luck everyone!
---
Ah, I see, thank you!!
---
Free packs!!
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
1 million is a lot!
---
Me, me
---
Hello
---
Nah, they won‚Äôt, 9 is already hard enough to balance.
---
Woo, one whole million!
---
Oh, didn‚Äôt know balancing was an issue
---
thank you so much hearthstone means a lot to me
---
Awesome!
---
I too enjoy getting the chance to win prizes.
---
I‚Äôll take some free packs plz and thanks.
---
Dope
---
Awesome
---
Nice unique deck! I like it. You deserved that win
---
I can confirm, had 2x Hunter quest (2 &amp; 3 wins) yesterday and didn't feel like playing Standard, so I looked for a Wild deck. Got them done in like 10 minutes. Won two games on Turn 5, 4 and 3 (Concede from the opponent). When you curve out, it's crazy fast.
---
gimme packs. do it for... for NA's sake
---
^^^(but ^^^don't ^^^tell ^^^them ^^^I ^^^live ^^^in ^^^EU)
---
Thanks for being a great game

Legend has it their battle still continues to this day
---
Free stuff
---
I used to be a good arena player, but I barely play this game anymore. Isn't rogue the best class in arena, like it often was?
---
I'm in!
---
OMG I NEED THOSE PACKS PLEASEE, I've opened like 15 with no legendaries :'( hahahah. Good luck everyone!! ‚ô• Been playing since Pandaria Cardback .
---
Oh wow!
---
He can't read your reply, dude.
---
Thank you for doing this! ‚ô•
---
almost got rid of my final few friends - I'm guessing Legend is awarded automatically? the instructions are a little unclear
---
Wow, thanks! Also yay 1mil subs
---
I just got back into it and I‚Äôm falling in love with card games all over again.
