Regarding your quest issue, if you've got a friend or alt account, you can complete your quests this way. Or you can try to learn the arena format, (although this way is much more challenging, it gives the most profit BY FAR if you're good enough. 12 wins = around 350 gold and 1 pack profit, whereas in standard, you get 40 gold). Some people in this subreddit will tell you that arena is a no-skill format, but this is just false. 
---

---
Regarding your winrate, people will make assumptions that you're not a very good player since you're stuck at rank 20. The way to prove how good or bad you are at the game is to show replays. Maybe you'll learn a few things by watching your own replays or receiving others' perspectives.
---
&gt; But I think a game should not be begging for money this casually.
---
Unfortunately, with lack of competitors and the company being Blizzard, this is just the way it is. However, this doesn't mean that being f2p isn't a nonviable option; you just gotta invest time and effort instead of money. That's how it goes with any f2p game.

The reasons you gave are exactly why Zilliax shouldn't be in the Classic set. Those are the criteria given for the first group of Hall of Fame cards - Neutral cards that were so good they were played in massive numbers of decks, even when there was no synergy. Zilliax should definitely rotate.

Mage is its own class, no need for its secrets to use hunter secrets as a standard. As you’ve probably seen, flame ward is pretty damn good, despite being worse than explosive trap in a void.
---
Sure! I'll give it a try! Thank you!
---
Oh yeah... didn't they have an adventure section of the shop back in the day. Maybe they should bring it back.
---
That’s a nice idea, something that’s fun but has enough randomness or split paths to not be the same experience every time.
---
The problem with people complaining about dungeon run is that people rarely suggest any alternative. I would prefer something fresh over more dungeon run, but I wouldn’t be happy if they replaced it with something like the old adventure structure.
---
I think what it needs way more than cheaper mana costs or a body attached to it is a deck it fits into. For it to actually put a bunch of secrets into play you'd need a deck full of secrets. Current secret mage plays just 4 different secrets max, meaning 7-8 secrets in total and by turn 8 it will have drawn and played most of them. It just makes sense that a class with secret-tutors, secret costreduction-effects and secret on-play effects doesn't want to spend a lot of mana to get secrets from the deck.
---
8 mana for 5 secrets isn't a bad trade, but for a deck to actually use that it would have to be able to play 8 cost cards, meaning it would have to be a slow deck, and have a bunch of secrets in the deck. A lot of secrets don't make for a great control deck and without all the secret-synergy they are quite mediocre. The only way I could see this card work is with a card that generates secrets. Something like a well statted "whenever you play a secret, shuffle a copy of it into your deck."-minion, then add subject 9, flakmage and some other control secretmage synergy and you'd have a deck which I'm pretty convinced would want to run this card, even in it's current form.
---
I do that because my audio jack doesn’t work and I let someone borrow my wireless headphones and they broke them.
---
Maybe introduce new mechanics?  Like you get to "recruit" cards to add to your deck *and* collection, but can only keep them if you win the run (obviously the keep would only apply on your first run).  Maybe let players build decks from scratch *not* limited by their collection.  Maybe team up runs where its you and a friend vs a boss and you have interesting synergies/mechanics with your friend's stuff: like you alternate turns but can opt to skip your turn to them for a power swing;  or maybe tribe synergies apply accross both boards they get murloc buffs, if they play an elemental it counts for your kalimos, etc.  Let players play as the boss vs other players once they have finished on heroic or done some other accomplishment.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Number one issue though is the economics of it.  League of Explores was $20.00 and gave multiple *good* legendaries along with other useful cards guaranteed.   The value coming back on dungeon runs is clearly lacking and the reward discrepancy is clearly just greedy mgmt trying to goad players into buying more ~~lootboxes~~ -er cardpacks.  There is zero reason they couldn't offer old rewards, with the updated gameplay.  Apologists are defending the trade off of mediocre game play with good rewards, vs good gameplay with shit rewards, there is zero reason we cant have both other than actiblizsion being a bunch of greedy asswipes.
---
Whaaaah!!! GOLDEN VISA
---
Liar, that looks far too full of money to be a true Hearthstone player.
---
6 mana is very different from 8 mana. I was thinking about Mysterious Challenger and in that same format 8 mana 8/8  Put one of each Secret from your deck into the battlefield still might just be too slow for what is a fairly aggressive deck
---
Must suck that you have to pay $2.99 every time you open it
---
yep, the old adventure structure are pretty bland but it does have a nice thing to it when doing it the first time not knowing anything. but since they incorporated the dungeon run format why not make it into a full-blown adventure with really unique aspects to it. like having sidekicks and doing a make your own adventure aspect that doesn't take the fun out of the community when "the hearthstone team" does a "streamer-first experience" which kind of make the adventure not fun for the rest of the community when the streamers did it first because of the predictability of the events when playing it on release.
---
I think that's my favorite card of this whole expansion. Coin it out on turn 1 and you can feel your opponent sweating as the value starts coming in.
---
I think it might be played if it was a persisting threat. So, like, “At the end of your turn, cast a secret from your deck.” Could even be both end and start so it’s a little faster.
---
&gt; ...Because that seems to be OP's very argument, that the game is not very friendly to f2p?
---
If you're game's too friendly to free players, your free-to-play game dies. Plus, I'd argue Hearthstone is plenty friendly to free players when they don't expect everything. Especially when it comes to other card games, only in Hearthstone does it seems like owning every card ever is the benchmark much of the playerbase expects.
---
&gt;Ah yes, lets personally attack OP with the good old 'gitgud' argument that always works. You're doing fine, thus the problem has to be OP 
---
Skill is a factor in the game. The OP could be playing a fully decked out Murloc Paladin, Control Warrior, and Highlander Hunter but still suck at the game. He seems to be so fixated on how his opponents have legendary cards that it's blinding him that the primary thing stopping him from advancing on ladder is himself.
---
&gt; Usual does not mean good... Can't afford to pay?  Thoughts and prayers 
---
The difference between Hearthstone and most other card games worth mentioning is that any deck can be built in Hearthstone for the price of just playing the game. MtG Standard and Yugioh TCG decks will often cost upwards of three hundred dollars. Going into eternal MtG formats will cost thousands. 
---
Even Control Warrior can be built on nothing but patience.
---
&gt; And here is the truth, a budget, you pretty much DO need to pay to actually be able to play the game. 
---
That has been proven untrue repeatedly. Thousand dust midrange hunter decks have been taken to Legend all the time.
---
If by "play the game" you mean experiment, sure, yeah, that's expensive, but experimenting in any card game, free-to-play, physical, or otherwise, is expensive.
---
&gt;It really isn't that bad as long as you: Aren't experiencing anything new every time you open the game; Keep up with the measly 50g/day (which translates into 1/2 pack, also known as 20 dust, or 1/2 the dust of crafting a common); Build decks from basic cards. 
---
On a budget of twenty dollars an expansion, I am able to play pretty much play any deck I want in both Standard and Wild, and I probably would be able to without paying anything really. Day one into Saviors of Uldum, I was able to build both a Quest Druid and Quest Paladin deck without nuking my collection or getting exceptionally lucky in the thirty-five, forty packs I opened.
---
Playing on a budget and trying out new decks can be done if you're smart with the cards your open and your dust.
---
Holy shit
---
I know this is kind of off topic but how effective is your mechathun combo, it seems like if someone caught on and just didn’t play anything for you to rush in to, you would just fatigue out, also another question, does it have any significant advantage over the shrivalla otk, also, can I get a deck list. Also, mass dispel doesn’t seem that bad, it saves you more face damage, and also it prevents him from playing anything else. Plus it lets you play prismatic lense which sets up lethal next turn, also if you cleared the board you wouldn’t have lethal next turn because you need some way to kill your mechathun.
---

---
Genn and Baku were moved because they became a full thirty percent of Standard, something Team 5 did not exactly intend, and they would over shadow what would have come out this year. It didn't help that people were sick of the two cards as well.
---
This is from Team 5 Hall of Fame announcement on the matter:
---
&gt;In order for set rotation to breathe new life into Standard and maintain overall health of the ladder, we are rotating Baku and Genn into the Hall of Fame a year earlier than normal. 
---
Genn and Baku weren't necessarily broken, but they were homogenizing Standard and were moved out of the format as a result.

---
An understandable point you made. I actually alternate between wild and standard so it doesn't get stale. However, I've noticed in the few expansions I have played for every meta deck there is generally an even more broken wild counterpart. 
---
Secret mage for example, is really tiresome for me to play against and find quite powerful. So I switched to wild only to have my next 3/5 games, yep secret mage. I can see how it could be frustrating but those decks will rotate into wild eventually so I don't see any point getting mad about it.

---
Yeah, but the no duplicates rule would prevent too much loss.
---
This. This is what I don't get.
---
I get they are making the new dungeon runs "bigger" per se, but they gave us the first one for free and that was pretty big. If they just wanna do more stuff like this, I don't understand why all of a sudden it requires extra money. And throwing packs on top of it, just makes it seem like you are merely paying for packs.
---
I would like something akin to what dungeon run was, for free. But sadly... here we are :(
---
This is what most of my wallet content went for
---
Thats basically 30 mana worth of stuff in a single card. In that case, its class should be changed to paladin, that sounds fair.
---
Yes, but there's also 80g quest trading, getting lucky with rolling a 100g quest once or twice too.  So maybe 9 wins a day or less makes that reasonable.
---
non-native english speaker, i still goof up shiy
---
I am not implying he was best of the best though, otherwise i would not have won. what I mean is he has good cards to combine. He did a lot of mistakes but very most probably he had paid a lot to this game. 
---
Everyone is saying "meta,meta,meta" 
---
I am assured that current meta is quest. But the problem is, as I said multiple times, that I lack in-game currencies and I have no viable way to accumulate right now.
---
If I didn't have dust problem, why would I bother asking questions?
---
Same. Had super bad draw luck and lost anyways though:(
---
Nomi is a one card win condition against slow greedy decks, Maly needs around 5 (Maly, Elise, two Moonfires and Florist). There's the reason.
---
HE SAYS THAT’S HOW AGGRO PLAYERS COMMUNICATE NORMALLY. I WAS UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF COMMUNICATION.

OP must’ve opened a golden Nat Pagle. He wants the card to be buffed to be so strong it needs to be HOF’d so he can get free dust

It feels like you actually cant have a good hearthstone experience until youve played for at least a year if you are a new f2p player. Unless youve spent $200 upfront, there is no way you are getting the full experience immediately.

Yo what sea of control decks are you in and how do I get there because all of my games in wild are against secret mage or token druid
---
If you have Kangor's Endless Army, just put in a load of mechs and have a go. You can put in Arcane Dynamos to fish for more copies of Kangor's Endless Army. Chuck Tirion in there too. Most mechs are of low rarity as well, so it won't be too expensive. If you like playing some games with it, consider crafting Zilliax. It's a very good card, played in almost all decks, and it would go with this Mech Paladin of yours too.
---
If you want something more meta, Making Mummies Paladin plays some mechs and Kangor's Endless Army. You can find a list online and replace the cards you don't have. You will need the quest though.
---
There was also a Mech Paladin which was meta before SoU launched, you can take a look at that too.
---
At that point you've either won from what you've drawn or you lost anyway.
---
Betrayal might not exactly be a part of the AoE clear card pool, though. It clears 2 minions at most and only rarely.
---
And yeah, it most likely has seen it as 100% lethal, because he doesn't know what Convincing Infiltrator does. Still, it would would feel bad to miss a lethal in a case like that.
---
There are many posts about missing lethal, such as this one. It would not be possible with simulation.
---
Is that Reno totem even shaman?
---
That sucks. Especially because it happened to me right after King crush killed one of my minions right before nuking my side.
---
I imagine that they’re going to improve that code from patch to patch. Trying to use machine learning stuff for Zephrys would be cool but it would also be significantly more difficult to pull off as people have wildly different definitions on what defines the perfect card depending on the board state (assuming of course that there is no immediate lethal) and thus there isn’t really a good way to tell any machine learning Zephrys algorithm how to improve its selections for most board states.
---
The Overwolf app is great for helping with card choices, which will have a bigger impact than class choice. 
---
Right now according to hsreplay the best arena classes are, in order: Mage, Warlock, Rogue, Paladin and Hunter. The other classes have a less than 50% win rate, so those five should be your picks.
---
This post has nothing to do with missing lethal, though?
---
Zephrys missing lethal is always because of some sort of a bug. Given that he's played hundreds of thousands of time every day and we're only seeing a handful of posts about him missing lethal, it clearly doesn't happen often and 99% of time he gives lethal correctly. I'm not an expert, but would simulation mean that bugs can't occur at all?
---
Right?
---
"Aha, my T1 meta deck beat your improvised fun deck, let me spend a minute rubbing it in your face how good I am!"
---
I find that people tend to BM you more if you're losing with a 'bad' deck than losing with a meta deck. Not sure why. 
---
"That'll teach you to not play off-meta stuff"?
---
So to play around Zephrys aoe just play a meckaroo?
---
I probably will if there's a 20%+ Amazon coins back at any point before it releases; otherwise ehhh
---
Yeah Zephrys needs to be buffed...
---
that's a click bait sorry for that
---
I have one too! Now that I think about it, it's been my wallet since they came out a few years ago. They are actually pretty nice, with lots of pockets and durable to boot.
---
Each one should give you 3 packs
---
Ashmore may also help, it's smaller and draws less but there's a good mix of Rush, Lifesteal, and Deathrattle in the deck so she should usually draw 2-3.
---
I mean, a lot of things
---
Having one card in your deck that could possibly give you a chance in the matchup and you fight tooth and nail until it's literally the last card in your deck and you lose because you didn't draw it in time.
---
I'm looking at you, Skulking Geist vs Jade Druid. I'm looking at you, Raza/Anduin. I'm looking at you, Frost Lich Jaina.

---
considering it's already super expensive to buy the main content of the game (the cards), most people save their gold to have cards to play and not just to access a game mode.

---
Maybe it's to make the expansion pre-orders look good by comparison, but I hope Blizzard isn't that cynical.
---
Was that prepatch? They changed him to value silence higher in lethal situation so cardtext and deathrattles to interfere as much.
---
I feel ur pain, i live in Brazil :c

Agreed. I also had a lot of fun playing it. My main problem with it was mostly that it added a new expense without compensating with a new source of gold.

Thank you!
---
A fair price is what people are willing to pay, it may not seem fair to you but I would certainly pay that if I didnt hoard all my gold; I suppose at the end of the day we have different opinions and we should probably go about our days instead of arguing over the pricing module of a childrens card game

That keyword doesn't sound like it would be worth playing. Cards with it would be "win more" and especially if they have big effects like say \[\[Spikeridged Steed\]\], the act of playing that card could very easily be the reason why you'd lose a game.

Okay. So to explain, Zephrys doesn't know what cards do. He does know what keywords and tags they have, as well as stats. Zeph is notorious for not giving you board clears against death rattles, because he doesn't know what they do but does know killing them leads to badness. From a programming perspective, Zeph can read tags but nothing more

How's Sap/Sahket Sapper doing in this meta? Seems hard to use against Shaman quest, aggro, etc.
---
Where I can I find mature, casual conversation about my favorite Children's Card Game^tm ?
---
I'll agree that you didnt say it. But it was definitely implied.
---
I have not met that much control decks, so i do not see any point in adding Mecha'thun, he is dead card for first few turns and this warlock need to pull his combo asap.
---
I lolled
---
Two Brawls and a Plague of Wrath are common, if Nomi gets popular you can just run a second Plague if the Tomb Warden spam doesn’t win against the 4th Nomi.
---
And what happens if you want to play control shaman? What happens when they play Archivist and the shaman doesn't?
---
Doesn't he only need to bounce Galvinizer once and get Cthun to (7)? Why twice?
---
How?
---
a pack is 100g . You need at least 30 to even consider making a competitive deck , that's 3000 gold.
---
If you are getting 60 gold per day per quest that's 50 days. 
---
You must be a wizard or something.
---
this is easy one, Squeamlish is one true druid!
---
Lorewalker Cho is objectively the best card in the game and anyone who disagrees is a simpleton &amp; a bore. 
---
I am not saying this ironically. No, I will not explain myself.
---
Control shaman does run archivist and is arguably "even worse" due to shudderwock repeating her battlecry.
---
I love this deck so much. All those very sticky minions with all the different combos with the mechs. That stupid Zephrys has been shutting my games down though. I try to play around the mass dispel but sometimes I dont draw anymore eggs.
---
The random legendary is definitely worth it in that scenario. For me it's almost exactly 50% that I get something I will be happy with (8/19 are hits).
---
As a programmer, I think trying to scan all the possible sequences of moves, even just on that turn, would be way too computationally intensive for the kind of server performance Blizzard wants.
---
My approach would just be to write a heuristic for each of the card options (there are only a few hundred) and select the top three accordingly. (If he keeps offering cards that are too similar, we could perhaps use multiple heuristic values biased towards different types of play.) The heuristic values should be able to predict lethal almost all the time.
---
Rag really should have armor like all the other “hero” cards.
---
There’s no deck tracker on mobile so yes there’s disadvantages to it
---
If it’s easy then do it yourself lol this is my own murloc list I made
---
Thank you man!!
---
Nice!
---
dang
---
If you think about it, fishflinger is surely played more than 50563 times. It was just the matter of the time this will happen
---
Absolutely! The chances of it in a single instance are still so low, though.
---
I have the same one! Got it from the blizzard store about 2 years ago. It's held up pretty well, definitely my favorite novelty item I own.
---
Internet
---
Yeah and 99% of people are also playing the game at top 200 legend without a deck tracker you’re totally right! You got me!
---
??
---
Mechathun, frostray, frostray, snap freeze?
---
Personally I think I might stop buying the "main content" of the game and just become a single player modes only player. I get access to all the cards for free and I get a challenge that's not actually soul crushingly repetitive due to a meta staling too quickly.
---
Play agro
---
Dang lucky i never get that good of options!
---
Beautiful.
---
I just quit card games lol
---
This is awesome, do you have a progress video?
---
It's really simple. Same MMR = Same rank.
---
As an avid Reborn Quest player I can assure he has mass dispel as an option. Every single damn time.
---
I deleted them a while ago, think Zoo in a Priest shell.
---
Goal was to Swarm, buff a little, have some big value trading followed by Northshire/Circle turns for reload and Bwonsamdi at the top for additional reload. 
---
I took some games where I caught the opponent off guard or was too quick for them, got stomped by a lot the broken wild decks.

there ya go!

Siamat is a solid card in just about anything (especially budget), go for it!
---
Are all Blizzard employees related?
---
Well then you are running doubles
---
I have no clue what happens behind the scenes but it’s pretty apparent that zephyris has been set up give you immediate answers. There’s not a ton of nuance there—if it determines that your problem is a board full of murlocs, it will give you holy nova, not flame ward. I get wanting the option, after all you’re given theee choices. I suppose The difference is that holy nova (or whatever same-turn aoe you’re offered) requires you to take the initiative and because it’s same turn it can’t be played around. Like, imagine that you did get an explosive trap. You play it. On opponent’s turn, they play chief inspector. Boom roasted. Zephyris can’t give you cute options like that because there’s a real chance it will be thwarted and so the entire point of the card has been subverted. Nobody would run zephyris in a universe where it *only* offered choices like that, so it stands to reason that they specifically chose not to offer *anything* like that. I mean it could well be that that might be the best three plays you could make and hence zephyris would be of zero use to you on that turn. 
---
Again I get that it would be nice to have the option and zephyris could probably be a little bit smarter in a lot of respects but it’s not supposed to play the game for you. It’s kind of a desperation play, and shouldn’t give you setup options as well.
---
Funny how he helps you empty the filed.
---
Not spending $100 on content.
---
It should go without saying, but these numbers change based on your collection.  You might try something like HSReplay (with your collection synced) to search for decks within *x* dust.

It was a tech card last expansion for the giant mage mirror.
---
Probably not. You can look at all the legendaries in SOU through the collection. See what your odds are of getting one you want.
---
If you open up the create a deck option it gets rid of it
---
so is the only way to mess up the combo with book is to hit both snap freezes and both shooting stars?
---
Hearthstone: 3 sets per year (one per 4 months). Rotation annually in April. Standard is the last two years (6 sets) + basic and classic which are non-rotating and basically substitute for the fact that HS has no reprints. 
---
A typical set has slightly more than 100 cards. 
---
100$/set is generally enough to buy everything relevant (approximately half a complete set by dust total, mostly missing epics and a few legendaries). So 300$ annually is a pretty good budget for having everything you want if you're not a completionist.
---
Iirc it's around 200$/set on average to complete a (non foil, we call them golden) set, so ~600$/yr is basically complete hearthstone. 
---
Wild is the equivalent of vintage/legacy in magic.
---
That's it! Thank you! You're officially the best.
---
You cheeky bastard 😂
---
I'm sad you can't get it, but that's the card. Thanks for responding so quickly. I'm not crazy!
---
If you play the Missile Launcher without magnetising it, it should kill your opponent before the deathrattles activate
---
IStabFruit#1248 NA trading 80g
---
Guaranteed legendary
---
I just haven’t ran into that issue yet I guess, I’ve always found removal through discover if I needed it on top of how much the deck has whether via spell or minion rush / windfury / charge minions
---
How do I make the quest work? \*totally not golden quest...totally not desperate to use golden legendaries I swear\*
---
happens very rarely. most nerfs make the deck they are trying to nerf go from tier 1 to tier who gives a shit. sure you can play the deck but no one wants to anymore. at least wild the deck will see play along with many other OP decks standard is sick of.
---
I am curious as to what you believe the salty player is calling a hack. It reminds me of when Keeper Stalladris was released and they updated the art on many Choose One options (of which Stalladris adds to your hand), and I saw a few posts here accusing players of hacking for playing one. I remember that one of them had the opponent playing one of the Jade Idol options (with Stalladris on the board still). I guess new art is alarming when you don’t read the effects of (legendary) minions.
---
Nice.
---
Van Cleef is a classic card and has proven his versatility in multiple decks and metas.
---
Goldshire Footman is right there, second best card in the game.
---
Cenarius, quest Druid is the strongest in the meta out of the ones you listed here and is currently tier 1amd will probably still see play next expansion
---
I’m scared they’ll nerf quest Druid because it’s very good right now, and it kind of reminds me of old school Druid with crazy flexibility
---
