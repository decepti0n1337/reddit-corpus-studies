The quest is pretty good.  The deck has been tier 2ish.

---
It's probably worth holding onto for at least a week until things pan out though, what with all the old cards being thrown back into standard tomorrow.

Who needs government censorship when we have the fear of losing China $$$?

I support the protests. China, go ahead and delete me.

I feel like this infographic could be a bit better. Some things have been mentioned already, but here's some other things to change that could make it better
---
* For classes that people didn't bring (just rogue in this case), it shows a 0% winrate. This is very misleading
---
* Classes that weren't brought often have very skewed stats. Mage in week 2, 3, and 4, and warlock in week 6 and 7 for example. Maybe have the line (or each section of an area chart, or pie graph if you'll switch formats) be more translucent if the class isn't popular, and more opaque if it is popular?
---
* I don't know if it's been accounted for, but the "banned" percentages should exclude classes that were protected  in that match.The biggest example is priest. Priest was probably banned less overall than warrior or druid, but if priest was left unprotected, it was probably banned more than the rest of the pack.

if blizzard only has some tegrity

its cause they got no tegrity

Losing the China market would absolutely crush Blizzard.  It is the single largest gaming market on the planet, bigger than the US.  Blizzard games are huge there.

I've been active until Rise of the Shadows (my only deck being a whizbang deck and the highest I got was rank 14 lol). I currently have 14k dust. Any recommendations on what deck to build for this expansion? I mostly like using Mage, Hunter, and Warrior (Shaman as well but I'm bad with overloading).
---
It's YOUR allied Lackeys it affects, for the rest of the game. Stealing it and playing it yourself denies Tekhan its effect, meaning his Lackeys will be 1/1 for the rest of the game and any Lackeys you play will be 4/4
---
They are a company they are to side with whoever pays them more money, and I doubt the protestors have more money than the Chinese government.

If their profits and market show a dip after this, they might get a message. If they don’t, we’ll then they didn’t do the wrong thing did they...
---
Your argument makes sense if you don't like to play arena. The point made is that at 7 wins and above, you're guaranteed at least 150 gold, refunding the ticket. Thus, for people who like to play arena and for whom playing more games per gold spent is more important, it makes absolute sense to carry on playing
---
For F2P players who still do not have a full collection, it also makes sense to keep playing because you want to maximise the reward gain for gold spent. Assuming you get average 7 win rewards (1 pack + 150 gold + misc rewards), the rewards now look like this:
---
-Do nothing: ticket + 1 pack + 150 gold + misc
---
-Lose: ticket + 1 pack + misc + one more run (which if you get to at least 3 wins will get you back to the equivalent of 150 gold at least)
---
In other words, even if you lose, your next run just needs to hit 3 wins, which the average player is definitely able to achieve. Again, this is also assuming that you value the Uldum packs at 100 gold each, which you clearly don't, which is why you feel that it's not worth it
---
Can you explain why did you beat a taxi driver life out of shit? Also when you protest, why did you smash all the stores in the streets? Are those also Hong Konger? 
---
Should you target the government instead of other innocent Hong Konger?
---
Mysterious Challenger by itself isn't really meta breaking. Remember that after Old Gods came out, it saw zero play despite being in standard for a whole 'nother year. It was just a really good inclusion to the already competitive midrange paladin deck.
---
We don’t curve perfectly every time, you’re just posting while angry. I routinely draw into the ass end of my deck (6 cost elemental, MCT with nothing on enemy board, wasp with no lackey generation, bog slosher as my 3 drop, boy howdy). just as often, I pull my questing adventurers well after I got my quest off. It’s just RNG, dude. The trick is hat Quest shaman has a lot of ability to bend the curve their way, or rather derive double value along the curve, and so they don’t have a lot of dead hands which can feel oppressive. Trust me, we have some very shitty games. I can’t beat a secret hunter for the life of me.
---
I wonder whether they playtested that at 3 mana and it was just insane? Because at 4 mana it is completely trash.
---
They are fascist as they have government okayed private market. 
---
Which is essentially the same thing as government run. 
---
Which just like communist USSR, fails and is complete bullshit and ends in millions killed.

Topdeck removal for maximum tilt
---
The answer is don't take blood money. There is no rule that corporations have to take money from China, and plenty of millionaires were made without ever doing business with China.  This is greed and callous disregard for human rights, and that's all it is.
---
Imagine making Overwatch, a game where the lore is focused on being a hero and doing what’s right, even though there may be struggles along the way. Then imagine selling out to China for money.
---
You're overestimating both the difficulty of reaching legend and the necessity to know they're called quests.

The simple answer to your question is yes.

A lot of Rogue spells were balanced around Preparation.  Now most Rogue spells besides Backstab/Eviscerate are very overcosted.

When you say you support the protest, do you know the truth behind it? I do because I live there. Let's just say don't believe everything you see on the news. These "protestors" have destroyed our metro system over the past few days. People who dare oppose them is nearly beaten to death. There are lots of  photos and videos on the internet showing the truth of what's happening if you look pass the propaganda. Simply put, Hong Kong is following the steps of Lybia, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine. I can no longer feel anger, this city is done.
---
"We here at Blizzard do not condone nor endorse the personal viewpoints of Blitzchung or any other grandmasters and their statements do not relfect the values that Blizzard holds as a company"

That would be the thing to do if they had any integrity at all.

There's a reason all their "progressive lore" is outside the game.

They don’t like your opinion? They can absolutely fire you.
---
I know perfectly well that they have a lot of stakes in the Asian market. This decision by Activision Blizzard is putting money and profit above human rights.
---
"But they make more money this way" is not an ethical defense.
---
ok this makes a bit more sense. but still it's fked up. how can the casters prevent this thing..

He wore a gas mask and shouted like he was a terrorist. He literally acted and looked like a terrorist during 9/11

Amazing Review. Makes me sad I didn't try out Mummy Magic. Too often I get deathrattle or battlecry synergy without having any of those cards in my deck.

You wanna talk about human rights? 
---
Talk with the civils got damaged in the so-called "protest"
---
You wanna talk about censorship?

Talk with the simplified comments deleted by the HK/TW moderators on facebook

Eh. It’ll blow over for them. They know it.

They’re washing their hands of it, letting people know how things are going to be handled in the future and ignoring it. 
---
They don’t want to talk about this. They’ll just wait for it to go away.
---
That seems harsh. 
---
It's their livelihoods wtf. Just for speaking out for human rights
---
Well because it was a limited time promotion? To reward people for playing when he was released?
---
While I appreciate you putting effort into the research on this, I still think you are missing the point on the outrage. By most moral standards, Blizzard's behavior is simply wrong. I will not get into the conflict here, but juts a glimpse at r/hongkong will give you enough of an idea of the atrocities the Chinese government is currently committing. And that is nothing in comparison to what that government is doing to the Uyghurs (look that one up, it is truly terrifying). 
---
So calling Blizzard out on this, is the right thing to do. Period. 
---
Whether or not the decision is correct from a business perspective is not the issue here. Hell, even the post itself acknowledges the financial benefit of the action.
---
I just came to the subreddit to see the reaction to the news. I quit when they started censoring "Winnie the pooh" in game chat for their other games.
---
Just want to say congrats on finishing and for writing such a solid report. Just finished completing all 5 wings once on normal and heroic, and I can imagine how much more work all those extra combinations would be.  Nice work!
---
Considering that Apple, Google, and [FB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Facebook#China) kowtow to China, not surprised that Blizz is on the pain train, too. Everyone complaining is right to do so, and should write Blizz to complain, but if you’re going to boycott them for this, consider what [other companies^1](www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/11/2/18053142/china-internet-privacy-censorship-apple-microsoft-google-democracy-report) [have been doing^2](https://www.wired.com/story/us-companies-help-censor-internet-china/), and if you’re going to discontinue use of *their* services. They’ve almost certainly fucked over more than 3 people, but just aren’t as conspicuous (to the US) with China concessions. Even the ones partially blocked are working to make a censorship system that China will accept. One player’s prize money and two casters are drops in the bucket compared to what the other companies do.

Man, if I worked for Blizzard I'd be so ashamed, what a shameful company.

If the Chinese users willingly stop spending money on Blizzard games, this will hurt them much more than it will make them money.
---
What happened?

How dare blizzard do this. And how dare you support the evaporation of freedom.
---
I feel utterly ashamed to have supported blizzard for so many years. Thousands of my hard earned money spent on cards and aesthetics, on subscriptions. I bought all the games.
---
I have a soft spot in my heart for the Chinese, as I lived in the mainland for 3 years.
---
I will never return to a place where the citizens are so brainwashed.
---
I wish for the liberation of Chinese people. For them to know the truth.
---
My girlfriend is in fact Chinese, and she felt utterly betrayed when she learnt the facts. She felt fooled, that is how the Chinese people would really feel after all. Saving face is a big deal.... And to learn the one system you trust over all is in fact the one you should trust the least would be the most heartbreaking realisation to face.
---
I don't know if this will be deleted. But fuck China. Fuck China so hard until their entire agenda collapses and the people are allowed to think for themselves, instead of being tools to a corrupt system.
---
Shame, shame, shame! Spineless cowards!
---
I would like to point out that I do not a 100% credible source for what I have written in my second paragraph. But just take a look at Twitter and how silent all GMs &amp; casters have been while all other non-GMs furiously react, I think it’s pretty easy to deduce...
---
What are you talking about, they did it because they don't want politics in their official esports, not because they particularly against HK protesters or whatnot. Do you think they wouldn't do just that if someone said "Crush the deviants, annex hong kong, glory to CCP"?
---
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE

They also had an exclusive Chinese version of an Iron Man movie where it had a couple extra minutes of Chinese scenes. Funnily enough I remember people in China mostly thought it was garbage and would rather watch the movie without the hamfisted Chinese footage.

...Yes?
---
No problem, deleting [battle.net](https://battle.net). There were many practical reasons to stop playing Blizzard games, namely the extreme drop in quality, but now I have a moral reason to finally pull the plug.

Scum.

I truly do hope a significant amount do similar.

If German government back in 1940 required Blizzard Germany to hand over all jewish employees for extermination; would you support and agree with their decision? Segregation, and the extermination of jews WAS OFFICIAL LAW in Germany.

---
"but it's da law"

I will delete my Blizzard account and stop all subscriptions if this decision is not retracted. All games and monthly payments. Fuck China Fuck Communism.

https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/7/20902720/hearthstone-grandmasters-hong-kong-liberation
---
Blizzard banned him from Grandmasters, reduced his prize to $0, banned him from Hearthstone esports for 12 months for support the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.
---
Ban blog post in question, comments pre-disabled because they're goddamn cowards: 
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289
---
Activision and blizzard are rats
---
There goes any competitive integrity Grandmasters had. If you insult their source of income, then you can expect to be banned. What a fucking joke, anyone who is an apologist for this kind of shit or propagates it by allowing their company to accept financial support from China is subhuman scum. People are having their organs harvested from their LIVING bodies in literal concentration camps, but I guess that’s not quite enough to scare away Activision-Blizzard from trying to make more money. Figures.
---
Yeah I've sunk a few grand into it. It hurts, but on the other hand you're *saving* money by not putting any more in!
---
I understand the outrage, and it’s fine to call out Blizzard on it. I don’t have a problem with that. Initially I did, but initially I thought it was just a bitch about Blizzard and not this specific and more recent event. That’s why I apologized. I just shot off about something when I should’ve just said nothing really. 
---
My post was more of an apology for talking out of my ass than anything else.
---
I enjoy Blizzard games and will continue to spend money on them.
---
Remember to give a 1 star review if you own an Apple or Android device :)
---
I am gonna change my name to, “flight for freedom, stand with hong kong”

Call for Blizzard, ban all your players who value democracy
---
If someone got banned for BLM I would see public outrage and mass uninstallations already.
---
Disrepute is always a sliding scale.
---
Pro players are allowed to do so, outside of non political platforms.
---
No issues if someone interviewed him outside of the event and he give his views.
---
For the purpose of costume, like $30. A real quality one can be in the hundreds
---
Blizzard has been taking a politics stance for years by not allowing Taiwanese players to play under their own flag. This is over the line though. Fuck them.
---
no one is naive if anyone is naive it is you who is so caught up in the cause that you do not see what kind of prescient this sets if it is left unpunished.
---
The violated rule was quoted as "Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute..."
---
Ironic
---
LOCK THIS THREAD RIGHT NOW.
---
You mean you want the hearthstone tournament interviews to be about hk, kashmir, impeaching trump, migrants?
---
Yup, apparently voicing support for a protest for democracy against a totalitarian regime is controversial now lmao
---
I've never gotten that combination of cards in hand at the same time.
---
The way I beat it was to start with Reno, try to survive as long as you can. If you survive long enough to get the gatling wand you have a pretty decent chance of winning. If Reno dies before you get the wand then just concede and try again. Just save Lei Flamepaw and the gatling wand till you have enough damage to kill him. With that strategy it might be best to save Elise till last so addarah can clear the board before you fire the wand.
---
Do you support their decision?
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
So this reads that calls for democracy damages Blizzard image?
---
What possible image do they want to give? That they are against democracy? Against human rights? Is that the shit that they sell you at Blizzcon? 
---
I'm sorry but I'm not spending any cent on anything Blizzard. They are done and can go ahead and bow to the CCP with Tencent for what I care.
---
okay didn't know that :/
---
Isn't the official position of your government that Taiwan is the one "true" China, forced out of the mainland by the Communist revolution? And haven't the majority of Taiwanese people identified as Chinese until quite recently?
---
Just like the NBA

---
 Mysticel#2776 EU 80g quest trade. I can show, you go first.
---
100% done. Putting my money where my mouth is. I can live without these games. Freedom will always come before entertainment. You're not getting another god damn cent from me, or another minute of my time until you value human beings before your capitalist desires.
---
I am pretty sure if they started interviewing people about kashmir, yemen, impeaching trump they will get banned too.
---
Or do you disagree?
---
Who doesn't someone type it something short. Meaniningful and hard hitting. Everyone copy and paste this and flood their social media. Non stop post it every few hours. With a link to the video and post. 
---
Also if your attending blizcon please go dressed as HK protesters. 
---
Fuck blizzard and fuck china. And fuck Pooh
---
I don't think it's just Americans. What the chinese government is doing is breaking like lost of the Chinese populations human rights, an act that is generally frowned upon by humans.
---
It isn't about americans thinking they are the best, i don't even know how you got that? It's just about humans caring about other humans rights.
---
Not a cent more to Blizzard
---
Sadly this will push Blizzard to keep pursuing Chinese profits even further.
---
Easy for you to say when you are not running the company. Imagine a company losing around 30% to 40% of their customers instantly. No one will burn those money because of morals. That is the cold hard truth of the world. Money talks, morals don't. We can do all the finger pointing, they should do this, do that, but the real question is are morals more important to a company than facing bankruptcy.
---
Shame on Blizzard for caving. Fuck the Chinese government and anyone who supports it
---
As I already mentioned, they are getting money from people, not the ccp. Care to elaborate, how exactly these money are "dirty"? You basically call them to punish chinese players for their government's wrongdoing.
---
Yeah, this was far, far over the line. Not to mention all the awful crap Blizzard has done the past year of time.
---
No more of this company’s garbage.
---
Money.
---
I prefer searx.me personally, compilates results of multiple search engines, is fully open source and doesn't store any personal information.
---
\&gt; THERE WAS NOTHING THE CASTERS COULD DO.
---
There certainly is something, just refuse to interview him since they knew. How come you guys can't accept simple concepts like responsibility. Hong Kong protesters love bringing up fascist examples so I'll use one here myself even though I hate resorting to it. Readers can think of it this way. The Nuremberg trials imprisoned and executed not just all the operators of the gas chambers and the guys who ran the gas chambers. They also executed anyone who knew the guards were killing Jews in the gas chamber but did nothing to stop it. Even if the person did nothing except stand guard outside the camp or sewed clothes for the prisoners. It doesn't matter if you weren't the guy who pressed the button, AS LONG AS YOU KNOW, you are culpable.
---
If the production team knew it too, they ought to be fired as well but I suspect it was the team who fired the casters in order to protect their own jobs.
---
Well if this happens, there won't be a league.
---
The competitive rule is literally that they are not a platform to spread political views and messages. The pointed out the specific rule so it didnt look like some arbitrary decision.
---
did you mean honey?
---
I regret buying overwatch and playing hearthstone every now and then at all. Will never see my money again you, suck a big one blizzard.
---
You know, defense of humans right can be considered not a political view, but the only view accepted. Its just like you are not allowed to defend nazism in most democracies, but you are allowed to study them even at schools. Same goes to defending slavery or freedom. One is a crime.
---
what is the protests about in hong kong? I couldn't find info on internet, is it being hushed?
---
Okay thats it. I'm done. Uninstalled. Account deleted. Fuck you Blizzard.
---
I won't say you're wrong there, what I will say is wrong in general is bemoaning something as being "too political" in this specific context.
---
Insofar as PR nightmare, Blizzard has come out to support a totalitarian, imperialist regime, that locks people up by the millions in concentration camps.
---
**THAT** sounds like the real PR nightmare to me. I am seeing people left right and centre saying they are taking down their Battle.net.
---
Simply taking down the Twitch clip would've been one thing. But this is a clear message that Blizzard cares more for the Chinese market than basic human rights.
---
Firebat maybe. With streaming he has another scource of income tho. 
---
Frodan is a Twitch employee if im correct, and only gets hired as a Caster for Blizzard events . Not sure if the y could fire him. And it would be a real No\_balls move from him not mentioning annything of "this" here next Omnistone..
---
many do.
---
do we know about their responsibility here? like, do we know if they were explicitly told to not get involved with this matter, and thus they did not fulfill their own job or something?
---
They fired the casters too? :/ I mean, even if what what was said was BAD—it was absolutely NOT—the casters are not responsible and can only do so much.
---
Wow it’s almost as though companies care more about their bottom line than the rights of their customers
---
Welp, I'm glad tombs of terror is fun, because I'm not buying shit from this company for the rest of my life.
---
Well i guess Blizzard is a military court to you / agent of martial law.  Have fun talking to yourself from now on...
---
As Hong Konger and a avid NBA &amp; Hearthstone fan... Both these incidents are extremely disappointing with regards to how both multi-national corporations. I'll stick to the Hearthstone side of things, since this hearthstone's page...
---
First I would like to thank @blitzchung for standing with the people with Hong Kong, I am not sure how ready he was to take these punishments and from Blizzard but it speaks to his bravery and morality that he chose to do this on such an international scale. It made me, and my friends alike who are also from Hong Kong, play Hearthstone and share the same political views and concerns extremely proud. Yet, we might have been naive to think that Blizzard would have had equal bravery (or the balls) to allow for a personal expression of one's personal beliefs to be shared during it's competitions.   
---
There are corporations who only care about making money and nothing else, and there are other corporations who care a ton about making money but with  conscientiousness to put forth a stance where they are able to make money yet support basic human rights and the freedom on individual speech while doing so (Blizz is headquartered in a country where Democracy is one of it's leading values). I am not expecting Blizzard to come out with some grand post about human rights, I simply thought that Blizzard will not go so far as to ban and fire those who were involved simply for expressing their individual view, it wasn't even like a rant from Blitz, it was simply 8 Chinese characters which was "Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times". If I did a poll on the player base, I believe most players would totally be fine with this, but yet Blizzard feels the need to bow down to Chinese money and it's regime... This is exactly what Hong Kongers are facing, just like the NBA and just like Blizzard and Blitz now... every time somebody or someone expresses their own personal beliefs about a topic that is anti-communist..... They get punished or pressured by China. This is exactly the gist of the problem... 
---
I'm not just ranting on and on... but I just wanted to express how f'ing disappointed I am with Blizzard... Guess time to move on.
---
That south park episode continues to be true.
---
I'd love to hear comments on this from some of the more popular Blizzard games streamers. Will they continue to stream Blizzard games?
---
An active playerbase is always worth money. I enjoy HS a lot but personally I'm uninstalling. It's the only way (imo) to truly send a message.
---
Uninstalled battle.net and hearthstone immediately.
---
Yeah that sucks and I'm in the same camp. At least for me I won't support their esport scene anymore. I still enjoy hearthstone, so it is hard for me to give that up for now.
---
Thank God Blizzard protects us from the real evil  - video game titties. Who cares about China?
---
If you're upset then just stop giving them money. The app being on your computer doesn't benefit them.
---
Pathetic. Then to really hammer home the fact their Chinese lap dogs, they disable comments on that post.
---
Activision/Blizzard are absolute scum.
---
Already are. There are more slaves now, then during the transatlantic slave trade.
---
From wiki (long)
---
As Stan Marsh sits in his room attempting to write a song for his new death metal band, Crimson Dawn, his father Randy Marsh announces to the family that he plans to travel to China and expand the family's Tegridy Farms marijuana business there. However, when he boards a plane to China, he sees many other people are also traveling there for the same reason, including characters belonging to Disney. He is arrested in China when marijuana is discovered in his luggage. He is sentenced to prison where he witnesses the practice of summary execution, and is subjected to slave labor, torture, and Communist Party re-education.
---
During a Crimson Dawn rehearsal, the band is visited by a music producer who wants to make a biographical film, or "biopic" of the band, as traditional music resources such as albums and tours are no longer profitable. Stan, who desperately wants to leave his farm home, is thrilled. During their first meeting, when the film's structure is discussed, the band learns that certain aspects of the band's lives will have to be edited out in order to make the film marketable in China due to their censorship of the media.
---
In prison Randy meets fellow prisoners Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who are there because they were banned in China after internet memes comparing Chinese president and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping to Disney's version of Pooh became popular. When Randy is brought before a court, he criticizes the Chinese government for the way it treats its prisoners, accusing them of lacking "integrity". When Mickey Mouse learns of Randy's criticism, however, he angrily confronts Randy over the Chinese customers he is losing because of it, but Randy holds firm on his beliefs that business should not be conducted on the basis of intimidation, and expresses his marijuana import idea to him. When Mickey and Randy make their case to the Chinese officials together, their offer is rejected, which Mickey attributes to the Winnie-the-Pooh matter. Randy is so angered at this that he lures Pooh to a secluded street with honey, and kills him as a horrified Piglet watches.
---
As the Crimson Dawn film is shot, the censorship continues to the point that Chinese officials are on set to approve its content. The producer asks Stan to rewrite the script "from his heart", but Stan is frustrated by a Chinese censor standing over his shoulder as he writes in his bedroom, erasing passages he does not approve of. Later with his bandmates, Stan realizes that the only film that will even be accepted in China is something "vanilla and cheesy". Stan's best friend, Kyle Broflovski, disembarks from a bus with Eric Cartman following their stay in an ICE detention center in the previous episode. The friends' reunion inspires an idea for Stan.
---
Stan briefly reunites his previous band Fingerbang for a new biopic, but changes his mind during filming, saying that no matter how badly he wishes to leave the farm, he cannot bring himself to compromise for China, and commenting that anyone who does is worthless in his view. Meanwhile, Tegridy Weed has become legal in China. As a dump truck unloads a massive amount of cash at the farm during a family meal, Stan asks Randy why he is covered in honey and blood. When Randy discloses that he murdered Pooh, Stan calmly leaves the table to go write another song about his father.
---
Unprofessional is violating rules you chose to adopt when you signed up to do the tournament. He could have expressed his views on his own twitch channel, Discord, Facebook, Twitter, etc..... and face no backlash.
---
It literally is. Not enough details and news on the Uighur situation.
---
Actually just saw their stance on the HK/China protests - Fuck paying.
---
 
---
Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times.
---
Wage slaves are a thing.
---
Yeah, I have already decided to not play any of their games after I saw the news. 
---
Perhaps we should also delete our accounts as well, if they don't apologize, rehire the casters and refund Blitzchung his money?
---
I had just recently re-installed the Blizzard launcher and finished up re-installing all the games I played on there. Was going to get in on that WoW Classic.
---
Uninstalling everything now. Unless they retract their decision and issue a statement saying they were wrong to fire those two casters and that player, I will not be playing any Blizzard IP anymore.
---
Goodbye Warcraft 3 remastered.
---
As a Chinese, it's easy to get through the Wall. Reddit is also banned in China, and I am here writing a comment lol
---
Buck Flizzard.
---
Exactly, that will hurt blizzard more than anything.
---
Yeah i think im done with blizzard.
---
Would you put your job on the line for Hong Kong? If not then why are you asking others to do it?
---
Honestly this has been one of the worst expansions and most boring adventures so far. 
---
They've run out of ideas and a surviving on the goodwill of WoW.
---
One easy step is to delete the horrible mobile app
---
or just get new ones, it isn't hard to just invite more people.
---
Inaction is an action. Being quiet defends the status qou.
---
FUCK THIS SHIT
---
It's over for me, too. Blizzard and the Chinese government can suck it.
---
FYI Tencent might own GGG, but it was said that Tencent won't ever interfere into what happens on GGG's side... not saying that it wont ever happen, but it didnt for now. So let's keep it that way and stop shaming company that did nothing wront (yet).
---
Letters mean nothing.  The only thing they deal in is money.  Stop giving them money and they will pay attention.
---
Fuck you Blizzard.
---
Doing morally wrong things in order to make more profit is dirty, creating dirty money.
---
Giving up Blizzard games will be hard, but not nearly as hard as what the citizens of Hong Kong are going through. I can't stomach supporting a company like that though.
---
Everyone seems to be missing this point.
---
Mutual funds have diverse portfolios including tech stocks Blizzard Activision is a widely traded tech stock, and the CEO won’t be sued the whole company will be, most likely in a class action suit by everyone who would lose greats sums of money by Blizzard value dropping.
---
Well here's the thing: I expect that the creative teams care a lot more about the "woke stuff" than the finished games suggest. But Blizzard straddles the fence to have just enough of it to appeal to progressive players, without alienating the conservative players, so they can make money from both. Corporate Blizzard does whatever is profitable, and creative Blizzard has to adapt to that.
---
Right but the casters basically said "yeah go ahead and break this rule we won't stop you" and that's more than enough for Blizz to fire them to appease China
---
Stopped playing blizzard games almost a year ago. But after this bs I won’t even consider buying the new CoD
---
That was the clipped I watched. I watched it again just to be sure.
---
This was what happened in the clip (translation by me)
---
Virtual 偷米: Just say the 8 words and we can end the interview here. No need to chat more after that. Is that ok producer?
---
Virtual 偷米: Let's lower our heads *giggling sounds*
---
Blitzchung: 光復香港，時代革命！
---
Virtual 偷米: Ok we can come back to us now. Wow, 璁哥 Brother Chung. *Claps*. Was that too short? I think that's enough. 
---
&gt; Neither caster said nothing and did nothing to deserve this. They even said, "You can say whatever you want, and say it when you are ready to go. We'll just duck our heads down."
---
This isn't what you portrayed in your comment.
---
Also, I'm aware of 偷米's facebook comments about how the producer put him in a bad spot.
---
"We're sorry for defending Democracy" is the single most Un-American/Western line in history.
---
Yep. What happened here is a new low for Blizzard.  
---
I have been playing since the Beta, but that's it for me. Time to play games from other companies.
---
So are regular slaves
---
***Return this card to your hand
---
"shut up and dribble" lol
---
Ah but isnt it Ralph from simpsons who says something like that?
---
And its pretty fucked up that blizzard bends over so easily for china..
---
Uninstalled today after hearing about this, fuck blizzard
---
How are people shocked? The Blizzard ship's been sinking years ago lul
---
&gt;easily replaced entertainment products
---
That seems to be the general response to this: they don’t make something I need, so I’ll take a stand on this. 
---
Not to call you out in particular (it’s a lot of people) or even to say if it’s right or if it’s wrong (not my place to judge you, or your means/life situation), but I do want people to consider that arbitrary aspect to this, especially in light of how most of us feel about the, “too big to fail,” justification we’ve heard from our politicians.
---
That's just an example to show you that the real world doesn't give a shit about excuses. But you're free to continue believing your delusions in how the real world works.
---
protip: Blizzard is a corporations, a corporation's only duty-bound to its shareholders. They don't believe in shit like social justice and democracy. If you do shit that affects their $$$, you get sacked.
---
"shut up and dribble"
---
Started playing this game from beta, now, I will stop playing and spending anything on this anymore
---
Fuck you Blizzard
---
South Park has always been pretty on the money with their social commentary.
---
People having different opinion automatically = China apologist. Got it.
---
Hong Kong has 7.5 million people and at most 2m was out to protest against the extradition law.  Now the law is officially retracted they still out there and destroy. Tell me why should I continue to support their cause? I know I am wasting my breath with you but hopefully others will are my view. The silent majority’s view.
---
Not touching the HK stuff, but legion was probably their best expansion ever and MoP was really good.  If you quit playing back in wotlk then idk how you would feel fit to judge, and if you played legion and thought it was trash then... idk
---
Don't make your decisions based on what others are doing, or if you think it will matter or not.
---
The question is, does it matter to you? Does what Blizzard did affect your opinion of them in anyway? Is what they did enough to say "Nah, that doesn't align with my morals, I'm out"? Or do you not care enough about that to stop playing (that is a legitimate take to have, many people will not care about this and will continue playing because it doesn't align with their morals, people have different values and morals, and for the most part, nothing wrong with that).
---
So, ignore what anyone else is doing. Ignore what 'impact' you think you can make by playing or not playing. Decide for yourself, "Do I want to continue supporting Blizzard after all this controversy?" and make your decision based upon YOUR OWN values.
---
The choice is yours, don't let others influence your decisions (not even me).
---
&gt;Banning speech supporting one side of a political conflict makes Hearthstone a political platform. It may be implicit rather than explicit support, but they're clearly supporting one political position and rejecting the other.
---
Both positions are banned, not just one.
---
Such total and absolute BS, utterly dissappointed in Blizzard and I hope they choke on the money. 
---
Can we as a community do something? Can we change our names to blitzchung in support? Or something like HKRevolution
---
That's exactly how Chinese government is indirectly influencing any company that works with the Chinese market to censorship anything they dislike.
---
The irony is that this has done far more damage to their “public image” than that comment would ever have done
---
I see what is happening now. You are talking about it in the context of the American first amendment, but I see freedom of speech as a universal principle not coming from USA myself. So from my point of view this certainly does violate freedom of speech, but I'm not taking about law here.
---
Just my opinion, but they shouldn't be sueable for that. I'm obviously not a lawmaker, not even american, so only tangentially related, but a company shouldn't be shackled down to making profits at seemingly all costs like that. Morals should come before money and I would like laws to support that instead.
---
That's a visual bug on mobile.

Sure. It’s so east to find on YouTube.  Link after work

How'd a blank card get this many upvotes?
---
I hope this changes something, anything. I will stop spending money on their games but I doubt we are enough of a crowd to cause a change.
---
Ok winnie the pooh
---
bli$$ard
---
Blizzard/Activision is one tiny portion of a mutual fund. That's the point of it. Even if blizzard collapses tomorrow, your fund should theoretically be OK because you've got tons of others in there.
---
The housing market crashed. Tons of companies made stupid decisions and crashed. No class action lawsuit happened. Laws exist to prevent people in charge from being held responsible.
---
I agree with this, but we all need to let blizzard know directly! They new to have it on record just how many people are disgusted with their handling of this situation!
---
I'm saying that if literally all the GM players come out and support HK, the league will be killed before they let that affect their bottom line. There's no way that the money they generate from HS esports touches the money from China, and they've shown their hand about what they care about with this cowardly decision.
---
Wow, you mean a business will fire or get rid of you if they don’t need or want you? Hmmm. Sounds like the real world or something.
---
And tons of HS players have switched over to TFT.
---
Costs 0 if a protestor is in play.
---
Ohhh nooo! why won't anyone think of the multi-billion dollar company blizzard! ohhh noooo!
---
Bro, shut the fuck up. They literally make the most sold video game *yearly*. Blizzard makes more money in a day than 99.9% of people will make in a *lifetime*. 
---
Blizzard is not dependent on china. 
---
Would it hurt their bottom dollar? Sure.
---
Will the company go under? Are you fucking kidding me.
---
Suck a dick Blizzard.
---
They wouldn't care about statements regarding US politics. Nobody would ban them from the US for allowing such a thing. China on the other hand is a dictatorship at this point. If Blizzard didn't act the way they did, Chinese government would probably have banned Hearthstone and future tournaments in their country altogether. It's a fucked up move by Blizzard but there is so much money on the stake that it was a no-brainer for them. They only value morals as long as it doesn't disturb their business.
---
Ok
---
See in one of those countries you're free to criticize the leadership and their actions.
---
Because criticising leadership is fundamentally necessary. They're not gonna just "*not commit the crime of criticizing the CCP and CCP leaders*"
---
Are you Chinese? Are you a wumao shill who sells out China to the CCP government?
---
Yes, American. Which means they sold out to China for the money. It's the American way...
---
Blizzards shows where their allegiances lie.
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. To borrow a turn of phrase from Steve Jobs, everything good about Blizzard has been rotted out of the company. They no longer care about anything but the bottom line, and with that they have become just like every other shitty large game developer that's sold its soul. Fuck off Blizzard.
---
Are people not allowed to Express freewill anymore guess not blizzard wont be spending another penny on hearthstone.
---
Thank you from HK.
---
We do need help, the CCP is horrible and you can tell how they raise their citizens. Thousands of our younger generation is brutally abused by the CCP police, all their uncivilized moves are poisoning the whole world.
---
First NBA, now hearthstone, whats next?
---
We will never back down.
---
Because 800 people losing their jobs is not the same as millions of people being abused for standing up for their rights. Those 800 people still have an opportunity to transition to a new job with some effort. The millions protesting out in HK are currently facing far worse dangers than that and the corporate overlords at Activision think profits are more important than basic human rights.
---
You are responsible either way, looking away is also taking a side.
---
Stop supporting blizzard, don’t play any of their games dont give them your money and delete all their games off your PC/ systems. Supporting companies that do not care about you or your fellow man. Thin about it they’re selling out human lives in HK what makes any of us think we’re any more important to them than residents of China? If capitalism is the way the world wants to work remember it can’t work without your money. Let them fucking know.
---
This is gonna go over well.
---
If it was just this decision, I could see Blizzard's perspective. I don't think it's unreasonable to not allow the use of your tournament as a political soapbox even if it's a good cause rather than waiting until somebody uses the platform for a cause you cannot support.
---
But hiding behind a catch-all rule ripe for abuse makes Blizzard look bad, and I'm disinclined to give them the benefit of the doubt when they've already fucked with the game because the CCP demanded it.
---
He got a heart. He got balls. Way more brave than lil pussy ass bitches of NBA.
---
People who pay and support these actions are part of the problem.
---
They totally can but it'd be pretty fun nonetheless.
---
Well, 3 days ago my whole guild moved server from alliance to horde. we all paid atleast 55€ per trasnfare. and some of us (like me) moved 2 characters or more.
---
thats easily ~1100€ just straight into blizzard pockets. 
---
your "boycott" will honestly, not mean shit for blizzard. or every person CLAIMING to boycott, 2 new people start playing, and 2 additional ones buy wow tokens.
---
if you are tired of all this stuff, just un-sub, uninstall battle.net app, and move on with your life.
---
Blizzard died when they merged with Activision.
---
[Blizzard is the Edgar suit.](http://66.media.tumblr.com/27190afaa5457c75524587de5ecac79a/tumblr_nihnccAk5B1rp0vkjo1_500.gif)
---
Well done and good for you. It was ridiculous what they did.
---
I live in Hong Kong and it offended me a lot when they did that. I'll give it a week for them to apologise and reverse what they did or I'm uninstalling too. 
---
Shame
---
That's never going to happen. Bliz has been taken over by activision. Money before all else.
---
ggwp.
---
nope, the color here is not green, RMB is red
---
I don't have many blizzard games. I just have overwatch. However, I have gone ahead and deleted it. Its really not much, but I support HK and want to do the right thing.
---
just uninstalled battle.net and hearthstone
---
 Already canceled my WoW subscription. Didn't play it that much anyways.
---
Blizzard is choosing money over human rights.
---
well it probably used to be like that.
---
but it's now year 2019, not 1999. we have facebook, twitter, reddit and many other social media. if a company only cares about its profit, but not its image, customers' experience, it's well within their rights to do so and in the short-term, their earnings wouldn't be affected. but in the long term? after displeasing their target customers? well good luck to that company.
---
put it another way, you're not wrong to say that the corporation is duty-bound to its shareholders. but "only" duty-bound to its shareholders? remember this, they need a profit to answer to shareholders. and where do their profit come from? yep, money of the customers in the market. angering the potential customers certainly isn't the best trick to bring in more income i'd say.
---
Can someone explain to me what exactly did they do for Blizzard to take action?
---
It's likely that people _working for_ Blizzard really do care and want to support the cause though.
---
Blizzard just allows them to do so, so long as it doesn't threaten their profits.
---
If it's a choice between profits and _doing the right thing_ then the corporate overlords are going to choose the profits.
---
To all the people saying "blizz doesn't care if they lose a few thousand players from the west over this xD" the people working at blizzard are mostly from America, Blizzard's HQ is in America, do you think they don't have feelings? They don't wish that their friends and neighbours and country would love their products?
---
As a company Blizzard won't suffer that much, but as a group of individuals working there, threads like these hurt the workers browsing the forums, and if the workers leave and they have to be replaced 1 by 1, that hurts profit a LOT.
---
I've been playing Hearthstone since Naxx and I've bought every expansion since BRM. Sometimes I enjoyed the meta, sometimes I hated it, but I still stuck around.
---
I won't be buying another expansion.
---
I'll be sad to leave. I love this game and I think the devs have been taking it in a great direction recently. But I can't justify supporting it anymore.
---
Blizzard has very clearly made their choice: money over morals. Let them suffer the repercussions of that choice. They'll never see my money again.
---
Again, they post on other game subs. I accounted for 'play but not visit', but it's clear that the majority isn't actually invested in the game telling others to quit.
---
As per our rules, no calls to action please, no matter how strongly we may feel on the subject.
---
If you wish to discuss Blitzchung's situation further: https://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/devia0/blizzard_ruling_on_hk_interview_blitzchung/
---
I thinks it's developed on a blockchain, meaning every card actually has real value and can be traded like in real life.
---
Care to develop? If anything I’m defending blizzard for getting undeserved hate by trying to stay out of the discussion, I’m not expressing my political opinion because it doesn’t matter on this issue I’m talking specifically about politics IN the game and I appreciate it being clean of them, the protest is a whole other discussion, there are rules man, if someone breaks them they get punished, no need to talk about a highly divisive topic on stream
---
We all understand that he broke the rules but if that was any other couse like saving rain forest or climate change he would still be around what is outrageous is influence of China over blizzard.
---
I’m sorry is basketball not a game as well? None of this shit matters. Yet people will rally and kick up a fuss over this inconsequential shit that will be forgotten in 3 weeks tops.
---
Free Hong Kong
---
The same reason why the US is increasingly being fucked over by the ruling elite. Compare your actions to the student in HK. They’ve been protesting for weeks and you couldn’t be arsed to cancel a subscription. Attitudes like yours are why the world is burning.
---
it is over for me
---
Same! Probably considered a whale but absolutely fuck blizzard after this
---
You all must uninstall crony capitalism can't be allowed to continue.
---
Nah. Blizzard will engage in politics when they want to. All the pro-lgbq stuff kind of limits their ability to claim neutrality. 
---
they threw the book at him. That clause was likely there to make sure some kid didn't come out and drop a bunch of hard Rs, not supporting their hometown.
---
Fuck blizzard, fuck the China and Hong Kong government
---
The Chinese market is probably more important to them than the west. Whatever players they loose here they gain from China.
---
100% true
---
Of course it's obvious but they deliberately avoided the word "politics" or even implied it was because of that. They knew if they made any reference to blitzchung's "free HK" speech there would be a shitstorm. Little did they know, it's going to be an even bigger shitstorm waiting for them.
---
The statement they chosen to release is for simpletons like you to harp on "rules" and not the very obvious stance they have taken. (China's money if you haven't figure it out)
---
I agree 100%. Just saying that implicitly blaming the community for something Blizzard has started is not a good way to appeal to their sense of reason.
---
There is a difference between criticising leadership constructively and sowing discord. 
---
Yes I am Chinese, but I’m not a citizen of China.
---
Lmao, I don't give a fuck where you're from, but I can see you're a great person. Just stay away with your greatness from my shithole please :)
---
Maybe now we can survive China's tanks.
---
Magic the gathering arena Is still a thing people and now is the best time to start because they just rotated into a new cycle of cards.

Except the current China that you know stole the seat of power from RoC and used it to strongarm/force all other nation to not acknowledge Taiwan's sovereignty.
---
There isn't much equal comparison to what happened in the modern world, but the gist of it is that the outcome should've been like North/South Korea split where there're 2 sovereign nation. But instead you have one side pressuring everyone else internationally that the other doesn't exist.
---
I mean 'Company' or more particularly 'Corporation'. Understand that this isn't a failure of the system but a success. So long as Executives are beholden to Shareholders and Shareholders alone you cannot expect them to operate with any sense of decency or morality.
---
I do not know the specifics of what was said but I can gather given the Hong Kong bit. This will not be the first or last terribly immoral decision that either is monstrous or props up monstrous behaviours. If a company is willing to use a Tax Haven, assume it does enough terrible things to warrant not purchasing its goods. If you try not purchasing from all companies that do so, you will likely starve.
---
Luckily I haven't been playing Hearthstone for about two years, not wanting to support that cash-grab... but I guess I'll be deleting Overwatch as well.
---
I understand we are all outraged about what happened, but this post breaks our rules.
---
what did epic do btw?
---
Fucking blizzard/Activision. Great job running your company to the ground! First Diablo immortals, now this. 
---
No hope
---
They don't get to pretend to be neutral after all the lgbq and progressive shilling.
---
In fact, it should be mandatory to say fuck blizzard once in a while.
---
Fuck Blizzard
---
&gt; good games they're actually known for
---
But Blizzard is known for wow, hearthstone and overwatch?
---
gaming =/= the world
---
Damn...
---
The NBA, South Park, and now Blizzard all in a week.
---
All the Chinese people living on the mainland believe that the Hongkong movement is a bunch of separatist and terrorists. That's the power of censoring and creating your own bubble for you.
---
A decrease is a decrease. If China is more important than the rest of the markets, then that's great. Blizzard can gtfo and work with China exclusively.
---
True enough. But taking away the free speech argument, blizzard banning the player means that he said something they consider unspeakable.
---
This leaves us with 2 options.
---
Either, as i stated previously, blizzard got scared because China might get mad.
---
Or blizzard considers stating political opinions to be an absolute no-go. Which, as you stated, would be legally fine, since they aren't bound by free speech. But to me, personally, they still have a moral obligation to it. Else we're going toward a world where pro hearthstone players have to be scared of any interview they give, because they might say something blizzard doesn't like and get banned for that. Now i don't know about you, but that is not a thing i would want to see.
---
I'm quitting all blizzard games today,never getting anything from me ever again.
---
I play diablo 3 and hots, but guess its time to uninstall blizzard launcher.
---
looks like I have to do the same
---
Goodbye blizzard. I hope this hurts you and i hope people start caring about morals in a company. I am going to vote with my wallet.
---
If you need that moba itch you can try Smite or League, at least League wise I have played both enough that I can reccomend a similar champ
---
Not a hearthstone player but I just sent feedback via [battle.net](https://battle.net) application stating why I just uninstalled Overwatch (basically because I think Blizzard's response to the incident was way too heavy-handed) and then I promptly uninstalled [battle.net](https://battle.net) too.
---
A company is for profit? 
---
surprised pikachu face
---
( copying my comment from r/overwatch )
---
Deleting your account accomplishes nothing just don't buy more stuff
---
All this does is lead to People realising in a few months that they quite like the game, Get a new account and buy it again
---
Destroying your own property is never an effective boycott since you've already paid for it. It just leads to a delayed increase in sales
---
After 5 years of spending money on HS from time to time, today I deleted my account. I was worried that I would not stick to the decision of not buyong anything from them ever again, so I just deleted it. I feel free now.
---
Good PR move to swoop in on the BlizzChina debacle but a welcome one, will check out your game for showing your support to Blitzchung
---
What goes on in HK is bigger than some flimsy tournament rules and bigger than Blizzard 
---
Them handing out the maximum possible punishment to all people involved is sending a signal. And it's a stomach turning one
---
A gaming company actively taking part in government repression goes far beyond what I as a customer am willing to support. They've really crossed a line for me.
---
Absolutely disgusting, disappointing and shameful
---
I wasn't playing any currently but after the past week I won't be buying blizzard products again.
---
Well, steering the big ship right into the cliffs for gold sounds familiar. If it doesn't work, mention god and push your responsibilities away.
---
Way more f2p friendly, I've found. Dislike the daily limit on wins (wish they kept giving gold at like 10/win), but it's pretty fine as is.
---
I see people saying this, but here’s the thing. The Chinese market is huge and they make a lot of money from it, but they would *still* make a huge profit even if not in that market - just not as huge a profit as they do now. They would *not* be working at a loss, they are *not* a small, independent company that relies solely on the Chinese market.
---
At the end of the day, we have to accept that, like the firing of all those people earlier this year to appease shareholders, this is a *choice* made by them to pick obscene profits over human rights.
---
Please use this thread to discuss the situation: https://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/devia0/blizzard_ruling_on_hk_interview_blitzchung/
---
Man Bear Pig is the one where they make fun of Al Gore and his wacky "theory" of global warming from 2004 or some other year. And the 2 parter Let's get Cereal and Nobody got Cereal are from the 2018 season.
---
That's the game adwcta is working on
---
Did you really expect anything more from Activision?
---
That’s not clear, that’s speculative at best.
---
I’m really hoping Kripp quits HS over this. Unlike a lot of other streamers, he could easily switch over to PoE again until he finds something to replace HS (or Blizz reverses this).
---
It’s the vegan thing to do 🥦
---
Probably unpopular opinion: Blizzard did this guy a favour making this into much bigger news, more people are going to hear what he has to say.
---
Dick move, yeah. But they can be seen to be appeasing the Powers That Be whilst also being the cause of the spread of his message.
---
I generally agree with OP and only think politics belong in the gaming industry to a degree, if you're making  a game about a political situation or a certain region of the world where you need to be sensitive to certain subjects, views, lifestyles, cultures. It should be in the background, helping the industry be more inclusive and playable by all. 
---
In this case however it's just a gaming tournament and knowing the political affiliations of every player or whatever isn't necessary and doesn't serve the industry. 
---
Sure, it can be argued Blizzard looks like it cares for money for than freedom but they can't take stands on every issue, and arguably shouldn't take stands on any. Blizzard should just what they're there to do and won't alienate their fans one way or another.
---
And fucking hold Blizz  responsible too. At least the US matches are recorded ahead of time, so if it was so fucking controversial for Blizz, then they could have cut it out ahead of time
---
Also arent a massive amount of WoW gold farmers chinese? Havent played WoW in 5+ years, but when i was playing actively nearly every gold farmer / bot was chinese. Thats a substantial amount of membership fees alone.
---
“Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times” is the most common english verison of the slogan seen in HK.
---
Also yeah, fuck blizzard
---
I doubt most people want to get involved in politics that don't directly affect them.
---
Your money speaks the loudest, if you want to support hong kong protesters stop giving companies that actively fight them your money. I just deleted my long time account. Unacceptable Blizzard.
---
They need some Tegridy.
---
Really. That's the most logical statement you can make?
---
Yeah there are political platforms to do that.
---
Just like how you're not ever likely to see LGBT pride supported in China, since they censor that.
---
Any official promotional materials in China even hinting at gayness would probably cause the CCP to ban Overwatch entirely.
---
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
---
Someone rich enough to make an offer to buyout the company and then fund gaming development independently. That's a lot of money lol. You'd probably need around $50b for a buyout offer.
---
but it supports their true core value $$$$$$$$
---
Yikes! Does the government not collect the capital and redistribute as they see fit? Do they not control all private sector business? Can you operate a business without interference from the state? The answer is communism.
---
Fuck China
---
Xi is modern day hitler. He has concentration camps where they harvest organs from people
---
Goodbye, Hearthstone. This was the last push I needed. Reprehensible.
---
Kinda wish the remaining players all now use there interviews to shine light on the protests, fuck Blizzard and fuck China for this disgusting show
---
lol good thing destiny switched to steam so I’ll never have to use blizzard again
---
So in other words, “I’ll only protest when it’s convenient to me.”
---
Why bother saying something to a brainwashed citizen. No point at all talking to you. Move along.
---
You took words out of my mouth, blizzard is just dead to me.
---
MISSION STATEMENT
---
Dedicated to creating the most epic entertainment experiences...ever.
---
Blizzard Entertainment’s **eight core values** represent the principles and beliefs that have guided our company throughout the years. These values are reflected in employees' decisions and actions every day.
---
* gameplay **FIRST**Everything we do at Blizzard Entertainment is based on the success of the gaming experiences we provide our players. The goal of each discipline within the company -- be it art, programming or customer support -- is to make our games as fun as possible for as many people as we can reach.
---
* commit to **QUALITY**“Blizzard polish” doesn’t just refer to our gameplay experiences, but to every aspect of our jobs. We approach each task carefully and seriously. We seek honest feedback and use it to improve the quality of our work. At the end of the day, most players won’t remember whether the game was late -- only whether it was great.
---
* play nice; **PLAY FAIR**In our business first impressions are important -- but lasting impressions are everything. We strive to maintain a high level of respect and integrity in all interactions with our players, colleagues, and business partners. The conduct of each Blizzard Entertainment employee, whether online or offline, can reflect on the entire company.
---
* embrace your **INNER GEEK**Everyone here is a geek at heart. Cutting-edge technology, comic books, science fiction, top-end video cards, action figures with the kung-fu grip…. Whatever it is they’re passionate about, it matters that each employee embraces it! Their unique enthusiasm helps to shape the fun, creative culture that is Blizzard Entertainment.
---
* every voice **MATTERS**Great ideas can come from anywhere. Blizzard Entertainment is what it is today because of the voices of our players and of each member of the company. Every employee is encouraged to speak up, listen, be respectful of other opinions, and embrace criticism as just another avenue for great ideas.
---
* think **GLOBALLY**Everywhere on the planet there are people who play Blizzard Entertainment games. While respecting the cultural diversity that makes people unique, we strive to grow and support our global gaming community. We also seek the most passionate, talented people in the world to enrich our company and help us forge the future vision of Blizzard Entertainment.
---
* lead **RESPONSIBLY**Our products and practices can affect not only our employees and players -- but the industry at large. As one of the world’s leading game companies, we’re committed to making ethical decisions, always keeping our players in mind, and setting a strong example of professionalism and excellence at all times.
---
* learn &amp; **GROW**The games industry is ever-changing. Technology improves, techniques change, and design philosophies become outdated. Since the founding of Blizzard Entertainment, we’ve worked to improve through experience, teaching one another and cultivating the desire to be the best at what we do. We see this as an individual responsibility as well as a company one. Employees can count on their peers, managers, and the company itself to be supportive and help them gain the knowledge and training they need.
---
True, that’s just a game. But regarding China, do we have to start doing something after they done something to yourself personally? After they block the online media? How can I still post in reddit at that moment?
---
So you expect them to give up their income and maybe even their families income just to support this thing they might not even and have no obligation to care about?  Its so much easier for you and me to do it because we dont have to sacrifice anything but they are risking almost literally everything.
---
Seems to be the life cycle of gaming companies. They either die heroes, or live long enough to turn shitty.
---
support fellow HKer!
---
I wonder what will happen if Blitczchung chooses to stream Gods Unchained during HS Grandmaster's playoffs.
---
free trade is the first thing to go out the window when political dissent happens between nations lmao.....
---
See: Present day USA.
---
Cool, have a good one buddy
---
I don't play much HS anymore, but I play OW, and I'll be uninstalling both later today. They can have Chinese money or mine. Let them choose China's, but maybe I won't have to feel guilty about what's happening to HK or the Uighurs (or Taiwan, or Tibet, or the organ harvesting, or...)
---
Reach out to Blizzard on social media and tell them. 
---
Unfortunately people leaving because of this are going to equal a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the money China makes them.
---
Hell yea. This was one of the most disgusting and transparently cynical things I have ever seen any game company do, and I hope there is more outcry from more sectors about this.
---
&gt;Same at Riot, before we had casters who would laugh how OP is a champ or how "questionnable" some plays are, now it's just impossible and you have to watch other streams than the main stream to have this kind of commenting.
---
reminds me of the time when casters had to commentate 5 tracer+1 lucio mirror matches in overwatch... it was impossible to understand what was going on, boring as fuck, but they had to very awkwardly try to make a pile of turd seem fun and balanced.
---
dark times
---
&gt;  Most games like ... LoL
---
it seems to be sneaking it's way to into LoL too, I thought I was going crazy, but the casters are constantly backpedaling on saying "hong kong" for the Hong Kong Assassins, a team currently at world's [several instances of them doing this](https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousCogentClipzKlappa)
---
Using the name of an anti communist and anti LGBTQ scare movement to criticize people calling out a capitalist company bending over to a bigoted government... I’m sure this will go down well.
---
Stop playing their games. Your decisions here *do* matter, they *are* important. We are talking about other people's freedom here, and soon it will be our own. China is an enemy of all free men.
---
Spent more than 10k?! Jeez, yea maybe you should quit. You should also send some money this way so i can finally buy some new shoes
---
Thank you. 
---
I while I do share your opinion on capitalism, supporting China through capitalist corporations doesn't seem like the right move to me personally. Also there are all those human rights violation accusations against China, so I'm not all that sure about the ethics of their exact methods. 
---
An interesting view to be sure, thanks!
---
I'm Czech, we were occupied by both, by one of them in my lifetime. I learned plently.
---
no its not different, thats my point.
---
Bli$$ard
---
I desperately hope you're wrong but I'm not optimistic. 
---
Everyone who downvoted your comment: I challenge you to prove it wrong.
---
It's damaging Blizzard's image in the eyes of the people who don't support the riots in HK... Just like saying "fuck trump" is damaging Blizzard's image in the eye of conservatives, and saying "free Palestine" is damaging the image for pro Israel...   
---
Mate, I really thought this was quite obvious...
---
Please use this thread to discuss the topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/devia0/blizzard_ruling_on_hk_interview_blitzchung/
---
Thank you Blizzard, really thank you.
---
There are protests going on worldwide and this is the first independent action I'm seeing for it. They're literally putting themselves behind HongKong because they recognize what's going on and how bad it is.
---
Maybe our news outlets could learn and we'll start to see "Protests in XXX going on - what you can do to help" but that just means the money goes somewhere else
---
Fuck Blizzard, Activision and China. As a fan since the Diablo 1 days, you aren’t getting a penny from me anymore. Pieces of shit
---
This ia blizzard's fault. They got involved
---
yeahhhhh  
---
feels bad :(
---
&gt;Taiwan is (mostly) not recognised as an independent country.
---
Just a straight lie
---
What do you believe communism is exactly?
---
*That’s the point of authoritarianism.
---
FTFY
---
Still think the punishment was unnecessarily harsh and that their rule is the same.
---
First they came for my cards and now they came for my players :(
---
The point is China has even MORE than that. That's why this immoral stuff is happening
---
You're using a vpn. Isn't that truth enough for you? Doesn't that give you the ability to find the truth yourself.
---
Ik ow the disinformation that is spread in the mainland, and it's very influential to you people.
---
You believe it over logic, because it supports your conviction and love for your country. To live and die under the red banner is a common message I heard.
---
Reddit is banned in China, too. So why are you using it if you're so loyal?
---
Switch to Shadowverse.
---
Unfortunately we're coming to a point where the Chinese market is so huge that businesses can afford to let some Western PR scandal cost them some profits. China has become a huge consumer. They're pretty much where the West was in the 20th century (minus the world wars). Their middle class is expanding rapidly and will continue to do so for several more decades. 
---
I think the only thing keeping them from being the most powerful country is that their national language is Mandarin. If it was English, I think we'd see most companies move their headquarters to china. They would also attract a huge amount of young raw talent in the sciences and business.
---
And I'm sure neighbouring countries did everything to appease him too. Neville Chamberlain, UK PM before ww2, has been given a lot of shit for giving concessions to Hitler, but at least he was ramping up Military Spending so the UK would soon be able to hold their own.
---
Here we are just conceding. Past ties/loyalty mean nothing, future benefits mean everything
---
I have been defending the player/casters in every post. But i agree with you. 
---
Noone is obliged to protest, nor express their opinions in the slightest. This is freedom. Freedom is noy always defending freedom because you must be allowed to at least stay quiet.
---
Altho, those who decide to fight deserve the community full suport
---
&gt; I guess it is around 1300 USD.
---
It might come as harsh, you are already a massive whale for blizz. you paid for yourself and another 40 players them losing you wont hurt htem much because you already spent so much and you made them a lot of money.
---
We should handle political issue with politicals means, not with our wallet.
---
You payed for that content and deserve it, if blizzard fucked up then you shouldn't be the one paying (literally) for it.
---
Human rights and justice are indeed more important then money: that a company/ a country respect them shouldn't depend on nice people being more wealthy then bad one.
---
That's just an extreme overreaction. If you truly believe this, then you should be boycotting far more than Blizzard, including Nike, Adidas, Lenovo, and many more companies.
---
Can someone pls summarise what happened? I’m completely out of the loop.
---
Oh, I though [sarcasm] was VERY obvious.
---
Sorry to break your kindergarten nap.
---
Lol....what a baby. Dude had a well thought out legitimate comment and this is what you reply with? Get over yourself kid
---
I think I'm going to take this fight to their Twitter.
---
Yeah. Like it's some kind of huge accomplishment to not play a game. Seeking validation probably.
---
It feels really bad because of the money i put into hearthstone, but if i only cared about money I wouldn’t be deleting it right now.
---
Revolution of our time.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/blitzchung](https://www.twitch.tv/blitzchung) 
---
AMA right now. you can ask in English and Blitzchung will answer in English
---
Ya'll can't behave
---
Oh yeah I'm not actually going to support Blizzard more because of this, that's just a little bit of edginess on my part.
---
"comments are disabled" 
---
Okay Blizz
---
Is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
Mtg also would shill out for China in a heartbeat. Don’t treat blizzard like some devil for conforming to Chinese pressures. Yeah it sucks that this is happening but a video game tournaments official blizzard stream is not the place to be spouting your political opinion and he knew what he was doing. It’d be like saying fuck trump because of ICE or many other reasons. You think blizzard wouldn’t kick that person out too? Grow up.
---
I don't disagree. But that's the way with many things. But in this particular case I feel that using the time you get to talk about the game series and tournament to talk about political issues is a breach of those rules. The rules even explicitly states that removal of tournament earnings will be done. I'm not condemning the player's action, but he must known it would have consequences. He must have weighed them against eachother and decided it was worth it. Which it very well might been.
---
&gt;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the pulic, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard's Website Terms.
---
If this is not reversed I will dump my blizzard account, free Hong Kong and fuck Blizzard for firing these brave individuals!.
---
It's crazy. Their entire civilization is a sham - the money is worth whatever the government says it is, you work the jobs you're assigned, you hold the beliefs you're told to, and eventually you have a majority of people who don't know any better, and lack the opportunity to figure out any other way of living. They cannot be treated like rational actors on the world stage, as if they're just another market to be tapped.
---
Hong Kong deserves independence, but the CCP deserves total annihilation. Unfortunately, those people won't ever understand why they should be free.
---
Freedom bad, actual literal conception camps GOOD
---
I'll add you tomorrow, reply so I see it in the morning pls.
---
It's ridiculously disrespectful for the torment that slaves went through. To have ones very humanity taken away compared to working a bad job is ridiculous
---
So...would Blizzard ban me/force me to change usernames if I were to change my username to "FreeHongKong"?  That fits in their 12 character limit.
---
America is riding china's cock lately pretty hard
---
Me too: [https://puu.sh/Eq9pv/8145d9559e.png](https://puu.sh/Eq9pv/8145d9559e.png)
---
Had Hearthstone, Starcraft 2, Diablo 3.
---
Been playing Elder Scrolls Legends which is a great card game, and was going to buy the new Call of Duty but I'll just do Destiny 2 instead.
---
Words cannot express how disappointed with Blizzard I am.
---
No they typically say things like "it's not pedophilia, its ephebophilia, totally different things."
---
Yeah I've noticed that aswell. It sucks a bit for the casting, but considering the situation in Hong Kong and how sensitive it is, I can understand Riot wanting to get as far away from it as possible.
---
Outrage is warranted, surprise is not. I don't think anyone is surprised that China has its fingers entrenched deep into western media, the effects are getting stronger by the year. Most people can tolerate it, even if it means Hollywood movies are a bit shittier now, and games are a bit shittier now, and there's more censorship all around. Most of it is innocuous (like the jacket on Top Gun removing the Taiwan and Japan flags, or changing skeletons in WoW, or giving Jaina less cleavage)
---
However, when a company stands in support of tyranny and fascism, in order to make money, then outrage is warranted. That's what we're seeing here, not really surprise. 
---
I don't really want to get too political here, so I'll leave it at that. There are plenty of others who will want to be more vocal.
---
Property is publicly owned, ie the state. Which is the case in China, you do as your told or they'll replace you. This shit is common knowledge lmao
---
Yes i know it was a stupid thing to announce mobile game from the main stage anyway, but if they at least released it afterwards it wouldn't be for nothing. Someone will be playing it anyway, and Blizzard would get their precious money. But they didn't. It's just stupid to announce something and never deliver.
---
Yes, it does. By a lot. Your fate is your own to decide. You are not a slave.
---
Jokes on you i hated blizzard like 2 years ago
---
Imagine trying to bring politics into this and knowing nothing about politics
---
hey man can i get a beta invite uwu
---
I understand your point. That’s why I have to stop. I did not know they support totalitarianism before, but I stop paying them immediately after they express their stance.
---
I’m an OW player and. WoW player but I think I’m done. I’m not gonna support evil. I do enough of that through my taxes.
---
So you think that casters interviewing a chinese streamer in china who says "I don't like donald trump" should lose their jobs? Wtf lol
---
Well, according to the chinese publisher for hearthstone at least, china has the biggest playerbase for hearthstone. How true that is is hard to tell, because I haven't been able to find exact numbers. But it's something to consider for this argument.
---
"McCarthyism is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence.". Im not even defending Blizzard, in fact ive said many tiems that Blizz is in the wrong but people are 100% gonna accuse streamers of being "pro China" even though they dont express an opinion and therefore have no evidence. And if you say that silence is somehow a form of evidence theres a reasont he 5th amendment exist.
---
Omg I’m so out of the loop. CoD is now Blizzard owned??
---
i dont think they have more.
---
but the ccp can just out right ban blizzard from china's internet, which is something our democracies wouldnt do.
---
The people will decide if they still want to buy packs.
---
lets hope they choose wisely.
---
This kind of response is not helpful.
---
This isn't a case of "us vs. them". The Chinese people are the ones who are worst affected by their government's authoritarian disregard for human rights.
---
Don't hate on the people of China. Direct your hate at the people who deserve it: Xinnie the Pooh, the CCP, and companies, like Blizzard, who are supporting them.
---
10k HKD for 5 years isn’t too much.
---
Would love kibler to come back to magic tbf
---
also fired the casters
---
social and economical backlash are still too real
---
i wonder if you would feel safe if the POTUS threatened you on twitter
---
That's where you draw the line, but comparing them to the traitorous Confederacy is just "unappreciated facts"?
---
and why should i give a shit?
---
TBH, it would be hard to replicate the success of Hearthstone as they have an extremely epic story behind (the World of Warcraft). But I guess it would be more important for us HKer to fight for democracy and human rights than making a new game at the moment. Please stand by us and we are determined!
---
And this my friend is the perfect example of why you don't do business with China. Because doing business with them means bending the knee to their politic.
---
In short, Blizzard banned a player from Hong Kong who said he supports protests against China in an interview. Both casters were fired too.
---
In conflicts like this there are always 2 sides, and as someone watching from outside you usually can trust neither side to report objectively about what really happens.
---
That said, although I have no idea what really is going on it sure looks like the protests are well justified. China doesn't get a lot of good PR about this where I live lol
---
Welcome to Shadowverse!
---
maybe
---
but again wasnt this blizzard china and not the blizzard we know in Irvine?
---
Wtf
---
You could die a hero or live long enough to be the villain.
---
It’s actually Tencent’s stance tbh. Which is China.
---
Right sorry, I forgot about the whole "being owned and having almost no rights part". I forgot about the "killing you is barely a crime part"
---
I'll never play Destiny 2 on battle.net again.
---
Don't tell him what to do
---
I'd argue that supporting people fighting for their rights has nothing to do with politics. It's basic human decency to support the people of Hong Kong and wish them the best of luck. Anyone not doing that is a vile human being. I'm surprised only one HS player came out in support, it should've been every single player in this damn tournament.
---
Why are any of you still playing Blizzard games after this?
---
The internet has only been around in earnest for 20 years, tops. You really aren't comprehending how quickly tiny inconsequential news can spread now.
---
Why should I bother buying any game from Blizzard if they're going to suspend my account like that?
---
So a bracket would be super nice like any other sporting event. I’m pretty sure it’s a lot like football in which spot one and two have a bye week the first week so they don’t have to play.  They automatically make it to round two.  Then it follows old conquest rules with the new protect rules. So you need to win with all three decks not just two. I also heard that number four gets an automatic loss when they play but I don’t know when that comes into effect.
---
They'd be counterfeit coins
---
It's pretty fun mostly imo. Been playing for over 3 years.
---
They won't let me delete my account. To many tries entering my Auth cod, after 1 try.
---
[Here's a good visual summary](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-arc.html) which will bring you up to date, at least to oct 1 (a 14 year old was shot by an off-duty police since then, and the city's transit has been shut down after questionable vandalism)
---
Same here. I am a legend Player since 2014 and I will not play any game from blizzard-activision anymore from now on.
---
 &gt; I already acknowledged one is worse than the other
---
Did you though?

---
you quitting hearthstone on't make blizzard go back on what they did.
---
Let's all now to China. He won and now they don't have to pay him because he China says so? That's so fucked.
---
Stay classy Blizzard.
---
Is patriotism actually good though? I'm legitimately asking, but it seems when you boil it down, it's still taking pride in what makes you different, based on mostly arbitrary borders. I feel like more often than not, it ends up leading to xenophobia and more towards some form of nationalism.
---
I believe that's correct. The winner of each match moves onto the next, then the two final winners play off to win the regional bracket.
---
Just deleted my Blizzard Everthing.   Done with Blizzard.
---
Another company turning it's back on democracy.
---
You are right. My statements are wrong. They are not quitting the game to show how woke they are, people are not doing that at all. They are just posting on reddit to be outraged, feel good about themselves and get the feeling that they are part of a movement (even though quitting a virtual card game doesn't help or do a single positive thing for the people of HK) and farm some karma.
---
Same, I was about to get Diablo 3 for PC
---
Ironically, "PROTECT THE PRIDE OF THE COUNTRY " sounds eerily political.
---
Ah but what if the tyrants pay you money and your company doesn't give a shit about anything else?
---
&gt; I feel personally attacked.
---
LOL...of all the slacktivism comments I've read this morning on HS sub, yours is easily the one I laughed the loudest at. Thanks for that.
---
It's easy to say when it isn't your career on the line though.
---
So... I guess you didn't bat an eye when they started doing it for the farleft, SJW, LGBTLMNOQ+ and feminist political correctness?
---
No, the person I responded to equated them.
---
I genuinely support LGBT and have a few close gay friends. My implication was that Blizzard's act of caring for LGBT was all bullshit and they just wanted more profit.
---
Someone do the cosplay event and make a really good one to go on center stage then push a button that transforms you into a Support HK beacon.
---
Time to move on [gu.cards/play](https://gu.cards/play)

Blizzard: "Don't you guys have communism?"
---
It is kinda sad though. i haven't been playing recently anyway so I can't quit again, but it is sad knowing pretty much every company will sell out if they know it more profitable to do so.
---
But then again, no company would survive if it constantly made deicsions that are unprofitable for it to make, so its expected. Even if you stopped playing blizzard games and played elsewhere, Chinese probably have significant investment anyways so its not really making a difference. I'm sure conservative billionaires invest in companies that are pro LGBT, so even if you judge a company by its messages the end result may be the same.
---
That said, if you make it more profitable for companies to be more ethical, then they will be more ethical, so theres that at least.
---
Uninstalled, what you are doing seems small but giving up on something you care about deeply to support what is right takes a strong soul  
---
Cowards. Seriously fuck China
---
I didn't think they could stoop this low. I've kept a WoW subscription alive without playing for YEARS just to support this company. They will not see another dollar from me. Everything cancelled, everything deleted. There is a line for everyone and the line for me is supporting regimes that harvest human organs. All the talk about Trump this, Hitler that is great and really makes you feel good like you changed the world or something. But China is the actual Nazis 2.0, returned and improved, and not a snowflake anywhere has a thing to say about it. May y'all rest in the blood soaked bed of chinese money you made for yourselves.
---
You might as well say Blizzard is a Chinese company now funded by US dollars. Chinese censor on the board of directors.
---
You shoukd fuck off with your mainland propaganda.
---
See, normally I would agree with you but in this particular case I'm not so sure boycotting is the best move. 
---
The reason Blizzard is pandering so much to the Chinese government is because they to be part of the giant Chinese market.
---
 If a bunch of Americans start boycotting Blizzard and they lose their foothold in the American market, they're only going to pander even harder to the chinese government because the chinese market is all they have left.
---
Last year I was on the fence about buying a virtual ticket for this year. Then a lot of progress had happened throughout the year for hearthstone, one of, if not, my favorite game on bnet, and i started to turn back towards the idea. Last week put me on the rocks and this now seals the deal. Blizzard you will not be getting my money and you are literally a minor transgression away from me deleting everything blizzard off my system.
---
While I can only speak for myself I would urge others, as we have had memes of in the past, hit them where it hurts. If you are on the fence of buying a ticket, DON'T. If you have bought one see about a refund. This practice is egregious and should be treated as such.
---
There isn't a difference. You are choosing to use a product and are therefore condoning their actions and supporting them. You are in obvious, full, and outright support of the Chinese government as laid out by your logic above. 
---
The availability of acceptable alternates shouldn't have any impact on your decision. Either supporting something makes you complicit or it doesn't. You have decided to say it does but are trying to weasel out of it because it makes you feel uncomfortable.
---
Republic of China should kick them out for openly supporting the occupying force on their lands.
---
League will be more mechanically similar due to being an isometric clicker.
---
Both communities can be bad for new players, although I think Riot works harder to trim the toxicity than HiRez/Titanforge.
---
There are a lot of heroes that don't have similar Champions/Gods, though.
---
I definitely agree about that, but that's a poor fix because it's not possible to change the democracy out there (that would be an invasion)
---
But blizzard isn't bound by China law.

That's what they're trying to do. Corporations can last generations and influence, change and distort the conditions for everyone. These corporations won't stop until the consumers, and workers, are at the will of their whims. They're conditioning every generation to get the unquestioning slaves that they want...
---
And it's working.
---
but you trust Google and Facebook.
---
why government (for which you personally are worthless) is worse than corporations, who treat you as a money-giving-consumer?
---
I think it's time to chant Free Hong Kong through the entirety of their Blizzcon presentation so they cant announce a damn thing in any of their streams.
---
Everyone going in agreement?
---
It is just a moment of courage. All you need is the will to press a button and you can be free. You will be surprised how fast you forget a game once you decided to do so. It took me 1-2 weeks to get over dota and now I rarely care about it.
---
In the end, it is mere entertainment. You are the one in control. Don't let them control you.
---
Lol, that wasn't nationalism. WW2 was about imperialism. Nationalism wouldn't go outside of their country its borders.
---
Also taking a month break can help refresh the game to you, I did that and now I’m still having lots of fun with it
---
I mean yes, it's a shit thing and the overall situation over there is absolute chaos and those protests SHOULD be supported. But somehow the people in this sub have a twisted view that they will be heard if they stop playing blizzard games.
---
I have no idea either. It's just your typical "blizzard did something controversial so now everyone is gonna post how they stop playing" period we get every couple of months.
---
Don't worry, it'll all be forgotten when those people come back for the next expansion in December. Just like it's always have been for as long as this game existed.
---
“Just like the 37 other times you guys quit” I haven’t touched hearthstone in probably a year now. It is possible to quit. This is at least a better reason than that of blizzard cutting hgc
---
They don’t care about anything as long as they still can make $$$ in china.
---
It's not about politics. It's about that sweet Chinese RMB. If a player from Catalonia had called for independence from Spain, they would not have gotten the same heavy handed reaction from Blizzard.
---
I am extremely disappointed in Blizzard for doing this. I will never support any of their games from now on.
---
I feel sorry for Blitzchung and the two casters and I hope that they land on their feet ASAP.
---
The two casters as well.
---
you're right. Harassing chinese streamers because of the incident unrelated to them is unacceptable, though I doubt anyone would do that.
---
They first came for the tits.
---
Then they came for the people of Hong Kong.
---
Then they'll come for you.
---
I'm in the same boat. Played since closed Beta, a few top 16 Legend seasons. I kept finding myself coming back, but with Magic Arena being a MUCH better game right now and not as openly shit of a company, I think I'm done with Blizzard.
---
Finally going to uninstall that launcher, best of luck to those who are okay to sweep this under the rug.
---
Right well it sounds like the 'value' of his relationship with Blizzard is pretty rapidly going downhill. If as many people as are implied here take offense to what Blizzard is doing and tell all of their friends about it, that may affect their bottom line. Probably not as much as severing ties with China - but then Blizzard has already chosen to side with authoritarianism.
---
Fuck Hearthstone.  Cya Blizz. Youve become utterly souless

Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
Didn't know the government in China was a group of public people. Didn't know standing up for what's right brings you to disrepute.  Remember what Blizzard thinks of you if you think of these things.
---
What about the free market? Isnt a major part of capitalism 'if a company does something shitty then people will stop' but youre literally saying the opposite is the case in real life so weird how thats the case and why companies need to be kept in check
---
Done. Account deletion request sent.
---
Well now I'm deleting everything blizzard from my system,. I can't support a company that licks the boots of a genocidal government
---
Blizzard = executives that want more money doesnt matter how. That is the reality...
---
Or "MAGA!" and "Make America Great Again!". 
---
When those old conservatives complained about restrictions and censorship on freedom of speech you touted the age old fallacy that as long as it was for "side of the fence" you didn't care. To China ironically this is their form of hate speech that, on our side of the fence sounds insane. (Similar to how Saudis and Muslim religious see other speech the west may say isn't right as hate speech)  
---
Blizzard doesn't want their bloodline banned from China, and black listed for all of history. Every developer in China doesn't want to be fired; and their very livelihoods are at stake. Their kids welfare, their homes... everything. 
---
When they published lists of conservatives to blacklist them from everywhere and riot their storefronts until they went into hiding, that was a step to this. Protect your damn first amendment, or one day you'll be in that pickle. Standing up for what you believe, or getting your entire life destroyed.
---
If Blizzard really makes a large loss from this, I can see the big Blizzard shareholders ordering a hit on Blitzchung.
---
This is just beyond the pale.  There's no other good, civil way to put Blizzard's response to China's pressure than to call it what it is: bullshit.
---
Absolutely disgraceful decision by greedy people protected by the same prerogatives of freedom they aren't recognizing to Hongkongers.
---
Not to mention [Tiffany &amp; Co. deleting a tweet cause mainlanders saw it as support for HK](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1484988-20191008.htm), [Vans removing a shoe design from a competition for referencing HK](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-vans/shoemaker-vans-treads-warily-as-china-fumes-over-hong-kong-idUKKBN1WN0IZ), and [Apple removing the Taiwan flag emoji in HK and Macau](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903613/apple-hiding-taiwan-flag-emoji-hong-kong-macau-china)
---
Justice is a strong word. You make it sound like there is any benefit for them to not do what they did. 
---
And thats the actual problem. We arent going to spend more money if they say shit like "good on you, blitzchung, fuck china". Its not nett beneficial to any company, even before considering chinese backlash.
---
So why would they do anything like that that when its nett negative...?
---
The problem is that both only look at it black and white. The workers travelling through countryside in China or Bangladeshi ship wreckers are technically no slaves, however the living conditions are so horrible that almost everyone in the western world would immediately take up a position in a roman civil servant household where you have no rights, but still live a comfy life.
---
Slave labors can have just as much of a shitty life as actual slaves per definition.
---
Yeah got bored and quit a couple expansions ago. How and why did Hearthstone get so boring
---
The first episode of the season is about the detention camps
---
Blizz has been catering to china since forever.. people are surprised and believe them quiting will impact anything. Money talks and your f2p account wont matter towards the HUGE china market blizzard wants to keep. 
---
Downvote away but this has been happening forever and NOW its an issue for you..
---
Libertarians like to pretend that losing 1 million consumers out of 30 million will cause any meaningful harm to a company with 29 million consumers. 
---
They treat companies as amoral because it makes their argument easier, not because they actually believe it. They're just people who want rich people to have more freedom because they dream that one day "when" they're rich they'll have more freedom because of their actions. Lunatics.
---
Inclusive patriotism is pride in your country, what it has accomplished, and what it can show others. It is not the exclusiveness of saying your country is better than others, that it is the only country that knows what it is doing, that everyone else is dirty and should stay away.
---
It is semantics and the terms are frequently conflated.
---
Yesterday i legit was about to buy battle for azeroth and the sub for wow...guess i wont
---
Yeah that guy was u/mtgcardfetcher [[totally lost]]
---
Yeah communism is an idea and obviously it's never existed in any real sense for any meaningful amount of time.
---
And of course the Soviets never gave power to the people because they got all the power and thus didn't have to. How would socialism exist without a government though? Who would enforce it on bad actors and class enemies? Wouldnt that be anarchy?
---
While I don't agree with how China is handling Hong Kong, I would argue that Blitzchung's comments were out of place and highly inappropriate given the apolitical nature of the event. He knew what he was doing and deserves to be punished accordingly.
---
OK, so they got fired simply because they were on the screen with the Blitzchung?
---
How could they possibly know what Blitzchung was going to say on a live stream? O\_o
---
It's shortsighted and a gross overreaction.
---
I agree that any choice Blizzard makes would hurt their profits, it's pretty obvious Blizzard chose the bigger market, I think people just don't realize that Blizzard has always been a company, company always chase after the profits. The difference between now and 10 years ago was Blizzard was smaller and times were smaller back then.

I dont want to argue, but I would say the issues he brought up are more important than the "Halloween event", but you are entitled to your opinion, and I wasnt a big fan of him overall either.
---
Was feeling a little burnt out on HS anyway. Played since Naxx and have played daily since BdP. I get that publicly traded companies have to do the rational, profitable thing, but clamping down on political protests like this? A warning about not protesting at official events would have still been gross but this is too much.

Even standard player won't be missed!

I mean I guess, but voting with your dollar can't do all that much. You'd be hard pressed to find any company that even pretends to care. Not defending Blizzard, just saying there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
---
I'm French-Canadian, not a chinese shill. Lived in pretty much every continent (except australia and antartica), and more recently studied in china for a semester. I have no affilations whatsoever to china. I even said I wouldn't like to make my life there, because in the end it is still an authoritarian country where ultimately if the state decides so, you have no rights.
---
The old ManBearPig episode had nothing to do with saying climate change wasn't a real thing - they were making fun of Al Gore being a clumsy, completely uncharismatic panic-merchant. They still made fun of him for it in both the 2014 and 2017 video games they released, and their "reversal" in the animated show wasn't a reversal at all, as they've never expressed an actual clear, one-or-the-other opinion on actual real climate change in the show, ever. The entire concept of "ManBearPig" simply existed to make fun of Al Gore's personality and career, and that's it.
---
It's standard SP/Matt and Trey, they make fun of personalities more than anything else.
---
Denied him his winnings also
---
Actually any publicity is good publicity - they might lose some players but I bet they gain a ton more than they lose over this.
---
Uninstalling and ending support for any Blizzard-Activision product is the least I could do... Free HK!
---
They gather data from players so simply having the client running is giving them more data and more money. Uninstall and just let the company die. 
---
They haven't been the same company since WoW got big so just let them go. Other companies are making good games so it's not really a loss.
---
First South park, then NBA, now Blizzard
---
I wonder if science has a name for this phenomenom, i saw it several times in the NBA subreddit too. For whatever reason people assume these celebs (relative to their scene) would take public stances aligning to their own.
---
My comment is in no way to be meant against yours, but this (just like the Rockets thought Harden would side with Mory or several fans thought coaches like Pop and Kerr would speak up) seems like a displacement of action that leads to stagnation. There must be a study for this out there.
---
Does it? The backlash from the US market can be huge, an average consumer pays a lot more than an average one anywhere else.

What about single player?

ive played hearthstone since GVG release, and spent money on many expansions until they bumped prices up and released more frewuently. im ready to walk away from blizzard after this. its disgusting that they  are aligning with a corrupt, communist regime that has no qualm with massacres like Tiananmen Square. Boycott Blizzard.
---
They've banned people for less, honestly. If you change your name to "DreamKazper", a known former Overwatch League player accused of pedophilic behavior, your account gets suspended and you have to change your name.
---
THE MOMENT THEY RELEASE A MOBILE VERSION IM THERE.
---
Stop promoting shit you dont understand
---
The natural corollary of this is that it is then up to consumers to reject companies that do not align with their values.
---
Never gonna buy a reddit pack again

Time is money too. I will no longer touch this or other Blizzard games. I’m done. I can’t condone such cowardice and disgusting capitulation to outright evil.

Fuck China!
---
They won't receive a competitive ban if they organize as, say, half the players of any one region, and do nothing but openly show support for Blitzchung and request Blizzard to undo his kick and ban. Just imagine Blizzard actually banning them for that. That would be taking the PR nightmare this already is to another level.
---
Already if one or two of the community favorites criticise Blizzard this would be a disaster for them that just gets worse if they resort to punishments. Blizzard banning Firebat, RDU or Thijs for standing up for a fellow player? Not gonna happen, because EU and US are *also* important to them.
---
Fuck blizzard.
---
&gt;For all the coverage it was receiving on Western streams, it was completely absent on the Eastern ones.
---
The next sentence....
---
You mean have millions in the bank account and somehow have the willpower to turn down a few more millions? Oh, how could I possibly do that? Hoarding unimaginable amounts of wealth is the only purpose in life after all
---
Watching how all these developed, is just sad. In the end, Blitzchung (and the casters) are left by themselves. Us, the fans, might have supported him. But their peers, other professional players and casters will not lend their support, at least openly. Which I suspect because it will hurt their income. Money is a really strong element.
---
This is scary and depressing how strong China's influence is.
---
[Meanwhile](http://prntscr.com/pggo40) I've been trying to make blizzard delete all my account data because I refuse to support anything from them anymore, but they conveniently locked the SMS verification. Yeah they just want a copy of my ID with photo and all now to verify it with. Trying to livechat with support also tells me to do so and that they weren't "able" to do it otherwise.
---
The entire company is filled with scum.
---
Actually they can. Quite easily. But I’m will to do this.
---
The madlad
---
Deleted
---
Pfft not even top 10.. won’t be missed
---
I understand there is a certain neutral stance a major corporation needs to make and the very reality of where the money is.
---
But the level of punishment not only toward blitzchung but towards the casters is no longer about enforcing neutrality, but a clear 'we want them RMB' signal.
---
Same. It's one thing to be unsatisfied with the direction Blizzard games in general have been going lately, but this? I haven't played Hearthstone in years, just heard about this news. I'm never giving Blizzard another cent, this is disgusting.
---
I’m rank 5btw :D

The Cambridge English Dictionary would disagree with your argument as to what dictionaries say communism means. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/communism It’s not the 50s gramps. Things can be bad and also not be communism. You describe a communist “government dividing people into classes” everything about that sentence is not communism, because a commune with no private property has to be a classless society. The Soviet Union was not a communist society and neither is the PRC, both are examples of hypocrisy. Just like religion doesn’t explicitly mean child abuse and family values conservative doesn’t literally mean having anonymous gay sex in airport bathrooms. Words have definitions.
---
Yup, if the Chinese Communist Party decides they’re mildly offended by a Winnie the Pooh sticker on someone’s mouse, they flip a switch on the wall and the entire country is closed off from all Blizzard titles.  
---
But if Blizzard wraps a protester in a Confederate flag and feeds her to a lion, they only have to weather a couple weeks of people posting “I’m boycotting Blizzard” on social media. But the actual loss in the Western market would be some fraction of a percent that they’ve pretty accurately predicted ahead of time.
---
lol fuck China
---
Why don't you look into the language my name is in. I think I understand what totalitarian dictatorships can do pretty damn well, and I refuse to support any company who will fuck over their customers to appease countries like China.
---
Same I quit with you. This is too much.
---
You have been banned from ~~/r/Pyongyang~~ /r/SantaMonica
---
“They know it”? Just like they knew everyone would be super psyched about diablo on their phones? Lol blizz has made plenty of mistakes
---
Yeah? AnCom makes the most sense to me. But Zizek is right we need some new ideas
---
true, could learn to feed yourself though.
---
Actually its set to private, I cant access the subreddit too.
---
You werent banned on that subreddit, they did set to private subreddit intentionally
---
Tencent owns 5% of Activision Blizzard which I guess is enough for them to hold some sway.
---
Horrifying!
---
So then you wouldn't care as much if it weren't about China?
---
I am a huge MTG fan and joined this subreddit before investing heavily into hearthstone. Fuck blizzard they will.never get a penny from me again
---
So why is there constant support for hong kong posts all over the front page if reddit is controlled by china?
---
Let’s bring this to the attention of media outlets, they will love to publish this story to the masses.
---
I was gonna order the new evil and hero bundles but fuck it,say goodbye to any more money from me blizz
---
Mad props to Blitzchung for being willing to make a stand even when cost him. As for Blizzard, damn, you all scummy as eff, way to really show your TRUE colors.
---
Basic human rights, huh? Freedom of speech, etc?
---
That player decided to come out and say something about politics, clearly violating Blizzard rules. If you cross the road in inappropriate place, you'll get a bill. If you steal, you'll go to jail. You sign a contract and then ignore it - where it will take you? 
---
Rules are rules, laws are laws. Every action has it's consequences. Every crime need punishment. Of course, same is true for Chinese government.
---
It's your choice to boycott. Blizzard didn't support Chinese government. Blizzard tried to show it's neutrality. What happens in a country doesn't involve corporation. That player made Blizzard to get in uncomfortable position, where it had to take unpopular decision. 
---
Now, tell us, what should Blizzard do as an international company? Ignore his statement, which could made people think "oh yes, they support riots in a particular country"? If you think this example is hypocritical, there is "light" version: "oh yes, Blizzard events are nice platforms for political messages. I should use it too". One rule violation will lead to next one if ignored. Chinese anti-government statement, Russian anti-government statement, American anti-government statement... and Blizzard are in shit.
---
How do I donate to blitzchung?
---
"Mind if I roll GREED?"
---
Yep, it's written in simplified chinese, Taiwanese use traditional chinese.
---
What a coincidence that Tencent have a stake in reddit
---
The Diablo:Immortal fiasco was just a bad attempt at trying to switch over the clientele onto a mobile platform that boils down to bad decision making behind the scenes.  
---
The situation at hand that we have here is a corporation's public attempt to intimidate the gamer population via use of fear(we'll punish you if you don't behave how we want you to!) into not standing up for freedom.  This is disgusting.    
---
But yeah, I think activision/blizzard have no idea what they are doing.  It's like they are so out of touch with humanity and what consumers want it's sad.  The worst part though is that they give the video game industry a bad rap as a whole.  It's a shame.  I hope they pull out of the industry entirely.
---
"everyone I disagree with is a shill"
---
As someone from Hong Kong, it is very heartwarming to see all the support here. 
---
It is very much appreciated and it is good to see people standing up to China’s bullying
---
Fair enough. I liked the idea that no one would listen to him.
---
Blizz makes money off the people playing their game. This is no esports revenue if there is no esports players. Don't act like they are benevolent gods by making a tournament available. If you are making money off of people's gameplay AND their personality, you can't also act like it's your policy to strip aspects of who they are--their personal opinions. It's a two way street. #boycottblizz

Yeah. FWIW I really enjoyed artifact. The problem I had with it was that the games really felt like a slog to me. Not in a negative sense, more that I would want a break after playing a game. Much more so than dota even though those games would go longer. I do miss playing phantom draft, the main problem now is that the people still playing it are way better than me.
---
If magic had the same player population and demographic as hearthstone does, do you really think Wizards of the Coast would make different decisions than Blizzard?
---
Its nice to support something like HK freedom but it needs to stay where it should.
---
Blizzard is gaming company, not political forum where you express your stance.
---
Most of the big companies are partly owned by china or they work with china companies to sell their games in China. Every single company would react the same way. They just want to abide laws and regulations and they want to sell their product. They don't want to get involved in politics.
---
I don't understand what is so hard to understand about it. Blizzard is just unlucky it happened to them first.
---
so they shit on our lovely card arts first and now fire and ban people for this? i guess it's time i stop playing any fucking blizzard games (wich i love and do play all the time)
---
You can't assume that how they reacted to something in 2014 is going to be the same way they'd react today. Again, 2014 was a much different time compared to now.
---
I'm not saying they are censoring EVERY anti-china post.  But the censorship is happening, and it is growing.
---
I've been considering quitting for good, but this is the final nail in the coffin. I am a whale, I have no illusions about that. Every expac since gadgetzan I've bought the highest price tier as well as the secondary tier. I have every adventure all the way back to Naxx. But all I've spent and achieved means nothing to me if it's been funneled into a company that values profit over human lives.
---
Damn that’s dedication. I could never do that. Not after giving them thousands and thousands of dollars.
---
Respecting the disrespectful shows them people will continue to grovel at their feet regardless of their actions.
---
Respect is earned, not demanded in a set of rules written by a 15 year old online.
---
It absolutely is. Still needs work, but the game itself MtG is awesome
---
Let's be real, blizzard wouldn't go bankrupt after losing China.
---
It's greed not obligation that made the decision here.
---
Blizzard's games could get censored in china for no reason (picturing squelettons, LGBT protagonist, blood, Orange teddy bear), so doubling down on that market isn't the safest.
---
I'd rather not be mana-hosed when playing a card game, but thanks for reminding about the TCG I quit 17 years ago.
---
Wtf blizzard......
---
Tbh, for me it was easier than I thought it would be. I had already been on a decline when I made the call earlier this year following the news of "Yay! Most profitable year to date! Clearly this means we need to lay people off so we'll make even more next year!"
---
There are a lot of other options to play instead.
---
China's market is larger than the USA. And in reality, backlash will not be nearly as large as this sub makes it seem. If T5 adresses the game's issues, it should recover.
---
They are forcing the world to bow them because they have the market size. Do you mean that realistically companies can make no choice but to support a country who steals organs and builds concentration camps?
---
yeah and boring too
---
Excuse me, I'm retarded.
---
thanks for the heads up. refunded mine back to my card without issue.

"The only country"? Well yes, when people protest against police brutality in Russia, they get jailed.

Tgis is literally the healthiest way to go about this. Good on you im doing the same.
---
Looks like I won't be buying into WoW Classic after FFXIV's next content patch after all.
---
Scummy company, wished Actigarbage gad never turned Bluzzard into another EA.
---
Nothing, because he is the one investigating it. You can say “how is that fair” well then even if it was anyone else, who the hell is going to investigate the investigator?
---
Have you noticed that not a single post has been removed since this shitshow started? The mods are letting the subreddit get made unusable because if they don't fuckers like you will accuse them of being shills.
---
Start with something where if you pay 80 bucks you still dont get the full game
---
Nope.  
---
It's easier to ignore if it's a bunch of comments in a thread. If the number of threads you have to scroll past is an inconvenience to you, your perspective is horrifically out of wack.
---
I just did the same with HS and all other Blizzard games. My message when canceling my WoW subscription was:
---
Blizzard has made a mistake by aligning with an authoritative regime instead of supporting the players who play their games. Blizzard's response to the Hong Kong issues, and the silencing of the fundamental freedom of speech of a human being has given me no choice but to discontinue monetary support. I have spent hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on Blizzard games and items, and it stops now. Furthermore, I will speak with other video game players and encourage them to do the same. Shame.
---
Ticket a complaint about player harassment and in player name put blizzard activision lmao
---
A warning would be generous. They knowingly used an opportunity provided by the event hosts to forcibly insert the event hosts into a politically volatile situation, in direct violation of the competition rules I'm sure they had to agree to in order to participate.
---
If it was a casual comment about supporting Hong Kong's freedoms in the course of a conversation or an interview, then a warning might be more appropriate. This was a tournament contestant wearing protester gear shouting the de facto slogan of the protests into the mic of a widely broadcast tournament meant to incite. It was intentional, not a slip of the tongue.
---
facts
---
This isn't a human rights subreddit, it's a card game subreddit. Why are you just deciding this is an activist sub now? Why weren't you posting about human rights violations the past six years this sub was active?
---
Let me answer for you - you're a virtue signaling fuckstick who is pretending to have an impact on the world by posting comments on the internet
---
Firing Kibler is tricky because he has a massive platform and friend network who would work to undermine you.
---
Probably would have the most blowback of any caster.
---
I hope the day comes when somebody tells you that your struggle has no place in their activities.
---
Oh is your family getting shot in the streets? Being beaten and out in concentration camps?
---
Oh well please don't talk about it too loudly.
---
nah tbh
---
MTG has a partnership with Tencent so respectfully you are extremely naive if you don’t think MTG are bowing down to the profits as well.
---
Didn't they break a rule though?
---
Ching Ching Wing Wong muther fucka FREE HONG KONG!
---
Agreed. The people losing their minds are totally missing the point. T
---
here is a time and a place for everything and politics doesn't belong at a gaming event. Especially when it's something so controversial that it would piss of different sides.
---
I 100% Agree with Blizzard decision. Don't drag politics into stuff it doesn't belong.
---
If a company ever seems progressive, it's almost always a calculated marketing ploy. If being anti-LGBT made more money that would be their stance.
---
Simple math, friends. 
---
USA - Market of 350 million or so
---
China - Market of 1.5 Billion or so
---
You're about 20% as valuable to them as China. Expect to be treated like it.
---
The point is that blizz would ban anyone that made a political speech during their tournament stream.
---
I mean that is the only part of his statement that wasn't a lie. FREE HONG KONG
---
Unfortunately the newest entry in the digital series isn't super but the older ones are great!

Rest assured, blizzard isn't going to ignore this even if you do follow the rules
---
They lost the future 10k, 100k, and other player's donate after this post.
---
No honor.
---
Well Firebat already said several times now during his stream ( since ppl always asked him..) he/they will adress it on Omnistone, not during a normal Hearthstone stream.
---
Weird wording i thought the same. He is saying he is playing since naxx. But he is leaving today.
---
Oh, I was also a stock holder in ATVI - sold that shit today too.

Adios Blizzard

Lmao dude this has actually nothing to do with communism. Read a book.

They rightfully do not say where their loyalties lie in the Hong Kong issue, which is absolutely the wisest thing to do for a company on the stock market. You think Blizzard is an SJW charity? You fool.

If I get a refund for Warcraft reforged will I get it in blizzard store cash or will I get it back on my card?
---
&gt; People who disagree with this kind of virtue signaling when discussed at some larger sub are frequently assumed to be some kind of bigoted evil right wingers and then jumped upon.
---
its a reflex. on leftist subs I can be fairly confident in knowing that someone criticizing a company for virtue signalling isn't doing it because they hate the virtue being signalled. on a big gamer subreddit, instinct kicks in and when I see someone decry e.g blizzard for pushing pride you have to try and play the game of "are they against it because they're against corporate pinkwashing or genuinely homophobic?" and *usually* its safer to lean to the latter.
---
I’m Chinese, so no need to guess which side I’m on. Just pointing out the hypocrisy here
---
Then at least wear a HK shirt or bring a flag to whip out in the audience.
---
That's a great vision of patriotism that is shared by the upper 0.1% of the intellectual elite. For most common countrymen, patriotism is about punching shitters in the face cuz they don't respect your grandfathers and their sacrifice.

Not a joke, lmk how this goes because I’d love to get my account refunded too.
---
As someone who grew up on Blizzard games, this is such a goddamn blow to me. The companies been degrading fast ever since after Overwatch and Hearthstone peaked (you could even argue since Activision took over) but this is absolutely lower than I ever would have believed they would go years ago. Seeing a company like Activision Blizzard capitulate to Chinese censorship ( and the human right violations they’re attempting to cover up) is sickening and I will never buy a game a product from either Activision Blizzard or Activision again as a result. Fight against censorship and fight for a free Taiwan.
---
Oh this can be a god-level trolling print an a tshirt for Blizzcon
---
Basically this comes down to fuck Blizzard. I"m curious how the old blizzard would have responded to this, and I'm somewhat happy we don't know because now I get to talk about how much worse they are since the Activision merger without hurting my nostalgia, but I'm not giving Blizz any more of my money. Ever.
---
If Nazi Germany was writing their paychecks they would lol. Diablo Immortal only appeals to one market
---
DO NOT let any of these be swept under the rug. Both Blizzards and NBA. This doesn’t just concern Hong Kong anymore. These are American(I think) companies that have been basically bought out and succumbed to the CCP.  The point is, “this is a matter within China, it doesn’t concern us” isn’t a valid statement anymore. CCP censorship isn’t on the other side of the world anymore. Heck, it isn’t even creeping on your doorstep. It’s already inside your house.

going f2p is just as good for them as being a paying player: they NEED a large body of f2p players for whales to play against. By denying them an active player, you raise queue times, lower consumer engagement metrics, and impact their sales projections. By continuing to play the game as f2p you are doing literally nothing to hurt the game at all.
---
Oooo the number of Uyghurs is up to 1.5 million, they must have a new source!
---
The previous claim of 1 million was Gay McDougall.
---
&gt;This is to say, one American member of an independent UN body made a provocative claim that China was interning 1 million Muslims, but failed to provide a single named source. And Reuters and the Western corporate media ran with it anyway, attributing the unsubstantiated allegations of one US individual to the UN as a whole.
---
I'll have to investigate the newly revised 1.5 million figure, but in the mean time I'll ask you a few things.
---
First of all, since when did the USA give a flying fuck about Muslims? Because in my lifetime that nation has killed an estimated 1.6 million in the middle east.
---
Extracting the Uyghur claim from that glish-gallop argument of a thread leaves us with little else of substance, but while we are at it, shall we compare that list [against atrocities of the US government?](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md)
---
Spoiler warning, the thread is *little* bit longer.
---
For any damned soul condemned to follow this stupid argument as a sort of penance, “an economic system based on public ownership of property and control of the methods of production, and in which no person profits from the work of others” is the first definition on that page. ya doof. Your argument that I was incorrectly defining the word is incorrect. Marxism is not the same thing as Communism, it is a philosophy about the organization of society, so of course it discusses class, it was very popular among socialists. Marxism-Leninism is a theory of how revolution can transform society to the communist ideal, it was the philosophy of the Soviet Union and Communist China. It calls for a strong central government to control the economy while the country is transformed to a place where communism can flourish. Unsurprisingly no one has every moved beyond that step, people are power hungry dicks and if it were even possible, communism isn’t really even that good an idea. Would you consider making an effort to educate yourself further on the topic before spouting off more on the internet? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism–Leninism

Casters: okok thats enough

I'll be honest and say I've been upset with the pro CCP actions some corporations have been taking but as a professional player, with a following I assume is compromised of mostly impressionable younger persons, you have to be really careful about how you talk about revolution..

Way to puss out blizzard. Glad I hardly play your games anymore if at all.

At the end of a Livestream he said, ‘Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!’

Lol Blizzard sucks fat dick and so do the mods of this sub.
---
Eat shit.
---
To be fair, nothing says "matter" like them shooting you out of a canon into the sun because you might cost them money.

Stuff like this isn't even about karma, it's about visibility of human rights denials and profit being placed before ethics. I don't care about karma, I care about showing a company the decisions they make will cost them my business.
---
Yeah a giant crowd interrupting the normal flow of the public. That's worked for Venezuela so well I guess China could do that as well for the same results.
---
Venezuelan btw.
---
You want a better protest? Get up in someone's face, bother them until they change things. Interrupt their favourite Card game tournament. Something like that maybe?
---
So I understand the business part of this but not from a moral part. What should have been done was nothing. This streamer would be fine, Blizzard would be fine, China would be fine, because he's one dude, just high up in the rankings. There are probably Chinese Legends up there, more than just this one Hong Kong dude. If nothing was said about this streamer nothing would have happened.
---
They don't, this guy's confused. The US has been allied with the Kurds for years, and until very recently (days ago) has provided them ground support in northern Syria - and the decision by the President to pull out has been deemed a mistake almost unilaterally by military officials and members of Congress.
---
LOL dumbass doesn’t even keep up with the news. 
---
You pretending what happened with blizzard “didn’t happen” doesn’t phase us, you limp edgy gutter fuck. You ignoring the news so you can be edgy means nothing to me. Because that’s what you are to everyone who gives a shit about the world: a nothing. And you’ll be reminded of that right as you put down your phone, and the next time you look in the mirror, in comparison to people who actually give a fuck about the world and where it’s going.
---
Good luck in life, nothing.

90% of them will be back in a week and the sub will be back like nothing ever happened.

this shit happens.

Thanks for all of the hard work!
---
&gt;For those of us not quitting Hearthstone today
---
Unfortunately the timing is of this post with everything else going on will mean less visibility. Sucks for such a big arena change.
---
It’s hypocritical to call out a totalitarian government who is abusing their citizens and lying to the world?
---
Just did! As a side note, if you sort Hearthstone reviews in the play store by most recent, it makes for some decent reading.
---
I mean, we do. We stand for letting people profit from the work of their hands without the government dictating everything. That is why the constitution restrains the government. It is the government that must be controlled. It is people with power that abuse it. Darn right America stands for profit.
---
Can you post a screenshot of their reason to censor?
---
Let's be fair, this rule is to cover their asses.
---
It would have been an american saying "I voted Hillary", that prize pool wouldn't have stayed in the big corporate pockets.
---
So Blizzard are anti democratic, pro dictatorship, pro censorship, chinese cock gobbling scum. I mean I knew they were greedy shits but this?
---
Boycotting all Blizzard products and you all should do the same. If Blizzard was it's to appease mass murdering totalitarian regimes, let them earn their money there.

magic does, but doesn't push it on its western audience. They do that thing that blizzard *used to do* that separated western and chinese art into two separate things. Getting chinese cards was weird sometimes because the art was different just a little on like, skeletons and really bloody stuff. Nothing to the degree that blizzard pulled.

u/scarletbliss this is related to hearthstone, so dont try banning it
---
Oddly enough there's plenty of old people in my country claiming soviets were a blessing and everything was better when they ruled.
---
The reality is that there are plenty of people with such mentality in China as well.
---
And to compare the regimes it can be even as simple as looking up the death tolls of each regime. Hitler's 10 million don't compare to Stalin's 20 or Mao's 60.
---
When it comes to the targets: communism targeted anyone who's independent and smart while natsoc tried to purge the weakest links and in the end specific minorities.
---
Damn, hitting me hard with that YouTube comment section psychotherapist wisdom. Funny what you "know" about me after a single reddit comment lmfao.

Overall assuming someone's political and moral view because of the games they play must be one of the stupidest things I've read here today.
---
I agree capitalism is super exploitable but we do need a system and I am personally of the belief that we should take victories where we can get them

Of course. But I rather have pro-democracy capitalism than anti-democracy capitalism, so I'm all for this.

r/LostReditors
---
I was started to get back into hearthstone a month or so ago but never had time to play it. Now i am done and just uninstalled. Not much but hopefully this uptick in uninstalls is something.
---
the rules were known, it was his choice to risk punishment by blizzard. Its fine if you voice your opinion in a space not designated for that but you cant put on the pikachu meme after feeling the consequences.
---
People have spent more money in less time and had less fun on worse hobbies, and not felt it was wasted. OP is fine
---
but the nationalistic crowd will always use it as an excuse to call you unpatriotic and try to punish you
---
Holy shit, u/Breatnach can single-handedly free the HK protesters? WHY DOESN'T HE ALREADY?!?!
---
I asked Pathra on stream, she said she has no idea.
---
It looked like the casters either knew what he would say or at least knew that it would be controversial. That's why they hid their faces after telling him to go ahead. They also referred to his 8 words before he said them, at least according to reddit threads. (I can't verify as I don't speak the language). That suggests they knew exactly what he would say and coordinated ahead of time. They got fired for tacitly supporting a player publicly airing a controversial opinion. I would almost certainly be fired from my job if I did something like that on company time and using company resources. 
---
That said, blizzard didn't need to fire them. It's a choice. They don't need to follow a rule book here, so they can't use that as an excuse. It's on them.
---
Nop it's not.
---
You really should reread my first post again.
---
BITES ZA DUSTO
---
I've religiously played hearthstone every day of my life since Ungoro released.
---
I will never touch the game again after this unless Blizzard does something drastic for damage control.
---
Not that it means much, but I uninstalled. I have an android app myself and I know for a fact they can see that statistic, even if it's not a vow to stop playing forever. Maybe some of you can join me.
---
can I have your stuff?
---
&gt; Modern China is akin to the German Nazi plague of the 30s and 40s.

They have been like this since the 1950s, I don't know why all the protest all of a sudden. It's been like this for generations.
---
Oh yes that Nike sponsorship right? And they were totally not supported by anyone in the league? 
---
They had their wages garnished too right?

Amazing that you are equivalating China’s free speech with American free speech and are unable to see the differences

Fuck blizzard. This is bullshit
---
Sure, why not, you think it matters to us more that they get more money than if they dont support authoritarian regimes? Really now.
---
Besides, dont a lot of chinese people use vpns, or whatever, already so that they can bipass the chinese firewall?
---
That's not what political means.
---
If people argued about whose anthem to play first before the games, that's political.
---
The anthems themselves are not political, but you probably don't want to care about the context except to push your narrative.
---
There is a more proper translation than 'pride of the country'. Possibly 'dignity' or 'honour' is better than 'pride' in this case. Note 国家尊严 (dignity of the country) is a very common phrase in China.
---
Use your brain to reply. GreatKKK is the opponent, not me.
---
And it will accomplish precisely nothing, as the Chinese backlash if Blizzard hadn't done this would have been far worse for their bottom line than anything Western fans will muster.
---
I give zero shots about Hearthstone, but this shirt makes me want to boycott Blizzard. It sickens me that we Americans seem to have sold out freedom.
---
Wait your name is GreatKKK ? uhhhh....
---
I doubt any american casting is going to speak put about this. They're all too afraid for something that goes against the company. Kibler will regularly shit on Trump but will clam up about this topic to keep his job. Blizzard is ok with political lashing at Trump, so hes not afraid of that.
---
Just unsubbed from wow and I'd encourage the rest of you to do the same. Don't give any more money to these cunts
---
What happened guys? Can someone explain please?
---
Blizzard banned a match-winning player out from the tournament because he supports Hong Kong during post-match interview, and all the moeny awards were expropriated. The reason behind was they want to make Hearthstone apolitical. 
---
But meanwhile, they support the totalitarian Chinese government on Weibo that [they support "One-China-Policy" on their platform.](https://na.cx/i/cEibtfy.png)  
---
[The tweet of Hearthstone actively supporting China](https://www.weibo.com/blizzard?is_hot=1#_loginLayer_1570543830550), and [Translation](https://imgur.com/rErS8Te).
---
Given the fighting for democracy and human right in Hong Kong, they suppressed us. Now, not only does China want to manipulate Hong Kong by their power, but they also started to utilize their market size to force foreign companies to kneel down to them (NBA, Disney, Blizzard, etc.), I hope western fellows can realize what they are planning and be cautious towards their totalitarianism.
---
I didn’t follow that but have been gradually trying to work their products out of my life. It sucks though, coffee crisps are really tasty
---
&gt; I'm surprised that for a foreign caster working in China

I'm in Taiwan, go cry about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZt6PF9PJ2I

Wow
---
China Numba 1
---
&gt; I doubt they would be banned
---
The Houston Rockets, a multi billion dollar company, just lost their entire Chinese market over a tweet.

Chinese customers care way more about this issue than Americans. Whatever boycott efforts American customers will make is going to pale compared to Chinese boycotts.
---
Have you tried MTG Arena?
---
Just come dressed as Winnie the Pooh in some Blizzard theme.

Winnie the Pooh Tracer
---
You should make a post about this on every r/ of blizzard's game
---
It would have been fair to ban a player, if they broke a no-politics rule. There wasn't a clear, excplicit no-politics rule, though, and removing the player in question from the league format, removing his prize money, banning him from competing temporarily and also banning the two casters permanently is excessive. I also doubt that they would have reacted similarly to most other political content.
---
And what is the deal with Blizzard about that?
---
Both anger me (China moreso by a lot)
---
They need to add an asterisk now lol
---
I am anyway
---
How would that even happen? He's at like 30% support? The only ones left are the idiots and the rich assholes who are using Trump as a useful idiot. All the "loyal" republicans are gone. They're done with the insanity.
---
It's as before the bucket system. Always offered 3 cards. It use to be each pack of 3 offered card from the same rarity. I believe this time they'll mix up the rarity in each 3 card pack.
---
Often they'll be 1 clear pick for quality, which I found dictated the type of curve I pushed for.
---
Yes, you're correct.  They believe in the power of consumerism and capitalism to force companies to make the correct moral decisions to protect their profits.  A now former friend is libertarian and I used to hear all about it at least once a week.

Well said. Its pretty clear that the Blizzard of old is dead and gone, for what its worth. You're not abandoning the company you loved as a kid, you're boycotting the bloated corpse it had become.
---
"FoR tHOsE OF yOu WhO ArE BoyCoTTinG  BlIZzARD bY USiNG thEiR ProDUcT"
---
Have my upvote.
---
Lmao I thought Blizzard was an American company, why are they bowing down to that clown of a government in China?
---
That's the opponent, not me. Brain is precious bro.
---
Most likely the second and also one of those Trump haters because the front page has the word Trump in like at least 6 of the titles
---
It's disgraceful how much we're seeing the world curtail to China despite the atrocities they're committing
---
Also if you then take a survey on the transaction (after looking at the new ticket created).
---
You can enter in the bottom box:
---
“Like the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy.”
---
Hopefully blizzard see how people react and understand that...
---
Thanks for that
---
Profit over human rights and freedom of speech.  
---
Pleasing a fascist regime rather than speaking up as a role model with strong voice.  
---
Blizzard: You had a choice, you could have made a strong statement. And you made the worst.  
---
I hope thousands of players will boycott you.  
---
i uninstalled all of your games and will not buy long awaited wc3 reforged.  
---
there are alternatives.  
---
Screw you.
---
Just cancelled my WoW subscription. My cancellation message:
---
I am ending my subscription because Blizzard has retaliated against the HK Hearthstone champion for advocating Human Rights of the Chinese people. While I am an american, I cowork with Hongkongers every day, and they have become my friends. I will not continue to subscribe to a company that advocates against the human rights of my friends, for the sake of a foreign market share.
---
Having a rule that allows Blizzard to do that for basically any reason is just stupid. You can have whatever take you want on it but it's just an excuse for Blizzard to be greedy and care about their money more than their players...as always. People need to stop mindlessly defending multi billion dollar companies like they are a childhood friend.
---
Yeah seems like it omegalul nt winnie.
---
Username checks out
---
taking the prize money is just twisting the knife in this whole situation
---
Is this the new game we are playing? Hearthstone was shit anyways.
---
“Complex motives”
---
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.
---
But not all politic statements are the same.  I would argue if somebody started ranting about abortion one way or another that would be a very different situation than somebody speaking in the support of people experiencing violent repression for dissident behavior.  I don't really care what the rules are in light of the situation.
---
Don’t go back. They won’t learn.
---
Yes. Just like real cards. You own them.
---
I never was one for events but i DYING to go to one just to say "blizzard told us the world needs heroes, so why is blizzard turnings its back on the heroic protesters in hong kong?"
---
I don't know, but you're right that it's irrelevant.
---
thats not the issue. the point is that he knew that it was against tournament rules to do as he did. so blizzard are in their right to enforce those rules. 
---
its not bad that he voices his political opinion but if he does so in a space where there exist rules against it he surely cant be surprised if he feels consequences.
---
Reasons?
---
I haven't installed this game for the last 8 months or so, and my friends and I have had many discussions about why we have stopped enjoying the game as much
---
To some, its the overwhelming cost of owning a collection, to others like me, it was the shark-jumping of the Warcraft IP into "Silly and funny gnomelaugh.mp4" territory, to a few, it was the backwards slide towards censorship with the changing of card art.
---
Everyone I know is now united behind this.
---
I will never install this game again.
---
out
---
From an earlier post of mine: 
---
For everyone considering this: if you really care about Hong Kong, start boycotting things that actually help the situation. This move you're trying to make and this karma you're trying to reap won't change a thing.
---
Go to the protester's websites, fund their donations, stop buying Made in China stuff. But don't just stop playing a game just to make you feel better about yourself. It won't change a thing.
---
They can do way more impactful things than just quitting a game here
---
The smart way would be to always refer to this affair in humorous way and unpredictable manner, not just "old school spam". 
---
In order to give mods a hard time and just make them lose the game, because their goal is that people forget it asap.
---
I'd prefer to support a company that stays out of politics completely. But if you are going to wade in to them, at least do it to protect human rights and democracy. The stance blizzard has taken has been nothing short of disgusting and offensive, and as of today I have ceased my subscription. I cannot support a company with the values that Blizzard has chosen to support.
---
What they're going to do, is have the attendees write their questions on a card, and hand the question a moderator who will read it aloud to the panel. In other words, the questions will be read by a censor, who decides what is and isn't ok to ask. Calling it.
---
1,500 hours in Overwatch, and I was excited to buy on Switch next week, but I’m out.  This shit is appalling.
---
I am unabashedly on the side of the protestors. That many people probably aren't wrong, and then the shit the police are doing? No contest.
---
Can you give me your account . Im a F2P and I never had a good collection . I will give it back to you .
---
Blizzard finally made it easy for me to stop wasting money on this game. Thanks alot!
---
Good bye hearthstone, you were fun for many years. Uninstalled.
---
I'll probably get downvoted to hell on this. But in my opinion this is overreacting, Blizzard isn't offering a political stage so he shouldn't abuse that. He chose to do so and blizzard lashes back at him. I agree 100% with Blizzard on this, games are not the platform for political statements...
---
Good and costly loll definitely agree
---
But it is time to say good bye
---
Informed people will say the exact same thing about what you said, I won’t downvote you for unwittingly spreading Chinese propaganda seeded through the west that they’re a communist hybrid or mostly capitalist so people don’t compare them to the failed USSR. These actions are textbook communist authoritarianism (otherwise known as totalitarianism) that have been done by every totalitarian state from the USSR, NK, or the many failed communist countries in Latin America. 
---
You’re partially right in that there are a few capliatlist zones sprinkled throughout China that give them a semblance of capitalism, but HK is one of those zones and they’re being trampled by the centralized communist gov for not falling in line, a story as old as the October Revolution. China is behaving like and ultimately are a textbook authoritarian communist country. 
---
Never forget the CCP murdered tens of millions of their own people under Mao, their original communist revolutionary. Never forget the Tank Man.
---
there are loads more screenshots, but you get the point.
---
despicable cowardice from blizzard. guess they calculated the chinese base will spend more than their westerner base. i wonder if that is actually true?
---
Blizzard needs to feel pressure from markets outside of China in order to get than to change. Don't just be upset , boycott, be the change you want to see.
---
The fact people react this way is exactly why there was a rule against doing controversial political things while at the tournament to begin with.
---
"Since" would be a better word, but as far as I can tell, there are no major problems with the post. But then, what do I know? I'm just another Czech guy.
---
I mean, not to defend China, but so does the current administration... 
---
Yeah this is a bad look for Blizzard. Not really defensible.
---
Ah yes, the good ol false equivalency. Well if a hat manufacturer silences democratic speech during a live broadcast and rescinds a champion's awards, then we can start comparing apples to apples. 
---
Rethink your PR strategy Blizzard/PRC shill.
---
I've never spent a penny on Hearthstone. Blizz have been getting a steady income from me for years for WoW.
---
The rules clearly state you forfeit your prize money. They were sticking to the rules actually. I am just saddened for HK in general.
---
I support Hong Kong and his protest. But it clearly stated in the rules you cannot do this type of thing, he knew that and did it anyway. Why is it out of the ordinary for him to be punished for breaking a company’s rules?
---
Same here. Values are worth more than a few hundred dollars to me.
---
Nah. I'm not about to blame a player for pushing a human rights' issue.
---
It doesn't matter what their stance is in private. They made a public stance. They want to keep their market as big as possible, but they can't have everything.
---
You mean the day when nothing happened in 1989?
---
Blizzard is headquartered in the US, a country that led the Iraq war and directly led to the deaths of millions of locals. But yeah, I'm sure your upset about the humans rights violations of China
---
I'm not wrong though, 95%+ of people who say they'll quit over this will either come back or were just looking for an excuse to quit.
---
Alternatively, I know it's in hot as hell California but you could where it under light jackets and dress shirts and store them while inside. Or buy cheap second hand ones and "accidentally" leave them in the bathroom to eliminate being asked to put them back on.
---
D: I'm not really up to date any sauce?
---
Yes. It's Blizzard's lack of controls that caused this to me livestreamed. If they had controls, this never would have gotten out, and they could have avoided this PR shitstorm. 
---
When you give a person passionate about a social issue a microphone in front of 30000 people, what the fuck did they expect is going to happen?
---
OK.Hope you can love your life.
---
I dont believe that you support HK. I cant speak to your other beliefs but stating that you support Blizzards decision is a statement in direct opposition to supporting HK. So either you do support HK and dont support Blizzards decision and your post is therefore meaningless or you dont support HK and do support Blizzards decision which means as I've already stated. Its really that simple. Blizzards actions directly silence the voice of liberty. To support that action, regardless of reasoning, is to support the suppression of democracy.

Fuck Blizzard! I am never playing another Blizz game again.

Do you guys not have phones!?
---
BBC is historically one of the least biased news sources out there. https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/
---
They are slightly left of center (and with the Overton window as it is right now, that might as well just be center lol) but they are highly factual. As the great Colbert once said "The truth has a liberal bias."
---
I think this is the correct stance to take. Just don't get overzealous in protecting your sub, this *will* pass eventually, but I'd suggest letting people get it out of their system
---
Quit for how long or account deleted? I’ve quit overwatch since last night but am on it again. There’s a big difference
---
I mean all you've been doing is trying to argue the semantics of brigading , wrongfully, but that's all you've been doing....just bit funny you choose to argue about semantics and then not argue about semantics whenever it suits your point
---
The subject of a sub doing something publicly and drawing more views to them and therefore inherently the sub....is not brigading 
---
Unless you are trying to argue blizzard brigaded themselves 🤣
---
Agreed. Was looking for someone who already talked about hiding it.
---
Ahhhh streaming makes more sense...I'm still narrow minded when it comes to spending extra money on video games lol
---
This should not have been removed.
---
Evidence is a valid request in a legal or academic contrxt. It has never been and will never be anything someone is entitled to in a conversation. The presumption of the worst account of a strangers claims is obviously and absolutely cynicism. You and OP have a massively inflated sense of what you are entitled to, from whom, and how circumspect your aloofness and condescension really are. 
---
Declaring yourself informed doesn’t make it so, neither does declaring inappropriate restrictions for speech in public forums. You want to be self-important? Do the work to be invited to conversation that demand the level of engagement you and the rest of the r/nothingeverhappens raincloud of a community loudly and petulantly demands of chats on social media. You’re cosplaying as authority and bullying in the only rooms you can exert a little clout.
---
You are very naive to think there is a big difference.  If other companies haven’t already sided with China, they would in a heartbeat.  It is very disingenuous to claim Blizzard is any different from other companies.  It may be convenient for your single serving outrage, but I’m not buying it.
---
Have you thought that maybe, just maybe, Blitzchung broke the rules he agree to follow as outlined in the Blizzard terms of service and if he held the oppisite view and still was banned, you'd at least be apathetic to it?
---
"All" -- where's Druid?
---
I uninstalled. I’ve spent a lot of time in standard correctly predicting opponents’ plays, playing off meta decks, desperately trying to have fun without playing top meta decks like everyone else, and I guess I was just waiting for a reason to quit all along. As a casual NBA fan also, the Houston Rockets thing struck me as crazy. This whole thing meanwhile seems like a total Blizzard move. I GET it...but I don’t feel good supporting it.
---
He is litterally asking people to give evidence of their claims and suggesting a way to make them more impactful. Disagree if you wish but apathetic? How?
---
There is currently no reason to suspect Blizzard would ban accounts named “Blitzchung” because it is nothing more than a name. Names hold value because of the original ones who held them and the actions they took, but they are also just words. That’s the beauty I find in this solution- the name isn’t offensive or vulgar, but it carries weight because of the previous user of the name. I guess that doesn’t really answer your question, but I don’t think this would be risking a ban if you chose this name in particular.
---
&gt; the same companies who want us to believe they wish to make the world a better place.
---
Anyone can wish the world were a better place, that doesn't mean they're going to do dick about it. Virtue signalling does nothing but boost one's ego.
---
It's bonkers to me that people see those thinly-veiled ads from companies about gender equality, etc. as anything other than bullshit.
---
I just want you to know that true Americans, the majority of Americans, as well as the west stand with you and stand with Hong Kong. If you are able to keep fighting and protesting through our election in 2020 we may be able to do more to help.
---
It’s not USD. Converted it’s about $1300 over a looping period. Not that big a deal
---
Awesome my dude! I wont be spending any money on HS or any Blizzard game before they change their stand. Consumers not spending is all a company like this understands.
---
&gt;Censorship by governments is evil, private business can do whatever they want.
---
That is true. And this private business just showed approval to censorship by gov'ts. Ergo, supporting evil.
---
&gt;I wouldn't expect a gun organization to platform someone who's pro banning all guns.
---
Open dialogue is often promoted between disagreeing parties.
---
&gt;The problem here, is people have projected their political beliefs on an a political organization.
---
The problem here, is that people running a company have sided with helping a tyrannical gov't with no regard for human rights censor people.
---
Let me guess, you also support a company using child labor in countries where that's legal?
---
Political affiliation is a protected class in California.
---
But it kind of is integral to what it is today tho. Fuck the Chinese government.
---
I’ll join back if they revert it. I just want the guy unbanned. They probably won’t pull it again either if they do.
---
Right, and when the company censored a political statement to appease a political body, it made a political statement. Which is why everyone's so cheesed off. Because that political statement was "harder, daddy" to Chinese influence on western markets.
---
I'm more pissed because the kid won the fucking tournament and the prize money fair and fucking square and the casters did nothing but their fucking jobs. Like getting fired from mcdonald's because your co-worker's anti-swastika pin offended some stupid fucking redneck so the whole team got let go.
---
Sure they are, and we their customers are allowed to stop supporting them financially, and to speak out against them, because we disagree with their decisions.
---
Arena is made by WotC, which is a subsidiary of Hasbro. Hasbro has a lot of financial interest in China
---
He's also a Detroit Lions fan, he's used to being on the losing side.
---
👌
---
Exactly. Your money, your decisions. I decided to stop giving them money for other reasons entirely - games have just gotten too shallow. 
---
I digress. In the long run, no one will bat an eye. A few very hard opinionated people will quit and never return. A lot will quit, but will be around for the next expansion, and the great majority just doesn't care. 
---
If it isn't a personal traumatic experience, people just forget and move on. They will do so about this too.
---
I sure wish I could enjoy it in good conscience...
---
Well Hong Kong is a human rights 'debate', and you think the Hong Kong protests should be kept quiet, therefore you think human rights should be a *risque topic* instead of something we all need to be discussing
---
 So blizzard banning a player is not directly related to blizzard? Interesting.
---
Brazilian here; 
---
as you should know, we are facing a far right government and the protests here also have violent police response but I 've been taking an umbrela with me to the protests to show we are all together: brazil, europe, hk.

i agree that "whataboutism" is bullshit.
---
You're a fucking pussy, get refunds, you should be willing to lose your life over principles.
---
Not arguing with you but do you have link where it states that is the exact punishment. I'm generally curious
---
Blizzard China revoked player’s prize money for supporting the HK protests. Essentially, the American equivalent would be a game company revoking a person’s prize money after finding out they support radical terrorism, or something like that. But if course, it’s only bad when brown people do it. Hell, people have had their winnings (rightfully) revoked for things like using a bad word, or because they made an edgy tweet 5 years ago, and it didn’t provoke this level of outrage... it’s pretty obvious why that is.
---
By the way, don’t fall for the narrative that the HK protestors are “seeking democracy” or anything like that; anybody with even a cursory knowledge of history knows how much democracy (i.e. none) the Chinese had whilst under British rule.
---
The whole thing is a US funded attempt to destabilize China and provoke then into violence in order to manufacture consent for an invasion. [The US has admitted that it’s funding the protests](

I'll give it another try at some point :) I have idiotic amounts of resources, so I should be able to build some good decks. It's been about a year since I last played.
---
Blizz having tournaments in Taiwan another country victimized by China and expecting their pawns to play their role nicely and promote their game to the communists
---
They contractually do have the right to take every penny he’s earned through Grandmasters. It’s in the contract he signed. Learn how business works
---
well, it is, but if somehow this company gets successful enough to have a game with a large chinese playerbase, they will do exactly what blizzard (and the nba) did. profit-seeking behavior is bad and capitalism forces it on everyone.
---
Played Hearth since the beta lol, just heard about the news.
---
Aight ima head out too.
---
And companies do not have immunity from their consequences by their consumers.
---
Don't do sports if you don't want your company to be involved in politics because the competitors will use any publicity to make a stand if they feel strongly, regardless if you strip them of their medals and ensure they never compete again.
---
Also, fuck China and Winnie Xi Pooh
---
Are we just going to ignore the fact that his username is “GreatKKK”? That’s so fucked up in many ways.
---
This isn’t right.
---
At first i wondered if He had to have known the potential consequences. Now its incredibly obvious he did, which makes it all the more powerful to me.
---
I wish this man nothing but the best, and same to HK
---
China is obviously such a human rights abuser and so little is done just because of money.
---
It's the wasp and the honey trap all over again.
---
You could always fly the Jolly Roger. Yarrr, you’ll get non’ o’ me gold, harhar
---
Eh, Hasbro has an enormous stake in not stepping on any toes in China because of all the manufacturing.
---
They want to maximize collateral damage. It's easier to be brave if your own neck is on the line, but China knows that you can further kowtow people if you link their actions to innocent people getting punished. It's the same idea as social credit punishing friends and family.
---
just added him, thanks for a reminder mate)
---
People do this kind of thing all the time, gay rights, women's rights ,trans rights , fuck Trunp..orange man bad..all kinds of rights... they take that opportunity Limelight, stand up in front of a crowd or on television... and push their agenda consistently. this happens time and time again but in this instance we have a f****** problem???
---
I want to say the American woman soccer team went way overboard in pushing their agenda when given the opportunity,  do you remember that? No one shut them up..
---
I guarantee you whatever device you're using to virtue signal right now, has parts that were made through the use of child labor, and if not slave labor.
---
why garrosh corrupted tho
---
It might even be better from an activism standpoint if Blizzard visibly denies entry to people wearing Hong Kong shirts. Can you imagine how terrible it would make them look? Apparently, damaging reputation is generally the most effective measures a boycott of a big company can take, and I think this would *really* hurt their image. It's even possible Blitzchung figured he might be banned for what he did, and purposefully did it anyway as a way to draw more attention to the injustice perpetuated by big companies. This article originally gave me the idea, if you're curious: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/do-boycotts-work_l_5d4cb97be4b0066eb70f19fa
---
Obviously, nobody wants to be turned away from a convention they spent so much money on, but it's something to consider if you're willing to do it.  Not passing judgement on your advice, or on anyone who wouldn't want to do this, of course. Just a though.

They would celebrate it of course. Because it's only bad to suppress speech that we like.
---
I'm not sure what the response would be for TRUMP 2020, but remember that Blizzard and Blizzard China are two entities run very differently because of their respective markets. That said, because of what happened this time, I would expect a severe response.
---
Not sure about the casters, maybe they were in the wrong in some way or didn't do enough to avoid the situation? Unsure. It's always difficult trying to figure out things from the outside looking in.
---
Regarding climate change, it's a big political deal now, but remember it's actually based on scientific research and observations too so they could have some wiggle room on that topic based on that. Or, they too would likely want to avoid the topic because it is also controversial.
---
Generally companies want to stay away from controversial topics because it's not good for sales (alienating a portion of your potential customer base is not good business strategy- unless your target market IS one of the controversial sides, then it's just a question of how deep you want to jump in.)
---
Its users aren't.
---
*sees Garrosh* Oh HELL YEAH.
---
At the end of it all though the only interpretation that would matter would be reddits. Regardless of your intentions if reddit decided to take the stance that your personal ideas where an attack what recourse would you have? Sure other people may get angry but hey a bunch of people here are angry. At the end of the day if the wrong decision helps their bottom line then the business is probably going to take it because in the end the business is a business for one sole purpose. Getting that money!
---
I guess it's pretty easy to tell people to die with nothing to lose. You want a pat on the back?

Yes, nobody is disagreeing with you.

What I'm saying is that Blizzard is actively choosing the political stance that makes them the most money.
---
Refunded.
---
Plus the red shirt. Now i am liking this.
---
If i read the comments on the other posts about this topic + the generally, unpredictable butthurt of the average reddit user if they have to face unpopular opinions on topics they don't even understand or want to understand... nah, thanks.
---
Unfortunately for you guys it's the casuals and whales that keep the game alive, not the r/hearthstone population. You guys might need a different strategy.
---
&gt;Blizzard made a choice that they did not want to be a political platform 
---
No. This is the exact opposite of what they did. Not being a political platform means that you dont let politics drive business decisions. So in fact they made a choice *to be a political platform* the minute they invoked a punishment based off of politics differences
---
You want to be non-political? Then dont act in accordance with politics
---
Nice try, China.
---
Or you do the opposite like Colbert just did Andrew Yang and only show choice footage to make a joke about his crowd being sparse mere seconds after he says "After a rally..." 
---
You know. After. The time when people generally leave.

You’re not playing a video game isn’t going to free the prisoners and liberate HK. You’ll PROBABLY realize that when you’re realistic.

Yea but none of that shit happened. Prove your correct with something else blizzard has done.

Blizzard is unrecognizable from the company it was in the 90s/early 00s.

I find it fascinating when people dumb enough to simply ignoring the truth. They had these demands as you said, they also showed riots completely otherwise. I bet you didn't even bother to watch the video I posted and showed your ignorance as in your post.
---
What I'm stating is the truth that I see which happens to be the same as other more than 1 billion people. You? I don't really care you can't present your argument with facts it's not worth spending any more effort educating idiots.
---
This. Honestly I'd much rather any company to not get involved in politics, especially a gaming company. Focus on the game, and don't overreach your influence. 
---
Also, I have a question as devil's advocate. Shouldn't Blizzard have the right to control what content is promoted on their platform? Would this seem so bad if it was a person speaking out for pedophilia or in support of racist protests? Why should a company be forced to take a side? Them allowing this content could be seen as equally outrageous for people in China, who could quit for Blizzard supporting democratic insurgents.
---
Yup, this is good time to stop. I don't even like this game.
---
Be brave, my dude, you will find new hobbies! I'm investigating some new digital card game multiplayer goodness as we speak.....I won't mention any names.
---
I'm full in MTG but I love to jump into the Single player Gwent version from time to time. I do like it a lot. Same question for you as people are asking me about MTG. Where should I start?
---
Guess I'm not man. Our toilet ain't splashed with pee though
---
Contracts aren't always legally valid. There have been numerous legal cases in various western countries (including the US) where contract clauses have been declared invalid. It obviously isn't a traditional job but a clause where your boss can decide not to pay you money they owed you for basically any reason sounds like the sort of thing that might not hold up.
---
That said, legal action against Blizzard on this would take ages and cost a huge amount (far more than the prize money). Also, IANAL and I have no idea what the outcome of such a case would be.
---
Prohibition on vague laws require 2 conditions to be fulfilled : being vague, and being a law. Sounds crazy, but a vague rule still isn't a law.
---
There's definitely something to be said about retroactively removing the salary of the player, but they're in their full rights to fire all 3 on the spot based on a vague contract clause.
---
Ah I didn't notice that my bad. Idk if you were calling me confrontional but nothing I said was.
---
Dude, worry about your own life more than other peoples’. If he earned the money he could spend it all on hookers, butterflies, or cheese if he wanted.
---
Someone (while i agree with them) needlessly brought politics into something that didn't need to be political. Blizzard basically doesn't want politics to be discussed in this realm and (rather harshly I'll agree) punished them.  
---
Now tons of people who didn't even know the Hong Kong this was going on prior to this are suddenly Activists against Blizzard and uninstalling or claiming they won't play any games ever again but will forget about this in about 2 weeks and go back to usual life because this doesn't actually affect them directly.

Do you have a job? Well then you pay income taxes, and those taxes go towards keeping the US govt afloat. And guess what the us govt does? It trades with China!
---
Better go quit your job lest you accidentally start hating human rights....
---
Bruh he said he agreed with the protesters, but that there was some misinformation going on about the rules (most people ignored their existence). While I don't agree with Blizzard and will be dropping the game, I can understand them wanting to uphold this rule regardless of the stance the player takes on a matter.
---
Needs some Tegridy.
---
Maybe I should rephrase. 
---
They don’t care about blitzchung. This is not about standing up for him being the right thing to do. 
---
This is just about the PR, and the point of that PR is profits. It’s exactly the same circus that Blizzard is dancing to. Today they might say the right thing, tomorrow they may something totally different and morally reprehensible, but so long as it’s in the interests of profits, that can be a totally logically consistent flip in the eyes of the company. 
---
The fact that the PR takes the guise of supporting free speech is not relevant at all. So long as the bottom line is the dollar, you can’t expect consistency and you can’t read this as a company intentionally doing good.  Incidental good is not the same thing.
---
My friends would just say “ok bye”.
---
Already do at every opportunity, where feasible. Turned down a very well paying job in mainland China last month because it involved education and thus the proliferation of propaganda. Where I can, I do.
---
Yeah...something tells me that this message won't really get the message across.
---
yes exacly my point. Blizzard does not need to ask for ID from paying customers to delete their account.
---
Can we ask an individual for ID?
---
If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information. However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The key to this is proportionality.
---
You need to let the individual know as soon as possible that you need more information from them to confirm their identity before responding to their request. The period for responding to the request begins when you receive the additional information.
---
I stated at the beginning that this was a verbatim repost. OK shill
---
Sry didn’t realize Canada didn’t have streets.
---
Lol, bootlicker.  I haven't paid Blizzard a penny in close to a decade.  I'm a pragmatist and unlike you, I wrote my congressman last YEAR urging sanctions against China but the spineless weasel won't do anything.
---
But yeah, I guess I'm a bootlicker because I don't expect a company to throw away half a billion dollars.  Nevermind that even if you guys cost Blizzard a 100 million dollars in revenue, it's still less than if they lost the Chinese market.
---
Stop pointing your outrage at a company and point it to your congressmen and congresswomen.  They're the agents of change, not f'n Activision.
---
Thanks for doing the legwork here.
---
I’ve just completed my refund. I know $43.99 isn’t a lot, but it’s what I can do in my current situation.
---
Fuck Activision and fuck Blizzard.
---
Mike Morhaime can jump off a cliff for steering one of my favorite developers into the ground.
---
I believe so, or golden epics.
---
You said it's not a moral issue. I said that was wrong. How hilarious that you're talking about reading when you're this stupid. 
---
If you wear clothes that you know are produced in a sweatshop, that's a moral issue. If you support a company that shits on human rights, that's a moral issue.
---
Where did I say that people can't do it though? I didn't anywhere. hate to repeat myself but, you're a moron.
---
The fact that you think supporting evil corporations isn't a moral issue is just a symbol of your willingness to ignore things that make you feel bad so you can keep playing your cardgames and that's whatever. I haven't once said you shouldn't be able to. It just makes you a prick.
---
Depends. Look at Thjis for example. When he streams HS, he's in the higher area (6-8k viewers?) But when he switches to MtG Arena, it drops to 2k. 
---
Dog was the same. When TFT first came out it was hot fire but now he gets maybe 4k, when he used to get 10k on HS daily.
---
Hard to say, but I think it's a bit overboard for everyone to assume they'll jump ship immediately without restructuring their finances first.
---
2 Weeks. At most
---
But the game is fun
---
And it isn't good because it will not work.
---
They will have to bring the subreddit back eventually, but the Internet does not forget. 
---
The longer they keep the dam gates open, the bigger the flood when they open back.
---
[Amaz made some fairly neutral comments, mostly just saying he's aware of the issue.](https://twitter.com/Amaz/status/1181625363325161474)
---
Given that he has family in Hong Kong, I don't hold it against him that he's careful in his wording here.
---
Huh, all of his purchases went to waste since his account was deleted. All of that money down the drain, damn.
---
Also another thing people can do is 1 star hearthstone on Google play store
---
Good. One voice against tyranny.
---
But that won't happen, because with capitalism, it's the job of the CEOs and The Board to make as much money as possible, and damn the ethics. People have the right to express their disappoint with this, and vote with their wallet.
---
Try Eternal.
---
Their reward system is far better than HS, and the mechanics of the game is somewhere between MTG and HS.
---
That's not what you originally said. People can literally see you moving the goal posts from one post to the other.
---
I repeat, save us from your moaning about pc, the world has real problems, and real oppression to face.
---
does china pay you or are you just afraid of your social credit score getting lower?
---
Whose claiming this as a freedom of speech issue?  Blitzchung was free to say as he wished.  Blizzard was free to assign consequences to this words.  And we're free to assign consequences to Blizzard for what they did.
---
Or are you just setting up strawmen here?
---
Hearthstone
---
I'm okay with that. In fact it's wonderful that corporations are seeing value in pink money. More visibility for us will help normalise lgbt people in society. We are everywhere but people still treat us like shit. 
---
What I'm not comfortable with is that someday they will turn of us if social trends and laws shift. I genuinely know there are companies out there that go above and beyond compliance and cater to the LGBT eg. multi million dollar fmcg's like Godrej which is an Indian company and even though gay people have no rights in India. The company has created health insurance plans for same sex who can't get married because of the law of the land. They even have zero tolerance for LGBT discrimination and even employed a gay man as a leader of one of its subsidiaries.
---
yup delayed.
---
How is it that they can do that and deddit (the community, not the company) just accept that? Subreddits are communities, they're not supposed to be official forums that can shut down to stop discourse. The mods should be removed and any conflict of interests should be sorted out. Too bad Reddit (the company) is Tencent Gang now.
---
It's not. Blizzard as a company shouldn't take a stance. Yes, the protest is important and obviously you should support it. But Blizzard needs the market. Similar case - During WW2, Coke created Fanta so that they could sell soda in Nazi Germany. Does that make Coca Cola a bad business? No. They weren't supporting Nazi Germany but they weren't publicly saying Nazis were bad (as Fanta at least) because that'd lose them a lot of business.
---
Nice
---
Human nature isn't ethically driven, it's based on survival &amp; pleasure so human nature would eat the whole cake &amp; wouldn't share. The only reason some would care if Hitler made it or not is because of the arbitrary ethics that we have made up over time. But I would eat the cake because it is cake.
---
I take your point but by supporting them you are supporting Hearthstone, which supports Blizzard, which defeats the entire purpose of the boycott.
---
It would force them to change platforms or pressure Blizzard. Supporting Blizzard content supports Blizzard, and thus the Chinese government crackdown in Hong Kong.
---
If you disallow totalitarian regimes from owning shares in US companies, the US economy would collapse.  No politician would do anything in this case.  
---
Can they do something about Trump telling the Chinese he would ignore Hong Kong if the Chinese agreed to a trade deal?  Yes.
---
Careful, content in support of HK gets you banned here ysk.
---
That’s really sad if you spent that much money to get elite, I only spent like $20 to get to the top.
---
Wow. Yeah. Time to uninstall. That's my last blizzard game that I've had installed. GG blizz.
---
Yes, but how many of them are versed in the specific details of an online card game and esport personality?
---
Actually, I'm literally laughing out loud right now.  You honestly believe that Activision can change the world.  That if they stood up to China then China would cave.  You're either incredibly stupid or a teenager.
---
Is your message "I don't value my time"?
---
Take a look in the mirror before accusing others.
---
That should be pinned as top post on reddit until something changes.
---
Most likely employee will laugh at you
---
I did that after i join MTG.  Never needed to look back. There are so many good card games on the market as well.
---
No thanks boiiiiiii, Artifact may have less players but it's more fun
---
And that's what is hilarious about it. You pay 100x more for a free game and you still need to unlock more
---
the folks spending their money how they want to are the suckers.
---
MTG arena gives each player multiple starter decks when new sets come out so that new players aren't left behind. Their card crafting system is pretty good as well. Their booster packs contain 7 cards and can include wild cards of each rarity, which can be traded in for any card of the same rarity.
---
I can’t see it on mobile either. Any minute now...right?
---
I uninstalled, reinstalled and uninstalled again because it felt so right
---
Yeah I mean they sent you this email which is a comment about banning you. Just something that points directly at your post and says "this is why"
---
Maybe it's about showing companies like Blizzard that it's up to the little guy. I'm the little guy, you're the little guy. I don't expect the U.S. government to do much officially at this point, but regardless of that, I'm gonna do my bit. 願榮光歸香港 = Liberate Hong Kong, I hope
---
I've been supporting Blizzard since 2007. I was playing Classic. Guess who will not play anymore? :)
---
Or there's a conflict of interest among the mod team and they'd rather shut down discourse than deal with it.
---
Are you implying that by stop playing HS you are actually fighting for the freedom of the people of Hong-Kong? For real.
---
This is some next level slacktivism...
---
Same here buddy
---
It won't require an update
---
It'll be out in 30 minutes
---
You mean that couple hundred folks are quitting? Most of them will be back too
---
I actually like the Rogue one in the photo. Yet to update to see her in game though.
---
This is a great idea, but can we be super careful about not turning this into some kind of witch hunting thread alá "Why hasn't X commented yet" or "Y's statement wasn't strong enough"?
---
As much as I want them to, no one is obliged to comment on political issues, especially if (unlike us) they have something to lose.
---
Yeah pinpointing an agressor midst months of riots then comparing with KKK racism.  
---
Presenting your skewed vision with biased examples is not useful.
---
I live my life completely oblivious to politics and I’m doing just fine.
---
Holy fuck
---
Correct, as well as the Witcher series. Incredible games if you haven’t played them.
---
It's only moral to boycott Blizzard at this point
---
I don't really know any other good mobile card games, but when I want to kill time on commutes I usually play rhythm games (favourites include Lanota and Cytus) or MMOs (there's a really good mobile MMO called Dawn of Isles). Gatcha games like Fire Emblem Heroes or Dragalia Lost can be pretty fun too.
---
idk i'm more ruin/despair/destruction
---
+1
---
I'm uninstalling as soon as I get home.  It's shameful to be associated with Blizzard now.
---
In the end, the righteous must prevail. Human nature can only endure so much.
---
I honestly believe in the core good of humanity - that all roads lead to a good place eventually. 
---
Everything that is happening around the world is a rough patch, but this ship isn't ready to sink.
---
Together we can do this - time can be a bright light which shines on the evil of others.
---
I'm the kind of guy that understand no matter what position someone is in, they will eventually be in a position to see the fault in their misdeeds. If they never get to that point, then they are in a minority, not the majority.
---
Hope wins in the end, and as long as humanity's heart keeps beating, there's hope.
---
that's cause china basically said we're banning you anyways so it's like "ok whatever then," hardly respectable.
---
You better stop shopping at Walmart, Amazon, Apple and the countless other major corporations that support the Chinese government.  Otherwise, it looks like you're just virtue signaling for attention
---
ok we don't give a shit, guys go bitch about it elsewhere
---
Well I guess they are a business first and foremost, Their moral would be secondary and money is the first. But why damage the very consumer that generate your revenue. Player themself should not be affected outside the game, they should be able to voice their opinion on such topic without being penalized in game or tournament wise. “I” believe that player should be priority &gt; some Chinese Corp. This is like smacking your own customer, only to ask,” why does our customer keep complaining and leaving?”.
---
They're deleting comments on their Facebook ads for blizzcon tickets/deleting their whole posts and reposting.  Busy day for them. 
---
People are spamming links on how to refund your tickets, cancel orders, or do charge backs though your bank.
---
The returned cards are not of your collection, rather "event tokens".
---
I'll install it right now, thank you.
---
Communism is fine, it's the selfishness that is the cancer.
---
See how dumb that is?
---
3 demands! not one less!
---
Jut tag onto to one of the other 5,000 posts saying the same thing. No need to flood the sub for your internet points.
---
Prob because so many people are wanting the Hong long player to be exempt from the rules. He broke them, that’s it.
---
Gwent and hearthstone aren't exactly similar style card games, but i would say Gwent is definitely worth trying out. the reward/progression system is actually insane compared to hearthstone.
---
Remember Russia has three younger siblings. China, North Korea, and Cuba.
---
Fuck Blizzard.
---
I was getting back to hearthstone for the pve content and probably the next expansion. But after knowing what happened, i uninstalled it. Not going back to blizz games. They fucked me over with HOTS and now this.
---
China is asshoe.
---
- Are you under the impression that opinions can't be wrong?
---
Ok, good point. I agree that opinions can be wrong. 
---
That said, the OPs post doesn’t rise to the level of  “nonsense”, so just saying it’s wrong doesn’t really add anything to the conversation. Instead make a case for why politics and gaming should be mixed rather than dismissing his view out of hand.
---
According to the site 'removeddit.com' it said: "Everyone who's already bought a Blizzcon ticket should show up wearing a t-shirt supporting Hong Kong." [link](http://removeddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dey8bh/_/f2zpcjr/)
---
I'd say give it a shot, I last actively played in like 2012-13 or whenever MvM was still at most a year old.  It has a strange way of pulling you back in...still pretty active too. Figured I may as well give in to it since who knows how long it'll have a decently sized playerbase lol
---
Yet the NBA China story is still up double standard... Not impressed with that sub at all.
---
Not really. I personally think of any repeated spending for something a sub whether reoccurring or not. But I guess "spend money" would have been more broad. Still kinda moot
---
I hope every player who is in one of these comps keeps saying proHK things, until there’s nobody left to compete
---
$100m buys a lot of silence.
---
Especially since Reddit is very anti china
---
you know this is handled by the legal, compliance, and data protection groups right?
---
Correction, he used Blizzard's platform
---
I mean, it's pretty clear in the rules that politics, religion are banned subjects, isn't it?
---
The Hong Kong stuff is what this post is about.
---
Thanks, now that you've weighed in it can be put to rest
---
Yeah, the casters being fired is the part of the situation that really pisses me off. 
---
Like blitzchung being suspended is at least somewhat-excusable to me, if only because GM has certain rules all players agree to prior to joining, and he broke those rules by being political. Yes, his political message was important and just, but them’s the rules according to Blizzard. I doubt Blizzard would immediately ban another player if they were to say “Trump 2020 MAGA!” during an interview, but they would be within their right to do so. 
---
Aside from that, firing the casters is just *too much*. Like, what were they supposed to do, talk over him, immediately cut off the stream? Isn’t that more on the production team anyways? Yes, he had the whole protestor get-up on, but it’s not like they could read minds. 
---
That was their livelihood, and you’re taking it away from them because China *might* get mad? Same goes for blitzchung obviously, but at least he was the one who explicitly broke the rules.
---
Hey beanienug, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
That's true, but their overall spending just -now- caught up with the US. If they continue spending that much money as their economy matures they'll greatly overshadow the US over time. But there is no telling if that'll hold, especially with how much disdain the current CCP government has for games.
---
"Gamer pride" and "Rise up gamers" should never be said unironically.
---
Blizzard sucks dick but for the love of god please don't be so embarrassing.
---
Cool. Don't care anymore. That was kinda my point.
---
Huh...we're starting out decent into the cyberpunk apocalypse aren't we? Welp...see yall on the other side I guess.
---
Mate, I play anything my PC or my Phone can run, and that means that I play Hearthstone. I don't care about playing "this one specific videogame" unless I'm hooked on it.
---
The "independent" tribunal is made up of falun gong supporters and was started by the same people who testified in it. 
---
It was not independent. It proved nothing. It was a kangaroo court with nothing to back it up.
---
If you don't know about falun gong, look up the recent scandal about the epoch times, they spent the most money of anybody on facebook advertising that was pro trump.
---
The same people who are antivax, anti medicine, believe trump was sent by god, believe aliens created technology to enslave us, **are the same people who are saying that China is harvesting organs.**
---
Does that not raise red flags for you?
---
I'd love to, but that's against the terms of service. We all know how Blizzard feels about the terms of service.
---
I'll be joining you, my friend. Let this be the hour that we draw swords together!
---
Sure! I hope to see you in game :)
---
/r/Conspiracy is over that way my friend ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Stop. There are plenty of other games put there.
---
The severity of the sanction is irrelevant to judge their motivation.
---
Yeah I meant that part in regards to other grandmasters and casters. I realize my post can be confusing because I am putting streamers, GMs, and casters all under the same umbrella. For streamers I am worried about people being upset at them for continuing to stream Hearthstone (which I saw happen to Thijs) and for a significant drop in views.
---
I have retrieved these for you _ _

You can't possibly avoid politics, that almost makes no sense as a concept given that everything you do is political.  Even moreso when you produce games fictional governments and economic systems

This is a rule that doesn’t need to be broken though.

I already knew everything you’re explaining, you’re the one who is just overreacting.

Is there anyway to do this without giving them an image of my photo id?

Oh this shit gonna be good.
---
You can’t and they don’t care. They choose Chinese players over American players.

This was okay until "7th gold-plated" blah blah. Something a child would write.

I've never noticed that little bug crawling out of the pocket before.  
---
But guys, doesn't that bug look exactly like Xi Jinping?  
---
It would be a real shame if everyone started talking about it and Xi became really self conscious about looking like a bug in a pocket. Would be a real shame if he had a complex that made him want to ban things that resemble him, like this pocket bug.  
---
I wonder if me even saying "Xi Jinping is pocket bug confirmed" might make him really insecure about himself and ban Hearthstone.  
---
I sure hope no one else lets him know that he has a pocket bug doppelganger.
---
The rule is not to say anything that can offend people. He also used their platform for a personal push. I'm not saying I'm against HK whatsoever, just explaining why he dis break tourney rules.
---
Canceled my WoW subscription today. It costs nothing and you dont lose your game time already paid for. All it does is show Blizz that you dissaprove of their actions. If later you can't play without game time buy it then cancel your sub again. It does nothing to hurt or inconvenience gamers but from a bussiness view it will hurt Activision/Blizzards pocketbooks through projection numbers.
---
Just to be clear you are stating that staring at a wall is the only alternative you can think of to playing a videogame?
---
Not even all video games, just the ones made by blizzard. That's a pretty small fraction of the wealth of games which are available to play without supporting human rights violations.
---
I quitted hearthstone when Activision censored game's artwork to pander chinese players. They censored the secretkeeper...pathetic.
---
Oh ok, I understand now. I agree with your post, blizzard is only going to change something if those who are employed protest this en masse
---
They key to pushing any actual damage to Blizzard is actually sticking with a boycott, or whatever you're doing (quitting, etc.). They're of course expecting that since this is a fresh issue that people will react, they're also expecting that this will be smoothed over in a month at most.
---
I don't play HS anymore, I quit quite awhile ago when it was obvious that Blizzard had no interest in making HS into a good game by adding to it. I don't have a dog in this fight, they already get zero of my money. But if you're serious about taking a stand and voting with your wallet you cannot back down, pretty much ever. Otherwise you're just reinforcing that they can get away with bad behavior, take a loss for a short amount of time, and then it will all be back like it was.
---
I'm only saying this because in the heat of the moment, it's easy to quit. But then your mind will wander back to the habit of playing, how much money you've spent on the game, friends who play, etc. There are a lot of powerful forces that will try to tempt you to go back and those are things you need to be prepared to deal with. Quitting games with a long term investment isn't easy, psychologically, for most.
---
That said, to anyone that sticks with it, good for you. :]
---
Okay. Well. Cya. Why not visit the runescape sub, been having people leave for weeks with no response from corporate.
---
Some things are more important than our happiness playing video games. I would also love to see people give a shit about local elections as well. (in the US) This shit we are all going through together, that we all hate.. is because too many people don't care. The more we don't care, the more they make life shitty for us. Please care.
---
His name shows like 400 times on the front page
---
Face your mistakes with pride you fucking cowards. In the internet age, people know just how shitty you are. Blizzard is over in America. Let it burn and let them be a message to the other US based companies that blow Chinese money out their ass.
---
Hearthstone has been wearing thin for a while. This might just be enough catalyst for many players. It was for me.
---
Thank you holy shit
---
I don't understand the outrage with Blizzard, yet every day we buy products that are from and manufactured in China.  If this isn't just an exercise in virtue signaling, then show your opposition to china by boycotting every major corporation that supports the Chinese government ... You know, companies like Amazon and Walmart and Apple and the countless other that our daily lives revolve around.
---
they haven't canceled the q/a yet?
---
*Expecting* them to do the slimy, penny-pinching thing that fills their shareholders' pockets at the cost of moral principles doesn't make it okay when they actually do it.
---
What a cuntfaced fucks 0_0
---
Capitalism is *garbage*. Even its supposed strongpoints of "technological advances through competition", not only is that untrue - it's much more efficient to shoot your competitors in the foot by lobbying against letting better products reach the shelves than it is to make a better product - but *cooperation is better at it anyway*. Add to this that capitalism is wasteful - it'd rather produce in excess then destroy the excess than aim for the right quantity to produce in the first place - and when I see us faced with the impending doom of climate change, I really gotta ask why are we still defending the system that's been slowly killing us for the past two centuries?
---
Capitalism doesn't care about making us live better lives. It cares about *maximising profits*. Benjamins over people. Why aren't we switching to a system that'd actually care for the wellbeing of people as its objective rather than an often neglected side goal?

Wow good job

Crazy, I will research it more tonight.  If that is true, absolutely.  I trust the UN resolution panel generally, so this is a surprise.
---
After the organ harvesting news broke? I dunno man. They are certainly at least trying to give them a run for their money.
---
Oh, don't you know? Companies change core values every year depending on their current leaders.

Ty

But you no gild him!

Why the casters??

thats brutal

Unfortunately I'm not in the EU but I hope you guys scorch earth these Chinese fellatio enthusiasts

International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Avery Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be.
---
I 100% agree with that statement. Keep the forum in the context it was meant to be. No one would argue that their cuase was ill-intended . Just this was not the time or the place for it.
---
I'm pretty sure you could just write to support. But at the end of the day, I'm certain the Support people will just have instruction to delete every complain post they receive.  
---
I think your best bet is to look for media visibility. Twitter, FB, instagram, anything. Reach out to the influencer around you. Reach out to friends and family. Spread the news.
---
No it shouldn’t but how do you enforce a whole country like USA to stop people from doing unpaid overtime voluntarily? It has to be a complete widespread change across every company (even volunteer work, or actual helpful jobs like hospitals) because the minute you put value on a worker that stays longer, it will get to exactly where we are here.
---
There was an amazing interview with Jason Schrier and one of the heads of CDPR on the Kotaku Splitscreen podcast where the CDPR guy basically went said that “we have to tell these guys to go home and stop working and that it’s okay to not work.” Work culture will punish the lowest end even if it’s voluntary so it has to be hard pushed by everyone, which...
---
Then what do you want them to do?
---
As does everybody else. I didn't call you anything hateful or say a learning disability is something immediately negative, you drew that implication, possibly out of your own feelings about learning disabilities. 
---
I pointed out that commenting the same thing on repeat for the sake of being contrary without regard to the fact that people are genuinely upset sounds like you have difficulty processing information or naunces of conversation. If it wasn't a poor attempt at comedy it could be a serious indicator that you may need to seek some kind of treatment or special attention for an issue that is in no way funny. I do apologize for phrasing it in a way that was attempting to echo yours as that may have added to the confusion you're currently feeling.
---
However, if you're just trolling, refer to my original comment and have a blessed day.
---
Two days
---
Just a bunch of bros sack tapping each other at work and farting in each others faces! nothing wrong with that!
---
I really doubt they would punish a player who made a statement supporting China. If you want to be neutral, just do nothing. It's that simple.
---
Blizzard is and independent firm and internal rules are much more tolerated than what you think. I don’t know if that’s the same for the us, but for example church here in Italy selects the teacher of Catholics school in base of morality (you could not have the work place just because you have had civil marriage instead of a religious one). And that seems to be against the principle of the constitution that says that everyone is equal, but it is allowed because it reflects the beliefs of the community. 
---
About the fact that blizzard should have publicised the rule: I think it did in that little button that we press we agree with the terms of use (that we should read more carefully maybe). Therefore law does not tolerate ignorance.
---
(I’m not supporting blizz with my speech, I’m just  saying that the legal situation might be more complicated that what it seems)
---
Also, does you bank really listen to this request?
---
Same here, my friend. Never a dime.
---
Agreed. I only played occasionally, but I'm done now. Don't let China bully you like this, Blizzard. Have a spine.
---
WTF is Blizzard in the thrall of the chinese government?
---
Bet you’re ass we will.
---
Try Eternal if you want something on mobile.
---
You guys can not be serious , the NBA wich is the National Basketball League had to Double Down because they had made aswell a mistake mixing  into Politics into China , now here is the Real Question , do you really believe Deinstalling a Video Game From your Platfrom  from Blizzard / Activision or not buying a Game anymore from them , will change anything in Hong Kong , if you truly believe this , you gota be out of your god damn mind .
---
What are you talking about? Blizzard didn't randomly ban a critic. They VERY clearly make professional players sign a contract in which states they can NOT talk about politics while on Blizzard platforms.
---
This is not about China, they would've banned him if he was a Nazi, a communist or was trying to force any other politic on a world stage.
---
Blizzard is trying to keep Hearthstone about Hearthstone, that doesn't mean they don't support HK... Please try to be rational.
---
Lol I was on the fence, but I’m not buying COD anymore.
---
Maybe this is what it will take for Hearthstone to die
---
My other verification methods got denied so I had to do it that way
---
Well, most of these companies don't actually choose to use slaves, but if they produce in an area where slaves are used, and most subcontractors use slaves, they don't sometimes have a real choice. 
---
Not excusing it, but explaining. Truth is far more boring than reality.
---
Hi Chinese trolls in the comments, how's your tongue doing? Must be rough licking that many boot soles. Does it irritate you to see someone can act according to their morals? Does it shock your cognitive dissonance to see someone actually putting their money where their mouth is? This is what actual human beings with empathy call "compassion". You might want to try it out some time.
---
If you enjoy the person I would continue to watch them. If you feel strongly about it encourage them to play other games.
---
They covered both, but Communism as a concept (though it's obviously linked to them) was covered in History class.
---
I have a feeling we're gonna get a lot of reporters mispronouncing HearthStone in the coming days.
---
This needs more visibility.
---
Even most video games are a better choice, single player with one-and-done monetization.
---
I hate to break it to you... but captialism has been this way forever.
---
The USA sold weapons and technology to Germany during WW2 before we became involved for fucks sake.
---
I just wanna say, I don't know much about MTGA's financial model but the new player experience is *mwah* perfect.  You slowly unlock 15 different decks, and you get a series of 5 quests every single day that you can do to get resources, so it always feels like your time in the game is useful, working toward something.
---
Again, I don't know how much it costs to keep up with the meta, etc., but I would recommend anyone to play the game for two weeks and do all the stuff at the beginning, that alone is a great f2p experience.
---
Oh wow, that's way more than I thought.
---
This happens if they have an update that you don't, as mentioned above. But, it can also happen if the other person is on PC and their client has timed out but they haven't logged out.
---
I appreciate your stand. China is taking things too far, and Blizzard’s capitulation is cowardly. 
---
Blizzard, if you see this, I ($1000+ vanilla hearthstone player) will also refuse to pay another dime into the game until I feel you have a more moral stance towards these issues. I get that you don’t want to have pro players getting overtly political all the time, but this response was outrageously pro-China. Remember where you came from and who your biggest fan base is.
---
Don't put poor coochie at this level of shitiness. He may steal, but he has more dignity
---
I just added an edit to my comment before seeing your repley that they do say new signups need an invite on the a blog post, so I don't think you were trying to trick people. also after seeing your comment I un bolded the first part of my post to make it less inflammatory. I hope I don't cause you any undue hate. 
---
I might have jumped the gun a bit thinking the worst, but I still think people should know if they are being giving a link that rewards someone, even if there is no real reason to not do so. hope you see you in the game friend.
---
I'm not naive about it at all. They will feel social pressure to do something; their chat will not function normally, but will be focused on this important issue. I think those are good things. I don't think that is harassment. 
---
People should remain civil, and when they don't streamers and mods can ban them. If they want to ban any mention of HK in their chat, that's their right.
---
Advocating for a position you believe in and encouraging others to support that position is a fundamental way to attempt to engage in social change.
---
I am sorry for streamers, and even more so for Blizzard employees; they didn't ask for this and now they have to face it. But it's a little like driving along and a major car crash happens in front of you. The right thing to do is to stop and help, even if that is an inconvenience, or you're going to be late, or you're going to miss a meeting and lose some money. Again, you don't have to stop and help, it's not against the law to drive by. But you should.
---
The punishment was not proportionate to the crime compares to how Blizzard has react to things in the past. 
---
It's all to appease the Chinese government. If they really cares about the rules a simple warning or small suspension would suffice.
---
Lol he got a silver
---
In absolute numbers yes, but not more per capita. 
---
It's still a serious problem that requires global solutions.
---
Most of you who are outraged by this are hypocrites.   
---
Most of the products you wear or use are made in China. Why are you not boycotting those companies? The situation in Hong Kong was happening way before this Blizzard thing happened. Nestle is privatising water sources all over the world, turning water in a luxury. Your clothes are made by some kids in Vietnam or wherever who barely make 2 dollars a day. Yet, you are still wearing Nike, Adidas, whatever... Your consumerism is fueling both the US and chinese empires, yet you fall for this crap easier than my drunk grandma. Your PC's are made in China, phones as well, yet you flock like sheep to buy the latest product. Hypocrites... You only find a topic that is convinient to you, so you gather, you identify as someone who's "offended", but you are lying to yourself, only feeding your little ego's.
---
&gt;Senators aren’t the only people upset with Blizzard’s decision. There appears to be internal dissent at the company as well. Values like “Think Globally” and “Every Voice Matters” that are displayed at the offices have been covered with paper.
---
At least the employees at Blizzard are showing they don't stand for this. Someone called the shot on this, and whoever that was, needs to be called out.
---
It's ok, I'm pretty sure they calculated that as collateral. Still makes more money from China 🙌
---
I think he probably meant $10k HKD which is roughly $1200 USD. I could be wrong though, he could be crazy rich. IDK
---
&gt; According to the company’s most recent financial data, from June 2019, the entire Asia-Pacific region makes up [a scant 12 percent](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial) of its revenue 
---
Well well well.  All those people saying it was a 70/30 split in favour of china were wrong.  This might hurt blizz more than I'd hoped.
---
Am I the one acting like I’m standing up for human rights because I deleted an app on my phone?  Lol
---
I've got a pretty decent one or else I wouldn't have posed that 'hypothetical' for people. ;)
---
Nevermind, as soon as it changed phase the HP reset to 200.
---
I don’t even have the option to do it any other way, which is irritating.
---
Entirely possible
---
I'm for the Hong Kong thing, and I'm of course pissed at Blizzard for their actions. 
---
However, the hearthstone subreddit today has been filled with nothing but "I played since X and spent $X, but today I quit" 
---
Maybe I should of just posted that meme where the guy just says "I'm quitting HS" and the next panel is a million upvotes.
---
Definitely delete worthy.
---
&gt; but at this point almost every company will be in big with China
---
You forgot many Japanese and Korean companies that will always be banned in China.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/MWpbFId](https://imgur.com/a/MWpbFId)  Golden Elise, time for my golden Maly Druid deck!
---
So what? That is nothing compared to what is happening in HK.
---
Respect
---
Use the button on your left at the collection and choose featured cards, it should be sparkling. Seenif you can use the cards there to add to your deck
---
Again, you quite obviously have never known or spoken to someone from China
---
i don't think it's as simple as "you signed the contract, so fuck you" -- it's not like a contract requiring a player give up their firstborn son to the company would be enforceable, signed or not
---
How? Every deck seems to have several board wipes these days and can easily generate half a deck to top themselves off. 
---
I'm playing Tempo Rogue as it was the only thing I could afford and the only reason I win is thanks to RNG from the cards I generate most the time.
---
Ahhh, beautiful. More projection from a moron like you. It's truly a sight to see.
---
You could argue those are mostly self caused due to extraordinary amounts of debt, or something like that, but work still remains one of the best ways for people to rise out of poverty, globally.
---
Sure, abuse cases exist everywhere, but even poor wages are better than no wages.
---
You guys are awesome!
---
Blizzard who?
---
I know I would make the same decision if I was sitting on the Bliz board. The moment it happened they were put in a crap place. Hard to have something as big as Hearthstone and not break a few eggs along the way.
---
Oh I understand that. If capitalism were software I'd say that while it's got some nice features, it's also got some bugs that we as a society need to get figured out
---
&gt; Thanks for point out my typo
---
Is that supposed to be a joke? oof.
---
see your wrong,  these statements dont offend any of blizzards audience. They are offensive only to those in power in china, and those committing human rights  crimes.  Your suggesting that some amount of Chinese hearthstone players agree with whats happening in Hong Kong. You think its a political view. I think its appeasing a dictator to gain favor. Thats why people are mad. This has nothing to do with political views.
---
Actually I looked it up, you can only view the vault chest in game when it is full and ready to open.
---
Here follow this; https://magicarena.fandom.com/wiki/Vault
---
Nah
---
Those values were written by idealistic kids who really meant it at the time, but have since grown up and managed to get the fuck out of there. Over the past year we have discovered exactly why they are all leaving.
---
There are many f2p games out there and even being an f2p player is a resource for the company. Quitting is the best.
---
Good luck ignoring their advertisers when they spam the front page daily in disguised-vertisements. Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox (now Disney) are the two worst corporate offenders on reddit for social media manipulation through the use of meme, content creation artists and vote manipulation.
---
There is no regulation in this area to protect people from deceptive advertising so of course Reddit as a company is cashing in while it can.
---
That's an interpretation, but there are others suffering because of their status quo and someone that felt it (or witnessed) his people condition and speak his support for those people isn't something you have to extract the worse of it, like, I get what you're saying but the proportions are just too much to use the rule at China's favor and of course a way to not make Blizzard lose his big $$$ from China.
---
We know you can get arguments for both sides and be more considerate for the HK player in the end, it just that money worth more for them, simple as that. It was still a discretionary move and they chosed money instead of people, let's make this clear.
---
due respect, the issue of human freedom and government censorship is much more important than the fine print in any platform rules.
---
BTW, hong kong is already liberated. They're trying to keep it that way
---
Damn, I give the crown of the biggest spender to you my friend. 
---
Best now quit though before the riots come for you.
---
Well it's just for a limited time, it's a good move for newer players who never had to suffer against these cards. It'll build some character for them.
---
Bunch of people who has nothing to do with HK or China, or have never been in China or HK, raging over something they have only seen the part of propaganda that some people post on reddit. I can't even bother to take you seriously.
---
So glad I never preordered in the first place. Was really looking forward to it, but... I can't support a company like that.
---
Why? Because I wont quit something I have enjoyed for 12+ years and a company that I have played their games for 20+ years?
---
You do you but I wont quit until Im bored
---
You actually reply that to everyone who posts stuff you don't like. it's pretty pathetic, and a bit sad
---
So nothing for those children in cages from you. Got it. Looks like you're virtue signalling as hard as anyone else in here.
---
Try Shadowverse or maybe even Underlords!
---
You are right. But people got the flow and are overreacting. So better put some helmet.
---
I think things will calm down in day or two.
---
Magic isn't better. Their devs pull Blizzard shit all the time, they are just made to comply with the backlash by their financial office every time.
---
I mean there's definitely more than just that one reason:
---
* don't want to set precedent for allowing political shout outs on future broadcasts
---
* remain neutral by not allowing political discussion
---
* follow tournament rules
---
I agree. He receive consequences and that’s that. I don’t think blizzard needs to be burned at the stake for it.
---
ooohhh you're such a brave pussy here on reddit
---
you think evertything spiral around you dont you, classic teeneger...
---
well guess what, you grow up and you get a family and you will not risk your pussy life to get into problems with the government
---
thats what it is.. we are pawns
---
you dont change a dick with this Blizzard hate, cause Blizzard dont want to play any role in this fight and rather be defensive as any company would be to get  along with any country to not get banned or fined
---
as I said bring this problem to other - more relevant authorities, dont expect Blizzard join your fight, CAUSE ITS NONE OF THEIR BUSSINESS
---
Not every point of view is worth considering or empathizing with
---
You say that as if this isn't one of the most egregious things they've done. It is.
---
Yeah nah that sounds like a butthurt move.
---
It's kinda sad seeing someone try so hard to shame people into inaction.
---
This is getting so much attention, but the FridaysforFuture stuff / climatechange is forgotten before the end of the day. This makes me sad
---
&gt; According to the company’s most recent financial data, from June 2019, the entire Asia-Pacific region makes up [a scant 12 percent](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial) of its revenue
---
[Here's my source.](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung) Pretty sure the 70/30 figure was pulled from their anus.
---
Yeah the “clearly they fucked up because look at all the pissed off people” argument is stupid.
---
Most people are utterly fucking stupid and will hop on any bandwagon they see gaining enough traction, without a second thought.
---
If all the parts are Chinese knockoffs
---
We I'm hardly a full blown Communist. But sure dude.
---
I have no idea whats happening but i decided long ago that im not giving money to shit company like blizzard.
---
I made an account via a referral link that was in this thread, but I can't login to play the game. Am I missing something?
---
China controls all of its markets and all of its media. China will alway put pressure any companies opperating in China (including Bliz) to censor anything it deems a threat to its control. If Blizzard did not comply China's demands, their control is such that they would ban, fine or heavily tax Blizzard util they did something about it.
---
What business is it if yours?
---
you called someone a paid shill and said that nothing they post would change your mind
---
They can try to close down and censor what they like here but what can they do during Blizzcon? That's where we can't be ignored.
---
Suck suck suck suck sucky.
---
I will certainly not buy any stuff anymore, but i wonder how much Blizzard would actually lose if noone in eu and na bought anything, since i heard the playerbase in China is like 3-4 times as big as here in eu, and eu is already twice as big as na.
---
But then again i read Tesnednt (or how that Chinese Company is called ) hold only 5% of Activison..
---
You are kidding yourself if you think Blizzard would of given as harsh a punishment in any other situation.
---
The punishment was outrageous
---
You are shit at making points then. Are you saying blizzard is violating human rights or what? I’ve been taking about how dumb it is that people are mad about this and you have been trying to say that I should care about human rights or some shit which obviously I do and I detest the Chinese government I just don’t see how blizzard standing up to them would do absolutely fucking anything.
---
No, I recently used the #cheetohitler on Twitter so obviously I’m making a difference
---
No, this is driven by the people too, look at the social media posts making the rounds. Nationalism is encouraged by the government and China has a billion internet users.
---
fcuk blizzard
---
The low quality of these portraits is more proof that Blizzard have lost their way?
---
Yup this is a rough way to say goodbye to something I’ve enjoyed for 5 years of my life but oh well. I guess some things just end
---
Hey Lok1tos, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

Tencent a Chinese company who owns a part of Epic Games has also pumped millions into reddit so I can't say I am surprised that a post like that would be removed. Most things pro Hong Kong will get removed sooner or later.

Very powerful display of heroism. This reminds me of the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute.

You should also throw all your nikes,phones and most of your electronics too because they are all made in china. Who am I kidding you probably smashed your phone after posting this.
---
I mean storytelling in videogames, that is the quality of the writing, character depth, the way the dialogue flows (more naturally or in an artificial, expository way).
---
The things that can make videogame storytelling different then other media are indeed fantastic, but my personal experience was that I rarely found the writing to be on par with the mechanics. I comes down to the fact that in just about any medium the thing I care about the most are fleshed out characters.
---
When it comes to *Thronebreaker* the mechanics are nothing special (branching dialogue options with short-term and long-term effects) but the care in which those options and their consequences arise and develop made me really invested in everything, which is not something you would expect from a card game PvE adventure.
---
As a side note I also thoroughly enjoyed the art style, including the music. Here's an example:

&gt; I'm not wrong though, 95%+ of people who say they'll quit over this will either come back or were just looking for an excuse to quit.

**1968 Olympics Black Power salute**
---
During their medal ceremony in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City on October 16, 1968, African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a black-gloved fist during the playing of the US national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner". While on the podium, Smith and Carlos, who had won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200-meter running event of the 1968 Summer Olympics, turned to face the US flag and then kept their hands raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human-rights badges on their jackets.
---
In his autobiography, Silent Gesture, Smith stated that the gesture was not a "Black Power" salute but rather a "human rights" salute.

I guess I'm playing some Gods Unchained tonight.  I'm stoked on it.
---
Dang dude, I'm your age and almost cancelled my Classic sub too, but that’s just because in the heat of that moment I didn’t immediately realize that supporting China opression and banning a player for tournament rules violation are two different things, no matter how much your emotions may incline you to think otherwise.
---
All you quitters really need to ask yourself this:
---
Had it been another player, shouting e.g. “Long live Xi Jinping* the enlightened leader and may he crush all his opponents!!1111”, would Blizz have done the same?
---
I pondered this question and came to the conclusion that there is no rational (read: based on facts) reason that I can see why they wouldn’t. And that I will only be rightfully offended, lose my trust and quit AFTER such a thing actually happens.
---
Nah, what you are doing is a pretty low had hominem, because you thought pointing out me being on thedonald was a good burn.   
---
But it really just made you look like a petty NPC full of prejudice that thought he could use wrongthink against others :D  
---
How truly sad and pathetic.
---
I also don't exactly trust someone who sees no problem with *slavery* to believe in honesty when they tell me they aren't using slaves anymore.
---
&gt; The mods ~~there~~ are just shills
---
I'm shocked
---
blizzard won't miss ,they have your money.
---
They ban one person to avoid having hundreds of millions of people lose access to games they have spent money and time on. How is that not caring for your customers?
---
That’s absolutely fab! :D I hope more people pick up policies like that.
---
they can stop distributing games in china, blizzard could be completly blocked in china and thats a huge revenue cut. Tencent own 5% of blizzard. Hardly enough to bring them down. Losing the largest population as a market is something every company wants to try and avoid.
---
Bought both new HS bundles today.
---
Like i am dying to open and play the game but there is people who are really dying out there and i will stop my addiction until something is done from Blizzard.
---
Just the push I needed to actually delete hearthstone
---
I've been playing since 1998, and I'm still going to be playing.
---
But she still has the right to post it in her instagram.
---
So we have the right to protest here, even if it doesnt matter.
---
They don't see them as their people tho, that's the issue. "Their" people are the ones who support the chinease govenment without question - anyone else is a social terrorist.
---
75 people showed up at the area 51 event, after 2milion people rsvp'ed online.
---
I feel that the percentage will be the same for this outrage, as well...

It also rested on having to win to have the biggest impact.  Well played, Ng Wai Chung!   (Heroes need to have their names remembered.)

How about I ignore politics and just enjoy the things I find fun.

Harmless speech? He was wearing a gas mask. Isn't it pretty clear it was a political message?

I legit don't know how is it possible for a company to change (or at least make this change public) for the worse so quickly after such long years of good memories.
---
The complete and utter bullshit that was the Diablo fiasco last Blizzcon, the literal death of Heroes of the Storm, the cash-grab that Hearthstone became, Overwatch's event milking and repeated, uninteresting gamedevs, no new modes, no history progression, one or two comics and not a single cinematic since last Blizzcon.
---
WoW Classic was such a breath of fresh air, but I feel we're going down so fast it's soon gonna be affected as well.
---
The old Blizzard would be ashamed of what the company would become. Today's Blizzard is a fucking disgrace to gaming. I don't know if this is entirely Activision's fault, if it's something that came before or if things were always like this, but never out in the open, but damn it's sad to see two decades of games that shaped my tastes and brought me so many pleasant memories have everything ruined in the span of 2 years.
---
Fuck you, Blizzard.
---
I'm saying that Blizzard would ban him for saying "fuck Hong Kong" too. People would praise Blizzard if they banned a person for supporting China, though it would be them upholding the same rule.
---
Come on... at least keep it SOMEWHAT focused on Hearthstone... 
---
What police brutality?  It's the police's job to maintain order.  What do you expect them to do against a violent mob.  You think other HK citizens tolerate these idiots rioting in the streets?  
---
They do vote but unfortunately HK is a speck of dust compared to all of China so tough cookies.
---
Hello!   How dumb are you?  Rioting, destroying property, beating up people is illegal
---
Who the hell are you to comment from your moms basement half the world away.  I have few close friends who lives in HK w their families.  Unlike these stupid kids they actually have jobs and want stability and peace
---
This sentiment: 
---
&gt; You're not wrong. What he said should be lauded in every context. 
---
Conflicts with this one:
---
&gt;There is much more nuance to this situation than simply:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;&gt;There is no wrong time or place to express support for basic Human Rights and Democracy.
---
A great philosopher once said, "don't trust China. China is asshole!" More truth has never been spoken
---
Im sue you can survive one day without hearthstone memes, my man.
---
If not, then sorry that your life is so perfect this is your biggest problem ever.
---
Choosing to play under a flag is choosing to represent it, and have it represent you. The original is, indeed, comparing endorsement of HK to endorsement of the Confederacy, and by extension the cause for which they've each been, or are, in the spotlight. 
---
&gt; Who called that unappreciated facts?
---
&gt; Turns out facts are not appreciated in a discussion on people's emotions.
---
If you were referring purely to his first sentence, then I suppose you weren't. But even in that case, were you just ignoring the inherently loaded comparison that made up the other half of his comment? Why pass over mention of the Confederacy and then get set off by a comparison to abolitionists?
---
Nice meme bro
---
That's right you beta
---
how about you first use correct english before posting a copy pasta
---
And i also have the right to say i don't give a shit about it on a subreddit inteded for a fucking video game by that logic so stop arguing with me and leave me be
---
you forgot the wait one week until the bandwagon stops step
---
That's why we can't have nice things.
---
These are bad and Blizzard should feel bad. My only consolation is that I won't ever be seeing them in game.
---
Terrible meme
---
Defeat by a thousand papercuts. Let it all happen.
---
My guy!  I'm from Oregon and am extremely proud of Senator Wyden.
---
What are you hippies crying about now?
---
Maybe I'm old school, but "basic human rights" kind of fly out the window when your population riots and tries to murder your police force. I'm sure at least half of you aren't borderline retarded, but for those that are let me try to explain; when a government tries to set up a way to legally extradite murderers fleeing to other countries, you probably shouldn't try to molotov people in anger because of boogieman "what-ifs".

Lobosjr (well known Soulsborne and Sekiro streamer) streams WoW from time to time, he was asked about the issue by his chat today but said he didn't know all of the details, etc. I only saw a bit of it but got the impression he cut the issue short because things were starting to get a bit angsty in chat. It'll be somewhere in this stream if anyone wants to find it:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/491869845
---
Why are people upvoting these comments? Hong Kong belonged to China and will belong to China. The protest is only going to lead to casualties and nothing will change.
---
Do you have a job? Do you consume any sort of goods/products?
---
If the answer to either of those is yes then your tax dollars go towards supporting the US government, and by extension, it's continuing trade with China.
---
So instead of waiting on streamers to sacrifice their livelihoods why don't you go "rise up" by removing yourself from the taxable ecosystem.
---
I actually hope the mods don’t for this. I get how much it must suck for people that don’t care about any of this, although to be fair at least some part of what’s happening there should give you some concern, but if they were all kept to one thread I don’t think it would attempt to send as much of a message. 
---
We know people like Iskar checks this sub every day, and I’m sure more Blizzard people do, white this obviously was not their decision, they do need to see the consequences if for anything to report it back to their bosses. Will they care? Probably not, but it’s something.
---
To be fair, Blizz has a lot more to lose by losing the Chinese market than the NBA does. Like, a LOT more
---
It's probably more likely that they didn't sign up to deal with this level of shit for free and are getting some serious pressure they don't want to deal with so are trying to pass the buck to mods of other subs to deal with. I'm sure some are doing it purposefully, but I'd sooner blame "I'm not dealing with this headache today" than a concerted effort by the mods themselves on China/Blizzards behalf. Again though, that would be due to pressure from these groups.
---
:( why?
---
Again, you’re reading out blizzards terms after I stated how that’s pretty irrelevant.
---
It should be pretty clear to you why revolutionaries throughout history have propagandized the youth and weaponized them to obtain power. 
---
This has been bizarre to observe.
---
On what ground?
---
I just cba for all this serious bullshit man
---
Mods of that subreddit should be ashamed
---
Bro, as an attorney, believe me, I am familiar with contracts and rules and why people put clauses like this into a contract. 
---
Again, if you don’t think this was a company making an example out of somebody, then you are being so unreasonable or so naive that either way it’s a conversation ender.
---
But let's face the fact at the end of the day,  America is up to our eyeballs in debt to... that's right China.  Now i love that we have our politicians speaking out against this but i harbor little belief that anything will happen to blizzard at all because of this.  Our government in America cares more about the corporations and their money than it's people already, so I'm sure once some money gets pumped into the right hands Washington is going to move on to the next public outrage and this will be swept under the rug just like everything else.
---

im sure you're not the only young person here. so "im 16" isnt exactly a valid argument. your voice is still a voice and you're plenty old enough to have your own opinion on matters such as this
---
Have you ever stopped and considered that *the entire point* is to be seen, en masse?
---
I think this guys a total ass hat but really no one has been murdered? I call total bullshit on that, they cut a fucking girls eye out in the middle of the street, if you think bodies aren’t being burned/thrown into the ocean you’re crazy. People have definitely died.

There gonna be tons more because people want attention sadly

i want to enjoy a game i like, doesn't matter if the conpanny that made the game has made a terrible desicion that everyone including me disagrees with, i just want ot play the game , ican't stop you from quitting but just wanted to let you know that blizzrd probally doesn't care and the better thing do to is to just not bother and continue enjoyning the game , i don't support what blizzard did but then again i'm a f2p player.
---
No thanks
---
I just answered your question.
---
Here's what Kripp had to say:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df3err/kripps_reply_to_the_blitzchung_incident/
---
yea im not reading that wall, its at its heart a joke...nothing that long is worth saying about a joke, meaning your ranting and tangenting and i could not be arsed
---
Ok.
---
Why they did it is because they want money from Chinese customers. And they are maintaining access to these customers at the expense of free expression among players and employees. Isn't that worthy of our outrage?
---
One deleted his account so at least it hit one of em
---
FYI  that means you do care...at least a little
---
Don't worry. Basic totems probably just made some controversial statements about Xi Jinping.
---
That's pointless until you answer what would YOU do? That's why I keep you pestering. 
---
I don't give a damn about blitzchung nor any other player, streamer whatever. They all agreed to respect the rules of blizzard. Dude did not do that, he put blizzard in a very shitty situation. He faced the consequences. That's all. You want blizzard and streamers to take the moral high ground. They don't want to. And it's their legitimate choice whether you like it or not.
---
blizzard sucks
---
&gt; It’s Tianamen Square all over again
---
not a single person has died in these protests
---
It is Chinas turn to take control of Asia. It is a cycle.
---
They also harvest organs from the fulon gong.
---
Fuck China.
---
I don't think people right now want to hear arguments about how Blizzard didn't have a choice, or if Blizzard would go bankrupt tomorrow if China banned them.
---
People aren't gonna forgive a major corporation for getting themselves into that kind of situation.
---
Whatabautism at its finest.
---
Also, the guy said what he said in response to this shit. Not just randomly do it. Are you aware in what thread you are?
---
I’d appreciate an intelligent response, as opposed to something brainless and an attempt to personally attack me. Please try again?
---
Btw how does the game plan on adjusting to ethereum 2.0?
---
\*honk honk\*
---
The. Kid. Violated. His. Contract. Stop. Blaming Blizzard. For. This.
---
They did what they were supposed to do when someone representing their brand violates their contract. They are not trying to scilence his message. They are trying to protect their company. They know the message is out there. They know the clip was recorded. They know they cant cover it up. They are not stupid. If anything this draws more attention to it. Blizzard is literally helping spread the message by handling it so poorly. This hate mongering in our society needs to end. I seriously doubt any single individual working for or with blizzard supports what the Chinese government is doing. They literally have to follow protocal when something like this happenes.
---
NOTE EVERYONE!  
---
There are two account creations on our website.
---
One is for creating an Immutable account and will let you login to the site and game.  
---
The other, the one in the big white box labelled Portis, is to create an ethereum wallet. You DO NOT need to do this until you plan on buying cards and there are other options.  
---
If you are having problems logging in please make sure you have made an Immutable account and NOT just a Portis Wallet. We will be addressing this soon for now please note the difference!

I’m so thankful people like you exist. You deserve the 50k upvotes and awards.
---
It saddens me that I only found 2-3 posts here that try to be rational and see both sides of the story. You are perfectly right. This is not a US National situation. It is not the job of Blizzard and companies in general to participate in foreign politics only because some people like that.
---
I feel many people think Blizzard act out of pure evil. It’s sad they don’t inform themselves about the situation and that they don’t know that Blizzard is not independent and that Activision has a say in these things.
---
Really thank you though. Great post.
---
Breaking news: Blizzard announcing bankruptcy
---
They GOT money, but will get no more. It's much easier for a company to get money from current customers vs trying to aquire new ones. If you don't think customers choosing to no longer buy products from a company doesn't hurt them, I can assure you, it does.
---
Social media.  Create a Facebook page and get people involved to do something.  It's not that hard at all.  At 15 I was protesting for Mexican farmer rights, my age didn't stop me from organizing and helping where I could.
---
I think I this is the crux of it. He did it to get support, because there is no personal gain for himself. In fact it is probably dangerous if he has to go back or is still in the Area.
---
&gt;The mods here at /r/hearthstone have been SUPER CHILL about it
---
Objectively true.
---
Not going when you already bought the ticket is pretty irrelevant, you do more harm if you hold up any kind of anti-Blizzard or anti-China stuff.
---
I would agree that buying a ticket now would be terrible though (at least without very good reason).
---
I just bought five packs for each of the years you played
---
But it’s true though!
---
Bruh... his city is under an active social upheaval and he had a minute to make a rally cry for his fucking freedom. How short sighted are you to suggest, "Whelp, that was of poor class of him, wasn't it? Chip chip, better grab some more tea!"
---
How entitled are you to not have to worry about being shot for being out of curfew? Have a clean trip to the store for food? Not being targeted for **speaking your mind, freely?**
---
Just as an update, the app is now sitting at 4.0 on the App Store. Speaking from a software developers perspective, this change, especially in the short time since this news broke, is quite significant. Speak the only language they understand. Vote with your wallet.
---
Ah yes I've seen that and I would agree it certainly is deserved if that translation says what the comment says it says
---
They are going to keep quiet most likely.
---
Are you talking about Blizzard or the community? Because community is just responsing on Blizzard disgusting political involvement. I've never ever in my whole life seen Blizzard getting fired THIS much, it has surpassed Diablo Mobile disaster..... People in Hongkong are in revolution and Blizzard is siding with a government who are abusive and treating non traditional Chinese people worse than animals.
---
Enjoy the ride.... This is going to last a while (Blizzcon, next HS expansion etc)
---
I don’t think it should but reality is, that IS how it works. I didn’t make the fuckin rules
---
It seems like you're offended over nothing though. And no one's offended
---
Here is the response I got:
---
Hello there Zack!
---
Specialist Game Master Pelzzakka here, I understand that you were looking to get a refund on all of your Hearthstone, Call of Duty, and Overwatch purchases on your account.
---
While those purchases are not meant to be refunded we do like to help out our players whenever we can. So I took a look over your account in the hopes that we could make an exception. Sadly it was not eligible for a refund as those games were purchased too long ago and have had too much progress made on them. .
---
I hope the reset of your day is a good one.
---
Click Here to review and resolve your ticket. If you continue to experience issues, you can respond to your ticket with additional information.

If you do not resolve the ticket or provide an additional response within one week, we will resolve the ticket automatically and you'll receive a final update via email.

Blizzard Support
---
Nothing, don’t harass people!
---
Do you own...a SINGLE product by a single company on earth? Congratulations, you support whatever human rights that company violated, and nearly every single company is guilty of human rights violation. See? That sound like a batshit insane argument to you? Because that’s the argument you just made.
---
Uninstalling things you've paid for is like buying something and throwing it out while new
---
If you don't want to give them money, that's easy to do, when new products are released don't buy them
---
You've already paid for these products, uninstalling them doesn't accomplish anything
---
Doesn't this disregard overlap?
---
&gt;OK then cynical internet tough guy, other than doing personal boycotts and making an effort to explain to others WHAT ELSE should we be doing.  
---
Practicing what you preach.  
---
Posting on reddit is one thing but honestly no one cares what you say you're going to do to one company vs what you actually do in regards to every other company that supports the Chinese government either directly or indirectly.  
---
Talk is cheap.
---
I'm just disappointed with blizzard all together. They really only care about money
---
Man, I seriously wish CoD wasn't made by Activision right now, I had some great fun with that game. But eh, what can you do honestly.
---
"Socioeconomic sparring" with China - which is what will ultimately limit or hasten China's rise to power - seems to me to be of massive, global importance, even if it may not be as photogenic as a political protest.
---
Lmao good luck with this... Also
---
That rule is basically, say any word or move your body in any way we "don't like" and we can deny you all prizing and defame you. Literally sickening.
---
The problem isn’t that they let the player go due to his political beliefs, it’s that Blizzard rushes to defend China due to their market as quickly as possible in the face of human rights violations. 
---
If a player ranted about how much they hated Trump,  Blizzard would have just as much right to drop them from Grandmasters. The problem is their response (particularly the Chinese version) proves that the primary motive of the banning was for Blizzard to excuse themselves from being banned from Chinese markets.
---
After years of Blizzard touting inclusivity and “Every Voice Mattering”  they clearly care about money more than human rights and democracy.
---
I'm accessing and commenting on not a member, just a lurker.
---
You spent $500+ today? Wow.
---
They accepted being blackmailed instead of forfeiting profit in a show of support for human rights. By doing so they are simply reinforcing that money&gt;people's lives. If it cost them their company to not have Chinese money, they will have *done the right thing*.
---
I'm finding hard to believe that all these people that are saying "I won't give them another cent!" are saying the truth. If you're already someone that spend money in these games, you're probably gonna keep going, sure you may stop for a week or two, but you're gonna come back. Specially WoW players.
---
You know that, I know that, Activision-Blizzard knows that.
---
Someone really should deface that plaque with spraypaint or something
---
same, since beta, over $600+, uninstalled.  closed account today.  
---
glad so many others are!

No

"we" aren't doing anything.

---
Good point- I wonder what Blizzard's reaction will be/how they handle these tweets
---
Yup, always the troll DocSpock. You never change.
---
Why are Blizzard cowards for censoring this guy (to protect their livelihood), but streamers who have nothing to say because they're scared of losing their livelihood are totally fine?
---
I quit Hearthstone while back. As a Cantonese American, I am mad how Blizzard values money moreover Human rights. This is very sickening to hear
---
Public embarrassment of Blizzard is almost as good as you having money.
---
You seem surprised by this sort of hypocritical behavior?  I'm not.
---
Sorry, which is it? "No one is offended," or "it seems like I'm offended?"
---
No.
---
you're no one
---
Buddy I never once said this guy wasn’t allowed to defend his freedoms , my point was he breached a contract and used blizzard as a platform to express his views while he was binded to a contract that stated otherwise. He could have done what he did any other way and kept his job and money. Sadly that’s the world we live in l but there is a time and place for everything and doing it on the job (if u wanna consider that a job) was probably not the best option.
---
Forcing your opinion on the streamer is exactly what you are supposed to be against. This post shows perfectly what is wrong with all this reddit uproar.
---
Yes I completely agree with you on that, but they would lose a lot more not conforming to China than us boycotting them, also what blitzchung did is against the rules and while the punishment was harsh, a hearthstone tournament isn't really the place to bring up such topics, it undermines the point he was trying to make.
---
Or gold farmers
---
Is that a China sponsored comment?
---
Done. Other things blizzard has done were making me want to refund but I didn't know how and this was more than a bit of a reason to take it back. Fuck this fake virtue signaling company. Blizzard is dead.
---
Nice edit.
---
This man is a hero, he knew exactly what would happen to him but he knew he had to stand up for his cause anyway
---
Activision-Blizzard is a single entity and they fucked up together.
---
You made me spit my drink dude! hahahaha are you serious? hahahaha
---
And the rest of reddit too. 
---
In a week or two things will have cooled down.
---
I think most people know what is going on. We have blizzard siding with Chinazis because they pay them money. Simple as that.
---
It will reflect on their internal subscriber numbers and reduce the chance of me buying more card packs or loot boxes to zero. Not sure why I'm arguing with you, not doing this for you.
---
Done :)
---
It's makiny considerable rounds.  Senator Marco Rubio has already gone on record.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/bjw535/blizzards-hong-kong-screw-up-is-officially-an-international-incident
---
Deleted my bnet account too motherfucker
---
Or do what I did, I completely stopped playing all blizzard games around a year ago due to hearthstone issues.
---
I've been playing since starcraft, wc3 roc and diablo 1 religiously. I even put around 100$ an expansion in for hearthstone for pretty golden decks. Now they get nothing from me
---
You are presenting a false dilemma. We can both criticize Blizzard *and* oppose China. Many people already do. But of course the conversation here is about Blizzard kowtowing to an authoritarian regime, rather than the regime itself; this is a subreddit about a Blizzard game, not geopolitics.
---
Great point
---
[hehe](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/763/07B89120-B48D-45FB-AF1D-49AF6CD16790.jpeg)
---
History's shown when people put a lot more on the line than canceling their accounts and making grandiose posts on Reddit, then they effect change.
---
Good for you
---
There's no way for them to "win". You can't please everyone. However, if China can exercise such influence over Blizzard, then there is no reason we westerners who make up most of blizzard's customer base shouldn't do so as well.
---
That’s not the point tho, he’s one of many that won’t be spending money anymore. Alone he’s not a big deal but together that’s a big dent.
---
Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!
---
Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened!
---
 Both the "Think Globally" and "Every Voice Matters" values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. 
---
These have been covered at the entrance with paper/tape! Check twitter I somehow cannot post the name of the guy or it will not let me post.
---
They did not do it on gm livestream though did they? They did it on their own time.
---
This is actually the most accurate comment. 
---
In mergers and acquisitions the past ten- fifteen years has been called, “the great consolidation” and it is ONLY for profit.
---
You have now entered mom's Facebook page.
---
He wont disappear unless he goes to China. He will be safe in Taiwan.
---
dont worry, chinese players gladly cover lost players from todays drama
---
Well that is an opinion answer. I don't think he ever intended to "destroy Blizzard" nor do I think he did. Blizzard could have handled this situation much better as well.
---
I will say that there's so much at stake with HK that it needs all the awareness possible. China was able to get away with so much over the decades by keeping to the "shadows" and people staying silent. They are finding it much tougher nowadays with the global connectivity.
---
