This is super useful
---
---
---
also it looks like an gurabashi arena with the opening just how the circle is on it
---
If there's a pack you haven't opened yet then do so. You have a guaranteed legendary on the first 10 packs of each expansion(once you open a legendary just stop buying from that and go to the next one).
---
Usually buying from the last expansions is the best because that's what you are gonna keep for more time. Kft, kobolds and Ungoro are rotating to wild on April. Witchwood, boomsday and rastakhan are staying until april 2020. Keep that in mind.
---
Also...this is something I did, but you might not like. Since tavern brawl and some quests will give you classic packs,  theres not that much point on buying them, since you will eventually have all you need from them. If you are missing key cards from that you might want to buy/craft anyways. But that's all on you.
---
Look up the hidden achievements that give you gold so you can get more packs, try to always have 2 quests ready so that when you get a new one you can reroll the "worse" one. This will help you with getting more gold. You dont care about 50 gold quests, anything is better that those, try not to complete them so you can reroll them.

OP didnt say that a player needs a full collection. He just stated some statistics and did the math. Just a nice statistic to know
---
welcome to reddit, home of "be a snarky butthole so other snarky butthole lurkers will snicker and lick your snarky butthole with upvotes, because this is more important than actual content."
---
&gt; It interacts very much with your opponent's board.
---
Clearing minion after minion isn't interaction - you might find it fun but it's not interactive in the slightest.  Completely not fun and not at all interactive for the opponent either.  
---
&gt;t has a clean yet difficult win condition  
---
Difficult? Hardly. It mostly comes down to luck and just not playing incredibly stupidly. 
---
&gt; It's not fun, nor is it interactive with your opponent's.  
---
No it's not, yet not as bad as these OTK decks.
---
Nope. Chances of player A getting a weapon = 1, chances of player B getting the same weapon as player A = 1/n regardless of which weapon player A gets.
---
That was kind of interesting and enjoyable, but I just don't think I like Trump that much. Thanks for the video, though!

This isn't Hakkar druid, it's M'thun druid.
---
That's something people should know even without any real in-depth math being done. It's quite easy to make rough estimates and see that you would need at least twice as much gold to get everything as a f2p player.
---
I think it's okay if f2p player can't get a full collection, but the current stat isn't okay. The math done is about the absolute maximum a player can get, if they grind on average 60 games a day. Assuming a match lasts 5 minutes (they last more), that's 300 minutes per day or 5 hours of playing Hearthstone. But lets be honest, you will average around 10 minute a game because you will find 20 minutes long matches and idiots roping intentionally or people being AFK, the delay between each match, changing something in your deck, you being AFK, eating something, going to the toilet. So that's 10 hours of playing Hearthstone just to get 100g a day or 100 dust. Worst job ever!
---
The f2p economy should be changed so that the average player can't get a full collection and if someone is actually a lunatic and wants to play the game for 10 hours a day (without being a streamer), then by all means, let that person get everything for free. I think they did earn it.
---
However, the second big issue with this math are the paying customer. The fact that you can grind all day long and pay at least $50 per expansion and still not have everything, now that's beyond bullshit. That's the real scumbag business model of the game and why I completely stopped paying.
---
But, the VALUE
---
Thanks, I appreciate the honesty.  I recently made a Zoolock deck and that has won me more games than I've won in the past...but even I've lost like four games in a row and the stress was still too much.
---
Apologies for the whinging.  I know it's a bit much, but I'm the kind of person that has so much internal conflict that the best way for me to feel any relief of any kind is to vent it out in writing or speaking.  I can't just keep it to myself, because that stress just adds to the conflict and tears me apart from the inside, causing me to think irrationally and have fits of rage, so I tend to vent out as much as I can if I ever feel this way.  Looking back on what I've written, I might've been withholding a shit-ton of stress.
---
I’ve just never seen a quest mage before and thought it was unique but I am mistaken

---
You have no clue of the horrors he's commited
---
Very clunky. In drafting it was between him, Dragon Caller Alana, and Lunas Pocket Galaxy so I chose him since none were that great.
---
I played him in two or three games, and he got value out. The problem was he typically didn't do anything the turn I played him and most of the other cards I had in my hand did, so I would opt for those instead.
---
No, that's THAT bad.
---
Psychic scream go
---
&gt;In my opinion, the problem is that people who are more complacent or who accept the bare minimum aren't openly criticized.
---
I don't think this is necessary.  We don't need to have a culture of shaming people who put money into the game.  The people on reddit are a tiny minority of the overall playerbase.  Some of the more dedicated players, and maybe the players most likely to spend some/spend the most.  But ultimately, if you convince one redditor not to spend money, that's a drop in the bucket.  A billion-dollar game flatly does not care about individual consumers.
---
Will I ever spend a cent on Hearthstone again?  Unlikely, unless there are large shifts in design.  The game is, for lack of a better word, too greedy for me.  Spending money doesn't feel like it gets me anything worthwhile, and unlike other f2p titles that I play, I don't have any good will built up towards the developers.  Blizzard lost my good will a long time ago.
---
Regardless, it's not as if it is objectively true that Hearthstone is a bad game or anything.  It can't be objectively true because it is a subjective matter.  So, it is perfectly reasonable for people to enjoy the game as it is, even if a vocal subset of the playerbase is very unhappy with how it is being developed.
---
In the meantime, I personally don't feel like the disgruntled part of the playerbase is being silenced.  I commonly see posts on this sub about people who have switched to MTGA and don't really play HS anymore, and those posts get upvoted.  The posts that get downvoted are the ones that are out of place or vitriolic.  Less-extreme expressions of dissatisfaction with the game tend to get upvotes in my experience.
---
For now, I have a good feeling this deck type will be the new cancer next expansion.
---
Alas, he *was* in chaarge.
---
Rest in Patches
---
&gt;We don't need to have a culture of shaming people who put money into the game.
---
I mean overall I think you're right but anyone who's pissed at Blizzard? Absolutely. Just complaining will do nothing. People complain now and it does nothing.
---
&gt; But ultimately, if you convince one redditor not to spend money, that's a drop in the bucket.
---
The point isn't just to convince one redditor though. My proposal for anyone who dislikes Blizz, is to basically detach from anyone unwilling to not support the game. If people do this, those who want to continue paying will be sacrificing friends to keep playing their video game which I don't think is an unreasonable trade-off if they want to support something so many people consider "objectively" bad. I mean look at how many people criticize Blizzard! No-one ever says they're wrong, right? Either all the people criticizing Blizzard are wrong/what they're pointing out is subjective and it's just a massive circle-jerk that no-one who knows they're RIGHT is willing to counter), or they're RIGHT and people going against them are just ignorant/complacent. Now in terms of general opinions? There's absolutely an in-between. But in terms of like... Pragmatics? It's black and white, there is no gray here. There's either changes to the game, or there AREN'T. That's the issue here. "Agree to disagree" doesn't apply when people are preventing changes from being made.
---
&gt;Regardless, it's not as if it is objectively true that Hearthstone is a bad game or anything.
---
People aren't arguing whether the game is bad. People are arguing that the game not being updated or changed is bad. That Hearthstone is doing the bare minimum to stay afloat and is getting by because of all the casuals "blindly" buying packs. 
---
&gt;So, it is perfectly reasonable for people to enjoy the game as it is, even if a vocal subset of the playerbase is very unhappy with how it is being developed.
---
But if this is the case then it ties back into the point I made earlier. If it's subjective then more people should be meeting those who act like it is, with refutations. So many people are trashing Blizzard over what you're arguing is subjective. If Blizzard's greed is subjective then you and everyone else who feels it is should speak up. Again, if you're confident you're right, then why not try it?
---
&gt;I personally don't feel like the disgruntled part of the playerbase is being silenced.
---
I never said they were being silenced. I was saying that people who call out problems with the games can be referred to as entitled, or that people in entirely separate posts or comments counteract those with problems BY saying the game is fine. If the same number of people want the game to stay the same as those who want it to change, then Team 5 has less inclination to listen to those who want the game to stay the same than if the support for changing the game were greater. And obviously it's not 50/50 but you DO have to factor in all the people playing the game too, obviously, and what fraction of the community this subreddit makes up. 
---
&gt;Less-extreme expressions of dissatisfaction with the game tend to get upvotes in my experience 
---
It's not about these threads not getting upvotes. It's about other posts about SATISFACTION with the game getting upvotes. People saying "Yeah we're fine with the game not having more deckslots or more value for content" are not the people that those in this thread expressing their dissatisfaction, should be okay with, for the reasons I've outlined already. Nor should they be okay with these people posting about how they're satisfied with the entertainment/value ratio they get out of the game. Because again anyone saying "Blizz is greedy/only wants money" is otherwise accepting people saying "Yeah I gave these greedy people money :)"
---
So again we come to the impasse. Either Blizzard is OBJECTIVELY greedy which makes it problematic, or they're SUBJECTIVELY greedy which means the people who are upset and treating it like an inherent issue need to be shut down. But ***again*** I don't see enough people doing that. If companies being greedy is subjective then maybe people should tell those accusing them of greed to fuck off? Just a thought? Like I get to an extent you can't tell a group they're wrong but come on, at least make an ATTEMPT.
---
You really just want to stay at 12 so you force him to have all 3 cards. Not just two. You're playing draw percentages at that point.
---
Meanwhile at hunterstone 
---
*sigh* At this point I really wouldnt mind if some people in team5  lost their jobs. 
---
good trade :)
---
Said the snarky butthole.

he lost the braces and became a whole new man.

I didn't even know the card existed till I read your post.

---
One last piece of advice that i learnt from reading online after making the mistakes.
---
Dont disenchant :D let your collection grow
---
Saying "not all cheaters are obvious" is cynicism?
---
both are equaly cute,stop with the double standard
---
Thats what im thinking too lol priests have a ton to lose from their decks!
---
Me bur with brawls, ended up just crafting them since they are such a staple in Warrior
---
false
---
Someone plz provide the right probability.
---
The ugly one is less cute tho
---
I hope you can find meaning in things other than being an asshole on the internet. I've been there, and it's not worth it. 
---
&gt;&gt; I think the real problem is that people who buy every expansion and play regularly don't have access to a full collection.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This is the thing I don't get.
---
&gt;Who are these people who are OK with spending $150+ a year to not even have all of the game. That's a ton of money to get half or less of something. Every. Year. 
---
Because you don't need every card to have every tier t1 deck or have multiple meme decks.  Im missing a revenge of the wild... which I will never put in a deck,  so missing it means literally nothing to me.
---

Saying "not all cheaters are obvious" is being an asshole? Seriously? I'm not even talking about APXVoid. I'm just saying "this guy is nice so he would never cheat" is a bad argument.
---
Damn, you broke all my straw. Guess I've been thoroughly owned.
---
I almost fell out of my chair when I noticed I was still missing a classic rare wild pyromancer. After playing for four years FOR FOUR YEARS. Doing basically every quest, tavern brawl and going infinite in arena on install. The kicker it was not something I had disenchanted. Actually I'm still missing abusive sergeant since the nerf LOL
---
didn't doubt apx's integrity for a second
---
All you've done is attack me personally. Don't act like I've ignored some argument you've made.
---
The legend grind seems impossible to do for me this season because i hate hunter.

You can find it yourself if you go to your cardback collection to be honest. Even greyed you can still see them...

---
That's how mafia works.
---
me too, 100% not a coincedence. 
---
Ah, I understand what you mean now, keep ten cards so he can't togwaggle kill you. I originally thought you meant keep ten cards till you burn your own curse card. 
---
Yeah, that sort of play would only really work with rexar as other wise you generally can't play anything to pressure the druid. It might work without him but your really just letting your opponent pressure you for free, and if you have ten cards in hand he will just switch decks without you getting a ransom card, at which point without rexar he is just going to generally out value you and push you into normal fatigue.
---
Yeah, only oppressive card from LoE (and it became so a long long time afterwards) was Naga Sea Witch.
---
Whoa, care to share you deck?
---
i think it is a big deal and i think the DQ is required and fair. not harsh at all.
---
apx's story seems like a half truth, i believe he was nervous and made a mistake, but i also think he was looking to get help on bans from fr0zen. just because its a "duh kinda question" doesnt mean you can ask it
---
Because that is not actually what they want. With full collection they would get bored of the game and spend money elsewhere
---
In 2017 there were some posts that determined how many card packs you need to open for each expansion to get enough dust to craft the cards you don't have yet. If I remember correctly it was around **263.**
---
I am all about following the rules, but I do not think he should be banned or have other actions taken against him besides getting disqualified from this HCT. It is a mistake he have done accidentally, and it does not affect the game in any sort of ways. However, that being said, rules are rules, I totally agree with Blizzard to disqualify him as although the mistake is not intentional, it is still rule breaking, and he should be punished. Hope he can continue playing HS. I learnt a lot about tempo mage from him.
---
You can easily make your own! Just put all (or most of) your murloc cards in a deck and add some good drawing tools. For example Aluneth in mage decks or Divine Favor in Paladin decks.

I'm F2P and play 5-10 games per day. I use almost all of my gold on expansion release, then begin saving up for the next expansion.
---
I have all the meta decks I want (typically 50-75%) and craft cards for several meme decks too.
---
Getting *all* cards is impossible, sure, but who wants stuff like Hirelek the bat or dr. Morrigan? Most cards are complete garbage that don't have a meme deck it fits in.
---
[^(1)/[Number of Collectable Dragons in Standard Rotation]]^4

So [^(1)/24]^4 = ^(1)/331,776 chance.

So roughly 3 in a million.

Why do you think you should run Geist *now* when druid *used to* dominate? Currently it represents about 2-3% of all decks.

draw a card, deal damage

draw a card, gain armor

"Just you wait, I'm lapping milk!"

You can play meta decks, you can experiment, you can play for free, you can ignore arena, you can not spend much time playing.

Yes

dayum the thirst for internet points be very strong. well I should have the original image somewhere in my recycle bin message me whenever and I'll fish it out!
---
It is an implicit justification. You play a game this exorbitantly expensive but dismissively rationalize it as "not necessary" instead of forthright accepting that it is bullshit and should not be condoned (unless you would like to argue *that*, which would be more interesting at any rate than trying to shirk from the game's logical terminus).
---
Yeah. There are some expansions where I have barely half the expansion in dust value, and I'm good with that. Because some expansions are so bad that literally half the cards are just.. bad.
---
I'm honestly curious if people in the 90s have calculated how many MTG packs they would have to buy to get a full collection.

We now have a wild format where you can play all the cards that exist, and a standard format where you can play classic, basic, cards from this year and cards from last year (some classic cards have also been moved to to Wild in the "hall of fame" including ragnaros and Sylvanas). There are now legendary weapons, legendary spells, hero cards, [[Baku the Mooneater]] and [[Genn Greymane]]. New rules about legendaries : you are guaranteed 1 in the first 10 packs of each different set that you open, and you can never pull duplicates. The ladder has changed too you have safe floors at rank 15, 10 and 5. And no more adventure expansions, just card packs expansions. 4 years is a long time, there's obviously other stuff, but that's a tldr.

---
Huh, weird restriction to put on this card.
---
As if they were worried it would be too strong if Ancient Harbinger, in case it did survive a turn and you have a 10 mana minion in your deck, triggers an "on draw"-effect on board, which also survived.
---
A perfect 5/7
---
I never said that people playing competitively can't have fun though
---
That's 270 packs to get everything in a set, yes? Though even that figure sounds low, I want to say somebody calculated it to be close to 400 packs to get everything
---
Either way it's quite a bit more than what an FTPer can hope to acquire in the 3 months between one set and the next ... in fact for "casual" players (playing about 1 hour every day), the rule of thumb is 10 packs per week: 1 per day from daily quest + first 4 wins, plus another 3 free packs per week from getting 15 wins. 10 wins times 13 weeks between sets equals 130 packs
---
It can take fifteen to sixty terrible mythic rares in MtG or secret rares in Yugioh to pay for a decent one in either game.
---

Gold cards are the equivalent of foil cards in physical card games such as Magic: the Gathering and the Pokemon TCG. There, a lot of players do just sell them to help pay for cards they may actually want.
---
That makes sense, thanks!!
---
Looks like Arcane Dynamo.
---
For mtg however no one should open packs, you either just play draft, or buy the singles you need. 
---
Then I can recommend Shaman Murloc. Strong standard cards for it are the Murloc Quest, Ice Fishing, Primalfin Totem, Rockpool Hunter and Primalfin Lookout, all of which are rotating next expansion. At that point you can add Call in the Finishers and Everyfin is Awesome to make it a decent wild deck.
---
If you don't feel like crafting a legendary I recommend waiting until the rotation/skipping playing it in standard because I've seen versions of it without the Quest. I definitiely prefer it with it tho.
---
The other murloc decks are either niche decks in standard which I wouldn't recommend playing in wild (mage/priest) or wild decks which are missing too many cards to see play in standard (paladin).
---
You can ofc just start by crafting a good neutral murloc-core with Murloc Tidecaller, Murloc Warleader and Coldlight Seer, put these in any deck with some spells, draw and basic murlocs and call it a day.
---
Should perform decent in Standard overall, although Spell Hunter is probably not the best mu for it.

Thank you so much'

Alright, I take you point, but I still don't think that having a full collection is part of the game. That's a personal goal and should be treated as such.

**Three Kingdoms**
---
The Three Kingdoms (220–280 A.D.) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu. It started with the end of the Han dynasty and was followed by the Jin dynasty. The term "Three Kingdoms" is something of a misnomer, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed suzerainty over all China. Nevertheless, the term "Three Kingdoms" has become standard among English-speaking sinologists.

It’s rank 25. 
---
A big part of it is because a work of fiction called "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"  is considered one of the great Chinese masterpieces, and a LOT of inspiration is often drawn from it.  It's sort of comparable to Shakespeare's influence, it's that level of well known, and probably read more than Shakespeare.  
---
It offers a LOT of characters to draw on and settings and inspiration and such.  It's sort of Asian Game of Thrones.

7/4/6 | Battlecry: Shuffle a copy of your opponent's deck into your deck.  
---
How do you counter weapon removal?
---
I don't know if you saw my INWO comment elsewhere in the thread, but I once bought something called The One With Everything collection for the game (INWO is basically a Steve Jackson card game based about the Illuminati). I thought that it would be amazing to have every card in the set. 
---
I was wrong. I was very wrong. It turned out that it's actually rather boring to have access to everything. That was the point that I realized that the first C in CCG isn't tangential or trivial. Collection cards via packs is an integral part of the experience. 
---
IMO, comparing it to a video game where you get everything (we'll assume that your $100 buys your DLC) missing the point. Having all the cards for $100 would not make the game more fun. Instead it would kill the challenge of trying to assemble a deck with missing pieces as well as the challenges of managing dust and the thrill of getting a good legendary out of a pack.
---
If that's not the type of game that you want to play then that's fine by me, but I'm going to resist efforts to change an element of the game that's been a fundamental part of the entire genre from the days where it all started. 
---
Ultimately, I think that you and other people are asking for something that sounds good on paper but which isn't actually that awesome in reality. 
---
Infinite deck is one option
---
I built a deck with lots of taunts, every card I had that swapped health and mana, and dk uther
---
What were you playing? Priest?
---
Use health swappers or silence against those
---
 Seems like a lot of work just to get multiple weak collections scattered across different accounts 
---
Makes sense the 'Wrath of Air' totem should have 'Wind-fury'
---
If winning games means you're still mad then quit dude.  I can get frustrated at this game sometimes too but even a grinded out win feels good to me.  Some of the hardest games that you win are the ones that feel the best.
---
Then I challenge you to spell out exactly how the rules as written were violated.
---
I'm open to any sound reasoning and logic. 
---
Coin concede
---
Big Priest is kinda screwed either way. If the minions are in his deck (as he would like them to be), half of them are gone on average. If they are in his hand, he can't cheat them out properly for a while and OP is Zoo I would say so they have the advantage.
---
Unless you're a skilled arena player, no not really. The game also (imo) feels really stale at the moment because there's mostly otk decks and of course hunters dominating the ladder. 
---
Wow nice man that is some fast ranking up. I have been playing since ungoro but have never gotten past rank 12, although I have never tried seriously laddering
---
I don't think so. HS has the no leg dupes, guaranteed leg in first 10packs of an expansion, and the free like 6packs + whatever leg/rare cards or so upon release of an expansion
---
since the patch completing the run is 100% free. I thoutgh more people ask for following of completed shrines and achievement for finishing them all but they decided just to make it easy :/ . I feel they always listen more to the ones that struggle with having results in the game. Maybe they pay more 
---
The card isn’t good verse aggro, which is what you’d want it for. It’s still a taunt in the way and lots of decks can just buff it. 
---
I beat it with DK uther
---
I'm glad you included the link to the gameplay footage. Obvious rip off. 
---
It was big priest but they already 5/5'ed a lich king and had multiple resurrect cards as well as obsidian statue in their hand. I chose to destroy half of deck but they had 2 lich and 1 obsidian when I died
---
You should play wild, the murlocs there are much better!
---
Arcane dynamo 
---
Maybe if you're speaking a language where nouns carry gender.
---
English doesn't (in most situations)
---
I think that we're all just sharing opinions at this point. I don't agree with /u/chrimewave, but I don't think that he's out of line, either. I think that, in a topic like this, is perfectly fine to say that something seems fishy to you. 
---
You are becoming a trap too?
---
Heres the thing so many people get salty about for the wrong reasons. "A meta exists, which means bad decks dont win." 
---
To use your writing example, its like writing a story your proud of and giving it to your high school language arts teacher. They need to grade it as a test of if you understand basic language and prose. The HS ladder isnt your parents. It doesnt need to give you a gold star for trying. 
---
Eventually, if you learn from your teachers and do your homework, you will master the basics. Someday, you might be kibler: riding a deck you won't find on any leader board to top 20 legend, because your game knowledge and deck building skills have grown. Until then, shitting on learning makes you no better than the "too cool for scool" kids getting high in the bathroom talking about how easy it would be to succeed and thats why they dont try.
---
Odd paladin and Zoolock would use this card against you though.
---
I guess I'm not following you then. Dust value for cards doesn't change, besides when they're nerfed.
---
Wow. You created a card that wouldn't really hate on either Odd Paladin or Zoo Warlock that badly while giving them and AGGRO SHAMAN the exact sort of card they'd love to play.
---
You can easily use Hearthpwn to find people to do your 80g quests with and get 160g every single time, possibly raising the average gold per quest to 63?
---
-"I don't like asifixiating so I choke myself"
---
Mecha'thun runs gloop, idk if Hakkar does.
---
I dont think they last that long tbh... Compared to stuff like weasel priest, odd warrior, dead mans hand warrior, exodia pally, and a handful of other decks, mech cthun decks are significantly faster. As a combo deck, it's really not that slow, it's about average.
---
Yeah... Nevermind. This was a bad idea.
---
With DK Rexxar and Radiant elemental leaving standard i don't think they'll HoF it... unless there's a future card that will cause it to be busted and they wanna get in front of that before it happens.
---
F you boar haters get rid of malygos
---
Hopefully they will also announce the addition of Whizbang to classic set. I may or may not drunkenly crafted a golden one recently.
---
Haven't played since ungoro rotated out. Such a good expantion. 
---
How about quest rogue? 
---
7 mana warrior quest.
---
I'd like to see Maly and Alex get HoF'd. The endgame archetypes they enable have been around for too long, time for them to go out of standard. Also feel the same for divine spirit / inner fire combo. 
---
What if it is just an exotic looking rooster?
---
I think everyone misses them but blizzard is money greedy so they got rid of them. Shame on them
---
5 rares = 20 dust x 5 = 100 dust = 1 epic 
---
illuminati confirmed
---
Every turn.
---
Salty?
---
Wow being salty for losing to 7 priests in a row, why tho?
---
On turn 40 or so.
---
The problem with that theory, if you force your opponent to play off-curve for a turn, then you just forced yourself to play off curve for a turn.
---

\# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

This guy is a scammer, don't trade.
---
That’s what I thought. But the fact he discovered it too makes it that much more gross
---
Not a Raven, just a guy who likes Ravens.  Art depicts a raven, but he actually cannot add a Raven to your hand in Standard due to Raven Familiar being a 2-cost minion.  (He can add Enchanted Raven to your hand in Wild).
---
Thanks for pointing this out, but it's such a stretch I don't know about increasing the score to 3/10.  Mainly because 2/10 was already really generous.
---
As if I needed another reason to hate dr boom lol
---
Huh. A Thanos card. 
---
This is true....
---
I've known for a while, just from browsing this sub, that arena has a completely different play style. I'd like to be good at it some day, but it's a little discouraging when I can barely get one win. I'll keep trying though.
---
I don't think most people think it is garbage, but you can't forget that you still need to pay mana to play the copies. It isn't just free 1/1s forever, you're spending one resource to get potential card advantage. 
---
Very weak against taunts or aoe, which are pretty common. 
---
Think of it this way, let's say you automatically get 3 procs, so three 1/1 for 1 mana. You're spending 4 mana on 4/4 stats. 
---
Someone who picked firefly spends two mana, on 2/4 of stats.  IMO most games that makes firefly the better card. 
---
Like I said, not awful, but I would rarely be very happy to draft one unless I've got synergy cards like wolves or flametongue or buffs. 
---
Who would want a full collection? So many cards never see play. I play for hours a day and I never touch warrior or Druid  so that’s two classes of cards I don’t care about. I dust every legendary I get for them usually. 
---
I play mage and shaman mostly and I have pretty much all I want for those two classes. Some things I want I won’t craft due to rotation but that’s my choice to not craft those. I could easily get them if I wanted. 
---
I think hs is incredibly fair for a free to play game. 
---
Ok my friend I have over 4000 wins in arena, let me tell you topdeck mode is very common.
---
I just dislike the fact that they can deal upwards of 40 damage in one turn (and they can accomplish it with minimally, mediocre draw).
---
I am a midrange-y player, so priest leaves me with utterly no chance. I don't think there's anything wrong with disliking a class. I just don't enjoy playing against priest whatsoever.
---
Update to buckets, making similar strategy buckets have a weighted chance of appearing
---
Of course you can
---
1. Most hero only gave you 5 armor... with Dr. Boom giving 7 being the exception.
---
2. Look at cards like Bring it On! 2 mana, 10 armor yet not played.
---
3. You need better examples... a 9 cost battle cry gain 10 armor is okay mostly bc it's also body to block though probs will not be played. Note: hero cards have 0 ability to block any damage next turn with exception of Gul'dan but requires setup.
---
4. The hero cards are only included if it makes sense. There's plenty of decks that don't run hero cards: Even Pally, Quest warrior, Rez Priest... all top tier atm in standard. In wild, Even Shaman, Kingsbane Rouge don't even run Valeera, Big Priest.
---
5. The opportunity cost is that they're dead draws. And you have to stabilize by the time you cast them otherwise you're dead.
---
I appreciate the effort to jog something but 400 games have thoroughly boggled me. I can give you a tip for of your missing shrines: try the adjacent minions have taunt shrine upgrade especially if you know you have final bosses without removal like deathrattle priest and battle cry shaman. It seems like it wouldn’t be good but it is crazy effective because the ai sucks at trading
---
This is why 1 mana echo doesn't exist. 
---
That it does. Also to clarify, I'm not saying I want a particular class to be stronger than others,  it just naturally happens because of balancing injustices (also Blizzard takes their merry time in evaluating the strength of powerful cards).
---
Obviously you never met Krip, the hearthstone superstar?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoX50XKer8w
---
Agreed. Another dirty rat would be our hero!
---
Take my upvote!
---
Yeah I mean I guess maybe the deathrattle is spikeridged also and one card in hand strange decision
---
Thanks for this discussion :) 
---
I play a lot of wild, it’s usually a staple. 
---
I can agree with you. That is a completely fair point. For this instance, I would say blizzard needs to reevaluate some of those "engines" that classes have access to. And laying OTK is justifiable in the meta right now, as you said - I play some of it too. 
---
In the days of Naxxramas when I was just starting out, the first idea I had for a deck involved Blood Imps and Young Priestesses. I think Hearthstone was trying to do me a favor because it took ages to get my first Blood Imp and I *still* haven't opened any Young Priestesses.
---
Tess is my go to for fun in Hearthstone so I’m always down to try out other people’s experiments. I love the fact that with cutlas you can essentially go either mill or rng fiesta in this list. 
---
How would it not be completely fair if it's "simple RNG," exactly? It means that each card has an equal probability of being at any given place within the deck. That's as balanced as it gets.
---
And to you!
---
He stole 4k worth of cards from someone when he was playing physical card games. I like to remind people every year about this.
---
The one drop that adds a random shaman spell to your hand would've probably fit in better.
---
Wild is so foreign to me, I never know where to start besides playing some old decks I used to have fun with. 
---
Sounds like it would be though.
---
Oh snap
---
That is really sucky!
---
I didn't know there was a rebalance
---
That would assume Recruit Warrior is the best deck ever and properly constructed decks made up of nothing but commons and basic cards could never get their feet off the ground. Such assumption also forgets there's always one winner and one loser in a game, unlike a deathmatch in a shooter.
---
Reposted for lack of flair. D'oh!
---
It’s pretty close, but not quite there. RNGs usually depend on some real phenomenon. Usually it’s time, which isn’t completely random. This is why random numbers generated by a computer are known as pseudo-random numbers. 
---
I was but he wasn't :(
---
Luckily I was about to lose anyway
---
With healing as well
---
He’s getting down voted because he said to play hunter
---
Hunter is currents very dominant all over and has a lot of hate right now
---
seems great, until you play when it first starts and your deck is full of unplayable stuff
---
Ahhhhhh. Taverns of Time cards. I never even considered those.
---
Yes, great examples of cards that affect your deck in a more localised sense. 
---
And I agree that more deck-interacting mechanics that are more controlled random than *anywhere* (Void Contract, Fal'dorei Strider, Seaforium Bomber being examples of pure randomness and general deck influence) is a fantastic place to explore in Hearthstone. 
---
I agree that a rock-paper-scissors meta isn't healthy for the game, and it's funny how many people parrot the same line about "aggro keeps combo in check, combo keeps control from getting too greedy" while at the same time complaining that rock-paper-scissors is boring. 
---
The fact is there is one and only one archetype matchup in which the potential for *both* players to have fun exists, and that is control vs control. Aggro vs combo/control: whoever gets better draw RNG and wins is going to have more fun. Combo vs control: the combo deck gets to play solitaire for 20 turns and get a free win. Control vs control: every turn of the game is interactive, important, and depends significantly less on draw RNG with the exception of death knights, which the devs have basically admitted were a mistake and are rotating anyway. 
---
People here do not critically engage with this discussion, instead regurgitating the same shit about "aggro keeping the meta healthy". They forget how the community basically unanimously loved the meta during UnGoro, which was probably the most control-heavy in the game's history. 
---
LUL cause what else am I supposes to do with class:druid dot deck :(
---
I played a game against one of these decks with exodia paladin the other day.  "75 armor? don't care"
---
Which server? 
---
Then two more questions arise: how "pseudo" is the random, and is there an approach that is less "pseudo" random? If the answer to the latter question is no," it seems like a moot point anyhow. It's as random as it gets, even if it's not perfectly random, which makes it as balanced as it gets.
---
If there is a more random way of doing it, then what is it?
---
Leaving aside that having such a powerful all-around card as lich king in the classic set would be horrible....
---
They wouldn't even consider it due to the expansion literally revolving around him.
---

---
I wasn’t talking about fairness, I was talking about your tone, presentation, and general attitude.  You can express the same opinion without sounding like a complete jerk.
---
Thanks! I’ll take a look.
---
It seems like a lot of the players you noted are making big mistakes. Maybe they are practicing to learn how to use the deck properly before heading to ranked so that they don't lose rank? Good thing there's a place where anyone can play any deck to practice and play against a real opponent without wins and losses being a huge deal.
---
Thank you for the compliment! 
---
&gt; OTKs are fine as part of the meta but if you don't give players the tools to deal with them it just becomes boring and frustrating. 
---
Well put. I can agree that they are, in fact, fine to play against, but as long as you have the tools to deal with it. Thinking about this, it makes me think that OTK variant decks are almost outside of the "rock paper scissors" meta. Because in the cycle of R-P-S, there actually isn't much to deal with OTK, unlike how you can easily counter aggro, midrange, or control. 
---
Unless you roll odd shaman 
---
Wow. Didnt know Overkill worked with heroes. Guess its somewhat relevant for this.
---
Yeah it was meant as a satire... some of them make good plays and others don't but it was meant as a dig at them playing net decks in casual mode and hence not being able to handle ranked.  I have also faced some net deckers who make optimal plays.  They also should go play ranked!
