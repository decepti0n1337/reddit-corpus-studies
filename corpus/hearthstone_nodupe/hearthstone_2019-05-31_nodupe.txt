Wall Priest is definitely fuck aggro
---
Thanks
---
I'm guessing "that card exists" is for [[Cathedral Gargoyle]], and you're playing Dragon Paladin. Priest is probably Wall Priest.
---
that's not their answer. they don't do it because they want heroes to be more "important". by handing them out very rarely people tend to get more attached to their favorites than if we had 9 new ones dumped on us

In this case its 0%. Truly unfortunate. Great screenshot!

It‚Äôs a delayed hero power that‚Äôs three times as strong as the hunter hero power.  It still isn‚Äôt good on the later bosses, but it‚Äôs more than slightly more powerful.
---
You better get that hero power off quick
---
cough cough cho
---
I had kind of a similar idea
---
&gt;The basic idea is, of course, after each clear of 8 bosses, you can start another run with an increased difficulty. Incrased health, extra mana, an extra draw, stronger hero powers &gt;etc. Additionally, I think, each week would have 3 treasures that bosses obtain as you clear successive runs e.g. Glyph of Warding, Small Backpack and so on. At the end of the &gt;week based on your relative performance, you might get a pack or golden card or two.
---
&gt;The main question is how does your deck carry on between runs. It's easy to imagine that as you get more and more treasures, they would quickly outscale anything the game &gt;could throw at you, and that as your deck becomes increasingly large, each bucket of cards that you pick has a relatively smaller effect.
---
&gt;My thought is that, between each clear, you have a special friendly encounter, with the Villain for that wing replacing Bartender Bob. You've handed over your deck, and he's giving &gt;you your cut back for the next run. So, just as in the normal friendly encounter, you get a series of cards that allow you to manipulate your deck, except you're setting up the deck &gt;that you get to keep in between each run, and rather than the 'enemy' minions/deck being randomly selected, it's the deck you just used to clear the previous run. You'd have 10 &gt;'gold' rather than the 2, but the cards might have more wildly varying costs - saving a treasure permanently might cost you 5 gold, for example.
---
&gt;Ultimately, the aim is that this means rather than just having a crazy exponentially scaling deck where the game is settled on turn 1, you're slowly improving the quality of your &gt;deck, preserving a bit of each run each time.
---
&gt;I think this would be an enjoyable competitive PvE mode, where players could demonstrate a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the dungeon run, rather than just waiting &gt;until they get the nuts and never coming back.
---
Does he jave a Knockoff Emote for Sorry with the help of Major?
---
Damn I wish I would have known that
---
That would‚Äôve worked better, but you would still run out of patches eventually. The best option here would def be the treasure that gives all your minions 1/1.
---
We prey at night, we stalk at night, We are the rats.
---
Wrong. Golden cards increase your winrate due to the intimidation factor
---
&gt;t isn't and you're correct.
---
It is annoying but is a feature of the game, so isn't a valid reason to report at all. Like BM on emotes, you can simply squelch and move on. Reports should be for disrespectful messages after game, bug exploit, things that are unfair and impact in a negative way the gaming experience.

Sample size has nothing to do with anything. I could play 3 games, play rafaam twice, and have 1 game played according to tracker, if this post is accurate.

10/10/10 | At the end of your turn, put a minion from your deck into the battlefield.  
---
The rat king on normal is annoying. 
---
The rat king on heroic is brutal and total BS. Turn one he summons a 1/10 that you can‚Äôt kill because you have no creatures. Turn two it‚Äôs another 1/10 and maybe a buff. You still haven‚Äôt dealt with the first one. Turn three is another 1/10. Another buff. 
---
By turn 6 I was dead. I actually played stuff but it wasn‚Äôt enough. I couldn‚Äôt begin to keep up.

I had a tortollan forager give me tomb pillager and it switched to 4/5. I hate the stat switches

I think it was Reynad who coined the phrase, "Feels priest, man."
---
My buddy and I will say that every time we have to throw a heal on turn two. Feels priest, man.
---
Ya, you really have to scrape the bottom of the barrel for deathrattles. I want to try Cairne and Dr Morrigan, but don't want to craft them. There's also other stuff that's useful when pulled like big bad archmage and leeroy. Definitely run dollmaster Dorian if you own it.
---
*Wax rager intensifies*
---
I literally opened him this week... so I‚Äôll shed a tear in solidarity
---
If you cast time warp with Toki the time tinkerer, she has an ability you can choose from that lets you cast the first spell you use every turn a second time. Three time warps for the price of one.
---
I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritaring and it gets everywhere.
---
I actually got him twice in a row on a run, but it was one where I drafted all Mechs from the start so I just thought it was a cool Easter egg for going mech heavy. Only time I have ever seen him.
---
Grom would have to be changed to like 15-15 rush to see any play. Who in the right mind would want to use a 2 card combo to remove a minion?
---
She got a small rock from killing one of her elementals.  0 mana deal 1.  Probably a couple things she could get tho
---
Might be a reference to Bob from Overwatch
---
&gt; The bartender never changes
---
there is a robot bartender but it seems to be rare.
---
I had the same feeling. That's just pure laziness. They made it seem like there would be new bosses for each chapter, but it's just a slightly altered mechanic and "new" heroes being released.  
---
The bosses could at least act like they are catching up with you again or re-encountering you.

9/9/9 | Rush  
---
Got a double battlecry queue as bomb warrior, with two explodinators in the deck. 4 mana pyroblast on a stick is pretty good.
---
Then faced bae chao.
---
She must have silenced the shuffled bombs as well.
---
Cards running at 2 might be balanced, but at 4 can be completely busted. Look at Windlord. Fountain is just another two copies of him, basically. And people only really ran windlord when Corpsetaker was around. 
---
Hell, running two fountains, windlord, and a Zil is one of the few reasons control shaman is even a thing. Maybe if they stat grom really well, having "three groms" would be enough to break it.
---
&gt;777(777(777))  
---
FTFY.
---
?????????????
---
Please do elaborate on how a 8 mana charge minion, that requires some sort of activator to be better than a 4 mana card (korkron) restricts design space. Every time the keyword "charge" is mentioned some idiotscome up saying "durr this restricts design space". So please tell me a hypothetical card, that costs less than 2 mana which is an enrage activator and minion buff at the same time that also leverages the fact that grom has high attack. Go ahead. 
---
Oh and even if it was restricting design space, guess what? EVERY FCKIN CARD RESTRICTS DESIGN SPACE. Because silverback patriarch exists they cannot print a card that says "if you have silverback patriarch at hand win the game". But I aint seeing no one ask for fckin silverback patriarch HoF. 
---
And in what world is having design space a good thing? Bigge your design space is, less complete and worse the game is overall. Do you see people paying hundreds of miilions of dollars over blank canvas because of all the design space it has? No, but you would not be able to buy mona lisa if you got all the money in the world BECAUSE it has no design space. It is already as good as it gets. 
---
So instead of vomiting blanked statements to sound smart, actually contribute to the discussion.
---
*Khadgar was buffeted by the sandstorm*
---
You've got some tough decisions in the priest mirror during those first 4 turns. Do you heal his face or your own?
---
That would only really change Exodia Mage in Wild. Currently, the turn you throw down Anton is just the turn you generate them all in, then you start chuckin' them after, which you'd only get 2 (3 with MEEEE?! girl) in the face with 10 mana anyway, so he'd be the exact same as he'd just refresh the same 2~3 he casts on the initial turn generated. 
---
Anton seems pretty fringe on being used in any given meta in Standard; I'd be very surprised if they touched him as well. I'd tackle Maly before Anton, as Maly causes some BS decks to rise from out of nowhere.
---
And as annoying as it is losing to Exodia Mage in Wild, it is far from a problematic deck as it dies to aggro and can be teched against, making it extremely polarizing.
---
r/woooosh
---
He runs on his own clock, that‚Äôs all you need to know.
---
He also has an imitation of Scourgelord Garrosh DK with the same hero power but gains more armor when played. I faced him on heroic, so he might be different from normal mode. Make him emote, he is really funny!
---
I know this post is just a joke. but those nerfs should happen. Not because these cards are problematic, but because we've got to a point where Blizzard want Charge gone from the game. It's more confusing to new players to have cards in a classic set that use a mechanic that is dead going forward.
---
I think 2x Soulfire + Leeroy needs to be in any Zoo list.
---
Whether Rafaam is in there or not is questionable but I think that burn is necessary.
---
With cyclone mage, its really not too uncommon to close out games with an apprentice on board, antonidas, 0-1 cost spell, fireball. I know it sounds out there but it happens more than you‚Äôd think, especially to set up two turn lethals with frost ray.
---
Personal? Not completely. You are just 1 in the group of "some idiots". Though of off all the idiots making this exact same comment, you probably take the cake for calling grom of all cards restricting, since it comes online at turn 8 at earliest, AND needs to be paired with another card. 
---
&gt; however, it's not fun/interactive to play against a gameplan that revolves around smashing face with charge/weapons/buffs
---
Hmm yeah man if only there was a keyword that countered the gameplan revolving around charge and weapons. That maybe created a shield around a minion that would block such attacks. Hmmm so sad that it does not exist. Oh wait its taunt and a butload of minions have it.
---
&gt; We learned this during pirate warrior meta
---
Translation: "I dont know how to play the game and never did so I will be a part of echo chamber to feel safe". Pirate warrior was not strong because of charge minions. Those were just reach. Pirate warrior was strong because it had extremely busted 1 drops and 2 drops, which made it dominate boards early and close games out by turn 5, which was before any board clear or good heal could come online. Literally any pirate warrior would prefer the nerf hitting deckhand instead of small time buccaneer and fiery war axe.
---
&gt; They can focus on a board state meta, which is far more interactive for the player.
---
So what you are saying is you are too stupid to play a complex card game, so you want them to make the game easy enough that a half braindead monkey can reach legend? No thanks. Any idiot can find the good trades on board. What takes skill is the guess what cards your opponent might be holding and playing around their impact. 
---
I also love how every player who writes the same stupid comment completely disregards the fact that control decks get to clear the entire board from hand, and that is considered fine but heaven forbid if an agro deck gets to do something from hand. WTF is an agro deck supposed to do with rush? I AM ALREADY THE ONE ON BOARD. Am i supposed to play korkron with rush into my opponents empty board so it can get killed by warpath? No thanks.
---
&gt; because it's obvious that patriarch isn't problematic to the enjoyment of the general playerbase.
---
As opposed to grom who is a meta menace xD
---
No I wont delete my comment. I stand by it 100%. Im sick of idiots making stupid comments with no underlying though behind them. Off of all stupid accusations I have heard against cards, calling a 2 card 8 mana combo that gives you a 12 damage attack "design restricting" is by far one of the dumbest. I am rude because you are being disrespectful to everyone on the thread by writing shit with no logic behind it. You ar eon the same level as an internet troll or a spammer. 
---
Oh btw pirate warrior is considered one of the most fair to play against decks in the game mode it exists in right now :) So instead of trying to talk about how you are knowledgeable about HS history try actually learning the game :)

 evergreen#11902 NA trading 80g quest. I'll show, you go first. You can check my post history for verification.
---
It all depends on if you are interested in the Wild format of hearthstone. You can get really good cards (or dust) from all of them but the League of Explorers and Blackrock Mountain have some great cards/is probably the best two to buy first. Karazhan has a few really good cards but you might be able to skip unless you want Barnes or Medivh
---
It may be an upopular opinion but I think a weaker classic set is the best way to go. Makes rotations matter more, expansions to impact better the meta and new decks and strats viable. The main reason i'm sick about the Rogue class is that I strongly hate Sap, that card is and will ever been in any Rogue deck ever.

---
Seems so
---
I think Kazakus The Red will not be used at all, 6 mana 3/3 is pretty bad not to mention you have to spend 5 mana before to upgrade it, the tempo and the value of Kazakus is just too low. One random for each mage, priest, and warlock isn't to useful, if it's instead discover mage, priest and warlock spell I think it would be much better and give a higher value, for random I think 4 or 5 mana is already good enough
---
Yes card packs are technically lootboxes, basicLly anything with a random chance at getting an item that can be used ingame if that makes sense.
---
yes

I'm no dev, but I feel like the perma rush is by far the thing that needs addressed most.

Let's just nerf every classic card ever while we're at it.  I seriously don't understand why so many people all of a sudden are on the "nerf everything from classic" bandwagon. I'm one more major classic nerf/HOF away from ever giving Blizzard any of my money again. üôÑ
---
Yes, two is better of course but if you roll illidan he can generate an additional minion.
---
Well im actually interested in wtf happens before and after. Damn you... and blizzard
---
This is the final boss so yes. The deck itself was really mediocre. Basically bomb warrior with a few extra Dr Booms ans Rotfaces. But the treasures were good. Had the Expedite and Dreamgrove Ring ones
---
it's a kids game.
---
No it doesn't, because it's a new card. Same deal when Bob's cost reduction hits Unidentified Contract. Once it's in your hand, it turns into a new card and costs 6 again.
---
my work here is done
---
I feel like if I was making a "quickcast" tag, I would make it be Spells cast X less when used on minions the turn they are drawn or created. So the Northrend Fireball would be some thing like 5 mana *Quickcast 3* deal 6 damage,
---
I don't think a 2 card combo that requires 10 mana and a 3/2 minion to already be on board and results in 6 damage to the opponent's face is in any way too strong. Seriously if you are at 6 or less life and are unable to kill an Apprentice then you probably lost anyway.

---
Honestly, I'm 100% certain that it's inevitable Blizzard is going to nerf **nearly all** if not all Charge minions to Rush (only ones with suitable drawbacks like Leeroy **might** escape it). It's likely to happen during next year's rotation at the latest. The reasons for the nerf are clear:
---
* Blizzard has long been slowly nerfing the classic set into the ground, and the Classic set is the **only** one with the **Charge** keyword, making it 'too powerful' compared to standard rotating sets.
---
* Blizzard basically admitted that Charge was a mistake and it should have been designed like Rush when they first introduced the Rush keyword. They literally called it *a more balanced Charge*, and said "*in hindsight it's how we should have designed charge*".
---
* Blizzard has previously stated that some charge minions (especially **Stonetusk Boar**) wreak havoc on a lot of new mechanic ideas by showing how broken it can be when you throw in a 1 mana charge minion.
---
* Blizzard doesn't like 1 turn kills where you go from an empty board to winning the game. They've consistently nerfed such combos into oblivion, but they're still there with charge minions (especially with Priest Inner Fire shenanigans).
---
*The rest of the pages are stuck together*
---
No it‚Äôs WoW
---
Seems fitting that the erotica novel author is only in Dalaran's sewers
---
There‚Äôs no way they can turn Grom into a rush minion. It instantly becomes one of the worst legendaries in the game. Unless they lowered the cost.
---
You've come to die
---
Hahaha!
---
This comment made my day. I get this so often
---
That would be really cool if one of the bosses made your cards float around and slowly start mixing them around your screen

That's not true! That's impossible!

The list is pretty standard except for the double frostbolt, which is an absolute must for a ton of reasons. It's another freeze for fat minions. You can always dump it if your hand gets clogged which happens a lot. Countless times against aggro like odd paladin and even shaman I've had the board frozen but they had a weapon that would've killed me but I won because I froze his face. I hate the artificers, double frostbolt all the way baby.

Agreed on Nomi priest - it‚Äôs the same frustration as mechathun. There‚Äôs no real counter and no real interaction other than watch them race their own deck towards the victory condition. Part of the issue is that the combo isn‚Äôt one turn and win or lose... they can clone Nomi or clone whatever victory condition and use it multiple turns which requires a stupid amount of removal or luck to survive in the first place that there‚Äôs basically no win in sight.

No, but he may step in to protect his potion supply from getting cut off ;)

---
He's ridiculous. If you play any deck with small minions they're literally useless, and he's got a ton of single target removal for bigger things anyways. Just lost to him again where I had to use most of my resources to get rid of his early Lich King, only for him to revive three of them the next turn.
---
You can steal it with the kobold-minion-treasure guy and he even has voicelines for all emotes! Stole it today without even knowing it existed.
---
Haha, sadly for me, odd and even paladin were what made me quit the game last time, and the only reason I returned so soon was due to the swift removal of them from standard.
---
I'm also not a wild player on my main account so I dust the cards automatically at the start of the new rotation.

---
I‚Äôve only played matches on casual because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as strong as any of the other meta decks. 
---
The idea is ridiculous and only works well when you hit Lightwarden combos and Northshire Cleric combos. In comparison, Zoo Warlock is so much more reliable with cards like Grim Ralley and Soularium.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend crafting anything for this deck. You can try out the deck with the cards you probably already have (mind blast, northshire cleric, etc etc) to get an idea.
---
This deck was my first idea and could definitely be better with different card choices
---
Looks like the scythe summoned a rat that replaced him
---
This is so sad
---
Eh, calm down there bud. He was making a valid argument, not just trying to argue with you to troll you.
---
I definitely agree with him. Having them all means having them all, as the starting comment said.
---
What kind of paint do you use on them? That's a very nice glossy finish!
---
Dalaran!  Look!
---
thats what im saying.
---
make it 3 mana or 2/2..
---
It's based on luck. Singularity is an aggro type. You don't care about anything, except throwing minions every single turn. By the end of turn 6-8, you have to win, or you lose. If you draw only high-cost cards or cards without death rattle, concede. That's just it.

When I was writting this, i use my 31 attack void to kill a catacombs. Guess what turn am I in? Turn 6.
---
Rez priest is very easy to beat.
---
That carousel ends my runs.
---
It's close to the fish
---
I actually love these videos. They're so zen in a way.
---
That regardless of the effort you put in or lack of, there are thousands of unseen forces that constantly influence our path. And maybe instead of struggling against those factors, if we just go with the flow, we can truly succeed.

Rank?

&gt; A "tier 3" deck sounds like a deck you would never be able to climb well with
---
no it doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs just you misunderstanding what tier 3 means

Looking to trade 80 gold quest on EU.

You go first.

I think the deck needs more removal, and maybe a buff like if you reshuffle this minion and draw it again it gets +2 +1
---
I had to tech in a Chief Inspector for secret hunter matchup. The Freezing Trap really carries the deck against any type of tempo.
---
I think the main issue is that there isn‚Äôt a single card or small set of cards that are overpowered/synergistic together with warrior (aside from the obvious dr.boom). It‚Äôs simply the fact that he has so many removal and value adder options that the arsenal is enough to fill an entire deck.
---
I really want the video to this and not just a screenshot.
---
You do choose one at the start of the game, it‚Äôs called choosing which hero you play
---
I have them all, I think.
---
Cant understand this post
---
*Your turn*

That was phernomergnaw!

I was just telling my friends about an idea I had for a survival gauntlet mode where you keep fighting harder and harder bosses until you lose.
---
There is definitely no such thing in the Dalaran underbelly. Please, carry on.
---
I‚Äôve beaten all 4 wings on heroic easily and never encountered him. Thank God because I just saw his gameplay...
---
But jade idol is not so bad? She sure summon a jade is pretty mana efficient but it isn't as strong as some other choose one cards.
---
Scrapping Alex makes sense to me because Murloc Shaman is more consistent with ranking up on ladder, good luck
---
/u/xculatertate has [more sultry details in their comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bv6t3m/if_you_wait_long_enough_cravitz_lorent_actually/epm5mx9/)

We actually recorded both lines mentioned there, plus maybe a couple more, I forget. It was... hoo boy, it was hard to listen to (and I mean that as a huge compliment to the voice actor).  Gio initially asked a few of us to listen to it just to gauge people‚Äôs reactions, but it made so many people uncomfortable we just started springing it on people to fuck with them.^^

Another big problem in Hearthstone in my opnion is that if you stoped playing for a yer, will be almost impossible for you to comeback and play the game with good decks, unless you throw a shit ton of money into it.
---
Wait I‚Äôm very invested now, what‚Äôs your tinyfin‚Äôs name?&lt;3
---
You can outplay Gally easy tho, save the 2 twist coins because he takes those and your draft chaft to give him the worst trade deals in the history of azeroth
---
You recommend buying it. The anomalies and extra hero's add so much. It has been a blast to play. I have played each wing multiple times because of how fun it can be.
---
huh,will keep that in mind,thanks for the info. \^^
---
See edit on "strictly."
---
And if that's how the transform mechanic works it needs to be stated and/or tweaked because it wouldn't trigger Kazakus' battlecry
---
Yeah I pretty much did! Glad you liked it!
