Ye step up  man. You might get yourself some selfsuck points. Reddit eouldbe so weird without karmasystem. All bitchbois would stop acting like white knights..

&gt;My fear is that bc of shamans quest giving them so much guranteed value, the strongest deck for the next year will be quest shaman. Wanna make a shaman deck you think will be fun to take on ladder? Go ahead but the question is always gonna be why aren‚Äôt you playing the quest instead?
---

---
That line of questioning seems really rather paranoid, especially with Aggro and Murloc Shamans having consistently better raw winrates.
---
&gt;And then the weaker quests could be buffed slightly to balance them out more. 
---
Out of everything that could be buffed, buffing quests would probably be the most dangerous thing possible.
---
The Caverns Below was slaughtered by changing one number, that one number was enough to make it completely unplayable until the release of Viscous Scalehide.
---
Changing Hack the System, Activate the Obelisk, Unseal the Vault, and Raid the Sky Temple by a similar amount could easily create a very similar situation we had with The Caverns Below or are potentially having with Untapped Potential or Corrupt the Waters. 
---
&gt;Idk about you but I don‚Äôt wanna be playing against quests decks and only that for the next year lol that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm doomsaying about rn
---
If what Quest Druid and Quest Shaman weren't built around the same mechanic, would you be okay with them?
---
Do you never want to see decks in Standard last their full possible lifespan?
---
It‚Äôs actually probably a fairly good system. If you have some ultra popular channel that can just start throwing out sponsored videos every day and stay on top of the algorithm it would be terrible for users.
---
I constantly quit h stone and am reeled back in by watching content.
---
I think it's a ass game that makes for a great show imo. They really took the 7/10 for everyone approach vs the amazing experience for a niche; which I believe TCG need to do to be great
---
how tho?
---
A friend and I were trying to identify the single worst minion in the game according to this exact criteria the other day. There are so many underwhelming cards which rarely amount to anything amazing, like Angry Chicken, but they don't really punish you, they are just weak. And then there are cards which work against you most of the time, like Millhouse and Duskfallen Aviana, but still have fringe cases where they can let you come out ahead. We settled on a single card where we felt that was essentially never true.
---
[[Arcane Golem]]. You only get 1 stat more than the standard for a well-statted minion at the same cost - at the cost of giving your opponent an extra mana every turn thereafter. Even in a situation where the Mana doesnt punish you, i.e. playing it after turn 10, there isnt anything you gain by playing Arcane Golem specifically that couldn't be gained (if not outdone) by playing a number of other cards in its place. You're not going to play it at 3 mana, and there are more impactful bodies you can play at 10 mana. At that point there's so many other cards you might as well be playing instead.
---
Millhouse is definitely really close and similar, but in a case where the opponent doesn't actually have any worthwhile spells in their hand, playing a 4/4 on turn 2 can actually be a huge tempo advantage and the beginnings of a victory. I've lost to it in Arena before. There are super fringe cases where playing a 4/4 on turn 3 could be the difference between winning and losing - but not when it gives the opponent extra Mana. And unlike Millhouse, there's never a way around it.
---
My friend mentioned that he has never seen it played since it's been nerfed, and he's right. There isnt a deader card...which is crazy considering it used to be a staple and a win condition. The one place it has shown up is in the co-op Brawls, where it's used to help the other player ramp their mana up. Because that's the one thing it's actually really effective at....lol

How are you feeling about Legends of Runeterra so far? I'd love to hear your take on it.
---
Sexy play
---
I've stopped playing the game or supporting Blizzard in any form, but I do love their games. I'm still using this subreddit to keep up to date in the hope that the company will reform. As far as I can tell, my participation in this subreddit doesn't impact Blizzard at all.
---
Just a story of caution to anybody frequenting this thread.
---
Soon after posting for my quest here, I was added by someone by the name of Keef ( I do not know if posting battletag is allowed in this context) who claimed he had the quest and wanted me to go first.
---
I agreed on the condition that he show his quest first, which he refused. He claimed he has posted some pic online on Hearthpwn as proof of having the quest but despite asking repeatedly, he didn't share any link.
---
There is a known scammer by the name of Keef in the list. When I mentioned this to him, he said his battletag was whitelisted. However, this wasn't mentioned anywhere in the list, which has certain whitelisted battletags with the same name as scammers. When I pressed him further, he unfriended me.
---
Later, this nice guy added me and we shared each other's quest. When I told him about the incident, he said someone by the name of Keef had tried to scam him a few days back by claiming he had shown the quest when he had not. When he refused to go first without proof, Keef got rude and hurried him to commence with the challenge.
---
I wish there was some provision to ban such poison to the community. In any case, take care folks and check the list of scammers before committing.
---
Because 1. it has nothing to do with wild 2. blizz did nothing wrong and 3. even if you disagree with 2. you're not helping anyone by boycotting blizz.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/ Do those things if you want to help hongkong and stop expecting that commitment from a videogame company.
---
I still enjoy Hearthstone content and being part of the community, but I can't bring myself to play it or any other Blizzard game that I used to love. It just makes me feel gross.
---
Yes but then the valanyr deathrattles hit and buff them up and it just keeps exponentially growing.
---
Agreed.  The mods have clearly had a "We're tired of hearing about this" approach to the censorship/HK issue and are just using the closest possible excuse.  Or just removing threads without explanation.  But there is also little that we can say about it beyond "We're still angered about your conduct, Blizzard", most of the threads are news and opinion from new sources.
---
I came in here ready to tell people off and say basically the same thing ("what do you want?") but I was pleasantly surprised to see the top responses are actually quite reasonable and sensible.
---
&gt;Pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't work, as a matter of fact it makes everything worse.
---
Well, when it comes to bad PR, it often does work. Blizzard is just going to stay quiet and reduce chances for people to keep the story going. Let a new news story come in and let the wave of outrage die down. These sort of things blow over all the time.  
---
I think their biggest problem is their current library. People wouldn‚Äôt care as much if they were enjoying the product. It‚Äôs been a long year for Blizz with many missteps, they‚Äôre putting everything into this Blizzcon to turn things around. No more controversy talk for a couple weeks and a good convention with big announcements changes the conversation.
---
As far as other companies throwing them under the bus, it‚Äôs a temporary thing. They don‚Äôt want to be attached to the company while the name is controversial. They‚Äôll keep doing business when things have blown over and they can make money together again.
---
Civils Rights Movment in the US was 1960s man, and you don't get much more Capitilst than 1960s america. You'll have heard of that one, but I could list countless small scale from the UK in my lifetime, such as the ban on fox hunting, or gay rights. 
---
Activism works all the time, and governments the world over are fluid entities, even if sometimes it doesn't feel so history always proves otherwise.
---
But they don‚Äôt have better winrates than quest and didn‚Äôt have better winrates than quest even before the event (I would know bc I played Murloc shaman to 70 legend last month) 
---
I agree they‚Äôve had better winrates in the past, but that‚Äôs the past. That was before shaman got this quest. 
---
And the questioning is paranoid you‚Äôre right, and for good reason. It wasn‚Äôt that long ago we had gen and baku that gave guranteed value and that limited variety so much they rotated them. I feel like unless blizzard just stops printing good battlecries for the next year, why not play quest shaman? Because in its current state (pre event) it‚Äôs gonna always be better than the other archetypes of shaman in standard until things are changed/ rotate. But that‚Äôs just my opinion lol
---
And the quests I propose buffing would be the weaker ones that are in wild, that would shake up wild (which it needs) and not affect standard with even more quest decks lol
---
For curious people:
---
`Total Damage = (3 * (3 + (8 * (Velen's Chosens + 15)))) * (60 - Velen's Chosens)`
---
This can be solved by hand. Multiply out:
---
3(3+8(x+15))\*(60-x) = (24x+369)(60-x) = -24x\^2 + 1440x - 369x + 22140 = -24x\^2 + 1071x + 22140
---
Take the derivative and set to 0 (Setting the derivative to 0 gives us either a total damage value that isn't changing with x, indicating that it is a maximum):
---
d(damage)/d(velen's) = d/dx(-24x\^2 + 1071x +22140) = -48x + 1071 = 0
---
Solve: 1071 = 48x =&gt; x = 1071/48 = 22.313

---
TL;DR Play stuff, out tempo the fuck out of your opponent using evolve, profit.
---
It made the Lackey too good, it didn't make Vanish any better.  Also I don't think it made the Lackey too good.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs the best way to go - quietly distancing yourself. But if you continue to play in anyway (even if you‚Äôve built your livlihood on the game) it still betraying your values and supporting a modern day Holocaust
---
I did it today and the boss got 3 of the ‚Äògains attack = to number of murlocs‚Äô.
---
Yes. Yes that is exactly what we want! Anyone still playing has Hong Kong blood on there hands!
---
I *am* the democracy!
---
I agree, but there still are metrics that show Quest Shaman isn't necessarily the best Shaman deck out there. Tempo Storm shows similarly.
---
Even then losing Evolve in a few weeks, Shudderwock, Hagatha the Witch, and Lifedrinker with the next rotation, and potentially Mind Control Tech in the next Hall of Fame induction really isn't going to do the deck any favors.
---
Good point, didn‚Äôt think about scroll of wonders so I guess it‚Äôs technically infinite
---
It resets after two something billion
---
I play wild exclusively so
---
No, this most recent expansion has sucked.  I can't find myself having any fun with any of the decks.  That along with the Blitzchung nonsense gave me some pretty clear reasons to quit.  I've moved on to Eternal and it is a lot more fun.
---
I think your explanation was more complicated.
---
Activision-Blizzard have US$7.5b in revenue. They don't release HS figures specially but the best estimates I've seen were a peak of about $100m per expansion cycle (so around $300m a year, say $400m max) , with a 50% decline in revenue since the 2016 peak. 
---
Apparently the latest cycle is up on the previous cycle, so say a drop to US$150-200m/year increasing to a maximum of US$250m in the current 12 months to date. Which is neatly 3.33% of Activision-Blizzard's total revenue. Even if it's double my numbers it's still a small part of a US$7.5b company.
---
Let‚Äôs also get one thing clear: there is no liberation for Hong Kong on the horizon. It‚Äôs not. Hong Kong is a former British colony with a complicated history and is currently designated a special economic zone within China, largely due to an agreement with the British government. Hong Kong is not a fully sovereign nation. 
---
Hong Kong is on the coast of China and have no way at all to defend themselves. China does not care at all about western humanitarian concerns and do not share in the western views of liberalism and individual God-given rights. As an example, they have recolonized Africa and are currently trading weapons to warlords in return for slaves they can work to death in mines. China doesn‚Äôt care. 
---
The special status of Hong Kong has been contingent on the British government being able to enforce the agreement and Hong Kong becoming an incredibly prosperous and profitable economic center for China. The people of Hong Kong have benefited from a huge number of benefits that many Chinese could only dream of. 
---
In the new age, China is looking to reconsolidate their influence and control and solidify a more homogenous perspective and unified China. They do not want any disruptions or factions to challenge this. 
---
Hong Kong‚Äôs only hope, and I mean this literally, would be American intervention. America would need to engage in a ground war with China in China and hold the area with perpetual military presence for the entire period a hypothetical sovereign Hong Kong to exist. It‚Äôs not happening.
---
Okay so the player got his prize money and his punishment reduced, Blizzard lost players and will lose some income but again, how does this go back to Hong Kong, the whole reason why the issue was raised. Please tell me about the change that they will be making to provide their citizens with more human rights.
---
In a typical arena game (maybe more so this meta), the speed of the game makes it unlikely you‚Äôll fatigue or anything. And if you play it turn 4 and win turn 10 but lose 6 cards, it didn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs basically cards you wouldn‚Äôt have seen in your deck. Fel Reaver has the same logic behind it
---
&gt;And the ~~way~~ amount he shuffles =P
---
Thanks for the info. I‚Äôll try it out :)
---
No, I think you're right. Checking whether any players are dead is just one step of the Hearthstone "script," it just doesn't happen in between resolving deathrattles, while it *does* happen after each Yogg spell.
---
Actually, the player above is only technically correct about MTG -- a player losing the game can happen at any time including the middle of resolving a spell or trigger and the game will immediately end, but a player having zero life doesn't immediately lose them the game, that only happens after all effects of a spell or trigger are calculated (MTG calls this "state-based actions"). For example if you cast [Zap](https://scryfall.com/card/inv/180/zap) on an opponent at 1 life while you have no cards left in your deck, then you do all the effects of the card in order. First they take 1 damage and go to zero life. Then you try to draw a card from your empty library and lose the game immediately. Your opponent wins the game, even though they have zero life.
---
Thank you very much for your reasoning. I‚Äôll be sure to put it to use. I‚Äôll blame you if my run goes wrong ;)
---
Yeah I think you're right, seems to have died off from the initial hype and everyone's back to Fortnite and MOBAs.
---
It‚Äôll take you maybe 10 minutes longer to make a deck but it‚Äôs worth it because of the better rewards :)
---
I would suggest starting here:

---
I think Jetz probably meant to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs over-simplifying it‚Äù.
---
Looks good! Here are some thoughts where I'd like to improve it:
---
The arms and legs are way too purple. The original image only has slight tint. (which might even be from the environment?)
---
The hands and feet need some work. Fingers are too long and thin. Toes are too thin.
---
Side wing(?) could be little bigger, but blend more into the head.
---
Also bloodsail corsair.
---
are you saying that because chronologically she warns you earlier, that previous statement somehow supersedes the intended meaning of this phrase? no one says "I could care less", though many individuals do misstate it when trying to convey disinterest, which is exactly why it would make sense for this to be a mistake. It would be more in character for her not to care.
---
Luna + Nova isn't horrible either as zeph + shadowflame the following turn is not bad.
---
5 mana deal (at least) 2 aoe is pretty good in arena right now since removal is so rare without basic/classic cards.  Would be really bad without armor up though, which is pretty common since it's dual class currently.

Shaman quest was fine. I enjoyed meta before Wild cards came back. Now I enjoy it little less. Evolve and Kun were mistakes. Cards are completely busted and don't match power level of format right now. That fuckin rabbit is doppelgangster all over again, just 2 turns earlier. Mogu -&gt; mutate was already enough highroll. Now when I hear rabbit noise and see the coin or 1 floating mana, I am dying inside a bit. Board after board with constantly discovered evolve from ethereal lackey. 
---
Kun is no comments. Only "*My winged children fill the skies" is missing...* Juicy Psychmelon is still in standart, so Blizzard, please. Not enough power yet. We want Aviana! /s
---
Everything else is cool tho. Rogue is finally making a comeback to the meta. Priest have annoying, but viable deck aside from combo. N'zoth decks are cool. Highlander paly finally feels good. Very diverse meta, if you forget that shaman exist.
---
Your opinion cannot be objective. The enjoyability of something cannot be objective.
---
You've gotten so attached to your opinion, you consider it fact.
---
Clearly, twitch viewers don't agree, because they're not watching HS.
---
Within warrior class keening banshee is considered good. Unsure as to other classes and neutral in general.
---
you haven't played against murc pally? jesus man. if they get lucky, turn 3 you are dead by murlocs.
---
But zeus isnt even meta, Oh for a moment thouth this was my sv subfeed... move on
---
Yep, free hong kong.
---
Agreed. Some classes clearly got the short end of the stick. Imo, Warrior got it worst than Warlock. With Warlock you can fit the Imp in Zoolock, and have some fun with Renounce. Warrior's card? Varian's a niche card, and the other is overshadowed by Warrior's other control tools.
---
Same...

nzoth is cancerous as fuck man. especially on rogues. i usually just play arena now or adventure if i wanna just chill. lol

Oh, yea. It's been a while that too.

I quit blizzard games entirely but i'm still subbed. I can't really be bothered to unsub, i've spent so much time on blizzard games, I still want to see what's going on. But i'm never supporting them again.
---
To be fair, animation time shouldn't impact gameplay anyway. That's bad game design. The timer is there to make sure people don't afk or take too long, but if a long animation is limiting the amount you can play then something is wrong.
---
What's the OP's current Health and Fatigue counter? Depending on the answer, he could totally just trade the Mecha'thun and then let the fatigue finish his opponent off.

Even if obnoxious, it's entirely playing by the rules. It's not the best gameplay experience, but can't and shouldn't be punished.
---
I thought we were talking specifically about games made by Blizzard Entertainment. If you look at Acti-Blizz as a whole, the largest revenue share comes from Candy Crush, which is so big that it will make all their other games look small.
---
what has probably happened is that you have started to face meta decks. If you want an example of what the best decks look like you can checkout vicious syndicate or hsreplay. If you want someone to review your deck, just post it and we can give you feedback. 
---
Now I'm not too familiar with rank 20 meta, but I recall I threw together a budget curve druid deck and di fairly decent.
---
That‚Äôs draw, right?
---
Also, idk what Blizz was thinking when they printed Mysterious Challenger either. In its heyday meta it was an insanely strong curve bomb that sealed games on its own.
---
If you say you're queueing into so manny snipsnap warlocks at rank 5 in wild then you are wildly exagerating ,this late in the month i hardly see snipsnap
---
I noticed that when I played secret mage (in wild) I would get people roping every turn all the damn time against me but it never happens when I play other decks
---
Yeah, but to be fair, you can only use words from the Duden. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duden). which basically means you can't make up your own words, even if the German language would technically allow it.

It's exactly because it's not common that I feel it warrants a special animation.

i tapped even tho i didn't have any cards left in my deck i wanted to show dominance
---
This on top of all the PR and state of the game really makes me wanna quit but ive invested so much.
---
Doomhammer as well. Sul‚ÄôThraze to an extent as well.
---
Was this in a fever dream you were having?
---
They should just drop mobile support, imo. It's holding this game back so much.
---
Thats a 1/2 there big guy
---
&gt;I personally feel after trying to get back into Hearthstone that the buying of packs has just become something nobody does. When the game first came out I was buying packs and enjoying it immensely...now I‚Äôm just flat out refusing to spend my money on this garbage. 
---
Why don't you just speak for yourself instead of everyone? Plus, the people who post on reddit are hardly representative of the average Hearthstone player.
---
&gt;Expansions have added nothing but cycling out decent cards for copies that you have to pay for again. 
---
Have you ever looked at **any** other card game?
---
&gt; Wild mode is probably THE shittest of any mode I‚Äôve seen. 
---
You should've seen Modern during Eldrazi Winter.
---
&gt;How anyone plays games in this mode and finds it fun I‚Äôve got no idea, it‚Äôs just an insult to the cards that have been cycled into this mode. 
---
Some people like playing broken messes, and eternal formats are pretty much universally broken messes (at least relative to what can be done in the game's Standard format).
---
&gt; We are now left with crap expansions that are eventually free because people aren‚Äôt buying them. 
---
The only reason why the "quality" of expansions has seemingly "dropped" is because Hearthstone is just old enough for there to be a reference to almost *everything*.
---
Plus, pack and pre-order sales are up from last year as far as I am aware.
---
&gt;A ladder which is dominated by easy to pilot aggro decks 
---
The best of one format of regular ladder play, the casual audience for Hearthstone generally, and the fact a win is only ever counted as one win all combine to make aggression more popular on ladder.
---
Enabling aggressive strategies is also easier than enabling control strategies.
---
All aggro needs is efficient minions.
---
Control needs a good mix of efficient removal, defensive minions, healing tools, and card advantage engines to be even remotely playable.
---
&gt;I‚Äôv not met one control deck in 10 levels...disgraceful. 
---
Try being the change you want to see in the world, and play one of the dozen or so playable control or control-combo options.
---
Granted, a Standard environment with mostly aggressive and midrange-y Wild cards inserted into it is not going to be the best time to play control.
---
&gt;The next point will be reducing the card price because I sure as shit won‚Äôt be dropping any money on this game again. 
---
If Team 5 and Blizzard can't earn you're money, why would they even try to?
---
Evil is as evil does.
---
Pre nerf Call of the Wild
---
Turn 5 win the game. Seems fair to me.
---
A card being a legendary isn't about strength. It's a card that is either very unique (Sonya, Hakkar) or needs to be a 1 of for the purpose of balance (old gods, Oondasta). Not to say Blizzard hasn't misused the tag from time to time, but mere power is not a reason to make something legendary.
---
Yeah I posted that screenshot, support are pretty useless so don‚Äôt bother asking them lmao
---
People have suggested restarting  the game however that didn‚Äôt work for me. Mine fixed itself after a few days or so
---
That is a prayer fulfilled by RNJesus himself.
---
Wonder why they didn't print it at 7.
---
Did you say you were playing at legend in yesterday's rant?
---
&gt; if you want to play me no problem, ranked legend in the Uk pm me for battletag
---
Highmane is still comparable to a legendary, it's just that now it's more like [The Boom Reaver], when years ago it used to be more like [Tirion Fordring].
---
Same here, like the game and want to support the devs who work on the game (by playing it) but not blizzard (by not playing it)
---
I mean, GameSpot's article pretty much showed it was a far-left organization orchestrating a lot of this stuff. They're also organizing the protest at Blizzcon.  It's not the actual Blizzard fans or even video game fans doing this, but outside politicians and movements.  
---
Plus their Overwatch Halloween event tweet got like 80K likes.
---
Played Legend about 2 years ago :) feel free to add me and I‚Äôll show you my cardback. I really went off Hearthstone as the decks were becoming about cheese mechanics.
---
At this point it's a pretty fair deck compared to evolve bullshit
---
Someone said (albeit without listing a source) "iirc in development it started at 5 mana and was too good."
---
6 mana sounds fair.
---
ok you shoueld begin by knowing if you want to make a tempo, control, atrition deck from there. 
---
if you want tempo you might want well stated and strong minions that can win the board. psycho pomp and amet come to mind and since you have psycho injured minions might be good too, then the dragon can gave you a lot of tempo through rush and removal on battlecrys and a little bit of burst with alextrasza. 
---
if you want control or atrition, you want more boardclears and a bit of card draw and defensive minions maybe add an elysiana and have your dragons be removal too, as a win con maybe mass resurrect or inner fire might work making it easier with alex. in control decks i would also recommend knowing what decks are meta to choose your defensive options accordingly. For example when i built a control hunter back in oddrogue meta i added multishot to my deck since a lot of their minions were 3 health at least

Yes. Go get yourself kicked out complain on social about how you got kicked out after accomplishing  nothing, then you notice even if you didn't get kicked out you are protesting against a company at the other side of the world that can't do shit about Hong Kong being taken over.

Why not just come out and say "give tencent more money"?

Why do you want to get even more pack fillers though? At least this way it reads 'Get 100 dust'

You‚Äôre playing a combo deck that attempts to cheat mana and the Duel is a 2 of in a deck of 30. I played a game yesterday where all, all of my card draw was in the bottom 11 cards. 7 card draw cards were buried in the bottom 11. It happens sometimes and happens more so when your curve is imbalanced to force a combo like archetype.

Phase 2: Blizzard now boycott you!

That's why I save hex for them, I dont mind Sylvania as much, stealing my 1/1 lackies isn't too big of a heartbreak, plus Mc tech also helps, can't revive what never dies :P

This is where I'm at. I'm utterly disappointed in Blizzard and am definitely going to respond by not buying the next expansion, but I don't want to see the game die. I want to see Blizzard improve, but I *like* Hearthstone and would be sad if it disappeared. The people who are basically calling for everything to be burnt to the ground do not speak for me.

If the subreddit doesn't like it the rules can be changed to exclude it.

I remember a while ago before the nerf a lot of people suggested Gadgetzan Auctioneer being a legendary would be a good change.

Standard isn't that bad. I agree that Priest and Shaman feel like they are some unbeatable cancer decks and everybody are playing them. But that is not true. 
---
Shaman is the most played class, but is not tier 1 (but very close).
---
I've been playing Secret Highlander paladin, with a 75% winrate at rank 2. The global winrate is 57.69%, higher than all other decks.
---
And the best part, it is fun to play.

I've been [calling this out for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/94skrv/bw_drawing_boom_vs_toki/e3ordlp/), but I'm sure it was a tease for a future expansion.  
---
Honestly, [Toki's storyline write itself fairly easily](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b0ydrh/rafaams_goal_is_to_travel_back_in_time/eiipoz5/) when you take into account that Infinite Toki was trying to stop you from chasing Hagata out of her wood.

7k games here and only 3 "draws"

Its a little thing, but I'm still salty I can't use my golden ragnaros for this event.
---
I rarely play anything but single player anymore... so, yes.
---
This was the first Luna's Pocket Galaxy mage card with that same issue. Horrendously overcosted, horrendously unreliable - a big part of which was the cost itself and the chance of drawing X secrets by turn 8 - and, ultimately, it was set up to fail because it was just a spell.
---
We all know how Mysterious Challenger worked - Paladin's secrets, generally speaking, suck donkey balls, but because they came followed by Mysterious Challenger's body, they were a true force to be reckoned with. I guess Team 5 thought that, since Mage's secrets are - again, generally speaking - the strongest in the game, adding a body to them would break the card or something along those lines.
---
But you need the body - even the strongest secrets cast by themselves on turn 8 when you're behind with no board will not help you stall, recover or let alone eventually win the game.
---
For this card to work, it probably needed to be around the cost of Mysterious Challenger, so 6, but with a generally weaker body, because we'd have to keep Effigy, Splitting Image and the likes of Frozen Clone in mind, so we're talking something like a 3 or a 4 drop with an average 3/3 or 4/4 body to not be completely overpowered.
---
I still love what the card HOPED TO ACHIEVE, what it ENVISIONED, but ultimately never succeeded at - a NON-AGGRO Secret Mage deck, where this card would instead be used as a stalling/recovery tool. But because Team 5 is so fucking close-minded, Mage - just like everything in this game - always shoe-horned their classes to favor the most aggro versions of their decks.
---
Would I like to see this card changed? Yeah, but even if it was made good, it'd probably still suck in a vacuum, because there's little support for a non-aggro Secret Mage deck. Maybe you could make it work in Wild, but definitely not in Standard.

Your "bait-theory" is probably correct.
---
&gt;Like, some way to make a sandbox-ish experience once you've beaten all the Heroic wings. Let us reroll everything to make crazy, stupid combos.
---
That is exactly what I want :D
---
It really makes me think if they even tested the combo in play testing. Or if they were even aware it existed. Some of the board states shaman can create turn 4 are insane.
---
I. Fucking. Love it. Amazing piece of art you got there buddy!
---
Because typing your dumbass comment was definitely a great usage of your time
---
Well, usually if you play Paladin, you can at least hero power and buff your dudes. In this dual class run, I had a mage hero power, so I literally had nothing to buff
---
Well that‚Äôs just incorrect. Hate to break it to you but backstab + eviscerate + 2 mana leftover  for ‚Äúsome bodies‚Äù doesn‚Äôt deal with 3 random 4 drops on turn 4. Also if a 3/4 rush minion came down it got evolved to an 8 drop.

Are you playing to have fun or grind wins? 2 totally different things

Lol how you can even argue like this? üòÅ Instead of trying to ask you just run away cowardly mr nazi?üòÅ Where are all pathetic words you dummies like   to use defending your point?üòÅ Heh its actually expected from types like you that post topics "Fuck you blizzard" and "Im deleting my account"

One thing I can say

&gt; misplaced anger and pettiness in them

This nothing of those in my text. But more of them in these stupid topics you gays like to post in this sub few days ago. I understand you have small brain but can you actually learn not to talk for myself?

I would think that the deathrattles would trigger in the order they where played in. So wouldn‚Äôt the person who played mech-Cthun first win?

I beat this deck consistently with quest hunter and secret highlander pally.

Yeah in 2 months when the next expansion hits and the wild cards rotate.

What are you talking about? This is a card game, we are not going over an ethical dilemma in a philosophy course. 
---
There‚Äôs a class that has extremely powerful early combos which has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the decision making opportunities in this game, the core aspect that makes the game fun. 
---
The real issue, the game not being fun due to a lack of decision making opportunities being present consistently in the game currently due to overpowered early combos existing in a class that represents over 40% of matches (according to last VS report) can be fixed by nerfing one of the most problematic combo cards or by simply removing evolve from standard again. Not that complicated.

Diablo 2 *released on Mobile!*

People unpacked cards that couldn't be disenchanted. They are most likely wiping them from everyone's collection, and replacing them with their equivalents. That kind of script is probably fairly slow given the size of their database, and they might have done it in multiples step (safer that way).
---
lol alright

Wtf? Hearthstone isn't LOL...

*Almost* nobody routinely gets 7+ wins in arena, and most of the people who ‚Äúdo‚Äù are lying.
---
The fact that the opponent gains board control is true only to some decks (murlocs for example).  Even in that case you could hope to use starfall and than heal and there are plenty of cars that give tons of armor. And the quest does not say: do not use mana at all, stop pretending it‚Äôs like that. You just have to play cards that cost one less than your opponents and keep that crystal (that‚Äôs not so ‚Äúslow‚Äù to justify all the gain after imo). I play also wild and I have some decks that really play no card until turn 5/6. That are slow

&gt; Nothing even vaguely related to the censorship/political issues that have exploded recently. No designated protest areas where people can make themselves be heard without disrupting the event.
---
Tell me that you're joking. Why would they ever do that? It would just bring back the topic they want everyone to forget (and are on a good way for that to happen) and encourage people to protest. That wouldn't even be shooting their own foot, that would be going straight for the head.
---
All they need to do is censor 45 minutes of questions without making it look like censorship. Just give a moderator a stack of cards. long question intros from fans would also help. Too bad 'For the horde' is a political statement
---
There will most likely be no protests inside building, you have to own ticket (quite expensive, they sold out a looooong ago before Blitzchung incident happend). When Blizzard started to sell those tickets, especially WoW was not in a good state (pre 8.2 pre classic) and many ppl were angry that you have to buy those tickets via phone app and install "spyware" to your device to be able to attend Blizzcon. They still all sold almost instantly. So considering all of this, only the most hardcore and loyal Blizzard fans got their tickets and they probably wont care about any inside protests at all, they want to have fun. Plus there is of course security checking all atendees at entrance.
---
I‚Äôm pretty happy to hear that things have been ironed out like that! I never realised that, because I played hunter mainly, and Tundra Rhino can give Charge to basically any minion you‚Äôll need.
---
Then there‚Äôs also King Krush. Who the Brann from SoU spawns too! But he‚Äôs legendary so I see why that was done
---
im enjoying the duel arena, thats the only game mode i've been playing last 2 weeks.

Dude you‚Äôre the one playing merry go round with semantics. ‚ÄúIt does matter to fix the right thing‚Äù. That‚Äôs you‚Äôre argument; you provided no evidence and no reason behind why you said that. What you said is correct, fixing the right thing matters but just stating that literally adds no value to this conversation since you‚Äôre not providing anything to back it up and when I asked I get back ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt have data, I‚Äôm not a dev.‚Äù

well im pretty sure about my 6 rn, but i lose some because its like between 5-7 not like 3 and then 9

he honestly looks adorable

&gt; you provided no evidence and no reason behind why you said that. What you said is correct
---
Holy shit! It's like talking to 3 different people with 3 different PoVs all at once.
---
No I completely agree. I wasn't implying anyone in particular could do it routinely, that's just the threshold at which playing arena becomes purely profit. I only bother playing with free tickets because I'm lucky to get past 5
---
It is reasons like that that I am seriously questioning if these commenters are real people, or if it is some other corporation looking to cash in on Blizzard hate. I know that sounds paranoid. But who believes this stuff?
---
They are upset that Blizzard followed the law in China?.... Um alright then, guys. We going to be getting rid of our iPhones and other electronics too then? You realize Apple also adheres to the law in China, right? 
---
People jump off the rooftops of buildings that Apple owns because they are worked so hard they want to kill themselves. 
---
Have you ever heard of anyone who wants to boycott apple? Didn't think so.
---
Ive seen drops of 5% at best after this mess. Now thats something but not nearly enough to justify what some people did on reddit expecting what?  Apology? (Real one) They messed up badly but they did it for a reason.  To keep china in. What do you all expect that they throw it away? Especially after losing a lot of trust and loyal players on EU side? There is what i think. Even if every single player on EU left after this it would still be right to do what they did. China is huge. And generates more than EU ever will. I know i am oversaying this but lets be real if 1% of eu players dropped off it would be bigger deal than it is now.
---
What i am trying to say is get over it. They hurt your feelings blizzard bad china bad but what were they supposed to do. And what are they supposed to do now. Eighter play or dont why do we still hear about this all the time. Its good to bring attention but im sure that if someone were to hear about it on hs reddit he already did. Go somewhere else if u feel like it
---
Can it beat Infinite Nzoth rogue running 2 schemes though?
---
Not just evolve, a few other cards are making it a fair bit worse than the post-nerf meta.  Not that it's absolutely awful, but it's definitely not one of the better ones for sure
---
Known issue, they are working on it not sure when it will be patched
---
Just beautiful. Jaina too.
---
I thoroughly support this
---
pretty sure one Friday Coming Soon will be general WoW expansion info, and then a saturday one will be more focused on system details, like class changes and whatever, usually how it goes.
---
Nice!  What are you gonna craft with the dust from that golden quest?
---
Well you have to build a meme deck to play it
---
You realize that costs 6 mana and is also a 2 card combo so it literally has no advantage over evolve + desert hare or mogu which is going to come out 2 turns earlier.
---
Its the difference between 4 and 6 mana. At 4 mana maybe your opponent play a taunt or a rush. At 6 mana your opponent dragonfire potions you board
---
I think that with the removal of buckets that will change, decks won't be as consistent in quality. Aggro requires less quality than control to draft.
---
Sonya has broken enough things Shaku is way safer.
---
Maybe they were worried about Warrior being too strong.
---
Yeah exactly. I'm not opposed to the people who are supporting the movement. I'm in favor of the movement.
---
My comment was pointing out that people who were like "Okay fine give these whiners a few days" are probably now like "yeah I don't give a fuck about your human rights cause it's not going to go anywhere, your comments no longer deserve to be seen here".
---
So... Yeah, they literally are fed up with human rights. They never actually cared about the movement, they just wanted it to pass by. And now that a week has passed, anyone who tries to bring it up is going to be "overstaying their welcome" in the eyes of these people.
---
In my experience evolve has been the most frustrating to play against and there‚Äôs no playing around it or anything. All the other wild cards there‚Äôs at least some counter play most classes are capable of.
---
Was it made in China though because not going to lie that would be funny
---
I've been running a hand lock list and it's solid against shaman.  
---
  
---
Loses to pretty much everything else though.
---
I mean you can get turn 2 10/10 Edwins so it's not that big of a deal. I don't Sonya is too scary, although the devs might not want to think about working around her.
---
They‚Äôre probably gonna bust out the big guns so everyone will forget
---
Edwin has pretty consistently been on the list of "classic legendaries that might need a HoF replacement" given that he's shown up in every world champion's decks
---
Cool thanks for that info! I think I remember him saying something about Pogos easily becoming like 30/30s? That sounds awesome yet terrifying lol.
---
I think Archbishop could potentially warp metas. You have to consider it was in standard alongside the un'goro quests and death knight hero cards. It's a huge amount of resources. I love playing him in wild, but he doesn't always belong in standard.
---
As a temporary addition? could be cool!
---
It goes left-to-right. There's a patch where that got changed.
---
Well, if that was the case, I would say they missed the mark horribly as currently Warrior sits on the bottom of class representation, only ahead of Warlock which is a class that desperately needed some help in the patch but instead got Renounce Darkness because...reasons.
---
I just stopped harthstone when they annonced thorissan and nzoth. Then with the HK drama I decided to not go back
