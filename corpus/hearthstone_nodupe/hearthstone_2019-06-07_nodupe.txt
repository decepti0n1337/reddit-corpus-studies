&gt;at the same time it might convert paying players to stop giving money as they are making better gold now.
---

---
That's a fair point. Though I do think 6 extra packs a month is unlikely to be the thing that transitions spenders to f2p, but again, I can't say for sure.
---
With existing f2p players, blizzard won't be losing anything if they stay f2p since they were never getting their money anyway. Though, I guess you could argue this makes them more likely to theoretically stick as f2p, but I think they'd specifically need an incentive to go from f2p -&gt; spender, and this change doesn't interfere with that condition.
---
---
---
Heroic Dadghar was pretty brutal. Sacked it out with a turn 3 Rin with robes into a t7 Azari but even then I felt the pressure hard. The raw amount of card generation him, Vargoth and Kalec pack makes their fights tricky even when you think you've got them topdecking.
---
I agree now that i completed the whole chapter 5. It's a good adventure.
---
But then what was the point of chapter 1,2,3 and 4 then ? The whole adventure IS the chapter 5
---
To be fair, first play thru of the brawl was a win because that totem was buffed to hell and had windfury.
---
Even if it did, would they kill the second because you still have all 4?

I never in my life wished I could talk to someone more. I sware 90% of my teams mates never played this brawl before or are intentionally trying to lose.
---
Get lucky and find your control tools was how to play those decks. Jade druid was a bit of head scratcher in the mirror tho
---
Ya I'd love it if they gave more gold. But 100% still staying f2p until there's real change. 
---
Iast thing I ever bought was adventures. That was fair value for the consumer and worth the 20 bucks imo. And that's exactly why blizzard got rid of it lol.
---
Thanks for trade
---
That's what i meant with the (pls don't do it with that order), so maybe people notice this before actually doing it in game.
---
Thank you for the perfection!

*Laughs in APM Priest*
---
Good question. It could trigger whole the time or just once when the fourth one is being summoned
---
This is one of the better times for new players to start. Recent changes make sure that new players get a lot of packs when they first start, on that climb from rank 50 to rank 25, and during that climb you're only competing against other new players. Also, we're in the first expansion after an annual rotation, which means that Standard mode only has cards in it from four expansions (plus Classic/Basic).
---
So people aren't that far ahead of you in terms of collections, and you only need one deck anyway to do well. Also, "expensive decks" doesn't mean "good decks". You can climb with cheap decks that you'll definitely have enough gold to make once you make it to Rank 25. Like the other post said, Hunter is a good starting class, as it has some strong cheap decks that are fairly straightforward to play, or you could go the Whizbang route.
---
She used Conjourers Calling on her Turn on my 1-Drop, lol.

Rank 20 and getting the same decks as you for the most part. The Paladin one didn't have Silver Sword.
---
We need skulkinger geist (battlecry: destroy each player's deck)
---
Yeah I stopped purchasing the pre-orders with this set for the first time because I finally convinced myself that it wasn't necessary or worthwhile. Adventures in their previous state would still be auto-purchases from me, provided they weren't all garbage cards, but yeah, that is no more, unfortunately.
---
Haha - [hell yeah](https://i.imgur.com/VwEbaUC.png)
---
Yea
---
Zoolock is and wasn’t ever hard, holding back minions before they aoe was about as hard as it gets. 
---
Deadman’s hand warrior was just bad, mill rogue on the other hand was actually a hard deck to pilot that could be good in the right meta 
---
Jade druid was only ever hard in the mirror, everywhere else was just draw rng.
---
I second this
---
Means for each turn where you keep it in your hand it upgrades.
---
First it's 1 1/1, then it's 2 1/1, then it's 3 1/1 and so on. Obviously it's capped at 7 eventually cause that's how many minions you can have on the board. 
---
But that's how Scheme cards work.
---
Super fun combos and scenarios that you can only achieve after 6 months of grinding every day as a f2p player. 
---
It’s a great way for new players to experience the game at its best.
---
I find the larger the sample size the better.  
---
For example when looking at only a specific deck you can't see how it performs against other decks (last time I checked this was a pay only option) so you can't be sure how well that win rate is reflective of the entire meta.  
---
Granted a deck like the old token druid that had 99% of the druid matches was obvious.
---
Done, thanks!
---
vs has quite a lot less data and I do wonder if the swing as a result is enough to drop a decks win rate a couple of % which seems to be a pretty big deal in this game.  
---
I recall seeing vS having negative win rate matchups for a deck vs another deck where as HSReplay had a positive win rate ... it was quite interesting as in that case I'd trust HSReplay over vS.
---
Bug 100
---
How do you make decks though?.....
---
No because that’s a fuck ton of dust
---
Only played the Brawl once so far. I was Shaman and he Priest. Honestly had the best partner I could ask for. Ended up between us buffing a King Muka to 62/87 with windfury and the spell that makes it heal for 4 each time it attacks. Fucking baller.
---
All fair points I'm just surprised you think an extra 15 gold would change your behaviour.
---
Are you saying then that don't get the 10 gold a day for 3 wins?  
---
I also am not certain that offering 15 more gold for the first 3 will really entice people to push forward for the remaining 27 as that's really no different to now.
---
Meme-ories?
---
What change (within reason) would have you spend money then?
---
Awwww
---
complete opposite, I beat it warlock second try.  First aid kit + hero power that summons a 2/2 demon carried me
---
Pretty sure the auto-complete makes legend decks. I know this because the auto-complete for Hooktusk was the exact list, card for card that I took to top 20 legend a few days prior. 
---
I think that it looks at lists at high legend, filters for above 'x' sample size, and then makes that the auto-complete list. I've been meaning to test this by just throwing a random card into a strong list and taking it to high legend. Would be pretty neat to see the auto complete list create a regular looking deck + a chillwind yeti in there lol.
---
Man, im so fucking happy, just got a Golden Malygos from the golden pack in the end of the adventure ahahaha.
---
I can concur with this to a degree personally.  
---
See I am playing Druid now because I want to hit my 500 wins for Druid. Not because it's the deck I most want to play.  
---
With no carrot like that I would play less I'm sure.
---
Is that old joke still a thing?  Highmane isn't even run in beast focused decks, it's far from a "legendary power" card.
---
Prep Coin Concede
---
You tip 15-20% like a normally socially adjusted adult. Jesus Christ this is pure cringe.
---
Turns out emerald goggles are pretty great with sound the bells.
---
That looks really cool :D
---
Trial and error. Make sure the cards/treasures you pick have synergy with each other.
---
I was staring at this for the longest time “seeing” it move hahaha, love this game. I think I’m tired.
---
Oof. Thank you bunch for keeping the subreddit from getting so clogged, must be torture after a while lmao
---
 No problem!
---
I beat her easily with Rakanishi thanks to the treasure of using your hero power twice and reduce it 1 mana along with the 1 mana reduce card hero power. I was able to spam my high mana cards on her
---
Yeah I've had some bad players too. Thankfully today the first one I got a real good player and we cruised to victory.
---
Elistra the Almost Immortal
---
If you make your own decks its never wasted dust. The amount of fun I have with strange cards is worth way more
---
So, kaley never used his hero power vs me.  He kept just temping out minions.  I think I killed him with +3 spell damage.
---
I don't have Lady in White, is Unpowered still worth it to include in the deck? And what would I replace them with?
---
Hell no I may be immortal but fuck me if I am living in this weather. Nope not today
---
some people seem to think buffing multiple things is the way to go, just for a 6 damage aoe to take them all out instead of leaving a single beefy guy.
---
Ah, Zeno’s Paradox. http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52507.html
---
It seems that the condition, even if worded slightly differently, would work the same for both Reckless and Portal.
---
Although Reckless + Mechwarper doesn't bring Snip Snap down to zero mana like portal does. Go figure ...
---
But not extra dust
---
Use a flying machine as your mech target, or a bunch or bombs that you can Enhance a mechano for a windfury.
---
Guess they filed your hearthstone gold tax returns for the last 5 years finally.
---
They are bots, you dummies
---
Had mine stolen with mana bind and swung in with a taunter into iceblock
---
The boss stopped at +15/30 though, bliz must have capped infinite boss turns
---
And what's the last 1/10?
---
The number of games where Pogos don't even get a chance to get large before the game is decided?
---
I meant Grand Masters* , but yeah it's looking like there are 5 or so cyclone mages this weekend. Especially in the Americas. So hopefully you can catch them!
---
Oooh, will try it for sure, i play mostly on mobile and it's sad have less one deck. I watch kripp's video today and he used the taunt mech who cannot be target, seens good to do on mobile to.
---
He can double research project with one of his elementals (or even triple if one sticks) for refill.
---
Not sure if he maindecked research project, or got it from one of his random spell generators though.
---
Ouch
---
Come to the poolside gathering at the very leaT and say hi!!
---
For those unclear what cards do:
---
Untold splendor shuffles 5 random treasures into your deck. In this case, Grimmer Patron is a random treasure
---
Surrender to Madness gives all your minions +2+2 and destroys 3 mana crystals
---
Grimmer Patron copies itself end of turn. He pulled a duplicating, buffed legendary on his second turn.
---
Which means it could totally happen in normal gameplay. Neat.
---
Okay cool thank you very much.
---
So did you actually read the title of the post you’re linking to, or do you ignore everything that is inconvenient to you?

Oh no how will you ever deal with a mirror image
---
Taunt minions man they're invincible
---
You're there minding your own business using your otk combo only to discover one of those bad boys was in the field
---
However could you have prevented this it's impossible I say
---
Once they play mirror image the game is over you can never use otk combo again
---
Thanks :)
---
The picture could've spoken a lot more if you showed your hand and the action log though.
---
I broke it quite harder and its pretty easy to do. The basic deck for paladin has the echo spell "Ring the bells" (or something like that) that gives +1/+2 buff. With Bob you can reduce the cost of a spell by 3, making that an otk with any minion that can go face. EZ lethal turn 2 with a 1 drop :)
---
Seems fair
---
Yea, but it's cool having a golden one now and at least I've got one copy to play with ;)

How would big game hunter echo? As far as I’m aware all echo minions are like ghosts or ghostly except snip snap
---
Both don't work. :(
---
It works on my other phone that does not have the stealth patch.
---
It definitely has a ton of replay value. Each class has three hero powers and four decks (one of which is random), so that's 12 combinations per class. Every wing has a different twist that makes it unique, and there's also the Anomaly mode, where there's a crazy effect for both sides. I don't know how many different Anomalies there are, but it's at least 10.
---
Is number 6 Liadrin? I seriously couldn't recognize her.
---
now try it with a priest Seance and Gnomish Army Knife :D
---
I got that Swamp Scheme treasure card to turn your minions into legendaries. Then Bob made it cost 0. 
---
It basically has echo, so after I managed to get 2-3 minions on board I could just zap them over and over and over and over. 
---
I had also selected the potion of vim, so I was drawing cards like crazy. And in 2 of the taverns I banished 9 minions so I was basically guaranteed to draw a few cheap spells, a few 1-2 drops, and the treasure spell.
---
I’d say the number is even higher because of the Hunters.
---
I started buffing a minion. Nef swapped hands and he immediately used the only inner fire in the deck when it had 16 health.
---
So what’s the best class to beat heroic wing 5?
---
Oh look I’m so sad that my super greedy control warrior deck has the chance to loose versus a deck that has the 45% winrate... 
---
Blizzard pls nerf!!! We can’t have fun, just 20+ minutes matches of removals, armor and more removals, amirite???
---
That’s why everyone who complains about FUCKING POGO ROGUE sounds.

I broke the Heist by choosing Paladin, selecting the _"Card on the Left in Your Hand Costs 2 Mana Less"_ treasure, and opting for the deck which includes [Sound the Bells](https://c-2rtwjumjzx7864x24lfrjujinfx2ehzwx78jhisx2ehtr.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3_c-2mjfwymx78ytsj.lfrjujinf.htr_/c-2RTWJUMJZX64x24myyux78x3ax2fx2flfrjujinf.hzwx78jhis.htrx2fmjfwymx78ytsj_lfrjujinfx2f4x2f41x2fXtzsi_ymj_Gjqqx78x2576x257334827x2574.uslx3fajwx78ntsx3d6g9jh34f352324219kk32i5934jih782_$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.dv=16).

Lol do you even play Hearthstone? Pogo Rogue just punishes the greediest decks (and still can loose against Bomb Warrior). It’s not even Tier 1 and is awfully bad compared to Midrange Hunter, Conjurer Mage or any tipe of Control Warrior. It’s just a great meme.
---
Regardless of whether the deck is good or not, both legendaries you have to craft for it are top tier neutrals that see play in a variety of decks. So it's a win win if you look at it that way
---

Didn't read, sorry.

Got a golden Al'Akir on my first ever golden pack. Feelgoodman.
---
I think this is intentional and not a bug I figured this out before. The Ai just dont recognize that the first instance of the spell is the deal 2 damage  and the second is heal for 5 so if you hit a minion with 2 or less health with that spell, the spell will check after the first instance if the target is still alive, if it is dead there is no target the interaction you mean is with lifesteal weapons right? There is probably no check in between and this is just one progress due to the usage of a keyword. So it just deals damage and heals you for that much noch check in between. I would assume that the check between the two instances is duevto the keyword choosen one were only one side is normally intended.

Blocks on instance of damage. So it will block 1 damage or 100 damage, as long as it is happening at the same time.

To be honest, most of the days I don't even care if I win three games a day, because it's not worth the time to earn ten gold.
---
Righteous Protector turn 1. What! Do! You! Do!
---
Yeah this is what they talk about when they say "design space."  Cards like this prevent them from printing cards that would be cool without that specific interaction.
---
The classic example is [[Master of Disguise]], the card was never powerful, but they ended up nerfing it because it severely limited the types of static effects they could put in the game.
---

4/4/4 | Battlecry: Give a friendly minion Stealth until your next turn.  
---
It only took me two tries, thankfully, but both times the gargoyle came out super late. #feelsbadman
---
I've heard the gold packs have a separate pity time than normal packs.
---
When I had my 1/1 silver hand recruit on the board and he hits it with 5 meteors buffed by malygos. That was literally the one time where I physically said “PLEASE STOP HES ALREADY DEAD!”
---
Divine shield blocks one attack. The 30 damage attack that Nefarian does is one blast, so divine shield can block it. It's not 30 damage split between all minions.
---
They really need to implement an "I'm sorry I know what to do my draw is terrible" emote for this one.
---
Wait a couple turns ;)
---
You just missed the previous meta where Control Warrior was the 2nd most common deck from ranks 5 - Legend and in tourneys.
---
Agreed, that seems to be the best one to buff. You dont have to do much special, to keep it growing, whereas the gargoyle you have to save a lot of cards to get it above 30 for the big wipe, and it can be tricky if you dont draw things in the right order. But both players have one of the 3/3's, so you are much more likely to get the ball rolling on that.
---
I did beat it once with the 3/4 that gets divine shield when you cast a spell on it, managing to use just one buff spell on it each turn before attacking, and just before the board clears.
---
I like these co-op brawls but they make scream sometimes.
---
At first glance I thought it was an order lul moment. That would have been hilarious!  😂
---
I've been beating it with straight-up control warrior. You just have to prioritize pushing damage.
---
FYI it does *not* work with echo cards. The first cast will be cost-reduced but after that it's normal. I thought I was a genius using 0-cost echo spells in a priest deck but ended up disappointed.
---
&gt;75/80
---
You gotta pump those numbers up, baby, those are rookie numbers!
---
Me and my teammate last night were clearly on the same wavelength, because we actually stopped attacking Nef at all until we go the dragonstalker up to like 150/150
---
Also. Only six minions people. Not seven!!!!
---
number of downloads is an important stat on its own.
---
for the curious ones: [Commander Bolan](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dalaran-Heist-Commander-Bolan-1.jpg)
---
What’s funny is I had that paladin deck with sound the bells and even in 25 seconds I had enough time to buff one creature big enough that I ticked her down in two turns.
---
I completed Warlock during launch of The Lich King boss fight.
---
And its way easier to buff him up when Nef is only doing 5 damage each round, instead of 10.  As long as you buff him above 4 right as you drop him (to avoid swipe) you are golden.
---
That was announced weeks ago.
---
I don't understand how this can be a repost, literally filmed it off my own gameplay 10 minutes before posting it .. sent a mod message looking for clarification! Thanks!
---
Based af
---
Or shamans who never play sideshow. Then spent all game healing themselves at 30hp instead of priest.

---
I found the 3/4 that get's divine shield when targeted good. As long you give it divine shield before Nefarion clears the board you're golden.
---
It’s just a geometric series.
---
I thought they were “keeping an eye on it” - not that they were definitely going to nerf it.
---
guess ur gonna have to unsub here too
---
Well, I guess you thought wrong.
---
I have 20 wins on this brawl. Having an opponent who knows what they are doing is too easy. You can,t lose. Playing around your opponent and still winning that is the challenge. You can win even after some serious screw ups if you durect the show.
---
Admittedly can be hard if you are shaman and the priest player is mentally challenged.
---
Lmaaooo
---
Pretty sure it’s not even a card game
---
I'm with you on this one
---
But what changed tho?
---
15g a win and that satisfies the OC people with leftover 5g from Arena!
---
We buffed the funnel cakes guy and managed to easily win
---
&gt;  secret secret secret
---
well she played two secretkeepers to start and crushed my dreams pretty easily since they both had like 9 attack
---
I play both pretty casually. Dailies and some ladder grinding for packs/golden epic. I find that as a generally f2p player that I’ve been able to build more competitive decks with mtga.
---
I obsessively mouse over the hero power and the minion that needs to be healed if my opponent doesn't do the obvious right play. Funny/ awesome thing is after some doubt they then usually do it.
---
Times he number of similarly cool combinations, probably?
---
Is this a joke? I avoided that minion like the plague. Focused on the 4 mana 0/7 that heals both hero with any heal. Once you get one on both sides any amount of heal fully heals each hero. It’s also a cheap way to get a high health minion that you buff with inner fire. 
---
In my one game, we got one on each board to fully heal each hero with one hero power, then buffed one of em to 52/52.
---
This isn't out of nowhere though...the nerf hammer is identical to the announcement made weeks ago due to Sn1p-Sn4p infinite damage in standard (timestamp could be Disguised toast's last farewell to her crazy combos with mechathun)
---
Does hovering work on a touchscreen? Cause I aggressively hover whenever someone isn't getting it yet never see results
---
I got justicar as shaman and used it to spam healing stream totems to soak damage and heal our main minion to kill the boss. Work alright for us.
---
I did that, but then my opponent never attacked with it for some reason. Eventually, he filled his board with totems and the boss destroyed the massive gargoyle. I decided that was the time to concede.
---
You would have 7 attack ready arbitrarily big minions turn 2 with just playing Sn1p-sn4ps. Sn1p-sn4p starts in his opening hand and costs 0.  
---
Only thing I can think of (other than crazy unlikely scenarios) for less than 5 mana would be Mass Dispel, which I have seen run.
---
Yo Dawg...
---
I cant even particularly remember him. Unfortunately I cant recall what deck I used. I just cleared him along with the rest of the bosses when they came like all the other solo content. Some bosses may have taken a couple of tries, sure, but I only used meta styled decks from that time with perhaps some minor tweeks. 
---
Does he have an heroic mode I havent done perhaps? Is that the boss in question perhaps?
---
Holding your finger on the card
---
That’s why you just sit back and build him up until he’s over 30 toughness.
---
Two words. TGolden Candle. Delete all of his spells and his hero power becomes "summon a river croc". Both times I've beaten Khadgar so far involved Golden Candle + Togwaggle's Dice.
---
Report it to blizzard.
---
True. That's why I try to optimize drawing the cards from the priest deck, so if gargoyle or the +1/+1 girl are the bottom of the shaman deck it is still winnable
---
The moment someone takes offensive action against you in a coop brawl you leave immediately.
---
Can we get some more jpeg?
---
We just buffed the card that gains +1/+1 whenever a card is played. The gargoyle didn't turn up
---
Just wanna say nice work on the card cropping
---
Ours comrade
---
That is like the best thing. Just recruit the biggest minions, playing two rags in a turn is enough to win you a game. 
---
Obviously bad example, but I finished many runs with it. Big /expensive minions, in half the price. Drop all cheap cards.
---
Honestly this deck feels as oppressive against control as Caverns below was. No match up should just be auto win without anything you can tech in to save you.
---
Kalecgos has stopped all of my runs so far, idk how to deal with constant board clears
---
It's like trying to buff the attack of a Lightspawn.
---
Khadgar used it multiple times on my [[Shirvallah, the Tiger]]. Certainly made the fight easier!
---
I'm doing a hunter run with double Battlecries anomoly right now. Emeriss always starts in my hand and costs 5. Hope it's enough to carry me through Ch5.
---
Blizzard and giving stuff? Pfff
---
As said, it's illogical to not use busted but legal mechanics to win, especially when you're just trying to clear it for the first time.
---
Besides, that does not respond to the other two situations...
---
Yes! Two of my three wins (out of 4 games) were by buffing the Gargoyle or that card. The game I lost, I desperately tried to tell my mate to buff the gargoyle by hovering over it and targeting it with spells (without casting them) while saying "well played". 
---
He used his divine spirits on that 4/3/3 that gives windfury.
---
Funny how you go from talking about the "worst iterations of" to current forms depending on what suits your argument.

25/7/5 Beast | Divine Shield, Rush, Lifesteal Costs (1) less for each Mana you've spent on spells.  
---
I only beat those guys because of Rin summoning Azari
---
I think all the dragons can transform into humans but I'm not sure
---
Exactly. They are talking a lot about it lately. Board clear is not something a Rogue should use.
---
A question was "Is it possible, some cards might rotate in the middle of the year?" Mike Donais answered, they usually HoF cards as part of yearly rotation, but if they feel, it has to be done, they might as well make an exception and Vanish is such an example.
---
So did Nef immediately died or he still enter immunity and change phase?
---
yeah the gargoyle is easiest because it's possible to have it survive the AOE though that's not too easy to do.
---
No. You win....
---
Probably I got "unlucky" and got the "double health". It let me survive longer to pull my strategy, or was my strategy based on larger health?  I really thought I was a goner, but did manage.
---
I cheesed Chapter 5 heroic with Emerald Goggles + Sound the Bells!
---
stop whining and play a counter ? there are dozens of it. Since when wild is about interactive deck that answers each other , have you met mill rogue or odd palladin, both goldfish and could be played by a bot, yet for some reasons rank 25 haters only whine on big priest...
---
git gud ?
---
I'm quite sure this card would still see a lot of play if it was 3 mana today.
---
Things I like to do for fun:
---
Get all the way up to the end of this boss fight, and then concede.
---
I’m on my lunch hour and this is when I usually play. 🤬
---
Who and when? The devs have never even confirmed the existence of a pity timer.
---
Just my luck the only time Khadgar used it on me, Hir’eek is what I got. :(
---
( I had a full board so no 2nd creature)
---
Wait. One more thing must be true. 
---
NA or EU? 
---
Cause only NA gets packs.
---
I have 12 wins left for a golden priest portrait so I may try it.

ok thank god i thought it was just my connection

I’m sure this has something to do with the big fancy tournament in Las Vegas they’ve asked us to fund.

I do. I just slaughter them with Exodia Mage. Fun times.

Are there any viable paladin decks currently?

*Wow*
---
ftfy
---
First match: partner attacks my taunt totem and heals nefarion.  “Yea this guy doesn’t know what he’s doing”
---
Second match: EZ victory with a skilled partner
---
*golf clap* well played, old chap, well played indeed
---
Excuse my ignorance, but by Deathrattle are you talking about mechanical whelps? Because the highest winrate version is all about bombs and those are fairly easy to clear if you have a relatively responsive deck like midrange hunter I would think.
---
I fuck them with jade druid
---
Nice to see its not just me.
---
Can confirm, N.A. server are down.
---
I really wished that they would've let us chose... I don't like golden cards. Well, I mainly don't like the mix and can't afford all golden decks.
---
Same. 15 minute is static. Must be down
---
You could theoretically include infinite animations, assuming the original length is less than half the length of the turn. Max length=1/(1-r) where r is the factor that the length is multiplied by each iteration. With your example, r=0.5 so the max length=2 (twice the length of the first animation. You could use a larger r, say 0.75, to make the change in length less distinct. Then the max length is just 4x the length of the original animation.
---
Same here.  Been "in line" for 35+ minutes.
---
Or rope Nefarian until he rage concedes xD
---
I tried this brawl once and then quit when my fucking teammate gave windfury to his 2/6 minion instead of my 11/11.
---
It was easy for me cuz I got Alexstrasza from Bob and then got right hand man on her.  Alex is pretty busted when your opponents start with 80+ health
---
I was about to beat the last chapter of the heist and this happens
---
I’ve never lost to a jade Druid
---
Same here. Just opened up on lunch break :(
---
Did you try turning it off and back on again?
---
Mine says a 483 minute wait..
---
He also has negative karma, so....
---
Will you be having the Bomb Warrior tonight sir?
---
Yeah try it. I went 8-7, when you have a good start it is really hard for some decks to take the board but it can also be very frustrating deck to play :)
---
Damn you right
---
I don't think, making a rare instead of an epic is anywhere close to causing diarrhea and vomiting.
---
Would you be happy if one of the rares of this set would become an epic?
---
I don't even see why people care about this, but there was a question and an answer, so that appeared in this post.
---
As long as there isnt a 460 minute queue time for it, I'm down.
---
Yea and it's awful. Happened right in the middle of NA Master's Qualifiers so now we're all waiting to see what happens next :(
---
I'm so mad at my idiocy against Kalec in a paladin run. I finally settled him down, took control of the board with him top decking. (It was a pretty absurd paladin run, able to turtle just about everything by being able to fill the board with 7 minions every turn) Then ignoring his secret I played the treasure that dealt 20 damage...which he got a copy of and killed me with. 
---
In most of these runs having one big creature like that henchmen is not great, it's being able to continually fill the board. Especially as late as turn 5. If you can get him out turn 1-2 he might swing enough tempo, but turn 5 you better have a lot more planned than just one creature.
---
Isn't Big Priest one of Jade Druid's worst matchups?
---
Everyone took a day off.
---
Same here. As far as I know it’s only NA having this issue
---
Inb4 he plays kalecgos and discovers cabalists tomr
---
A TURTLE HAS MADE IT TO THE WATER
---
The cycle of life can be cruel....
---
That’s server for “I don’t know lol”
---
I’ve had it lower the cost of cards before but more often it does increase
---
He asked me to get him some bear livers, but none of the bears I killed had livers so he got confused and gave up.
---
I can't login either. "Estimated wait time: 463 minutes."

Most of what he does seems to swing either way, except adjusting the cost of cards, out of the 19 times I've had him do it, it's always been an increase.
---
I know right, I’ve started to realize recently especially with that post about cr1tikal’s video on that Australian guy and the esports teams that reddit is full of complete brainlets that have to argue every little thing even if it isn’t relevant to the original comment for no fucking reason
---
What happened to me on my first run was that I had the Treasure thar shuffles 10 Scrolls of Wonder into your deck, and their animation apparently eats into the turn timer. I had probably less than 5 seconds for my first turn.
---

---
Only if 3 vargoths have died tho
---
Because we all know how little money HS makes. The devs are barely scraping by!
---
Generally this is why I don't like playing mech decks. It depends on curve more than other decks but still better than 40 min warrior games lol.
---
Well you can always disenchant it and craft it normal?
---
Robes + ring of 5 legendaries. 5 rag lightlords on turn 4 is stronk
---
Wierd, i've seen people casting infinite sound the bells
---
Mech and OTK.
---
pfft, you must not be playing with right people. poison seed and starfall people concede
---
I had the classic 0 mana sound the bells too, however, for the final boss I'm pretty sure the cost was changed back to 2. Anyone know why that could be?

Not sure why you're being downvoted, you're completely right. Someone subbed to Hearthstone isn't going to try that game.

---
Lmao, this is pretty great
---

---
I would say unlikely but I wouldnt mind being wrong
---
Free advertisement for a copyright lawsuit
---
This is such a cheesy fight. The time limit would have no impact if secret animations weren't so slow. It feels stupid cause you aren't playing against the deck so much as the coding.
---
Depends whether they have a top hand.  Those without are unaccepable.
---
Nope. Hearthstone is part of my lunch, I look forward to it every morning.

How can he kill your minions, when Nef has taunt?

Oh yeah I agree they certainly can shut that nonsense down in their local market. I still stand firm that China give no fucks about IP anywhere lol
---
The comments in here and my own experience really don't make me believe in the "random" effects anymore.
---
It stop once the first target die regardless of what is left on board, and bouncing blade just skip immune target.   If you have two minion (1 immune, 1 not), it's just going to bounce on the non-immune.

Almost 4hrs later, never seen anything like it. Xbox and other servers alike don’t let this problem persist for over 30 min! Wth blizzard
---
Hello! Hello! Hello!
---
God I hate rogue players lol
---
Bouncing Blade does not target immune minions. I'm not even sure you can use it if there is no targetable minion on board, but if you can (assuming its cast by Yogg or something), it will just fizzle out without doing anything.
---
which turn?
---
Never had a Coldarra Drake with it though from all the runs I've played.
---
Thought it was a neat thing, take your negativity somewhere else my dude
---
Buff 1 minion is the key. Literally pick anyone with a butt 4 or greater and you are fine. Slam other shit to bait damage. GG
---
I'll auto conceded if you dare target more then 1 minion on board with those juicy priest buffs.
---
I can login now but there’s no queue timer when trying to find match; or won’t find one
---
If only there was a way to find out
---
It can work, splashing pogo into a tempo rogue deck can work pretty well. Just dont make the focus on the pogos.
---
Another advice: If you get Shaman, concede and queue again until you get priest. Then just wait until you have a decent amount of buffs. Then buff Gargoyle or the Card that draws you a card for every attack. If it has enough health use Inner Fire and Divine Spirit.
---
This is the way you can almost win alone.
---
something something small indie company
---
Its extremely unfun to play against. Punishes you for having a hand, punishes you for having a board. Basically, just punishes you for being ahead.
---
We can dream
---
There are fun priest decks (I really enjoyed Dragon Mindblast for example), but Big Priest is legit the one deck that makes me take a break from HS and not queue again (or queue Exodia Mage)

[Did I do it right?](http://magaimg.net/img/85rw.jpg)
---
Do you work for this company?
---
Deathweb I kinda agree with but Warlock right now is just zoo, because there is less healing in Warlock, and Deathweb is a turn 6-7 play and not a turn 5.
---
Aviana is still questionable because you are giving your opponent a free card, so for it to become 'playable' you need to stick stats on it to see if it survives.
---
Yeah same here just grinding heroic chapter 5 until I get that perfect robe run
---
So I don't know if this is also happening to you guys but sometimes there is a bug in my decks that switches the number of cards that it contains but in reality the 30 cards are all there.
---
&gt;[...]Then just wait until you have a decent amount of buffs. Then...
---
Nefarian swaps your hands and your __teammate__ buffs the shit out of some random 4/4 instead of their Gargoyle.
---
Either this ^, or you have cards that are missing/unplayable in those decks. Happens frequently when they change seasons or if you accidentally/intentionally (albeit unknowingly) disenchanted some cards that were shared across those decks specifically.
---
I enjoy playing it on PC because I enjoy playing it which is rare for games for me these days. Its an easy game to play with a twitch stream on on my other monitor and be able to pay attention to both.
---
I wanted to puke reading your comment.
---
&gt;I've never paid a dime since launch.
---
Yeah, your collection grew with the game, that's fine.
---
&gt;I even started a new account this past December. I was rank five within a few weeks.
---
Yes, lets have ever new player disenchant every card just to make one deck. Playing the same deck for months is super fun! It's even more fun when you realize you made it really hard to complete class quests!
---
