Aggro is only snoebally if you do not contest the board or knowingly choose to not run any board clears. Do you expect them to just freely let you pull off your bs mountain into conjuring combo? If you weren't playing such a greedy deck, you wouldn't be in such a bad board state.
---
It was always pretty close but won 5 out of 5 matches i had at rank 5/4.

Just look at Dog's list, mine is pretty close to his (remove undatakah)

Is this game fun for anyone else in this expansion? I still feel like it's the same crap for the last expansion, but with different cards.
---
Rogue is way better.

I used all my money to buy phone.

&gt; maybe having more medium/small time buyers is better than relying on whales tho. After all, looking at hearthstone's profit margins.

---
This research has been repeated over and over and over again. It's not. Otherwise many companies would have adopted this microtransaction model and actually made microtransactions micro.
---
So thank you for telling me that maybe the sky is green.
---
It almost never makes its way into the meta unless a lot of other Secret synergies are in the format.  While it's solid, I'd say it's pretty far from "good" standalone.
---
It's just as boring as the last one. Any fun decks are quickly outpaced by boring decks, like bomb warrior, handlock, and token druid. Yay. 
---
That isn't to say I want OTK to come back, but there needs to be a middle ground.
---
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
---
You guys nailed it. Warlock is definitely the worst class. Nice job on that pre-release predictions post.
---
pity timer + owning every other leg?
---
Get rid of Devine spirit inner fire and add shadow visions and mass hysteria
---
Or having the rush effect only apply for a turn as a band aid to avoid the creature being unable to go face on subsequent turns.
---
Public defender's the only real option here. 2 mana is not worth 2 health.
---
The sad thing was that this wasn't even in ranked, this was the tavern brawl this week ;-;
---
Hacks.
---
There's also the deal 1 damage get a lackey spell and a 2mana 3/2 that draws you a card if you have spell boost on board. Other than that, meh.
---
I usually concede when they take long turns unless I‚Äôm in ranked
---
I like your formatting. Here‚Äôs my key, my gold, my pack. Jobs done.
---
Thanks üòé

Whenever I see a moment like this on Trump's stream I'm always excited for what Jens has in store for the edit
---
I like to play it out, doing the same thing back to them to give them a hard time for giving me a hard time.
---
Nice! The person that made Jokesayer also commented here as well lol. It's like a gathering of card designers on this post lol.
---
Prince Liam is obsolete thanks to rafaam, I suggest switching to warlock and craft that legendary asap if you like this kind of deck.
---
Control shaman works well.  Only match I have lost recently to token druid was when I had bad draws and couldn't get a board clear to save my life.
---
Inconsistent. No 5-cost Glowtron.
---
Yep, he sure did.
---
Didnt pick the spot the card would be. Not impressed.
---
Kappa
---
Interaction is that cast when drawn has priority. Swapping prices happens after the card is drawn, the cast when drawn happens immediately. When the price swap happens, the bomb has already disappeared.
---
Why?
---
Guess hunter was the most appealing and easy to learn character for me.  Love at first sight :)
---

---
Like what? Perpare the jade serpent will guide you fish all day?
---
Simple if you use pity tracker
---
I just haven't seen the deck before so I was confused about the name
---
I don't think you know what the definition of sensitive is. So because other people can be dumb on the internet, your brilliant idea is, oh yeah I should do that too. You sound like a cool dude...
---
Not true. Tempo decks sacrifice card value for immediate impact. Think backstab in rogue. Midrange decks curve out. They play the single best thing they can every turn. Zoo is about vomiting small things. Aggro is about maximizing face damage through chargers, weapons and burn spells. 
---
Token druid isn't quite midrange but it's certainly not tempo. It's almost more appropriate to say it's a combo hybrid.
---
They have already stated they like the interaction. Back then it was meme status and the community likes it. A few lost games won't cause they to remove a fun culture. Plus getting sac pact or finding a warlock that runs one is rare.
---
Oh shit, so you're playing the rank #1 deck in the game atm that everyone's playing? NICE! Hearthstone at its finest.

I LOVE Lucentbark. And also Floop for making it possible to still win after your Lucentbark gets hexed üòè
---
I have a script that can used to run pack analysis. A full collection costs 261 packs give or take, implementing a no duplicate rule only lowers the total to 239 packs. So the cost of a new duplicate rule only costs blizzard 22 packs per whale, and they likely buy excess anyway.
---
found a blog page with a screenshot of the stores if you still need it
---

Its the same interaction with faceless manipulator. When the minion u play transforms into something when u play it, floop also transforms into that cards
---
Classic Rank 13 salt. I swear, that ladder bracket is the shittiest.
---
Mountain Giant is never the issue with Mountain Giant decks.  If they‚Äôre going to keep up the recent glut of three mana draw three cards I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it go however.
---
I like your deck... I think I‚Äôll take it
---
new card ?
---
Wow rank 3, I have trouble getting past the floor on 5! Okay look, this might sound crazy, but your friend/rival clearly was on to something in their meta pocket to rise to legend in a week. Have you considered asking them for pointers? I know that‚Äôs counterintuitive and with good reason: you‚Äôre feeling humiliated and dejected because HS is usually your expertise and a boon to your self esteem, and right now you‚Äôre having doubts where that is being called into question. Flexibility regarding your self image is what‚Äôs needed. It sounds like you‚Äôre already half way there if you‚Äôre able to share these feelings with us and also have the self awareness to realize how it could sound. There‚Äôs that old story about Ben Franklin deliberately asking his enemy/rival for help, which ends up enlisting him as an ally because psychology. That‚Äôs one option. 
---
I‚Äôm also reminded of first chair musicians in high school bands, and how much better they were than the 3rd or 4th chair- but in the following years as adults, far surpassed the stagnant 1st chair musician through dedication and practice. It wasn‚Äôt because they were competing against their high school section leaders, it‚Äôs because they were competing against *themselves* and never gave up.
---
Finally, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself (or too impressed with your friend), the beginning of an expansion was a bizarre time to climb.
---
You don't always get a card as a reward.
---
Quit posting videos of your mom
---
Classic lasts forever.  Rise of Shadows is good for two years.  Once you‚Äôve hit the first Legendary from the previous three expansions to RoS I would stop and just use dust acquired over time from Classic and RoS to make whatever you need since it‚Äôll all rotate an entire year before RoS.  If later you‚Äôre all caught up on current packs, save for the next set.  If you‚Äôre going to pay real money for the next set, then consider getting the older packs since your gold wouldn‚Äôt be doing anything else anyway.
---
It's not a myth, it's been tested by hundreds of thousands of players around the world, "A guy" was obviously lying and the rep was either fake or doesn't know his job.
---
Right?! I have a better win rate with Heal Druid over token Druid!

i mean, if you read the comments on the thread about it, most of the points where actually about how he has become an egotistical asshole.

I love how everyone said how garbage the card was because of Mind Control and Silence. Guess they forgot how Priest is only one of nine classes, those cards are hardly staples. And that a Druid can kind of make a fuck ton of them.

r/Hearthstone: "wtf I love toast now"
---

---
Showing the actual winrate is much more interesting than saying 100% IMO
---
Also, when it comes to watching streamers, they can sometimes use terms that might be confusing to new players. A streamer named Zalae made a great video on the Omnislash YouTube channel called "Fundamentals of Hearthstone with Zalae", or something along those lines. It's a very good introduction to the main concepts in the game, like tempo, value, life and fatigue.
---
Sorry for answering this so late, but I thought of a counterpoint and I wanted to know what you think.
---
If you hand is full, the bomb doesn't activate, but instead is burned. This proves that actually the bomb has to enter your hand. So, given this interaction, it should be discarded by a book of spirit.
---
I'm now convinced it's a bug.
---

He used hex the turn before. Shame on me for not recording. Next game was even crazier. Conjurer‚Äôs Calling is MVP of mage arena.
---
Was hoping for a 69% damn...
---
Go to HSReplay, connect your battle net, then look at the standard deck list sorted by playrate or winrate. In addition, use the dust meter on the left bar to say how much dust you‚Äôre willing to spend (put 1600 for starters). Then it will show you which meta decks you are the closest in dust to having. For me, that was zoo and res priest. Zoo I subbed in cards I already had for ones I was missing and found it very strong, plus I like warlock, so I crafted what I was missing. Res priest didn‚Äôt feel very good, so I didn‚Äôt craft what I was missing.
---
Best part: your opponent could 100% have played around it.
---
Reynad bitches every time rng fucks him but when he draws the right card, it was planned or he "finally" got lucky.
---
But I do enjoy when he says his thought process out loud, weighing his options and what each play could result in.
---
Imagine unironically comparing clickbait to a felony lol
---
If you're not a kid, you won't fall for clickbait and will instead choose a video based on what you expect to be in it. You see "100% WIN RATE INSANE CONJURER YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED" you think to yourself "well, it can't be 100%, I can probably believe what happened, BUT if Toast uploaded it to YT, that means it must have been a cool game from stream", so you click. You probably would have clicked if the title was "Conjurer Mage in RoS, April 2019" 
---
Now imagine you're a 10 year old and so you don't use logic and shit. You see a title like "Conjurer Mage in April 2019", you yawn and go on with your life. Then you see "100% WIN RATE INSANE CONJURER YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED" and your kiddy brain instantly wants to click that video, because WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT IF I REALLY WON'T BELIEVE.
---
Now imagine most of people on YT belong to the second group.
---
I don't blame him. If you're smart enough not to fall for clickbait, I'd expect you to be smart enough to recognize how beneficial it is to the creator and how it doesn't hurt you in any way, except for your self-induced anger.
---
That's something like playing Quest Mage without the Antonidas?
---
Vargoth has such lovely synergy with Pally spells, I love it.

Now the rise of shadows meta comes.
---
Again at first day opened golden lucentbark.

Trump‚Äôs video on favorable trading is like, to this day, the most important CCG tutorial I‚Äôve ever seen. I rewatched it recently for the first time in ages after linking a new player to it and there were still turns where I found I would have for sure made the wrong play. 
---
But not, like, ‚Äú2 murlocs into 1 argent squire‚Äù wrong.
---
Yes Druid exists and it's called Silence Priest
---
He‚Äôs not back paddling, he‚Äôs clearly not being serious by going so specifically into decimal places, making fun of people like you
---
Surely someone like Trump wouldn't keep track of his pity timer though? That would be impossible.
---
You mean handlock?
---
Yeah what is this deck? I opened Lynchen on day 1 but I haven't found a use for her yet.
---
I agree. Conjured mages disappeared after rank 6.
---
You are not convincing üëç
---
Small indie company
---
Yup. Haven‚Äôt seen one since around R6. Currently R3. It‚Äôs all about them rogues -with some sprinkle of druids-
---
Evolve mechanics like that always consider the original cost only. If there's no applicable minion in the target mana group, it does nothing.
---
Why his thumbnails of all things? He runs a ‚Äúmythbusters‚Äù series when he‚Äôs wrong about most mechanics (and is too stupid to understand mechanics by reading card text and has to test it instead)
---
But whatever, he‚Äôs an idol amirite
---
Rogue will most likely get some sort of nerf. I‚Äôm calling prep or raiding party. Maybe even Wagglepick -but since it‚Äôs from RoS and they want to sell packs, who knows- 
---
The early game swing turns need to be brought down a peg or two.
---
I agree. No idea where the downvotes are coming from. I can understand why aggro players might feel helpless against certain control matchups but control v control is where decision making and managing your resources matters.
---
Cards like rexxar could also win the game based on the button. Healing, removal, threats, and even silences and fatigue delays on demand.
---
Pre-nerf druids actively tried to ignore the board for as long as possible, because every minion on the opponents side with less than 5 attack (and sometimes with more, since 1 mana fireball were a thing for some reason) was a free 1/5 taunt. There was also a bit during RR when there was a critical mass of AFK until I OTK decks, including 4 minions clone priest.
---
Wrathguard is a demon tho
---
awww rip
---
Thalnos and violet teacher help alot too. Also miracle having more card draw mean you can clear their board and still have some resources
---
It's simple. I play Barnes, summon blood of the ancient one summon blood of the ancient one, bring him back, play him again, summon blood of the ancient one summon blood of the ancient one and at the end of my turn I summon... THE ANCIENT ONE THE ANCIENT ONE
---
The only slight problem is conjurers calling, which might get nerfed by mana cost, but not mountain giant
---
oof alright, I'll conform my thinking toward the masses
---
adapt
---
We know that‚Äôs a lie though, because news articles also use click bait. How many kids do you really think are looking at news articles? Barely any, but it is still being used as a business practice because it works. If something is obvious click bait, it‚Äôs rare that I‚Äôll click on it as I don‚Äôt want to give the scumbag responsible any money. No matter who it is, lying to your consumers, the people who have given you a life, is a shitty thing to do. 
---
I do blame him, he was conscious about doing it and he would have made money either way. But he chose to go the greedier route, which is on him. If he wants to lie, sure, but he needs to be ready for the outcome. Instead of complaining about it on his Twitter even when he knows that he‚Äôs in the wrong. It doesn‚Äôt harm me, but neither does the majority of events us humans get upset about. And we have about as much right to express ourselves as the people defending Toast.
---
Yeah I'd ban those guys, too. Just annoying chat clutter.
---
Oh right....
---
LOL! Great one.
---
Interesting
---
Shit I didn't even realize he used bw instead of between.

Technically I can play a game against a hot and say my deck has a 100 percent winrate.

If it was honestly that easy everyone would do it. I mean it sounds easy but it‚Äôs not because to some extent if you don‚Äôt deliver no ones going to click after the first few. There‚Äôs a whole science behind YouTube thumbnails and titles and it‚Äôs pretty evident once you see the viewer counts. Just look at all of those toast videos and the ones with the clickbait 100% perform better than the rest of his content. It might not seem like much but when you‚Äôre jumping 60k-100k viewers it‚Äôs a significant chunk. 
---
And then to try to discredit the effort as not being work. The person sits down and tries to come up with the way to get the most exposure on his videos and then gets paid. It might not be standing in front of a fryer for eight hours but it‚Äôs definitely work. Just give it a shot if you want to invalidate it. Sit down and try to come up with a title and thumbnail for daily uploads. You‚Äôll quickly find out that while it may start off easy it quickly gets harder and harder as you produce more and more.
---
How can new player get those old solo adventures?
---
The question is whether electra + board clear suppose to work like Hyena + Defile interaction or not. If you have hyena on the board and someone cast defile, hyena get buffed immediately before next tick of defile dmg is triggered. However in terms of deathrattle I guess it is triggered once full action is completed, so in this case electra casts spell twice and then deathrattle triggers. would be cool to get this interaction ( spell - deathrattle - 2nd trigger for spell ) as you do not have enough board clears for swarm decks these days.
---
O__O
---
Acting and sarcasm is lying too. You can like and dislike what you want but get some perspective at least.
---
The power level went way down and I can actually find some success with my own lists at decent ranks, most of the cards I disliked playing against are gone
---
&gt;Is it normal to drop this much? Will I ever be good at this game? Why is it that no matter how much time I invest in this game (whether playing, watching videos and tournaments, analyzing my plays, etc) I never seem to reach legend? I'm starting to feel really depressed, as if I'm a failure.
---
It is normal to drop and float between ranks. 5 stars per rank is not a big sample size, so over many games you can see yourself going from 4 to 1 and back to 4. Many players have experienced it already, so you‚Äôre not alone. 
---
There are many ways to improve your play and ultimately it depends on what kind of learner you are. Be honest with yourself. When you analyse your games, do you do deep enough to discover hidden lines? I would recommend finding a sparring partner, or joining the CompetitiveHS discord - take screenshots of game situations you‚Äôre unsure about and ask questions. Also find a good player to spectate or test matchups with. Your play and understanding of a specific matchup will skyrocket once you play it over and over again vs a good player, who can give you feedback.
---
Another thing: on the first run to legend it is recommended to stick to one deck, preferably tier 1. At the moment that deck would be Tempo Rogue probably. Learn it in and out and play around 100-200 matches. Study all mulligans, all macro-gameplans, the weaknesses and strengths, everything. If that‚Äôs not enough, ask some friends to test decks you have a hard time against. Play some control warrior vs your deck and see the game from the other side.
---
Last thing: read about the theory of the game. Understanding the concepts of value, tempo, fatigue, play to win not to lose, beatdown vs. control. 
---
Good luck! Feel free to PM if you want more advice

Nice drawing, I think I will take it!
---
What have you done to this poor warrior
---
Awesome! I'm from ATL, thank you!
---
Yeah but I was thinking literally just run MechaThun instead of the archivist. I guess it is more risky but silence and transform removal really isn't that common in this meta. I have lost more than once from a warrior dr boom discovering mechathun and them just playing it as a 10/10 as their last card. Can't ignore the 10/10 because it'll kill me but also can't kill it. It is less robust than archivist I guess but since we are seeing this proliferation of getting more greedy with archivist then perhaps the risk is worth it?
---
Remove "can't attack" from ancient watcher.
---
I'm finding the new build easier to kill than ever. Less taunts. The deck isn't even that problematic and all this moaning is getting boring.  most aggro decks run it over.

Don't get me wrong clickbait annoys me as much as the next guy, but if you bother to actually watch the videos he usually makes fun of himself as much for doing it as anyone.
---
I read it as brood war
---
Especially the case with eggs. That was the big hot topic at the time, the deck had such a long combo, with a game that doesn‚Äôt have turn timers, but didn‚Äôt have the consistency Storm, Splinter Twin, and other combo decks did. It didn‚Äôt make since to concede, and pretty much forced you to watch your opponent play solitaire for 10-15 minutes. If I remember right, Kibler did that to make a point, and help the deck get a key piece banned.
---
Toast is a stand up dude.

He shows his win rate in the video. And even though at the time it was only like 20 games, he‚Äôs since played a lot more and his win rate is still above 60% with it. I mean people like to make fun of him for his clickbait and stuff but he is a really good player.
---
&gt;It's not broken. It has low to mid fifties win rates
---
When is the last time a meta deck had over 60% winrate?? Even at the height of Odd Paladin etc it was only at mid 50s. I don't think it's that broken but citing mid 50s winrate as proof is just baffling.
---
Can I have your experience please? Lol. No joke, anytime I get a decent win streak going, I hit rogue after rogue after rogue. The vs report that came out yesterday also backed up rogues making up a significant portion of the meta from 5-legend. I wish I didnt see so many haha
---
Its hardly a hate message though. The dude didn't even throw any insults.  
---
Its more of a salty message than a hate message. He shouldn't have made it regardless.
---
Reddit bullied DT into accurate titles
---
Zentimo has floated in and out of previous control Shamans.  I'd probably put a keep on that.
---
Thanks captain obvious... It's because of the mana 3 giant.
---
Big Warrior is pretty fun to play
---
No, he creates a character and breaks it from time to time to get real with his audience, like how Dr. Disrespect is an over the top character.
---
The fact that everyone could open their packs in prereleases also doesnt help this fact. You get 2 smaller moments compared to one big release with a higher viewership.
---
you are terribly misinformed, undatakah + prelate interaction works to preserve enchantments on undatakah.  The problem with the combo is that the undatakah that gets summoned by recurring villain deathrattle does not get taunt, while you shuffle a taunted undatakah into your deck
---
Iirc correctly, it was slated to be released a month after the expansion, which would probably mean around May 7th
---
Happy cake day
---
Then ignore everything I said previously and mark it under TIL on my end....
---
Thanks, that's actually quite funny
---
Immortal prelate deathrattle shuffles undatakah into your deck with all its enchantments, recurring villain deathrattle will summon a plain undatakah with no enchantments
---
Priest was fantastic in Un'Goro. Priest actually received w ton of good cards this expansion, it's just that in all last year's expansions it received bad cards..

Could you elaborate? I want to hear more Brian Kibler facts.
---
Is this any different than Kripp? Yet Kripp gets no hate threads like Toast got, I don't understand why people can't just not like someone without shitting on them. I don't like Kripp so I don't watch him, end of story.
---
One of the developers said something like that was the original idea. "Battlecry: draft a new deck", but was obviously scrapped because that would take up way too long during a normal turn
---
Honestly if people took getting better at the game seriously they might not be so frustrated. In the end it's a mobile game sure, but it has depth that you can learn and people dismiss that just because it's a goofy looking game. Pokemon is the same way, a little immature looking but the competitive side of it is honestly out of the grasp of a lot of its player base. Anyways lol
---
done!

Khadgar simply says your cards that summon minions summon twice as many, leeroy with khadgar on your board summons twice as many whelps because he gets the khadgar effect. The beast's deathrattle should work the exact same way, your card summoned a minion, therefore it summons twice as many.
---
i came back to HS after 1 year but stopped again. the game feels too boring honestly, i as mainly druid and warrior, am forced to draw the warrior DK in 35min mirrors or play aggro to be competitive as druid. UI totally wrecked druid, any sort of big or ramp druid is just slow and feels lame. interactions that somehow in any form could be abused, like charge, dont get printed anymore. everything and their mother has rush. theres no room left to experiment anymore in HS, everything has been nerfed or rotated into HOF, i think malygos and auctioneer are next.
---
There are no sure "must haves" yet, so best thing you can do is craft Whizzbang and play in ranked to learn new cards and synergies. IMO it's better idea than jumping straight into deck construction in a new meta after a long break. I have done the same (I also was a return from around Kobolds) - and it played qiute nice. Whizz decks are good enough to have fun without too much frustration, and you can see what people are playing with and slowly get some ideas from that.
---
Warrior must have done a lot wrong, if he faces such a board
---
Stop giving that annoying asshole a platform
---
I also feel like the lack of adventure is lame.
---
oh boy can't wait for the thirty analysis posts made by people that read an economy textbook once
---
The majority.  You literally think over half the hearthstone playerbase is going to leave.
---
Pop-up-windows are also anoying, yet they waste less time than clickbait.
---
Immediately? No. Over the course of the next few expansions? Yes.
---
Wait, why were you promised a control meta? Everything pointed towards fast midrange...
---
I hope when the first nerfs come Elysiana will be on there.
---
So is hearthstone
---
Well said

Gathered with some friends who played the game, but weren't much into the competitive scene. I just casually made a remark that the World Championship was happenning at that exact moment, and we then broadcasted the stream on TV. On this very moment, we all got to witness what many still consider the pinnacle of competitive Hearthstone, Pavel's insane Babbling Book RNG.
---
Hey HearthSin. You seem to have some association with HSReplays.net. Can you tell them they may want to update [this](https://i.imgur.com/mVN5Zyv.jpg)? That is all.
---
That's your plan? Add a one-of to your deck to counter a 40% WR deck that only a sadistic fuck with too much time on their hands would play?
---
I don't really agree that Boom and Jaina are the same. I could outpressure Rexxar with Jaina. Jaina not only creates value but immediately puts it on the battlefield. Not to mention you usually heal to full health pretty quickly with Jaina. Jaina was a death sentence to aggro decks and could outvalue control decks. Dr. Boom is fine but he was nothing special when Death Knights were in rotation.
---
Terrible list. No oger
---
That's probably exactly why they thought of it now.
---
Thank you. Do you think I should maybe craft some epics instead?
---
Hard not to go with reckless rocketeer for both
---
Pick rate: the 6/4 deathrattle summon 4 scrolls.     
---
   
---
Win rate: our Lord and savior often 6/7
---
Realistically it's your best bet if you let the CM live you lose anyway.
---
Just so you all know toast is doing this as damage control for all of you whining babies, who really cares if he puts 100% wr on his video titles he‚Äôs just having fun with some of the less effective decks of the expansion, give the guy a break and if you don‚Äôt like him just don‚Äôt watch him and stop making circlejerk-esk reddit posts
---
its only broken if they get the nuts and bolts and the start of the game, but if they dont you got time to build a little presence to respond to their summons
---
Buffs aren't retained when moving backwards in play order ex. Board to hand  or hand to deck
---
&gt; Lazul‚Äôs Scheme 
---
Nope.
---
Lazul's Scheme specifies Enemy Minion.  Does not work for Mechathun.
---
I thiink you are missing the point.
---
It is more prevalent in MIRROR matches. So of course you probably haven't experienced it, my guess you only ever face warriors.
---
Try Elysiana in Warrior and match up against a warrior, then come back to this post and tell us your thoughts.
---
I believe some tournaments have banned her (unofficial) but I pray they soon realize the mistake they did. Her concept is fun, but I think she's going to be very unhealthy long term, if not now already. I stopped playing Control this entire set because of her. Value Control mirrors are fun when the value actually matters, not which Elys gave better RNG, first or second time with Banker/Brewmaster.
---
Do we know the prizes? Im not sure yet if i should start saving up gold for them or just buy packs.
---
"Surely I can knock this out pretty quickly in Casual."
---
2 hours of facing nothing but netdecks and a single win later...
---
Guys, I get that the deck is not consistent, I even mentioned it. That was not my point. But you're definitely right about Big Shaman being a better example.
---
There is a subreddit for user created cards; they'll probably give you better feedback than we will:
---
/r/customhearthstone/
---
I'm in a similar boat but I stopped when wild came out and just came back.  Using my old decks in wild was fun for a bit but wild just cant be competitive.  Infinite fireballs in one turn with a mage and other op unfun combos to face.  It does make me agree with their choice of rotating things out though.
---
Thinking about dusting some of my wild decks now too.  I already have a good amount of dust and should just wait until the meta settles first.
---
I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs taking the joke at least but cmon, a comma? What the fuck is that
---
Haha that's actually a great reaction
---
I honestly don't think brawl is a problem. I like brawl.
---
The problem is Omega cards that Warrior has. I really think Omega Assembly should be 2 cards, and Omega Devastator needs a mana cost increase. They shouldn't be able to play 2 in one turn. But that is just my thoughts on the subject. I am also biased because I hate spending 9 mana to split a giant, and for my opponent to clear both of my newly summoned minions and still ahve enough to rpess their button.
---
That's not what I said.
---
So is Quidditch
---
Honestly at this point high level control seems to be mostly warrior vs warrior with whoever has the better elsyiana coming out on top.
---
This is why I just started playing this game, having a real, challenging long term goal to works towards is just so cool.
---
I don‚Äôt know if the people on this sub are naive or too young to figure out how YouTube works. There is a reason everyone uses clickbait. It works and YouTube algorithms promote it
---
Dyno magic is insane before boom, after it makes no sense.
---
Indeed.
---
My Control Priest goes 60 cards into the deck and I've never hit the turn limit.
---
Man I wish people would accept my friend request after a game. I just wanna talk and have friends :(
---
And that's exactly what happened haha.  I woke up with 95 gold.
---
So the two decks that had lorewalker cho got maybe 5 wins? What an interesting, useless insight!
---
Press escape, and click on concede
---
I‚Äôm the complete opposite. I‚Äôd much rather watch a live stream than an edited YouTube video. I enjoy seeing full games play out to get a better idea of how a deck works and what to do in a given scenario. Watching YouTube vids just feels like an ESPN highlight reel to me.
---
Illidan for both.
---
Player counts were inflated because of the Diablo Immortal Fiasco and lack of competition more than anything.
---
Doesn't matter. You can learn another language or cultural style. He should be using the same punctuation as what Toast uses.
---
Not to mention Murloc shaman I just dead at turn 4
---
Theoretically, you could stop playing Civ at any time.  But you won't.  Because in 3 turns, you unlock Tanks, and the Persians are getting what they deserve.
---
It's just science!
---
Hold out champion! (Turns until Tirion arrives: 3)
---
He‚Äôs not wrong
---
I'm not a druid expert - and my advice would completely depend on what kind of Mage you're facing. But what I used to do when I was your level was play against the innkeeper a lot. Can you beat the expert mage deck the innkeeper has? (Solo, practice mode)
---
Mass Dispel is way better against this board. If you scream they just come back later.
---
I played and lost against one using a Resurrect Priest, it's a very long and annoying game. Didn't knew the archetype till a day later.
---
5th time i've seen this screen shot in less than 48h. We get it.
---
I would say wild because decks are more extreme (for example like aggro is way faster and more powerful)
---
&gt; Drawing too much has always had punishments.
---
In certain games, under certain conditions. It wasn't considered universally bad in many common match-ups. In a game like Magic the Gathering you can have unlimited cards in your deck if you so chose. Decking your opponent is not how you win the game unless you made a deck specifically designed to *destroy* the opponent's deck rather than outlast them. Most control decks, AFAIK, work towards either summoning big stuff or doing some sort of combo that defeats the opponent. 
---
Blizzard does not want decks to exist that don't try to win the game. They haven't wanted that since Old Gods when they first started making expensive cards powerful enough to encourage slow decks to actually try to win the game.
---
There are control decks that dont play her and just win. Try Fibonaccis gigantic warrior its a ton of fun. It wipes the floor with the bore you to death decks. Include a win condition instead of planning for turn 40.
---
He abandoned HS like a little bitch and just played auto chess for a long time making shit videos then came crawling back instead of at least sticking to his guns once he realized people only cared about his HS streaming.
---
I don't watch him anymore because he's insincere, click baity, and honestly... Not that good at HS. Better than me sure but I would rather watch Trump, Firebat, or Kibler any day.
---
I think no nerfs is pretty unlikely.  They nerfed twice last expansion basically because they wanted to shake up the meta and keep it fresh between expansions.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôll nerf, but I expect them to nerf something.
---
"Cheaper stuff" keeps people playing. And people are slowly quitting. Horrible game economy coupled with the same gameplay for years, it's no wonder. You can only cash in off of minimal effort for so long. 
---
And idk how the first change is horrible, one pack in this game is nothing, you shouldn't grind 10+ WINS on average for a pack daily. People who think that's ok clearly have Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Even tho it's buffed by the shrine, it stays as a 4-4 when you draw it, the 1-1 is lost, but still nice try
---
You were playing control shaman, yet had no removal?
---
I'm assuming you just used both of your hexes early game or have bad rng
---
Baku and Genn died for this, fucked up
---
Sounds amazing, I love long games.
---
Too bad I don't have Elysiana, so I can't participate. Oh well.
---
Playing around bomb definitively is.  Control warrior, not so much.
---
hmmm. Lemme edit real quick.
---
Noz is the best. Never dust
---
Your mechs with Rush have +1 attack.
---
Get the 1-1 wolf that gives +1 attack
---
I don't care about your opinion.
---
If they‚Äôre not planning to print new hero cards this year, I wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if Boom and Hagatha get HoF‚Äôd.  The cards aren‚Äôt remotely OP in wild, but they do mean only Shaman and Warrior can make control decks in Standard.
---
This post made me curious, so I looked it up. If you go on HSReplay and sort Mage class cards in Arena by winrate. Magic Dart Frog is the 9th worst card in the class. 
---
The card has very narrow use-cases. It's pretty solid in the scenario you described: you're in the early game, the small damage to the board matters, and you have small spells to use. But you play up to 14 games in Arena, the probability you'll be in this situation in all of those games is very low. The probability you draw Magic Dart Frog in the early game is significantly lower than the probability you draw him later in the game. 
---
Later in the game, its effect is not impactful at all. People expect you to be able to deal 1 damage to places as a Mage. The fact that you only deal 1 random damage rather than 2 from Flamewaker is very significant. Your pay-off for playing a spell just isn't high enough.
---
At its core, for Arena, the card is a significantly harder to use Knife Juggler with smaller pay-off for high-synergy.
---
By they sentiment then there's no reason to do anything ever lol.  The point is that you tried to make a comment where you thought it was a good rebuttal, when in reality it wasn't.  Now that you've been called out on it, you're back tracking and trying to say that it's not relevant.
---
I replied to what you said, then replied to the StarCraft comment.  So not entirely sure what you're trying to accomplish by saying.
---
&gt;I just wanted to see if you would ignore everything I said and only focus on the Starcraft part. Lord behold.
---
Yep and random card generation from large pools is possibly at an all-time high. It's lazy design from the devs. More importantly, it's just not an interesting concept to construct a deck around.
---
I'm not sure if he's "officially" quit but his last hearthstone video was uploaded January 18th and it's been nothing but Auto Chess since
---
I came in into Jade Druid existing, so I've personally seldom seen that card played unless it was Arena. Did it actually ever see play?
---
Then add two. Or Mass Dispel. Or maybe be a bit more aggro. There's lots of options, dude. Get creative.
---
Calling Lucentbark cancerous just because you lost to it just makes you seem salty.
---
This isn't even my aggressive deck.
---
there's a system in place which prevents you from opening legendaries that you already have.
---
so even though it's not good, if you dust it, you could open it again. if you don't dust it, you'll get a better (or worse) legendary.
---
* Conjurer's Calling is more a reflection of Control Warrior being popular.  It is super greedy and reliant on Warrior being in the meta.  Loses to Aggro hard.
---
* Savage Roar isn't changing at this point.  Druid isn't a problem.  People need to tech more MC Tech's and let the meta resolve.
---
* If you are looking at the hardest deck to counter, it is Tempo Rogue.  I'm not sure anything can handle it and that is what you would adjust.  But it might not be at the point where you nerf it.  It might just be dominant and not broken.  And for that I'd look at Waggle Pick.
---
That was my thinking
---
  thats slightly innaccurate, flicking obscures your cards in hand. making it difficult to tell how long you've been holding on to any particular card.   
---
  not a big reason, but still valid. It just becomes a habit after a while tbh
---
Agreed.
---
I don't have hours upon hours to play. I want the games to be about 15 minutes max honestly.
---
I straight up just duck out on warriors.
---
I've literally never drawn an Elysiana mirror, and I've played a lot of them.  Usually someone just runs out of answers bc their Elysiana options were just better than the opponent.
---
indeed
---
sometimes even the warrior has to be the nail...
---
Savannah Highmane, in the rare event that the card is acquired and played by a Hunter.
---
However, there's a lot of room in between "Less Broken than Jaina" and "Not Overpowered".
---
Are you kidding? The lowest value shit in the game is in the packs. Adventures are where the REAL value is. That's the only hope this piece of shit has left.
---
Bugged
---
Have you found anything to put nozari in yet?  I don‚Äôt personally have him but I look at the cars and it seems so/so at best.  In a game where you‚Äôre getting crushed it‚Äôll help you survive an extra turn or 2 to look for an answer but since it‚Äôs a one time effect and nothing something persistent like the other big dragons (or a board clear like death wing) the cost seems way too highs.  If it was something like heal both to full and heal 5 to just your hero every turn after it would be insane.  But as it is I can‚Äôt help feeling it‚Äôs another ‚Äúwait until next expansion for the synergies‚Äù type card.
---
How are control warrior decks greedy?
---
And what "win condition" are you talking about, it doesn't matter what you put in or don't, warrior has endless removal and minions.
---
FUEL THE SOUL ENGINES!
---
Sorry what, how do you get buffed 4/4 by turn 3 as token druid?
---
Golden legendary from which set?
---
Nope I had horrible luck
---
Definitely agreed on this. But, the proposed changes also operate as a significant nerf--this card will actually become below average as increasing the size of your deck is almost never good. Therefore, I don't anticipate it being something people run into as often.
---
Why does it not surprise me in the least to hear the HS devs thought "replace every single card in your goddamn deck with something random" was a good idea.  What even is this game.
---
That‚Äôs whack but I don‚Äôt see any reason why they can‚Äôt have her replace your deck with the same number of cards that you have.
---
Extending your deck is a lame concept imo especially when you can do it without interaction, multiple times, and long enough to reach the turn limit.
---
Ahh, good point. Forgot about them!
---
Shoutout to all the people who said she'd never see play lol
---
Bingo. 50 perfect winrate also.
---
[[Mechanical Whelp]] plops out a 7/7 with rush, after pinging with the 2/2 rush.
---
They haven't really announced if this is the structure they'll follow for new expansions or not yet. So, dunno.
---

6/2/2 Mech | Deathrattle: Summon a 7/7 Mechanical Dragon.  
---
How do people say 63,7 in places where they use a comma instead of a decimal?
---
Token druid has variation and flexibility too. Both decks are top tier so they generate hate, druid swarms nonstop and warrior just mindlessly plays it's never ending control cards until enemies can't do anything.
---
I'd just settle for a fun version of WoW again.
---
Turn limit is 45 (90 total) but nice try.
---
Damn, Melee has taken over HS.
---
Fuck that card, I actually prefer control mirrors in wild with all the infinite value atm
---
I hope that they fundamentally change the card, but I don't think that'll happen
---
Lol 6 Mana Rexxar? Try again.
---
How about 6 Mana 6/7 with tree in art.
---
I fucking love tharbcard and will forever.  My first craft ever and holy shit did she completely change my understanding of how a truly powerful card can swing the game.  As a f2p from start during the C‚Äôthun day‚Äôs through JUG, I was f2p and so only ever crafted a few cards but none remain as loved as that beautiful undead.
---
What's the point of mentioning that when just about everybody on this sub recognizes Mal'Ganis
---
The deck list is actually very minion heavy and requires winning a tempo game for forge majority of the match. The combo is only useful against very control heavy decks.
---
The actual answer is most likely that adding a lose less cad to a deck in such a swingy meta is not going to move the needle of a decks win rate.
---
[removed]
---
They lost those and more and were dumpster tier waiting for this xpac. Do you think druids should be paying reparations for the next year even without the annoying cards?
---
You are prob playing it wrong, making wrong choices, watch a stream
---
Not sure how accurate this is: https://brilliantmaps.com/decimals/
---
but few sounds like an overstatement.
---
What is youre battletag? Have same problem
---
Also splintergraft
---
I didn‚Äôt even insinuate what you said lol. I said that to further shed light on the hypocrisy of OP‚Äôs opponent in criticizing OP for playing Dr. Boom.
---
They will rotate the sets every two months.
---
Y I K E S
---
You're also comparing a game that is 6 months old with 0 marketing to one that is 5 years old with a marketing budget.  There is clearly something there.  Will it "kill" HS?  No, the "blank is a blank killer" thing is mostly media clickbait, will it have a bigger effect than the other games listed by the OP? - Absolutely
---
Crystal Power is the first Choose One spell with varying target criteria depending on the option you choose. You cannot deal 2 damage to heroes. So what happens with Fandral on the board?
---
Stupid.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm starting to save now
---
It‚Äôs going to be Zayle, Shadow Cloak. He‚Äôs a Whizbang-ish card with 5 unique decks and can only be crafted or received from the single player content after it releases. Zayle won‚Äôt appear in a pack.
---
Blizzard Employee, Battlecry: Discover a canned response.
---
"on the radar"
---
"keeping an eye on it"
---
"glad you like it, too!"
---
Yeah but you would still have the advantage since you get two sets total while Warrior only gets the original set of cards.
---
If you win the matchup versus Warrior, Control Shaman would see a lot more play.
---
Nah, Boom just actually cares about his workers and gives them massive benefits to keep them loyal. That's how Boom's gonna take over the league, all the other lackies will go to work for boom, leaving the others with no workforce to make evil. They'll have to sell their stocks in E.V.I.L. to avoid bankruptcy, and the only one buying is boom, so he'll own the league 100% and promote himself as CEO of that subsidiary of Boom Industries.
---
You may have apologized to the wrong person, too
---
I‚Äôm not mad because they resorted to better decks, I‚Äôm mad because they resorted to better decks and are staying at rank 18. I would expect to see these decks at rank 10 ad below, but rank 15 and above is supposed to be more diverse and creative than this
---
That's  a pretty interesting idea. I feel like the card would be more effective  at 3 or 4 mana with 3/4
---
Matbe he just miss the times where priest had a 0 mana repeatable shadowform
---
Statistics
---
Thanks!
---
Or a thieving priest. "Nice deck, I'll take it"
---
I think 4 mana 3/4 would be just right. Honestly the stats I gave it were too much for the effect it has
---
If you refuse to watch someone who can actually play the deck how will you ever learn lmao??? 
---
You are complaining about how the deck is not working for you, but don't want to spend some time watching someone who can play it. 
---
Do you just want us to tell you the deck is bad? because it isn't. lol
---
3 mana summon dollmaster and gain divine shield again
---
I'm going to guess somewhere between 6th and 9th depending on the popularity of Hogger and Rocketeer and depending on how many minions I'm forgetting right now.
---
Ps4 spiderman?
---
Bro how
---
&gt;for making a sarcastic joke
---
Yeah. It also isn't exactly surprising that the fatigue trump card that is a must-have for certain matchups is a neutral legendary.
---
Lmao what a salty little bitch
---
I swear, the only time I play arena is if something (usually a tavern brawlisium) puts me at a 5 gold number.
---
Also wanted to point out that elysiana is a neutral card. If she was a priest card or rogue card (or some class where shuffling cards into your deck is part of their class identity), she'll be a perfectly fine card.
---
I wish she would only replace your deck with an even number of cards. So if you have 3 cards left in your deck, then it'll replace those with three cards. It could still be helpful to get rid of bombs and blood, or if you only have your 1-2 drops left in your deck in the late game. At least then this card wouldn't make games take 35 minutes, and it could still provide some RNG fun.
---
Well, I think you can play it under pressure - that's why the taunts are so popular. It's a dice roll, sure, but Stegotron or Sunwalker could have a huge stabilizing effect.
---
What do the people who already have the legendary get? Can they get dust or gold?
---
I would assume as long as you don‚Äôt remove the protective film it wouldn‚Äôt look any different from normal
---
What‚Äôs more likely is that they COULD afford them - but now they spent all their dust on their one deck and they‚Äôre too broke to play anything else
---
I actually really fucking like that idea.  It gives f2p players something to test for an entire week.  Personally I think the legendaries need to be heavily restricted, for example, no Norzdomu or other super shit legends.
---
Or even make one of the pre constructed decks free for a week.  It'll keep it fun and different every single expansion.  At that rate though, might as well just give everyone Whizbang I suppose lol.
---
Yeah cause with an effect like that, a warpath could either be great to have or horrible, no on between
---
Why is X playing Y at my Z Rank.

Discover favours class cards
---
Maybe your hearthstone client is corrupted, try reinstalling.
---
Based CHADgar
---
Rank 15 but their isn‚Äôt really a difference
---
Wait really?
---
Also, probably a non-zero percentage of players think/hope battlecries are going to trigger and pick accordingly - still would almost never be the right call though.
---
Well, no. Because having 500 extra cards in your deck doesnt matter if you are losing on board and have worse removal than the other player.
---
Either you are logged in to a different server or most of your cards might have moved to Wild.
---
I love that you made this, for me Lackeys are the best things out of this expansion.
---
The more I‚Äôm thinking about the effect, the more I want to make it a rogue spell or minion
---
* 2013: I wasn't super interested in the original announcement at PaxEast since I'd never played a card game, but it's a Blizzard game so I plan to try it out.
---
* 2013: Had already been watching Trump stream SC2 (his choice of classical music made studying easy), so when he was given super-early access to Hearthstone I started to understand the actual mechanics. Started to get excited about the possibilities.
---
* 2013: I was given Closed Beta access in November, hit 1-Star Masters in December. I had found my new game.
---
* 2014: By the time Naxx released I had over 2k wins on record. I happily pre-ordered the first adventure and (just like everyone else) quickly learned to hate Undertaker. Mobile release made the game even better as I could now play while traveling / at work / etc. I was never a try-hard, just happy to sit between ranks 15-10 with random decks.
---
* 2015: BRM, TGT, and LoE release. I was fully entrenched as a "light spender," buying both adventures with cash and paying for the TGT pre-order. Ranked rewards were added in August of that year, and so I suddenly found myself actually trying to win for that sweet golden epic each month.
---
* 2016: The first ever rotation really breathed new life into the game, as well as adding some truly "epic" cards - N'Zoth is still one of my favorite cards in the game. By the end of 2016 I was up to 8k wins and had all 9 heroes golden.
---
* 2017: January 2016 was the only month I didn't at least hit Rank 5 - the early Meanstreets meta was absolute ass. Luckily, rotation happened and the game continued to entertain. Un'goro was interesting, but the Frozen Throne was amazing. While some of the Death Knight hate is justified, I still love most of the cards and own 8/9 DKs (sorry, Thrall, but evolve isn't an interesting mechanic). I also loved the single player story and unlocking a new hero.
---
* 2018: Like most of us I could definitely feel the lack of impact from the new sets, but I was still having fun. The rise of OTKs near the end of the year was pretty frustrating, but I found fun ways to play around them (and Hakkar is now my favorite card in the game). Oh, and I finally hit Legend during the Boomsday meta! 
---
* 2019: When Rise of Shadows launched I was sitting at 14,494 wins, play every day, and consider Hearthstone my #1 game. I've broken 1,000 wins with each class at this point, I've completed every single player challenge at least once (including all 27 Rumble shrines), I have zero interest in Arena (I have 130 wins in Arena), and am anxiously awaiting the release of the new single player content.
---
I've spent several hundred dollars over the last 5 years and have no regrets. Last year was the only year I pre-ordered all 3 sets, this year I've chosen not to pre-order RoS, but will be paying for the single player content.
---
I watch/listen Hearthstone streams while at work in the same way my dad listened to sports radio when he was working. My favorite streamer by far is Kibler, but Firebat, Dog, Regis, and Trump are also great entertainers.
---
I don't really mind the lack of tournament mode or anything like that - the single player content and Tavern Brawls are enough to keep me interested. Right now I average 5 wins a day during each meta, which feels about right for a casual mobile game.
---
Stopped reading ar goldshire footman
---
Feugen or noggenfogger
---
It would get it to 5 health. (the fandral in the picture) 
---
The death  from the 2 damage would not resolve until the end of the turn, and would immediately be healed for five
---
It's only 7k dust if you craft it. Most people at lower ranks are f2p or cheap, so they go on hsreplay and look at what decks they can make using the legends they naturally opened. Then craft a few missing epics. They're decks are probably cheap as hell just making better use of the legends they naturally got.
---
Your essentially complaining that your not a good deck maker. If they can't rise higher then rank 18, and your losing to them, then you are even more of a noob then they are. Just a fact.
---
Going the way of MOBAs, you'd get nothing.
---
But to be fair, LoL gives out 14 champions (compared to over 140 champions, so &lt;10%). If you give out 4 legendaries now (one class legendary per set), that is less than &lt;5% but still more experimentation than now.
---
Your point?
---
Mastercard or visa
---
&gt;The cards released with this set have been given every class a viable ladder deck to play.
---
priest
---
Imo she‚Äôs definitely not the most powerful but she has my favorite voiceline from the entire expansion.
---
There have been several posts about this. Yea.
---
We know
---
But if you use it on a 2-health minion, does it kill it, reduce it to 0 and then heal for 5, heal for 3, or something else?
---
No breaks!
---
Unleash + Timber Wolf clears that.
---
1. What makes you so sure?
---
2. So what?
---
So since i have vereesa already i just ignore it?
---
It‚Äôs one of the few ways I can get views, since I am smaller creator, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to but I try to be as honest as possible.
---
He chinaman?
---
He could‚Äôve won that easily wtf
---
oh haha good idea, just added one.
---
agreed.
---
I‚Äôm running the token druid, it‚Äôs getting pretty hard for me to win at this rank, but maybe i‚Äôm just weak ahah
---
Frost Lich Jaina was an insane card but BSM and Odd Mage was tier 3 decks ever since the fall. Just because it doesn't see play doesn't mean it was not powerful af.
---
Jade druid and DK's were shit for the game, too. What's your point?
---
What are the odds I‚Äôm playing against a bunch of people whose first time it is playing their deck. The reason for the rant is that lower ranks were not like this before the rotation. My guess is that all of the noobs got their free hall of fame dust and spent it on T1 decks but still can‚Äôt get past rank 18
---
So this isn't so much a "newbie" post, I was a consistent rank 3 player during Mean Streets/early Un'goro but haven't played the game at all since. Is there a good video/site/whatever now to catch up on what I missed to get back into the game?
---
Because it is the "ranked" mode, which exists to reward wins with higher ranks. Even though you are on a low rank it is still a competetive environment.
---
If you loose, your deck obviously has weaknesses. Why should everyone else care for the fact that you refuse to work on these weaknesses?
---
You are given a choice, one will provide you a competititve advantage, one will not.
---
You chose the non competitive route, you made a choice that ended up with you being at a disadvantage, that's you showing you don't have the "skill" to be competitive.
---
Would it be nice if the world rewarded creativity? Sure, but that's not the world we live in, and understanding that is an important mental element if you want to be competitive.
---
You can make interesting and new decks and be competitive, but you need to be wayyyy more skilled in order to pull that off.
---
Is your build optimal? Do you know why you are losing?
---
go.....outside?  Are you crazy? :P
---
In addition at higher ranks, Token Druid becomes more difficult to play as people are smarter on how to counter it.
---
I thought that when I started as well.  And I thought cards like Deathwing were insane.  Now... I think it's the other way round.  Thalnos is a powerful card, don't underestimate spell damage that draws a card.  That said, it's not absolutely essential... and it's not a card you would build a deck around.
---
Because there is no ‚Äúworking on weaknesses‚Äù in your deck. I only wish the meta were that malleable. Everyone uses the same 4 deck lists from hsreplay.
---
6 years and player count going up is good retention. Sure retention dips between leagues but that happens between expansions in Hearthstone as well.
---
If you put it that way then I should say considering how kobolds and dks rotated out there isn't really any strong deck I think will last for the year,so I'm asking him to wait for an impactful expansion before he commits his dust to a deck.
---
It's on mobile?
---
It isn't broken. I think it is fine. In fact it is one of the few ways Mage can stay relevant.
---
Turn 3 giant is akin to the "god" hand. It is rare, but it happens and it is just the result of being extremely lucky. No different then a Rogue player that can produce a 12/12 Edwin turn 4.
---
hmmm, i should have said mobile instead of online. i dont think anyone on mobile would spend 29$ on a game... im trying to figure out if there is an alternative to hearthstone's mobile monetization strategy
---
Very
---
I think that‚Äôs the main reason, they always know how to counter me, i always get very soon to have nothing on my hand
---
No, you‚Äôre wrong. You said it yourself, I made the non-competitive choice, that has nothing to do with my skill level. What I‚Äôm saying is that I should be able to play non-competitive decks at rank 18 and not get slammed by tier 1 decks with 6 legendaries in them.
---
Yeah, that was me
---
Said I took more than one class, which doesn't include personal research. Never said bug free,
---
I could make text based hearthstone without a doubt. Sorry you aren't good at what you do, but text based HS would not be complex. Sorry bud.
---
Personally I hope YouTube comes up with a way to counteract Click-bait so you content creators don't have to worry about using it or not.  For now though, using it seems like the smart decision.
---
Zero. 
---
I refuse to play that deck for the very fear of getting the mirror matchup.
---
ANd say what you will, I have been watching Jackie play tournaments the last 2 nights and he is always waiting for like 30+ minutes after each round because of warrior mirror matches. Last night I only got to watch 1 round, that's how long it was between matches. Mirror Warrior is ruining tournaments.
---
Real question is, have they ever had it?
---
If it works like wrath then it kills it
---
Fenrir16#1818 Looking to trade 80g quest NA, I show you go first
---
You basically hit on the nail, although I adore their content they did leave out some crucial data. I think they need to start referring to VS about the decklists because, for example, they said the Togwaggle deck is the best performing deck for Rogue. I'm guessing they said that because it has the most games logged but that really just isn't true its the Myracle rogue that omits the burgle package that's the best deck rn and that's what they should be recommending. They really need to be careful when doing this if they want their name more well known.
---
You made the choice to have fun and pilot your own deck, not going to say that's a bad decision. But why should other players play at a disadvantage just for you?
---
It‚Äôs early, but this year‚Äôs meta feels even more restricted than last year‚Äôs. There‚Äôs only one viable archetype per heroes, and 5 heroes are far superior to the others... so there‚Äôs basically only 5 active archetypes in all of the ladder right now.
---
That‚Äôs not sustainable. It‚Äôs the equivalent to a fighting game with only 5 characters.
---
Love the game and hopeful they‚Äôll make it interesting again.
---
Didn‚Äôt block out the card names smh noob move
---
Pretty low, but as I have written there are also other possibilites.
---
I'm not saying it wasn't strong, but it's clearly less strong than the Death Knights.
---
The company is doing exactly what it wants to do: make tons of money.
---
dude...
---
Correct play is Soulfire own face twice and then play imp for maximum 11 damage.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they should, but do not try to tell me that the reason I‚Äôm losing is because I‚Äôm not skilled enough. That is clearly not true and honestly it‚Äôs that kind of ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù dismissive attitude that causes people to ignore real problems with the game
---
I feel like there really is no purpose in elysiana. The only control decks that come remotely close to fatigue other than warriors is mage. And no mage will run with her in the deck because you will never fatigue against any other class than warrior...
---
I remember those days.
---
Now i just play arena and have usually at least 500 gold at all times.
---
I don‚Äôt deny that, I just think it‚Äôs funny that you think Blizzard really listens to our feedback
---
What are these obvious patterns? Do you mean like card draw rng or card generation rng or boombot hit face for 1 rng or just all of that?
---
Oh man I felt like that guy just now. I usually just curse under my breath and throw my phone though. You know, the usual.
---
What have you been playing then?
---
Zoom in on Reno.... He looks like he's got a hangover from hell lol
---
I wonder if they will be answering questions on alternative game mods in the works.
---
Does he make his own titles and thumbnails?
---
&gt; to increase the total number of views
---
And where do you think those views come from? No matter how clickbaity you make your titles and thumbnails, your hearthstone videos will be shown to people who watch hearthstone videos. By having your video promoted more by youtube's algorithm, you're promoting your video *instead of another HS video*. The total amount of views doesn't increase.
---
That's not counter play, that's just just playing the game.  
---
Counter play such as silence a taunt minion, destroy a weapon.  
---
There is what, 1 card that affects hero powers in mind breaker?  
---
You seem to want to argue about "decks" where as I'm referring to a specific card and it's mechanics.  
---
I assume you had the same argument when Rexxar was in play because plenty of decks countered hunter decks so thus Rexxar wasn't a problem for infinite generation either then?
---
Rocketeer is mentioned by OP in another comment as having a 60% win rate.

---
Trump's reactions are the best.  I want to go see a horror movie with that dude.
---
Who is this?
---
Id say all of it. Im assuming that they all use some sort of seed number to create the rng. But I guess I just want a little more in depth explanation on how it all works.
---
Idk why the dislikes lol his videos are the best out there! :)
---
Was checking out the PTR earlier, saw these outside of Mechagon. Was great, almost made a post before seeing this.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt prefer a more aggro playstyle so maybe tempo rouge but there is also token druid but id  don‚Äôt want to feed the flame more
---
Yep. Agreed. I've never actually hit the turn limit either.
---
Ah, you‚Äôre one of those. Anyways, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúreport bug with this npc‚Äù button on everything in the ptr.
---
Earlier today in arena my opponent played a faceless summoner after khadgar and summoned two deathlords. When I killed them they each summoned 2 copies of a minion from my deck. Was kind of unexpected but makes sense.
---
"Choose both" with fandral isn't a regular card (clearly), so there's no reason to believe it will always act like a normal card. The healing is the *expected* outcome, but you always want confirmation.
---
I teched hecklebot in my control shaman for this reason but I can never pull that damned elysiana.
---
Hey /u/thecoolestdomains, just a heads up that I'm sending the full content of that message to /u/siz27.  I'm not sure why you decided to post this here instead of sending him a PM, but just FYI, saying that you are just going to create an alt to get around a ban probably isn't the smartest thing.
