Golden Candle was one of my favorite treasures before chapter V even came out, now it's simply my favorite. After all the bullshit 20-damage Arcane Explosions, "satisfaction" doesn't begin to describe [this.[https://i.imgur.com/wWDj0mR.png)

Deathweb I kinda agree with but Warlock right now is just zoo, because there is less healing in Warlock, and Deathweb is a turn 6-7 play and not a turn 5.
---
Aviana is still questionable because you are giving your opponent a free card, so for it to become 'playable' you need to stick stats on it to see if it survives.

Well it's your right to think that way and I can understand your frustrations. From my POV, the new treasures added make the experience feel different, the new heroes for every class with multiple flavors of hero power and deck archetype also add more detail as well as another new thing from previous adventures and I'm a sucker for RP so i love the storytelling aspect too.

The newly added Blood Elf - meets Nozdormu character in Chapter 5 with Counterspells and the copy secrets also does not give you enough time. Other than that I can only think of a very lucky Wendy or an appropriately timed single target removal spell which most of the bosses have if you would pre attack buff.

Not OP but I have the set of 80 brush/chisel tip ones and I love them. They have sets of 168 but they only come in chisel/bullet tips. You gotta swatch them because the colors don't match their caps and the names sometimes don't make sense like a green will be labeled as yellow. But other than that the brush tips work great and they blend really well. I've never used copics though so I can't compare.

How did you get this combo???
---
You’re doing okay. It’s the sender of the hatemail that needs to check themselves (before they wreck themselves).
---
vs warrior you are correct, never play tracking (except vs bomb warrior if the changes of getting bombs with it is high).
---
The maximum amount that you can deal with your OTK is 47 dmg, so try everything you can to pressure him enough so he can't get more than 20 armor, obvious playing around heal is hard.
---
Finding the right balance between going face, don't play into aoe, know when to bait him or take a risky turn is hard, playing the matchups over and over can help you,  if you have a friend playing the decks you have problems with it can both help you and him to get better with it. You can also try to max the value with hero powering as often as possible.
---
If you are really facing that much warrior you should play a other deck tho.

Because the policy is firm:  No reimbursement for Arena disconnects.  Presumably because they're too easy to fake for a bad match/run.  Although a CSR could never actually say that.

A few strategies work well:

- Out swarm him early

- hold a bunch of small/mid sized things and dump them all on the same turn
---
- grind him down with spells/hero power
---
The key is to not let him get anything decent of yours for free. Even if you have a few 1/1s don't play a bigger minion behind them because he will clear them and take it.

Reinstalling everything fixed it for me
---
Availability of the non-basic heroes has been a bone of contention for players for a long time (people have been really salty about Tyrande's availability).
---
It's definitely something that should change, but for default heroes I feel we can only really blame Warcraft lore. The ratio of male to female core lore characters in the source material leaves something to be desired as well.
---
Not even in the slightest . Including more women characters would mean including more side characters or creating completely new ones, which blizzard clearly doesn't want to. Majority of Warcraft's main character are male and that's the way it is. If you are to be infuriated by hearthstones gender inequivalence then just don't play the game. Problem solved.
---
I've got a baseline knowledge of the lore, feel free to tell me exactly why I'm stupid for suggesting that women should be prominent characters.
---
I mean, name a prominent female warrior character in warcraft. This game doesnt make up its own heroes very often.
---
He didn't say that. there are just less female heroes in the warcraft lore and the heroes in HS are THE signatures for their class.
---
The Lore is permanently evolving and HS has alternate female heroes but creating these needs time and efford. You can't expect people to do what exactly YOU want AT ONCE.
---
If you want more female heroes write Blizzard. Oh and learn to read what other people say - they are only responsible for what they say not for what you think they might say/mean.
---
The game after this one, he discounted my y'shaarj to 0. So he sometimes is a bro
---
Okay, but isn't it a symptom of the same problem that there *isn't* a prominent female Warrior? Shouldn't there be *one?*
---
Priest needs to save their minion buffs for big guys, then keep buffing one dude. Both sides buff this one minion. After a while (if you’re lucky) you’ll get the minion to somewhere around 80 HP, drop the buff to make a minion’s attack equal to its health and boom. Problem solved.
---
Mostly because of salt or people just don't respect the time of others. 
---
I do think the game can mess up if someone just quits. I was watching a streamer playing another streamer and one quit and started another game but the other player was still in the other game.

---
That's not quite how it works in development. You have a backlog of topics and need to prioritize it accordingly. If there's a case of lower importance sitting then for some time and other comes just know but is more crucial, it will have priority over that.
---
Why is not machine gun Warlock in here? That's true budget.
---
I think the best change to aviana while still keeping the soul of the card is "After this minion attacks, the next card each player plays costs (0)."
---
That preserves the double sided effect, but means you benefit first, and the opponent might consider letting you keep the minion in order to benefit too - or they have to try and kill it and lose out themselves (whereas atm they get the benefit, then kill it and you've just played 5 mana to give the opponent a free cast.)
---
It also means if you don't want the effect that turn (only 1-cost cards in hand or something) you can choose not to attack to stop the opponent from benefiting as well.
---
Reduces the cost of all cards by half (and even rounds down, so a 9 drop becomes 4), but has the trade-off that you can only play two cards a turn. If you have big minions it’s great, obviously if you’ve got a zoo type deck not good, but many people won with them and they even got ‘nerfed’ to not appear as much as they used to.

---
If you can‘t get above rank 16 it‘s not about the deck, but your hearthstone fundamentals. Check out the resources on the CompHS subreddit and invest time in reading through it.
---
Learn the basics about beatdown vs control, tempo/value, mana efficiency, play to win not to lose and try to apply these concepts in your games.
---
Play slower and learn all the main cards of each deck at each mana slot. Slowly but gradually you‘ll improve!
---
I wouldn't dust Sea Giant, it's a card that tends to stay relevant with zoo decks. The others are less universal.
---
Mr Chu was actually Madam Goya’s bodyguard (she was a black market runner and all). He’s no newbie to the villainy industry that’s for sure.

&gt;Curio collector: 5-5 seems fine
---
I can agree with most of your suggestions but this one I disagree, a close to vanilla stats that grows is just OP, see Hench-Clan Thug.
---
And making Lady in White 3 mana is just repeating Prince 2 over again, I think 5 mana is a decent cost for the effect.
---
I got a Jaraxxus in the left of my hand neutralizing the emerald goggles and Khadgar got princess talanji
---
Unfortunately the opponents usually suicide minions onto the boss, meaning it's mostly correct not to buff any of their minions in my experience. Hold off until you can solo the boss yourself, and pray you don't get hand-swapped.
---
That is awesome!!!
---
Jepetto is not the only final boss for chapter 3 - there is also Captain Hannigan (which is probably rarer, but quite different opponent, although stealth is still good vs him).
---
Exactly
---
And considering Golden Candle was played, Khadgar has no more spells to cast for his hero power elementals to take advantage of

Yep, laying people off en masse and demanding more work from them definitely has no correlation with any further issues usually associated with a company being understaffed.

---
Instead of saying that mine was all bad, why don't you do like /u/FartHast and say your suggestions?
---
Yes, priest is right now the worst class in the game. It has a poor set of classic and basic cards, and its power varies wildly with expansions.
---
Robes of gaudiness are really good too.  Probably the best all around all chapter treasure.  Ended up a warlock against khadgar with several 10+ attack creatures on turn 4.  Khadgar could play whatever he wanted and my board still built right over top him
---
Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary will only show those rarities.
---
Token druid is a great recommendation. It's cheap and simple to learn and you can definitely reach high ranks with it. It's a bit of a one trick pony, but that's the beauty of it. Just go wide on the board and buff the minions then beat the opponents face in.
---
Should have played above it
---
The problem is treasures themselves are too random because of draw luck. I had a fantastic paladin deck with spells cost health, the 3 dudes to hand hero power, and 3 swampqueen's treasure, so I'd turn 5 dudes into a good pool of legendaries on turn 3 or 4.  But on Kalacgos all my treasures were at the bottom of my deck, and that was it.
---
A run with the win robes, potion of vim (vigor? the draw 2 one) and a pile of mechs, Zilliax's and KEA's was an easy run since it didnt't rely on drawing a treasure.
---
Now it is perfect
---
Extremely op isn’t really a good argument imo. It’s single player content and it requires a few fairly uncommon things to happen. It’s a lot harder to pull off than infinite sound the bells (all you need is the goggles and no other cards in hand). Single player stuff is designed to flex the game and pull off some zany shit. If I want to fill my deck with 0 mana war gears, why not

Nice! But why upload a picture where the drawing takes less than 50% of the area?
---
Duskfallen Aviana - attack isn't going to make her harder to remove. Maybe you get slightly better trades out of it, but her most common cause of death is hard removal. The best buff I can think of would be to make her effect one sided. It's a little polarizing, but most people have the means to remove her anyway.
---
Forest Guide - bad trades isn't even close to why this card doesn't see play. Drawing your opponent cards is the issue and there isn't even a good mill deck opportunity.
---
Vilebrood skitterer - one health isn't going to change much, especially since you want to rush this into big minions
---
Toxmonger - this is a real head scratcher. If you really want to buff it, reduce the mana cost to make it easier to combo earlier in the game and maybe reduce an hp to compensate. this guy isn't supposed to be near curve and shouldn't be expected to survive a turn. Also, you are forgetting Halazi, who makes this card powerful control.
---
Toki - she was already playable and this makes her auto-include. Maybe just give her a point of attack or health instead
---
Curio Collector - fuck no. This card is already enough of a headache in the few decks I've seen it in. I don't want it to even more reliably scale out of control
---
Prince Liam - Hoarding 1 drops in hand in the hopes of drawing this guy becomes too powerful. Keeping in mind that kind of deck would be aggressive, and you would be giving it a flawless transition to a midrange control buster.
---
Ghostly Charger - If your change needs to be justified like that,it probably isn't good. You neglect that it can be used to finish off damaged minions.
---
Holy Water - the card already sees play and can steal high value minions pretty easily.
---
Lady in White - Really? Lowering the cost isn't going to help you draw her. If anything, she could really use the same change you gave Liam
---
Face Collector - Don't just throw pasta at the wall to see what sticks. Value cards aren't meant to be very powerful, they are meant to out value and ultimately overwhelm your opponent later in the game.
---
Wanted! - By that logic, we should reduce almost all rogue spells by 1.
---
Totem Cruncher - Reducing mana cost actually would help since you can more easily combo it with hero power or cards that summon totems. Adding health is ok, but the battlecry stat shift makes no sense at all. You will just end up with something that has tons of health and not enough damage.
---
Witch's Apprentice - You don't need to turn this into a babbling book clone. Flavor is a part of the game whether you like it or not and a 0/1 chump blocker can actually come in handy more than a 1/1.
---
Deathweb Spider - this is not a "small" change. It would be auto-include in many decks considering you will almost always get back more health than you paid for it without risk.
---
Blackhowl Gunspire - again, don't just throw pasta at the wall. If you are changing something, make sure it has a clear purpose or at the very least don't let your incompetence shine through in the explanation.
---
Deadly Arsenal - the problem with this card was never the cost... The problem is including enough weapons to make it worthwhile.
---
Overall it is pretty clear you haven't played with most of these cards. It seems like in a lot of cases you took a card that seems good but never saw much play and gave it a buff to make it seem better.
---
Absolutely

I wouldn't mind this mode if you had more control over decks and 90% of the run wasn't determined by whether you get lucky and are able to create some bullshit OP combo that lets you win on turn 3. It's very telling that with half the offered decks/hero powers you can lose to just Linzi because the AI get to play the fun version of Dalaran Heist up until you get an OP treasure.

If you cleared the last chapters OK I assume you're stuck on the final bosses? Cloak of invisibility helps to stop them constantly wiping your board, Rocket Backpack lets you play reactively and avoid constantly losing your minions (especially good vs. Khadgar's elementals), and as always any mana cost-reducing treasures are strong, especially with \[\[Rin, the First Disciple\]\]
---
The thing is, the Dalaran Heist bosses have good to amazingly synergistic decks, you don't, ours are usually from bad to slightly good. Using the Golden Candle is more beneficial to you than to them. This is especially true with the last 3 bosses of chapter 5, who have said amazingly synergistic decks.

For someone who really enjoyed the prior deck-builders I've definitely played enough Heist to make it worth $20 on content alone.  Between the different heroes/powers/wings the replayability is there.
---
The penalty of Fel Reaver is vastly underrated by the pros.  Milling 3 cards per card played is insane.  If you play it on 5, sure, it's great.. If you play this late, which often is how it goes, you can mill your opponents entire deck in 2 turns.. and then remove the supposedly fearsome 8/8 and win.
---
Very powerful at times, yes, but to me it's a Pyroblast.  You better have it when you need it, and use it at the right time, or it just loses you the game.
---
It would die on its first strike
---
I do it tho on the last boss, i mean it mostly ends in one sided so when it's my time to do that, i prefer to savor the sweet satisfying victory, well i'd do that only if i see that there's no chance that the boss could do a comeback.
---
I think it's fun enough that I bought it for my girlfriend and for myself, and those were the first and second times I spent real money on HS since it came out. 
---
I just wish there was some big overarching reason to keep playing it, like I dunno, unlocking each hero to be used outside DH if you beat a heroic run with every one of their hero powers and decks, or something. That would provide so much replayability. As it is it's just a shitty card back. That's my only gripe with it.

Kamran#2234 NA 80g quest trade.
---
But he can fill his entire board
---
You need to have all 5 wings first
---
The treasure is doing exactly what it advertises. I see no issues here
---
Lots of buffs, 2x splitting bananas, randomized mana
---
Thank goodness i never matched with you :x haha jk
---
Why wouldn't the coin be affected? It's a card in your hand, and Toggwaggle's Dice quasi-randomizes the cost of cards in your hand.
---
But my 1 mana coin gives 1 mana....
---
They said Monopoly of World of Warcraft?
---
The rotation happens in april, the sets from the previous year rotates in 10 months. That’s why you should definitely craft the legendaries you need, but as you already have some pretty good decks you could wait for next expansion.
---
In the meanwhile you should try to get to rank 5 or higher as the end of season reward are much better.
---
True balance
---
Which boss? Some heropowers hit random targets, usually the AI doesn’t break game rules like that.
---
What could they do turn 1 when you have 7 100/100 (or whatever you want) minions?
---
It's a Disastah!
---
The A.I. doesn’t play around it and it’s glorious.
---
That's pretty rude TBH, made fun of the Op (original poster) like that. why? WHat did he / she / it do to you? Why are you so mad at them?? You can just downvote the post (like i downvoted your comment) you dont have to lash out on them and make fun of them in the comment section.? What if they see your comment and get very mad or even cry? It is really mad that some people just want to embarass others.
---
I really don't understand how some things get upvoted and others don't. Like was the capitalized "ever" really that much of a turn off? lol
---
Artificial difficulty.
---
Tbh it’s more of a F*** you to anyone who took scroll of wonders for jokes
---
Kind of, it’s strange but I dont remember beating so easily other adventure’s normal mode

You know you had 2 other choices dipshit.

ToddieJay#1113 NA - Looking to trade 80g quest.  I show then you go first.  Quick game or real match, your choice.  Thanks!
---
Name checks out.
---
There should be a completion mark for Ragnaros wins. That’s the real heroic
---
Nah, just misread his comment as making fun of op for not knowing hearthstone is based on wow
---
r/doesntbufftunneltrogg
---
&gt; Making it one-sided is just as a bad change like mine, making it a 4/10 would be better, for surviving and getting better trades
---
Just spitballing with that one, or make her "evasive' so direct removal doesn't work. It would take a lot longer to figure out how to buff her and actually keep the spirit of her effect. Buffing her stats is virtually inconsequential since again, she usually dies to hard removal instead of damage.
---
&gt;Standard is not the only place where this card can see play
---
My assumption is that buffs are for standard. Buffing things for wild doesn't make a whole lot of sense considering the power level and diversity is so high already.
---
&gt;You talk about Halazi and then suggest to reduce Toxmonger mana, that doesn't much sense either.
---
It makes sense because you play Halazi, get lynxes with rush, play Toxmonger with your lynxes to kill a bunch of minions in one turn. Reducing his mana cost by 1 means you get to play 1 more lynx.
---
&gt;A 5-mana 5/5 'draw' a card is not auto-include, especially when Wild has so many shitty legendaries
---
Blizzard has been moving away from cheap "draw" so it will almost always cost 1.5 mana per drawn card. Sure she isn't so overtly powerful that you literally auto-include her in every deck, but she would be very close
---
&gt;The opponent has 1 turn to kill it
---
Exactly! It's another minion that you only have a single turn to answer before it just starts scaling out of control. I don't care if it doesn't see play, it should never see play because that is just a shitty thing to have in the game. there are so many better things to have in the game.
---
&gt;This card doesn't see play at all, don't know where you are seeing this card but ok.
---
It's the design principal that they found that being killed by your own minions sucks. So even seeing it a little bit is going to make it seem like a much bigger problem than it is. It's also why it shouldn't be buffed.
---
&gt;Just look at Wanted and see how out-of-loop you are here. 4-mana deal 3 damage, if it kills get a coin.
---
&gt;It's worst than Shadow Bolt that paid the tax of life tap. Compare this to frost bolt, dark bomb...
---
Cards aren't meant to be equally powerful. Feel free to look at Fireball and Mortal Strike and lose your shit over that. I still don't see how buffing Wanted adds anything interesting to the game. 
---
&gt;Reducing it's mana cost would make in unplayable in the only deck that might use it being Even Shaman in Wild. And Even Shaman being a decent aggressive deck, the stat shift of the battlecry makes sense.
---
That just makes less sense! If you want it to be more aggressive, make the battlecry favor attack more. Also, the whole even/odd thing got hated so much it was booted from standard a year early. Aside of just not needing to buff things in wild, we really don't need to make it into a dumpster fire.
---
&gt;Warlock right now has no healing
---
Wat. Warlock still has enough healing and lifesteal to make Priest and Paladin blush. The class has less healing than it did before, but that was just an insane amount of healing for a class that is supposed to use health as a resource and play brinksmanship. All that goes out the window when you give them a minion that protects and heals them with no thought involved.
---
&gt;What was the clear point of the buff to Flark's Boom-Zooka?
---
Fair point. Then again, I'm starting to just expect that level of incompetence from Team 5. A lot of the rise of mech changes either broke things or were ineffective
---
&gt;Assuming this card is 5-mana, let's compare it to excavated evil.
---
Bad comparison, EE only saw major play because Priest was pretty desperate for a board wipe. I doubt it would see much play in the current meta.
---
&gt;I could say the same about you, about most of your suggestions.
---
Glad we are on the same page then
---
Pretty sure she does feel comfortable with herself.  You're the one who seems to be uncomfortable with her and apparently women in general.  Whether or not she's trans has no fucking bearing on this conversation.  The fact that it was brought up **at all** is horrifying transphobic nonsense.
---
Chameleos has always behaved awkwardly with cards that change at the end of turn. If a chameleos copies an enemy chameleos, then it starts changing into cards in your own hand...
---
Draw RNG in a card game?? What?!?
---
Take a look at Conjurer Mage lots of fun.  https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-type/conjurer-mage/

Malygos

They could type "draw phase" on the card. Super misleading card text wasted dust crafting this shit xd
---
Zilliax for sure

Rank 11 plays

Thats not bug, just get better connection.

Correct my point was just showing that it’s not always.

How much cards does the last opponent have?
---
Oh, for sure there are cases where you need to go through the taunt to kill a high priority minion(with 3 or less health) but it’s not something that you see often when playing a midrange deck.
---
I noticed something similar when one of the last 3 bosses of the fifth heist ended up with 3 Antonidas (each one giving 1-2 fireballs), yet my small hero-power demons ended up being their intended target gradually throughout the encounter. If the A.I. were not incentivized to do this, they would have defeated me over the next few turns (with my hero-power damaging myself as well to contest the board).
---
However, this occurrence along with the not-too-rare bad play order misplays, or even outright nuking their own minions before attacking with them occasionally feels like there is a magical “PlayerWins=1” variable set. 
---
I know this likely isn’t the case, but I have walked away feeling like I just watched an A.I. self-destruct and wonder if I could have been there as a friendly ear for them in such a time of need.
---
If I'm not mistaken (I played up to early legion, then revisited BfA for a...brief period) I think max bag size is somewhere around 40 now
---
I am power INCARNATE! Just the raw power emanating from that card is amazing.
---
Just restart the game and it will work

&gt;You can stop posting server issues and non-buffed Doppelgangsters too by now, we all have seen those posts at least 10 times.

Pyroblast. Learned that today.

The Coin
---
I just made it to boss 9 and stopped for now. I have to play against the one that takes 15 seconds per turn now. 
---
I have the treasure where cards cost half, but only play 2, and the dice effect that randomizes. I have drafted Kel’thuzad, sylvanas, tirion. So my strat is to get a Kel, hope it gets discounted under 4, and play it alongside a big minion like Tirion and keep putting up big threats that hopefully just get resurrected. 
---
We’ll see how this goes when I get brave enough to continue
---
Also, another orphaned word.
---
Reno doesn't heal the player and also shows how much he healed for in the card history. As someone who hasn't played the adventure I don't know what the max hp is so the big numbers make it more impressive to me
---
I mean I just used the in-game currency and I feel fine about it.

Normal should be just a bit more challenging, but great run overall.

All I know is my luck with those pack was insane. Out of the twenty packs I pulled 12 legendaries. So I'm all for supporting Esports if I get that luck
